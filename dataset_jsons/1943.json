The first pig, using a prefabricated home kit, erects a wire structure, then quickly covers it with straw. The second pig uses hundreds of matches to make up his house, though when he puts the last match in place on the roof, the entire building collapses. The third pig goes through the tedious task of laying bricks for his house.\nSatisfied with their homes, the first two pigs dance around, act silly, and laugh with each other; the first pig plays a violin, and the second pig a flute. The wolf arrives dressed as a gypsy, and sets about, through dance, trying to lure the first two pigs into a position to be captured. The pigs are suspicious and, when the wolf thinks he has them, the pigs instead rough him up and emerge each wearing parts of his costume; they briefly dance until the wolf approaches threateningly. He chases them to the straw house, which he incinerates in seconds with a lit match.  The pigs flee to the match house. Though it has a front door, it is still in a state of collapse; the pigs speedily pile the matches up to form a house, then the wolf drops one last match onto the roof and it all falls apart. The pigs race to the brick house. The wolf attempts to bash in the front door, then resorts to huffing and puffing to blow the house down (to which the pigs respond by offering Lusterine mouthwash), but he fails. The wolf sets up to run at the front door; the three pigs work together to squelch this effort.\nThe third pig is not thrilled to have the other two in his house, especially when they again begin dancing around with their instruments, acting silly and laughing. Then, they notice an apparently homeless woman (the wolf) outside the window, playing a violin in the snow. The 'snow' is actually talcum powder held on a stick above the wolf's head. The first two pigs take pity and push the third pig (who realizes it is the wolf) away from the door to let the despondent person in. The wolf continues the deception and continues playing the violin. The third pig, upon peeking under the clothing and seeing that the wolf has a record player on his back, flips the record over. Fast-paced music begins and the wolf dances to it but loses his costume as a result. The wolf then chases the pigs up to the second floor of the house. The pigs make their escape in an elevator, but when the wolf tries to use it he drops into an empty shaft. The wolf is unaware that he is falling, but rather thinks he is riding the elevator down. He politely doffs his hat as gentlemen in an elevator did back in the 1940s and just stands there politely looking up.

The navigator, Lieutenant Monk Hauser Jr., is the son of a hero of the World War I Lafayette Escadrille. The pilot is Michael \"Irish\" Quincannon Sr., the co-pilot is Bill Williams, and the bombardier is Tom McMartin. Sergeant Joe Winocki is a disgruntled gunner who, as an aviation cadet in 1938, washed out of flight school after he caused a mid-air collision in which another cadet was killed. Quincannon was the flight instructor who requested a board of inquiry into the accident.\nWith the United States still neutral, the Mary-Ann and the other B-17s fly, fully equipped except for ammunition, to Hickam Field. They arrive on December 7, 1941, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. In its aftermath, the tired crew is ordered, with little rest, to fly first to Wake Island, and finally to Clark Field in the Philippines, both also still under Japanese attack. En route, the crew listens to President Franklin D. Roosevelt ask Congress for a declaration of war. They take along two passengers: fighter pilot Lieutenant Thomas \"Tex\" Rader and a small dog, \"Tripoli\", the Marines' mascot on Wake Island.\nWhen they land at Clark Field, White learns that his son was killed while trying to lead his squadron into the air during the first attack. Soon after, Quincannon volunteers his bomber (the only one available) to attack a Japanese invasion fleet, but the Mary-Ann is swarmed by enemy carrier fighters and forced to abort after losing two engines. The fatally wounded Quincannon orders his men to bail out, then he blacks out. Winocki remains aboard and pilots the Mary-Ann to a successful belly landing when he is unable to lower the landing gear.\nHaving told the now dying Quincannon that the Mary-Ann is ready to fly, the crew works feverishly through the night to repair their bomber, scavenging parts from other damaged B-17s, as the Japanese Army closes in. Chester, the assistant radio operator, volunteers to fly as gunner in a two-seat observation plane. They are caught in an enemy air raid. Chester bails out after the pilot is killed, but is machine-gunned while descending in his parachute, then strafed to death on the ground. Winocki and White shoot down the Zero fighter with .30 caliber machine guns. When the pilot stumbles from the burning wreckage, Winocki shoots him. The crew barely manages to finish the repairs and refueling when the Japanese overrun the airfield. With help from Marines and Army soldiers, Mary-Ann takes off, her waist machine guns returning fire.\nAs they head to Australia, with Rader as the reluctant pilot and the wounded Williams as co-pilot, they spot a large Japanese naval invasion task force directly below. The crew radios the enemy's position and circles until reinforcements arrive; the Mary-Ann then leads the attack that devastates the Japanese fleet (this dramatic sequence mirrors the real events of the Battle of the Coral Sea).Later in the war, a bombing attack on Tokyo is finally announced to a roomful of bomber crews, among them several familiar faces from the Mary-Ann, including Rader, now a B-17 pilot.

To give a positive impression of the Soviet Union to the American audience, the country's ethnic diversity is covered in, detail and elements of Russian culture that are familiar to Americans, including the musical compositions of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Leo Tolstoy's book War and Peace, are also mentioned. Communism is never mentioned in the film, but the Russian Orthodox Church is described as a force opposing Nazism. The start of the film includes a quote from US General Douglas MacArthur, who commends the Russian people's defense of their nation as one of the most courageous feats in military history.\nThe film then covers the German conquests of the Balkans, which are described as a preliminary to close off possible Allied counter-invasion routes before the war against Russia was launched on June 22, 1941. The narration describes the German keil und kessel tactics for offensive warfare and the Soviet \"defence in depth\" tactic to counter that. The scorched earth Soviet tactics, the room-to-room urban warfare in Soviet cities, and the guerilla warfare behind enemy lines are also used to underline the Soviet resolve for victory against the Germans. The Siege of Leningrad and the Battle of Stalingrad conclude the film.\nThe episode, like other entries in the Why We Fight series, omits many facts that could have cast the Soviet Union in a negative light, such as its occupation of the Baltic states, its war against Finland, its occupation and atrocities in Poland, and its occupation of Romanian territory.Virtually in line with Soviet propaganda, the series was not only screened but also widely acclaimed in the Soviet Union. The episode has been described as \"a blatant pro-Soviet propaganda posing as factual analysis\" and was withdrawn from circulation during the Cold War. Capra commented about why certain material was left out:\nWe had a political problem with Russia on that film. The problem was that a hell of a lot of people on our side were not about to be sold a bill of goods by the Communists. We were their allies, but that was all. Communism was not something we desired. So we stayed a way from politics and made it a people's battle.

Taro falls in love with Clancy's secretary, Tama Shimamura and they plan to marry. His father does not accept their marriage because Tama is not from a respectable family. Taro is then drafted to the war in China. Tama and Taro write frequent letters to each other and Tama attempts to show Reo Seki all the letters Taro has sent but he refuses to see them or have anything to do with his son.\nMeanwhile, in China, Taro experiences the brutality of war and witnesses the cruelty of the Japanese to the poor in China.  He is told to accept it by a higher-ranked officer. Sara Braden is an American reporter in China as well as Clancy O'Hara's girlfriend, and she complains to Taro about the violence that the Japanese soldiers are showing towards others. Taro, remembering what the higher-ranked officer had told him, shrugs it off. Outraged, Sara tells him that the war has changed him.\nTama and Reo receive news that Taro is coming home and arrange for a celebration with Clancy, Boris and Max. When Taro arrives, he is different. Reo explains that he has arranged for Tama to be adopted into a respectable family and will allow them to marry. But then, Sara comes in and tells everyone about the children that Taro let die in China to which Tama is in shock. Clancy comments on the Japanese which angers Taro and he demands a fight. They both choose a proxy; Clancy brings American Lefty O'Doyle and Taro chooses a Japanese judo expert. Lefty O'Doyle wins and the judo wrestler is killed for the shame he has brought on the Emperor. Clancy warns Tama that Sara was right, Taro has changed but she has arranged an outing to the countryside to see her parents for the last time before her adoption.\nWhen they arrive in the countryside, Tama finds out that her younger sister has been sold in order for her parents to attain more money for Tama and her wedding. Tama begs for Taro to buy back her younger sister and he agrees. Reo warns Clancy that he should leave Japan immediately and return to America because he knows that they will attack Pearl Harbor. Back in the countryside, Taro has now heard news of the attack on Pearl Harbor and the Emperor's call to all his men and leaves the country home. Tama asks if he will save her sister in Tokyo but he replies that there is no time for personal issues when the Emperor is in their need and that her sister was a noble sacrifice.

A year later, Taro, now in the air corps regiment, testifies against Tama, Clancy and Sara saying that he was \"suspicious of them from the first time he met them\". Soon after, Clancy proposes to Sara and there is an American bombing raid on Tokyo in which Reo attempts to save Tama, Clancy and Sara but Tama refuses at last minute. At the same time, Taro's plane is hit and he dies.\nThe film ends back in 1943.

Tommy has bought a greyhound pup he names \"Short Head\" and hopes to race. Bob Matthews (Friend) is a newcomer to the East End who just lost his job and has to postpone his wedding to Nan Harper (Hiatt) as a result. Tommy and Bob meet in The Hopvine, a pub run by Ma and Pa Robbins (Muriel George and Pierce), whose son Ted (Mason) is a fireman with the London Fire Brigade. Ted's girl Susie has just joined the brigade as a dispatcher, but Ma Robbins cannot hide her thinly disguised disapproval of Susie's love of dance halls. The Army won't accept new enlistments, so Tommy persuades Bob to join the AFS with him. Sam, a small-time thief of barrels of Guinness, inadvertently joins the service while trying to avoid the clutches of Eastchapel Police Constable O'Brien (Richard George), who dogs him with the persistence of Javert. The three are assigned immediately to the \"Q\" sub-station of the East End's District 21, set up in a school to train under Ted.\n\"Q sub\" responds to its first call at Christmas. Although the fire is out when they arrive, crusty District Officer MacFarlane (Currie) is impressed with Ted's efforts and posts him, along with Tommy, Sam and Bob, as a crew at District 21's superintendent's station. Nan and Bob finally marry and take a flat near Benjamin's Wharf. She becomes pregnant, suffering fainting spells, and befriends Ma Turk. Ted is reluctant to marry, so Susie goes dancing with ladies' man Tommy as a means of making Ted jealous, while Ted rides Tommy for his apparent aversion to fighting fires. Tommy races Short Head, who perpetually loses, costing not just Tommy, but his fellow firemen who have wagered on her. Sam continues to steal barrels of Guinness, but O'Brien begins to close in.\nIn August 1940 the Battle of Britain is raging, but London has not yet been bombed. The 21-Q crew have yet to fight a serious fire and have become sensitive about it. Tommy discovers Short Head has been losing because Ma Turk has been feeding her doughnuts, and he enters her in a high-stakes race on 7 September, planning to wager all his money. His plans are interrupted that afternoon by the first massive German air raid on London, which targets the East End Docks. The widespread fires cause chaos as water lines are broken and AFS crews are pressed into front-line service. Ted saves Tommy's life by using a high-pressure hose to knock him away from a delay-action bomb just before it explodes. The second night of the blitz, the 21-Q crew, still struggling to bring the docks fire under control, have forged bonds with their full-time counterparts and officers in action. Ted's parents are unaccounted for, and Susie goes to find them. The Hopvine has been bombed, but through Susie's persistence, they are found in the cellar and rescued. The next morning, during a break, Tommy learns that Short Head won her race\u2014but he forgot to place the wager.\nThe third night German bombers return again, creating a huge fire at Benjamin's Wharf, and the District 21 crews are shifted there. Bob finds himself fighting a warehouse fire from inside his own burning flat, which has been declared expendable. However he takes comfort in the knowledge that Nan, about to give birth, is safe with Ma Turk at St John's Hospital. P.C. O'Brien arrives to arrest Sam, but a bomb explosion blows him into the River Thames, where Sam rescues him from drowning. Soon they learn that St John's Hospital is also on fire. Chief MacFarlane transfers Ted's crew to the hospital fire and enters the burning building to direct efforts to save the main building. Bob learns that Nan is safe and he has a new son. Another bomb strikes the hospital, trapping Chief MacFarlane. Tommy beats Ted to the ladder and finds the chief, but the building collapses, killing both.

There was discussion by Miss Strand that Walters has previously grafted the glands of different animals like placing a guinea pig's glands into a rabbit and a frog's glands into a mouse. To the horror of the nurse, the ape transforms into human form (Acquanetta). Telling the doctor that she cannot allow him to continue, Miss Strand informs him that at best he will have \"a human form, with animal instincts\". Dr. Walters reaches the conclusion that he will need to place a human brain into his creation to successfully complete his experiment. He sacrifices Miss Strand for this purpose. The brain transplant is a success, and the result is a sultry and exotic young woman who remembers nothing of her previous existence. Walters names her Paula Dupree, and takes his creation to the winter quarters for her first public outing. While watching Mason practice his animal act, an accident occurs. Paula rushes into the cage and saves him from the ferocious felines, who display an unnatural fear of her and retreat from her presence. Mason is dumbfounded and offers the girl a job in his act.\nAfter the final dress rehearsal, Paula becomes jealous of Mason's fianc\u00e9e. She goes to her dressing room and while having a tantrum, begins converting to animal form. Later that night, she climbs through Beth's window planning to kill her, but attacks and brutally murders another woman instead. The beast returns to Walters, and the doctor realizes that another operation is necessary to return her to human form. He can continue to use Dorothy for the glandular material, but will need yet another subject to replace Paula's damaged cerebrum.\nBeth receives a frantic telephone call from her sister who expresses her fear of Dr. Walters and the forthcoming operation. Arriving at the Sanatorium to aid her sister, Beth is pegged by the good doctor as the next brain donor for Cheela. However, she proves resourceful in a pinch, releasing the ape from its cage. Cheela does Walters in and departs the lab, leaving Beth and Dorothy unharmed. Performing his animal act solo, Mason finds himself trapped inside the cage with his unruly subjects. A powerful storm interrupts the performance and the beasts attack the trainer. Cheela comes to his rescue once again and carries him to safety, but a nearby police officer mistakes her intentions and kills Cheela.", "tmdb_plot": "An insane scientist doing experimentation in glandular research becomes obsessed with transforming a female gorilla into a human...even though it costs human life.", "tmdb_id": "84708", "wiki_id": "9618920"}, {"title": "Cattle Stampede", "genres": ["Western"], "wiki_plot": "Pursued through Arizona by a gang of outlaws turned bounty hunters for the massive reward on Billy's head, Billy and Fuzzy are led to safety by Ed Dawson.

Trudy's father Wentworth Harlan almost discovers Stan and Ollie when he returns home but finds Grant and angrily confronts him.

When Ollie declares that he has not got the money to the pay the rent, Stan suggests paying the rent with Ollie's nest-egg money. Although he initially refuses, Ollie eventually gives in and reluctantly decides to draw the money out of the bank. On their way to pay the rent, however, the boys become sidetracked by an auction that they are passing. In a situation reminiscent of Thicker Than Water, the boys keep bidding against each other for an antique grandfather clock, which they were merely initially wanting to purchase for a lady who had left her money at home.

The boys lay the clock down in the middle of the street while Stan retrieves his hat, but the clock is destroyed by a passing truck.\nBack home, Stan and Ollie decide to help Grant promote his invisible ray gun, by means of Stan posing as the inventor, an eccentric foreign scientist, and with Grant later revealing himself as the real inventor.

Grant is dismayed at the destruction of his invention, but the demonstration has earned him the approval and respect of Mr. Harlan.\nIn desperate need of money, Ollie decides to inflict a series of accidents upon Stan (using the fake insurance document) in hopes of raising money, but these events backfire and Ollie ends up receiving the intended consequence. Meanwhile, Mr. Harlan disapproves of his friend George Worthing (whom he had at first hoped to marry Trudy) attempting to steal Grant's invention and orders him to leave their home. He also decides to finance Grant's inventions following the demonstration of the invisible ray gun, much to the delight of Trudy and Grant.\nOllie decides to cause Stan to have another accident after hearing from a hospital patient who had gained insurance money after standing up on a roller-coaster and suffering an injury. Stan and Ollie board a bus to the beach, but the bus driver and passengers flee from the bus mid-journey after a cake-eating (and apparently rabid) dog frightens them away. Stan manages to escape from the bus just outside a coastal amusement park and pokes his head through a target in one of the amusement games.

The audience is told that as Hans grows up, he hears a distorted version of Sleeping Beauty depicting Hitler as the knightly prince character rescuing an obese Valkyrie representing Germany, from a wicked witch representing democracy. (The narrator sarcastically comments that \"the moral of this story seems to be that Hitler got Germany on her feet, climbed onto the saddle, and took her for a ride.\") Thanks to this kind of distorted children's story, Hans becomes fascinated with Hitler as he and the rest of the younger members of the Hitler Youth give the Hitler salute to a portrait of Hitler dressed as a knight.\n\nIn the following segment, the audience sees Hans sick and bedridden. His mother prays for him, knowing that it will only be a matter of time before the authorities come and take him away to a death camp. A Nazi officer bangs on the door to take Hans away, but his mother says he is sick and needs care. The officer orders her to heal her son quickly and have him ready to leave, implying that if Hans does not get well, he will be euthanized. He orders her not to do anything more to him that will cause him to lose heart and be weak, explaining that a soldier must show no emotion, mercy, or feelings whatsoever.\nHans eventually recovers and resumes his \"education\" in a school classroom, where Hans and the rest of his classmates, all in Hitlerjugend uniforms, give the Hitler salute to portraits of Hitler, Hermann Goering, and Joseph Goebbels. They then watch as the teacher draws a cartoon on the blackboard of a rabbit being eaten by a fox, prompting Hans to feel sorry for the rabbit. The teacher, furious over the remark, orders Hans to sit in the corner wearing a dunce cap, calling him \"Dummkopf\" (German for \"stupid\" or \"feeble-minded\") with his classmates laughing at him. As Hans sits in the corner, he hears the rest of the classmates \"correctly\" interpret the cartoon as \"weakness has no place in a soldier\" and \"the strong shall rule the weak\", as the teacher asked what does Hans think about the rabbit now, causing him to recant his remark and agree that the weak must be destroyed, much to the teacher's approval.\nHans then takes part in a book-burning crusade, burning any books with ideas opposed to Hitler's (Albert Einstein, Baruch Spinoza, and Voltaire), replacing the Bible with Mein Kampf and the crucifix with a Nazi sword.

At the end of the trip, he bumps into attractive fellow passenger Toni Donne.\nWhen Kit goes to the police to find out what they know, Inspector Tobin tells him Louie's death was an accident, but Kit knows better. After arranging to stay in the apartment of another friend, Ab Parker, he begins to make the acquaintance of the various guests at the party at which Louie made his fatal plunge. Among them are noted Norwegian historian and wheelchair-using refugee Dr. Christian Skaas; his nephew, Otto; Kit's old flame, Barby Taviton, who hosted the ill-fated party; and Toni Donne. Also present were singer Whitney Parker, who is Ab's cousin, and her piano-playing accompanist, Anton.

As he continues enjoying what he considers a hilarious joke, a little yellow humanoid wearing a large blue helmet with airplane wings scuttles by and begins striking the bomb's nose with a mallet, to the tune of \"I've Been Working on the Railroad.\" It takes Bugs a few seconds to realize the reality of the situation, but shortly he asks the gremlin, \"What's all the hub-bub, Bub?\"\nThe gremlin explains that the bomb must be hit \"just right\" in order to be made to explode, and gets back to work. Bugs steps in to suggest that perhaps he ought to \"take a whack at it\", and proceeds to wind up for a great, hard swing. He stops immediately before making contact, in the sudden realization that, thanks to the strange being, he is engaging in an insane activity. Bugs starts shouting at the creature, but it is apparently gone. Bugs then turns to the audience as he ponders whether he has just had an experience with a gremlin. The gremlin appears on Bugs' face and affirms its existence with a shout, \"It ain't Wendell Willkie!\" The gremlin, after that, tugs on Bugs' ears and hammers Bugs' foot with a monkey wrench and runs off.\nBugs gives chase and, from its perch on a plane's wing, the gremlin clobbers the rabbit with a monkey wrench, knocking him silly.  Bugs speaks nonsensically as Lennie Small, then as Baby Snooks. When he regains his senses, the now infuriated Bugs gives chase, wielding the monkey wrench and ending up inside a plane (which ironically resembles a Heinkel He-111). The gremlin grabs the wrench and bashes Bugs' foot with it. As Bugs reacts to the pain, the gremlin locks him in, sets the plane in motion and ultimately into the air. Bugs looks for the gremlin, and ends up getting kicked by it - reacting to the creature briefly laughing to the tune of \"Yankee Doodle\" when it appears at the door's window - is not aware that the plane is aloft until the gremlin opens the door as Bugs comes at it full-throttle, hoping to break it open. The rabbit finds himself in midair and, after turning into a jackass for a moment (as the \"You're a horse's ass\" motif is heard), he briefly demonstrates a heretofore-unseen ability to fly like a bird before racing through the open sky, back into the plane. Due to strategically placed banana skins, however, he slides out the door on the other side.\nThe gremlin, believing that his job is done, slams the door triumphantly, but opens it again when he notices it shaking. A terrified Bugs is plastered to it, with his heart pounding \"4F\" (Army code for drastically limiting medical condition, hospitalization required, and/or ineligible to be inducted via the draft). The gremlin pries him from the door; Bugs flies off but soon settles, curled up and flat, on the bomb bay doors - which, of course, the gremlin opens. Fortunately, Bugs' feet catch on a wire but, as he is hanging there, he sees that the gremlin is now steering the plane into a city and toward two skyscrapers. Bugs rushes into the cockpit, takes control of the airplane, rolls it vertically, and flies through an extremely narrow slot between the towers to avoid what seemed to be an inevitable impact.\nThe plane goes into a steep nosedive, its wings ripping off during its descent. Bugs is helpless, airsick and melting with terror. The gremlin nonchalantly plays with a yo-yo while awaiting impact. An impossibly short distance above the ground, the plane unexpectedly sputters to a halt and hangs in the air, defying gravity. Both Bugs and the gremlin casually address the audience.

So Pop make Marvin go to New York City in order to obtain a membership National Dairymen's Association for him.

An experienced dynamiter, Jordan is ordered to travel behind enemy lines and destroy a critical bridge with the aid of a band of local anti-fascist guerrillas. The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists.\n\nJordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love with one of the guerrillas, a young woman named Mar\u00eda. Mar\u00eda's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the Falangists (part of the fascist coalition) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger himself and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for Mar\u00eda. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate last stand, Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.\n\nHowever, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a rout. Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using hand grenades. Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.\nWhile the guerrilla fighters\u2014Pablo, Pilar, and Mar\u00eda\u2014create a diversion for Jordan and Anselmo, the two men plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of debris from the exploding bridge. While the guerrillas are escaping on horseback, Jordan is maimed when a fascist tank shoots his horse out from under him. Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed. He bids goodbye to Mar\u00eda and ensures that she escapes to safety with the surviving guerrillas.

Here Donald then faces and heils the portraits of Der Fuehrer (Hitler), the Emperor of Japan (Hirohito), and Il Duce (Mussolini) respectively, then goes to make breakfast.\nBecause of wartime rationing, Donald's breakfast consists of bread that is so stale and hard it resembles wood (and must be sliced using a saw), coffee brewed from a single hoarded coffee bean, and a bacon and egg-flavored breath spray. The band shoves a copy of Mein Kampf in front of him for a moment of reading, then marches into his house and escorts him to a factory, with Donald now carrying the bass drum and Goering kicking him.\n\nUpon arriving at the factory (at bayonet-point), Donald starts his comical 48-hour daily shift of screwing caps onto artillery shells coming at him in an assembly line. Mixed in with the shells are portraits of Der Fuehrer, so Donald must perform the Hitler salute every time a portrait appears, all the while screwing the caps onto shells, much to his disgust. Each new batch of shells is of a different size, ranging from individual bullets to massive shells as large as Donald (if not larger). The pace of the assembly line intensifies (as in the Charlie Chaplin comedy Modern Times), and Donald finds it increasingly hard to complete all the tasks. At the same time, he is bombarded with propaganda messages about the purported superiority of the Aryan race and the glory of working for Der Fuehrer.\nAfter a \"paid vacation\" that consists of making swastika shapes with his body for a few seconds in front of a painted backdrop of the Alps as exercise, Donald is ordered to work overtime.

Instead, Merriam successfully removes the sailor's appendix, but \u2013 feeling he should be loyal to the captain and spare him embarrassment \u2013 swears the radio operator to secrecy.

Moe suggests he simply gets some sleep, and in the morning the toothache will be gone.\nThe boys situate themselves for bed in a three-tiered bunk bed. Curly naturally receives the top bunk and his ascent thereto is not without mishap: faces are stepped on, and an attempt to alleviate Curly's pain using a hot water bottle ends in a soaking for Moe. When Curly does finally fall asleep, we are introduced into his dreams where his persistent moaning and complaining about his toothache aggravate the other two into action. His fear of dentists leaves the Stooges to improvise their own brand of home dentistry techniques. These techniques include trying to extract the tooth with a fishing pole and line, tying the tooth to the doorknob and violently closing it, tying the tooth to a ceiling light fixture and jumping from a ladder, and lastly, a firecracker.\nAs the dream sequence continues, Curly is taken by Moe to the dentist, Dr. Tug (Lew Davis). A terrified and belligerent Curly makes the check-up difficult. Exhausted from wrestling with Curly, Dr. Tug enters the adjoining office of his partner Dr. Yank (Bud Jamison) and asks him to complete the extraction. Meanwhile, Moe tries to placate Curly's fears by taking his place in the chair and simulating the procedure. Yank enters the office and\u2014believing Moe to be the patient\u2014knocks him out with ether in a rag and pulls his tooth, ignoring Curly's warnings. Yank hands the extracted tooth to Curly and, upon learning that Curly is the real patient, runs out of the room. Moe awakens and finds Curly holding the tooth. This understandably angers him to no end and he takes it out on Curly, who attempts to defend himself. This flailing action in the dream translates to similar action in his sleep, causing him to wake up and fall through the entire bunk bed, which collapses in a heap on top of his two sleeping compatriots. Enraged, Moe gives Curly a solid punch to the jaw. This dislodges the problem tooth and all is well. The boys fall asleep where they lie amongst the bed cushions and splintered wood.", "tmdb_plot": "The stooges are defense workers who have trouble getting to sleep when Curly gets a toothache.

Although she is not told much about the patient, Betsy looks forward to living in a warmer climate and accepts the job, laughing it off when asked if she believes in witchcraft.\nThe coachman who takes Betsy to Paul's house, Fort Holland, tells her the Afro-Caribbean population of Saint Sebastian is descended from slaves brought there by Paul's ancestors. At her first dinner, Betsy meets Paul's younger half-brother and employee, Wesley Rand, who, though good-humored, clearly resents Paul. She encounters Jessica, her patient, wandering the grounds of Fort Holland that night, and is initially frightened by the nonverbal, affectless woman, who, as Dr. Maxwell later informs Betsy, was left without the willpower to speak or act by herself after a tropical fever irreparably damaged her spinal cord.\nBetsy learns from a calypso musician's song that Paul kept Jessica from running away with Wesley right before she became sick. The issues surrounding Jessica have driven Wesley to drink, and the simmering tension between him and Paul frequently threatens to boil over. Paul apologizes to Betsy for bringing her to Saint Sebastian and admits he feels responsible for Jessica's condition. Betsy, who has fallen in love with Paul, becomes determined to make him happy by curing Jessica and gets him to agree to a risky insulin shock treatment. When that fails, Alma, Paul's maid, convinces Betsy that she should take Jessica to be healed by the houngan (Vodou priest) at the houmfort (Vodou temple).\nAfter a man dressed in black performs a ritual dance using a small sword, Betsy gets in line at the houmfort to ask the spirit Damballa to heal Jessica. Instead, she is pulled inside a hut and is shocked to see Mrs. Rand, Paul and Wesley's mother, who works with Maxwell. Mrs. Rand reveals that, with the houngan's knowledge, she has been telling the islanders that Vodou spirits speak through her so they will comply with her medical and sanitary recommendations. Meanwhile, Jessica attracts the attention of the man in black, who stabs her in the arm. She does not bleed, causing murmurs of \"zombie\" among the onlookers, and Mrs. Rand tells Betsy to take Jessica back to Fort Holland. An upset Paul greets them, but he softens when he learns Betsy was trying to help him and lets her know he no longer loves his wife.\nThe Voudou congregation demands Jessica be delivered to them for further ritualistic tests, so Maxwell and the local authorities want her sent to an asylum on a different island. Paul resists because Wesley wants Jessica to stay, and he tells Betsy to return to Canada before he makes her as unhappy as he made Jessica before her illness. At night, Carrefour, a zombie who guards a crossroads, is sent to retrieve Jessica, approaching Betsy instead after she puts on Jessica's robe, but Mrs. Rand orders him to leave.\nDr. Maxwell visits Fort Holland to report there will be an official investigation to determine Jessica's fate. Faced with scandal, and with her sons at each other's throats, Mrs. Rand says Jessica is not sick or insane, but dead, as she went to the houmfort the night Jessica tried to run away with Wesley and, possessed, asked the houngan to make Jessica a zombie. Only Wesley believes the story, and he later asks Betsy to euthanize Jessica, though Betsy refuses.\nUsing a small effigy of Jessica, the man in black and the houngan attempt to draw her to the houmfort. Paul and Betsy stop her the first time, but Wesley helps her the second, following with an arrow removed from a garden statue depicting Saint Sebastian that was once the figurehead of a Holland-family slave ship. When the man in black stabs the doll with a pin, Wesley stabs Jessica with the arrow and, pursued slowly by Carrefour, carries her body into the sea.

She has Gogo engage Banat in a poker game while Graham unsuccessfully searches Banat's cabin for the assassin's gun.\nWhen Graham returns to his own cabin, he is met by an armed Haller. Graham deduces that he is actually Muller, who offers to spare Graham's life by delaying his return to the US for six weeks by having him taken to a hospital with a case of \"typhus.\" Muller warns him that Kuvetli is a Turkish agent sent by Haki and warns Graham that he will be killed if he confides the plan to the Turk.\nKuvetli was eavesdropping from the next cabin, however, and informs Graham that Muller's \"plan\" is just a scheme to get Graham away from the ship before he murders him.

He asks the innkeeper if there is a cemetery adjoining the ruins of a nearby abbey and is disappointed when the answer is no. Then two shots ring out. The police arrive, looking for a little man carrying a coffin. The news frightens Brissot. While he is called to the telephone, his casket is stolen during a temporary blackout. Disconsolate, he gives in to the curiosity of the other guests and tells his story. A flashback ensues.\nBrissot is a struggling, untalented painter in Paris. He persuades Ir\u00e8ne, an attractive glove shop saleswoman, to pose for him. One night, frustrated with his lack of drive, she breaks up with him at a cafe. M\u00e9lisse, the chef, comes over and offers him a solution for all his woes: a talisman that will give him everything he wants, for the price of one sou (penny). Ange (Angel) warns him not to buy it, and the chef reveals that he must sell it at a loss before he dies or he will be condemned to Hell forever. The talisman turns out to be a severed left hand, which amazingly obeys the chef's commands. Despite all this, Brissot does not believe the supernatural aspects and buys it. As soon as the bargain is concluded, the chef loses his left hand.\nThe talisman works. Exactly one year later, Brissot has a wildly successful exhibition at Galerie Gabelin and is married to Ir\u00e8ne. For some reason he himself does not understand, he paints with his left hand only and signs his works \"Maximus Leo\". At the exhibition, he spots a little man he has seen before. He chases after him, but then notices in a florist shop window a wreath with the sash that says \"In Memoriam Maximus Leo\". Inside, he learns that a little man ordered it. Later the little man comes to his office and admits Brissot has \"the Devil to pay\". Even though Brissot cannot sell the hand at a loss, the little man offers to buy it back for a sou. Brissot accepts, but then takes it back after Ir\u00e8ne is cold to him. The little man tells him that his offer still holds, but the price doubles every day. Brissot dithers until the 23rd day, but when he tries to pay the current price, he does not have quite enough money. Later, Ir\u00e8ne telephones, telling him she has the money he needs, but is murdered before he can get to her. Ange tells him to try a roulette system at the casino in Monte Carlo, but the little man shows up, and his lucky streak ends just before he can win the sum he needs.\nWhen he returns to his hotel, he is met by all the previous owners of the hand: a royal musketeer, a cutpurse, a juggler, an illusionist, a surgeon, his assistant (who became a boxer), and finally the chef. They tell him their tales. The little man appears, followed by the man to whom the hand belongs. Maximus Leo was born in 1422. His hand was supremely gifted, but he chose to become a monk. The little man was only able to obtain the hand by stealing it from the monk's tomb. Therefore, as Maximus Leo states, all the bargains are invalid, since the little man cannot sell what does not rightfully belong to him. After the defeated little man leaves, Maximus Leo asks Brissot to return the hand to his tomb.\nReturning to the present, Brissot spots the little man outside and gives chase. They fight atop the ruins of the abbey, and Brissot is sent tumbling to his death. He lands on top of a tomb.

Later, he renames his gambling ship the \"Briny Marlin\" (darling) in her honor.\nOn the day of the charity ball, Joe receives a letter addressed to Bascopoulos. Curious, he takes it to a Greek Orthodox priest for translation. It turns out to be from Bascopoulos's mother in Axis-occupied Greece. She wrote to tell her son that when German paratroopers landed nearby, under his brothers' leadership every man in their village fought to the death. Moved, Joe reexamines his life.\nAt the ball, Joe's men use false bottoms in the cashboxes to steal most of the money. Joe has a change of heart and tells his right-hand man, the \"Crunk\", that the money is going to war relief. But Zepp overhears and forces him at gunpoint to collect the loot. Dorothy accidentally catches them in the act and thinks Joe is a willing participant. To protect her, he is forced to knock her out. Then, the two men start collecting the money. When Zepp briefly looks away, Joe attacks and kills him, but not before getting shot. Joe escapes, leaving behind a trail of blood. Then, he sends the money back to Dorothy via his trusted friend Swede. He loads his ship with the charity's supplies.\nLater, Dorothy is stricken when a policeman informs her Bascopoulos is dead. Then she sees the photograph of the man; it is not her Joe. When the name of the ship Bascopoulos worked on is mentioned, she rushes to the dock, just as the ship is leaving for Europe. She begs Joe to take her with him, but he tells her she deserves better and turns away to hide his own anguish. The ship is torpedoed and sunk on the return trip. Dorothy visits the pier each night.\nThe flashback ends. Hoping Dorothy would be present, Swede arranged for Joe to meet him there. When Joe shows up at the other end of the pier, he wants to go out on the town to celebrate their last night in port rather than going back to their ship.

However, despite Hitler's insistence that they shouldn't be told and Goebbels' efforts to mislead them, his Axis partners Benito Mussolini of Italy and General Suki Yaki of Japan unsolicitedly appear at the submarine dock and invite themselves to the trip.\nAt the same time an American supply ship has just been sunk by a German U-boat, although the crew under their skipper, Captain Spense, escape in a lifeboat. They incidentally land on Norom, where they discover the High Chief's camp, and as Seaman Benson does some reconnaissance, he meets Kela, the young female assistant to an alcoholic magician, who tells him that her master was hired by Paj Mub for an exclusive performance in honor of Hitler's upcoming reception. Benson spontaneously hits upon the plan to impersonate the magician and sneaks into the camp, where Kela instructs him in the use of the magician's props. At the same time, Spense and the rest of his men witness Hitler arriving and disembarking at the island (although they do not recognize him from the distance), and decide to investigate.\nForewarned by Popoff not to displease the High Chief (lest they would surely not only lose the chance to this contract, but perhaps also their heads), Hitler and his partners meet Paj Mub, who invites them to dinner before he will sign the treaty. However, Benson does his best to ruin the meeting: first, by spiking the served soup with pepper (this results in Hitler and Suki Yaki finding it unpalatable, while Mussolini thinks it bland), then switching the guests' wine with kerosene. Benson as the magician is then brought in and demonstrates the magic trunk illusion, switching Kela for himself. The Paj Mub likes it and insists that one of the three Axis partners go into the box next. Hitler refuses on the grounds that he likes his appearance, and Mussolini begs off due to his girth, so Suki Yaki goes into the trunk. There, he accidentally gets knocked unconscious by Kela, who is trying to fend off an orang-utan who discovered the tunnel under the trunk. Because of this, the ape takes Kela's intended place in the trick, greatly amusing the Paj Mub. He agrees to sign the contract, but as \"Suki Yaki\" is supposed to sign before the High Chief, the ape squirts Hitler and Mussolini with ink, prompting Paj Mub to consider signing the treaty the next morning and sticking the ape in the same tent as his foreign guests for the night.\nAs the festivities take place, Spense and his men capture the submarine which brought the Axis leaders to Norom. While investigating the High Chief's camp soon afterwards, Spense runs into Benson, who reveals to him the presence of the three most important Axis leaders on this island. Carrying on his plan, Benson wakes Suki Yaki from his unconsciousness and, with the general's help, manages to convince Hitler and Mussolini that Paj Mub intends to betray them. After making it back to the submarine, Hitler demonstrates his gratitude to Benson by punching him off the vessel, but he is surreptitiously pulled out of the water by his crewmates, who keep themselves hidden from the Axis leaders as they enter the boat for the return journey.\nAs the submarine is underway, the radio operator receives a message that an Allied refugee ship was torpedoed and its passengers massacred, lifting Hitler's mood. Enraged, Benson attempts to teach Hitler a hard lesson, but Spense prevents him from doing so, citing the Geneva Convention's clause of prisoner of war treatment. Benson relents from employing force, but then locks Hitler's cabin door and falsely announces through the intercom that the submarine is sinking, sending the Axis leaders into hysterics for a while, before he cheerfully reveals the Americans' presence on the boat.\nPopoff has in the meantime gone mad from Hitler's promise of getting shot for his supposed failure with Paj Mub. He smashes the sub's navigation instruments when he is left unattended, leaving the sailors blind in the sea. The sub runs aground, nose in the air, at the shore of a tropical island. Thinking that the sub is trapped underwater, the desperate Axis leaders decide to have themselves shot to the surface via the torpedo tubes.

Assigned to cover the testing of this new machine, Katherine returns to the tunnel and is shocked to learn that the inventor is Ryan. She sneaks into the testing area and finds a good vantage point, while Ryan and the sandhogs start up the machine and remove some planks holding back the muck. At first the test appears to fail, but as Katherine takes several photographs, the chemical reaction begins to solidify the muck.

Millie has married Preston Drake and is pregnant, and she surprises Kit when she discloses she has also written a book, a romance novel. Millie asks Kit to present her book to her publisher. Upon their meeting, Preston appears to be impressed by Kit Marlowe.\nEight years pass, and Millie has become increasingly difficult and resentful of any diversion from full attention being focused upon herself. When Kit jokes and glowingly reports about her shopping trip with Preston and Millie's only child, Deirdre, Millie impudently retorts \"Time you had one of your own!\" as she swans out.\nPreston immediately asks Kit why she has remained so loyal to Millie over the years. Kit confides in Preston despite Millie's often emotionally unstable and dysfunctional behavior, she feels indebted as Millie was her first real friend. Kit feels a particular loyalty to Millie as orphaned Kit grew up with an aunt who died and found a sense of home and family through Millie's parents' kindness and generosity towards Kit.\nMillie has become a very successful writer, with a string of romance novels. This has made her very arrogant and condescending to those around her. Visiting New York, on the eve of the opening of a play written by Kit, the Drakes' marriage is slowly disintegrating. In an interview with a reporter, Preston, an architect and engineer, is shown to feel secondary to his wife\u2019s success. In a private moment with Kit, when Millie mentions Preston\u2019s drinking habit, Kit replies \u201cpeople drink for escape,\u201d but Millie does not seem to appreciate Kit\u2019s point. In a private moment between Preston and Kit, he professes his love for her. Millie and Preston clash with Kit playing referee.

Dr. John Watson, who is in charge of the medical facility, goes to fetch his dear friend Sherlock Holmes to bring some clarity to the case of the attack.\nUpon his arrival at the estate, Sherlock Holmes discovers the dead body of one of the brothers, Geoffrey. Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard is put on the case to solve the murder, and immediately arrests the American captain as a suspect.\nHolmes is of another opinion about the flyer's guilt and continues to investigate on his own.  Phillip is formally made the new head of the estate the next day with the aid of his sister. But after only one day of running the estate, Phillip, too, is found murdered, lying in the trunk of the car.\nLestrade suspects the family butler, Alfred Brunton, to be the murderer because Phillip had just fired the butler. Trying to arrest the butler, Lestrade gets lost in the manor's secret passageways. Meanwhile, Holmes and Watson look into the special \"Musgrave Ritual\" that the family uses to appoint the new head of the family. They find the words used in the ritual hidden in Sally's room and try to copy the ritual, which involves replaying a giant chess game on the checkered floor of the house main hall. As pieces in the game they use the household staff.\nThe game gives them clues to the family's secret burial crypt underneath the house, and there they find Brunton murdered, clutching a case containing an old document. Holmes examines the body for clues and sets a trap for the murderer. After the others have retired for the day, Holmes sneaks back into the crypt and waits for the murderer to reappear. Before long, Sexton appears, where Holmes confronts him with the evidence that he has found and observed throughout the investigation. Sexton, however, manages to overpower Holmes and takes his revolver. Then Sexton confesses that he indeed is the one responsible for the murders. He shoots at Holmes with what turn out to be blank cartridges. When Sexton emerges from the crypt, Lestrade and Watson are there waiting to arrest him.\nExplaining the meaning of the document found in the crypt to Sally, Holmes suggests that Sexton had discovered an old land grant that entitled the Musgraves to a fortune of millions of pounds, and had hatched a deadly scheme to gain it for himself. The devious doctor had killed both brothers, making Sally heir to the money, and then sought to claim her as his bride by framing her sweetheart, Vickey, for the slayings. Learning of this, Sally destroys the document that would have made her rich, not wanting to profit at the cost of others' lives.Driving away with Watson, Holmes muses on Sally's selfless act:\n\nThere\u2019s a new spirit abroad in the land.

That afternoon, while fetching firewood with her sister Marie and a friend, Bernadette waits for them in the Massabielle grotto. Distracted by a strange breeze and a change in the light, Bernadette sees a beautiful lady clad in white, standing on a rock niche. Bernadette tells her companions what she saw, and they promise not to tell anyone else. However, Marie tells their mother when they return home, and the story soon spreads all over Lourdes.\nMany, including Bernadette's Aunt Bernarde, are convinced of her sincerity, standing up for her against her disbelieving parents.

On one visit, the lady asks Bernadette to drink and wash at a seemingly nonexistent spring. Bernadette obediently digs a hole in the ground and smears her face with dirt.

Bernadette undergoes rigorous spiritual training and works hard at the convent; but is also subjected to emotional abuse from Sister Vauzou, now mistress of novices at the convent. Vauzou tells Bernadette that doubt consumes her, and that she cannot believe that Bernadette, who has never suffered, would be chosen by God when she has spent her life suffering in his service. \nThough Bernadette agrees that she has not suffered, she then reveals a tumor hidden under the skirt of her habit, much to Vauzou\u2019s horror.

Louise decides to volunteer for the factory work, and with the help of Bert, she will be discovered by Cartwright.\nLouise and Emma begin their new stints as aircraft riveters while being entertained during their meal breaks by various talents, including American singer Gertrude Niesen and the Hot Shots.

He alone knows she can break the speed record and receive the Blue Riband, and he believes this will raise the stock's value. Ismay and the board of the White Star Line plan to manipulate the stock by selling short their own stock in order to buy it back at a lower price just before the news about the ship's record speed is revealed to the press.\nOn Titanic's maiden voyage in April 1912, First Officer Petersen (Hans Nielsen), the sole German crew member on board, begs the arrogant Bruce Ismay to slow the ship while sailing through ice-infested North Atlantic waters, but Ismay refuses and pressures the weak-willed Captain Smith (Otto Wernicke) to keep up the vessel's record-breaking speed. Because of Ismay's recklessness, Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink. The passengers in First Class act like cowards, while Petersen, his Russian aristocrat ex-lover Sigrid Olinsky (Sybille Schmitz), and several German passengers in steerage behave bravely and with dignity. With Sigrid's assistance, Petersen manages to rescue many passengers before convincing her to board one of the last lifeboats.

Laramore ensures there is a pillow waiting to cushion Daffy's landing. Daffy then gives the dog a lesson in how to retrieve a duck while calling him \"Rover\", but later opens the dog's mouth to climb into and play dead. When Laramore takes the duck to Elmer, Elmer apologizes for shooting him, explaining that he had to \"pwug\" Daffy because he is \"a gweat spoowtsman\". An indignant Daffy sits up and heatedly retorts that Elmer doesn't know the meaning of fair play (\"What chance has a poor little fluffy winged creature like me against a well-equipped hunter like you?!\") and adds that Elmer wouldn't be so tough without various accoutrements, including his big shotgun, knife and even his hunter's apparel - which Daffy actually removes from Elmer. He finishes his tirade asking what protection he has got (\"A bullet-proof vest, I suppose!\") and inadvertently opens his feathered chest to reveal one (\"How did that get there?\"). Subsequently, he challenges Elmer to a \"fair\" fight.\nIntimidatingly, Daffy maneuvers Elmer into a boxing ring which is surrounded by many duck spectators. The burly referee of the fight is also a duck, named Ducky Wheeze. He struggles to stop laughing at pathetic Elmer long enough to introduce him; when he finally does, Elmer stands up and meekly says, \"Hewwo\". The crowd boos overwhelmingly; only Laramore, from separate and otherwise empty bleachers, cheers; he is immediately knocked over by various objects thrown at him from the crowd.\nThe referee gives Daffy \"Good to His Mother\" Duck a resounding, loving introduction. The duck spectators cheer wildly; Laramore, back in his spot in the separate and otherwise empty bleachers, boos; he is again knocked over by thrown objects.\nBefore the match starts, the referee exhorts the two opponents to \"fight clean\", turning to wink at the duck spectators who, knowing what is coming, collectively shout, \"Oh, brother!\" The referee then calls \"no rough stuff -- none of THIS! Or THIS! Or like SO!\", each time demonstrating an illegal move on Elmer and knocking him silly. Daffy, in turn, picks up where the referee left off, asking, \"You mean none of THIS?

Each segment features a separate story supposedly praising Japanese life and the war effort. In reality, each segment contains satirical content, often racist satirical content, to depict the Japanese and their Axis allies as incompetent, pathetic, self-destructive failures.The cartoon opens with an unseen narrator announcing that footage of Japan has been released to the public. The footage starts with a rooster that is a parody of Path\u00e9 with the opening of the Defile March playing in the background. The \"rooster\" attempts to crow, but it is revealed that it is actually a vulture in a costume. The vulture has glasses and buck teeth, and is seen rubbing its wings together and saying \"Oh, cock-a-doo-doo-doo, prease\", all stereotypical traits to show that the vulture is Japanese.\nThe first segment is \"Civilian Defense\", and the voiceover presents the Japanese air raid siren system. This \"system\" is two Japanese men who take turns poking each other's buttocks with a giant needle (a reference to the obscene Japanese gesture kancho) and screaming in pain. A listening post is also shown in the following scene, showing a small Japanese man walking around a pole covered in keyholes. There is also an \"aircraft spotter\", and another Japanese man is literally painting spots on a plane. The narrator turns to show the fire prevention headquarters, but it was already burned down.\n\"Incendiary Bombs\" gives a lesson on bombs, with text stating that one should not approach them for the first five seconds. A small Japanese man with an umbrella walks onto the screen and reads the text, so he looks at his watch (the watch is covered with swastikas) and counts for six seconds before cooking a sausage over the bomb with his umbrella. The bomb explodes and the man is blasted into a hole in the ground. The man, however, survives and climbs out of the hole, then makes a comment about losing face - having literally lost his face, despite his glasses and hat remaining in place.\nIn \"Kitchen Hints\", Hideki Tojo is shown as a cook. He gives instructions for making a Japanese club sandwich out of ration cards. He then proceeds to eat the \"sandwich\" and hits himself in the head with an actual club. Tojo now has a large lump on his head, and he is playing with his lips.\nThe next segment is \"Nippon-Nifties Style Show\", and the narrator presents a \"Japanese Victory Suit\". The narrator states that the suit has no cuffs, no pleats, and no lapel. This actually means there is no suit, and a small, almost-naked Japanese man wearing a diaper is shivering in the snow and trying to warm himself with a small candle.\nThe scene switches to a sports announcer, a Japanese man named Red Toga-San (whose name is a pun on sports journalists Red Barber and Stan Thorgerson), talking out of a hole around a black background. As he is making an announcement, the hole closes on his lips, which then fall to the ground and are revealed to be false teeth with the label \"Made in Japan\". The Japanese \"King of Swat\" (a reference to Babe Ruth's nickname as the Sultan of Swat) is shown in the next scene, wearing a baseball outfit next to a trophy that is identical to his head in shape. A fly then appears onscreen, and the \"King of Swat\" attempts to swat it while spinning around. The fly grabs the flyswatter from the \"King of Swat\" and hits him with it, then flies away with the trophy.\n\"Headline Poisonalities\" shows some personalities that made the headline that week. Isoroku Yamamoto is seen standing behind a desk and introduces himself as he walks on stilts to look taller. He states that he \"will dictate peace terms in the White House\". An editor's note covers the screen, telling the audience that the room in the next scene is reserved for Yamamoto. When the card is removed, there is an opened door and inside the room is an electric chair, and Chopin's Marche fun\u00e8bre is quoted.\nThe scene fades and the narrator explains how General Homma demonstrates \"Japanese coolness and calmness during air raid attacks\". However, this statement is ironic since Homma is shown running around in a forest and bumping into trees. Homma then panics and runs inside a hollow log. Homma sticks his head out of the log, panting. A skunk also comes out of the log and sniffs Homma in disgust, so it ducks back into the log and reappears with a gas mask.\n\"Flashes from the Axis\" shows news from outside Japan. From Berlin, a caricature of Lord Haw-Haw appears as a donkey named \"Lord Hee Haw\" ('Chief Wind-Bag'). He brays loudly before reading from his papers, saying that \"the F\u00fchrer has just received a postcard from a friend vacationing abroad\". Next a hand is seen holding a post-card, and the song O du lieber Augustin (due to the association with Germany) plays. It is flipped over, the other side has an image of Rudolf Hess in a concentration camp. The next scene shows that the other hand is that of Adolf Hitler who then twitches his mustache in confusion (in a similar manner to Charlie Chaplin).\nFrom Rome, the \"celebrated\" Roman ruins are shown as Largo al factotum is quoted (hence the association with Italy).  Each of the ruins are numbered with signs. Benito Mussolini is sitting on the pillar labelled as \"Ruin #1\" as he plays with a yo-yo with a sad expression on his face.\nThe next segment focuses on the \"Japanese Navy...all at sea\" and focuses on the achievements. A submarine appears, and the narrator says that it had launched three weeks ahead of schedule. However, this was apparently done prior to its completion, as workers are still building it as it moves underwater. A small Japanese man runs onscreen and tries to stop the submarine, but it crashes and he stops running and takes his hat off as \"Taps\" plays in the background. He then shrugs and walks in the opposite direction. A group of Japanese sailors are then seen using what the narrator calls \"intricate and technical machinery\", but are actually various arcade machines. The song that briefly plays in the background is Nagasaki.\nThe narrator then introduces a \"happy gentleman\" riding inside a human torpedo. The narrator then asks him if he has anything to say, and he responds with \"No uh, nothing, except...RET ME OUTTA HERE!\", apparently stuck inside the torpedo.\nThe final segment shows literal interpretations of boats and planes. A plane is shot in the air with what is stated to be a \"super-duper cataproat device\" but is in fact just a giant slingshot, or \"catapult\". Another plane has tricycle landing gear, made up of a tricycle with a small Japanese man riding on it. The aircraft carrier Skinomaru passes by, haphazardly carrying the wrecks of crashed airplanes. Finally, a navy minesweeper with arms floats by, and is literally sweeping away mines with a broom.

Cecil is not the least bit fooled by the disguise, but goes along with the gag, claiming that his streamlined shell ensures his success; he produces a set of blueprints for his \"air-flow chassis.\" He also adds that, in contrast, the long ears of a rabbit only serve as \"wind resistance\", which slows the rabbit down.

His general store partner, Lum Edwards, quickly involves himself in the business by appointing himself president. Lum comes up with the idea of selling some of the stock to the town's inhabitants, thus getting money to buy the land on which the railway is built and its surroundings.\nAbner agrees with the plan and they raise nearly $10,000 from selling stock. The money is enough to buy the land and to go to Chicago, where Uncle Ernest's attorney, J.J. Stark, keeps his office. Upon their arrival they find that it is a broken down local railroad that coincidentally is abbreviated C&O. The assets aren't worth more than $200, and the rail and cars are hopelessly worn down. They send a telegram to Pine Ridge saying don't buy the land, but it arrives too late. The land has already been purchased.\nHaving invested every last penny in the business, the two partners leave the attorney's office in despair. On top of this, Abner trips in the stairs down from the office and falls hard to the ground. The building manager insists he should see a doctor. After a case of mistaken identities at the doctor's office, Abner receives notice that he is dying and only has two weeks left to live.\nBack in the hotel when they are in their room, a window-washer named Gimpel walks in through the window with his imaginary dog. The man suggests Abner starts taking high-risk jobs to make money. Since he will die soon anyway, he has nothing to lose.\nThe first job that appears is as tester of a new drug that a scientist has concocted. The drug is supposed to have a personality-changing effect. The next is as a death-defying gorilla dancer. Then he is offered $1000 to sleep one night in a supposedly haunted house, which he refuses, being too afraid of the dark. He performs a dangerous daredevil stunt, climbing from one airplane to another while they are up in the air. However, it turns out the man who hired Abner for the stunt disappears with the $5,000 payment, and they have to start all over again.\nGimpel comes with another suggestion, that they should sue the building for not having kept the stairs safe enough. They decide to do so, and appoint Lum as Abner's legal representative. He doesn't perform very well, since he mistakes the building manager's settlement offer as $10 instead of $10,000, and in the end only manages to settle for a reimbursement sum of $65.\nSoon a representative of the stock buyers, Elmer Keaton, come to the hotel to demand their money back, since they have found out the stock is practically worthless. Lum convinces Abner to spend the night at the haunted house to make some money. Both men are unaware of that the woman, Mrs. Carmen, who offered Abner the job, plans to blow the house up, and claim that the dead and scorched body found in the ruins, is her husband, so she can get the money from his life insurance policy.\nMrs. Carmen gives Abner a violin case and a good luck charm before sending off to the haunted house.

Joe tricks him into coming outside by pretending to see a beautiful woman. The Durante Vulture comes out and Joe hits him on the head and then covers him with butter before Joe gets up and runs. The two vultures chase after each other until The Durante Vulture pretends to be a rattlesnake which causes Joe to faint. However immediately afterwards, the Durante Vulture sees a real one and faints himself.\nThe Durante Vulture later paints a rock to look like a steak and calls Joe over to eat it. Joe eats it perfectly as if it were a real steak. The Durante Vulture tries to do the same only to break his teeth. The vultures get in a scuffle that turns into a whirlwind. Joe escapes and pulls a pot under Durante Vulture only to notice that he has disappeared. The Durante Vulture is revealed to have put a broiling pan under Joe, which he slams a lid on, puts in an oven and locks the oven shut. The Durante Vulture sits on top of the stove which is revealed to be a conveyor belt to a meat slicer. The Durante Vulture barely escapes being sliced and runs into a hole, and Joe uses a pickaxe to get to him. The Durante Vulture pops up from another hole behind him and while trying to decapitate Joe proceeds to chop the cactus. The Durante Vulture grows tired and surrenders. He goes over to have himself beheaded and Joe almost does, but the Durante Vulture runs after Joe with the butcher knife.\nThe vultures chase each other with various weapons around a rock until the Durante Vulture notices that the rabbit has returned. They capture the rabbit and fight over him only for the rabbit to break it up and asks if they know what day it is as he shows them the calendar date that says \"Meatless Tuesday\". Having realized they fought over the rabbit for nothing, the vultures bawl hysterically.\nBefore the cartoon can end, a \"Patrons Attention\" title card appears as the announcer (voiced by John Wald) quotes the following:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, your attention please.

British forces are vastly outnumbered, but the British people are calm. The narrator explains that is because in a democracy, the people as a whole are involved in the decision to fight. Hitler's masterplan to subjugate Britain is described. Hitler begins by attacking convoys and ports but fails to destroy them. The RAF is outnumbered \"6 - 8 - 10 to one\" but knocks out far more planes than the Germans do. Also, bailed-out British pilots can return to the air, but German pilots are lost. Unlike the Dutch and Polish Air Forces, Britain does not \"make the mistake of bunching its planes on the runways.\"\nLosses force Hitler to \"take time out.\" He tells Goering to change tactics and so the Luftwaffe attacks factories. Britain deploys \"improved listening posts\" to identify the coming attacks. In August and September, German losses are far more severe. However, the \"German mind\" cannot understand why \"free people fight on against overwhelming odds.\" The Germans' now aim to \"crush the British spirit\" by attacking London and destroying homes, hospitals and churches, but the people adapt and survive. Enraged, Goering takes personal command and sends massive attack on September 15, to which the British respond with \"everything they had.\" In the battle, the Germans suffer severe losses.\nDespite many losses and the destruction of historic buildings, the Germans cannot break Britain. They switch to night attacks in the hope of terrorizing the people to make them \"cry for mercy\" and die of begging, but the people show great resilience. The British also counterattack and bomb key German factories.\nHitler takes revenge by destroying Coventry. After a brief respite at Christmas Hitler sends firebombs to London to create \"the greatest fire in recorded history.\" More bombings and firestorms are created, but Britain's defences hold up and give a year of precious time to other countries threatened by Germany. The film ends with Winston Churchill's statement: \"never in the field of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few.\"", "tmdb_plot": "The fourth of Frank Capra's Why We Fight series of seven propaganda films, which made the case for fighting and winning the Second World War.
