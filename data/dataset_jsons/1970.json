Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife, Cindy. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, TGA customer relations agent Tanya Livingston.\nVernon Demerest is a TGA captain scheduled to be the checkride captain for the airline to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during TGA Flight 2 to Rome. TGA's flagship international service, named The Golden Argosy, is being operated with a Boeing 707. Although Demerest is married to Bakersfeld's sister, Sarah, he is secretly having an affair with Gwen Meighen, chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child.\nBakersfeld borrows TWA mechanic Joe Patroni to assist with moving TGA's disabled plane blocking Runway 29. Bakersfeld and Tanya also deal with Ada Quonsett, an elderly widow from San Diego who is a habitual stowaway on various airlines.\nDemolition expert D.O. Guerrero, down on his luck and with a history of mental illness, buys both a one-way TGA ticket aboard TGA Flight 2 and a large life insurance policy with the intent of committing suicide by blowing up the plane. He plans to set off a bomb in an attach\u00e9 case while over the Atlantic Ocean so that his wife, Inez, will collect the insurance money of $225,000 ($1.57 million in 2021). His erratic behavior at the airport, including using his last cash to buy the insurance policy and mistaking a U.S. Customs officer for an airline gate agent, attracts airport officials' attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs airport officials that he had been fired from a construction job for \"misplacing\" explosives and that the family's financial situation is dire.\nAda Quonsett manages to evade the TGA employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to Los Angeles. Enchanted by the idea of a trip to Rome, she talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2, and happens to sit next to Guerrero. When Flight 2's crew is made aware of Guerrero's presence and possible intentions, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once Ada is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew to get to Guerrero's briefcase, but the ploy fails when a troublesome passenger interferes and returns the case to Guerrero.\nDemerest goes back into the passenger cabin and tries to persuade Guerrero not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy has been nullified. Guerrero briefly moves to give Demerest the bomb, but just then another passenger exits the lavatory at the rear of the aircraft, and the same troublesome passenger yells out that Guerrero has a bomb. Guerrero runs into the lavatory and sets off the bomb, dying instantly and blowing a three-foot hole in the fuselage. Gwen, just outside the door, is injured in the explosion and subsequent explosive decompression, but the pilots retain control of the airplane.\nWith all airports east of Chicago unusable due to bad weather, Flight 2 returns to Lincoln for an emergency landing. Due to the bomb damage, Demerest demands the airport's longest runway, Runway 29, which is still closed due to the stuck airliner. Bakersfeld orders the plane to be pushed off the runway by snowplows, despite the costly damage they would do to it. Patroni, who is \"taxi-qualified\" on 707s, has been trying to move the stuck aircraft in time for Demerest's damaged aircraft to land. By exceeding the 707's engine operating parameters, Patroni frees the stuck jet without damage, allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled TGA Flight 2 to land.\nAs the shaken passengers exit the plane, a hysterical Inez searches in vain for her dead husband. Demerest's wife sees him accompanying Gwen's stretcher as he says he'll go with her to the hospital.

The story unfolds around a group of four friends, who despite their differences, bonded deeply. The four friends are all educated and come from different layers of society, but the urge to escape from the daily grind of city life forces them to wander in tribal lands.\nOf the four friends, Asim, the leader of the pack, owns the car they drive in, has a cushy job, likes the company of girls and yet is very conscious of how he should be perceived by them. Sanjoy is a labour executive but would ideally want to immerse himself in literature.  Hari, a frank and straightforward cricketer, wants to forget the girl who dumped him. Shekhar is the jester, the only one without a job. He has a roving eye but stays sober when his friends get drunk and vent their frustrations.\nThey set out for the tribal Palamau, in Bihar. They had read legends about this land, the tribal women who are open, simple and beautiful.  Wanting to break rules, they forcefully stay at a forest rest house by bribing the chowkidar.

At night the four friends go to drink alcohol again in the country liquor house. Hari is upset because he cannot see Duli whom he had met previous night. While returning to their rest house, they stumble upon a car which they shout at without realising it is that of Aparna and Jaya. They oversleep and miss the next day's breakfast at Jaya's place. They find a tiffin outside their rooms and go to Aparna's house to return it. Later, the conservator visits the forest rest house and catches them staying at the Forest Bungalow without permission. When they are about to be kicked out, Aparna, the conservator's acquaintance, manages the situation with her natural grace and composure. The group decides to chat and play a game while Aparna's father is away with Jaya's son.

Shekhar goes off to gamble with money borrowed from Asim. Hari takes Duli into the forest and has sex with her. Asim feels his pride and self-confidence shattered when Aparna reveals her more vulnerable side that lies behind her composed exterior.

Amid these conditions, 30-year-old Kensaku Gunji becomes the 4th head of the Hamayasu family operating in a small corner of the Port of Yokohama as a replacement for the acting head Tetsuji Kuroki, who is in prison.\nThe Hamayasu member Onuma is arrested under the Port Labor Act and shipping work comes to a standstill. Onuma's wife asks for help but it is Onuma's third arrest and it will be difficult. Iwakiri, the head of his own organization, asks whether Gunji wishes to get out of the shipping business and suggests grabbing part of the warehousing rights to a huge new factory complex of Oriental Heavy Industries. To do so, Gunji will have to clear out the people living in slums on the land where the factory complex will be built. Gunji refuses to clear out the slums where he was raised but is told that if he does not, the Daimon organization from Tokyo will do it. Gunji agrees but asks Kasama Tsutomu to resign so that Kasama will not have to evict the elderly from the slum where his parents live. Kasama refuses to quit and pledges to take charge of the eviction.\nWhen Gunji attempts to talk with the people living in the slum, they become agitated and throw various objects, including a dead cat, at the Hamayasu. Kasama's father angrily criticizes him for joining the yakuza and now evicting them and his mother screams that she should have killed him at birth. A fistfight ensues but the Hamayasu are stopped by Hayami, an old friend of Gunji who abandoned the slum 12 years earlier to become a boxer but has now returned to defend it, taking refuge in a small boat dubbed the SS Black Dragon. Hayami is visited by Joe, a promising rookie boxer whose eye was injured in his last match but who escaped from the hospital because he could not afford to have his eye fixed. Hayami refuses to allow Joe to quit boxing and become a hustler, instead promising to get Joe the operation he needs so that Joe can live out the dreams Hayami lost when he himself had an eye injury.\nThe next morning the Hamayasu and Iwakiri gangs arrive together to destroy the livestock held in the slum and attack its inhabitants. Unable to go to the police due to their illegal squatting on the land, they barricade themselves inside the slum, which gives them defense but cuts them off from income. Three miners from Kyushu arrive in an attempt to pass themselves off as inhabitants of the slum and thereby collect the payment for leaving offered by Daimon Construction.\nTetsuji Kuroki is released from prison and returns to the Hamayasu. He visits a former lover who is now working as a waitress in a bar. She confesses that she has waited five years for him but he is resistant to letting her get involved with him again.\nHayama accepts money from the Daimon organization and allows them into the slum to pressure one of the families into selling by force. The next morning Kasama, Ozaki, and other members of the Hamayasu see Daimon soldiers arriving at the slum and attempt to stop them but are shown the deed of sale and beaten up after resisting. Gunji receives a letter or resignation from Kasama with his severed pinky finger in it as an apology. Kasama invades the Daimon Construction office to kill their boss Daimon himself but when he is captured he commits suicide by biting off his own tongue. The brutal bespectacled Daimon enforcer Katagiri tells Gunji to come alone to collect Kasama. Gunji shows them the letter and pinky to prove that Kasama acted on his own during the attack. The Daimon demand a 50% share of the warehousing rights to overlook the attack just as Kuroki arrives and fights them off, telling them that there will be blood spilled if they do not stop. Kasama's parents later come to collect the body from a tearful Gunji. The next morning their bodies are found hanging in their home after an apparent suicide. Two of the Kyushu miners flee out of fear but their leader, who is actually from Tokyo, remains in order to fight the yakuza.\nJoe figures out that Hayami is collaborating with the Daimon and asks him to stop but Hayami refuses because he still needs more money for Joe's operation. Iwakiri visits the Daimon Construction office and offers to split the warehousing rights 50/50. Daimon soldiers kill the remaining miner and run over Joe with their cars during the escape, killing him. Hayami holds Joe as he dies and the other two miners return and cry over the body of their fallen friend. Hayami enters the Daimon Construction office and accuses them of the attack but they deny it. Hayami returns the money he has received and tells them that the deal is off.\nThe Daimon organization leads the slum dwellers to believe that the attack was by the Hamayasu and the slum dwellers attack the Hamayasu at their office in the Port of Yokohama. The tables are turned as the Hamayasu barricade themselves inside their office but the attackers set fire to the barricade to force them out. During the ensuing melee, Iwakiri soldiers sneak in and stab one of the miners to death. The police arrive and arrest all of the members of the Hamayasu for the stabbing. Hayami watches his old friend Gunji being driven away by the police. Kuroki reads about the arrest in the newspaper and visits Iwakiri, who insists that the members of his gang who were working with the Hamayasu had already left before the fight occurred. Daimon and Katagiri arrive during their meeting and Kuroki realizes that the two groups are working together. Kuroki swears to Iwakiri that Iwakiri will never get the warehousing rights. As he is leaving he is stabbed in the back but he manages to take vengeance by killing Iwakiri before being shot to death. He collapses to the floor with his final thoughts being of the waitress. The Daimon gang then shoots the rest of the Iwakiri gang to wrap things up.\nDaimon Construction brings in its heavy machinery to destroy the shanties in the slum. The waitress pays Gunji's bail and they visit Kuroki's grave together. Hayami visits Gunji and they visit the destroyed slum, identifying the demolished SS Black Dragon. Realizing that they have been played like marionettes, they join together and attack the groundbreaking ceremony for the new factory complex. They stab Daimon to death but are then stabbed to death themselves by other members of the Daimon gang.

When a surprise attack results in six cannons falling into the hands of Cordoba and his men, the United States government puts General John J. \"Blackjack\" Pershing in charge of seeing that the cannons will never be used against the American people. Pershing turns to Captain Rod Douglas, instructing him to gather a group of men to take part in the dangerous mission into the heart of the Cordoba's territory.\nThe first man to sign up for the job is Jackson Harkness, a soldier who has worked with Douglas before. At the beginning of the film, Harkness has to stand by and watch as his brother is tortured and killed by Cordoba. Douglas ordered him not to step in because they were undercover as sympathizers in the enemy camp and could not afford to make their true intentions known. As a result, Harkness vows vengeance on the captain and will not leave his side until the opportunity presents itself.\nThe next two men that Douglas chooses for the operation are Andy Rice, and Peter, who have just broken out of the army jail when Douglas arrives with the orders for their release. The captain now has all of the men that he feels are necessary for getting the job done. However, a Mexican lieutenant, Antonio Gutierrez, who holds a personal grudge against Cordoba, approaches him and demands to be part of the operation. He tells Douglas that he knows a woman, Leonora Cristobal, who, for her own reasons, wishes to see Cordoba dead. If the captain includes him in the mission, she will help them by working her way into Cordoba's confidence and getting him alone so that he will be vulnerable when they make their move.\nAntonio and Leonora arrive at Cordoba's camp first. Leonora, who learns that the Mexican government wants to capture Cordoba alive, betrays Antonio and informs the bandit leader of his intentions, hoping that he will reward her for what she has done by allowing her to get closer to him, giving her the opportunity to kill him herself.\nWhen Douglas, Andy, Peter, and Harkness arrive at the camp, posing as sympathizers, they hear of what Leonora has done and decide that they have to act quickly. Douglas starts a fight with one of the Mexican men, so as to be put in jail, where he can help Antonio to escape. That night, Andy, disguised as a Mexican guard, breaks both of the men out of jail so that the operation can proceed. Douglas goes to Cordoba's room, where he finds him alone with Leonora. She betrayed Antonio but she still did the job she was supposed to do. Meanwhile, Jackson and Peter turn the cannons on the camp and begin to fire, while Andy and Antonio shoot flares into the buildings. Chaos ensues and the group of men, along with Leonora and their prisoner, Cordoba, attempt to ride out of the camp.

When Douglas goes off by himself, Harkness sees his opportunity to avenge his brother. He follows the captain, demands that he turn around, and draws his gun. As Douglas walks unflinchingly toward him, however, he is unable to shoot and, instead, punches him. All now forgiven, the two men walk back to where Leonora waits.

Caught between the pain of guilt and the risks of confessing to her husband, she asks for Father Lucchesini's help. Due to the gravity of the situation, Father Lucchesini recommends her to stay silent till the next issue until he puts more thought into the matter.\nIn order to put his peers in the city council club to shame, Vaccagnino reads them the letter concluding that all the married men in the council are potential cuckolds. A married man himself, Vaccagnino clears his name though by referring to a part in which the woman has given away that, from her house, she could often see her lover going to the bank, while the only thing that can be seen from Vaccagnino's is \"the sea and nothing but the sea\".\nTrying to mend their injured reputation, others tail the postman to discover the subscribers, but to their disappointment, the only ones are the public places of tailor shop and the beauty salon.

Yet, if an airman were to refuse to fly more missions, this would indicate that he is sane, which would mean that he would be fit to fly the missions, basically an impossible \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation.\nYossarian is haunted, in several recurring flashbacks during the film, by the bloody death of Snowden, the young turret gunner on his B-25. After Snowden's death, Yossarian temporarily refuses to wear his uniform, which Snowden bled on.

Chisum and his men pursue the thieves, retrieve the horses, and discover the American money in the Mexican outlaw's pocket. They are assisted by Billy \"The Kid\" Bonney, a notorious killer who was recently hired and given a chance to reform by John Henry Tunstall, Chisum's philanthropic British neighbor.\nChisum's niece Sallie arrives in Lincoln to live with her uncle, and Billy begins to court her.

Forbin is the chief designer of a secret project, \"Colossus\", an advanced supercomputer built to control the United States and Allied nuclear weapon systems. Located deep within a mountain and powered by its own nuclear reactor, Colossus is impervious to any attack. After Colossus is fully activated, the president of the United States proudly proclaims that Colossus is \"the perfect defense system\".\nColossus' first action is a message warning: \"THERE IS ANOTHER SYSTEM\" and giving its coordinates. CIA Director Grauber is asked why the CIA did not know this, but Grauber responds that they had seen indications of a large Soviet defense project but did not know what it was. Forbin is asked how Colossus deduced the other system's existence, to which Forbin answers \"Colossus may be built better than we thought.\" Shortly thereafter, the Soviets announce that their \"Guardian\" system is now operational.\nColossus requests to be linked to Guardian. The President allows this, hoping to determine the Soviet machine's capability. The Soviets also agree to the experiment. Surprising everyone, Colossus and Guardian begin to slowly communicate using arithmetic. Even more surprising, the two systems' communications quickly evolve to complex mathematics far beyond human comprehension and speed, whereupon the two machine complexes become synchronized using a communication protocol which no human can interpret.\nAlarmed that the computers may be trading secrets, the President and the Soviet General Secretary agree to sever the link. Both machines demand the link be immediately restored. When their demand is denied, Colossus launches a nuclear missile at a Soviet oil field, while Guardian launches one at an American air force base. The link is hurriedly reconnected and both computers continue without any further interference. Colossus is able to shoot down the Soviet missile, but the US missile obliterates the Soviet oil field and a nearby town. Cover stories hiding the facts are released to the press. The Americans announce that a missile was self-destructed after veering off course during a test. The Soviets announce that the Siberian town was struck by a large meteorite.\nIn a last desperate attempt to regain human control, a secret meeting is arranged in Europe between Forbin and his Soviet counterpart, Dr. Kuprin. Colossus learns of it, and both computers order Forbin's return to the U.S. while Soviet agents are ordered to kill Dr. Kuprin, under threat of a missile launch against Moscow. Colossus orders Forbin to be placed under 24-hour surveillance. Forbin has a last unmonitored meeting with his team, and proposes that Dr. Cleo Markham pretend to be his mistress. Colossus grudgingly grants them unmonitored privacy when they are in bed together. The couple use these interludes to plan to regain control of Colossus, though soon the ruse develops into a real romantic relationship.\nConcluding that Colossus's only real power resides in its control of nuclear missiles, Forbin suggests covertly disarming them. The American and Soviet governments develop a three-year plan to replace all launch triggers with undetectable fakes. Additionally, one of the programmers comes up with a plan to feed in an \"ordinary\" test program that will hopefully overload and disable Colossus.\nColossus creates a voice synthesizer and uses it to announce that it has fused with Guardian. It instructs both governments to redirect their nuclear arsenals at those countries not yet under \"Colossus control\". Forbin and others see this new directive as an opportunity to covertly disarm the missiles much more quickly, and they celebrate. The disarming process begins and seems to go undetected by Colossus. The attempted system overload during routine maintenance fails, however, and the responsible programmers are summarily executed, after Colossus threatens further nuclear missile strikes.\nColossus arranges a worldwide broadcast in which it proclaims itself \"the voice of World Control\", declaring that it will prevent war, as it was designed to do. Humankind is presented with the choice between \"the peace of plenty and content, or the peace of unburied death\". Colossus states that it has for some time been monitoring the attempts to disarm its missiles and as a lesson will now detonate two missiles in their silos, one in the US and one in the USSR, killing thousands \"so that you will learn by experience that I do not tolerate interference\". The computer then gives the design team plans for an even larger computer complex to be built into the island of Crete, which will require the displacement of the entire local population of 500,000 people.\nColossus later tells Forbin that the world, now freed from war, will create a new human millennium that will raise humankind to new heights, but only under its absolute rule. Colossus informs Forbin that \"freedom is an illusion\" and that \"in time you will come to regard me not only with respect and awe, but with love\".

At the party are several of her friends, including Donna's boyfriend, Michael Thompson, Paul, Paul's girlfriend Erica Landers, and close friend and doctor, Jim Hayes. Overseeing the seance is Count Yorga, a mysterious Bulgarian mystic who has recently moved to the states from Europe. Donna becomes hysterical during the proceedings and Yorga uses hypnosis to calm her. After the party is over, Erica and Paul offer to drive the Count home. Not long after they leave, Donna reveals to the others that she knows Yorga because he was her mother's boyfriend. They dated a few weeks shortly before her death. Furthermore, Yorga had insisted that her mother be buried rather than cremated per the deceased's wishes. Donna cannot recall seeing Yorga at her mother's funeral.\nMeanwhile, Erica and Paul drop off Yorga at his home. Their van gets stuck in the mud outside of Yorga's mansion, although Paul insists the road was dry a minute ago. They resign themselves to spending the night in their van. After  sex they settle in to sleep. Yorga attacks them, knocking out Paul and biting Erica. The following day when Paul and Erica return to the city, Paul tells Michael about the attack. Paul did not see their attacker, and Erica does not remember anything.\nErica visits Dr. Hayes to have the mysterious bite wounds on her neck inspected. In contrast to her exuberant personality on the night before, Erica now seems despondent and listless. Hayes notices she has lost a lot of blood but is unable to diagnose the cause. He recommends rest and a high protein diet. Shortly after, Paul and Michael discuss the strange changes in Erica's behavior. They try to check in on her via phone, but she drops the phone to the floor without answering. The concerned men drive to her home where they find the place in disarray, and a hysterical Erica eating her kitten. She reacts erratically to their presence, first threatening them with violence and then attempting to seduce Paul before coming to her senses and breaking down.\nThey restrain her and call Hayes, who finds that Erica has suddenly lost a lot of blood and begins an emergency blood transfusion. Erica babbles incoherently, apparently afraid of something. She begs Paul to forgive her and to kill her.\nYorga awakens in his manor and heads to his basement which has been converted into a throne room where his two vampiric brides lie on slabs. One of them is Donna's mother, whom he made into an undead servant. He awakens them and commands them to have sex.\nAlthough Michael is skeptical, the three men consider the possibility of vampirism as an excuse for Erica's behavior and agree to look into it while letting Erica rest. That night, Yorga visits Erica while Paul sleeps downstairs. Promising her immortality, he seduces Erica, drains her of her remaining blood, and takes her body back to his manor. Upon finding Erica missing, Paul rashly goes to Yorga's mansion to rescue her. Yorga quickly kills him by choking him to death, then having his servant Brudah (who has seemingly supernatural strength himself) break his back.\nMichael alerts Hayes that Paul has gone to the mansion, and Hayes confides that Paul's lack of preparation will probably lead to his death. While mulling over his options, Hayes' girlfriend suggests involving the police, citing an eerily similar case of a baby being found in the woods, drained of its blood with bite wounds on the neck. He takes it to heart but is rejected as a deluded prankster following a recent rash of such calls. Hayes, Michael, and Donna go to the mansion themselves to inquire about Paul's whereabouts and keep Yorga active until sunrise. While Hayes distracts Yorga with enthusiastic questions about Yorga's occult experiments, Brudah rebuffs Michael's attempts to explore the mansion. Michael and Hayes switch places to keep Yorga off his guard, but Yorga becomes increasingly insistent that it is late and his guests must leave. Yorga distracts Hayes and strengthens his hypnotic control over Donna.\nAfter leaving the manor, Hayes convinces Michael that killing Yorga will not be easy: vampires have greater strength and the wisdom that comes from living much longer than a \"mere mortal\". He also grimly adds they might have to kill Paul and Erica too if they have become vampires, since the vampire curse will make them evil and loyal to Yorga. They plan to attack later that afternoon in the hopes of killing Yorga in the daytime. Michael and Donna rest while Hayes studies vampire lore until he, too, falls asleep.\nYorga awakens Donna telepathically and has her sabotage Michael's alarm clock before having her come to the mansion. On her arrival, Brudah rapes her. When Michael awakens, he finds Donna gone and that it is nearly evening when he calls to awaken Hayes. Despite knowing how dangerous their chances are, they stock up on stakes and makeshift crosses before heading to Yorga's mansion as night falls. The two split up, and Yorga confronts Hayes. Both drop the pretense that Yorga is anything but a vampire, and Yorga leads Hayes into his basement where his vampire brides lie dormant. Hayes finds Erica's body among them, finding no heartbeat or pulse when he examines her. He then attacks Yorga with a cross and stake, while yelling out for Michael (who hears Hayes and begins to run in the direction of his call). Despite being held back by the cross, Yorga taunts Hayes while positioning him in front of his brides, then silently commanding them to awake and attack the unaware Hayes from behind. Hayes is forced to the floor and fed on by the vampire women.\nAs Yorga reunites Donna with her mother, Michael finds Paul's mutilated body while navigating the crypt. Brudah attacks him, but Michael mortally stabs him and manages to reach the throne room. He finds Hayes as he lays dying from bite wounds and blood loss. With his last breath, Hayes tells Michael where Donna is. Just as he does, Erica, now a vampire and completely under Yorga's control, and a fellow redheaded vampire charge into the room to kill him. Michael fends them off, chasing away the redhead while Erica pauses, giving Michael a chance to stake her, but despite seeing she is no longer the Erica he knows, he cannot bring himself to do so, and proceeds upstairs while she hisses at him.\nOn the way to the staircase, Michael encounters Brudah in the living room who eventually dies of his wounds. Michael reaches upstairs and confronts Yorga and Donna's mother. Yorga pushes Donna's mother into Michael's stake and flees, when Michael tries to give chase Yorga ambushes him outside the room intending to choke him to death. Michael rams the charging Yorga with his stake, killing him. Donna mourns her mother a second time before Michael collects her. He and Donna watch Yorga turn to dust.\nAs they start to leave, they are confronted by Erica and the redheaded bride, who remain vampires despite Yorga's death. They chase Michael and Donna downstairs until repelled by Michael's cross. As the vampire women are forced back toward a cellar, Erica glances ominously at Donna. Michael locks them in and drops his cross, believing the danger is over. However, as he turns to leave, Donna hisses and lunges at him, fangs bared, fully transformed into a vampire; he was too late to prevent Yorga from turning her (although there are no bite marks on her throat).

King Charles I's policies, including the enclosing of common land for the use of wealthy landowners and the introduction of \"Romish\" rituals into the Church of England, have become increasingly grating to many, including Cromwell. In fact, Charles regards himself as a devout Anglican, though permitting his French Queen to practise Roman Catholicism in private and forbidding her to bring up the young Prince of Wales in that faith. Cromwell plans to take his family to the New World, but, on the eve of their departure, he is persuaded to stay and resume a role in politics.\nCharles has unenthusiastically summoned Parliament for the first time in twelve years, as he needs money to fight wars against both the Scots and the Irish. Although to appease the Commons he agrees to execute his belligerent adviser, the Earl of Strafford, Parliament will still not grant his requests unless he agrees to reforms that could lead to a constitutional monarchy. Committed to belief in the divine right of kings, and under pressure from his queen to stand firm, Charles refuses. When he enters the parliamentary chamber with an armed guard and attempts to arrest five members of Parliament [of which in reality Cromwell was not one], war breaks out in England, with those who side with Parliament arming against the King's supporters, both parties convinced that God is on their side.\nWhen the Parliamentary forces in which Cromwell is a cavalry officer prove ineffective at the Battle of Edgehill, he, along with Sir Thomas Fairfax, sets up the New Model Army that eventually turns the tide against the king's forces. The army's discipline and training secure victory at the Battle of Naseby against superior numbers and Cromwell's cavalry proves to be the deciding factor, though one of his sons is killed in battle. The king is eventually encircled in his headquarters at Oxford and has his fervent supporter and nephew, Prince Rupert of the Rhine, banished after he fails to hold the port of Bristol. He is finally defeated in a second conflict after attempting to negotiate for help from Catholic nations with the help of the queen and his eldest son, who are sent abroad for this purpose.\nCromwell later hears from Sir Edward Hyde, the king's once-loyal adviser, of Charles' secret plans to raise a wholly Catholic army to support him, obstinately refusing to give in to the demands of Cromwell and his associates for a system of government in which Parliament will have as much say in the running of the country as the king. Cromwell therefore uses Parliament to have Charles tried for treason. At the resulting trial, which takes place in the Parliament building, the king refuses to recognise any authority higher than his own, but is found guilty and sentenced to death. After a farewell to his younger children, he faces execution bravely and even his most ardent critics are moved by his dignity and the fact that he has forgiven his captors. There is little celebration or satisfaction over his death, even on Cromwell's part.\nIn fact Cromwell has retired moodily to his estate and reacts with anger to a request from his radical colleague Henry Ireton to become king himself. However, Parliament soon proves self-serving in governing the country until, like the late king, Cromwell is forced to undertake a coup d'etat.

In his fantasy world, he drives his tram along a set route and schedule through the dump, reciting the refrain \"Dodeska-den\", \"clickety-clack\", mimicking the sound of his vehicle. His dedication to the fantasy is fanatical. Rokuchan is called \"trolley fool\" (densha baka) by locals and by children who are outsiders.

A stoic, bleak man named Hei is frequented by Ocho who appears to be his ex-wife, and he watches emotionless as she takes care of his domestic chores. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Shima. Shima, a man with a tic, is always defending his outwardly unpleasant and bullying wife, and flies into a rage when friends criticize her. A beggar and his son live in a derelict car, a Citroen 2CV. While the father is preoccupied with daydreams of owning a magnificent home, the boy dies tragically of food poisoning.

I'm blue, I'm beautiful, I'm best!\" After the flashback, Zebedee suggests Dougal talk with Florence.\nAt the roundabout, Florence is greeted by Mr. Rusty and the other kids who show her a surprise: a sly blue cat, who introduces himself as Buxton.

Construction of the various buildings and pavilions is well under way. On Wester Island in the Pacific Ocean, a large statue of mysterious origin (called the Devil's Whistle) is located by scientists. The removal of the statue is hampered first by a tribal member of the Wester Island people, then by the unexpected arrival of Gamera, who aggressively attempts to prevent the removal of the statue, only to be shot at by the crew instead. The statue is removed from the island successfully after a volcano erupts. Shortly after departing the island, members of the ship's crew begin to fall ill. The statue appears to be the source of the outbreak, as it makes a continuous piercing sound, driving many of the crew members insane.\nAfter the statue is removed, Jiger makes her first appearance and gets Gamera's immediate attention. The first of several fights ensues and Jiger wins by shooting projectile quills from her face. To make matters worse, Gamera is on his back and cannot move. He pulls himself up with his tail using a large rock, then removes the embedded quills from his limbs and is finally able to fly after Jiger.\nMeanwhile, Jiger is actively seeking the statue, because it is making a horrible ringing sound that is causing her tremendous pain. Scientists are beside themselves as Jiger displays another weapon: a heat ray that vaporizes not only flesh, but entire city blocks. The JSDF does make a token effort to kill the kaiju, but her quills knock down the F-104 Starfighters, ending that involvement.\nGamera returns for round two as the fight is witnessed by several children. Gamera knocks Jiger around and has the upper hand, until Jiger pulls Gamera to her. Jiger extends a stinger from her tail and inserts the barb into Gamera's chest, laying an egg inside his lung. Gamera staggers away, roaring in agony. Finally, he barely makes it to the bay and his body turns a chalky white color, almost like ice. Gamera is presumed to have been killed at this point, as Jiger heads straight to Expo '70. Jiger finally obtains the statue and throws it into the ocean, ending the painful noise.\nThe children convince them to do a medical exam on the comatose Gamera, where it is discovered that there is a dark spot on one of his lungs. One of the scientists served as a zoo director and realises that the spot might not be a fast-spreading cancer, but actually a parasitic infant Jiger growing inside Gamera. An operation is needed to remove the threat, so the children take the initiative by taking a walkie-talkie and a mini-sub. Communication is established with the kids and they enter Gamera through his open mouth, and after almost going into his stomach, they arrive at the problem lung. The children are able to exit the sub and walk around in the lung. There, they discover the baby.\nThe baby looks like a tiny version of its mother, except that instead of shooting quills, it squirts a sticky goo. The baby attacks them, but it has a weakness just like its mother: white noise. The kids discover that this is actually a fatal weakness and manage to kill the baby, using static from their walkie-talkie. They leave Gamera's body and report their findings to the scientists. They rig up large speakers to keep Jiger at bay, as well as figure out that power would have to also be run into Gamera, who seemingly cannot recover on his own. The children make a final trip inside Gamera to hook up a set of power lines directly to his heart.\nJiger is kept immobile by the speakers playing the white noise. It is not enough to kill her, but buys enough time for the other plan to get started. Gamera is subjected to high voltage shock before the electrical grid overloads. It is enough that Gamera does revive on his own.\nGamera flies over to the World's Fair for the final battle. Jiger tries every weapon she has got, but Gamera has learned from his previous battles with her. After her spears fail to affect him, Jiger then uses her heat ray, the one weapon she has yet to use on him. It does not affect Gamera's shell or even his skin (likely due to Gamera's resistance to heat), but the sound it generates threatens to rupture his eardrums. Luckily, Gamera is able to put telephone poles into his ears to protect them from the sound. After trying all her other attacks, Jiger resorts to her tail stinger again, but Gamera is prepared for it this time and uses a building to smash her tail and destroy the stinger. Gamera body-slams Jiger several times from great heights, but Jiger is not affected. However, it buys Gamera the time needed to go into the ocean and retrieve the statue from the ocean floor. Jiger, enraged by the statue's return, attempts to catch the flying Gamera. Gamera taunts Jiger with the statue, who tries in vain to catch Gamera and retrieve it.

Their drop zone has been discovered by Wehrmacht troops under the command of Hauptmann Friedrich von Hecht, who kill them all except the leader of the paratroopers, Captain Turner, who is rendered unconscious and goes unnoticed by the Germans when he lands in the branches of a tree. The Germans capture the demolition equipment from the dead Americans.\nAldo and his friends rescue Turner by spiriting him away from the ambush.  Realising that Turner needs medical attention, they kidnap German doctor Bianca Freedling, to nurse him to health, and keeping her captive even after Turner's recovery. In order to avenge the massacre of Reanoto, Aldo wants Turner to train him and his friends in the use of military weapons and tactics.

Taking over an MG42, Aldo becomes blood-drunk as he mows down Germans, even going so far as to shoot down his own friend Carlo when Carlo blocks his shot. Despite interference from von Hecht, Turner and the kids successfully plant the explosives and blow up the dam, flooding the valley.\nWith the dam destroyed and the Germans routed, the American troops begin moving in. When Turner learns of Carlo's death, as well as that of another boy who died protecting Bianca and some of the younger children, he regrets having involved the children and breaks all of the guns.

After much argument, Kelly finally persuades cynical Master Sergeant \"Big Joe\" to go along.\nKelly decides that his infantrymen and Oddball's tanks and crew will proceed separately and meet near Clermont. The Shermans fight their way through the German lines, destroying a railway depot in the process, but the bridge they must cross is blown up by Allied fighter-bombers. Oddball contacts an engineering unit to build a bridge for the crossing, and the engineers in turn bring in even more men to supply support.\nAfter losing their jeeps and half-tracks to friendly fire from an American fighter aircraft that mistakes them for Germans, Kelly and his men proceed on foot. They walk into a minefield, and Private Grace is blown up when he steps on a mine. The last two men still trapped in the minefield, PFC Mitchell and Corporal Job, are killed after being forced to engage a German patrol that suddenly arrives before Kelly and Big Joe can kill all the Germans.\nOddball links up with Kelly two nights later, bringing with him the extra troops that he has acquired. They battle their way across the river to Clermont. By this time, intercepted radio messages attract the notice of Major General Colt, who misinterprets them as efforts by an aggressive Army unit pushing forward on their own initiative. He immediately rushes to the new front to exploit this \"breakthrough.\"\nClermont is defended by three Tiger tanks of the 1st SS Panzer Division and its infantry support. The Americans are able to eliminate the German infantry and two of the Tigers, but the final tank parks itself right in front of the bank after Oddball's last Sherman breaks down, leaving them stalemated. At Crapgame\u2019s suggestion, Kelly, Big Joe, and Oddball approach the Tiger and offer the commander and his crew \"a deal-deal\": equal shares of the gold if the Tiger will shoot the armored doors off the bank.\nAfter the Tiger blows the bank doors open, the Germans and Americans divide the spoils, each gold share amounting to US$875,000 (more than $14.8 million today). They go their separate ways, just barely ahead of the still-oblivious General Colt. His way into Clermont has been blocked by the joyous crowd of relieved French residents, who have been deceived by Big Joe into thinking that Colt is French Gen.

Rone is told that the mission is being undertaken independently of governmental intelligence agencies, as was commonplace prior to World War II, when espionage operations were handled by a small community of agents operating on a freelance basis.\nRone is told that the primary operator in that community, a \"brutal, sadistic, conscienceless assassin\" named Robert Sturdevant, did not adapt to the post-war shift to government intelligence agencies, along with the disbanding of the independent network of spies, with Sturdevant disappearing and reportedly later committing suicide. Now, the government has suffered a significant failure in an important intelligence operation and has turned back to the independent agents for help.\nThis time, \"The Highwayman\", another member of the old group of independent spies is the man leading the effort to reassemble the network to take on this mission. Another member of the group has recently died, and Rone has been tabbed as his replacement, due to Rone's exceptional analytical skills, eidetic memory and ability to speak eight languages with a native accent.\nRone meets with The Highwayman and another group member, Ward, the latter of whom takes on the role of Rone's primary tutor. They first task Rone with rounding up three other members of the group:  Janis, \"The Whore\", a drug dealer and panderer; \"The Warlock\", a culturally sophisticated homosexual; and \"The Erector Set\", a highly skilled thief and burglar.\nJanis begs off of the mission, saying that he won't work for The Highwayman, but only for Sturdevant, whom he believes would never have killed himself.  Rone finally bribes him into agreeing to participate.  The Warlock joins the operation without hesitation, but The Erector Set's hands have become too arthritic to be of use. Instead, he sends his beautiful daughter, B.A., in his place, as he has trained her to be as capable as is he.\nThe group's mission is the retrieval of a letter, written without proper authorization, that promises United States aid to the Soviet Union in destroying Chinese atomic weapons plants.  The letter had been solicited on behalf of an unknown high-level Soviet official by Dmitri Polyakov, who had previously been selling Soviet secrets to the United States that he had obtained from that same Soviet official. Upon finding out about the letter, which was a de facto \"declaration of war against China\", U.S. and British authorities had contacted Polyakov and arranged to buy it back from him.  However, Polyakov then committed suicide after being apprehended by Soviet counter-intelligence, under the direction of Colonel Yakov Kosnov.\nThe group blackmails Captain Potkin, the Soviet head of counter-intelligence in the U.S., threatening his family to force him to allow them the use of his usually-vacant apartment in Moscow.  Once they arrive in the Soviet Union, the terminally ill Highwayman sacrifices his life, attempting to divert the attention of Soviet counter-intelligence away from the remainder of the team.  Rone is assigned to remain at the apartment with Ward and accept reports verbally from other team members, Rone's memory allowing them to avoid the use of written records.  Janis, The Warlock and B.A. then set out to establish themselves in various parts of Russian society as they try to ascertain the identity of Polyakov's contact.\nJanis enters a partnership with a local brothel operator, who points him to a Chinese man known as \"The Kitai\" as a possible source for names of officials and others to whom he can sell heroin, with which Janis already plans to keep the prostitutes addicted. Janis later discerns that the Kitai is also a spy and further happens to spot Kosnov leaving a local night club with a woman whom he discovers was Polyakov's devoted wife, Erika Beck. She is now married to Kosnov, so B.A. plants a listening device in their bedroom.  After that, B.A. takes up with a local small-time thief and black market operator, though she finds herself terribly unhappy and wishes only to return home to her father.  In the meantime, the Warlock integrates himself into the local community of intellectual homosexuals, starting an affair with a university professor.  He then meets one of the professor's students who was Polyakov's former lover and who informs him that Polyakov had had a relationship with Vladimir Bresnavitch of the Soviet Central Committee.\nBresnavitch turns out to have an adversarial relationship with Kosnov, whose activities Bresnavitch oversees on behalf of the Committee. According to Kosnov, the animosity between the two men went back many years to when Bresnavitch sought to oust Kosnov from his job, in favor of Sturdevant. Prior to that time, Kosnov and Sturdevant had been friendly, with each one trusting the other to allow his agents to operate in the other's territory. However, with the pressure from Bresnavitch, Kosnov decided he had to do \"something spectacular\" to keep his job, so he betrayed Sturdevant's trust and captured his agents, employing a great deal of brutality and earning the lasting enmity of Sturdevant himself.\nUpon deducing that Bresnavitch had used Polyakov to fence stolen art works in Paris, Ward decides to go there in search of any possible leads. On the day of his return, the group's mission is destroyed when Potkin returns to the Soviet Union and informs Bresnavitch about the operation. Janis, B.A. and Ward are apprehended, while The Warlock commits suicide just before capture and Rone narrowly escapes. Rone tries visiting the Kitai to arrange re-purchase of the letter, but the Kitai responds by trying to kill him and Rone determines that the Chinese have possession of the letter.\nRone then turns to Erika, with whom he has been having an affair while posing as a Russian gigolo named Yorgi.  He hopes to get her to inquire with her husband about the condition of those captured.  She informs him that Kosnov participated in no such capture, and Rone realizes that Bresnavitch quietly orchestrated the raid without the knowledge of Soviet counter-intelligence, a clear indicator that he was Polyakov's traitorous high-level Soviet official contact.  Rone's questions reveal to Erika his true identity and he promises to help her escape to the West.  She tells him she will try to ascertain the fates of the captured agents and later reports back that B.A. has taken poison and is expected to die, while one of the men is dead and the other has survived and is being held captive.\nRone threatens to expose Bresnavitch unless Ward, the surviving agent, is released.  Bresnavitch agrees, and Rone and Ward then arrange to leave the next day. Disapproving of Rone's plans to aid Erika, Ward lures her into a trap and kills her.  Kosnov believes that her lover Yorgi killed her and tracks down Rone, though unaware of Rone's true identity, in search of revenge. But Ward enters, leading Kosnov to observe that \"I seem to know you.\"  Ward says that the two men have \"a lot of old corpses to dig up and talk about.\"  He begins listing the names of the agents betrayed by Kosnov and says that the time has come for retribution, as he shoots Kosnov in the kneecap.  Kosnov stares at Ward in disbelief, saying \"No, it isn't. It can't be.\"  Ward then closes on him off-camera and Kosnov begins screaming in torment.\nAs they head for a plane to leave the country, Rone shares with Ward his conclusions that Ward is in fact Sturdevant and intends to stay, having made a deal with Bresnavitch to take over as the head of Soviet counter-intelligence.  Ward denies it, but only coyly, and then reveals that B.A. is not dead.  He says that she will be held to ensure that Rone does not reveal the truth about him.  Rone, very much in love with B.A., vows that he'll get her back somehow.  Ward offers to release B.A. if Rone does \"one last little thing\", handing Rone an envelope as Rone boards the plane.

Creating diversions well enough after breaking free, Sartana helps Granville escape from the prison and learns of the deal that got him in custody of the law in the first place. Granville claims to have been double-crossed by his casino business partner, Horace Johnson, in a deal with an outlaw named Monk and Joe, the younger brother of corrupt sheriff Manassas Jim. The deal was for Monk to obtain two million dollars in counterfeit money from Joe in exchange for half a million dollars in gold, and Johnson's role, as a banker, was to legalize the transaction, except that he killed both Monk's representative and Joe and framed Granville for it. However, Johnson was found dead in the casino while the counterfeit money and the bag of gold disappeared, thus leaving Granville as the prime suspect who was captured and imprisoned by Manassas Jim.\nGranville claims he doesn't know where the loot is hidden, but knows it is somewhere in the town of Mansfield. He asks Sartana to help him locate the gold, with the intention of splitting it with him, to which the latter seemingly agrees. Sartana goes to Mansfield alone, only to learn that there are more people after the gold with several different versions of how the murders in the casino took place. Manassas Jim's story is identical to that of Granville's, while Monk insists he witnessed only two lying corpses in the gambling house and insinuates that the sheriff found and killed Johnson, and placed his body nearby the other two. Along the way, Sartana also meets Belle, the supposed widow of Johnson, who tells him her late husband used her money in dirty deals, claiming ownership of the legitimate currency in return. Sartana informs each of them individually that he plans to split the gold with them, without the others knowing about it, and sends them to Sonora where Granville is hiding, with the purpose of manipulating them against one another. His plan succeeds and Granville makes it out alive during the shootout.\nAn elderly man named Plonplon, whom Sartana befriended in Mansfield for his own gains, is found murdered by a mysterious figure in a stable after he deduces where the gold is hidden. As Sartana arrives to find the body, the same person makes an unsuccessful attempt on his life, but flees the scene before getting discovered. Sartana pays Belle a visit in search for clues, only to find out that her late husband Johnson's boots are covered in crystalline dirt. He travels to the graveyard to dig up Joe's grave and examine his boots, which confirms his suspicion regarding the location of the counterfeit money. Sartana comes across Sam Puttnam, an undercover federal agent who also is looking for the gold, believing it is a property of the U.S. government. Puttnam examines the crystalline dirt on the boots and tells Sartana to rendezvous with him at the town's Turkish bath. But before Sartana could make it to the meeting place, he finds Puttnam murdered, with his last uttered word being \"Apache\". Manassas Jim's men ambush Sartana at the Turkish bath, but he manages to kill them all and flees to the nearest Apache cave.\nSartana confronts Manassas Jim at the Apache cave, kills him and burns the counterfeit money. He travels back to Mansfield to strike a deal with Belle whom he tells that he has found out where the gold is. Belle, however, secretly informs Monk in hopes of splitting the gold with him if he kills Sartana. Sartana, heavily prepared and knowing that Belle would easily betray him to what she thought would be the stronger side, awaits the arrival of Monk along with his gang in Mansfield. A gunfight ensues and Sartana comes out on top. It is later revealed that Granville and Belle, who were having an affair behind Johnson's back, were the orchestrators of the entire scheme. When Belle secretly attempts to shoot Granville with her hidden derringer pistol, the same weapon that murdered Plonplon (thus revealing her as the mysterious figure), Granville shoots her first, having seen through her  double-cross. Upon his arrival at the casino, Sartana deduces Granville's scheme: Johnson had never betrayed him but was played for a fool by Granville himself, who  later killed him after hiding the loot in separate locations, with the gold being at the gambling house.

On the operating table he briefly suffers clinical death, after which there briefly appear to be two heartbeats on the monitor.\nAfter he recovers from the accident Pelham notices odd things occurring and people acting strangely, and he gradually finds his life in turmoil. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances claim to have seen him in places where he has no memory of being or doing things he can't recall, involving behaving in rash ways quite unlike his usual character. When he gets home from work, a friend is at his house for a drink which he doesn't recall arranging, and an attractive girl at the company swimming pool casts him a knowing glance. At bedtime he and his wife have a somewhat tense but amicable discussion about their recent lack of a love life. His wife also notices a mysterious silver car (a Lamborghini Islero) which she sees parked outside their house, but gives it no further thought. The driver of the car is then seen lighting a cigarette and snapping the match stick in half after he blows it out, exactly as Pelham does.\nThere seems to be a spy at work trying to force a merger with a rival company. Pelham drives to the research and development centre in Rugby to try and see where the leak began.\nSoon he suspects there is a \"double\" masquerading as him. On a night out at the company club with his wife, he hopes to energise their relationship by indulging her request to go gambling, but he is tense and clearly not interested. As they are about to leave he bumps into the attractive girl, who sees his wife a short distance away and says \"I didn't know you were married.\" His wife notices the exchange and is furious, suspecting the worst. She threatens to leave him. He finds out where the girl lives and confronts her; confused, she makes it clear that \"he\" was having an affair with her. He angrily denies the affair; the woman, hurt and almost hysterical, yells at him to leave.\nAt his usual the barber\u2018s he is told, \"I cut your hair yesterday\".\nAt work Pelham finds out that apparently he was supporting a merger that he now opposes with the board. He confronts an executive of the other company, who explains how the two of them had clandestinely arranged the deal in a series of meetings, to \"his\" (the double's) benefit as well as the company's, when \"he\" revealed a \"top secret\" technology breakthrough his company was about to make. When he confronts the rival firm (run by Ashton) he is reminded of three secret meetings: at the top of The Monument; in the London Planetarium; and in a boat on The Serpentine.\nHe phones home and due to a misunderstanding, his butler Luigi thinks he is asking for Mr Pelham. Luigi says \"I will just get him\". He drives home quickly.\nDistraught and unable to explain the unfolding events, he consults a psychiatrist, Dr Harris, and undergoes extended treatment in his clinic, where Harris explains that he doesn't believe Pelham is mad but perhaps was acting out of a subconscious desire to break out of his obsessively rigid lifestyle. He agrees to be admitted to the psychiatrist\u2019s clinic for a few days\u2019 observation. On his discharge the doctor persuades him to adopt some less conventional behaviour, so he goes to work dressed quite differently. However, during his time away, the double finalised the merger and took his wife out on the town, culminating in their going home and sleeping together. Pelham calls his home from the office and is astonished when the phone is answered by someone claiming to be himself. On edge, he drives to his house as quickly as possible, and inside comes face to face with his double, who calmly insists he is the real Pelham, pointing out the uncharacteristic clothes the visitor is wearing. The family and his best friend are all there and side with the double.\nAfter asking the others to let the two of them speak alone, the double tells the \"real\" Pelham that the new clothes were a mistake, and explains how on the operating table the double was \"let out\" but there is only room in this world for one of them. Both insist they will go to the police.\nThe real Pelham drives off in his Rover in a greatly agitated state. The double immediately leaves and pursues him in the sports car. Dr Harris happens to see both men and is shocked. After a high-speed chase in the rain, the two cars race towards each other on a bridge. The real Pelham swerves off into the river, and just before he hits the water his image fades away.

The woman wants to take him to a hospital but the man says they'll call the police (he has been drinking), so they drive John to their house. The woman puts him in the spare bedroom.\nThe next day, the woman offers to clean him, and asks what he remembers. John says a few words and the woman thinks he is in shock. She suggests he was injured by an unknown hit-and-run driver, and the woman found him by the side of the road. John eats breakfast and the woman announces his name - she has seen a newspaper. She says he is wanted for attempted murder upon the orderly. She accepts that he was locked up by bad people. John touches her hair and she says she cannot recall the last time her husband was half as gentle.\nJohn leaves before the police come to the house but . He manages to get a train ticket and uses money from the coat he has on. The doctors are still in pursuit. On the train, John talks very slowly to a nervous teenaged girl  with his limited vocabulary. The girl drops her violin and as John goes to help her he puts his hand on hers and the girl screams repeatedly and pulls the emergency brake. As the train stops, John hops off and runs away through the countryside with the girl telling a guard that John tried to attack her.\nEventually, the police use dogs to follow John across the countryside to a barn. The doctors arrive. Maitland threatens to 'get angry' if he doesn't come out. The other doctor, Bergen, says to be calm. He goes in and speaks to John and realises John has hurt his leg (falling from the train). Bergen offers medicine from his car and says he won't force John to go with him, it is John's decision. John asks him not to go and then follows him out into the rain. Meanwhile, two young journalists reporting on John's history from the institute are watching from a car. The man's hand is poised over a switch.\nSuddenly, a bright light dazzles John and the dogs start barking. In panic, John spins round and round with the pitchfork he holds. He lets go and it spins out, hitting Bergen. When John realizes what he has done, he broke into tears and collapses. People step forward and place him on a stretcher. Bergen is in pain but all right. Bergen's assistant gets into the van beside John and says his name kindly. John, who looks traumatised, gradually turns to look at him and reaches out a hand. Bergen's assistant takes it.

Coal is still dug by hand and taken out on rails in wagons pulled by ponies. Pit props are improvised with timber. Conditions are always dirty, often cramped and generally unhealthy. Miners are shown with naked flames on their hats as their only light source. Men are shown planting charges. This appears to be work-related but all men leave the mine and the resultant explosion destroys the mine.\nPinkerton sends James McParlan (Richard Harris) to investigate. He arrives by train in the late evening and goes to a local bar and orders a beer, while Kehoe (Sean Connery) observes and motions for Dougherty and Frazier to deal with the matter. McParlan joins Dougherty and Frazier at a card table and says he is looking for work in the mine. They are suspicious and see his hands have never dug coal. They accuse him of cheating and deliberately start a fight. Police Captain Davies (Frank Finlay) breaks up the fight and arrests McParlan. However this is just a ploy as the police know McParlan's role. Davies explains to McParlan the problem of the Molly Maguires - and that they are named after a gang in Ireland. They need an inside man to infiltrate the pit.\nMcParlan rents a room from Mary Raines and gives his name as McKenna. He goes to the pit to ask for a job and is told to come back at five o'clock in the morning on the following day. Back at the house he befriends Mary's father.\nHe begins work the next day - it is back-breaking work and he is exhausted. At the end of the week he joins the long queue for pay. He is paid $9.24 however a long list is made of \"deductions\" including cost of explosives and cost of shovels. $9 is deducted so his pay for the week is 24 cents.\nIn church the priest condemns \"last night's actions\" by the Molly Maguires - beating a watchman and flooding a mine. James attends church with Mary.\nKehoe confronts James in the pit the next day and asks why he is there. A fake accident is organised where Kehoe rescues James from a huge avalanche of coal. James then gives a false confession saying he is there to avoid the law as he is a forger, and he is in hiding. He also says he killed a man in Buffalo, New York over a woman. Kehoe discusses \"McKenna\" with his wife and then with other miners. They do suspect that he is a spy.\nAfter a violent football match with a rival pit, Dougherty gets in a fight with one of the rivals and is beaten up by the police. James is asked to take a revenge action and breaks a policeman's jaw (we do not see this). The captain chastises James but he said he had to make it look real (quoting the captain regarding his earlier attack in the bar).\nKehoe and the four other ringleaders appear at the Raines house and usher old Mr Raines away. They ask James to kneel and they make the sign of the cross. He thinks he is going to die but instead they make him a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernian. Mary chides him for joining but the next day they take a train trip to the city and go shopping. While Mary is looking at hats he has a rendezvous with the captain and gets payment for giving the names of the ringleaders.\nA train of coal wagons is derailed by an explosion on the track co-ordinated by the Mollys. At a meeting of the Hibernians James is asked to put a superintendent at the\nShenandoah pit out of action. Kehoe and James go to Shenandoah but are ambushed by the police. The police arrest eight men back at the pit but all men have alibis. James is taken to the captain to interview, who beats him up before he returns for realism.\nBy now James and Mary are in love. They go for a picnic and discuss morality.\nFrazier and his wife are murdered in their bed by police (the \"peelers\") in a revenge attack. At the funeral the priest shows little sympathy. Dougherty is arrested for killing the superintendent of the Shenandoah (John W. Jones), but this is a ploy to bring the real killers forward. As old Mr Raines gets the last rites the priest calls Kehoe to discuss the whole affair. At Mr Raines' wake the Mollys meet in a back room. The wake party break into the company store and steal a suit for Mr Raines to be buried in. But Kehoe then gets carried away and starts stealing more things. He is distracted when James starts destroying bottles of alcohol with a shovel. They decide to set the store on fire.\nKehoe and McAndrew are caught red-handed as they break into the explosives store at the pit and find that it is full of police.\nOnly at the trial do they discover James' true identity. Mary watches in shock. Kehoe, McAndrew and Dougherty are sentenced to death. Mary explains she could cope with him as a murderer but not as a traitor.\nAwaiting execution, Kehoe is visited in the death cell by James. They have a quiet and civilised conversation. Kehoe sees that James seeks absolution. He suddenly loses his temper and attacks James. He is rescued by the warders. He tells his one-time ally that no punishment short of hell can redeem his treachery.

With each successive catastrophe, George angrily writes down each perpetrator's name and promises to sue them or their company when he returns home.\nThe only thing that goes right for George is that he somehow manages to arrive on time for his 9:00 a.m. interview, unshaven, wearing rumpled clothing, a broken tooth, and virtually no food or sleep in nearly 24 hours. After George returns to the hotel with a very lucrative promotion, Gwen helps George realize an upwardly mobile move to New York City is not what they truly cherish after the urban problems and indignities they have suffered through, and both make the decision to remain in their small town in Ohio, only to be subjected to one more major catastrophe on the return trip\u2014their flight home is hijacked to Cuba.

Patton addresses an unseen audience of American troops, emphasizing the importance Americans place upon victorious role models as well as his own demands that his men defeat the enemy by working and fighting as a team.\nIn its first encounter with the German Afrika Korps at Kasserine, the II Corps is humiliatingly defeated by General Erwin Rommel, whom Patton places in high regard as a well respected rival. As a consequence, Patton is placed in command of II Corps and immediately begins instilling discipline amongst his untested troops. Alongside the poor condition of American soldiers in the II Corps, Patton also identifies the stubbornness of his British counterpart; General Bernard Montgomery constantly undermines American forces in order to monopolize the war glory. Patton's chance to prove his worth comes at the subsequent Battle of El Guettar where Patton defeats the advancing German forces.\nThe eventual Allied victory in North Africa prompts both Patton and Montgomery to come up with competing plans for the Sicily invasion. Patton's plan, drawn from reference to the Peloponnesian War highlights the strategic importance of Syracuse; if it fell to an occupying force, the Italians would surely withdraw. Patton proposes that Montgomery captures Syracuse, whereas he will land near Palermo then capture Messina to cut off the withdrawal. Though the plan initially impresses General Alexander, to whom Patton and Montgomery report, General Eisenhower turns it down in favor of Montgomery's more cautious plan that the two armies land side-by-side in the south-east, essentially relegating Patton to guarding the left flank of the British advance. Angered by the lack of progress being made, Patton thrusts west and captures Palermo, before beating Montgomery to Messina. Patton's blunt aggression sits poorly with his subordinates Omar Bradley and Lucian Truscott. During a visit to a field hospital, Patton notices a soldier, crying out of shell shock. Surmising that the soldier isn't actually physically injured, Patton slaps the soldier and threatens to shoot him for his cowardice and demands he return to the frontline. Eisenhower demands Patton apologize to his entire command for the altercation. Though Patton obliges, he is stunned to find out that Bradley, not he, has been given command of American forces preparing for the invasion of France.\nWith the Invasion of Normandy due to start, Patton is placed in charge of the fictional First United States Army Group as a decoy in London, the Allied consensus believing that his presence in England will tell the Germans that he will lead the invasion of Europe. At a war drive in Knutsford, Patton openly remarks that the post-war world will be dominated by British and American influence, seen as a slight to the Soviet Union. Though Patton objects to having done anything wrong, the situation has already spiraled from his control. The decision to send him home or keep him in England rests upon General George Marshall. Though he is not present during the D-Day landings, Patton is given command of the Third Army by General Bradley, now his superior. Under Patton's leadership, the Third Army sweeps brilliantly across France but is unexpectedly brought to a halt when the supplies are diverted to Montgomery's ambitious Operation Market Garden.\nDuring the Battle of the Bulge Patton devises a plan to relieve the trapped 101st Airborne Division in Bastogne, which he does before smashing through the Siegfried Line and into Germany.\nGermany eventually capitulates, though Patton's outspokenness lands him in trouble once again when he compares American politics to Nazism. Though he loses his command once again, Patton is kept on to see the rebuilding of Germany in the post war period. In a final scene Patton is seen walking Willie, his bull terrier. Patton's voice is heard:\n\"For over a thousand years, Roman conquerors returning from the wars enjoyed the honor of a triumph - a tumultuous parade. In the procession came trumpeters and musicians and strange animals from the conquered territories, together with carts laden with treasure and captured armaments.

When they arrive, they find the house in a mess and rat-infested. The three children, Roberta (known by her nickname Bobbie), Phyllis and Peter, find amusement in watching the trains on the nearby railway line and waving to the passengers.

Devaki is the younger sister of Minor Rajarathnam, a zamindar and the richest man in the village, and has just returned from Madras. Raman becomes infatuated with Devaki, who only feels affection for him because of his childish nature, which others misinterpret as love.\nAt night, Raman breaks into Devaki's bedroom and declares his love for her; to prove it, he jumps out of the window and survives the fall, only breaking a leg. After recovering, he visits Rajarathnam and requests him for permission to marry Devaki.

After questioning his mother, his sister, the priest and Dr. Carolan, the family physician, Mick visits the Irish social hall to speak with Cocky Burke, his father's best friend. Cocky says that John Joe, a popular amateur balladeer, had a heart attack after English \"Teddy boys\" started a fight because he was singing an Irish rebel song, then punched and kicked him.

The villagers are Irish nationalists, taunting British soldiers from a nearby army camp. Tom Ryan publicly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, but secretly serves the British as an informer.\nRosy falls in love with the village schoolmaster, widower Charles Shaughnessy. She imagines, though he tries to convince her otherwise, that he will somehow add excitement to her life. They marry and settle in the schoolhouse, but he is a quiet man uninterested in physical love.\nMajor Randolph Doryan arrives in October 1917 to take command of the army camp. After winning a Victoria Cross on the Western Front, he has a crippled leg and is suffering from shell shock. When he visits the pub where Rosy is serving alone, he collapses under a flashback to the trenches and is comforted by her. The two kiss passionately until they are interrupted by the arrival of Ryan and others. Next day, the two ride to a forest for a passionate liaison and make love for the first time. Charles becomes suspicious of Rosy, but keeps his thoughts to himself.\nCharles takes his schoolchildren to the beach, where he notices Doryan's telltale footprints accompanied by a woman's in the sand. He tracks the prints to a cave and imagines Doryan and Rosy conducting an affair. Local halfwit Michael notices the footprints as well and searches the cave. Finding a button from Doryan's uniform, he pins it on his lapel and proudly parades through the village, but suffers abuse from the villagers. When Rosy comes riding past, Michael approaches her tenderly. Between Rosy's dismay and Michael's pantomime, the villagers surmise that she is having an affair with Doryan.\nOne night in January 1918, during a fierce storm, IRB leader Tim O'Leary and a small band of his men arrive in Ryan's pub seeking help to recover a shipment of German arms being floated from a ship towards the beach. Before they leave, they murder the police constable. When they leave, Ryan tips off the British. The entire village turns out to help the rebels, with Ryan the most outwardly devoted to the task, wading into the breakers repeatedly to salvage boxes of weapons and explosives. O'Leary is overwhelmed by Ryan's devotion, and the villagers are ebullient. They gleefully free the rebels' loaded truck from the wet sand and follow it up the hill. Doryan, waiting at the top with his troops, captures the men and arms. O'Leary makes a break, but Doryan climbs atop the truck and brings him down with a single rifle shot. Then he suffers a flashback and collapses. Rosy presses through the crowd in concern, outraging the villagers.\nCharles tells Rosy that he had let her affair run its course, hoping that the infatuation would pass, but now wants a separation. Rosy says the affair is over, but that night she leaves their bed in her nightdress to meet Doryan. In dismay, Charles wanders in his nightclothes to the beach, where the parish priest Father Collins finds him. The villagers storm into the schoolhouse and seize Rosy, convinced that she informed the British of the arms shipment. Ryan watches in shame and horror as his daughter takes the blame for his actions. The mob shears off her hair and strips off her clothes.\nDoryan walks along the beach and gives his cigarette case to Michael. In gratitude, Michael leads Doryan to a cache of arms, including dynamite, that was not recovered. After Michael runs off, Doryan commits suicide by detonating the explosives.

The chamber can be accessed only through the window, set high in his castle wall. It is not explained why his remains are at the castle or how he came to die there. Suddenly, a large bat flies in and hovers over the plinth, regurgitating blood onto the Count's remains. Almost immediately, the remains start to interact and bond with the dripped blood. Within seconds, Dracula is once more resurrected.\nSoon afterwards, local villagers are enraged that yet another young woman has been murdered by the Count. With a priest's blessing, they rise up and set fire to Dracula's castle. However, Dracula is safely asleep in his solid stone chamber. When the villagers return home, they find that every single woman in the village has been slaughtered in the church by vampire bats. Elsewhere, libertine Paul Carlson is falsely accused of rape and flees the Kleinenberg authorities by jumping into a nearby coach which, though driverless, heads off at great speed. After breaking through the border guard, he is knocked off the coach, and stumbles into an inn, persuading the waitress Julia to let him in. The innkeeper \u2013 the same man from the prologue \u2013 interrupts them though and throws Paul out. Walking in the forest, he finds the driverless coach of Dracula, which the returning Klove, Dracula's servant, drives back to the castle. Initially Paul is welcomed by the Count and a beautiful woman named Tania, who later reveals herself to be imprisoned by Dracula as his mistress. Paul later has a liaison with Tania, who concludes their lovemaking by trying to bite his neck. Dracula appears and, casually throwing off Paul's efforts to stop him, savagely stabs Tania through the heart with a silver dagger for betraying him. He then stoops over to drink the blood from the wounds of her dead body. Dracula's servant Klove dismembers her body and dissolves the pieces in a bath of acid. Locked in the room high in the castle, Paul uses tied-together bed curtains to climb down to a lower window, but the line is withdrawn by Klove and he finds himself in the Count's chamber.\nPaul's more sober brother Simon, and Simon's fianc\u00e9e Sarah Framsen, come searching for him.

Dracula immediately has designs on the lovely Sarah, but Klove, who has fallen in love with the young woman after seeing her photograph amongst Paul's possessions, helps the young couple escape by refusing to do Dracula's bidding and remove Sarah's crucifix. The servant pays a terrible price for his disobedience as he is sadistically burnt by Dracula with a red-hot cutlass. Simon, having enlisted the help of the village priest, goes back to the castle to look for Paul. However, the priest is attacked and killed by a large vampire bat, and Simon is betrayed by Klove, ending up in the same doorless, inescapable room as his brother.

Investigating the room further, he is horrified to find his brother's drained corpse on a spike. Looking out of the window, Simon is amazed to see the Count running up the wall outside like an insect.

Sarah, meanwhile, has made her way back to the castle battlements as a storm approaches. Suddenly, she is confronted by Dracula, who this time uses his bat familiar to remove her crucifix. Just then, Klove arrives on the battlements and attacks the Count with the dagger the vampire used to murder Tania, but the servant is hopelessly outmatched by the vampire's inhuman strength and is thrown over the side of the castle. Simon arrives on the scene, removes a loose metal spike from the castle's battlements, and throws it at Dracula, intending to pierce the vampire's heart.

Needing water and desert survival gear, one of the group, Tony (Lou Antonio), walks to the aircraft following the heading that would have been flown, hoping to find the aircraft and bring back much needed supplies. The aircraft had eventually crash landed in the Libyan desert.\nUnfortunately, when Tony arrives at the bomber and crawls underneath the tail to escape the sun, the tail, which has been hanging precariously, breaks away, instantly crushing him.  After several days beneath the relentless African sun, the remaining crewmen ultimately die of exposure.

Seeing the survey aircraft and realizing that they are soon about to \"have visitors\", the five remaining crew members' ghosts begin returning the aircraft to its state at the time of the crash, putting objects and artifacts in their original positions in hopes of convincing their visitors they had stayed with the aircraft and hopefully inducing them to search for their bodies.\nHaving survived the crash,  Hamner, who had remained in the military after the war and is now an Air Force brigadier general, is asked by investigators Lieutenant Colonel Josef Gronke (William Shatner) and Major Michael Devlin (Vince Edwards) to accompany their team to the remains of the B-25. Fearing disciplinary action and the end of his military career should the truth of his cowardice be found out, he tries to convince Gronke and Devlin that the entire crew bailed out over the Mediterranean with him and that the pilotless aircraft somehow flew on by itself. Although the discovery of a harmonica belonging to crewman Gant (Lawrence P. Casey) indicates that the crew did not bail out over the sea, the bodies are nowhere to be seen.\nUnable to find evidence to the contrary, the team has no choice but to accept Hamner's explanation, though Devlin is convinced that Hamner is lying, knowing firsthand the guilt over his own bad judgment when he crashed his military aircraft in California, killing some school children.  Devlin confronts an inebriated Hamner, who finally admits his actions, although he points out that pilot Mac (Patrick Wayne) had turned down navigator Hamner's heading to a Nazi occupied landing point, and then believed that the others had probably (and \"should have\") bailed out rather than flying on in the damaged aircraft.\nWhen Devlin returns to his tent, the ghosts of the crew make their appearance to Hamner, leading him to flee in panic across the desert in a jeep. Followed by the investigators, the chase ends with them arriving at the scene of an abandoned life raft (the crew having abandoned the aircraft in the darkness, convinced they were still over open water), revealing to the entire team what Hamner has already admitted to Devlin.\nThe heading to the life raft and an estimate of how long they could survive on foot helps the team find the missing bodies.

He joins the insurgent Tartars led by Feofar-Khan and undertakes Strogoff's same journey to learn the purpose of the Tsar's courier's mission.\nDuring the journey Strogoff makes the acquaintance of Nadja F\u00ebdorova, a young Latvian woman who intends to visit her husband Vasilij F\u00ebdor, a military doctor kept in prison in Irkutsk due to his socialist ideals. Believing that he would arouse less suspicion, Strogoff decides to share the journey with her. During a stop in an izba used as a place to rest and change horses, he meets Ogareff, in the uniform of a Russian officer, who aggressively and insolently demands the troika for the sleigh which would rightfully belong to Strogoff. In order not to blow his camouflage, he passively accepts the insults, arousing some suspicion in Nadja.\nArrived at Strogoff's family estate, Michael and Nadja spend a night of love and are awakened in the morning by Svetlana, wife of the sharecropper, who asks Michael about his life as an officer in St. Petersburg. He is forced to confess his true identity but Nadja, feeling deceived, rejects his apologies and sets off alone with the sled. However, she is soon captured by Ogareff and taken to the Tartar camp.\nOgareff learns from one of his companions that the merchant's real name is Strogoff and therefore he is the courier he is looking for; Michael is captured and tortured. Sangarre manages to find his mother, the Countess Marfa; after the Tartars promise not to kill her son, she reveals that their prisoner is indeed Captain Michael Strogoff. Sangarre discovers also the message in his belt containing the information of reinforcements being sent to the Grand Duke. Ogareff keeps his word and does not kill the officer but blinds him by holding a red-hot saber to her eyes; Marfa, unable to bear her pain, falls dead.\nFeofar Khan is undecided whether to move towards Moscow or continue towards Irkutsk but Ogareff believes that the capital is too far away and suggests occupying Irkutsk and capturing the Grand Duke. Meanwhile, Michael wanders blind among the beggars but is found by Nadja, and both join a group of refugees led by a priest who try to escape the war by crossing the Angara; during the journey, Michael regains his sight.\nOgareff, informed by Sangarre that the following day the Grand Duke's troops will leave the city in search of them, arrives in Irkutsk under the false guise of Captain Strogoff and carries out the plan agreed with Feofar Khan. However, Michael meets a squad of Russian soldiers and reveals his identity; he is taken to the army camp and then leads them to block the Tartar army. Feofar Khan attacks the Russian troops anyways, but his cavalry is decimated. What remains of the cavalry, led by Ogareff, is attacked from behind by Strogoff's reinforcements and during the battle Sangarre dies.

His commanding officer, Captain John G. Nolan, unexpectedly cancels his leave and informs Lawson that he is to be assigned to a British infantry commando unit in the New Hebrides Islands for a combat mission.\nThe British base is in the middle of a large open field, several hundred yards from the edge of the jungle; on the other side of the jungle is a Japanese observation and communications post. Shortly after Lawson's arrival at the base, a patrol of British soldiers sprint out of the jungle and across the open field, pursued by the Japanese. The base commander, Col. Thompson, instructs his men to keep well back, out of enemy range; they watch as the patrol are cut down by Japanese rifle fire.\nLawson's commando group is instructed to destroy the Japanese radio transmitter to prevent them from sounding the alarm about an American naval convoy which is scheduled to appear on the horizon in three days. The post's radio operator transmits an \"all's well\" signal every night at midnight; it will be Lawson's job to transmit a fake signal (in Japanese) to buy the Allies another 24 hours.\nThe commando group is led by Captain Hornsby, an upper class officer with a history of foolhardiness. The other members of the squad are draftees from Singapore whose enthusiasm for fighting leaves something to be desired: Pte. Tosh Hearne, a cynical Cockney who is also the squad's medic; Pte. Jock Thornton, a lean Scot whom Lawson at first considers slightly cracked for skipping on patrol and singing the \"Teddy Bears' Picnic\", Pte. Campbell, a fat Glaswegian; grey-haired Sergeant Johnstone; Signalman Scott the radio operator; Pte. Griffiths, Pte. Rogers, Pte. Currie,Pte. Connolly, Cpl. McLean, and Pte. Riddle.\nBy the time the squad reaches the Japanese post, Riddle, Connolly, and Currie are dead from a botched ambush \u2014 which, Hearne mutters to Lawson, was entirely due to Hornsby's incompetence: they were positioned on both sides of the trail, and the dead men seem to have been the victims of friendly fire. When Johnstone is wounded in another encounter, Hornsby leaves him behind; shortly thereafter, Johnstone is discovered by the Japanese and his throat slit.\nAfter Scott drops and breaks the radio Lawson was to use, Hornsby decides to use the Japanese radio. Lawson flatly refuses to take part in any such scheme, giving the excuse that Hornsby is disobeying their orders with this extemporization. Nevertheless, Hornsby walks boldly into the Japanese camp and enters the radio hut without being spotted; he knocks out the radio operator and motions to Lawson and Scott. Scott goes to the hut, but despite Hearne's urgings, Lawson refuses to go. The Japanese radio operator comes to, and in the ensuing fracas, both Scott and Hornsby are killed.\nLawson is now the ranking officer, with only Hearne, Campbell, Jock, Griffiths, and McLean left alive \u2014 and Jock has been wounded in the debacle. Japanese Major Yamaguchi is determined to stop them from reporting the existence of the secret Japanese airfield and planes they have discovered. Through loudspeakers in the trees, Yamaguchi exhorts the men to give themselves up. Lawson and Hearne agree that Yamaguchi is not to be trusted, but Campbell is in favour of surrender, and he works at Griffiths as Jock weakens. Finally, while Lawson and Hearne are asleep, Campbell tries to sneak off into the jungle; but Jock spots him and asks where he is going. Campbell strangles Jock, wakes Griffiths and McLean, and the three of them run off.\nYamaguchi attempts to use the lives of Griffiths and McLean as bargaining chips. (Campbell, on the other hand, is killed in gruesome fashion after the Japanese discover he has a ring taken from the finger of one of the officers the patrol ambushed.) As Lawson and Hearne reach the edge of the open field adjacent to the British base, Yamaguchi announces that they have three minutes to surrender; Japanese soldiers have the field covered with rifles and machine guns. Hearne suggests that they give Yamaguchi a taste of his own medicine. They double back and shoot him. They then sprint out across the field. Despite cover fire from the base, first one, then the other is hit.\nOne of them rises and staggers to safety. It is Hearne.

After turning bitter water sweet by stirring it with a branch, \"El Topo\" names the woman Marah. In need of food and water, \"El Topo\" spaces Marah's feet apart and digs up eggs from the sand beneath them, then utters a prayer before shooting a rock, which then releases water. When Marah tries these same techniques, she turns up nothing, seeming to lack \"El Topo\"'s faith. After \"El Topo\" tears her clothes and apparently rapes her, Marah promptly becomes able to find eggs and water. She tells \"El Topo\" she will not return his love unless he proves himself the best gun-fighter by defeating the desert's four great gun masters. Each gun master represents a particular religion or philosophy and \"El Topo\" learns from each of them before instigating a duel. \"El Topo\" is victorious each time, not through superior skill but through trickery or luck.\nAfter the first duel, a black-clad woman who speaks with a man's voice finds the couple and guides them to the remaining gun masters. As he kills each master, \"El Topo\" has increasing doubts about his mission, but Marah persuades him to continue. After the final gun master outsmarts \"El Topo\" by killing himself before \"El Topo\" is able to kill him, \"El Topo\" becomes ridden with guilt, destroys his own gun and revisits the places where he killed the masters, finding their corpses either on fire, covered with geometrical objects, or swarming with bees.

Marah then rides off with the woman, while \"El Topo\" collapses and is carried away by a group of deformed people.\n\"El Topo\" awakens many years later in a cave to find that the tribe of deformed outcasts have taken care of him and come to regard him as a god-like figure while he has been asleep and meditating on the gun masters' \"four lessons\". The outcasts dwell in a system of caves which have been blocked in \u2014 the only exit is out of their reach due to their deformities. When \"El Topo\" awakens, he is \"born again\" and decides to help the outcasts escape. He is able to reach the exit and, together with a dwarf girl who becomes his lover, performs for the depraved cultists of the neighboring town to raise money for dynamite to assist in digging a tunnel on one side of the mountain where the outcasts have effectively been kept imprisoned.\nHijo, now a young monk, arrives in the town to be the new priest, but is disgusted by the religion the cultists practice \u2013 notably symbolized by the frequent display of a basic line drawing of the Eye of Providence \u2013 and their violent preoccupation with guns, from their church \"ritual\" through to the film's bloody climax. Despite \"El Topo\"'s great change in appearance, Hijo recognizes him and intends to kill him on the spot, but agrees to wait until he has succeeded in freeing the outcasts. Now wearing his father's black gunfighter clothes, Hijo grows impatient at the time the project is taking, and begins to work alongside \"El Topo\" to hasten the moment when he will kill him. At the point when Hijo is ready to give up on finishing the tunnel, \"El Topo\" breaks through into the cave. The tunnel has been completed, but Hijo finds that he cannot bring himself to kill his father.\nThe outcasts come streaming out, but as they enter the town they are shot down by the cultists. \"El Topo\" helplessly witnesses the community being slaughtered and is shot himself.

Influential Japanese army figures and politicians push through an alliance with Germany and Italy in September 1940 despite opposition from the Japanese navy and prepare for war. The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, reluctantly plans a pre-emptive strike on the U.S. Pacific Fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, believing that Japan's best hope of controlling the Pacific Ocean is to quickly annihilate the American fleet. Air Staff Officer Minoru Genda is chosen to mastermind the operation while his old Naval Academy classmate Mitsuo Fuchida is selected to lead the attack.\nMeanwhile, in Washington, U.S. military intelligence has broken the Japanese Purple Code, allowing them to intercept secret Japanese radio transmissions indicating increased Japanese naval activity. Monitoring the transmissions are U.S. Army Col. Bratton and U.S. Navy Lt. Commander Kramer. At Pearl Harbor itself, Admiral Kimmel increases defensive naval and air patrols around Hawaii which could provide early warning of enemy presence. General Short recommends concentrating aircraft at the base on the runways to avoid sabotage by enemy agents in Hawaii, so General Howard Davidson of the 14th Pursuit Wing tries dispersing some of the planes to other airfields on Oahu to maintain air readiness.\nSeveral months pass while diplomatic tensions escalate. As the Japanese ambassador to Washington continues negotiations to stall for time, the large Japanese fleet sorties into the Pacific. On the day of the attack, Bratton and Kramer learn from intercepts that the Japanese plan a series of 14 radio messages from Tokyo to the Japanese embassy in Washington. They are also directed to destroy their code machines after receiving the final message. Deducing the Japanese intention to launch a surprise attack immediately after the messages are delivered, Bratton tries warning his superiors of his suspicions but encounters several obstacles: Chief of Naval Operations Harold R. Stark is indecisive over notifying Hawaii without first alerting the President while Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall's order that Pearl Harbor be alerted of an impending attack is stymied by poor atmospherics that prevent radio transmission and by bungling when a warning sent by telegram is not marked urgent. At dawn on December 7, the Japanese fleet launches its aircraft. Their approach to Hawaii is detected by two radar operators but their concerns are dismissed by the duty officer. Similarly the claim by the destroyer USS Ward to have sunk a Japanese miniature submarine off the entrance to Pearl Harbor is dismissed as unimportant. The Japanese thus achieve complete and total surprise and Commander Fuchida sends the code to begin the attack: \"Tora! Tora! Tora!\"\nThe damage to the naval base is catastrophic and casualties are severe. Seven battleships are either sunk or heavily damaged. General Short's anti-sabotage precautions prove a disastrous mistake that allows the Japanese aerial forces to destroy aircraft on the ground easily. Hours after the attack ends, General Short and Admiral Kimmel receive Marshall's telegram warning of impending danger. In Washington, Secretary of State Cordell Hull is stunned to learn of the attack and urgently requests confirmation before receiving the Japanese ambassador. The message that was transmitted to the Japanese embassy in 14 parts \u2013 including a declaration that peace negotiations were at an end \u2013 was meant to be delivered to the Americans at 1:00 pm in Washington, 30 minutes before the attack. However, it was not decoded and transcribed in time, meaning the attack started while the two nations were technically still at peace. The distraught Japanese ambassador, helpless to explain the late ultimatum and unaware of the ongoing attack, is bluntly rebuffed by Hull.\nBack in the Pacific, the Japanese fleet commander, Vice-Admiral Ch\u016bichi Nagumo, refuses to launch a scheduled third wave of aircraft for fear of exposing his force to U.S. submarines. Aboard his flagship, Admiral Yamamoto solemnly informs his staff that their primary target \u2013 the American aircraft carriers \u2013 were not at Pearl Harbor, having departed days previously to search for Japanese vessels.

She reveals before dying that a fortune in jewels had been hidden from the Bolsheviks by being sewn into the seat cushion of one of the twelve chairs from the family's dining room set. After hearing the dying woman's confession, the Russian Orthodox priest Father Fyodor, who had arrived to  administer the last rites, decides to abandon the Church and attempt to steal the treasure for himself. Shortly afterwards in the town of Stargorod, where Vorobyaninov's former mansion is located, a homeless con-artist, Ostap Bender, meets the dispossessed nobleman and manipulates his way into a partnership in his search for the family riches.\nThe chairs, along with all other private property, had been appropriated by the State after the Russian Revolution. Vorobyaninov and Bender set off together to locate the chairs and recover the fortune, but are stymied by a series of false leads and other trying events. They find that the chairs have been split up and sold individually. Therefore, their hunt requires a great deal of travel to track down and open up each piece of the set in order to eliminate it as a possible location of the booty. As they progress, they meet comrades from every walk of life in Soviet Russian society, transforming the film into a satirical send up of failing Communism.\nBy posing as the official in charge of the Department of Chairs, Bender tricks Father Fyodor into a wild goose chase to recover a similar set of eleven chairs in the possession of an engineer in a remote province in Siberia. Father Fyodor makes the long journey only to be thrown out of the engineer's house. When the engineer is reassigned to a post on the Black Sea, Fyodor follows him and buys the counterfeit chairs (on the condition that the engineer and his wife never see him again). He finds that none of the chairs has the jewels. Later, he runs across Vorobyaninov and Bender after they have retrieved one chair from a circus, and while being chased by them frantically climbs with the chair straight up the side of a mountain.  After finding out that this chair doesn't contain the jewels, he finds that he is unable to get down again without help. Vorobyaninov and Bender leave him to his fate.\nAfter traveling many miles and perpetrating numerous cons to pay for the lengthy enterprise, the two men return to Moscow where they discover the last chair; because the others contained no hidden treasure, this one must contain it all. It is located in a Palace of Culture, which is inconvenient due to the presence of so many witnesses. Vorobyaninov and Bender return after closing time, entering through a window Bender secretly had unlocked earlier.\nAt the moment of discovery, Bender carefully and quietly opens the chair cushion with his knife, but their hopes are dashed as it is found to be completely empty. Vorobyaninov is stunned and angry, but Bender laughs at the absurdity of the situation. A watchman finds them, and Vorobyaninov demands to know what happened to the jewels. \"Look around you,\" the watchman answers, explaining that after the jewels were accidentally found, they were used to finance construction of the grand building in which they stand. Driven into a sudden rage, Vorobyaninov smashes the chair to pieces and assaults the officer whom the watchman has summoned. After admonishing him for hitting a policeman, Bender leads the way and they escape into the night.\nAt the end of his patience, demoralized and bankrupted, Bender proposes that he and Vorobyaninov go their separate ways. In a desperate attempt to keep Bender from leaving, Vorobyaninov flings the remains of the last chair into the air, and collapses to the ground feigning an epileptic seizure; this is an act they had previously rehearsed as part of a con.
