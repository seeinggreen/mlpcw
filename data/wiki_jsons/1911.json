At the last settlement, visited by the two, the old man, who has a weakness for drink, purchases several bottles of [whiskey], which he begins drinking when they have made camp for the night. A lone cowboy calls upon them and finds the old man in a jovial mood and cautions him to beware: of a hostile tribe of Indians, through whose country they are now traveling. Unmindful of the warning, Lee continues to drink until thoroughly intoxicated, despite the pleadings of his daughter. Suddenly, over the brow of a hill a scouting Indian is seen to appear, sees the wagon and the drunken white, and slipping cautiously away, goes to his Indian village where he informs the other braves of the trespassing settlers. The Indians leap astride their shaggy ponies and with war whoops ride off to make short work of the whites. The girl sees them coming and implores her father to get into the wagon, but he refuses and the girl, knowing that she must act quickly if she would save her own life, springs into the wagon, seizes the reins and urges the horses to their utmost speed. After a long and thrilling ride in which the Indians gradually gain on her, she is joined by the friendly cowboy, who sends a crony who was with him, to a neighboring ranch for help. The girl and cowboy race the Indians and pull up at a deserted shack in which they protect themselves against the Indians until the arrival of the ranchmen, who disperse the Indians. The girl expresses her great joy at being rescued and upon proposal of her cowboy protector that she marry him, she readily agrees.\"", "tmdb_id": 929853}, "45059317": {"title": "Adrift (1911 film)", "plot": "An official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World states: \"Jack Thorne, a young artist, finds his efforts unappreciated, and he and his wife and little daughter are on the verge of starvation. The final blow comes when his last painting, on which he had built much hope, was rejected by a rich man, whom an artist chum kindly brought to the impoverished studio. Jack decides that he can struggle no longer. Unseen by his wife, he picks up his revolver, puts it in his pocket and goes out, intending to end everything. But his little daughter has watched him; she follows him and stays his hand. Her prayers and entreaties bring him to a realization of what his rash act would mean to the two helpless ones that would be left behind. Penitent and remorseful, he accompanies his child back to their poor home. There he confesses to his wife that it was only the child's timely interference that saved him from ending it all. The mother drops on her knees beside her child, and clasping her in her arms, raises grateful eyes to Heaven in a prayer of thankfulness. Jack, looking up suddenly, sees the beautiful group of mother and child, with a light as if from Heaven upon them. Realizing that [this] is the inspiration and subject for which he has sought in vain, he calls for them not to move, and at once begins his great painting of them, which brings him fame and wealth.\"\"But with wealth, the artist becomes dissatisfied with his wife, and is infatuated with a beautiful society woman whose portrait he is painting. The couple, happy in poverty, are now rapidly drifting on the shoals of matrimonial disaster, but the child saves them. She is weeping one day when Miss Brent, the society woman, enters the room. Miss Brent, who has never seen the child before, asks the cause of her sorrow, and tries to comfort her. The child tells her, and Julia's heart is touched. Though she has contempt[u]ously ignored the wife, she feels that she cannot ruin the life of the helpless child, even to win the artist's love. On the spur of the moment, she writes a farewell note to Jack, and gives it to the child, saying that it will cure all her sorrow. Then she goes out of their lives forever. Jack realizes, when he sees that his child is the messenger, why Julia has broken with him. An outsider had made a sacrifice to save the future of little Marie, when he, her father, who had always loved her, had selfishly forgotten his duty. Remorsefully, he tears up the letter, and destroys the painting, not angrily, but as a symbol that he had cast the original out of his life. Then he makes peace with his wife and daughter, who are joyfully ready to forgive, and tells them that their love will keep him [on] the right path for the rest of his life, and that the lesson he has been taught will never be forgotten.\""}, "68060139": {"title": "The Adventures of Pinocchio (1911 film)", "plot": "Geppetto carves Pinocchio from a large piece of wood.

Beamish is preparing to leave the country with Fanny Power, whom he plans to marry the following night before they embark for France together. He gives part of the stolen money as a wedding present to his foster-sister Arrah Meelish, who has been sheltering him at her peril, unbeknown to her fianc\u00e9, Shaun, and to Fanny.\nFeeny, who wants Arrah for himself, visits her the next morning - the morning of her wedding day; she rejects him and he swears to see her humbled in time. Arrah is provoked into showing Feeny the money, who recognizes it as his own; he then catches a glimpse of Beamish concealed in the barn. Next we discover that Colonel O'Grady, the local magistrate, is in love with Fanny and has procured a pardon for Beamish. This was Fanny's condition for marrying him, but now that she and Beamish are planning to flee together, she asks him to tear it up. However, Fanny learns that Arrah got her nickname \"Arrah of the kiss\" when she previously helped Beamish escape from prison by concealing a message in her mouth and passing it to him in a kiss; she begins to doubt Beamish's feelings for herself. Enter Feeny to report that he has been robbed, and that Arrah has the money and is giving shelter to the rebel Mac Coul.\nMeanwhile, Arrah and Shaun have gotten married and a party is held in the barn, which culminates in Shaun singing \"The Wearing of the Green\". When a contingent of English soldiers arrives under the command of Major Coffin and accompanied by the O'Grady, Fanny and Feeney, Beamish, who had been hiding in the loft, escapes through a trapdoor in the roof. Arrah is forced to produce the money, but refuses to explain, even when evidence of Beamish's stay in the barn is found. Arrah is arrested. The first act ends with Shaun confessing to the robbery to save Arrah's life.\nBelieving Beamish to have been unfaithful to her, Fanny does not meet him at the appointed place for their wedding. Beamish learns what has happened and resolves to give himself up to the Secretary of State in Dublin and get Shaun and Arrah pardoned. Fanny again offers O'Grady her hand, this time on the condition that he will save Shaun's life.\nShaun is visited in prison by Fanny and Arrah. He learns the identity of the man Arrah was protecting, and rejoices to see his implicit trust in her vindicated, putting Fanny's lack of faith to shame. The climax of the second act is an uproarious court scene, during which the O'Grady unsuccessfully tries to convince the court of Shaun's innocence. Shaun is sentenced to death for conspiracy to rebellion and robbery.\nIn Act 3, the Secretary of State is visited by a succession of people on Shaun's behalf - Beamish Mac Coul, the O'Grady, and Fanny. Beamish and Shaun are pardoned, Beamish and Fanny reunited, and the O'Grady rushes off to prevent Shaun's execution.

The motion picture's opening scenes, according to plot descriptions in those publications, portrayed Lord Nelson (Sydney Booth) at the Board of Admiralty in London in the weeks prior to the conflict. There he reveals his \"wonderful plan of attack\" against the French fleet, which was supported by warships of its Spanish ally. After discussing the daring plan, Nelson and his fellow officers raise their drinking glasses to toast King George III and Britain's anticipated success against French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte's naval forces.\nThe photoplay then shifted to scenes at sea aboard HMS Victory, Nelson's flagship. It is the day before the battle and officers are writing letters, perhaps their final messages, to their families and sweethearts. Lieutenant Prescott (Herbert Prior) is shown writing his fianc\u00e9e (Laura Sawyer), who appears as a vision with \"beautiful scenic and photographic effect\". Advancing to the next day, the film depicted Nelson making a final entry in his personal diary and later on Victory bidding farewell to Captain Hardy (James Gordon) and other officers once the long line of enemy vessels is sighted on the horizon. Next, \"splendidly portrayed\" in the film, signal flags are hoisted aloft to relay the admiral's own simple but inspiring message to his crews across the British fleet: \"England expects that every man will do his duty\". Scenes then transitioned to the flagship's decks being cleared for action, followed by footage showing the battle itself with \"the firing of the guns\", \"ships caught on fire\", and close-up views of the battered Victory. While the battle is raging, Nelson and Hardy are openly and calmly walking on the quarter deck giving commands. Suddenly, Nelson drops to his knees, struck down by a musket ball shot by a sniper aboard the adjacent French warship Redoubtable. Mortally wounded, Lord Nelson is quickly carried below decks to the ship's cockpit.

Marie, the 'little mother,' anxious that her home may not be broken up, calls on one of her mother's employers and requests that she be given a chance to take the dead woman's place. The artist, a wealthy, good-hearted man, pleased with the child's pluck, laughingly employs her, and makes her believe that she is really doing all the 'chores.' The artist's kindness, much to his surprise, brings him recompense one thousand fold [sic]. One of his models plots to fleece him. She calls at his studio, faints in his arms, and when her confederate rushes in with a policeman, she makes charges that lead to the arrest of the innocent artist. Just as the policeman is leading her benefactor away, the little scrub woman sees what is happening. She follows the party to the police station, but is afraid to enter. When the complainant and her husband come out, the child is impressed with the fact that they seem to be on the best of terms. Her suspicions are aroused, and she shadows them like a regular detective. What crook would ever imagine that a little girl, wheeling a baby carriage, was a sleuth? This pair certainly did not, for when they meet a new friend in the park, they stop to tell him how they successfully arranged to trim a rich artist, never doubting that he would pay liberally to have the case dropped. The little girl, from her place in hiding, heard the story. So the little girl found a policeman, and told him about it. And the policeman went with her to the hiding place, and heard enough to warrant him in making what he afterward described as a 'two handed collar.' The adventurous and her confederate were hailed to the police station and locked up, while the artist was set free in a hurry.
