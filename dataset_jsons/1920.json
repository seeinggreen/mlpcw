When a dazed woman passes them, Francis explains she is his \"fianc\u00e9e\" Jane and that they have suffered a great ordeal. Most of the rest of the film is a flashback of Francis' story, which takes place in Holstenwall, a shadowy village of twisted buildings and spiraling streets. Francis and his friend Alan, who are good-naturedly competing for Jane's affections, plan to visit the town fair. Meanwhile, a mysterious man named Dr. Caligari seeks a permit from the rude town clerk to present a spectacle at the fair, which features Cesare, a somnambulist. The clerk mocks and berates Caligari, but ultimately approves the permit. That night, the clerk is stabbed to death in his bed.\nThe next morning, Francis and Alan visit Caligari's sideshow attraction, where he opens a coffin-like box to reveal the sleeping Cesare. On Caligari's order, Cesare awakens and answers questions from the audience. Despite Francis' protests, Alan asks, \"How long shall I live?\" To Alan's horror, Cesare answers, \"The time is short. You die at dawn!\" Later that night, a figure breaks into Alan's home and stabs him to death in his bed. A grief-stricken Francis investigates Alan's murder with help from Jane and her father, Dr. Olsen, who obtains police authorization to investigate the somnambulist. That night, the police apprehend a criminal in possession of a knife who is caught attempting to murder an elderly woman. When questioned by Francis and Dr. Olsen, the criminal confesses he tried to kill the elderly woman, but denies any part in the two previous deaths; he was merely taking advantage of the situation to divert blame away from himself.\nAt night, Francis spies on Caligari and observes what appears to be Cesare sleeping in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window onto the street. Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis confirms that the criminal who confessed to the elderly woman's murder is still locked away and could not have been Jane's attacker. Francis and the police investigate Caligari's sideshow and discover that the \"Cesare\" sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows him and sees Caligari go into an insane asylum.\nUpon further investigation, Francis is shocked to learn that Caligari is the asylum's director. With help from the asylum staff, Francis studies the director's records and diary while the director is sleeping. The writings reveal his obsession with the story of an 18th-century mystic named Caligari, who used a somnambulist named Cesare to commit murders in northern Italian towns. The director, attempting to understand the earlier Caligari, experiments on a somnambulist admitted to the asylum, who becomes his Cesare. The asylum director screams, \"I must become Caligari!\" Francis and the doctors call the police to Caligari's office, where they show him Cesare's corpse. Caligari then attacks one of the staff.

When he is not treating the poor in his free clinic, he is in his laboratory experimenting. Sir George Carew (Brandon Hurst), the father of Jekyll\u2019s fianc\u00e9 Millicent (Martha Mansfield), is suspicious of the young doctor\u2019s intentions and often irritated by his tardiness and highmindedness. \"No man\", Carew observes, \"could be as good as he looks.\" Following dinner one evening, Carew taunts his prospective son-in-law in front of their mutual friends and debates with him about the causes and effects of a person's personality, insisting that every man is fundamentally composed of two \"selves\" who are in continual conflict. \"A man cannot destroy the savage in him by denying its impulses\", instructs Carew. \"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.\"\n\nReflecting on Sir George's comments, Jekyll begins his research and experiments into separating the two basic natures of man, the good and the evil. Finally, after much trial and error, he develops a potion that rapidly transforms him into a hideous, evil counterpart, a man he refers to as Edward Hyde. When in the form and consciousness of Hyde, Jekyll is not recognizable as himself, so to facilitate his bad side's access to his own home and adjacent laboratory, the doctor informs his trusty servant Poole (George Stevens) that Mr. Hyde is to have \"full authority and liberty\" at the residence.\n\nUtilizing his potion, Jekyll literally begins to live a double life: the compassionate and gentlemanly doctor by day, and the lustful, hunchbacked \"creature\" who ventures out largely at night.

He rents a small furnished room in the area and brings Gina (Nita Naldi), a young woman and exotic dancer, to live with him. Soon, however, Hyde tires of her company and forces her to leave.\nAlthough Jekyll has developed a counter-potion that transforms Hyde back to the doctor\u2019s original appearance and character, each time he takes the potion to become Hyde, the beast becomes increasingly more vile and physically more hideous. Meanwhile, Millicent worries about the absence of her fianc\u00e9, so Sir George calls on Jekyll, but the young man is not at home. Sir George then encounters Hyde in a nearby street, where the brute has just knocked a small boy to the ground and injured him. To make recompense for his actions, he goes and gets a check which he returns to the boy's father. Carew notices that the check has been signed by Dr. Jekyll. He confronts Poole, who tells him the story of Edward Hyde.\nHyde now returns to the lab; drinks the counter-potion and changes once again into his original form. Sir George finds the transformed Jekyll in the lab and demands to know about his relationship with Mr. Hyde, threatening to break off his daughter\u2019s engagement to the doctor if he does not answer his questions. The threat enrages Jekyll, so much so that the stress itself triggers his retransformation to Hyde. Horrified in witnessing the change, Sir George flees out of the lab, but Hyde catches him in the courtyard and beats him to death with his stout, club-like walking stick. Hyde then runs to his apartment and destroys any evidence there that might link him to Jekyll. After barely avoiding the police, the creature returns to the lab, where he drinks the counter-potion and reverts to Jekyll.\nIn the ensuing days, while Millicent mourns over her father\u2019s murder, Jekyll is tormented by the thoughts of his misdeeds as Hyde. Soon, the ingredient needed to make the counter-potion is depleted and cannot be found in all of London. Jekyll therefore confines himself to his locked lab, fearing he might become Hyde at any moment. Millicent finally goes to see him, but as she knocks on the lab's door, he begins transforming into Hyde. Before he opens the door, Jekyll consumes poison in a ring he wears, one that he had taken from Gina. Now fully transformed into Hyde, he lets Millicent in, locks the door, and grabs her in his arms. Suddenly, he starts convulsing. Millicent runs from the lab and her shouts for help attract Poole, Jekyll's longtime friend Dr. Richard Lanyon, and another friend, John Utterson.

The three men wait outside the church until the verger calls them in, one by one, to deliver their trial sermons.\nThe first candidate delivers a sermon on the creation story that promptly puts the entire congregation to sleep. The second candidate is summoned and announces that his sermon topic is \"Balaam's ass and God's strange power by which He was able to open the jaws of a dumb animal so that it might speak like a man!\" (Numbers 22:28-30)\nThe verger comes out to summon S\u00f6fren and finds him doing handstands. S\u00f6fren bounds into the church, surveys the congregation and begins:\n\"Now, two learned applicants have appeared here before me. One of them took us to Eden, and that is as far back as we can go. Let him stay there! The other one chose the text: Am I Not An Ass? But what has an ass to do on the pulpit? My friends, I will not take you to Eden -- you are too clever. But I will take you to the bowels of the earth, deep in the roaring jaws of Hell!\" The congregation is enthralled by S\u00f6fren's \"fire and brimstone\" sermon.

The church committee announces that S\u00f6fren is their choice for pastor. The committee spokesman then adds that Margarete Pedersdotter, the widow of the previous pastor, has exercised her right to demand that her husband's successor marry her.\nDame Margarete, who is at least a half-century older than S\u00f6fren, enters the room. The two pastoral candidates from Copenhagen bolt from the room, hastily climb on their horses and gallop away.\nMargarete doesn't take a seat near S\u00f6fren but chooses to sit next to the fireplace. Gradually the townspeople also leave the dining hall. After a lengthy period of silence, Margarete approaches S\u00f6fren and asks, in that it has grown dark outside, if he would walk with her to the parsonage.\nWhen they reach the parsonage, Margarete invites S\u00f6fren inside. As S\u00f6fren takes note of the fine furnishings, Magarete lays out another repast, which S\u00f6fren devours greedily despite having just come from the town dinner. While he is eating, Margarete asks S\u00f6fren if he has a fiancee. S\u00f6fren hesitates, then assures her that he does not.\nMargarete mentions that it is much too late for S\u00f6fren to head back to the inn and suggests he stay in an upstairs room. The next morning S\u00f6fren puts on a fine suit of clothes, far superior to his own garments, that was laid out by his bed during the night. S\u00f6fren goes downstairs. Margarete is sewing and the table has been set with a fine breakfast of herring, bread and butter, and a canister of schnapps.\nAfter S\u00f6fren finishes the schnapps, Margarete takes on the appearance of a smiling 20-year-old. Margarete asks if he would like to marry her; S\u00f6fren replies in the affirmative. Margarete calls in her two servants from the next room as witnesses of S\u00f6fren's proposal. Margarete assures S\u00f6fren they will have separate sleeping quarters and maintain separate lives.\nS\u00f6fren leaves to tell Mari what has happened, and Margarete follows at a distance.

S\u00f6fren replies that Mari is his sister and asks that she be allowed to stay in the parsonage, to which Margarete assents.\nS\u00f6fren and Margarete are married. The next morning, S\u00f6fren is upset when Margarete's female servant shakes debris from a rug on him from a balcony. Margarete's male servant gives S\u00f6fren a raspberry when asked to stop whistling.\nS\u00f6fren confronts Margarete: \"In the future, I suggest you and your companions be less high and mighty.

I am master of this house!\"\nS\u00f6fren makes several unsuccessful attempts to have time alone with Mari. One day he notices Margarete climb the ladder to the loft of the barn. S\u00f6fren removes the ladder, hoping to trap Margarete in the loft, and goes in search of Mari. Mari, however, is also in the loft, and she starts to climb down without noticing that the ladder has been moved. Mari falls to the ground and S\u00f6fren rushes over and calls up a warning to Margarete: \"Be careful, Dame Margarete! The ladder is gone!\"\nS\u00f6fren carried Mari into the house and learns that she has broken a thigh bone and suffered a concussion but will recover.\nMargarete takes on the role of Mari's nurse and, in return, S\u00f6fren begins to grow fond of Margarete.\nOne day, as Margarete and S\u00f6fren sit by Mari's bedside, Margarete confesses: \"My first husband and I were engaged for many years when he applied for the post here and learned he could have it only if he wedded the parson's widow. We knew that the widow was weak and could scarcely live long. It was a sore temptation to us. God forgive us ... we built our happiness on the hope of another's death.\"\nThat prompted S\u00f6fren to confess: \"Mari and I are not sister and brother -- she is my fiancee. We have also waited for your death, Dame Margarete.\"\nMargarete appears to have initially been taken aback, then her face softens and she murmurs \"Poor children!\"\nFrom that moment, S\u00f6fren and Mari have no trouble spending time together and Margarete spends most of her time in the churchyard, visiting her husband's grave.\nOne morning Margarete does not come down to breakfast.
