When her little brother Billie (Raymond Hackett) asks John why his sister is so sad, the man blames the \"Ringtailed Rhinoceros\". The boy is confused by that answer, but he vows to kill the beast. Soon, though, the rhino leads John once again to alcohol and this time to the destruction of his wedding plans. Intoxicated, John arrives late to a lawn party where he and Marybelle were to announce their betrothal. The invited guests have departed; Marybelle is humiliated; and her furious parents (Herbert Fortier and Ida Waterman) cancel the engagement.\nJohn's break-up with Marybelle devastates him.

Trilby and Billee fall in love, but their happiness is thwarted by an evil mesmerist named Svengali, who becomes obsessed with having Trilby for himself. On the night Little Billee is to propose to Trilby, Svengali kidnaps her via hypnotism and takes her away with him to England where he uses his supernatural powers to turn her into a talented singer. Svengali must use all his will power to maintain a hold over the girl, and the stress begins to take a toll on his heart. When he suffers an attack, Trilby appears to become her old self again, but when he recovers, she lapses back into zombie mode. Svengali finally dies, and Trilby's voice reverts to her former gruff form, and the audience boos her off the stage (in the redone ending). Trilby returns to normalcy and the last scene shows her reunited with her friends with a smile on her lips. The title card reads \"A promise of good old times again\".\nThe original version of the film had Trilby dying during the last scene (as it occurs in the novel), and this version premiered in New York City at the 44th Street Theatre on September 6, 1915. It went into general release on September 20, 1915, with her death scene intact. In 1917, when the film was re-released, the ending was altered with newly filmed footage so that Trilby remained alive in the film's finale. So technically, two different versions of this film existed.", "tmdb_plot": "A hypnotic Svengali controls the singing voice of a young starlet, but he cannot control her heart.

Mabel motions to him to come sit with them. After sneaking a few quick kisses with Mabel, Fatty takes her away so they can spend time together, leaving Mama alone on the bench.Elsewhere, a strolling \"Keystone Cop\" encounters a man sleeping on another park bench. The policeman uses his nightstick and foot to chase away the loiterer, who promptly spies Mama sitting by herself. Clearly an experienced thief, he sidles up to her and uses a small pair of scissors to steal a ladies' pocket-style watch suspended from her neck by a long ribbon. The thief hastily departs with the watch. Once Mama notices her timepiece is missing, she yells for help, which rouses the policeman, who is dozing on the same bench from which he had chased the thief. The officer runs to the distraught woman, feigns interest in her plight, but returns to the bench to resume his nap.Fatty and Mabel meanwhile are playing hide-and-seek along the park's lakeside and battling a bee that has landed on Mabel's nose. Not far away, the thief admires the pilfered watch and then puts it in his trousers' pocket, which apparently has a hole, for the watch exits the cuff of his trousers and drops to the ground. The crook ambles away, unaware of the loss of his ill-gotten gain. Fatty soon finds the watch while Mabel is close by playfully splashing lake water.

Elated, Mabel does not recognize the watch even though Fatty pins it to the lapel of her dress using a small piece of Mama's ribbon still attached to the timepiece's top metal loop or \"bow\".While Fatty leaves to buy sweets at a concession stand, the passing thief notices Mabel wearing \"his\" watch after realizing he had lost it. A struggle for the watch ensues. Fatty hears the ruckus and rushes to Mabel's aid as Mama also arrives and sees her stolen property. Fatty and the thief frantically pass the watch back and forth to one another, each man disavowing any connection to it. Mama then reclaims the watch, recognizes the thief, and calls again for help. The snoozing officer, who was awakened by his angry police chief, finally appears. The crook flees, but the cop finds him hiding between two large rocks. He cracks him on the head with his nightstick and carries the unconscious thief off to jail.
