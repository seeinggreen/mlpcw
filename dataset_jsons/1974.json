The knight explains Luther sought to protect himself from demons and excelled in the \"counsels of perfection\" to suppress internal doubt. Luther serves food, cleans latrines, washes dishes, shivers in bed, and paces in prayer, saying, \"I am afraid of the darkness and the hole in it ... and there's no bottom to it!\" Overwhelmed by his sinfulness, he leaves the stalls of chanting monks and collapses. The knight reports he dealt with doubts by \"dropping them\" into his bowels, i.e., becoming constipated.\nBefore the first mass in which he officiates, Brother Weinand tells him his father will attend and, in vesting Luther, has him confess the Apostles' Creed, repeating \"the forgiveness of sins\", to tell him that \"God isn't angry with you.

He declares someone has to \"bell the cat,\" and posts his Ninety-five Theses.

Luther prays, \"Help my unbelief.\" Luther asserts that passing air in the devil's face wards him off: going from being anal retentive to being anal expulsive shows one has overcome one's doubts and fears.

Willie's destination is a midtown hotel, to collect payment from his women - who work the midtown hotels, attracting the many businessmen, conventioneers, who are looking for sex.\nWillie's 'stable' of seven women are of all ethnicities, dressed in vibrant outfits. Their entrance  into the Business International Association convention - by entering as an ensemble through the hotel's main doors in-sync with the title song's description of them - has all the men in the room ogling them. Many conventioneers - including even a pair of police officers - take the women to their hotel rooms. Pashen is the newest hooker working for Willie, and she is last in line to hand in her payments. Willie gets mad at her for producing less than expected. Willie compares his business with those of a production line: \"Seven girls out there.

This is a business, baby, a production line, and just like GM, Ford, Chrysler, Willie's comin' through.\" Willie tells of his dreams of being the number one, top-pimp in New York City.\nBell, currently the number one pimp, holds a 'pimp council,' and tells the gathered pimps of the police cracking down on prostitution activities across the city. Bell makes a business proposal, wherein each pimp will get his own area to run, instead of the pimps competing for territory. Everyone agrees, except Willie. He argues the idea would hurt his business. Willie says his women are akin to 'animals of the jungle,' having the need to 'roam free,' and 'conquer all that can be controlled.'\nSoon after the meeting ends, Willie learns Pashen has been arrested. Cora is a social worker, who tries to get the prostitutes in jail, to get out of the business, and turn their lives around. Cora meets Pashen, and tries to educate her on the dangers of being a prostitute. Cora encourages Pashen to change her life, and, as she's so young and pretty, to become a model and get paid for it. Being na\u00efve, Pashen dismisses the idea, believing she can make more money as a hooker for Willie. Willie comes to post bail and gets Pashen out of jail. While Willie is out of his apartment, Cora makes an unexpected visit, and tells the women they are being ripped off by Willie. They ponder what Cora said as she leaves the apartment. When Willie comes back, he learns Pashen has been arrested again and the other women are reluctant to work. Willie threatens them if they decide to not work.\nCora visits the jail and tries again to persuade Pashen to get out of prostitution. Pashen still insists prostitution - and being part of Willie's 'stable' - is okay, as she's making a lot of money, and she likes the men's attention while working, because she feels like someone 'important,' wanted & beautiful. Cora tells Pashen that she, too, was once a prostitute, on the streets. Cora sneaks into Willie's apartment to find records of Willie's bank accounts, which could provide evidence of his illegal activity, but, the materials she takes would not be able to stand up in court. After this second arrest, Pashen finally decides to take Cora's advice about pursuing modeling, and does a photo-shoot for which she gets paid. She tries to tell Willie she wants out, but, he tells her of his dreams and hopes for her (and for himself), which she's not able to refuse.\nWillie goes to the hotel convention, and finds his territory has been invaded and his lead hooker, Honey, has been killed after a territorial battle.

Promptly abducted by the latter, Fulvio is put on trial until they find out that their missing Master committed suicide days earlier, disheartened by the seemingly-final defeat of revolutionary ideals. The Brothers disband, with Fulvio returning in disguise to his family villa for the first time in decades. After witnessing his relatives mourn his ostensible death, however, he reveals himself and is welcomed back.\nSoon, he's joined by his lover and fellow revolutionary Charlotte, learning that she raised enough money abroad to fund an expedition to liberate the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, currently weakened by cholera. Fulvio, though, has grown weary of their seemingly endless and unfruitful political struggle, re-evaluating the eases of aristocratic life. He unsuccessfully offers Charlotte to go to America with their child Massimiliano, who until then had been raised by peasants to keep him safe. Fulvio's sister finds out that the reunited Brothers will come to the villa to organize the expedition and reports them to the authorities. When Fulvio learns that Austrian soldiers are about to ambush his companions, he sees the opportunity to get out of his commitment and doesn't warn them: most Brothers are killed in the ensuing skirmish, while Fulvio flees with a fatally wounded Charlotte.\nThe surviving Brothers \u2014oblivious to his betrayal\u2014 track him down at her funeral, followed by the Master's young son, Allonsanf\u00e0n. Learning that the expedition is still going, Fulvio offers to buy himself the needed guns with Charlotte's money, with which he actually plans to escape to America along with a newly reunited Massimiliano, but first he has to get rid of Brothers Lionello and her partner Francesca. He goes boating with the former in Lake Orta, where he claims smugglers will deliver the guns: Fulvio pretends to have been scammed and unsuccessfully tries to manipulate the suicidal Lionello into killing himself to avoid facing failure, but he dies anyway when the boat capsizes during the argument. Fulvio seduces Francesca to avoid being denounced to the Brothers and, after placing Massimiliano in a boarding school and using the money to pay years of rent in the case of his death, self-injures to simulate a robbery.\nFulvio and Francesca arrive in Genoa, where the expedition should set off. Here, the Brothers are moved by the story of Southern exile Vanni, who tells them how Two Sicilies soldiers buried alive his wife due to cholera, to the point of sailing for Sicily before the lack of guns can be revealed: while Fulvio is unconscious from an opium medicine for his injury, Francesca has him boarded with the others, much to his despair. After the Brothers decide to proceed with the expedition even without guns, an increasingly frantic Fulvio finds out that Vanni is infamous in Sicily for exacting revenge on many soldiers and fellow countrymen. As soon as they land, Fulvio once again betrays his fellow revolutionaries, reporting them to a priest in the nearby village of Grottole in exchange for his life. Fearing that the hungry and cholera-stricken peasants would easily join the rebellion, the priest stirs up them against the invaders, scapegoating them for the epidemic and highlighting Vanni's involvement. Easily recognizable because of their red shirts, the unsuspecting Brothers and Vanni are all lynched on the spot by the crowd.\nFulvio is leaving Grottole when he meets Allonsanf\u00e0n, the sole survivor of the massacre.

The following day, he has Kishtayya collect fertilizer from the landlord's house. Surya then uses Kishtayya's absence to flirt with Lakshmi, but she fails to reciprocate. In the meantime, the villagers have begun to gossip, and many (most notably the overseer, Police Officer Patel Sheikh Chand) believe that Surya has already slept with Lakshmi, and will act in the same way that his father did - try to conceal the scandal by giving his mistress a vast plot of land.\nKishtayya is caught stealing toddy, after which he is publicly humiliated, and he decides to leave the village due to the embarrassment. In his absence, Surya and Lakshmi sleep together. Some time later, Saru arrives at the village, in order to live with her husband.

The next morning, Lakshmi has morning sickness, and Saru fires her, claiming that she is too sick to work.\nMany days go by, and eventually Kishtayya returns, having cured himself of his alcoholism and made some money. Lakshmi is overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt, because she believes that she has betrayed her husband. On discovering Lakshmi's pregnancy, he salutes the village goddess at her temple, acknowledging that his wife's wish has been granted. He then decides to return to work and hopefully ride the bullock cart once again for Surya. Surya sees Kishtayya and mistakenly believes that Kishtayya is seeking revenge from him due to his infidelity with Lakshmi.\nSurya orders three men to grab hold of Kishtayya and then proceeds to whip him with a rope used for lynching.

They go back to Nur-ed-Din's home and make love.\nZumurrud's story: Zumurrud tells her first story-within-the-story about the bisexual poet Sium from Ethiopia of the royal court. (This segment is based on the poetry of Abu Nuwas.) The king spots a woman bathing naked and is sad he has to leave. He asks Sium to compose a poem on the spot about the experience. Afterwards, Sium goes into the town where he propositions three boys for sex. Later, the king and the woman he saw bathing earlier find two youths, a boy and a girl, and drug them with potions. They leave them asleep naked in the same tent on separate cots. They make a bet that whichever of the pair falls in love is the inferior one, as the weaker falls in love with the beautiful. In turn, they wake both the boy and the girl, and both attempt to masturbate on the other's naked body. In the end, Sium and the woman admit there is no clear winner and they leave. Zumurrud is finished with her story and has completed a tapestry. She tells Nur-ed-Din to sell it in the market to anyone except a blue-eyed European man. Nur-ed-Din goes to the market and falls for the blue-eyed man's high offer. The man follows Nur-ed-Din back to his home and asks to share food. He drugs Nur-ed-Din with a banana and steals Zumurrud when he is asleep. The blue-eyed man brings Zumurrud to the old man from the marketplace, and he beats her for having mocked him.\nNur-e-din's search: Nur-ed-Din is very distressed when he awakens. A female stranger offers to help him. She discovers where Zumurrud is and tells Nur-e-din to wait outside the old man's gate when he is asleep. Zumurrud will jump over the wall and abscond with him. He waits deep into the night but falls asleep. A passing Kurd steals his money and his turban. Zumurrud jumps over the wall and mistakes the Kurd for Nur-ed-Din. The Kurd brings her back to his hideout, where he says his friends will gang rape her. She is chained up but manages to escape the next day and leaves into the desert disguised as a soldier.\nCrowned King: Zumurrud rides through the desert and arrives outside a city guarded by several soldiers and a crowd of people. She claims to be a soldier named Wardan. The people, believing her to be a man, tell her that after the king passes without an heir, their tradition is to crown the first traveller who comes to their city. She is also  given a bride. On her wedding night, Zumurrud reveals her secret to the bride. The bride promises to keep her secret. The European man and the Kurd travel to the city and are summarily executed on Wardan's orders. The people they were eating with mistakenly believe this is punishment for stealing a handful of their rice.\nDream: This segment is based on the story of the Porter and the three ladies of Baghdad from Night 9. Nur-ed-Din is mistaken for a porter by a veiled woman. She hires him to collect various foods and dishes from the market to bring home for her and her two sisters. They return home, set the table and begin reading. In the story-within-the-story, Princess Dunya dreams about a female dove helping her male counterpart fly free from a net. The female is then caught in a net and the male flies off alone. She takes the meaning of this dream as the infidelity of men and vows to never marry.\nAziz and Aziza: Dunya picks up a book and reads a story. The next story is based on the Aziz and Aziza story that begins on Night 112. Aziz (Ninetto Davoli) is telling his friend, Prince Tagi, about his life. He was set to be married to his cousin Aziza, but on the wedding day, he is distracted by a mysterious woman he meets by chance, when he sits under her window. The woman communicates to him in scant gestures. He is smitten with this woman and goes to Aziza to figure out what to do. Aziza helps decode the messages and tells him how to reply and what poetry to recite. After a rough start, the woman responds to Aziz who looks forward to their meeting in a tent outside the city.\nLove is my Master: Aziz goes to the tent and drinks some wine which puts him to sleep. The woman leaves a sign that she will murder him if he does something so careless again. He goes back and abstains from eating this time. The woman (named Budur) comes and they make love. Aziz recites the poetry Aziza told him to. He returns home and Aziza is on the roof, crushed with loneliness, but Aziz does not seem to care. He only wants Budur. Aziza gives him more poetry to recite. Aziz returns to Budur and after they sleep together, he shoots an arrow with a dildo into her vagina in a highly symbolic scene. Aziz goes home to rest while Aziza cries again. Aziz goes to Budur the next day and recites more poetry but she scolds him. She says the meaning of the poem is that the girl who gave it loved him and has committed suicide. She tells him to go to her grave. He goes and his mother tells him to mourn faithfully but he clearly has little interest in this.\nWeep as you made her weep: Aziz returns to Budur the next day but she is very distraught. She gives him a large sum of money and tells him to erect a monument in Aziza's honor, but he spends all the money on alcohol. After leaving the bar, he is kidnapped by a young woman and her hired thugs. The woman orders him to marry her or Budur, whom he was visiting will kill him. He spends a year with her and fathers a child but he leaves one day on the pretext of visiting his mother. He instead goes to see Budur, who is sitting outside her tent. He asks why she is sitting alone. She responds she has sat alone for one year, not moving an inch, waiting for him. When Aziz tells her he is married and has a child now, Budur tells him he is useless to her now. However, she calls some other women and they surround him with knives. He yells out the last poem Aziza gave him and they are forced to halt. Budur says she won't kill him and that Aziza has saved him this time but that he will not leave unharmed. She ties a rope around his genitalia and castrates him. Aziz returns to his mother who gives him a message from the deceased Aziza. A tapestry he believed was made by Budur was actually made by a woman named Princess Dunya. Prince Tagi hears all this and is moved. He wants to meet Dunya as he has fallen in love with her without even meeting her.\nGarden: The two travel to Dunya's city where she has walled herself off in her palace. They ask the gardener for a tour and he obliges. He says Dunya had a dream about a dove that was betrayed by her male counterpart and has vowed to have nothing to do with men. The two want to meet her under the guise of posing as painters. They plan on hiring two other painters to help them with this disguise. The two are offered seven, eight and even 9 dinars but they refuse to work for anything below one dinar.\nThe Painter's story: The men are all painting and working in the palace. Aziz's friend asks the first one what his story is and he replies that he was once a prince who managed to survive a battle by covering himself in a corpse's blood and pretending to be one of the dead. After the enemy leaves, he runs off to a new city to hide. He asks for work and says he knows a lot about philosophy, science, astronomy, medicine and law. The man tells him this is useless to him and the prince will work cutting wood.\nPrince Shahzaman: This is an adaptation of the second dervish's tale from Nights 12 and 13. Prince Shahzaman and his entourage are attacked by robbers. He plays dead and thus survives the attack. Shahzaman goes out to cut wood and accidentally finds a trap door in the ground. He walks down the stairs and finds a beautiful girl trapped underground by a jinn. She tells him that the jinn only comes once every ten days or when she slaps the golden sign above her bed that tells him that she needs him. The prince sleeps with her and he proudly holds his erection in his hand as he announces that he will free her from the jinn. Against her wishes, he hits the golden sign in order to kill the jinn. The prince immediately regrets this and leaves without his shoes before the jinn arrives. The girl tries to explain things to the jinn, that it was only an accident but the jinn realizes she was sleeping with someone when he spies the prince's shoes. He goes out searching for the prince by asking people if they know who the shoes belong to and someone replies yes much to the jinn's happiness. The jinn takes the prince back to the cave and attempts to make the prince kill the girl with a sword but the prince is afraid to do it, having just slept with the girl He also asks the girl to kill the prince but she refuses. Angered and realizing neither will do it, the jinn then chops the girl into pieces himself and takes the prince away to exact his revenge. The jinn tells him that he will not kill him but will transform him into a monkey as punishment for what he has done. The monkey then is picked up by travellers on a ship though it is unknown to them that he was once a man. The travellers are amazed when the monkey takes a paper and brush from them and writes down poetry in beautiful calligraphy. The travellers land at port and go to the king with the paper. The king asks to find whoever wrote such beautiful poetry and throw him a celebration. The people throw a celebration for the monkey. The monkey is adorned with robes and is carried on a litter to the king's surprise. The king's daughter who is knowledgeable of sorcery understands that he was once a man and transforms him back, killing herself in the process. She goes up in flames and only ashes remain of her. Her father, who allowed her to commit suicide, now wants to give the prince a rich gift. But Prince Shahzaman thanks the king for his daughter's self-sacrifice and says he now wants to return to his kingdom.\nYunan's story: This is an adaptation of the third dervish's story from Nights 14 and 15. In far east Asia, Prince Yunan lives in contentment with his father, the King. Yunan decides to go on a voyage to islands within his kingdom but the ship is blown off course in a storm. He asks the crew why they are crying and they tell him there is an island with a \"magnetic mountain\" that they are approaching. It will pull all the nails out of their ship and send them to their deaths among the rocks. The ship crashes as they explain but Yunan survives. He hears a voice telling him to grab a bow and arrow buried under the sand and shoot the stone knight statue bearing the cursed talisman that is planted on the peak of the island. He shoots it as he is told and the entire island collapses into the sea. Yunan survives though and drifts among the waves with a piece of wood from his destroyed ship.\nChamber in the sand: Yunan drifts to another island where he sees a ship disembarking. He runs but it is too late. He finds a chamber on the island and goes inside to find a young boy. The young boy tells him that he is the son of a king and it was foretold by a soothsayer that on that very day he would be killed by a prince named Yunan and so his father took him to the remote island and built a chamber to keep him in until the dangerous time passed. Yunan hears this and tells him he will not hurt him but will only protect him. They bathe together and then go to sleep but during his sleep, Yunan begins sleepwalking and grabs a knife. He stabs the boy with the knife, killing him. (The ending of this story is changed from in the book where the prince accidentally kills the boy while trying to cut a lemon).\nDream revealed: This segment is based on the porter's story in Night 9. Nur-ed-Din is bathing naked with the three sisters, who are also naked. They are a bit drunk and messing around with each other. One by one, the women ask Nur-ed-Din what their vaginas are called. He answers but they keep telling him he's got the wrong names. The right names are meadowed grass, sweet pomegranates, and the Inn of Good Food. He then asks them what the name of his penis is and each provides an answer though he says they are incorrect. Its name is \"the donkey which grazes perfumed meadowed grass, eats peeled sweet pomegranates and spends the night in the Inn of Good Food.\" He then wakes up the next morning in the terrace outside the women's house. He continues on his search for Zummurrud.\nNur-e-din and Zumurrud: Nur-ed-Din reaches the city where Zummurrud rules. He grabs a handful of rice from the bowl where people are eating and is taken away to the king's private chamber. Zummurrud (still in disguise) asks him for anal intercourse.

That is what Al Karp, the former partner of jailed criminal planner Walter Ballantine, thinks, so Karp arranges for Ballantine to escape from the Streiger Institute (a privately run penitentiary). Ballantine isn't keen on the job, given that the last one, also brought to him by Karp, landed him in jail. Two members of the team aren't also to his liking:  Victor, the nephew of Karp, is a former FBI agent but also absolutely clueless. And the financier of the coup, Eleonora, has got a crush on him. Finally, after seeing the bank, Ballantine is ready to give up. A hold-up is out of question - there isn't a good escape route, and the possibility of being shot in the back when leaving the bank has also to be considered. Because of the opening hours of the nearby stores, on Thursday nights money is kept in the bank. But in a hard-to-crack Mosler safe, guarded by four security guards. So breaking into the bank is also no option.\nAt this moment, Ballantine has a flash of inspiration: Instead of stealing the money out of the bank, they will steal the whole bank. And while Streiger together with his FBI buddy Andrew Constable is setting up a command center to catch Ballantine, the team around Ballantine is getting to work: Since the provisional bank is missing wheels, they have steal a tractor together with wheels, and install them under the bank.\nEverything is going perfectly and according to plan: They stage a diversion to lure the police patrol cars away from the bank and drive away with it. Thanks to trickery, the guards flee the bank in panic. After camouflaging it by giving it a fresh, pink painting instead of the old green one, they hide it in a trailer park, and start to work on the safe. Even when the police controls the site, the only result is the harassment of another mobile home owner, who has also arrived the same night, and whose trailer is green.\nThings begin to go awry when the pink color, not being waterproof, is washed away by a lawn sprinkler, and the manager of the trailer park, not wanting more disturbances, forces them to leave. Without a better option, they park the bank on top of a hill in a wasteland, installing a prominent billboard for real estate development. Resuming the work on the safe, it proves to be a very tough nut. They resort to the use of nitroglycerine, when the mobile home is spotted by a helicopter, and Streiger together with Constable are rushing to the scene. Meanwhile, the team finally blasts open the safe, blowing the roof and the walls of the bank away as collateral damage. The wreckage of the bank, together with the safe, begins to roll down the hill, and only Ballantine manages to jump on it. The ensuing pursuit ends at a high cliff on the coast: The team, together with Streiger, witness how the bank plunges together with Ballantine into the water. Ballantine, not wanting to be arrested again, begins to swim into the open sea.

His sister Ria is getting married to Ramdass, and Bim's father, Bhagwan Singh, a famous trade union leader and activist, is in a feud with rival Gopaul. On the day of Ria's wedding, Bhagwan Singh sends his men to kill Gopaul's two sons: Harry and Charlie. Sookdeo informs him that the men have killed Harry, but Charlie escapes.

Bim\u2019s uncle, Balo, is an abusive, racist, gambling addict and dockworker. He beats Babsie after she refuses to tell him if Bim's family sent any money. He steals the money sent by Bim's family for his schooling, after Bim, meeting him for the first time, tells him where the money is. He then beats Bim for not responding to his question and then tells him not to worry as he knows a good teacher to send him to. \nAt his new school, Bim is the only Indian, and is ridiculed by his racist teacher Mr. Hudson and isolated and picked on by the Afro-Trinidadian students because of his coolie (Indian laborer) heritage. During a break the students, led by Pinhead, gang up against Bim and steal his book as well as verbally and physically abuse him. When he fights back, the students disperse as Mr. Hudson is making his way back and Pinhead threatens to deal with him after class. After class, Bim seeks Mr. Hudson's help who makes a mockery of Bim and pays him no mind. When he comes out of class the students are waiting for him and Bim is forced to stab Pinhead as a means of defense to make it home alive. This incident gets Bim kicked out of school, which causes a fight between Balo and him. He then runs away from home and spends the night in a cemetery.\nThe film flash-forwards and Bim is now an adult who goes by \"Bim Bim\" and is a vagabond who steals to get by in Port of Spain. He tries his hand in playing in a steelpan band but quits when he gets into an argument with the bandleader. After quitting, Bim and his friends Mango-head and Tallsocks try to rob a gas station where he knows the attendant but is interrupted when a police officer stops by and the attendant yells for help. He runs from the police and takes refuge at his friend, Wabham's, underground poker joint and brothel, where he gambles away most of his money and sleeps with Angela, a prostitute he frequents. Wabham tells him to go out of town for a while and promises to find something for him. The next morning, Bim is awakened by Corporal Leslie Joseph, who is revealed to be a corrupt cop who is paid off by Wabham. Corporal Joseph transports Bim in his trunk to Cedros by Wabham's friend The Captain, who is an Afro-Grenadian immigrant that is a fisherman and involved in smuggling. Tozo, The Captain's right-hand man tells Corporal Joseph that someone has been tipping off the police as they had a run-in with the cops the night before and that it was the fifth time in the last two months. The Captain meets Bim and takes a liking to him. Corporal Joseph tells The Captain that he is waiting for his payment for bringing Bim, and The Captain tells him to ask Wabham for the money. Later that night, The Captain and Bim are drinking and talking and The Captain asks Bim to tell him about the time that the notorious gangster Goldteeth was looking for Bim.\nIn a flashback, Bim is in a bar sitting and listening to music when approached by Goldteeth. Goldteeth tells Bim that he heard he's looking for him, but Bim gets scared and tells Goldteeth he wants no trouble and that he was only talking big. Goldteeth calls his girlfriend Suzy and asks if Bim is the one planning for his head and she confirms and Bim tells her to tell him that he was only joking with her. Goldteeth then makes a slight cut in Bim's forehead and tells him to remember who put it there. Back in the present-day, The Captain says he knew Goldteeth when he was a child and they share a laugh about it. The Captain tells Bim he should stop being called \"Bim Bim\". Bim tells him his real name is Bim Singh and The Captain says that he remembers who his father was and asks about his family. Bim reveals that his mother died three years ago and he could not go because he would be dead if he set foot in Caroni County again, and he says that his sister and brother-in-law moved to Venezuela and that he has no family left. The Captain tells him he also has no family and that family ties down a man and it is better to be alone. The Captain suggests he should be called Bim (pronounced Bim like dim).\nIn another scene in the Police Commissioner's office, Detective Jones tells the Police Commissioner about a boatload of illegal Grenadian immigrants found off the coast of Cedros who were waiting for someone to pick them up and that The Captain is a suspect, however, there is no evidence to prove it. \nBack in Caroni County, Jalwat Singh, a distant relative of Bhagwan Singh and Bim, is campaigning against Charlie who now goes by Baba Charlie. However, even though the people dislike Charlie, they fear more the instability of what could happen when they get independence and the Blacks take over, and Jalwat says that Charlie is using race to control them. Late in the night, Charlie's men set fire to Jalwat's house and car, and Jalwat and his family barely escape. \nBack in Cedros, The Captain reveals he knows Constable Joseph is a traitor ratting them out to the police. He tells the men that he plans on taking Constable Joseph out on a boat ride in the night and says that if he disappears, to tell anyone who asks that they have not seen him in weeks. \nBack at the Police Commissioner's house, his wife Mary worries what will happen to them if Trinidad and Tobago become independent. The Police Commissioner gets a call and in another scene, Wabham is listening to the radio and it is revealed that the body of Constable Joseph was found off the sea in Cedros and that the British Parliament is debating Trinidad and Tobago's independence. The Police Commissioner visits The Captain to ask about the murder of Constable Joseph, and he denies having anything to do with it, even though the Police Commissioner strongly suspects him. In another scene, Ben Joseph, an Afro-Trinidadian political leader is giving a speech to a group of people about the upcoming election being important as it will determine the government of an independent Trinidad and Tobago. His character is based on the People's National Movement's leader and founder Eric Williams.\nBack in Cedros, after months of no operations, The Captain and his men go out to smuggle more Grenadian refugees, but on his way back is captured by police, however, Bim gets away and steals a car from a couple having sex in the backseat. He goes to Wabham and tells what happened and that he could either kill a man or sleep with a woman. Bim tells Wabham that he knows he is scared since The Captain got captured by the police and fears for himself, so he warns Wabham not to do anything stupid and turn him in. Wabham sends a new girl from the country to sleep with Bim. Bim tries to forcibly sleep with her, but she is hesitant and tells him that she's a virgin. He then continues to force himself on her but recognizes she is Anna from his childhood. She is shocked to see him as Charlie had told everyone that he is dead. She tells Bim that Charlie has terrorized Caroni and made it impossible for people who were associated with his family to work in Caroni, so she got a job as a prostitute in Port of Spain. She also informs him of Jalwat Singh and that he is in San Fernando. They share an intimate moment together as flashbacks of their childhood are shown and she falls asleep in his arms. Wabham tells him a car has come to move him out and he threatens Wabham to give Anna another job and that she is his family.\nIn San Fernando, Bim meets Jalwat Singh who is cautious at first but then trusts Bim after Bim tells him his intention is to get revenge for his father's death. Jalwat takes Bim to the panchayat (group of village elders who make decisions) where they are willing to support Bim but caution him that this is more than Charlie and the labor union, it is about politics and being in the talk of independence as they fear what will happen to the Indians when Trinidad and Tobago becomes independent. Jalwat and Bim start campaigning and Charlie's men arrive but are stopped by Bim who pulls a gun on them and reveals that he is Bhagwan Singh's son. Charlie's men go back and tell him of Bim, who said he should have killed him back then. While on an outing by the river, Charlie is ambushed by Bim. Charlies tries to cut a deal with him, but Bim refuses and shoots and kills him after he tries to get away.\nBim then takes over as the union and political leader of the Indians and transforms himself into a politician and dons a mustache and is called Bim (pronounced Bheem) Singh, his original name, again.  He tells Cutter to bring Anna back from Port of Spain after hearing that Wabham did not listen and kept Anna as a prostitute. He then silently tells Cutter what to do Wabham. Bim makes a speech to his supporters that he plans on forming a political party to run in the next general election and to represent and protect the rights and interests of Indo-Trinidadians and calls for unity between Afro-Trinidadians and Indo-Trinidadians, but that they are used to it if the Afro-Trinidadians want to live separate from Indo-Trinidadians. Later that night, he confesses his love for Anna and tells her that she is the only one he could trust and that she no longer has to work for Wabham.\nAfter a tennis match, the Governor and the Police Commissioner discuss the politics of the island. The Governor urges the Police Commissioner to drop the probe into Bim, even though the Police Commissioner believes that Bim was involved in the murder of Constable Joseph. The Governor tells him that the people have forgotten the murder and their priorities have moved on to independence and that politics are dominated by race and the probe into Bim could be seen as racial, which the Police Commissioner vehemently denies and is insulted by. Bim and Jalwat are invited to the Governor's house. However, on the way there Bim is annoyed and voices his dissatisfaction with politics. After Bim leaves, Anna says she feels stifled and asks Cutter if she can go out, but he says that she can not leave without Bim's permission, however, she says it is just to the savannah and that he could come with her. Cutter then opens the gate and they go out. At the Governor's house, Bim gets drunk and insults a white sympathizer who admires his work for the Indians and tells her to come down to the sugar belt and help Indians cut cane if she was so concerned. He then walks out and the Governor overhears him further insulting the woman. As they are leaving they are approached by Ben Joseph the Afro-Trinidadian political leader. He rejects Ben Joseph's proposal to form an alliance for the upcoming general election, saying that Africans and Indians do not get together in politics and that he only approached him because of his power in the country and that he wants Bim to give him some. He then curses and makes a scene causing everyone at the Governor's house to hear him and says that he is fed up with politics and power and he leaves with Jalwat. While Anna and Cutter are walking the street, she is recognized by a former client from when she was a prostitute and he tries to kidnap her. While driving back home Bim sees them trying to kidnap Anna and gets out of his car. He shoots and kills the kidnappers in power-drunk rage, despite Jalwat telling him not to and the kidnapper begging for his life, and he ends the film with a scream.", "tmdb_plot": "Young Indian man survives life of violence and crime in Trinidad and Tobago to become part of the political movement towards independence.", "tmdb_id": "249689", "wiki_id": "7418189"}, {"title": "Birds Over the City", "genres": ["Family"], "wiki_plot": "Andryusha and his fifth-grade classmates found poorly bound typewritten pages with the words 'Attack' in a pile of scrap materials.

He catches up with the men after they blow out a tire. Bennie shoots them, searches their car, and claims Garcia's head. Stopping at a roadside restaurant, he packs the sack containing the head with ice to preserve it for the journey home. Bennie talks to the head as if Garcia were still alive, first blaming Alfredo for Elita's death and then conceding that both of them probably loved her equally.\nBennie is ambushed by members of Garcia's family. They reclaim the head and are about to kill Bennie when they are interrupted by the arrival of Sappensly and Quill. The hit men pretend to ask for directions. Quill produces a sub-machine gun and murders most of the family, but is fatally shot by one of them. As Sappensly sorrowfully looks at Quill's corpse, Bennie asks: \"Do I get paid?\" Sappensly turns to shoot, but Bennie kills him. Bennie returns to Mexico City, \"arguing\" with Garcia's head all the while.\nAt his apartment Bennie gives Garcia's head a shower and then brings it to Max's hotel room. Feigning willingness to surrender the head for his $10,000, Bennie reveals he is no longer motivated by money; he says Alfredo was a friend of his and demands to know why Max and the others want his head so badly. He also blames Elita's death on the bounty. Several men pull guns but Bennie evades their fire and kills them all. He takes a business card from the desk with El Jefe's address on it.\nAfter attending the baptism for his new grandchild, El Jefe greets Bennie as a hero in his hacienda, and gives him a briefcase containing the million-dollar bounty. Bennie calmly relates how many people died for Garcia's head, including his beloved. El Jefe tells Bennie to take his money and throw the head to the pigs on the way out. Infuriated that the object responsible for Elita's death is viewed as nothing more than garbage, Bennie guns down all of El Jefe's bodyguards.\nTeresa enters with her newborn son, causing Bennie to hesitate shooting El Jefe. She urges Bennie to kill her father. Bennie obliges and leaves El Jefe's hacienda with Teresa, taking along Garcia's head. They approach the entrance gate and Bennie says goodbye to Teresa, departing the scene with the words: \"You take care of the boy. And I'll take care of the father\".

When one of the hoons damages the Mayor's property and breaks a statue of an Aboriginal Australian the older men of the town burn the guilty driver's car as he is held down.\nThe Mayor appoints Arthur the town parking inspector complete with brassard and Army bush jacket that further irritates the young men. The situation reaches its boiling point the night of the town's annual Pioneers Ball which is a fancy dress and costume party.  What was planned to be a \"car gymkhana\" by the young men turns into an assault on the town where both sides attack each other killing several of the residents.

Once Ellen is in her apartment, Retzliff arrives claiming car trouble and asks to use the phone. When Ellen lets him in, he overpowers and rapes her. Unable to reach David by phone, and emotionally unable to report the crime, Ellen decides to put the attack behind her, and tries through three showers to literally wash away the rape.\nWhen David returns, she is still unable to get his attention long enough to tell him about the attack. Having had an anonymous blood test, Ellen makes a serious effort to forget the attack and resume her life.  This attempt comes to a crashing halt four days after the initial attack in a parking garage when Retzliff, who has been waiting for Ellen behind the front seat of her car, rapes her again, this time beating her viciously.\nAfter reporting the attack, the treatment that Ellen receives from the police, doctors, and detectives is anything but sympathetic.  While the District Attorney, Leonard Alexander, appears to have her best interests at heart, he clearly has his reservations.\nDefending Retzliff is ruthless attorney Muriel Dyer who bullies and interrogates witnesses and Ellen herself on the stand in an attempt to get Retzliff off. Dyer's efforts succeed and Retzliff is found not guilty. Following the trial, attorney Alexander comments, \"Never try a rape case unless your victim is a 90-year-old nun with at least four stab wounds.\" After this, Retzliff mockingly apologizes to Ellen, saying \"no hard feelings\", but Ellen calmly but coldly tells him, \"If you ever come near me again, I'll kill you.\"\nA voiceover narration at the end of the movie reveals that shortly after the trial, Retzliff attempts to rape someone else.

Julie begins picking them up, and tries to follow C\u00e9line around Paris, sometimes at a great pace (for instance, sprinting up Montmartre to keep pace with C\u00e9line's tram). After adventures following C\u00e9line around the Parisian streets\u2014at one point it looks as if they have gone their separate ways, never to meet up again\u2014C\u00e9line finally decides to move in with Julie. There are incidents of identity swapping, with C\u00e9line pretending to be Julie to meet the latter's childhood sweetheart, for example, and Julie attempting to fill in for C\u00e9line at a cabaret audition.\nThe second half of the film centers on the duo's individual visits to 7 bis, rue du Nadir-aux-Pommes, the address of a mansion in a quiet, walled off grounds in Paris. While seemingly empty and closed in the present day, the house is yet where C\u00e9line realizes she knows as the place where she works as a nanny for a family\u2014two jealous sisters, one widower, and a sickly child. Soon, a repetitive pattern emerges: C\u00e9line or Julie enters the house, disappears for a time, and then is suddenly ejected by unseen hands back to present day Paris later that same day. Each time either C\u00e9line or Julie is exhausted, having forgotten everything that has happened during their time in the house. However, each time upon returning via a taxi the women discover a candy mysteriously lodged in their mouth. It seems to be important, so each makes sure to carefully save the candy. At one point, they realize that the candy is a key to the other place and time; sucking on the sweet transports them back to the house's alternative reality (in this case a double reference to both Lewis Carroll and to Marcel Proust's madeleine) of the day's events.\nThe remainder of the film consists of the two women attempting to solve the central mystery of the house: amidst the jealous conniving of women of the house over the attentions of the widower, a young child is mysteriously murdered. But this narrative is one that repeats like a stage play, with exact phrases they soon learn well enough to start joking about. Each time they repeat eating the candy, they remember more of the day's events. Just as if reading a favorite novel, or again watching a beloved movie, they find that they can enter the narrative itself, with each twist and turn memorized. Far from being the passive viewers/readers that they were at first\u2014and most movie viewers always are\u2014the women come to realize that they can seize hold of the story, changing it as they wish.\nNow, even as the plot continues to unfold in its clockwork fashion, the women begin to take control, making it \"interactive\" by adding alterations to their dialogues and inserting different actions into the events unreeling in the house. Finally, in a true act of authorship, they change the ending, and rescue the young girl who was originally murdered. Both realities are fully conjoined when, after their rescue of the girl from the House of Fiction, the two not only discover themselves transported back to Julie's apartment, but this time it isn't another \"waking dream\" for the young girl, Madlyn, has joined them, safely back in 1970s Paris.\nTo relax, C\u00e9line, Julie, and Madlyn take a rowboat on a placid river, rowing and gliding happily along.

Several hours later, the wolf-dog is found by John Tarwater (Harry Carey Jr.) a grizzled old trader who buries the dead Mitsha, and takes the hound back to a nearby town which is his home. The wolf-dog befriends another young boy who is John's orphaned, 10-year-old grandson Bill Tarwater (Renato Cestle). After looking for a name, Bill gives White Fang his name by yet again from the beasts ivory-white teeth. At a local saloon, White Fang helps John Tarwater win some money at a card game from a crooked card-shark, and a fistfight breaks out between the swindler and his victims as John casually counts his money, while White Fang and Bill take cover behind the bar. John then embarks on one of his periodic expeditions to discover gold.\nMeanwhile, Beauty Smith is alive and well, and again exploiting the people of the very town where John and Bill live. Smith lives under the alias 'Charles Forth', a local businessman, and fakes a crippling injury by confining himself to a wheelchair with his two henchman always at his side. Sister Evangelina (Virna Lisi) is now running a new mission hut in the town to convert into a hospital. She decides to ask 'Mr. Forth' for funding to operate her hospital despite warnings from the townsmen that 'Mr. Forth' is a businessman and won't give her any money unless she gives him assurances that she will repay the loan, with interest, within 60 days or less. Sister Evangelina nevertheless goes to meet with him, and she recognizes the villainous man immediately.\nSister Evangelina contacts novelist Jason Scott (Franco Nero) who's on a book tour down south and agrees to come to her assistance. Scott also meets with his old friend Kurt Johnson (Raimund Harmstorf), now working as a mines inspector to help out. Together, the three of them take their accusations to the town's police chief, Inspector Leclerq (Renato de Carmine), who is actually on the payroll of Beauty Smith and he claims to have known the crippled 'Mr. Forth' for six years. Leclerq's wife Jane (Hannelore Elsner), is pressuring her husband to accommodate Smith's nefarious plans in return for more bribe money he gives them in exchange for protection.\nJason Scott attempts to expose the illegal complicity between 'Mr. Forth' and the Inspector with the help of a local worker named Liverpool (Donald O'Brien), who agrees to write a statement in exchange for money. But Liverpool goes back on his word to help Scott by skipping down with the money that was given to him. Shortly afterwards, Scott encounters Bill and John Tarwater when White Fang drags them back to town after their sled dogs had run away leaving them stranded on a snowy plain. The animal shows both affection for both Bill and Scott having remembered the latter from their previous adventure in Dawson City three years earlier. Elsewhere, Kurt meets Liverpool's younger and attractive sister (Yanti Somer) and a romantic attraction develops between both of them.\nThe following day, Liverpool shamefacedly returns to the town having found two men, one dead and the other terribly ill from frostbite, who have been sold insufficient and overpriced supplies from Beauty Smith. The survivor, named Carter, has gangrene in both legs and Scott has to help Sister Evangelina perform the amputation at the mission hut. When Beauty Smith and his henchmen see and recognize White Fang, they frame the wolf-dog for savaging Liverpool to death. An enraged posse attempts to kill White Fang, forcing Bill to drive the beast out of town.\nThe next day, when Bill looks for White Fang in the woods, he gets attacked by a vicious eagle, but White Fang jumps in and saves him by fighting off the eagle. Bill smuggles White Fang back into town and to Sister Evangelina's mission where the wolf-dog's injuries are tended. While visiting his grandson and his hound at the mission, John learns from Carter about the location of a gold-stream in the mountains that he found. But Harvey (Werner Pochath), a mission employee and a secret associate of Beauty Smith, sees them discussing the location and reports it to his boss. Jane then fakes a sickness to lure Sister Evangelina away from the mission, leaving Carter alone in his sickbed. Beauty Smith (no longer pretending to be crippled) pays a visit and tortures Carter for the location of the gold stream. Smith then kidnaps John Tarwater and has his two henchmen set fire to the mission hut. Carter is burned to death, while Bill, who walked in while Smith was torturing Carter, is trapped by the flames. When Sister Evangelina realizes that Jane is not sick, she races back to the burning mission and rushes in saving Bill, but gets caught on fire and dies from the severity of her burns.\nHearing of her death, the townspeople start a riot after learning from Bill about the wanted Beauty Smith and of Inspector Leclerq's association with him. As the mob breaks through the Mounties into the police station, Leclerq shoots himself. Scott, Kurt, and Bill find Jane where she tells them where Beauty Smith is heading. Scott and Kurt, with White Fang in tow, organize a posse to give chase. Locating Smith and his henchmen, Scott leads the posse forward and a gun battle develops. Smith manages to shoot a few posse members, while his two henchmen are killed. White Fang catches up to Smith and attacks him. Smith's gunshots miss the beast and instead triggers an avalanche. The villain finally dies as he gets crushed to death under the falling snow and ice. Shortly afterwards, Scott, Kurt, and White Fang locate John Tarwater who was shot and left for dead. But before he dies, he asks Scott that his grandson be the beneficiary of the gold stream that he found right near him with Carter's advice. The two-faced Harvey suddenly shows his true colors and says that the owner will legally be the first one to register the claim in the town. He suggests a dog-sled race to settle the disputed claim.\nIn the climatic sled race, Harvey attempts dirty tricks to win the race, but the tables turn on him when he falls from his sled and dies when he gets accidentally run over by the sled-team headed by White Fang. Scott and White Fang arrive in the town first, and the writer enters Bill Tarwater's name in the ledger in place of his own.\nIn the final scene, Jason Scott says his goodbyes to Kurt who will be staying in the town having gotten the job as the new police inspector, and he announces that he and Liverpool's sister will be getting married in the spring. Bill also stays to live with Kurt and his wife who have agreed to raise the boy and White Fang.

Later, Gittes photographs Mulwray in the company of a young woman, and the pictures make their way into the next day's paper.\nBack at his office, Gittes is confronted by the real Evelyn Mulwray, who threatens to sue him. Gittes concludes that the fake Evelyn was using him to discredit Mulwray. He goes to a reservoir to search for clues but instead finds his old police associate, Lieutenant Lou Escobar. Hollis Mulwray's body had been found in the reservoir, having apparently drowned.\nNow working for Evelyn, Gittes investigates Mulwray's death as a homicide. He discovers that although there is supposedly a drought, huge quantities of water are being released from the reservoir every night.

At his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, who identifies herself as the fake Mrs. Mulwray. She refuses to disclose the name of the man who hired her, but tells Gittes to check that day's obituaries.\nGittes learns that Mulwray was once the business partner of Evelyn's wealthy father, Noah Cross. Over lunch at Cross's club, Cross offers to double Gittes's fee if he will search for Mulwray's missing mistress. At the hall of records, Gittes discovers that much of the Northwest Valley has recently changed ownership. He visits an orange grove in the valley but is attacked by angry landowners who believe him to be an agent of the Water Department, which they claim is sabotaging the water supply to force them out.\nGittes deduces that the Water Department is drying up the land so it can be bought cheaply, and that Mulwray was murdered when he uncovered the plan. He also discovers that some of the property in the valley was seemingly purchased by a recently deceased retirement home resident. Gittes and Evelyn bluff their way into the retirement home and confirm that other real-estate deals were surreptitiously transacted in the names of unknowing residents.

Lieutenant Escobar, who is waiting there, says the coroner found saltwater in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that he did not drown in the freshwater reservoir. Escobar suspects Evelyn murdered him and tells Gittes to produce her quickly. At the Mulwray mansion, Gittes finds Evelyn gone and the servants packing up the house. He discovers that the garden pond is saltwater and spots a pair of eyeglasses in it. He confronts Evelyn about Katherine, whom Evelyn now claims is her daughter. Gittes slaps Evelyn repeatedly and throws her across the room until she breaks down and reveals Katherine is both her sister and her daughter. She explains that her father raped her when she was 15 years old, whereupon she ran away to Mexico. She says that the eyeglasses are not Mulwray's, as he did not wear bifocals.\nGittes arranges for the women to flee back to Mexico and instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown.

Commanding officer Powell has died in one such event, but remains aboard in cryogenic suspension. Lieutenant Doolittle, a former surfer from Malibu, has taken over as commander. The tedium of their work has driven the crew of Pinback, Boiler, and Talby \"around the bend\", so they have created distractions for themselves.\nPinback plays practical jokes, maintains a video diary, and has adopted a ship's mascot in the form of a mischievous \"beach ball\"-like alien who refuses to stay in a storage room.

The trio invade the Kersey apartment by posing as deliverymen. \nDiscovering that Carol and Joanna only have $7 on them, the goons attack them, beating Joanna and brutally assaulting Carol before fleeing. Upon arriving at the hospital, Paul is devastated to learn that Joanna has died from her injuries. Shortly after his wife's funeral, Paul has an encounter with a mugger in a darkened street. Paul fights back with a homemade weapon, causing the mugger to run away, while Paul is shaken and energized by the encounter. Paul's boss sends him to Tucson, Arizona, to visit Ames Jainchill, a client with a residential development project. A few days later, Paul is invited to dinner by Ames at his gun club. Ames is impressed with Paul's pistol marksmanship at the target range. \nPaul reveals that he was a conscientious objector during the Korean War, when he served as a combat medic. He had been taught to handle firearms by his hunter-father, but after the senior Kersey was mortally wounded by a second hunter (who mistook Paul's father for a deer), Paul's mother made him swear never to use guns again. Paul is successful in helping Ames plan his residential housing development. Ames drives Paul back to Tucson Airport and presents Paul with a gift for his work on the development, which he places into Paul's checked luggage. Back in Manhattan, Paul learns from Jack that Carol's mind has snapped due to the trauma and her mother's death; Carol is now catatonic, and an elective mute. \nWith Paul's blessing, Jack commits Carol to a mental rehabilitation institute. Paul learns that Ames has given him a nickel-plated Colt Police Positive revolver and a box of ammunition. He loads it and takes a late-night walk during which he is mugged at gunpoint. Paul fatally shoots the mugger and, in a state of shock, runs home and vomits. The next evening, Paul walks through the city looking for dangerous and violent criminals; sure enough, he kills several muggers over the next few weeks, either luring them into a confrontation by presenting himself as an affluent victim, or when he sees them attacking other innocent people. NYPD Inspector Frank Ochoa investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows it down to a list of men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers, and/or are war veterans. \nOchoa soon suspects Paul and is about to make an arrest when the district attorney intervenes and tells Ochoa that \"we don't want him.\" The district attorney and the police commissioner do not want the statistics to get out that Paul's vigilantism has led to a drastic decrease in street crime; they fear that if said information becomes public knowledge, the whole city will descend into vigilante chaos. If Paul is arrested, he will surely be labeled a martyr. Ochoa does not like the idea, but relents and opts for \"scaring him off\" instead. One night, Paul shoots two more muggers before being wounded in the leg himself by a third. Paul pursues the mugger and corners the hood at a warehouse. He challenges the mugger to a fast draw, Wild West-style, only to faint because of blood loss while the mugger escapes. \nPaul's gun is discovered by young patrolman Jackson Reilly, who hands it to Ochoa, who orders him to forget that he found it. Ochoa visits Paul at the hospital where he's recovering, and agrees to surreptitiously dispose of Paul's revolver in exchange for Paul's exile from NYC permanently. Paul takes Ochoa's deal, and his company agrees to transfer him to Chicago, while the press is informed that Paul is just another mugging victim. Paul arrives in Chicago Union Station by train.

Andy's father, Charles, and sister, Cathy, begin to grieve, but his mother, Christine, becomes irate and refuses to believe that Andy has died. Meanwhile, a trucker stops at a diner and says he's picked up a hitchhiker who's a soldier. Hours later, in the middle of the night, Andy arrives at the front door of the family house in full uniform, apparently unharmed; the family welcomes him back with joy, concluding the notice of his death was a clerical error. When the father says the military told them Andy was dead, he replies \"I was.\" The family laughs, thinking this a joke.\nIn the next few days, Andy displays strange, withdrawn behavior, speaking only rarely, dressing in an concealing manner, and spending his days sitting around the house, listless and anemic. At night, though, he becomes inexplicably animated, wandering the town and spending time in the local cemetery. Meanwhile, local police investigate the murder of a local trucker, who was found with his throat slashed and his body drained of blood.\nCharles attempts to confront Christine about Andy's erratic behavior. Christine insists that Charles was too withdrawn and authoritarian toward Andy; Charles counters that Christine made Andy too sensitive by smothering him. Andy continues to display weird behavior: he attacks a neighbor boy who attempts to demonstrate his karate skills, then kills the family dog when it tries to protect the child. Charles witnesses the killing, tells his wife that their son is crazy, and then goes to the bar, where he tells his friend, a doctor, what Andy did.\nCharles brings the doctor home, and he offers Andy a free checkup. The doctor asks Andy questions related to the truck driver, suspecting him of being the one who killed him. The doctor later tells Charles about the truck driver and says he needs to inform the police about the suspicious coincidence of Andy's return. Andy visits him at his office in the middle of the night, angrily demanding a checkup, but the doctor can't detect a pulse or heartbeat. Andy tells him, \"I died for you, Doc. Why shouldn't you return the favor?\" He attacks and kills the doctor with a syringe, then uses it to inject the doctor's blood into his arm. It's clear that Andy is some kind of vampire or zombie who needs the blood of others to reinvigorate his decaying body.\nThe next day, Charles learns that the doctor was killed and becomes convinced his son is responsible for the deaths. When Christine tells him that Andy is on a double date with his high school sweetheart, Joanne, his sister, and his best friend, Bob, Charles gets his gun and goes looking for them. At a drive-in cinema, Andy visibly decays due to lack of blood. Cathy and Bob briefly leave the car to go get more popcorn. Joanne attempts to strike up a conversation with Andy, but when Andy's decay becomes more visible, he attacks and kills Joanne. Cathy and Bob return to the car to find Andy in a raged frenzy and attacks the two. Andy strangles and kills Bob and attempts to run over Cathy with the car.

Seyed (Behrooz Vousoughi) is a drug addict working small jobs in a theatre to pay for his heavy addiction. One day he is visited by an old friend, Ghodrat (Faramarz Gharibian), for whom he was a role model and protector when they were teenagers. Ghodrat has just been shot by the police when an armed robbery went wrong and is now looking for a safe place to lay low for a while. Hence, he comes to stay with the only person that he could trust, Seyed. However, what he sees is miles away from the Seyed that he knew and had in mind. Although they are both happy to find each other after so many years, Ghodrat is completely shocked to see Seyed, once the ruler of the high school yards and neighbourhoods, an addict. \nSeyed is very emotional to see Ghodrat. He is proud to see that some people from the old days still believe in him and are loyal to him, though he seems ashamed of what he has become. Seyed helps Ghodrat by hiding him in his place, a small room containing only a bed and a samovar that is representative of the extreme poverty in which Seyed lives. They talk about the years since they had been separated. Ghodrat explains that he has become a professional thief and Seyed tells a story of how he had become a heroin addict after having served only two months in a jail for minor offenses. \"The drug was distributed by cleaners in the jail,\" Seyed says. Once released, he found no opportunity in life because of lack of social support, poverty and \"drug dealers being everywhere.\" He became a full-time heroin user after using the drug during alcohol- and drug-fueled parties with local drug dealers.\nDuring the few days that Ghodrat is staying with Seyed, he also meets with Seyed's roommate Fati, a poor but beautiful, hard-working and romantic girl from the old days who was once in love with Seyed. Fati is now completely disillusioned about the future and considers Seyed as a brother and life companion. Ghodrat wants to revive Seyed's pride by reminding him of who he was long ago and how being the role model that he was helped him not to fall into drug or alcohol addiction during all those years.\nSeyed tries to justify his failed life by blaming it on a lack of social and parental support, but this leads to an honest but tough exchange about the circumstances that led them to their current stations in life. The discussion becomes so heated and emotional that the two start punching the wall in a show of remaining physical and mental strength. \"It is too late,\" Seyed says. When Ghodrat tries to talk him out of his current state of mind, Seyed responds angrily by saying that being a thief is no better than being a drug addict. In full denial, he thinks that Ghodrat has no right to lecture him about life as \"Ghodrat is a thief and doing things against the law.\"\nGhodrat also witnesses how deeply rooted poverty and a lack of basic education affect the daily life of every neighbour in the area. He and Seyed continue to have more meaningful discussions about life, education and opportunity, but no conclusion is really achieved. They are both so sorry about how they have become that they cry at the first opportunity to have an evening meal with aragh, an anise-based alcoholic drink. Ghodrat knows that his time there is limited and that he must find a way out.\nThe police come for Ghodrat after his picture had appeared in local newspapers as a \"wanted and dangerous man\"; presumably, one of the local people had informed the police of his whereabouts. The police besiege the house for several hours, but Ghodrat does not surrender. Seyed arrives home to discover the escalating situation, fearing Ghodrat's death at the hands of the large police force. He implores the police chief to allow him to enter the house in order to persuade Ghodrat to surrender. Feeling responsible for the danger in which his friend is now involved, Ghodrat beseeches Seyed not to intervene and to go away before he is hurt. However, Seyed chooses to remain with Ghodrat. He runs away from the police and is shot in the shoulder but eventually manages to get into the room with Ghodrat.\nThe two friends reflect on the nearly certain death they are facing.

The evil Milady de Winter, who wants revenge on junior musketeer d'Artagnan, seduces him to keep him occupied. He soon discovers her true nature, however, and also that she was once married to his fellow musketeer Athos, who had supposedly killed her after discovering that she was a branded criminal.\nThe trio of musketeers \u2014 Athos, Porthos, and Aramis \u2014 rescue Constance from imprisonment in Rochefort's abode of Saint Cloud and take her to safety in the convent of Armenti\u00e8res. De Winter sends d'Artagnan poisoned wine and a note intended to trick him into thinking that the trio have been imprisoned for drunkenness. On his way to bail them out, d'Artagnan is attacked by Rochefort and his men. The trio join the fight, and Rochefort flees. One of his men is captured and tortured for information, revealing that Richelieu is going to the Dovecote Inn near La Rochelle, but then drinks the poisoned wine and dies, revealing de Winter's trap. The trio then proceed to the inn where they spy on Richelieu. The Cardinal orders de Winter to threaten the Duke of Buckingham with exposure of his affair with the Queen, to discourage him from sending a relief force to aid the rebels; she is to kill the Duke if he does not comply. In return, de Winter asks for a warrant, so she can kill d'Artagnan and Constance. Richelieu reluctantly signs one, wording it in a way that leaves no evidence against himself: \"By my order and for the good of the state, the bearer has done what has been done.\"\nAfter revealing himself to de Winter, Athos takes the death warrant from her and later tells d'Artagnan of the plot. D'Artagnan sends his servant Planchet to warn the Duke. In England, de Winter asks Buckingham not to help the rebels, but he refuses. De Winter tries to assassinate him, but she is captured. Buckingham has his servant John Felton lock her away in the Tower of London, but she seduces Felton and convinces him that Buckingham is his enemy.

The four musketeers sentence de Winter to death by beheading, and they hire an executioner to carry out the punishment. Afterward, they are arrested by the Cardinal's guards.\nRichelieu charges d'Artagnan with murder for killing a valuable servant of the State, but d'Artagnan shows him the signed death warrant which, due to its ambiguous phrasing, appears to authorize d'Artagnan's actions. Defeated and quite impressed at d'Artagnan's achievement, the Cardinal offers him a commission for either him or one of his three friends to become an officer.

Man and Kit decides to visit the gambling den to gamble.\nChing is shown to be a ruthless and violent loan shark, who regularly assaults his thugs for failing to meet standards, and even guests who have won too much in the gambling den. Kit loses some money while Man has won some money. They later meet Bully at a diner, who also tells Man that Ching enjoys playing Mahjong and often have the advantage of having extra tiles to win his opponents. Being a skilled Mahjong player himself, Man decides to have Bully arrange a Mahjong session with Ching and other regular players. \nDuring the Mahjong session, Man puts up a good fight with Ching and is able to see through many of Ching's tricks, allowing him to win a huge sum of money from a disgruntled Ching. At the same time, he notices a bookie in the gambling den transferring bets over a telephone, and remembers what Kit says about the possibility of bookies forgetting to telephone. He quickly realises that Kit's plan could actually work. He then decides to use the winnings and have Ching's bookie to bet on the hot pick as off-track betting. \nMan and Kit agree to do the following: Kit will go to the greyhound track in Macau to bet on the remaining hounds, while Man will find a way to disable the telephone lines of the gambling den to prevent bookies from transferring and placing their bets while the race is ongoing. Their plan seemingly succeeded, with Man winning $320,000 from an increasingly irate Ching. However, Man's act of disabling the telephone lines is discovered by a street bum, who later informs Ching about Man's actions. Infuriated, Ching sends his thugs to go after Man. \nMan's and Kit's happiness with their newly gotten gains is short-lived, after Bully notifies Man that Ching knows about Man sabotaging the telephone lines. Knowing that they are in danger, Man and Kit decide to hide in a resort. Seeing this as an opportunity to leave his wife and sister at home, Man also invites Pei-pei to the resort while hiding. However, Siu-mei and Man's wife also decide to come to the resort unannounced, as Man's wife knows that Man will be up to no good. She eventually catches Man and Pei-pei together in the hotel, resulting in an argument. In a bid to escape the ensuing argument, Man accidentally locks himself out of his hotel room, only to realise that Ching and his thugs have already tracked him to the resort. A long dramatic chase throughout the resort ensues, which involves barging through another hotel guest's (Lee Kwan) room, the lobby, a hairdressing salon, a Japanese restaurant and kitchen.   \nThe chase ultimately ends in the resort casino, where Man tries to blend in with other gamblers but to no avail. Man ends up running to a craps table to join a game. He then secretly switches the casino dice with his own dice to 'win' many rounds of craps, much to the astonishment of other players, the dealer and Ching. Man then admits to the dealer that he has cheated in the game as a desperate attempt to be arrested by security - Man would rather be arrested than falling into Ching's hands and losing the newly gained fortune. Kit, Siu-mei and Man's wife tries looking around for Man in the casino, only to see him being escorted away from the casino by security guards. Man is imprisoned in jail once again.\nSome time has passed, and Man is released again. He meets Kit outside the prison, who is revealed to be married to Siu-mei. Kit starts telling Man about another gambling strategy that they could use to win more fortune, but Man disagrees with the plan by pointing out its many flaws. Kit then tells Man that someone used this plan and lost $300,000 last week, to which Man says that the person deserved it. Kit finally reveals that the person is him, much to Man's dismay upon realising that the newly gained winnings from Ching is all gone.

This is contrasted with the contempt with which some other managers treat the native miners. Big King is awarded a gold helmet for his heroic efforts to save others. \nIt is soon revealed that the collapse was no accident, but a failed part of a plan by a London-based criminal syndicate, which includes the mine-owner's son-in-law and director-manager Manfred Steyner, to destroy the mine so that the syndicate members can profit from share-dealing and raising the price of gold on world markets. This will be done by drilling through a deep underground greenstone wall or dike which is all that prevents an adjacent reservoir of water from flooding the mine.\nThe mine's general manager, an accomplice in the plot, was killed in the tunnel collapse. Steyner then interviews Slater, the underground manager, for the now vacant post of general manager, although the mine owner/chairman of the board Hurry Hirschfeld (Ray Milland) has the next regular man in seniority in mind as a candidate. During his interview, Slater first meets Steyner's wife Terry at their luxurious mansion and is attracted to her, but she does not at first return his interest. However, Steyner arranges for them to meet again, in the hope that Terry will influence her grandfather, Hurry Hirschfeld, an old curmudgeon whom she lovingly calls \"Poppsie\", in Slater's favour. The plan works, with two consequences: Slater becomes general manager, and he and Terry start a love affair. \nSlater, unaware of the criminal plan, agrees to carry out the drilling but is cautious enough to plant a safety charge that will block the tunnel in case of a water leak. Steyner soon finds out that Slater is having an affair with his wife, but allows it to continue because it will keep Slater away from the mine, so that the safety charge can be disabled without his knowledge. Meanwhile, syndicate head Farrell has a German member of the syndicate and his young family assassinated by bomb (in a Christmas gift box) after German stock-exchange difficulties hurt Sonderditch interests.\nWhile Slater and Terry are holidaying together over a warm Christmas, the final breach is made in the dike and a wall of water roars into the mazes of tunnels and shafts. The mine begins to flood, trapping a thousand workers. Slater hears of the disaster on the radio news, and flies with Terry in her small private plane back to the mine, making a hair-raising emergency landing on the access road. Slater and Big King descend into the mine, amidst rising flood waters, to repair and reconnect the electrical line to the explosive safety charge that will seal the dike hole. They succeed, but only because Big King sacrifices his own life to detonate the charge, letting Slater fall injured into a rubber dinghy in the flooded tunnel and escape. \nMeanwhile, Steyner is murdered by Marais, one of his accomplices, running him down with his Rolls-Royce limousine while they observe the mine rescue operations from a nearby towering rubble/slag hill after they hear radio reports of Slater's explosive charge sealing the dike and saving the mine, confirming that their plan has unraveled.

Further tension occurs when a white Cadillac Eldorado\u2014stolen as part of the order\u2014is found to contain several kilograms of heroin stashed in its trunk. Pace's brother-in-law, Eugene, sees the heroin as a profitable side business, but Pace disagrees, viewing the heroin as a threat to the security of the operation. Against Eugene's protests, Pace does not relinquish the heroin and, unbeknownst to Eugene, has the Cadillac and its contents burned.\nThe theft of all 48 vehicles is eventually completed, but the second Eleanor is discovered to be uninsured within hours of delivery to the docks. After pleas from fianc\u00e9e Pumpkin Chase, Pace agrees to return it, but only because he is aware of a third Eleanor at the International Towers in Long Beach. Meanwhile, Eugene, learning of the Cadillac's fate, confronts Pace and angrily leaves, eventually tipping off the police about Pace and the third Eleanor. As a result of the tip-off, two detectives, Butch Stockton and Phil Woods, corner Pace as he exits the International Towers. A lengthy and destructive car chase ensues, covering six California cities from Long Beach to Carson. Pace manages to evade the police, but irreparably damages the third Eleanor in the process.\nDesperate, Pace spots a fourth Eleanor Mustang at a car wash. Noticing an opportunity, Pace leaves the third Eleanor at the car wash and dupes the owner of the Mustang under the guise of being the car wash's manager. After a quick license plate swap and disguise removal, Pace leaves the car wash with the fourth Eleanor, leaving the wrecked third Eleanor for the Mustang's owner to find. The police, spotting the wrecked Mustang, quickly descend upon the scene to arrest the real car wash manager (who happens to match Pace's description), as Pace safely clears a police checkpoint in the fourth Eleanor.", "tmdb_plot": "Insurance investigator Maindrian Pace and his team lead double-lives as unstoppable car thieves.

Mimaki also states that he believes the Land God and the Mountain God are false Gods because they believe that God is in all things and any human being and living creature is able to communicate with God, and the only way for the Sun God People's kingdom to prosper is to take over the Mountain and Land People's kingdoms and force them to believe in only the Sun God. Anyone who resists will be killed.\nIn the forest, during a ritual, Himiko sees Takehiko hiding behind a tree, and engages in conversation with him. Nearby, Adahime, one of Himiko's assistants in the ritual, overhears them. Takehiko comes to the kingdom of the Sun-God people and meets Himiko in her quarters after dark. Himiko reveals that Takehiko is her half-brother. Despite this, she seduces him and they have sex. Adahime is not far away, and watches them from behind a pillar. During a ritual in the king's court the next night, Himiko addresses the court subjects of the Sun God's wishes. She states that the Sun God requires the people of the kingdom to also accept the Land God and the Mountain God as valid Gods. This shocks the people of the court. King Ohkimi refuses to believe that this is true. He restates Mimaki's assertion from earlier, that Himiko has lost her powers to speak with the Sun God, and her statement is solely out of her love for Takehiko, who is a sympathizer of the Land God People. Believing that Himiko is not wrong in her assertion, her assistant Nashime assassinates the king while the subjects are all distracted by Himiko's speech. King Ohkimi falls and Himiko takes over rule of the Sun God People. She orders anyone who did not believe in the Sun God's words that she would be ruler to be buried alive in the mountains.\nThe next night, Himiko and Takehiko again sleep together, but Takehiko is resistant to stay with her. Himiko tries to gain Takehiko's favor by offering him a cloth that she knitted. He accepts but leaves her anyway. Adahime follows him and meets him by a lake. She professes her love to him, pleading him to make love to her. After resisting, he eventually obliges. Himiko is horrified to know that her lover has been with another woman, and orders his arrest. Takehiko is captured in the mountains and brought back to the Kingdom of the Sun God. There, Himiko banishes him, but orders her subjects to first rip out all of his fingernails and tattoo his face in colors of shame. Takehiko leaves the kingdom bloody and in pain. The Mountain God People carry him up the mountain where Adahime reunites with him.\nBack in the Sun God Kingdom, Nashime consoles a broken Himiko, who feels betrayed and unloved. Himiko proceeds to perform oral sex on Nashime. Meanwhile, Mimaki and Ikume conspire to take power away from Himiko, who they still believe is not acting on the Sun God's behalf, but rather through her own love. They do their best to convince Nashime, and he eventually succumbs to the belief that Himiko has lost her powers, and he keeps her stashed away in her room and Mimaki takes the throne as the leader of the Sun God People. Nashime then tells Mimaki that the young girl Toyo will take Himiko's place as the shaman and translator of the Sun God.\nMimaki declares war on the Land and Mountain God People. The battle between the kingdoms wages in a field. Takehiko and Adahime decide to run away to be together forever, but they are ambushed in the forest by Mimaki's soldiers who pierce them with arrows. Takehiko and Adehime's corpses are brought back to the Sun God People's Kingdom to show to Himiko. She is angered and sad. Nashime again tries to console her, but she tells him to leave. Nashime realizes that Himiko has lost all her powers and possibly her mind too. While she is knitting cloth, the Mountain God People kidnap her from her room and torture her. She calls out for Nashime's help, but he only watches and cries. Himiko dies and Nashime's falls into depression, crying out in the mountains for her. Ikume and Mimaki are shown battling with swords on a ridge, and Mimaki kills Ikume.\nMimaki has a court ritual in which the new translator, Toyo, comes and declares the Sun God is still within Himiko and that the powerful country of Wei is to be given many slaves and offerings. Mimaki is disturbed by this. Nashime breaks down crying. The film flashes forward several years, and Nashime is walking in the forest, old and fragile, still crying over Himiko. He looks up and sees a helicopter. The camera pans out of the forest to reveal that it is atop a kofun, or ancient keyhole-shaped burial mound, surrounded by a suburban neighborhood with offices, houses, factories and a highway, revealing the film as a mythical fable shrouded from, yet within, modern times.

However, if two more bombs go off, the ship will sink. Fallon proceeds to disarm the bomb he is working on, apparently successfully, with his men following each step. However, it contains a hidden secondary mechanism and one of his men, close friend Charlie Braddock, accidentally triggers it, resulting in his death when it explodes, causing further damage to the ship. A distraught Fallon abandons the operation and tells the ship's captain, Alex Brunel, to advise the shipping line to pay the ransom to avoid any more carnage.

The figure announces, in his own language, that his name is Kah, a Taoist monk and the high priest of the Temple of the Seven Golden Vampires in rural China. He goes on to tell the Count that the Seven Golden Vampires' power is fading and he needs him to restore them to their former glory. Dracula considers the offer and accepts on one condition: that he uses Kah's body to escape his castle, which has become his prison. Despite Kah's pleas for mercy, the vampire displaces himself into Kah's body and then triumphantly leaves the tomb for China.\nA century later, Professor Van Helsing gives a lecture at a Chungking university on Chinese vampire legends. He speaks of an unknown rural village that has been terrorised by a cult of seven known as the Seven Golden Vampires. A farmer who had lost his wife to the vampires trekked his way to their temple and battled them. He was unsuccessful, as his wife was killed in the fight, but in the chaos he grabbed a medallion from around one of the vampire's necks, which he saw as the vampires' life source. The farmer fled the temple, but the high priest sent the vampires and their turned victims after him. About to be cornered, the farmer placed the medallion around a small jade Buddha statue before the vampires killed him. One of the vampires spied the medallion around the Buddha and went over to collect it. However, the moment that the vampire touched the Buddha, the creature was destroyed in flames.\nVan Helsing goes on to say that he is positive that the village still exists and is terrorized by the six remaining vampires; he is only unsure of where the village lies. Most of the professors he has gathered disbelieve the story and leave, but one man, Hsi Ching, informs Van Helsing that the farmer from the story was his grandfather. He proves it by producing the dead vampire's medallion and asks Van Helsing if he would be willing to travel to the village and destroy the vampire menace. Van Helsing agrees and embarks with his son Leyland, Hsi Ching, and his seven kung fu-trained siblings on a dangerous journey, funded by a wealthy widow named Vanessa Buren, whom Leyland and two of Ching's siblings saved from an attack by the tongs.\nOn the journey, the group are ambushed by the six remaining vampires in a cave, along with their army of undead. The group are quickly engaged in battle and soon kill the three vampires. The remaining three retreat, taking their army of undead with them. The following morning, the party reaches the village, partly ruined but still populated, and prepares to make their final stand. They use wooden stakes as barriers and dig a large trench around them filled with flammable liquid. In the temple that evening, Dracula, still disguised as Kah, calls on the remaining vampires to kill Van Helsing and his party once and for all. The vampires reach the village, and soon Van Helsing's group once again do battle with the last of the golden vampires and their army of undead, resulting in a brutal fight that kills two vampires, many undead servants, several villagers, and several of Van Helsing's companions. During the fight, Vanessa is bitten by one of the vampires and quickly becomes one herself. She bites Ching, who throws himself and Vanessa onto a wooden stake, impaling them both.\nElsewhere, the last remaining vampire captures Ching's sister Mai Kwei and takes her back to the temple in order to be drained of her blood.

George crosses the river on foot to a farm where several men from the Ministry of Agriculture are using an experimental machine in a field. While asking for directions, he inquires about their machinery, which they explain is designed to kill insects through ultra-sonic radiation. Meanwhile, while Edna waits at the car, she is attacked by a man who emerges from the river. She runs to find George for help, but her attacker is gone when they return to the car.\nNight falls and the film shifts focus: Edna's sister, Katie, is shown awaiting Edna's arrival, and is revealed to be addicted to heroin. Katie gets into an argument with her photographer husband, Martin, about her sister's impending arrival. Martin goes down to a waterfall near their remote cottage to complete a night-shoot of some plant specimens. Meanwhile, Katie, while preparing to take heroin, is attacked by the same man who Edna had encountered earlier. Katie is pursued to Martin's photo-shoot, where the man kills Martin, and Katie flees just as George and Edna arrive. When the three report the death, the aggressive police sergeant suspects foul-play from the trio. George, forced to stay in Southgate as a person-of-interest to the investigation, secretly takes the roll of film from Martin's camera to a local chemist to have it developed. Katie has a breakdown and is hospitalised. Visiting the hospital, babies are acting strangely, biting and scratching people with homicidal intensity.\nBack at the chemist's, George and Edna collect the photos, but the dead man does not appear in any of the pictures; the man, it turns out, is a local vagrant who drowned in the river. The sergeant arrives and confiscates the photos and, when the couple leaves, sends one of his officers, PC Craig, to follow them. They go to the graveyard and in a room in the chapel find a half-eaten meal. Following noises to a crypt, they come across the vagrant's casket empty, along with a murdered man. Locked into the crypt by an unseen figure, they again encounter the zombified vagrant, who brings the other bodies to life by touching their eyes with his blood-stained fingers. The pair manage to make their escape along a ladder, kicking out a hole to climb into a freshly-dug grave.  PC Craig arrives and helps Edna out of the pit.

George heads to the experimental agricultural machine, where the farmer and two government men do not believe George, and reveal that the machine is now working with a newly effective five-mile radius. They try to stop him, but he smashes the machine.\nMeanwhile, the sergeant has found Craig and the caretaker's bodies, and thinking Edna and George may be devil worshippers, issues orders \"to shoot to kill\". He is then told that George has deliberately wrecked the machine. Edna has arrived at her brother-in-law's farm only to be met by Martin, who is now a zombie, but she manages to run over him as she escapes.

Responding to pressure from the head guard and coach, Captain Wilhelm Knauer, a reluctant Crewe eventually agrees to play in an exhibition game. Crewe forms a prison team that includes Samson, a former professional weightlifter, and Connie Shokner, a killer and martial arts expert.\nAided by the clever Caretaker, former professional player Nate Scarboro and the first black inmate willing to play, \"Granny\" Granville, plus long-term prisoner Pop\u2014and the warden's amorous secretary, Miss Toot\u2014Crewe molds a team nicknamed the \"Mean Machine\".

Alma\u2019s lover Max is also on the train, urging her to leave Mahler and get off with him a couple of stops before Vienna.\nThe idyllic hut on the pier is seen in the first flashback: Mahler is trying to compose in it, and he gets Alma to go around the whole lake hushing the animals and people who are making noise.

Franz Josef is far too young for the early 1900s, when the movie is set, and makes more and more outrageous demands on Mahler, ending by making him expose the physical evidence that he is Jewish and rejecting him on those grounds. It turns out this is not the real Emperor but a friend of Mahler\u2019s who thinks he\u2019s the Emperor, and the locale is the asylum. In another episode, Alma wants to compose music too and Mahler\u2019s lead singer sings her song, but Mahler tells her her job is wife and mother and composition is too stressful, citing their mad friend and Mahler\u2019s brother, whose lack of success at it led to his mental breakdown and suicide.

She is depicted goose-stepping around in horrible black-lipped makeup, wearing a Prussian helmet and a bathing suit with a cross on the front and a swastika on the rear.\nIn a final flashback, Alma is very upset and attacks him in the hut on the pier because he wrote the song cycle Songs on the Death of Children (Kindertotenlieder). This is conflated with the actual death of one of his children, but that really happened years later.\nThe doctor on the train who tended him tells him he\u2019s in perfect health. Mahler tells Alma she has the choice of getting off before Vienna with Max at his stop or staying with him. She wants to know if he has ever put her before his music; he says all his music is about and for her, that she is his music. They kiss, and Max gets off without her.

He scares away a man who is attempting to steal his 1973 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, only to immediately be shot at by someone else. Returning fire, he kills the assailant, who he recognizes as a professional hitman.\nMcQ goes to see Boyle at Harborview Medical Center. Boyle is unconscious and in critical condition, but McQ talks with Boyle's wife, Lois, before going to the police station. Although Captain Edward Kosterman believes the shootings are the work of counterculture militants, McQ is convinced local shipping magnate and suspected narcotics dealer Manny Santiago, who is being investigated by McQ and Boyle, is responsible.\nDespite a warning from Kosterman to leave the shooting investigation to other detectives, McQ begins tailing Santiago. When he learns Boyle has died, he follows Santiago into a men's room and beats him viciously. Threatened with desk duty, McQ resigns, against the urgings of Franklyn Toms, a field deputy who works as a liaison between the city council and police department.\nContinuing to investigate the case through a partnership with local private eye \"Pinky\" Farrell, McQ learns from Rosey and Myra, two of Boyle's informants, that Santiago has assembled a team to steal the confiscated drugs that are housed in the police department's evidence vault. He follows the drugs when they are taken by representatives from the State Attorney General's Office to be destroyed at a secret location, which, this time, is a hospital. Santiago's team, disguised as employees of the laundry service, steals the drugs, and McQ gives chase, but they get away. Kosterman forces McQ to forfeit his personal revolver, so McQ goes to a gun store and acquires a pistol and a MAC-10 submachine gun.\nThat night, McQ breaks into Santiago's office, but is caught. Santiago reveals the drugs his team stole turned out to be powdered sugar, the real drugs having been replaced in the evidence vault by corrupt members of the police department, and lets McQ go, though not before paying him back for the earlier beating.\nNow suspecting Kosterman may have been responsible for Boyle's death, McQ revisits Boyle's informants and learns there were rumors Boyle was dirty. Then, with him inside, McQ's car is crushed between two semi-trucks. He deduces the unusual attack was intended to separate him from his car, rather than kill him, so he leaves the hospital to inspect his car at the impound lot and discovers the missing drugs hidden inside. Kosterman arrives with backup, saying there was an anonymous tip about the location of the drugs, but McQ manages to escape.\nIn the morning, McQ knocks on Lois' door. She says she is leaving to visit her parents, and McQ tags along. When they are near the Pacific Ocean, he tells her that he knows Boyle stashed the drugs in his car, and accuses Lois of helping Boyle's accomplice double-cross him. McQ finds the drugs in Lois' suitcase and, when a car begins to follow them, directs her to take a turnoff to the beach. He kills the other driver in the ensuing shootout and discovers the dead man is Toms.\nSantiago and his men arrive in two cars, and McQ leads them on a high-speed chase down the beach, followed by a standoff that ends with everyone dead, except for McQ, thanks to his MAC-10, and Lois, who is subsequently locked up.

The other passengers are American widow Harriet Belinda Hubbard; English governess Mary Debenham; Swedish missionary Greta Ohlsson; American businessman Samuel Ratchett, with his secretary/translator Hector McQueen and English valet Edward Beddoes; Italian-American car salesman Antonio (\"Gino\") Foscarelli; elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian Count Rudolf Andrenyi and his wife Elena; British Indian Army Colonel John Arbuthnott; and American theatrical agent Cyrus Hardman.\nThe morning after the train departs, Ratchett tries to secure Poirot's services as a bodyguard for $15,000 as he has received death threats. Poirot declines Ratchett's offer, telling him, \"...my interest in your case is... dwindling.\" That night, Bianchi gives Poirot his compartment and shares a coach with Stavros Constantine, a Greek doctor. The train is stopped by a snowdrift between Vinkovci and Brod in Yugoslavia, and Poirot is awoken from sleep several times, once by a scream from Ratchett's cabin. The next morning, Ratchett is found stabbed to death, and Bianchi asks Poirot to solve the case. Poirot enlists help from Dr. Constantine, who ascertains that Ratchett was stabbed 12 times in a distorted pattern and with seemingly varying accuracy and lethality.\nFound at the crime scene is a fragment of a letter, revealing that Ratchett was actually Lanfranco Cassetti, a gangster, who five years earlier planned the kidnapping and murder of Daisy Armstrong, infant daughter of wealthy British Army Colonel Hamish Armstrong and his American wife, Sonia. Cassetti had a Mafia colleague help him kidnap and kill Daisy, but then betrayed him and fled the country with the ransom money; he was only revealed on the eve of his partner's execution. Overcome with grief, the pregnant Mrs. Armstrong gave premature birth to a stillborn baby and died in the process. Colonel Armstrong, consumed by grief from the loss of his family, committed suicide. A French maidservant named Paulette, wrongly suspected of complicity in the kidnapping, had also committed suicide to avoid being arrested, but was found innocent afterwards. Further clues are discovered, including a pipe cleaner, a handkerchief with the initial \"H\", Cassetti's broken watch, and a conductor's suit. Poirot's timeline of passenger activities the night before indicates that Cassetti was murdered at about 1:15 a.m., the time of the smashed watch and the scream. As the coach was isolated through the night, the murderer must be one of its passengers or the train's French conductor, Pierre Michel. Mrs. Hubbard reports that she detected a man in her room, later finding the bloodied knife discarded in her compartment. Foscarelli dramatically hints the murder was most likely part of a Mafia feud.\nPoirot interviews the passengers and Pierre. He learns McQueen was the son of the Armstrong case's District Attorney and was very fond of Mrs. Armstrong; Beddoes had been a British Army batman; Greta Ohlsson appears to have limited knowledge of English but has been to America; Countess Andrenyi is of German descent, and her maiden name is Gr\u00fcnwald (German for \"Greenwood\", Mrs. Armstrong's maiden name); Pierre Michel's daughter died five years earlier of scarlet fever; Colonel Arbuthnott, who displays knowledge of Armstrong's military decorations, reveals his plans to marry Miss Debenham once his divorce from his philandering\nwife is finalized, which he claims was what the cryptic discussion Poirot overheard in Istanbul was about. When Poirot questions Princess Dragomiroff, he discovers she was a friend of Linda Arden, retired American actress and Mrs. Armstrong's mother; the Princess was Sonia's godmother. He learns that the Armstrongs had a butler, a secretary, a cook, a chauffeur, and a nursemaid. Poirot flatters the Princess's maid, Schmidt, by noting how fine a cook she is, throwing her off. Foscarelli denies having been a chauffeur. Hardman reveals he is, in fact, a Pinkerton detective hired as a bodyguard by Cassetti. When Poirot shows him the photo of Paulette, he is visibly moved.\nPoirot gathers the suspects and describes two solutions to the murder. He advises them not to automatically dismiss either. The first suggests Cassetti's murder was a Mafia feud killing - an unknown man disguised himself as conductor, stabbed Ratchett/Cassetti, and, disregarding the uniform coat, with the undetected assailant escaping from the train through the snow. This is rejected by Bianchi and Dr. Constantine as absurd but Poirot tells them they may reconsider that opinion. \nThe second, more complex and far-reaching solution links all the suspects in the coach to the Armstrong case. In addition to self-incriminating revelations Poirot had managed to extract from Hardman, McQueen, Schmidt, and the Princess, the detective has deduced Countess Elena is actually Mrs. Armstrong's younger sister, Helena. The Princess claimed the Armstrongs' secretary's was a \"Miss Freebody\"; this is in fact Mary Debenham, freely associated from the well-known British department store (at that time known as \"Debenhams and Freebody\"). Beddoes was Armstrong's butler in the Army; Greta Ohlsson was Daisy's nursemaid; Colonel Arbuthnott was a close army friend of Armstrong; Foscarelli was the family's chauffeur; Pierre was Paulette's father; Hardman was a policeman in love with Paulette; and Mrs. Hubbard is in fact Linda Arden, Mrs. Armstrong's mother - and arguably the brains behind this whole plan. McQueen had drugged Cassetti, rendering him unconscious and allowing the conspirators to murder him jointly (the Andrenyis stabbing together), totaling 12 \u2013 the  complement of a typical jury \u2013 wounds of differing damage. The scream and broken watch were provided by McQueen to persuade Poirot that the murder had occurred earlier, when the other suspects were in the clear. In fact, the suspects joined to commit the murder once Poirot had returned to sleep, after two o'clock. The only passengers not involved in the murder are Signor Bianchi and Dr. Constantine.\nPoirot asks Bianchi to choose one solution before the train is freed from the snowdrift, but admits that the Yugoslavian police will much prefer the simple one. Bianchi, in sympathy with the suspects after learning how evil Cassetti was, proposes the first solution, and Dr. Constantine and Poirot agree, although he will struggle with his conscience.

Two other Yamamori Family members, lieutenant Naotake Aoki and senior officer Shigeru Nanba, arrive to collect Yamamori and provide Makio with a clean gun to kill Boss Asada. Makio then allows himself to be arrested for his crime and is sentenced to eight years in prison.\nNine years later, Makio is visited by both Yamamori and Aoki and learns that the family is divided, with Yamamori claiming that Aoki is jealous of his success and wants to seize power for himself, and Aoki countering the boss's accusations by revealing that Yamamori forced himself on his girlfriend while he was serving time several years earlier and arguing that he is too old and useless to lead the family. Makio makes parole and Yamamori instructs his nephew Kenji to provide Makio with a room and a monthly salary, and sends several yakuza, including Makio's childhood friend Noburo Kitami, to protect him. Makio correctly suspects that all of these gifts are intended to win his favor.

We see that only the dead body of older Silvia is on the pavement down below. \nSilvia's body is then seen in a dark chamber in the same abandoned tunnel system seen earlier in the movie. A large crowd of people dressed in blue lab coats stand around the body. We see that Roberto, Nicola and her neighbor are all alive and standing over Silvia's body.

A firing squad executes a small group of Spanish rebels who cry out \"Long live chains!\" or \"Death to the gabachos!\" \u2013 a Spanish pejorative term for \"Frenchmen\". The troops are encamped in a Catholic church which they desecrate by drinking, singing, and eating the communion wafers. The captain caresses a statue of Do\u00f1a Elvira de Casta\u00f1eda and is knocked unconscious by the statue of her husband, Don Pedro L\u00f3pez de Ayala. In revenge, the captain exhumes Do\u00f1a Elvira's body to find her face has not decomposed; there is a suggestion of intended necrophilia.\nCut to the present day where a nanny is reading the voice-over from a book whilst seated on a park bench. The children in her care are given some pictures by a strange man in the park. There are implications of child abduction or paedophilia. Cut to a close-up of a spider and the interior of a bourgeois apartment where a man is \"fed up with symmetry\" as he rearranges his mantelpiece. The children arrive home and show the pictures to their parents who are shocked that the girls have such images. The parents are disgusted and yet erotically stimulated by the images. When we see the images, they are revealed as picture postcards of French architecture. The parents then let the children keep the pictures and dismiss the nanny. At bedtime, the husband cannot sleep as he is kept awake by a cockerel, a watch-carrying woman, a postman and an emu wandering through his bedroom.\nIn the next scene, the husband visits his doctor, who dismisses these nighttime experiences as apparitions despite the fact that the husband has physical evidence in the form of a letter from the nocturnal postman. The evidence is never considered as the doctor's nurse interrupts the conversation to tell her employer that she must visit her sick father. The nurse drives through a rainy night, meeting a military tank on the road that is apparently hunting foxes. The soldiers tell her that the road ahead is blocked. The nurse drives to an isolated inn.\nA storm breaks as the nurse checks in at the small rural inn. Some Carmelite monks are also staying at the hotel. She takes supper in her room while a flamenco dancer and guitarist perform in an adjacent room. The monks interrupt her as she is dressing for bed. They offer to use a holy effigy and prayer to assist her sick father then begin to pray. Time has passed and the monks are playing a game of poker with the nurse and the proprietor, gambling with holy relics, smoking and drinking alcohol.\nThat same night, some new guests arrive at the hotel; a young man and his aunt. The young nephew has brought his aunt to the hotel for an incestuous affair. They retire to their room, the elderly aunt confesses that she is a virgin, when the nephew pulls back the sheets to look at her naked body, she has the body of a young woman. The nephew is refused by his aunt and leaves his room to join another couple (a hatter and his female assistant) for a drink. The nurse and the four monks are also invited into the hatter's room. While the guests are socialising, the hatter's assistant dons a dominatrix outfit with a whip. The hatter, who is wearing bottomless trousers, proceeds to be masochistically flagellated by his assistant in front of the other guests who are shocked and leave. The nephew returns to his aunt, who is now willing to make love with him.\nThe next morning, the nurse leaves for the town of Argenton, giving a lift to another resident who is having breakfast in the bar. This resident is a professor at the police academy. He is dropped off at work where he gives a lecture to a class of delinquent policemen, who behave like schoolchildren, on the subject of the relativism of laws, customs and taboos. The lecture is constantly interrupted, until only two officers are left in the class. The professor continues, using a dinner party at his friends' house to illustrate a point he is making. We then cut to the 'dinner' party which is being held in a modern bourgeois apartment.\nThe guests are seated around the table on flushing toilets. They politely discuss various issues around the topic of defecation whilst publicly using the toilets that they are sitting on. When a guest is hungry, he excuses himself and retires to the dining room, a private cubicle, to eat food.\nWe cut back to the police lecture. The two policeman go on duty where they stop a speeding motorist (Mr Legendre) who is rushing to see his doctor. Mr Legendre is eventually told by his doctor that he has cancer and offered a cigarette; he slaps his doctor and returns home. Once home, he tells his wife that nothing is wrong with him. They receive a telephone call informing them that their daughter has disappeared from school.\nWe now cut to the school where the teachers insist that the little girl has vanished despite the fact that she is physically present. Her disappearance is reported to the police, the girl is present but none of the adults admit to her presence. In this absurdist scene, she is there \u2013 the adults are able to see and speak to her \u2013 yet they act as if she is missing. Finally, the policeman charged with finding her is given her photograph and asks if he can take her with him.\nWe follow one of the policemen, who is having his shoes shined. We then follow the man who is sitting next to him to the top of a tower block (the Tour Montparnasse). This man is a sniper who randomly kills people in the streets below. He is arrested, found guilty, and sentenced to death but leaves the courtroom to be treated as a celebrity.\nMr Legendre is called to see the Prefect of Police who returns the missing daughter. The Prefect is about to read a letter explaining how the girl was found, but is interrupted and leaves to visit a bar. In the bar, he meets a woman who looks like his dead sister (we see a flashback in which he remembers his sister playing the piano, naked). He then receives a telephone call from his dead sister, asking him to meet her at the mausoleum. When he visits the cemetery at night, he finds a telephone in the crypt by his sister's coffin and her hair is hanging out of the coffin. He is suddenly arrested for desecration by officers who refuse to believe that he is the Prefect of Police.\nThe Prefect is taken to his office, where a different man has taken his place. The two men treat each other cordially and discuss crowd control as if they are acquainted. We see the animals in the zoo, the two police chiefs arrive, and direct police control of an unseen riot.

Swan believes Winslow's music perfect to open The Paradise \u2014 Swan's highly anticipated new concert hall \u2014 and has his right-hand man Arnold Philbin steal it, under the guise of producing Winslow.\nOne month later, Winslow goes to Swan's Death Records to follow up about his music but is thrown out. He sneaks into Swan's private mansion and observes several women rehearsing his music for an audition. One is Phoenix, an aspiring singer whom Winslow deems perfect for his music. Winslow realizes Swan's plan to open the Paradise with his music after he is thrown out again. In response, he disguises himself as a woman to sneak in and try to speak to Swan. Swan has Winslow beaten and framed for drug dealing. Winslow is given a life sentence in Sing Sing prison and his teeth are extracted and replaced with metal ones as part of an experimental prisoner program to decrease infection amongst inmates, funded by the Swan Foundation.\nSix months later, Winslow hears that the Juicy Fruits have made an anticipated hit record of his music with Swan's backing. After a breakdown, he escapes prison in a delivery box and breaks into the Death Records building. A guard startles Winslow as he is destroying the records and presses, causing him to slip and fall face first into a record press, which crushes and burns the right half of his face, also destroying his vocal cords. He barely manages to escape the studio, falling into the East River as the police arrive.\nA disoriented, and now deformed, Winslow sneaks into The Paradise's costume department and dons a long, black cape and a silver, owl-like mask, becoming the Phantom of the Paradise. He terrorizes Swan and his musicians and nearly kills the Beach Bums (formerly the Juicy Fruits, who have traded doo-wop for surf music) with a bomb while they are playing a heavily reworked version of Winslow's own Faust song. The Phantom confronts Swan, who recognizes him as Winslow and offers the composer a chance to have his music produced his way. In a specially built recording studio, Swan provides the Phantom with an electronic voice-box, enabling him to speak and sing. Swan asks Winslow to rewrite his cantata with Phoenix in mind for the lead. Although Winslow agrees and signs a contract in blood, Swan breaks the deal by telling Philbin that he resents Phoenix's perfection for the role. The Phantom completes Faust, but Swan replaces Phoenix with a pill-popping male glam rock prima donna named Beef in the lead of Winslow's Faust and relegates Phoenix to backup.\nSwan steals the completed cantata and seals the Phantom inside the recording studio with a brick wall. Winslow escapes and confronts Beef, in a comic allusion to the shower scene in Psycho, and threatens to kill him if he performs. Beef tries to flee, but is forced by Philbin to stay and play with the band the Undeads (the Juicy Fruits/Beach Bums rebranded again as a glam/goth act) who now all resemble Cesare the Somnambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. As Beef performs, the Phantom, hidden in the rafters, strikes and electrocutes Beef with a stage prop. Horrified, Philbin orders Phoenix onstage and she is an immediate sensation.\nSwan seduces Phoenix in her dressing room after the show with promises of stardom. As she leaves, she is spirited away by the Phantom to the roof. The Phantom tells Phoenix his true identity and implores her to leave The Paradise so Swan won't destroy her too. But Phoenix does not recognize or believe him and flees. At Swan's mansion, the Phantom observes Swan and Phoenix in a tight embrace. Heartbroken, he stabs himself through the heart with a bowie knife. However, Swan tells the Phantom that he cannot die until Swan himself has died. The Phantom attempts to stab Swan, but Swan is unharmed. Looking down at Winslow, Swan hisses in an almost reptilian voice, \"I'm under contract, too.\"\nRolling Stone announces the wedding between Swan and Phoenix during Faust's finale. The Phantom learns that Swan made a pact with the Devil in 1953: Swan will remain youthful forever unless the videotaped recording of his contract is destroyed, and photos age and fester in his place. The tape reveals footage of Winslow signing his contract with Swan and a new one Swan made with Phoenix. On a live television camera, the Phantom realizes Swan is planning to have Phoenix assassinated during the ceremony. He destroys all the recordings and heads off to the wedding.\nDuring the wedding, an extravaganza with dancing women dressed as black birds (alluding to Swan Lake), the Phantom stops the assassin from hitting Phoenix; the Pope-costumed Philbin is shot and killed instead. The Phantom swings onto the stage and rips off Swan's mask, exposing him as a decaying monster on live television. A crazed Swan attempts to strangle Phoenix but the Phantom intervenes and stabs him repeatedly. In doing so, the Phantom's own stab wound reopens and he starts bleeding. As he is dying, Swan is carried around by the audience, who join in the mania, stabbing him. The dying Winslow removes his mask to reveal his own face and holds out a hand to Phoenix.

He sees his parents before him, trying to soothe him after a bout of carsickness. Just days before they were to pick him up, a military uprising cut Segovia off from the Republican part of Spain and Luis found himself trapped in the menacing environment of his mother's Nationalist relatives for the duration of the war.\nAfter this first remembrance of his carsickness, Luis continues his journey. Arriving in Segovia, he makes contact with his aunt Pilar and his cousin Ang\u00e9lica, his sweetheart during his Segovian captivity.

After his evocation of the school bombing, Luis has an emotional encounter with his cousin Ang\u00e9lica in which she speaks to him of her failed marriage. She intimates a reawakening of the affection she once had for Luis. However, this reinforces Luis's determination to leave Segovia finally. After saying goodbye to his adult relatives, he goes for a bike ride with Ang\u00e9lica's daughter, which triggers his memory of his thwarted escape with his cousin through Nationalist lines in an effort to rejoin his parents.

Vaslovik had developed plans to build a superhuman android. A team of the world's foremost experts is able to build the android even though they do not understand the components with which they are working \u2014 they are only able to follow the instructions and install the parts left by Vaslovik, who has disappeared. Attempts to decode the programming tape were worse than merely unsuccessful\u2014they also erased approximately half of the tape's contents. They decide to substitute their own programming, over the objections of Jerry Robinson (Mike Farrell), the only team member who had actually worked with Dr. Vaslovik. He is overruled by the head of the project, Geoffrey Darrow (John Vernon). When the android's body has been finished, the new tape is loaded, but with no apparent results. In desperation, Robinson persuades Darrow to allow Vaslovik's tape \u2014 what remains of it \u2014 to be loaded. Again, the team is disappointed, as there appears to be no response.\nOnce left alone, the android comes to life. It adds various cosmetic touches to a previously featureless outer skin, transforming itself from an \"it\" to a \"him\", and he (Robert Foxworth) then leaves the laboratory to visit Vaslovik's office and archives; it is there that he first identifies himself as \"part of Project Questor\". The android then seeks out Robinson, whom he forces to accompany him in a search for Vaslovik, with Darrow in pursuit of both, following a minuscule datum in his original programming.\nQuestor (who becomes more \"human\" as the story progresses) only knows that it has something to do with an \"aquatic vehicle\" \u2014 a boat \u2014 and that if he does not find Vaslovik before the end of a countdown, the nuclear generator in his abdomen will overload and explode. Vaslovik had programmed this into him to prevent his creation from being misused, and time is running out. The pair, traveling to England, escape from custody and travel to the home of Lady Helena Trimble (Dana Wynter), who had known and worked with Vaslovik. (Her name was an homage to Bjo Trimble, who had led the fan campaign to keep Star Trek on the air.) After Robinson refuses Questor's na\u00efve suggestion that the scientist seduce Lady Helena as a way to get information, Questor announces that he will make the attempt, adding, \"I am fully functional.\"\nJust as Questor deciphers the clues and tells Robinson that he knows where Vaslovik is, he is machine gunned by a British soldier in a park, whereupon he returned to the laboratory. Robinson repairs Questor, and Darrow gives him two options: If Robinson puts a homing transmitter inside the android, they will be given a plane to go find Vaslovik, but if Robinson refuses, the android will simply be flown to a safe location where the explosion will not endanger anyone. Robinson implants the beacon, and they jet off to Mount Ararat; the \"boat\" imperative, as Questor had realized just minutes before being shot, had referred to Noah's Ark.\nRobinson and Questor reach a cave concealed inside Mount Ararat with seconds to spare. Questor's timer is made safe, and he has found Emil Vaslovik (Lew Ayres), who tells Questor and Robinson that he, too, is an android. Questor is the last of a series, going back to \"the dawn of this world,\" left there by \"Masters\" to serve and protect mankind. They functioned by a law which Vaslovik quotes to Questor:\n\n\"We protect, but we do not interfere. Man must make his own way. We guide him \u2014 but always without his knowledge.\"\nEach of the Masters' previous androids had a lifespan of several hundred years, at the end of which each assembled its replacement. The unexpected, rapid advent of nuclear physics and the radioactive fallout from above-ground nuclear testing had damaged Vaslovik. Questor's design corrected these failures, and finally Vaslovik is able to die in peace, after asking Robinson to help Questor learn about humanity.\nDarrow, having followed the pair, has heard enough to know how important it is that Questor be allowed to fulfill his mission. Unfortunately, he has brought the military with him to destroy the android. The cynical Darrow believes that this is proof that humanity does not deserve Questor's help. Questor convinces him otherwise.\nDeciding to sacrifice his own life for Questor's sake, Darrow takes the transmitter and leaves, telling the military commander that not only had Vaslovik gone insane, but also that the android has escaped, and to send in jet fighters when the beacon signal is picked up. He then takes off in the jet that Questor and Robinson had used, turning on the transmitter as he goes so that they will think that the android is aboard.\nRobinson and Questor, now outside the cave, look up into the sky. Robinson tells Questor that he cannot see anything, to which the android replies, \"I wish that I could not.\" This is notably his first verbal expression of emotion, Questor's first visual expression of emotion had occurred when his timer had been made safe; he had then regarded Robinson with a smile.

The plan fails, however, as Prell returns to the house claiming he was knocked down by the monster, who escapes with the leg in its jaws. Prell then decides to try again, using Lynn's body as bait. Karen tries to hide the body in the greenhouse, where she discovers the rest of Tom's body, and passes out. When she awakes, Dr. Prell tells her it must have been a dream as she was asleep for quite some time. Karen doesn't believe him, leading them all back to the greenhouse where they uncover Lynn's body.\nDisgusted that Dr. Prell is going to use their friend's body as bait, Karen reluctantly agrees to help out by taking photos, under the condition that they leave Boot Island whether they succeed or fail. Both Dr. Prell and Keith agree, and Karl wishes them good luck.\nThe professor ties Lynn's body to a tree and the trap is set. The Yeti appears and Keith chases it into the woods. He tracks it by the sound of its heartbeat, but makes the discovery that the sound is actually coming from a speaker attached to a tree. Someone knocks him out with a branch.\nBack at the house, Laughing Crow is shown listening to an LP record of the Yeti's heartbeat. It turns out that Dr. Prell and Werner are members of a cannibalistic cult, using the Yeti scam as a way to lure victims, and that the Yeti is actually Dr. Werner in disguise. While Karen is asleep upstairs, Keith returns to the house and discovers Dr. Prell and Dr. Werner discussing what to do with her. Werner thinks they should just kill her, but Prell says that the code calls for no body bruises and that she must be frightened to death. Keith pulls out a rifle and orders both men to put their hands up. They ignore him.\nHe shoots at them, finding out that the shells are blanks. He is then knocked unconscious by Laughing Crow. Still asleep upstairs, Karen wakes to a growling noise. She looks out the window and finds the Yeti running full speed at the house. Karen flees through the house and ends up trapped in a bathroom. She opens a cabinet to find Laughing Crow holding a knife, and dies of fright.\nWhile setting up for their big breakfast, Keith wakes up and manages to sneak away. He tries to escape in the van, but it gets stuck in the mud while he tries to hide from the party guests' funeral procession. Keith then hoofs it down to the bridge where he manages to flag down a cop who takes him back to the house.\nAt the breakfast, Prell and Werner salute the party guests and hosts, toasting the previous schemes which have provided victims. Keith returns with the policeman, only to find out that he too is a cannibal. Prell and Werner explain that the \"gin sung\" Keith has eaten is actually human flesh, and they invite him to join their cannibalistic society. They bring in Karen's body, and Laughing Crow, brandishing an electric carving knife, speaks for the first time, saying \"Mr. Henshaw \u2014 white meat or dark?\"", "tmdb_plot": "Four college students and their professor embark on a path of mystery and death while searching for the Abominable Snowman.", "tmdb_id": "84104", "wiki_id": "17179537"}, {"title": "The Shrine of Ultimate Bliss", "genres": ["Action", "Crime"], "wiki_plot": "When a tough Australian cop named Stoner (George Lazenby) discovers that his sister has overdosed on a deadly new drug called \"The Happy Pill\" (an aphrodisiac/hallucenogen mixture), he travels to Hong Kong to track down its creators.

Feluda learns that the Jaisalmer Fort is made of yellow limestone, giving it a golden glow.

Mike accepts and proves to be a shrewd operator, arranging a better van, accommodations, and a recording session for the group. Privately, Mike tells Jim that arrogant singer/ guitarist Johnny must go in order for the band to be a success. Largely through Mike's efforts, the Stray Cats have their first hit single with a song sung by Jim, even though it was released as the B-side to a song sung by Johnny.

Using the codenames Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown, they take 18 people, including the conductor and an undercover police officer, hostage in the first car.\nCommunicating over the radio with New York City Transit Police lieutenant Zachary Garber, Blue demands a $1 million ransom to be delivered exactly within one hour or he will kill one hostage for every minute it is late. Green sneezes periodically, to which Garber always responds, \"Gesundheit\". Garber, Lt. Patrone and others cooperate while speculating about the hijackers' escape plan. Garber surmises that one hijacker must be a former motorman since they were able to uncouple the head car and park it down the tunnel below 28th Street.\nConversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue is a former British Army Colonel and was a mercenary in Africa; Green was a motorman caught in a drug bust; and Blue does not trust Grey, who was ousted from the mafia for being erratic. Just then, Grey shoots and kills a supervisor sent from Grand Central as he approaches the stalled train.\nThe ransom is transported uptown in a speeding police car that crashes well before it reaches 28th Street. As the deadline is reached, Garber bluffs Blue by claiming that the money has reached the station entrance and just has to be walked down the tunnel to the train. Meanwhile a police motorcycle arrives with the ransom. As two patrolmen carry the money down the tunnel, one of many police snipers in the tunnel shoots at Brown, and the hijackers exchange gunfire with the police. In retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.\nThe money is delivered and divided among the hijackers. Blue orders Garber to restore power to the subway line, set the signals to green all the way to South Ferry, and clear the police from stations along the route. Before the process is complete, however, Green moves the train farther south. When Garber becomes alarmed, Blue explains that he wanted more distance from the police inside the tunnel.\nThe hijackers override the dead-man's switch so that the train will run without anyone at the controls. Garber joins Inspector Daniels above ground where the train stopped. The hijackers set the train in motion and get off. As the hijackers walk to the tunnel's emergency exit, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails. Unaware that the hijackers have left the train, Garber and Daniels drive south above the train's route. With no one at the controls, the train gains speed.\nThe hijackers collect their disguises and weapons for disposal, but Grey refuses to surrender his gun, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead. The undercover officer shoots and kills Brown and exchanges fire with Blue, while Green escapes through the emergency exit onto the street.\nGarber, contemplating the train's last suspicious movement, concludes that the hijackers bypassed the dead-man feature and are no longer on board. He returns to where the train had stopped, enters the same emergency exit from street level, and confronts Blue as he is about to kill the undercover officer. With no escape, Blue deliberately places his foot against the third rail and electrocutes himself.\nMeanwhile, Pelham 1-2-3 hurtles through the southbound tunnel. When it enters the South Ferry loop, its speed triggers the automatic safeties. It screeches to a halt, leaving the hostages bruised but safe.\nSince none of the three dead hijackers was a motorman, Garber surmises that the lone survivor must be.

Thunderbolt tells Lightfoot that the ones trying to kill him are members of his gang who mistakenly think Thunderbolt double-crossed them.

In the city where the bank is located, the men find jobs to raise money for needed equipment while they plan the heist.\nWhen the robbery begins, Thunderbolt and Red hold a guard at gunpoint and force him to reveal the access codes to outer doors of the safe. Lightfoot, dressed as a woman, distracts the Western Union office's security guard, deactivates the ensuing alarm, and is picked up by Goody.

They flee in the car, with Red and Goody in the trunk, to a nearby drive-in movie in progress. After hearing a sneeze from the trunk and seeing a shirt tail protruding from the trunk lid, the theater manager suspects someone is hiding in the trunk to avoid paying and so goes to investigate. As wailing police cars begin to close in on the drive-in theater and as the theater manager gets nearer, Red becomes increasingly agitated and Thunderbolt drives out of the drive-in, encountering police at the exit. During the ensuing chase, Goody is shot as the police open fire on the vehicle. Red, callous as ever, throws him out of the trunk onto a dirt road, where he dies.\nRed then forces Thunderbolt and Lightfoot to stop the car.

Gianni refuses the case, telling the client that refusal is due to the problems of the firm's head, La Rosa, now a deputy, who is accused of many political and financial misconducts. They are talking on the subject when Elide, the client's youngest daughter enters and falls instantly in love with Gianni. She leaves, and the client tries to bribe Gianni to take the case. Gianni neither accepts nor refuses.\nNicola tries to work in Rome as a film critic and attempts to start a magazine, Cine Culture, but he fails everywhere.\nYears later, Antonio and Nicola are having lunch at their usual restaurant when Luciana enters.

They start talking and Luciana asks about Gianni, who she hasn't seen in a long time. The news fires Antonio's hopes.\nLater at night, the three of them are drunk and Nicola is playing a reconstruction on the stairs of Piazza di Spagna of the famous Stairs Scene from the Battleship Potemkin movie (by Sergey Eisenstein, 1925), obviously trying to make Luciana laugh. Antonio is sitting alone, down the stairs, deep in his thoughts, smoking. He can't stand Nicola's game and argues with Luciana. She says she can do whatever she pleases, including becoming an actress. Antonio leaves, pissed, while Luciana hides in a photo-booth and Nicola follows Antonio, trying to calm him down.

She lives in a hotel room with other artists. Antonio is already there, nursing her. When Nicola comes back in, she asks him if he told Antonio about \"them\". Nicola slaps her.

They are partying for his client's 69th birthday. Elide tells Gianni how happy she is to be married with him and about that other life, she would have had, if he had married another woman. This flashes Gianni back to Luciana, his forgotten love.\nGianni and Elide are having a family diner when they see Nicola on TV in a quiz show about Italian cinema. Antonio also happens to see the show from his ward. Nicola answers all the questions right and wins a considerable amount of money and the right to come back the following week on the show. He immediately calls his wife, with whom he is reconciled. She advises that he takes the money without risking it at the next show. He claims his target is not the money but that his book \"Cinema as a school\" be published, which an editor promised to do if he won the grand prize of the show.\nThe next show begins. Nicola plays double or nothing, risking to loose all he has won. He is asked a question about Vittorio de Sica which he answers but his answer is deemed wrong by the jury. He complains but is expelled from the show, losing the money.\nAntonio is still working in the hospital.

Tired of the game, willing to prove her love, she takes her car, starts the engine and rushes to her death.\nNicola and a friend are at a festival where Vittorio De Sica is being interviewed. He tells the anecdote proving that Nicola was right in his answer in the show. This saddens Nicola. His friend tells him to go talk to De Sica, the model of all his life, but Nicola refuses, saying he has no more to say to him. He wanted to change the world, but the world has changed him.\nAntonio is driving into Rome when he sees Gianni. He goes to him, they awkwardly talk, realizing they have not seen each other in some 25 years. Gianni pretends to be broke. They agree on meeting with Nicola, who is now a stringer for a newspaper. Gianni knows he will not go to the meeting but when he returns to his palace, he realizes it is empty, his wife is dead, his children are gone, only his father-in-law, who will not die, remains. Gianni realizes he is doomed and he decides to go to the meeting with his old friends.\nThe three meet in the usual restaurant and talk joyfully about the past. Gianni breaks the good mood when he says they are a generation of bastards who did nothing to fulfill the hopes they had for a better world when the war ended. They blame each other's political views and fight again, drunk in the streets. When they stop, Nicola breaks into tears for what seems to be an acceptation of his failure. Instead, he reveals that his son is getting married, and that he actually cries for joy.\nThey all take a car and go to Antonio's wife, who turns up to be Luciana. When Nicola and Gianni see her, they realize they both still have feelings for her. Gianni is left talking alone with Luciana and tells her that he stayed in love with her through all the years.

Tanner hopes that Kilmer can rescue the girl using his Japanese connections.\nKilmer and Tanner had been Marine MPs in Tokyo during the post-war occupation. Kilmer became aware of a woman, Eiko, who was involved in the black market so that she could procure penicillin for her sick daughter. Kilmer intervened on behalf of Eiko during a skirmish, saving her life. After they'd been living together, with Kilmer repeatedly asking Eiko to marry him, her brother Ken returned from an island where he'd been stranded as an Imperial Japanese soldier. Both outraged that she was living with his former enemy and deeply indebted to Kilmer for saving the lives of his (apparently) only remaining family, Ken disappeared into the yakuza criminal underground and refused to see or speak to his sister. Eiko, cautious to do nothing to offend Ken further, broke off contact with Kilmer. Before returning to the US, Kilmer bought Eiko a bar (with money borrowed from George Tanner) which she operates to this day, named Kilmer House in his honor. Kilmer has never stopped loving her.\nKen's debt to Kilmer, giri, is a lifelong obligation that traditionally can never be repaid. Tanner believes that Ken would therefore do anything for Kilmer, including rescuing Tanner's daughter. Traveling to Tokyo with Tanner's bodyguard Dusty, they stay at the home of another old military buddy named Oliver Wheat. Kilmer visits Eiko at the bar's closing time, seeking to find Ken. Eiko's feelings for Kilmer are clearly as strong as ever. He also becomes reacquainted with Eiko's daughter, Hanako, who is delighted to see Kilmer again. Eiko tells Kilmer that her brother can be found at his kendo school in Kyoto.\nKilmer travels by train to visit Ken at his kendo school. Ken is no longer a yakuza member, but will still help Kilmer. They find and free the girl. In so doing, Ken \"takes up the sword\" once again, attacking one of Tono's men to save Kilmer. This is an inexcusable intrusion by Ken in yakuza affairs. Contracts on both Ken's and Kilmer's lives are issued. Despite Tanner's protests, Kilmer insists on staying until the danger to Ken can be resolved. Eiko suggests he see Ken's brother, a high-level legal counselor to the yakuza chiefs. Goro is unable to intercede due to his impartial role in yakuza society, but suggests Ken can remove the death threat by killing Tono with a sword. The only alternative is for Kilmer to kill Tono himself, by any means (as an outsider, he is not bound to use a sword). Because Kilmer is known to Goro as an unusual gaijin who understands and accepts Japanese values, he proposes that Kilmer now has an obligation to Ken.\nAfter an attempt on Kilmer's life at a bathhouse, he learns that his old friend Tanner has taken out the contract on him. Tanner secretly is broke and owes Tono a huge debt. Dusty discloses that Tanner and Tono are business partners. During a violent attack on Ken and Kilmer in Oliver Wheat's house, Dusty is stabbed to death with a sword and Hanako is shot and killed.\nSeeking advice again from Ken's brother, Goro advises them that they have no choice but to assassinate Tanner and Tono. This will embarrass the partners in the eyes of the yakuza. Goro discloses that he has a \"wayward son\" who has joined Tono's clan and asks that Ken protect him should he be caught in the battle. In private, Goro then discloses the shocking family secret to Kilmer that Eiko is not Ken's sister but his wife, and Hanako their only child. Kilmer comprehends the true meaning of Eiko and Ken's rift, and Ken's anguish at the death of Hanako, all brought about by his repeated intercessions in their lives.\nKilmer storms into Tanner's apartment and kills him, then joins Ken for a near-suicidal attack on Tono's residence.

Bearing the news to his brother, Ken moves to commit Seppuku, but his brother pleads with him not to bring more anguish to their family. Instead, Ken performs yubitsume (the ceremonial yakuza apology by cutting off one's little finger).\nBefore leaving Japan, Kilmer visits with Ken at home and asks to speak to him formally. While Ken prepares tea, Kilmer quietly commits yubitsume, and when Ken enters the room, waits for him to be seated. Sliding the folded handkerchief that contains his finger to Ken, he says \"please accept this token of my apology\" for \"bringing great pain into your life, both in the past and in the present.\" Ken accepts, and Kilmer asks that \"if you can forgive me, then you can forgive Eiko,\" adding, \"you are greatly loved and respected by all your family.\" Ken professes that \"no man has a greater friend than Kilmer-san,\" and Kilmer, overcome by emotion, says the same of Ken.

The Eternals are overseen and protected from death by the Tabernacle, an artificial intelligence. Given their limitless lifespan, the Eternals have grown bored and corrupt, and are descending into madness. The needlessness of procreation has rendered the men impotent and meditation has replaced sleep. Others fall into catatonia, forming the social stratum the Eternals have named the \"Apathetics\".

One of its staff, Professor P. Popper, is a diminutive and bespectacled science teacher who is extremely eccentric. Amid brewing potions and a crowded chalkboard, he is accompanied in his jumbled workspace by a talking bird and an affectionate dog. Popper exhibits forgetful and repetitive behaviours, misremembering names and intermittently singing a ditty about Napoleon. In an elaborate bid to eradicate world hunger, he invents a shrinking powder, which when sprayed on vast food stocks facilitates a size reduction that allows for transportation by a single airplane. An antidote would also be provided, restoring the aid to its original dimensions once deployed. Popper and his pupil prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Simon, accidentally consume the powder in pill-form after it finds its way into their mugs of tea. A wider group of Popper's student assistants\u2014Terry, Angus, Carol, and Peter\u2014mistakenly join the pair in their predicament after searching for them. However, Liz, another of the Professor's tutees, avoids the fate of her classmates and is consequently tasked with helping them in their plight. Initially confined to Popper's chaotic laboratory, the affected group are now two inches tall, each the size of an insect. Their environment is greatly altered as a result; a book is now like a cliff edge, the rotary dial resembles a carousel, pennies are the size of hula hoops and a cat's paw is as large as a Ford Transit.Unconcerned, the Professor is happy to sing to his students about the benefits of their newfound scale. Popper's colleague, Professor Crabbit (dressed in the attire of Sherlock Holmes), meanwhile sets about investigating what has happened to the cohort, arousing the suspicion of local man Rollins. Having misplaced the antidote to his formula, Popper's shrinking powder further becomes a prime target of theft. Covert Russian operatives bent on industrial espionage and a London gang, the latter sporting two crooks sent to miniaturise the Bank of England and sell it to the United States in a suitcase, initiate their pursuits. The danger is eventually supplemented by the Professor's group being chased by an enlarged tarantula, as well as a perilous roller skate ride through the capital. Still, the formula is protected by Popper through this trepidation, and all the villains' plans are ultimately thwarted.
