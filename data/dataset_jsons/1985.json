He appointed Miss Gilby to teach his wife Bimala Piano and English songs. He lives happily with his wife Bimala and his widowed sister-in-law until the appearance of his friend, a revolutionist and a strong supporter of the Swadeshi movement, Sandip (Soumitra Chatterjee). Sandip comes to Sukhsayar to convince Nikhilesh and the villagers to renounce foreign goods in exchange for the Swadeshi ones.\nSandip, a passionate and active man, is a contradiction to the peace-loving and somewhat passive Nikhilesh. Nikhilesh introduces him to his wife Bimala. However, Sandip feels infatuated with Bimala. He insists she meets him daily and decided to stay in Nikhilesh's bungalow. He easily attracts innocent and unsuspecting Bimala. Meanwhile, Miss Gilby is hit by a student who was associated with the Swadeshi movement when she was returning from the Church. Because of this, she decides to leave Sukhsayar. Although Nikhilesh figures out what is happening between Sandip and Bimala through his sister-in-law and close associates, he is mature and grants Bimala the freedom to grow and explore what she wants in life, as their marriage was arranged when she was a girl. Further, Nikhilesh tells Bimala that he would like her to have a life not only inside the home but outside of it as well \u2014 a controversial stance in 1916 when the novel was written. Sandip convinces Bimala to support the Swadeshi movement and urges her to convince Nikhilesh too about the movement who is against the Swadeshi movement because it is not affordable for the poor. According to Nikhilesh, poor people can't afford the movement because foreign goods are cheap and have better quality than the Swadeshi ones and they would suffer if foreign goods are banned. Thus, he doesn't ban foreign goods in Sukhsayar. Although Sandip doesn't concede defeat and starts to make some sinister plan when local poor Muslim tenants also refused to stop buying and selling foreign goods. He creates groups that would often snatch foreign items from the local Muslim traders and bribe the local administrator to sink the boats carrying the foreign goods in Sukhsayar. This results in the growing hatred between Hindus and Muslims. Muslim preachers from other areas started to take benefit of these problems between Hindus and Muslims of Sukhsayar and started to preach hatred to poor Muslim peasants against Hindus.\nSandip demands money from Bimala for the Swadeshi cause. Unsuspecting Bimala gives her the required money but found later that he had demanded more money than required. She also found that he is creating problems in Sukhsayar. Bimala ultimately realizes that it is indeed her husband Nikhilesh who actually loves her rather than Sandip. She regrets her actions in front of Nikhilesh who forgives her. In Sukhsayar, riots broke out between Muslims and Hindus. Nikhilesh decides to go himself and stop the riots between the two groups. Meanwhile, Sandip leaves Sukhsayar by train as soon as he hears about the riots. In the morning, to the horror of Bimala and all the people close to Nikhilesh, Nikhilesh is found dead and Bimala becomes a widow.", "tmdb_plot": "When the movie opens, a woman is recalling the events that molded her perspective on the world.

The rest of the film is told in flashback with occasional narration by Louise to the Professor.\nSeveral months earlier during the spring season, Louise is married to Heinz, a German senior diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Her husband's long work hours make her feel lonely. She decides to take drawing lessons at the institute of Fine Arts. At the institute, Louise meets a classmate named Mitsuko Matsugae, the young and alluring daughter of the Japanese ambassador. Captivated by Mitsuko's beauty, Louise asks her to model for her sketching practice. Rumor soon spreads at the institute that the two women are romantically engaged. Rather than driving them apart, the rumors bring the two friends closer together and soon they are engaged in a passionate love affair. As Louise confides to the Professor, \"One moment we were laughing, the next, we were making love\". They have their romantic encounters first at Louise's house and later at a seedy local hotel. After spending more and more time together, Louise falls in love with Mitsuko.\nHeinz soon grows suspicious of the women's relationship. He not only becomes jealous but also worried that his wife's indiscretions might harm his political ambitions. Heinz confronts Louise about being unfaithful, who denies his allegation, even in the face of clear evidence.\nOne day, Louise discovers that Mitsuko has had an affair with Joseph Benno, their half-Italian drawing instructor. Louise learns about Mitsuko and Joseph's plan to marry and that the two have spread the lesbian rumors about Louise and Mitsuko to distract people from their own socially unacceptable, mixed-race relationship. Disgusted and disillusioned, Louise breaks away from Mitsuko and returns to her husband, confessing the full extent of what has happened. Heinz is upset, but forgives Louise for her infidelity.\nMeanwhile, the Nazi regime starts to eliminate dissidents under the cloak of a morality campaign. Wolf von Hollendorf, Heinz's cousin and a high-ranking Gestapo officer, forces Louise and Heinz to participate in a plot, which uncovers General Werner von Heiden's homosexuality whereby they set a trap for von Heiden at their house by inviting him and (unbeknownst to von Heiden) his lover, a young handsome pianist. At the visit, Wolf exposes von Heiden's relationship, ruining the general's career and forcing him to flee both Berlin and Germany.\nOne month later, Mitsuko reappears in Louise's life, faking being ill and pregnant. Louise does not believe Mitsuko. Nevertheless, they rekindle their affair with even greater intensity. Joseph Benno, who still has a relationship with Mitsuko, promises Louise that he will not interfere with Louise's and Mitsuko's romance if Louise helps he and Mitsuko in getting married. Louise reluctantly agrees and signs a paper stating that. Benno then uses this written agreement to blackmail Heinz who, with Wolf's help, turns the tables on Benno and has him deported back to Italy.\nHeinz is now determined to separate his wife from her Japanese female lover. The two women plan to scare Heinz to accept their relationship by faking an attempted suicide. The plan takes an unexpected turn when Mitsuko seduces Heinz in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois. Caught in a love triangle, Louise, Mitsuko and Heinz grow more and more jealous of each other. Mitsuko, becoming more jealous and possessive, dominates Louise and Heinz. At a dinner, Mitsuko drugs the von Hollendorfs with sleeping pills to prevent them from having sex. Mitsuko uses the ruse to turn Heinz and Louise on each other. By now, their self-destructive relationship becomes publicly known to the Nazi regime as the exiled Benno gets his account published in a Berlin newspaper. To avoid a scandal, Heinz is asked to resign from his post and leave Berlin. Wolf temporarily withdraws their passports to prevent Louise, Heinz and Mitsuko from leaving the country.\nLouise, Heinz and Mitsuko hide out in the seedy hotel room to debate their options. However, rather than leave each other, all three drink poison prepared by Mitsuko in a ceremonial rite of suicide and lay down in the room's bed holding onto each other. Some time later, upon awakening and to her bewilderment, Louise discovers that both Heinz and Mitsuko are dead, revealing that she was given a sedative by Mitsuko instead of poison.\nAt first, Louise thought that by being left behind she was betrayed by both her lovers. However, in the final scene, while finishing her narrative to her Professor, Louise thinks that maybe Mitsuko did so out of loyalty, to spare Louise's life. The Professor urges Louise to write and publish her story, and also passes on his final manuscript to her for safekeeping. Minutes later, he is arrested and taken away by the Gestapo, leaving behind Louise, now alone, who has to decide all by herself how she will go on with her life.", "tmdb_plot": "In 1938 Berlin, Gudrun Landgrebe, wife of Nazi functionary Kevin McNally, begins taking art lessons.

Dallben fears that the Horned King might use his pig, Hen Wen, who has oracular powers, to locate the cauldron. Dallben directs Taran to take Hen Wen to safety; unfortunately, Taran's foolish daydreaming causes Hen Wen to be captured by Gwythaints, the Horned King's dragon-like creatures.\nTaran follows them to the Horned King's castle and meets the pestering dog-like creature, Gurgi, who wants to be his friend. Frustrated by Gurgi's antics and cowardice, Taran leaves him. Taran sneaks into the castle and helps Hen Wen escape but is captured and thrown into the dungeon. Another captive named Princess Eilonwy frees him as she tries to escape. In the catacombs underneath the castle, Taran and Eilonwy discover the ancient burial chamber of a king. Taran arms himself with the king's sword which contains magic that allows him to effectively fight the Horned King's minions, thus fulfilling his dream. Along with a third prisoner, the comical middle-aged bard Fflewddur Fflam, they escape from the castle and are found by Gurgi. Upon learning that Taran has escaped, the Horned King orders his goblin and chief henchman, Creeper, to send the Gwythaints to follow and capture Taran along with his friends.\nFollowing Hen Wen's trail, the four companions stumble into the underground kingdom of the Fair Folk who have Hen Wen under their protection. When the kindly King Eidilleg reveals the cauldron's location, Taran decides to destroy it. Eilonwy, Gurgi and Fflewddur agree to join him and Eidilleg's obnoxious right-hand man Doli is assigned to lead them to the Marshes of Morva while the Fair Folk escort Hen Wen back to Caer Dallben. At Morva, they learn the cauldron is held by three witches\u2014the crafty leader Orddu, the greedy Orgoch, and the more benevolent Orwen (who falls in love with Fflewddur at first sight). Orddu agrees to trade the cauldron for Taran's sword and he reluctantly agrees, knowing that it will cost his chance for heroism. Before vanishing, the witches reveal the cauldron is indestructible, and its power can only be broken when someone willingly climbs into it, which will kill them. Doli angrily abandons the group. Although Taran feels foolish for trading the sword for nothing, his companions show their belief in him. Eilonwy and Taran almost kiss as Fflewddur and Gurgi happily watch. Suddenly they are found by the Horned King's minions who had followed them. Gurgi runs away before they take the cauldron and the three companions back to the castle. The Horned King uses the cauldron to raise the dead and his Cauldron-born army begins to pour out into the world while holding the trio prisoners in view of the cauldron.\nGurgi, deciding not to abandon his friends this time, sneaks into the castle and rescues them. Taran decides to jump into the cauldron to save everyone, but Gurgi stops him and jumps in instead, killing the Cauldron-born as well as himself. When the Horned King spots Taran, he blames him, saying that Taran has interfered for the last time, and throws the youth toward the cauldron. But the cauldron is out of control and consumes the Horned King in a tunnel of fire, killing him and destroying the castle, using up all its powers forever, as the companions escape.\nThe three witches come to recover the now-inert Black Cauldron. Taran has finally realized Gurgi's true friendship while hailing him as a hero, and asks them to revive his friend in exchange for the cauldron, choosing to give up his magical sword permanently.

Her husband, Ed Vincent, is missing and is believed to be the killer. Veteran homicide detective Joe Steiner is assigned to the case, but with Vincent missing, the case goes  cold. A few days later in California, two men are involved in a fiery wreck that kills one and leaves the other disfigured. It's discovered that one of them is Allen Devlin. Police at first aren't sure which of the two he is as the deceased's corpse was burned, neither had identification, and the survivor has amnesia. The other man is suspected to have been a hitchhiker. Based on witness accounts, they determine the survivor is Allen. \nOver the next year, Allen receives multiple  facial reconstructive surgeries and attempts to remember his past with the help of Chris Graham, a nurse who treated him. They fall in love. Six years later, the two are happily married with children. Allen is a successful realtor and Chris is a  stay-at-home mother. Steiner, having been forced into early retirement, still pursues clues in the Vincent murders. His old colleague, Phil Murphy, informs him that their precinct has received a tip for the murders in the form of a newspaper article featuring the Devlins. The tipster suggests Allen bears a strong resemblance to Ed Vincent. \nSteiner travels to California to investigate. He encounters Allen and confesses his suspicions that Allen may be Ed Vincent. Police Chief Michael Patterson, Chris's old lover, urges Steiner to drop the investigation. Steiner admits that he believes Allen sent the newspaper article and has a split personality. Vincent is part of his subconsciousness that wants to be caught out of fear of killing again. \nAllen hires a private investigator, John Davey, to confirm Steiner's accusation. Davey tracks down Theo Grant, who lent the vehicle that Allen and the hitchhiker were using at the time of the crash. Allen asks if he bears a resemblance to Vincent but Grant refuses to talk without compensation. That night while Allen is at work, Chris receives a call from a man with a distorted voice calling her Lisa and accusing her of having an affair. \nLater, a woman is attacked in a park by a man wearing a leather mask. Steiner deduces that this attack is related to similar ones that happened in Ohio that suddenly stopped when the Vincent murders occurred. He suspects that Vincent was responsible for these attacks that eventually culminated in him murdering his family after he discovered Lisa was having an affair. That night, Davey is found murdered, and Patterson, believing Steiner may be right, calls for a search of the Devlin home. Nothing is found. Not long after, another attack is reported and Chris receives another disturbing phone call. In a panic to get her children out of the house, she discovers a black leather mask. She confronts Allen who claims innocence but, under the advice of his lawyer, admits himself into a psychiatric hospital. \nSteiner and Patterson discuss the case at the latter's home where Steiner discovers a mural of photographs of Chris. Patterson admits that he is still in love with her and was the one who sent the newspaper article but denies making the calls to Chris. Steiner assumes that the entire Devlin case was a sham, an attempt by Patterson to falsely accuse Allen of the Vincent murders to destroy his marriage so Patterson could pursue Chris. His theory is seemingly confirmed when a rapist wearing a leather mask is caught. He later visits Chris and Allen, telling them both to be wary of Patterson. Allen is released from the hospital and the case against him is dropped. \nThat night, Patterson confronts Chris and warns her about her husband and denies being responsible for the calls. While preparing a birthday party for their son, Chris is attacked by an assailant in a leather mask.

She manages to hide in her vehicle when he wakes and finds Patterson\u2019s dead body inside.

At Henry's house, Jonathan catches a glimpse of some blueprints labeled, \"Time Traveler Project\" and the outline of a skeleton key used as an ignition key. Henry briefly explains the blueprint was something Jonathan's grandfather invented but never got a chance to build. Henry proceeds to gift Jonathan an unpainted toy model of a biplane, similar in style to the type his grandfather use to fly in the 1920s. That evening, while Jonathan is having dinner at his home, his father explains that his grandfather was a idealistic dreamer who died in a crazy exploit, and that Henry makes him out to be something more than he was.\nOne day, Jonathan is visiting Henry in his basement decorated with old pictures. Henry explains that a solo transatlantic flight was among the most daring challenges in his day, and that the person to first successfully fly solo across the Atlantic was Charles Lindbergh. Jonathan's grandfather had attempted the feat four days before Lindbergh but had perished during the trip. His grandfather had taken a northern route against his own instincts, which Henry believed is what likely led to the fatal outcome of the trip. Henry makes a vow that he will get the world to remember the name Max Knickerbocker despite the failed transatlantic flight attempt.\nSometime later, Jonathan comes to visit Henry but discovers that Henry had a heart attack and is bedridden. Henry explains to Jonathan that he built the time machine that Max once conceived on blueprints. At exactly 7:30 a.m. the following day a \"window in time\" would open that would allow the machine to function and take an occupant into the past to save Max. Henry also explains that this \"window in time\" would only be open temporarily, and the traveler would need to return to the future before it closes or they would vanish forever. Given Henry's medical condition, he is no longer able to make the trip, and discourages Jonathan from attempting the trip, saying the machine is untested and the trip would be too risky.\nJonathan wakes up the early the next day and goes through a window in Max's house to activate the time machine using a skeleton key he found hanging nearby. When a countdown timer hits zero, the machine activates with various gears and sounds and spins rapidly taking him to May 14, 1927. When he emerges, he walks into downtown while 1927-era people stare at him with his anachronistic 1985 clothing. Jonathan buys a few candy bars and a newspaper with a dollar bill from the future, but leaves before the vendor notices. The vendor flags the local police captain claiming he was passed a counterfeit bill.\nWith vague directions of where his grandfather might be, Jonathan travels a few miles out of town and sleeps in a barn. He awakens to the crashing sound of a gyroplane that his grandfather Max was testing and subsequently crashed into the barn. Jonathan discovers his grandfather is an eccentric inventor, but a kind man who takes in Jonathan believing he's a runaway.\nMeanwhile, a bootlegger named Finch and a corrupt police captain find the time machine in Finch's house (which would become Henry's house in the future). They make the connection to a strange boy who arrived in downtown with a futuristic counterfeit bill. Finch wants to find the boy to get the key to the time machine to exploit it for gambling and financial gain.\nJonathan connects with his grandfather over breakfast and meets his grandmother who is currently pregnant with a child that will become his father. Max shows Jonathan several of his inventions, including blueprints for the Time Traveler machine. He also shows Jonathan his biplane, which he calls The Blue Yonder, that he intends to fly across the Atlantic. Max takes Jonathan on a flight in which he performs several barrel rolls and flies inverted. He also allows Jonathan to take the stick and fly.\nLater that evening, Jonathan tries to convince Max not to go on his transatlantic flight. When he fails, he tells Max that he is his grandson from the future. When Max doesn't believe him, he attempts to take Max to show him the time machine, but they discover it's missing because Finch moved it to a different room. Max is skeptical of Jonathan's story, so in a last ditch effort, Jonathan tells Max the story about how an American Legion plane will crash the following morning in a nearby pond and will kill both pilots. When this even occurs as he described, Max realizes the probably of guessing such an outcome is far too remote and now believes he's from the future. While viewing the crash scene, Jonathan is spotted by Finch and the police officer, and they arrest him, but not before Jonathan secretly puts the key for the time machine into Max's pocket.\nLater that evening, Max breaks Jonathan out of jail and takes him home. In the middle of the night Max decides to take an alternate route on his transatlantic flight. The next morning, Jonathan wakes up and finds a note from Max saying he's going to attempt the flight and wishes him off. Jonathan races to the airfield to stop Max but is too late. Finch and the police officer are there, and begin to chase Jonathan who heads back toward the time machine. With only seconds to spare, Jonathan activates the time machine and disappears with Finch and the police captain barely missing him. A group of police officials file into the room discovering bootlegged liquor stash, and begin to arrest Finch and the corrupt police captain.\nJonathan emerges back in 1985 saddened that he failed his mission to save his grandfather. While walking near some baseball fields, a baseball lands near an aviation memorial statue and the kids ask if Jonathan can throw the ball back. As he's picking it up, he notices the plaque has changes from before his trip. It now credits Max Knickerbocker for making the \"nearest successful Atlantic crossing before Lindbergh\" and that The Blue Yonder plane was found off the French coast, indicating that while Max still died, he had successfully traversed the Atlantic before Lindbergh.

His colleague Jacob is the Field Supervisor and a work addict. The two men are poles apart in their characters. Jacob is a down-to-earth and rather commonplace sort of person, whose social pride does not conflict with his easy-going attitude to morality. Shankaran, on the other hand, is a mild-mannered loner. He has an easy, friendly relationship with the workers. Muniyandi, a worker in the farm, is a timid god-fearing man. His job is to look after the cattle. One day he confesses to Shankaran that he is going to his village to get married. When he asks Jacob for leave, Jacob brusquely tells him that he must be back immediately after the wedding. But Shankaran invites him to have a drink with him in his room. Hoping that God will not notice this minor aberration. Muniyandi says a quick prayer before taking a few swigs of rum equally quickly. Then he settles down on the floor and starts singing in the praise of the Lord. The embarrassed Shankaran has to help him to his quarters.\nShankaran who is an amateur photographer, goes to attend Muniyandi's marriage in a Tamil village. On the way he focuses his camera on the clay horses standing in a row, neglected in the village green. At the wedding he photographs the bride and the groom. Soon after the wedding, Muniyandi brings his wife, Shivkami from the brown, barren landscape of Tamil Nadu to the green, undulating meadows of the farm. Shankaran watches them from his office window, as they walk towards their quarters, Shivkami stopping on the way to wonder at the colourful surroundings.\nShivkami reacts at first like a frightened deer to every new sound, every new scene. The massive, well fed cows, the sound of the motorbike, a new face, everything makes her withdraw into herself. It takes time, but slowly and timidly, she starts taking her first sure steps on this new lovely world. She walks around aimlessly when Muniyandi is away at work and wanders into the gardens, touching each flower with supreme wonder. While Muniyandi offers her a timid adoration, Shankaran approaches her with gentle concern. She is no longer afraid of him. She goes to him when an address has to be written on a letter she writes home, and does not shy away from his camera. For Shankaran, she is something gentle and beautiful, like the lush green landscape of the farm.\nOne day a car stops on the road below Shankaran's house. Two younger colleagues bring a couple of minor film stars with them to meet Shankaran. They are on their way to a function where the actors will be their guests. Out of the sprawling lawns, Shankaran and his visitors sit down for a casual drink. On the road below, Jacob appears and is hailed by Shankaran. He comes and joins them, and the conversation turns to the newcomer in the farm, the lovely Shivkami. Jacob teases Shankaran about his interest in her. And suddenly Shankaran is furiously angry and physically assaults Jacob, and they all leave him, embarrassed and upset. In the gathering darkness, Shankaran lies on the grass, pondering on his strange reaction to a casual joke. What does he want from Shivkami?\nMeanwhile, Jacob has been trying to arrange a job for Shivkami on the farm. Muniyandi is not happy about it at all. But Shivkami herself, now bored with her lonely life, would not mind working on the farm. Seeing Muniyandi with the cattle, Jacob stops by to tell him that he has found some work for Muniyandi's wife. Muniyandi, who is suspicious about Jacob's intentions, politely refuses the job. Jacob, who would not normally associate with what he calls \"menials\", is angry, and orders Muniyandi to start doing night duty from now on.\nAt night, in the cattle shed, Muniyandi listens to every sound. A motorbike rushes past, and he is instantly alert. Is that Jacob going to his Shivkami? He comes out of the shed and goes running all way home. His house is quiet and dark. But Muniyandi, in a frantic fear, bangs his fist on the door. And a figure goes past swiftly from the back of the house and disappears into the darkness. It was not Jacob, but Shankaran, the man Muniyandi had trusted.\nEarly next morning a crowd gathers outside the cattle shed. Through the half open shutters of the windows placed high on the wall, the workers of the farm peer into the inner gloom, where in a shaft of light, the dark, portly figure of Muniyandi hangs from the wooden beam. His lifeless body sways gently to and fro, the beam making a creaking noise. Shankaran lifts one of the shutters from outside and Muniyandi's dead face confronts him with his own shame.\nShankaran runs away. He runs through the forest, pursued by the devil within, till the night gathers, and he falls down exhausted on the cushioned floor of the forest. At night, his two younger colleagues are making ready for bed in their quarters, when there is a frantic knock on the door. It is Shankaran, come back for penance.

His friends find him a job in a printing press in the city, where he sits dreaming over the proof sheets. But his life has stopped with Muniyandi. The swinging body and the creaking beam have kept him company ever since. The doctor he visits once in a while, never stops talking of religion. \"Read the Gita\", he says. But the devil within will not be subdued. \"Take a holiday\", says the doctor. \"Go to a religious place, you'll find peace of mind\".\nShankaran goes wandering again.

Coming out of the inner precincts of the temple, Shankaran stops to wear his shoes and pay the woman who sits looking after them at the entrance. She is a poor creature, huddled in a dark corner.

With the help of Jack, Ben, Arthur and Joe, the Antareans return the cocoons to the sea. The Antareans offer to take residents of the retirement home with them to Antarea, where they will never grow older and never die. Most of them accept the offer, but Bernie chooses to remain on Earth.\nUpon leaving, Ben tells his grandson David that he and Mary are leaving for good. As the residents are leaving, David's mother Susan finds out about their destination and drives to the retirement home, where they find the majority of the rooms vacant and contact local authorities.\nWhile the police are searching for the residents, David notices Jack's boat, with the Antareans and the retirement residents aboard, starting and jumps onto the side as it pulls away. The boat is chased by the Coast Guard, so with little time left, David says goodbye to Ben and Mary before jumping into the water. The Coast Guard boats stop to pick him up, giving the others a chance to get away. A thick fog appears and strands the remaining Coast Guard boats, and they call off the chase.\nAs the Antarean ship appears, Walter pays Jack for his services and the boat. Jack embraces Kitty for the last time and they share a kiss. He then says farewell to everyone before jumping into an inflatable raft as the boat rises up into the Antarean vessel. Jack watches as the boat disappears inside the ship and departs.\nBack on earth, a funeral is held for the missing residents.

Nazi Germany knows the Allies will launch Operation Overlord - an all-out invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe via France. To learn the actual date of D-Day and landing sites in advance, a cordial but uneasy partnership has been created between the German army (Col. Brausch (Max von Sydow)), the Gestapo (Hoffman (Horst Buchholz)) and the S.S. (Ritter (Helmut Berger)), with Hoffman in charge. Six times so far they've failed to capture an \"Overlord\" i.e. someone who knows the information they want, and the pressure is on. Brausch tells Hoffman they have an agent working in British Intelligence, codenamed Emerald (Gus Lang (Ed Harris)), whom they then task with delivering to them an \"Overlord\". But Lang/Emerald is really a double-agent who is working for the Allies. Patrick Callaghan, who is motivated by money, is Lang's contact with Brausch. Lang passes on fake details of a D-Day rehearsal including a ship carrying Overlorders, and suggests that a German E-boat squadron (heavily armed fast attack boats) should intercept them. Because Lang has invented the information, the E-boats will miss the ship but Lang would still appear to have fulfilled his mission. However, Lang's superior, Col. Peters (Patrick Stewart), says they will send a real ship, manned by unknowing sacrifices and certainly no Overlorders. Allied military command decides to hold a real D-Day rehearsal, for Omaha Beach, which naturally would include many Overlords. Peters refuses to inform the military of his intelligence scheme, telling Lang that there's a high-level Nazi secretly working for the Allies (due to disaffection with Nazi ideology) whose identity must be protected at all costs. This means that the exercise is attacked by the German E-boats and many Overlorders are killed in action. Several soldiers are captured by the Germans, including Lt. Andy Wheeler (Eric Stoltz), a U.S. army signalman whose job means he has intimate knowledge of the D-Day landings including the date and targets.\nWheeler is taken for interrogation to an old castle in Paris which is the Gestapo H.Q. Wheeler refuses to reveal any information to Ritter, not even his name and rank; Ritter has only found out his prisoner's name and rank by interrogating the other captured prisoners, and deduced from his signalman's job that the Nazis have captured an Overlord at last. Brausch, Hoffman, Ritter decide to include Lang/Emerald closely in their team because Lang, having grown up in the USA, can befriend Wheeler and get him to talk. They also know that the British would like Lang involved, believing him to be their own agent. Thus the Germans feel they have the upper hand and merely wait for Lang to arrive in France. Before leaving England, Lang is instructed that if Wheeler has talked he must report it at once and Operation Overlord would be delayed, and it would take months before it could be mounted again. Lang is also ordered that, if Wheeler hasn't yet talked, he may need to kill Wheeler to prevent him from talking. To keep Wheeler from being tortured, British Intelligence tells Lang they have contrived to add a false medical condition into Wheeler's army medical record. This medical condition (cardiac arrhythmia) can't be easily diagnosed. Lang \"procures\" Wheeler's medical record for the Nazis who do not torture Wheeler.\nLang parachutes into France where fishmonger Henri, a member of the French Resistance, meets him cycling to Paris. Henri drives him to Paris in his fish van and instructs him how to make contact with someone who will act as a go-between for him (Lang) and the radio operator who will secretly relay his reports to England. In Paris, Lang reports to Ritter. Ritter is fanatical about the racial inferiority of the Jews, and Lang avoids possibly awkward questioning on the matter by the arrival of Brausch and Hoffman. Ritter, Lang, Hoffman and Brausch agree on the interrogation method - Wheeler has been undergoing disorientation to soften him up for later, via enforced sleep deprivation, irregular meals and frequently being moved between different cells. Sometimes his cell has been occupied by another prisoner (a stool pigeon), sometimes he's in solitary confinement. Now they will introduce Lang as a fellow-American prisoner who must befriend Wheeler and persuade him to talk. In partly social, partly work conversation, it's suggested to Lang that he could acquire a girlfriend during his stay as he'll be working on Wheeler for only a few hours a day to begin with.\nLang evades his Gestapo tail in order to secretly meet Claire Jouvet (Cyrielle Clair) in a Paris Metro train carriage. For security, Lang will deal only with Claire, while Claire will pass on his reports to her Belgian friend who works for the Resistance and who has a secret radio hidden near the altar of a local church. Lang and Claire, knowing that Gestapo agents are following Lang all the time, pretend to be lovers although it develops into real romance. One night he stays overnight at Claire's apartment and they have sex for the first time, but are interrupted during the night by a disturbance downstairs - one of her neighbours, an elderly woman, is being arrested by the Germans as part of their tit-for-tat policy (20 people for 1 German). Claire protests but the German officer, to whom Lang has identified himself, apologises for disturbing them but warns that if they interfere he would have to report the matter. Lang drags a still-protesting Claire back to her apartment. The first time that Lang appears in Wheeler's cell, he starts befriending Wheeler by guessing that he's a Texan (yes, Wheeler says, adding that he's from Lubbock), and Wheeler soon introduces himself by name, and they converse about baseball - it looks as if Lang will be successful in obtaining the D-Day date, given time, and Brausch, Hoffman and Ritter celebrate.\nLang and Claire socialise with Brausch, Hoffman and Ritter and Ritter's lady-friend at a restaurant, and a photograph is taken of the group. Ritter, who is naturally suspicious, looks into the background of Claire Jouvet. She had told Lang that she has a son, a child by an absent father named Duchelle. Now Ritter arrests and questions Duchelle who reveals the friendship Claire has with a Belgian girl. Ritter orders a subordinate to obtain all the information Duchelle knows about Claire and then kill him. Ritter thus learns about Claire's connection with the Resistance and, as important for the Jew-hater, that an ancestor of Claire's 60 years ago had Jewish blood - Hoffman confides Ritter's actions to Brausch, saying that although not registering the Jewish blood is a capital offence, it is trivial.\nMeanwhile, Lang gets Wheeler to reveal the D-Day landings will be at Calais (the decoy location being used by the Allies in Operation Quicksilver (deception plan)), but tells Brausch, Hoffman and Ritter that while Wheeler trusts him (Lang) he may have lied in case he was being overheard. Lang suggests some truly private time with Wheeler; everyone but Ritter thinks it is a good idea. Accordingly Lang and Wheeler are let into the open grounds of the castle for an hour's exercise. There Lang tells Wheeler he's a double agent, and allays Wheeler's fears by telling him what only an Overlorder would know - that D-Day will target Normandy (not Calais). Lang then gives Wheeler detailed instructions as to what information to reveal e.g. that the assault will be led by FUSAG in early July (actual D-Day was planned for 5 June; on 5 June it would be delayed to 6 June) [FUSAG was a non-existent and decoy U.S. army battalion based in Scotland]). Especially after Wheeler tells Lang that the thought of his girlfriend is all that keeps him going, Lang (no doubt thinking of his own girlfriend, Claire) determines to rescue Wheeler, ruling out killing him as per the in extremis order given him by Col. Peters and his superior Sir Geoffrey Macklin.\nHoffman's and Ritter's suspicions of Lang are increasing, however. Hoffman has a meeting with Callaghan, who has secretly started working for the Gestapo, because they pay better than Brausch. Callaghan tells Hoffman that Wheeler doesn't have a heart condition - the British altered Wheeler's army record but failed to change his ordinary medical record. Ritter shows Wheeler the photograph taken at the restaurant, and Wheeler recognises his buddy prisoner Lang in it. Ritter tells Wheeler he knows the American army faked his medical record and leaves him to contemplate the torture he can now expect. But Lang suddenly discovers a new ally - he secretly meets Brausch in a church and Brausch reveals that they have a mutual friend in Macklin i.e. Brausch is British Intelligence's high-ranking Nazi (mentioned but not named by Peters to Lang earlier). Brausch reveals what Hoffman had confided to him as to Gestapo suspicions of Claire and Lang, and that Callaghan was seen conversing with Hoffman. Brausch says that Hoffman will do something but will act alone as he never trusts anyone as it means no one can betray him, but it also means no one can help him either.\nHoffman, Lang and Claire go on a country picnic. Claire is painting a picture of the natural scene, while the chauffeur waits with the car that brought them. Hoffman invites Lang for a private walk and talk. Hoffman draws a gun and tells Lang that his cover is blown. Suddenly a shot rings out...and Hoffman falls dead - Claire has shot him. The surprised chauffeur starts to draw his weapon but he is felled too. Claire gets into the car and, after an emotional adieu to Lang, is driven by Henri to collect her son and then to an airfield, there to await Lang at 5pm and, hopefully, Wheeler once rescued. Later, at Gestapo H.Q., Lang, dressed in his Gestapo senior officer's uniform and acting very peremptory and very Nazi, hands Brausch a document which bears the signature of Hoffman. Actually it's a clever forgery by Claire who had practised earlier during one of the nights that Lang spent with her. Brausch, ordered by Lang to read the document to all the officers present, says that Hoffman is at Calais, removes Ritter's authority and puts Lang in charge with the task of bringing Wheeler to Calais at once. As soldiers bring in Wheeler, Ritter arrives having been alerted by one of the officers who had slipped out to warn him. Ritter and Lang exchange words and Lang asserts his authority by hitting him and flooring him. As he lies there and blood trickles from a cut on his mouth, Ritter sees Wheeler escorted away by Lang and Brausch. A suspicious officer rushes to a telephone, seeking personal confirmation from Hoffman of his orders. There is a delay (if nothing else, of course, Hoffman is not at Calais as he is dead), and the officer can only watch as Lang and Brausch slowly walk the exhausted Wheeler to the staff car. Once Wheeler is in the car, Lang tells Brausch to come with them but Brausch says he can buy them some time. Lang knows the Germans will figure out the plot, so Brausch's life is in danger, but Brausch says he is not important. Lang drives Wheeler out of Gestapo H.Q. just as the alarm is sounded. A chase ensues. Lang stops the car out in the countryside, and Henri appears with his fish van, and all three of them rush to the airfield. The Germans catch up with the staff car and start searching. At the airfield, the pilot of the rescue plane urges Claire to give up and leave as the rendezvous deadline looms. Claire and her young son get into the plane. At the last moment the fish van arrives and everyone gets onto the plane which takes off. Once in the air and heading for England, and having put paid to the pursuit, Lang and Claire kiss each other passionately, making Wheeler smile, no doubt thinking of his own girlfriend whom he'll soon see.

An undercover informant is about to meet a buyer at an \"L\" train stop. Cusack and his partner Dorato (Dennis Farina) use a garbage truck to patrol beneath the train tracks.\nThe carefully orchestrated sting is a basic meet-and-greet exchange set up by cocaine supplier Victor Comacho (Ron Henriquez). Victor is the younger brother of Luis Comacho (Henry Silva), leader of a vicious drug gang known as the Comachos. Everything goes horribly wrong when a rival gang led by mafia drug lord Tony Luna (Mike Genovese) infiltrates the sting as a crew of painters and mercilessly guns down the attendees. After money and cocaine are exchanged, the aftermath is grim; Cusack's informant is dead and Dorato is wounded. Kopalas is also eyewitness as Cragie accidentally guns down a teenager, then plants his backup weapon on the victim.\nKopalas is partnered with Cusack, with Cragie put on desk duty until a department hearing. Commander Kates (Bert Remsen) expresses disgust with the outcome of the sting, while Cusack notes that the Comachos will not take the hit on their gang lightly. Kates agrees. He releases Eddie with one warning: \"Find who burned the Comachos before they do.\"\nAfter learning that one of his gang members was shot by police, and that Victor Comacho survived, Tony Luna decides to leave town. He asks Lou Gamiani (Lou Damiani) to have someone guard his daughter, Diana Luna (Molly Hagan), a young artist. Gamiani feels he has put the entire outfit at risk.\nApart from breaking in a new partner, and the introduction of the new Prowler police three-axle robot, Cusack is shunned by other officers for his refusal to sign a petition to have Cragie cleared. He bluntly tells Brennan: \"If Cragie doesn't get off the streets, he's gonna kill somebody else, or get somebody killed.\"\nTailing Gamiani to the Lincoln Park Zoo, the detectives witness a tense exchange between him and Diana. Cusack discovers who Diana's father is. He and Kopalas stake out the Luna residence as the Comacho funeral procession comes through the neighborhood. They visit Tony Luna's uncle, Felix Scalese (Nathan Davis), to request he stop the imminent conflict.\nResponding to a DOA call in Lincoln Park, Brennan and Music identify the victim, who had been given a \"Colombian necktie\", as Tony Luna's bag man. Brennan notes another call to Luna's restaurant, where the officers found the mutilated owner hanging from a meat hook. A car lot run by Tony Luna is firebombed and the owner burned alive. A vicious gang war has begun.\nPosing as food vendors, the Comachos brutally gun down every member of the Luna household. Cusack, knowing they will go after Diana to bring Luna out of hiding, tries to get to her first. Gamiani is stabbed to death. Cusack and Kopalas arrive on the scene. Cusack takes off after Diana, who is being chased by several Comacho gang members. In an alley. Cusack surprises them at gunpoint. One takes Diana hostage with a knife, but Cusack disarms the three remaining suspects and goes after the one with the girl. He follows them to the Randolph/Wells (CTA) elevated station and boards a train. A standoff ensues, leading to a fight on the roof of the eight-car train. At a bridge crossing, the gang member jumps into the Chicago River, where he is run over by a speedboat.\nCusack then places Diana in a safe house with his old friend Pirelli (Allen Hamilton), a retired Chicago police officer who was the partner of Cusack's father. At a hearing, Kopalas decides to back Cragie's story. Cusack testifies truthfully that he cannot comment on the incident in question because he arrived after the fact. However, it is revealed that Cusack once submitted a transfer order to have Cragie moved out of his unit. Other officers resent Cusack for breaking the unwritten \"code of silence\" which says officers should never report the errors or misconduct of their colleagues. Only former partner Detective Dorato remains loyal to Cusack.\nPirelli ends up dead and Diana missing. Cusack races toward the Comacho hangout and puts out a radio call for backup, but due to the hearing, other officers refuse to respond. He fights off Luis and other Comacho gang members by himself. Luis tells Cusack he wants Tony Luna, otherwise Diana dies, painfully and slowly.\nDorato tips off Cusack that Tony Luna was lying low in Wisconsin, returning to Chicago that night by train. Cusack waits outside the station, watching as Luna climbs into Scalese's limousine. Scalese chastises his nephew for igniting a gang war. The driver notices Cusack following and a wild chase ensues. The limo strikes a stalled car and overturns onto its roof, with Luna and Scalese killed in the explosion.

Redl is never to forget that he owes his promising career to the Emperor.\nAt the military academy, the young Redl soon stands out for his talent, drive and loyalty to the Crown. One of his teachers forces him to inform on Kristof Kubinyi, a student who is the subject of a practical joke; whilst he blames himself for incriminating his comrade, Alfred soon realises that to rise in the ranks he must overcome his peasant background by ingratiating himself with his superiors. Alfred and Kristof become firm friends. Kubinyi  invites Redl home for the holidays to the elegant residence of his parents, who lead a life of privilege and nobility in Hungary. There, Alfred meets Kristof's pretty sister, Katalin, who welcomes him warmly. To Kubinyi's aristocratic parents, Redl hides his true humble background, pretending to be of Hungarian ancestry and a member from an old family who lost all its fortune.\nRedl and Kubinyi slowly climb the ladder as career officers. Once they become adults, the two friends have different political ideals. As a Hungarian, Kubinyi slowly falls prey to the national aspirations of a Hungary free from Habsburg rule, while Redl remains fiercely patriotic and faithful to his benefactor, the Austrian Emperor.  For Redl, his relationship with Kubinyi goes beyond friendship as Redl harbors an unrequited love for his comrade. When the two young men visit a brothel, Redl seems more interested in watching his friend having sex than in engaging a woman in his own room. Redl suppresses his attraction to Kristof, however, and transfers it, as best as he can, to Katalin, his friend's beautiful sister. Back at the academy, Alfred serves as a second in a duel between Kristof and another classmate, who is killed in the contest. This foolishness jeopardizes the careers of both Kubinyi and Redl, but the commanding officer, Colonel von Roden, having noted Redl's hard work and loyalty to the Emperor, arranges a promotion for him and a prized assignment in Vienna.

The discipline there is lax and Redl readily stands out as a serious-minded young officer. When the district commander decides to retire, Redl is recommended for the job. As commanding officer, he proves very demanding, working hard to reinvigorate the discipline of his outfit. This does not sit well with the junior officers, including Kristof, especially because they feel superior to Redl by birth. When Redl and Kristof have a falling out over Kristof's sloppy habits and poor performance, Kristof mocks Redl's lowly origins in conversation with other officers.\nColonel von Roden intervenes on Redl's behalf again, bringing him back to Vienna to serve as deputy chief of the counter-espionage branch of the Evidenzbureau. It's a nasty kind of job, since it entails spying on officers throughout the service, trying to identify those engaging in espionage activities for the Russians. On Katalin's suggestion, Redl undertakes a loveless marriage of convenience in order to quell rumors of his homosexual proclivities. His wife, Clarissa, suffers from ill health and remains a distant figure in his life.\nRedl's single-minded devotion to duty draws him into the orbit of the heir to the crown, Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who is a ruthless schemer (whose ultimate objective is portrayed as to overthrow the Emperor in a coup d'\u00e9tat).

At Turtle's house, Daryl notices Turtle playing Pole Position, and decides to try it out, playing and reacting faster than humanly possible.\nAndy decides to teach Daryl how to improve his social skills by teaching him how to play baseball, to which Daryl shows uncanny abilities, including hitting multiple home runs; one of them shatters a window. When Andy shows Daryl how to use an ATM, Daryl helps Andy to rectify a problem when it won't accept his credit card. Daryl then makes a transaction with the ATM, which results in Daryl withdrawing $100 from Andy's account, but then manipulates the ATM to show $1,426,372 in the account.\nThe baseball game starts with Andy's team, the Mohawks, facing the Warriors, coached by Andy's rival, Bull MacKenzie (Hardy Rawls). Daryl shows off his impressive ability, and the Mohawks start winning the game, but Turtle \u2014 who had noticed that Joyce is slightly annoyed that she cannot do anything for Daryl, because Daryl can look after himself perfectly \u2014 tells him that it is all right for him to not always be perfect and to mess up sometimes; Daryl ends up striking out his next turn, so Turtle ends up taking over for Daryl as the cleanup hitter. Turtle manages to hit a home run, winning the game for the team, and everyone is joyous over the Mohawks' victory.\nHowever, just as the Richardsons have truly begun to form a bond with Daryl, their new-found happiness is shattered when government agents find him and return him to the TASCOM facility in Washington, D.C. where he was created. Once there, his memory is restored and he is debriefed on the lessons he learned during his time with the Richardsons. Notable items in the debriefing include his decision to strike out at a baseball game, because sub-optimal performance in some areas can be more beneficial when building relationships with others, as well as his subjective preference for chocolate-flavored ice cream over vanilla-flavored ice cream. Because Daryl has revealed a capacity for human emotions, including fear, the D.A.R.Y.L. experiment is considered a failure by the military and the decision is made that the project be \"terminated\".\nDr. Jeffrey Stewart (Josef Sommer), one of Daryl's designers, decides to free Daryl so he can return to the Richardson family. Unfortunately, despite the cooperation of Dr. Ellen Lamb (Kathryn Walker) \u2014 who was originally skeptical about Daryl's humanity and had alerted the military to Daryl's continued existence \u2014 they do not get away cleanly. When asked by the military to justify her complicity, Dr. Lamb offers a reformulation of the Turing test: \"General, a machine becomes human ... when you can't tell the difference anymore,\" implying that she is no longer certain that Daryl is not human.\nDaryl and Dr. Stewart manage to escape the first wave of pursuers, thanks to Daryl's advanced driving skills, apparently acquired through playing the Pole Position video game. As the sun comes up, they drive into the Northern Virginia countryside and steal a pickup truck to avoid being recognized. However, when passing two police roadblocks, Dr. Stewart is mortally wounded by a police officer's shotgun. With his dying words, he assures Daryl that he is indeed a real person and Daryl continues his escape.\n\nThat night, Daryl sneaks into a nearby USAF airbase, hacks into a computer to trigger several faraway alarms as a distraction, and steals a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird. Daryl sets a course for Barkenton, and contacts Turtle telling him and Sherie to meet up with him at Blue Lake, a lake where he and Turtle had been before.\nBecause their missiles cannot intercept the plane, the Air Force tells Daryl that the plane will be vaporized mid-flight using a self-destruct mechanism. Daryl ejects at the last moment to fake his own death, as the plane is blown apart over Barkenton. In the meantime, Turtle and Sherie bike to the lake to meet up with Daryl. Unfortunately, the ejection had knocked Daryl unconscious, and he plummets into Blue Lake in his ejection seat with a deployed parachute. The added weight of both the seat and the parachute causes him to sink and Daryl drowns. When his body resurfaces, Daryl is rushed to the hospital, but shows no signs of life and is officially declared dead.\nEveryone is depressed over Daryl's death, even though Turtle says that since he is a computer, he can't die. In the hospital, Dr. Lamb finds him and reactivates his electronic brain, restoring him to life. Now that he is declared dead, Daryl is no longer on the run from TASCOM and is free to return to his foster family. As Turtle walks out of the Richardsons' house, he sees Daryl running back to the house, and they joyfully reunite with everyone.", "tmdb_plot": "Daryl is a normal 10-year-old boy in many ways.

A handful of surviving humans live within a secure underground bunker housing scientists and soldiers in the Everglades. The scientists are trying to find a solution to the zombie pandemic; the soldiers have been assigned to protect them. Dr. Sarah Bowman, her lover and soldier Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator Bill McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their underground base to Fort Myers in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They find only a large horde of the undead and return to the base, where they are told that the military detachment's officer-in-charge Major Cooper has died. Sarah becomes concerned over Miguel's worsening mental state.\nDr. Logan, the lead scientist (nicknamed \"Frankenstein\" by the soldiers because of his grisly surgical dissections of the zombies), believes that the undead plague victims can be made docile and domesticated through training and conditioning. He keeps a collection of captive undead for use as test subjects in a large underground corral in the compound. Sarah vehemently opposes Logan's conditioning research; instead, she wants to search for a possible cure for the virus. Sarah discovers that Logan has been experimenting on the corpses of the dead soldiers, including Major Cooper. Scared that the other soldiers will turn on them, Sarah reluctantly keeps this a secret.\nThe angry and unstable Captain Rhodes and his soldiers vehemently object to the dangers involved in capturing zombies and keeping them inside the compound. The tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, the loss of communication with other survivors, and slow, uncertain progress in the research. During a meeting, Rhodes declares that he is taking command of the base. He only grants the scientists \"some\" time to prove results and declares that he will execute anyone who interferes with his leadership. He also threatens to abandon the scientists and leave the compound, cutting off their protection from the undead hordes.\nDisturbed by Rhodes' threats, Sarah discusses the situation with John and Bill. John professes his conviction that the zombie plague is a form of divine retribution against mankind, and suggests that the three of them should take the helicopter, abandon the soldiers, and fly to a desert island somewhere where they could live off the land and start a new life. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes' goodwill by showing him the results of his research. He is especially proud of \"Bub\", a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and engages in rudimentary human behavior. Rhodes, however, is not impressed and loses more patience with the scientists.\nDuring a zombie roundup mission, a zombie escapes its harness when Miguel loses his focus, resulting in the deaths of soldiers Miller and Johnson. Miguel snaps and attempts to kill the creature, but another zombie bites him on the arm. With John and Bill's help, Sarah amputates and cauterizes Miguel's arm to stop the infection. Rhodes calls off the experiments and demands that all captive zombies be destroyed, as well as denying any further help from him and his remaining men.\nSarah and Bill later go off to get medicine for Miguel, and discover that Logan had been experimenting on Miller and Johnson's remains. Fearing that Logan has gone insane, Bill decides that they should leave in the helicopter immediately. Rhodes finds out that Logan has been feeding the flesh of his dead soldiers to Bub as positive reinforcement for his behavior. Furious, Rhodes kills Logan and seizes the remaining scientists and non-military personnel, stripping them of their weapons. Rhodes attempts to force John to fly him and his remaining soldiers away from the base, which John refuses to do. In response, Rhodes kills Logan's assistant Fisher, locks Sarah and Bill inside the zombie corral, and orders Private Steel to beat John into submission.\nBack in the laboratory, Bub manages to escape from his chains and finds Logan's corpse. In a display of human emotion, he mourns the loss of his instructor, then picks up a pistol and goes in search of revenge. Meanwhile, a suicidal Miguel heads off to the surface. While the soldiers try to go after him, John knocks out Rhodes, steals his guns, and goes into the zombie corral to rescue Sarah and Bill. Miguel opens the perimeter fence, letting in a horde of zombies, and allows them to tear into him before pressing the elevator remote, allowing the zombies into the complex. As the undead swarm the bunker, Rhodes leaves his men behind to be killed.

Paul moves into Charley's apartment in a gang-turf war zone. The building is populated by elderly tenants terrified of Manny's gang. They include Bennett Cross, a World War II veteran and Charley's buddy; Mr. and Mrs. Kaprov, an elderly Jewish couple; and a young Hispanic couple, Rodriguez and his wife Maria. After a few violent muggings, Paul buys a used car as bait. When two gang members try to break into the car, Paul shoots them with his Colt Cobra. Paul twice protects Maria from the gang, but is unable to save her a third time. She is assaulted and raped, later dying in hospital from her injuries.\nKersey orders a new gun, a Wildey hunting pistol. He spends the afternoon with Bennett handloading ammunition for it. He then tests the gun when the Giggler steals his Nikon camera. Paul is applauded by the neighborhood as Shriker and the police take the credit. Kersey also throws a gang member off a roof. Public defender Kathryn Davis is moving out of the city and Kersey offers to take her to dinner. While waiting in his car, Kathryn is knocked unconscious by Manny and the car is pushed downhill into oncoming traffic. It slams into another car and explodes, killing Kathryn. Shriker places Kersey under protective custody, fearing he is in too deep. After Bennett's taxi shop is blown up, he tries to get even, but his machine gun jams. The gang cripples Bennett. Kersey is taken by Shriker to the hospital, where he escapes after Bennett tells him where to find a second machine gun. Kersey and Rodriguez collect weapons. They proceed to mow down many of the criminals before running out of ammunition. Other neighbors begin fighting back as Manny sends in reinforcements. Shriker decides to help, and Kersey and he take down many of the gang together. Kersey goes back to the apartment to collect more ammunition, but Manny finds him there. Shriker arrives and shoots Manny, but not before getting wounded in the arm. As Kersey calls for an ambulance, Manny (who was secretly wearing a bulletproof vest) rises and turns his gun on the two men. As Shriker distracts him, Kersey uses a mail-ordered M72 LAW rocket launcher to obliterate Manny. The remainder of the gang rushes to the scene and sees Manny's smoldering remains. Surrounded by the angry crowds of neighbors, the gang realizes they've lost and flee the scene. As the neighbors cheer in celebration and with police sirens in the distance, Shriker gives Kersey a head start.

At middle school, Ben develops a crush on Lori Swenson, but is unsure whether it is mutual. The boys also befriend punkish-but-likable Darren Woods, with whom they share their circuit-board concepts. Wolfgang builds an actual microchip based on Ben's drawings. The chip enables the generation of an electromagnetic bubble which surrounds a pre-determined area. The boys discover that the bubble is capable of moving at near-limitless distances and speeds without ill effects from inertia. They construct a rudimentary spacecraft out of an abandoned Tilt-A-Whirl car and name it the Thunder Road, after Bruce Springsteen's song of the same name. \nAfter Ben receives more dreams about the circuit board, Wolfgang discovers a means of producing unlimited sustainable oxygen; this means longer flights, whereas previously they were limited to whatever a typical oxygen tank could hold.

It is revealed that Wak and Neek are brother and sister and the gigantic creature is their father; they've taken his ship out for a \"joy ride\", sending the dreams to the boys in the hopes of meeting humans. Transmissions of old movies have kept the extraterrestrial populace at a distance \u2013 except for the curious Wak and Neek \u2013 due to the way humans depict violence toward alien life.\nWak and Neek's father allows the Thunder Road and its crew to depart, after Wak and Neek give the boys a parting gift: an amulet which, according to the extraterrestrials, is \"the stuff dreams are made of.\" The boys make it safely back to Earth, but a malfunction results in them crashing the Thunder Road into their neighborhood lake.

Kishen runs after her and a chase follows where Kishen takes her to the police station and gets her behind bars. Anuradha is an arrogant girl and calls up her brother, revealed as Ranjit Saxena. The police officer refuses to accept a bribe and locks Anuradha away.\nRanjit asks Vidyanath's brain to think of a way. Vidyanath sends his son Chutkiram (Shakti Kapoor) to beat Kishen up. Chutkiram has a lisp and has a crush on Anuradha, whom he lovingly calls Anu. A fight ensues between Kishen and Chutkiram and his goons, in which the latter are beaten up by Kishen. Kishen takes him to the police station and explains that he was attacked. Just then Ranjit comes and gives the bail orders for Anu and leaves, saying that Lucy has forgiven Anu for a sum of 25 000 rupees.\nKishen confronts Lucy in hospital and Kishen tells Lucy to keep the money. Just then Lucy's drunkard father (Jeevan) comes, takes the money and leaves. Kishen slaps him and tells him to get out Lucy's life. Lucy's father reluctantly leaves, vowing revenge. Anuradha is released from jail and is planning to take revenge on Kishen, and makes a bet with her friend.\nKishen lands a job as a chauffeur and he and his mom are very happy for his job. When he attends his first day at work, he finds out that he is Anuradha's driver, and Anuradha uses this as a means to humiliate Kishen by putting her feet in Kishen's face. He then throws her shoe away and she orders him to bring it. He then throws she shoe in her face and tries to slap him. Kishen then humiliates Anuradha and resigns from the job.\nThe girls then try to fool Kishen's mother by introducing themselves as social workers and tries to get close to Durga, in which she succeeds. The next day, Kishen and Durga go to a mandir, where they find Anuradha, and she is being very nice to Kishen, but Kishen doesn't fall for it and taunts her. He still hates her, and Anuradha swears in the mandir that she accepts Kishen as her husband and wants to marry him, but still Kishen doesn't fall for her. She then threatens to kill herself and runs away. She is about to jump off a cliff, but Kishen stops her, and professes his love.\nA song sequence occurs, and afterwards, Anuradha holds a party in which Kishen publicly professes his love for Anuradha, but Anu then shows her real face and tells him she did this for revenge. Kishen then forcibly takes her to the very same temple where she swore Kishen as her husband. Kishen then marries her. Anu's brother Ranjit, is looking for her and Kishen takes her home, and tells Ranjit that he has just married Anuradha. Ranjit is furious, but he cannot do anything. Kishen leaves saying that he is leaving his wife in Ranjit's care.\nRanjit goes to Vidyanath to help him out. Vidyanath then calls Durga and tells her that Kishen forcibly married Anuradha, and if he does not stay away from her, they will kill him. Durga collapses, and asks for Kishen to forgive her as she really wanted Kishen to marry Anuradha. She is admitted into hospital, and the doctor tells Kishen that she needs to be operated on and he needs to arrange for the money.\nVidyanath calls Lucy, and proposes to produce a play in which she and Kishen play the lead roles. Lucy and Kishen agree and meet Vidyanath, where they rehearse for the play in which Kishen falsely shoots Lucy. While this is all happening, Vidyanath is secretly recording their voices and the gunshot. Vidyanath gives Kishen the money he needs for the surgery and Kishen leaves.\nLucy is practicing her dance, when Chutkiram comes and tries to rape Lucy, and Vidyanath comes and shoots her. He replaces the tape with the recorded voices of Lucy and Kishen. Lucy's father comes and hears the tape playing and steals the tape. Just as he leaves, Kishen comes in and finds Lucy dead. Just then the police arrive and arrest Kishen. In court, they are unable to prove Kishen guilty and he is put in remand. Vidyanath then sends in his jailbirds to kill Kishen. A fight ensues, in which Kishen is losing and is about to be stabbed. Just then a man comes to help Kishen. When Kishen asks who he is, he talks in riddles.\nHere Ranjit and Vidyanath are tense as their plan flopped. Anuradha is listening to them talking and has a change of heart and truly accepts Kishen as her husband and declares this to her brother. Ranjit is furious and tries to kill her, but Vidyanath stops him. They let Anuradha go and Vidyanath reveals that they have the tape (they have found Lucy's father), and give this tape to Vidyanath's lawyer (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), who proves him guilty in court and he is sentenced to death. Vidyanath then kill Lucy's father by throwing him off a high building.\nIn jail, Kishen plays the song \"\"'Aana Jaana\"\"', the song he and Karan used to listen to in their childhood. Karan listens to the tune and immediately recognises it. They sing the song throughout the jail and finally find each other at the end of the song. They recognise each other from the fight the other day, and it is revealed that the unknown person is in fact Karan Kumar Khanna (Amitabh Bachchan), Kishen's lost older brother. Karan though, does not tell him who he is, but tells his story, from his childhood. Kishen finds a familiarity in his story and asks him to continue and he tells his story\nKaran seeks blessings from Hussein's mother for his promotion, and his mother asks when he's going to marry, and tells him to go and propose to Geeta (Madhavi). He goes to Geeta, who is a fellow inspector and proposes to her.\nThe next day, Geeta and Hussein's mother go to a jewellery shop, where robbers come in and take Geeta and Hussein's mother hostage. Karan then takes an entry and beats the robbers, but they run off. Unfortunate for them Inspector Hussein (Rajinikanth in a cameo role) is waiting for them and also beats them up. Both Karan and Hussein take them to jail.\nIt is revealed, that Ranjit, Vidyanath, Chutkiram and their lawyer are partners in crime and want Karan and Hussein finished. The Police Commissioner's son and Geeta's brother, Vijay (Sharat Saxena) is also involved in the crime gang. Karan and Hussein go and threaten to arrest them and to stop being a criminal. Later Vijay complains to his father, Police Commissioner Sinha (Om Shivpuri). The Commissioner warns Hussein and Karan to stay in their limits.\nA new case comes to Hussein and Karan and they promise to look into it. It is also Raksha Bandhan and Hussein leaves. Geeta and Hussein follow the ritual of \"Rakhi\", and then Geeta tries to explain to not abuse their police uniforms. A small fight ensues and Karan is listening. They joke around for a while and Hussein's mother blesses all three of them to live happy lives.\nAccording to the two pathans, they go to the place where they instructed, and arrest Ranjit and Vidyanath, but they get bailed out by their lawyer. They hatch a new plan, and call them to different places. Hussein and Karan fall into their trap, and Hussein is beaten up by Ranjit, and is murdered by Vijay and is burnt alive. Karan reaches too late and Hussein breathes his last in Karan's arms. Karan vows revenge. Karan delivers this bad news to Hussein's mother, and she cannot bear the shock and dies of misery.\nVijay is in hiding, but Karan finds him and burns him alive in the same way he killed Hussein, thus fulfilling his revenge. As he walks out laughing, he is arrested by Geeta and is sentenced to life imprisonment. Here Karan finishes his story to Kishen. At the same time, Durga comes to meet Kishen and Karan recognises her, and without revealing himself, vows to protect Kishen.\nThe next day Karan helps Kishen escape and is arrested for helping Kishen escape. While humorously explaining the situation, he escapes himself. And while on the run, he unknowingly enters the Commissioner' house, who is now handicapped and is confined to a wheelchair. When the Commissioner is about to shoot him, Karan pleads to let him go, to prove his brother, Kishen innocent. The Commissioner does not believe him, but on Geeta's insistence, he relents.\nDurga is informed by her father, that Karan is alive and Durga realises that the one who saved Kishen's life in jail, was in fact his older brother. After fleeing from the Commissioner's place, he returns home after a number of years. Mother and son reconcile and the relation between Karan and Kishen strengthens. The brothers decide to trap Vidyanath and Ranjit in their own trap, using Chutkiram as their pawn. They soon find out that Vijay has not died, but has survived.

Ranjit Singh Chaudhary (Dharmendra) is the son of a peasant, living in a village which is dominated by a rich landlord Thakur family. As a teenager studying in the village school, Ranjit is rebellious and defiant against deep rooted caste prejudices and discriminatory practices. He is bullied by the two sons of the landlord, who are of his own age. Two girls who also study in the same school are sympathetic to Ranjit. These are the daughter of the school-master and the daughter of the rich landlord (sister of the bullies). Sick of the exploitation he sees around him, Ranjit runs away to the city.\nSeveral years later, Ranjit's father dies and a telegram summons Ranjit back to the village to perform the last rites. Ranjit returns, to find that nothing has changed in the village. He is also told that his father had taken loans from the landlord to pay for his medicines and healthcare, and that Ranjit now is required to repay those loans, or forfeit his lands and house, which was the collateral for the loan. Ranjit feels that this is a great injustice. His logic of reasoning is that the peasants have been tilling the land and working hard for many generations, that the landlord only owns the land and does no work, and therefore if the landlord has lent money to a peasant, the loan does not need to be paid back. A long and emotional monologue delineates this logic for the benefit of the viewers.\nThe circumstances clearly call for class war and revolution, which Ranjit duly proceeds to ignite. He begins by storming into the landlord's living room, accusing him and his ancestors of being blood-suckers, and challenging him to take possession of the mortgaged land if he dares. The landlord's daughter (Smita Patil), who listens from behind a door, is deeply impressed by the scene created by her old schoolmate. Ranjit then retires to his house to perform his father's funeral, and bonds with his other friend, Moran (Reena Roy).

The landlord's sons (Bharat Kapoor and Mazhar Khan) make an attempt to rape Moran (Reena Roy). She is rescued by Ranjit, who then marries her because she clearly needs a protector. The disappointed Sumitra (Smita Patil) then agrees to marry the police officer chosen by her father, the landlord. She however carried her unrequited love in her heart, and her husband soon discovers that she had been in love with this other man. He is incensed and joins hands with his two evil brothers-in-law in their bid to finish Ranjit. By this time, after a random gunfight or two, once over the fact that the landlord's men were collecting their share of the harvest from the village peasants, Ranjit had become a fugitive from the law. Therefore, it is possible for the police office to go after him, beat him up in jail, and so on.\nThe rest of the movie comprises general bloodletting. Ranjit is supported in his vendetta by Javar (Mithun Chakraborty), a villager who has returned home after serving in the army, and by Gopi Dada (Kulbhushan Kharbanda), the village police havaldar, whose son had been murdered by the landlord's henchmen for daring to ride a horse on his wedding-day despite being from a lower caste.

Could it have something to do with his father (George Coe) being an influential (but corrupt) Senator?\nAmong the numerous subplots, Jack meets and falls in love with a young woman named Rachel (Lori-Nan Engler), who turns out to be the radical, left-wing daughter of the ruthless chairman of the board and CEO, Pete Helmes (Eddie Albert), who is revealed to be promoting Jack so he can gain Jack's father, Senator Issel's support to close down a textile plant in a small upstate town called Allenville, and move it into the Latin American country of San Marcos for company self-interest. Jack spends the rest of the movie trying to stop I.N.C. from closing down the plant, and trying to win Rachel's heart to prove that he can be a good businessman.\nThis film has a strong supporting cast in the many interrelated and unrelated subplots who include such established stars as Danny DeVito, an inside trader named Frank Stedman, and Rick Moranis, as a screaming burnout executive Howard Gross, both of whom die 20 minutes into the film, the former committing suicide by jumping out of a window into a fountain, and the latter dying of a heart attack. Other subplots include an executive named Mike Hoover (Wallace Shawn), another burnout who learns he is dying from an unknown terminal illness and everyone, including his coke-sniffing best friend Al Kennedy (Bruce Wagner), trying to maneuver into his job as head of the Latin American division. John Hudson (Merritt Butrick) is also a recent recruit at I.N.C. and one of Jack Issel's classmates who resorts to trickery to get ahead in the business. Boxing promoter Don King makes a cameo appearance as a I.N.C. executive.\nMidway through the film, most of the subplots end without a resolution, and the rest of the film focuses entirely on Jack and Rachel. Within a week of his employment, the further promoted Jack, with Max in tow, travel upstate to the town of Allenville to give a press conference on the closing of the textile plant where Rachel has organized a huge protest of thousands of workers and townspeople protesting the closing of the plant. The mob of townspeople attack and destroy Jack and Max's limousine, much to the chagrin of the company limo driver, Sal (Don Novello). At the same time, to impress Rachel, rather than tell a fabricated public relations story about the closing of the plant, Jack tells the truth to the reporters about I.N.C. reasons which are entirely of self-interest, while both the enraged Helmes and Jack's father watch the event on their TV sets. This does win over Rachel's affections and that night, she and Jack spend the night together.\nThe following morning, while Helmes decides to fire Jack, he sees that Jack's actions have drawn nationwide media attention whom hail Jack Issel as an honest businessman. Helmes changes his mind about firing Jack and invites him to his house that weekend, where Jack runs into Rachel again and finally learns that she is Helmes' daughter. Helmes tries to win over Jack's loyalty to I.N.C. by inviting him to a dinner reception at the council offices of a fictitious Latin American country of San Marcos where Jack is expected to give a $2 million bribe to a political rival of the San Marcos dictator General Sepulveda (John Kapelos) as another I.N.C. ploy to win the support of the dictatorship government for further business purposes.\nAt the reception, Jack sneaks Rachel into the building where they finally learn the truth about Helmes plans for Jack, as well as his plans for I.N.C.'s business with the country of San Marcos. Stealing the suitcase with the $2 million cash-bribe money, Jack and Rachel flee from the building security forces in a climatic chase and escape from the building and expose I.N.C.'s plans to the press. As a result, the textile plant in Allenville is saved, Pete Helmes is forced to resign from I.N.C. in disgrace, and Jack and Rachel both inherit the majority of I.N.C. stockholder shares.\nThe final scene has Jack, now the new chairman of the board at I.N.C., traveling in Pete Helmes' helicopter, to the offices with Sal as his pilot.", "tmdb_plot": "In this comic take on big-business wheelings and dealings, an ambitious senator's son (Judge Reinhold) moves up the corporate ladder through undeserved promotions.

Michael Dunn is enrolled at St. Basil's, a strict all-boys Catholic school. His grandmother is determined to see him fulfill his parents' dream of him joining the priesthood. Dunn befriends Caesar, an overweight, bespectacled student who enjoys reading and excels academically. Caesar helps Dunn catch up with the rest of the class, but because of their association, foul-mouthed bully and school troublemaker Ed Rooney pranks Dunn outside of the soda fountain across the street from school.\nAfter Rooney pulls a prank on Caesar, teacher Brother Constance attempts to get Dunn to identify the prankster by striking Dunn's open palms with a paddle. Fed up with Dunn's refusal to rat out the perpetrator, Constance shoves him to the floor. Dunn lunges towards Rooney and the pair are separated. Dunn and Rooney are sent to the office of the headmaster, Brother Thadeus. Rooney, impressed by Dunn's refusal to snitch, attempts to patch things up between them, but Dunn wants nothing to do with him. After school, Rooney tells Dunn that if they do not become friends, he will have to continue in his harassment in order to save face. Reluctantly, Dunn befriends Rooney and his friends, sex obsessed Williams and naive Corbett.\nDunn also befriends Danni, a teenaged girl who runs the soda fountain across from the school and cares for her mentally infirm father. Danni's fountain shop is raided numerous times by the Brothers, who wish to catch St. Basil's students misbehaving. The raids leave the shop in shambles. After one raid, Dunn helps Danni clean things up, sparking a romance.\nAt the sacrament of confession, Caesar enters the confessional, but Father Abruzzi becomes preoccupied with another student's misbehavior. Rooney enters the priest's booth and hears Caesar's confession, giving him the penance of befriending Rooney and making sure he gets passing grades. As a result, Caesar tutors and befriends Rooney.\nThe relationship between Dunn and Danni further develops, culminating in a kiss under the boardwalk at the beach. One day, during one of the Brothers' routine raids, Danni takes a stand and locks them out. The Brothers leave, but later contact social services. A few days later, Dunn and his friends see police cars and a few of the Brothers surrounding the soda fountain door as Danni's father is led out in handcuffs. Dunn rushes in and finds that social workers are preparing to take Danni away. A shaken Dunn takes Danni in his arms. Weeping, she wants him to promise that he won't be sad over her departure.\nAn angry Rooney develops another prank with the help of Caesar, Williams and Corbett to get back at the Brothers for having Danni taken away. The boys sneak onto school grounds at night and cut the head off the statue of St. Basil. During a school assembly the next day, Rooney presents Dunn with a duffel bag containing the missing head. Brother Constance sees the bag and accosts the boys into the gym, where Constance hits Corbett and Williams with a leather strap in an attempt to extract a confession for the vandalism. Caesar presents Constance with a doctor's note, presumably to exempt him from corporal punishment. Constance drags the cowering Caesar to the floor, beating him with the strap. Dunn angrily shoves Constance to the floor and then flees, with Constance and the other boys following him. The chase ends in the auditorium during the assembly. Constance backhands Dunn and calls him a bastard. Dunn then retaliates by delivering an uppercut to Constance, knocking him to the floor and causing pandemonium as the student body rises to its feet and cheers.\nThadeus suspends all five boys for two weeks.

However, Bobby is instructed that he is only allowed to reveal himself to Lenny and nobody else.\nBobby helps Lenny by giving him a makeover, assisting him in dealing with Fred and Bill, and helping him win the affection of the hottest girl in school, Sharon (Anne Sawyer). However, Bobby comes to realize that the new lifestyle Lenny is leading is not noble, as it causes him to rebel against everyone, including his parents and long-time friend Melissa (Nancy Valen). Bobby discovers that Lenny's mother is Emily, his former girlfriend, and is married to Joe, the man he was racing when he died.

It is revealed that the armed personnel were Latin American guerrillas disguised as Guardsmen on board a hijacked Coast Guard vessel.\nEventually, the real Coast Guard finds the boat with the murdered American Coast Guardsmen off the coast of Florida. The FBI and the Miami Police Department arrive at the docks to investigate the murders. The guerrillas land in Florida and exchange the drugs for weaponry from a drug dealer. They are led by the Soviet operative Mikal Rostov (Richard Lynch), the fake Coast Guard captain who opened fire on the Cuban refugees. Former CIA agent Matt Hunter (Norris) is asked to come out of retirement, but he declines. When Rostov and a team of guerrillas destroy Hunter's residence in the Everglades and kill his friend, John Eagle (Dehl Berti) in a failed assassination attempt, Hunter is convinced to reconsider.\nLater that day, hundreds of additional guerrillas land on the beaches of Southern Florida and move inland using several pre-positioned trucks. The guerrillas begin their assault by destroying suburban homes. Another group of guerrillas impersonating Miami police officers attacks a community center full of Cuban expatriates in Miami. When a squad car with genuine Miami policemen drives by to investigate the gunfire, the survivors angrily start vandalizing their car and leave the police perplexed. The FBI has no idea who is behind the attacks, but Hunter and the CIA believe that Rostov is behind the attacks.

US National Guard troops are called up, martial law is declared in the city, and armed civilians organize to protect their communities from further guerrilla attacks. Hunter continues pursuing the terrorists and thwarts their plans to bomb a church. One community evacuates their children by school bus to safer rural areas, unknowingly containing a bomb planted by Nikko Kador, Rostov's right-hand man. Hunter grabs the bomb from the moving bus, then throws it at the vehicle of Nikko, who had been shadowing this, eliminating him. However, after arriving at a carnival bombed by the terrorists, Hunter realizes that they are spread out too far for him to stem the tide of their attacks effectively and so devises an alternative plan.\nAlarmed by the threat, the government establishes a special theater command for the Southeastern United States with the headquarters at the Georgia-Pacific Tower in Atlanta. At the command center, all 50 state governors and military officials meet to stop the terror attacks. The FBI takes Hunter into custody for vigilantism against the terrorists, and he is taken to the command center, where he goads Rostov on national television to come out and kill him. Rostov orders all the guerrillas to assault the center in a mass attack, but they find no one inside. Hunter's arrest was a trap, and the National Guard arrives with tanks and troops, which hems the assailants in.

David offers his services as a mercenary in exchange for Achish\u2019s protection, and on the condition that he not be made to fight Saul. Achish agrees on the condition that when David is king of Israel, he will relinquish all captured Philistine land. David vows to be a just ruler, and gives Achish his oath. Saul and Jonathan are eventually killed in battle, and David is crowned King of Israel.\nAs king, David displays vanity, egotism, and a disregard for his prophets\u2019 instructions. He unveils plans to build a fanciful temple to house the Ark, which his prophet Nathan opposes on the grounds that it is contrary to God's preference for simplicity and humility. When Michal rebukes him, David falls for a woman named Bathsheba. She petitions him for her abuse at the hands of her husband Uriah and his refusal to give her a child. David arranges for Uriah to be killed in battle, and he and Bathsheba marry.\nAt the wedding reception, his son Absalom kills his half-brother Amnon after learning he raped their half-sister Tamar. David's laws deem that Absalom must be put to death, but the King insists he was avenging his sister, and banishes him from the kingdom instead.\nDavid\u2019s prophet Nathan eventually confronts him about Uriah\u2019s death. Fearing God will have her put to death, David pleads with him. Nathan concedes, but tells him that his first-born child with Bathsheba will not live to adulthood. David prays for forgiveness, but their first child dies after seven days. His second-born, Solomon, survives, and is proclaimed by Nathan to be heir to the throne. However, David argues that since Absalom is his eldest son, he is therefore the rightful heir despite his exile.\nDuring his three years of banishment, Absalom develops a following of his own. He campaigns to be made a judge, and fights against injustice on their behalf, against the King. David\u2019s advisors warn that Absalom is a traitor, planning an insurrection against him, but David defends his son.\nElsewhere, Absalom is led to believe that his father has forsaken him, and will declare Solomon as his heir. Absalom is advised to attack the kingdom, and organize an army. Against David\u2019s wishes, his army rides to fight Absalom\u2019s men and is ambushed. While trying to escape, Absalom is killed. David laments the death of his son, and Nathan chastises him for following his own emotions and disobeying God\u2019s law. David is apathetic, but eventually follows the commands delivered by the prophets, and successfully drives the Philistines from Israel. He destroys the model of his Ark temple, the final symbol of his vanity, and goes on to rule his kingdom justly.\nAfter forty years, David anoints Solomon to be the next king. On his deathbed, David instructs his son to rule with his heart, before remembering Jonathan.", "tmdb_plot": "This is a movie about the life of Israel's king David.", "tmdb_id": "42040", "wiki_id": "1203421"}, {"title": "King Solomon's Mines", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Jesse Huston (Sharon Stone) has hired Allan Quatermain to find her father, believed lost on an expedition to find the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Together with his companion, the mysterious Umbopo, they penetrate unknown country, following a map believed to be genuine. It transpires that Professor Huston has been captured by a German military expedition on the same quest, led by Bockner (Herbert Lom), a single-minded knackwurst-munching, bald-headed Colonel and a ruthless Turkish slave-trader and adventurer, Dogati (John Rhys-Davies), who is a long-standing adversary of Quatermain. Huston is being forced to interpret another map, also believed to be genuine.\nThe two rival expeditions shadow each other, clashing on several occasions, but Quatermain's group manages to rescue Professor Huston, who confirms the mines are indeed real and he implores Quatermain to stop Bockner and Dogati from finding them. After a few harrowing encounters with both the Germans and some of the local native tribes, they finally enter the tribal lands of the Kukuana who capture them. The tribe is under the control of the evil priestess, Gagoola, who has Quatermain hung upside down over a pond full of crocodiles. Just when all seems lost, Umbopo arrives and after defeating Gagoola's warriors in combat, reveals his identity as an exiled tribal chief and the rightful ruler of the Kukuanas.\nAs the tribesmen submit to him, Bockner and Dogati attack the village in full force. Amid the ensuing chaos, Gagoola captures Jesse and flees into caves in the depths of the Breasts of Sheba, the twin mountain peaks where the mines are located. Quatermain and Umbopo give chase after them and they are in turn pursued by Bockner and Dogati.  They follow Quatermain and Umbopo to the entrance to the mines, but are hampered by a moat of quicksand. Bockner orders his men forward into the moat, but they have trouble crossing it. Dogati then shoots down all of Bockner's soldiers, as well as most of his own men, and uses their bodies as stepping stones to cross the moat safely. As they approach the entrance, Bockner shoots Dogati and takes command of what little remains of the party.\nInside the mines, Quatermain and Umbopo rescue Jesse and find the resting place of all the former tribal queens, including the Queen of Sheba herself, encased in crystal. Umbopo explains that Gagoola had attempted to sacrifice Jesse in order to keep her power as the Kukuanas' ruler because of Jesse's strong resemblance to the Queen of Sheba. Then Gagoola appears and taunts Umbopo, who pursues her through the caverns.\nAs Bockner and his men arrive next, Quatermain and Jesse flee for safety, but end up in the cavern's treasure chamber, which is full of raw diamonds and other priceless treasures. As they gather some of the diamonds to take with them, Bockner hears their voices from outside the chamber, but before he can enter, Gagoola activates a hidden rock switch and seals Quatermain and Jesse inside the chamber. The switch also triggers a trap that causes the ceiling of the chamber, which is lined with stalactites to lower on them. Quatermain and Jesse manage to stop the ceiling trap, but then the chamber begins filling up with water. Just as the chamber fills completely, a lit stick of dynamite set by Bockner outside the chamber door explodes, sending them both spewing out of the chamber in the resulting flood to safety.\nBockner enters the chamber and quickly lays claim to the treasure, only to be confronted by a wounded, but very much alive, Dogati, who was wearing a protective vest that shielded him from the bullets. He then forces Bockner to swallow some of the diamonds, intending to cut him open to retrieve them later on. Meanwhile, Umbopo finally corners Gagoola. But rather than face his judgment, she instead leaps down one of the volcano's shafts and is incinerated when she lands in the molten lava below. However, the reaction causes a series of eruptions throughout the mines. Dogati is partially buried when the treasure chamber's ceiling collapses, but Bockner is unharmed. He gloats to Dogati after claiming a few more diamonds for himself, then leaves the chamber. But not before firing his gun at the ruined ceiling, burying Dogati alive. Quatermain, Jesse and Umbopo quickly flee for their lives through the collapsing caverns. They cross over a small booby- trapped lake (which one of Bockner's men fell victim to earlier), only to be stopped by Bockner, who demands they surrender their diamonds to him. Quatermain places the diamonds on the central stepping stone that triggers the trap and tells Bockner to come take the diamonds himself if he wants them. Bockner does so and falls into the lake, only to be seized in the jaws of a Mokele-mbembe and dragged beneath the water. The trap resets itself and the diamonds rise back to the surface, but Umbopo warns Quatermain and Jesse not to take them, saying they belong to the mountain.\nThe trio continue their escape through the caverns, which becomes even more dangerous as the lava chamber they are in is full of fire and falling rocks. Quatermain tells Umbopo to take Jesse through to safety while he follows them. But before he can do so, he is struck down by Dogati, who survived the cave-in. A brutal fight between them ensues, but Quatermain gains the upper hand at the last instant, sending Dogati falling into the chamber's lava pit to his death. Quatermain manages to escape from the mines at the last minute, just as the volcano explodes, sealing the entrance forever.\nReturning to the village, Umbopo assumes his rightful place as the ruler of the Kukuanas and he and his people bid a fond farewell to Quatermain and Jesse.

The hawk is sequestered in a room, but a curious Phillipe picks the lock and finds the mysterious woman inside, her chest struck with the bolt. After tending to her wound, Imperius explains that she is Isabeau of Anjou, who had once refused the Bishop's unwelcome advances.

They report the theft to Detective Ringwald, who is sympathetic but urges them to wait and see how things play out. When Billie Jean returns home, she finds Binx beaten, and his scooter severely damaged. The next day, Billie Jean, Binx, and Ophelia go to Mr. Pyatt's shop to get the amount of $608 to repair the scooter. While initially appearing helpful and understanding, Pyatt propositions Billie Jean and then attempts to rape her.\nMeanwhile, Binx has found a gun in the shop's cash register, and when Billie Jean flees from the back of the store, clearly distressed, he turns it on Mr. Pyatt, who tells him the gun is unloaded, but Binx fires it, wounding Pyatt in the shoulder. They race away from the shop and become fugitives.\nBy the time Ringwald realizes that he made a mistake not listening to Billie Jean, the situation is spinning out of control. Billie Jean wants only the cash to fix her brother's scooter and an apology from Pyatt. With help from Lloyd Muldaur, the teenage son of the district attorney, who voluntarily becomes her \"hostage\", Billie Jean makes a video of her demands, featuring herself with her long, blonde hair chopped into a crew cut, inspired after watching a movie about Joan of Arc on TV (the 1957 film Saint Joan) and a revolutionary-style wardrobe including combat boots, fatigue pants, and a wetsuit top with the sleeves torn off. As media coverage increases, Billie Jean becomes a teen icon, and young fans follow her every movement. Facing uncertain dangers, both physical and legal, Billie Jean is forced to turn in her friends Putter and Ophelia to the cops for their safety. When Ringwald arrives at the abandoned miniature golf course where the group has taken refuge and demands to know where Billie Jean is, Ophelia defiantly replies, \"Everywhere!\"\nPyatt issues a bounty for her apprehension, but Ringwald counters with a more peaceful offer and a promise to repair Binx's scooter. Billie Jean realizes the best plan is to turn herself in.

However, Hubie starts yelling that it isn't Billie Jean, and the police shoot Binx.\nBillie Jean runs to catch the ambulance taking Binx away but doesn't make it. She suddenly sees a booth with Billie Jean merchandise, run by Mr. Pyatt. Billie Jean confronts Pyatt and gets him to admit the actions that led to him being shot. He gives Billie Jean the money, but she refuses to take it all and rams her knee into his crotch, sending him sprawling to the ground and knocking over a nearby torch. She then tells him to keep his money and to go buy somebody else, throwing the money back in his face. Pyatt gets to his feet as the overturned torch begins to set his merchandise stands on fire.

Soon after, the guard revives two hours after his death and also displays the ability to drain others of their life force.\nMeanwhile, in Texas, an escape pod from Churchill is found with Carlsen inside. Carlsen is flown to London, where he describes the course of events, including feeling compelled to open the female vampire's container and share his life force with her, culminating in the draining of the Churchill crew's life force.

Initially refused entry because he has nothing to trade, he impresses the local officials with his toughness, and the founder and ruler of the town, Aunty Entity, offers to resupply him if he completes a task.\nAunty explains that Bartertown's precious energy comes from a subterranean refinery, called Underworld, that turns pig feces into methane. The refinery is run by a resourceful dwarf called Master, who rides around on Blaster, his giant bodyguard. \"Master Blaster\" has begun to challenge Aunty for control of Bartertown, and she wants Max to kill Blaster so she can more easily subvert Master to her will. \nMax inflitrates Underworld to size up Master Blaster and befriends Pig Killer, a convict sentenced to work there for slaughtering a pig to feed his children. When Master Blaster learns his newly-acquired vehicle belonged to Max, he forces Max to disarm a booby-trap. In doing so, Max sets off his alarm and discovers that Blaster is hypersensitive to high-pitched noises.\nBack on the surface, Aunty tells Max that, by law, conflicts in Bartertown are resolved by a fight to the death in a gladiatorial arena called Thunderdome. Max publicly accuses Master of stealing his vehicle, which a mechanic has converted to run on methane, and a battle is scheduled against Blaster. The giant dominates until Max blows a bosun's whistle, which makes Blaster grab his head in pain. Max knocks Blaster's helmet off and prepares to kill him, but relents upon seeing that Blaster has an intellectual disability. Max reveals Aunty's plot and Master threatens to shut down the refinery, so Aunty has Blaster killed. She is then able to terrorize Master into keeping the refinery running.\nFor breaking a deal, Max is bound, placed on a horse, and sent into the Wasteland, his punishment determined by the spin of a wheel. When the horse collapses from exhaustion, Max frees himself and continues on foot until he also collapses.\nSavannah Nix finds Max near death and hauls him back to her home, an oasis populated by a primitive tribe of children and teenagers. The children are descended from survivors of a crashed Boeing 747, some of whom left to seek help and never returned. They believe Max is the pilot, Captain Walker, come to fix the aeroplane and fly them to the fabled \"Tomorrow-morrow Land\". Max denies he is Walker and insists there is no longer any civilisation like that in their stories. Disillusioned, a group of children led by Savannah wants to attempt the journey to Bartertown, but Max stops them and has them tied up, saying everyone should go on living in the oasis.\nDuring the night, the separatists escape. Max agrees to bring them back, taking a few children along, but both parties are in bad shape by the time he catches up. Out of supplies, Max is forced to lead the children back to Bartertown.\nThe combined group sneaks into Underworld and, with Pig Killer's help, frees Master and escapes in a modified truck down some train tracks, destroying the refinery and most of Bartertown in the process. Aunty orders her forces to pursue and retrieve Master, and Max and his group do their best to fight off the attackers. They come across Jedediah and his son, who Max coerces into providing a ride in their aeroplane. With the approach of Aunty's army shortening the runway, Max gets in his vehicle, which a child stole from one of Aunty's men, and crashes an opening so the plane can take off.

It is the early 20th century when India remains part of the British empire. The opening sequence shows a group of British soldiers plundering an Indian fort and taking its riches by air England. They are stopped by the valiant Raja Azad Singh (Dara Singh), who is immensely strong and manages to lasso the light aircraft, subdue several English soldiers and recover the stolen jewels. Around this time, Raja Azad Singh's wife Rani Durga (Nirupa Roy) gives birth to a baby boy, who is named Raju. Raja carves the word mard (man, intending to convey strength and bravery) into the newborn's chest, noting proudly that the baby is smiling throughout, and can apparently feel no pain. (His words, mard ko dard nahin hota, meaning \"a true man feels no pain\", are a recurring dialogue throughout the movie.) The British commission conducts an investigation, led by a sympathetic and liberal Englishwoman, Lady Helena; the investigation uncovers the atrocities of the English troops and results in several officers being officially reprimanded. Lady Helena is a close confidante of Raja Azad Singh and is generally supportive of Raja and the idea of India gaining independence from British rule.\nThe English officers General Dyer (Kamal Kapoor) and Inspector Simon (Bob Christo) conspire with a snivelling, weak-willed local doctor Harry (Prem Chopra) to capture Raja. Harry sedates Raja; weakened thus, Raja is captured and imprisoned in a dungeon. Rani Durga escapes on Raja's faithful steed Bahadur. But she is shot, and the horse brings baby Raju to a local orphanage for safekeeping until Rani Durga can recuperate and reclaim him. The wife of a poor blacksmith spots baby Raju in the orphanage, asks after him and eventually adopts him. When Rani Durga returns, she is shocked to find her baby gone and she loses the ability to speak. The penniless Rani Durga eventually becomes a washerwoman. The traitor Harry is appointed mayor of the town for his part in the capture of Raja.\nRaju grows up to become a strong youth under the care of the loving blacksmith and his wife. His day job is to run a tanga. One day, he happens across an arrogant and oppressive young woman who blithely runs her car over an old lady. Raju gives chase, intercepts the young woman, and compels her to apologise to the old lady. The young woman is of high birth, and her bodyguard Zybisko (Manik Irani) engages Raju, but Raju fends him off quite easily. The young woman turns out to be Ruby, the daughter of mayor Harry. Ruby apologises. But she is charmed by Raju's rugged looks and candour. He initially refuses her advances to maintain his independence. But she eventually falls in love, changes his heart, and invites him to her birthday party.\nHarry and General Dyer continue their relentless quest for power. Their first move is to demolish the basti (slum colony) in front of Harry's mansion. Raju rallies the basti dwellers to oppose the demolition crew and picket Harry's mansion. Harry arrests Raju and is about to execute him when Lady Helena arrives on the scene. Lady Helena stops the demolition (citing lack of documentation), reprimands Harry, and releases Raju. Harry tries to buy off Raju, but Raju douses the cases with liquor, sets it afire, and uses the soot to blacken Harry's face. (No, it is certainly black money, for it burns black, he observes!) A frustrated Harry tries to have him a shot, but Ruby intervenes, professes her love for the tanga wallah (tanga driver), and threatens to completely disavow her father if any harm should befall him. Unable to subdue or subvert Raju, a frustrated set of cronies (Harry, Dyer, Simon, and others) fret and fume.\nThe film introduces Danny (Dan Dhanoa) the son of General Dyer. Danny is every bit as corrupt, cunning, and avaricious as his father and his cronies. Danny runs the nefarious operations beneath the outwardly clean, lordly and manorial life of General Dyer and mayor Harry. There are three such operations. First, there is a secret blood camp; basti dwellers that are infirm, aged or otherwise unfit are secretly abducted and their blood (all of it) is involuntarily extracted to supply British war campaigns elsewhere. Second, there is a slave labour camp where, again, basti dwellers are put to work (with no pay) on various civil and construction projects for the British empire. And finally there is Raja Azad Singh, still imprisoned, and a champion for the basti and for the workers in the labour camps. His primary duty is to turn, by hand, a massive flour mill; this mill is the only source of food for the camps. (Rani Durga, it turns out, is a washerwoman in one of these camps.) The camps grow in size, and Raja Azad Singh secretly plans to have them revolt; this becomes a growing concern for Harry.\nHarry and General Dyer decide the best way to remove Raju from the picture is to announce the engagement of Ruby and Danny. Ruby strongly opposes this and runs off with Raju. Danny gives chase with his men, and even tries to kill Ruby, but eventually brings her back to Harry. Harry is truly enraged. He threatens to kill Ruby if she ever disobeys him again. Danny devises a nefarious plot to get rid of Raju.\nAs the first step in the plot, Danny captures the blacksmith, burns his hovel, murders his wife, and puts the blacksmith in a slave camp. (As she lays dying, she reveals to Raju the story of his birth. Raju cremates his foster mother and writes out a letter for his real mother, which he immerses into the river along with the ashes of his foster mother. The river carries his note to the camp where the blacksmith finds it and reads it out to Rani Durga, who immediately recalls her story. The blacksmith stages a stick-up to facilitate her escape, and she is ultimately reunited with Raju. The blacksmith, however, is killed.)\nDanny learns of Raju's lineage. Realizing Raju will attack the camp to free the blacksmith and Raja Azad Singh, Danny plays the second step of his plot and lays a trap. Raju enters the dungeon to rescue his father. But it turns out that Raja Azad Singh has been replaced by a masked impostor (Simon), and Raju is captured.\nAt this point, Danny devises a fatal final step. He announces a gladiatorial sword fight between Raju and Raja Azad Singh where the winner will go free. Prior to this fight, he takes steps to ensure father and son are truly bloodthirsty for the other. Raja Azad Singh is brought to a blood camp where he sees Raju (actually a masked imposter) extracting blood from innocent citizens and swearing loyalty to the British; the Raja is incensed and swears to finish him off in the contest. Concurrently, Danny sends word (through Ruby) that the fighter opposing Raju will be a masked impostor and not the real Raja. Raju, in turn, announces he will not let his opponent leave the ring alive. And Danny forthwith arranges to have the real Raja fight Raju.\nThe contest begins on the next day, and father and son are soon in a crazed sword fight. The duel takes a turn when the Raja spots the word mard on Raju's chest, and Raju notices one of his blows drew blood from the Raja's cheek. They quickly discover the truth and keep up the appearance of a death duel until the Raja hoists Raju off the arena and into the viewing gallery. Raju plunges his sword into General Dyer, killing him instantly.\nDanny is infuriated. He orders his tanks to finish off Raju and the Raja. (Lady Helena and Rani Durga are strapped to the tanks, with British soldiers holding them at gunpoint.) Raju and the Raja seize horses and escape, with the tanks in hot pursuit. After a long chase and fight, Raju and the Raja overpower the tanks, rescue the ladies and engage the villains in combat. After a hard sword-and-gun fight, Harry, Danny, and Goga are drowned in quicksand, and Raju and his father return victorious.\nThe film ends with Raju and Ruby coming together and being reunited with Raju's real parents, on the dawn of India's independence movement.", "tmdb_plot": "Mard (English Translation: Male or Man or Macho) is a 1985 Hindi action film, starring Amitabh Bachchan and Amrita Singh and directed by Manmohan Desai.

Rocky's mother, Florence \"Rusty\" Dennis, is determined to give Rocky as normal a life as possible, in spite of her own wild ways as a member of the Turks biker gang, as well as her strained relationship with her father. She fights for Rocky's inclusion in a mainstream junior high school, and confronts a principal who would rather classify Rocky as intellectually disabled and relegate him to a special education school, despite the fact that his condition has not affected his intelligence. At Rocky's semi-annual physical, Rocky claims to be feeling pretty well, despite recurring headaches that his mother can remedy by simply singing to them. A young doctor tells Rusty that Rocky's life expectancy is limited to six more months, which Rusty scoffs at, exclaiming that many other doctors have made claims about Rocky's condition that were completely unfounded.\nRocky thrives at school, making friends by assisting a fellow student with remembering his locker combination, and winning over a class by using humor when faced with an awkward silence during roll call, where Rocky just repeats the prior new student's line, \"Wow, thanks a lot.\" He shows his brilliance in history class by giving a unique rendition of the Greek myth about the Trojan Horse and it being the turning point of the Trojan War.

His lifelong dream of a motorbike trip through Europe collapses when his best friend Ben, who was to come with him, reveals to him that he is permanently moving back to Michigan to go live with his father. This drives Rocky into berating Ben and calling him \"stupid\", then finally revealing to Ben that he conned him out of a Rube Walker card. Rocky also finds it difficult to thrive at high school, where none of his previous friends are, and he responds with hostility towards those who make fun of him, when he used to humorosly shrug it off. However, Rocky feels better after taking a bus trip by himself to visit Diana at the equestrian stables, located near Griffith Park. Diana reveals to Rocky that her parents had prevented her from receiving his phone messages and are sending her to a private boarding school for the blind.

Jones witnesses Carter's crash via security cameras but is unable to arrive in time before Lynch's hired goons remove him from the scene.\nGrossman is upset Lynch has attacked and possibly killed Carter, as the journalist's fame means his disappearance will be noticed and investigated.

This way they can create a digital replacement and fake footage of the reporter being alive and well for days to come. But his efforts are flawed. The digital clone does not look identical to Carter and seems to develop its own personality after repeatedly saying \"max headroom.\" Giving up on the plan, Bryce instructs hired goons to dispose of both Carter and the \"Max Headroom\" digital personality. Instead, the goons decide to profit by selling Max Headroom to Blank Reg, owner of a pirate television station, and Carter to a \"body bank\" where he will be harvested for organs.\nAfter absorbing information from TV broadcast signals, Max Headroom quickly becomes a popular TV host on Blank Reg\u2019s pirate station, delivering biting commentary and rapid-fire humor.

Arun's parents teach their children through the famous title song \"Zindagi Har Kadam Ek Nayi Jung Hai, Jeet Jayenge Hum, Jeet Jayenge Hum Tu Agar Sang Hai\" which means that life is full of challenges at every step and still we will overcome all these if we are together.\nArun's father is trapped in a murder case. A famous criminal lawyer G . D Thakral (Amrish Puri) proves him guilty, and he is sentenced to be hanged by the court. Pleas by Arun's mother fail to convince Thakral to be truthful and spare her husband. Thakral asks her to give evidence for his innocence, to which she sadly quotes, \"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya wo nirdosh nahin hote\" (\"one who does not have any proof or witness of innocence, are they not innocent?\"). Thakral was determined to let her husband hang. He is hanged as per the court's decision. His mother becomes mentally unstable from shock and is sent to a mental institution. Later Advocate Gupta (A. K. Hangal), the lawyer who defended Arun's father, finds out that Thakral had known all along that he was innocent, but only wanted him to be hanged. Arun finds out that Thakral abused the law.\nArun's house and all his property are auctioned off by the court. Arun and his sister are not offered help. He grows up with the seeds of revenge in his heart. He becomes a successful defence lawyer and keenly follows every case of Thakral so that some day he can stand up in court against the unbeaten Thakral and beat him.\nOne day Geeta Srivatsav (Meenakshi) comes to him and asks him to fight the case of her sister, Dr. Asha Mathur (Bina), who is accused of killing a patient on duty with her medicine, which she gave from her purse. Arun refuses saying that if she can produce even a piece of evidence of her sister being innocent he will fight for her. Geeta replies coincidentally the same sentence \"Jiske paas koi sabut, koi gavanh nahi hote kya wo nirdosh nahin hote.\" Arun is instantly reminded of his mother's pleadings before Thakral. Geeta storms out of his office, but Arun is convinced to take the case. He meets Asha Mathur in police custody. He learns from her that on that fateful night she got a call from her ward assistant that her patient is in the ICU and needs her. She stops on the way (due to a traffic jam), and she impatiently moves out of her car to ask the reason. Meanwhile, somebody replaces the medicine bottle with the look-alike bottle of poison from her purse. On arrival in the hospital, she gives the liquid from that bottle to stabilise the patient. This resulted in the patient's death.\nIt is shown that Asha Mathur's husband, Dr. Dinesh Mathur (Parikshit Sahni), had gone to meet Thakral and had asked him to fight his wife's case. Thakral says no, claiming he is very busy at the moment, but later tells his assistant that there is no way that this case could be won. Arun meets Dinesh Mathur and informs him that he will fight the case. He asked him about the nature of poison and for how long a person can sustain the poison; he learns that poison might result in death within 2 to 15 minutes depending on the body's resistance.\nThe case begins with the prosecution lawyer recounting the events of that fateful day and telling that the medicine given to the patient was actually poison. Arun defends the case says that the patient did not die of this medicine. To prove himself right he drinks the medicine in court and refutes the claim. The court declares Geeta's sister not guilty. Just after the judgement, Dr. Mathur rushes Arun to hospital. It is revealed that the medicine contained poison, and Arun is saved in the nick of time.\nGeeta calls him on a beach to appreciate his efforts and kindness at the canteen. They fall in love. Thakral's son Vikram Thakral (Javed Jaffrey), a spoiled brat, not knowing anything about Arun, teases Geeta, which irritates the couple. Soon things take an ugly turn and Arun beats up Vikram.\nDr. Mathur wants to appreciate and compensate Arun for the risky effort he took to save his wife. He calls him for a get-together in his mansion. Dr. Mathur gives Arun a blank cheque. Arun rejects the offers politely and says he did for his self-satisfaction. He then finds the same piano with the sticker of Bhagwat Geeta of Krishna which his father used to play and was auctioned. His memories are refreshed again and with the emotional request he tells Dr. Mathur that this piano is very significant to him and asks for it. Dr. Mathur very happily gives him the piano.\nOne day at Arun's home, Mr. Mathur sees a photo of the former's mother hanging on the wall. He immediately recognises the face with the patient he was handling for mental disorders. Arun and his sister request them to take them to her. In the mental hospital they see their mother. Her memories had stopped on the day of the incident; she feels that their children are eight and five, staying with father. Arun brings her mother to his house and tries to make her come back to normal; she regains her memory on hearing the song \"Zindagi Har Kadam...\"\nMeanwhile, Vikram wants to exact revenge on Arun and devises a plan to trap Komal who studies in the same college. He tries to impress her by his charms, dancing skills, and ways of flattering people. The plan works. Komal falls for him and he convinces her to run away with him (so that he can publicly defame Arun by leaving his sister). At the planned moment, one of Vikram's ex-girlfriends shows up and tells Komal of Vikram's evil intentions. In the ensuing argument, Vikram murders his girlfriend which is witnessed by Dr. Mathur's family.\nArun had been waiting for this moment to take revenge on Thakral.

When the three pieces - two separated arms, each holding a small sword, and a head/torso - are united, it makes the owner impervious to harm from blades. Believing the Empire is in need of reform and that the Supreme Ninja is too dangerous to possess such power, the three Ninja Masters steal and separate the pieces of the Golden Ninja Warrior.\nThe Ninja Empire seeks out these rogue ninjas in order to retrieve the missing pieces of the shrine.

On Harry's advice, Jaguar leaves to protect Michiko from Tiger Chan, defeating several agents. When he attempts to warn her about the danger of the Golden Ninja Warrior, she doesn't know what she's talking about and mistakes his questions for threats.

Meanwhile, Ninja Master Harry and Ninja Master Baron, each the other has already tried to assassinate them. After each shows the throwing star used against them, Harry concludes that Yamato is the true culprit, as he had access to throwing stars they used when they all still worked for the Ninja Empire. Harry suggests that the Supreme Ninja's warrior Yamato killed Tamashi and then tried to trick him and Baron into killing each other by planting the stars. He suggests he and Baron work together rather than against each other.\nYamato sends a tiny robot to deliver a threat to Harry, then calls him on the phone to make sure he got it, telling him he has three days to return his piece of the Golden Ninja Warrior. Baron is also threatened by a toy robot from the Empire.

The child is named James, with Suryaprakasam's blessings. However, Suryaprakasam is an evil man and was smitten by Rosy, when he saw her.

Otto is introduced to the Kohlen und Reibachs to receive their gratitude, but Otto is quick to note that he could use their wealth to pay back his debt. But every chance he gets slips through his fingers, either owing to the callings of his conscience (such as when he attempts to shoot a hare for a reward which matches his debts exactly) or by dumb luck (when the wine he receives from the Kohlen und Reibachs turns out to be quite valuable, but only after a wine lover has consumed a considerable quantity of it).\nSilvia and Otto also find themselves drawn to each other, but their main obstacle against their getting together is Silvia's stern mother, Konsulin (\"Consul\") von Kohlen und Reibach, who wishes her daughter to marry befitting to her status and who has selected a prospective candidate named Ernesto, a handsome South American millionaire.\nIn the end, Otto realizes his true affections for Silvia only after she and her mother prepare to depart for Rio de Janeiro for Silvia's wedding to Ernesto.

After having been spurned by her Swedish nobleman lover, she asks his brother, Baron Bror Blixen, to marry out of mutual convenience and they move to the vicinity of Nairobi, British East Africa.  Using her funds, he is to set up a dairy ranch, with her joining him a few months later, at which time they will marry. En route to Nairobi, her train is hailed by a big-game hunter named Denys Finch Hatton, who knows her fianc\u00e9 and entrusts his haul of ivory to her.\nShe is greeted at the railway station by Farah, the Somali headman hired by Bror, who is nowhere to be found. She is taken to the recently founded Muthaiga Club. She enters the men-only salon to ask for her husband and, because of her gender, is asked to leave. Karen and Bror marry before the day is out and she becomes Baroness Blixen.\nShe then learns that Bror has changed their agreed-upon plan and has spent her money to establish a coffee farm. She quickly learns that the farm is at too high an elevation to offer much of a chance of success. She needs Bror's help in building and managing this farm, but his interest is more in guiding game hunting safaris than in farming.\nKaren comes to love Africa and the African people and is taken in by the breathtaking view of the nearby Ngong Hills and the Great Rift Valley beyond. Meanwhile, she looks after the Kikuyu people who are squatting on her land. Among other things, she establishes a school, helps with their medical needs, and arbitrates their disputes. She also attempts to establish a formal European homelife on par with the other upper class colonists in the area. Meanwhile, she becomes friends with a young woman, Felicity (whose character is based on a young Beryl Markham). Eventually, Karen and Bror develop feelings for each other. But Bror continues to pursue other sexual relationships because their marriage is still a partnership based on convenience.\nAs the First World War reaches East Africa, the colonists form a militia led by the colonial patriarch Lord Delamere, which includes Denys and Bror among their number. A military expedition sets out in search of the forces from the neighboring German colony of German East Africa. Responding to the militia's need for supplies, Karen leads a difficult expedition to find them and returns safely. Shortly after the end of the war, in the evenings, Karen makes up exotic and imaginative stories to entertain her visitors.\nKaren discovers that Bror has given her syphilis. As she is unable to receive proper treatment in Nairobi, she returns to Denmark for treatment and recuperation. Bror agrees to manage the farm while she is away. When she returns, now unable to bear children, Bror resumes his safari work and they begin to live separately.\nThe relationship between Karen and Denys develops and he comes to live with her. Denys acquires a Gipsy Moth biplane and often takes Karen flying. Karen and Bror get a divorce on the grounds of Bror's infidelity. When Karen learns that Denys has taken one of her female acquaintances on a private safari, Karen comes to realize that Denys does not share her desire for a monogamous, domestic relationship. He assures her that when he is with her he wants to be with her and states that a marriage is immaterial to their relationship. Eventually, this drives them apart and, refusing to be tied down, he moves out.\nThe farm eventually yields a good harvest, but a fire destroys much of the farm and factory, forcing her to sell out. She prepares for her departure from Kenya to Denmark by appealing to the incoming governor to provide land for her Kikuyu workers to allow them to stay together and by selling most of her remaining possessions at a rummage sale.  Denys visits the now-empty house and Karen comments that the house should have been (empty) all-along and, as with her other efforts, the returning of things to their natural state is as it should be. Denys says that he was just getting used to her things.\nAs he is about to depart for a safari scouting trip in his airplane, they agree that the following Friday he will return and fly her to Mombasa; with Karen then continuing on to Denmark. Friday comes and Denys does not appear. Bror then arrives to tell her that Denys' biplane has crashed and burned in Tsavo.  During Denys' funeral, Karen recites an excerpt of a poem by A. E. Housman about a lauded athlete dying young who, as with Denys, is not fated to decline into old age. Later, as she is about to depart, she goes to the Muthaiga Club to complete arrangements for forwarding any mail. The members, having come to admire her, invite her into the men-only salon for a toast. At the railway station, she gives Farah the compass that Denys had given to her and says goodbye to Farah, then turns back to ask him to say her name so she can hear his voice one last time. Later, Farah writes to Karen in Denmark, telling her that a pair of lions often visit Denys' grave.\nAs the movie ends, the on-screen narrative notes that Karen later became a published author under the pen name Isak Dinesen.

Jerry ends up becoming the camp con man, operating such scams as a letter writing concession using Brian, turning the P.X. into \"his own personal candy store\", and making outlandish demands to help win Bobby his much-coveted spot on the Varsity baseball team by acting as his agent .  \"It's an honor to play for the Yankees, but Dave Winfield still cashes his checks\", says Jerry.  Along with Bobby, he hatches a plan to sneak over to the neighboring girls' camp to visit a girl he met on the train ride to camp.  Timmy is always finding new and creative ways to escape, including busting out in a laundry truck and trying to sneak out by way of the girls' camp across the lake dressed in drag.  The camp is run by 'Big Irv' Klopper and his wife Margo (much to her apparent displeasure).  Baxter's arch-rival is fellow counselor Ike, who is much more serious about his job than Baxter.  Ike is not at all popular among the campers and is seen as being something of a \"Square\", having been educated in a military school. Maintenance man Walter carries around a red-stained axe and is rumored to be a murderer.\nAs the summer progresses, Timmy makes friends with the other kids and stops trying to run away.  Eventually he learns to swim and enters a swimming race in the annual Color War competition.  Jerry, who is on the opposite team in the Color War, tells Timmy the story of \"Tough Break Thompson\", a camper who supposedly drowned after conquering his fear of water at the camp.  Timmy panics during the swimming event when Jerry says \"Timmy - tough break!\" to him right before the race.  Bobby then punches Jerry when he finds out what happened.  Later, Jerry apologizes and the kids learn that their friendship is more important than the winner of the Color War, and the Color War is declared a tie.  The climactic moment of the movie occurs when a camper shouts, \"Timmy Mezzy's swimming the lake!\" and the whole camp runs to watch Timmy swim across the lake, finally conquering his fear of water.  Walter is also revealed to be a painter who uses his axe to create art.  At the end of the summer, Baxter is offered the job of head counselor for the following year, having been chosen over Ike, much to Ike's chagrin.

At 6:12 a.m., the sun darkens for a moment, and a red light surrounded by darkness is briefly seen.\nZac Hobson is a scientist employed by Delenco, part of a United States-led international consortium working on \"Project Flashlight\" \u2013 an experiment to create a wireless global energy grid to power military equipment. He awakens abruptly; when he turns on his radio, he is unable to receive any transmissions. He drives into the city, which he finds deserted. Investigating a fire, he discovers the burning wreckage of a passenger jet, but there are no bodies, only empty seats. Every living animal and human appears to have vanished between the ticks of a clock.\nZac enters his laboratory, but fails to contact any of the other labs around the world. In an underground lab, he discovers the dead body of Perrin, his superior, at the primary Flashlight Grid control panel; a monitor displays the message \"Operation Flashlight Complete\". The mass disappearance seems to coincide with the moment Flashlight was activated. The lab is suddenly and automatically sealed because of radiation, so he improvises a gas bomb to escape. He listens to his own voice on a tape recorder describing the project as having \"phenomenal destructive potential\", then notes: \"Zac Hobson, July 5th. One: there has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight with devastating results. Two: it seems I am the only person left on Earth.\" He refers to the phenomenon as \"The Effect\".\nAfter a week of trying to contact another human being, Zac moves into a mansion. His mental state begins to deteriorate. He puts on a woman's nightgown and alternates between exhilaration and despair.

The three determine why they survived: at the instant of The Effect, they were all at the moment of death: Api was being drowned during a fight, Joanne was electrocuted by a faulty hairdryer, and Zac had overdosed on pills in a suicide attempt. He had realized the experiment posed serious dangers and was guilt-ridden for not speaking out. The discovery of his body, with his lab ID and tape recorder nearby, would have the consequence of exposing Project Flashlight and ending the experiment before it was too late.\nA love triangle develops, but Zac is more concerned about his scientific observations: universal physical constants are changing, causing the Sun's output to fluctuate and become highly unstable. Zac fears The Effect will occur again (and that the Sun will soon collapse in any case and obliterate the Earth) and decides to destroy the Delenco facility. Api has provided the possible answer \u2013 if the still-active Flashlight Grid is balanced, and is continually destabilizing the Sun, then knocking out the facility would make the Grid fail.

With the Vietnam War now officially over, the public has become increasingly concerned over news that US POWs have been left in enemy custody in Vietnam. To placate their demands for action, the US government has authorized a solo infiltration mission to confirm the reports. Rambo agrees to undertake the operation in exchange for a pardon.\nIn Thailand, Rambo meets Marshall Murdock, the bureaucrat overseeing the operation. He is temporarily reinstated into the US Army and instructed only to take pictures of a suspected POW camp, not to attempt their rescue or engage any enemy personnel. Any POWs are to be retrieved by a better-equipped extraction team upon his return.\nDuring his aerial insertion, Rambo's parachute gets caught in the airplane door, forcing him to cut himself free and jettison most of his equipment, leaving him with only his knives, bow and arrows. He meets his assigned contact, a female Vietnamese intelligence agent named Co Bao, who arranges for a local band of river pirates to take them upriver. Reaching the army camp, Rambo sneaks inside, spotting POWs. When he finds one of them tied to a cross-shaped post, suffering from exposure, he frees him against orders and flees with Co and the POW.\nThey are discovered by Vietnamese troops and cut off by an armed gunboat. The river pirates try to hand them over to the Vietnamese troops. Rambo kills the pirates and destroys the gunboat with an RPG, while the POW and Co Bao swim to safety. Rambo asks Co to stay behind shortly before they reach the extraction point. When the approaching rescue helicopter, with Col. Trautman inside, radios back to base that Rambo has found a POW, Murdock orders the crew to abort the rescue. Trautman, held at gunpoint by the side gunner, is powerless to intercept the crew from abandoning Rambo and the POW. They are both captured and returned to the Vietnamese camp.\nWhen Trautman confronts him, Murdock reveals that he never intended to save any POWs, explaining that Congress expected Rambo to find nothing, and if he did, Murdock would dispose of any photographic evidence or even leave Rambo to die. He removes Trautman from the mission to keep him from helping Rambo.\nRambo understands that the Soviets are assisting the Vietnamese. He is interrogated by the local Soviet liaison, Lieutenant Colonel Podovsky, and his right-hand man, Sergeant Yushin. Having learned from intercepted missives that Rambo's extraction was aborted, Podovsky demands that Rambo broadcast a message to Murdock warning against any further POW rescue missions. Rambo refuses, and as Co infiltrates the camp disguised as a prostitute, he is tortured with electric shocks. Rambo finally relents when the prisoner he tried to rescue is brought in and threatened with eye-gouging. Rambo dials in his secret radio code frequency to contact his base, but uses the opportunity to threaten Murdock, then overpowers his captors and escapes the camp with Co's help. Rambo agrees to take Co to the United States, and they kiss. As they start moving again, a small Vietnamese force attacks the pair and Co is killed. An enraged Rambo guns down the soldiers and buries Co in the mud.\nRambo, using his knife and bow, systematically dispatches the Soviet and Vietnamese soldiers sent after him, using an explosive arrow to blow up the Vietnamese officer who killed Co. After surviving a barrel bomb dropped by Sgt. Yushin's helicopter, Rambo clambers aboard and throws him out of the cabin to his death. Rambo takes control of the helicopter and lays waste to the prison camp using rockets and machine gun fire, before extracting the POWs and flying towards friendly territory in Thailand.\nPodovsky, pursuing in a Hind helicopter gunship, fires at Rambo's chopper, seemingly disabling it. When the gunship moves in, Rambo, who had faked the crash of his helicopter, uses a rocket launcher to destroy the gunship, killing Podovsky. After returning to base with the POWs, Rambo confronts Murdock with his knife, demanding that Murdock rescue the remaining POWs.

West offers to demonstrate the reagent and puts a few drops of it onto a microscope slide with dead cat tissue. As Dr. Hill peers through the microscope at this slide, West clobbers him from behind with a shovel, and then decapitates him with it. West then reanimates Dr. Hill's head and body separately.

Motivated by patriotism and an innate desire to prove himself, former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed challenges Drago to an exhibition bout. Rocky has reservations but agrees to help train Apollo for the match.\nDuring a press conference regarding the match, hostility sparks between Apollo's and Drago's respective camps. The boxing exhibition takes place at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. Apollo enters the ring in an over-the-top patriotic entrance with James Brown performing \"Living in America\" complete with showgirls. The bout starts tamely with Apollo landing several punches that are ineffective against Drago, but Drago suddenly retaliates with devastating effects. By the end of the first round, Rocky and Apollo's trainer, Duke, plead with him to stop the match, but Apollo refuses to do so and tells Rocky to not stop the match \"no matter what.\" Drago continues to pummel him in the second round and Duke begs Rocky to throw in the towel.

Drago's camp agrees to an unsanctioned 15-round fight in the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, an arrangement meant to protect Drago from the threats of violence he has been receiving in the United States. Rocky travels to the Soviet Union without his wife Adrian due to her disapproval of the match, setting up his training base in a remote cabin in Krasnogourbinsk with only Duke and Paulie to accompany him. Duke opens up to Rocky, stating that he actually raised Apollo and that his death felt like a father losing his son, and expresses his faith in Rocky that he will emerge victorious. To prepare for the match, Drago uses high-tech equipment, a team of trainers and doctors monitoring his every movement, and regular doses of anabolic steroids. Rocky, on the other hand, does roadwork in deep snow over mountainous terrain and workouts utilizing antiquated farm equipment. Adrian arrives unexpectedly to give Rocky her support, which gives Rocky a new vigor.\nBefore the match begins, Balboa is the first to enter to a hostile crowd. As he waits nervously in the ring, the lights in the arena suddenly go out, and Drago is introduced with an elaborate patriotic ceremony, with the Soviet general secretary and the Politburo in attendance. The home crowd is squarely on Drago's side and hostile to Rocky. In contrast to his match with Apollo, Drago immediately goes on the offensive. Rocky takes a fierce pounding in the first round, but goes on the offensive toward the end of the second round after landing a brutal right hook that cuts Drago's left eye, stunning both Drago and the crowd. Duke encourages Rocky by reminding him that he just proved Drago is a man, and not a machine as he's been made out to be. In contrast, Drago comments to his trainers that Rocky \"is not human, he is like a piece of iron,\" after his trainers reprimand him for his performance against the \"weak\" American.\nThe two boxers spend the next dozen rounds trading blows, with Rocky managing to continually hold his ground despite Drago's best efforts. As the 12th round begins, the previously hostile Soviet crowd suddenly start chanting and cheering for Balboa.

After two previous escape attempts, Manny is put in solitary confinement for three years.  A court order compels sadistic Associate Warden Ranken to release him from solitary. Planning a third break out, Manny is forced to advance his plan to mid-winter after he is stabbed. Manny recruits young prisoner Buck McGeehy to help in the complicated plan. After escaping from the prison via a sewer tunnel that opens out above a freezing river, and an arduous cross-country hike, the two arrive at a switchyard. After stealing some railroad clothing, they hop on board a train, consisting only of four locomotives.\nThe elderly railroad engineer, Al, has a fatal heart attack after starting the train and falls off the lead locomotive. He manages to apply the brakes, but the locomotives overpower them; resulting in the brake shoes burning off. As the unmanned train accelerates, dispatchers Dave Prince and Frank Barstow are alerted to the situation. Barstow allows the train to reach onto the mainline, whilst trying to keep the tracks farther down the line clear. Unfortunately, the runaway smashes the caboose of another train pulling onto a siding. The collision badly damages the cab of the lead locomotive and jams the front door of the second engine, an old inoperable EMD F-unit, or \"A-liner\". The convicts finally realize something is wrong. Barstow's superior Eddie McDonald orders him to intentionally derail the train.\nAt this point, the train's horn blows, alerting the authorities (and the two fugitives) someone else is aboard the train. Barstow has the maintainer cancel the derailment. Ranken concludes his two escaped convicts are fleeing by rail. Meanwhile, the two fugitives are discovered by Sara, a locomotive hostler, who explains she sounded the horn and the train is out of control. She convinces them jumping off the train at its current speed would be suicide while revealing the only possible way to stop the train would be to climb forward onto the lead engine and press its kill switch, a near-impossible feat due to the A-liner's jammed front door and its obsolete rounded streamlined design's having no outside catwalk or handrail like the other three more-modern square-bodied locomotives. They manage to shut down the third and fourth locomotives, nearly derailing on a bridge while doing so.\nThe dispatchers divert the runaway onto a dead-end branch line after determining it is only five minutes away from a head-on collision with a passenger train. Further ahead the train has a tight curve near a chemical plant. Barstow agrees they must crash it, thus condemning all three on board to death, rather than risking a chemical explosion. Ranken forces Barstow to help him reach the train via helicopter. Manny tries forcing Buck into a suicidal scramble around the outside of the second engine's nose. Sara's intervention on Buck's behalf results in an armed face-off. Emotionally broken, all three slump into depression. Ranken's accomplice is lowered from a helicopter to the lead engine, but falls under the train after smashing through its windscreen. \nSpurred on by the appearance of his arch-enemy with an absolute resolve to not be returned to prison, Manny makes a perilous leap to the lead engine. He barely makes it, severely crushing his hand. Ranken boards the locomotive from the helicopter; Manny ambushes and handcuffs him inside the lead engine. Ranken orders Manny to stop the train before it crashes, but Manny has chosen to die rather than be recaptured. When reminded of Buck and Sara in the second engine, Manny uncouples the lead engine from the rest of the train. He waves goodbye without a word (ignoring Buck's screaming pleas to shut down the lead engine), and climbs onto the roof in the freezing snow, with his arms stretched out, accepting his inevitable fate. Buck and Manny's fellow inmates quietly mourn in their cells as the lone engine vanishes into the storm.

On his way out of town, while preparing to change roles to that of a sidekick, Rex explains to Peter that he rides into town, kisses the girls and rides out again. \"That's all: I just kiss 'em.

Recognizing the sword as the 'Sword of Protection', the Sorceress summons Prince Adam and Cringer to Castle Grayskull and sends them through the portal to find the person destined to possess the sword.\nArriving in the other dimensional world of Etheria, Adam and Cringer stop at an inn for lunch and discover that Etheria is ruled by an evil intergalactic army known as the Horde. When some Hordesmen soldiers cause trouble in the inn, Adam stands up to them and defeats them with the help of an archer named Bow, who tells Adam that he and his friend Kowl are members of the 'Great Rebellion'.\nAs word of the fight reaches the Horde's leader Hordak, Bow and Kowl take Adam and Cringer to the Rebellion's base in the Whispering Woods. They meet the other Rebels, including their leader Princess Glimmer, tree people called the Twiggetts, and Madame Razz, the comically inept witch, who arrives on her talking Broom to reveal that the Horde are threatening to enslave the villagers unless the Rebels responsible for the fight in the inn give themselves up, and that some of the Horde's worst villains, including Catra, Mantenna, Leech and Scorpia are there, stacking the odds almost insurmountably against the rebels. Bow is willing to surrender to save the village, but Adam and Glimmer convince the group that they should fight back to save the villagers instead.\nAs the Horde, led by Force Captain Adora, start taking away the villagers, they are attacked by the Rebels, aided by Adam and Cringer in their secret identities as He-Man and Battle Cat. He-Man confronts Adora and the Sword of Protection glows in her presence, revealing that she is the one he's looking for. This distraction allows the Horde to knock He-Man out and capture him.\nMadame Razz uses divination to discover that the Horde have taken He-Man to their prison complex on Beast Island, and the Rebels head there to attempt a rescue. In the prison, Adora interrogates He-Man and agrees that the sword seems to be meant for her, to which He-Man retorts that he is to give it to someone who serves good rather than evil. Adora believes the Rebels are evil and the Horde the rightful, benevolent rulers of Etheria, although she admits to not knowing much about life outside the Horde's base. When He-Man dares her to see for herself what life on Etheria is really like, Adora says she'll think about it. The Rebels arrive on Beast Island and manage to get into the prison to find He-Man, only to get captured and imprisoned themselves. Kowl manages to elude capture and frees He-Man, who then frees the others and destroys the prison. Meanwhile, Adora has ventured into the towns outside the Fright Zone and sees first-hand the cruelties Etheria's citizens are forced to endure at the hands of the Horde.\nAs Hordak and Shadow Weaver discuss how He-Man is a threat too powerful to ignore, they are confronted by Adora wielding the Sword of Protection. She has discovered how cruel the Horde truly are, but Shadow Weaver casts Adora into a mystic sleep that will make her forget what she learned and takes the sword, planning to learn its secrets.\nLater, Hordak shows the Horde his latest weapon: the Magna-Beam, a willpower-fueled transporter that will allow him to send the entire Rebel base into exile forever. However, none of the Horde's captives have sufficient willpower to fully charge the machine. He-Man sneaks into the Horde base looking for Adora, but Adora once again thinks he's the villain and arrests him. Hordak then confines He-Man in the Magna-Beam's energy chamber to charge it overnight.\nLater that night, Adora has nightmares about He-Man's fate and hears a voice calling her name. She discovers the Sorceress talking to her through the Sword of Protection and asking her to help He-Man, whom the Sorceress reveals is Adora's twin brother. After reflecting upon the Sorceress's words, Adora breaks Shadow Weaver's spell then follows the Sorceress's instructions to hold the sword aloft and say \"For the Honour of Grayskull!\" She then transforms into the superpowered She-Ra, Princess of Power. After she rescues and revives He-Man, the pair destroy the Magna-Beam and make their getaway on Adora's horse Spirit, who in She-Ra's presence is transformed into a talking winged unicorn named Swift Wind.\nShe-Ra reveals that she is He-Man's sister, but He-Man is skeptical. When She-Ra explains that she was told by the 'woman in the sword', He-Man uses the Sword of Protection to contact the Sorceress, who confirms and explains their relationship. When Adam and Adora were born to King Randor and Queen Marlena, Eternia was invaded by the Horde.  Unable to defeat the combined might of the Eternian army and the magic of Castle Grayskull, Hordak plotted to demoralize them by kidnapping the newborn royals, aided by his favorite pupil (and He-Man's future archenemy) Skeletor. Although the kidnapping was interrupted by Man-At-Arms, Hordak escaped with Adora and ultimately fled through a Time Gate. The Sorceress was unable to discover which dimension Hordak fled to, so she cast a spell that wiped all memory of Adora from the people of Eternia except for herself, Man-At-Arms, King Randor and Queen Marlena. Thus Adam was raised unaware of his sister's existence. Convinced by the Sorceress's story, He-Man happily accepts She-Ra as his sister.\nReturning to the Rebel camp as Adam and Adora, the Rebellion accept Adora into their ranks after learning that she was mind-controlled into serving the Horde. The Rebels also discover that Queen Angella, rightful ruler of the kingdom of Bright Moon, is being held prisoner on nearby Talon Mountain, so Adam and Adora volunteer to rescue her. As He-Man and She-Ra, they defeat Queen Angella's jailer Hunga the Harpy, free Queen Angella, and reunite her with her people (including her daughter Glimmer).\nAdam takes Adora back to Eternia to reunite with their parents, but Hordak has found out that Adora is with the Rebels and pursues them through the Time Gate. Finding himself back on Eternia, Hordak goes to his old base on Snake Mountain and discovers that Skeletor is now the principal villain of Eternia. Skeletor is not pleased to see his old mentor and engages him in a magical duel. Upon learning that Hordak is after Adora, Skeletor agrees to help him to be rid of him. Magically disguised as cooks and with Hordak hidden inside a giant cake, Skeletor and his henchmen manage to infiltrate the royal palace and kidnap Adora.\nAs Man-At-Arms, Teela and He-Man reassure the distraught king and queen that they will save Adora, Skeletor betrays Hordak and forces him back to Etheria, planning to ransom Adora himself. However, Adora manages to outwit her captors and, reclaiming her sword, deals with the villains as She-Ra before running into the rescue party. As He-Man introduces She-Ra to the others and helps her to convince them that Adora is safe, Skeletor is left bemoaning \"A female He-Man! This is the worst day of my life!\"\nAdora decides to return to Etheria to aid the Rebellion, a decision accepted by her family, and the Sorceress sends Adora and Spirit back to Etheria, telling them they can use the Sword of Protection to summon aid from Eternia should they ever need it. Adam and Cringer tag along, offering to \"help Adora get the Rebellion off to a big start\".\nAs He-Man and She-Ra, the twins help the Rebels liberate Bright Moon, learning more about She-Ra's powers in the process (including using empathy to communicate with the wild animals of the Whispering Woods and healing Swift Wind when he is injured by the Horde).

One day Orin, a young miner, finds a jeweled sword embedded in the rocks. Hopps, grandfather of Orin's girlfriend Elan, recognizes the sword and gives his life to save Orin and keep the sword a secret. When Orin later takes the sword into his hands, it ascends into the air and buries itself in the cavern's floor. A projection of an old man appears from the blade, telling those present that above the caverns is a \"magnificent universe\" that the people may find. The blade then disappears, leaving only the hilt.\nForced to leave Orin's young, blind brother Calli behind, Orin and Elan set out to discover this universe and find the blade to the sword. Chased by Zygon's robots, they emerge in an industrial complex where they meet Zygon, who reveals the face of a human man beneath his mask. Zygon strangles Elan to death, but Orin escapes this fate when Zygon is distracted by the sword hilt. When Zygon's robots accidentally fire on a crystal deposit, Zygon presumes Orin dead in the resultant explosion and cave-in.\nOrin digs a tunnel to the surface of Trinia, where he is later captured by Man-Droids, a group of decaying half-organic, half-robotic beings who intend to tear him apart and use his body parts to replace their own. Unexpectedly, his sword's hilt produces what is apparently an invisible blade, killing two of the Man-Droids and helping Orin escape. Orin subsequently runs into a human smuggler named Dagg Dibrimi, who takes Orin (whom he dubs \"Water Snake\" for his outrageous tale about human slaves in the mines) along on his journey to smuggle crystals. Eventually, Dagg seizes a load of crystals from a hovering freighter, but is driven away by Zygon and his robotic guards. During the fight, Dagg seizes a Fembot named Silica and uses it as a shield from laser blasts. Subsequently, re-programmed by Dagg, Silica becomes attached to him. At the same time a mysterious \"Starfly\" appears and attaches itself to Orin.\nDagg flies his spaceship, the Starchaser, to a city called Toga-Togo on the planet Bordogon, where he abandons Orin and gives Silica to a slave auctioneer. Orin wanders through the city, trying to find a clue that will lead him to the location of the hilt's blade. After meeting a fortune-teller who tells him to visit a place called Novaluna, Orin sees Silica offered for sale, whereupon he offers high prices to buy her. When the auctioneer finds that Orin has no knowledge of local currency, he takes Orin's freedom in addition to Silica's; but Dagg, moved by his own conscience, frees them. Later, Dagg and Orin visit the home of two desert-dwelling merchants, to whom Dagg sells the stolen crystals. Because Zygon has placed a price on Orin's head, the merchants offer to buy Orin as well, but Dagg refuses. In response, the merchants place a time bomb in Dagg's payment. Orin is forewarned by the Starfly, whereupon Dagg and Arthur, the Starchaser's artificial intelligence, throw the bomb into their enemies' camp. Thereafter Dagg agrees to take Orin to Novaluna, but they are shot down by Zygon's robotic soldiers. Dagg is captured and the ship is rendered inactive; Orin is thrown clear out of the ship but is rescued by Aviana, the daughter of Bordogon's Governor.\nUpon waking up and meeting Aviana, Orin tells her his story, whereupon Aviana's computer reveals that the hilt has historically been used by a group of legendary guardians called the Kha-Khan to vanquish threats to humanity. Among these threats was a tyrant called Nexus, after whose defeat the hilt vanished until Orin's discovery of it. Aviana takes Orin to Trinia, where he again faces Zygon. Orin attempts to kill Zygon for Elan's death and thereby exposes him as a robot. Zygon then reveals that he is Nexus, seeking again to rule over humanity with his army of robots. Zygon takes Orin's hilt and begins to co-ordinate the attack, while Orin and Aviana are imprisoned in the cell block wherein Dagg is also captive. Just as Orin and Aviana confess their feelings toward one another, Aviana is taken aboard Zygon's flagship as a hostage. Orin is again approached by the Starfly, who brings him the hilt, which he uses to free himself and Dagg. They enter Zygon's flagship and take control of it, using it (again aided by the Starfly) to destroy the enemy fleet. They are rejoined by Silica, who has restored the Starchaser.\nOrin and his friends penetrate Zygon's base, but are attacked by his remaining troops. While Dagg and Silica stay behind to fight off their pursuers, Orin enters his original cavern home and begins to denounce Zygon, but is interrupted by Zygon himself. They fight, resulting in Orin dangling over a chasm while Zygon gloats over him. As Orin hangs over the chasm, three Starflies appear and merge into one; but instead of giving him the hilt at his request, it states that he has no need of the hilt, adding that \"there never was a blade\". Orin therefore realizes that the power to create a cutting force came from himself. At this, he pulls himself up, generates such a force, and uses it to cut Zygon in half, sending him plummeting to his doom in the lava-filled chasm below. Orin's people subsequently rise in revolt and win their freedom.\nAbove, Silica mistakenly fires a laser blast from the Starchaser into the accumulated crystals, causing them to explode and triggering a chain reaction which threatens to collapse the mines. Orin uses the hilt to open a fissure by which his people ascend to Trinia's surface, where Orin uses his new-found power to heal Calli of his blindness and Dagg, Silica, and Aviana join them. Moments later, several Starflies reveal themselves to be the spirits of the previous Kha-Khan, including the elder man of the hilt's projection. They invite Orin to join them, but he refuses for the time being in favor of living with his friends and family. The other Kha-Khan respect Orin's choice and leave him as they fly into the starry beyond.

After checking out at the office, Walter stops by the local racetrack, where his college-age son Chris  works repairing stock cars. He reminds Chris of his mother's departure for Europe that afternoon, and Chris meets him back at the house to send her off.\nThough their relationship is slightly strained, the family is tightly woven and carry on amicably, although an underlying tension between father and son is hinted at. Before she leaves, Chris' mother asks Walter to \"break through to the kid.\" Walter attempts to bond with Chris over the next few days, Chris staying at the house and going on a fishing trip with Walter.\nThat night, the two are awoken by a late-night phone call from Paris informing Walter that his wife has split from her tour group. Although he downplays it, Walter's fear for his wife's well-being is apparent and Chris picks up on it. Prying further, Chris gets Walter to admit that she has, in fact, been missing for two days. With that, Chris and Walter decide to go to Paris to find her.\nAt the airport, Chris bumps into an attractive backpacker, who introduces herself as Princess Carla, leader of the Sparrow Revolution.\nWalter, on the other hand, bumps into a shady man with a gun who shows Walter his wife's jewelry. A few seconds later, an odd-looking man in glasses points a gun at them and, in an attempt to kill Walter, shoots the man holding him up before disappearing. In a moment of uncharacteristic bravado, Walter kicks the dead man's gun under a jacket and scoops it up before anyone can notice. When Chris asks what's going on, Walter replies that it's probably a heart attack.\nAt the hotel, Walter writes a note telling Chris to stay for any messages, then leaves for the American embassy in Paris. Once there, Walter slides through the embassy with a casual, cavalier attitude, stopping to look at security while taking a drink at a fountain. He walks casually into the office coffee room, where he pours ketchup into a bag with a handkerchief, pretending it's evidence, and waltzes into the head office under the guise of working there. He tells the secretary that her boss is \"family,\" and once inside the office, tells her boss that his wife has been kidnapped, and that \"Duke is here\".\nWalter regroups with Chris at the hotel restaurant, where he tells him that his mother has been kidnapped, and tells him the real story about the shooting at the airport. Chris' reaction, as to be expected, is one of frustration and disbelief. At that point, the embassy's Director Barney Taber enters and Walter (whom Taber calls \"Duke\") and he embrace. He alludes to having seen Chris when he was a baby, and expresses sadness at his mother's kidnapping. Chris begins to tell Taber what's going on, but Walter covers up the conversation by telling him that he and Chris had been talking about something else. Before he leaves, Taber asks Walter what name he's traveling under.\nA waiter enters with a call for Walter in the office, which the presumably-simple Walter fields in flawless French. After a brief conversation, Walter heads out of the hotel, telling Chris to stay there. Fortunately for Walter, Chris follows him, and saves his life when a car sprays gunshots at Walter. They run away to escape, ducking into an alley where Walter confesses to Chris that he used to work for the CIA. Chris asks him if he's ever killed someone, and Walter downplays the question. Chris, disturbed that his father's life is a lie, runs off, although the two catch up with each other in a caf\u00e9.\nWalter tells him about his own history, working as a journalist in France when an agent \"tuned into him\" at a party. Walter began working for the CIA, performing a variety of duties, but he gave it up when he met his wife and their son was born. A suspicious-looking man enters, and Walter pulls a gun on him, and they leave. Chris tells him that he's going to the police and Taber. Walter tells him it was for his benefit - that Taber is in fact working for the CIA.\nThe two go to Taber, where they find that another agent, Clay, has been tailing him. Clay and Taber tell them to hole up in their hotel, a piece of advice that Chris and Walter promptly disregard.  Walter decides it's best to look up an old contact of his, a German operative named Lise. They rent a car, Chris making a crack about Walter's driving speed; \"Here we go to Hamburg, twenty miles an hour...\"\nThe two make their way slowly to Paris until Walter spots a tail on them, at which point he takes off in high gear. Walter weaves expertly through the countryside, shaking the tail at extremely high speeds. When the two lay a trap for the tail, they find out that they're being watched by the CIA to make sure they don't get into trouble. Walter tells him to pull the tail off, warning that if he sees him again, he \"won't see him again\".\nAfter buying some clothes, the two leave for Hamburg by train. The agent tailing the Lloyds reports to Taber with a paltry two digits of a phone number that Walter dialed, (4-0). Taber is understandably upset, and sends him out of the office.\nAt the train station, Walter and Chris see a man approach a similar pair - a young man and his father - yelling \"Mendelssohn\" to them. After spotting the Lloyds, the man grabs a fiddle from a nearby busker and begins playing a well-known Felix Mendelssohn tune. The two laugh it off as they walk away, although it's apparent that Walter makes more of it than Chris does. On the way out, Chris spots the backpacker he met at the airport in Paris.\nThey arrive at Lise's, where a history between Walter and Lise is hinted at. Lise helps the two get settled, and while Chris sleeps, the two reminisce about their days in the trade. Lise calls Walter her \"Dear Duke,\" and recalls having loved him. At this point, Chris wakes up and listens to the two talking about what could have been, had they not chosen a life of intrigue and mystery. Lise asks Walter about his Donna, who Walter insinuates was completely worth giving up his life for.\nThe next day, Lise sends Walter and Chris off to meet \"The Colonel\", Walter's old boss. Chris spots the fiddle player from the train station, and Walter tears off in the car. They attempt to lose their pursuers, but when they can't, Walter takes off on foot with Chris presumably driving to meet the Colonel. When Chris spots the assassin who attempted to kill Walter earlier, he sticks around, driving through the port they've stopped by to rescue his father. Cornered by the two undercover agents, Walter jumps off the pier onto a passing ferry. The two agents hum the same tune to Walter, and point for him to meet them further up the channel. The eyeglass-wearing assassin attempts to kill Walter, but ultimately only kills one of the agents attempting to catch up with Walter. Chris picks Walter up and the two drive to the Colonel's.\nOnce at the Colonel's, Walter asks him about the man at the airport - Heinz Henke. They recall \"Operation Clean Sweep\", where they killed five of six agents. The Colonel recalls something about a family, the family of the agent Clean Sweep didn't kill. The Colonel asks them what happened at the train station, and Walter tells him about the fiddle player. When he hums the tune, the Colonel recognizes it as from the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto, whereupon Walter recalls that \"Mendelssohn\" was the codename of the sixth agent who escaped \"Operation Clean Sweep\"; that agent was also known as Schroeder.\nLater that night, Walter leaves for West Berlin, to the Marie-Louise Pension, leaving Chris in the care of Lise. Chris has a moment of honesty with Lise, who tells him about her desire to be with Walter, to have a son like Chris. Chris then leaves on a train to Frankfurt, where he'll presumably be safe with a contact of Lise's.\nIn the following scene, the assassin visits the Colonel, who tortures the emphysema-ridden Colonel for the Lloyds' location by depriving him of oxygen. Though the Colonel does not give them up, his caretaker does, and the assassin kills both of them. \nAt the train station, Chris spots Carla, who's headed to Berlin to stay with friends. The two have an exchange, and Chris decides to surprise Carla by changing his travel plans to Berlin. Once in Berlin, Chris stays with Carla and the two make love. The next morning, Chris tells Carla he has to leave to find his father; she says she'll wait for him in bed.\nLise contacts Walter, informing him that \"his old military friend has died...\" painfully. She tells him he has been exposed, and the package he mailed to Frankfurt (referring to Chris), has not arrived. Lise warns him to be careful, before she says a tearful goodbye and embarks on a boat. While he's shaving at the pension, Walter hears a knock at the door. Suspicious, he pulls his gun and approaches the door, but to his surprise, it's Chris. He tearfully exclaims that he could've killed him, hugging him tightly and dropping the gun. Frustrated that Chris has met up with him, he fills Chris in on his plans. The two bond shortly thereafter, however, and Walter sends Chris out after a short briefing on Agency tradecraft to keep watch at a caf\u00e9 near the pension.\nTheir plan is disrupted, however, when Carla appears at the caf\u00e9. Chris asks her how she found him, and she tells him she followed him out of jealousy. Through the window, Walter spots Chris talking to her, and gives a frustrated shrug. When Chris spots the assassin, he moves to signal his father with a newspaper, but Carla pulls a gun on him and forces him to stay put, which shocks the unsuspecting Chris. The assassin moves up to kill Walter; Chris unable to warn him. The assassin enters the apartment, but Walter suspects a setup and gets the drop on him, shooting the assassin dead. After the gunshot is fired, the customers direct their attention to the window, and Chris uses the opportunity to slug Carla in the face. He runs upstairs to his father, and the two flee.\nThat night, after ditching the gun in a river, Walter says goodbye to Chris before heading into East Berlin. Though Chris is scared he'll never see his father again, he follows his orders and heads to the US Embassy in Berlin. Walter warns him that the CIA will be crawling all over the place, and tells Chris to tell them nothing. Once through the border in East Berlin, Walter is picked up by a motorcycle courier who takes him to a small farm in the country to meet with Schroeder. Schroeder is at first cryptic, leaving Walter guessing as to what his desire is. Walter goes down the list of possible motives - information, of which he has none; money, which he can raise. Schroeder beckons him over to get a closer look at him, and after a closer look, proclaims \"this is the murderer of children...\"\nChris, at this point, has come back into Taber's custody, where the CIA pumps him for information. Chris gives them none, much to the frustration of Clay and the other agents.\nBack at Schroeder's farm, the two men look on at the gravestones of Schroeder's family. Schroeder grimly tells Walter of the deaths of his family, a wife and two teenage children murdered in cold blood because the CIA failed to arrest Schroeder himself. Walter denies being responsible for their deaths. He even investigated the tragedy but all his people were cleared. Walter then quit, finding the promise of raising a family more appealing than a life of espionage. Though Schroeder doesn't believe his story, Walter convinces him that there's another party involved. He tells him about the assassin, of a group who's been trying to kill him since he arrived in Europe who may have \"walked in both camps.\"\nIn Taber's office, Chris is contacted by his father, who updates him on the situation and tells him to head to an abandoned air force base where the CIA used to exchange captured agents with the East. Though he leaves Taber's office and proceeds alone to East Berlin, Taber and Clay catch up with him and Walter. While Walter and Taber talk, Chris walks over to the hangar nearby where he finds his mother bound and gagged, wrapped in plastic explosives.\nWalter and Clay manage to defuse the bomb, at which point Taber is revealed as the double agent who betrayed both Schroeder and Walter when he pulls a gun on Walter and shoots Clay. He forces the Lloyds to kneel, but Walter gets the jump on him when Schroeder reappears. Though he denies it, it's deduced that Taber was responsible for the death of Schroeder's family, and Schroeder's bodyguard straps Taber to the chair rigged with explosives. An angry and distraught Schroeder, finally faced with the man responsible for the death of his son, his daughter, and his wife, sends Walter and Chris away with Donna in tow before blowing himself and Taber up.\nThe family, reunited, embrace as the hangar erupts in a massive explosion.

The adjutant goes on to explain that most of them were communists, among whom he shows Martin Alushi (Timo Flloko), who has translated Marx's works and is interned in the north of Albania under the supervision of a local prince. Next, the three main religious leaders of Albania get called in. A pack of Camel cigarettes and a photo of the Albanian King Zog is shown on a table, while the adjutant seeks the leaders' support for the King's policies. After them Besian Vorpsi gets received in. The adjutant demands Besian as an influential writer, to go to the north and assure the local prince of the King's support and inviolability of the Kanun. Besian is firstly reluctant to obey since he is getting married in few days, but the adjutant convinces him to spend the honeymoon there and simultaneously do the job.\nCouples are shown dancing under a dim light and Siegfried's Funeral March of Wagner\u2019s G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung is playing in the background. Besian Vorpsi declares that he and his wife Diana (Rajmonda Bulku) will spend their honeymoon in the northern highlands. Cezar, a Besian's colleague, calls him out on his decision implying that Besian is being politically used in going somewhere that he had himself previously dubbed as the \"territories of death\". A quiet talk for the upcoming trip follows between the couple in their bedroom. Besian talks about the customs in the north and persuades Diana to come with him and enjoy the beauties of that region. Eventually the couple sets out on the journey to the north of Albania in a horse-drawn carriage. On the way, Besian shows to Diana a highlander with his typical costume and a black armband. He explains with admiration to her that the piece of cloth is a symbol that he either has to \"take blood\" (revenge) or is a target to be killed.\nGjorg Berisha (Piro Qirjo), is waiting in an ambush near the road with his riffle. After the carriage leaves behind, Gjorg takes aim at an approaching man passing by. At first he hesitates and sighs, then aims again at his target and shoots the man. The couple hears the shooting too. The next moment Gjorg goes to see his victim. Shocked by what he has done he runs away and tells about his killing to the first men he sees so that they can turn his victim right, according to the tradition. Then he runs into Martin Alushi and tells him the same thing. The couple arrives to a guesthouse at night. Next morning Gjorg wakes up, goes to his sheep and plays the flute. He contemplates to his sister about this custom of revenge, calling the killing as horrible and saying that attending the funeral of his victim and the lunch after it is meaningless and unbearable. Meanwhile the couple is having breakfast and Besian notices through his binoculars how in the neighbouring tower, they are washing the blood from the old victim's shirt (Gjorg's brother) since he now was vindicated, while on the other tower they are raising the new bloodshed shirt (Gjorg's victim) as a symbol for an upcoming revenge. Church bells are heard to signal the funeral. The couple sees from the distance how both the victim's and the killer's father attend the funeral in silence, while the killer is also with them. \nAfter the funeral, Gjorg and his father have a short talk at home. His father gives him a sack of money, so he can pay the \"blood tax\" (money paid for 1 month truce) to the prince.\nThe couple stops for a coffee at a guesthouse near a church. In the same place, Gjorg has a short break. Before he resumes his walk, Diana sees him and secretly takes a photo of him. They continue the trip in the carriage, where Besian rebukes her for taking that shot, but quickly forgets about it as they see again Gjorg walking along the way. Near the road, two gendarmes are dragging down a man for being indebted with a local Bajraktar. Martin Alushi tries to intervene but is pushed away by the gendarmes. Besian stops the carriage and gets out. He recognizes Martin and doesn't speak. This infuriates Martin who knows the writer and calls his silence and his trip a shame.  \nIn the evening, Gjorg arrives in the prince's tower, followed by the couple. While Besian and Diana are welcomed by the prince (Mario Ashiku) dressed in local costume, Gjorg and the other men who had killed for blood feud are waiting in a room to pay the \"blood tax\". Mark Uka\u00e7jerra (Reshat Arbana) who is the blood feud\u2019s reeve, summons Gjorg and fills his name on a list. Gjorg gives the money and Mark tells him he has one month truce (6 March \u2013 6 April). The prince, now wearing a tuxedo, receives the couple with a lavish dinner. He talks about the Kanun and Gjakmarrja. The prince and Mark complain about the diminishing blood feuds. Diana asks if they earn money from these blood feuds, and her husband looks at her angrily. The prince replies that the Kanun is a thousand year old, and neither did he invent it or earn from it, but he only guards it. When alone together, the prince makes Mark guilty of the diminishing income since people are giving up on the blood feud. Late at night Besian wakes up, leaves the room and goes to talk to the prince. His wife is worried and goes to look for him. Besian tells the prince that the King esteems his power in the north of the country and supports him, without wanting to interfere in the prince's local authority and the Kanun. On the other hand, the prince appreciates Besian's writings and visit and shows him gratitude.\nThe next morning in the carriage, Diana confronts Besian on why he didn't come to her at night and that he is hiding something to her. She looks at him doubtfully and they leave in silence with the carriage. While travelling, the couple assists a property dispute and the curious Besian and his wife get closer. A geometer approaches Besian and tells him to write about the difficult life they live in, without having the right to exercise their professions and dubbing all that as a \"tragicomedy\".\nGjorg is counting his remaining days of freedom. He decides to go up the mountains during his remaining days. His father hands him 2 bullets while his sister ties him the black armband and gives him the flute. On his way, Gjorg runs into Mark Uka\u00e7jerra. Mark tells that he would forgive Gjorg's blood feud and spare his life if he kills a King's enemy, the interned man. Gjorg shakes his head for no and leaves in silence. Along the way he notices a traditional wedding moment and imagines if he was the groom instead. In the carriage, Besian tells to Diana he will go to meet a local leader while she can wander and photograph around. Diana gets into a poor house in miserable conditions where the housewife complains the authorities have jailed her husband. In the carriage Diana talks about her bad impressions inside the tower and recalls a poem of Migjeni. On his way, Gjorg has a friendly encountering with Martin and two highlanders. But they all stand up and leave when Mark approaches.  \nMartin meets his wife who has come from Tirana. She talks about politics, that Italy has sent an ultimatum to Albania and that the fascists may be disembarking unexpectedly. She tells him that the people have no trust in the Kingdom's army anymore. Their meeting is short because a gendarme is waiting for them.\nOn the way back, Besian and Diana's carriage sees that Cezar is a new convicted. He is tied and guarded by three gendarmes, what doesn't impede him from speaking angrily and feeling revolted at Besian. Meantime Mark Uka\u00e7jerra meets a traditional judge of Kanun, asking him a false judgement, but he denies. \nBesian stops the carriage and together with Diana goes to meet a doctor he recognizes. He had studied in Austria for microbiology. After coming back to Albania he had made a study to eradicate malaria, but was treated as a madman for his requests and sent to the north. He goes on to explain Besian that now he serves as a type of judge who has to check and decide upon the wounds of a killed man on blood feud, so as each wound on the body is paid differently. A fierce argument starts between them and Diana leaves and hides away. After Besian finds her, Diana accuses him of playing the deaf and blind in this tragedy.\nIn the next scene, Martin goes to cut timber. While he is cutting down a poplar tree with an axe, Mark hidden on the ground shoots at him. Gjorg Berisha is wandering nearby and upon hearing the shot, runs at Martin, asking who shot.\nThe dying Martin replies that the King and the Tower shot at him, but this order will collapse and then everything will be different. Hearing the shot, several men approach the scene. Gjorg tells that there is no greater shame than to shoot behind the back of an innocent who was not even from there, declaring that the King, the prince and Mark Uka\u00e7jerra shot him, opening up about the later's promise to spare his life if he would shoot at Martin. When the group leaves, a boy reads aloud one of Martin's papers \"The King is disarming the people and is selling the country to the foreigners\".\nThe next day Gjorg is wandering on a plain and turns up his head to see a passing airplane. A gunshot is heard and he falls to the ground with arms wide open. Sometime after the shot, Besian and Diana's carriage happen to drive close to him and they stop in silence to see his dead body. More airplanes are heard to fly above them. On the late afternoon they stop at a government office to call the Royal court in Tirana but nobody replies. Then the carriage gets ambushed by a group of armed highlanders, who assumed the king and the queen were inside. Realizing it is not them, they leave. Besian asks a gendarme who reveals that the King has left the country and the kingdom is falling down. After the carriage leaves, he takes off the uniform and ties a reddish scarf around the neck, a symbol of the Partisans\u2019 Resistance. As the carriage continues, a long line of armed highlanders are marching. \"Albania is attacked by an enemy. The feuds are closed.\" \u2015 two of them say.

They have spent most of their respective lives taking care of each other as both of their parents are deceased. Terry, while off duty, rushes from a neighborhood bar into an apartment fire to rescue a young girl, when firefighters inadvertently aim the fire hose at him. The force of the stream pushes Terry, with the child in his arms, through a window and some four stories down, landing flat on his back on the roof of a parked car. The girl is uninjured, but Terry is seriously hurt.\nSix months later, and after countless rejections from welfare, workers' compensation and others, Jimmy goes to City Hall with the letters to show to Mayor John J. Tyler (Robert Culp). But when Tyler rebukes him, calling Terry a drunk, Jimmy promptly sneaks into Tyler's office and pastes all the letters on the office walls while security is diverted by a fire set in a nearby bathroom.\nBelieving Terry was behind the vandalism (as Terry's name was on all the letters), the police, led by Lieutenant Ryan (Peter Boyle), Tyler's chief security officer, come to Hooly's, the brothers' hangout, to arrest Terry. When Terry, drunk and high on pills, takes a swing at Ryan, he roughs Terry up while Jimmy is clubbed by another officer when he tries to help. While posting Terry's bail at the police station, Jimmy meets Danielle \"Danny\" Boudreau (Kim Cattrall), a social worker assigned to Terry's case; she tells Jimmy that Terry is hospitalized in a body cast after a suicide attempt.\nJimmy goes to Battery Park to again confront Mayor Tyler at his anti-graffiti speech, but is pushed away by police. After seeing Tyler unveil a giant apple, which slowly revolves to show handiwork by vandals saying \"Zimmerman Flew, Tyler Knew\" to the delight of protesters at the speech, Jimmy is inspired to start a campaign of his own.\nEarlier, the Daily News ran a story about Tom Zimmerman, the city's former public works commissioner, who had fled the country to avoid trial for an unspecified crime. The report implies that Tyler not only knew of Zimmerman's fleeing, but masterminded it, referring to Tyler's ordering a continuation of Zimmerman's trial until after the upcoming election; Tyler denies all knowledge and responsibility.\nArmed with this knowledge, Jimmy, adopting the alter ego of \"Turk 182\", begins his personal battle of wits with the mayor by, among other things, leaving his mark on a supposedly graffiti-proof subway car to be used by Tyler in an anti-vandalism campaign; surreptitiously exchanging an airplane banner ad for one that says \"Tyler Knew! Turk 182!\"; and hacking into a scoreboard computer (with a friend's help) at Giants Stadium during halftime of a football game at which Tyler and New York's governor make an appearance.\nJimmy's goal to embarrass Mayor Tyler broadens to the point where \"Turk 182\" begins leaving his mark in numerous places, capturing the imagination of the city's entire population, most of whom revere Turk as a hero. But Jimmy soon develops an ulterior motive for his actions: impressing Danny. When Jimmy and Danny return to his apartment after the Giants game, Jimmy goes back out for pizza, and Danny explores the brothers' apartment. Looking through photo albums in their keepsake trunk, she finds an award for Terry with a nameplate on the front bearing Terry's nickname \"Turk\". When she finds Terry's fireman's cap with badge number 182 on it, she realizes that Jimmy is \"Turk 182\". Jimmy returns to find a thoroughly impressed Danny waiting for him in his bed, and the two engage in sexual intercourse.\nPolice Detective Kowalski (Darren McGavin) opens up a case file on \"Turk 182\", while Jimmy pleads guilty to papering the Mayor's office and is given a nominal fine. When Jimmy and Danny visit Terry in the hospital, Terry tells Jimmy that he's going to try to kill himself again when he is cut out of his body cast.\nAfter spotting Kowalski and Ryan waiting outside his apartment, Jimmy decides to reveal himself as Turk.  But when he and Danny arrive at the Daily News Building they find themselves waiting in line behind several other crank characters all claiming to be Turk. Just as Jimmy leaves in exasperation he is intercepted by a TV reporter who suggests that if Jimmy is the real Turk, he should give an interview on camera. On the evening news, a reporter reveals Jimmy as \"Turk 182\", but describes him as a disgruntled civil servant seeking a pension. Angered that the interview was not aired and he is being called a \"nut case\", Jimmy decides to put Turk to rest once and for all, but he tells no one, not even Danny, what his final act will be.\nMayor Tyler appears at a dedication ceremony for the 75th anniversary of the Queensboro Bridge. Ryan, his job now on the line after the Giants Stadium debacle, clamps down security on and around the bridge in preparation of the ceremony. With all local media on hand, the mayor throws the switch lighting up the bridge sign. The lettering on the bridge, which is supposed to say \"Queensboro 1909 1984\", instead reads gibberish; Jimmy, disguised in an electrical worker uniform, is up on the scaffolding rearranging the words.\nAll hell breaks loose when spotlights and cameras catch Jimmy on the rigging; TV stations break into regular programming to cover the incident live, and the rally crowd, aroused by Turk's presence, begin chanting \"Turk! Turk!\" much to Tyler's mortification. Ryan dispatches all police to climb up in the scaffolding to catch Jimmy, but they cannot reach him because he greased all the bridge's lower girders.\nAt the hospital, Danny and Kowalski are with Terry when a group of patients barge in with a TV tuned to one of the channels showing Jimmy on the bridge. The news anchor then shows Jimmy's interview at the Daily News. Now focusing on his brother's safety instead of his own troubles, Terry, Danny, and Kowalski go to the Queensboro Bridge to get Jimmy down.  Tyler also catches a part of Jimmy's interview; seeing it was \"that kid\", Tyler can only turn away from the TV in total defeat.\nStill frustrated in efforts to stop Jimmy, Ryan goes to the bridge power house and orders the sign turned off.  But when the foreman, citing union and safety issues, refuses, Ryan draws his gun and shoots out the controls and knocking the power off.  After Ryan leaves, the foreman turns on the auxiliary power. Undaunted, Ryan climbs aboard an industrial forklift and, when in range, opens fire on Jimmy himself. Kowalski, having arrived with Danny and Terry moments earlier, goes to the lift and disables the hydraulics, knocking Ryan unconscious. Jimmy, now unhindered, completes his task, and reconnects the power to the 25-foot-high letters which now read \"TURK 182\", all to the wild cheering of the crowd and the TV audience.\nAmid the cheering, Tyler says to Deputy Mayor Hanley, \"As soon as [Jimmy] gets down we're gonna find him and tell him we've been rooting for him the whole time!\"", "tmdb_plot": "After New York City firefighter Terry Lynch is unable to receive any compensation for an injury incurred during the off-duty rescue of a young girl, he grows suicidal.

Infected from Count Lee's bite, she hires D to kill the vampire and save her from becoming one. While in town with D and her younger brother Dan, Doris is confronted by Greco Rohman, the mayor's son, who offers to help if he has Doris for himself, but she refuses. D requests that the authorities, including Greco's father, the town sheriff, and Dr. Ferringo, should hold off Doris' incarceration at the local asylum until he kills Count Lee.\nThat night, Doris's farm is attacked by Rei Ginsei, Count Lee's servant, and L'Armica, Count Lee's daughter, who is highly prejudiced against humans.

One evening, she invites married friends for a dinner party, only to have some terrible repressions and past traumas dredged up when guest John Morgan expresses his emotional pain. The strange young man arrives at Jean's cottage the next morning with a gift of pheasants. While sitting at the kitchen table waiting for tea, he puts the barrel of a gun in his mouth and kills himself.\nFrom this point onward, the film's story is told in chronologically discrete, interlocking flashbacks to the recent and distant past, showing actions and events as seen and experienced from various points of view. The central mystery of Morgan's suicide is the fulcrum around which the narrative turns. The narrative construction of the film resembles a jigsaw puzzle and, in keeping with Hare's style of exposition, frequently appears to have key pieces missing.\nThere are further scenes of the dinner party as well as scenes of the police investigation into the suicide. We learn Morgan had not been an invited guest\u2014he walked in with others who assumed he was an acquaintance of Jean's, and Jean assumed that her friends had brought him with them.\nAn aloof and peculiar young woman named Karen Creasy\u2014a former acquaintance of Morgan's\u2014is delivered from the funeral to Jean's doorstep by Mike Langdon, one of the policemen conducting the inquest. For several weeks after, the girl insinuates herself into Jean's life and home and shows no intention of leaving. Sullen and self-centred, Karen is curiously unmoved by Morgan's death and is even hostile to his memory. It is later shown in flashbacks that Morgan had developed an obsession with Karen when they were both students at the University of Essex, and she had violently rebuffed his desperate attempt to initiate a relationship with her. It is implied this rejection may have been a factor in his decision to leave Essex for Yorkshire with the intention of committing suicide.\nWhen Jean suggests to Karen that she may have been responsible for Morgan's decision to kill himself, the young woman angrily denies that her behaviour was, or is, in any way provocative. Karen makes it clear that she hates emotional involvements\u2014what she harshly describes as \"people digging into each other\"\u2014and likewise resents Jean's attempt to engage her in a close relationship. In a sudden fit of pique, Karen quits Jean's home and Wetherby for good. But before leaving, she cruelly taunts Jean by remarking that, if Morgan's suicide wasn't merely an accident, then she would love to know what possible role the spinster played in causing it.\nIn addition to the events occurring in the present day, there are flashbacks of Jean and her lifelong friend, Marcia, as teenagers in 1953. These scenes reveal Jean had been engaged to airman, Jim Mortimer, and that she failed to stop him from going away on active service in southeast Asia. In a brutal twist of fate, Jim was senselessly murdered in a gambling den during the anti-imperial uprisings in British Malaya.\nAs these episodes from the past and present criss-cross and overlap, Jean begins to understand the dull resentment and lonely despair that drove Morgan to take his life. She also seems to gain some insight into the restlessness and self-destructive impulses of the younger generation. In a related incident, she tries to get one of her female students to see the value of continuing her education (At the end of the film, Jean is told that the girl has dropped out of the Sixth Form to run away to London, presumably with a boyfriend).\nJean is likewise affected by the diminished hopes of her contemporaries, who bemoan the state of the country under Thatcherism. She regularly discusses these current matters with Stanley Pilborough, Marcia's husband and the town solicitor, who is often purposefully drunk. She observes the unhappy marriages of her middle-aged friends, particularly the endless bickering that goes on between Roger and Verity Braithwaite. Even lonely, despondent Mike Langdon confesses the failure of his relationship with his mistress, Chrissie, who eventually leaves him to return to her sheep farmer husband.\nIn the end, it seems that Jean no longer needs to mourn for the life she might have had, and the person she might have become, had she not allowed her fianc\u00e9 to make his fatal departure for Malaya three decades earlier.

He then stops the car and kills the hitchhiker. The sheriff and Doc are called to the hardware store where a young woman was found nailed behind the store. Minutes later, they are called to the road outside of town where the hitchhiker was nailed to the concrete in the middle of the road.\nMaxine, John and Tom are eating at a diner where she reveals Old Bailey let them stay in a house for free because someone was murdered there.

When they go back into the partially constructed house, the killer shoots one in the head. The killer, speaking with a distorted voice, tells the other carpenter to think back six months ago. When the carpenter mentions the raping, the killer kills him. The killer then murders a couple making out on the hood of their car, and a family man in a suburban house.\nAfter following various leads, the Sheriff eventually realizes six of the victims worked at a construction site. Six month ago, Linda Jenkins, now established to be Bubba's sister, was raped after delivering supplies at the site. The six rapists walked away thanks to the lack of evidence. That evening, two women walking in the nearby woods are attacked and killed.\nThe next morning, Doc calls Linda and asks to speak to Bubba, but she hangs up. Doc drives over to the lumber yard and confronts Linda, who tells him Bubba is out driving his hearse. Doc and Linda drive along the road and find the hearse and give chase. Soon, the sheriff joins them and the chases lead to a textile factory. The killer exits the car and runs, pursued by Sheriff and Doc.

Disgusted with what they see as an omnipresent culture of vulgar and vapid suburban consumerism, they spend their days slacking off and committing pranks and outright crimes victimizing their nemeses, the Schwab family. The patriarch of the Schwab family, Randall Schwab, is a wealthy regional insurance salesman responsible for the involuntary commitment of O.C.'s grandfather into a group home. An extreme social conservative, Randall is blinded by greed, ideology, and plain stupidity to his wife Elinore's chronic alcoholism, his daughter Lenore's complicated relationship with business associate Frankie Tang, and the stunted emotional maturation of his son Randall Jr.\nThe majority of the film is presented as a frame story, narrated by O.C. and Stiggs to President of Gabon Omar Bongo. In it, they loosely retell the story of their ultimate revenge against the Schwab clan, which they had to accomplish before the summer's end forced O.C.'s grandfather to relinquish custody of O.C. to out-of-state relatives. O.C. and Stiggs' first major plan is to ruin Lenore and Frankie's wedding. They acquire an Uzi from deranged Vietnam veteran Sponson and modify a barely-functioning Studebaker Champion into an irregular, hydraulically-suspended car they call the \"Gila Monster.\" Crashing the wedding, they convince Randall Jr. to fire the gun wildly into the wedding presents, cake, and a chandelier. O.C. strikes up a romantic friendship with fellow high school student Michelle.\nO.C. and Stiggs' next plot involves the participation of African pop band King Sunny Ad\u00e9 and His African Beats; the two, along with their friend Barney, raft and walk their way to a Mexican fiesta, where they hire Ad\u00e9 (and also find the time to terrorize their drama teacher Garth for his homosexuality). Exhausted by his relentless commitment to juvenile pranks and stunts, Michelle stops seeing O.C. Later, O.C. and Stiggs connect with women's clothing magnate Pat Colletti, to whom they give marketing advice for his latest slumping fashion line. After finding their friend and drinking buddy Wino Bob (who had participated in other pranks targeting the Schwabs) dead, the two resolve to avenge the Schwabs' supposed abuse of the man. They sabotage a kitschy dinner theater performance (directed by Garth) which the Schwabs are attending by substituting Ad\u00e9's band for the performers. The Schwabs convulse in horror at the unfamiliar music, which is otherwise warmly received.\nO.C. and Stiggs finally launch their master plan of revenge against the Schwabs. They infiltrate the Schwab family home while the Schwabs are away and turn it into a homeless shelter. In the process, they also discover an elaborate doomsday bunker under the house, filled with guns, fireworks, and videotapes featuring the political messages of ultraconservative politician Hal Phillip Walker. When the Schwabs return, chaos breaks out as O.C. and Stiggs engage in an underground gunfight with Randall. They are saved by Sponson, who rescues them by helicopter, grabbing Randall and dropping him in a lake in the process. O.C. is happily reunited with Michelle, and the two retire to her bedroom.\nAt the end of the summer, Colletti informs O.C. and Stiggs that his fashion line has become wildly successful and pays them the first in a series of large royalty checks, which the two use to hire a 24-hour nurse for O.C.'s grandfather (allowing O.C. to remain in Phoenix).
