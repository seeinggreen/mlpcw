Devi has a vision of her sister Rama (Moon Moon Sen) being murdered. Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions, but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in her mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home, where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out.\nDevi sees a wall in the mansion and tears it down, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: as Rama had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: several such necklaces are available.\nDevi gets premonition of another woman getting murdered. She also pinpoints two details: a magazine named Priya with a horse on its cover and a video cassette labelled 100 Days. Sunil and Devi visit the weekly magazine office. The editor (Shashi Kiran) politely informs them that the next six months' covers do not feature any equestrian theme whatsoever. The video cassette clue, too, is a dead end: no video store in Bombay carries any such title as '100 days'. Devi begins delving into Rama's life. She learns that Rama was a research scholar and was working on a thesis about ancient sculptures and temples in India. A quick investigation by Devi during a visit to the Bombay Museum reveals that many artifacts listed by Rama either had mysteriously disappeared, got stolen or were replaced by fakes. She also learns that two people working in the museum, Security Officer Jagmohan (Jai Kalgutkar) and Record Keeper Parvati (Neelam Mehra), were fired on suspicion. Parvati is revealed to be the new victim of Devi's visions.\nJagmohan is a hot-headed man. Parvati knows Rama's killer and had videotaped the murder. She tries to blackmail the murderer, but the murderer tries to kill her. She sneaks into a video library, sticks a label '100 days' on the cassette and tries to escape. But Jagmohan succeeds in killing her, just as Devi had seen. Later, due to some last minute developments, the weekly magazine 'Priya' prints an issue with a horse on its cover. Devi soon realizes that Parvati has been murdered. She goes to the video library and retrieves the video cassette. Jagmohan tries to kill her, but her luck prevails and she escapes. She comes back into the mansion, where she gets a vision of herself in an injured state and a broken mirror in the mansion. She tells Ram about the developments and sits with him to watch the video cassette. Ram has no idea about the cassette's contents are.\nHowever, as the video cassette is being played, Devi gets another shock: she sees her sister Rama confronting Ram. Based on the evidence in the video cassette, it becomes clear that Ram is the murderer. Devi tells him that she is pregnant with his child. Ram offers to explain. Ram tells that he was from an affluent family, but his father lost all his wealth due to gambling and eventually died. When Ram sought financial help from his relatives, they spurned his requests, leaving him helplessly alone. Consequently, he took to illegal ways of earning money. He ran into Jagmohan and Parvati. Later, the trio became partners and started smuggling the artifacts from museums and replaced them with fakes. Rama suspected it and decided to expose them. That night, Ram went to talk to Rama. But Jagmohan, who was also there, lost his temper and shot her dead. Parvati was secretly taping the incident, but due to her camera's angle, it looked as if Ram was the killer. Ram offers to surrender to police and phones them. He confesses his crime and asks them to come to his place.\nNo sooner has he stopped talking, when Jagmohan stabs him in his back. Ram loses consciousness, while Devi fights with Jagmohan. In this unequal fight, Devi is overpowered and rendered unconscious after being hit on her forehead by a conch hurled at her by Jagmohan. Then, Jagmohan buries her alive in the same wall where he had buried Rama. Just as he is about to escape, he sees Sunil coming in. Jagmohan hides while Sunil is surprised to see the mansion open with nobody in it. Just then, Devi's wrist watch alarm chimes. Sunil is surprised to hear the sound coming from behind the wall and puts two and two together. He starts removing the bricks of freshly constructed wall, when Jagmohan suddenly attacks him. However, Sunil puts up a good fight and is able to defeat him. Ram wakes up too and goes towards the wall to remove the bricks and manages to remove the unconscious Devi from the wall. Sunil soon overpowers Jagmohan and dumps him into the swimming pool.\nThe police arrive at the scene. Sunil is surprised to see Ram being arrested as well.

Meanwhile, Tiger's girlfriend, Miss Kitty, leaves him to find a new life out west, remarking that perhaps she is looking for \"a cat that's more like a dog\".\nA British aristocratic cat named Cat R. Waul launches an attack on the mice, forcing them to flee into the sewers. There, they come across a cowboy mouse, who is in fact a marionette controlled by Cat R. Waul, who tricks the mice into moving to a better life out west. Tiger tries catching up with his friends, but is thrown off course by a group of dogs. While on the train, Fievel wanders into the livestock car, where he overhears the cats' intentions to turn the mice into \"mouse burgers\". After being discovered, Fievel tries to flee but Cat R.

Brian returns to firefighting after several other careers falter, though Stephen has doubts that Brian is still fit to be a firefighter. In 1971, Brian witnessed the death of their firefighting father, Captain Dennis McCaffrey, while accompanying him on a call. The longest-serving of all the men at Engine 17, John \"Axe\" Adcox, served under the McCaffreys' father and was like an uncle to the boys when their father died. Adcox grows concerned about Stephen's unorthodox methods and disregard for safety procedures, as does Stephen's wife Helen, who separated from Stephen to protect herself and their son Sean from the risks he was taking.\nInspector Donald \"Shadow\" Rimgale, a dedicated arson investigator and veteran firefighter is called in because some recent explosive fires resemble those set by pyromaniac Ronald Bartel, who has been imprisoned for years. Brian is reassigned as his assistant after an argument with Stephen. Rimgale manipulates Ronald's obsession with fire to ensure his annual parole application is rejected. It is revealed during an investigation that Chicago City Council alderman Marty Swayzak has supported fire department budget cuts. Contractors paid him off to shut down firehouses so they could be converted into community centers, with the contractors receiving contracts for the construction. Brian also rekindles a relationship with Jennifer Vaitkus, an aide to Swayzak.\nWhen Engine 17 answers a call in a high-rise, Stephen urges them to move in quickly, despite Adcox's advice to wait for backup. Brian's friend and fellow trainee, Tim Krizminski, opens a door, triggering a backdraft. His face is burned beyond recognition and he barely survives. Adcox and Brian both condemn Stephen for what happened, but Stephen hates being criticized for his behavior.

The man attacks them with a flashlight but is burned on his shoulder by an electrical socket. Rimgale saves Brian and Swayzak from the house but is injured in an explosion.

Stephen confronts Adcox about the backdrafts during a multiple-alarm fire at a chemical plant.

When an explosion destroys the catwalk they are on, Stephen grabs Adcox's hand while hanging on to the remains of the catwalk. Stephen refuses Adcox's advice to let go of him and loses his grip on the catwalk. Stephen lands on the lower catwalk, but Adcox dies when he falls into the fire.

Dindayal says since his only son has already died and since he feels he can trust Jeevanlal, though he is a judge he is ready to give Jeevanlal a new lease of life, with the new name J.V.  as he felt that fate was actually playing the game in life of both himself and Jeevanlal as he, though old, is forced to live in the world, whereas his young son died a premature death and on the other hand Jeevanlal was forced by fate to commit a crime which was necessary to take care of his daughter, but now even that daughter has got separated from him. Dindayal lets Jeevanlal stay in his house and take care of his assets and has advised him not to stop praying to God and gives him a bag full of cash for Jeevanalal to start a new life.\nSix years later Jeevanlal will re-surface as a wealthy male and prospective Mayor knew now simply as J.V.; while his grown-up daughter Guddu (Farah Naaz) will be living two lives - one as the single mother Nirmala of a young boy child, Kiran; and the other as a gun-toting alcoholic dancer prostitute known as Bulbul. Nirmala, after her husband's death starts working in a factory owned by J.V., but due to her concentrating on her small baby's cry, she is thrown out by the factory management and to earn money she gets into the club dancer profession and sends her child to Rajan's Chachi (Shubha Khote). Now Nirmala decides to take revenge on the owner of the factory, J.V., for having changed her life (she was working in his factory only as a worker, but was thrown out and circumstances forced her to become a prostitute.\nShe dresses up like Bulbul, a modern prostitute and decides to meet up with J.V. and she says would he like to be her client for a day. J.V. slaps her, saying he is a good human being and the habit she has is really bad and that she is characterless.  Jeevanlal though, does not know where his daughter is living and how she now looks, but comes across a child called Kiran on the road on a fine day. He asks Kiran why she is crying. Then Rajan Dada says he wants to sell that girl as she has been brought up by Chacha-Chachi in this area and its none of Jeevanlal's business. J.V. replies to him saying this girl reminds him of his own daughter Guddu and asks whether Kiran's mother's name is Nirmala. J.V. harbors doubt in his mind, but Rajan Dada and Chachi stop Kiran from disclosing her mother's name and J.V. asks Kulkarni to find the name of Kiran's parents. Later, he finds Bulbul again in the profession of prostitute and advises her saying that she should not be in this profession and that she is like a daughter to him. Then Bulbul says J.V. you are responsible me for being thrown out of your factory and making me a prostitute, otherwise I would have been a simple working-class woman.\nNirmala does not recognize her dad's face immediately, but soon her memory works and she realizes that J.V. is her own father from whom she got separated after that fateful night, but chooses to not let J.V. know the truth. Later Jeevanlal tries his best to solve all her problems including dealing with Rajan Dada, who is responsible for Nirmala's husband's early death and Kiran separating from her mother Nirmala. Later Bulbul confesses that she is  Nirmala, none other than his own daughter, who was forced to live a horrific life, due to his absence in her life during teenage years and aftermath.

His boss, Charles Pinkworth, congratulates him on the sale, but when Bernard reveals that he promised half of the money to the original owners of the paintings, as was fair, Pinkworth fires him. Bernard returns dejectedly to his flat and seeks comfort, but discovers that his girlfriend has been sleeping with his best friend.

During the fight, Bernard wishes that the man could speak English, at which point he does. When the man states \"Your wish is my command\", Bernard wishes for the fight to stop, which it does. Bernard learns that the man, named Josephus, is a genie who had been trapped inside the lamp for two thousand years, and that he can grant almost any wish. The two forge a friendship in which Bernard introduces Josephus to modern food, music and entertainment, as well as using wishes to furnish his flat with expensive furniture and even the authentic Mona Lisa, which is subsequently reported missing from the Louvre.\nAfter a night on the town, Bernard returns to his flat without Josephus (who is watching movies at a theater) to find someone inside.

The film focuses on his conflicts with his family and his relations with the prominent jazz musicians of the 1920s, such as Hoagy Carmichael, Joe Venuti, Pee Wee Russell, Don Murray, and Paul Whiteman.\nThe film opens in October 1931 in New York City, two months after the death of Bix Beiderbecke. His brother Burnie arrives in the city to meet Liza, who was to be the future bride of the deceased brother. His investigations of where Bix worked led him to the Italian-American violinist Joe Venuti, the trumpeter's only true friend and therefore unique in knowing the truth and the identity of the girl. Venuti, despite the initial hesitation, decides to help him in the investigation. He contacts the girl and convinces her to follow him to the trumpeter's hometown, Davenport, Iowa, thus fulfilling Bix's mother's desire, who is eager to meet her.\nDuring the long train journey, however, it turns out that Liza never met Bix. Venuti will take advantage of it to tell her, in addition to the way in which Bix came into contact with her, the short but intense life of his friend, who he had met by chance while trying to get an engagement in the Jean Goldkette orchestra. A series of flashbacks follow. Bix was hampered by the fact that he could not read music but played by ear. Bix achieved success when he performed and recorded with the orchestra of Frank Trumbauer who, despite his somewhat peculiar character, took him under his protective wing.\nThe film ends with Bix's untimely death in 1931 in New York City.

Jesuit missionaries are trying to encourage the local Algonquin Indians to embrace Christianity, with thus far only limited results. Samuel de Champlain, founder of the settlement, sends Father LaForgue, a young Jesuit priest, to found a Catholic mission in a distant Huron village. With winter approaching, the journey will be difficult and cover as much as 1500 miles (2414 kilometers).\nLaForgue is accompanied on his journey by a non-Jesuit assistant, Daniel, and a group of Algonquin Indians whom Champlain has charged with guiding him to the Huron village. This group includes Chomina \u2013 an older, experienced traveller who has clairvoyant dreams; his wife; and Annuka, their daughter. As they journey across the lakes and forests, Daniel and Annuka fall in love, to the discomfort of the celibate LaForgue.\nThe group meet with a band of Montagnais, First Nations people who have never met Frenchmen before. The Montagnais shaman, Mestigoit, is suspicious (and implicitly jealous) of LaForgue's influence over the Algonquins. He accuses him of being a demon. He encourages Chomina and the other Algonquins to abandon the two Frenchmen and travel instead to a winter hunting lodge. This they do, paddling away from the Frenchmen. LaForgue accepts his fate, but Daniel is determined to stay with Annuka and follows the Indians as they march across the forest. When one Indian tries to shoot Daniel, Chomina is consumed by guilt at having betrayed Champlain's trust. He and a few other members of the Algonquin tribe return with Daniel to try to find LaForgue.\nAs they recover LaForgue, a party of Mohawk Iroquois attack them, killing most of the Algonquin, amongst them Chomina's wife, and taking the rest captive. They are taken to an Iroquois fortress, where they are forced to run the gauntlet, watch Chomina's young son be killed, and are told they will be slowly tortured to death the next day. That night Annuka seduces their guard, allowing him to engage in coitus with her. When this distracts him she strikes him with a caribou hoof, rendering him unconscious and allowing them to escape. Chomina, dying of a wound from his capture, sees a small grove he has dreamed of many times before, and realizes it is the place he is destined to die. LaForgue tries, unsuccessfully, to persuade Chomina to embrace Christ before he dies. As Chomina freezes to death in the snow, he sees the She-Manitou appearing to him.\nAs the weather grows colder, Annuka and Daniel take LaForgue to the outskirts of the Huron settlement, but leave him to enter it alone, because Chomina had dreamed that this must happen. LaForgue finds all but one of the French inhabitants dead, murdered by the Hurons who blamed them for a smallpox epidemic. The leader of the last survivors tells LaForgue that the Hurons are dying, and he should offer to save them by baptizing them. LaForgue confronts the Hurons.\nWhen their leader asks LaForgue if he loves them, LaForgue thinks of the faces of all the Indians he has met on his journey, and answers \"Yes\".  The leader then asks him to baptize them, and the Hurons receive his baptism. The film ends with a golden sunrise.

Max intentionally crosses paths in a bar with County Courthouse clerk Lori Davis (who is flirtatiously involved with Sam). Max then rapes and beats her nearly to death. Despite advice from Sam to press charges, she refuses to, out of fear that their ongoing platonic flirtation becomes public. Sam hires a private investigator, Claude Kersek, to stalk Max.\nMax approaches 15 year old Danielle Bowden by impersonating her new drama teacher and feigning an unorthodox interest in her teenage angst. He lures her to the school theater, shares a joint with her, manipulates her libido and attraction to him and kisses her. Her parents find the joint in her schoolbook, and Danny's coyness about the extent of Max's seduction  angers Sam and drives him to the point of desperation. He then agrees to Kersek's plan, which he had dismissed earlier, to have Max beaten up. Sam also gives Max a final warning, which Max secretly tapes with a hidden recorder. Kersek's three hired thugs accost and beat Max with chains and pipes as Sam watches from behind a dumpster, but Max turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them instead. Max then uses his recording of Sam's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Sam. Lee Heller (Max's lawyer) also petitions the ABA Ethics Committee for Sam's disbarment, thereby triggering a two-day emergency meeting in Raleigh.\nKersek then anticipates Max's intention to break into the Bowden house while Sam is in Raleigh. The family fakes Sam's departure and hides in the house, hoping that Max will break in, so that he can be shot in self-defense. However, Max sneaks in and kills the Bowdens' housekeeper, Graciela, and dons her clothing before murdering Kersek by garroting him with a piano wire and shooting him with his own pistol. Horrified after discovering the bodies, the Bowdens flee to their houseboat docked upstate along the Cape Fear River.\nMax, who has followed the family, attacks Sam and prepares to rape Leigh and Danny while making Sam watch. Danny sprays Max with lighter fluid as he lights a cigar, engulfing him in flames and causing him to jump off the boat. However, Max clings to a rope and pulls himself back on board. As the boat is rocked by a violent thunderstorm and the raging river, a badly burned and deranged Max confronts Sam, putting him on a mock trial for his deliberate negligence 14 years ago. Despite Sam's insistence that Max bragged about beating two prior rape charges and that his crime was too heinous for the promiscuity report to be taken into account, Max berates him for failing to do his duty as a lawyer.\nThe storm eventually knocks Max off his feet, allowing Sam to gain the upper hand once the women jump off the boat and make it to shore. Sam uses Max's handcuffs to shackle Max to the boat. When the boat hits a rock and is destroyed, the fight continues on shore, but a raging tide carries Max away and he drowns speaking in tongues and singing the hymn \"On Jordan's Stormy Banks I Stand\".

Hardboiled private detective Harry Philip Lovecraft is unique, a person who actively chooses not to use magic because he believes it keeps his conscience clean.\nA man named Mickey delivers a large grimoire to nightclub owner and mobster Harry Bordon in return for a sizeable payment. Mickey seems nervous, and after he leaves it is revealed why: the book is blank. Bordon orders his lieutenant, Tugwell, to follow Mickey. Mickey heads for Union Station, where he intends to meet with his girlfriend, Lilly Sirwar. However, Mickey spots Tugwell and tells Lilly to flee before being cornered by Tugwell in a restroom. Tugwell animates the trimmed sheets of newspaper that Mickey believed to be cash, and murders him with thousands of papercuts while Lilly retrieves a large package from a station locker.\nMeanwhile, Lovecraft is contacted by the wealthy and eccentric Amos Hackshaw to recover the actual book, the Necronomicon, which was stolen from his collection by his former chauffeur, Larry Willis. Willis was fired after Hackshaw believed he was attempting to corrupt his 16-year-old daughter, Olivia, who he has raised alone ever since he became a widower. Hackshaw asks Lovecraft to locate the book before a conference that starts at midnight two nights from then. Before departing the Hackshaw estate, Lovecraft meets Olivia, an avid hunter of unicorns and worshipper of Diana. Olivia has been sheltered and repressed all her life and as a result exhibits inappropriate behavior, including sexual aggression, which Lovecraft spurns. As Lovecraft leaves, Hackshaw sends a gargoyle familiar to observe the investigation.\nWhile investigating the flophouse where Willis had been living, Lovecraft recovers a trio of clues: a souvenir photo of Mickey & Lilly taken at Harry Bordon\u2019s Dunwich Club, a sample of perfume, and a note on a housing development's stationery reading \"Union Station - One Bag\". Lovecraft then heads to the Dunwich Club, where he encounters Connie Stone, an old flame who is now in a relationship with Bordon, with whom Lovecraft once had some association. Lovecraft asks around about Mickey before being summoned to speak to Bordon. Bordon tries to convince Lovecraft to join his organization, which Lovecraft rejects before questioning Bordon about the Necronomicon. When he leaves, Tugwell and his zombie henchman follow shortly after. At his office, it is revealed that Lovecraft and Bordon were former partners on the LA County police force before Bordon became corrupt.\nThe next morning, Lovecraft wakes to find Olivia in his office, apologizing for her behavior the previous day. Lovecraft takes her out to breakfast, and Tugwell pays the diner manager to deliver a slip containing cursed runes to Lovecraft. Lovecraft recognizes the incantation and confronts the manager, resulting in a fight that\u2019s interrupted when a demon emerges and kills the manager, who was holding the slip at that moment. Lovecraft and the diner's cook trap the demon in a freezer before he and Olivia head to the police station to give statements about the incident. While there, Detective Otto Grimaldi and Olivia display an obvious attraction.\nLovecraft & Olivia are released with the help of his landlady, Hypolite Kropotkin, and her cousin, attorney Thadius Pilgrim. Lovecraft mentions the Necronomicon, and Mrs. Kropotkin shows immediate worry, declaring it to be the key to ending the world, quoting the Book of Revelation. Lovecraft returns Olivia home, where he updates Hackshaw on the status of the case. When he leaves the Hackshaw estate, he realizes he is being followed and discovers Grimaldi had been ordered to tail him. Lovecraft, who has grown concerned for Olivia's well-bring, asks Grimaldi to watch her instead.\nThat night, Lovecraft returns to his office/apartment to find Connie waiting for him. They spend the night together, and the next morning she tells Lovecraft what she knows about Mickey & Lilly and identifies the perfume sample. After Connie leaves, Lovecraft talks to Mrs. Kropotkin, who gives him a protective charm despite his protests and warns him that the rituals in the Necronomicon can backfire against the caster. Olivia discovers Grimaldi spying on her when she accidentally injures him while hunting, and takes him into the mansion so she can see to him.\nLovecraft goes to Vista Bonita, the housing development on the stationery he found in Willis\u2019 rented room. Mickey is revealed to be Michael J. Locksteader, the president of the real estate company building the community. He learns that Lilly has been posing to others as Mickey's sister, and is staying at the Hotel Ashcroft. Lovecraft enlists Connie\u2019s help to lure Lilly to meet. At the hotel, Lovecraft realizes that Lilly is the drag persona of Larry Willis, who started a relationship with Mickey Locksteader after they met at a party.\nAfter Lovecraft agrees to help Willis flee to Tijuana, Willis reveals that Bordon is the actual money behind Vista Bonita through a series of shell corporations. Mickey recruited Willis on Bordon's behalf to infiltrate the Hackshaw home and find out why Hackshaw wanted to purchase the development at substantially above market value. Willis discovered the Necronomicon and stole it on Bordon's orders, along with the blank fake that Bordon received, which had been commissioned for insurance purposes. Willis & Mickey intended to ransom the real book back to Hackshaw to get money to flee Los Angeles together, because Hackshaw & Bordon plan to unleash the Great Old Ones using the book, and will sacrifice Olivia as part of the ritual because she is a virgin.\nHackshaw's gargoyle arrives, destroying the hotel room and killing Willis. Lovecraft & Connie flee to her apartment with the Necronomicon, only to discover Bordon and Tugwell waiting. Bordon reveals that Connie has doublecrossed Lovecraft, kills Tugwell for murdering Mickey before he could lead them to the book, and takes possession of the real copy. Bordon, Connie, and the zombie henchman take Lovecraft captive and go to Vista Bonita, where they meet Hackshaw, who has Olivia bound and gagged in preparation for the ritual. Bordon reveals he and Hackshaw have been in partnership, with Bordon becoming ruler of the new world while Hackshaw believes he will ascend to godhood. Connie kills Bordon, declaring she has no intention to be subservient to him, but Hackshaw takes control of the zombie henchman before Connie can shoot Lovecraft as well, who Hackshaw wants to witness the summoning. Using the book and its incantations, Hackshaw successfully summons an eldritch horror in the center of Vista Bonita. However, the creature rejects Olivia as a sacrifice and devours Hackshaw instead, despite Lovecraft\u2019s attempt to save the villain. The ritual having failed, the monster sinks back into the earth and returns through its portal.\nAs a result of Hackshaw's death, the gargoyle familiar vanishes and the zombie expires. When Olivia regains consciousness, she tells Lovecraft that Grimaldi is in Hackshaw's car, and Lovecraft realizes what has happened: Olivia successfully seduced a married Grimaldi, who took her virginity, leaving her unusable as a sacrifice. Lovecraft tells Connie she will have to be taken into custody for killing Bordon, but they still share a kiss before she is arrested.

Boyd and Grushenko are forced on the run from both the KGB and Boyd's superiors; even though Boyd told Jaffe that the handover was a setup, Grissom insists that Boyd has gone rogue and orders Jaffe to hunt him and Grushenko down. Boyd and Grushenko decide their only option is go into hiding and live off the $2 million, but they first need to launder the cash since the CIA can track the serial numbers on the bills. After securing fake IDs and credit cards and evading a police dragnet, the pair go to Faisal, a Saudi arms dealer previously used by the CIA to support anti-communist movements, to see about the money, but find that the easing of the Cold War has left him practically impoverished.\nWith the CIA now working with the KGB to find Boyd and Grushenko, the pair make their way to Paris, where Grushenko claims to have a girlfriend who can handle their money problem. Grushenko also reveals to Boyd that the man in the subway really was Sobel, who had been turned by the Soviets after his capture and was living in America as a sleeper agent in the guise of an economics professor. Grushenko knew Sobel because they both had the same handler, a turncoat in the US military codenamed \"Donald\". Boyd concludes that the cash-strapped KGB had arranged the fake handover of Sobel with Donald's help to scam the CIA out of $2 million, but the botched trade had jeopardized Donald's cover. In Paris, Grushenko reunites with his apparent girlfriend, Natasha Grimaud, who is in reality his daughter and works at a Japanese corporation where she can wire their money to a Swiss bank account to be withdrawn as clean bills. While Grushenko travels to Switzerland to retrieve the money, the CIA/KGB kidnap Natasha to coerce Boyd and Grushenko into surrendering. Boyd concedes to their demands chooses the Eiffel Tower as the handover site. Boyd and Grushenko manage to free Natasha and then dodge the CIA/KGB, but find the tower's exits have been cut off. The two friends duck into Le Jules Verne to share one last bottle of Starka. After Boyd suggests that they should take up residence in the Seychelles if they somehow escape, Grushenko relates that he just called Donald, implied to be Grissom, and left a false message that Sobel had been a triple-agent for the CIA all along.", "tmdb_id": 32074}, "17511730": {"title": "Conagher", "plot": "The film opens with the Teale family moving west on a wagon into Indian Territory.

However, he is killed along the way when his horse falls over on him, and he bleeds to death internally.\nMeanwhile, a stagecoach passes by the Teale farm; Evie Teale agrees to work for the stagecoach by feeding customers. One of the men on the stagecoach warns Evie of a man named Conn Conagher, who he claims is a fierce gunfighter. One day, Conagher and his partner Mahler, stop at the Teale farm for food. The farm later comes under attack by Indians. The stagecoach arrives again in the middle of the gunfight and the drivers and the passengers help defend the farm. The defeated Indians retreat in the morning.\nConagher, meanwhile, drifts out in the wilderness. Mahler and he meet an old rancher, Seaborn Tay, who hires both of them. Conagher proves to be a hardworking cowhand, but the ranch comes under threat by the Ladder Five gang, led by Smoke Parnell. Mahler deserts the ranch after an argument with Conagher and joins the Ladder gang. Conagher saves the ranch and Tay's cattle twice from the Ladder gang, both in a series of quick gun battles. He also visits the Teale farm regularly, and Evie and he grow fond of each other and he becomes a father figure to her children.\nOne day, when Conagher is out herding Tay's cattle, he is ambushed and shot by the Ladder Five gang. The wounded Conagher hides out during the day, and at night returns and holds the Ladder Five, including Parnell, at gunpoint. Weak from his wound, Conagher eventually collapses and passes out, but not before he demands the Ladder Five to clear off of the land. Parnell knows now that he can finish Conagher, as his gang has sworn to do, but instead orders his man to take Conagher to Seaborn Tay.

Tay says he can stay and own part of the ranch, he has earned it, but Conagher has always been a drifter and he feels he needs to move on. He stops in the saloon in town and sees the stagecoach manager, who buys him a drink. Conagher tells him he has \"tumbleweed fever\"  and the stagecoach manager laughs and says, \"you, too?\" Apparently, cowboys all over the county have been finding the notes tied to the tumbleweeds, and wondering about the woman who wrote them. The conversation shifts to Mrs. Teale, and the stagecoach manager says the family had a hard winter, but they made it through.

He has brought some groceries as a gift and Mrs. Teale asks him to stay for dinner. He ends up staying for a few days and helps fix the roof and do other chores. Mrs. Teale and he are sitting in rockers in front of the house and it seems like he may be about to say something romantic when Mahler rides up. Apparently, he has been courting Mrs. Teale, although she is not very interested. Conagher and he have a quiet argument about the Ladder Five gang in front of Mrs. Teale, and when Mahler sees that she believes Conagher, he turns and rides away.\nEvie asks Conagher what he was about to say before Mahler appeared, but he claims he cannot remember. He tells her it is time for him to be moving on, and he gives her some money to buy more groceries, saying he would like return, but he does not want to be an imposition. He rides off, telling himself he is a fool, but he does not think he is worthy of Evie.\nIn town, Conagher plans to get drunk and then head north, but he finds a drunken Mahler in the saloon. The two argue again, and Conagher challenges Mahler to a fist fight. Mahler starts out beating up Conagher; Conagher finally gains the upper hand. Evie arrives at that moment where she tells Conagher, \"It's time for you to come home now.\"  Conagher is physically hurt, but asks her why she came here. She tells them they all felt lost without him. He takes some of her tumbleweed notes out of his pocket and asks her if she wrote them. She said she did. She was just so lonely she had to talk to someone even if  no one was there to hear. He says, \"There was, Evie, there was me.\" They kiss, and he says they can start a new life together.

Their dialogue is in Gullah creole.Narrated by the Unborn Child, the future daughter of Eli and Eula, whose voice is influenced by accounts of her ancestors, the film presents poetic visual images and circular narrative structures to represent the past, present and future for the Gullah, the majority of whom are about to embark for the mainland and a more modern, \"civilized\" way of life. The old ways and African ancestral history are represented by community matriarch Nana Peazant, who practices African spiritual rituals.

The city is a purgatory-like waiting area staffed by all-knowing and efficient but largely condescending bureaucracy who, having themselves moved on to their current new universal phase, mostly seem to gingerly look down on the new arrivals who will have their lives (or most recent lives) on Earth judged over a week-long or so hearing, each before two judges. Amenities and activities are provided, from delicious, calorie-free all-you-can-eat buffets to bowling alleys and comedy clubs.Daniel's defense attorney, Bob Diamond, explains that people from Earth use so little of their brains that they spend most of their lives functioning based on their fears. If the court determines that Daniel has conquered his fears, he will be sent on to the next phase of existence, where he will be able to use more of his brain and thus be able to experience more of what the universe has to offer. Otherwise, his soul will be reincarnated on Earth to live another life in another attempt at moving past his fears.\nAt Daniel's tribunal, presided over by two judges, Diamond argues that Daniel should move onto the next phase, but his formidable opponent, prosecutor Lena Foster, takes the opposing argument. Each utilizes video-like footage from select days in Daniel's life to make their case to the judges.\nDuring the procedure, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia, a recently deceased woman who lived a seemingly perfect life of courage and generosity, especially compared to his, which also explains why her fancy hotel lodgings are so much nicer than his spartan motel-like room.\nFollowing each day's proceedings, Daniel and Julia spend time exploring Judgement City, including the Pavilion of Past Lives (hosted by a version of Shirley MacLaine, famous for her outspoken belief in reincarnation), where people can see all their past lives, often quite shockingly dichotomous.\nIn the meantime, things do not go well for Daniel. Foster shows a series of episodes in which Daniel never managed to overcome his fears, as well as various other bad decisions and mishaps, while Diamond vigorously attempts to portray Daniel's actions more positively, sometimes praising his client's \"restraint\" and \"thoughtfulness\".\nBefore the last day of Daniel's hearing, Julia asks Daniel to spend the night with her, but despite his strong feelings for her, he declines. The next day, Foster plays footage of Daniel's previous night with Julia, over Diamond's objections. Foster argues this clearly underscores Daniel's fear and lack of courage. The next day, it is ruled that Daniel will return to Earth, while Julia is judged worthy to move on. Before saying goodbye, Diamond comforts Daniel with the knowledge that the court is not infallible and just because Foster won it doesn't mean she's right, but Daniel remains disappointed.\nDaniel boards a tram poised to return to Earth when Julia yells to him from a different tram. He manages to desperately unstrap himself, claw open a door, and leap, dodging other trams, and suffering minor electric shocks to get to Julia's tram. She is unable to open the door and he is unable to enter her tram. He clings to the outside of the moving vehicle, banging on the door and trying to pry it open. She yells in vain for the driver to stop. They tell each other they love each other. The scene pulls back to show that the entire event is being watched by closed circuit TV by Diamond, Foster, and the judges in the chamber where Daniel's hearing took place. Diamond remarks to Foster, \"Brave enough for you?\", who gives him a slight smiling acknowledgement. One judge whispers to the other, who then sends a message ordering the tram doors opened.

Rollie is suspicious and secretly collects his hidden cameras but must leave one behind. Rollie immediately calls Leo McCarthy (Brian Dennehy), a cop he had worked with before, and leaves a message to say that he\u2019s in trouble and needs help.\nThe next day, Rollie, his girlfriend Kim (Rachel Ticotin) and her son Chris go to Mike\u2019s house to collect some personal items. The house is being thoroughly searched by cops. They are even searching through the files on floppy disks, including Chris\u2019s game disk which is snatched away by Kim. Silak is there. He gives Rollie back the camera from the crime scene, asking why the apartment was being filmed. He now knows that Rollie saw Mike\u2019s killer and plants the idea that it may have been a cop. He asks Rollie if Mike mentioned any old cases he was working on. As soon as they leave Silak, Rollie suspects Mike was set up and drives Kim and Chris to her sister\u2019s house to keep them safe. That night at their loft, Rollie looks through the camera\u2019s footage. He sees Silak planting evidence to indicate that the model murderer also killed Mike. Rollie doesn\u2019t notice the door bolts being unlocked as he searches the recording. Just as Rollie finds footage of the killer, the killer appears before him and demands the recording. Rollie is able to manoeuvre the killer to be in range of Bluey and uses the telemetry suit to control the robot\u2019s actions while it fights the intruder. The killer overcomes the robot and the fight leads to the fire escape, with Leo showing up to save the day in the nick of time.\nAt Leo\u2019s closed bar, he listens to the story from Rollie and deduces that Silak is interested in an old, unsolved case that Mike was working on in his spare time. The next day, he asks his old police contact Velez if she would discreetly check into Mike\u2019s cases. Meanwhile, Rollie sneaks into Silak\u2019s office and taps his phone. Back at the bar, Leo and Rollie intercept a call from Silak to someone named Neely (Kevin J. O'Connor), an inmate who is given the details to say for his court appearance in exchange for information. The next day, Leo arrives in court to listen to the case that Neely is testifying for. His testimony makes the case. Leo meets with Neely\u2019s lawyer after the court session, an old friend of his named Liz Kennedy (Joanna Gleason). He warns her that Neely\u2019s testimony was supplied to him. Leo visits Neely at the prison and sees him visiting the bedside of a dying old inmate. Although Neely refuses to speak with him, Leo finds out that the old man is Carl Becker.\nBack at the bar, Leo brings Rollie up to speed with Becker\u2019s notoriety. The old inmate had stolen solid gold medallions that were cast by Michelangelo depicting the bronze figures in the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. He was arrested quite shortly after the theft but the coins were never recovered. This was the case that Mike had been working on. While this conversation is happening, the killer follows Kim as she leaves her workplace. Rollie remembers the floppy disk that had Chris\u2019s games on it had a file named Becker. He calls Chris and learns that Kim went to work even though he had told her it was unsafe. Rollie leaves to find Kim while Leo arranges for Chris to send the file to Velez by modem, the nearest one being at the mall. At the mall, Chris is ready to send the file just as his mom arrives, followed closely by the killer who then threatens her. Chris begins the file transfer. Leo is waiting with Velez and watches as the file is received. One name that is new from the file is Samson. The mall closes just as Rollie arrives and barges his way in. He finds Kim and Chris being threatened by the killer. He manages to get them away from the killer and into the mall grocery store. Rollie uses the items he can find to create traps for the killer while they find a way out. All exits are blocked, so Rollie lures the killer to the meat packaging machine and incapacitates him.\nLeo takes Velez for a celebratory dinner at his favourite Chinese place - a street vendor in Chinatown. Just as they begin to eat, a single gunshot kills Velez before a drive-by shooting targets the street vendor. Meanwhile, Neely makes a last visit to a dying Becker, asking him to unburden his soul by sharing the location of the coins. Later, Leo drinks in the near dark of his bar as Rollie comes in. They update each other about Velez and the killer, who is just a hired thug. The thug did give up the information that Silak has a helicopter booked for that weekend. Leo visits Liz. His superficial wounds are looked after as her cat demands his attention. He tells Liz his plans regarding capturing Silak at the location where the chopper will be and insists that she be there in person, as it would help her career. Neely meets Silak and they are both followed by Rollie. They go to a cathedral so that Neely can retrieve the hidden coins. Cut to Rollie gathering special effects gear in the back of his van.\nThat weekend, Neely and Silak enter a large, secluded house with the gold medallions. They are met by several guards, the buyer, and an authenticator. Meanwhile, Rollie sets off various effects to trap the guard dogs and take the guards out of commission one by one. Leo and Liz arrive and Leo gives her a gun just in case there\u2019s trouble. As the authenticator examines the coins, Leo walks into the room with his gun drawn. He is soon unarmed by Liz herself and relegated to informing Neely and Silak about the buyer - he\u2019s part of the mob. The coins are authenticated, a guard takes them out to the boat, and the chopper arrives. Leo asks questions of everyone about the situation and learns that the mob plans to return the coins to the Vatican. Suddenly, an explosion outside unnerves everyone. Leo presses Liz to give up her gun and he is shot as she panics. Neely takes her gun just as the guard, on fire, bursts into the room from the backyard. Neely and Silak grab the money and the coins from the guard and run to the chopper. Once there, Neely shoots Silak but the gun has blanks. Silak shoots Neely instead and boards the chopper. Liz turns her attention away from the chaos outside only to see Leo very much alive. The burned guard turns out to be Rollie covered in the firesafe gel. Rollie runs out to the boat while Leo makes his disappointment known to Liz. He had discovered her involvement in the scheme when he saw the name given to her cat - Samson. Her criminal involvement was confirmed when the backup she was to arrange for didn\u2019t show up. Sirens are heard approaching. It is the backup that Leo had called just in case they were needed. Liz is left to wait for them. Leo joins Rollie in the boat.\nIn the chopper, Silak becomes worried when the helicopter changes direction and begins to fly haphazardly. He berates the pilot only to see that it is a clown. Rollie, in the telemetry suit in the boat, has Bluey let go of the controls, which Silak quickly grabs. The clown robot reaches behind its seat for the case with the money then jumps from the plane. Rollie and Leo fish the robot and case from the water. Leo wonders how long it will take them to dry the money when Rollie produces the gold medallions that he had safely hidden. Leo informs him that the mob was going to return the coins to the Vatican so he shouldn\u2019t have stolen them. A collection plate is being passed around a church service. It stops between two men and they drop a set of golden coins into it. Afterwards, Leo and Rollie leave the church and decide what they should have for lunch with their newly-dried money. As they walk and banter about food, the camera pans out to show that they are in Rome.

About five years later, Frank's truck surfaces in a nearby river. Idgie becomes a suspect, having publicly threatened Frank for beating Ruth. Sheriff Grady Kilgore detains both Idgie and Big George. Kilgore offers to release Idgie and pin Frank's supposed murder solely on Big George, but Idgie refuses. During the subsequent trial, Reverend Scroggins provides false testimony that supports both Idgie's and Big George's alibis. Taking into account Frank's reputation for drunkenness and his body never being found, the judge rules his probable death as accidental and drops all charges against Idgie and Big George.\nShortly after the trial, Ruth is diagnosed with terminal cancer and soon dies. When trains stop running through Whistle Stop, the caf\u00e9 closes, and the town folk drift away. Ninny's story concludes, but not before Frank's fate is revealed. When Frank attempted to kidnap Buddy Jr., Sipsey hit Frank over the head with a cast iron skillet, killing him.

They continue suffering lopsided defeats from both the Breds and a team of ex-cons, led by pro player Luther Hakim.\nMeanwhile, Truth's cocaine problems are deteriorating, and he is unable to cope with the pressure surrounding pro-life. He runs off from a meeting with media members, then later shows up high on drugs at Byron's house, forcing Zack to lead him to Matthew. He wants to challenge to play one-on-one, but Matthew outclasses him. Byron and Zack then convince him to postpone his pro career and finish college first, but he angrily rushes off when the college coach demands that he starts to attend therapy with his problems. He returns to the slums from where Byron once saved him. Racine's assistant Dalton Ellis turns up and tells him that Byron took advantage of him for his own profit, which prompts him to go to Racine on his own and signs the contract he is handed, only to learn that he wouldn't see any money until finishing a rehabilitation program. He then angrily confronts Byron and cuts ties with him. Abandoned by everyone, one night he overdoses cocaine and dies. Byron and Zack confront Racine in his office and get physical with him, for which they get arrested and imprisoned. After being released, they visit Matthew and try to convince him to play again, but he refuses, saying that he does not want to be \"the next Truth\".\nThe story culminates in another game between the Stars and the Breds. Zack's team shows more resistance this time, but are still headed to a large scale defeat, and are still unable to play as a team. Zack desperately calls for a timeout and begs them to play for their pride, which seems to have some effect, but soon afterwards Casey is injured and has to leave the field. As they have no reserves, the game is called off, when Matthew unexpectedly emerges from among the spectators and joins Zack's team. The game continues, led by Matthew and with the rest of the team finally playing as a unit, the Stars are closing the gap, and ultimately win the game by a long distance shot from the returning Casey.\nFollowing the game, Matthew tells Byron that he is now ready to join UCLA. Byron changes his priorities, and decides to take care to all of his players; as a start he is sending Casey to play for the University of Alaska. He also offers a partnership to Zack, who accepts it, and they plan to operate the playground together in the future.", "tmdb_id": 76794}, "3936178": {"title": "Henna (film)", "plot": "Chandar Prakash (Rishi Kapoor), who lives in Srinagar, is due to be engaged and married to Chandni Kaul (Ashwini Bhave), whom he calls Chand. On the day of the engagement, he experiences an accident, and mistakenly strays into the Pakistani side of Kashmir. A native girl, Henna (Zeba Bakhtiar), falls in love with him; this is amidst the controversial Indian-Pakistani tension in Kashmir, which leads to him being suspected, by the Pakistani police, of being an Indian spy.\nBeautiful Henna Khan lives a transient life near the river Jhelum, in Pakistan, with her widowed dad, Khan Baba, and three brothers Ashraf, Razzak and Zaman. One day, she comes across an unconscious man who has been washed ashore. Khan Baba, Gul Bibi (the village doctor) and Henna take this stranger in and nurse him back to health, only to find out that he has lost his memory. The man, in his sleep, cries out the name \"Chand!\", thus everyone starts calling him by that name. Soon, he is well enough to walk around and starts working for Gul Bibi, helping her make clay pots. Henna falls in love and would like to marry him, much to the chagrin of Daroga Shahbaaz Khan (Raza Murad), who has already been married twice; according to Shariat law, he can marry twice more.

The activations mean that Ben Pennington does not get to tell his father and brother, who are off in the woods, goodbye, Phoebe Jeter does not get to see her ill grandmother for one last time, Daniel Maldonado misses the birth of his daughter, and one bride, Linda Buckholz, has to show her wedding to the guests on video. \nThe viewer is treated to displays of American and coalition military deployment as contemporary radio news reports inform the viewer that the United Nations coalition has started to attack Iraq and occupied Kuwait as a prelude to liberating Kuwait. As Ben Pennington is deployed aboard an Air Force rescue helicopter, a hidden cameraman interviews him, and Ben replies that they are deliberately attracting Iraqi radar so AH-64 Apache helicopters can target the radars with anti-radiation missiles to clear a corridor for the bombers and simultaneously providing rescue cover in case a pilot is shot down and needs to be rescued by Ben and the crew on board.\nThe viewer gets to hear more news reports about infrared and night vision technology and laser-guided missiles fired from planes including the F-117 Nighthawk while a Nighthawk is displayed and gun camera footage shows various targets being destroyed in a sterile, precise fashion. Another news report mentions the role played by the Navy battleships Wisconsin and Missouri while they are shown firing their 16-inch (406 mm) guns onto Iraqi coastal targets. After Navy Corpsman Julian Crumes (played by Tim Russ) and Marine Gunnery Sergeant Leroy Ford (played by Ken Foree) are interviewed by another hidden cameraman about what they think about the bombing, CNN footage of Baghdad being bombed is shown while a reporter is giving his impression of it. For a finale before the second commercial break, Steve Tate intercepts and destroys an Iraqi aircraft.\nDespite the cheers of his mates at King Abdul Aziz air base, Tate does not enjoy having the first air-to-air kill of the war because \"a person died in that aircraft.\"  As General Chuck Horner was interviewed, \"I've met Iraqi pilots, and they're good...\" but attributed their weaknesses to Iraqi command and control, when, once it and the radars were defeated, made the Iraqis easier to shoot down. \nBack home in Pennsylvania, Beverly Clark is dismayed to be activated and deployed, and shares her doubts about coming home alive with her mother. Several starving and frightened Iraqi soldiers, waving white flags and approaching the border, surrender to Crumes' and Ford's Marine squad, and cringe when the Marines fire a warning shot. The prisoners are given food and medical attention as required under the Geneva Convention. In contrast, Iraq's treatment of coalition prisoners such as British Tornado pilot John Peters is shown as Iraq depicted to the news media, and new prisoner Guy Hunter is tortured under interrogation and also shown to the news media while his daughter and wife back home watch in anguish. The F-14 Devon Jones is flying is hit by a surface-to-air missile despite attempts to evade it, and both are forced to eject before the jet is engulfed in flame.\nDevon Jones lands in Iraq before dawn and activates his emergency transmitter. Soon Ben Pennington is out looking for him. But the Iraqis are also homing in on the rescue signal. Devon notices a truck, and then notices the Air Force helicopter. The helicopter notices the vehicle, and Devon indicates it might be a military vehicle. At least one AH-64 Apache is covering the rescue, and fires Hellfire missiles on the truck. Ben expertly disembarks from the helicopter, rifle drawn, and quickly finds Devon, does a \"fireman's carry\" for him, runs to the MH-53J helicopter, hands over his rifle, hands over Devon, and quickly secures Devon for liftoff while gunners watch for the enemy. Not a second after Devon is secured when the helicopter lifts off, \"inbound\" with \"survivor on board\". Devon demands to know about his backseater, Larry. Ben replies that they will know when they return to base. Indeed, Larry was captured.\nCrumes and Ford are enjoying some bottled water when the Battle of Khafji begins and a unit needs a Corpsman. Crumes is able to save one soldier's life, but reflects to Ford on the terror of war and asks if Vietnam was as bad. Ford replies that the all-volunteer U.S. military in Iraq is better trained than the U.S. military in Vietnam, but adds that the Marines will still go in first, this time like the last. \nAfter another news report and video of Scuds falling on Israel, which although attacked, must remain neutral for the sake of maintaining the international coalition including Egypt and Syria, the Patriot anti-missile system is introduced. Phoebe Jeter's battery saves Gary Buckholz's base. Meanwhile, Beverly Clark and Mary Rhoads are at a processing center for incoming U.S. soldiers, in Dhahran, which will later be hit by a Scud. Meanwhile, Private Steven Shaefer has volunteered for Desert Storm duty, and quickly upon arriving in Kuwait meets Specialist Jonathan Alston. When an explosion is heard in the distance, Alston knows that Shaefer is inexperienced in combat, and questions him about his training. Sure enough, Steven has not been prepped on chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear warfare or even on land mines, merely his basic training. When Jonathan demands to know how the Army messed up sending him into danger, Steven drops his bombshell. Alston is impressed and says they will win medals like Alston's uncles did in the Second World War.\nThe ground war starts. Marine Captain Michael Shupp (played by Kevin Kilner) instructs Ford and Crumes' unit to fight professionally to keep one another safe, but to reserve compassion for Saddam's draftees deliberately sacrificed by Saddam to keep his Republican Guard in reserve, and promises them that they will all make it through and go home. Precision weapons save their unit when the enemy is \"danger close\". Shupp orders his men only to fire in self-defense after the enemy surrenders. Indeed, another news reporter voices over video of long lines of Iraqi prisoners of war who had been forced to fight with death squads and land mines to prevent desertion.\nGuy Hunter, Jr., gets tortured again after a coalition strike that scares him, and probably did more than scare his captors. Threatened with execution and blindfolded, Hunter shows no fear, and says \"just do it.\"\nMeanwhile, Beverly Clark is winning at trivia, but pauses long enough to get a soda and chat with her best friend Mary Rhoads. Beverly tells Mary she has come to peace about being deployed in a danger zone, and Mary invites Beverly to join her for fresh air, though Beverly declines. Suddenly there is a Scud alarm. Mary starts putting on chemical warfare gear, and Beverly instructs others to do the same. However, the Patriot is not successful in annihilating the Scud, and Mary watches in horror as Beverly and her comrades are hit by the incoming warhead. Another news reporter voice-over with video of the aftermath.\nIt is not long before the Clarks in Pennsylvania are summoned to Army Reserve headquarters, where a tactful notification of families is under way, but taking too long for the Clark parents. Beverly's mother found out what her husband, weeping in the senior officer's office, already heard from him, and despite her initial denial, she understands the truth.\nAlston and Shaefer get their medals when they volunteer to kill an Iraqi suicide squad ready to detonate an ammunition dump in the way of U.S. forces in Objective Utah, western Kuwait, and overcome various dangers including land mines and trip wires. Shaefer distracts the squad with his M-16 while Alston, above the trench, tosses in a hand grenade. \nThe Basra-Kuwait \"Highway of Death\" is depicted next with more videos and voice-overs, indicating that the intent is not to destroy, but to disable the Iraqi retreat. Nevertheless, in contrast to the funeral of Beverly Clark in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of death exists on the Highway for a U.S. Army chaplain, announced by the newscaster as a rabbi, to provide appropriate Muslim rights for.  \nBy now, Hunter has been reunited with other American POWs, including Larry Slade: when one hugs Hunter, it is evident the Iraqis broke his ribs. When the Iraqis come back, they come back with cheap perfume. Hunter challenges the captors, and enraged, one threatens to shoot him, but Hunter is not going to give them the satisfaction of showing fear this time either. He replies, \"God bless America.\"\nThe U.S. troops return home to widespread jubilation, including one Linda Buckholz in her wedding gown. The celebration contrasts with Phoebe Jeter at the grave site of her grandmother.\nFinally, President George Herbert Walker Bush gives an address celebrating the defeat of aggression and the restoration of Kuwait to its people."}, "33270548": {"title": "Hi Honey \u2013 I'm Dead", "plot": "Brad Stadler is a dishonest real estate developer who spends too much time at work.

While she is waiting, Rebeca recalls incidents from her early life when her mother, preoccupied with her career and romantic life, neglected and rejected her.\nRebeca has since become a newsreader for a television station owned by her husband Manuel. The intensity of the family reunion is heightened because, many years ago, Manuel was one of Becky's lovers. On the night of her return, Becky, Rebeca and Manuel have supper and then go out to see Letal, a female impersonator whose drag act is based on Becky. For some time, Rebeca has been coming to see the concerts whenever she misses her mother. Backstage, Rebeca helps Letal to remove his costume and, kneeling in front of him, she is impressed by his manhood. Letal takes advantage of the situation and they make love. Manuel, who no longer loves his wife, wants to sleep with Becky again and divorce Rebeca.\nA month later, Manuel is murdered in his villa. He had spent the evening first with his mistress Isabel (also Rebeca's sign language interpreter on the news) and then with Becky who, having become his lover again, had come to announce it was over between them because she had learnt about his other mistress. It was Rebeca who discovered the body. The investigating magistrate, Judge Dom\u00ednguez, knows that their relationship has not recovered since Rebeca found out Becky was seeing Manuel, and centres his suspicions on both mother and daughter.\nOn the day of Manuel's funeral, Rebeca confesses to his murder live on television, while reading the news. She is immediately imprisoned, but the investigating judge seems desperate to prove her innocence despite all the evidence. Becky makes her return to the Madrid stage while Rebeca spends her first night in prison. In jail, she listens on the radio as her mother dedicates the first songs of her triumphant concert performance to Rebeca. A social worker, Paula, takes a special interest in Rebeca; like her, she is heartbroken, grieving the loss of her boyfriend Hugo. Rebeca sees a nude picture of Hugo that Paula carries with her, and thinks that Letal and Hugo are the same person.\nThe judge arranges for Becky to see her daughter, and Rebeca now denies the murder of Manuel. Mother and daughter confess their lack of love, their jealousy, and their secrets to each other. Rebeca draws a comparison between herself and the daughter in the film Autumn Sonata, in which the girl's mother, an outstanding pianist, asks her to play the piano and then humiliates her by telling her how to improve her performance. Rebeca suggests that she too has always felt inferior to Becky, and has been forced to compete with her, winning only once by marrying Manuel. But even this victory was finally denied her, when Becky started an affair with Manuel. Rebeca admits that fifteen years ago, her desire to be closer to Becky led her to murder her stepfather, and also played some part in her murder of Manuel, whom she saw as usurping her mother's affection. The extent of Rebeca's fixation and the limitlessness of her adoration are too much for Becky's frail heart, and her condition worsens. Back in prison, Rebeca discovers she is pregnant \u2013 carrying Letal's child. At once, the judge releases her from prison despite the lack of any fresh evidence.\nRebeca goes to see Letal's final drag performance. In the dressing room, she discovers that he is the judge, with Letal being one of his disguises and Hugo being another. He explains that his dressing up was just an investigative strategy and, knowing about her pregnancy, asks her to marry him. As Rebeca struggles to take this in, they see a television broadcast relating to Becky's sudden heart attack. They rush to the hospital, where Rebeca confesses to murdering Manuel, but Becky decides to take the blame in order for her daughter to go free. When Becky is taken home to die, Rebeca gives her the gun and Becky leaves her fingerprints on it, thereby incriminating herself and establishing Rebeca's innocence.

He refuses to keep pets because he feels they would \"turn on you\" in a food shortage, choosing instead to keep a cardboard cutout of a dog named Pete.\nA number of minor annoyances also perturb him throughout the day: a fly lands on his cereal at breakfast, which he inadvertently eats; an insurance salesman named Ray comes to the door, to which Furrows responds by feigning interest and, shortly after promising to take out a number of policies, slams the door in Ray's face with the words \"I'd rather be dead\"; an automated survey about carpet cleaning calls him repeatedly; his boss' wife comes by to pick up a book he was writing, and he (eventually) tells her off.

A letter from his brother-in-law Takashi Yabe, a junior high school teacher, tells of his discovery of an ancient tomb built to seal an evil spirit (y\u014dkai).  Yabe and one of his students, Reiko Tsukishima, investigate the burial mound but mysteriously disappear.  Hieda arrives in town to look into the matter.  Yabe's son, Masao, searches for his father in the school during summer vacation and sees a returned Reiko at the schoolhouse, seemingly seducing his gardening classmate Kono. Masao finds himself afflicted with mysterious incidents where his back seemingly heats up and emits smoke; small blackened faces of the dead appear on his back during these fits.  Masao and Hieda search the schoolhouse with Hieda's array of gadgets; both Kono and Masao's friends Aoi and Katagiri are found horrifically murdered by a switchblade.  The nephew and uncle pair initially suspects the suspicious janitor, Watanabe, who had tried to keep people away from the schoolhouse, but soon realize that the disembodied singing head of Reiko is at fault.\nHieda discovers the elder Yabe's notebook, where he learns that a y\u014dkai named Hiruko was sealed away in the tomb.  He believes Hiruko is at fault for the recent incidents, and sets out to learn the spells to open and close the way into the burial mound sanctum.  Watanabe, who had earlier cut the power lines to the schoolhouse, attacks the pair, though Masao successfully takes his gun in the struggle.  Back at the schoolhouse again, the pair encounter Reiko, whose head is now mounted on spider-legs.  Watanabe attacks Hieda, while Reiko attacks Masao.  After escaping from the schoolhouse, Reiko gains insect-like wings and the four have another scuffle, although Reiko escapes after being repelled by bug spray.  Watanabe explains that as a child, he knew Tatsuhiko Yabe, Masao's grandfather.  Tatsuhiko also bore the scars of dead men's heads on his back, and somehow sealed the gate 60 years ago; he swore Watanabe to guard the schoolhouse after his death to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy.  The group realizes that Masao's father reached the interior of the chamber, but was betrayed.  The \"crown\" with which to seal Hiruko, a missing Yabe family treasure, had likely been taken by Takashi and was likely still in the sealed chamber.

Inside, the pair find the sealed yokai, the crown (which appears a normal helmet), as well as Masao's father.  The elder Yabe had become a spider-head abomination as well, however.  As the two escape, they find Reiko and her transformed victims seemingly waiting to block their exit - but the victims instead let them pass, enter the tomb, and hold off the others while Hieda uses the incantation to close the gate.  The pair believe they have finished, but Reiko had somehow snuck onto Hieda's back, and she uses the opportunity to grab onto his face and influence him to open the gate again using memories of his dead wife.

He deliberately interfered with the militarily necessary demolition of the dry dock at Hampton Roads Naval Base to prevent collateral damage and civilian casualties, as Confederates overran the base.\nHarmon is introduced to Miss Betty Stuart, a Virginia belle educated in Baltimore who wishes to help Harmon spy on the Confederate States Navy at Gosport on the raised and refitted Merrimack, now the ironclad Virginia. Once in the South, Harmon encounters many key naval officers and learns that the armor test on 3 inches (76 mm) of iron plate is staged to offer misinformation to any Union spies\u2014like him. In reality, the Virginia boasts 4 inches (100 mm) of armor and cannot be pierced by any Union guns. Harmon and Betty realize that this information must make it to Washington, D.C. to improve firepower to sink Virginia.\nHowever, Betty has a change of heart upon learning that her childhood friend and lover, Lieutenant Catesby ap Roger Jones, has been reassigned as the second-in-command of Virginia and is now in danger of death due to the very intelligence she intended to send North. She tries to stop Harmon from going north with the intelligence, but he goes anyway. At the commissioning ceremony for Virginia, she confesses to her now-fianc\u00e9 Lt. Jones that she had helped Leslie Harmon infiltrate the shipyard and spy for the Union, warning him of the possible increase in firepower. He is stunned and distraught at her betrayal, yet sails to war without turning her in as one final act of love for his traitorous fianc\u00e9. Virginia sails off to break the Union blockade at Hampton Roads. Betty is promptly arrested by Lt. Guilford (Philip Casnoff), an admiral's aide and spy hunter, on suspicion of espionage.\nVirginia first approaches USS Congress as her skipper, Lt. Smith, rallies his men on board to do their duty.  Captain Franklin Buchanan (Leon B. Stevens) of Virginia rallies his men similarly. Congress fires a full broadside into Virginia to no effect.  In the ensuing action, Virginia bypasses Congress, promptly sinks USS Cumberland, and returns to sink Congress. Lt. Smith is killed; taking over command, executive officer Lt. Pendergrast orders the ship's surrender. Though Virginia's crew are jubilant, rifle fire from Union troops ashore enrages Captain Buchanan. He goes topside to return fire and is wounded, thereupon ordering Jones to assume command and set Congress ablaze.\nThat same night, Lt. Guilford interrogates Betty, who denies being a spy based on an intercepted letter to her from Lt. Smith. She is informed then of Smith's death aboard Congress. When informed that her fate is the gallows if she does not cooperate, she hopes for the courtesy and respect shown an executed spy the day before (whose hanging she witnessed). Lt. Guilford rebuffs her, showing his contempt for her treason when compared to the bravery of the hanged soldier who was honorably fighting for his side.\nDuring the night, Monitor sails in between the burning Congress and Virginia to protect USS Minnesota, which has run aground and is defenseless until high tide returns the next day. Only the low tide has prevented Virginia from finishing off Minnesota immediately. Captain Van Brunt (Joel Abel) delivers orders to Captain John Worden (Andy Park) of Monitor, along with Leslie Harmon, who has volunteered his service as a pilot. Worden makes Harmon, familiar with Hampton Roads and CSS Virginia, midshipman on the spot.\nThe morning of the second day of battle, Jones sights Monitor and describes her as \"the test we face.\" Worden does his best to engage Virginia as far from Minnesota as he can, aided by Monitor's shallower draft, greater maneuverability, and the damage sustained by Virginia the previous day. As the two ships exchange fire, Virginia runs aground, but is able to pull free. Jones attempts to ram the Monitor but fails to do significant damage; Worden orders a return ramming attempt, but is blinded when a shell from Virginia strikes Monitor's pilot house. Monitor withdraws, having delayed Virginia from sinking Minnesota. In view of the damage to Virginia, the exhaustion of his crew, and the falling tide, Jones also decides to retire back to port.\nBoth sides claim victory, although the Monitor saved the rest of the blockade from destruction. Her designer, John Ericsson (Fritz Weaver), has an argument with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles (Conrad McLaren) over the use of insufficient powder in Monitor's guns to sink Virginia: Welles's officers respond that it was a calculated decision to prevent the guns from exploding and protect the lives of the crew.\nBack at Gosport, Lt. Guilford is pleased to release Betty, informing her that she saved Virginia based on a report by Lt. Jones. Demonstrating Southern chivalry, he was pleased to not have to hang her. In reality, Lt. Jones used Betty's confession the day before to send false intelligence to the Union, which resulted in the lesser powder charges used by Monitor. Lt. Jones tells Betty that he couldn't bear to see her hang, but that he can never be with her again due to her treasonous actions.

Former US marine and suspected Soviet defector Lee Harvey Oswald is arrested for the murder of police officer J. D. Tippit and arraigned with both murders but is killed by nightclub owner Jack Ruby. New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison and his team investigate potential New Orleans links to the JFK assassination, including private pilot David Ferrie, but their investigation is publicly rebuked by the federal government and Garrison closes the investigation.\nThe investigation is reopened in 1966 after Garrison reads the Warren Report and notices what he believes to be multiple inaccuracies. Garrison and his staff interrogate people involved with Oswald and Ferrie. One such witness is Willie O'Keefe, a male prostitute serving five years in prison for solicitation, who says that he witnessed Ferrie talking with a man called \"Clay Bertrand\" about assassinating Kennedy, and that he briefly met Oswald. Garrison and his team theorize Oswald was an agent of the CIA and was framed for the assassination.\nIn 1967, Garrison and his team talk to several witnesses, including Jean Hill, a teacher who says she witnessed a gunman shooting from the \"grassy knoll\", a small hill, that Secret Service threatened her into saying three shots came from the Texas School Book Depository from which Oswald was said to have shot Kennedy, and her testimony was altered by the Warren Commission.

Maria is taken aback by Dante's striking resemblance to her husband Johnny Stecchino, an Italian mobster wanted by the Sicilian Mafia for killing mobster Cozzamara's wife and despised by the locals of Palermo for treason.\nDuring the day, Dante works in Cesena as a bus driver for students with Down syndrome, defrauds the government into receiving disability payments for a faked disability, and steals bananas from greengrocers. Dante's best friend is Lillo, a student with Down syndrome and diabetes, whom he has to constantly deter from eating sweets.\nDante runs into Maria a second time near his apartment. Maria, unbeknownst to him, has tracked him down in a plan to turn him over to the Sicilian mafia so they can kill him, thinking that he is Stecchino. Maria begins to make Dante's appearance more identical to Stecchino, by dressing him in a similar suit and tie, placing a faux mole on his face and convincing him to have a toothpick in his mouth at all times ('stecchino' is toothpick in Italian). Maria then begins to call him 'Johnny' or Johnny Stecchino. She later invites Dante to her residence in Palermo where she begins to plan his murder so she and the real Johnny Stecchino can escape to South America.\nUpon arriving at the train station, Dante meets Maria's 'uncle', a cocaine addict who convinces Dante the drug is a cure for diabetes. While attempting to steal a banana from local greengrocer Nicola Travaglia, mobsters spot Dante and, confusing him for Stecchino, begin shooting at him. He dodges the hail of bullets, running to the police station where he relates his understanding of the incident to the police chief (that after he stole a banana, the greengrocer had guards try to shoot him for theft). Bewildered by the story, the chief tells him that he has committed a serious crime, but by confessing and turning in the banana, he will be forgiven.\nAfter leaving the police station, Dante runs into Judge Cataratta who, mistaking Dante for Stecchino, questions his motives in confessing to the police and turning over evidence. Cataratta advises him to forcefully take back the evidence and demand the chief print the story on the front page of newspapers, denouncing his confession. Maria finds Dante strolling through the streets unharmed, and though surprised, returns with him to her residence. Stecchino's belief that Dante bears no resemblance to him is only reinforced upon hearing that Dante spent the morning in Palermo going unnoticed by locals.\nAs a final attempt to determine if the public will mistake him for Stecchino, Maria takes Dante to an opera. Upon arriving, Dante sees fruit sold at a concession stand. The vendor offers him a banana, but Dante tries to pay, fearful of the earlier uproar. While waiting for the show to commence, the crowd interrupts the show, beginning to jeer Dante, thinking he is Stecchino, which Dante confuses as a public reprimand for not paying for the banana. When the crowd begins to shame Maria as an accomplice, Dante shouts down all the hecklers to respect her honor. He is escorted by the police to a private party where he meets a politician, an accomplice of Stecchino, who will protect him if they keep their meeting a secret. As a gift, he gives Dante a bag of cocaine. Maria meets up with Dante and both retreat back to her residence. The next day, Maria meets Cozzamara to plan the assassination of Johnny Stecchino.\nOn the day of the planned hit, Maria learns of Stecchino's plan to kill her 'uncle' after Dante has been killed, upsetting news to Maria. She drops off Dante at a barbershop owned by Cozzamara. Cozzamara's men begin to suspect Dante is not Stecchino when they notice the faux facial mole, and they ask him about his mother, a question which would have upset Stecchino (his mother is deceased and he gets very angry when someone discusses her), to which Dante replies \"she is okay\". Maria ends up setting up Stecchino by kissing him at a gas station, an act which he despises, and he in turn goes to use the men's room to wash his face. While using one of the urinals, several armed Sicilian mobsters come out of the stalls to seal his doom. Stecchino realizes Maria's plot and reluctantly accepts his fate.

It was self-defense, but a witness intends to frame them both for kidnapping and murder.\nFrank explains what happened: Willie, his wife Joy (Marcia Gay Harden), and little daughter Jess (Cassy Friel) live a happy life in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Joy's brother, Frank, lives with them. Willie lost his job at the milk company, and they have fallen behind in house payments. They learn the bank intends to foreclose, so Willie pays a visit to the banker, Bob Freeman (Peter Gallagher), to show that he made up the back payments with funds borrowed from relatives. Freeman takes Willie's receipt and burns it, then offers to buy his house for less than it's worth. He is building a huge, new home development in the area, and he needs all the land in Willie's neighborhood to do it. Willie refuses to undersell or to bow to pressure, and destroys an expensive chair and rug before storming out of the office. That's the last straw for Freeman, and he vows revenge.\nOn the drive home, Willie discovers Frank \"borrowed\" Freeman's little boy, Donald (Ross Malinger), because Frank realized the boy was being emotionally abused by his father. He pleads to Willie to let him keep Donald, as he is small and won't eat much. When they get home, Joy convinces Willie they have to accept the lowball offer and just get out while they can. Willie calls Freeman to tell him that he will accept his offer after all, and that, by the way, his son had somehow \"wedged himself into the back seat\" of his car. Realizing this is his chance to get what he wants, Freeman accuses Willie of kidnapping. They agree to meet in the desert just outside town, Willie believing it is only to return the boy and to get the $9,000 Freeman offered for his house.\nOnce they are face to face, Freeman produces an envelope filled with $15,000, intending to make this look like a ransom exchange. Freeman and his henchman then both pull guns, right in front of little Donald, as Freeman admits he was the one who got Willie fired from his job so he would be unable to pay his mortgage, making it possible for him to buy the house for a low price. He is confident Donald will tell the police whatever he says to tell them, and as he aims his gun, Willie jumps Freeman, and the henchman shoots Willie in the shoulder. Freeman reaches for the gun, but Frank tackles him and knocks him out. The henchman aims his gun at Frank, but Willie manages to shoot the man in the chest. It was self-defense, but they know Freeman will claim otherwise. They have to leave Donald there and take off before the police arrive, whom Freeman called before he got there. They try to stop at home first, but they can see police cars are already there. Willie's little daughter sees them coming, and silently shakes her head to tell them not to stop, so, sadly, they drive away. They don't realize this is the last time they may ever see Joy and Jess.\nAfter escaping for hours through the desert, they come across Dr. Dan Chilblains (Bo Brundin) in Pomona, California. Willie has passed out, but the doctor fixes up his wound, and discovers that Frank has glomerulonephritis, which will eventually kill him. Chilblains has invented a procedure that can freeze a human being without killing him, and convinces Frank to let him freeze them both until Frank can be treated for kidney disease \u2013 maybe even get a new kidney (a procedure that is not widely known in 1962) \u2013 and to hide them from the police. Excited by the prospect of being cured, Frank agrees, and assumes the unconscious Willie will be okay with it. The doctor allows Frank to think it's just like sleeping, and it will only be for a little while. He sedates them, then Chilblains' colleagues show up, and reluctantly help him prepare the men for the cryogenic process.\nTwenty-nine years later, in 1991, a truck crashes, destroying and flooding the cryogenic storage facility, and causing the tanks storing the two men to burst open. Willie and Frank, in body bags, are revived by floating in electrified water. Suddenly regaining consciousness, they escape from the bags, freezing, wet, and feeling confused. Once they get their wits about them, they decide they need to get back to Santa Fe, assuming Joy and Jess will be there waiting. Dr. Chilblains left them clothing, $100, and a note that doesn't really explain much. They are starving and go to buy food. The culture shock, high prices, and modern technology are amazing and overwhelming to them. Frank realizes he needs his medication, so they visit a hospital, which is where they finally learn the date and what actually happened to them.\nThey manage to get back to Santa Fe and track down Willie's daughter, Jess (Colleen Flynn), who is now grown up with \"her own telephone number\u2026 her own house.\" Seeing Jess all grown up, only now does Frank accept that so much time has passed. Once she calms down, she explains to Willie that Joy had to move on; she married someone else, but is now divorced, because her second husband just didn't measure up to the standard set by her first husband. She also told him that Joy stood up to Freeman; she managed to keep their home, and she exposed Freeman's scam. Freeman then went away and built half of Phoenix, and eventually someone murdered him.\nWillie and Jess leave Frank at her house, and go to Joy's house to meet her. While they're gone, Frank meets Jess' husband, who turns out to be Donald Freeman (Richard Steinmetz). At Joy's house, Jess makes her sit down and listen to Willie explain, but to keep her back turned and not look at him.

To add to the look, Bolt has his mustache shaved off, then Crasswell confiscates his toupee and rips his jacket chest pocket. Bolt is taken to the slums, thrown out of the limo and begins the bet. Unbeknown to Bolt, Crasswell schemes to make Goddard's stay on the streets as bad as possible. Bolt, homeless, hungry and filthy, is befriended by skid-row inhabitants like Sailor (Howard Morris) and Fumes (Theodore Wilson) and given the nickname \"Pepto\" after falling asleep in a crate with a Pepto-Bismol logo on its side, having used the crate to urinate on mere moments before Sailor arrives.\nDuring the bet, he meets and eventually becomes attracted to Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a homeless woman who used to be a dancer on Broadway. During a scuffle with two muggers (including a chase through a Chinese kitchen/restaurant), Bolt is pushed out of bounds, which activates his anklet. To prevent the \"30-second forfeiture\", Bolt rushes back in, which impresses Molly with his supposed bravery, as it looks like he is tackling the muggers. The muggers are eventually defeated via a pot of boiling stock being poured over them from a height, forcing them to retreat their assault on Bolt.\nBolt learns a series of important life lessons during his 'adventure', namely that life is not about accomplishments or material success, but rather the integrity of the human spirit. However, Bolt is unaware that the unscrupulous Crasswell has no intention of honoring their bet. When Crasswell realizes that Bolt is honoring the bet fair and square, Crasswell bribes Bolt's lawyers into fabricating the story that Bolt had lost his mind and has his property seized. Bolt finds this out first hand as, upon completing the bet, he forces his way into a party which is being held by Crasswell at Bolt's home and his lawyers feign ignorance.\nForced to live on the streets for good and remanded to a free clinic by mistake, a drugged Bolt murmurs that \"life stinks\". Molly implores him to remember the small things, such as the two of them waltzing, that make life livable. Crasswell, meanwhile, has his own plans for the slum area, planning to tear it down as well. Bolt incites Fumes and the other slum residents to stage a mock battle during the televised ceremony of Crasswell demolishing the slum area. Realising that he will be ousted, Crasswell attempts to stop Bolt with a hydraulic excavator. When Bolt's grapple has plucked Crasswell and has him hanging by his jacket, the scene is freeze-framed into a news report saying that Crasswell, in a court case, was forced to admit he made a bet with Bolt, then reneged on the terms.\nBolt, now in control of the area, has plans to renovate it into the \"Bolt Center\", which will give the slum residents employment, renovate the tenements into livable homes, and give the children a private school financed entirely out of pocket by Goddard Bolt. The news report ends by saying that Bolt has married Molly, and the press are expecting an extravagant CEO-type event, only to then be shown Goddard and Molly taking their wedding vows in a simple chapel in the slum area, then driving off in a limousine with a vanity plate \"PEPTO\".", "tmdb_id": 6524}, "59382099": {"title": "Line of Fire: The Morris Dees Story", "plot": "Based on the true story of Morris Dees, a civil rights lawyer from Alabama, whose Southern Poverty Law Center battles neo-Nazis and the Ku Klux Klan.", "tmdb_id": 496741}, "2777580": {"title": "The Linguini Incident", "plot": "A British bartender, Monte (David Bowie), wishes to marry a waitress at the restaurant he works, ostensibly so he can get his green card.

Lyon escapes the Legion in a daring breakout and sets off across the desert, until he reaches a dockyard on the coast, where he finds work aboard a tramp steamer headed for the United States. Lyon's Legion Commander, anticipating his destination, sends two of his own men to Los Angeles to bring Lyon back to meet court-martial.\nArriving in New York City with no money to cross the country to Los Angeles, Lyon is attracted to an illegal street fight being run by a tramp named Joshua Eldridge. He volunteers for the next fight and easily defeats his opponent. Impressed, Joshua takes Lyon to meet Cynthia Caldera, an unscrupulous organizer of underground fights for the rich elite. Cynthia agrees to sponsor Lyon, dubbing him \"Lionheart\" and setting him up in a no-holds-barred fight against Sonny, a fighter known for heavily taunting his opponents. Lyon defeats Sonny easily, then leaves with Joshua to find a phone booth to call H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, fending off an attack by a local street gang of punks. Joshua calls in a favor from Cynthia, who gets them both across the States to Los Angeles.\nBy the time Lyon reaches the hospital, his brother has died. Though his murderers were apprehended, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was left penniless, with a stack of unpaid medical bills and little daughter Nicole to look after. Lyon and Joshua track down H\u00e9l\u00e8ne's address, but as Lyon tries to speak to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, she angrily rejects his offers for much needed financial help, admonishing Lyon for deserting his brother and unjustly blaming him for her late husband's involvement in the drug business.\nLyon decides to help H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Nicole without their knowledge. Through Cynthia, he joins the local street fighting circuit and has the profits delivered to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in the form of checks, with Joshua claiming that her husband subscribed to life insurance prior to his death. Lyon defeats a number of high-profile fighters, including a dirty-fighting Scotsman, a wrestler in a squash court, and a martial artist in a shallow swimming pool. Seeing as Lyon is not keeping his winnings and spurns her advances, Cynthia grows suspicious of Lyon and jealous towards H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and puts her assistant Russell on Lyon's trail.

Cynthia agrees to hand Lyon over to the Legionnaires after the fight. In order to skew the odds, she shows potential bettors an altered tape of Attila which makes him look like a poor fighter, while she bets her entire fortune on Attila. Realizing Lyon is hurt, Joshua unsuccessfully tries to talk him out of the fight.\nAs the fight proceeds, Attila recognizes Lyon's rib wound and takes full advantage of it. When Attila appears to have won after repeatedly knocking down his opponent, Joshua begs Lyon to give up the fight and offers to split the winnings from his own bet against Lyon. This angers Lyon, who summons his remaining strength to defeat Attila with a series of kicks, knee blows and brutal punches. Lyon pummels Attila senseless but spares him, leaving Cynthia with a big debt and his family cared for with his own winning stake.

The conflict escalates to a very large extent and Anita, with Narsimha's help, was successful in rousing local help and mob support against Bapji's Oppressive and illegal rule. Bapji tries all the tricks in the book to curb this rising opposition using his goons, muscle men etc. but is thwarted every time by Narsimha. Narsimha even kills Bapji's famous wrestlers in Bapji's private court in front of the entire city and showed the whole city that Bapji was afraid for the first time and hence they need not obey Bapji from now on. Bapji was later arrested by police due to his illegal activities after being pressured by the people of the city led by Narsimha and Anita. While being taken by the police, Bapji was humiliated by the people of the city who were fed up with his long tyranny and oppression. However, later he gets released on bail using his money and employing the best lawyers.\nBapji forcibly decides to marry Meenu and locks her up. He finally captures Narsimha and brings him to his palace. There Bapji informs Narsimha that it was him, who planned the communal riot which killed Narsimha's family since riots were necessary to keep the mob afraid and weak and hence aided Bapji in controlling the entire city. He then stabs a fuming Narsimha in his abdomen using his sword and wounds him fatally. Then he orders his men to bury a half-dead Narsimha inside a pillar of his palace and plaster it up. Next morning, when he tries to forcibly wed Meenu, Anita and Ravi arrive with their friends to stop the wedding. However, Bapji releases the prisoners of the jail and hands them weapons to control the mob. When Meenu refuses to marry and instead comes to Ravi, Bapji orders both Meenu and Ravi to be plastered alive in his palace wall while their helpless friends watch being guarded over by armed criminals and prisoners freed by Bapji. Suddenly, a wounded Narsimha breaks the pillar inside which he was plastered up, thus fulfilling his name which is synonymous to the fourth reincarnation or avatar of Lord Vishnu who broke out of the pillar to kill the demon Hiranyakshapu when called by Hiranyakshapu's pious son Prahlad. Similar to Lord Vishnu's 4th avatar, Narsimha breaks out from the pillar and takes on the goons of Bapji while his friends and people also join hands to help Narsimha. He vanquishes the goons with the help of his friends and rescues Meenu and Ravi by breaking the wall in which they were plastered up. Breaking of the pillar and walls by Narsimha disturbs the foundation of the palace and its roof and other walls start crumbling down. Lastly, Bapji gets killed by the arms of the tower clock of his palace which breaks down and falls on him. Ravi and Meenu are together now.

After winning consecutive conference and national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit years' worth of victories. All of the coaches were fired and all of the players are banned from returning and expelled from college except Charlie Banks, the only \"clean\" player, who never got to play despite having \"heart\".\nThis move forces new head coach Ed \"Straight Arrow\" Gennero (Elizondo) to build an almost entirely new team with little assistance. No athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Phillip Elias (Miller), the dean of the university, who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it due to the corruption the football program has caused over the years, and funnel the funding into his own pocket. The coaches soon have a makeshift team in place.\nDue to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible because of poor grades, only 17 players are allowed on the team\u2014not enough for separate offensive and defensive squads. The Armadillos are thus forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally \"Rig\" Riggendorf (Loggia) finds Paul Blake (Bakula), a 34-year-old high school star who never attended college due to his father's death. Rig convinces him to enroll and become the Armadillos' quarterback.\nBlake arrives on campus and catches everyone's attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter (Kozak). Blake then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm (Sinbad), who is also enrolled at the school and still has some eligibility remaining. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team is unable to win.\nCarter tells Blake that she knows him from 16 years earlier. Carter's ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a 1975 championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship which Dean Elias opposes due to their student-teacher dynamic\u2014not to mention Elias' own lascivious interest in Carter.\nCoach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper (Ireland) from the school's women's soccer team.  When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3\u20133 tie with Kansas (in real life, Kansas holds the all-time NCAA Division I-A record for number of tie games with 57). After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with Gennero and Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate Edison, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. Dean Elias barges into Carter's office after end-of-term exams, first coming onto her as a distraction from him tampering with the team's grades (to sabotage their eligibility for the final game), but she plays along momentarily before warning him that if one grade changes, she'll report him to the University President.\nWith the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the state of Texas, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Gennero, who is hospitalized just before the game for a potential heart attack, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they rally in the second half to cut the deficit to one, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from \nindigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. Minutes before the final touchdown, after learning about his scheme to get rid of the football program (and his sexual harassment of Carter), TSU president Purcell fires Dean Elias, though not before the entire Armadillo defensive line runs him down.

This introductory scene establishes that Monika is not simply the local gravedigger. The body snatcher is depicted with a particularly feminine appearance: red nail polish on her fingernails, pencil skirt and polka dot blouse. Monika apparently evades notice while carrying Rob's corpse into her apartment, where she unwraps him from his body bag. Images of tabloid headlines inform viewers of the source of Monika's knowledge of Rob and his activities. Meanwhile, Mark (Mark Reeder) heads to his as-yet-unspecified job, and the film then cuts back to a scene of Monika undressing Rob. Mark's job is thereupon revealed to be dubbing porn films, and this scene foreshadows the next, in which Monika has sex with Rob's corpse. Betty (Beatrice Manowski), Rob's ex-girlfriend from the previous film, is then briefly introduced as she discovers, to her disappointment, that Rob's grave has already been robbed.\nMonika fails to have an orgasm and the sex scene ends with her running to the bathroom. She is disgusted, and about to vomit. The implication is that \"the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak\". Once Monika has cleaned Rob's corpse, she takes photos with him using her camera's self-timer. She is seen cuddling the corpse in the photos. Mark, meanwhile, makes plans to meet a friend (Simone Sp\u00f6rl) at the movie theater. Mark's friend, however, is late, and Mark offers his ticket instead to Monika, a stranger who happens to be passing by. Monika and Mark hit it off and soon go on a carnival date, after which point Monika decides to break up with Rob. She is apparently attempting to live a normal life with a real boyfriend.She tearfully saws the corpse of Rob into pieces and putting them into garbage bags, saving just his head and genitals. She then disposes of the garbage bags. She keeps the genitals in her fridge. The next scene depicts Monika and Mark in her apartment. She is showing him a photograph album, containing images of several dead relatives, sometimes in their coffins. The two end up having sex, though the experience is less than satisfying for Monika. Mark subsequently spends the night at Monika's, and, through a morning raid of her refrigerator, Mark discovers Rob's genitals. This discovery, combined with Monika's desire to photograph Mark in positions that make him appear dead, plants doubts in his mind about the relationship. He does not dare express these doubts to her. Consequently, Mark consults first his perennially tardy friend and then a drunk in a bar regarding his relationship with the perverse Monika.\nSoon thereafter, Monika and her fellow necrophiliac friends have a movie night at Monika's apartment, suggesting that she is part of a network of people with similar interests. The film they are watching depicts the dissection of a seal. Positioned on the coffee table during their viewing experience is Rob's severed head. Mark unexpectedly drops by, bringing a pizza. This brings the movie night to a premature end, with Monika hiding the severed head and her friends leaving. When Mark insistently asks what Monika and her friends had been doing, she reluctantly shows him the seal video. The images both disgust and enrage Mark, who says it's perverse to watch such a thing for fun, leading to a quarrel.The couple later speak on the phone and makes plans to meet at Monika's and discuss the matter. In the meantime, Monika makes a trip to the ocean, where she contemplates what course of action to take.

She finds it beautiful and decides to keep it. The same night in her hotel room, when all her friends have gone for dinner, Bhama takes it out and keeps it on her bed. The sculpture magically turns into a young man (Nitish Bharadwaj), who passionately kisses Bhama. Bhama is attracted to him, but he vanishes. At her study leave, while preparing for examinations, Bhama again feels his presence. She moves towards a tree but is stunned to find a beautiful blue butterfly. She hears his voice in the air, introducing himself as a gandharva who has developed a particular liking for her. At her request, he appears in front of her like a normal man. The gandharva asks her to call him Devan and she falls in love with him.\n\nBhama asks her grandmother (Philomina) about gandharvas.  Gandharvas, according to Hindu mythology, are celestial musicians and Soma providers in Devaloka, and are destined to entertain devas and lords. They are born from the sweat (or breath) of Lord Brahma and have no death, with the ability to change the form or appear anywhere at will. When gandharvas commit crimes, they are cursed to roam the earth for several kalpas, inhabiting Paala trees, seducing mortal women and stealing their virginity before abandoning them. Bhama asks Devan if he would ever desert her, to which he replies that he is just a slave of Lord Indra and has no power to remember the past once he leaves the earth. But Devan assures her that he will stay back and would never return to Devaloka. Devan hands her a diamond named Rudhiraksham, which is holy and divine. He adds that whenever she feels like seeing him, she just has to kiss it.\nMeanwhile, Pradeep (Ganeshan), Bhama's fianc\u00e9, is desperately trying to woo her, and she flatly refuses. He finds Devan and Bhama together at restaurants and parks, which he reports to her mother (Sulakshana). One day, Devan makes a surprise visit to Bhama's house and stuns her. With his magical talent in music, he wins the hearts of both her mother and her grandmother. Both now are willing to see her married to him.\nEverything seems to be going fine, when one evening, Devan loses his voice. A voice (Padmarajan) speaks to Devan from the fallen branch of the Paala tree, whose sap starts to bring forth blood, warning him that he has broken the laws of Devaloka and that he is to be punished for his crimes by Chitraradhan, who is the king of the celestial city of the gandharvas. Devan and Bhama frantically try to run away from the situation but in vain. As he is about to be taken away from Bhama, Devan motions to Bhama to not summon him with the holy Rudhiraksham again. A lost and gloomy Bhama pines for her beloved in the forthcoming period, which worries her family, making them agree to her marrying Devan, assuming that that would make her happy. However, when her father (M. G. Soman) asks her to request Devan to bring his parents so that their marriage may be fixed, Bhama finds herself in a quandary.  Left without a choice, she is forced to violate Devan's warning and summon him with the Rudhiraksham. Devan does not appear before her; instead, Bhama perceives the terrible lashes that are being meted out as punishment to the gandharvan.\nMore than a week passes, and one night Bhama finds, to her joy, that Devan has returned to her. Devan informs Bhama that he had to undergo cruel tortures in the halls of Chitraradhan's celestial palace for seven nights and seven days. While gandharva is not supposed to come in daylight and is not permitted to meet human beings other than his lover, Devan had broken the law by appearing in public and singing songs for others.\nSuddenly, strong winds blow at the couple. As the winds die down, a burning celestial handcuff falls onto Devan's forearm and as he painfully manages to remove it, the Divine Creator and the gandharvas' celestial father, Lord Brahma (Narendra Prasad), speaks to the gandharvan, informing him that he and his crimes, which includes his persistence in desiring the lowly mortality of earth, have once again been discovered. Lord Brahma also warns him that the harsh punishments of Indra, lord of the devas, await him in Naraka (hell), including having to embrace and sleep with molten hot female figurines, each one representing a moment he spends with Bhama that night, among other tortures in hells filled with snakes, poisoned spears and floors slipping with blood.  Lord Brahma informs his son that he is now forbidden from all sunlit days and moonlit nights for all time to come and that the holy Rudhiraksham which he had given Bhama will turn into powerless white dust, which Bhama immediately confirms to be true, to her utter horror. The only way for him to alleviate some of the gravity of his punishment is to take Bhama's virginity from her before the Seventeenth Wind of the Night comes to take him to hell, thus erasing both their mutual memories forever, and failing which, Brahma tells Devan, he will be sentenced to turn into a hideous, foul-smelling beast, neither human nor gandharva, roaming around for a billion kalpas. Devan decides to refuse his Divine Father's advice, and prepares to welcome his terrible fate. Bhama advises him to leave her and go back, so that he will not have to undergo the severe tortures of Indra. She also wants to give up her virginity to him, for although Devan's memories are her most valued possession, she wants to sacrifice them in order to save him and to not have to bear the continued perception of his cruel tortures which would otherwise haunt her throughout her life. They indulge in a physical relationship that night, which she considers the most valuable gift that she can have from him. The night fades away and the heavy Seventeenth Wind of the Night comes in. When the wind moves away, Devan slowly vanishes and Bhama is shown weeping and looking far away.\nThe film was shot in the location of  Desamangalam.", "tmdb_id": 255317}, "63424450": {"title": "No Love (film)", "plot": "The film tells about Rita, who meets with an elderly photographer and a student at the same time, but doesn't really like one of them, which hurts both him and herself.", "tmdb_id": 888083}, "3538530": {"title": "No Skin Off My Ass", "plot": "A punk hairdresser (Bruce LaBruce), known only as \u201cThe Hairdresser\u201d, becomes obsessed with a mute neo-Nazi skinhead (Klaus von Br\u00fccker).

Due to his background, he is often mocked and ridiculed by American physicians at the hospital where he works. Moody claims that his Iranian family wants to meet Betty and Mahtob and asks them to come with him for a two-week visit.\nDespite her deep fears about visiting Iran, particularly due to the Iranian Hostage Crisis of several years earlier, Betty reluctantly agrees after her husband promises they will safely return to America. Upon their arrival, Mahtob is embraced, while Betty's unfamiliarity with the family's Islamic lifestyle inadvertently offends some members of Moody's family. The night before their flight back to the United States, Moody's brother Mammal tells Moody and Betty that in order for them to go back home, their passports would have to have been taken to the airport for approval three days prior. Betty questions this, but Moody brushes this off, suggesting that they will take a later flight.\nAfter Betty insists that they go to the airport anyway, Moody reveals that he never intended for them to return, and that they will remain in Iran permanently. When Betty protests, Moody becomes enraged and strikes her. Betty tries to earn sympathy from Moody's family, but is scorned by them. Iran's war with Iraq continues, with the family having to shelter in place during an Iraqi missile attack; Moody blames these difficulties on American support for Iraq.\nMoody becomes more hostile and abusive to his wife and daughter, preventing Betty from leaving the house or even using the telephone. One day Betty answers a phone call from her mother and reveals she is trapped in Iran. Her mother tells her to seek help from the American Interests Section of the Swiss Embassy. Betty sneaks out of the house and visits the embassy, but is told that under Iran's nationality law, she acquired Iranian citizenship upon her marriage to Moody and thus is not entitled to consular protection. Because Iran is an Islamic republic governed by sharia law, Betty cannot leave the country or make decisions concerning her daughter without her husband's permission. Moody, alarmed by Betty's absence from the house, threatens to kill her if she tries anything again.\nFor 18 months Betty conforms to her husband's wishes in order to gain Moody's trust. Watched by Moody's sister, Betty convinces him that they should move out of her home and into Mammal's home. By chance, during a trip to the marketplace, she meets a sympathetic storekeeper who allows her to use his telephone and overhears her conversations with the Swiss Embassy. He puts her in contact with a pair of humanitarian Iranians, Hossein and his sister, who offer to help Betty and Mahtob return to the United States. Betty accepts Hossein's assistance, especially after he warns her that Mahtob, when she reaches nine years old, could be at risk of being forced into marriage and or be drafted as a child soldier. Mahtob does not adjust to her new Iranian school and has to be accompanied to school by Betty. The women at the school tell Betty that they sympathize with her, and though they will not allow her to use the telephone, they allow her to bring Mahtob to school hours after she would normally arrive. Betty uses this time to meet with Hossein, and they discuss an escape route. When she and Mahtob arrive at school, Moody is there waiting for them and attacks Betty. She leaves with Moody, but flees when he is distracted. She finds a telephone booth and calls a woman from the Swiss embassy whom she had spoken with previously. They return to the school, but the women from the school forbid her from taking Mahtob. With no other options, Betty and Mahtob return home with Moody.\nBetty learns that her father is seriously ill. Moody tells Betty he will allow her to return to see her dying father, but will not let Mahtob go with her. He tells Betty while she is in the United States, she is to liquidate their assets and return to Iran. Hossein warns Betty that if she visits her father, she may never see Mahtob again. Betty decides to wait to return to the United States with Mahtob. Moody unknowingly foils her plans by having her booked on a flight several days early, thanks to his relatives' contacts in the airport.\nMoody is called to the clinic for an emergency. On the pretense of going to buy presents for her father, Betty takes Mahtob and they contact Hossein, who supplies Betty and Mahtob with fake identity documents, and they make their way past checkpoint with Iranian smugglers.\nBetty and Mahtob are dropped off in a street in Ankara, where they see the flag of the American Embassy in the distance.

Sailors on board a nearby French ship hear the sound of firecrackers and mistakenly think that Liu's ship is firing at them so they return fire and injure the dancers. Wong picks up the lion head and finishes the performance. Liu comments about the perilous situation China is in, and then gives Wong a hand fan inscribed with all the unequal treaties signed between China and other countries.\nWong is the martial arts instructor of the local militia in Foshan. He also runs his own traditional Chinese medicine clinic, Po-chi-lam, and has three apprentices: \"Porky Wing\", \"Bucktooth\" So, and Kai. He meets Siu-kwan, the daughter of a sworn brother of his grandfather. Even though she is around the same age as him, he still has to address her as \"13th Aunt\" as she is considered more \"senior\" than him. They have romantic feelings for each other but their relationship is restrained because it is taboo in the conservative Chinese society of their time.\nLeung Foon arrives in Foshan with an opera troupe to stage performances. He encounters 13th Aunt by chance, has a few clumsy encounters with her, and develops a crush on her. He also runs into trouble with the Shaho Gang, which terrorises and extorts money from local businesses. A fight breaks out between the gang and the local militia while Wong is meeting the Governor of Foshan in a restaurant. The gangsters flee when they realise they are no match for Wong. The Governor blames Wong for the disturbance, and disbands and arrests the militia members. Wong confronts the Shaho Gang's leader, defeats him and captures him, but the authorities release him because no one wants to help Wong by testifying as a witness in court.\nIn the meantime, Leung Foon meets a northern martial artist, \"Iron Vest\" Yim, and decides to follow him. Yim wants to become famous and start a martial arts school in Foshan, but he needs to prove himself first. One night, the Shaho Gang sets fire to Po-chi-lam in revenge, after which they flee and take shelter under Jackson, an American official. In return for protection from the authorities, the Shaho Gang helps Jackson run his underground human trafficking ring by kidnapping Chinese women to be sent to America as prostitutes. When Wong and the Governor are watching an opera performance, the Shaho Gang and Jackson's men ambush them and try to assassinate the Governor and kill Wong. Their plan fails but many innocent people at the theatre are wounded. The Governor blames Wong and threatens to arrest and execute him, but allows him to give medical attention to the injured.\nWhile tending to the injured people in his clinic, Wong meets an escaped Chinese labourer from America who relates his story of how he and his fellow labourers were treated in America. Just then, Yim arrives at Po-chi-lam and insists on challenging Wong to a fight to prove he is the better fighter. Yim leaves with Leung Foon, who was fired from the opera troupe, after he was defeated by Wong but later joins the Shaho Gang instead \u2013 even though Leung strongly objects to Yim working with the gang. Shortly after Yim left, the Governor shows up and orders his men to search Po-chi-lam for fugitives. Wong and his apprentices fight with the Governor's men until 13th Aunt, \"Bucktooth\" So and the labourer have escaped. Wong then surrenders himself and is imprisoned along with his apprentices. In the meantime, the Shaho Gang kills the labourer, abducts 13th Aunt and takes her to their base. \"Bucktooth\" So escapes and goes to the prison to inform Wong. The prison guards release Wong and his apprentices out of respect for him.\nWong and his apprentices disguise themselves and infiltrate Jackson's base to find and rescue 13th Aunt. Yim engages Wong in a one-on-one fight and again, Wong defeats Yim for the second time in a row, and realises that he has been cheating in fights; there is a small spearhead tied onto the tip of Yim's queue (which Wong uses to tear Yim's queue in retaliation for cheating) at the same time, Wong's apprentices and Leung Foon overcome the Shaho Gang and Jackson's men, and save 13th Aunt and the kidnapped women. Just as Wong is about to board Jackson's ship, Yim shows up, wanting to resume his fight with Wong, and gets fatally shot by Jackson's men. With his dying breath, he tells Wong that \"martial arts stand no chance against guns\". During the fight on the ship, the Shaho Gang's leader meets his end after being pushed into a furnace. At the critical moment, Jackson takes the Governor hostage at gunpoint, but Wong kills Jackson by using his fingers to flick an unused bullet into Jackson's forehead, and saves the Governor.

However, Child Welfare Services decides that their apartment is too small for three children, and Barbara is a diabetic who needs daily insulin shots.\nTo gain the welfare agency's approval, Artie feels he must buy a house. The one he has chosen requires a $25,000 down payment that he does not have.

At least when this company is liquidated, he says, they'll end up with a few dollars in their pocket.\nWhen the vote is taken, the shareholders agree to give Garfield controlling interest in the company.

He is at home in his traditional world, is at peace with his inner self and the social mores of the time. By way of contrast, he begets a son who is of rebellious nature and questioning of the traditional social hierarchies of the time. He falls in love with the daughter of a royal household which ultimately leads to his demise.Raman Perumthachan is unsurpassed as a wood-carver, sculptor and architect and his creations were so exquisite that he was regarded a reincarnation of the architect of the gods. He was also a man of great erudition. Though brought up as a carpenter, he was alluded to be the son of a Brahmin. Perumthachan himself doubted this supposition and in one part of the film he smiles approvingly when his son suggests to him that perhaps the made up story about his Brahmanical antecedents was a ruse by the upper castes to lay claim to some of his ability and prestige.\nThe screenplay begins at dusk with an old ambalavasi trying to light a stone lamp. But due to a strong gust of wind the lamp struggles to remain alight. A man lying in the tanner pandal close by gets up and places a stone slab strategically in such a way  that the path of the wind is breached. He wears a sacred thread(poonool) and hence is mistaken for a Namboodiri. But he tells the ambalavasi that he is no Namboodiri, but a carpenter who had forgotten to remove his thread which he had worn during the construction of a temple. Immediately the ambalavasi recognises that this was no ordinary carpenter but the legendary Perumthachan himself. News spreads about the arrival of Perumthachan.\nHe meets up with a rich Brahmin who was his childhood friend and who is now the Thampuran of a rich royal household(Kovilakam). He is requested to oversee the construction of the family's shrine and the sculpting of the image of the goddess. The ravishing beauty of the Brahmin householder's wife Bhargavi Thampuratti catches his imagination and he sculpts the face of the goddess in the mould of the Thampuratti. Though a man of principles, Perumthachan feels drawn to the woman whose looks he compares to 'Swayamvara Durga'; but steps back, knowing well the consequences of any indiscretion on his part. This apparent attraction leads to a minor misunderstanding towards  Perumtachan in the mind of the Thampuran and consequently he is not allowed to complete the work on the idol to his satisfaction and is insulted by the Thampuran during the consecration of the idol. Perunthachan leaves the place disillusioned.\nYears roll on and his son Kannan has grown into an insightful young man of great charms and talent. Perumthachan is proud of his son's abilities and pleased by his son's growing reputation, but is also worried by his son's tendency to overlook the traditional rules and values of sculptural art and by the strain of unscrupulousness in the son which is a mark of the new, more materialistic and self-centred generation. It is Perumthachan's long cherished wish that he be the one who builds the Saraswati mandapam which Bhargavi Thamburatti had desired for. Kunhikkavu Thamburatti, the daughter agrees to her late mother's wish, but it is Kannan, not Perumthachan, who is called up to do the work. The young man goes to the very household of the same rich Brahmin for whom his father had carved the image of the goddess years ago and designs and supervises the building of the temple. In an ironical repetition of his father's experience, he falls in love with Kunhikkavu. But unlike his father, he does not hold himself back and a scandal erupts in the royal household. The girl's father tells perumthachan that he even wished that kannan died falling off from the construction rather than creating shame to the royal household. Seeing that the scandal is slowly destroying his old patron, the father of the girl, Perumthachan arrives to oversee the construction of the temple. He tries to cajole his son to walk away from his relationship.

Rather than robbing the vault, they only demand the cash the tellers have in their drawers, and are gone within ninety seconds.\nPursuing Pappas's theory that the criminals are surfers, Utah goes undercover to infiltrate the surfing community. He fabricates a personal family tragedy to persuade orphaned surfer and restaurant waitress Tyler Ann Endicott to teach him to surf, after she saves him from drowning during his first attempt at surfing. Through her, he meets Bodhi, the charismatic leader of a gang of surfers consisting of Roach, Grommet, and Nathaniel.

They set up shop in the defunct Dreamland theater, which is to be razed in three weeks. Professor Davis is concerned about the time constraints, but Toby enlists the help of Dr. Mnesyne, an owner of a film memorabilia shop, with deploying promotional gimmicks. There are three main films within a film: Mosquito is a 3D film, The Attack of the Amazing Electrified Man uses a \"Shock-o-Scope\" gimmick (electrical \"buzzers\" in seats), and The Stench uses Odorama.As they go through Dr. Mnesyne's trunks of equipment, they find a short cult film called Possessor, which greatly resembles Maggie's dreams. Davis informs them Lanyard Gates, the film's director, killed his own family while shooting the final scene before setting the theater on fire, trapping the audience inside.

The movie opens with the death of the previous Pope followed by a deadlocked conclave that lasts for 25 days. The conclave is ended by the Mafia's tame Cardinal Rocco, who successfully persuades the College of Cardinals to elect in absentia the Mafia's favoured candidate to the papacy, Albini (Janez Vajevec), a priest in the service of the Mafia, whom Rocco passes off as an absent \"Cardinal Albini\".\nUnfortunately for the Mafia, the secretary of the College of Cardinals Fr. Rookie is hard of hearing, and while recording the official results of the election, he misheard the pope-elect's name and instead of writing \"Cardinal Albini\" he writes down \"Cardinal Albinizi\" and \"Albinizi\" happens to be the surname of an honest parish priest, C. David \"Dave\" Albinizi. As a result, Fr. Albinizi becomes Pope and takes the name of Pope David I. Father Albinizi is an unorthodox priest, interested in cars, women and Rock and Roll. However, his interests in those are rather benign and not overly carnal. Prior to his ascent to the papacy, Albinizi had been a priest in an Italian orphanage, where he took a genuine interest in the children's welfare and wished them to grow up enjoying the gospel, as opposed to the curmedgeonly nuns who believe misery is deserved. Inside the Vatican, the Pope gets along with Bish, a priest in charge of coordinating the pope's security and an unnamed nun (Mirta Zecevic) assigned to bring him his meals. The pope initially considers abdicating due to a failed assassination attempt against him but is convinced by the nun to stay. As the plot develops, one of the journalists at the press conference asks the Pope to explain the corruption inside the Vatican bank. The Pope demands to see the Vatican accounts. Bish had previously received a disk upon the previous pope's death containing information about the financial irregularities and when Pope David looks into the Vatican accounts, Bish gives the disk to the pope. With Bish's help, the Pope discovers the gun-smuggling and stolen merchandise operations, and confronts Cardinal Rocco. Albinizi immediately has Rocco defrocked as punishment and to help put an end to the corruption. In revenge, Rocco persuades his mafia backers to intensify the assassination efforts against Pope David.\nTogether with the papal chamberlain Monsignor Fitchie, Cardinal Rocco decides to find any affair to blackmail the Pope. They find out that before joining the priesthood, Albinizi fathered a son with Veronica Dante, an American tourist. Albinizi had joined the priesthood because Veronica did not want to marry him or stay with him. Consequently, Veronica had given birth to their son, but never informed Albinizi of this. Their son is now a rock star, Joe Don Dante, dating Corelli's daughter Luccia (Khedija Sassi). Corelli doesn't approve this relationship and sends thugs to kill Joe. However, the bomb which destroys Joe's trailer kills Luccia and seriously wounds Joe who is then revealed the truth about his father. Albinizi, now Pope David I, learns about his son from Veronica and subsequently visits him before Joe dies.\nPope David learns the Vatican Bank is a tool of the Mafia, and has it dissolved. Soon after that the Pope's affair is revealed and he is forced to resign and Corelli's candidate Albini is elected Pope. Corelli and Fr. Albini move into the papal apartments. Out in the streets, Albinizi gets back with Veronica. He also finds out that the orphanage where he previously worked before becoming pope had closed. Albinizi reads the news about Albini becoming pope and rushes back to the Vatican to ask Bish to help him stop the coronation. On the way to the papal apartments the two encounter a dying Cardinal Rocco who had just been shot by Corelli. While Bish continues to the papal apartments, Rocco confesses to Albinizi who grants him absolution in his dying moments interrupted by a phone call to Rocco from his female partner. Rocco subsequently dies and Albinizi having completed the absolution rite goes to the papal chamber and finds Bish bound. Bish however tells Albinizi that the coronation was about to take place and tells him to get there fast instead of freeing him. Albinizi rushes off to the Sistine Chapel. Mons. Fitchie who had previously overheard Corelli shoot Cardinal Rocco eventually comes and frees Bish. Albinizi manages to get into the Sistine Chapel just before the end of the ceremony and reveals to the public that the man in the chapel called Albini is really Corelli in disguise. Corelli admits that there was no Cardinal Albini, declares himself as \"Pope Vittorio I, Emperor of the Vatican\" and draws the gun to hold Albinizi at gunpoint. He fires a few shots which hit the ceiling, causing it to collapse and bury Corelli. After Corelli is defeated, a nun (the one who served Albinizi when he was pope) is chosen to become the first female Pope in history. The new Pope (or Popess) announces that she will give the Vatican's gold to the world's poor. She also gives her blessing for Albinizi to take a bride.

Nineteen-year-old Songlian (played by Gong Li), an educated woman whose father has recently died and left the family bankrupt, is forced by her stepmother to marry into the wealthy Chen family, becoming the fourth concubine or, as she is referred to, the Fourth Mistress (S\u00ec T\u00e0itai) of the household. Arriving at the palatial abode, she is at first treated like royalty, receiving sensuous foot massages and brightly lit red lanterns, as well as a visit from her husband, Master Chen (Ma Jingwu), the master of the house, whose face is never clearly shown.\nSonglian soon discovers, however, that not all the concubines in the household receive the same luxurious treatment. In fact, the master decides on a daily basis the concubine with whom he will spend the night; whomever he chooses gets her lanterns lit, receives the foot massage, gets her choice of menu items at mealtime, and gets the most attention and respect from the servants. Pitted in constant competition against each other, the three concubines are continually vying for their husband's attention and affections.\nThe First Mistress, Yuru (Jin Shuyuan), appears to be nearly as old as the master himself. Having borne a son decades earlier, she seems resigned to live out her life as forgotten, always passed over in favor of the younger concubines. The Second Mistress, Zhuoyun (Zhu\u00f3y\u00fan, Cao Cuifen), befriends Songlian, complimenting her youth and beauty, and giving her expensive silk as a gift; she also warns her about the Third Mistress, Meishan (M\u00e9ishan, He Saifei), a former opera singer who is spoiled and who becomes unable to cope with no longer being the youngest and most favored of the master's playthings. As time passes, though, Songlian learns that it is really Zhuoyun, the Second Mistress, who is not to be trusted; she is subsequently described as having the face of the Buddha, yet possessing the heart of a scorpion.

Zhuoyun, however, is in league with Yan'er who finds and reveals a pair of bloodied undergarments, suggesting that Songlian had recently had her period, and discovers the pregnancy is a fraud.\nZhuoyun summons the family physician, feigning concern for Songlian's \"pregnancy\". Doctor Gao (Gao-yisheng, Cui Zhigang), who is secretly having an illicit affair with Third Mistress Meishan, examines Songlian and determines the pregnancy to be a sham. Infuriated, the master orders Songlian's lanterns covered with thick black canvas bags indefinitely. Blaming the sequence of events on Yan'er, Songlian reveals to the house that Yan'er's room is filled with lit red lanterns, showing that Yan'er dreams of becoming a mistress instead of a lowly servant; it is suggested earlier that Yan'er is in love with the master and has even slept with him in the Fourth Mistress' bed.\nYan'er is punished by having the lanterns burned while she kneels in the snow, watching as they smolder. In an act of defiance, Yan'er refuses to humble herself or apologize, and thus remains kneeling in the snow throughout the night until she collapses. Yan'er falls sick and ultimately dies after being taken to the hospital. One of the servants tells Songlian that her former maid died with her mistress's name on her lips. Songlian, who had briefly attended university before the passing of her father and being forced into marriage, comes to the conclusion that she is happier in solitude; she eventually sees the competition between the concubines as a useless endeavor, as each woman is merely a \"robe\" that the master may wear and discard at his discretion.\nAs Songlian retreats further into her solitude, she begins speaking of suicide; she reasons that dying is a better fate than being a concubine in the Chen household. On her twentieth birthday, severely intoxicated and despondent over her bitter fate, Songlian inadvertently blurts out the details of the love affair between Meishan and Doctor Gao to Zhuoyun, who later catches the adulterous couple together.

Blake and Kim kill a city councilman who works with Styles, dressing his body in drag, planting child pornography in his briefcase and staging his death to look like a suicide, framing Styles for embezzling city funds. Blake and Kim abduct Styles outside his home and hold him hostage in an empty swimming pool for several days. They regularly inject Styles with heroin and cocaine while engaging in arm wrestling. Blake hires a prostitute (Linda Dona) to have sex with Styles. She ignores the weakened Styles' objections and rapes him as Blake records the incident on video.

Styles heads to the park where his family are watching a circus act, and holds a black-clad figure he believes to be Blake at gunpoint; the figure turns out to be a clown, making Styles seem unstable. Blake releases the recording of Styles' rape, making it appear as if Styles is soliciting prostitutes. District Attorney Priscilla Brimleigh (Lindsay Wagner) suspends Styles.\nWith Styles determined to get his name cleared, Styles and Doyle beat information out of one of Blake's former AB allies. In an alley, Blake fatally shoots Doyle and plants Styles' fingerprints on the gun.\nDesperate, Styles contacts Odessa for help, bringing his family to the housing project Odessa uses as a drug lab. On the roof, Styles raves to the street below, apparently suicidal; this draws out Blake, who wants Styles to live a long, miserable life. Styles fakes his own death by escaping an explosion in the building.\nOdessa's gang abducts Kim, and Odessa sends a message to Blake that Styles is alive and intends to find him, challenging him to come to the Watts Towers.

It is revealed in a flashback Ricky's name as a child was Rick, but his uncle, after seeing how strong he was, decided the name Ricky was more suitable. It is also revealed that Ricky has multiple bullets inside him that he received from his attack on the crime lord, which he refused to remove because he considers them souvenirs from his killings.\nAn elderly inmate, Ma/Omar, is attacked by the captain of the cells Wildcat/Samuel. Ricky trips Samuel, who falls face first on a well placed piece of wood with nails. After this, one of the inmates suggests that Mad Dragon/Zorro, a dangerous, morbidly obese inmate should kill him. Omar is informed by the guards that his probation was turned down after Samuel lied, telling the guards that Omar was spreading dirty prison rumors. Stricken by grief, Omar hangs himself. Zorro attacks Ricky in the shower room, but is easily killed and gutted by Ricky's bare hands. Ricky thwarts Samuel's attack, squeezing his hands until all his fingers broke before punching a hole in his stomach, killing him as well. Ricky is thrown into isolation as punishment. At night he uses chi to heal his wounds and gets flashbacks to his girlfriend as well as his training.\nShortly after, a member of the Four Heavenly Kings (\"Gang of Four\" in the English dub) named Hai/Oscar the leader of the North Cell, suggests that Ricky see the one-eyed Assistant Warden Dan. The warden shoots Ricky with a gun only for Ricky to slap the bullet away and retaliate by punching the air so hard the Warden starts bleeding, which intimidates the Warden. After Ricky's confrontation, Dan suggests Oscar kill him. Outside the prison yard, Oscar and Ricky engage in a fight. After losing an eye due to a backhand slap from Ricky, Oscar cuts a hole in his stomach and uses his intestines to strangle Ricky. Ricky breaks free, tosses Oscar in the air and delivers a skull crushing blow which instantly kills Oscar. Ricky soon discovers that the Gang of Four is growing illegal opium for profit.

The Gang of Four attempt to persuade Oscar's younger brother to revenge his death, but he refuses and in return he gets half of his face sliced off.\nThe next day, the Warden and his spoiled obese son return from their vacation. Dan informs the Warden about the incidents, including the poppy garden. This infuriates the Warden, almost transforming him into a Hulk-like creature, though he prevents it by taking medication. As the Warden tortures and questions Ricky, Tarzan bursts through the wall to fight Ricky, which ends in Ricky dismembering half of Tarzan's left arm and breaking his mandible. The Warden activates a ceiling trap on Ricky who struggles to stay alive. Tarzan regains consciousness and holds the ceiling, only to unintentionally save Ricky by being crushed himself. After escaping, Ricky finds a photo showing Tarzan had a family waiting for him. The Warden orders the inmates to bury Ricky alive, which they reluctantly obey. The Warden proposes if Ricky survives underground for a week, he will free him. Ricky does survive by eating dog meat, however, the Warden denies him freedom.

That night, Banks and his crony Richards assault Carlin, leaving his face bruised. Due to this, he is mistakenly accused of fighting by Sands and given three days solitary confinement as punishment.\nAfter serving his punishment, Carlin seeks revenge on Banks and Richards by first attacking Richards and then beating Banks and effectively replacing him as the \"daddy\" of the wing. Carlin then makes a deal with house officer Mr. Goodyear. In exchange for a single room cell, Carlin will use his \"natural leader\" skills to keep peace in the wing. Carlin asks a new inmate named Rhodes to be his \"missus\", although Carlin stresses he is not homosexual.\nA short while after, whilst Davis is working in the greenhouse, he is assaulted and gang raped by a group of boys. Sands looks in the window and sees the rape, but merely smiles and walks away. Later that night, Davis, traumatised by the rape, asks warder Mr. Greaves for help but is merely berated by him. Davis later slashes his wrists in his cell and dies as a result. His body is found the next morning by Sands.\nThe following day during breakfast, the boys refuse to eat in protest against Davis' death. Carlin then incites a riot. (Ray Winstone recalled that he and several others intended to give John Judd a real beating in the scene, as he had taken a bit too well to his role as the brutal warder Sands, but Judd got wind of the plan and scrambled to get out of the messhall - which only added to the effect of the riot.)\nLater, Carlin, Archer and several others are led away by guards, handcuffed. The Governor of the borstal makes an announcement to all the inmates stating he will tolerate no further outbursts. He then declares a minute silent prayer in Davis' memory. In a grimly ironic touch, the boys who raped Davis are in the front row of the assembly.", "tmdb_id": 90098}, "13870073": {"title": "Sebastian Star Bear: First Mission", "plot": "The movie begins with a grizzly bear cub, Griselda, being told by her mother a story about bears from prehistoric times, led by Ursus, who were sent to the stars (The Ursa Major constellation) by their leader, in order to watch over the bears on Earth from there and protect them from harm.\nMeanwhile, in San Francisco, a local theatre owner, Draco, is being intimidated by gangster McGrath, whom he owes a large amount of money, and his enforcer, Cuddles. Standing at the edge of bankruptcy, Draco desperately needs a new show, that would guarantee him a money income and thus repaying McGrath (in fact, Draco plans to escape with the money after the show). He decides to organize a performance of dancing bears. From now on, along with his simply-minded assistant Muggsy and Maestro - a pianist working at his theatre - Draco sets on a journey, hunting and imprisoning bears from around the world, forcing them to dance in his show.\nOne of the bears that were kidnapped by Draco was Griselda's mother. During the hunt, Draco and Muggsy were accompanied by adopted city dog, Sniffy, who chased Griselda (who saved herself by climbing on a tree), but simultaneously separated from his masters, who left him behind, as they left with Griselda's mother as captive. Hours pass. Griselda, still hiding on a tree, grows more and more upset, as she fruitlessly awaits her mother. As she starts crying, she looks into the stars, and reminds herself a story told by her mother. When she asks for help, a star ship arrives from the Ursa Major constellation, landing nearby. It appears, that it is piloted by Sebastian, the star bear, who comes in response for Griselda's plea for help. Along with her, his robot assistant SOUCI and Sniffy (who decided to join Sebastian), he sets on a journey to save Griselda's mother, and ruin Draco's plans, freeing bears imprisoned by him.\nUsing Sebastian's star ship, the team locates a train, transporting Draco and his assistants, as well as imprisoned Griselda's mother. They struggle to release the latter, but they are unable to do it, because she is held in a cage, locked on a padlock, to that only Draco has the key. During the action on a train, however, Sebastian manages to enter Draco's car (in an attempt to find the keys) and gain his personal notes. Soon after that, Sebastian is almost caught by humans, and the team is forced to run, leaving Griselda's mother - as well as Sniffy, who merely felt asleep in Draco's truck.\nAt the same time, Griselda, SOUCI and Sebastian travel by the latter's star ship again, this time trying to find out, what Draco's next move will be. Basing on the notes Sebastian found on the train, they arrive to the circus placed in Boulder Plains. As it soon appears, that circus has a show performed by bears in its repertoire, and is going be Draco's next target. After arriving there, they find Sniffy, who rejoins their team. To Draco's anger, Sebastian intervenes, when Draco and Muggsy are attempting to kidnap the performing bears. However, although Sebastian manages to ruin Draco's plans, he gets caught himself. He is taken away on Draco's truck, which later boards the plane. Griselda and SOUCI are shocked to witness that, but are unable to save Sebastian on time, and thus are forced to look for him, on the board of the star ship. Meanwhile, on Draco's airplane, Sebastian in held captive in a cage. Draco, as it appears, plans to kill him, by dropping him into sea and therefore drowning. However, that plan is not realized, because when Draco, Muggsy and Maestro fell all asleep, Sebastian uses his graviton (a portable device, capable of eliminating gravity and thus levitating objects) to obtain the key to the cage he is held in (using the graviton also enables SOUCI to lock on Sebastian's position). Sebastian then gets into the truck's cockpit and drives away from the board of the plane through the cargo door, despite Muggsy's attempts to stop him. Floating in the space, Sebastian is finally found by SOUCI and reunites with the team.\nThe next theatre of Draco's actions proves to be China, where he plans to catch a local panda. Sebastian and his team arrive there as well, and run into Draco during their travel through the country. SOUCI is badly damaged and almost destroyed, when Draco's truck runs over her. Sebastian and Griselda are almost caught, but Sniffy helps them to escape, desperately attacking humans. SOUCI, damaged too heavily to walk, is carried away by Sebastian. After getting far away from Draco, Sebastian leaves SOUCI on the ground, promising, that we will be back to take her home. Sebastian, Griselda and Sniffy visit the mysterious magician and inventor, Ha So, who invites them to his palace, and presents the device of his project, the transvisualator, which enables them to observe the panda. The latter is being caught by Draco at the same time, but Sebastian modifies the device, making it capable of \"teleporting\" the panda safely into Ha So's palace, therefore disrupting Draco's plans again. Sebastian then uses transvisualator to teleport Muggsy, who is next tied to a chair and questioned by Sebastian, who forces him (by using the graviton to make him fly and become dizzy) to reveal, where the Draco's bear show will be performed. With this information, Sebastian, Griselda and Sniffy fly to San Francisco in order to begin the final showdown with Draco.\nWhen they arrive, the show starts already, and the house is full of people (including McGrath). Although Draco tries to stop Sebastian, the actions of the latter, as well as Griselda and Sniffy, cause the disarray. When Griselda gets on the scene, the bear trainer, trying to catch her, uses his whip, hurting the dancing bears as a consequence, and thus enraging the audience, who demand to stop the show. Later the people panic, when released bears leave the scene. In the chaos, Draco escapes as well, taking money he earned on the performance, to McGrath's anger. Sebastian leads the bears out of theatre and uses the tramway to transport them all out from the city. During this, they nearly run over Draco's truck, damaging it heavily and making to run out of control. Draco, Muggsy and Maestro drive into the lake, where they are caught by an enraged McGrath. Meanwhile, the tramway full of bears reaches the forest near the city - bears imprisoned by Draco, along with Griselda's mother, are finally free.\nSebastian's mission is over, so he brings Griselda and her mother back to the land they came from (Sniffy, however, stays in San Francisco). After bidding goodbye with Griselda (who hopes of seeing him again in the future), he flies back to China, picking up SOUCI still lying there. They both fly back to their planet.

The issue is placed before the Court by Brown v. Board of Education and its companion case, Briggs v. Elliott.  Many of the justices personally believe segregation is morally unacceptable, but have difficulty justifying the idea legally under the 14th Amendment.  Marshall and Davis argue their respective cases.  Marshall argues the equal protection clause extends far enough to the states to prohibit segregated schools.  Davis counters that control of public schools is a \"states' rights\" issue that Congress never intended to be covered by the 14th Amendment when it was passed.\nTaking the case under advisement, the stalemated justices agree to allow Marshall and Davis an opportunity to reargue their respective cases as to whether the equal protection clause specifically extends to the desegregation of schools.  In the interim, Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson dies and is replaced by a non-jurist, Governor Earl Warren of California.\nMeanwhile, Marshall and his staff are fruitless in finding any research showing the Civil-War era crafters of the 14th Amendment in 1866 intended for schools to be desegregated.  On the other hand, Davis and his Ivy League-educated staff find several examples of segregated schools having existed ever since the passage of the equal protection clause.  Finally, the NAACP staffers discover a quote by Thaddeus Stevens delivered on the floor of the Senate during the debate over the Amendment, which directly states segregation is constitutionally and morally wrong.

Owl, a \"famous storyteller\". Noting that the viewer is lost in the forest, he decides to recount the tale of Tiny the puppy, the seventh brother (occasionally interspersing his story with various comments of his own).\nThe doctor's tale begins the previous spring, with Tiny the puppy riding in a car with his owner-a little girl named Angie-and her grandpa after an enjoyable trip to a big city. On the way home, their car breaks down in the middle of a storm and the grandpa goes out to fix it. Angie goes out to help, telling Tiny to stay in the car, but leaving the door open. Spotting a frog outside, Tiny goes after it, but falls down a hill (unbeknownst to his owners, who drive off without him and can't hear his barks over the storm). Heartbroken, he decides to wait out the storm by sleeping in a little hollowed-out area in a bush (sleeping through Angie calling for him, as she noticed his absence soon and told her grandpa to go back to find him).\nThe next morning, a band of rabbits discover Tiny. Their opinions on him are mixed (most of them believe Tiny to be some form of monster), but the leader of the group-the ruffian of the family, J.C. (his real name is Jerald Cuthbert)-feels that he should be left to survive on his own; luckily, one of his sisters, Joanna, decides that they should help him. She quickly convinces her siblings to join up after putting the matter to a vote with the other rabbits- Rebecca (the eldest sister), Mimi (the sensitive one), Cody (the glutton), Marty (the cautious one) -and Tiny is welcomed into the family as a \"bunny-puppy\". Tiny accepts, but on one condition- they must come back later to see if Angie came back. The bunnies agree and bring him back to their home following a musical number in which they introduce themselves. However, they teach him to act like a rabbit, such as hopping and keeping his ears up straight. J.C. is frustrated with Tiny because he doesn't act like a rabbit, but when J.C. is caught by a hawk, Tiny scares the hawk away by barking at it, causing it to fly away in a panic. Because of this, the family afterwards decides to accept Tiny as their brother, which makes the puppy very happy, although their parents are afraid at first.\nThe morning after, Miss Magpie, the nosy leader of the forest, is very scared of the news and tells her friend, Birdie, and the whole forest about it. Most of the forest is scared of Tiny at first, but when they see that he isn't vicious, the animals are relieved. The sole exception for this rule is Miss Magpie, who is still heavily convinced that he is a monster (mainly due to the fact that Tiny is a dog, a domesticated animal bred to hunt and kill animals and believing that he will do the same to them as soon as he is fully grown). When Tiny smells the scent of his owners and hears Angie calling for him, he runs up the hill to the road where he first met the bunnies. But when he arrives, he is too late, and thinks that his owners don't want him anymore (luckily, his new family is able to turn his frown upside down). Miss Magpie hires a fox named Mr. Fox to try and intimidate the rabbits, but Tiny teaches them to growl at him, which scares Mr. Fox and sends him running. Human poachers arrive in the forest to try and kill the bunnies, but the puppy teaches the rabbits to howl while hiding in their home, which send the poachers running.\nLater that night, a flood reaches the bunnies' home. J.C. and his father stay in their hole trying to dig their way out while the other rabbits climb up a branch, but Cody is caught in the raging waters and Tiny jumps in. The puppy saves Cody, and the rabbits hop onto dry land, but J.C. and their dad are still in their hole trying to dig through as the water rises. Tiny senses them and digs a hole where they escape. Their father applauds Tiny, saying he is proud for him to be their son.\nWinter is not far from arrival, and Miss Magpie mocks Tiny for being a dog, not knowing how to prepare for winter. Unfortunately for her, fortunes turn when a weasel tries to kill her because she failed to stop the rabbits. The weasel bites Tiny's leg, but he eventually throws the weasel into a pond. Fearing for his safety, Miss Magpie warns the rabbits. When the rabbits discover that Tiny is alive, they celebrate. But he is sick due to the effects of the bite (as well as being unable to survive on vegetation like all the other forest animals), and he is taken to see Dr. Owl, who tells the parents that he must be returned to his owners. The rabbits carry Tiny back home, but along the way, they come across a big crease between two hills. J.C. uses a large stick to successfully carry the family over the crease, and they finally reach his owners' home.

Pleading for his life, Dan convinces Gus to visit the shipwreck, where they find a chemical storage container. Dan dredges up a body of a man who looks exactly like himself. Dan realizes he is not Dan Merrick at all; he is actually Jack Stanton.\nIn a flashback, it is revealed that an abusive Dan confronted his wife Judith with evidence of her infidelity. She called for help and Jack raced to her home, arriving too late to prevent her from shooting her husband in the head. Jack wanted to go to the police, but Judith convinced him to cover up the murder and hide Dan's body. After doing so, Jack told Judith he wanted out of the relationship. This angered and distracted Judith, who drove into the car wreck.\nJudith had banked on the chemical dissolving Dan's body, but because it was actually formaldehyde, she had preserved it.

She drives erratically down the same stretch of road from the night of the accident, confessing to the murder of Jenny, saying she had figured everything out and had to be killed.\nShe hid the facts from Jack so he would have plausible deniability. After the crash, she told the plastic surgeons that the man she was with was her husband Dan. Distracted by a police helicopter, Judith loses control of the gun, and Jack grabs it, demanding she stop the car. Judith decides to kill them in a murder-suicide car crash. Jack, at the last second, rolls out, while she plummets to her death.\nThe police helicopter lands, and an injured Gus Klein emerges. Gus survived his plunge into the water after being shot thanks to his asthma inhaler. The two board the helicopter, with Gus referring to Jack as Dan, presumably securing Merrick's fortune for him.

Although initially pleasant and courteous, Lecter grows impatient with Starling's interviewing and rebuffs her, deducing Crawford's true motive and refusing to help. As she is leaving, a prisoner flicks semen at her, angering Lecter. He calls Starling back and tells her to seek out an old patient of his, which leads her to a storage facility where she discovers a jar containing a man's severed head. She returns to Lecter, who says the man is linked to Buffalo Bill, and offers to profile the suspect on the condition that he is transferred away from Chilton, whom he detests. Meanwhile, another victim is found with a death's head moth lodged in her throat.\nIn Tennessee, Buffalo Bill abducts Catherine Martin, the daughter of a U.S. senator. Crawford authorizes Starling to offer Lecter a fake deal, promising a prison transfer if he provides information that helps them capture Buffalo Bill in time to rescue Catherine.

Finding a musical orb shaped like Santa Claus in the box, he activates it, causing it to strangle him with retractable cords. As Tom struggles, he slips and falls onto a fireplace poker, his impaled body being found by his wife Sarah a few moments later.\nTwo weeks later, Sarah takes Derek, who has not spoken since his father's death, to a toy store owned by the elderly Joe Petto and his odd son Pino, not realizing Noah Adams has followed them. After Derek rejects all the toys Joe shows him (and one called Larry the Larvae that Pino tries to give him), he and his mother leave, prompting Joe to begin angrily yelling at Pino, blaming him for all the store's recent failures. While running from his father, Pino bumps into Noah and drops the larvae toy, which Noah picks up and buys along with some other toys. At his home, Noah begins taking apart the toys he bought from Joe when he is confronted by his angry landlord Harold. Late paying rent, Noah, to smooth things over, gives Harold the Larry the Larvae toy in exchange for a one-day extension. While driving home, Harold is killed when Larry the Larvae crawls into his mouth and bursts out his eye, causing his car to crash and explode.\nThe next day, Sarah takes Derek to see Santa (portrayed by Noah, who takes his friend's shift) at the mall, finding another gift on the porch on the way out.

They challenge Jim to a confrontation and make an attempt on his son's life with their car on the 27th anniversary of Wayne's murder.\nJim tracks down a retired policeman, Officer Neil, who reveals that he had been shot during a robbery and had been clinically dead for over three minutes, during which he encountered Wayne's spirit in the \"mid-realm\" \u2013 the dimension between the world of the living and one's final destination. Neil explains that Wayne is stuck there and sometimes when things are unsettled, spirits come back. Jim then tells Neil that the greasers all claimed to have transferred in from \"Milford,\" but can't find any trace of a \"Milford High School.\" Neil explains that it is not a school.\nJim goes to the Milford Cemetery and finds the graves of the three greasers, who once again confront him. They reveal to Jim that he is going to need Mueller to put everything together. Jim then tracks down Mueller, who panics and flees thinking Jim wants revenge. The greasers then attack Jim's family at their home. Jim fends them off and takes his family to a church, where they will be safe from the demonic gang. It is then revealed that when Jim was a boy, he had taken the murderers' car keys which led to their deaths. Jim realizes that he can't keep running and must deal with the past.\nJim returns to his abandoned childhood home and finds the old car keys that he took during the night of his brother's murder. He is joined by Mueller, who apologizes for Wayne's death and offers to help. The greasers attack again and take Mueller with them, reuniting their gang. Jim visits Wayne's grave seeking his help, but something blocks Wayne's return to the world of the living. In the meantime, the greasers lure Jim's family out of the church and take them prisoner.\nJim returns to the train tunnel in which Wayne's murder took place. The greasers plan to kill Jim the same way they murdered Wayne and take Jim with them, but Mueller switches sides and is killed by Lawson. The dying Mueller explains that for every life the greasers take, another can come back. A doorway to the afterlife opens, allowing Wayne to return. Wayne distracts the gang while Jim gets his family out of the gang's 1955 Chevrolet. Jim gives the gang back their car keys. Lawson promises to return, but Jim explains that there won't be a next time. The gang tries to escape in their car, only to have it struck by a ghost train that resembles the same one that killed them in 1963, which sends them to Hell.\nWayne is not aware that 27 years had passed, and Jim explains that he has grown up. Wayne can move on to Heaven and see his parents, and offers to have Jim come with him to the afterlife, but Jim refuses.

To please her clients, Ai has to play out elaborate fantasy scenarios involving sexual humiliation and light sadomasochism/bondage.\nThe first two-thirds of the film consists in large part of four erotic sequences involving sodomy, sadomasochism, submission and bondage. Including dildos and mirrors\u2014one with a perverted male dominant, one with a promiscuous female dominant. The other two involve erotic asphyxiation with, again, one episode in which a necrophiliac attempts to partially asphyxiate the female protagonist and the other in which a drug addicted man is the recipient to the female protagonist. Other acts of fetishes and paraphilias are involved in some of the scenarios.\nThe last third of the film consists of Ai's attempt to find her ex-lover, a famous Gallery artist.\nThe actual story however, revolves around Ai's attempt to place herself in the world and understand her life in an attempt to make her own way forward.\nThis is played out through the juxtaposition of the false closeness of the paid relationships with her decadent clients against her unrequited love for the gallery artist who has ended his relationship with her. The viewer can see that Ai is desperately grasping at this relationship as real in contrast to the simulated fetish relationships of her clients and we learn that she wishes to tell him of her continued love even though he has moved on and been married.\nAi shows an emotional connection to one of her clients, another sex worker who is a female dominant and who Ai clearly admires. Throughout the movie this person is the only person with whom Ai has a free open conversation. This woman delivers a monologue which defines her view of the sex trade as empowering and which is a sentinel defining concept to place the movie itself in a social context. This speech comes at a time when Ai appears to be having difficulties accepting her role as an escort and Ai is shown listening with rapt attention.\nAi confides to this client that she has unrequited love for the gallery artist and Ai's client tells her that she must live life to the fullest otherwise she will be filled with regrets. She tells Ai that she must confront this part of her life then she can move forward as her future will be hers.\nAt the beginning of the movie we are introduced to Ai's quest to find herself and her direction, She visits a fortune-teller, played by artist Yayoi Kusama, who advises her to find a \"pink stone\", and then \nfashion it into a ring.\nThe fortune teller also advises Ai to put a telephone directory under her television and to avoid a gallery in the east. Ai's view of the ring is important enough that when she later loses the ring she risks her life to recover it.\nThroughout the movie Ai looks at a photo of what appears to be her as a child with her mother and which in context represents innocence before life became complicated. Ai appears to refer to it to ground herself perhaps pondering how the happy child has transformed in to what she has become.\nTaking the advice of her female client, and an unidentified drug which her client gave her to provide her with the courage of lions, she becomes dangerously inebriated and fails in an attempt to meet her ex lover,\nShe is rescued from the police by one of the artist's neighbors who is said to have once been a great singer but is now crazy. This woman met Ai only a few minutes earlier and told her that she used to be friends with the Gallery artist but it is over and that she considers Ai to be her \"best friend\".\nAi who is now sitting dirty and battered, looks at the photo of herself and her mother and destroys it signifying her move away from innocence and her past. In the next scene now clean, she studies the pink stone on her hand and has the faintest trace of a smile twitch across the corner of her mouth. She pulls her hair back as she looks at herself in the mirror and goes off to her usual routine which is also now her new life, externally the same as her old life but internally different as she has taken control, found herself with the future now belonging to her.\nThroughout the film, Ai's movements have been timid and stiff and her posture demure.

Earlier in the film, Stiles is diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease, something that will end his political career. Peter seizes the opportunity to manipulate his father-in-law into supporting his run for Congress. When the older man refuses, Peter threatens to leak news of the illness to the press. The senator reluctantly acquiesces, but promises Peter that he will eventually get caught.\nTim, who by this time has risen through the ranks of the Department of Justice, launches an investigation into political corruption that will eventually lead back to Palmieri. When Palmieri discovers Peter's ties to Tim, he bullies Peter into setting Tim up by putting him in touch with a bogus tipster. Tim reveals the investigation to a reporter, creating public embarrassment for the DOJ and enabling Palmieri's corrupt plan. Tim is suspended, and Peter hires him to work for him on his upcoming campaign, believing he left the DOJ. Stiles reveals the conversation that he had with Peter to Diana and she decides to divorce Peter. Shortly thereafter, Tim discovers Peter's role in getting him suspended from his job but he denies it to keep Peter's trust. Diana reveals she has filed for divorce. Tim volunteers to help the DOJ work to bring Peter down.\nTim works diligently to gather evidence of Peter's dealings with Palmieri. He convinces his DOJ superiors to set up surveillance in a hotel room. After Peter wins the election, he and Tim adjourn to the hotel room. Tim tries to get Peter to admit details of his shady dealings with Palmieri. Peter becomes suspicious and Tim comes clean about his role. He also tells Peter that Palmieri is being arraigned at that very moment. Peter viciously attacks Tim. When the fighting subsides and the two calm down, Tim tells Peter he has brought ruin upon himself but Peter says it was all necessary to achieve his goals.\nAfter Peter gives his victory speech, he is arrested and charged with political corruption. The movie ends a few months later when Peter drops by Tim's apartment to drop off a case of champagne, fulfilling the bet made at the New Years Eve party years before. Peter reveals that he will not be sworn into office, and that he has been offered immunity in exchange for testimony against Palmieri. Tim then tells Peter that he will be forced to testify against him if he does not accept the plea deal.

The film is a stark denunciation of the culturally specific \u2018machismo\u2019 of Chinese men, as observed in a traditional  coastal village. Juxtaposed to it, we find poetic scenes that portray female tenderness, as found in girls and young women who have not yet succumbed to the so-called realities of life.\nThe two female protagonists, Hsiu and Hui-hua,  have not yet surrendered their dreams when we observe them in the initial sequences of the film. But it is clear that they cannot escape the pressures of village society. Whatever their subjective longings, how can they turn a blind eyes to the expectations of their next of kin that are anchored in tradition? We see that these expectations are in turn influenced by social customs and by fear of gossip among neighbors. But also by the spontaneous comprehension that social roles have to be accepted if families want to make ends meet and if the local economy of a fishing village is to function \u2018as it always did.\u2019\nWhen Hsiu succumbs to the expectations of her family that, at her age, she should marry and obey her husband, Hui-hua commits suicide. The one surrenders to the \u2018force of circumstances\u2019 \u2013 the others finds only a self-destructive way out. Yet this act expresses her rebellion, her protest and revolt, and it lays bare the source of the female alliance of hope and the alternative vision it embodied. Instead of wife-beating, it was caressed that these young human beings longed for when they made their initial vow to each other that they would never marry. They had sensed the injustice enshrined in the old game of master and slave, they did not want words and deeds that boss and command and leave no alternative. They desired human respect, equality, careful awareness of each other's needs.  And for a short time, enabled by their affection for each other,  they lived like that, turning to each other, experiencing the secluded, intimate freedom of a human relationship that was  genuine and reciprocal in their acceptance of each other's dignity. It was like this that  exploitation could give way to cooperation, rule to freedom. It embodies, as a relationship of merely two human beings, an entire vision of how humans could live together.\nWhen the film turns to the intimate scenes that show the closeness of these young women who comprehend their relationship in a traditional way, by seeing themselves as \u2018sister-spouses,\u2019 we begin to understand their affection for each other as the support that is necessary to resist the wrong, antiquated, patriarchal social relations that dominate village society.

One day a girl named Reshma is admitted to Sunny's hospital by her brother Roy, who is a close friend of Sunny. Sunny is led to Reshma's room, where he catches a glimpse of the trashed-out room, with Reshma crouching in a corner, in a highly agitated state. She is later brought to the hospital, and we see her less agitated, but with a vacant expression, suggestive of a dissociation from her surroundings. While she is managed with tranquilizers, Sunny probes into her background. He discovers a few clues in her diary. There are traits of heightened emotionality in her writings \u2013 letters to her mother, who died when she was ten. Her brother adds that she had a transient psychotic episode when their mother had died.\nSunny tries to explore the trigger for the current psychotic episode. From the placards he shows her, he gathers that there is a connection with the sea, for Reshma becomes highly agitated when she sees a placard depicting the sea. With further clues, he associates it to the mysterious disappearance of her boyfriend, Arun. He subjects Reshma to hypnosis and elicits the whole story of how a mafia group closes in on the duo at the beach, and kill Arun, whose body is washed into the sea, while Reshma watches helplessly. Reshma is made to narrate the event and she is also given a guarded exposure to the sea, which cures her of her sea phobia. And thus, we see Reshma gradually recovering from her dissociation. She focusses on her surroundings and develops a special bonding with one of the inmates (Sukumari), in whom she sees a mother figure.\nHer recovery is complicated by her fundamental emotional insecurity and dependent personality. When Sukumari is discharged from the asylum, Reshma's unconscious seeks a strong replacement for Arun and she clings to Sunny. Sunny's personality and his degree of involvement with Reshma makes it easy for her to transfer her emotions for Arun towards Sunny. With an unconscious that refuses to come to terms with Arun's permanent loss, and that refuses to acknowledge the loss of a relationship in which Reshma's involvement was overt (with dependence), Reshma's unconscious transfers the relationship to the receptive and reciprocative Sunny (the phenomenon of transference, described by Freud). And thus, her dependence shifts to Sunny.\nThe movie takes a final turn when at Sunny's wedding party, Reshma finds herself disturbed by the sound of the drums and the sight of the drummer (Arun was a drummer). In a fit of psychosis, Reshma murders Sunny's wife, Annie. \nThe majority of the movie is a flashback to 7 years ago. Sunny receives a call from Roy stating Reshma is now normal.

She desperately wants to move out of the wretched Calcutta for a better future of her children, a daughter (who's completed MA but never appeared of the examination) and a son about whom she's very sad. Her daughter Damayanti (Neena Gupta) quit studies and is a communist revolutionary on parole. Venu realizes that they are no one but his own uncle's family, his uncle Kunjunni Panicker whom he admired so much, a poet and revolutionary who left home long back (probably to join Bose's INA) when Venu was a child.\nVenu visits home in Kerala, a typical matrilineal nair household, to discuss about his chance meeting with Kunjunni uncle's family and also to secure their rightful share for them. Venu's mother has no sympathies for Arthi Panicker and her kids. Kunjunni uncle's land is in possession of Venu's aunt Bhavani (Padmini) who, as a beautiful teenager had loved Kunjunni.Venu remembers his childhood days where he used to run secret errands for a young Bhavani played by Shobana. Aunt Bhavani is more sympathetic towards Arthi. Having never met the wife and children of the man she once loved, she's curious about them. She agrees to give them the land or money, whatever is convenient to them. (One gets the impression that at the late time of her life Bhavani is leading a lonely, guilt-ridden life, having destroyed the lives of both the brothers \u2014 she married Anandan who commits suicide, probably due to unhappy marriage.)\nVenu returns to Calcutta and reveals his identity to Aunt Arthi. She is pleasantly surprised; she and Damayanti finally feel a sense of security and belonging in their lives. But Arthi rejects the financial help from her husband's family who hadn't allowed her to enter the compound of the house when she visited them years back. Arthi narrates the humiliation of having to return on a hot summer afternoon from the locked gates of her husband's ancestral house, she and Kunjunni breaking down on their way back. Immediately after their return to East Bengal, the country gains independence and in the consequent partition they sought refuge in Indian side. Kunjunni dies of cholera in the refugee camp and a pregnant Arthi is left on her own in abject poverty, with two-year-old Damayanti by her side.\nVenu meets Damayanti's brother who is also a communist revolutionary hiding from the police. Venu's arrival into their life brings long lost hope and happiness. But its short-lived as its time for Venu to return to the Andaman Islands with the selected refugees. As the rest of Calcutta celebrates Durga puja, a few bunch of refugee families are packed in the back of a goods truck and offloaded at the harbor. Arthi and Damayanti arrive at the harbor to see him off. Damayanti is not able to control her emotions and breaks down inconsolably as Venu hugs her, himself overcome by sadness. Arthi Panicker looks on emotionless, here face hardened by years of victimization.\nThe film ends tragically as Venu has to rush hastily into the ship about to depart, abruptly ending his goodbye to his uncle's family. As Venu rushes through the crowded stairways of the ship, a crying Damayanti shouts from behind, \"Write to me Dada... Damayanti Panicker, Apilore Central Jail, Calcutta\".\nThe ship moves towards Andaman, beginning a new journey, a new era for a few Vasthuharas, towards the green shores of a new promised land somewhere in the eastern islands, a land new hope. But even as a handful of them find hope, another wave of exodus begins, which ends in the Indo-Pak Bangladesh liberation war in December 1971.\nDisplaced from their homes, unwanted outsiders in their land of refuge, doing sundry small-time jobs, working in abject conditions as bonded laborers, some wait to return to their land, some simply give up, and some others like Damayanti and her brother, become rebels.", "tmdb_id": 264365}, "2963622": {"title": "Vegas in Space", "plot": "Captain Dan Tracey and his two lieutenants are ordered to investigate trouble on the resort planet Clitoris, a pleasure world filled with shopping and gambling where, according to the Articles of the Venus Convention, only women are allowed.

He is romantically involved with Lia, the estranged wife of an Italian Industrialist, and befriended by Italo Bianchi, a politically left-leaning lecturer at a Rome university.\nThe story happens against the backdrop of politically charged atmosphere and student unrest, in which the infamous Red Brigades commit their spate of violent attacks which rocked northern Italy in the 1970s, culminating in the kidnapping and later murder of Aldo Moro, former Italian Prime Minister.\nAs part of a plan to write a commercial novel and raise money to marry and support Lia in the style to which she is accustomed, Raybourne researches the activities and organization of the Red Brigades. He writes the draft of a novel, realistic but fictitious, with the plot centered on the kidnapping of a central political figure by the Red Brigades. During this time Raybourne meets a beautiful and sexually provocative young photojournalist, Alison King. She is eager for a news story and is introduced by Raybourne to Bianchi. Alison becomes convinced that Raybourne knows something about the Red Brigades and is hiding a potential scoop from her, so after a sexual dalliance she searches his apartment and finds Raybourne's novel draft. She brings this to the attention of Bianchi who, despite his mild manner and seemingly moderate politics, is actually collaborating with the Red Brigades. He delivers the draft to a Red Brigades contact and the similarity of his fictitious plot to their actual kidnap plans causes them to conclude that their plans have been leaked. Raybourne realizes he is being hunted when the Brigades shoot his boss Pierre Bernier dead at the newspaper office, moments before Raybourne himself arrives. He then attempts to escape with Alison with the aid of Lia.\nIt turns out that Lia is even more deeply involved with the Red Brigades than Bianchi, and after a chase, Raybourne and Alison are captured. They are held while the kidnapping of Aldo Moro takes place. After this is achieved, the Brigades leadership accuses Lia of the leak and shoots her for her apparent betrayal right before Raybourne's and Alison's eyes. They force Alison to photograph the body and instruct Raybourne to publicize the story as a warning to any future traitors.\nRaybourne is interviewed on American television regarding the successful publication of a now non-fiction book about the Red Brigades and his contact with them, with a postscript saying that Moro was found shot to death in the trunk of a car nearly two months after his kidnapping.", "tmdb_id": 31922}, "54247982": {"title": "Yeh Aag Kab Bujhegi", "plot": "The movie begins with a play where Professor Krishnanand is giving a social message against dowry.

The central story-line is about a murder investigation involving one of the central characters Chris (Valentine Nonyela) and his relationship with his girlfriend Tracy (Sophie Okonedo).\nThe second narrative involves the relationship between a gay punk Billibud (Jason Durr) and a soulboy Caz (Mo Sesay) and the racism and homophobia they face in both West Indian and white British communities. The film is a love story that can be seen as an allegory for racial and class solidarity, as their love transcends class and race barriers.\nSet in London in June 1977, the plot takes place against the background of the Queen's Silver Jubilee. The film begins as buddy movie between two friends, Chris and Caz, who run a pirate radio station from a tower block in Dalston, East London. The film starts with the murder of their friend TJ while cruising for sex in the local park at night. While Caz is distraught by the death of his friend, Chris seems focused on balancing a professional career in commercial radio without selling out. They both want to promote soul music while the prevailing popular music is punk.\nThe murder and the different paths they diverge on causes tension between buddies Chris and Caz. Chris discovers that he has a tape recording of the murder but fails to hand it in as evidence. He is then pulled in by the police as a suspect because he was in possession of TJ's cassette radio. He tries to call Caz but Caz is busy with his new boyfriend, Billibud, who is a punk that espouses the views of the Socialist Workers Party while wearing (admittedly stolen) Vivienne Westwood designer T-shirts. The character Billiibud gets his name from the fictional character \"Billy Budd\" from Herman Melville's novel \"Billy Budd, Sailor\". In this novel Billy Budd is described as \"renowned for his good looks and gentle, innocent ways\". Similarly, in the film Billibud is known for being good looking. However, in Melville's novel the character is also known for being on the less intelligent and gullible side, as seen for his \"inability to perceive ill will in other people\" and has an \"unpredictable tendency to stutter\". In comparison, in the film Billibud is also portrayed as somewhat dimwitted.Chris and Caz then have a showdown on the roof of the tower block and Chris nearly falls off the roof. He then meets Tracy and she persuades him to send the tape to the police, but not before he has made a copy. They then make love on a rooftop. On the day of the Silver Jubilee celebrations Caz and Billibud go to the street fair, where Billibud is attacked by local skinheads. Caz and Billibud return home and make love. That evening Chris goes to the radio station but Caz is not there and the studio has been vandalised. He starts broadcasting \"Funk the Jubilee\" but feels is not the same without his partner, Caz. Chris is then attacked by TJ's murderer, who turns out to be someone he and Caz had thought of as a friend. He escapes but cannot find Caz.\nA grand reckoning takes place at an open-air disco in the park where TJ was murdered. While Caz and Billibud are MCing, Chris attempts to warn them about the revelations regarding TJ's murderer. A Molotov cocktail is thrown onto the stage and Caz and Billibud begin trying to save the vinyl records. Chris puts on the tape of TJ's murder, but doing so requires going onto the stage. TJ's murderer, a member of the National Front, follows Chris on stage, whereupon he falls to his death in the inferno of his own creation.\nThe scene is a bitter-sweet microcosm of the racial and sexual tensions of 1970s Britain, with skinheads hassling Chris and Caz, whites making snide remarks about how things have changed since their youth, and blacks stating that they are unable to decide if they hate whites, mixed-race people or \"batty boys\" most. Yet, despite all of this, youth in the clubs are enjoying the music, drinking, dancing and bonking inter-racially while paying no mind to the gay men around them.\nThe film ends with the two DJs reconciling their differences while they clean records, which is followed by a one-by-one each of the friends joining into dance together.", "tmdb_id": 31785}, "2566582": {"title": "Zandalee", "plot": "Zandalee Martin is a young boutique store owner living in New Orleans who is sexually frustrated and feeling unfulfilled with her marriage to Thierry Martin, and eventually gets tangled in a passionate, sensual and torrid adulterous affair with her husband's mysterious and free-spirited old friend Johnny Collins.

After Iria finally manages to capture Zeiram, Teppei comes across her. He asks her to free Kamiya, which she reluctantly agrees to. Zeiram causes a distraction while trapped, using one of his monsters to lure Iria back to Earth. The ensuing fight damages the teleportation unit. Teppei saves Kamiya from a sneak attack by the monster Zeiram summoned, but Kamiya accidentally shoots the lock to Zeiram's prison, freeing the creature.\nIria tries teleporting back to the Zone but is set back by a power failure. Teppei and Kamiya hotwire a car, using it to incapacitate Zeiram. The human-like face on Zeiram's \"hat\" attacks them, biting Kamiya. Teppei and Kamiya escape soon after. Bob speculates that Zeiram is a forbidden biological weapon whose \"hat\" is used to eat other beings and use what he has consumed to produce his monster subordinates. Zeiram's attempt to make a subordinate copy of Kamiya ends in failure and he kills it in anger.\nAfter a brief break to address Kamiya's wounds, Teppei receives a communicator from Iria. She explains the problems with the transporter and that the Zone itself will not last for much longer. They agree upon Teppei and Kamiya waiting it out as long as they can until Iria can get back to the Zone. Iria and Bob decide to bring a powerful weapon called the Metis Cannon to fight Zeiram, despite the personal risk it causes them to use it without prior approval. Kamiya hijacks construction equipment to save Teppei from Zeiram before Iria returns to shoot Zeiram with a bazooka.\nZeiram soon recovers, shedding his skin to take on a giant skeletal form. Iria defends Teppei and Kamiya as they retrieve the Metis cannon from the spot Bob transported it to. Iria traps the \"hat\" with eight minutes to spare before the Zone breaks down.
