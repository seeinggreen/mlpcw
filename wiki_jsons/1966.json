The strict Miss Agatha Andrews is the head of the mission, assisted by the meek Miss Argent. Charles Pether is a mission teacher who always wanted to be a pastor; his peevish, panicky, self-centered and domineering middle-aged wife Florrie is pregnant for the first time. Emma Clark is the only young staff member and Miss Andrews treats her Emma as if she were her daughter.\nThe mission is elated to learn that a much-needed doctor is arriving, but they are shocked to discover that Dr. Cartwright is a Chicago woman who smokes, drinks alcohol, swears, wears pants, has short hair, disdains religion and sits before grace. Miss Andrews and Dr. Cartwright are soon at odds. Emma, who has led a very sheltered life, is fascinated by the newcomer, much to Miss Andrews' dismay.\nAfter she has settled in, Dr. Cartwright urges Miss Andrews to provide money to send Florrie to a modern facility to birth her baby, as Florrie's advanced age places her at high risk, but Andrews refuses.\nMeanwhile, rumors arise of atrocities committed by the militia of Mongolian warlord Tunga Khan. Miss Andrews is certain that the mission will be safe, as they are American citizens. After a nearby, even poorer British mission is sacked by Tunga Khan, Miss Andrews reluctantly accepts survivors Miss Binns, Mrs. Russell and Miss Ling, but only for a short time, as she is unwilling to harbor those of any other denomination for long.\nImmediately after the arrival of the survivors, a cholera outbreak erupts. Dr. Cartwright quickly takes command, treating all the Chinese of the area. Miss Andrews' initial hostility to her subsides when Emma becomes sick and she implores Dr. Cartwright to save her life. After the emergency has subsided and Emma is well again, the relationship between Andrews and Cartwright begins to soften, but it deteriorates when Cartwright appears in the dining room drunk with a bottle of whiskey and tries to convince all of the pious women to drink as well.\nOne night, Charles and Cartwright see a fire on the horizon and hear gunfire. The next morning, the Chinese soldiers of the nearby garrison evacuate in a hurry, as Tunga Khan and his men are believed to be approaching. Miss Andrews is still convinced that the mission is untouchable, but Charles is now determined to be assertive. Kim, an English-speaking male Chinese mission staff member, and Charles drive out to investigate the situation, while urging everyone else to be prepared to leave the mission, despite Miss Andrews' opposition. After a while, they hear the car's horn, but once the gate is opened, bandits on horseback charge through, firing their guns, and quickly take command of the mission. Before being executed by the bandits, Kim tells the women that Charles was murdered when he tried to rescue a woman being raped by Tunga Khan's men. Then Miss Ling, coming from a powerful Mandarin family, is taken away to act as servant to Tunga Khan's young wife, while the seven white women are herded into a shed.\nThe women watch as Tunga Khan has every Chinese in the mission executed. Tunga Khan then comes into the shed and tries to take Emma. Realizing that they are mostly American women, he decides to ask for a ransom instead.\nWith Miss Andrews panicking and Florrie in labor, Dr. Cartwright asks for her desperately needed medical bag. Tunga Khan offers to exchange it for her sexual submission to him. The doctor agrees, and helps Florrie give birth to a baby boy. After Cartwright goes to fulfill her end of the bargain, an increasingly deranged Andrews vilifies her, repeatedly calling her \"whore of Babylon.\" The others understand the sacrifice the doctor has made and why she has done so.\nIn the evening, the Mongols gather in a circle and take part in wrestling matches for entertainment. Dr. Cartwright watches the spectacle at Tunga Khan's side as his new concubine. When the lean warrior, who has been ogling Cartwright all evening, steps into the ring to face the winner of a bout, Tunga Khan insists on accepting the challenge himself and breaks the man's neck.\nCartwright convinces Tunga Khan to free the other women. Before Miss Argent leaves, she sees Dr. Cartwright hide a bottle that she had earlier called poison. She urges Cartwright not to do what she is planning, but to no avail. With the others safely away, Cartwright, now in a geisha outfit, goes to Tunga Khan's room and secretly poisons two drinks. She subserviently offers a cup to Tunga Khan as she utters, \"So long, ya bastard.\" After Tunga Khan drinks, he immediately falls dead.

Before doing so, he pours salt and pepper on Jerry, who sneezes himself away from the plate due to the pepper. While looking for Jerry, Tom notices the mouse in the cuckoo clock. Tom turns the clock's hands up to 5:00 and he waves to Jerry. He does it a second time and turns it up to 4:00. Tom licks the mouse but the third time when he turns it up to 3:00, instead of Jerry, a bomb pops out. Tom swallows it without realizing it and it explodes inside his mouth, taking his teeth away from his mouth and into the clock. The credits are shown with Tom and Jerry skiing as they chase in the Alps.\nRight there, the chase ends when Jerry rushes inside a cabin, as Tom does so, but with the latter getting out from the fact that the cabin has a St. Bernard dog, who is sleeping. Jerry, waving at Tom proudly, is beside the St. Bernard. Tom got frustrated after seeing it as his anger melted him almost fully to the snowy ground. But, he thought of a plan to get rid of the St. Bernard and catch Jerry. He settles his skiing equipment as if it is showing that a person is in a skiing accident. Finishing his plan, he then yells for the St. Bernard to wake up and come for Tom's diversion. With the St. Bernard woken up from Tom's yelling, he goes to the \"victim\" for \"help\". After the St. Bernard left, Jerry has no protection as Tom has the opportunity to get him. The St. Bernard then reaches the diversion and attempts to save the \"victim\". Not knowing it is a trick, he picks up the ski boots with the bindings and expects that the \"victim\" is landed much deeper. Not willing to give up, he then digs the ground to find the \"victim\".\nIn the cabin earlier, Tom chases Jerry in circles, until the mouse breaks off and runs directly near the open door outside, as Tom does also. Unbeknownst to the cat, he went too fast and is far off the cliff, with Jerry still on the ground, safe. Tom then got worried that he was stupid and then lets himself fall with a waving goodbye. As he fell, he then got rolled up into a giant snowball while being rolled down from a slope, as the end point causes him to be thrown up to the sky. Jerry then calls on the St. Bernard, who is still digging, by a whistle. The dog then stops after he hears Jerry's whistle. The mouse then points the dog to an approaching giant snowball with Tom inside. After the ball lands with Tom inside flat, the St. Bernard then attempts to save the flattened cat with a keg of brandy. After he left the cat standing, Tom fell off and \"shattered\" into pieces. However, he is then reconstructed by the St. Bernard with the brandy. The alcohol makes Tom drunk. He starts seeing hallucinations, like five Jerrys, which he tries to count in between hiccups. He later sees hallucinations of a hole and he seems to see countless holes. Tom hiccups to the real hole, causing him to get frozen solid, requiring the St. Bernard's assistance once again. At the end of this part, once again, Tom becomes intoxicated, causing himself to ski on his feet as he hiccups. Jerry and the dog watch at him, as they shake hands for his \"cure\". Tom then unintentionally bumps his head onto a tree, causing himself to be unconscious as the dog felt worried, trying to make him cure.\nInside the cabin (where the St. Bernard lives), Tom has come down with a cold as Jerry watches him, feeling worried. Tom sneezes and then asks Jerry to get some tissue near him to wipe his nose. Unbeknownst to the mouse, Tom is actually tricking Jerry by grabbing him. Tom is about to eat the mouse when the St. Bernard dog pours the boiling water on the tub, causing Tom to turn red and free Jerry as he feels it on his feet. In a high temperature, Tom jumps very high, leaping from the cabin, and landing in a faraway place. He returns to the cabin, however, because he \"forgot\" to get Jerry, grabbing him as he blows a raspberry to the dog before leaping off again, with Jerry.

The narrator states that the film will not tell its audience what to think about these events, but rather that the viewer will have to make up their own minds about what they see.\nSomewhere in sub-Saharan Africa, the natives celebrate the British relinquishing control and allowing them to establish their own government. Celebrations start with fireworks but end with mobs of locals destroying imported goods from European countries or African colonies that have not yet gained independence, such as Portugese eggs and South African oranges and beer. In Kenya, Mau Maus are causing trouble for the British. One of the Mau Maus is arrested for the mass murder of an entire family of white farmers and their staff. After the massacre, 100 Mau Maus descended on the farm and tortured the animals and committed cannibalism. The surviving animals must be euthanized out of mercy. The organizer of the crimes is sentenced to hard labor for life. In the White Highlands area, many white farmers, unwilling to remain without the protection of their governments, sell their farms at a loss and prepare to leave the continent forever. The lawns and gardens of their homes are then bulldozed by the new owners to make way for more farmland. The coffins of dead homeowners are exhumed and are taken by their families to be buried again on another continent. Armies of poachers descend on the savanna, now no longer protected as wildlife preserves. Hundreds of animals, including many elephants, are killed for their pelts and ivory. The British still do their best to protect the wildlife, by moving wildlife preserves and giving medical care to injured baby animals who were orphaned by poachers. A poaching operation is stopped by authorities, and they discover that the poachers had used grenades to kill 300 baby elephants. Hundreds of rotting animals, mainly zebras and gazelles, that had been killed and left by poachers must be burned by authorities for health reasons. \nIn Zanzibar during its revolution, revolutionaries massacre Arab civilians as revenge for Sultinate oppression that occurred almost a millennium prior. The camera crew arrives in Zanzibar from Tanganyika and attempts to land, but they are not granted permission. They attempt to land anyway, but are shot at and narrowly manage to take off again and escape. A second plane containing three German journalists is unable to leave, and the plane is burned. Between January 18 and 20, 1964, a genocide occurs in Zanzibar, with endless lines of captive Arab civilians are marched at gunpoint to a location where they will be shot by a firing squad. The bodies of countless thousands, some in mass graves and most others strewn across the ground, are photographed from a helicopter. The narrator confirms that this footage is the only documentation to prove that this genocide ever took place. Entire Arab villages march to the sea in a futile attempt to escape the carnage, despite the fact that there is no way off of the island. The filmmakers fly over the beach again the following day and find the bodies of all the villagers who tried to get to the ocean. The genocide claimed the lives of approximately 5,000 Arab and South Asian civilians (estimates range up to 20,000 in the aftermath).

In Dar es Salaam, president Nyere has gone into hiding because mutinous army troops have taken over the city. Crowds block the bodies of slaughtered Arabs from the camera. Arab shops and houses are destroyed by rioting civilians and Arabs are lined up against a wall and shot. An Arab attempting to flee into the sea is drowned by a mob.

The paratroopers and white mercenaries force the rebels to bury the victims of a massacre which resulted in 12,000 black enemies of the revolution being tortured, killed and eaten, 80 children being burned alive, 74 whites killed, and four white nurses raped. In addition, nine nuns, seven missionaries and four white children were tied together and shot in the mouths and their livers eaten. Thousands of white civilians are rescued by the Belgians and mercenaries that were transported on American planes, and the African governments accuse the Americans of unlawfully interfering in their affairs. At a Catholic mission northeast of Stanleyville, on the border of Congo and Sudan, more than 100 nuns, priests and children are held by a band of rebels who control the Ituri Rainforest.

But he discovers that Gina is merely acting in a low-budget film shooting on the street. Vanucci realizes that the smuggling job will improve his family's life. He makes contact with Okra and his female accomplice and agrees to smuggle the gold into Italy for half of the take. Two policemen are constantly on Vanucci's trail, and he uses disguises and tricks to throw them off.\nAfter watching a crowd mob the over-the-hill American matin\u00e9e idol Tony Powell, it strikes Vanucci that movie stars and film crews are idolized and have free rein in society. This insight forms the basis of his plan. Posing as an Italian neo-realist director named Federico Fabrizi, he intends to bring the gold ashore in broad daylight as a scene in an avant-garde film. To give the picture an air of legitimacy, he cons Powell to star in the film, which is blatantly titled The Gold of Cairo (a play on The Gold of Naples, a film that De Sica directed in 1954). Powell's agent, Harry, is suspicious of Fabrizi, but his vain client wants to do the film. Fabrizi enlists the starstruck population of Sevalio, a tiny fishing village, to unload the shipment, but when the boat carrying the gold is delayed, Fabrizi must actually shoot scenes for his phony film to maintain the ruse.\nThe ship finally arrives, and the townspeople unload the gold, but Okra double-crosses Vanucci and drives off with the gold. A slapstick car chase ensues and Okra, Vanucci and the police crash into each other. Vanucci, Tony Powell, Gina, Okra and the villagers are accused of being co-conspirators. Vanucci's \"film\" is shown as evidence in court, where a film critic proclaims the disjointed footage to be a masterpiece. Vanucci confesses his guilt, thereby exonerating the villagers, but vows to escape from prison once again. He escapes by impersonating the prison doctor again, this time tying the doctor up in his cell and walking out of the prison in his place. But when he attempts to remove his fake beard, Vanucci discovers that the beard is real and exclaims, \"The wrong man has escaped!\"", "tmdb_id": 19137}, "53618735": {"title": "Agent 505: Death Trap in Beirut", "plot": "Interpol Agent 505 Richard Blake battles a  mysterious criminal known as \"the Sheik\" who plans to eliminate the population of Beirut by dropping radioactive mercury on the city.", "tmdb_id": 246264}, "4642099": {"title": "Agent for H.A.R.M.", "plot": "Adam Chance (Peter Mark Richman), works for an American agency, H.A.R.M.

In the course of the chase, Mustapha and David struggle at the zoological gardens, when another man intervenes and kills Mustapha. He identifies himself as Inspector Webster with CID. When a guard approaches, Webster kills him before revealing that he is working with Yasmin. Webster knocks David unconscious.\nDavid awakes in a moving panel van in the presence of Webster, Yasmin and another of Yasmin's boyfriends, Yussef Kassim, who is looking for the cipher. David, seeing the bag of candies on a shelf in the van, tells Yussef that Beshraavi has the cipher. They use truth serum on David, after which he talks what they believe is gibberish about the number \"9\". Believing that he was telling the truth about Beshraavi, Yussef tells Yasmin to work on Beshraavi while they throw David out of the vehicle.\nThe next morning, Yasmin arrives home and tells Beshraavi that Yussef, for whom the cipher was originally intended, killed David and Mustapha but does not yet know the coded message. While Yasmin believes Beshraavi has the cipher, Beshraavi states that David must still have it. Later, Yasmin bursts into David's apartment as he finishes a phone conversation with Jena. She convinces him that she hates Yussef and pretends to help him because his boss, a General Ali orchestrating a military takeover, has her mother and sisters hostage. She tells him he needs to crack the cipher so she can report back to the embassy, which will ensure their safety.\nDavid and Yasmin go to the construction site Yussef uses as his front. They spot the van but Webster takes the candies to eat. Following him, David and Yasmin watch him discover the cipher and telephone someone from a phone booth; they learn that person is Beshraavi, with whom Webster is entering into a double cross against Yussef. Beshraavi and Webster are to meet at the Ascot racetrack.\nAt Ascot on race day, Yasmin is with Beshraavi, while David searches for Webster. David and Yasmin make plans to meet at 9:00 p.m. that evening at Trafalgar Square, after David gets the cipher from Webster. At the track, David spots Webster rendezvousing with Sloane, who hands over an envelope of money. David knocks the cipher out of Webster's hand and the envelope floats into the track with the horses approaching. As David and Webster struggle, Sloane attempts to stab David but accidentally kills Webster. David runs onto the track and retrieves the cipher just before the horses gallop by.\nDavid makes copies of the cipher, mailing the original to himself for safekeeping. At a news stand he then notices newspaper headlines which implicate him as Webster's killer. David believes that Mrs. Ragheeb may know something important about the cipher. He visits her at home and shows it to her, also giving her the news that her husband has been killed (she was living secluded and had not heard).  Mrs. Ragheeb examines the cipher and tears it up in frustration, implying that she knew that Ragheeb was working on something dangerous. David also tells her that he is working with Yasmin, whose mother and sisters are in danger at the hands of General Ali. Mrs. Ragheeb replies that Yasmin is lying, in that she has no mother or sisters, only a father who happens to be General Ali.\nThat night, David hops into Yasmin's car and they drive off. Angry at Yasmin's deceit, David lies, telling her that he does not have the cipher with him but has decoded the message and makes up a nonsense meaning to tell her. She relays that information to the embassy via telephone regardless. David and Yasmin arrange to meet later at the hotel where he is staying. After she drops him off, David flags down a taxi and follows her to Yussef's construction site. David sees Yussef operating a wrecking ball, swinging it repeatedly attempting to kill Yasmin. David rushes to save her and Yussef is electrocuted to death by a live wire.\nDavid determines that the hieroglyphics are simply a version of the nursery rhyme \"Goosey Goosey Gander\".  He then looks for secret writing on it, such as invisible ink and getting it wet the ink washes away, leaving a speck which he determines is a microdot.  At a scientific store they examine the dot under a microscope and it reads \"Beshraavi plans assassinate Jena twelve thirty June eighteenth\" which is in 20 minutes.  They don't know where to go, until Yasmin sees on a newscast that Jena has just landed at the airport.  David and Yasmin make it to the airport a few minutes before 12:30, where David shoves past security guards to Jena, who is beginning a welcoming speech. David knocks Jena to the ground just as bullets from Sloane's machine gun land where Jena was just standing. Lufti then shoots Jena dead with a pistol. Yasmin whisks David off and convinces him that the man who was just shot is only an imposter of Jena.\nThey discover that the real Jena was abducted by Beshraavi and locked in a trunk in the back of a truck. David and Yasmin hide in the truck and free Jena just as the van arrives at Beshraavi's country estate.  David, Yasmin and Jena quickly escape on horses from his stables, being pursued through crop fields by a farm combine with sharp blades. Beshraavi and Sloane also pursue them in a helicopter. As they cross the disused Crumlin steel-girder railway viaduct, David drops a wooden ladder down into the rotors of the helicopter as it passes underneath, causing it to crash and burn.

As a result of the affair she had become pregnant, however she abstained from telling Sohail as he had finally found the job of his dreams and was going away to work. So she had the baby, hid the child from the world and awaited Sohail's return. But he never came. She entrusts Najma with the responsibility of taking care of the child and keeping her secret. Najma agrees and takes her home, and she leaves the baby with an old peasant in the hills for safekeeping.\nMeanwhile, in Karachi, the son of Seth Khan Bahadur (Zahoor Ahmed), Nasir (Waheed Murad), leads a privileged life and is habitual of going to nightclubs and various parties with his friend Shahid (Nirala). One day, after coming home late from a night club, his father catches him red handed and proceeds to scold him. After this he tells Nasir that his late friend's wife has sent a letter to him proposing marriage for one of her two daughters and Nasir is to leave the next day for Murree. Nasir is reluctant but has no choice so he agrees, however he is given the choice to choose between the two daughters. Nasir takes his friend Shahid along and on the way switches roles with him, thereby exempting himself from marriage.\nUpon reaching their destination Shahid and Nasir become acquainted with the family and Shahid, acting as Nasir, immediately takes a liking to Dolly. Nasir (acting as Shahid), however, takes a liking to Najma and the two fall in love.\nAfter a while the Shahid and Nasir are told that Seth Khan Bahadur has been invited to Murree to finalize the marriage. Nasir, the real Nasir, comes to the house disguised as his father and successfully fools everyone. However, his real father arrives and exposes the whole truth.\nAfter his father has told him off, Nasir tells him of Najma and how the two are in love and she is the perfect person to take as a wife rather than Dolly or Seema. His father, seeing how serious he is, joyfully agrees. However, when his father talks to Najma's aunt, she reacts strangely and says that Najma is not the innocent girl she seems to be. She then calls the old peasant, who Najma left Seema's baby with, into the room carrying Seema's baby. Najma's aunt asks her to put the baby in his mother's arms. She then puts the baby in Najma's arms, and Najma, bound by her promise to Seema, says nothing. Nasir is shocked by this ill news and refuses to accept it. He desperately tries to persuade Najma to deny the accusation. Najma, sworn to secrecy tells Nasir to forget her. Nasir is crushed and leaves in anger.\nNasir, returned to Karachi, is overcome with depression and resorts to drinking to forget his sadness. His father worries for him and asks him to marry Seema. In Murree, Seema says no to the marriage but is forced into it by her mother. She ventures to find Najma, who now lives with the old peasant and her nephew. She asks Najma to break her promise, but Najma stands by it and tells her to marry Nasir as it is for the best. Finally Seema agrees.\nMeanwhile, in Murree, the nephew of the old peasant tries to force Najma to marry him and in the struggle she apparently kills him. Then she runs away to Karachi with the baby and arrives at Nasir's house.\nNasir is infuriated at her arrival and is repulsed because she brought the baby as well.

One day however, he is caught red handed. But Nasir is unaware that the letters were meant for Seema and not Najma. He confronts Sohail at his house and questions his relationship with Najma. When Sohail reveals the truth, he is awe struck.\nHe confronts Najma and asks her what gave her the right to toy with his emotions and weave this web of lies. He also reveals to Seema's mother who has arrived that Najma had hidden the truth all along and the baby is Seema's. This way she kept away shame from their household. Seema's mother expresses her gratitude to Najma, but tells her to leave because in her midst they would always live in shame.

When the murders and rapes are over, a German knight arrives and bravely kills the bandits. However, as he is healing his wounds he is attacked by two of the surviving villagers and one of the thieves. They throw the wounded knight into a river.\nThe attackers try to sell the knight's armor and weapons to a miserly Jewish merchant who finds among his belongings a letter of donation by the Holy Roman Emperor, granting the knight the fief of Aurocastro, an Apulian town. The parchment is torn at the lower end, which refers to a condition the knight must fulfill to enjoy the donation.\nThe Hungarian bandit comes up with the idea to propose a partnership to a cadet nobleman, so the group can take possession of the aforementioned fief and enjoy its riches. The knight they find is the poor and incompetent, yet well-meaning, Brancaleone da Norcia and they tell him that a noble knight handed them the parchment before dying. Brancaleone initially refuses the plan but after a farcical defeat at a jousting tournament that promised the hand of an overlord's daughter and a wealthy fief, he is too eager to take command of this \"army\" (L'Armata) of underdogs and lead it towards \"fortune\" and \"glory\", in what he sees as an epic journey.\nAs they set up towards the fief, Brancaleone lives several grotesque adventures, inspired by the confused and cosmopolitan world of Italy during Middle Ages; each one of them more hilarious than the last. These include:\n\nA Byzantine knight, Teofilatto dei Leonzi (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), who proposes to fake his capture by the band so they can demand and share a ransom from his father.\nAn entire city seemingly abandoned, which they begin to pillage, until they find out that it was depopulated by plague.\nA fanatical mad monk, Zenone (Enrico Maria Salerno), who promises that those who join his army of Crusaders will be \"healed\" from all ills, having the band follow him to a crusade in the Holy Land. When trying to convince his followers to cross a precarious bridge by leaping upon it (crying out loud that the Lord would protect them), the monk falls down into a deep gorge - this releases the band to follow their previous quest.\nThe rescue of a bride named Matelda (Catherine Spaak), who falls in love with Brancaleone, but is rejected by him due to his oath to take her to her groom; to Brancaleone's misfortune, she avenges herself by losing her virginity to the Byzantine knight (by then a member of the gang); later, while the 'army' is relaxing at her nuptial feast her husband finds out about her state and she accuses Brancaleone of deflowering her.\ngiving in to Teofilatto's plan, the army arrives at his father's castle to demand a ransom. His father refuses to pay, revealing that Teofilatto is his illegitimate child. Meanwhile, a confused Brancaleone has to fend off the sadomasochistically-fueled passion of Teofilatto's aunt, just one example of the inbred Byzantine household.When finally the band reaches the fief, they discover that the missing part of their parchment mentioned that condition for the granting of the fief was that its new ruler should have provided adequate defences against the \"black scourge coming from the sea\", frequent raids by Saracen corsairs. Brancaleone designs a cartoonish Rube Goldberesque trap to defeat the Saracens, but instead the band ends up trapped within. As the band is about to be executed by impalement, it is saved by the knight of the opening scenes, the rightful owner of the fief, thirsty for vengeance against his attackers.\nBrancaleone (who did not know about the attack on the knight) and his army are about to be burned alive when the mad monk arrives out of the blue and saves them from the knight, \"so they can fulfill their duty to go onto the Holy Land\". Being deprived of his dreams of richness, Brancaleone and his band agree to go along with the monk and his followers, saving themselves.

Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist \"Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff\" (acronymed as Kitka), helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego).\nAfter Bruce Wayne fights his way out of captivity, he again disguises himself as Batman, and the Dynamic Duo returns to the United Underworld's HQ, only to find a smoking bomb. Batman is met with frustration rushing all over the docks in hopes of locating a safe place to dispose of the bomb but does so in the nick of time. The Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: the Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile, leaving them highly unstable. Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council, consisting of ambassadors from Japan, the U.S, the U.S.S.R., Israel, France, Spain, West Germany, the United Kingdom, and Nigeria. Giving chase in the Batboat to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable The Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues.\nAlthough Batman and Robin come out on top, Batman is heartbroken to discover that his \"true love\" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the powdered Council members' vials and sneezes on them, scattering the dust. Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate Super Molecular Dust Separator to filter the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people, in general, to learn to live together peacefully on their own.\nWith the world watching, the Security Council is re-hydrated. All members are restored alive and well, but continue to squabble amongst themselves, totally oblivious of their surroundings; however, each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this \"strange mixing of minds\" does more good than harm.

Upon their arrival, they find that the fort has been ravaged by Tuareg attacks and American Beau Graves (Guy Stockwell) is the only survivor.  After his badly injured arm is amputated, he is asked what has happened and his story is revealed in flashback.\nBeau's column had been serving under Lieutenant De Ruse (Leslie Nielsen) and Sergeant Major Dagineau (Telly Savalas), the latter of whom is notorious for his harsh treatment of the men under his command. He is especially sadistic towards Beau's class of recruits, hoping this will get them to reveal to him which of the men is the author of an anonymous letter Dagineau has received threatening his life. Although he has no proof, he suspects Beau, which earns Beau particularly brutal treatment. To ferret out more information, Dagineau uses the services of the slimy toady Boldini (who has reenlisted in the Legion), promoting him to Corporal as reward for his spying on the men.\nBeau's background leads De Ruse to nickname him Beau \"Geste\". Specifically, Beau had run away and joined the Legion after having falsely confessed to an embezzlement actually committed by his business partner. Beau had taken the blame for the sake of his partner's wife, whom Beau also loved. His noble gesture (French: beau geste) had proven futile, however, as the partner confessed and committed suicide just a few months later. That development prompts the suggestion that Beau might reclaim his lost love upon returning home. But, as he later relates to his younger brother John (Doug McClure), who has finally managed to track him down with the same news, he deems it unfair to ask her to wait for him, as he is now committed to a five-year enlistment, with no guarantee he'll survive it. Over brandy, De Ruse informs Beau of Dagineau's background as a former St. Cyr educated officer who was broken to the ranks when his entire command deserted from his leadership.\nDe Ruse and his men are assigned to relieve Fort Zinderneuf, but on the way there the Legion detachment is attacked by the Tuaregs where De Ruse is mortally wounded and is infirmed upon the group's arrival.  With Dagineau back in charge, the brutality returns and it isn't long before the legionnaires mutiny, with everyone except Beau and John set upon executing the sergeant. Just as they are about to do so, the Tuareg attack. Despite their personal hatred for Dagineau, no one doubts his excellence as a battle commander, so Beau convinces the men to release him that he may lead them in defending the fort.\nAs legionnaires are killed in relentless waves of Tuareg attacks, Dagineau props up the bodies of the dead men on the fort's ramparts with their rifles pointing at their attackers. Between attacks, De Ruse speaks privately with Beau and confesses to being the author of the letter. He had hoped to frighten Dagineau into showing more humanity toward his troops. As he dies, De Ruse laments that in fact, it only caused Dagineau to treat the men even more harshly.\nThe legionnaires try to hold out against the attacks, with Dagineau confidently proclaiming that relief is on the way to them.  But eventually, the only ones left alive are Dagineau and Beau, who has a seriously wounded arm.  When the predicted relief column arrives, Dagineau delays their entry so he can settle things with Beau once and for all.  He tells Beau that the Legion is need of heroes, and that all of the dead men around them can be presented as those heroes, so long as no one ever knows that they had mutinied. Therefore, he cannot leave Beau alive to reveal the truth of what had occurred at Fort Zinderneuf. Beau and Dagineau fight, with Beau finally gaining the upper hand and shooting and killing Dagineau.\nBeau's flashback ends to reveal that he has not actually been relating this story to the relief commander who had questioned him about what happened at the fort.  Still awaiting Beau's response, the commander repeats his query, and Beau tells him only that the men laid down their lives protecting the fort. With no mention of Dagineau's brutality, nor of the mutiny, Beau presents the entire group as heroes \u2014 just as Dagineau had wanted.\nThe commander informs Beau that the Legion's high command has decided that Fort Zinderneuf is no longer worth protecting and they will now abandon it. Having lost his arm, Beau will be discharged, and the commander offers his hope that Beau has someone to whom to return.

Tomorrow!\"\nFurther examination of a blurred figure under a bush makes Thomas suspect the man in the park may have been murdered after all, during the time Thomas was arguing with the woman around the bend.\nAs evening falls, the photographer goes back to the park and finds the body of the man, but he has not brought his camera and is scared off by the sound of a twig breaking, as if being stepped on. Thomas returns to find his studio ransacked. All the negatives and prints are gone except for one very grainy blowup of what is possibly the body.\nAfter driving into town, he sees the woman and follows her into a club where The Yardbirds, featuring both Jimmy Page and Jeff Beck on guitar and Keith Relf on vocals, are seen performing the song \"Stroll On\".  A buzz in Beck's amplifier angers him so much, he smashes his guitar on stage, then throws its neck into the crowd. A riot ensues. The photographer grabs the neck and runs out of the club before anyone can snatch it from him. Then, he has second thoughts about it, throws it on the pavement, and walks away. A passer-by picks up the neck and throws it back down, not realizing it is from Beck's guitar. Thomas never locates the elusive woman.\nAt a drug-drenched party in a house on the Thames near central London, the photographer finds Veruschka, who had told him that she was going to Paris; when confronted, she says she is in Paris. Thomas asks Ron to come to the park as a witness, but cannot convince him of what has happened because Ron is incredibly stoned. Instead, Thomas joins the party and wakes up in the house at sunrise. He returns to the park alone, only to find that the body is gone.\nBefuddled, Thomas watches a mime troupe perform a tennis match, is drawn to it, after a bit picks up the imaginary ball and throws it back to the two players. As he watches the mime, the sound of the ball being played is heard and his image fades away, leaving only the grass as the film ends.", "tmdb_id": 1052}, "1198597": {"title": "The Blue Max", "plot": "German Corporal Bruno Stachel leaves the fighting in the trenches to become a fighter pilot in the German Army Air Service. In spring 1918, he sets his sights on winning Germany's highest medal for valour, the \"Blue Max\", for which he must shoot down 20 aircraft.\nOf humble origins (his father ran a small hotel), Lieutenant Bruno Stachel sets out to prove himself. Willi von Klugemann resents having a commoner as his rival. Their commanding officer, Hauptmann Otto Heidemann, is an aristocratic officer whose belief in chivalry and the laws and customs of war conflict with Stachel's disregard for them.\nOn his first mission, Stachel shoots down a British S.E.5, but does not receive credit for it because there were no witnesses (Stachel's wingman Fabian was shot down). Stachel searches the countryside for the wreckage, which gives the impression that he cares more about himself than the death of his wingman.\nSoon afterward, he attacks an Allied two-man observation aircraft and incapacitates the rear gunner. Instead of downing the defenseless aircraft, he signals the pilot to fly to the German base. As they near the airfield, the rear gunner revives and reaches for his machine-gun, unseen by the observers on the ground. Stachel is forced to shoot the aircraft down. A disgusted Heidemann  believes that Stachel has committed a war crime just for a confirmed kill.\nThe incident brings Stachel to the attention of General Count von Klugemann, Willi's uncle. When the general visits the base, he meets Stachel. As Stachel is a commoner, the general sees great propaganda value in him. Meanwhile, Kaeti, the general's wife, is carrying on a discreet affair with her husband's nephew.\nSoon afterward, Stachel is shot down after rescuing a red Fokker Dr.I from two British fighters. When he returns to the airfield, he is stunned when he is introduced to the man he saved, Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. Richthofen offers Stachel a place in his squadron. Stachel declines, explaining his desire to \"prove himself\" with his current squadron.\nWith Stachel temporarily grounded by a minor injury, General von Klugemann orders him to Berlin to help shore up the crumbling public morale. The general invites him to dinner. Later, Stachel and Kaeti have sex.\nSoon afterward, Stachel and Willi volunteer to escort a reconnaissance aircraft. When British fighters attack, Stachel's guns jam, but Willi downs three enemy planes. While returning to base, Willi challenges Stachel to a flying contest, flying under a railway viaduct. Willi clips the top of a tower and crashes. When Stachel reports his death, Heidemann assumes that the verified victories were Willi's. Stachel impulsively claims them, even though he fired only 40 bullets before his guns jammed. Outraged, Heidemann officially accuses him of lying, but the Air Service backs Stachel.\nDuring a strafing mission covering the retreat of the German Army, Stachel disobeys orders and engages enemy fighters. The rest of the squadron follows him. Later, Heidemann confronts him because half his pilots were killed in the ensuing dogfight. Stachel does not care. He has shot down enough aircraft, even without Willi's kills, to qualify for the Blue Max. Enraged, Heidemann submits a report recommending a court-martial.\nBoth men are ordered to Berlin. There, von Klugemann tells Heidemann that Stachel is to receive the Blue Max because the people need a hero. The general orders Heidemann to withdraw his report. Heidemann resigns his command and accepts a desk job.\nLater that evening, Keati visits Stachel and suggests they flee to neutral Switzerland, since defeat is inevitable. Stachel refuses.\nThe next day, Stachel is awarded the Blue Max by the Crown Prince in a well-publicised ceremony. Field Marshal von Lenndorf telephones von Klugermann to order him to stop the ceremony since an investigation has been opened into Stachel's claim. The general asks how the field marshal knew about that. He turns to his wife and realises that she is responsible.\nWhen Heidemann reports that the new monoplane that he has just test-flown is a \"death trap\" with weak struts, von Klugemann sees a way out and tells Stachel, \"Let's see some real flying\".

Her mother sees the stamps and complains to Hubi\u010dka's superiors.\nThe Germans and their collaborators are on edge, since their trains and railroad tracks are being attacked by partisans. A glamorous resistance agent, code-named Viktoria Freie, delivers a time bomb to Hubi\u010dka for use in blowing up a large ammunition train. At Hubi\u010dka's request, the \"experienced\" Viktoria also helps Milo\u0161 to resolve his sexual problem.\nThe next day, at the crucial moment when the ammunition train is approaching the station, Hubi\u010dka is caught up in a farcical disciplinary hearing, overseen by Zedn\u00ed\u010dek, over his rubber-stamping of Zdeni\u010dka's backside. In Hubi\u010dka's place, Milo\u0161, liberated from his former passivity by his experience with Viktoria, takes the time bomb and drops it onto the train from a semaphore gantry, which extends transversely above the tracks. A machine-gunner on the train, spotting Milo\u0161, sprays him with bullets, and his body falls onto the train.\nZedn\u00ed\u010dek winds up the disciplinary hearing by dismissing the Czech people as \"nothing but laughing hyenas\" (a phrase actually employed by the senior Nazi official Reinhard Heydrich). The stationmaster is despondent because the scandal with Hubi\u010dka and Zdeni\u010dka seems to have frustrated his ambition of being promoted to inspector. Then a huge series of explosions happens just around a bend in the track as the train is destroyed by the bomb. Hubi\u010dka, unaware of what has happened to Milo\u0161, laughs to express his joy at this blow to the Nazi occupiers.

Myl\u00e8ne expresses concern over how quickly Edgar is driving, but he refuses to slow down. Edgar defends his driving speed, stating that when he goes fast, his ideas also go fast. He describes how happy the two will be while living in a seaside house and going on long walks. Myl\u00e8ne agrees with Edgar, but asks him once more to slow down. Edgar does not, and shortly thereafter crashes into a tree.\nWe see that Edgar has survived the crash and is passing time watching the tide come in as he stands on an elevated platform located on the  Passage du Gois, a road that gets flooded by the tide. A man drives past and offers Edgar a ride, saying that he will have to wait eight hours to leave otherwise. Edgar passes the ride up and instead watches the tide from the platform.\nEdgar is seen beginning to write a book in scenes that are interspersed with his travels around his new town on the isle Noirmoutier. In these travels, he passes by a house with a stone tower on property that is marked \"off limits.\" There is a solitary figure standing atop the tower, though the two do not interact. Edgar visits a store run by a woman and her daughter. Once Edgar leaves, the daughter remarks that he scared her, but the mother defends him, describing him as quiet but polite. While Edgar is in the outdoor market, Max and Pierre, two linen vendors, take particular note of him\nAs Edgar drives home, Max and Pierre, who have blocked the road, stop him. The two proceed to fake a fight, and when Edgar intervenes, they cover him with a sheet rigged to rip. When it does, Max and Pierre insist that Edgar pays 50 francs for it. In the following scene, the vendors are seen talking to the shopkeeper and explaining that they feel something is amiss with Edgar.\nMax and Pierre then harass Edgar at his home, while he is attempting to enjoy time with his pregnant wife Myl\u00e8ne, who has been rendered mute by the wreck. Edgar is able to drive the two off, but the next time he leaves the house, he finds a pile of sheets next to a dead cat.\nHe tries to find the owner of the dead cat, but it's not the shopkeeper's. He tries the local hotel, where he is accused of killing the cat. The film turns red, he accuses the hotel cook of killing the cat, as they serve cat when they're out of rabbit. He then beats those who accused him of killing the cat with its corpse. The manager of the hotel comes out to intervene and reassure Edgar that her cat is still alive. When Edgar goes to bury the cat, he discovers a strange metallic disc attached to it.\nIt is revealed that everything strange and out of the ordinary that has been transpiring recently is actually a story that Edgar is writing told through his eyes, though it is unclear exactly where the fiction of Edgar's story begins and the reality of his life as a writer ends. Edgar explains that a man who is more of an evil spirit than any kind of man or animal can control others through a remote device, though the batteries only last one hour. In Edgar's story, those who are being controlled are forced into actions that ruin their personal relationships. Each of the characters in Edgar's story are the residents of the town in which he and Myl\u00e8ne currently reside.\nIn his story Edgar becomes suspicious of his neighbor in the tower marked as off limits: Mr. Ducasse. Edgar enlists the linen vendors' help to break into Mr. Ducasse's house and investigate. Once inside, Edgar confronts Mr. Ducasse and forces him to explain the events that have been happening. Mr. Ducasse demonstrates that he can control people remotely, and does so by forcing one of the vendors, Pierre, to nearly jump out of a nearby window. At this point, Pierre decides he has seen enough and leaves. Mr. Ducasse tells Edgar that he will give him all the answers that he wants as long as Edgar can best him in a game that resembles a twisted version of chess. Edgar agrees to this plan.\nIn the game, miniature versions of the residents of the town are placed on a chessboard and driven to interact with one another. A nearby monitor displays a video of all the interactions the residents are having. Edgar must keep the relationships between the characters healthy while Mr. Ducasse attempts to drive them apart by controlling their minds for one minute at a time, during which time the screen turns red. The game proceeds with some relationships surviving and others breaking apart.\nEdgar has seen enough, however, when Mr. Ducasse attempts to have the old man who owns the local hotel rape the shopkeeper's daughter, Suzon. Edgar proceeds to smash all the equipment and fight Mr. Ducasse. The fight proceeds to the top of the tower in the house, where Edgar forces Mr. Ducasse off the ledge to his death.\nThus ends the fictional story that Edgar has been writing. When Edgar next goes to town in an effort to call the local doctor to help Myl\u00e8ne through labor, though, he finds out that the real Mr. Ducasse had committed suicide by jumping from his tower's balcony and dying in the same manner as in Edgar's story.\nThroughout the film, the line between what is fictional and what is really occurring to Edgar Piccoli is blurred. One is never quite sure when the film has stopped following Edgar the writer and begun following Edgar the subject of the novel. One thing that does become clear by the end of the film is that the metal discs are used to control the minds of the residents in the town, which is indicated by the film turning red.

Realising that an explosion at this point would release enough energy to draw the metallic Daleks into the Earth's core, Dr. Who asks Tom and Conway to attempt to deflect the bomb. Brockley also leaves, declining to get involved, and Dr. Who sends Louise and David to help get the prisoners away from the mine. Brockley then betrays Dr. Who, leading a group of Daleks to him. As Dr. Who is led away the Daleks open fire on Brockley, killing him.\nAs Tom and Conway work in the mineshaft to alter the bomb's trajectory, they are discovered by a Roboman. During the ensuing fight Conway and the Roboman fall to their deaths. Tom uses timbers boarding up the old shaft entrance to create a deflecting ramp, then rushes back the surface.\nDr. Who is taken to the mine control room and meets Wyler and Susan. He seizes the radio link to the Robomen and orders them to turn against their masters. As the Robomen fight the Daleks, Dr. Who escapes with Wyler and Susan while the slave workers flee from the mine. The Daleks quickly defeat the rebellion and release their bomb into the shaft, but the device is deflected and detonates at the pole convergence. The Daleks are pulled into the Earth's core and destroyed while their spaceship, having just taken off, is brought crashing down onto the mine and explodes.\nLater, as the travellers prepare to return to the present in Tardis, Tom asks to be taken back to a few minutes before the burglary occurred.

They dismiss him as a lunatic, though his letters claim he will start killing people if he is not taken seriously.\nMeanwhile, pop singer Vicki Robbins (Suzanna Leigh) collapses from exhaustion on television, and is sent to recuperate in a cottage on Seagull Island. This was chosen because her doctor knows Ralph Hargrove. The proprietors of the \"rest home\" are a depressed, disgruntled couple, Ralph and Mary Hargrove (Guy Doleman and Catherine Finn).  Ralph is a beekeeper, as is his neighbor, H.W. Manfred (Frank Finlay).\nVicki begins to notice mysterious happenings. Mary Hargrove's dog and later Mary herself are attacked by the bees and killed, leading Vicki to suspect Hargrove. She and Manfred start to snoop around. Manfred keeps his bees in an apiary within his home, behind a pair of doors, which open to view the bees. He claims to control them via a tape-recording of a high note made by a death's-head moth, which hypnotizes the bees. He encourages her to search through Hargrove's papers, and she discovers that Hargrove has managed to isolate \"the smell of fear\" into a liquid form.  Manfred tells her this must mean that Hargrove has been baiting the bees with this substance. Manfred then goes away seemingly innocently and heroically to Hargrove's house, apparently to get her luggage and a copy of a book. There he asks for Vicki's luggage and to borrow a copy of \"Beekeeping through the Ages,\" a book he seemed to have authored in another version? Vicki finds this and realizes Manfred might be somehow suspicious. Hargrove replies stiffly when he offers to return it, \"Keep it.\" While Hargrove gets the book, after dumping out her luggage for Manfred at his farm, Manfred sneaks in behind him and plants the bee attack scent on Hargrove's jacket. When Hargrove returns with the book, the audience sees the door open a crack, when Hargrove had shut it behind him, when he went in to get the book. Apparently he doesn't notice it, as a clue Manfred had snuck in behind his back.\nVicki's snooping doesn't go unnoticed; bees soon attack her in her room at the cottage. She eventually escapes to Manfred's house, where she decides to stay until she can catch the next boat off the island. When Manfred acts suspiciously, Vicki snoops some more and discovers his secret laboratory, and he admits that he has been causing all of this. He adds that he had intended to kill Hargrove all along, but now that she knows the secret, he must kill her too. She thwarts his attempt, leading him to be stung to death and crash through the banister. She sets fire to the house, escapes, and leaves the island the next day, just as a bowler-hatted ministry official finally arrives to investigate the deaths. Later bees swarm and attack the pubmaster who doubles as a constable apparently, investigating the Hargrove place. The pubmaster grabs Hargove's jacket unwittingly and foolishly and the bees attack him not Hargrove. He thinks Hargrove is trying to kill him (the prevailing theory is Hargrove is the suspicious one as his inquiry turned up little and they didn't vote to destroy his hives), but Hargove chases after him with a smoker, and saves him by telling him to throw away the jacket. The bees then attack the jacket. Hargrove then reveals that the culprit is Manfred who's a \"homicidal\" maniac and that the coat being scented was from Manfred who was trying to kill him, Hargrove. Hargrove and the pubmaster rush over to Manfred's and see the house on fire. They rescue Vicki in the nick of time who was locked inside the house by Manfred, and she's pushed up next to the door, with the body of the dead Manfred before her, stung and burnt to death having fallen over a collapsed staircase.

As the crew faces an unexplained loss of oxygen and must replenish their supply in the lungs, Grant finds the surgical laser needed to destroy the clot was damaged from the turbulence in the heart, as it was not fastened down as it had been before: this and his safety line snapping loose while the crew was refilling their air supply has Grant begin to suspect a saboteur is on the mission. The crew must cannibalize their wireless radio to repair the laser, cutting off all communication and guidance from the outside, although because the submarine is nuclear-powered, surgeons and technicians outside Benes's body are still able to track their movements via a radioactive tracer, allowing General Alan Carter and Colonel Donald Reid, the officers in charge of CMDF, to figure out the crew's strategies as they make their way through the body. The crew is then forced to pass through the inner ear, requiring all outside personnel to make no noise to prevent destructive shocks, but while the crew is removing reticular fibers clogging the submarine's vents and making the engines overheat, a fallen surgical tool causes the crew to be thrown about and Peterson is nearly killed by antibodies, but they are able to reboard the submarine in time.

At the town civic meeting, Lem again notices Vida Downey, a bank teller whom Lem had seen on his first day in town, and eventually attempts to woo away from her boyfriend Ralph Hastings. Lem notices Vida crosses off the YMCA and the 4-H from her list of three possible organizations to keep the town's boys off the streets, leaving only the Boy Scouts, and he decides to suggest and volunteer to become Scoutmaster of the newly formed Troop 1.\nSome time later, Lem becomes an all-around natural leader with the Scout troop, even putting a plan to become a lawyer aside as he helps the town's boys mature into men. Meanwhile, the town's troublemaker boy, Edward \"Whitey\" White Jr., refuses to join the troop. One night, while Lem and Vida are on a date, they catch Whitey stealing from Hughes' store after it is closed for the night. Startled, Whitey falls and sprains his ankle, which Lem bandages using the techniques provided in the Boy Scout Handbook. Impressed by Lem's work, Whitey secretly steals the book, which Lem allows, because he sees his past self reflected in Whitey.

Lem, who never passed the bar, is nonetheless allowed, as an interested party, to ask Hetty some questions at the hearing under oath. His questions of her on the stand reveal that the property was once the location of her family cottage before it burned down in September 1918, two days after she learned that her sons were killed in France. Hetty states that she allowed the troop to meet there, as the boys reminded her of her late sons at play.

Charles has never sold it because scientific testing would reveal that the \"million-dollar\" artwork is fake, and his entire collection would then be suspected. Charles signs the museum's standard insurance policy, then learns it includes his consent to just such a forensic examination. However, withdrawing the Venus from the exhibition would also raise suspicions. Desperate to protect her father, Nicole seeks Simon and asks him to steal the Venus before the examination. Unknown to Nicole, Simon is actually an expert consultant and investigator hired by major art galleries to enhance security and detect forgeries.

Hitler believes that Choltitz will obey his order that the Allies should not be allowed to capture Paris without the Germans destroying it completely, similarly to the planned destruction of Warsaw.\nThe French Resistance learn that the Allies are not planning to take Paris, but are bypassing it to avoid confrontation and are heading straight to Germany instead. The two factions within the Resistance react to this news differently. The Gaullists under Jacques Chaban-Delmas want to wait and see, while the communists under Colonel Rol-Tanguy want to take action. The communists force the issue by calling for a general uprising by the citizens of Paris and by occupying important government buildings. The Gaullists go along with this plan of action once it is set in motion.\nInitially, Choltitz is intent on following Hitler's order to level the city. After his troops fail to dislodge the Resistance from the Paris Police Prefecture, he orders the Luftwaffe to bomb the building but withdraws the order at the urging of Swedish consul Raoul Nordling, who points out that bombs that miss the Prefecture risk destroying nearby culturally invaluable buildings such as the Notre Dame Cathedral. Choltitz accepts a truce offer from the Resistance (conceived by the Gaullist faction), but the communists want to keep on fighting, in spite of a lack of ammunition. Therefore, the truce is shortened to one day and the fighting resumes.\nAfter learning that the Germans plan to destroy Paris (the Eiffel Tower and other landmarks are rigged with explosives), a messenger from the Resistance is sent across enemy lines to contact the Americans. He informs the Allies that the Resistance has already taken control of parts of the city and implores them to provide support to prevent the uprising being crushed as was then happening in Warsaw. He adds that France would never forgive the Allies if they permit the destruction of Paris. Later, General Omar Bradley agrees that the 2nd Armored Division under General Philippe Leclerc should move on Paris.\nAs the German military situation deteriorates, Choltitz delays the order to destroy Paris, believing that Hitler is insane and that the war is lost, making the destruction of Paris a futile gesture. When two SS officers arrive, he thinks that he is to be arrested, but instead they simply state that Himmler has asked them to rescue the Bayeux Tapestry for his private collection prior to the destruction of the Louvre.\nEventually, the French major persuades General Leclerc that it is essential for at least a token force of Allied tanks to move in and occupy Paris, as this symbolic gesture will save the city. A line of Sherman tanks set off. Although the equipment is American, they allow the Free French army to control them with just a small American escort. As the line reaches 50 km (31 mi) from Paris, German troops lay explosives in the Eiffel Tower and under various bridges. The Germans release some of the imprisoned men to help defend their strongpoints. The first Sherman arrives and is hit by an artillery shell, but the other tanks, each named for a French victory in the First World War, reach the H\u00f4tel de Ville.\nCholtitz chooses not to give the order for the detonations and to surrender shortly after the Allies enter the city.

He journeys to the mainland to seek the help of a noted London pathologist, Dr Brian Stanley. Stanley too is unable even to hypothesise what could have happened, so both men seek out Dr David West, an expert on bones and bone diseases. Although Stanley and Landers interrupt West's quiet evening at home with the wealthy jetsetter Toni Merrill, West is intrigued by the problem and so agrees to accompany the two doctors back to Petrie's Island to examine the corpse. In order for them to reach the island that much faster, Merrill offers the use of her father's private helicopter in exchange for the three men allowing her to come along on the adventure.\nOnce back at Petrie's Island, Merrill's father's helicopter is forced to return to the mainland so he can use it, leaving the foursome effectively stranded on Petrie until the helicopter can return. West and Stanley learn that a group of oncology researchers led by Dr Lawrence Phillips, seeking a cure for cancer, have a secluded castle laboratory on the island. Paying a visit to Phillips' lab reveals that he and his colleagues are just as dead (and boneless) as Ian Bellows. Reasoning that whatever it is must have begun in that lab, West, Stanley and Landers gather up Phillips' notes and take them to study them. From them they learn that in his quest to cure cancer, Phillips may have accidentally created a new lifeform from the silicon atom.\nThinking the doctors are at the castle, Constable Harris bikes up there looking for them to tell them about the discovery of a dead, boneless horse, only to wander into the laboratory's \"test animals\" room and be attacked and killed by an offscreen tentacled creature, the result of Dr Phillips's experiments. The creatures are eventually dubbed \"silicates\" by West and Stanley, and kill their victims by injecting a bone-dissolving enzyme into their bodies. The silicates are also incredibly difficult to kill, as Landers learns when he tries and fails to kill one at the castle with an axe when they first encounter them.\nAfter learning all they can from the late Dr  Phillips's notes, West and Stanley recruit the islanders, led by \"boss\" Roger Campbell and store owner Peter Argyle, to attack the silicates with anything they've got. Bullets, petrol bombs, and dynamite all fail to even harm the silicates. But when one is found dead, apparently having ingested a rare isotope called Strontium-90 from Phillips' lab (via Phillips' accidentally irradiated Great Dane), West and Stanley realise they must find more of the isotope at the castle and figure out how to contaminate the remaining silicates with it before it is too late. They obtain enough isotope to contaminate a herd of cattle \u2013 at the cost of Stanley's left hand, when he's grabbed by a silicate \u2013 and the silicates feed on these and begin to die.\nThe story ends with evacuation and medical teams inbound from the mainland, and West commenting on how fortunate they were that this outbreak was confined to an island. Had it happened on the mainland, he notes, they might never have stopped them in time.

The elephant uses her trunk to grab Jerry and places him safely on top of her head. Turning her attention back to Tom, the elephant smacks him underground. She continues hugging the mouse and Tom climbs out of the hole before fainting.\nAnnoyed, Tom watches the clowns walk by until he sees Jerry in a miniature clown outfit. He spies on both the mouse and elephant as they perform a circus dance, passing a ball back and forth. Tom bursts the ball with a slingshot. The elephant looks for her friend in concern while Tom ascends a high-rise ladder to reach the mouse, who is hanging onto the 300-foot (91 m) high wire by his feet. Tom walks across the wire and stomps on it repeatedly, bouncing Jerry into his hands. He walks over the wire back to the ramp only to run into the irate elephant.

Reno is able to defeat the pair, wounding Joe and killing his brother Ed. He takes Joe into custody, retrieves Ed's body and rides with them for Stone Junction. On the way, Joe explains that a posse from the town has been after them, along with the local Native American tribe, led by Chief Little Bear. Encountering several warriors from the tribe, Reno refuses to turn over his prisoner and tells them to explain to Chief Little Bear that Reno, who he recognizes as a man of honor, swears to him that he will seek justice.\nArriving in Stone Junction, Reno is immediately accosted by the mayor, Jess Yates, and the town sheriff, Hodges. Hodges tells Reno he won't put the prisoner in his jail and Yates demands that Reno turn Connors over to him. Reno refuses and browbeats Hodges into allowing him to put Conners in his jail, infuriating Yates. A number of the people of the town openly show hostility to Reno, even attempting to shoot Conners in the street, including Yates's daughter. Reno inquires after  Nona Williams, a girl he once was in love with whom he left years ago after she helped her brother escape from Reno's jail, thinking he was innocent. It turned out her brother was guilty and ended up killing several people while on the run, including his own father. Reno is told by Sheriff Hodges that Nona now owns and runs the local saloon, and Reno goes there looking for her, only to find Yates and his friends instead. While having a drink, Yates threatens Reno and orders him to leave town without his prisoner. When Reno refuses, Yates attacks him and the two men fight. Reno is able to defeat Yates and goes back to the jail, where he finds out that Sheriff Hodges has passed out rifles to some of the townsfolk on Yates's orders.\nReno is suspicious but asks where Nona would be if not in the saloon, and Hodges sends him to Nona's ranch outside of town. Reno rides off to see her. Meanwhile, Yates gathers his men who are armed with the rifles from the sheriff's office. Reno arrives at the ranch and starts to talk to Nona about their past, but they are interrupted by two of Yates's henchmen and held at gunpoint. Reno grows suspicious and voices a theory\u2014that maybe Conners is in fact innocent and the townsfolk want him silenced. The two henchmen inform him that it doesn't matter, and that they'll just hold him at the ranch until Conners is dead. Reno manages to throw a piece of furniture at the guards, distracting them long enough for him to draw and shoot them both dead. He reconciles with Nona and sets off for the town, where he arrives just in time to prevent Hodges from turning Conners over to the armed mob outside. Reno holds the crowd at gunpoint and has Hodges disarm them. The sheriff, his backbone strengthened by reinforcements, seizes the rifles back. Reno and Hodges hole up in the jail where Reno questions Conners and learns that he and his brothers were strangers in town who were plied with drink by the \"friendly\" townsfolk. After being called out into the street to check their horses, Chief Little Bears's son rode by and then appeared to be shot down by a hail of bullets from everywhere, after which the Conners brothers were accused of the crime by an angry mob. Taking advantage of a momentary distraction, Joe and Ed fled into the desert. Reno begins to put the pieces together and realizes that the mayor and his friends likely were the ones who actually killed the Chief's son and are framing Conners to appease the chief and the tribe.\nAfter this, Hodges notices a disturbance in the street and they emerge to find the mayor and his men organizing an evacuation of the town under the guise of fear of an Indian attack. All the women but Nona leave the town along with the children and most of the men. Only about a dozen of Yates's confederates stay behind to \"defend\" the town. Hodges is now convinced of the guilt of the mayor and agrees to follow Reno's lead, but they are barricaded in the jail with no one left in town but the hostile men. Night falls, and Yates takes Nona prisoner and sets up an ambush in the street. He baits Reno by loudly playing a song memorable to Reno and Nona on the player piano. Reno leaves the jail, telling Hodges to cover him. When the men notice Reno is in the street, they leave the saloon and Nona is able to escape. Reno and the rogue townsfolk start shooting at each other in the street.

He succeeds in killing several of the attackers and scattering the others and sneaks back inside. Conners kills one man who tried to kill Reno as he returns to the back door of the jail. The situation continues until sunup when one man loses his nerve and deserts Yates, riding into the desert where he is captured and tortured for the truth by Little Bear's tribe: Yates and his friends killed the chief's son because he fell in love with the mayor's daughter, who is half Native American. Yates does not want anyone to know that he was once married to a Native American woman.\nAt the town, Conners, having had enough, manages to surprise Reno and knock him unconscious.  He is unwilling to let Reno die for him and attempts to surrender in exchange for Reno's safety. Instead, Yates takes them both into the street where they are told what really happened and that the story will be that Conners killed Reno trying to escape. Chief Little Bear and his tribe arrive with their prisoner just in time. The prisoner tells Yates he confessed, only to immediately be shot dead by the mayor. The tribe's warriors and the renegades begin exchanging bullets.  In the confusion, Reno is able to break free. He and Conners fight along with the tribe, and kill Yates and all his men. Yates is able to be killed because his foot gets caught in a rope laying on the ground, which turns out to be the noose which he had intended for the Conners brothers.

Clayton suddenly returns and informs Holly that he has secured a promotion in Washington, D.C., where he wishes to take Holly and their son Clay to begin a regular family life. Holly agrees and goes to Phil's apartment to end their relationship. Phil reacts by trying to physically force Holly to stay, but tumbles down a staircase in the struggle and dies. Holly panics and leaves the scene. She is confronted by Estelle, who had hired a detective to follow her and knows about Phil's accident. Estelle blackmails Holly into disappearing to Europe under a false identity rather than facing murder charges and ruining her husband's political career with the scandal. Estelle arranges for Holly to be secreted away at night from the family yacht, never to see her husband or son again.\nHolly, devastated by the loss of her son, falls ill with pneumonia on the side of a European street and is rescued by a charming pianist named Christian who helps her receive medical treatment and recuperate under a nurse's care. Holly and Christian grow close as she accompanies him on tour, but when he proposes marriage, she declines and then runs away from Christian. Holly slowly sinks into depravity and alcoholism, including a one-night stand with a man who steals her money and jewelry.\nWith Estelle's blackmail payments cut off, Holly goes to Mexico where she lives in a sleazy apartment and cannot afford her rent. She befriends an American neighbor named Dan Sullivan, who plies her with alcohol that causes her to tell him about her past with Clayton. He persuades Holly to join him in New York to work for him, but while there, she realizes that he is actually trying to blackmail Clayton, who is now governor of the state and a leading candidate for his party's presidential nomination. Holly shoots and kills Sullivan when he threatens to expose her deception to her son. The police arrest her and, refusing to reveal her identity, she signs a confession with the letter \"X\" and refuses to speak. The court-appointed defense attorney happens to be her son, Clay Jr., though she does not recognize him.\nHolly refuses to reveal her name throughout the trial, saying nothing in her defense. Clay, in his first trial as a lawyer, devises a defense strategy to paint Sullivan as a career criminal who caused his own death. At the end of the trial the prosecutor is giving his summation to the jury and says that Clay is the son of the governor and states his full name. Holly spots Clayton Sr. in the gallery and suddenly realizes that her attorney is in fact her long-lost son. Holly takes the stand, admitting that she killed Sullivan to protect her son, who believes her to be dead, so he will not know the type of woman she has become.\nWhile the jury is deliberating, Clay, who has grown close to Holly despite not knowing that she is his mother, visits her in her holding cell and implores her to reach out to her son. She does not reveal her identity to him but tells him he has been like a son to her. Then, having spent her final moments with her son and overcome with emotion, she dies suddenly.

With the annulment, Henry would be able to marry Anne Boleyn, with whom he hopes to father such an heir and avoid a repeat of the Wars of the Roses. More says that he cannot agree to Wolsey's suggestion that they apply \"pressure\" on Church property and revenue in England. Unknown to More, the conversation is being overheard by Wolsey's aide, Thomas Cromwell.\nReturning to his home at Chelsea at dawn, More finds his young acquaintance Richard Rich waiting for his return so as to lobby for a position at Court. More instead offers Rich a job as a teacher. Rich declines More's offer, saying that teaching would offer him little chance to become well known. More finds his daughter Meg chatting with a brilliant young lawyer, William Roper, who announces his desire to marry her. The devoutly Catholic More says he cannot give his blessing as long as Roper remains a Lutheran.\nSome time later, Wolsey dies in a rural monastery in disgrace after banishment from court for failing to obtain the papal annulment Henry wanted. Henry appoints More Lord Chancellor of England. The King makes an \"impromptu\" visit to the More estate and again requests More's support for an annulment, but More remains unmoved as Henry alternates between threats, tantrums, and promises of unbounded royal favour. As the King leaves, Cromwell promises Rich a position at Court in return for damaging information about More.\nRoper, learning of More's quarrel with the king, says that his religious views have altered considerably and declares that by attacking the Church, the king has become \"the Devil's minister.\" More is admonishing Roper to be more guarded when Rich arrives, pleading again for a position at Court.

After More does not, he is summoned again to the royal palace of Hampton Court, where Cromwell interrogates More inside Wolsey's former office. More refuses to answer and an infuriated Cromwell reveals that the king views More as a traitor, but allows him to leave. The Thames boatmen are aware of the King's hostility to More and refuse to ferry him, so More returns home on foot.\nAs More finally arrives, his daughter Meg informs him that a new oath is being circulated and that all must take it or face charges of high treason. Initially, More says he might be willing to take the oath, depending on its wording. Upon learning that it names the king as Supreme Head of the Church and allows no legal or moral loopholes, More refuses to take it and is imprisoned in the Tower of London.\nMore remains steadfast in his refusal to take the Oath and refuses to explain, knowing that he cannot be convicted if he has not explicitly denied the king's supremacy.

More refuses to express an opinion about the king's second marriage or why he will not take the Oath. As an experienced lawyer and judge, he cites his silence as part of his defence, based upon the legal principle that silence is to be interpreted as consent. Cromwell calls Rich to testify. Rich alleges that, when he went to confiscate More's books, More told him that while Parliament has the power to dethrone the king, it does not have the authority to make the king the Head of the Church.\nA horrified More offers to take any oath required by the court that he never said any such thing to Rich. More adds that he would never be so suicidal as to entrust so dangerous an opinion \"to such a man as that.\" As Rich leaves the witness box, it emerges that Rich has been made Attorney General for Wales as a reward from Cromwell for committing perjury, much to More's chagrin.\nUnder a direct order from Cromwell, the jury convicts More without leaving the courtroom to deliberate. But as the judges begin to pronounce the death penalty, More interrupts and reminds them that prisoners are to be asked before sentencing if they have anything to say.\nUpon being so asked by the judges, More declares, \"I do.\" More calls Parliament's Act of Supremacy repugnant to every legal precedent and institution in all the history of Christendom. He cites the Biblical foundation for the Petrine Primacy and the authority of the Papacy, rather than national governments, over the Church.

In it he's the music student, she's \"Grace\", and they impulsively marry.  \nBack in the park Janet rejects his attentions and creates a scene.  A policeman arrives, Buddwing is questioned, but flees when the patrolman becomes distracted by hecklers.\nHe's pursued by a mad street person, who raves that indeed the frightened man is the murderer on the loose. \nMore spooked than ever Buddwing races away, ending up aimlessly roaming the sidewalks. Soon he meets coquettish actress \"Fiddle\" (Suzanne Pleshette). They have sex, after which he instinctively begins to play piano, jarring loose more fragments of his possible former identity.  Falling asleep in her arms he roils in a nightmare of fighting with her - by the name of Grace, and again his wife - over a pregnancy he feels they cannot afford.  He insists on an abortion.  Crushed, \"Grace\" climbs over the guardrail of the 59th Street Bridge, ready to commit suicide.  He arrives to save her just in time.\nSnapping out of it, he flees once again, ending up buying a pint of whisky and looking for somewhere to paper-bag it alone. A socialite (Jean Simmons, \"The Blonde\") out for kicks on a scavenger hunt spies the tall, handsome man on the sidewalk. After boozing some together on the nearest stoop the pair end up in Harlem, seeking to clear $100,000 in a craps game to complete her list. Becoming woozy, Buddwing once again lapses into a conscious flashback, this time with The Blonde as his troubled wife Grace.  In spite of having achieved success the couple has lost everything: she is a miserable tramp, unable to get over an abortion that left her sterile, he's trapped in his own web of affluence at the expense of honoring his inborn talent.\nIn his trance he sees a blood-spattered vanity top and a razor blade.\nLike a lightning bolt it dawns on him he'd dialed the right phone number in the wrong area code that morning.  It wasn't for \"Monument\" on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, it was for Mt. Kisco up in Westchester County.  He calls, it's a hospital, and it all starts to come together for him: he had married Grace, she had had an abortion, they never could have a family, he had indeed sacrificed his talent for success as an A&R man just like he had told her intended to, and revolted her.  And she had slashed her wrists...but was still alive.  Just barely.\nHe begs to be able to see her.  He takes her lifeless arm.  He fears her last breaths are ebbing away.  Slowly the limb moves, beckoning his hands.  He takes her hand and clasps it in his, sharing his rediscovered life force with her.", "tmdb_id": 207681}, "21875242": {"title": "Misunderstood (1966 film)", "plot": "Duncombe is the UK Consul General in Florence, Italy.

The shipment has also attracted Gabriel, the head of a criminal organization that includes his accountant McWhirter and bodyguard Mrs. Fothergill. Modesty believes that Gabriel, who maintains a compound in the Mediterranean, is dead, but he reveals himself to her.\nIn exchange for an exclusive discount on the kingdom's oil exports, the British government delivers periodic diamond shipments to the Sheikh. Blaise, who enjoys an ongoing love-hate relationship with law enforcement, is recruited not only for her competence, but because she is the Sheikh's adopted daughter and thus trusted by him implicitly. Modesty agrees to the arrangement, on the condition that she is given total immunity by the British government and complete freedom to deliver the diamonds how she sees fit.\nWith Sir Gerald monitoring her from afar, Modesty travels to Amsterdam, where she reunites with her former lover Paul Hagen, a Secret Service agent and aide to Sir Gerald. She calls upon her longtime partner, Willie Garvin, who is reuniting with an old flame, Nicole, who may have information on Gabriel through her employer, an illusionist associated with him. Modesty narrowly survives several attempts on her life by Gabriel's assassins, whose failure leads to their swift execution by the ruthless Mrs. Fothergill. Modesty continually toys with Hagen, first seducing him before stealing his gun and disappearing.\nWhen Gabriel learns that Nicole is working with Modesty and Willie, he orders her assassinated. The illusionist sends thugs to have her killed, and they succeed when Modesty and Willie fail to intervene in time. Modesty and Willie set themselves up as live bait to draw Gabriel out, but find themselves pursued by Tarrant and a jilted Hagen, being briefly arrested before quickly escaping with the help of some smoke bombs. When Modesty attempts to identify and infiltrate the boat being used by Gabriel for the planned diamond theft, she is lured into a trap and captured. Gabriel reveals his true plan, to use Modesty as leverage to force Willie to steal the diamonds for him.\nWillie reluctantly agrees to the arrangement, successfully stealing the diamonds from under Tarrant and Hagen's noses. He and Modesty are subsequently taken to Gabriel's island fortress, where they are promptly thrown into prison cells. Gabriel offers Modesty to join forces, but she refuses. Willie and Modesty manage to escape and kill Mrs. Fothergill, and signal their location to the Sheikh's forces. The Sheikh leads his army to the island, leading to an all-out battle with Gabriel's forces and ending in his capture and the diamonds reaching their intended owner.\nIn his desert camp, the Sheikh leaves Gabriel tied up outside to dehydrate. McWhirter suddenly appears in Highland dress to free his employer, though no one seems to notice or care. When the Sheikh asks Modesty what he can do for her, she asks for the diamonds.

Inside, he finds an obi - a glass bottle filled with graveyard dirt and feathers - on his kitchen table. He steps back in fright. The obi suddenly falls to the floor. As it smashes, he's thrown through the window, falling to his death. It is but a taste of things to come.\nA few miles away, Fr. Goodman (Olaf Pooley) has reported the desecration of the cemetery at his church. The previous night, he saw someone scooping up dirt from a freshly-dug grave, but the person fled before Goodman could identify him. Goodman tells Inspector Hollis (Coleman) that after 15 years in Jamaica, where he studied Obeah, he knows that the person was making an obi. Hollis wonders why Goodman's church was chosen as, in his words, 'it's miles away from the coloured quarter of town'. Goodman points out, though, that it's close to the Southdene Hostel for Commonwealth Students, home to several Jamaicans. He takes Hollis to the hostel to meet its head, Jim Benson (Dingnam), who had been in Jamaica at the same time as Goodman. Benson denies any connection between the desecration and the students, whom he calls 'the pick of the Commonwealth - highly intelligent and most of them scientists'.\nBenson, his secretary Janet Tuttle (Suzanne Neve), deputy head Dick Alderson (Ainley), Goodman and Hollis take lunch with the students. Benson doesn't eat, however, complaining of stomach problems. He collapses and is helped to his room. Alderson tells Hollis that Benson has been ill for weeks. Simultaneously, Amizan    (Brylo Forde), the hostel's elderly Jamaican caretaker, shuffles by.\nHollis asks Anderson to have a word with a Jamaican student, Danny (Hamilton), who was detained by the police after a violent street fight. Danny wasn't involved, just in the wrong place at the wrong time, returning to the hostel after visiting his girlfriend Beverley (Carmen Munroe). Hollis knows that the fight was between the drug-dealing gangs of Lloyd (Dan Jackson) and Spady (Bari Jonson), rival nightclub owners.\nLater that night, Amizan is emptying the waste bins in the Jamaican students' rooms. When he gets to Danny's, Danny tells him to stop hurting Benson and threatens to tell Benson everything. Amizan says, menacingly, that it wouldn't be too healthy for Danny if he did. Danny kicks him out.\nBenson shows Alderson an obi that he found in his room just before his stomach problems began. When Alderson asks, Benson says that he hasn't told the police about it because he fears causing a scandal at the hostel. Alderson tells Amizan to dispose of the obi, but Amizan refuses. Alderson carries the obi down to Amizan's 'hut' - he lives next to the furnace in the cellar - and orders Amizan to burn it. Amizan, in the back room of his hut, where he hides his voodoo paraphernalia, again refuses. Alderson throws it into the furnace.\nAfter an end-of-term dance party at the hostel, Alderson walks Tuttle home. They're romantically involved. Along the way, they find a decapitated, bloody cockerel hanging from a tree. Alderson tells Benson about it, oddly finding gravel on the floor outside Benson's door. He finds another obi in Benson's liquor cabinet. Benson is truly afraid of the second obi.\nThe next day, Benson and Alderson find several more dead cockerels. Goodman performs an exorcism of sorts as they burn them. Amizan goes to Danny's room, hands Danny an obi and says, 'I think it's time you paid another visit to our friend'. Goodman blesses Benson's second obi and says that now it can be disposed of. Benson won't do so, though. Instead, he shows it to the students and lectures them on the evils of witchcraft.\nDanny delivers the obi to Lloyd, who says that Spady wants Danny dead as Spady believes that the obis have caused the deaths of three members of his gang. A frightened Danny almost forgets to collect his money from Lloyd before he hurriedly leaves.\nAt the hostel, Alderson takes Danny to Benson. Danny sees the gravel in front of Benson's door and is afraid to enter because, he says, the gravel is keeping something evil inside. Benson accuses Danny of placing the obis in his room. When Danny denies it, Benson smashes the obi. Danny screams in terror and runs out.\nThe following morning Tuttle finds Benson dead, stabbed with a decorative spear. When Hollis arrives, he's angry that Alderson hadn't told him earlier about the obis, but Alderson appears to be in shock. Dupree (Oscar James), another Jamaican student, tells Hollis that Danny has locked himself in his room. Hollis breaks down the door and finds Danny hysterical and holding the bloody spear. Danny denies killing Benson and says that Amizan shoved the spear under his door.\nDanny and the others rush to Amizan's hut. He too is dead.

She bears it until the life finally drives her mad, for the new Mother Superior, Sister Sainte-Christine, mistreats her because of her rebellion as a result of her dislike of the nun's life. She isolates her constantly and deprives her of food, forcing her to adopt a diet of bread and water.\nSuzanne then sends her friend away with a letter to a lawyer. She wants to be free and absolved of her vows under the argument that everyone around her forced her to take the vows against her will: her mother, her father, the Mother Superior, etc. The lawyer, who becomes her biggest advocate against the religious orthodoxy enslaving her, informs her that while the case is pending, she will have to stay with Sister Sainte-Christine and endure the resulting persecution, but that either she will win or be transferred. Suzanne does not care, not truly understanding the depths of Sister Sainte-Christine' cruelty. While the case pends, Suzanne suffers many mistreatments under Sister Sainte-Christine, who steals her crucifix, forbids her to eat, forbids her to pray, forbids the other sisters to interact with or speak to her, and isolates her.  She allows them to walk on the weakened, starving Suzanne after Mass. She is also whipped. They become convinced she is possessed, and Sister Sainte-Christine requests an exorcist. Officials arrive, see her mistreatment and understand that her devotion to God is not the way a possessed person would act, and investigate the mistreatment, which involves Sister Sainte-Christine's being reprimanded. After that, Sister Sainte-Christine lessens the punishment to only isolation but still treats her coldly.\nWhen Suzanne discovers that the church has decided not to absolve her vows, she once again falls into a severe depression. Her lawyer apologizes and promises to keep in touch, although a church official forbids the contact. The same man later tells her that the church transferred her to another convent under the supervision of Mme de Chelles. In addition to long conversations about her thoughts and experiences, the light-hearted, fun, happy Mme de Chelles displays an attraction to and makes sexual advances towards Suzanne, which Suzanne never fully grasps. She meets a monk who attempts to comfort her by saying that he was forced into religion against his will as well. They develop a relationship and he later tells her that they must escape together. Suzanne goes with him, but flees from him when he forces kisses on her as soon as they are together which implies he desires more with her. Suzanne finds refuge nearby, working as a seamstress and doing chores for women. While there, she learns that the monk was caught and faces life in prison, same as she does. She cannot bear the thought of returning. She flees the small village she has taken refuge in and winds up begging on the street. A smart looking woman takes her to her home, but Suzanne does not understand it is a brothel and joins the girls who are dressing to entertain clients at a masked dinner party.

De Sala orders her associate Olga and another model Do Do to make sure that Lorelei does not speak to Solo.\nDe Sala herself visits Sir Norman Swickert, a very old statesman she knew and admired as a child, and brings along with her Dr. Gritsky \u2013 a colleague of Dr. Lancer.  Swickert complains of being too old to have political power anymore, and De Sala reveals her desire for such power as he once had, her resentment of not having it available to her since she is a woman, and her ability to make him a younger man with Gritsky's help.\nMeanwhile, Solo's efforts to contact Lorelei result in Do Do and Olga acting together to kill her rather than have her speak to Solo.  Solo discovers this when he is lured to Lorelei's apartment and, after a fight with Do Do, discovers both Lorelei's body and a note to Lorelei that she could contact her father through Philip Bainbridge.  Solo attempts to contact Bainbridge in London (meeting Swickert's full-time nurse Joanna Sweet in the process), but Swickert is speaking with him first.  Swickert becomes convinced that the middle-aged Bainbridge is actually the elderly Lancer made young again via a medical process.  Olga has followed Solo and, in attempting to kill him, accidentally kills Bainbridge/Lancer.  A chase and fight ensues with the result being the escape of Olga and the death of Do Do.\nHaving seen Swickert with Lancer, Solo visits Swickert at his country estate and questions him about Bainbridge and Lancer.  Swickert refuses to say much beyond that Lancer was a member of the Bridge of Lions club, a private chess club that Swickert founded to build a bridge among the great men of many nations to allow them freedom to communicate under all circumstances \u2013 thereby reducing the chances of cataclysms like World War I.\nShortly after leaving Swickert's home, Solo's car crashes as a result of sabotage \u2013 implied to be the work of Olga.

Kuryakin finds that hat associated with the pin and it turns out to be from Madame Raine De Sala's salon.  From this point on they collaborate on their assignments.\nSolo and Kuryakin next break into Swickert's home and are captured by Swickert's guard and Olga.

They're now left with Hilary's bull, a result of years of European breeding, named Vindicator. Vindicator exhibits all the gentility of breeding, including an odd willingness to follow Hilary merely at the whistle of \"God Save the Queen\".\nAt auction, Vindicator results in a bidding war and is ultimately won by Charles Ellsworth (David Brian), who has come to purchase stock for his partner the wealthy Texas rancher Alexander Bowen (Brian Keith). Sam \u2018Bulldog\u2019 Burnett (James Stewart), a local wrangler renowned for being able to take down bulls, is hired to transport the bull to Bowen's ranch. Ellsworth has bought the bull primarily to woo Martha, and when she is confronted by him when trying to claim her payment for the bull she decides to ensure Vindicator's delivery by accompanying him en route.\nDaughter Hilary tells Martha Evans about a conversation she overheard between Burnett and two men working for competing rancher John Taylor (Alan Caillou). Burnett has made a deal with Taylor to steal the bull. Hilary doesn't yet know that Burnett has made the deal mostly to ensure another wrangler (Ben Johnson) double crossed by Taylor would receive some money to take care of himself after an injury. One of Taylor's men, Deke Simons (Jack Elam), gets into a fight with Burnett in the saloon over terms. Evans, witnessing the brawl, comes to trust Burnett. Despite Burnett's objections, he ultimately accepts responsibility for the Evans women through the train ride to Dodge City and the following wagon trail.\nOne night while Evans and Burnett have finished brewing coffee over the campfire, a gunshot knocks the coffee pot out of Burnett's hand. Burnett believes this is a signal from Taylor's men. Just before dawn, Hilary catches Burnett saddling up and suspects he is about to hand over the bull. He denies her accusations, waking her mother to prove he was innocent. Once again, Evans gives Burnett the benefit of the doubt.\nTaylor's men find a barbed wire fence that has been cut through to make way for Evans' wagon. They conclude that Burnett must have double-crossed them. Simons, determined to catch up with Burnett, shoots his companion and rides on after the wagon.\nIn a canyon, Burnett runs into Jamie Bowen (Don Galloway), Alexander's son, who has appropriated a herd of his father's longhorn cattle as payment for his work and is running away to start his own ranch. Simons catches up and shoots a cowhand, setting off a stampede. Jamie tries to escape, but falls in the path of the charging cattle and is trampled.\nBattered and unconscious, Jamie is carried by Burnett back to the wagon. Simons is there holding Evans and her daughter hostage, demanding the money that Burnett was paid by Taylor for the bull. Simons also demands Evans' money, but while distracted, Burnett is able to take his rifle. Simons mounts and gallops away. Burnett follows. After the horses collide, Simons falls onto a rock and is killed.\nBurnett returns with the money, but Martha berates him for his dishonesty and the trouble he has caused. After a few days of traveling with Bowen's son in tow, they reach their destination, his father's ranch.\nAt the ranch they're introduced to Jamie's father, Bowen, a Scotsman turned cattle rancher at a fort also populated by local families of Mexican heritage. While Hilary nurses Jamie back to health, Martha begins teaching the local children in school. Though Bowen and Burnett insist the Evans women should leave for the East again before they're snowed in, they refuse until Jamie is well and they've taught the men to properly care for Vindicator.\nBowen continues to insist that Hereford cattle can't make it through the tough conditions on the range and thus make them a bad match. Martha and Hilary insist, and slowly, Burnett is coming over to their side. Martha, upon witnessing the wildness of the longhorn cattle, realizes that until Vindicator proves himself, they'll never have the men on their side. Hilary races back to the fort, and releases Vindicator into the wild.\nWith Vindicator now in the wild to fend for himself and Jamie on the mend, the Evans women announce it is time for them to go, but Jamie insists he's in love with Hilary, who returns the proclamation and Martha, upon seeing them, realizes she needs to stay as well. This suits both Bowen, who's realized he's in love with Martha, and Burnett, who's known he loved Martha since they met.\nIt is a particularly brutal winter and Burnett insists on finding Vindicator and bringing him back to shelter. Through repeated outings, he can't find the bull and while he's away, Bowen cleans himself up, begins serving tea and showing Martha his gentlemanly side in an attempt to woo her.\nBurnett is reported missing and the men finally find him, almost frozen. Bowen insists that he can have any calves that may have resulted from Vindicator, but surely the bull is now dead. Burnett refuses to give up hope, even though Hilary and Martha have come to accept this as truth.\nWhen the spring finally arrives, Burnett begins searching for Vindicator again, hoping for calves and begins building a new kind of farm, where the animals are treated better and Herefords can not only subsist, but thrive. He finally discovers Vindicator, long dead under a snowdrift. He still insists that calves may be coming.\nMartha, out of reluctance for anything else, agrees to marry Bowen, but only after there is no chance of calves from Vindicator. In one of the last scenes, Burnett finally finds a cross-Hereford calf, and brings him back to the fort. Bowen and Burnett fight over Martha, and Burnett declares his love for Martha, and Bowen steps aside.\nAt the end, we're shown an entire field of Herefords, with Martha and Burnett musing that they're glad they kept a \"few Longhorn, to remember the way it used to be\".

He takes \"Johnsy Boy\" Hood on his way back from romancing the lonely wife of a local farmer (Gloria Grahame) in hopes of cheating her out of some money. Under the threat of being \"branded and gelded\" by Jonas, Hood's sanity cracks. He grabs the hot iron and rams it repeatedly into his stomach as he runs screaming into the woods. He later commits suicide.\nJonas also encounters the saloon bouncer (Buddy Baer), a giant of a man whom Jonas had met the night before. The bouncer doesn't like it that the town is laughing at him for letting Jonas leave the bar with a bottle of liquor that Jonas promised to pay for later, and now wants the money. The resulting fight presages the subject of the painting seen in the framing sequence, and the bouncer is nearly beaten to death. Only the arrival of Jonas' father stops the fight.\nHanley is revealed as one of the rustlers involved with Coates. Coates kills Hanley when the old man denies having Jonas' money. Coates reasons that Durham must have it and tries a little blackmail. Durham threatens to kill Coates, telling him that he used to wear his gun tied to his leg, and he has used it on better men than Coates. But the alcoholic Coates is beyond reasoning. Jonas runs into Durham on the street, the last man on his list, and Durham announces to the town that he branded Jonas like an animal and took his money. He offers to give Jonas his money back but Jonas tells him to go to hell and knocks him down.\nCoates, who is on a drunken rampage, attacks Jonas. Coates is eventually beaten to a pulp by Jonas, then killed when he goes for his gun. Jonas wants to be done with violence and leaves his gun on the bar. The flashback ends with Jonas mounted up and on his way out of town. Jessie has Jonas' money and pleads with him to stay, but he refuses and the scene ends with her standing in the street as she watches him ride off. His father tells Jessie to go after Jonas.\nThe film ends with the bartender showing off the pistol Jonas left behind. The census taker asks what happened to Jessie. The bartender said she left town and neither she nor Jonas was ever heard from again. The census taker doesn't believe Jessie went after Jonas, but the bartender does, saying that \"You Can Never Go Home Again\" is just a song and \"home\" is just a word.

Rather than radio for help and risk an embarrassing international incident, the captain sends a nine-man landing party, headed by his zampolit (Political officer) Lieutenant Yuri Rozanov, to find a motor launch to help free the submarine from the bar.

He informs the captain, Lieutenant Collins, that they must stop for repairs, but Collins refuses until executive officer Bordelles declares a mechanical emergency.

Then, hysteria breaks out because of the pastor's leadership, and the congregation sets out to find and kill the witch. However, one of the villagers warns the others against killing the witch, as he explains the Count must exorcise the witch first, lest she will not die and will linger on as a curse for generations to come.\nNevertheless, the congregation sets out and finds the witch. Upon finding her, the pastor directs the crowd to take her to the lake, where she will be impaled and dunked. As Bardella is tied into the chair, she curses the people and their descendants for what they are doing and threatens she will return. The Count and his attendant secretly watch the execution from a distance upon a hilltop and seemingly purposely do not intervene. Then the story returns to the reflective Von Helsing in his cave.\nNext, a young, newly married couple is traveling in a midnight-blue Volkswagen Beetle through the Carpathian Mountains in Transylvania for their honeymoon. The husband, Philip, realizes he is lost and stops to look at a map with his wife, Veronica. A lawman passes by, and Philip asks for directions and recommendations for overnight lodging.\nWhen they arrive in Vaubrac, they find the town run down and unimpressive. Before they are to drive on, the hotel owner, Ladislav Groper, happens upon them and offers them a room, bread, and tea- attempting to accommodate their English traditions. While waiting for their food and tea, they notice Von Helsing strangely swinging on a nearby swing set. After they toss aside the garlic that came with their food and tea, Von Helsing immediately explains why the garlic was in their tea- as protection against Satanism and witchcraft.  He then goes on a verbal diatribe explaining he is an aristocrat (albeit dispossessed of his castle by the current governmental regime) and relates the history of the Von Helsing family and the Draculas. In the process, he cons them into buying him a bottle to drink, and, wearing on, Von Helsing recounts the story and curse of Bardella. However, the couple is skeptical.\nQuickly tiring of the Count's recitation, the couple retires to their room for the evening. During their conversation, Groper rudely intrudes upon the couple's room without knocking, claiming there is no privacy in the People's Republic. Offended, Philip requests a different room but is denied. Nevertheless, once Groper leaves, the couple becomes romantic together. However, they are interrupted again by Groper watching their lovemaking through the window. Philip scrambles to beat up Groper. Returning to his wife, he wants to leave Vaubrac; but Veronica decides she wants to stay and reassures him that Groper will not bother them again.\nThey attempt to leave early the next morning, but Philip finds Groper stole the distributor cap from their car, which he promptly retrieves. Driving down the road, Philip loses steering control of the Volkswagen and narrowly misses hitting a delivery truck head-on, causing him to crash into a lake. Veronica's body is then possessed by the spirit of the 18th-century witch killed by the local villagers and is now bent on avenging herself upon them. Both persons are still unconscious. The truck driver, who has a bad local reputation with the police, retrieves Philip and what he thought was his wife but was Bardella instead. He brings them back to Vaubrac, leaving them with Groper, so the police would not accuse him of any wrongdoing.\nMeanwhile, Philip comes to and inquires Groper about his wife. When Philip realizes that Veronica is missing and something/someone else is in her place, he becomes enraged again at Groper, who denies knowing anything about who the other body is. Suddenly Von Helsing arrives and notices that the woman mistaken as Veronica is indeed Bardella, having returned. Then he reassures Philip that he can help him get his wife back.\nVon Helsing asks Philip a series of questions regarding the accident and then takes him back to his cave. He begins reading from a record book entitled \"The Death of Bardella the Witch.\" Philip then grows frustrated and impatient with what he regards as unrelated to his missing wife and finally leaves on foot in order to report the incident to the police. Von Helsing then pursues him in his yellow roadster, an early model Citro\u00ebn.\nHowever, Von Helsing does not find Philip but arrives back in town, where he visits Bardella to bring her back to life. Meanwhile, Groper is heavily drinking, watching porn, and gorging his face with food. The witch comes back to life, momentarily attacking and strangling Von Helsing, then leaves. Groper's niece shows up horrified, seeking protection from the scary noises she had heard due to Bardella's screeching. However, Groper invites her in and attempts to rape her, but breaking free of him, she escapes.\nGroper goes after her, but once outside, Philip confronts him, whom he clobbers with his bottle of alcohol, leaving him unconscious on the road. The truck driver happens by again but swerves to miss him. Later, Von Helsing comes upon him and drags him out of the road. Meanwhile, Groper is heavily drinking again when suddenly Bardella attacks and kills him with a hammer and sickle.\nVon Helsing and Philip take off to find Bardella. Again, Philip wants to go to the police, but Von Helsing explains Bardella has returned. If she were to be gunned down by police, he would not be able to perform the exorcism necessary on the witch to bring Veronica back. Slowly, Philip begins believing in Von Helsing and what he says.\nBack in town, there is an illegal cockfight going on. Bardella has gone on a killing spree against the descendants of the people who killed her 200 years before. On foot through town, Von Helsing and Philip begin searching for Bardella. Bardella shows up at the cockfight to get revenge on the villagers there. Von Helsing comes upon the scene and uses a syringe to drug the witch. They load her in his roadster and take her back to the hotel's kitchen to put her on ice for safekeeping. Then they go to Von Helsing's cave to pick up some ritual tools to exorcise Bardella.\nAfter being jailed, the truck driver makes a deal to tell police where Bardella is in exchange for his freedom. He leads the police back to the hotel, where they find the drugged witch. The comrade police lieutenant intends to have Bardella autopsied and buried, which would ruin any chances of bringing Veronica back. Reneging, the police lieutenant takes the truck driver back into custody. Returning to the hotel from Von Helsing's cave, Philip and the Count find Bardella missing. So they head to the police station and steal back Bardella's body from under them.\nA car chase ensues, with Von Helsing and Philip in the police van and the police driving Von Helsing's roadster. The roadster momentarily stalls, enabling Von Helsing and Philip to evade them. However, Von Helsing realizes the ritual tools he needs to bring Veronica back are in his car, so they pull over, and the police catch up with them. While lying in the police van, Bardella awakens from her drugged state. She then attacks the approaching police officers. Von Helsing uses his syringe to drug Bardella again and the police officers.\nThey carry Bardella to the roadster and transport her to the lake, where they find the dunking chair. They strap her into the chair, perform a ritual and drop her into the water, where she disappears. Philip panics. But suddenly, Veronica floats to the surface, and her husband retrieves her.\nFinally, the three drive off in Von Helsing's Citro\u00ebn, out of Transylvania to Czechoslovakia. Due to Von Helsing's havoc in Vaubrac, he decides to leave the country for England with his two new friends. Light-heartedly, Philip jokes about the inhospitality of Vaubrac and is relieved by leaving.

The killing was possibly committed in revenge for the accidental trampling death of \"a little person\" in town, which may have been caused by Gashade's brother, Coigne. Coigne had inexplicably rushed away from their camp moments before the shooting death. Coley becomes increasingly paranoid and Gashade takes his friend's gun away from him.\nThe following day, a young woman shoots her horse to death immediately outside of the camp. The sound of the gunshot temporarily sends the frightened Coley into hiding. Gashade examines the dead horse and notes that it appeared to be perfectly healthy, though the woman had said its leg was broken. The woman offers Gashade a thousand dollars to lead her to a place called Kingsley. Although openly distrustful of her, he grudgingly accepts the offer. Coley, apparently smitten by the woman, accompanies them.\nThe young woman is rude and insulting to both Gashade and Coley. She refuses to tell them her name. The three stop briefly in Crosstree. Gashade learns that Coigne was seen there only a day or two before. As they continue traveling slowly through the hot desert, Gashade observes that they are being followed by a stranger dressed in black. He is Billy Spear, who continues to keep his distance from them. Gashade sees that the woman appears to be signaling to the man. Coley makes attempts to talk to the woman, but she continually taunts and insults him. She also repeatedly refuses to answer any of Gashade's questions regarding the purpose of their journey.\nAt night, having mistaken random gunshots by Coley as a signal from the woman, Spear suddenly walks into their camp and joins them. Hired by the woman as a gunslinger for reasons unknown, Spear is suspicious and hostile toward Gashade and contemptuous of Coley. He repeatedly threatens both of their lives. Gashade advises Coley to keep away from Spear.\nThe woman rides her horse hard. When it dies of exhaustion, Coley gives his horse to the woman and Gashade allows Coley to ride with him. Later, the woman loses the trail and asks Gashade to lead on. Gashade's horse shows signs of fatigue, so Gashade tells Coley to join the woman on her horse, but Spear forbids him from doing so. The woman says that the journey would be much easier without Coley. Spear and she demand that he be left behind. Gashade, under threat by Spear, reluctantly agrees and tells Coley he will come back for him soon.\nThe three see a bearded man sitting in the middle of the desert nursing a broken leg. The man tells the woman that the person she is seeking is only one day's ride away. She leaves him a canteen of water. Meanwhile, the bearded man's lost horse is found by Coley. He mounts the horse and rides back to the group. He charges at Spear, who shoots him dead. Gashade buries his friend in the sand.\nAll of the horses die. The group runs out of water, but they still keep moving. Gashade sees Spear growing weaker, and when the moment is right, attacks him. They fight, and after knocking Spear unconscious, Gashade grabs a large rock and crushes the killer's gun hand. Gashade walks after the woman, who is now closely following a man up the side of a rock formation. The man turns around and Gashade sees that the man is his look-alike brother, Coigne. Gashade attempts to tackle the woman as she pulls out a gun and takes aim at Coigne, but it is too late; Coigne and the woman shoot each other dead.

Brydie is injured with a wound to her head causing some intellectual disability.\nSeven years later, Brydie (Hayley Mills) can remember the boy but cannot remember the accident. She regularly visits Julian's grave but is not sure why she does. She has an argument with the old gravedigger who aggressively tells her that her dog is not allowed in the graveyard. She is rescued by a young man (Ian McShane) whom the old man calls a \"gypo\" and a \"tinker\".\nHer mother (Annette Crosbie, in her first film role) is a sad and lonely person who drinks heavily and is a dysfunctional mother. Brydie is a tomboy with a fascination for death and dead animals, and spends her time climbing trees and being a nuisance to the adults in the small village where she lives. She spends much of her time with the local children and tells them that all dead things should be buried, including animals. They agree to go round the village collecting up all the dead animals they can find and plan to bury them all in the graveyard that night.\nIt becomes apparent that some of the adults, especially the dead boy's father who blames Brydie for his death and has never forgiven her for it, are convinced that Brydie is a bad influence on the other children, that something should be done to discipline her and agree that her mother is not a good role model and to be looked down upon. Their negative attitude and behaviour are compounded by their disapproval that her mother was not married to Brydie's late father. The Vicar wakes the next morning to find his graveyard full of little graves the children have made to bury the animals and tries to explain to Brydie that because they have no souls, they cannot be buried on consecrated ground but understanding her simplicity and good intentions asks Julian's father if he would give a small corner of his land to the children to have their own animal graveyard. However, the father is embittered and he confronts her, accusing her of murdering Julian seven years earlier. Horrified and scared that it might be true, she runs in a fit of hysteria and falls in the river where she is rescued by the gypsy boy, Roibin. When he carries her into the nearby gypsy camp, his grandmother says \"you can't keep away from women, can you?\".\nThe gypsy's do not want her there, knowing that it will only bring trouble and Roibin has a reputation for trouble but seeing the fevered state of Brydie, the Grandmother takes her in and, begrudgingly, nurses her well. During the weeks Brydie is away, her mum drinks more heavily, distraught over Brydie's disappearance. She has a heart attack and dies. The Police interview the gypsies but they deny knowledge of the girl. When police dogs are brought in they lead police to the river edge and the worst is feared.\nAs Brydie recovers, she and Roibin become close and he helps her to face and talk about what happened with Julian. He asks her to stay with him and the gypsies when they move on. She says that she couldn't leave her mother and needs to go home. He pledges his love for her and they kiss in a meadow.  The village children find them there and tell her that her mother died during her absence. Upset, she decides to go to see her mother's grave and realising that she has nothing to stay home for, promises to return to Roibin. He teaches her how to read sticks that will tell her which direction the gypsies will have gone if they leave before she gets back.

Sunita, believes Rocky seduced and then jilted her sister, which led her to commit suicide. She intends to travel to Dehradun and Mussoorie, find Rocky and avenge her sister's death.\nOn her way to Dehradun, she meets Anil - a charming but mischievous man who flirts with her. As she checks into The Park hotel to find Rocky, she finds Anil there too, and he continues to woo her. Unbeknownst to her, Anil is Rocky.

The two become good friends.\nSunita invites Anil and his 'uncle' to meet with her father so they can begin planning the wedding.

A few minutes later, he heard her fall.\nAnil suspects Ruby to be Rupa's murderer, as she had intercepted Rupa and Anil's call, and was always jealous of any other woman who came close to Anil. However, during a confrontation, Ruby is shot by an unknown assailant. The inspector takes Anil into custody, warning him that the shooter was aiming for Anil, not Ruby, because they believe Anil is getting close to discovering the real killer. He shows Anil an expensive coat button found in Rupa's hand which he believes she tore off of her killer's coat. Anil then suspects Ramesh, Rupa's rich fiance who had threatened to kill her. Ramesh denies the accusation, although he was present at the hotel on the night Rupa died, and is also seen secretly bribing someone dressed as Ruby's killer with a bottle of whisky. However, without any proof, he is let off.\nAs Anil returns to his hotel room, an unknown woman visits him, telling him to take her car and go to a restaurant at the bottom of the hill, where he will find the conspirators.

Solo's thought is that only a personal connection can obtain the information, and Vulcan has neither wife nor close friends.  Elaine is given the cover story of being a wealthy widow and is able to not only get Solo the details of the assassination plot, but drugs Ashumen so he is unable to take the tour of Vulcan\u2019s factory which Solo believes will result in Ashumen\u2019s death.  Vulcan\u2019s target, though, turns out to be two of Ashumen\u2019s ministers who do not agree with his plans for having Vulcan set up factories in his country.  With Ashumen as Premier and Vulcan running the primary industry there, Western Natumba would become a puppet nation of WASP.  After a run-in (and brief romantic tryst) with WASP agent Angela, Solo finds out the truth, is captured along with Elaine, and left to die in what is supposed to look like an industrial accident.   Solo and Elaine escape, rescue the ministers, and Ashumen and Vulcan die instead in the \u201caccident\u201d they themselves set up.

However the Americans do not know how to move in the picturesque town, because for them the customs of the natives are too weird and incomprehensible. So the two men and the girl (the gang members) go to a prison, following the advice of a friend. There they would find, the man who would assist them in their case, a certain Don Vincenzo, who is a famous thief in the city. However, since he is known by everyone in the prison, he is treated by the guards as a gentleman and with respect. The Americans, when they see this type of treatment, which would be impossible in their country, are quite stunned. Don Vincenzo warmly receives them and advises them to go to Naples and look for a certain Armandino Girasole, known as \"Dud\u00f9\". He says that Dud\u00f9 is a young thief by profession and he could help them. But the Americans, do not reveal to Don Vincenzo what they intend to steal. They meet Dud\u00f9 and he  agrees to work with them.\nDuring their various meetings to prepare the plan, the Americans witness the cheerfulness as well as the grotesque situation of the city of Naples, a symbol of Italy. Everyone whether rich or poor, thinks of nothing but amusement, taking care only to live life as best they can. In fact, the economic boom occurred in Italy during these years. Jack, the leader of the gang, views Dud\u00f9's behavior as unacceptable. In fact, although he is known throughout the city as a professional thief, friend of even the cops, he behaves in a manner completely flippant. According to Jack, Dud\u00f9 should show at least some seriousness and study the plan at his seaside villa. Instead, Dud\u00f9 tells Jack that can not study the plan because one of his own gang members has to go to the football game, and another must attend a wedding or christening and also celebrate at the evening's huge banquet. While other colleagues are having fun, Jack is frustrated because, he thinks, one does not agree to commit a robbery with adults who act like children. During the wedding banquet in which Dud\u00f9 is also invited, the Americans, to their surprise, also meet the prisoner Don Vincenzo who was released from the prison for the day only to join the party! Jack has had enough but he must also contend with his friend Joe, who was seated at the table to taste a delicious plate of mussels, a typical Italian dish almost unknown in America. Joe, gorged himself on the mussels. Unfortunately, he dies from indigestion.\nAfter the funeral Jack thinks of giving up the job, but eventually convinces himself to again give the plan a shot. Without him noticing, however, his girlfriend Maggie slowly begins to fall in love with Dud\u00f9. The day before the famous heist, Dud\u00f9 and the rest of his gang, including his right arm man Sciascillo, meet in his villa by the sea. Jack, on the verge of losing patience, orders the fool Sciascillo to guard the house and not let anyone disturb him during the discussion of the plan. Unfortunately Sciascillo falls asleep yet every five minutes or so he wakes up and enters the house, trying to sell fake watches and other junk like that. Jack, unable to contain the absurdity of Naples, comes out of the house with a gun in his hand and starts to chase Sciascillo while shooting.\nThe plan is complete but on the last day Dud\u00f9 and his gang go to the Cathedral of San Gennaro to pray to the saint so that he will not become angry by the theft. Dud\u00f9, since he knows the real reason for the heist, is very concerned because he does not want to betray his country, and especially his favorite saint. However, he also speaks with Don Vincenzo, who is again free, and tells him that he will give part of the Treasure of San Gennaro to charities. All are convinced finally to do the job that night, but it soon turns into a mess.\nIn fact, Dud\u00f9 has just forgotten that night in Italy would begin the celebration of the Song Festival of Naples. An event so famous all over the country and should not be taken so lightly in Naples: people will come out to the streets to comment on the various songs and celebrate in bars. Jack and Maggie, as Americans, do not understand the huge fuss that would be created in the streets of Naples. So Dud\u00f9 and Sciascillo think to providing the nearby houses and even the police stations with TVs to keep them off the streets. Once they've carried out the task, Dud\u00f9 can now work, until the end of the festival, as best he can. In the catacombs of the cathedral and in the channels of the sewers, he smashes all the protective walls with dynamite, but there is one last concrete wall to break through. Unfortunately, however, the hole made in the wall to put the TNT is too small, so Dud\u00f9 has an idea: an idea that would not come to anyone else except to an Italian. He grabs a rat and binds the TNT to it, making him run away in a hole which leads behind the wall, soon the explosion breaks down the wall. Now, finally, the three can access the treasure room of San Gennaro and after a few attempts to break through the strong crystal display case, they finally are successful and remove the treasure.\nThe next day Dud\u00f9 learns that Jack is dead, betrayed and killed by his partner Maggie, who, he learns, wants to fly back to America with the treasure. Dud\u00f9 must prevent or rather delay the departure of the aircraft. Who to contact if not Don Vincenzo? Dud\u00f9 calls his friend at the prison, and requests he phone a friend of his at the airport and to delay the departure of the flight to the United States. Don Vincenzo, with absolute calm, replied that delaying the flight of a plane is not something unimportant, but reassures him that he will do everything possible. His friend at the airport agrees help. Dud\u00f9 rushes to the airport and tries to find Maggie, who is disguised as a nun to avoid recognition. Without being discovered, Dud\u00f9, in the guise of a porter, starts to open Maggie's checked bags, trying to find the treasure. In fact, Maggie is wearing all the jewels on herself, fearing that her baggage could be seized. She assumes she has fooled everyone in Italy, but Sciascillo and Dud\u00f9 are smarter than her and thus take back the treasure from her, returning the Treasure of San Gennaro to Naples.  Though Dudu attempts to take the treasure for himself, he is picked up by a Cardinal in a car after Mamma Assunta tells the Cardinal that Dudu was 'recovering' the jewels, and Dudu is greeted as a public hero when he returns to Naples, with the jewels returned to Saint Gennaro.", "tmdb_id": 58404}, "9283532": {"title": "Triple Cross (1966 film)", "plot": "In late 1930s London, debonair safecracker Eddie Chapman pulls off a series of heists but is caught and convicted while vacationing on the channel island of Jersey, where he is imprisoned.

Loser's funeral is the showpiece of the film.\nIn between sprees of sex, drugs, rock and roll, booze, loud revving Harley chopper motorcycle engines, bongo drums and fights, the Angels ride out to Mecca, California in the desert to look for Loser's stolen motorcycle. One of the Angels finds a brake pedal, which he says is a piece of Loser's motorcycle, in a garage that is the hang-out of a Mexican group. The two groups brawl, with the Angels apparently winning. The police arrive and the Angels escape but Loser gets separated from the others and is left behind. He steals a police motorcycle but is not able to lose the policeman who is pursuing him or evade the roadblock that the police have in place.

He undertakes a funeral sermon; it is a eulogy consisting entirely of funeral oratory cliches. This pathetic eulogy angers Blues and he interrupts the preacher's gibberish shouting, \"Oh no, preach, not children of God, but Hell's Angels\". Whereupon, the Angels decide to have a party in the church, with alcohol, dancing and reckless destruction of the church fixtures. They remove Loser from his coffin, they sit him up as a guest of honor and place a joint in his mouth. They beat and tie up the preacher and put him into the casket.

Nadezhda disapproves of her adopted daughter's choices in men, and worries that her daughter, Tanya (Zhanna Bolotova), unaware of her own adoption, might discover the truth.\nConversations between the two emphasize their tense, understated and ambiguous relationship. When Tanya encourages her mother to quit her job as school principal and begin a new life with a husband, Nadezhda responds with a cold lecture on the importance of self-sacrifice and duty to the state, values she had when she had served in the military. At the school where she works, however, Nadezhda is confronted by children who can neither appreciate the sacrifices she made during the war, nor the sacrifices she makes for them now.\nNadezdha's brief, tantalizing memories of flight, in her Yakovlev Yak-9 fighter aircraft, tumbling through clouds, are interspersed with reality and the moments of dull monotony, such as her daily commute on the bus. A visit to a local museum, where Nadezhda sees a photograph of a fellow pilot Mitya (Leonid Dyachkov), who later also became her lover during World War II, brings back memories of his final flight.

He sees the cupboard and notices that there is a honey pot on one of the shelves. However, he is disappointed to find that it is empty. He hears a bee fly by and decides to climb a nearby honey tree, but as he reaches the beehive, a branch he is sitting on breaks, causing him to fall into a gorse bush below. Unwilling to give up his quest for honey, Pooh visits his best friend Christopher Robin and obtains a balloon from him, intending to use it to float up to the beehive. Before doing this, Pooh first rolls around in a mud puddle, hoping to trick the bees into believing he is a \"Little Black Rain Cloud\". When he reaches the beehive, Pooh pulls out some honey and eats it without noticing that it is covered in bees, who proceed to fly around in his mouth. He spits them out, kicking the queen bee into the mud puddle below. Shortly afterward, Pooh's disguise starts to drip, and the other bees start to attack him. The queen bee angrily flies up and stings Pooh on the bottom. The sudden hit causes Pooh to swing up and down; his bottom gets stuck in the beehive, amusing the queen bee. The other bees then shove Pooh out of the beehive, then his balloon string comes untied. After the balloon deflates and Pooh comes down, the bees chase both him and Christopher Robin away.\nStill hungry for honey, Pooh decides to visit his friend Rabbit's house. Rabbit reluctantly invites Pooh in for lunch. Pooh greedily helps himself to all the jars of honey available. He then tries to leave, but finds he has grown too chubby to fit through the small passage Rabbit uses as a front door and gets stuck, with his head and arms outside Rabbit's house, his tummy wedged in the passageway, and his bottom and legs hanging inside on Rabbit's wall.

Gopher suggests blasting Rabbit's house open, but Owl refuses. When Rabbit returns with Christopher Robin, they both try to pull Pooh out, but fail. Christopher Robin suggests that they can push Pooh back inside if he and the others can't get him out. Rabbit refuses, even going so far as to wedge a chair under Pooh's rear end to prevent him from coming back into Rabbit's house. Christopher Robin decides that Pooh must wait without food until he is thin enough to fit through Rabbit's front door, no matter how long it may take. In the meantime, Rabbit decides to disguise Pooh's rear end, so he will not have to stare at it for months. He squeezes a frame around the chubby part, but when he tries to paint a moose's face directly on Pooh's bottom, the paint brush tickles him. Pooh giggles and wriggles his backside in surprise, messing up Rabbit's painting. Rabbit tries converting it into a shelf instead, but then Kanga and Roo visit Pooh and give him some honeysuckle flowers. These cause Pooh to violently sneeze, completely obliterating the shelf and decorations, much to Rabbit's dismay. After several days, Rabbit resigns himself to simply using Pooh's expansive bottom as the back of an armchair. He is also forced to put up a \"Don't feed the bear!\" sign outside by Pooh's head, after Pooh tries to get honey from his friend Gopher late one night.\nSome time later, a depressed Rabbit leans against Pooh's bottom and feels him move a bit. Rabbit joyously summons Christopher Robin and his other friends to free Pooh. Rabbit pushes from inside, while everyone else pulls from outside, without success. Rabbit finally shoves Pooh with a running start, causing Pooh to be launched into the air. He lands headfirst into the hole of another honey tree, scaring the bees away.

Bernard works at the library as a low-level assistant. His father, who constantly monitors and admonishes him, decides Bernard is old enough to move out and into his own Manhattan apartment. His unhappy mother acquiesces to her husband's decision and arranges for Bernard to live in a rooming house run by nosy, prudish Miss Nora Thing. Miss Thing inherited the building on the condition that her late brother's aggressive pet rooster be allowed to occupy the fifth floor, which Bernard must pass to get to his room. Miss Thing reassures Bernard's mother that the rooster only attacks young, attractive women. Mrs. Chanticleer says her son is still uninterested in girls, but arranges with Miss Thing to report any \"female\" activity. Bernard's mother constantly mails locks of her hair to Bernard at his new residence.\nActually, Bernard is very interested in girls, but he is a naive, immature virgin. He is smitten from afar with the coldly beautiful actress Barbara Darling. Meanwhile, Amy Partlett, Bernard's grade-school classmate who now works in his father's office, confesses to Bernard that she has a crush on him. Bernard's worldly co-worker Raef Del Grado encourages him to date Amy because she's a \"sure thing\" (a girl that will sleep with him) and discourages him from trying to pursue Barbara. Bernard and Amy go on a date to a discotheque, but when Bernard sees Barbara performing as the featured go-go dancer, he is mesmerized by her and loses all interest in Amy. Amy tries to win him back by offering to spend the night with him and Bernard accepts, though he's thinking of Barbara the entire time. When they try to go to Bernard's room, the rooster attacks Amy, causing a commotion during which Miss Thing falls down the stairs and breaks her arm. Bernard's mother blames Amy, calling her a tramp and forbidding Bernard from seeing her again.\nBernard and his parents attend a play in which Barbara is acting. Bernard later writes her a gushing fan letter. She responds with an invitation to visit her in her dressing room after a future performance. Unaware that Barbara is a man-hating narcissist after being sexually assaulted as a young girl, Bernard rushes to the theater. He then bumbles his way through an evening at her apartment. Barbara, knowing she has control over Bernard, tries to seduce him, but he is unable to perform sexually. Bernard is upset, even though Barbara acts understanding.\nMiss Thing tells Bernard's father that Bernard was out all night and that Amy called looking for him every 15 minutes while he was gone. Miss Thing and Bernard's father accidentally get trapped in a timelocked vault full of rare erotica, which horrifies her and causes her to rush out in disarray when the vault opens, giving the impression that Bernard's father made a pass at her. While this is going on, Amy tells Bernard that his father has, in fact, made a pass at her.\nBarbara invites Bernard to move in with her, which is convenient for him, since he finds out when he goes to pack his things that Miss Thing has just evicted him. Barbara kicks him out when he gets to her apartment, only to call him back again, and, with nowhere else to go, Bernard returns to her. He still finds himself unable to perform with her, and by this point he's so confused that he even asks her to marry him, an offer that neither of the two seems to take very seriously. When Bernard returns to Barbara's apartment after walking his dog and discovers Raef there, in a bathrobe (Bernard's father has sent Raef to find Bernard), he gathers up his things and moves out.\nBernard returns to the library, where Amy and his parents have been discussing the situation and debating how to go about searching for Bernard. He tells his parents he's leaving right away to get away from them. Barbara and  Raef arrive with Bernard's dog and reveal they have become engaged. Miss Thing and her new boyfriend, police officer Francis Graf, who lives in her boarding house, also arrive to confront Bernard's father about what happened in the vault. After some shouting, Bernard grabs his father's most prized library item, a Gutenberg Bible, and runs away with it. A slapstick chase through a street parade and a department store follows, ending when Barbara knocks Bernard out with a mannequin's leg. Barbara is featured in the newspaper for stopping a rare book thief and saving the Gutenberg Bible for the City of New York. Elated with her newfound fame, she dumps Raef. Bernard is jailed for his attempted \"theft\", but Amy bails him out.
