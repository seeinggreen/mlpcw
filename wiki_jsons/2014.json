Elliot receives a mysterious phone call that offers him $1,000 to assertively kill a fly that has been harassing him.  After Elliot checks his bank account online and sees that he has been credited, he accepts the next challenge: to eat the dead fly.  The caller explains that he will be offered a series of thirteen challenges, each of which will result in greater rewards.  If he fails to complete any of them, interferes in the game, or reveals the game, he will forfeit all the money, including any he already won.\nThe next few challenges attract police attention: making a young girl cry, arson, and scamming a homeless person with an ostrich.  When the child identifies Elliot in the police station based on wanted posters, Detective Chilcoat takes over the case.  Shelby becomes concerned about Elliot's secretive and odd behavior, and he explains that he is planning a surprise.  For his sixth challenge, Elliot is forced to take a corpse of a man who committed suicide out for coffee.  Given a strict deadline, Elliot panics and brazenly steals a cup of coffee from a table of on-duty police officers. When confronted, Elliot notices that they are drinking alcohol and threatens to file a complaint which forces them to back off. Elliot is rewarded two challenge completions for this feat.\nAfter he flees the scene, the caller tells Elliot that he has left behind his library card as evidence; however, if he wins the game, his record will be purged.  At the same time, Chilcoat follows Vogler, a conspiracy theorist that has been investigating the game. Paranoid, Vogler flees Chilcoat but advises him to kill Elliot at his first opportunity. Chilcoat eventually tracks down Vogler at a bar and discuss that the game's sole purpose is turning players into monstrosities at the promise of millions of dollars. Vogler states his wife once played the game, resulting in her eating their dog. For his next challenge, Elliot receives no instructions and is taken to a rural motel.  There, a man identifies himself as a former childhood bully, and the caller tells Elliot to sever the man's arm.  Elliot initially refuses but does so once the man taunts him.  After driving the man to the hospital, Elliot beats the man's brother with a chair as revenge for him bullying Elliot and Michael, including urinating in Michael\u2019s face. As a result, he is credited with two more completed challenges.\nWhen the police arrive at the banquet hall where Elliot and Shelby are having their rehearsal dinner, Elliot is surprised to discover that they are interested in Michael, who says he revealed himself to a young woman partially due to his medication being cut off. To give Michael time to escape, he accepts his next challenge, to destroy the banquet hall while singing The Internationale.  Disappointed in his reluctance to break social norms, the caller then instructs Elliot to surrender to the police, from whom Elliot learns that another person has been playing the game while committing other acts such as pushing an elder down the stairs and burning down an entire shrine.  Elliot takes and accidentally wounds a hostage to escape and complete the game before the other competitor. As he escapes, he's forced to leave behind his cell phone.  Desperate, he takes an old woman hostage when she shows up, sure that she is involved in his next challenge.\nAfter feigning ignorance, the old woman reveals his next challenge: to set a stainless steel wire across the road.  Elliot is horrified when he realizes that a group of bikers have been instructed to speed down the road.  Although he disarms the trap in time, the other competitor arms a similar trap down the road, and the cyclists are decapitated.  Disgusted and mortified, Elliot quits the game, tossing the phone away before he's told the last challenge and, when he returns home, discovers that Michael is the other competitor.  Michael reveals that the final challenge is to kill a family member.  Although Elliot originally tries to talk Michael out of killing their father, Elliot becomes homicidal when their father reveals he won the game by killing their mother, which led to a miserable life despite his victory. To prevent his sons from experiencing the horror of losing everything closest to them from winning the game, Samson slices his neck and commits suicide.\nHowever, Michael refuses to stop playing the game and attempts to kill Elliot.  Elliot kills Michael in self-defense, though he is stabbed multiple times.  Elliot is credited for his final challenge, but he forfeits all the money when he interferes with the game by shooting Chilcoat, who had murdered the conspiracy theorist and has now arrived to clean up the crime scene, thus revealing his involvement with the game.

He led only 12 ships, which remained in his command, to a heroic victory against an invading Japanese fleet of 333 vessels.At the onset of the battle at their base in Haenam, the Japanese invaders under T\u014dd\u014d Takatora are confident that their planned expedition to Hansong to capture King Seonjo will meet with success. However, they remain reserved over the news that Joseon's greatest admiral, Yi Sun-sin, has been restored to his former command after the disaster at Chilcheollyang, which has reduced the Korean navy to a mere dozen battle-ready ships. To ensure the success of the operation, Hideyoshi sends one of his finest naval war leaders to Joseon, Kurushima Michifusa, the commander of the Murakami Clan Navy who is an expert in naval combat but enjoys a shaky reputation among his fellow daimy\u014d as a pirate. One of the admirals of the Japanese Left Army, Wakizaka, first meets Kurushima and his lieutenant, Kimura, while he finishes off the remnants of a group of Joseon soldiers. He especially distrusts Kurushima and draws his sword on him several times, especially after the latter insults him by shaming his defeat at Hansan Island. Later, Kurushima and Haru, his sharpshooter, drink sake as Kurushima elaborates on his personal vendetta against Yi Sun-sin, stating that his brother Michiyuki had been killed by the latter earlier in the war.\nIn the meantime, Yi Sun-sin is facing the despair mounting among his officers and troops. Facing an enemy force that far outnumbers them and seeing no reasonable chance of success in the inevitable clash even with one single turtle ship remaining, many consider the fight lost before it has even started. Despite his outwardly indifferent demeanor, Yi is hard-pressed to maintain morale among his men and desperate to find a solution for his problem. However, the breaking point seems reached when General Bae Seol, the deserter of Chilcheollyang, burns the turtle ship and has his men try to assassinate Yi. Although Yi escapes and Bae is killed for his act of treachery, the ship is lost, which boosts confidence among the Japanese and further dispirits Yi's troops. To seek an answer, Yi travels to the Myeongnyang Strait, an area notorious for its strong and treacherous currents, which the Japanese intend to cross on their way to Hansong. Later, he confides in his son Hoe that to win the fight, he must turn the fear paralyzing his men into courage.\nUpon hearing that the departure of the Japanese attack fleet is imminent, Yi abandons his base and moves to Usuyeong after burning the naval facilities to the ground. The next morning, Yi's fleet arrives in the strait and is shortly met by the Japanese, who are using the morning tide to move into the channel, with Kurushima leading the vanguard. Yi engages Kurushima's fleet in battle, but as the other Korean commanders are still hesitant to involve themselves, Yi's flagship is quickly surrounded and attacked by boarding parties. In the apparently hopeless situation, Yi commands several cannons to be fired from the rower deck's port hatches in a concentrated volley, to use their recoil to blast the ship free of its encirclement. As Yi had hoped, this bold act of survival inspires the rest of his countrymen to take the fight to the enemy.\nWhen the tide turns and forms a whirlpool in the middle of the channel, thus solidifying Yi's defensive position, Kurushima orders an all-out attack with the rest of his ships. Despite the efforts of Haru and a ship loaded with black powder charges, the renewed courage of the Koreans prevails, though heavy sacrifices are made. Kurushima's desperate situation is observed by Todo, who merely laughs at Kat\u014d's suggestion of reinforcing him. Kurushima, realizing that he is now on his own, boards the Korean flagship but is decapitated by Yi himself after he takes several arrows from Korean archers, and his head is hung from the tip of the ship's mast.\nWhen Yi's ship itself is caught in the whirlpool, his civilian navy servants and local fishermen courageously drag the vessel back to safety.

She was in the process of breaking up with her abusive husband, who is serving time in prison. Her estate is being looked after by her older sister Casey, who will follow Ally's will exactly as written, which means everything goes to the estranged husband. Among Ally's effects, Seth and Nole find a lottery ticket worth $30 million. If they tell Casey about the ticket, the money will go to a wife-beater whom Ally was about to abandon rather than those more deserving - themselves, but also Ally's charity. They cannot pass it off as their own ticket, as it is covered in Ally's characteristic doodles. The solution is obvious: sacrifice one life, Casey's, to save thousands: \"If we give a third of the money to an African charity, it'll be like we're saving 40,000 lives just for sacrificing one.\" Both agree that they cannot possibly commit murder, but find it amusing to consider the possibility, and how it could be done perfectly.\nSeth and Nole start to scheme, jokingly at first, but eventually they \"get real,\" concluding that murdering Casey is, paradoxically, the \"right thing\". Seeking unwitting permission from Casey herself, they ask her if she would give up her life if it meant saving thousands of other lives; she answers: \"In a heartbeat.\" Accepting that they will live with the burden of guilt for sacrifcing an innocent person, even for good reasons, for the rest of their lives, they come up with a plan so that Casey dies with little or no suffering, one of them distracting her with a story about Ally while the other moves in for the kill. As part of the plan, they invite her over regularly, entertaining and getting to know her as they did Ally. They practice and make a few aborted attempts, but each time the one who must do the deed fails to go through with it, unable to find it in himself to commit the murder. The longer it goes on, the more they get to know her, and the more difficult the task becomes.\nFrom time to time, the pair also have to put up with Andrew, their overbearing boss, who owns a factory farm. He graphically describes the killing of terrified pigs, which upsets them, partly because they both eat meat. Later, when his farm has been the target of animal rights activists, he shares video of pigs in the slaughterhouse which horrifies them even more.\nOne day, Casey reveals that she is dying of ovarian cancer, so the pair think do not need to go through with the plan. But in fact, there is a time limit on turning in the lottery ticket, so it leaves them no better off. Moreover, it provides another justification as it turns the murder into a form of mercy killing: they can spare her a slow, agonizing death, killing her quickly, listening to her favourite piece of music, in the company of people who love her, her two new best friends. On the chosen night, everything having gone according to plan, at the last moment they try to give Casey (and themselves) a way out, telling her about the lottery ticket, pleading with her not to let it go to Ally's charity: \"Is it possible that what is right isn't what you thought it was?\" She considers, but seems unlikely to concede, her two friends and would-be murderers visibly conflicted and in emotional turmoil.\n\nAfter a fade to black, it is revealed that Seth and Nole did not commit the murder, but the lottery winnings did go to Ally's charity.

In the present day, game executive Mandi (Sarah Glendening) of Cockburn Industries, Inc. proposes to her bosses creating an intentionally bad sequel, EeeTee 2. Thanks to the popularity and success of the Angry Video Game Nerd, sales of poorly made video games have increased dramatically, and a review of EeeTee 2 by the Nerd would drive his fans to buy the game.\nThe Nerd (James Rolfe) and his sidekick Cooper Folly (Jeremy Suarez) are working on a video game review. The Nerd has become disheartened over the years, as his fans continue to buy and play the games he reviews and warns people to stay away from. On top of this, the Nerd must promote and sell bad video games as part of his job at GameCops. When he discovers marketing for EeeTee 2, his fans encourage him to review ET, something he has stood against for years because the game scarred him as a child.

He is accompanied by Cooper and Mandi, and the trip is completely funded by Cockburn Industries.\nWhile filming their expedition, Cooper reveals that he believes in a super-being known as Death Mwauthzyx, who has the power to destroy all existence. Sergeant McButter (Helena Barrett) and the legless General Dark Onward (Stephen Mendel), thinking the trio is looking for extraterrestrials, attempt to capture them. Onward accidentally blows his right arm off with a grenade, giving the trio enough time to escape.\nThe Nerd, Cooper and Mandi search for the creator of ET, Howard Scott Warshaw, for answers. They instead stumble across the home of Dr. Zandor (Time Winters), who tells them that ET's level design is an exact map of Area 51. Dr. Zandor gave the code to Warshaw to help him meet the five-week deadline Atari set for ET's completion, and to exact revenge on the government for kidnapping and holding hostage an alien he was attempting to free. The government ordered the burial of the cartridges, while Zandor escaped with the metallic material Area 51 was researching at the time in an attempt to reassemble the alien's spaceship, replacing it with tin foil. Mandi is captured by McButter while wandering outside of the house. The Nerd and Cooper, believing she is a double agent, do not go after her.\nGoing back to the Alamogordo site, the Nerd and Cooper discover a large crowd of fans and the head of Cockburn Industries promoting the release of ET 2 with the promise of digging out a copy of the original ET from the site. The Nerd tells his fans there are no cartridges buried there, but Warshaw himself appears and tells fans the opposite. Annoyed, the Nerd breaks into Area 51 disguised as an alien. He is captured, and General Onward attempts to force him to play ET. Onward launches a missile at Mount Fuji, the basis for the Atari logo, and while leaving the room, gets his left arm cut off in the door. During the launch countdown, an alien resembling the one in ET grabs the Nerd and pulls him to safety.\nThe destruction of Mount Fuji releases Death Mwauthzyx, who was trapped inside the mountain. Meanwhile, Mandi keeps McButter away from the Nerd and Cooper's location, eventually leading them to a confrontation on the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas.\nThe Nerd and alien escape in a fighter jet similar to one in the NES Top Gun video game, while the alien reveals Death Mwauthzyx can destroy all existence by turning the satellite dish on his head.

They both check around and find Takeshi hiding in a cupboard. Takeshi mumbles about Naoki's death, but is cut-off by Mika, saying that he will be killed by Takuro as he talks about it again. Takeshi refuses to move, so Hiroshi suggests that he stays there and they will pick him up when they find the way out.\nAs Hiroshi and Mika go out of the room, they meet up with Anna and Shun. Mika questions Anna's presence, but Hiroshi diverts the questions. They then go together to check around the house. Meanwhile, Takeshi gets a phone call, but no response from the other end. He then hears Takuro calling him from outside the cupboard, so he opens the door as a big blue hand grabs his head. The group hears Takeshi's scream and come back to check on him.\nAs they reach the room, they see the door open and Takeshi, bleeding, is thrown out. He asks for help before being dragged back, and the door closes. As the group enters the room, they finds Takeshi's dismembered body. Anna and Hiroshi pressure Mika about Takuro's whereabouts and about Naoki, but Mika refuses to tell them and runs away, chased by Hiroshi. Anna confronts Shun who describes that this event is the same as the game he created.\nMika goes back to Takuro and begs him to leave immediately, which he takes lightly. Mika then goes to Takuro and seemingly seduces him just to steal his keys for the house. Takuro ignores her and continues on with his work. Mika rushes to the main door, but the key doesn't seem to work. As she hears noises, she goes to check and encounters the Blue Demon, which then kills Mika.\nWith Shun's knowledge of the game, they continue on finding the keys and items to move forward inside the house. They eventually reach a room with a blood-stained piano. As they observe the piano, Mika is heard calling Shun through the door. Anna stops him from opening the door, saying that Mika will not call him. Shun is puzzled as the door gets smashed and the Blue Demon is seen. The Blue Demon enters the room, so the two flee. Shun goes to a room with chained drawers locked with number combinations. He manages to grab the handkerchief as the Blue Demon enters from another door. They run away to go back to the piano room. Shun says that they have to use the handkerchief to wipe off the blood for the combinations of a safe.\nAs they outrun the Blue Demon, Anna is stunned upon seeing the remains of Mika. As they sit and calm themselves, Anna talks about her brother Naoki, the same boy who was killed in a traffic accident, as mentioned in the beginning of the film. The accident was called suicide with the assumption of his inability to withstand bullying. Anna refers to how Shun is similar to her brother. The door then opens as Hiroshi is seen standing on the door. They then go to the piano room, then retrieve the code to get the key to eventually reach the basement.\nAs they reach the basement, they find that it has been opened by Takuro. As they go down, Takuro strikes Hiroshi, rendering him unconscious. Anna confronts Takuro and believes that Takuro is responsible for killing her brother, which he lightly denies. As Anna begins mentioning Shun's name, he gets annoyed. Puzzled by the conversation, Shun reaches the box Takuro carried and opens it, revealing his own lifeless body inside.\nShun then realizes how the group, except Anna, has been ignoring him the whole time, how Takeshi got so scared when Shun was with him (for Takeshi cannot see Shun), and why Anna said Mika will not call him, because he is already dead and cannot be seen by everyone, except Anna. He then flashbacks to the time Takuro bullied him in the riverbank. Takuro hit Shun in the head, killing him. It is then revealed that Takuro went to the empty house to hide Shun's body. Takuro then explained that Shun used Takuro's name in the game and got mad. Shun is terrified with the truth and finally disappears as Anna apologizes to him.\nTakuro plans on killing Anna since she knows too much, but suddenly gets caught by the Blue Demon, and is eaten off-screen. Anna then wakes Hiroshi up, and they both flee. The Blue Demon notices them and chases after them. Hiroshi, knowing that he can't move so easily and will slow Anna down, insists on staying to buy Anna some time to escape. The Blue Demon stomps on him as it chases Anna. Anna finally reaches the same room she was in as in the beginning of the movie, but instead of her brother, Shun is calling her from the door. Anna, confused about what to do next, opens the door into the shining light, where she is greeted by Shun.\nThe scene goes back to the river, as Shun asks Anna whether she is okay. Shun then explains about the dynamics of the game as Anna notices his scar and holds his hand, telling him to speak whatever troubles him to her, as she can't help her brother and hopes that the same thing will not happen to Shun. Shun replies by holding Anna's hand back, with the screen on the laptop says that they've cleared the game.", "tmdb_id": 297190}, "56148790": {"title": "Apartment Troubles", "plot": "Olivia and Nicole share an apartment in New York City, where they pay an illegal sublease to a landlord with whom they have under-the-table arrangement.

However, whenever they are close to finishing a job, they are sabotaged.\nOne day, while eliminating rogue combat drones, Deunan and Briareos meet Olson, a cybernetics-equipped soldier, and a young girl named Iris. Though reserved around each other, Olson discovers that Two Horns' mechanic Mattews has been deliberately crippling Briareos' systems to keep him and Deunan under Two Horns' thumb. Soon after, two cyborgs named Talos and Nyx, who are trailing Olson and Iris, appear, forcing Deunan and Briareos to depart with their new friends.

Things go well until Anamika gets kidnapped by two men. Arjun, who was in the bathroom when Anamika was kidnapped, immediately lodges a complaint at the Besant Nagar police station. Sub-Inspector Arumugam, who is assigned the case, then goes to Anamika's apartment along with Arjun, but finds that the apartment is cleaned up and there seems to be no sign that a kidnapping has taken place, while the apartment's watchman insists that Anamika had not returned to her apartment for three days. The CCTV camera installed at the apartment does not show any men arriving and taking away Anamika, prompting Arumugam to suspect that Arjun has lodged a false complaint as he is drunk. \nHowever, when Arumugam calls up Anamika's father Raghunath Kumar, the chairman of the TV news channel Channel 24, he merely replies that he doesn't know anything about the kidnapping and that Anamika is holidaying in Goa, at which Arumugam suspects something amiss, realising that Arjun had not lied after all.

There, they play a Maneki Neko, where students dressed as mice attempt to throw a bell into a hoop attached to the collar of a giant beckoning cat, while trying not to be eaten or crushed. The game is won with the aid of Takeru Amaya, a troubled classmate who seems to revel in the opportunity to see so many deaths, and who kills all the other survivors besides Shun and Ichika after winning the game. The three of them are then put out of consciousness by a sleeping gas released by the giant beckoning cat. They wake up to find themselves with other students in a room inside a giant cube hovering over Tokyo, facing the next test: students all over Japan and elsewhere in the world face similar tests, and the handful of survivors are being brought inside walls.\nThe next game is Kagome Kagome, where the students have to be blindfolded and will guess which of four floating Kokeshi wooden dolls is behind them within 10 seconds after the end of a short song. If they fail to do so, they will be hit with a red laser and the dolls will use telekinesis to destroy their bodies. If the Kokeshi lose, they will explode and one of them releases an answer key which opens the doors and frees the students to the next level. Shun meets and saves Shoko Takase by winning the game, and they reunite with Ichika and Yukio Sanada, whom they save from being killed by a fifth Kokeshi by holding their hands.\nThe four join Eiji Oku and Kotaro Maeda to the next level, where they have to use their keys to unlock a giant smiling head. Amaya brings in three more keys and kills a prisoner that he brought into the room. The seven survivors use their keys, and the giant head rolls away to dig a tunnel into the next room. Meanwhile, each player is displayed on television screens for the others to see. The next game is Shirokuma, a white polar bear that appears to them inside a frozen room. The students have to all answer the white bear's questions honestly, otherwise, they will be forced to single out the one that they suspect to be lying to be killed. Shoko and Yukio get killed, and Shun soon realizes that the bear is the true liar and that its real color is black, therefore winning the game and surviving with the other four students.\nThe final game, presented by a Matryoshka doll, is a game of kick the can that must be completed before sundown. The remaining five each pick a stick, and who gets the red one plays the \"Devil\". Whoever's face is seen and gets called out by the \"Devil\", is caught and thrown into a cell. Kicking the can in the middle will make it explode, killing nearby players. Takeru gets the red stick and soon three students are caught while Shun finds armor to conceal his face. Shun falls into the sea while chaining Takeru to the armor. As Takeru fights to pull the armor up to avoid being pulled down, Shun climbs back up, having freed himself from the armor. Both race towards the can, and Shun succeeds in kicking the can first, thereby winning the game. The Matryoshka doll reveals that in fact, the explosion is a lie and that none of them will be killed by losing the game. They have a popsicle party, where they learn their fates on the wooden stick, and that the intention of the last game was simply for entertainment. Shun and Takeru live while Ichika, Eiji, and Kotaro are killed by a Matryoshka doll with lasers that disintegrates them. Shun and Takeru emerge to the top of the cube, where they see crowds cheer for them, while a hikikomori, who has been watching them from his room, goes out of his house, possibly to find the real identity of \"God\".\nTakeru celebrates while Shun kneels in despair from all of his losses, stating that \"there is no God\". One of the Matryoshka dolls corrects him and suggests that those deadly games will lead them to \"God\", as it shows him a vagrant who was also an observer of those games and the \"God\" behind these death games.", "tmdb_id": 241863}, "46254759": {"title": "Asha Jaoar Majhe", "plot": "The woman (Basabdatta Chatterjee) works in a handbag factory while the man (Ritwick Chakraborty) works the night shift at a printing press.

The Gauls keep the Romans at bay by pretending to still possess the magic potion, while Asterix makes his way to the Mansions.

The survivors gather in a network of safe cities and build primitive humanoid robots, called Pilgrims, to help rebuild and operate in the harsh environment. These robots have two unchangeable protocols: they cannot harm any form of life and may not repair, modify, or alter themselves or other robots in any way. Initially seen as mankind's salvation, they are relegated to manual labor when they fail to stop the advance of desertification. Society has regressed due to lack of technology besides the Pilgrims, as a lack of functional aircraft or other transport prevents travel and cars are a rare commodity, and humanity is on the brink of extinction.\nIn 2044, Jacq Vaucan\u2014an insurance investigator for ROC, the company that manufactures Pilgrims\u2014investigates a report from Wallace, a police officer who shot a robot he claims was modifying itself. As Jacq looks for a robot they suspect was stealing parts, it leads him outside the city. When he finds it inside a shipping container, it sets itself on fire.

They are able to power up the robot once more, but when he asks it why it set itself on fire, it burns out again.\nJacq salvages the remains and speculates to his boss, Robert, that there may be a \"clocksmith\", someone who illegally modifies robots, who is overriding the second protocol.

Karkotakudu influences Prasad's family that Rajeshwari is bad luck and must be thrown out. The family then throws Rajeshwari out of the house.\nMeanwhile, the time arrives when Akkamma must go under arrest under supernatural powers in order to maintain the balance of the universe. Then, Karkotakudu attacks Prasad, but Rajeshwari's pure faith and the power of wife's love (through haldi and kumkuma) saves Prasad. However, Prasad's family members, in the influence of Karkotakudu, remove the kumkuma and mangalsutra away from Rajeshwari and make her wear white clothes. This makes Rajeshwari symbolize a widow, although her husband is not dead.\nFinally, Rajeshwari, heartbroken, falsely ill-reputed and nowhere to go, takes shelter in Akkamma's temple. Karkotakudu arrives to kill Rajeshwari one final time. Unfortunately, Akkamma, being under arrest, could not help her this time. She could only be free when a Simha Rashi sacrifices itself. Rajeshwari, tired of all bad things happening to her, jumps into the fire before Akkamma to commit suicide. As Rajeshwari was born under the Simha Rashi zodiac sign, Karkotakudu thinks that this might free Akkamma and she might kill him. Karkotakudu, with his powers, collects the knowledge that the supernatural powers do not accept a widow's sacrifice, and Rajeshwari at that time was symbolized as a widow. In order to symbolize Rajeshwari back as a married woman, other goddesses donate materials like kumkuma, mangalsutra, red sari, jasmine flowers, rings, kohl, toe rings, necklaces, and bangles, which will symbolize Rajeshwari back as a married woman.\nFinally, the sacrifice works, and the arrest breaks off. With Akkamma's blessings and parabrahma, a divine energy is formed inside the fire, and Rajeshwari transforms into Goddess Narasimhi (female shakti of Narasimha) .She kills Karkotakudu with her mega divine superpowers, and everything finally becomes back to normal, with Rajeshwari returning to normal human form. Akkamma appears and reveals that her child is not dead and that she took care of him when he was forcibly sacrificed. She returns the child and leaves. Prasad comes, with his mental health recovered, and they leave happily ever after. The film ends with the message Jai Mata Di (transl.\u2009Hail the mother goddess)."}, "41717759": {"title": "Avengers Confidential: Black Widow & Punisher", "plot": "Punisher busts black market weapons dealer Cain who is in possession of stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. technology and takes him hostage, inadvertently interfering with Black Widow's secret mission to uncover a larger terror plot under investigation by S.H.I.E.L.D. Widow attempts to subdue Punisher and Cain escapes during the altercation. S.H.I.E.L.D. take Punisher into custody. Having lost their sole lead, Director Nick Fury offers Punisher his freedom in exchange for going on mission with Widow to locate Cain and stop the global terrorist group known as LEVIATHAN, who plan to auction the stolen technology to the highest bidder.Widow and Punisher track Cain to a Leviathan base in Slovenia, and discover a lab filled with pods containing spies who have been turned into super-powered soldiers by Orion. Punisher captures Cain, but the latter activates a special function on his cellphone that emits a blinding flash of light directly into Punisher's face and causes him to lose time. When Punisher comes to, Cain has escaped. Widow crosses paths with a former lover and ex-S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, Elihas Starr, who was presumed dead but has been working for Leviathan. He reveals himself as the creator of the super-soldier serum and confesses he did it to become worthy of being with her, hoping she would join him. Widow declines and they fight while Punisher detonates explosives around the base. Punisher extracts Widow and Elihas disappears. Punisher reveals Cain's stolen cellphone, but it is heavily encrypted and they are unable to retrieve any information from it. They take it to S.H.I.E.L.D. super-genius Amadeus who decrypts the phone, but unknowingly activates the flash function. When they come to, an emergency countdown signalling an impending explosion has been activated. Punisher suddenly attacks Widow and kills several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. Unable to stop the countdown, Amadeus incinerates the cellphone, destroying it completely and causing Punisher to snap out of the trance he was under. Widow tells Fury about Elihas' brainwashing technology, suspecting it was controlling Punisher, and advocates against his imprisonment. Fury reveals prior knowledge of the Leviathan technology based on possibly compromised past S.H.I.E.L.D. projects about mind control that had never been fully implemented, informing Widow that she and Punisher were specifically assigned the mission because S.H.I.E.L.D. had contingencies in place should either or both of them be compromised. The same risk could not be taken with the Avengers due to the powerful nature of the tech. Fury also knows that Elihas stole classified data from S.H.I.E.L.D. including samples of the Avengers blood to use for his project. He orders Widow to complete the mission on her own.\nAngered that Fury would sacrifice them both, Widow defies his orders and takes Punisher with her to Hong Kong to meet Ren, an information handler with ties to the criminal underworld, who gives them the auction's time and location: in Madripoor that same night. The auction begins and Elihas is alerted to their presence on the compound. They are instantly overrun by the super soldiers. Hulk and Amadeus join the fight and Elihas activates the mind control technology. Punisher shields Widow while Hulk is protected by a nano-device coating over his eyes that Amadeus created to block the broadcast signals. Punisher and Widow use it on themselves before being attacked by more soldiers. Widow goes after Elihas and they fight on a catwalk above where the batch of super-soldiers for the auction are being kept. Elihas kicks Widow over the catwalk's railing but she manages to hold on. Realising he still loves her, Elihas pulls Widow to safety and they kiss. The two team up to retrieve an emergency kill-switch from Orion that Elihas created as a safety precaution against the super-soldiers. Hawkeye, Iron Man, Thor, War Machine and Captain Marvel arrive and breach the auction hall. Together with Punisher, Hulk, and Amadeus, they battle the Leviathan troops. Orion attacks Widow and Elihas when they confront him, but they are able to gain control of the switch and activate it, disabling all the active bio-soldiers. Punisher locates and attempts to shoot Elihas, which distracts Widow who is still fighting Orion. Orion fires a fatal blast at her, but Elihas jumps in the way and is hit instead. Punisher kills Orion and Elihas dies in Widow's arms.\nIn the aftermath, Fury orders Widow to arrest Punisher, who faces life in prison for killing Orion.

Sam begins displaying erratic behaviour: he becomes an insomniac and is preoccupied with an imaginary monster, which he has built weapons to fight. Amelia is forced to pick up her son from school after Sam brings one of the weapons there. One night, Sam asks his mother to read a pop-up storybook called Mister Babadook. It describes the titular monster, the Babadook, a tall pale-faced humanoid in a top hat with taloned fingers which torments its victims after they become aware of its existence. Amelia is disturbed by the book and its mysterious appearance, while Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is real. Sam's persistence about the Babadook leads Amelia to often have sleepless nights as she tries to comfort him.\nSoon after, strange events occur: doors open and close mysteriously by themselves, strange sounds are heard and Amelia finds glass shards in her food. She attributes the events to Sam's behaviour, but he blames the Babadook. Amelia rips up the book and disposes of it. At her birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby bullies Sam for not having a father, in response to which he pushes her out of her tree house; as a result she breaks her nose.

On the drive home, Sam has another vision of the Babadook and suffers a seizure, so Amelia gets some sedatives from a paediatrician.\nThe following morning, Amelia finds the Mister Babadook book reassembled on the front door step. New words taunt her by saying that the Babadook will become stronger if she continues to deny its existence, containing pop-ups of her killing their dog Bugsy, Sam, and then herself. Terrified, Amelia burns the book and runs to the police station after a disturbing phone call. However, Amelia has no proof of the stalking, and when she then sees the Babadook's suit hung up behind the front desk, she leaves. That night, Amelia tries to fall asleep and watches the Babadook open her bedroom door, crawl up the ceiling and attack her. She then turns on all the lights in the house and falls asleep with Sam downstairs. After the attack, Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, becoming impatient, shouting at Samuel for 'disobeying' her constantly, and having frequent visions of the Babadook once again. Her mental state slowly decays and she exhibits erratic and violent behaviour, including cutting the phone line with a knife and then waving the same knife aggressively at Sam without realizing it. This devolves into disturbing hallucinations, in which Amelia violently murders Sam.\nShortly after these visions, Amelia sees an apparition of Oskar, who offers to return to her if she \"brings the boy\" to him. Realizing that he is a creation of the Babadook, Amelia flees and is stalked through the house by the Babadook until it finally possesses her. Under its influence she breaks Bugsy's neck and attempts to kill Sam. Eventually luring her into the basement, Sam knocks her out. Tied up, Amelia awakens with Sam, terrified, nearby.

He also calls her every morning to remind her to watch the video in the camera, but instructs her to keep the camera hidden from Ben. Nasch reveals that her memory loss occurred after she was attacked and left for dead near an airport hotel; they both surmise that Ben tells Christine it was due to a car accident to avoid upsetting her.\nOver the course of her treatment, Christine faintly remembers a red-haired woman named Claire. Ben tells her that Claire was a friend who couldn't handle Christine's condition and ended contact with her. Later, Christine recalls that she has a son, Adam. She angrily confronts Ben over hiding their child, but he says Adam died of meningitis when he was eight.

Hassan (based on the late M.F. Husain). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with The Other Side: secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday (Kavin Dave), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself.\nWith the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only.

Noni decides to end the romantic relationship with Kid Culprit that her team has encouraged.\nIn spite of her team's attempt to cover it up, rumors persist that Noni attempted suicide, and her label tells Macy (who is also Noni's manager) that her record contract is conditional on a successful upcoming performance. However, during the performance, Kid Culprit sexually assaults and humiliates her, claiming that Noni attempted suicide because he'd broken up with her. He tries to strip Noni's clothes off on stage when Kaz rushes in to rescue her and punches Kid Culprit in her defense. Following this, Noni loses her record contract and is at a low point emotionally, so Kaz takes her on a trip to Mexico away from the spotlight where they enjoy each other's company. Noni gets rid of her old hairstyle in favor of her natural hair, and a trip to a local karaoke bar leads to Noni giving an emotional performance of \"Blackbird.\" The performance is uploaded to the internet and goes viral, causing Noni's mother and the paparazzi to find her. Macy tells Noni that the viral success of her performance has caused her record label to reconsider, and Noni agrees to return home. Kaz tells Noni he is not convinced that anything will be different than it was before, and their relationship is put on pause.\nNoni wants to add a song she has written to her upcoming album, but Macy refuses. The two fight about their relationship and Noni tells her mother that even after her suicide attempt, Macy continued to focus only on her career to the detriment of her happiness and mental health. Noni fires Macy as her manager. Meanwhile, Kaz has begun a political campaign and reflects on whether his career should take precedence over his personal happiness. Inspired by Kaz's honesty, Noni gives a television interview where she admits to having attempted suicide and says she is getting help.

Dilip lives in the slums near the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He obtains a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.\nThe plant's revenues drop due to lower sales of pesticides, and in order to reduce costs the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter, publishes reports on his printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the plant safety officer, expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipe lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate the machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant disables the warning siren.\nWarren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks.

She falsely claims to be an Associated Press reporter, but her lie is exposed during the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.\nAs the date of the disaster nears, Dilip arranges a loan for his sister's wedding. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards and that a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.\nTo overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the use of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with his sister's wedding, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind.

The world contains two major powers: the West, ruled by the Queen, and the East. The Queen manipulates events worldwide using operatives called the Queen's Watchdogs. The film's protagonist, Earl Kiyoharu Genpou (replacing Ciel Phantomhive from the anime), is a Queen's Watchdog in an unnamed Eastern metropolis. A large automobile is careering through a docks area. The man driving is rapidly desiccating, his face wrinkling, its skin crumbling. As he dies, the car crashes to a halt. A warehouse echoes with screams as dark-clad men herd young women around. The chief thug questions one young woman for carrying photos of desiccated bodies. A young man in a formal black butler's uniform suddenly appears in the warehouse, identifying himself as a servant of the Genpou family. The thugs attack. Most are disabled or killed quickly.

The earl's servants are present, including Sebastian Michaelis (the Black Butler from the previous night's battle), the clumsy maid Rin, and the house stewards Tanaka. The Earl speaks with the Queen's personal secretary Charles B. Sato about the death of the Queen's ambassador Anthony Campelle, found overnight on the docks, mummified in his car. The unusual cause of death, and the presence of a card depicting a devil, mark it as the eighth similar mysterious death of a powerful citizen in a case called the Devil's Curse. All victims have some connection with the human smuggler from the warehouse. No motivation for the deaths is apparent, however, nor is a root cause of the desiccating symptoms. The Queen demands a quick close to the case.\nAt the Eastern Ministry for State Security, Bureau of Foreign Affairs, a senior official greets the visiting policeman Tokizawa.

Tokizawa is told that if a Watchdog exists, he represents a danger to the nation and should be disposed of. Tokizawa is then warned to pretend he heard nothing about the connection between the warehouse and the Watchdog, nor about the Watchdog's proposed elimination or else the Queen will know about it. Tokizawa and a few officers learn that the Genpou Family were once called the Phantomhive family from England before the family moved to Japan and change their family name to Genpou.

During a chance encounter with Wang, Zhang learns that two additional murders have occurred by the same modus operandi. The common thread is that both of these men had dated Wu. Both men were wearing ice skates when they were killed. Zhang feels intrigued and begins to investigate. He becomes a customer of Rong Rong Laundry and tries to follow Wu at night, but she easily detects him. One day, the owner of the laundry (Wang Jingchun) explains to Zhang that he employs Wu out of sympathy, even though she does not do her job properly. In fact, five years before, Wu had damaged an expensive jacket and was unable to provide compensation, although a few days later the jacket's owner stopped complaining and disappeared.\nZhang tries to make friends with Wu, and eventually invites her to go ice-skating at an outdoor rink. Wang is secretly following the pair when he notices that a truck driver is also following them. He follows the truck driver, but while arresting him, the truck driver kills him using the blades of a pair of ice-skates as a weapon. The murder of his former partner makes Zhang even more determined. He follows up on a license plate number written on a pad of paper (presumably by Wang). While on the bus Zhang is followed by a man with a pair of skates. He goes into a restaurant and notices the man following him. He loses the man at a dance hall. The next day he follows the truck and sees the man dispose of wrapped packages from an overpass onto a passing coal train. He then follows the man to the outdoor ice skating rink. To test his new theory Zhang asks the service desk at the rink to page Liang Zhijun (the first murder victim from 1999). The man Zhang was following reacts by immediately leaving the rink.\nThe police confront Wu regarding the murders. She insists on speaking to Zhang. She tells him that Liang is alive and had killed someone during a robbery. She tells Zhang that Liang switched identities with the man and that Liang is alive and following her since 1999 and killing any man with whom she is involved.\nZhang gets Wu to help the police catch Liang. She reveals his location and arranges to meet him. They meet in a hotel and later go out to buy cigarettes. Liang notices the police and runs. Liang is armed with a gun, the police give chase and eventually kill Liang.\nThe police ask Wu for the ashes from 1999. She says that she threw the ashes in a river, which makes Zhang suspicious (he had seen her burying the ashes under a tree outside the laundry). He returns to the laundry and persuades the owner to sell him the damaged jacket that the customer had abandoned. After a search for the jacket's owner, Zhang arrives at the Daylight Fireworks Club.

She also says that in 1999 he left the club with another woman and she has not seen him since. Zhang asks the owner whether she would recognize the woman her husband left with, and she says yes. She offers to pay Zhang for the woman's whereabouts while appearing to fall into her bathtub fully clothed, indicating that she is possibly mentally unstable. Zhang says he only came to deliver the jacket.\nZhang goes back to the laundry to invite Wu to a performance at an amusement park. The next evening, on a Ferris wheel, Zhang asks Wu to look over the city. The neon lighting of the Daylight Fireworks Club is visible. Zhang asks Wu what she sees, and she admits seeing the club. Zhang wants Wu to tell him the truth before the police find out. Wu instead kisses Zhang and they end up having (awkward) sex while still on the Ferris wheel.\nPolice then question Wu and confront her with the jacket. Wu admits she killed the owner of the jacket. When she had not been able to afford to pay the value of the jacket, the owner of the jacket had forced her into an ongoing sexual relationship. Wu therefore killed the owner of the jacket. Wu said Liang had not been involved and that he had sacrificed everything for her, becoming a living dead person. She admits betraying Liang.\nZhang returns to his former life. Wu is arrested and the police walk her through the scene where the murder had taken place. When she is transported from the scene fireworks start going off, shot from a nearby rooftop.

After freeing his vehicle with a scarecrow and securing her with tape, he was mistaken as the culprit by the officer pursuing him. Attempting to explain his circumstances and cut off the tape, the baby bites Vick, who inadvertently launches his knife into the officer. Now a wanted criminal, Vick barely escapes pursuit in his slightly crippled vehicle.\nEnraged by the trouble she warranted, Vick seals his house and angrily scolds her for trashing his place. Instead of silencing the baby, her cries penetrate the entire forest. He later successfully pacifies her with a water gun, and learns her nickname \"Lola\" while washing her suit. Gradually, he becomes a fatherly figure to her. On a bicycle, Vick sets off to procure supplies for Lola when they are running short, only to be arrested by the officer. Maurice and Arnold happen to be illegally attaching missing person posters nearby in an effort to find Lola. Stopping to warn them, the officer is knocked out by the duo and they steal his patrol car. In the ensuing scuffle, Vick sneaks away undetected.\nSuspecting Vick in possession of threatening gizmos, Briar invades Vick's house with Bramble, but the mission goes off-course when Bramble insists on acquiring food instead. While they empty Vick's stash, Lola almost reveals herself to Briar, who was jump-scared several times, unable to determine the cause nor convince Bramble. Lola sneaks into Bramble's bag and the brothers depart. At their treehouse, after Bramble almost mistakes her for an apple, the bears were confused and terrified by her appearance, having almost zero contact with humans other than Vick. They warm up to each other quickly and begin to hang out.\nVick, who was devastated when he discovers his house ransacked by bears, was relieved to have Lola gone. His past animosity against them gets the better of him in a nightmare, and he storms off to rescue her, unaware of the events occurred in his absence. The bears and Vick have a tense standoff and brief scuffle inside the tree while Lola suddenly succumbs to a fever, forcing Vick to rush her home. The brothers attempt to help Vick also, with Bramble inadvertently thwarting Maurice and Arnold. After repeated failures, Arnold and Maurice' unseen employer decides to take matters into his own hands.\nVick and the Bears come to an alliance with Lola's presence as the three constantly organize activities to entertain her, with the former even constructing an aerial bicycle while the bears follow them around in Vick's truck. Soon, mercenaries appear and attempt to capture Lola. While Vick attempts to dodge them, Briar and Bramble make use of their pyrotechnics and appropriate enemy equipment to fight them off, with Briar even indirectly incinerating a hostile blimp. Despite their best efforts, Vick and Lola were knocked out, snagged by Maurice and Arnold. The bears notice the stolen police car driving away and follow them in Vick's abandoned bike.\nVick was taken to the headquarters of a corporate enterprise, where their leader reveals himself as the mastermind behind Lola's disappearance: Lola was an orphan adopted by his deceased father, his predecessor. He desires to reclaim the inheritance passed to Lola, having sensed the fortune sealed in a  vault only unlocked by her. Maurice and Arnold were amongst many working for him. Lola ends up tearing off his toupee, and Vick mocks him for being bald.\nBriar and Bramble, having pursued the thugs to company grounds, sneak into a nearby warehouse. While mostly silent, the brothers accidentally alert a group of armed guards playing Majong and barely survive the ensuing pursuit under gunfire. Defeating them with disguises and a duet, the bears discover Vick and Lola's location. Briar sends Bramble to alert the authorities, and a nearby crane catches his eye. Bramble smashes the wrecking ball and Briar into the building, then slides down to assist. The CEO, Maurice and Arnold flee, leaving the bodyguards to stop the trio. Vick frees himself, and the bears easily pummel their opposition.\nBriar, Vick and Bramble pursue them to a catwalk. Briar seizes Maurice, but the CEO retakes Lola by collapsing the bridge and an active turbine. Maurice escapes, and Arnold threatens to kill Briar if they approach. Using Briar's aerial advantage point and the turbine's winds keeping him airborne, Vick gets Bramble to launch himself. With the help of air currents fueling his spin, Briar viciously throws Vick at Maurice and Arnold, defeating them instantly.\nThe CEO eventually reaches the Vault, tricking Lola into unlocking its digital security measures with her hands. However, he is frustrated when he finds nothing but his legacy items from his youth and a letter from his father to Lola. The trio storm the vault, and while the boss makes his escape on a reinforced elevator, Briar finds a window of opportunity to advance.\nStill in disbelief, the CEO flees in a helicopter. Briar and Bramble grapple onto its landing skids, with Vick catching up by pole-vaulting. In the cabin, Lola messes with the controls, and the chopper flies erratically, forcing the three to also dodge various hazards ad eventually storm the vehicle. The bears' weight cause the aircraft to tilt, and Vick jumps out to save Lola, while Bramble and Briar grab him, holding onto the left access. In order to rid the intruders, the CEO activates autopilot but fails to evict Briar due to the latter's extreme mass. As they approach a chimney, at Vick's urging, they all bail and land safely in a towering industrial water tank moments before the collision. The CEO, having survived and clinging on a parachute, swears revenge at them but was cornered by a group of responding officers.\nWith the true mastermind imprisoned and Lola rescued, Vick was exonerated and declared a hero for his part, with everyone returning to their normal lives, though he remains confused to the chain of events that occurred. Disturbed by his boss Mr. Li in a snowy morning, an irritated Vick promises to continue supplying timber. As he hangs up, Vick discovers a parcel mailed to his doorstep. Inside, he discovers various repaired items photographs of Lola with the old man who adopted her, as well the reconstructed letter, in which he proclaims her importance to him as he was dying.

A human boy named Eggs lives among them, cared for by a Boxtroll named Fish. As Eggs grows up, he becomes dismayed by the disappearing Boxtrolls, such as Wheels and Oil Can, seized by Snatcher.

Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his financial affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura (Freya Ravensbergen), to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life.  Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment.\nThe film is unique and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made genuinely funny by the actors. The logic and consequenses of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn't appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact \"Viviana\" in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting for him to see her.\nThere is a secondary plot about another scientist seeking to undermine Murray's work. This comes into play as Santiago and Murray attempt to source the equipment they need for their experiment.

There is a local health centre minus a permanent doctor (Azad Abul Kalam) as no one is willing to work and live in a village. There is also a primary school with no more than a handful of pupils and the few who do go to school hardly ever attend college afterward. The population of the village is just average, neither too dense nor too sparse. One it was a predominantly Hindu locality, but in a course of time, the proportion of Hindus has declined to the level of Muslims and is continuing to decline further. However, any conflict or clash between the adherents of the two faiths is yet unheard of in this village. All villagers live in an atmosphere of friendly tolerance. Everything has been going well for ages, but at one point an ancient banyan tree becomes the focal point of dispute between the two sections of the village community. Situated on public land, this tree has been witness to the passage of time. It is said that once this plot of land used to be the property of a Hindu zamindar, but at present it belongs to the government.\nThe villagers do not have many possessions, except for a few things. The Muslims have a mosque, the Hindus a temple. There are one community health centre and an ancient railway station. One day the Hindus suddenly began to think: \"Wish we could have another temple!\" The Muslims also thought: \"If we could not have another mosque, why not an Eidgah at least?\" And both sides wanted their temple or mosque to be erected on the empty public land. But the tree on the plot stood in the way.\nThe only resident doctor in the village, elderly homoeopath Araj Ali (Azad Abul Kalam), had been applying to the authorities for the last five years for a good doctor for the health centre. Finally, his application bore fruit, a qualified doctor was sent from the district town, and on the same day the village carpenter Tulsi's(Intekhab Dinar) goat died on the public land. Hindus and Muslims were shocked by the incident, they suspected the tree on the plot was cursed. Rumour was rife in the village that the old banyan tree was the cause of the animal's death. To prevent the recurrence of such incidents the vicinity of the tree was declared inaccessible to all human beings, their cattle, and other domestic pets. But at one time children used to play hide-and-seek around that banyan tree on the public land, on scorching hot days cowherds dozed in its soothing shade, peasants working in the fields cooled their perspiring bodies under its leafy branches while eating the lunch brought by their wives or daughters. But in a few days time, the cursed tree claimed its second victim, the carpenter Tulsi's old mother (Dilara Zaman) who went gathering dry leaves under it. Tulsi's wife Durgarani (Sohana Saba) told everyone that tree was indeed the killer of her mother-in-law.\nThe newly qualified doctor Abir Ahmed at the village health centre examined the dead woman and said that she had died of a heart attack.\nThe Hindus refused to accept his verdict. Overnight the tree turned into a deity. Illiterate and superstitious Hindus began to worship the tree from a safe distance, the over-zealous among them even dared to decorate the trunk and branches of the tree with red pennants. The Brahmins began to proclaim that the tree deity could only be appeased by performing puja under it and offering human sacrifice.\nThe time of Durga Puja, the biggest Hindu festival, drew near. Muslims too prepared to rejoice in the festivities of their Hindu neighbours. The image of goddess Durga was being constructed in the temple. Arati \u2013 ritualistic worship with oil lamps and burning sense accompanied by the loud ringing of bells and beating of gongs \u2013 was performed every evening in the temple till late, although worshippers were careful not to begin it until the Muslims had ended their namaz. This was a familiar daily scenario in Mohanpur.\nMohanpur has a small marketplace consisting of only a handful of shops. Protul Nag is the night watchman, appointed by Gour Biswas, the head of the temple committee. It is said that he had murdered his wife. Protul patrols the market area every night, shouting \"Beware, all honest people!\" although his own honesty is subject to question. One night a thief broke into a shop and tried to escape carrying a sackful of rice. But he ran into Protul and dropping the sack ran off to hide under the banyan tree on the public land. There were heavy rains and thunderstorm that night and the next morning the thief was found lying stone dead under the tree. After examining the corpse the qualified doctor Abir Ahmed said the man had been murdered.\nThe Hindus refused to accept the doctor's opinion. They said: \"The deity is demanding human sacrifice. Such incidents will not stop until the deity\u2019s demand is met.\" The veteran homoeopath Araj Ali asked: \"If the man has indeed been killed by that tree, why is there a vicious bruise on his head?\" But no one paid any heed to his question.\nTulsi was dumbfounded with grief at his mother's death. He had the lurking suspicion that the members of the temple committee might have \npersuaded his wife Durga to poison the goat. Were they responsible for his mother's death as well? His mother and Durga had never been on very good terms with each other, so he could not help suspecting his wife. So he withdrew into a shell and simply stopped talking. Meanwhile, a clandestine relationship developed between Durga and the new doctor Abir. This gave rise to covert whisperings in the village.\nThe homoeopath Araj Ali repeatedly sent applications to the district town praying for the interference of the authorities to resolve this situation. One day a Police Inspector arrived to make inquiries into the questions involving the banyan tree. Both Hindus and Muslims gathered at the spot. The Inspector carefully examined the tree. Araj Ali's letters had already appraised the Inspector of the dirty politics behind the incidents taking place in the village. An elderly Hindu villager came forward and said: \"Inspector Sir, this tree is not a mere tree, it\u2019s a deity. It\u2019s demanding more blood.\" The Inspector replied: \"So you\u2019re advocating human sacrifice here! You want a temple where you can worship. But was there ever a temple at this spot?\" An old Muslim gentleman shouted: \"There has never been a temple here. Why is it necessary to preserve this tree? Let\u2019s cut it down!\" These heated arguments created considerable excitement among the crowd and led to skirmishes. Finally, the police managed to disperse the crowd by wielding sticks and the Inspector even had to fire a few rounds. The police force left without taking a decision.\nThe next day a bagful of money reached the Inspector. The authorities shook their hands off the matter. And the mosque committee discovered that their agitation was about to fizzle out since their community had suffered no loss of life or property. Meanwhile, the temple committee arranged to guard the tree lest someone tried to destroy it. In spite of that one night, some men wearing caps managed to tear off the red ribbons hung from its branches. Coming to know of this Araj Ali rushed there and re-fastened the red ribbons, two village communities.\nThe same night the dead body of Araj Ali was found at the bottom of the tree. The fingers of one of his lifeless hands were clutching a cap. The mosque committee placed the blame of Araj Ali's death squarely on the temple committee while the latter accused the former of the same crime. The two sides began taking out processions, in turn, protesting against this heinous act and demanding justice.\nApprehending that the situation was quickly going out of control, the doctor Abir Ahmed petitioned the higher authorities. The government responded with strict orders that neither side was to erect any kind of structure in the vicinity of the disputed tree. Hindus and Muslims then joined hands to drive the Doctor Abir out of the village. They chose Tulsi's beautiful wife Durga as the instrument for making their plan work.\nTheir plan was successful. Answering the coquettish call of Durga, the doctor came to see her behind her house in the dead of night. He was caught red-handed by vigilant villagers. The same night both Hindus and Muslims gathered in the courtyard of Haji Sahib where the doctor was put on trial. Their verdict was that Doctor Abir must leave the village by the first light of dawn. Progressive ideology was thus defeated by dirty politics.\nBut will this politics of religious dogmatism, of vested interests ever come to an end? Or is it to continue as long as the human race lasts? But that banyan tree is still standing on that same public land, and politics is still being played around it.\n\"O Brihonnola Tree, may you survive forever because you too have the right to live.\"", "tmdb_id": 528163}, "37447013": {"title": "Broken (2014 film)", "plot": "Widower Lee Sang-hyeon lives a quiet life with his 15-year-old daughter Su-jin.

They discover that the mouths have been positioned to form the syllables of the word \"L\u00edbera\".\nMicallef consults Father Price (Donald Sutherland), a priest in the nearby Catholic church who specializes in Latin. Price explains the various meanings and uses of \"libera\", including a \"Resurrection Prayer\", which supposedly holds the power to raise the dead. He claims that Jesus was resurrected through the sacrifice of 12 willing souls. Micallef deduces that the serial killer she is pursuing is contorting his victims' faces into the 12 syllables of the Resurrection Prayer.\nMicallef's deputy, Ben Wingate (Topher Grace), uses his mother's travel points to fly to British Columbia to follow a lead from the Delia Chandler killing.

He \"ain't ever seen a gator come all the way inside the shack before. He probably smelled all that blood\" and heard Reagan thrashing around.

Reagan asks what Mike is going to do to him. He tries to tell Junior that Mike is crazy.

That he used to be so cool, but he still loves his movies. Junior tells him he must take care of himself to look younger. Reagan tells Junior he looks pretty fit, asks if he works out; Junior is flattered.\nThe TV news posits the photo leaks and tweets may not be what they seem, as there is surveillance video of Reagan getting into a van at the hotel, but all his belongings are still in his hotel room. Also, the voicemail he recorded is actually a verbatim quote from a movie he was in, where he was a kidnapped soldier. 'Kristy' was the name of Reagan's character in that movie.\nThe police are now looking for the van and the whereabouts of Reagan Pierce. They're not sure if it is some sort of code or a suicide threat. \nBack at the shack, Junior gives Reagan some gator meat. Reagan says it is good. Junior tells him he has a nice smile. Looks like he is flirting a little. Reagan picks up on it and asks if he has a girlfriend. Junior says no. Asks if Reagan has a girlfriend. Reagan says no, he just ended things. Then says, maybe it is time for something different. Junior offers him some more gator meat. Reagan says yes. While Junior walks away, Reagan grabs the extra length of his chain and puts it under his leg. Junior asks him if he ever tried it on with a dude. Reagan says if he gets drunk enough he is typically down for whatever. Junior tells him he has some whiskey. He goes to get the whiskey and does a little cocaine. Junior pours some whiskey into his mouth. Reagan says \"it's working already.\"\nJunior says his heart is beating fast.\nJunior starts kissing his neck. Reagan freaks out and says to get off him. Says he cannot. Junior walks away upset. Reagan tries to calm him down. Junior says it is alright, because he 'roofied' [drugged] his gator stew. Junior \"just has to wait a bit, and then he can get him at night.\" Reagan starts to feel the effects of the roofie, and seems to pass out. Junior walks over puts his hands in his mouth, getting aroused. He pulls off Reagan's pants. He takes off his own pants, and is about to rape Reagan when the phone rings. Reagan head-butts him and takes the chain, wraps it around Junior's neck, and strangles him.\nReagan is overcome by the drug and passes out. Mike tries to call back again, and sees in a google search there's a \"mystery vehicle\" the authorities are looking for in connection with Reagan's disappearance. Mike freaks and is driving there and calling over and over. Reagan wakes up to a gator snapping at Junior's legs. It bites Junior and carries him out the shack. Reagan can see the phone continues to light up with Mike calling. Reagan is able to get the chain off the wall, but cannot undo his wrists.\nMike drives to Junior's mother's house looking for Junior; Junior is not there. He mentions that the road to the shack is flooded, and that he is going to take a boat. \nMeanwhile, Reagan walks out of the shack to a car in the yard and sees keys in the vehicle. He gets in and tries to start the car, but it does not work.\nMike drives the boat up and gets out. He slips and sees Junior's dead body on the edge of the water and he gets angry. Mike goes to the shack and looks around for Reagan in there. There are no lights, so he is walking around with a flashlight. Mike says \"oh, he's outside\" after he cannot find him in the shack and starts to walk back to the door. He sees Reagan and says he has \"got him\". Reagan says \"yeah, you got me\", and shoots Mike with some sort of spear gun. Mike drops and Reagan takes the gator thumper and beats Mike to death.\nLater, a reporter is interviewing Reagan, with his arm in a cast; she asks when did he think he was going to live. He says he did not at first, because even though the kidnappers were both dead, he still had to get to a boat, and he knew alligators were roaming around. So he thought to wait until morning. Reagan was pretty incoherent in the morning but he got in the boat. He was yelling, and men who were out fishing heard him. They found him and carried to land and got him to a hospital.\nReagan has returned home and gets a phone call from his manager, who says that his interview got amazing views. Everybody wants him in their movies.That night, Reagan pulls up his e\u2011mails on his computer and finds an e\u2011mail from Junior, apologizing for the way they met but reminding him that there was some good in it.

At the end of the third day, Praveen asks Nanditha to kiss Sudheer to divert from death, per male psychology.

Zongyao frantically searches for a commendation medal he had stolen from his father before he left home that evening, worried that he may have dropped the medal near Bai Hu\u2019s body. The next day, Huan discovers that she is bleeding which implies that she has miscarried, although she keeps this a secret from Zongyao. The two discuss what to do and the next day, Zongyao decides to return to the village and give himself up. Before reaching the village, Zongyao comes across a funeral procession and is told by one of the mourners that Bai Hu has died, his body burnt beyond recognition, after falling asleep drunk in the forest and setting his surroundings on fire with his cigarette butt.\nIn the second story, which starts earlier on the night of Bai Hu\u2019s death, villager Li Qin, wife of the abusive and philandering Chen Zili, is having an affair with another married villager Wang Baoshan. They quarrel and Li Qin dares Baoshan to kill Chen Zili. After leaving Li Qin\u2019s house, Baoshan stops by the convenience store owned by Zhuang, who is secretly in love with Li Qin and likely jealous of Baoshan. Zhuang then observes Baoshan walking off in the direction that Huan was seen to be going when she had walked by a few minutes before. The next morning, Li Qin discovers that Baoshan has been accused of killing Huan, who had disappeared overnight, and burning her body. In front of other villagers, Baoshan asks Li Qin to provide him with an alibi for the time of the supposed murder. Li Qin refuses and goes home. Later, Li Qin is informed that the identity card of her husband Chen Zili had been found on the burnt body and that the corpse is his. Baoshan is released. Zhuang, who had caused the villagers to suspect Baoshan for killing Huan, arranges the funeral of Chen Zili, to curry favor with Li Qin. On his way back to the village after buying goods for the funeral, Zhuang is waved down by a man by the roadside. He is shocked to see that it is Chen Zili, alive and well. Zhuang gives Zili a lift and Zili promptly falls asleep in the van. Zhuang picks up a rock to smash Zili\u2019s head in but doesn\u2019t go through with it eventually. Zili wakes up and goes off into the bushes to relieve himself. Zili\u2019s phone rings, and he answers but accidentally drops it. Startled, he loses his footing and plunges off the steep cliff where he had been relieving himself, apparently to his death.\nIn another storyline, we see Bai Hu in the city shortly before his death. He repeatedly borrows money from loan sharks to fund his gambling addiction. He also appears to be sick, and has a nosebleed. He meets Chen Zili in the city by chance on the morning of his death, and it is implied that he steals Zili\u2019s wallet which also contained Zili\u2019s identity card. Bai Hu then makes his way to the village, reaching it at night, where he comes across Zongyao and Huan, resulting in his own death. The loan sharks come to the village the next morning to collect the debt and, unable to find Bai Hu, threaten to burn down the house of Bai Guoqing, Bai Hu\u2019s elder brother.\nIn the last story which begins around the time of Bai Hu\u2019s death, village chief Xiao Weiguo, Zongyao\u2019s father, is walking home through the forest after attending an unrelated funeral. He hears the commotion caused by the altercation between his son and Bai Hu, and witnesses the latter\u2019s death. After his son has fled, Weiguo drags the body to another spot closer to the village and burns it. The next morning, Weiguo pretends to find the charred body by accident, after he and another villager spot the smoke. The villagers first assume it is Huan and later that it is Chen Zili. Deeply remorseful, Weiguo calls Chen Zili to prove that he is still alive, which results in the phone call that causes Zili\u2019s fall from the cliff. The police find Zili\u2019s body and contacts Li Qin, who goes to identify his body and collect his ashes. Zhuang drives Li Qin in his van and Li Qin discovers Zili\u2019s walking cane, which had been left behind in the van. Li Qin takes the cane and rejects Zhuang\u2019s romantic intentions. Li Qin leaves the coffin containing Bai Hu\u2019s body with Weiguo, asking him to locate the unknown deceased\u2019s kin.\nBai Guoqing, Bai Hu\u2019s brother, goes to Weiguo with a request to use the coffin to stage Bai Hu\u2019s death and fool the loan sharks. Thinking that Bai Hu will finally get a proper burial by his real family, Weiguo agrees. The Bai family holds the funeral procession and succeed in deceiving the loan sharks that Bai Hu is dead. But instead of burying him, the Bais leave the coffin in the open mountainside, reasoning that the body would be claimed by others. Overcome with guilt and unable to have closure, Weiguo takes Zongyao to the police and tell the authorities the whole story.", "tmdb_id": 292362}, "40167309": {"title": "Cold in July (film)", "plot": "Ann Dane, startled by the sound of a door window breaking, wakes her husband, Richard.

However, when the Danes arrive home to find their front door broken in, the family is put under police protection.\nPolice are posted around the house, including one guard inside, hoping to catch Ben when he returns.  It turns out that Ben never left and has been hiding in the house's crawlspace since the initial break-in. He emerges and knocks out the guard, goes into Jordan's room, and locks the door.

When they attempt to meet him at his new home, they instead find a number of home videos which turn out to be snuff films, one of which features Freddy Russell beating a woman to death with a baseball bat.  Richard wants to take the tape to the police.  Jim believes the police already know about the videos but are unconcerned because Freddy is far more valuable as an informant against the Dixie Mafia while the victims are illegal immigrants whom few will miss.  Ben is so enraged by his son's actions that he is resolved to kill him at any cost.\nThey track Freddy to a remote mansion where he and his associates are making another snuff film.  They infiltrate the mansion and begin killing everyone they encounter.  When Freddy is the last survivor, Ben hesitates to kill him, and Jim is shot.

When Sarah questions Dale as to why he is staring at her, he says that she reminds him of someone, later revealed to be his mother.\nWhile Josh takes additional shifts at work, Sarah passes out and experiences a highly realistic dream in which she is murdered.  Confused by the fact that her clothes are different and the room cleaned, she investigates further and discovers her original shirt in the laundry, bloodied.  Josh suggests that she talk to her friend Leslie, a pregnant doctor.  Leslie, who experienced similar issues in the past, diagnoses her with night terrors and prescribes a hypnotic.

Silencing her negative thoughts, he details the things he's grown to love about her: overusing 'so', when wisps of her hair cover her face, her eyes...

Brent's mother Emma invites Lacey and Brent to dinner to spark a romance in a bid to acquire grandchildren. Hank has a falling-out with Brent after Brent refuses to invest in his plan to bring a corporate Coff-Nuts franchise to Dog River, which would hurt Lacey's restaurant. After Lacey advises a Coff-Nuts representative named Jerome that the town is broke, a woman representing a company called CN Holdings attempts to convince the townspeople to sell their homes. Hank overhears the woman and Jerome scheming, so he takes Jerome to Dog River's rival town Wullerton in hopes that Coff-Nuts will change its plan and ruin the rival town. Davis receives word and pursues Hank. Hank abandons Jerome and runs into Davis before Wullerton's astonishingly friendly citizens drive the two back to Dog River.

However, as he leaves the bar, he suffers an injury, causing him to file a lawsuit against Brent. Wanda volunteers to represent Brent, but she loses the case, causing Corner Gas to be confiscated and the bar to be condemned.\nFitzy later returns with a plan to allow Wullerton to annex Dog River, which proves unpopular. Brent and Lacey then rally the town to prepare for the \"Quaintest Town in Canada\" contest judge, Tina Fuller, to enter Dog River, but a series of mishaps creates the appearance of a riot in the middle of town. Everyone then gathers at The Ruby, where Lacey encourages everyone to financially support Brent, but Brent declines their aid due to the judgment against him. Tina sympathizes with the town's predicament and writes an article to garner public support for Dog River. The media attention forces Coff-Nuts to drop the lawsuit. Between the proceeds from Wanda's casino, Karen's tickets, and a fundraising drive by residents of Wullerton, the town is saved.

He made use of the shape to make a 'butt' . After it has done, Shinnosuke controlled Robot dad to do the 'buriburi dance' with the form. Itsuki escapes, and tries to use the melting wave but this time it failed, and ended up reflecting it onto Dandanbara, Misae and Omega.

Let's decide with arm wrestling.\" The final battle began. The battle was a heated one with both sides refusing to give up. In the end human Hiroshi beat Robot Hiroshi.

He is released into the care of his brother Ariki, who allows him to sleep in his son's room. Upon hearing about a chess club run by his old chess buddy Noble Keelan, he goes around to his house early in the morning to ask to join.  He is told he can only do so if he promises to not \"rock the boat.\" Genesis meets the Eastern Knights Chess club in a shed where he learns that they only have one chess board, and the kids are not particularly motivated. He introduces himself and discloses that he wants to lead them to the Junior National Championships in Auckland, something Noble is initially frustrated with Genesis about. Mana, Ariki's son, followed him to the club, and it is revealed that he will be patched into his father's Gang, the Vagrants, on his birthday. He is given over to Mutt to harden him up. Ariki, believing that Genesis could interfere with this process asks him to leave. Genesis begins sleeping on the monument on Kaiti Hill, and leading meetings at the Chess club, now held at the marae with new chess sets.

Footsteps are heard from above, and then several men find them, severely assaulting the man and then dragging them both away as the woman screams.\nSometime later, a young stranger rides into a remote town somewhere in the Austrian Alps. Having introduced himself as a photographer, Mr Greider, he becomes the lodger of a widow whose husband and son suffered an untimely death. Soon, the newcomer learns that the entire town is firmly under the dominion of an aged rich man named Old Brenner and his six power-drunk sons. One day, the widow sends her daughter to town to run some errands. Greider is invited and decides to accompany young Luzi. As Luzi does her shopping, Greider asks for coffee and horseshoe nails. The brothers discover him at her side within the store, and command him to drink their schnapps. When he politely refuses by stating that he \"doesn't drink,\" one of the brothers beats him into compliance. Later, one of the Brenner brothers dies in what looks like a freak logging accident. Soon this same fate befalls another of the brothers; he falls off a cliff having been blinded by a branch with nails on it. Old Brenner finds nails in his dead son's eyes. Since Greider is suspected to have had his hand in these accidents, he hides.\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that the Brenners walk in the footsteps of their father. At every local wedding they claim the (fictional) medieval prerogative of Primae noctis; only Greider's parents (the young couple from the opening scene) had refused to comply. For that defiance, the Brenners crucified Greider's father, but his mother managed to escape and find refuge in America. The local priest still supports what the Brenners do. Greider confronts the priest in private, revealing that he's come to crack down on the Brenners. He admits that he did kill the two Brenner sons. After telling the priest that he's next to die, Greider shoots him.\nGreider rescues Luzi from the grasp of the Brenners after she marries Lukas and is abducted. Greider challenges them to a duel on the next day. Rather than waiting for the appointed duel, the brothers try to ambush Greider at the remote mountain cabin where he is holed up. At dawn they come after him, attacking all together. A shootout ensues. Greider is outnumbered four-to-one, but he has the advantage of a Winchester lever-action repeating rifle, while the Brenners all wield two shot side-by-side and breechloading rifles and are unfamiliar with a repeating rifle. Skillfully leveraging this edge, Greider kills or leaves for dead the remaining four brothers. He then seeks to deliver the message of their deaths to their father, but discovers that some citizens of the town remain loyal to Brenner senior.\nAs Greider approaches Brenner's home he is attacked by the blacksmith, a hulking giant brandishing a large iron log hook. Lukas manages to save Greider by shooting the blacksmith, but not before the hook finds its way through Grieder's shoulder. After the fight, Greider storms Old Brenner's house and finds him in his bed. Greider gives Old Brenner a picture of his mother, explaining the reason for killing Old Brenner's sons and now him. Old Brenner reveals to Greider that he is Greider's father (a product of his mother's rape by Brenner on her wedding night) and so therefore he has murdered his own half-brothers. Brenner asks him \"to make it quick\" and Greider obliges by shooting him in the heart. Greider recovers for three weeks from his wounds.

Unable to contact them the Foreman goes searching for them, finding only a logger's severed arm. He is then violently killed in his truck by an unseen creature.\nLater in town Sheriff Paul Shields and his new deputy from New York, Donny Saunders, speak to farmer Ron who insists one of his valuable horses has been stolen, though without evidence of theft it is assumed the horse merely escaped through an open gate. Paul then leaves to pick up his son Adam from his wife Susan who no longer lives with him after the accidental death of their other son, Tim. That night Adam sees a creature in the back yard and when Paul investigates he hears but does not see a large creature in the trees.\nThe next morning Paul finds large footprints in the snow around his house that appear to come from an animal with hooves that walks on two legs. Donny informs him the footprints are around everybody's houses in the entire town. Paul and Donny follow the footprints into the woods where they also find large claw marks on the trees where the footprints disappear. After hearing from park rangers that no known animal with hooves could walk such a distance on two legs Paul assumes the whole thing is a prank. Paul later hears from the town priest that his dog and a lot of other animals have gone missing. Paul then goes to a local store where Ron's daughter Clair and several hunters confront him with their fears about old Indian stories of creatures living in the woods, though Paul dismisses this. Earl, another hunter, informs Paul that even though it is hunting season, all the deer and other forest animals have disappeared, meaning a large new predator may be in the area.\nAs Paul drives Adam home they both see a very large creature in the back yard, but when Paul investigates, all he finds is a bridle up a tree that he confirms is from Ron's missing horse. The next day Paul and Susan meet Adam's teacher to talk about how Adam is not dealing with his brother's death, during which Susan becomes angry and upset. Paul meets Donny where they both witness a very large flock of birds in the sky flying south when they should be flying north. Susan tells Donny how Paul was watching their son Tim when he fell, hit his head and died and how he still blames himself even though she doesn't. That night Paul is called to Ron's farm where he sees the creature attempt to enter the horses stables before it flees, leaving behind more footprints showing the hoof is split into 3 sections, even though most cloven hoofed animals only have 2. That night Paul discovers a dead deer that had been mauled in the road but before he can move it the creature suddenly appears and takes the body with it. Donny wonders if it is not simply a forest predator that had not yet been discovered, similar to large fish species thought to be extinct that actually still exist deep in the ocean.\nThe next day three hunters are attacked by the creature in the woods. Two are killed and one makes it back to town. The bodies of the two dead hunters are later found hidden high in the trees. Paul bans any more hunters from entering the forest and orders everybody in town to stay indoors at night. He also reports the two deaths and calls in 2 dozen park rangers to hunt and kill the creature within 24 hours. That night a heavy snow storm hits the surrounding area and most of the town evacuates. Paul theorizes that the creature had been pushed from its territory by the logging company and is looking for a new home and sees humans as a threat. One of the hunters shows Paul film footage of a large creature walking on two legs. As the storm gets worse the creature breaks into Paul's house, where Paul barricades himself and Adam in the bathroom until the arrival of Donny scares it away.\nPaul gathers everybody who did not evacuate into the church, saying it is the safest place for everybody to stay until the park rangers arrive in the morning to hunt and kill the creature. However, the creature attacks the church and Susan manages to motivate Paul into forgiving himself for Tim's death.

He tasks the hunters to guard the door then takes Donny to kill the creature.\nAs they follow the creature through the church Paul and Donny split up. Donny is attacked in the kitchen but manages to shoot the creature with his shotgun. Paul follows the creature only to be attacked and drop his rifle. He flees back into the main hall and hides beneath the pews. However, the creature finds him and he shoots it with his pistol before it disappears. Paul realises it can climb as it suddenly drops down from the ceiling. As it rushes towards him Paul shoots it once again but drops his pistol as it overpowers him. He instead draws his hunting knife and stabs the creature to death.\nReturning to the basement Paul tells everybody the creature is dead and leads them back into the church. However, as Donny examines the creature's body he realises he had shot it in the shoulder with his shotgun, yet the wound was suspiciously missing.

Berk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. Hiccup asks Gobber what's happening, and Gobber explains that after Silent (now dubbed Not So Silent) Sven broke his silence, his sheep ran out of their pens because they're afraid of his new voice. Stoick and Gobber struggle to gather the sheep, so Stoick orders Hiccup and the gang to round up the sheep as he gets ready for the Regatta; if he has to hear Sven scream any more, he'll put a hook through his own head just to end the torture.\nWhile in the process of catching the sheep, the Riders end up turning it in to an impromptu competition against each other in getting as many sheep as possible; they all arrive back at the pen and discover they all got three sheep each. Astrid points out that there is no winner in this 'competition'. Sven then cries out, alarmed that his prized black sheep is still missing and hoping that it didn't fall down the well again. At the mention of this, the Riders declare the black sheep as a tiebreaker. Hiccup states that it isn't a competition, but it falls on deaf ears: with the exception of Fishlegs, the others have already taken off. Moments later, Snotlout and Hiccup both spot the sheep, and they race towards it head on. Just as Hiccup is about to grab the sheep in his clutches, Gobber blocks his path and they collide, allowing Snotlout to claim the black sheep. Hiccup asks Gobber what's so urgent, and as he tries to remember Stoick calls Hiccup to come meet him, which was what Gobber was about to inform Hiccup about.\nStoick is preparing to set sail down at the docks, and informs Hiccup that he will be gone for several days to get wood from Loki Island: the lumber is lighter and stronger than any other wood they know of, and building their Regatta ship with it will be their secret weapon. He appoints Hiccup to oversee the preparations for the Regatta in his place, which Hiccup isn't excited to hear about due to the fact that he sees boats slowly moving across the harbor to be 'boring'. Stoick justifies that the Regatta is tradition and claims that it is a good way to 'blow off steam'; if Vikings aren't fighting against any enemies they need to fight against each other in competition, illustrated by two Vikings on the next dock over whacking each other with fish. Just as Stoick leaves, Fishlegs creeps in on Hiccup, saying that he is happy for Hiccup, as he considers being in charge of the Regatta as an honor. Fishlegs then helps Meatlug board a ship covered in a big cloth, which is hiding what he is working on. Fishlegs considers himself to be a sailor at heart and is excited that he is now finally old enough to compete; he and Meatlug will be working on their ship until the Regatta.\nMeanwhile, at the Academy, Tuffnut is plotting out some rules for the Riders' sheep competition, but is interrupted as Hiccup arrives reluctantly prohibiting them to carry on with their plan as he has Stoick's strict orders to prepare for the Regatta. The next day, Hiccup discovers that the Riders' have disobeyed his order and have carried on the sheep catching. Down below, the villagers are enjoying the Riders' sheep catching competition and say that it is much better than the Regatta. Later, the villagers gather at the Great Hall, growing restless for entertainment and they want to see the Dragon Race again. Hiccup has Toothless quiet down the crowd, then tries to regain their enthusiasm for the Regatta but is unsuccessful.\nInspired by the twins, the crowd wants another Dragon Race. Astrid then says to Hiccup that Stoick isn't going to be back for a few days and points out that the Dragon Race is also a great way to blow off steam. Seeing no other option, Hiccup agrees to have one Dragon Race. As Hiccup points out the starting location of the race, Snotlout and the Twins suggest they should have teams. Snotlout says the teams are already decided, with Snotlout and the twins on one team and Astrid, Hiccup and Fishlegs on the other. The twins then mention their team name, 'Snotnuts'. Hiccup and Astrid then go to get Fishlegs, but after mocking the name 'Snotnuts' he declines joining the race as he and First Mate Meatlug are still too busy getting ready for the Regatta, refusing to back down on his family tradition.\nThe race starts as Gothi drops the flag signalling the start of the race. They all immediately set off, and a Viking signals Sven to release the sheep. Early in the race, Hiccup manages to get one sheep but the Twins manage to get two. Meanwhile, Astrid and Snotlout both spot one sheep and race head on to get it first, and both of them are relentless to turn around only until Snotlout backs off, fearing collision, allowing Astrid to get the sheep. Late in the race the scores are tallied and the teams are all tied up. As soon as it is stated by Mulch, the Riders head of to get the black sheep as it is the tiebreaker. Both Hiccup and the Twins fail to capture the sheep, and shortly after Astrid and Snotlout spot the black sheep creating another head on race. Just as the two Riders are seconds away from the black sheep, it faints, unexpectedly becoming a static target.\nShortly thereafter, Astrid and Snotlout collide as neither of them backed out, and this causes Astrid's arm to be injured. Snotlout flies off to go get Gothi, but he is still thinking about the game and he grabs the black sheep. Snotlout then runs into a branch and is knocked off Hookfang; the sheep safely lands on top of him. Sometime later at the Great Hall, the uneventful Dragon Race causes the villagers to demand another Dragon Race, but Hiccup tells the villagers the deal was only one Dragon Race and then on to the Regatta. The villagers however are unsatisfied with that and continue to shout for another Dragon Race. Suddenly Snotlout announces that Hiccup is right, but mocks him by saying that it's not like he will beat team Snotnuts anyway.\nAstrid wants to back up Hiccup, but she is still injured and cannot take the risk. Snotlout points out that there's no rematch anyway as Hiccup has no teammate, but Hiccup is still determined to continue the Race, so he once again asks Fishlegs to join his team. At first Fishlegs refuses as he is putting the finishing touches on his ship. After he unveils the small ship with a flourish, Toothless can't help but laugh at the decorations. Fishlegs slowly sails out to sea with Meatlug, but Meatlug quickly begins to feel sea sick and vomits lava, causing the ship to immediately sink. Fishlegs quickly changes his mind about accepting the offer.\nThey both head off to the Academy where the competition is about to start. Just as the flag is about to be dropped, Stoick is suddenly heard screaming Hiccup's name: he has returned earlier than expected. Stoick appears to be in shock to see that this is not the Regatta he'd expected. Hiccup explains that he sometimes has to make difficult choices for the good of the people, and one of those difficult choices is replacing the traditional Regatta event with Dragon Racing. Stoick asks if he did this all by himself, and Hiccup, seeing the other riders awkwardly looking away, has no choice but to agree. Instead of punishing Hiccup for contradicting his order, Stoick allows him to proceed with the event but only if they do it right. Both teams put on face paint, with green paint for team Snotnuts, and red paint for team 'Hicclegs' (which Fishlegs came up with). Stoick explains that it gives the competitors and the game a warrior's feel to it.\nStoick announces to the crowd around the academy the start of the first annual Berk Dragon Race and explains that each white sheep is worth one point, while the Black Sheep is worth five. To make sure no cheating happens (looking particularly at the twins), Stoick appoints Astrid as the referee. Stoick then proclaims that the team who wins the race will have their portrait hung in the Great Hall, and a feast thrown in their honor. Gothi drops the flag and the race is started.\nSnotlout quickly manages to grab one sheep, while Hiccup grabs one as well, and the Twins grab two and boast about it to Hiccup. But Fishlegs arrives bringing two sheep. Both teams drop off their sheep at the Academy. Hiccup spots a sheep placed on a raft out on the water, but Snotlout arrives to grab it. Hiccup quickly sets Toothless' tail to boost their speed and is able to snatch the sheep before Snotlout does. Meanwhile, the twins attempt to cheat by stealing sheep that are not Silent Sven's to quickly double their points, but Astrid arrives before they can grab any. Tuffnut protests that \"not cheating is not trying\"; Astrid has Stormfly drive them off.\nMeanwhile, Fishlegs and Hiccup spot a sheep on a mountain and Fishlegs attempts to grab it, but it jumps down causing it to slide down the side. It falls into a crevasse, but luckily Hiccup and Toothless were already there to rescue it. When it is proclaimed by Astrid that the teams are all tied up, Stoick announces that whoever finds the black sheep wins. The Twins quietly talk to each other about putting their 'Super Secret Plan' into action. Fishlegs then has an idea where the black sheep might be, recalling what Sven said earlier about the black sheep always falling into the well. Fishlegs volunteers to go down the well and look for it, while Hiccup waits overhead. The Twins then fly by with the black sheep which shocks Hiccup.\nThis causes team Snotnuts to win the race, and Snotlout cheers excitedly over his teams' victory. Although disappointed, Hiccup applauds with the crowd. Hiccup congratulates Snotlout, who gloats about it and mocks Hiccup. But just as they are about to take their victory, Fishlegs arrives with the real black sheep, confusing everybody. Sven tells Stoick that there is only one black sheep and Team Snotnuts claims that they have it. Tuffnut then nuzzles the sheep's side with his face and reveals that they had cheated, by painting a regular sheep with black paint. A reversal is announced by Astrid, swapping the victory from Team Snotnuts to Team Hiclegs, making them the first official champions in Dragon Racing. The event closes when Toothless shoots three plasma blasts overhead, dazzling the crowd. Then Stoick finally relieves Hiccup from being the 'acting chief' and Hiccup quickly sets off before his father can change his mind.\nThe flashback ends and it goes back to the present time, with Hiccup concluding that it technically was Tuffnut who invented Dragon Racing (because he was the one came up with the concepts of the rules) humiliating the three of them, especially Snotlout, who is deeply depressed. Hiccup tries to cheer up Snotlout by saying that he played a part in it, and that the cheating was all him. As Snotlout happily claims that he did cheat, the Twins interrupt that Snotlout actually did not know what they were doing, and knew nothing about the secret plan. When Hiccup just tells them that they should say that they all invented Dragon Racing the Twins reluctantly accept, but Tuffnut still claims that Snotlout did nothing. Furious, Snotlout launches a sheep at Tuffnut, and points out that at least he invented the Sheep Launcher. Then a horn is heard, signalling that it is time for the Dragon Race and all the Riders quickly set off to start.\nHaving gone from being Dragon Riders to Dragon Racers, thanks to them a new generation of Berk's traditional events was born.", "tmdb_id": 298115}, "36023964": {"title": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes", "plot": "Years after the global pandemic of a deadly Simian Flu, the worldwide human population is drastically reduced, with only about one in 500 genetically immune. This causes societal collapse among humans. The apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco.\nA group of humans, led by a man named Malcolm, trespass the apes' territory, in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to San Francisco. An encounter with the apes, ends with a man named Carver badly hurting the ape Ash. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar, the apes' leader, orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo, Caesar brings his army to the humans' community as a display of strength. Caesar announces to the community that, despite the apes not wanting war, he will fight the humans if he is forced to. He demands the humans to stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest, reconcile with the apes and access the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and his son Alexander bond with the apes. The fragile relationship briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but it is greatly restored when Ellie, a nurse, effectively treats Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness.\nDreyfus arms his community with the Fort Point armory. Koba, who has a vendetta against humans for his mistreatment as a laboratory test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of loving humans more than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory, kills two guards, and secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the apes' home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into an underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. While refusing orders to kill unarmed humans, Ash cites Caesar's teachings, and Koba throws him to his death. He also has any other ape who is loyal to Caesar imprisoned, including Maurice, Luca, and Rocket.\nMalcolm's family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former house in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesar's son. Blue Eyes spares him before learning that his father is still alive and accompanies Malcolm to Caesar's place. After learning that it was Koba who shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reconciles with his father, returns to the tower and frees every human and ape imprisoned there. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus. Apparently, the return of electricity allowed Dreyfus' men to make radio contact with survivors from a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes. Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus, in a suicide mission, detonates bombs that destabilize the building in a failed attempt to kill the apes. Willing to shoot at the apes that want to help Caesar, Koba eventually loses. While clinging to a metal girder, he is disowned as an ape by Caesar and dropped to his death.\nMalcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military. Caesar responds \"War has already begun\" because of Koba's violent reign. Believing that the humans will never forgive the apes for their attack, Caesar convinces Malcolm to leave with his family before the fighting begins.

As Hongi suspected, the visit is a ruse, and Wirepa desecrates the grave site as a pretext for war, blaming Hongi for disturbing the remains. Tane believes his son is innocent, but offers to kill Hongi if it will prevent war. Wirepa refuses, saying war is imminent. Wirepa's tribe returns later in force, kills the men of the tribe and beheads Tane, taking his head as a trophy. Hongi is knocked away from the battle, and survives.\nHongi leaves and attempts to track down Wirepa. On the way, he discovers that Wirepa and his men have entered the Dead Lands, an area where any who venture in are believed to be killed by a monster known as a Taniwha in Maori mythology. Hongi, suspecting that the monster is in fact a man, tracks him down and, although reluctant, the monster agrees to help Hongi hunt down Wirepa. The monster is in fact a warrior (who is never named in the film) who murdered all the men of his own tribe, and he kills anyone who ventures there to prevent his tribe's historic lands from being occupied. The warrior is motivated by a desire to redeem himself and thus be led to the afterlife by his vengeful ancestors.\nWhile tracking down Wirepa, Hongi has a series of visions of his long dead grandmother, who helps them on their way.

While Hongi battles Wirepa, the warrior is severely wounded but manages to return and save Hongi. Wirepa, distracted from his battle with Hongi, beats the warrior to the ground before returning his attention to Hongi. This time Hongi gains the upper hand, and is about to kill Wirepa. This pleases Wirepa, because it will allow him to be remembered as a great warrior who died in battle about whom songs will be sung, and stories will be told. Hongi denies Wirepa this honor, spares his life and makes him swear to leave his land, and allows him to leave. Defeated and alone, Wirepa walks off in shame.\nHongi returns to the warrior, who is mortally wounded.

In the meantime, they ask Martin to find out what Herzog wants.\nAt a World War II museum, Martin meets Glenn Kenneth, the souvenir shop's clerk. After the zombie arm intimidates him, Glenn takes Martin to the museum, where they read about Herzog's history: Herzog was originally tasked by Hitler himself to wipe out Talvik for their anti-Nazi sabotage.

Martin points out that they have evacuated the townspeople and thus prevented Herzog from completing his orders, but Herzog does not care and attacks them.\nThe battle goes well at first, but the Nazi zombies eventually overpower Martin's Russian zombies after Herzog kills the Russian Commander, Lt Stavarin.

During the police chase, they get separated; Babban escapes, Khalujaan is injured, and the necklace seemingly lost. Babban goes to meet his boss Mushtaq Bhai (Salman Shahid), who disbelieves him, accuses him of double-crossing his boss in cahoots with his uncle Khaalujaan, gives him a death sentence, and orders him to dig his own grave. Babban duly begins to dig a grave under supervision, but manages to escape, with the promise that he will bring back both the necklace and Khaalujaan.\nMonths later, Babban comes across Khalujaan, who is posing as a Nawab and attending a poetry contest. It is a mushaira (gathering of poets) organised by Begum Para (Madhuri Dixit), the widowed Begum of Majidabad, supposedly in compliance with the wishes of her deceased husband. The winner of the poetry contest will not only win the widowed Begum as his bride, and also become the Nawab of Majidabad.\nBabban confronts Khalujaan on the opening night of the contest, and tries to get him to return with him. However, Babban himself delays departure after falling in love at first sight with Muniya (Huma Qureshi), Begum Para's beautiful maid and constant companion. Meanwhile, Khalujaan has his task cut out. He needs to fool the gathering into accepting him as an aristocrat of high lineage, win the poetry contest if possible, and seduce the Begum whether or not that happens. One of the other contestants is a local politician and gangster named Jaan Mohammed (Vijay Raaz), who is holding the poet Nawab Italwi (Manoj Pahwa) in captivity, forcing him to write poetry for Jaan to recite at the contest. The contest proceeds; while Khalujaan has his heart set on Begum Para herself, Babban is smitten with Muniya. Khalujaan tries to impress the Begum by gifting her the prized necklace which he had stolen earlier, but on the final day, Begum declares Jaan Mohammed to be the victor. She declares that she will marry Jaan Mohammad and that he will become the new Nawab of Majidabad.\nSince the necklace has clearly failed to move the Begum, Khaalujaan decides to see if a gun will serve the purpose better. However, even as he approaches the Begum brandishing his chosen instrument of persuasion, he finds the dowager being hustled away at gunpoint by a masked man. Khalujaan chases them and blocks their way only to discover that the masked man is none other than his nephew Babban. It turns out that the Begum had plotted her own kidnapping in order to extort money from the nawab-elect (Jaan Mohammad). More twists are then revealed: the Begum was nothing but a dancing-girl (courtesan) who had seduced a middle-aged nawab and married him, only to find that the nawab was actually a pauper who supported his lavish way of life by selling his inherited properties and jewels. He also neglected his wife, who (it is very strongly suggested) developed a relationship of intimacy with a sympathetic maid-servant, Muniya.\nBy the time the nawab died of good living, he had become completely bankrupt and even his palace had been mortgaged to the money-lenders. After his death, the penniless Begum had been helped financially and courted actively by Jaan Mohammad, who was besotted with her. He also wanted the title and status of being the \"Nawab of Majidabad.\" If a mere dancing-girl could marry an aging nawab and swan around being feted and fawned over as Begum of Majidabad, then Jaan Mohammad, of a similar social background, could likewise climb into the same status by marrying the same girl, now a dowager. The Begum was appalled by this idea. Jaan Mohammad is a man of low birth and uncultured mannerisms, a former street-thug turned politician, with an entourage of sycophantic hoodlums. The idea of marrying such a man was repellent to the Begum, who was anyway in love with her maid-servant. Yet, Jaan Mohammad's debt and his persistence leave the Begum with no choice but to announce a competition for her suitors, as a tactic to delay responding to Jaan's advances.\nThus, the mushiara was conceived of an elaborate hoax: the late Nawab had never wanted that his widow should marry someone else, much less that the winner should be recognized as \"Nawab of Majidabad.\" It was the Begum's own idea, the purpose being to snare a rich man and marry him. The Begum did not want to marry Jaan Mohammad, but she wanted his money, therefore she was staging a kidnapping in order to receive a ransom from Jaan Mohammad. She has employed Babban to act as her kidnapper and extort a hefty ransom from Jaan Mohammad, who was expected to pay up because otherwise he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a Nawab.\nBabban duly phones Jaan Mohammed (who is by now aware of the Begum's cunning plan) to bring a ransom of Rs. 100 million (100 million rupees, about $2 million in 2014) in cash to the railway station. All four of them (Begum, maid, and the uncle-nephew duo) reach the railway station to collect the money, but find that they are surrounded by Jaan Mohammad's goons. To their good fortune, Nawab Italwi arrives with a police force and cross-firing ensues. Begum and Muniya escape from the situation, leaving Babban and Khalujaan behind to be arrested.\nTwo months later, the uncle-nephew duo get bail and, as they leave the jail, they are given a letter from Begum and Muniya. It is a cheeky letter of thanks and goodbye from the women, informing the men that they have sold the priceless necklace and used the proceeds to buy a house and settle down in a faraway town whose name they withhold.

The couple later attend their first ultrasound scan where the doctor says that the baby looks healthy and Sam is due by the end of March. At that moment, the ultrasound screen goes static but recovers after a moment.\nThroughout the course of her pregnancy, Sam begins to experience nosebleeds, stomach bruising, cravings for raw meat (despite being a vegetarian), superhuman strength, telekinetic abilities and unexplained feelings of rage whenever she or the baby appear to be threatened. Also, Zach and Sam keep seeing odd-looking people watching them from afar. Sam becomes convinced something is seriously wrong with the baby and that they are being watched. After a second visit to the doctor, a new doctor (Robert Aberdeen) appears and performs an amnio after Sam appears nauseous. He has no answer as to the whereabouts of their original doctor and the couple is suspicious.\nBefore the couple return home, masked men set up hidden cameras inside their home to monitor her progress and make sure she does not hurt the baby.\nWhen Sam is eight months pregnant, the couple attend a holy communion at their church. Their usually friendly niece (Madison Wolfe) is oddly scared of Sam now, and the priest (Sam Anderson) who officiated Zach and Sam's wedding looks at Sam during the service and violently coughs up blood. Later at home, when Zach is reviewing the communion footage he filmed, he sees the mysterious cab driver from their honeymoon sitting in a pew. He visits the priest in the hospital, who explains the symbol is related to summoning the Antichrist. He warns Zach that the symbol is the gateway for the Antichrist, and that the followers of the cult will dress the house in ash to prepare for the arrival. After he finds ash all over his house (and the cops will not do anything), Zach chases the people watching their house and finds out where they are living. He asks his sister Suzie to stay with Sam while he breaks into the supposedly abandoned house at the end of his street where the cult is staying, and there he finds the CCTV footage of his house and the missing ultrasound. He is almost caught by the cult when he goes to leave. Performing the ritual with the other cult members is the McCall's mysterious second doctor, as well as the man who has been watching their house and the cult leader (who they initially saw at the fortune teller's place and later at the club). Zach barely manages to escape.\nMeanwhile, Suzie goes to check Sam, only to find that she is drawing the cult symbol before being attacked by an unseen force.\nUpon returning home, Zach finds the house surrounded by the masked men who have been watching them all along. Inside, he finds Suzie dead and hears Sam scream as the house is being destroyed by some unseen force. He finds Sam in the baby's nursery standing in a trance-like state with a knife to her stomach (the knife was a mysterious gift at her baby shower). She is standing atop the cult symbol that she has carved into the floor. Zach screams for her to stop, but she presses the knife to her stomach anyway and there is a violent blast of light. When Zach recovers, he finds Sam lying in her own blood with her stomach cut. Sam cries and wonders if the baby is all right before dying in his arms. Zach breaks down in grief before the cab driver and the second doctor arrive. Zach begs the intruders to leave them alone, but the doctor takes the baby regardless. The baby glows a deep red as he takes it from Sam's body. The cult takes his camera and tapes, removing all evidence. Zach is arrested and interrogated by the police about the death of his wife and sister, and disappearance of his child, crimes for which he looks guilty.\nBefore the credits, the screen shows another young couple, on their honeymoon in Paris, where the same cab driver offers them a lift, hinting that the events are about to repeat all over again.", "tmdb_id": 79316}, "44142534": {"title": "The Devil's Hand (2014 film)", "plot": "In a close-knit Amish community, a prophecy appears to come true when six girls are born on June 6.

Tris visits Caleb, who tells her that Erudite plans to overthrow Abnegation. When she returns, Al, Peter, and their fellow Candor transfer Drew attack her before Four rescues her. The next day, Al begs Tris to forgive him but she refuses and calls him a coward. He later kills himself by jumping into \"The Chasm,\" rather than live with the shame.\nTo prepare her for the final test, Four takes Tris into his own fear simulations, where she learns he is Tobias Eaton, and his father Marcus used to beat him as a child. Tris then passes her test and officially joins Dauntless. The other Dauntless are injected with a serum from Erudite, supposedly for tracking but actually for mind control. The next morning, the Dauntless prepare to execute Abnegation under Erudite's orders. As the new serum fails on Divergents, Tris must blend in to avoid suspicion. She finds Four, who identifies as Divergent. When the Dauntless move to raid Abnegation, the pair separate from the group and attempt to locate her parents, but Eric, realizing Four is not under control, captures both of them, taking Four into custody and ordering Tris's execution. Her mother Natalie appears and saves her but is shot and killed as they attempt escape.\nTris finds her father hiding with Caleb, Marcus, and several Abnegation members. The group sneaks into Dauntless headquarters, where Tris encounters Peter and forces him to lead them to Erudite's control center. Her father sacrifices himself in a shootout, and Tris goes in alone to find Four, now under stronger mind control designed for Divergents. Knowing his fears, she manages to wake him from the mind control, and both enter the central control room, where Erudite's leader Jeanine Matthews nearly has Dauntless execute the entire Abnegation faction.

However, Winter's behavior has become unpredictable, even dangerous; when Sawyer tries to get her out of the tank to prepare to make her a new prosthetic tail, she becomes aggressive and knocks him into the water, injuring him. Dr. Clay prohibits Sawyer from swimming with Winter until further notice. Winter spends weeks in isolation, and despite people not being allowed to visit her, Sawyer allows Susie, a new volunteer, and her grandfather to see her.

Mandy's rehabilitation at CMA goes well, so Clay contemplates releasing her soon, causing alarm for Hazel in particular. Lorraine advises Hazel that no one spends any more time at a hospital than they need to and encourages her to talk with her father. Hazel assertively yet respectfully asks Clay to let her view Mandy's medical records, which he does. Clay, Sawyer, and Hazel test Mandy's readiness by giving her three live fish, which she catches effortlessly, so they reluctantly decide they must release her. Clay puts Hazel in charge of her release.\nSawyer and Hazel break the rules and swim with Winter, who appears to be feeling better.

As a child, he was a royal ward in the palace of the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and was trained to be a soldier in the Sultan's elite Janissary corps, where he became their most feared warrior. He was called \"Vlad the Impaler, Son of the Dragon\", after slaughtering thousands by impaling them on spears, but became sickened by his own acts and abandoned his past.\nNow ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's retinue. Vlad barely escapes and returns to his castle, where he learns from a local monk that the creature is a vampire, a Roman from the days of the Empire named Caligula, who was tricked by a demon for personal success and great powers, but was trapped in the cave as the price for this. Vlad celebrates an Easter feast with his wife Mirena and son \u00cengera\u0219, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle. Vlad offers them the usual tribute payment of silver coins, but the emissary wants an additional tribute of 1,000 boys to be trained as Janissaries. Vlad refuses. Mirena believes Vlad can convince Sultan Mehmed II to show mercy. Vlad offers himself in place of the boys; but Mehmed refuses and demands Vlad's son in addition.\nKnowing war is coming, Vlad returns to the Broken Tooth Mountain cave to seek help from the vampire. The vampire tells him there are consequences and offers him some of his blood, which will temporarily give Vlad the powers of a vampire. If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken by having given the darkness a worthy offering to plague the world like himself. Vlad accepts the offer. He discovers that he has the ability to transform into a cloud of bats. When he returns to Castle Dracula, the Ottoman army attacks, but Vlad single-handedly kills them all.

Vlad commands an enormous swarm of bats to repel them; however, the soldiers are actually a decoy force, allowing a handful of Turks to infiltrate the monastery, kill many of the inhabitants and kidnap \u00cengera\u0219.

Vlad reluctantly drinks her blood, triggering his final transformation into a full-blooded vampire and granting him even greater powers, and in doing so he frees the ancient vampire from his cave by breaking the magical seal imprisoning him.

Vlad returns to the monastery and turns the small group of survivors and mortally wounded into vampires as well.\nAt the Ottoman army's camp, Mehmed prepares for a massive invasion of Europe.

Alteria is a land divided among humans, elves, goblinoids (called \"beasts\"), and dragons. Decades ago, the elves and humans drove the beasts and dragons back into the Dark Mountains. However, with the beasts vanquished, the humans and elves eventually came into conflict with each other, thereby remaining unaware that evil begins to thrive and gain strength again within the Dark Mountains, all centered on a gem of power embedded in the chest of the sleeping Black Dragon Karas, under whose influence the beasts have united into an army.\nA cocky, adventurous human boy named Lambert and his dogs One and Two have a run-in with a large beast band on a raid. Just before they end up killed, they are saved by a trio of famous adventurers: Barnac, a famous mercenary and captain of a flying ship; Geraint, a famous dragon fighter; and Argenta, Geraint's sister. They proceed to the human kingdom of Saint Heaven, to which two Elven maidens, Princess Nerwin and her companion Liya, have secretly travelled to beseech the king for an alliance against the beasts. While trying to get himself a sword, Lambert encounters Liya and ends teaming up with her and his heroic companions against a band of beasts attacking the city, holding them off until the Imperial Knights under Velskud can bring the situation under control. With evidence of the new threat on his literal doorstep, the terrified king finally agrees to the alliance.\nWhile the newly-found allies gather their forces, Liya spots a shadow near the king's dining hall and follows it, accompanied by Lambert. There, they sneak into a meeting between the king, Terramai (his priest and advisor), Karacule (a sorceress), Nerwin, Barnac, Geraint, Argenta, and Velskud discussing the threat of Karas and the gem forming both his base of power and his most vulnerable spot. An argument over who should assume custody of the gem breaks out until Lambert interrupts them with a plan for a combined diversionary attack and infiltration, upon which - although the plan is accepted - he and Liya are kicked out. However, by listening in they learn that the gem's dark power corrupts those of weak heart and will therefore have to be destroyed.\nLater that night, Velskud is joined by Princess Elena, a Dark Elf who desires the gem for herself and the infiltrator Liya saw earlier. Velskud, seduced by Elena's promises to be made ruler of all Alteria, kills the king before joining the other heroes for the secret mission. Lambert, who also comes along with Liya, receives a sword from an old blacksmith in return for holding onto One and Two until his return. Under the cover of darkness, they travel to the Dark Mountains on Barnac's ship. Lightning strikes the ship, and while Lambert tries to retrieve his sword which has slipped from his hand, he accidentally disables the ship's wheel. The ship crashes, and the group is forced to continue the journey on foot.\nAlong the way, the companions reach a set of ruins which were the site of a battle between the elves and humans and are still haunted by the ghosts of the fallen elves. Forced to cross them following one of Lambert's mishaps, they are discovered and taunted by a bat scout serving the Black Dragon. When Velskud attacks it, it tries to slip away to the Dark Mountains before the heroes manage to kill it. As the journey continues, Lambert and Liya develop a romantic interest in each other, and Geraint and Argenta are shown to hide a secret connected to the Dragon's gem. Using this link, Geraint finds and unseals a secret entrance to the Dragon's lair in the wall of a glacier, but while traversing the ice ravine beyond the door, they are ambushed by Karas' beast guardians. They escape by collapsing the exit, but Geraint and Argenta stay behind, and Geraint uses the power of the gem in his chest to awaken a giant beast frozen in the ice. They escape and reunite with the others.\nThe companions do not make it in time before the Alliance begins its attack, causing Karas to awaken. The beasts fighting against the Alliance retreat but run into Lambert's group. In the ensuing confusion, Liya and Lambert are left behind and forced to fight the monsters by themselves. When Lambert is about to get eaten by a beast, Liya uses her last arrow to save him, sacrificing herself. The others hear Lambert's cries of anguish and race to aid him, but are quickly overrun by the beasts. Geraint uses his secret power to transform into a Golden Dragon and save his companions, but accidentally hurts Karacule in the process. It turns out that he and Argenta are Half-Dragons and therefore bearers of Dragon Gems themselves. The others, seeing Geraint's dragon form, start to distrust the siblings, claiming that dragons need to be killed.\nKaras appears and attacks, and is immediately engaged by Geraint. As they fly above Lambert, he notices the glowing gem on Karas\u2019 chest, and remembering what was said about it - including that it holds the power to raise the dead - he decides to get it for Liya. He jumps onto Karas as he flies past and climbs his way up to the chest. The others join in to dislodge the dark gem, and Argenta transforms into a Silver Dragon to help her brother. By combining their powers, they are eventually able to detach the dark gem from Karas, killing the monster at last.\nLambert demands the gem from Geraint in order to resurrect Liya, but Geraint warns him from touching it, for fear that its power will corrupt him, and instead gives him his own gem. While Lambert runs off to apply the gem on Liya, Velskud seizes Karas' gem; but before he can slay Geraint, Lambert interferes and returns Geraint's gem to its owner. As he and Velskud duel, the dark gem begins to corrupt the knight and transform him into a new Black Dragon. Before the warped knight can kill Lambert, an elven arrow distracts him, allowing Lambert to grab Velskud's own sword and fatally wound his opponent.\nThe arrow was guided by Liya, who has returned from the brink of death, and she and Lambert embrace each other in a kiss. The Alliance army arrives and picks the heroes up for a ride home; but Elena has gained possession of Karas' gem.

As Lake, Milt, and Michelle leave the professor's office building, Aasim sees them. The next day, the three return to the professor's office in hopes of following whomever the professor meets. They watch until the professor comes outside to meet Aasim, but Aasim spots them and runs. While Lake takes the money, drugs, and passport from the professor in order to impersonate him in Kenya, Milt catches Aasim and slits his throat, effectively preventing him from contacting Banir.\nMichelle finds a make-up specialist to help Lake transform into the professor, then Lake and Milt fly to Mombasa. The disguise works, and Lake is driven out of the city to Banir's hideout, and through a ruse and some small hand-to-hand combat, is finally alone with Banir. Lake reveals himself to the terrorist, but at that moment has an attack of dementia-fueled flashbacks, during which the disparity between the young terrorist who maimed Lake twenty-two years earlier and the now aging, fragile, and terminally-ill man is very clear. Without taking any further action, Lake abruptly leaves Banir. The next day, Lake and Milt are strolling around their Mombasan hotel's swimming pool and garden, which is full of people, when a shot rings out and a young Kenyan passing Lake suddenly drops. Lake sees that Milt has been hit, too (not fatally), and returns fire to the gunmen, ultimately killing both and being shot twice himself. Understanding that Banir has sent them, he takes their vehicle, driving into the night back to Banir's hideout, where he engages in a short (and prone) knife fight with Banir before killing him.  But as he returns to Mombasa, he is still losing blood, and the flashbacks and voices return. Lake appears to drive head-on into a truck. The closing moments of the film move (with a voice-over by Lake) to Arlington National Cemetery, where a tombstone bearing Lake's name is shown; to Langley; to  a voice-over of Lake giving a speech (from early in the film); and to Milt giving Michelle a memento of Lake's that is important to her.", "tmdb_id": 297596}, "41366275": {"title": "Earth to Echo", "plot": "Three childhood friends, Alex, Tuck, and Munch, live in a small Nevada neighborhood that will soon be demolished for a highway construction project.

They take the object with them as they follow another map to a nearby barn, where the object telekinetically repairs itself using various objects around the barn. The boys discover the object contains a cybernetic alien that can answer yes or no questions. The alien reveals that it is from another planet and has accidentally crash landed on Earth after being shot down, and is seriously injured as a result. The group follows another map to a pawn shop, where the object further repairs itself, allowing the alien to reveal itself. With its eyes damaged, it uses Alex's phone camera to see. As they leave the pawn shop, they decide to name the alien Echo.\nThey follow another map to the house of Emma, a classmate of the boys, who discovers Echo and joins their group. They follow another map to an arcade, where Alex is caught by a security guard. Emma goes back in to rescue him, while Echo and Munch cause a distraction. After rescuing Alex, the four stop at a restaurant, keeping Echo hidden in a backpack, but a construction worker steals the backpack and loads it into a truck. Munch jumps into the back of the truck as it pulls away, leaving the rest of the group behind. To catch up to them, Alex and Emma help Tuck steal his brother's car, which they drive to the construction site Munch and Echo are being held at.\nThe three try to get in, but are stopped by the same construction worker, who reveals himself as Dr. Lawrence Masden, a scientist who intends to keep Echo on Earth so that he can study its technology. Masden's group, implied to be government agents, are also revealed as the group that shot Echo down in the first place. Masden tries to convince the group that if Echo repairs the spaceship and takes off in it, it will kill everyone in the neighborhood; the kids pretend to be convinced, and promise to help Masden find the spaceship if he takes them to Munch and Echo. Masden brings the three to a scrap junkyard, where Echo seemingly dies as a result of the violent experimentation inflicted on him, but with encouragement from the kids, he revives, completes his repairs, and distracts the agents long enough for the kids to drive back home. At Alex's house, the spaceship key goes into the ground by itself, and they realize the agents invented the false construction project as a cover to dig up the neighborhood, as the entire ship is in the ground beneath it.\nTrusting Echo, Alex takes him down the hole made by the key. At the bottom, the group finds a room that turns out to be the spaceship's core, where the key connects to the rest of it. Once the key is connected to the core, allowing Echo to use it to pilot the ship, he begins starting up the ship. After they all say goodbye and the kids exit the core, the ship's separate parts telekinetically come out of the ground all over the neighborhood, and reassemble it in mid-air, and all without destroying the neighborhood. Once fully reassembled, the ship then flies away. The project put on by the agents is abandoned but Alex and Munch relocate anyway, as their families have already bought new homes elsewhere.

In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham orders recently attached public affairs officer Major William \"Bill\" Cage to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham if the invasion fails. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to Heathrow Airport, now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a private and falsely labelled him a deserter. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, all of whom dislike and belittle him.\nOn the morning of the invasion, Farell and J-Squad are quickly killed by the Mimics who were somehow aware of their planned invasion and ambushed them.

He explains that the Mimics are a superorganism in which the \"Omega\" controls the cerebrum, while the \"Alphas\" behave as the ganglia through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; if an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and adjusts its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently \"hijacked\" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood.

Porfiry interviews Mancini, and learns that Rey was once instituted in an asylum.\nBack at the studio, Cesare is murdered in the shower and his fingers are severed. With Cesare dead, Francesco instructs Rey to re-cut the film to make Cal the new star.

When his wife was fired by Mancini on her next film, the pressures of editing Fantori's next project, the world's longest film, mounted and Rey accidentally cut off his own fingers in a fit of madness. What Rey doesn't tell him is that he's found what appears to be footage of the murders, taken by an unknown third party.

By the time Alice realized she was pregnant it was too late for her mother to force her to get an abortion, so instead she forced her into relinquishing the child for adoption. According to Helen, Alice remained fixated on her child, obsessing over it endlessly. In an attempt to placate Alice, Helen lied to her, saying that she had seen her child living with a family in a nice part of town. She said that the girl had beautiful curly hair, and had a heart shaped birthmark on her back. However, unknown to Helen, upon being released from prison, Alice reconnected with Rodrigo, the janitor who had previously impregnated her. Alice\u2019s supposedly aimless \"walking\" had actually been her combing the town, searching for her child. Upon seeing Brittany in the furniture store Alice took her and found that she had a heart-shaped birthmark on her back. Believing Brittany to be her child, Alice took her with the help of Rodrigo, who then took the child to stay at his mother\u2019s house. Their plan was to keep Brittany there while Alice framed Ronnie for the crime, after which they would go be with their child. After being shown birth certificates that proved Brittany was not her child, Alice was convinced by Porter to take her to Rodrigo's mother's house, where Porter collects Brittany. This is intercut with Ronnie at home in her bathroom, where still overwhelmed by guilt over the original kidnapping and murder, she commits suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Porter returns Brittany safely to her grateful and tearful parents.\nIt is revealed shortly after that Alice made a deal with the district attorney, and that all charges against her have been dropped while Rodrigo is arrested for the kidnapping and statutory rape. Porter and Jones watch in disgust and Alice revels in the media attention, and gives the speech she practiced about being an innocent victim of the justice system for the news cameras. Finally, the details of the ending of the first kidnapping are revealed. It shows Ronnie worrying about the baby, and begging Alice to let her take the baby back. Alice is then shown manipulating and forcing Ronnie into strangling the baby, running away as Ronnie does it. Horrified, Ronnie goes to Helen and confesses what has happened. Helen says that she can make sure that Alice is punished equally along with Ronnie, and we discover that it was Helen who gave Ronnie Alice's jack in the box, telling her to plant it at the scene of the crime. Finally, in the last scene we are again shown the porch on the day of the original kidnapping, except this time Alice is shown standing over the baby carriage instead of Ronnie.", "tmdb_id": 258284}, "46709144": {"title": "L'Ex de ma vie", "plot": "Ariane, a young French violinist, agrees inflamed marriage proposal Christen, an irresistible conductor.

Ava has already passed a simple Turing test and Nathan wants Caleb to judge whether Ava is genuinely capable of thought and consciousness, and whether he can relate to Ava despite knowing she is artificial.\nAva has a robotic body with the physical form and face of a woman and is confined to her apartment. During their talks, Caleb grows close to her, and she expresses a desire to experience the world outside and a romantic interest in him, which Caleb comes to return.

She tells the two men of the prophecy, in which \"a leader\" (either Moses or Ramesses) will be \"saved\" and the savior \"will someday lead.\" During the battle, Moses saves Ramesses's life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses volunteers to go to the city of Pithom in place of his cousin to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave Joshua being lashed and questions the vicious lashing. Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions the slaves must toil in. Moses meets with the slave elders to see if the slaves are planning on sedition as claimed by the Viceroy. After said meetings, Moses receives a message via Joshua that Nun is looking for him. Moses finds Nun in the prayer house where he informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister Miriam to be raised by Pharaoh's daughter (he was born during the extermination of the Jewish heirs). Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily; during which he is attacked by two guards whom he quickly kills. However, two Hebrew spies overhear Nun's story and report their discovery to the Viceroy.\nMoses returns home where soon after Seti dies, and Ramesses becomes the new Pharaoh (Ramesses II). Hegep, the viceroy reveals Moses's true lineage to Ramesses, but Ramesses is unconvinced. At the urging of Queen Tuya, he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses's sister.

Although Tuya wants Moses killed, Ramesses, still unwilling to believe the story, exiles him instead. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of Moshe.

In Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother Aaron for the first time. Moses confronts Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that freeing them is economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses's life, Ramesses orders Moses's death, as well as killing random Hebrew families until Moses is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves and leads them in an insurgency, prompting Ramesses to retaliate harshly. God's messenger appears to Moses and explains that ten plagues will affect Egypt. The first nine plagues deal massive damage to Egypt and its people, but Ramesses does not back down, even oppressing his own people to maintain his position. Moses is horrified to learn from God that the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children but follows through with the plan, instructing the Hebrews to protect themselves by covering their doors with lambs' blood. That night, all of Egypt's firstborn children die, including Ramesses's infant son.

Realizing that Foop plans to cause mischief for Timmy and destroy Fairy World, Crocker agrees to help him in acquiring the Abracadabraium.\nAfter returning the check to his father and giving back the gas cure to Tootie to save both their jobs, Timmy decides to relax with her and his fairies on the beach. While doing so, he and Tootie run into Marty and Mitzy, who had run away from Vicky after she had mistreated them on their vacation and help them escape from her so that they can have some fun. But while relaxing, Crocker, who is given the money for the fire dance by Mr. Turner, and Foop, having taken on human form, successfully distract the pair and steal the bag carrying the Abracadabraium from Timmy, soon putting Fairy World in danger, and weakening Cosmo, Wanda and Poof. Realizing he has been duped, Timmy is soon spotted by Jorgen who becomes furious he lost the Abracadaraium; his anger changes his skin, causing him to lose in the Bronze Biceps contest. Seeking to get the Abracadabrium back, the pair and the fairies recruit Marty and Mitzy to help and soon discover that Foop plans to drop it into a lava pool within a volcano. Arriving to stop him, the group discovers that Crocker, who was planning to drop it, became affected by it, turning good and refusing to do as Foop wants. Angered, Foop risks touching the substance to destroy it, leading to Timmy struggling with him to get it back and falling into the lava with it. Much to the surprise of the others, Timmy survives and becomes a fairy (his appearance that of his cartoon self in his youth without the buck teeth) after absorbing some of the powers of the Abracadabraium. A defiant Foop swears revenge but is soon sent away by Poof, while Crocker soon returns to his normal self.\nWith Timmy now a fairy, Jorgen reassigns Cosmo, Wanda and Poof to Marty and Mitzy, who he states deserve them, all while leaving them close by for Timmy to see them. Timmy soon uses his fairy powers to save his father's job by creating a fire dance for him with Crocker in it, after learning he took the money for it. While Marty and Mitzy take delight in having fairies, turning Vicky into a rabbit, Tootie declares she will need time to get used to Timmy as a fairy, before dancing with him. The stage sets off fireworks and Poof sends off the audience with an \"Aloha!\".\nIn the epilogue, Foop gets sent down the drain, which he describes as the \"unspeakable horror\".", "tmdb_id": 282728}, "43944557": {"title": "Falcon Rising", "plot": "John \"Falcon\" Chapman is a United States Marine Corps veteran who suffers from posttraumatic stress disorder. After playing Russian roulette, he enters a convenience store moments before it is robbed. He demands one of the robbers shoot him, and when the man hesitates, Chapman grows impatient, disarms the robbers, and foils the robbery. When he meets with his sister Cindy, who has briefly returned to New York for a wedding, she chastises him for not taking his medication and explains that she is returning to Brazil, where she has been doing charity work for a non-profit organization. Chapman receives word from Manny Ridley, a fellow veteran and diplomat, that his sister has been severely beaten. Chapman immediately leaves for Brazil.\nChapman meets Thiago Santo and his partner Carlo Bororo, who are investigating his sister's assault. Though no witnesses have come forward, Santo promises justice. Santo and Ridley warn Chapman to avoid the gangster-controlled favelas, but Chapman insists on performing his own investigation. Katarina Da Silva, a beat cop, shows Chapman where his sister was found. When Chapman visits his sister in the hospital, an Asian nurse administers medicine to Cindy's IV. Cindy goes into convulsions, and Chapman calls for help. The hospital says they have no Asian nurses, and Ridley suggests that the yakuza may be involved, as Brazil has a sizeable Japanese immigrant population.\nChapman returns to the favela and beats up several people when he notices one is wearing Cindy's necklace. Da Silva arrives and stops him, explaining that the man is Cindy's friend. Da Silva translates for him, and Chapman learns that Cindy gave her necklace to him after his sister disappeared. The man gives Chapman Cindy's torn journal, which he recovered, and Chapman apologizes. Using carbon paper, Chapman recovers a phone number and contacts another of Cindy's friends, a photographer, who explains that she was investigating corruption and a possible conspiracy involving human trafficking. When the photographer is unwilling to part with proof, Chapman pickpockets it. The photographer dies in a car bomb seconds later.\nAfter engaging in a gun fight with yakuza gangsters, Chapman investigates a nightclub with yakuza ties. There, he beats up a Brazilian smuggler who works for Hirimoto, the yakuza boss. Ridley identifies official documents as fakes and the two realize the yakuza are kidnapping young girls from the favela and forcing them into prostitution. At the same time, Santo organizes a violent raid of the favela, killing many Brazilian drug dealers. When one of his officers stumbles onto a yakuza kidnapping, Santo kills the officer and demands double his pay from the yakuza. Chapman investigates a yakuza brothel, where he is recognized and beats up several gangsters. Santo is called to kill him, but when Da Silva also arrives, Santo is unable to do anything.\nChapman hands over the evidence of smuggling and human trafficking to Santo but becomes suspicious when Santo accidentally reveals knowledge of the operation. On a hunch, Chapman sends Da Silva to protect his sister, and Da Silva kills the same yakuza assassin who previously pretended to be a nurse. Chapman tracks down a meeting between Santo, Bororo, and Hirimoto. After alerting Ridley, Chapman kills several yakuza and confronts the three men at once. Santo goes down first, then Bororo, and finally Hirimoto. As he lies dying, Santo denies involvement with Cindy's near-fatal attack, gives Chapman a key to a locker full of incriminating evidence, and requests a gun to commit suicide; Chapman obliges.

Daru, a French school-teacher goes about his day teaching geography to the Algerian children from nearby villages, playing with them, and giving grain to their families. One of Daru's acquaintances show up to his isolated schoolhouse to warn him about rising tensions between the Algerian resistance and the French regime.\nThe following morning, Balducci, a French gendarme and friend to Daru, brings an Arab prisoner (who we find out is called Mohamed later on) to Daru's schoolhouse. Balducci informs Daru that he must take this prisoner to the nearby town, Tinguit, and hand him over to the police department over there. He claims that he is unable to due to there being a lack of forces to prevent a potential uprising in the town of El Ameur. Daru is displeased with the orders being given to him and outright refuses to comply. Despite Mohamed having killed his cousin over the theft of grain, Daru insists that it is out of the question for him to take the man to the authorities as they will most probably sentence him to death without much deliberation. Balducci, frustrated, tells Daru that French authorities already have an eye on him due to his friendliness with the locals. He then starts his trip back to El Ameur, leaving the prisoner and his fate in the hands of Daru.\nAfter sharing a meal together, Daru sets up a bed for Mohamed, ensuring he is treated like a regular guest. At night, Mohamed falls sick prompting Daru to tend to him. This helps ease the tension and grow trust between the two men. The next morning, Daru is suddenly faced by a group of men in horses demanding he hand over their cousin. The situation quickly escalates and Daru is forced to use a firearm to fend them off. After shooting one of their horses, the men disperse and flee whilst promising revenge. After the situation cools down, Daru heatedly confronts Mohamed, blaming him for the events that had just taken place. Mohamed in turn asks Daru to take him to the authorities in Tinguit, to which Daru responds to by telling him to go by himself. Mohamed reluctantly goes through with this, only to be met by Daru quickly having a change of heart and agreeing to take the trip with him.\nDaru proceeds to pack essentials for the trek but just as they are about to leave, they are met with a group of Frenchmen searching for a man guilty of slaughtering their cattle. When they see Mohamed, they ask Daru if he was the man in question. Daru explains his situation, but the men insist that they can take care of his prisoner and call it a day. After Daru's refusal to leave it to them, one of the Frenchmen gets agitated and threatens Daru with his gun. Daru quickly turns the situation around and holds the man at gunpoint. He expresses his empathy towards him having lost his cattle and then asks them all to leave.\nFinally, after all this trouble, Daru and Mohamed finally embark on their trip to Tinguit. Unfortunately, not much time passes until they spot Mohamed's cousins in the distance searching for them. To avoid any further conflict, they deviate and follow a perilous path through the mountains. Shortly after, they accidentally confront a lone armed man riding a horse. The man is shown to be hesitant to pull the trigger as both parties try to de-escalate the situation. Nevertheless, the man fires the first shot and misses to which Daru is forced to retaliate with a shot to the chest. Daru quickly scrambles to try and resuscitate him but to no avail. Angered and frustrated, Daru calls Mohamed a coward with no honor. Mohamed ignores this and begins to recite prayers in front of the man's body and then buries him with sand. The situation cools down and both men continue their hike through the desert.\nSeveral hours of walking later, a heavy rain settles and the duo rush back to an abandoned village they had passed by earlier to take shelter and stay warm. Once rested and refuged from mother nature, Mohamed explains to Daru why and how he got himself into this mess. He had killed his cousin for stealing grain since this grain was essential to keeping his parents and siblings fed. Had he let it happen, his family would have starved to death. Furthermore, his family was not able to pay the \"blood-money\" to appease their cousins, forcing Mohamed to flee and turn himself in to French authorities. If he were to die at the hands of the French, then his cousins would have nobody to take out their revenge on and neither would Mohamed's siblings seek retribution over their cousins. This was the only solution to Mohamed.\nAfter having spent the night at the abandoned village, the pair are once again met with a group of armed men riding horses. This time, they were part of the Algerian rebellion and were currently on their way to their base camp. They quickly confiscate any arms that Daru and Mohamed were holding and decide to take them as temporary hostages. While held captive at the rebel base camp, Daru takes note of a man who he recognized to have been an old friend from his days in the infantry. After a light-hearted reunion, Slimane, Daru's friend, unties both of the hostages' hands. This cheerful moment is unfortunately short-lived as the rebels receive word that French troops are approaching. Consequently, everybody in the camp packs up and start heading towards a nearby cave in order to hide.\nIn the cave, Slimane explains to Daru how he must decide whether he was with or against the rebellion. Daru, who had no intention to take part in any war, was caught aback by this as he had lived all of his life in Algeria and had no qualms with either side. Slimane nevertheless leaves the decision up to Daru. After this tense exchange, Daru and Mohamed recount their experiences with women before going to sleep. Daru explains to Mohamed how he got married in the city of Algiers but unfortunately lost his wife. On the other hand, Mohamed never had the chance to get married and had never been with a woman.\nThe following morning, the rebels are ambushed by French soldiers just as they leave the cave. The situation intensifies so much that the rebels are forced to flee from a back entrance to the cave. While escaping, most rebels are killed with only a few managing to escape, including Slimane. Daru confronts the French troops and explains that Mohamed and him are mere hostages and are not involved in the uprising. The French lieutenant verifies over radio that Daru was a major in the army with a prisoner assigned to him and promptly releases them. Finally left to their own, Daru and Mohamed continue their walk through the Algerian desert.\nBefore reaching Tinguit, Daru decides to take Mohamed to the town of Berzina where has was born. There, Daru reveals to Mohamed that his parents were actually from Spain and he had in fact no French blood in him. Because of this, Daru had always felt like an outsider in Algeria. He then takes Mohamed to a bar in order to hire an escort for him. The bar owner, who knew Daru when he was young, also hired him an escort. After this stop, the duo continue their trek.\nOnce Tinguit is finally in view, Daru offers Mohamed two choices. The first was to continue forward to Tinguit and hand himself over to the authorities as he had planned. The second was to follow a secondary path that would lead him to a community of nomads willing to take him in. Mohamed deliberates over this for a long time but ultimately chooses the path towards the nomads.

Like the others, she sought treatment from Dr. Andover (Robert Englund), a brilliant scientist and doctor that developed a new way of treating fear-related ailments by way of his \"Fear Chamber\". Initially the treatments seemed to be a success, but years later the patients have all returned to the clinic due to their fears re-emerging worse than they had before. After urging from her best friend Megan (Cleopatra Coleman), Sara returns to the clinic as well. Andover is reluctant to resume treatment because one of his previous patients, Paige (Bonnie Morgan), died as a result of her treatment in the Fear Chamber. He ends up giving in due to both the patients and his assistant Osborn (Felisha Terrell) insistence that this is the only way to solve their problems. However he finds that his reluctance may have been well-founded as one of the patients, Caylee (Angelina Armani), vomits a black substance that gives Andover a strange vision once he touches the fluid. The vision shows a monstrous version of Paige that states that Andover's treatments opened a passage for a sinister being to come over and that all that it needs to finish its travels is for Andover to resume treatment and \"open the door\". Realizing that this is not Paige but the creature itself, he is shocked back to consciousness.\nWhile settling in, a new patient by the name of Blake (Thomas Dekker) arrives in the clinic. His mother reveals that he was also one of the victims of the shooting, but that he had only recently began to develop severe night terrors that she believes are related to the attack. Blake is unable to communicate with others due to a head wound that left him with a brain injury that has limited his mobility and made him need a wheelchair. Andover begins treatment on Blake, which they discover has the unintended side effect of healing his brain injury and giving him the ability to speak once more. This, along with his earlier vision of Paige, makes Andover believe that something sinister is at work and that Blake's miraculous healing only occurred so he could once more feel fear, which the creature needs to exist. Megan, who had previously checked  herself in the clinic before and has now done it again to be with Sara, has a small cyst on her back and has Osborn cut into it. Osborn sees that the same black fluid that Caylee vomited earlier is leaking from Megan's wound. Andover begins to suspect that Blake is hiding something, as Blake is reluctant to discuss some elements of the shooting during a therapy session. This proves to be the case after Blake discovers a mask identical to the one worn by the shooter. A series of flashbacks reveals that Blake was not a victim of the shooting but the perpetrator himself and that his head wound was a botched suicide attempt. Wandering through the building, Sara discovers Andover's records where he states that the creature is actually a manifestation of fear and that his Fear Chamber was effectively starving it of what it needed to survive: more fear.\nAndover is pulled into a strange cocoon-like structure on the wall, which enables the fear creature to take over his body. Meanwhile, Blake ended up succumbing to the influence of fear and becomes the shooter once more. He then proceeds to murder one of the clinic's employees while the fear creature incapacitates or kills several of the clinic's inhabitants through its influence. Sara encounters Blake, who chases her until she remembers a statement Andover made about Paige- that her time in the Fear Chamber incapacitated her but that she did not die until her eyes were closed.

After 10 years, the new owner of the mirror becomes afraid when she finds her husband dead, lying on a tiger stuffed toy, his death corresponding to his birth on the year of the Tiger. The new owner is trying to leave their condominium unit as a result of the good luck from the cursed bagua. She sees her twin daughters (Joj and Jai Agpangan), urging her to escape. It turned out to be the twins' souls who also died from the curse. It is believed that one of the twins shot at her sister and father before killing herself. She jumps off the terrace of their condominium unit and falls on monkey bars. Coincidentally, the mirror's owner was born in the year of the Monkey.\nLester Anonuevo (Coco Martin), a hustler living in a slum, visits a Taoist temple to take the bagua mirror, which had been taken by Hsui Liao (Joonee Gamboa) from the apartment, upon orders of a niece of Lotus Feet, who wants to repatriate the mirror to China. Despite returning it to the niece, the mirror reappears at Lester's house which leads to a turnaround in his fortunes. He is able to repay his loan shark, Boss Paulo, for his motorcycle before the latter, who had stared into the mirror hits his head into a hotdog cart and dies afterward. He finds a wallet with a phone and a card, which he redeems. His absentee father Robert (Rez Cortez) then returns and they move into a new house inside a more affluent estate. Before he leaves, Lester sees the ghost of Lotus Feet, the woman who cursed the bagua in her dying breath. Later that night, Lester's alcoholic mother Ruby (Carmi Martin) dies as a result of ingesting rat poison while drinking, revealing her to be born in the year of the Rat. This drives Lester to destroy the mirror. Joy, who is now a real estate agent arrives but leaves immediately when she sees the mirror, warning him not to accept any more good fortune.

Joy, Lily (a former owner of the bagua mirror played by Cherry Pie Picache), and Hsui Liao go to Lester's house to talk about what happened after Lester stole the bagua mirror. Liao realizes that the Bagua mirror is haunting Lester as well as its previous living owners as it is about to complete collecting the souls of its 12 previous owners that correspond to their zodiac animal. Liao also realizes that when Lotus Feet's niece tried to pacify her aunt and died, her soul eventually joined Lotus Feet in claiming a pair of victims, which explains the deaths of Robert and Jack, as well as Lester's companions in the slum, who were killed after being accused of Lester's earlier theft.

Tamura steals food from some local Filipinos while encountering disturbing evidence of the Japanese army's collapse.  A despondent soldier blows himself up with a grenade, while others lie dying from malnutrition or injuries on the path.  Tamura encounters two soldiers, Yasuda and Nagamatsu, who attempt to trade cigarettes for yams to soldiers who pass by; he declines the cigarette but gives Nagamatsu a yam regardless out of pity.  Tamura desperately forages whatever food he can, while American aircraft occasionally strafe the Japanese army remnants with bullets.  At a seemingly abandoned church, Tamura stabs a dog.  He sees a pile of Japanese corpses nearby, but investigates regardless; he finds a cache of salt hidden beneath a floorboard, but is found out by two Filipino civilians.  In a panicked haze, he shoots one; the other runs away, with Tamura's halfhearted shots missing.  Tamura runs away with his stolen food before reinforcements come, abandoning his rifle in the process.  Tamura joins up with some remaining soldiers from a different company, where he is told that the whole army has orders to attempt to retreat to Palompon.  Tamura travels with them for a time, trading his salt for yams; the other soldiers morbidly joke that they practiced cannibalism in order to survive during the New Guinea campaign, although Tamura is unsure if it is actually a joke or not.  The retreat to Palompon requires crossing an open road; as Japanese soldiers attempt to cross it at nightfall, they are easily detected and gunned down by the Americans and Filipinos.\nA famished Tamura prepares a white flag to attempt to surrender to a passing American jeep.  Just before he runs out to surrender, he sees another Japanese soldier attempt the same act.  The other soldier is gunned down by a vengeful Filipino woman in the jeep despite the American soldier's attempt to accept the surrender; Tamura perceives the shooter as the same woman he shot in the chapel.  It is clear to Tamura that crossing the road to get to Palompon is impossible, so he returns the way he came into the jungle.  Now delirious and perceiving corpses as talking to him, Tamura is found and saved from starvation by Nagamatsu, the soldier he had given a yam to earlier.  Tamura is given bark, water, and \"monkey meat\".  Tamura is bullied into giving his grenade to Yasuda, the canny superior whose leg was wounded and rolled up cigarettes for trade.  After hearing a shot, Tamura chases after Nagamatsu; he sees that he had fired at a fleeing Filipino civilian, and that the \"monkeys\" he had been hunting were other humans.  The loose alliance between Nagamatsu and Yasuda breaks down now that Yasuda has a grenade, as the two each fear that the other will kill them for their meat.  After guarding the only source of clean water in the area, Yasuda is smoked out; Yasuda attempts to negotiate, but Nagamatsu shoots him.

Four months later, Corrine announces that they are going to move and live with her wealthy parents in Virginia. She explains to her children that she was estranged from her parents and that's why she changed her last name.\nOn arrival at Foxworth Hall, Corrine's grim, claustrophobic and cold-hearted mother, Olivia, takes the children to a small room in the attic. The next day, the children are given a list of rules and Olivia tells them to stay in the attic at all times. Corrine explains that her father, Malcolm, disowned her for eloping with Christopher, who was actually her biological half-uncle (her father's younger half-brother) and they were disinherited.

On a night raid, Cathy finds Bart asleep and kisses him. Chris later overhears his mother and Bart talking about a dream of a young, blonde-haired girl coming into the room and kissing Bart. Chris angrily confronts Cathy, who assures him that the kiss meant nothing and she only did it out of curiosity. She kisses him and they end up having sex.

The powder cloud of the avalanche gives the appearance that the snow is rising and will wipe out everyone on the deck. Tomas, who is filming the avalanche on his phone, panics and runs as the deck quickly empties of patrons, leaving Ebba with their children encased in a dense fog. Patrons return to their tables as the fog dissipates, and no one is hurt.\nThat evening, they eat dinner with one of Ebba's friends, who has picked up an American man for the evening.

She has drinks with her friend they had dinner with the night before, as the woman says goodbye to another man. Ebba confronts her friend on her adultery, asking her if she loves her husband and children.

Mats suggests Tomas try primal screaming, and Tomas does, screaming swear words into the Alps.

He weeps as his children inside huddle and cry together, hearing their parents argue.\nOn their final day, the family ascends in the ski lift silently. Ebba is concerned about the thick fog. Tomas says he will go first, then the children, then she can follow. Ebba gets lost in the fog, and Tomas briefly leaves the children alone to go rescue her, returning carrying her shortly after.

Du Pont praises him, and they develop a friendship. Du Pont introduces Mark to cocaine, which he starts to use regularly.

Alex plans ahead and disappears into a crowd to avoid capture.\nSam (Tiffany Mualem), an empathetic and tough paramedic, pulls up to a scene of domestic violence and runs into the house before cops arrive. Sam manages to save a battered woman and protect herself and the daughter from a belligerent husband. Clearly rattled by her day job and trying to reconcile seeing pain every day, Sam visits her therapist and talks about her wish to make everything better but recognizes the futility.\nHome after collecting his pay for the recent heist, Alex stashes it in a hidden wall safe and turns on the TV to eat dinner. He watches intently a television show, which happens to be the scene with Sam the paramedic we just saw happening in real time. Sam is the star of the show, called Urban Hope.\nSam, home after her therapist visit, sits eating dinner in front of the TV and watches Alex's recent heist and escape with the intensity of a true fan. Alex's show is called Thieves and Saints.\nLate one evening, as the two have their televisions on, they realize that they are each broadcast live from their living rooms on the other's TV set. They say hello, panic, and turn off their TVs. Each handles the impossibility in a different way \u2013 Sam tells her therapist she may be losing her mind, and Alex believes the cartel or cops have him under surveillance.\nAlex visits his mentor Noah (Cal Bartlett) who is sick and elderly but who seems to be the only person Alex has in the world. Noah senses Alex is in danger, reminds him he's living in a dark world of his own creation, and sends him home with the violin Alex played as a child. Alex is reluctant to take the violin as it is a reminder of something painful in his past \u2013 a clue we received when he accidentally almost ruined a photo of himself with his parents and the violin as a young boy.\nAlex and Sam continue to see each other randomly through their televisions and attempt to unwind the mystery by setting a meeting point at her apartment and later at a bridge. Both are met with bizarre interactions: Alex's Cartel Boss shows up in one form on the bridge in his world; Sam's Therapist shows up in another form on the bridge in her world and in front of her apartment as a dark character riding a bizarre black tar-spewing bicycle. We realize these characters are one and the same, crossing the boundaries between their worlds and morphing into different forms. We also realize that Sam and Alex have the additional connection of music between the two worlds \u2013 Sam hums a beautiful melody from the bridge and Alex taps his hand to the same count and we see a mysterious vibration around them.\nThe violin that Noah gave to Alex keeps appearing in Alex's apartment, but Alex wishes to make it go away so he repeatedly puts it away in the closet. Back out again on a moving box, the camera pans across the room and knocks the violin off the box with the left frame line. There is definitely some kind of surveillance happening in Alex's world but it isn't the cartel or the cops. Something else is watching him.\nThe menacing Therapist, Cartel Boss and Black Tar Mechanic characters (all played by Christopher Soren Kelly) continue to distract and prevent them each from believing that the connection on the television is legitimate. Alex has one last heist to pull and Sam sees that his show is ending \u2013 that the advertised Season Finale of Thieves and Saints is the final heist. Sam pleads with Alex not to go on the heist, that she doesn't know what will happen to him and perhaps there is a fate worse than being caught by the cops or killed by the cartel. Sam wonders if there is a writer to his show \u2013 is some production company in charge of both of their stories? Alex fires back, angry at the idea that a writer would write him such a horrific life. Sam says either everything is chaos or everything is a miracle. Alex is certain everything is chaos. On a hunch, Sam researches the Thieves and Saints production company website.\nThe final heist in Thieves and Saints has Alex gunning down most of his crew to save an innocent bystander family. Alex takes a shot to the gut in the shootout as Sam watches panicked at her TV. Alex stumbles home and sees her on his TV and she pleads with him to call an ambulance. He fears being caught, he thinks the cartel are everywhere and he is content to die with the connection to Sam from his apartment. Knowing he doesn't have much longer, Sam asks Alex to hum a melody with her. It's the same melody she was humming at the bridge and as Alex joins in, both of their worlds begin to vibrate. Alex weakens, takes his final breath and Sam sits stunned pleading with him not to leave her.\nShe springs into action, remembering she had found the Thieves and Saints production company address, and drives there, only to be stopped by her therapist, who has been looking for her, fearing she is not mentally well. She runs past him into the building and to the floor of the Thieves and Saints writer's office. A 60s-dressed secretary sits in a small lobby staring at a phone and asks how Sam is doing. Sam goes through the only door in the room and finds herself in an empty room \u2013 on one side extending to infinite black and the other with spools feeding into a typing machine. She exits the other side which takes her back into the secretary's office and she has the same short conversation as if on a repeating loop.\nFinally she summons the courage to walk toward the typing machine in the empty room and sees a projection image above the machine showing Alex on the floor of his apartment. The typing machine deposits the final page for \u201cThieves and Saints: Episode 50\u201d. Sam picks up the script and flips through, seeing everything that had happened up to this point in his show. Sam is able to write onto the script and change Alex's fate, reviving him from death. Changing the script sets off a cascade of changing events that Sam struggles to keep up with as she drives through the city to escape her persistent therapist.\nHumming her favorite melody nervously and paying more attention to the script than the road, Sam's car is hit by oncoming traffic and spun around. In her final desperate attempt to save Alex from his ever-changing script, she burns it. Shortly thereafter another car crashes into her and kills her.\nAt that moment, everyone in Alex's world disintegrates into black tar and the traffic, noise, and activity come to a halt. Alex sits catatonic for a few moments then walks around the vacant city in wonder. He passes by an antique shop with an old television playing Sam's show and he sees her car accident and final demise. As he's reeling from her death, he turns around to find Sam's Therapist morph from the TV into the Black Tar Mechanic standing right behind him. The Mechanic delivers a bizarre speech \u2013 beginning with 'all that was left was the man and the devil, trapped in the writer's creation.' Alex realizes he is in fact written and that the only person left in the world with him is the devil. The devil is determined to erase the world with his black tar machine, with or without Alex in it.\nAlex returns home with earlier scenes from Sam's show playing on a loop. He wanders the city a bit, always aware there is something over his shoulder watching him. Out of paranoia he looks back but sees nothing. He is despondent, exhausts his remaining food and is entirely alone but for Sam's reruns and a massive, ugly machine spewing black tar into the sky and blocking out the sun. He sees that Sam burned his script. This gives him the idea to do the same \u2013 what if he could find the writer's office too?\nAlex arrives in the same strange secretary's room at the production company; it is vacant. No signs of life anywhere. Alex opens the door to the empty room and hears typing at the far end. As he walks toward the sound of the typewriter, he sees a projection of himself in that moment repeating into infinity. He turns back and stares directly into the camera \u2013 aware for the first time that the camera is the entity who is watching him. He approaches the typewriter and sees a full script sitting in the paper tray called 'The Frame'. The script describes the exact moment we're seeing, Alex becoming aware of the script and storyteller and writer. He stumbles backward in disbelief and the left side of the camera frame hits him in the back. He moves in the opposite direction and finds the other side of The Frame. After challenging both sides, The Frame lifts him up and tilts him backwards and he mysteriously wakes up at home.\nContemplating his encounter with this mysterious force, he draws a square, then two arrows: one pointing left and one pointing right toward both edges. He then pokes a hole through the paper and realizes he needs to run away from the camera, not toward the edges.\nAlex, finally ready to test fate and his entrapment, jumps out of his third-story window. The Frame catches him gracefully at the bottom of the picture, preventing his death. Alex runs and The Frame pursues him at every turn \u2013 Alex smashes into the edges of The Frame. He is angrily reliving his childhood, in which his parents were murdered and his prayer for help went unanswered. He tells the writer to fuck off \u2013 that the writer left him all alone. The writer wrote him a cruel and lonely life and made him do terrible things. Alex heaves his anger one final time at The Frame and passes out on the street. Gently The Frame picks him up and carries him home.\nAlex again wakes up in his apartment as The Mechanic is closing in on his promise to black out the world. Sam's final episode is still replaying on his TV \u2013 she is being pursued by her Therapist and hums nervously while she drives and changes Alex's script. With nothing left to do but surrender, Alex finally reaches for his violin. As he plays, the melody of her humming and his strings combine to merge their two worlds. Alex swings the final note from the intersection in her world which sends the car which had run into and killed her, flying over her instead, leaving her safe.\nStunned to see him kneeling on the intersection where she burned his script, she approaches him with disbelief. Sam slowly walks up to him and places her hand warmly on his head. Alex bows in relief. For the first time in the film, The Frame pans off both characters and blurs to white."}, "41670200": {"title": "Frank (film)", "plot": "While walking along the beach in his hometown, aspiring songwriter Jon Burroughs witnesses a man named Lucas trying to drown himself.

Once Robert drops his claimed innocence and acknowledges the truth, he and Oleg fight as Alisa and Stepan look on. Due to his weakened state, Oleg gains the upper hand but is killed by Alisa before he can finish off Robert. Alisa is in fact Robert's girlfriend and had been working on the inside for him. A wounded Stepan escapes and locks the two inside. Robert uses the severed electrical wires to cause the metal meat rack to give off enough heat to warm their hands. At this time, Detective Dorian arrives and demands to know where the money is after instructing the two to bind their hands to the rack. Alisa confesses that the money has been inside the meat locker the entire time, hidden inside the boxes of cuts.

The tribal chief then narrates the story about the valour of Baahubali. The king of Karunadu is about to be attacked by a king Verma. At this juncture, Baahubali defeats one of the strongest warriors of Verma. Saddened at this, Verma resorts to a cunning way and makes Baahubali's close friend poison Baahubali. When he is poisoned, Verma attacks him with his army along with the traitor minister of Karunadu. In spite of his dying state, Baahubali single-handedly defeats the entire army of Verma and kills them. In this fight, Baahubali loses his pet elephant, \"Balarama\" (this is the elephant which has incarnated as Kalinga), who kills some of the enemy soldiers and dies. Finally, Baahubali dies, and the king of Karunadu awards the title of \"Gajakesari\" to Baahubali for his meritorious act of bravery and his service to the Motherland.\nNow, Krishna, having known his past life, faces Rana and his henchmen and is almost killed.

The director then listens to Raju writer's story. He starts his story by saying about the relation of Mumbai's social and industrial works with the spirits or ghosts staying in the houses, trees, etc., and how their homes are lost. Then he shifts to Raibahadur Seth Gendamal Hemraj who owns a large Mill and is also the owner of the Royal Mansion. The mill workers angry by Gendamal's friendly relation with the Britishers, set out to burn the mill in which Gendamal was present, burning him to death. His ghost now stays at his own Royal Mansion. Then Raju tells about Mr. Ramsey who was had a habit of reading and at that time the Indians were struggling for the fight for Independence and threw a bomb at him to his death. He contacted his once upon a time boss Mr. Booth who asks Gendamal to let Ramsey stay at the Royal Mansion to which Gendamal agrees.\nRaju then tells the director that Gendamal had a younger brother Gulab Chand (Chunkey Pandey) who was dating a famous actress at that time Manoranjana Kumari (Mahi Gill). She wanted Gulab to marry her and he also agrees with to soon marry each other. But Gulab betrays her by marrying a rich girl. So she gets depresses and drinks a lot due to which she hangs herself and dies. Gendamal allows her to stay at the Royal Mansion. Gulab also dies after being shot by gangsters but Gendamal denies his request to stay at the mansion. Soon Gendamal and Ramsey conduct an audition for eligible ghosts in search of shelter. They select only 10 to 15 ghosts as the Mansion would be overcrowded. All live happily in the Royal Mansion with each other with some ghosts flirting with Manoranjana and others doing their own works.\nUntil one day, they come to know that a businessman named Mr. Bhuteria is planning to demolish the Mansion to build a grand mall in its place. The ghosts plan together to not let him achieve his goal. Manoranjana goes to Bhuteria by another  name to pull out some information from Bhuteria where he tells her of his wife Lakshmi (Pretie Lad) who died and still haunts him in his dreams.\nHe then reveals to Manoranjana that he actually killed her. Bhuteria turns to find Manoranjana  is not there. A ghost named Babu Hatkata goes to Bhuteria to tell him that he knows of his plots and invites him to the Royal Mansion to speak with Gendamal.

Raju goes back to the store room and comes back with a pouch of gold coins from the time of the East India Company and their value would be enough to make the film. There Raju tells the director that while being he couldn't do anything but after dying he was able to get acknowledgement, which explains that the director was talking to a ghost all the time. He explain that while he was in his struggling days he once came across a bus where some men are about to rape a girl. He rushes to save her during which he gets stabbed to his death. He brushes it off until Raju shows him all the ghosts in another room. He wakes up from a dream stating that this was a dream. He meets his crew searching for him and tells that he listened a full script in his dream. He goes back to the room to find Raju's bag which is full of cash and also the pouch of  gold coins earlier in his pocket and gets spooked. Inspired by the story, he starts the movie with Raju's story with all the ghosts looking at the shoot with great happiness.", "tmdb_id": 260318}, "46573180": {"title": "Garm Wars: The Last Druid", "plot": "A small planet name Annwn circles around its blue parent planet called Gaia. Annwn was once populated by eight tribes, known as Garms. Long ago, the planet was at peace, as all the different races of Annwn were united by their collective servitude to their creator, a Goddess name Danaan. Unfortunately, violence broke out when Danaan left, setting all the tribes against each other in a never ending war for supremacy. The war proved devastating to the planet's atmosphere, resulting in near annihilations of most of the tribes on the planet, though three remained- the Briga, the Kumtak and the Columba. During this time, the Druids, who previously conveyed the words of Annwn's Gods, disappeared. The Briga tribe lives on the ground and dominates in military superiority through the use of hybrid-powered tanks and cybernetics weaponry, while the weaker Kumtak tribe, facing near extinction, is forced to submit to the Briga by offering advance information technology in their war against the Columba. The Columba rule the sky through the use of mechanized air forces and live in a fortified airship-like carrier.\nThe film itself is divided into three different acts. In Act 1, The Exile of the Three Magi, a Kumtak man named Wydd (Lance Henriksen) is captured by the Columba, along with a dog resembling a basset hound who he refers to as a 'Gula' (a holy creature to all the tribes) and a mysterious being who is identified as Nascien (Summer Howell), the last of the missing Druids. During his interrogation aboard the Columba airship, Wydd claims that he fled from the Briga people because the Kumtak are enslaved, and offers his services and the Druid's power to fight against his people's oppressors. When the airship is eventually destroyed during a Briga attack, Wydd reveals his true purpose, which is to travel to the lands of the Druids with Nascien and find out why Danaan created the Garms, if she intended to leave. He then recruits Khara (Melanie St-Pierre), the Columba clone-soldier that interrogated him, and Skelling (Kevin Durand), the Briga officer who led the attack on the airship, before setting off on this quest.\nIn Act 2, Passage to the Other World, Wydd and his companions continue their journey to the land of the Druids. As the journey draws on, Skellig and Khara both learn that they are quickly running out of mana, the life-energy that sustains then. Despite this pressing concern, the party travels in a Briga tank across war-torn wastelands and seas. Upon witnessing the devastation and brutality of the war, Khara begins to question the worth of the war, but Skellig does not appear to share these concerns.\nIn the final act, Sacred Grove, the party finally arrives at the land of the Druids. Unfortunately, the Briga tank breaks down, forcing Skellig to stay behind and repair it as Wydd, Khara and Nascien continue onward. During their exploration of the sacred grove, Wydd accidentally activates the Druids' defence systems and awakens giant robotic defenders. Skellig manages to repair the tank and hold off the defenders while the others escape, but loses his life in the process. When the group finally arrives at the source of the Druid's knowledge and power, Nascien kills Wydd and reveals her true purpose: to take control of the Druid`s guardians and destroy all the Garms. While the guardians are awoken and set against the Garms, Khara manages to destroy Nascien before she escapes. Khara then asks the dying Nascien why the Garms were abandoned by the Gods. Nascien reveals that the Goddess Danaan left because she feared the destructive potential of the Garms, which is why Nascien took it upon herself to destroy them.  Nascien then says the God's true name to satisfy Khara's curiosity, claiming that \"They\" are a jealous God. Khara then shoots Nascien and falls into a state of sorrow.  As she looks up to the dispersed clouds, Gaia is revealed to resemble Earth, indicating that Annwn was once the Moon, and these \"Gods\" and the Goddess Danaan were responsible for the creation of mankind. The film then ends on a cliffhanger, with the rising gigantic robotic army called Malakh and the Garm warring tribes finally abandoning their endless war to unite against the common enemy, thus beginning a new age of heavy warfare on the planet of Annwn.", "tmdb_id": 302026}, "45671177": {"title": "Les gazelles", "plot": "Marie and Eric, a couple in their thirties who have been together since college, buy their first apartment when Marie is suddenly overcome by doubt.

His mother eventually leaves and becomes a prostitute. His father joins the Army, leaving James in the care of his brothel-running aunt. He is fascinated by the shout music at a black church. Later, he fights in a \"battle royal\" boxing match for the amusement of a white audience. Imagining the jazz band breaking into a funk style inspires him to win the bout. He spots his mother on the street one night, but she denies knowing him.\nIn 1949, 17 year-old James is imprisoned for stealing a suit. When Bobby Byrd and his gospel group perform at the prison, James is inspired. He impresses Bobby with his singing, and Bobby's family supervises his parole. James establishes himself as a lead singer and shifts the group's sound toward R&B. He leads them to jump onstage at a Little Richard show, introduces them as \"the Famous Flames\", and they perform a rousing rendition of \"Caldonia\". Richard gives James advice and warns him of the \"white devil\". James marries Velma Warren, and they have a son, Teddy.

Santa instructs Steve on how to find his reindeer, and hence his crashed sleigh, and in return Steve sends him to the barber who provides him with a few pointers on how to cope in prison. While Santa is asked to act as the Father Christmas for the local prison party, Steve finds the field in Richmond Park where the reindeer have been taken, with Tom establishing which reindeer is the leader, Dasher, as Dasher communicates through flatulence. They are able to find the sleigh, but when Steve calls Santa to update him, he accidentally releases all of the bright green magic dust the sleigh needs to fly.\nStuck for options, Steve agrees to go to Hermey's Tower in Suffolk, where Santa informs him that he will find help, based on a book in the sleigh's glove compartment, despite this trip meaning that Steve will miss his parole hearing. Despite such delays as difficulty hitch-hiking and a close call that forces them to steal costumes from a pantomime, they are able to reach Hermey's Tower, but are unable to work out what to do next.\nBack at the prison, Santa manages to convince the other prisoners of his identity when they see letters hit the window addressed to Santa, followed by Santa recounting some of the last presents he left for the prisoners when they were children. However, when parole officer Ruth comes to prison to report Steve has missed his parole hearing, she not only identifies him as the man who stole Dasher, but also identifies Santa as 'Harry Mitchell', who was arrested while trying to climb down a chimney over twenty years ago but escaped en route to jail. However, the prisoners begin to acknowledge the truth when an emergency news report reveals that Australian children have woken up with no presents in their stockings.\nWith Santa transferred to solitary, Steve contemplates giving up, but Tom is able to translate a clue in the book to work out how to open Hermey's Tower, which is one of several receiving towers that pick up the letters to Santa and divert them to Lapland. Travelling through the letter-tunnel, Steve and Tom reach Elf City, where Steve convinces the elves to let him use an old sleigh to rescue Santa from prison while deploying a squirrel called Oswald to release the other reindeer, Steve arguing that those children who have woken up without presents may simply find them in other areas. They see that the green magic powder is used for creating the northern lights, that the reindeer walk on in the skies. Reaching the prison, they are able to use a magic slinky to enlarge a small chimney so that Steve and Tom can enter the prison.\nAt the same time, Santa is about to be transferred to solitary, but attempts a break-out with the aid of a dwarf prisoner known as 'Sally', culminating in a fight in the prison gym that ends when Santa punches the guard responsible for supervising the transfer when he says he hates Christmas.

As Ruth asks why Santa would choose Steve to help him, Santa notes that Steve is commendable because he never stops trying, and reassures Tom that adults can make mistakes but just need a chance to believe in the magic of Christmas.

Radisson reads a letter from his late mother and is moved to reconcile with Mina. Amy confronts the Newsboys in their dressing room but asks them to help guide her in converting to Christianity. On his way to find Mina, Radisson is struck by a car and fatally injured. A reverend waiting at the intersection tends to Radisson and helps him as he dies. Mark, at last, visits his mother, but mocks her for her faith; she responds that his financial success was given to him by Satan to keep him from turning to God, then she doesn't remember his name. At the concert, the Newsboys show a video clip of Willie Robertson congratulating Josh on standing up to Radisson and encourages the audience to text \"God's Not Dead\" as a message to others.

In 1999, Monarch scientists Ishiro Serizawa and Vivienne Graham investigate the skeleton of a monster similar to Godzilla in a cavern unearthed by a collapsed uranium mine in the Philippines. They also find two giant spores, one dormant and one hatched, along with a trail leading to the sea. In Japan, the Janjira Nuclear Power Plant experiences unusual seismic activity as supervisor Joe Brody sends his wife Sandra to lead a team of technicians into the reactor. A tremor breaches the reactor, forcing Joe to close the reactor door before Sandra and her team can escape while the plant collapses.\nFifteen years later, Joe and Sandra's son Ford, a U.S. Navy EOD officer, returns from a tour of duty to his wife Elle and son Sam in San Francisco, but must immediately depart for Japan after Joe is detained for trespassing in Janjira's quarantine zone. Joe is determined to find out the cause of the meltdown and persuades Ford to accompany him to retrieve vital data from their old home. They learn that the zone is uncontaminated and retrieve the data, but are discovered and taken to a facility in the plant's ruins. The facility harbors a massive chrysalis that had been feeding off the plant's reactors for 15 years and emitting intense electromagnetic pulses over time. A giant winged insect-like creature emerges from the chrysalis and escapes, destroying the facility. Joe is severely injured and later dies. The incident is reported publicly as an earthquake.\nSerizawa and Graham join a U.S. Navy task force led by Admiral William Stenz to search for the creature, dubbed a \"MUTO\" (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organism). Serizawa and Graham reveal to Ford that a 1954 deep-sea expedition awakened Godzilla. Nuclear tests in the 1950s were attempts to kill him; when this did not work, Project Monarch was established to study Godzilla and similar monsters secretly. They also explain that the MUTO caused the Janjira meltdown. Ford reveals Joe had monitored echolocation signals indicating the MUTO was communicating with something, presumably Godzilla.\nThe MUTO attacks a Russian submarine and drops it in O'ahu to eat its nuclear material. Godzilla arrives, causing a tsunami in Honolulu, and briefly engages the MUTO in battle until it flees. Serizawa deduces Godzilla was only listening as the MUTO was communicating with something else, prompting the military to investigate the other spore stored in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. However, a second, bigger, wingless MUTO has already emerged and attacks Las Vegas. The scientists deduce that it is female and was what the male was communicating with, their signals being a mating call.\nOver the scientists' objections, Stenz approves a plan of using nuclear warheads to lure all three monsters out into the open ocean and destroy them. Returning to the U.S., Ford joins the team delivering the warheads by train, but the female MUTO intercepts them and devours most of the warheads. The remaining warhead is airlifted with Ford to San Francisco, where the monsters are converging, and activated after Godzilla appears at the Golden Gate Bridge, only for the male MUTO to snatch it and take it to the female, who forms a nest around it in the Chinatown area.\nWhile Godzilla and the MUTOs battle, Ford and a strike team enter the city via HALO jump to find and disarm the warhead before it detonates. Unable to access the timer, the team gets the warhead onto a boat for disposal at sea while Ford destroys the nest. Godzilla defeats the MUTOs and collapses on the shore from exhaustion. Ford gets the boat out to the open sea, is rescued before the warhead explodes, and reunites with his family at an emergency shelter the following morning.

In 2014, on the abandoned planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious Orb, but is attacked by forces of the fanatical Kree renegade Ronan the Accuser led by Korath. Although Quill escapes with the Orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin Gamora after the Orb.\nWhen Quill attempts to sell the Orb on Xandar, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon Rocket, and the tree-like humanoid Groot. Nova Corps officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. An inmate there, Drax the Destroyer, attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with the powerful intergalactic warlord, Thanos, and Ronan, who killed his wife and daughter. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the Orb's power. Learning that Gamora intends to sell the Orb to the Collector Taneleer Tivan, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the Milano.\nRonan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flees to Knowhere, a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a Celestial. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meets Tivan. Tivan opens the Orb, revealing the Power Stone, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's collection. Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister Nebula. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the Orb.\nQuill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the Orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the Dark Aster, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar. Hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.\nThe Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the Dark Aster at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the warship with the Milano. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax kills Korath and Gamora defeats Nebula, who escapes, but the group finds themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the Dark Aster. The damaged Dark Aster crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, uses it to vaporize Ronan.\nIn the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real one to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract.

The family moves into a new home with their dog, Shiloh Jr. After the movers hang a safe next to the lawn, an invisible force unties the rope tied to a support beam, causing the safe to fall on the dog and crush him. Malcolm dramatically cries all the way to when they bury the dog.\nMegan then puts a creepy looking doll named Abigail on a chair by their bed. Malcolm messes around with it until he starts having sex with it. Malcolm carries his camera around to record everything he sees. He meets the neighbor, Miguel, who jumps at every chance he gets to call Malcolm racist whenever he comments on something related to a Mexican stereotype, though all of it is in jest. Weird things start happening again. Malcolm records himself having sex with Megan and notices the Abigail doll turning its head. He also finds old videotapes with a demonic being in it trying to kill a family of three, but it fails every time.\nAdditionally, Becky finds an old box and develops an attachment to it, and Wyatt continues to hang out with his imaginary friend. Malcolm seeks help from a paranormal psychologist named Professor Wilde. He deduces that Malcolm must have had a previous encounter with a demonic force. Malcolm thinks it has to do with Kisha. Wilde then proceeds to cook meth with some prostitutes, but then gets arrested by the police. Malcolm finds himself being terrorized and taunted by Abigail, as he is getting sent crude photos from her to his phone. She also ends up burning his clothes. Later, Malcolm sees a box moving in the dark and begins to attack it in every possible way he can.

Malcolm fixes this by installing bug zappers to attract the moths to their doom. He also notices the demon, which Professor Wilde says is named Aghoul, taunting him in the videos. Although he tries to explain the weirdness to Megan and the kids, they don't believe him. To make matters worse, Malcolm comes home the next day to discover Kisha talking to Megan, looking very much not possessed. She has told Megan that Malcolm left her in a ditch to die, and she leaves after flashing him some scary black demon eyes.

In the past, the Raven Lord would go to war with anyone just to gain power. But when humanity was at its wits end, a warrior descended from the Heavens. He challenged and defeated the Raven Lord with the Heavenly Sword. When the fight ended, the warrior disappeared, leaving behind his sword. Men would fight anyone tooth and nail just to wield the Heavenly Sword's unearthly power. Eventually, the Heavenly Sword was entrusted to the ancient clan of nomadic warriors to ensure that man does not use it for evil purposes.\nFrom here, the film's plot follows that of the game quite loosely. The film begins with Nariko, who is a part of that very same clan that were entrusted with the Heavenly Sword. She is known as the failure of the clan, including her father.  She is skilled in fighting but her father, Shen, does not recognize her skills since she is a female.\nWhen King Bohan's assassins invade the clan's fortress, Nariko demonstrates her skills by killing many assassins and rescuing Kyo. Bohan knows the clan guards the Heavenly Sword and came to get it since it is the only sword that can kill him. Shen sees her skills and gives her the Heavenly Sword to protect. She is to travel west, while her father and the remaining clan members travel east.\nWhile escaping some of Bohan's soldiers, the bridge fell. Waiting on the other side is Bohan. He wants her to hand the sword over or be killed like her father and Kai, her sister. Nariko never knew that Kai was her sister. Apparently, on the night of Nariko's birth, Shen left the fortress to impregnate many women to correct his mistake: having Nariko. Months later, Kai was born, another failure.\nBut there is another surprise. Two days before Christmas, one of the women Shen impregnated gave birth to a son, unbeknownst to him. The woman faked her own death and escaped to a fishing village in the north. The son is the chosen one. Bohan spent twenty long years searching for him.\nWhen Nariko was about to give the sword to Bohan, she changed her mind. Since she has nothing to live for, she grabbed the sword and jumped down the ravine.\nAs the year of the Firehorse began years ago, Nariko was born. No one knew that firstborn child would be a daughter instead of a son. Disappointed in having a daughter, Shen sent Nariko to live far away, in the forest. Prophet Takashi took this opportunity to train her to become a warrior in secrecy.\nAs Nariko wakes up, she finds that she is in front of a campfire. The person who fished her out is Kai. Kai knew that Nariko is her sister but didn't say anything because Shen didn't want to be Kai's father. They decide to travel north to find their brother.\nAs they traveled, Nariko learned about Kai's mother. Her mother was strong and funny. When Shen visited, he would bring gold \u2013 \u201cto help\u201d. One day, Flying Fox came. When her mother saw him, she hid Kai in a cave. He had come to get Kai. Fox and his men killed her people and mother.\nBefore they reached the fishing village in the dead marsh, General Whiptail's soldiers killed many villagers. With the help of Nariko and the Heavenly Sword and Kai and her crossbow, they helped some of the villagers and got directions to their brother. But when they reached the hut that their brother, Loki, should have lived in, they learned that he left a year ago for the northeast. He wanted to become a blacksmith for a foreign king.\nWhiptail overhears this and orders her soldiers to kill them. When Nariko and Kai kill her, they are informed that Whiptail already told the villagers that whoever tells Bohan of Loki's whereabouts will be rewarded beyond their wildest dreams.\nBut when Nariko and Kai reached the fortress in the northeast, Bohan's soldiers were already coming. The effects of the Heavenly Sword start to show in Nariko. It is slowly draining her soul, trying to kill its bearer. From deduction, they find out that the king Loki is trying to work for is none other than Bohan and the fortress in the northeast is Bohan's as well. They see Shen getting dragged to a cage and that Bohan lied to them about Shen and their people.\nIn the fortress, they find and rescue Takashi and the other clan members. They learn that Kyo, the person who bullies the sisters, rode to Bohan's army after the sisters left but dies fighting them. They told Shen about their brother and that he is the chosen one. Shen said that he was doing the right thing when he impregnated many women. He learned the errors of his ways and his daughters forgave him. As Shen was about to die, Nariko used the Heavenly Sword's power to bring him back but the effects start to get worse.\nNariko and Kai arrive to Bohan's blacksmith forge but are too late. The couple they helped earlier when they arrived at Loki's village sold him out. There were others after them but since they were the first, they get the gold. Nariko and Kai rescue Loki and killed Bohan's son.\nAfter Nariko gives the Heavenly Sword to Loki, he is killed by Flying Fox. He does the same to Kai. During a difficult battle, Kai, who was just unconscious and badly wounded, killed the real Flying Fox. Kai stops Nariko before she could use the sword's healing power.\nThe sisters spend three days traveling back to their homeland, all while Bohan's army follows on their trail. Nariko fainted when they arrive home. She tells Shen that his son is dead and Bohan is coming. She isn't going to fight for her people but for Kai, her only real family.\nWhen Bohan's army arrives, Nariko learns that Kyo, who is supposed to be dead, is alive. He was the one who told Bohan where the Heavenly Sword was. He did it because he knows that Bohan was always coming and once the sword is given to him, the clan will be free. She refuses so Bohan commands his army to rain arrows on them. She uses the sword's power to shield her against them but Kyo isn't so lucky \u2013 he dies.\nNariko is one woman against Bohan's entire army. She uses the Heavenly Sword power as seen in the beginning of the film. After using its power, she is transported into the sword. It hates her. She tells it that Bohan will melt the sword and that it needs her. The sword gave her its power which she uses to defeat Bohan's army.\nBohan, having seen the sword's power, sacrifices his soul to the Raven King. She defeats him. The Raven King abandons Bohan's body and plucks out his eyes. Roach, Bohan's son, was alive and tells her to leave or else he will kill her.\nNariko returns to her home and tells her father that the sword didn't choose her, she chose it. She uses the sword's healing power to resurrect a dying Kai. Nariko entrusts the sword to Kai, as deities cannot stay. Upon her dying breath, she tells Shen to love Kai as he never did to Nariko.\nIn Nariko's narration, she knows Kai will master the Heavenly Sword and that they will meet again in a better world. The sword might be forgotten but Kai will still be remembered.\nDuring the end credits, Kai is seen picking up the sword and grins at the audience implying she will carry on Nariko Legacy as the new owner of the sword.", "tmdb_id": 256766}, "41892988": {"title": "Hector and the Search for Happiness (film)", "plot": "Hector is a quirky psychiatrist who has become increasingly tired of his humdrum life.

Elsewhere, Shu finally remembers his past and leads Kota to his house, where it is revealed that Shu has been dead the whole time. Just before his death, he had a fight with his mother, and he now wishes to see her one last time to make amends with her. Kamen Rider Fifteen then appears to take Shu with him, and Kota learns that he is actually Shu's father Ren Aoi.

As he and his father are called to dinner, Jack goes through a temporary state of anemia and drops the ball. His parents are convinced that something is terribly wrong with their son, much to their horror.\nThe scene switches to Jack in the hospital, where he has contracted cancer to the point where he is completely bald. As he is carted away for an operation, his parents stay behind, and his chaperone Nurse Cyndi (Cyndi Lauper) sings a jaunty tune of \"Take Me Out to The Ball Game\" to no avail of lifting the boy's spirits. She leaves Jack outside the room, but not before she treats Jack with a sedative to give him \"sweet dreams\". Unhappy with the hardships brought upon by his newly contracted illness, Jack contemplates the (seemingly) final moments of his life until he is greeted by a guardian angel taking the form of a Yankees executive named Henry (Richard Gere). At first, Jack is hesitant to watch the game while he waits, but unwittingly accepts Henry's offer and the man takes him into an imaginary plane of existence where the 20th century is timeless, illness has no existence, the Yankee players of the past are alive and well and most of all, his hair is back.\nHenry and Jack's first stop is early 1930, where they meet Babe Ruth (Chazz Palminteri) in a small field surrounded by corn. He convinces Jack to take the bat, and after a nervous fib about a peanut allergy, strikes out three times. Babe convinces him to try again, yet this time, his teammates laugh Jack off for his age.

When an actual game ensues, Munson encourages Jack to pitch the ball to Mantle, but he refuses (by saying that he is not a real pitcher). Despite Jack's inexperience, Munson and Jack continue with an upbeat exchange of words until Jack's blood pressure starts to drop, realizing that the game he is fighting for is his life in the physical world.

Cissy and some other baseball kids bid Jack goodbye, but not before she shouts back \"We're all rooting for you!\" With that, Jack wins the battle, and the game.\nAutomatically transported to the present, Jack meets the elderly George Steinbrenner, who offers him a place on the team.

Hercules is said to be the demigod son of Zeus, who completed the legendary Twelve Labors after being betrayed by Hera, who drove him insane and caused him to murder his wife and children during a visit to King Eurystheus. It remains unclear whether Hercules is truly the son of Zeus and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of his Twelve Labors. Despite this, Hercules displays unusual inhuman strength and nigh-unmatched skill in combat. He is also frequently haunted by the memory of the deaths of loved ones, as well as visions of Cerberus.\nOn the Macedonian Coast in Northern Greece in 1358 BC, Hercules and his team are approached by Ergenia. Her father, King Cotys, wants Hercules to train the armies of Thrace to defend the kingdom from bloodthirsty warlord Rhesus. Hercules accepts after being offered his weight in gold, and the band is welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General Sitacles, leader of the Thracian army. However, when Rhesus reaches Central Thrace, Cotys insists that Hercules lead the army into battle to defend the Bessi tribe there, despite Hercules's objections and the army's lack of training. However, they are too late as Rhesus' supposed sorcery has turned the Bessi against the Thracians. After the Bessi are defeated following a long and disastrous battle which results in at least half the Thracian forces being killed, Hercules and his allies properly train the army.

Taking pity, Hercules stops the townsfolk from throwing more objects at him. When Hercules mentions Rhesus' actions of burning down villages, Rhesus tells him it was not him or his army that committed those atrocities. Later, in the palace hall, Rhesus is chained up and left on display. Noticing that Ergenia has taken pity on him, Hercules confronts her and finds out Rhesus was telling the truth. He was merely retaliating against Cotys' attempts to expand his kingdom. Ergenia does not agree with Cotys's methods, but goes along out of fear, as her cruel father already poisoned her husband, the previous king. Furthermore, Cotys threatens her son Arius, the true heir to the throne.\nAfter receiving their reward, the mercenaries are ready to leave, but Hercules decides to stay behind and stop Cotys. All but Autolycus choose to follow him. However, they are overpowered and captured by Sitacles and his men. While chained, Hercules is confronted by King Eurystheus, who is in league with Cotys. Eurystheus reveals that he drugged Hercules the night his family died, viewing him as a threat to his power. Hercules' family was actually killed by three wolves sent by Eurystheus, resulting in Hercules' constant hallucinations of Cerberus. When Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself. In a show of superhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and defeating the wolves single-handedly. Hercules releases the prisoners, including Rhesus, and then confronts Eurystheus, killing him and avenging his family; however, he is ambushed by Sitacles, who is then stabbed to death by Iolaus.

She seems strong and independent but suffers from depression and feels isolated. She makes dinner for her neighbor Bob Giffen and sings to him, but when she proposes, he turns her down, saying she is plain-looking and too bossy. He leaves to find a wife back east.\nAfter a harsh winter, three women from the community show signs of mental instability due to the hardships they have faced. Arabella Sours loses three children to diphtheria, Theoline Belknap kills her own child after a poor harvest puts her family at risk of starvation, and Gro Svendsen, a Danish immigrant, is in an abusive relationship with her husband and breaks down after her mother dies. Reverend Dowd calls upon one of their husbands to escort the women eastward to a church in Hebron, Iowa that cares for the mentally ill. Mr. Belknap refuses to participate in the lottery to determine who will escort the women; Cuddy takes his place, and the lot falls on her.\nWhile preparing for her journey, Cuddy encounters George Briggs, a claim jumper, who has been left on horseback with a noose around his neck for stealing Bob Giffen's land while he is away. Scared to make the trip alone, she frees him, and in return demands his help escorting the women. He immediately casts doubt on the job and insists he be free to abandon her at any time. To persuade him, Cuddy tells him that she is mailing $300 to await his arrival in Iowa, but she secretly keeps it with her.\nBriggs's experience comes in handy when the group crosses paths with hostile Pawnee, and he is able to bribe them by giving up Dorothy, Cuddy's horse. Later, when Arabella is kidnapped by a freighter, Briggs gives chase, and the two men scuffle before Arabella kills her kidnapper. Eventually the caravan comes across the grave of an 11-year-old girl that has been desecrated by Indians, and Cuddy insists they stop and restore it. Briggs vows to push on, so Cuddy stays behind and agrees to catch up with him. After restoring the grave, Cuddy sets out on horseback. However, she loses her way, and after riding all night discovers that she has gone in a circle, and her horse has led her back to the grave.\nFinally catching up to Briggs after another night of riding, Cuddy, distraught over having to wander the prairie, suggests they marry. Briggs, like all the previous men, rejects Cuddy, calling her \"plain\" and saying he \"ain't no farmer\" and is only along for the promised reward. Later that night, a naked Cuddy propositions him, and despite his initial protestations, the two have sex. Rising late the next morning, Briggs finds that Cuddy has hanged herself. Briggs chastises Sours, Belknap and Svendsen, blaming their illness for Cuddy's death as he buries her body. He discovers that she had kept the $300 with her the entire time, and so takes a horse and abandons the three women.

They notify her that she has been transferred and will be relocated to her native Italy in two months, separating her from Jude. Upon learning of the impending transfer, Jude is deeply upset, and later in the day initiates a sexual encounter. Against Mina\u2019s wishes, Jude ejaculates inside of her, and Mina later discovers she is pregnant. Jude and Mina are married at a beachside cafe. After the reception, a man shoots a deer on the boardwalk outside. Mina is distraught after witnessing the unnecessary and careless death of an animal, and is bothered by recurring nightmares about it.\nAs the pregnancy begins, Mina fails to maintain a stable diet.

The couple return home, where Mina expresses a distrust of modern medicine. She decides to employ only alternative medicine, going so far as to visit a psychic who informs Mina that her fetus is an Indigo child. Trusting her maternal instincts, Jude does not initially intervene in Mina\u2019s self-inflicted undernourishment and shunning of western treatment options.\nMina continues to undernourish herself and her unborn child, and when it is time for her to give birth, contractions do not begin due to her malnourishment.

Jude is suspicious of Mina, who takes the baby away after every meal.

Jude finds excuses throughout each day to take the infant outside and feed him in secret. While visiting, Jude\u2019s mother becomes aware of the situation and urges Jude to take action. He visits a lawyer, who advises him to take the infant somewhere he can be safe, and obtains a court order prohibiting Mina from being the child\u2019s primary caretaker.\nWhile Mina is distracted, Jude gives the baby boy to his mother, who takes provisional care of him while Mina is meant to recuperate.

Powell is frustrated to learn corporate security man Spencer will be joining them, but Healy insists.  As the mercenaries approach the bunker, they are nearly discovered by a scout on a motorcycle.  After taking cover in what they suspect to be a minefield, they press on.  The bunker itself is fortified by many militia members.  Harris and Williams attempt to infiltrate the camp.  When Williams' Russian accent does not seem to be convincing the camp's guards, Harris improvises a drunken, anti-Russian rant in Georgian.  As the other mercenaries grow tense, the leader of the camp responds well and allows Williams and Harris to enter.\nWilliams and Harris take control of the base's security system and remotely guide the rest of the team to the underground bunker.

Irvine says the Soviets, though cutting edge in other sciences, fell behind in genetic engineering.  When they discovered what they believed to be extraterrestrial DNA in a meteorite, they lured her with promises of completely unfettered research.  Free of any ethical or legal restraints, she created two hybrid alien-human creatures.  The hybrids, though only several years old, have reached sexual maturity, and she has bred them. Reasoning that they are unintelligent, she plans to sacrifice the female's life to grow a purer specimen, as their physiology precludes the female from surviving a pregnancy.  Enraged by Irvine's callousness to the female's suffering, Steinmann kills the female out of mercy.\nHealy demands that Powell kill Irvine now that she and her work have become useless.  When Powell refuses, Mason assaults him and reveals that he and Harris have already struck a bargain with Healy.

He sends a group of demons led by his most formidable warrior, Zuriel, to attack the gargoyles' cathedral and capture Adam so he can unlock the secret to resurrecting the dead.\nIn the attack, many demons are slain and 16 gargoyles, including Ophir and Keziah, are \"ascended\" (returned to and trapped in Heaven), but Zuriel sneaks in and captures Leonore and takes her to an abandoned theater. Adam interrogates a demon who tells him that they lured the gargoyles out in order to capture Leonore so they can force the gargoyles to trade Adam for her. Gideon is instructed to trade Adam to them; however, Adam escapes after the attack. Without Adam, Gideon instead offers to trade Frankenstein's journal for Leonore, which was found on Doctor Victor Frankenstein's body on the night they found him. At the theater, Gideon gives Zuriel the journal and Leonore is spared. Adam follows Zuriel to the Wessex Institute, where he discovers thousands of corpses underground and learns that Naberius plans to recreate Frankenstein's experiment by reanimating the corpses and using them as hosts for the descended demons so he can rebuild his armies and destroy humanity. Adam retrieves the journal from Terra and escapes the demons. He later tracks down Terra and asks for her help. The two are then attacked by Zuriel, where Adam fights him and manages to descend him.\nAdam warns the remaining gargoyles of Naberius' plan, agreeing to give them the journal if they get him and Terra to safety. Leonore agrees and when Adam leaves, she secretly sends Gideon to kill him after he retrieves the journal. After a violent fight, Adam ascends Gideon and then decides to burn Frankenstein's journal and destroy its secrets before the gargoyles come after him. Luring them out of the cathedral, Adam leads them to the Wessex Institute, where they descend Naberius's right-hand man Dekar and then battle more demons. In the ensuing battle, Adam goes into the institute to rescue Terra, who had been kidnapped by Naberius and forced to begin the process of reanimating the corpses. Naberius overpowers Adam and tries to have one of the demon spirits possess him, but it doesn't work because Adam has developed a soul of his own. Adam carves the Gargoyle Order symbol on Naberius, descending him to Hell. The institute collapses and falls into an abyss, where all the demons and all the possessed corpses are destroyed and Naberius' plan is thwarted. Leonore rescues Adam and Terra from falling into the abyss as well and they return to the cathedral.\nLeonore forgives Adam for Gideon's death and Adam bids farewell to Terra. In the ending scene, Adam narrates that he will continue defending the world from demons as he declares himself \u201cFrankenstein.\u201d", "tmdb_id": 100241}, "45221732": {"title": "I'm Obsessed with You", "plot": "When a magnetic movie star crashes their party the day before graduation, four collegiate comedians are forced to confront the group's friendship and future.", "tmdb_id": 298448}, "43217503": {"title": "Ice Cream (2014 film)", "plot": "Renu (Tejaswi Madivada) is a rich girl, who lives alone in a huge bungalow that she recently moved into instead of going to her cousin's wedding.

After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.\nYears later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam Wilde, a popular student and up-and-coming rockstar, peeks in on her playing. This leads him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her.

During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.\nIn 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund the construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.\nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives from the same German coder, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. One German coder always opens his first message with a standard plaintext German script. That reveals enough of the day's Enigma code that Christopher can quickly decode all the day's messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. They learn a convoy is about to be attacked, but Turing realises that if they suddenly reroute the convoy and attack the U-boats, the Germans will realize Enigma is compromised and change the machinery. Therefore, the team at Bletchley Park cannot act on every decoded message. Turing creates a statistical model to indicate which warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize discovery.\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a homosexual. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills.  Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she will undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions.  After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work, because MI6 wants governments to think they had unbreakable code machines. He tells the team that they should never see one another again or share what they have done.\nIn 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes chemical castration so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.\nThe epilogue reveals that after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing committed suicide on June 7, 1954.

Carlos demands to see a warrant. Marco admits he does not have one and attempts to take them to the police station at gunpoint.\nThe brothers overpower Marco and flee down their apartment complex's stairwell. While chasing them, Marco shoots Carlos in the leg but seems surprised by his own action. They are then startled by a loud explosion in the distance just before they realize that the stairs turn out to be endless, looping in on themselves. As Marco goes through the items in his wallet, he finds a miniature playing card he does not recognize. He tears the tiny card into pieces and does not pay it any further attention. Oliver applies first aid to his brother but can only watch as Carlos bleeds to death the next day.\nBefore he dies, Carlos urges Oliver to appreciate the present, something he could never do. As Oliver mourns Carlos' death, Marco becomes shaken when he sees that a vending machine on the stairwell has become restocked, precisely as it was 24 hours ago. Enraged by Marco's callousness, Oliver disarms him and threatens to kill him with his pistol. Marco insists that he did not consciously choose to shoot Carlos and the two argue over the metaphysics of their situation.\nElsewhere, Sandra and her two children, Daniel and Camila, prepare to visit her ex-husband.

On the way, they stop at a gas station where Roberto carelessly offers fruit juice to Camila, who has an allergic reaction to it and slowly starts having an asthma attack.

He says he now understands why they are stuck. The elderly Roberto and Marco reveal to the younger Daniel and Oliver, respectively, that none of this is real, but rather an alternate dimension to their real lives. Roberto explains that when he was a 10-year old boy, he was in another incident stuck on a raft (made of green bamboo) for thirty-five years. At the same time, the elderly Marco explains that he is really Daniel, the 10-year old boy from the incident of the infinite road, thus explaining the cycle of incidents and new dimensions.\nThese alternate dimensions split off from reality and form a time loop.

Ex-NASA pilot Joseph Cooper is forced to work as a farmer. One day, Cooper experiences a gravitational \"anomaly\" in his daughter Murph's bedroom. He deduces it to be a pattern of GPS coordinates and arrives at a secret NASA facility headed by Professor Brand. Brand explains to Cooper that it is engaged in a secret mission to discover an exoplanet capable of supporting life and that he is working on a gravity-equation. He enlists Cooper's help to pilot an exploratory spacecraft with three other scientists - Romilly, Doyle, and Brand\u2019s daughter Amelia. The crew travels through a wormhole on board the Endurance to pass through to another galaxy. Their mission is to investigate three planets, orbiting a supermassive black hole called Gargantua, each of which was previously explored by a NASA scientist-explorer.  \nThe first planet is an aqua planet. The NASA explorer there is found dead, and one of their crew - Doyle - drowns after being caught in a massive tidal wave. The same tide also causes the probe's engines to be filled with water, forcing Cooper and Amelia to wait for them to dry out. They return to the Endurance in an hour, finding that 23 years have passed aboard due to the time dilation caused by the planet's proximity to Gargantua. In those 23 years, Murph has become a scientist, and begun working with Brand at NASA. She learns from a dying Professor Brand that he had given up on solving his gravity-equation, knowing that information is needed from inside a black hole. Instead, he put their mission's hopes on Cooper's team establishing a space colony using pre-fertilized eggs on a new habitable planet. \nAt the second planet, the crew find its explorer, Mann, to be alive and awaken him from cryostasis. He eventually reveals to Cooper that he lied about the planet's habitability in the hope that NASA sent a mission to rescue him. Romilly dies in an explosion when he attempts to access the system's logs, while Mann tries to kill Cooper and hijack the Endurance spacecraft. Mann is killed when his craft fails to dock properly, and Cooper regains command of the Endurance. Cooper realizes that the Endurance only has enough resources for one person to safely complete their mission. He initiates a slingshot move around Gargantua, setting it to use gravity and be propelled to the final planet. At the last minute, he sacrifices himself by detaching from the spaceship and falling into the black hole, so that Amelia might safely complete the mission. \nCooper survives and finds himself inside a five-dimensional tesseract, out of view from beyond the event horizon. From inside he can see moments in time from inside Murph's childhood bedroom. He finds her returning to look for clues to the gravity-equation, and he contacts her by manipulating items in the room with gravity to communicate through Morse code. Deducing that this construct has been created by future humans with the ability to time-travel, Cooper imparts to her the information she needs. With his mission completed, he is ejected by the future beings, who return him to the Solar System. He is reunited with a now elderly Murph, who he learns has used the gravity-equation to lead humanity's exodus from Earth. She advises him to seek out Amelia, and he sets off.

The broadcast is interrupted by news reports about North Korea concerning its leader Kim Jong-un and the nuclear weapons. After Skylark and his crew celebrate producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticizes the show as not being a real news program. He voices his concern to Skylark, urging change. Skylark agrees and later discovers that Kim Jong-un is a fan of their show, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Traveling to the outskirts of Dandong, China, to receive instructions from the North Korean chief propagandist Sook-yin Park, Rapaport accepts the interview on behalf of Skylark.\nFollowing Rapaport's return, CIA agent Lacey shows up, requesting they assassinate Kim with a transdermal strip of ricin via handshake to prevent the country from launching a nuclear missile at the West Coast; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the strip inside a pack of gum. Upon arrival in Pyongyang, they are greeted by Sook and taken to the palace. They are introduced to Kim's personal security officers Koh and Yu who are immediately suspicious of the duo; when Koh finds the strip, he chews it mistaking it for gum. After making a secret request for help, Lacey airdrops them two more strips via an UAV, but to get it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a Siberian tiger and hide the container in his rectum before getting caught by security.\nThe next day, Skylark meets Kim and spends the day playing basketball, hanging out, riding in his personal tank and partying with escorts. Kim convinces Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At a state dinner, Koh has a seizure from the ricin poisoning, accidentally shooting Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty, discarding one of the ricin strips and thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After a dinner mourning the deaths of the bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious self as he threatens war against South Korea, the West and everyone who tries to undermine him. Skylark leaves and discovers that a nearby grocery store is fake, realizing Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempt to seduce Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip on his hand), Sook reveals she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark returns and tries to get Sook's support to assassinate Kim, but she disagrees, suggesting to instead ruin his cult of personality and show the North Korean people the dire state of the country. The trio secretly devise a plan to expose him on air and arm themselves with guns. Before the broadcast begins, Kim gives Skylark a puppy as a symbol of their friendship.\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's food shortage and US-imposed economic sanctions) and challenges his need for his father's approval. Meanwhile, Sook and Rapaport take over the control booth to fend off Kim's guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably, soiling himself after Skylark sings \"Firework\" by Katy Perry (knowing of Kim's fondness of her music), ruining his reputation. Enraged at Skylark's betrayal, Kim shoots him and vows to get revenge by launching the nuclear missile. Skylark, whose bulletproof vest saves him, regroups with Rapaport and Sook to escape (alongside the puppy) with the help of a guard. The trio hijacks Kim's tank to get to their pickup point, killing several more guards in the process. Kim chases the group in a helicopter but is shot down and killed by Skylark before he can issue the command to launch the missile.\nWith the missile launch thwarted, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route, explaining that she has to return to Pyongyang to maintain security.

While en route, another round of tornadoes form and encircle Pete's team, in the process destroying a residential neighborhood and a car lot. An explosion turns one of the tornadoes into a firenado, which Jacob the cameraman tries to film, only to be caught up in the storm and killed. This causes friction in the team, as Pete's concern seems to be more on collecting data than ensuring his team's safety. After recovering their vehicles, Allison leaves with Gary to continue their trip to the paper mill.\nAt the mill, a water pipe abruptly breaks and begins to flood the hole in which the two students are trapped.

In an attempt to save lives, Pete hands over his research hard drives to Gary, then sacrifices himself by leaving the shelter to move Titus down to the storm grate, to use the vehicle to anchor the storm grate to the concrete face. Titus's equipment proves unable to anchor the vehicle to the ground, and the tornado picks up the vehicle.

Rohit accepts the challenge and goes to Portugal to study colonial history.\nTwo years pass. Mahamaya is now a radio jockey at a popular radio station. Rohit is in Portugal but still very much in love with her. His Bengali is being refined by his friend and classmate Bodhi (Abir Chatterjee). Rohit chooses the music course and decides to do a dissertation on the 19th Century folk poet Hensman Anthony(Anthony Firingee). He goes to Calcutta and then to Farashdanga, Chandannagar, where Anthony lived and composed his songs. He goes to the local library to get some books where he meets the assistant librarian, a mysterious man named Kushal Hajra (Prosenjit Chatterjee), who claims to be the re-incarnation of Anthony himself. Kushal laments that the visions of his previous life are haunting him every day, and slowly taking over the memory of his present life. Rohit promises to take him to Calcutta for treatment, in return he demands the life history of Anthony.\nThe story then goes back to the 19th Century, where Anthony impresses the villagers with his musical talent. He saves a young Bengali widow, Soudamini, from performing sati and later marries her. But he yearns to learn the Bengali language and compose songs in that language. He learns it, reading Hindu scriptures and understanding the meaning of the folk compositions. In those days, kavigaans were very popular in Calcutta, where two kaviyaals or folk poets would face each other with their respective groups and compete with each other through songs and poems. Anthony was impressed by the kavigaans and decided to form a group on his own. He used to compose the songs himself, and on the first occasion met the woman kaviyaal, Joggeshwari (Ananya Chatterjee), whom he defeats. Slowly, as he began to progress in his career as a kaviyaal, he competed with noted kaviyaals of the time like Ram Basu (Sujan Mukherjee) and Thakur Singha (Biswajit Chakraborty).\nSimultaneously, in the present timeline, Kushal is taken to a psychiatrist, where he is informed that to stop the visions, he must complete a work which he could not possibly do as Anthony. Kushal's visions get stronger and stronger. Rohit meanwhile has found a way to sing his latest Bengali composition in front of Mahamaya, whose radio company has decided to organize a competition among bands hailing both from West Bengal and Bangladesh, \"Bandemonium\". Bodhi, who meanwhile had come to Calcutta to meet Rohit, takes him to Sidhu (playing himself) to arrange musicians for Rohit's performance. Meanwhile, Mahamaya had also started developing feelings for Rohit.\nKushal reveals to Rohit the story of Anthony's last kavigaan. Anthony had been planning to do a Durga-puja all by himself. But the villagers were against this, as, to them, Anthony is a firingee (foreigner) who had no right to perform a Hindu puja. He tells Soudamini that he is going to Calcutta for another kavigaan, and so won't be staying during the days of the puja. As planned, he leaves for Calcutta on the day of the puja. This time, his competition is with the best kaviyaal, Bhola Moira (Kharaj Mukherjee). The competition heightens and Anthony wins after a tough fight.\nIn the present timeline, the day of \"Bandemonium\" has arrived. Rohit goes on stage and performs his Bengali song E Tumi Kemon Tumi as Mahamaya looks on, tears in her eyes. Within the song, the film goes back to the 19th Century. After Anthony returned from Calcutta, victorious against Bhola Moira, he finds his house and his durga idol set on fire by the villagers. He finds Soudamini dead and nobody around. With his love killed and his faith shattered, he digs a grave for her, and then for himself (as he had once promised jokingly to his wife).\nDuring the show, Bodhi brings Kushal to the auditorium to see the performance of Rohit. Kushal meets Mahamaya, and then leaves abruptly. After the performance, Rohit and Mahamaya profess their love for each other backstage. Rohit suddenly is informed that Kushal is missing. He, along with Mahamaya, goes to Kushal's house in Chandannagar, where they find him completely insane and lost in his visions. He attacks Rohit and then blabbers rubbish. Rohit, heartbroken, leaves with Mahamaya, realising that Kushal is beyond cure now. The film then ends with a final twist, revealing Mahamaya as the reincarnation of Soudamini, though she remembers nothing of her previous birth. Anthony had wanted to apologize to his wife for leaving her alone to get killed by the neighbours, which Kushal does after Mahamaya leaves with Rohit. The visions will not haunt him anymore.

Addressing Jessie by her full name, she congratulates her on her 18th birthday and gives a tarot reading about Death that tells of a transition, taught to her by a friend whom she met at a local church. Kate warns that an unwanted presence is haunting Jessie, a reading that turns out to be true, as Jessie feels that a gaunt black-haired woman (Amber Stevens) is haunting her ever since she moved back into her father's house. Jessie also has a vivid dream where she is strapped to a bed by her mother and witnesses a voodoo ritual being conducted, where blood flowing into a breathing machine chokes her.

Thinking that Moses may be involved in the supernatural occurrences, the two head to Moses' voodoo shrine in a ruined church, but are attacked by a group of men who force them to leave.\nThe two return to Jessie's home where Preston confesses that, despite being married, he is in love with Jessie. Preston offers to let Jessie live with his mother, which she accepts. Just before Jessie can finish her packing; Preston is attacked by the ghostly woman and knocked unconscious.\nNow left alone, Jessie conducts a ritual to summon the woman. After the ritual, Jessie is called by Pruitt, who informs her that the baby was Kate's daughter, but not Leon's. She plays the blank tape where it presents Kate casting a voodoo enchantment on a newborn white girl and committing suicide by gunshot, not before tearfully shouting that Jessabelle and her father Moses are dead, attempting to suffocate the infant girl with a pillow, and changing her mind to conduct the incantation. Jessie is confronted by Kate's spirit and realizes the truth that her \"father\" was hiding from her: the video tapes filmed were for Jessabelle, who was the daughter of Kate and Moses as the product of an interracial affair at the same church mentioned in the second tape. Jessabelle was killed on the night of her birth, along with her father, by Leon. On that night, Leon scolded Kate for being unfaithful, picked up Jessabelle from her crib and snapped her spine in half. After Kate laments as she holds her daughter's now-lifeless body, Leon pushed a baby carriage carrying her lifeless body and a porcelain doll inside into the bayou, weighing it down with stones to prevent it from resurfacing. Leon then drove up to Kate and Moses' church where he shot Moses and set the building ablaze, leaving Moses for dead in the burning church. Jessie realizes that she is the unwanted presence, being the newborn white girl adopted by Leon on that same night to cover up the murders.\nSwearing revenge, Kate and Moses planned to transfer Jessabelle's spirit to Jessie.

Reluctantly taking charge as ACP of Madurai City East, Shakthi gives free rein to Sivan and his henchmen, who wreak havoc over Madurai, until one of their activities inadvertently causes a gas leak which destroys a school and some nearby buildings, killing several people, including women and children. The incident, along with the assault of a woman by Sivan's henchmen when she had come to the police station to lodge a complaint against Sivan for killing her husband, causes Shakthi to take up the path of an honest and upright police officer. \nShakti thrashes Sivan's henchmen who assaulted the woman. Shakthi's new persona is not liked by Sivan and after a heated argument between the two, he disowns Shakthi. A cat-and-mouse game then begins between Sivan and Shakthi, with Sivan and his henchmen, determined to humiliate Shakthi at every opportunity, while Shakthi, assisted by Shanthi and Gopal, tries to rid Sivan's influence in Madurai. Shakthi is soon promoted to the rank of DCP for his efforts. Later, Shakthi finds out that Sivan's other adopted son, a minister Aadhi Kesavan is plotting to kill Sivan in revenge for Sivan killing his police officer father (the same police officer who killed Shakthi's father) in his childhood. \nSince Shakthi had inadvertently thwarted his earlier plans to kill Sivan, he also plans to get Shakthi killed at the hands of Sivan by killing Sivan's son Vignesh and putting the blame on Shakthi for Vignesh's death. Unfortunately for Aadhi, Sivan learns about his plan and reconciles with Shakti, where they fight Aadhi's henchmen and Aadhi. Shakthi beats up Aadhi and gives him to Sivan to kill. Sivan gives Aadhi a choice to kill himself. Aadhi takes up the choice and slits his throat thereby killing him.

In the ensuing space battle, Robin purposely crashes Batman's Batwing jet into the satellite array. Refusing to accept defeat, Captain Cold overloads the remaining satellite, which falls back to Earth and entombs Luthor in an ice sheet shortly before the satellite explodes. The League is triumphant and believes Luthor to be dead.\nIn the utopian future of the 31st century, teenage superheroes-in-training Dawnstar and Karate Kid are visiting a museum dedicated to the exploits of the Justice League.

Karate Kid accidentally releases Luthor from the ice. Luthor awakes nearly 1,000 years into the future; he explores the museum, discovers Superman's secret identity and locates an ancient item called the Eternity Glass, which allows its user to manipulate the fabric of time and space.

The young heroes realize that they can induce their own paradox by ensuring Lex Luthor's past counterpart never traveled to the 31st century so he could not steal the Eternity Glass and return to the past. The young heroes discover Luthor's confinement with Dawnstar's tracking ability, where Karate Kid breaks the ice and frees Luthor's earlier self. However, the Time Trapper is immune to the paradox because he exists outside the timeline, and with Luthor's counterpart freed, Time Trapper is  at liberty to do as he pleases because Luthor is no longer his master.\nThe Time Trapper banishes the future Luthor from existence and tries to remake the current world in his image.

When Hank receives news his mother has just died, the judge grants his case a continuance. Before returning to his hometown of Carlinville, Indiana to attend the funeral, Hank argues with his neglected, unfaithful wife, Lisa, whom he is divorcing.\nIn Carlinville, Hank reunites with his older brother, Glen, a tire shop owner, and his mentally disabled younger brother Dale. Hank's estranged father is Judge Joseph Palmer of Carlinville's criminal court, who he merely calls \"Judge.\" The two have been estranged due to the Judge's harsh treatment of his son in light of his youthful indiscretions, including a car accident when Hank was seventeen that had ruined Glen's future MLB career and resulted in his father sending Hank to juvenile detention rather than the recommended community service or otherwise helping his son.\nFrom the courtroom gallery, Hank discreetly watches his father presiding a case. During the proceedings, the Judge seems momentarily confused when he is unable to recall his long-time bailiff's name. The morning after the funeral, Hank notices the Judge's car has the right-front headlight and fender damaged and accuses his father, a recovered alcoholic, of driving intoxicated. The Judge reacts defensively, having no memory of an accident. Hank's strained family relationship is further complicated by his former girlfriend, Sam Powell. He comes to believe her law school-student daughter Carla, that he had earlier flirted with, may be his daughter. Sam reveals Glen is Carla's father, having briefly slept with him when Hank unexpectedly left Carlinville.\nThe next day, after arguing with his father, Hank vows never to return to Carlinville and leaves for the airport. Just before Hank's flight takes off, Glen calls to say their father is a suspect in a fatal hit and run accident. The victim, Mark Blackwell, is a recently released ex-convict whom Judge had sentenced to twenty years in prison for a murder that he had committed after the Judge had earlier given Blackwell a light sentence for shooting up the victim's house.\nJudge is indicted after police forensics confirm Blackwell's blood is on the Judge's Cadillac. He is charged with second-degree murder. C.P. Kennedy is hired as the Judge's defense attorney. When his defense proves ineffective, Hank takes over as lead counsel. While preparing for trial, Hank learns his father is undergoing chemotherapy for terminal cancer. The Judge's inability to remember the accident or previously recall his bailiff's name may be a side effect of chemotherapy. During this time, Hank's daughter, Lauren, arrives for a short visit, meeting her grandfather for the first time and bonding with him.\nAt the trial, Judge, honor-bound to his ethical responsibility, insists on testifying. He scuttles his own defense by testifying he is unable to remember the accident, but believes he may have intentionally killed Blackwell. Hank pushes the Judge until he reveals that he had previously given Blackwell a lighter sentence, the biggest mistake of his career, because Blackwell's circumstances had reminded the Judge of Hank and he'd seen the troubled son that the Judge had refused to help in the young man. Judge is convicted on a lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in the Indiana State Prison.\nSeven months later, Hank returns to Carlinville. Judge has been granted a compassionate release, allowing him to die at home. Fishing on a lake, Hank and Judge appear to have buried their mutual animosity.

Rana grows up, where he trains in weaponry, and be a fearless warrior. Due to his fighting skills and bravery, he soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri, Raja Mahendran, who promotes him as Commander-in-chief of the Kalingapuri army. The son of Raja Mahendran, Veera Mahendran shows Rana around the kingdom's mine where the captured soldiers of Kottaipattinam work as slaves. Veera says that this information is known only to a few people. After this, Rana promotes a war strategy to Veera that they release the slaves and have them trained in the army of Kalingapuri. Veera agrees and the slaves are freed. He then gets Raja Mahendran's approval to attack Kottaipattinam. However, during the war, Rana encounters his childhood friend, crown prince Sengodagan, the son of Rishikodagan, king of Kottaipattinam. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that the main motive of Rana's plan was to free the soldiers of Kottipattinam. Immediately signalling an end to the war, he, along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam, much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and his son, crown prince Veera Mahendran, who swear revenge on Rana for tricking them and betraying Kalingapuri.\nAt Kottaipattinam, Rana and Sengodagan renew their friendship. Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan, who is alarmed about seeing him. Rana also reunites with his younger sister Yamuna Devi whom he last saw as a baby and their uncle, who raised her, but soon learns that his mother Yaaghavi is dead and Sena is missing. He soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other. He accepts their relationship and decides to get them married. He cleverly convinces Rishikodagan, who is unwilling to get his son married to Yamuna since she is a commoner. Meanwhile, Rana also rekindles his love with his childhood sweetheart, princess Vadhana Devi, the daughter of Rishikodagan. Soon, Sengodagan and Yamuna get married. But following the wedding, Rishikodagan disowns Sengodagan.\nThat night, a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan. Vadhana immediately goes after him, fights him, and gets him captured. Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana, and immediately throws him into prison, sentencing him to death. An upset Vadhana rushes to the cell where Rana is imprisoned, where Rana tells her why he attempted to kill Rishikodagan. Rana tells Vadhana that he is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan, the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam's army. Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for his bravery and is more popular than Rishikodagan himself.\nDue to this, Rishikodagan becomes jealous of Kochadaiiyaan. One night, when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with his army after buying horses and ammunition, they are attacked by the rival army of Kalingapuri. Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry. However, the Kalingapuri army, before leaving, poisons the food on the ship. The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food, and fall ill. Despite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army, Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself, because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers. He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers. Raja Mahendran, in turn, cunningly proposes a deal that, if he wants his men to be saved, he has to leave all the horses, ammunition, and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as slaves. Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this, his soldiers will be nursed back to health. Kochadaiiyan thinks that his men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning, and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future, all of them could be easily rescued. So he accepts Raja Mahendran's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone. When he returns to Kottaipattinam, the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences him to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam because of surrendering his army men, horses, and ammunition to Kalingapuri.\nThough all his subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death, and his wife Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for his injustice, Rishikodagan stands firm in his decision. Kochadaiiyaan is beheaded the following morning before Rana's eyes. In present, Rana tells Vadhana that he ran away to Kalingapuri, with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing his father. Vadhana is shocked on hearing about her father's actions and reconciles with Rana. She then pleads with her father to release Rana, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Rana escapes from the prison. When Rishikodagan learns of Rana's escape, he immediately arranges for Vadhana's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that his life is at Rana's mercy. Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, he arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue him. On the day of the marriage, Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place. He and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming a traitor and surrendering the whole kingdom of Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for his own personal interests and commitments, which was the same charge that Rishikodagan had placed on Kochadaiiyaan years ago.\nFollowing this, a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms and along with a majority of Kottaipattinam's army, he kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as he was defeated, reminding him of their friendship. He then fights Rishikodagan and beheads him. Finally, as Rana and Vadhana reunite, a young soldier comes towards them riding a horse.

So the poet begins to write his first works, reflecting on the human condition, coming to the conclusion that unhappiness is a constant factor of human existence, and that in life there is no remedy for this problem. In the 1820s, Leopardi can finally leave his native Recanati, and begin to travel to Rome and Florence where, however, his high expectations of intellectual rewards and public recognition are not achieved. He suffered from repeated instances of unrequited love: that he chiefly felt towards the Countess Fanny Targioni Tozzetti, contributing to Leopardi's negative view of life and human experience. He finally moves to Naples, where a physical affliction results in his premature death.", "tmdb_id": 283704}, "35657709": {"title": "Leprechaun: Origins", "plot": "A young couple, Catherine and Francois, are attempting to escape from a figure who eventually catches and drags Francois to his death. It also grabs hold of Catherine just before she arrives at a monolith in a grassland.\nFour American college friends, Sophie, Ben, Jeni, and David are vacationing in the Irish countryside at Sophie's behest. The driver, Ian, lets them go at the monolith seen in the beginning. Sophie, who is a history bachelor, takes note of the monolith's symbol before heading to a local bar with the others, where they meet with a friendly old man, Hamish, who tells them about the history of the village: it was formerly a mining center for gold obtained in a nearby cavern, but when the gold ran out, the population dwindled. The four agree to be taken to a cottage where they can begin hitchhiking to the cavern, though they are wary of Hamish and his grumpy son, Sean.\nThat night, Jeni investigates a ruckus outside and glimpses a figure sprinting past the window. She wakes the others, who discover that Hamish and Sean had locked them up. A figure suddenly enters the cottage through the fireplace and forcibly takes Jeni's gold earring. After a brief struggle which sees David's leg being bitten by the monster, the four escape the cottage and race to the village hall, where they hide in the cellar. From a mythology book, Sophie learns that the monster is a Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, also known as a leprechaun, who owns the gold that the villagers sought after. Hamish and the villagers refused to return the gold and didn't want to leave the village. In return for the gold, the villagers have to sacrifice at least two humans each year as \"compensation\". The leprechaun lusts after gold, but it can be repelled by a certain symbol, the same one carved into the monolith, which serves as a barrier beyond which the being cannot get out. There was another monolith symbol barrier at the leprechaun's cave; however, when the villagers mined the cave and took the gold, the cave collapsed, causing the leprechaun to escape 15 years ago. Hamish and Sean are joined by their friend Ian outside, where Hamish tells him of his suspicions of his son becoming disillusioned with their sacrifice plot.\nThe four are confronted by Hamish, who confirms that the villagers sacrifice tourists each year to avoid having to sacrifice themselves, and Sean, who has grown weary of the unjustified sacrifices, eventually lets them go, while Hamish finds Ian impaled on some farm equipment in a shed. He escapes as the creature kills Ian. The four take the offer to escape from an old woman, Mary, who is revealed to be Hamish's accomplice. The four are then tied to trees as offerings for the leprechaun. The monster arrives and rips out Jeni's golden tongue ring. David manages to get the leprechaun away from Jeni, but the beast slashes his torso, also cutting the rope, allowing him to break free and release the other three before he is attacked and killed. The remaining trio head back to the cottage to set a trap to kill the monster, but the leprechaun tricks Sophie and Ben into striking Jeni with their axes, killing her.\nSophie and Ben fetch Hamish's truck but are cornered by the leprechaun inside the village hall. The leprechaun eventually gets hold of Ben and kills him by ripping his spine out. Though cornered by Hamish, who is still intent on sacrificing her, Sophie is saved by Sean, who pushes Hamish into the cellar out of guilt for letting his father and the villagers sacrifice so many people over the years. The leprechaun kills Hamish in the cellar, much to Sean's devastation. Meanwhile, Sophie boards Hamish's truck but crashes midway while trying to avoid the leprechaun. She resumes her escape on foot, and when the leprechaun finds her, she distracts it with gold coins, then kills it using Francois' knife, which he had left in the prologue.

When the former refuses, Nagabhushan stabs him to death. The dying man throws a pen drive (disguised as a rudraksha) containing the details certifying the dam's integrity, into an abandoned Shiva temple near the dam and warns the village head Karunakaran, who arrives upon hearing his cries, that the temple has to be opened as soon as possible, before dying. Karunakaran firmly believes that the temple can only be opened by the descendant of Raja Lingeshwaran, an erstwhile king who built the dam as well as the temple. Lakshmi, the granddaughter of Karunakaran and a journalist, embarks on a search to find the descendant. She soon discovers the person - Lingeswaran aka Lingaa. Lingaa, the grandson of Raja Lingeshwaran, is a witty thief, living in poverty. He bears a grudge against his grandfather, firmly believing his \"squandering nature\" as the root cause of his poverty. Consequently, he refuses to accompany Lakshmi to Solaiyur.\nUndeterred, Lakshmi follows Lingaa and records his gang's act of stealing a priceless necklace and implicates them, thus forcing him to accompany her to Solaiyur. At Solaiyur, Lingaa receives a warm welcome from the villagers. Later, Karunakaran privately tells Lingaa that the Lingam installed at the Shiva temple is made of Emerald stone, an extremely valuable artifact. At midnight, he infiltrates the Shiva temple to steal the Lingam. Unfortunately, he is noticed by one of the dam's security guards, who immediately alert the villagers. Aware of their presence, Lingaa quickly and wittingly changes his act to an appearance of performing a pooja, thus fooling the villagers.  A relieved Karunakaran then narrates the true story of Lingaa's heritage.\nRaja Lingeshwaran, the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Kodiyur, is shown to be a civil services officer and the collector of Madurai district. Upon surveying the village of Solaiyur, he receives complaints from the local villagers, stating that they have no water for nine months per year while facing raging floods for the other three months - which has led to recurring and devastating famines. Determined to help, he petitions to construct a dam, for the benefit of Solaiyur. However, his plan is rejected at the annual collectors' meeting and he is instead forced to approve another infrastructure project. He refuses to do so and is blackmailed of being dismissed for his non-compliance. In defiance, Lingeshwaran resigns from his position.\nLater, several members of the Indian royalty and British officers congregate to celebrate Lingeshwaran's birthday. Among them is Collector Lawrence Hunter, the officer who had opposed Raja Lingeshwaran's plan. He is shocked to discover Lingeshwaran's real identity. Over dinner, Lingeshwaran notifies the British Governor of his resignation and expresses his wish to construct a dam at Solaiyur, with his capital. He requests approval from the British Government, which is granted. The Collector challenges Raja Lingeshwaran that he will never finish building the dam. Though Lingeshwaran faces multiple difficulties and a near stoppage of work due to caste issues (which were ignited by Sambandam, a resident shown to be working as a spy), the dam is constructed with the help of the villagers, who turn out to be very co-operative with Lingeshwaran. Bharathi, the daughter of a senior villager falls in love with Raja Lingeshwaran. Finally, the dam is almost complete, except for the shaft doors. The doors are found to be held in the collector's possession. With the floods soon to occur, Lingeshwaran negotiates with the collector and tries to persuade him to give in. As a dirty trick, the latter proposes that if the shaft doors are to be handed over, Lingeshwaran must hand over the villagers' land as a bribe and the credit for constructing the dam, to which he reluctantly agrees. Sambandam discreetly brings the villagers to the collector's residence at the same time and tricks them into believing that Lingeshwaran is a puppet of the British, thus manipulating them.\nAfter the dam's completion, the infuriated villagers reprimand Lingeshwaran for his \"malicious actions\" and banishes him from Solaiyur, despite Bharati's protests. Fully knowing the double-play behind him, Lingeshwaran leaves and is later accompanied by Bharati. The collector's wife, Jenny, disgusted at her husband's behavior, angrily reveals to the villagers that they have been double-crossed and reveals the real terms that Lingeshwaran had agreed to. The villagers, upon realizing their double play, pursue Sambandam, who commits suicide out of guilt. Jenny decides to leave with her daughter but is stopped by her husband, having realized his folly. Upon her insistence, he publicly declares that the dam was constructed by  Lingeshwaran. After a long search, the villagers find him and Bharathi, now his wife, living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince him to return to Solaiyur, the villagers resolve to keep the Shiva temple (which he had built), closed until the Raja or his descendants return to the village. Lingaa, on hearing his grandfather's story, changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways.\nIn the present, Karunakaran reveals that his invitation to Lingaa was merely a ruse, as he believes that danger is afoot; recalling the fate of the dam inspector. At a function, Nagabhushan reveals to an accomplice that he plans to drill small holes into the dam, which would be filled with explosives; when triggered, would destroy the dam. Lakshmi secretly records Nagabhushan's conversation with the help of a spy camera and plays it before the entire town, exposing Nagabhushan. Lingaa then reveals that he had already discovered the pen drive and had the dam's certificate approved, copied, and spread throughout the Internet; ultimately culminating in Nagabhushan being ousted from his position. Enraged, he kidnaps Lakshmi and escapes in a hot air balloon. Having a bomb with him, he plans to detonate it over the dam, to spite Lingaa. Lingaa pursues him on a bike and drives it over a ledge at the exact time Nagabhushan's balloon appears on it, landing on top of it; he manages to climb into the carriage. After an ensuing fight, he kicks Nagabhushan out, who plunges to his death in the water below and kicks the bomb into the reservoir, which explodes moments later, thus saving the dam. With his work done, Lingaa plans to leave. However, the police finally catch up to him, demanding that he testify for an inquiry (about his recent jewel heist).

Angela and Gordon warn him off; to their consternation, Molly leaves with Teddy, though she warns him that it is not a reconciliation.  She is only returning to the house, not to their relationship.  At the same time, Angela berates Gordon for not sticking up more for his sister.\nAt a bar, Gordon tells a friend that he wants Teddy dead.  His friend suggests a friend-of-a-friend, an ex-convict, may be willing to take the job cheap.  Gordon does not answer, and instead suggests they return to work.  There, at a supermarket, he runs into Teddy and Molly, who did not realize he had exchanged shifts.  After apologizing for his behavior, Teddy gives Gordon the opportunity to throw a punch at him.  Gordon awkwardly declines and once again tells his friend how he wishes Teddy were dead.  His friend offers to get the ex-con's number, and Gordon noncommittally agrees.  At their house, Angela again berates Gordon for not being assertive enough to ask for better pay.\nAt their house, Molly insists that Teddy move out, though she agrees to give him a chance to make amends in the form of a dinner date the following day.  She chooses a local restaurant, and they run into several of their friends, who are too embarrassed to comment on her battered appearance.  When Gordon receives the ex-con's phone number from his friend, he learns that the man, Howard, lives in Mississippi.  Howard insists that Gordon drive from Pennsylvania to his house to discuss the matter.  When Gordon arrives, Howard forces him to strip naked to prove he is not wired and accepts the job.\nAs they drive back, Gordon becomes increasingly worried about Howard's violent temperament and begins to have second thoughts.  At a roadside diner, Howard murders two people and tells Gordon that he will take his money one way or the other, but it's too late to back out of paying him.  After taunting Gordon with threats to murder him, Howard expounds on his philosophy: he sees his actions as affecting the survivors more than his victims, as the living are the ones who must deal with the grief of loss.  Meanwhile, Teddy and Molly slowly reconcile, and Molly allows him to move back into their house.\nGordon returns to Pennsylvania in time to join Teddy, Molly, and Angela for dinner.  The gathering is a disaster; after a cold reception, Angela demands that Teddy leave.  When Molly defends him, she and her mother tell each other off.  Teddy and Molly return to their house, where they have sex, and Molly presents Teddy with his missing wedding band.  As Teddy gratefully accepts it, he asks if she minds if he has a beer.  Molly agrees that it is harmless, and as he drinks it, they hear a knock at the door.  Howard shoots Teddy dead and walks away.  Stunned, Molly runs after him and attacks him.  After warning her, Howard shoots her dead, too.\nAfter attending his sister's funeral, Gordon returns to Mississippi and confronts Howard with his mother's shotgun.  Though Howard warns him that murder will change him, Gordon says that he is already living with the consequences of his actions.

When her friends see her, Liz bets one of them that she can have Eva in her bed within three days. At dinner, Eva discovers that these women all have something in common: they are lesbians. Almost all of them have had or are currently in relationships with one another, and some have kids from previous heterosexual relationships. This seemingly catches Eva by surprise, and it can be assumed that she hasn't had much interaction with homosexual people and has been heterosexual her whole life.\nEva seems to be more open minded than most people to the women's situation. They explain that they reside outside of town in order to escape the wary looks and slander from those in town. As relationships are being formed, an even deeper relationship forms between Eva and Liz. Part of this is because that Liz makes a bet with one of the other women that she can get Eva in bed with her within three days. Although this was Liz's initial motivation for getting close to Eva, it is clear that it slowly becomes replaced with true feelings for her. As they go on different adventures, Liz's secret, one that she has kept from everyone except for Dolores whom she had a very intimate relationship with, is revealed and it takes a toll on everyone involved: her cancer is back.

While trying to cope with her fear of not having left a memorable impact, she spends her time surrounded by her friends and Eva, who later reveals that she is pregnant and will name the child after Liz if it is a girl, which it turns out to be.

When the body of a murdered woman is found in that loft, the men begin to suspect each other of having committed the gruesome crime, as they are the only ones with keys to the premises. Through flashbacks, which are intertwined with scenes from the present, the story is unravelled.\nThe five men are: \n\nVincent Stevens: architect and designer of the building where the loft is situated. Married to Barbara and father of their children, he initially suggests the five friends use the loft as a private oasis. He is set up by the other men to be accused of the murder.\nDr. Chris Vanowen: a psychiatrist married to Allison and half-brother to Philip. Chris and Philip have a half-sister, Zoe. He is the most reluctant of the men to loft idea and the last to accept a key; Chris eventually does so because he is attracted to Ann, who eventually becomes his mistress. Ann warns Chris not to fall in love with her because she is a prostitute, and he gives her his key as proof he does not use the loft with other women.\nLuke Seacord: married to Ellie, who is an insulin-dependent diabetic. He discovers the body in the loft and initially calls Vincent and the others over. The police later insinuate that Luke is attracted to Vincent, and it is Luke who records the men's activities in the loft without their knowledge.\nMarty Landry: heavy drinker and an obvious lecherer. He and his wife Mimi separate when a woman Marty slept with on a business trip shows up at his home.\nPhilip Williams: half-brother to Chris as they have the same mother and recently married to Vicky, the only daughter of a wealthy property developer who is also Philip\u2019s boss. Philip is a drug user who grew up in a dysfunctional household with his abusive father and is very protective of his younger sister Zoe. He warns the other men off having sex with her.The murder victim is Sarah Deakins. Vincent, Luke, and Marty meet her at a bar and though both Vincent and Luke are attracted to her, she hooks up with Vincent and becomes attached to him. At a party Vincent and Luke are attending, Sarah threatens to tell Vincent's wife about the affair in a bid to break them up, but she is dissuaded from this by Luke. She seemingly tries to commit suicide at the loft by taking pills with champagne and is discovered by Luke, who calls Chris, Marty and Philip, showing them a note left for Vincent. The note reads \"See you in the next life\"; this note is taken from the loft by Chris.\nThe men were motivated to set Vincent up by Luke, who showed them DVDs of Vincent having sex with Marty's wife, Mimi; Chris's prostitute, Ann (whom Vincent had paid to allow Chris to seduce her, so that he would take a key to and use the loft), and Zoe, Philip and Chris's younger sister. Three of the men leave to set up their alibis, with Philip remaining at the loft to stage the scene. He takes some cocaine and cuts Sarah's wrists, using her bloodied finger to write a Latin phrase similar to that in her suicide note. He then handcuffs Sarah's right hand to the bed.\nOver the course of the movie, as the five men discuss what to do with the body, Luke, Chris, Marty, and Philip drug Vincent, strip and handcuff him to the body on the bed. Before Vincent passes out completely, Chris tells him about Sarah's suicide and the contents of her note. While being questioned by the police, Vincent tells them of the setup, but they do not believe him as the only prints found were Vincent's and Sarah's. They also have the DVDs of his sexual exploits, except the ones with Mimi, Ann, and Zoe; they won't believe him that Luke made the videos and the DVDs of the other men were not found. The police also mention that all four men have alibis for that morning \u2014 Chris and Luke were seen together having breakfast, Marty was at his office, Philip has an alibi from his father-in-law (who was blackmailed with information about his own cheating, information Philip had because he knew Vincent used that same information to blackmail his father-in-law to be awarded a contract on a project).\nReleasing Chris from interrogation, Detective Huggins tells him that Vincent has been arrested for murder; he is surprised as he thought Vincent would only be implicated in Sarah's suicide. The detective further states that the pills did not kill Sarah, that her wrist cuts were not self-inflicted, the prints on the knife were Vincent's and they didn't find a suicide note. The surprised Chris thanks Huggins and leaves. Outside the police station, he reaches into his jacket pocket, only to find that the suicide note Luke gave to him is gone. He then walks to the loft and confronts Luke about the missing note. After initially denying that he had it, Luke leads Chris to the note, which was in the garbage. Chris looks at the note and wonders why Luke would get rid of the only evidence of the attempted suicide, speculating that Luke, not Sarah, was the author of the note. Luke then tells Chris everything; he framed Vincent, because he was attracted to Sarah himself, and felt that Vincent stood between him and Sarah.\nWe see that Luke had gone after Sarah the night she almost told Vincent's wife about the affair. He told her that Vincent was using her and not worth it, and that he could treat her better. She rebuffs him, saying she felt nothing for Luke. Hurt, Luke turns around to find that his wife saw him talking to Sarah. When Sarah returned to visit Vincent at the loft, Luke showed up and drugged Sarah, trying to kill her \u2014 out of \"love\" \u2014 with an insulin overdose. He then staged the suicide with the pills, champagne bottle, and suicide note. Chris then tells him that Vincent is being charged with murder as Sarah hadn't been dead when they left her with Philip. Luke then states that technically it was Philip who killed Sarah and that he will clean the situation up. When Chris says no more cleaning up, Luke pulls out a kitchen knife and threatens him. Sirens can be heard and Chris says he called the police, told them everything and that it is over. He and Luke struggle, and he gets the knife from Luke. Luke tells Chris to tell Ellie and his family that he's sorry; he then jumps from the loft's balcony, killing himself.\nSix months later, Mimi and Marty are reconciled, Philip is facing trial for manslaughter, and Chris is divorced, sharing custody of his children. He runs into Ann after leaving a bar, and she asks if he needs the loft key, that he had given her for them to meet up. Chris mentions the key would not work as Vincent now lives at the loft, since it was all his wife left him with from their divorce. Chris mentions that he heard Ann left the city councilman, one of her clients as a prostitute, and she replies that he was not the only thing she gave up, implying that she's no longer in that line of work.

Then he asks her plainly \"Can I have sex with you?\" A shocked Malini is then brutally attacked and raped. When Varun finds out what happened, he becomes violent and wants to kill Prakash. Malini calms him down saying that she does not want to make the incident worse than it is; she instead wants to get to Canada at the earliest. Once Malini recovers from her injuries, Prakash visits her again to ask for forgiveness. He comes while Varun is not around and rapes her a second time. Malini decides not to travel abroad and plans to murder Prakash.\nVarun discusses the situation with Prakash, who suggests killing Malini and appoints Varun to do it. Varun traps her by putting some drugs in her bag. The police arrest Malini, and she is imprisoned. While Malini calls out for help, she finds Varun simply walking away from her, which is when she realizes he set her up. Varun relocates to Chennai and runs a modeling agency. While in prison, Malini meets Janaki, who is sentenced for murder. Through Janaki's criminal world connections, Malini realizes that Varun is a known pimp and was cheating her along with Prakash's support. Janaki and Malini bond well with each other, and Janaki moulds a criminal mindset within her for the strength and courage needed to strike back at Varun and Prakash.\nWhen the court sets her free, Malini, with the help of DK kills Prakash by poisoning him with a cobra. Next, she arrives in Chennai as a femme fatale in search of Varun while pretending to be a model. Later one night, Malini hooks up with Varun in his studio. Varun, who had recognized her earlier, reveals it angrily berates her. He beats her and abuses her by calling her a \"slut who does any 'adjustment' to flourish her career\" for stopping her further being a menace to him. But his frustration dissolves slowly as he wants to enjoy her company. He reminds her she is a mere woman.\nBut at night Malini executes her revenge plan and sedates Varun and sadistically penectomises him. When he regains consciousness she tells him that she has removed his male organ through a medical surgery. While Varun finds himself in intense pain and bound to his bed, she taunts him to make him realize his faults and the gross wrongs he committed to her and rationalizes her crime. But he doesn't yield to her taunts and reveals a backstory concerning his mother and that his life as a pimp is not entirely his fault.\nMalini tells Varun that she knows that she is still somewhere in his heart. She reminds him that she has only lost someone who cheated on her, whereas he lost someone who genuinely loved him. Now Varun is stunned that he is not even able to face Malini. Varun recollects that her love was true and his love was overshadowed by his male supremacy concept and greed for wealth. Over the days, he admits his actions that caused her pain. Then Malini leaves him but not before inviting him to settle the score with her, if any remains there. Varun accepts the challenge of a true criminal as he is and taunts her that he will confront her when he is ready, most probably knowing that he has to settle the score with her in terms of true love with roots in violence.

Although Rodrigo and his wife Roc\u00edo say that their daughters were average girls, the duo hear from the local police that they were known for their promiscuity, and from their friends that they had a deep urge to leave the town. Roc\u00edo also gives the detectives a burnt film reel she has found, depicting the girls naked and in bed with a man whose face is obscured by a flash. Soon enough, both Carmen and Estrella are found dead and dumped in the local marsh, having been raped and tortured to death.\nTroubled and with no leads, the two detectives attempt to spy on Quini, the handsome and suave former boyfriend of Carmen. Quini, now dating another town girl, Marina, manages to sneak up on the detectives after they have followed him and attempts to threaten them with a knife. After disarming and sending him away, the two agree that Quini must be part of whatever is occurring. The problem proves to be even bigger after a drunk man named Castro tells the detectives about a similar case: his girlfriend, Beatriz, was close to Quini and the sisters, and was found dismembered in the marshes, her suitcase floating there.\nPedro and Juan continue to investigate, gradually unravelling secrets. It is revealed that the riverboats and marshes are being used to smuggle and transport heroin, and that Rodrigo had stolen a kilo and sold it, getting him in trouble with the locals. However, the locals involved in the drugs seek out the detectives, revealing their participation in drug smuggling in full but claiming they had nothing to do with the sisters' deaths. One of the men does aid the investigation, however, by describing a white Dyane 6 he saw at the church where one of the girls' purse was found.

Juan and Pedro deduce that Quini and Sebasti\u00e1n were luring the young women of the town, who were aching to leave and find their own independence through work, by passing these brochures around and then entrapping them into sexual slavery at a local hunting lodge.\nWaters grow murky, however, when Pedro becomes aware of Juan's past shooting of a girl at a protest during the Franco Era. Pedro is also angered after a possible third culprit, a local factory owner named Alfonso Corrales, is brushed over, most likely due to complex political ties. The two continue on, though, eventually deducing Sebasti\u00e1n's cover as the watchman of the hunting lodge. Pedro attempts to follow and observe Sebasti\u00e1n's white Dyane 6, but loses him.

However, all plans go awry when Bharathi's jealous boss does not agree to her plan and conducts a raid for the trial transaction in the last moment.\nThe raid exposes Karthik's identity, who is taken to Chitti's place and gets tortured by Guru and his gang to reveal the identity of any other man working with him. Unable to bear the pain, Karthik reveals Arul's identity. Guru informs Chitti about Arul's true identity. When they attempt to kill him, Arul guns down Chitti and starts eliminating all the gang members, including Guru. Soon, Arul finds Karthik, but within moments, Karthik dies. Jothi is now aware of the death of Chitti and his entire crew and uses his influence to the cops to bring Arul into his custody.\nThe police force and Jothi's men join hands and hunt for Arul. Arul, all alone on this mission, still continues his own plan to expose Jothi and gets himself captured on purpose. Now that he has nothing to lose, he plans to play a final game of chance to meet Jothi face to face, earn his trust, and join as henchman again. Arul is the only survivor of the shootout at Chitti's place, and so only his account to Jothi will earn his trust.\nArul is brought to Jothi and is also able to cleverly convince him, but only up to an extent. He tells Jothi that his former partner-turned-archenemy Rane is responsible for the drug theft and shootout at Chitti's place. Jothi had been thinking Rane was dead, but Rane is actually alive and is plotting his vengeance. Jothi is still skeptical, so Arul is given 2 days to prove that Rane is alive and has done all these things. Arul succeeds by getting help from a prostitute whom he helped earlier.\nArul places all the stolen drugs at Rane's house and leads Jothi's men there, and they find the lost drugs. Jothi asks his men to kill Rane and his gang. Shiva cleverly does certain manipulations, kills Rane and his men, and places his own guns in Rane's hands. This leads Jothi and his men to believe that Rane's gun and the one used in the shootout at Chitti's place are the same. The gun is also sent for ballistic testing to check on Arul's story, and they all believe Arul's story is true.\nJothi asks Arul to join his gang and meet him at a secluded place. When Arul waits for the opportunity to gun down Jothi, he gets beaten up by his men. It is then revealed that his neighbor Usha, who was in love with Arul, had been secretly recording videos of him for her to admire, but her phone falls into the hands of Jothi's men. They find whom Arul has been meeting and dealing with so far and come to know he is also an undercover cop. As a result, Bharathi and Benjamin are assassinated by Jothi's men.\nJothi and his men beat Arul savagely, keep him bound in a harbor, and ask him the whereabouts of Sharma's remaining 900 kg of heroin. Arul whispers the location, and as Jothi comes closer to hear him, Arul spits blood onto his eyes. When all of Jothi's men are distracted, Arul escapes from his captors and kills them, leaving Jothi alone, and arrests him. Since nobody alive has seen Jothi in person, his arrest is unavoidable, and no political influence will work out. Arul rejects Usha's proposal and asks her to focus on her life. He then moves on to his next mission and kills Sharma and seizes the remaining 900 kg of heroin.", "tmdb_id": 264041}, "41439106": {"title": "Medulla Oblongata (film)", "plot": "Chandru is all set to marry his lover Nidhi Patel.

The Mega Shark begins its reign of terror by flipping the tugboat to the air until it crashes and decapitates the Sphinx hundreds of miles away in Giza. Following the incident, several countries around the world place their ports on lockdown and impose a ban on fishing, adversely affecting the world's economy as the megalodon terrorizes the seas. Meanwhile, rumors surface of the United Nations' proposal to develop a weapon to combat the shark.\nAt Pearl Harbor, Jack Turner and Rosie Gray are assigned to pilot the Mecha Shark, a new prototype submarine that resembles the megalodon. Jack, however, is skeptical about the untested prototype, as it is not equipped with their special A.I. named \"Nero\". Later, aboard the USS Charles Davis, Admiral Engleberg is warned by Dr. Emma McNeil that the megalodon's aggression attributes to its search for a mate. After the USS Virginia confirms the presence of the megalodon within the South China Sea, the Charles Davis and the Mecha Shark head to rendezvous with the Virginia. Rosie takes the Mecha Shark and hits the mega shark with a tracking projectile. The Virginia fires a torpedo that hits the shark. Rosie launches a torpedo toward the megalodon, but she inadvertently sinks the Virginia before the mega shark damages the prototype. Following the failed operation, Jack installs Nero into the Mecha Shark's computer. Meanwhile, the megalodon strikes the AR Event Horizon oil platform off the coast of Australia, triggering a devastating oil spill.\nRosie takes the Mecha Shark back underwater as she and Nero duke it out with the megalodon, but they discover a damaged oil pipeline in the area. Jack and Adm. Engleberg engage in a heated argument over the decision to either seal the pipeline or continue the pursuit on the mega shark. Rosie uses the Mecha Shark to seal the leak by crushing the damaged pipe before continuing her objective. The megalodon launches itself into the air to sink a commercial airliner, but the Mecha Shark rushes in to tackle it mid-air back into the ocean. In the ensuing battle, the tracking projectile falls off the megalodon's body. Rosie fires a torpedo toward the mega shark, but it uses its tail fin to swat it toward the Charles Davis' fleet, sinking one of the ships. The Mecha Shark follows the megalodon into a trench; Rosie fires another torpedo that causes a landslide that sends the submarine offline and knocks Rosie unconscious. A few minutes later, Nero's system reboots and notifies Jack that the Mecha Shark is wedged between several rocks, but it manages to blast its way out of the debris. The megalodon attacks the USS James Stewart aircraft carrier, which is field-testing her high-frequency emitters. Jack and Adm. Engleberg tell the James Stewart crew to turn off her emitters; the attack is briefly halted, but the megalodon jumps to intercept a fighter plane and crushes the carrier in the process.\nAfter the Mecha Shark returns to the Charles Davis, Jack and Adm. Engleberg argue over putting an unconscious Rosie back in the field when Nero suggests it can control the submarine by itself. Mecha Shark returns to sea, but it is critically damaged by the megalodon. After Rosie awakens, she is summoned to Emma's research facility in Auckland, New Zealand, where Emma reveals that the megalodon is headed toward Sydney, a spawning ground of its species millions of years earlier. Sydney is promptly evacuated while Nero goes back online, yet Jack cannot pinpoint the glitch that caused its defeat. As predicted, the megalodon arrives in Sydney's shores; the Mecha Shark with Nero in control is once again deployed to engage it in battle. Nero once again malfunctions; this time, the Mecha Shark enters Drone Mode, a fail-safe system programmed to complete its task without the safety protocols. The megalodon tackles Mecha Shark and hurls it toward the Sydney Opera House. Jack rushes to Sydney and reunites with Rosie, but Mecha Shark goes back online and determines all humans in sight as hostile after soldiers point their guns at it. As the Mecha Shark goes into amphibious mode and terrorizes the streets, Emma calls Rosie and suggests to lure it back into the ocean and convince the megalodon to destroy it. Rosie rushes in to board the Mecha Shark to trigger the pulse generator. Meanwhile, the megalodon sinks the Charles Davis, killing Adm. Engleberg and everyone aboard. The Mecha Shark is blasted back into the water by a squadron of fighter planes. Jack boards a second shark submarine to board the Mecha Shark and get Nero back online. Jack and Rosie leave the Mecha Shark before the megalodon bites the left side of the submarine, triggering a dislodged torpedo which destroys both combatants in the explosion.

The villa is decorated with paintings of two boys playing string game and there is also a locked room A Mu claimed belonging to A Ming. Supernatural occurrences begin to haunt the couple, including a red doll that stalks Xiaomei, a music tape that plays a string game song, and most importantly, a ghostly woman with long hair and white dress. The doll is disposed of by A Mu at Xiaomei's request, while the paintings always resurface back whenever Xiaomei tries to remove it. A Mu also sees a woman in black robe who seems to watch him while going to work every day.\nOne day, the two visit the orphanage that A Mu grew up in to become fundraisers. Xiaomei learns about a loner orphan in A Mu's generation named Xiaoshan who died when he was 10 years old. After a series of boxes containing increasingly threatening messages are left at his doorstep, A Mu installs security cameras around the house. That night, Xiaomei watches the footage to find a cloaked figure leaving the house. She decides to break into A Ming's room, finding more paintings of the boys and the disposed red doll. Spooked by the woman, Xiaomei runs away, pulling some of the woman's hair in the process, and falls off the stairs, causing her baby's miscarriage.\nArriving back at home from the hospital, Xiaomei forces A Mu to reveal the truth about Qingqing, his fellow orphan and childhood friend together with A Ming. A Mu and Qingqing maintain their relationship well to adulthood, but Qingqing apparently left him for a rich man when he struggled on money. She was subsequently killed by A Ming, who justified his actions due to her unfaithfulness. A Ming buried her body and showed it to A Mu the previous night, despite Xiaomei's claims about the hair. Another box is soon delivered to the couple, warning about not combing the hair during midnight, a trait of Qingqing. Xiaomei does just that and summons the woman in white, who tells her that A Ming does not exist.\nFrom A Mu's orphanage, Xiaomei learns that \"A Ming\" is a nickname given to Xiaoshan, the son of two imprisoned thieves whose only friend in the orphanage was A Mu. One day, the two escaped from a locked room they were imprisoned in for robbery but slipped through the roofs. The dean chose to save A Mu over A Ming, as A Mu is her grandson born out of wedlock. She promptly gave offerings for A Ming, but suffered a heart attack and died with her face burnt. Xiaomei is visited by the woman in white, revealed to be Qingqing's younger half-sister, Yu Xiaohan. Xiaohan apologizes for the miscarriage and states that she wants Mu Kainan, A Mu's real name, to confess in his murder of Qingqing, the latter having supported Xiaohan's leukemia treatment and being the only family who supported her. She does this by haunting him, as \"people would tell the truth if they are scared\". A Mu arrives, exhibiting his dissociative identity disorder by constantly switching between his A Mu and A Ming's persona. In his A Ming's persona, he knocks out Xiaomei and bounds her, confirming his deeds including the murder of his grandmother. However, he is unable to kill her due to A Mu's memories of their relationship resurfacing. A Mu decides to commit suicide to prevent himself from harming Xiaomei even further.\nXiaomei visits Xiaohan at the hospital to inform her that A Mu left some money for her and Qingqing so she could pay her bills, wishing her recovery and saying that she is not alone anymore.

Morales makes a large down payment with the understanding that he will close in 30 days or lose his money.\nAfter moving into a new home, Morales chases an intruder, then finds a dropped gun.

During the fight, a prism from the idol of the goddess explodes. The brothers are frightened and immediately stop the fight. After conducting certain rituals, they find that the goddess is angry because of the bloodshed that happened, and it is decided that the treasure will be locked for 41 years.\nIn the present, Bhai Ji is a con artist, who disguises himself as John Cliff and successfully loots \u20b9100 crore (US$13 million) from a wedding along with his assistants Abbas and Priya. At that time, his acquaintance Javed introduces him to Nikhil Adharva \"Nikki\", who tells Bhai Ji about the royal treasure and the story behind it. He shows the list of royal family members, who are inheriting the treasure. They are Ravindra Varma's sons Vasudeva Varma and Sri Krishna Varma and Mahendra Varma's sons Shekhara Varma, who is the royal head and Rajashekhara Varma. Nikki tells that Rajashekhara Varma has moved to the court, stating that the treasure should be given back to the government and used for helping the public rather than dividing among themselves. The case is pending in the court, and this will be the right chance to steal the treasure. Bhai Ji demands \u20b9500 crore (US$63 million) for doing the job and an advance of \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) before doing it.\nMeanwhile, the family arranges security arrangements as they fear a heist, and the police department sends DYSP Sajan to guard the family and treasure. They appoint a private consultant named Sivaram from Jaipur to assess the value of the treasure, but before he reaches there, Bhai Ji kidnaps him and takes him to his place. Rajashekara Varma takes Bhai Ji to the royal palace, where he meets the other family members. Later, the cellar is opened, and Bhai Ji begins assessing the value of the treasure. He realizes that this is the riskiest mission he has ever attempted. Meanwhile, Rajashekhara Varma is attacked by some goons, and before they could kill him, Bhai Ji arrives, and defeats the goons. Rajashekhara Varma thanks Bhai Ji for saving his life, but Sajan and Saraswathy, who is Rajashekhara Varma's daughter, have suspicions. Nikki and Javed arrive along with the real Sivaram and meet Bhai Ji, who gives the video clippings of the treasures and tells Nikki to make a replica of it. Nikki agrees and leaves. \nMeanwhile, Rajashekar has become friends with Bhai Ji and tells him about Sarawathy and shows him the school run by her, which is still under construction. Bhai Ji and his assistants decided to find out a way to steal the treasure from the cellar. He guesses that there should be a secret path behind the cellar that would lead to another exit after studying the architecture of several other palaces. In the night, the three of them leave to search for the door. Bhai Ji enters the cellar and, using a metal detector, finds the passage and the exit point. Before leaving out of the cellar, he talks to the idol and tells that there is a secret between them, which is also known to someone else. Sajan accidentally tells the other family members regarding Saraswathy's past, which only he and Rajashekara Varma knew. Saraswathy was assaulted by unknown people when she was only 12 years old, and Rajashekhara Varma had adopted her after that incident. \nInitially, he had instructed Sajan to try to find the culprits, but later on, seeing that it would be futile, he asked Sajan, who was the CI at that point in time, to close the case. Upon the knowledge of Saraswathy's past, Rajashekhara Varma's daughters and their husbands threaten him to withdraw the case that he had filed with the court, or else they would file another case to re-investigate the issue. An infuriated Rajashekhara Varma starts to hit Sajan, and Bhai Ji intervenes. Rajashekhara Varma narrates the incident to Bhai Ji. 15 years back, Sajan was chasing a thief, who had robbed a bank, and on the way, he encountered an unconscious Saraswathy, and takes her to the hospital, where he informs Rajashekhara Varma, who was the local MLA. Though they tried to find the culprits, they didn't succeed. Rajashekhara Varma tells Sajan not to charge any case as it would affect Saraswathy's  future, and Rajashekhara Varma adopts her. \nSajan also tells Bhai Ji that though he had a suspicion on him, he is now convinced that Bhai Ji is innocent and that he has found out the people, who were behind the attack on Rajashekhara Varma and that he was planning to meet them at night when a party will be conducted at the palace. Bhai Ji tells that it is dangerous for Sajan to go alone and he would accompany him, but Sajan refuses Bhai Ji's help. Saraswathy arrives at the palace, along with Rajashekhara Varma and tells the family members that they can do whatever they want, but her father wouldn't withdraw the case. Shekara Varma comes in defence of Saraswathy and promises her that no one will harm her. Bhai Ji is disturbed, and when asked by Abbas and Priya, he tells them that he was the thief that Sajan was chasing, and on the way, he saw three people chasing Saraswathy. He extended his hand to help her while he was driving, but she missed it. Bhai Ji became confused about whether to stop and save the girl or run away as the cops were right behind him. \nHe decided to move away from there to avoid getting caught. He tells them that from that day, the incident used to haunt him and he was shocked to see the girl again. That night after the party, Nikki and the gang arrive with the duplicate treasure, and they begin the heist. Bhai Ji enters the cellar through the secret tunnel, and Nikki places a GPS inside the boxes to make sure that Bhai Ji doesn't cheat them. After taking the treasure out, Nikki informs Bhai Ji that the final transaction will be in Jaipur, and Abbas can come with them so that Bhai Ji can trust them. The next day Bhai Ji submits his evaluation report, and before he leaves, the cops arrive there and informs them that Sajan has been murdered and arrest Rajashekhara Varma as he is the main suspect. Bhai Ji leaves for Jaipur. Javed and Nikki tell him that they are not going to pay him anything and he should return the \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) if he wants Abbas back. \nBhai Ji tells them that a few more people have to arrive and tells them that he has brought the third party (unknown entity) that teamed up with Nikki and hired him for the heist. The unknown entity happens to be Shekhara Varma and his son Sudhakara Varma, who was captured by Bhai Ji's henchman Bittoo when they arrived to Jaipur for the final transaction. Bhai Ji tells Shekhara Varma that he knows him well about him and he is not a simple person like others, but a wicked person. He tells him that it was the goddess which told him the truth. When Bhai Ji was searching for the door to a secret tunnel inside the cellar, he finds an old bullet stuck on the walls, and he realized how the prism broke. During the fight, when Vasudeva Varma was going to strike Shekara Varma with a sword, he secretly had a gun with which he shot at the prism.\nMahendra Varma learnt about his son's evil intentions and lied to others about the goddess's wrath and locked the cellar as a punishment for Shekhara Varma. Though he was happy with getting one-fourth of the treasure, he was upset when his brother Rajashekhara Varma filed a case, and this prompted him to join with Nikki and plan a heist. Even he was the one who planned to kill Rajashekhara Varma so that if he dies, Vasudeva Varma and Sri Krishna Varma would become the suspects, and they will begin to distrust each other while Shekhara Varma can move forward with the case and extend the time for a heist. Bhai Ji knows that Sudhakara Varma was the one who killed Sajan, and Abbas had secretly shot the murder in his phone upon Bhai Ji's instructions, and the visuals have been sent to the cops. A fight ensues, and after some time, Abbas has Nikki at gunpoint after Bhai Ji defeats him. \nJaved begs for mercy, and Bhai Ji tells him to take the van having the treasure to a place along with Sudhakara Varma and Sivaram. After they leave, he tells Nikki and Shekhara Varma that Abbas had planted a bomb in the van and presses the button triggering a blast which kills the three of them, and kills Nikki. Bhai Ji leaves a gun back, telling Shekara Varma that it was destiny that brought him there for the job and he had never stolen the treasure. Instead, he exchanged the treasure between the boxes along with the boxes and that he got \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) for doing nothing. He also leaves telling that Shekhara Varma can choose his punishment. Shekara Varma commits suicide. Two years later, Saraswathy's school has been completed, and Bhai Ji visits Saraswathy and Rajashekhara Varma, who thank him for all the help he did, like funding for the school, helping Rajashekhara Varma to win the case and also saving him from the Sajan's murder case. Bhai Ji confesses to Sarawathy that he was the man who had offered his hand to save her, but couldn't do it, and he tells them that this is his only confession.

Despite Dino's objections, Tobey takes the Mustang to a local race track and successfully drives it at 234 mph, convincing Ingram to purchase it for $2.7 million.\nEnraged by Tobey's disobedience to his objections, Dino challenges Tobey and his friend Pete to a race after Pete flatly tells Dino that everyone knows Tobey is a better driver than him. Dino offers to relinquish his entire share of the Mustang sale if Tobey wins, otherwise Tobey will have to forfeit his share. He challenges them to race with his uncle's three Koenigsegg Agera R cars illegally imported from Europe. On the home stretch, realizing he is about to lose the race, Dino intentionally bumps into Pete's car, sending it down a ravine and killing Pete as it bursts into flames. Dino disappears from the scene, while Tobey is arrested by the police and sentenced to two years in prison for involuntary manslaughter, unable to prove Dino was there.\nUpon his release on parole, Tobey sets out to avenge Pete's death. He borrows Ingram's Mustang to enter the De Leon, a winner-takes-all exotic car race organized by the mysterious Monarch, but as a condition, Ingram requires Julia to accompany Tobey while Tobey is driving the Mustang. The pair have 45 hours to reach San Francisco before the race starts. In Detroit, they cause an interstate chase with the Michigan State Police and upload the footage. Dino offers his rare Lamborghini Sesto Elemento to anyone who can stop Tobey entering the race, causing a group of truckers to go after the Mustang as well. Julia retaliates by convincing Monarch of Tobey's innocence, securing his invitation to the De Leon.\nIn Utah, Tobey and Julia are ambushed by truckers, forcing them off the road. Benny, a member of Tobey's crew, appears in a military helicopter stolen from the National Guard, and carries the Mustang mid-air to Tobey's crew at the Bonneville Salt Flats, getting himself arrested in the process. Tobey and Julia reach San Francisco's Mark Hopkins Hotel in time to register for the race, but on Nob Hill, a tow truck smashes into the Mustang, wrecking it and injuring Julia. Desperate to get another car for the race, Tobey meets Dino's fianc\u00e9e Anita, his ex-girlfriend and Pete's sister. Having discovered Dino's involvement in Pete's death, Anita gives Tobey the location of Dino's hidden Koenigsegg, which Tobey and crew member Joe extract. Tobey meets Julia at a San Francisco hospital, confessing his feelings for her with a kiss and letting her know that he has a \"fast\" car, and that this is for Pete.\nThe next morning, Tobey surprises Dino by not only showing up in the red Koenigsegg he drove when Pete was killed, but also giving him Anita's engagement ring, informing Dino that she is through with him. Besides the Koenigsegg and Dino's Lamborghini, the other participating cars and drivers include:\n\nTexas Mike in the McLaren P1\nJohnny V in the GTA Spano\nThe Gooch in the Saleen S7 Twin Turbo\nEnglish Paul in the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super SportIn the ensuing race along the Pacific Coast Highway, the racers and pursuing California Highway Patrol officers crash one-by-one, leaving Tobey and Dino racing side-by-side. Dino attempts to ram Tobey the same way he killed Pete, but Tobey dodges, causing Dino to crash and flip over. Tobey pulls Dino from the wreckage before reaching the finish line, but not without punching Dino to avenge Pete; both are subsequently apprehended by the police, with Dino eventually convicted of the murder of Pete.\n178 days later, Tobey is released, and Julia meets him at the prison gates in a 2015 Ford Mustang.

Delta Psi Beta, a fraternity known for outrageous parties, moves in next door. The fraternity's leaders, Teddy Sanders and Pete Regazolli, aspire to join Delta Psi's Hall of Fame by throwing a massive end-of-the-year party.\nThe Radners ask Teddy to keep the noise down, and to earn their favor, he invites them to join the party. Kelly meets Teddy's girlfriend Brooke Shy, and Teddy shows Mac his bedroom, which includes a stash of fireworks and a breaker box that controls the house\u2019s power. Teddy agrees to manage the noise, but has Mac and Kelly promise to always call him instead of the police. The following night, when the party next door keeps Stella awake, Mac is unable to reach Teddy. Kelly convinces Mac to call the police anonymously, but Officer Watkins identifies them to Teddy. Betrayed, Teddy leads Delta Psi in hazing Mac and Kelly, resulting in Stella nearly eating an unused condom after the fraternity dumps their garbage on the Radners\u2019 lawn. Mac and Kelly go to the college dean Carol Gladstone, but the school has a \u201cthree strikes\u201d policy before it will intervene; Delta Psi's first strike was burning down their old house.\nFailing to force the fraternity to move by damaging their house, Kelly manipulates Pete and Brooke into having sex, and Mac leads Teddy to catch them in the act. Teddy and Pete fight, and a barbecue grill injures a passing professor. This gives Delta Psi their second strike and places them on probation, effectively ending their party plans.

But just when Nicholas believes he has got everything under control, Isabelle appears, the daughter of his parents' friends, Mr and Mrs Bernique. He does not understand why she cares so much about him until he becomes suspicious that his parents are trying to set her up as his wife-to-be.\nNicholas consults his friends about the looming threat to his \"true love\", marrying Marie-Edwige. His friends offer advice and plot to separate Isabelle and Nicholas. They tell him that he must tarnish his family's reputation in front of Isabelle's parents, which happens by circumstance (Granny wanting to go to the casino). Meanwhile, Nicholas' dad is having nightmares of his boss, Mr. Moucheboume, and colleagues laughing at a postcard he sent. He later writes and puts in a mailbox a letter of resignation. However, he later gets a call from Moucheboume, who has big plans for him. This changes Nicolas' dad's mind, and after failing to retrieve the letter from the mailbox, he sets it all on fire.\nNicholas and his friends even contemplate putting vipers on their beds to drive them out of there. After a close encounter with the viper, they connect the water supply and sewage line in the shower so the shower will have sewage coming out of it. Isabelle walks in on Nicholas guarding her door as the boys do the job. He gets frightened and bolts, then Isabelle walks up to him in an enclosed space and gives him Marie-Edwige's bracelet (which Nicholas lost a few days ago). The two then start chatting and get to know each other well. His interest for Isabelle grows. When the boys find out, they are unhappy and disappointed, until Isabelle shows what she can do and becomes their friend. Later, Mrs Bernique's shower incident forces them to almost leave. The boys then sabotage their car to extend their stay.\nOne day on the beach, Massimo Massini, a very loud and obnoxious movie producer from Italy, is filming a movie on the beach, angering the vacationers. In a fit of anger, Nicholas' mother marches up to Massini and yells at him in public to stop being so inconsiderate to everyone else; this act is well-received by the other vacationers. To apologize, Massini sends his assistant to invite Nicolas's parents to a party he is throwing at a club. There, Nicholas' mother dances with Massini and Nicholas' dad is kicked out of the club by security.\nIsabelle takes her dad's chequebook from the coat, which forces them to stay even longer. Her father thinks it is Nicholas' dad who stole it (due to Nick's aforementioned lie about the family), though he later finds out this is not the case after patting down his pockets in an awkward manner. Nicholas' mother walks down the beach to have become a sort of local celebrity; she is interviewed and Nicholas' dad is pushed away. Nicholas and Isabelle decide to run away to an old fortress, as the former writes a letter explaining this to Marie-Edwige. At night, there is a masked party, which Nicholas and Isabelle use as a distraction to get to the fortress, which is filled with explosives that they shift aside.\nBack at the party, Nicholas' dad finds a letter that his son wrote to him about running away, and Mr Bernique finds a similar one from Isabelle. C\u00f4me unintentionally gives away the location of the two, and a search party is sent out to the fortress. Massini takes Nicholas' mother to his car, while Nicholas' dad misses the search party leaving and goes by bike. Then when it crashes, he finds a tractor, with which he crushes Massini's parked car until it gets stuck.\nNicholas and Isabelle decide to go back to the hotel. As they leave, a shelf holding an explosive collapses, triggering an explosion that demolishes the entire fortress. In the forest, a hunter spots Massini in a gorilla suit, mistaking him for a Bigfoot-like creature, and shoots at him, to no avail. The search party finds where the original fortress was, albeit with nothing left. They head back to the hotel to find Nicholas and Isabelle asleep in front of a TV.\nThe next day, three days before summer vacation ends, everyone leaves the hotel, and Nicholas promises Isabelle he will write to her every day.

He and the other exhibits are hosting an event to help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. As Larry makes sure everything is ready, the other exhibits inform him that the museum commissioned a new Neanderthal model resembling Larry. The new Neanderthal calls himself Laaa and considers Larry his father. Later, Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet has a mysterious corrosion. As the corrosion spreads, the exhibits act abnormally and cause massive chaos at the planetarium. After calming the situation, Larry, frustrated, returns home to find his teenage son Nick throwing a party.\nTo discover what is happening to the tablet, Larry reunites with now-retired Cecil, a member of the expedition who discovered the tomb. Cecil remembers \"the end will come\" prophecy and realizes it refers to the tablet's magic ending and the exhibits becoming lifeless. Cecil says Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power, but that they are in the British Museum. Larry convinces museum curator Dr. McPhee, who was fired due to the planetarium incident, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, although McPhee believes the magic is just clever special effects. Larry and Nick travel the U.K. and go to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. Larry discovers that some of the American exhibits have stowed away with Ahkmenrah: Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, miniatures Jedediah and Octavius, Dexter the capuchin monkey, and Laaa. As Larry and the others search the museum, the tablet brings the British exhibits to life.\nThe group is joined by a wax figure of Sir Lancelot, who helps fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Triceratops skeleton and a Xiangliu statue. The tablet's corrosion worsens, and the American exhibits begin experiencing side-effects such as stiffening limbs and memory reversion. The group finds Ahkmenrah's parents. They learn the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot steals the tablet, mistaking it for the Holy Grail, and prepares to leave for Camelot. Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room, but Attila helps them escape. Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly; they become attracted to each other.\nLancelot crashes the musical Camelot starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve and is stunned to realize that unlike the other exhibits, Lancelot and Camelot are not real. Larry and the others chase Lancelot to the theatre's roof, where the corrosion almost consumes the entire tablet, turning the exhibits back into their lifeless forms. The group tells Lancelot that although Camelot never existed, he can have a life. Lancelot gives the tablet back, allowing Larry to straighten the pieces as the moonlight restores the tablet's power and the exhibits. As the American exhibits prepare to return home, they decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet should stay at the London Museum with his parents, even though this means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Larry is upset, but they all inform him that they are at peace with their unanimous decision. Ahkmenrah thanks Larry for reuniting him with his family, and the exhibits go home.

He explains that she was unwilling to allow him, an equal contributor to their household expenses, to have the house to himself for the purpose of entertaining an old military buddy. He goes on to explain that he feels no guilt for the crime but does regret the amount of blood. Peter appears to be a type of vlogger, as he admonishes himself that he can not upload this video and shuts the camera off.\nThe next day, Peter sits at the kitchen table singing happily and enjoying a bowl of what appears to be Froot Loops. And as he heads off to work, he seems to forget for a moment that the previous night he murdered his mother, because he calls to her closed bedroom door to let her know he's leaving. His face registers the new reality.\nPeter returns from work venting about his day, but reassures himself that no one will ruin his good mood because he is about to prepare a great meal because he deserves it. For the second time in the film, the viewing audience notice that Peter sings songs to himself that are more suited to the 1960s or '70s and are no longer current hits. And later his wardrobe will validate that he is stuck in another time period. Peter sits down to enjoy his meal but appears to be lonely as he sits at the dinner table. The next scene is Peter sitting in front of the television, attempting to watch something but realizing he needs his glasses. As he checks his pockets and the cushions on the couch, his facial expression lets us know he remembers where they are and that he dreads going to retrieve them. He quickly goes into his mother's room and comes out with glasses covered in his mother's blood.\nThe next scene introduces us to Edward. Peter practices calling Edward several times, inviting him over for the dinner he was asking his mother to allow him, which led to her murder. After getting the courage to dial the number, he reaches Edward's wife, Gloria. He makes small talk asking about the children and then asks to speak with Edward. After being told he was unavailable, he leaves a message and begins recording for his online audience, letting them know he has no expectation that she will give Edward the message. He decides that Edward will come to dinner on Friday, even though they have not spoken. He even begins contemplating a menu.\nThe next day, the doorbell wakes Peter and a package is left at the door. It is a makeup mirror his mother obviously ordered before she died. The mirror seems to represent her throughout the remainder of the movie. It resides on the kitchen table where his mother may have sat during their morning meals; he speaks to it often as if it were she. He receives a call from his sister, Vickie, and thus begin conversations with the outside world where he lies and deceives others about the whereabouts of his mother. He tells Vickie that their mother is out and complains about the purchase of the mirror.\nPeter, drinking and smoking, relishing in the good fortune of having the house to himself for the very first time, begins a barrage of phone calls to Edward's answering machine. He shares how much he misses him and goes from pleading for a return call to cursing Gloria for standing in the way of his friendship with Edward.\nThe next morning, the scent of rotting flesh coming from underneath his mother's door begins to become unbearable and Peter stuffs a towel in the crack. He goes off to work and returns with an iPhone and a bluetooth headset. That evening, he retrieves the mail and notices a letter to his mother. After preparing a cup of tea and telling the mirror/mother to hold on, he opens the letter and reads it. It's from an old friend, Charlene Carruthers, from Mobile, AL telling Lillian, his mother, about the goings on in Mobile and expresses concerns she and her husband have about the last letter from Lillian. They pray Peter will meet a Christian woman to marry, and that Lillian should not love Peter more than God and thus allow him to do anything against God's will. The letter is so upsetting to Peter that he types a response from his mother to Charlene. The letter states what a good son he is, that he takes excellent care of her and that he had his friend Edward over for a wonderful dinner for the three of them.\nPeter decides to use his new iPhone to make another attempt to reach Edward and is finally successful. His joy is palpable when he turns his face to the wall and tells Edward how badly he's missed him. He explains that he's called for days and that Gloria has been preventing his calls from being received. He shares the news that his mother has \"moved away\" and that he wants him to come to dinner to celebrate. Miraculously, Edward is available the very day he told his online viewers, Friday.\nNow Peter has to prepare the house for his dinner guest and, first things first, mother must be removed from the house. He wraps her in his grandmother's quilt, caresses her hand for the last time, and drags her from the room. As he leaves, we see a lock on the door as if Lillian had been afraid of Peter and locked her door to keep him out. He puts her in the trunk of the car, along with a shovel, and drives away, presumably to bury her. The next day he calls Vickie on his new phone and, after explaining to her that their mother knows about the phone and that they are not paupers who cannot afford it, he shares the good news that he and mother are redecorating the house. We learn that their father left them 30 years ago and that Peter is not concerned about the costs of the work, as it will just be billed to his MasterCard. Peter vents to mother via the mirror about his frustration with all the work he will have to do on the house and that this could have been done 10 years ago with the money from the settlement. A call from Mrs. Carruthers from Mobile interrupts his lunch; again he lies about his mother's whereabouts.\nPeter tells his online viewers about his exciting dinner plans, possible menu items, and thanks them for their comments. Then he introduces them in a later video to the tropical fish he bought for Edward to make his home a sanctuary for him. Adam and Eve are the fishes' names; Adam the fish has just left his wife. Peter goes through the house the next day looking for the espresso machine. He explains to his viewers that he and Edward love an after dinner espresso and explodes over his mother having hidden it from him out of spite. He unsuccessfully tries to purchase a new one over the phone, but he has charged his MasterCard to the limit and cannot get approved for an increase. He finally locates the machine in the attic.\nSitting outside on the patio, Peter finally shares with his viewers the story of meeting Edward. We find out that he was in the military with Edward. He explains that the military was too difficult for him, which seems to mean he was discharged. That, coupled with the murder and his medications, implies mental health issues that may have contributed to his leaving the military. Peter alludes to a misunderstanding he and Edward had that they need to resolve.\nThe next day, Peter is painting the dining room and explaining to Vickie why their mother does not want to talk to her anymore. He attempts to convince her to send him money for an airline ticket so they can send their mother to Mobile to visit Mrs. Carruthers. Later that day, Mrs Beasley from church calls to check on Lillian because she missed bridge at church. Peter explains she has been ill and rushes off the phone when the eggs he's cooking begin burning on the stove. Peter ends his night with prayer.\nThe next day, the BIG DAY, we see Peter with a new look. His hair is texturized, similar to styles in the 1960s and '70s, reinforcing that he is out of date with his look. He begins singing around the house as he cooks, cleans, and works out. He has another discussion with Vickie reaffirming that their mother wants nothing to do with her. He makes some final touches around the house and then begins getting ready. We see from his wardrobe that he hasn't been shopping in decades; he finally decides on what looks like a suit he wore to prom. He walks down the hall looking cleanly dressed and quite dapper in a burgundy suit with white shirt and matching tie. He waits for his guest.\nAfter waiting 45 minutes and updating his online viewers that he may have given Edward the wrong directions, he calls Edward to check on him. Gloria answers the phone, so he pretends to be a Mr. Jones calling for business reasons. When she refuses to allow him to speak with Edward, he begins to unravel, threatening her that he will not allow her to ruin what he has sacrificed so much for.

His day is filled with multiple calls from Mrs. Carruthers, Mrs. Beasley, and Pastor Barrons asking about Lillian's whereabouts. He provides each with a different story or lie, reassuring them that she is fine and visiting friends in Mobile AL. He later calls Gloria to apologize for his erratic behavior and violent threats the night before and announces he will be moving. He gets a suitcase and begins packing for a trip.

Greatly disappointed, Peter retrieves his packed suitcase from the trunk of his car and puts his clothes and toiletries away then cleans up the mess from his tantrum the night before. He sits to type a letter of apology and suicide to Edward. Peter retrieves a shoe box filled with letters written to Edward by Peter, returned unopened. He gets all the medications from the bathroom and swallows them, then goes out to the car, where he has taped a hose to the tailpipe, and waits for the car to fill with fumes. Unable to keep the pills down, he throws up, then turns the engine off.\nThe next morning, Robert Beasley from church comes by the house, or does he? Peter looks out the peephole of the door, but there's no one there. There appears to be the shadow of a shoulder and it looks as if someone tries to break into the back door of the house but when Peter looks out the window to the front of the house there is still no one there and no vehicle in the driveway. Leaving the viewer to question if there was anyone at the door at all. Peter then sits at the table to eat his breakfast, but after seeing himself in the mirror, the mirror that also appears to be Lillian, he closes it and returns it to her bedroom. He returns to his viewers, now bald, and tells them about his brother Bobby's death. The camera pans to a memorial plaque dating Bobby's life from '62 to '81. Since Peter was only 6 in '81 it dawns on the viewer that the clothes Peter wears throughout the film must be those of his brother Bobby. He's been wearing Bobby's clothes throughout the film. Peter met Edward 18 years ago and knew that he and his mother would be great friends; now he reconciles himself to the fact that he has lost them both.\nPeter receives one last call from Vickie where he seems to confess that their mother is dead. He tells Vickie that their mother loved her and gives her permission to contact the police now. He dresses, then gets a shotgun from the cabinet outside. He makes his final recording to his viewers and announces that the police are inside the house and coming down the hall. He thanks his viewers for their comments and offers words of wisdom and advice to hug your children. He seems to resign himself to being killed by the police for appearing to be armed and dangerous, despite the gun's being unloaded. Then quotes a verse from Revelations: \"He who testifies to the things says yes I am coming soon.

He witnesses a flower grow instantly from the ground and dreams of a great flood, so he takes his family to consult his grandfather, Methuselah. On the way, they come across a group of recently killed people and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. She is treated for an abdominal wound, but Naameh determines she will be unable to bear children. The group is chased by the murderers and escapes into the land of the Watchers, fallen angels that were left stranded on Earth as stone creatures after they descended from Heaven to help Adam and Eve when the pair was banished from the Garden of Eden.\nMethuselah helps Noah understand his visions and gives him a seed from Eden, which he plants nearby. The Watchers arrive the next morning, and, while they debate whether to help Noah build his ark, water spouts from where Noah planted the seed and a mature forest pops up around them. The Watchers are convinced Noah is serving the Creator.\nYears later, Tubal-cain notices a huge flock of birds flying to the almost-completed ark and leads his followers to confront Noah, who defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. When the Watchers form a defensive circle, Tubal-cain retreats and begins to build weapons to take the ark. More species of animals come to the ark and are sedated with incense.\nWith Ila in love with Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth, but, after witnessing the settlers' cruel and shameless behavior, he abandons his effort, as he now believes the Creator does not want humans to be part of the world once he and his family get the animals reestablished after the flood. Devastated by the idea of being alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider and, when he will not, goes to Methuselah for help. The old man cures Ila's infertility, while Ham befriends a refugee named Na'el.\nWhen the rain begins, Tubal-cain incites his followers to storm the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest, but leaves Na'el, who is stuck in a foothold trap, to be trampled to death. His family enters the ark, except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers hold off Tubal-cain's army, sacrificing themselves and ascending back to heaven. Tubal-cain slips onto the ark and solicits help from Ham, playing on the boy's anger toward Noah.\nIla discovers she is pregnant and tells Noah. He pleads with God not to make him kill the child. The rains stop, indicating that God wants the child to die, so Noah tells his family that, if the baby is a girl, he will kill her to ensure the future will be uncorrupted by humans.\nNine months later, Ila goes into labor as she and Shem are about to leave the ark on a raft.

Marks sits next to Jen Summers, in business class, who has switched seats so she can sit by the window. After takeoff, Marks receives a text message on his secure phone stating that someone will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a specified bank account. Marks breaks protocol and consults the flight's other air marshal Jack Hammond, who dismisses the threat. Marks has Summers and flight attendant Nancy monitor the security cameras while texting the mysterious person to try to identify him.\nWhen Marks catches Hammond on his phone nearing the 20-minute mark, he confronts him again. This time, Hammond tries to bribe Marks, confirming his suspicions. Hammond attacks, forcing Marks to kill him exactly at the 20-minute mark. Marks finds cocaine in his briefcase and learns the perpetrator had blackmailed him and set him up for death. He alerts the TSA, but TSA Agent Marenick informs him that the bank account is registered in his name and accuses Marks of being the perpetrator. Captain David McMillan dies, apparently poisoned. First Officer Kyle Rice, the co-pilot, convinces Marks that he is innocent.\nMarks searches the resentful passengers. One of them uploads a video in which Marks accuses and manhandles schoolteacher Tom Bowen, convincing the rest of the world that Marks is the perpetrator. Kyle is instructed by the TSA to divert to Iceland. Marks persuades programmer Zack White to write a computer virus to make the hijacker's phone ring. The phone rings in passenger Charles Wheeler's suit pocket, but he denies it is his. As Marks roughly questions him, Wheeler suddenly dies, foaming at the mouth. In the first-class lavatory, Marks discovers a hole drilled into the wall that offers a clear shot to the pilot's seat, and discovers a dart in Wheeler's body. A passenger tells him Summers entered the lavatory recently. Marks accuses Summers of being the hijacker. Summers becomes upset, as she had stood by him, and convinces him of her innocence.\nTwo RAF Typhoon fighter jets meet the plane to escort it to a military base in Iceland. Summers and Marks unlock the hijacker's phone, unintentionally starting a 30-minute timer for a bomb. Through words in a television news report claiming that Marks is hijacking their flight, Marks realizes that the bomb bypassed the security checks, and finds it in Hammond's cocaine briefcase. When some passengers attack Marks, Bowen stops them, believing that the bomb is the priority. Marks convinces the others of his innocence and has them move the bomb to the rear and surround it with luggage to direct the blast outward, while everybody moves to the front of the airplane. Marks tells Kyle to follow explosive protocol and descend to 8,000 feet, from a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet and speed of 500 mph, as the current pressure differential will destroy the airplane if the bomb explodes, although the escorting jets refuse to let Kyle deviate from his course. Watching the earlier video, Marks notices Bowen planting the phone on Wheeler, implicating Bowen as the mastermind of the murders. White reveals himself as Bowen's accomplice.\nBowen reveals that his father was killed in the September 11 attacks and blames the U.S. for not improving their security enough to prevent future similar attacks. Their goal was to frame Marks as a terrorist, thus ruining the reputation of the Air Marshals Service to force the U.S. to create stronger security laws. Marks persuades White, who was in it for the money, to try to disarm the bomb. Bowen, who wishes to die on the plane in a suicide mission, double-crosses White. Kyle gets the plane down to 8,000 feet, giving Marks the opportunity to kill Bowen. White attacks Marks, still wanting to escape the aircraft, but the bomb detonates, killing him and blowing open the back of the plane.

Other friends in attendance include Mickey Marcus (Joe Mantello) and the charismatic Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch), who has recently begun dating Craig, who is young and appears to be in good health. While walking on the beach, however, Craig feels dizzy and collapses. Later, when blowing out the candles on his birthday cake, Craig begins to cough repeatedly.\nWhile traveling back to New York City, Ned reads an article in the New York Times titled \"Rare Cancer Diagnosed in 41 Homosexuals\". Back in the city, he visits the offices of Dr. Emma Brookner (Julia Roberts), a physician who has seen many patients afflicted with symptoms of rare diseases that normally would be harmless unless their immune systems had been compromised. All of these cases seem to be appearing in gay men. In the waiting room, Ned meets Sanford (Stephen Spinella), a patient whose face and hands are marked with skin lesions caused by Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare cancer. Brookner examines Ned, but finds that he does not have the symptoms of this disease. She asks Ned to help her raise awareness of this disease within the gay community.\nCraig suddenly suffers violent convulsions and is rushed to the hospital with Ned, Mickey, and Bruce where he is later pronounced dead. Brookner recognizes Bruce, noting that he is the former boyfriend of another one of her patients who recently died. Ned organizes a gathering at his home where many local gay men are invited to hear Brookner share information about the disease. Though she lacks conclusive evidence, she states her belief that the illness is sexually transmissible and that they should all avoid having sex for the time being to prevent new transmissions. Most attendees question her belief. She notes that few medical journals appear interested in publishing anything on this disease which is mostly affecting homosexual men. Ned announces that he wants to start an organization to spread information about the disease and provide services to those who have been infected.\nBrookner and Ned visit a local hospital where several of her sick patients are in critical condition with an illness that is now being referred to as gay-related immune deficiency (GRID). They stay in rooms that many hospital staff are afraid to enter for fear of contracting the disease. Ned, Bruce, Mickey, and several other friends including Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons) establish a community organization called Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC). The organization sponsors fundraisers for research on the disease now called AIDS and establishes a telephone hotline, counseling, and other services. Over Ned's objections, they elect Bruce their president. Ned arranges for his older brother, lawyer Ben Weeks (Alfred Molina), to provide free legal advice to the GMHC. The two brothers are close, but there remains an underlying tension over Ben's lack of understanding of Ned's sexuality. Ned contacts gay New York Times reporter Felix Turner (Matt Bomer), hoping that he can use his media connections to publish more stories about the unfolding health crisis. Felix laments that it is difficult getting any mainstream newspapers to report much information on AIDS. After Felix recalls that he and Ned had a sexual tryst at a gay bathhouse, the two begin a romantic relationship.\nThe disease continues to spread and claim lives. Bruce attempts to travel to Phoenix with his boyfriend Albert (Finn Wittrock), who is dying, so that Albert can see his mother one more time. The airline refuses at first to fly the plane with sick Albert on board. When they do eventually get to Phoenix, Albert dies following a period of dementia. The hospital doctors refuse to examine him and issue a death certificate, and instead throw him out with the garbage while Bruce bribes a funeral home to cremate his body without a death certificate.\nBrookner attempts to obtain grant money to continue researching AIDS, but her efforts are rejected by government officials who do not see AIDS as a priority. Ned, meanwhile, is kicked out of GMHC for his combative and aggressive tactics to promote awareness of AIDS, which is causing tension within the group.\nFelix comes down with symptoms and his body wastes away as the disease claims his life. Felix arranges for a will with the help of Ben, and leaves everything he has to Ned. The two state their love for one another at the hospital before Felix dies. A few days later, Ned visits his alma mater, Yale University, where a Gay Week is being hosted by the students.

Clay is saddened by the separation and seeks out his Great Aunt Zella, who implores him not to let her go. She tells Clay that she has never seen anyone try so hard to be good, but that life is not about failings; it is about loving those that God has brought into our lives, and that stepping back into the world, and into love, is vital, knowing that failure is a part of it.\nClay takes her advice, finds Amber and asks her to marry him.

To celebrate his arrival, Niu brings Ma to the Peony night club, owned by a major gang leader and one of the four leaders of a faction called the Axe fraternity. There, he sees rising gang boss Long Qi (Andy On), whose ruthlessness and powerful martial arts skills have put the four gang leaders of Shanghai's reigning Axe fraternity on notice and pushed their territory from four even parts of Shanghai to just only half of it under the Axe fraternity and half under his own reign. Long Qi beats the rival gang leader to death, and sends another back with a message: that the club, now named Paradise Night Club, would mark the border of his and the Axe fraternity's territory, further reducing their land holdings.\nMa Yongzhen tries to find a job at the pier. He arm-wrestles everyone and wins easily, proving his extreme strength. Finally, a local gangster comes and challenges Ma to an arm-wrestle. He says that if Ma can last one minute against him, he would hire him; Ma gives a counter-offer of three minutes, but if he lasts, the gangster must hire two of his friends as well. The gangster agrees, and Ma wins, earning three people jobs for eighty cents a day.\nBack at the village, Ma is pressured by an acquaintance to sell a package of opium, that he mistakenly brings home instead of a package of imported Japanese tea. He tells Ma that one small package of opium could sell six to seven hundred silver dollars, an enormous sum, but Ma is only interested in making honest money. Ma tells him to return the package, but he doesn't do so. That night, the gangster who hired Ma comes to the village to find the package of opium. He threatens to kill a young girl, and is about to cut her head off when Master Tie and Ma beat up the gangster and his men, keeping the village safe.\nLater on, Ma takes the opium and returns it to the gangster, while questioning if that amount of opium was worth a person's life.

As expected, Dharmanna is a good Samaritan while Suyodhana is a dangerous criminal who runs a quarry business. Similar to the tale of Mahabharata, here in this film too, Dharmanna and Suyodhana play the game of cards in which Suyodhana fails, which makes him follow the stipulation of the game - no celebration, marriage, and any good events should not be conducted for 14 years. This leaves Suyodhana swearing vengeance and exactly after 14 years, by manipulation, Suyodhana wins the game and asks Dharmanna to give his daughter's hand with his youngest son's marriage. Thus to ensure his daughter Honey's safety, Dharmanna sends her to Bangkok along with his friend and his friend's daughter. There she stays with Satya's family and starts working with her sons Vijay and Gopal in a successful boat business.\nOn a separate note, Naidu is a tourist guide in Bangkok, and his three sons Ajay, Varun, and Lucky are cons. Naidu, who is disciplined, punishes them for their misdeeds. On the other hand, Vijay turns into a very short-tempered man if one raises a finger towards him and always, in any case, Vijay keeps on breaking those fingers pointing him. Gopal stutters, while Lucky is a dumb person. While Vijay and Gopal emotionally blackmail Satya that they would have been happy if their father was there, Ajay, Varun and Lucky would emotionally blackmail Naidu that they would have been happy if their mother was there as she would support them and defend Naidu. Including Honey, only Naidu and Satya knew that the five men are orphans and Naidu and Satya sacrificed their love to raise them and still remained unmarried as their marriage was put on hold during their young days by Satya's father Subba Rao as Naidu was a poor man then. Honey somehow manages to unite them and get them married, and she makes arrangements to bring all the five men under one roof. Satya's sons and Naidu's sons often quarrel, until they realise they are orphans. They conceal the fact before their new parents that they knew about their identity in order to not to hurt them. Vijay is in love with Honey, and when Honey is going to propose to him, Suyodhana's son-in-law Siddha reaches Bangkok along with his men and forcibly takes her back to Kauravapuram in India.\nThe new family learns about the game of cards, its stipulations, and consequences from Dharmanna's friend, which makes Naidu promise Dharmanna that he would bring Honey back to Pandavapuram without any violence. Thus with reference to the Virata Parva of Mahabharata, the whole family enters Suyodhana's house in disguise. First, Naidu and Varun enter into the good books of Suyodhana's elder sons Guna and Gana and then enter the house as Graharaja, a powerful astrologer and Upagraharaja, his assistant. Satya, Lucky, and Gopal enter the house as Satya Menon, a Malayali cook, and her assistants. Vijay makes an entry as Gambler Gopi, a skilled gambler and fan of Suyodhana.

On the day of the marriage of Honey and Gaja, Mohini creates a brawl between the three brothers and fakes her death.\nIn order to escape from the clutches of Mohini's brother Mohan, a police officer, Graharaja advises to Suyodhana to conduct the marriage of Gopi and Honey so that Mohan, who is a police officer would punish Gopi for Mohini's death. Mohan turns out to be Ajay in a police uniform and since Suyodhana's family does not know about Ajay's identity, they remain silent. The marriage is conducted and after the rituals get completed, the drama is exposed to Suyodhana's family by Guna as he finds out that the corpse of Mohini thrown in the well was a doll.

No employee has children, nor do they remember anything about their own childhoods. One night, as Jon prepares a baby doll for shipment (a process that actually involves removing the sentient, living dolls from magical cabbages grown on the factory grounds), he witnesses his co-worker being beaten by guards after getting caught stealing one of the cabbages. Jon notices Yuri, the shady factory owner, watching from nearby. He hurries home to meet Mary, revealing that he himself got away with successfully stealing one of the cabbages, in which came an infant baby that he and Mary have lovingly named \"Daisy\". They both watch from across the street as another married couple, who also stole a cabbage baby, have Yuri and his dwarf henchman Kenny dispose of the baby in a garbage dumpster, after which the couple is dragged away and imprisoned.\nJon plans to flee Patch Town with Mary and Daisy, and meets with Darryl, a black-market smuggler, who reveals a file containing information on Jon's \"mother\", Bethany, the young child who purchased him from a shopping mall in the 1980s. Jon realizes that he, Mary and all the other employees of Patch Town are living human-sized adults of their former doll selves. Darryl explains that Yuri's father, an elderly immigrant, discovered the magical cabbages outside an outhouse one night many years earlier, and brought the cabbage dolls to life using an invention he made. Yuri, then a young boy, felt rejected by his father. When his father suddenly died from an apparent heart attack, he gave the land and the magical cabbages to his son, hoping that Yuri would take care of the cabbage dolls. Instead, Yuri marketed them as toys. Hoping to meet the now adult Bethany, Jon takes Mary and Daisy to the outskirts of Patch Town and the three are smuggled out by Sly, a Hindi former employee of Patch Town who had been an unpopular doll model. Sly gives Jon candy for the first time, and drives them in his hippie van (disguised as a food delivery truck) to Toronto, giving them a cheap, creepy but safe apartment and promising to bring them some comfortable furnishings to make it seem more like a home.\nMeanwhile, Yuri interrogates Darryl and a female prostitute from the local bar, and uses electroshock therapy to wipe their memories afterwards. He discovers the file on Bethany, and decides to have Kenny track the woman down. Kenny is beaten up by Bethany's preteen daughter, Avery, who is currently taking karate lessons, but Kenny manages to kidnap Avery anyway, leaving Bethany behind. Although Yuri is annoyed that Bethany was not captured, he decides to use Avery's likeness as a model for a more modern digital-age line of interactive dolls to keep Patch Enterprise up-to-date. Back in Toronto, Jon is hired on as a Santa Claus at a local shopping mall in order to earn his own money, while Sly joins in as a Christmas elf. Jon sees Bethany on a television screen at the mall, pleading for Avery's kidnappers to return her home. A gay couple shows Jon directions to Bethany's home, where he's promptly arrested by two R.C.M.P. officers who believe he is Avery's kidnapper after he claims to be Bethany's old childhood doll. Sly, who came along, is arrested, as well. Desperate for answers, Bethany decides to get the two out of jail in return for help in finding her daughter. Mary is angry with Jon, and Sly refuses to help, but eventually, they decide to join in for the sake of liberating the other employees of Patch Town, as well as Daisy.\nBethany is taken by Kenny and one of Yuri's other henchmen, and brought back to Patch Enterprises where she is told about the plan for Avery. Bethany is horrified upon learning that the doll-making process will kill Avery, but she feigns romantic attraction to Yuri in order to distract him so that Jon and Mary can infiltrate the factory. They find Darryl, his girlfriend, their married neighbours and the other employees all working, and gather them together in rebellion. Yuri realizes what has happened and prepares to fight back with the help of Kenny, but he breaks down crying when Jon confronts him, admitting that he only wanted a family of his own. Jon points out to Yuri that he already had a family in all of his employees, and the employees decide to use the electroshock therapy machine on Yuri himself to clear his memories and make him more docile. Bethany thanks Jon, and returns home with Avery after accepting a drive back to Toronto from Sly. Jon stays in Patch Town to start a new, free life with Mary and Daisy.

Despite her worries that chess is becoming an obsession, his mother takes him to an adult chess club, where he impresses the resident chess master and is accepted as a student. Bobby enters the world of professional chess championships and soon becomes the youngest grandmaster ever.\nBobby's hatred of distractions leads to frequent tantrums. He enters a team tournament in Varna, Bulgaria, where he realizes Soviet grandmasters are deliberately drawing games with the collusion of the World Chess Federation. Erupting in a rant that this system makes it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win the championship, Bobby quits the tournament and gives up chess.\nWhen Bobby returns to the U.S., lawyer Paul Marshall offers to help him modify the tournament rules, working pro bono to give Fischer a fair chance to win future tournaments. Fischer re-enters professional chess and selects Father William Lombardy, a former World Junior Chess Champion and Roman Catholic priest, as his second. Lombardy struggles to calm Bobby's rock-star behavior and impossible demands.\nAs his demands are accepted, Bobby overcomes most grandmasters across the world and nears the world championship, becoming a hero to the American public. At the height of the Cold War, Soviet domination of the World Chess Championship is being exploited for propaganda as proof that the Communist system is superior to American democracy. U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger closely monitor and encourage Bobby's progress.\nPrivately, Lombardy tells Marshall that excessive focus on chess strategy has destroyed the sanity of the game's greatest players.\nDuring a tournament in Santa Monica, California, Bobby loses to Soviet grandmaster Boris Spassky, the world champion. The next morning, an enraged Bobby approaches and berates Spassky on the beach.\nAs he pursues the world championship, the pressure drives Bobby into paranoia and delusional psychosis. Meeting with Marshall, Bobby's sister Joan quotes from her brother's letters about how the Communists collude with International Jewry to destroy him. Joan explains that Bobby believes this despite being Jewish himself and pleads with Marshall to arrange for Bobby to receive psychiatric help. Marshall is dismissive, but as Bobby's breakdown escalates, he suggests to Lombardy that Bobby needs therapy and medication, which Lombardy rebuffs.\nReporters and fans from around the world assemble at Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, to witness the historic World Chess Championship 1972 match between Bobby and Spassky. Bobby loses the first game and fails to appear for the second, losing it by forfeit. Bobby is easily distracted by small noises from the audience, rolling cameras, and the hard sound of the chessboard, which leads him to make extreme demands for silence and fewer distractions, which could cause another forfeit. Spassky, insulted by the possibility of maintaining his title by forfeit, orders the Soviet entourage to accede to Bobby's demands.\nBobby wins the third game by unconventional tactics. Game four is a draw, but Bobby wins game five after Spassky himself begins showing paranoia signs. Experts speculate the next game will determine the outcome of the match.

They were later deployed by Albion to various points of Calixto, a parallel world inhabited by Ilonggo folk creatures.\nAs this was happening in Calixto, two boys, Abet and Nathan, who lived in Iloilo City, Calixto's parallel world, cut class to play Pikyaw (an antiquated Filipino game) against Marco; a bully who is believed to be the best in the game. Along the way, they met Tyrone after Abet accidentally ripped Tyrone's bag. Abet and Nathan escaped the scene as Tyrone shouts for them to replace his bag. Meanwhile, two dwarves, Unico and Auros, were discussing between themselves of the potentials of Nathan and Marco as champions who they'll bring to Calixto and help them on their fight against Albion. Unico was very happy of getting two big and agile children, but Auros seems to be focused on Abet and his good heart. During the climax of the exciting Pikyaw game between Nathan and Marco, Tyrone came over the playing field with his mother so they can force Abet to replace his bag. While this exchange was going on, Auros alerted Unico that the champions have now gathered and it is time for them to take the champions to Calixto.\nA bright light suddenly enveloped the playing field.

They were able to discover the plan of Albion to abduct Rebecca, Tyrone's househelp, and were able to stop it. The heroes fought with Craston and Kaeg to protect Rebecca from Albion, from which they recovered the Sword of the Mahentoy (Cyclopes) and the Bow of the Encantada (Fairies). After this, they hid at Jaro Cathedral where they met Unico.\nUnico explained that Albion (or Terrence as he is known in Iloilo) was one of the children that they took to Calixto as a playmate. This is not an unusual event in Filipino folklore: dwarves abducting children with special abilities/characteristics as playthings. The abduction is supposed to be temporary since the dwarves will have to bring the children back to their families to avoid detection. However, the situation changed when Terrence found a plate of black rice and began to eat some. According to folklore, once you eat food from Calixto, you won't be able to go back until the next selenelion, a rare phenomenon where the moon becomes red due to a lunar eclipse occurring at dawn or dusk. The dwarves, realizing that they have a rare opportunity to keep Terrence, passed up on several chances to bring him back to Iloilo. Terrence resented the dwarves for not doing anything to bring him back and left the dwarves. He rechristened himself as Albion, and with the support of the other folk creatures, set out on revenge against the dwarves.\nSaref was able to follow the heroes at Jaro Cathedral and fought with Tyrone and Marco, who took the Bow of the Encantada and the Sword of the Mahentoy, respectively. Their new weapons were able to spawn them new armor as well, and they held Saref off while Abet, Rebecca, and Unico escaped. During the escape, Unico found out that Abet holds half of the weapon of the dwarves: the Sticks of the Dwarves. Unico persuaded Abet to help Tyrone and Marco and gave him the other half of the weapon. When Abet combined the two weapons, he became Lakan, the champion of the dwarves, proficient in the use of Arnis, a Filipino martial art. The three were able to fight off Saref and bound her to the Jaro Belfry. Saref told them that they were too late to save Calixto, since the red moon has appeared and Rebecca isn't saved. It turned out that Saref was trying to save Rebecca from the dwarves.\nUnico revealed to Rebecca that Calixto's happiness depended on the dwarves' ability to control the psyche of Calixto. The dwarves' happiness will reflect on Calixto's, therefore their need to take Rebecca as replacement to Albion. Nathan, now the champion of the Kapres wielding a heavy ax, stalled Unico's plan until he was stopped by Abet, Tyrone and Marco. Nathan was helped later by Craston, Kaeg, Agas and Saref. Behind them is Albion, who took Rebecca and Unico. He knocked Unico unconscious and asked Nathan to start the ceremony: kill him and save Rebecca, which will stop the dwarves' system indefinitely. Nathan was later disarmed by Abet, Tyrone and Marco. Albion retaliated and held off Tyrone and Marco and forced Abet to kill him. Abet, left without any choices, changed to Lakan and proceeded to give Albion the killer blow.\nRebecca, realizing that Calixto will not return to normal, interrupted the whole ceremony and sacrificed her future, accepting her fate as Albion's replacement. Albion was adamant that the ceremony continue and persuaded Rebecca not to do it, for she will never be happy in Calixto. Rebecca dismissed this, believing that making others happy is enough to make her happy.

Smitha requests Kunal to wait downstairs while she goes upstairs to retrieve change. Almost immediately, there is power failure, which alarms Kunal. While waiting downstairs completely alone in the dark, Kunal hears a loud unidentifiable noise from the bedroom upstairs. Going up to investigate, he finds Smitha murdered suspiciously and notices one slice the pizza he had delivered to be missing, suggesting that there may be somebody else in the house.

Jaggu's father objects to their relationship, citing difference in their religions. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.\nJaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.\nA flashback shows how, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh, who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. The alien begins speaking, and after learning of the whole scenario, Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour, people assume he is drunk and call him \"peekay\" or \"PK\" (Hindi for drunk); the alien adopts PK as a name (his people have no language and thus no names). People tell PK that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find \"God\", to no avail. He later discovers that Tapasvi has his remote, who claims it was a gift from God and refuses to return it. Jaggu promises PK that she will recover his remote and he can go back home.\nPK conjectures, as Jaggu plays a prank on an unknown caller, that Tapasvi and other godmen must be dialling a \"wrong number\" to communicate with God and are advising the public to engage in meaningless rituals. Jaggu encourages the public to expose fraudulent godmen by sending their videos to her news channel. This \"wrong number\" campaign turns into a popular mass movement, to the dismay of Tapasvi. Meanwhile, Bhairon finds the thief and contacts PK, telling him that he sold his remote to Tapasvi. PK realises that Tapasvi was a fraud all along and that it was not a \"wrong number\". Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack.\nTapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away. He claims he has a direct connection to God and refers to his prediction of Sarfaraz's betrayal to try to prove that Muslims are liars. PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\nJaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi, implying that he still loves Jaggu. That day, Sarfaraz found the same letter and thought it was from Jaggu, and did not call her as he understood she was under familial pressure. Jaggu and Sarfaraz reconnect, and Tapasvi is forced by Jaggu's father to return PK's remote.\nMeanwhile, PK has fallen in love with Jaggu but refrains from telling her because she loves Sarfaraz.

He lies to Jaggu that the tapes contain a variety of Earthly noises which he will miss, such as crows and car horns.

PK does not even look back while going as he doesn't want her to see him in tears which will give away his love for her.

The only survivor, a boy named Milo, whose parents Corvus personally killed, is captured by slave traders.\nSeventeen years later, in Londinium in 79 A.D., slave owner Graecus watches a class of gladiators battle, unimpressed until he sees the grown Milo, a talented gladiator the crowds call \"the Celt\". Milo is soon brought to Pompeii with his fellow slaves. On the road, they see a horse fall while drawing a carriage carrying Cassia, returning after a year in Rome, and her servant Ariadne. Milo kills the horse to end its suffering, and Cassia is drawn to him. Cassia is the daughter of the city governor Severus and his wife Aurelia. Severus is hoping to have the new Emperor Titus invest in plans to rebuild Pompeii, despite Cassia's warning of Rome becoming more corrupt. Felix, a servant, takes Cassia\u2019s horse Vires for a ride only to be swallowed up when a quake from Mount Vesuvius opens up the ground under him.\nIn Pompeii, Milo develops a rivalry with Atticus, a champion gladiator who, by Roman law, will be given his freedom after he earns one more victory. The gladiators are shown off at a party where Corvus, now a Senator, tells Severus the Emperor will not invest in his plans but he himself will. It is revealed Cassia left Rome to escape Corvus\u2019s advances. When an earthquake causes some horses to become anxious, Milo helps calm one down. He then takes Cassia on a ride and tells her they cannot be together. Returning to the villa, Corvus is ready to kill Milo (not recognizing him from the village massacre), but Cassia pleads for Milo's life. Milo is lashed for his actions, and Atticus admits respect for his rival as they prepare to face each other at the upcoming festival.\nIn the Amphitheatre of Pompeii, to punish Milo, Corvus orders him killed in the first battle, and wicked trainer Bellator convinces Graecus to sacrifice Atticus, as well. The two men, and other gladiators, are chained to rocks as other gladiators come out as Roman soldiers, to recreate Corvus\u2019 victory over the Celts. Working together, Milo and Atticus survive the battle; Atticus realizes the Romans will never honor his freedom. During the battle, Corvus forces Cassia to agree to marry him by threatening to have her family killed for supposed treason against the Emperor. When Milo and Atticus win, Cassia defies Corvus by holding a \u201cthumbs-up\u201d for them to live, and Corvus has her taken to the villa to be locked up. Claiming an earthquake is a sign from Vulcan, Corvus has his officer Proculus fight Milo one-on-one. Their battle is interrupted when Mount Vesuvius erupts, creating massive tremors that cause the arena to collapse, sending Milo and Proculus crashing to the dungeons. Milo opens up the gates to allow his fellow gladiators a chance to attack; Proculus escapes, while the gladiators kill Bellator. Seeing Corvus fallen under a collapsed beam, Severus tries to kill him, but Corvus stabs him instead and escapes.\nThe eruption sends flaming debris raining down upon the city as the populace tries to flee to the harbor. One fireball destroys and sinks a ship, killing the escaping Graecus. Before dying, Aurelia tells Milo that Cassia is at the villa. Milo races to the villa and manages to save Cassia, but Ariadne is killed when the villa collapses into the Mediterranean Sea. Atticus tries to reach the harbor, but a tsunami created by the volcano smashes into the city, destroying the harbour and the outer walls, and smashing several ships. Reuniting with Atticus, Milo suggests searching the arena for horses to escape. As the gladiators face Roman soldiers at the arena, Cassia is abducted by Corvus after finding her parents' bodies. Atticus has Milo chase after the chariot carrying the two while he fights Proculus. Atticus is mortally wounded in the duel, but nonetheless manages to kill Proculus.\nMilo chases Corvus across the city; both barely avoid fireballs, and collapsing infrastructure.

Cassia chains Corvus to a building, as Milo declares who he is, that Corvus killed his family and now his gods are coming to punish the Senator. Milo and Cassia ride off as a pyroclastic surge races into the city, incinerating Corvus. At the arena, Atticus proudly proclaims that he dies a free man before being consumed by the pyroclastic flow. At the city outskirts, the horse throws off Milo and Cassia. Milo tells Cassia to leave him, realising the horse isn't fast enough to carry them both. Instead, she sends the horse off, not wanting to spend her last moments running, and knowing they cannot outrun the surge. Milo kisses Cassia as the surge engulfs them.

Amidst all this, her baby was abducted by an unidentified man. Resenting her lover for ruining her life, Jane adopted the name of John and eventually moved to New York City.\nThe agent offers John the chance to take revenge on his lover scot-free, in return for John taking over the agent's job. The agent time travels with John to Cleveland in 1963, admitting that he works for Robertson's secret agency, the Temporal Bureau, which uses time travel to prevent crimes. Following instructions for finding Jane in the past, John unwittingly falls in love with his younger self and realizes that the agent set him up to become Jane's lover. Despite knowing that their love is doomed, John cannot bring himself to break off their relationship.\nDeviating from his mission, the agent illegally time travels to March 1975 to pursue the Fizzle Bomber once more. The Fizzle Bomber beats him in combat, leaving him to witness, and help, his earlier burned self. The agent expects to be punished by execution, but Robertson excuses him, dismissing the Bureau's protocols.\nContinuing his mission, the agent brings Jane's baby, born from her self-fertilization by John, back in time to the Cleveland orphanage in 1945. Thus, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a predestination paradox. The agent returns to 1963 and convinces John to leave Jane at the preordained time, inducting John into the Temporal Bureau in 1985 and completing his mission. Robertson extols the importance of John's future role at the Bureau as a unique operative with no ties to the past or future. The agent still regrets his failure to stop the Fizzle Bomber, but Robertson credits the Fizzle Bomber for motivating the Bureau's growth and success.\nThe agent chooses to retire to New York City in 1975 shortly before the March attack; arriving, he decommissions his time-travel device as planned, but the device remains operational. He also finds that Robertson gave him an exact location and time where the Fizzle Bomber will be found. There, he discovers that the Fizzle Bomber is his future self, who claims that his bombings averted greater death tolls in alternate futures. The Bomber also claims that Robertson set up this path for him. Vowing that he will not become the Bomber, the agent guns down his older self.\nJohn's surgical scars are shown on the agent's body, confirming that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person. Robertson knowingly orchestrated this agent's existence, responsible for both his own conception and death. On a tape recording left for John, the agent contemplates whether the future can be changed.", "tmdb_id": 206487}, "43693441": {"title": "Prelude to Axanar", "plot": "The film is presented as one episode of a Federation documentary pertaining to a \"Four Years War\" (a supplement of FASA's Star Trek: The Role Playing Game in the 1980s) with the Klingon Empire, narrated by fictional noted historian John Gill (who appeared in \"Patterns of Force\") and featuring interviews of participants on both sides. The events depicted reportedly precede Star Trek: The Original Series by two decades, with the war's opening battle at Arcanis IV, a prosperous Federation colony along the Klingon border. The Klingons, who did not consider the Federation to be a worthy adversary, maintained the initiative for the first six months of the war, with a number of victories under the leadership of their supreme commander, Kharn. The Vulcan diplomatic delegation under Ambassador Soval (who appeared on Star Trek: Enterprise), overseeing negotiations with the Klingons, are left with little room to maneuver.\nIn response to the losses suffered in the war, Starfleet appoints a new Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Marcus Ramirez, who pledges in a fleet-wide broadcast to defend \"the dream of the Federation\" against the Klingons' commitment to its destruction. Ramirez oversees the creation of the Ares-class cruisers, Starfleet's first warships, to counter the Klingons' mainstay, the D6 battlecruiser. The introduction of the Ares turns the tide against the Klingons, who begin to give Starfleet its due as a worthy opponent, and particularly take notice of Garth of Izar (who appeared in \"Whom Gods Destroy\"), the captain of the prototype USS Ares.\nTo counter the Ares cruisers, the Klingons order the construction of a newer and more advanced battlecruiser, the D7, that would restore the Klingons' technical and military advantage. In response, Starfleet begins developing their own next-generation heavy cruiser, the Constitution-class, but construction falls behind schedule. To gain more time to finish their new heavy cruiser, Starfleet approves a plan proposed by Garth to fight the Klingons at Axanar, the planet where Kharn's spies have reported the Constitution prototypes (revealed to be the Constitution and the Enterprise) are being built.

Frustrated by the lack of response, the activists instead decide to take their donations directly to a small mining village named Onllwyn in Wales.

Satwant Kaur now feeds poor children and her son's  best friend Bittu, a Hindu. It's revealed that Satwant's son, Shiva went to work in the field one year ago and never came back. To cope with the loss, Satwant treats Bittu as her son, much to the jealousy and anger of his Hindu parents. Bittu moves on to take Satwant Kaur to a human-rights lawyer who is known to have found many boys who were kidnapped by the Punjab Police and keeps a record of the boys who were killed in fake encounters.\nThe story then flashes back to 1984, a day before Operation Blue Star. Shivjeet, or Shiva, is a college going young adult who is an avid fan of Kuldeep Manak and loves Jeeti his classmate. Jeeti also reciprocates his feelings. Shiva is having a land feud with his corrupt and drug-addicted cousin Jaggi, who is best friends with the village Inspector Deep Singh Rana. Inspector Deep Singh Rana enters, a sadistic, apathetic, police officer who kills innocent Sikhs for rank promotions and under orders from the Central Government. While facing Jaggi and Rana, Shiva guarantees that none of them can plough his land while he's still alive. At home, Shiva has an argument with his father because his father is a law-abiding and court-going man while Shiva believes that none other than the almighty guarantees his rights. Satwant Kaur reveals to Shiva of her knowledge of his secretive dating of Jeeti. In the morning, Bachan Singh leaves for Amritsar.\nWhen Shiva, Bittu, and Satwant wake up in the morning, they find out that all of Punjab is under Military Rule and that there is an indefinite Curfew upon the entire state. There is an entire media blackout, with the only news coming from the Military Radio Channel, which is only referring to Operation Blue Star as a minor incident occurring in Amritsar. The entire state is at a standstill while everyone is listening to the Radio updates on the situation in Amritsar. Meanwhile, Bachan Singh is trapped in the Darbar Sahib complex. Against Army orders, the village gurdwara announces that in reality, the Army has invaded Darbar Sahib with tanks and gunner helicopters and the entire city of Amritsar is being shelled. Bittu and Shiva then proceed to sneak their way to Amritsar on their tractor to try to find out whats happening. They encounter an Army blockade on the road to Amritsar, where countless people are pushing against the barricade to make their way to Amritsar, just as Shiv and Bittu are. In the entire situation, Shiv is rifle-butted by soldiers and countless protesters have been killed.\nAfter the Operation, Bittu, Satwant, and Shiva go to the Emergency Police Station, to try to find out the whereabouts of Bachan Singh. The police officers treat them badly as it's found out that the government declared Bachan Singh a terrorist who took up arms against the state and executed him. The next person in the line of people at the police station, whose brother was also at the Golden Temple, was meanwhile declared a peaceful pilgrim killed in \"cross fire.\" When Bittu asks for Bachan's remains, the police say that the Army already incinerated all evidence of the \"terrorists.\"\nShiva has now left college, doesn't use his radio any more due to the broadcast of Operation Blue Star coming on it, and spends his days working and mourning on the farm to cope with the loss of his father. To help cheer Shiva up, his mother places the radio in the courtyard and talks about selling it. The reverse-psychology works and Shiv starts playing Kuldip Manak songs loudly on the radio while going to the fields. While working in the fields, Rana shows up and changes Shiv's radio's channel to the news, which is informing of a \"terrorist\" attack in Tarn Taran, with the police looking for the culprits. Shiv's mute friend immediately runs to Satwant Kaur's house, where she doesn't understand what he's trying to say until the boy makes the sound of a \"kutti,\" referring to the stopper on a \"Halt\" well system, meaning one thing: Shiv's in trouble.\nThe story flashes back to 1986, where the Human Rights Lawyer asks Satwant to check the record of the youth killed in fake encounters. Fortunately, Shivjeet is not in the album or list of those killed. Satwant and Bittu then go to the local politician Darshan Singh Poonpuri, a peace loving separatist, who vows to help them find Shiv.\nWhen Bittu comes Home, his parents scold him for staying out and helping someone else's parent's instead of his own. His parents also accuse him of helping out a \"terrorists\" mother in a time where Hindus are being targeted. Bittu replies that it is going just as bad for the Sikhs as it is for the Hindus. Jeeti's aunt and uncle attempt to convince her to marry someone else, since it isn't sure if Shiva is alive or not.\nWhen Satwant Kaur goes to the police station as she does daily, a news reporter from a prominent news outlet tries to interview and record her story. However, the stationed police officers find out from their superiors that the Human Rights organisation has found out about Shivjeet and has taken the case to the central government. Rana comes outside and beats the journalist brutally and shamelessly beat the elderly Satwant Kaur to near unconsciousness.\nOne of the police officers working for Rana, also known for haven killing many innocents, secretly comes to Satwant Kaur's home to reveal to her what really happened to Shiva: Shiva was picked up and beaten to unconsciousness while being \"interrogated\" for \"terrorism.\" Later, Rana and the police officer who has come to Satwant tried to kill Shiva and four other youths in a fake encounter, successfully killing two. Shiva refused to run in front of the police and was able to overpower Rana and escape with Taari and Pinda. When the Police Officer tries to leave, Satwant Kaur requests that he eat at her house, returning the favour that he did upon her and so that when her son is ever in a condition like this, someone may feed him too. The policeman leaves in shame after realising what his actions have been and while leaving, tells Satwant Kaur where Pinda might be.\nWhen Bittu and Satwant Kaur go to the police station where Pinda might be, the police inspector tells them that he never heard of said lad. Bittu and Satwant Kaur then proceed to Pinda's house, whose family tell them that they haven't seen Pinda in a year themselves. While leaving, Satwant requests Pinda's family that if Pinda ever comes by, do ask him about Shivjeet. Right before they leave the gate, Pinda's mother stops them and reveals that they were lying; In fact, Pinda was tortured by the police when he was captured after his escape and was crippled. He is currently living in hiding in their house, after his parents bribed the Inspector that Satwant talked to earlier. Pinda immediately recognises Satwant as Shiv's mother, since Shiv always talked about her. Pinda begins to talk about what happened.\nOne year ago, after escaping the police, Shiv, Taari, and Pinda went into hiding on Taari's relatives farm and began telling each other how they all came into police custody.\nTaari was a separatist poet and journalist for a couple of Print Magazines and News Papers. Taari was friends with Rebel Sukhdev Singh Sarhali, due to which Taari was arrested under TADA. However, the real reason Taari was arrested was so that he couldn't write more Revolutionary Poetry. The police subsequently crippled his writing hand. Shivjeet then recalls that he recited Taari's poems in college for multiple school projects.\nPinda was a college going young adult who beat up a man who was eves teasing his girlfriend. The man he beat up turned out to be the son of a Police Inspector, who arrested Pinda. When Pinda was given a chance to apologise and spare himself, the police ordered him to get a rakhri tied on his wrist by his girlfriend, accepting each other as brother and sister. Pinda, once again, beat up the police officer's son. In revenge, the police inspector slapped fake TADA charges against him. When being tortured, Pinda attempted Suicide rather than face the humiliation of being tortured by police.\nAfter discussing their pasts, the three visit Sukhdev Singh Sarhali, a separatist who was Pinda's acquaintance. Sarhali convinces the three to join the separatist's cause. The three due to the miseries and injustices they faced, agree, after which Sarhali Sends the three across the border where they undergo their training for a year.\nUpon their return Sarhali sends them on a mission to eliminate SSP Jagat Ram, a police officer who gained promotions on the basis of fake encounters whose protege was Deep Singh Rana, the police officer who had earlier tried to kill the three. Sarhali's initial plan was to eliminate him on the day of sagraand (native new month) as he visits the Golden Temple. But Shiv convinces him that he should be killed inside his headquarters to terrorise the police department even further. The three reach the headquarters according to the plan, disguised as police constables themselves. Shiva was able to successfully intrude into SSP Jagat Ram's office under the pretext of getting a file pertaining to encounters from the DIG office signed. As Shiv stabs him in the neck, Jagat Ram is able to alert every one in the headquarters using the sound of a gunshot. In the chaos that ensues, Pinda is captured by the police while Shiv is shot three times but is able to escape.\nThe story again flash forwards to Pinda's narrative where he tells Satwant Kaur that Shiva is dead. But it is shown that Shiva is not dead. Shiva and Taari are alive. Taari and Shiva were rescued by Sarhali. Satwant Kaur is not able to believe that Shiva is dead. Satwant Kaur again reaches the police station and Rana beat her badly. Then, Shiva's cousin, Jaggi tries to take Shiva's land. While Jaggi was ploughing the land, Shiva comes in between and kills Jaggi. Shiva's mute friend Titli tells Satwant Kaur about Shiva being alive. Satwant Kaur becomes very happy on listening this and decides to tell Jeeti about this. When Satwant Kaur reaches Jeeti's home she finds her alliance being fixed with a police officer, so she decides not to tell Jeeti about it. However, Jeeti is unhappy as Jeeti loves Shiva. While shopping for her wedding, she meets Shiva in the market. She requests Shiva to take her along with him. Shiva refuses as this might be dangerous for Jeeti's life. Jeeti refuses to marry another man, but Shiva convinces her. Jeeti unwillingly agrees. Jeeti marries another man but she is still unhappy. Shiva and Taari are given a bomb to plant in a bus. Shiva plants it but then sees Satwant Kaur and Bittu travelling in the same bus. Then he removes the bomb. Sarhali is angry at him. Bittu is travelling in a bus carrying Satwant Kaur's spectacles. The bus is stopped by terrorists in the middle and Bittu being a Hindu gets killed. Bittu 's mother curses Satwant Kaur that she would face the same. Then Sarhali, Shiva and Taari are attending a meeting in Jalandar where they meet a politician named Darshan Singh Poonpuri. Darshan says that killing innocent Hindu people is not good. They should stop this. Shiva likes his thoughts. But a man in the council opposes this. While travelling back from the meeting Shiva doubts that man for having a relation in the killing of innocent Hindus and Sikhs. He shares this with Taari and Sarhali. Sarhali orders them to kill him.\nThere Shiva and Taari goes to kill that man. The man before dying reveals that he's not one of the culprits. The man dies. Then Shiva and Taari realises that the culprits involved in killing of innocent Hindus and Sikhs in Tarn Taran are Sarhali and Darshan who were using Shiva and Taari for their own selfish purposes. Darshan and Sarhali wants to form their own government so that's why they were planting bombs to create massacre.\nShiva and Taari are able to run away from them to reach home but Taari is killed in the middle way. Shiva avenged Taari's death by killing Sarhali and Darshan. Shiva calls Inspector Rana and challenges him that he would reach his home and Rana could do nothing. Rana accepts it and says that Shiva would not be able to cross the village bridge. Shiva accepts it. Rana with his officers are waiting on the bridge. There a truck came and Shiva was hiding in it. Shiva kills all the officers. Shiva and Rana lead to a big fight. Shiva kills Rana, but is himself injured. Shiva is able to reach his village street and shouts out loud \"Jo Bole so nihal sat sri akal\". Shiva reaches his home and knocks the door saying \"Bebe Main Ghar aa gaya. Darwaza Khol Bebe.\" Satwant Kaur opens the door. Shiva hugs her and says she is hungry Bebe. Satwant Kaur emotionally asks him to come inside. But just as Shiva is about to step into the house, Jeeti's husband shot him because Jeeti's husband thought Shiva of being a terrorist. Shiva dies in the lap of Satwant Kaur. Upon seeing Shiva dead, Jeeti breaks her marriage with the officer by removing her choorha (traditional red bangles which every Punjabi bride wears in her marriage) symbolising that she had been a widow of Shivjeet as she always had feelings for Shivjeet not her husband. It also meant that she has broken all ties with her husband. Then Bittu's mother come to console Satwant Kaur. Satwant Kaur cries inconsolably by seeing Shiva's lifeless body lying in her lap.

Grass had inadvertently run down and killed Barnes's son, Nicholas, while driving drunk the day before the previous year's Purge; Grass was acquitted of the crime on a legal technicality due to Nicholas having died of his injuries on Purge night.

Brian and Jane become closer and share a kiss. When the group experience another attack by Evey, Brian goes to Oxford, where he discovers that a symbol that was marked into Jane is from a cult who worshiped a Sumerian demon. They performed experiments on a young girl a few years ago; their leader believed that Evey Dwyer, a girl with clairvoyant abilities, was the one to bring their \"idol\" into the physical world. Everybody in the cult died in a house fire that Evey set, including Evey herself. Brian returns and tells them about the cult, certain that Evey is a demonic presence who is possessing Jane. He convinces Harry and Krissi, but Coupland denies his theory and responds that Evey must be a figment from Jane's past rather than a demonic force.\nAfter a heated argument, the group are marked with the same symbol Jane had. An unknown force murders Krissi and Harry. Jane realizes that she was the little girl that supposedly died in the house fire; she was born with clairvoyant powers and had set the house on fire to kill everyone. The authorities changed her name to Jane to give her a normal life, which is why negative energy is manifesting; Evey is not a demon, she is Jane's real identity (one who can't escape the trauma of her past life). Evey then attacks Brian, only for them both to be knocked out by Coupland. When Brian wakes up, he sees Coupland give Jane a lethal injection, as he thinks stopping her heart long enough for the negative energy to dissipate will permanently cure her. However, before Coupland can prove his theory, Brian subdues Coupland and brings Jane back to life. Once revived, Jane locks him out of the room and commits suicide by setting herself on fire.\nThe screen cuts to film footage, apparently from several months later, showing Brian sitting in a chair and holding a camera. An unseen speaker asks him about the deaths, to which Brian replies that everything was captured on film. The speaker replies that there is nothing on the film, and that everything in the house, including the films, were destroyed by the fire. When the speaker asks if Brian is responsible, Brian laughs manically and his hand starts to smoke, just as Jane's did.", "tmdb_id": 193612}, "40722696": {"title": "Ra (2014 film)", "plot": "Renya, Ajay's wife, had died mysteriously on the very first day of their marriage.

At the same time, Nigel plots to exact revenge on Blu along with his new comrades, an anteater named Charlie and a poison dart frog named Gabi. After they arrive at the jungle, Blu, his family, and their friends initially find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in an uncharted section of the Amazon. There, Jewel is reunited with her long-lost father, Eduardo, paternal aunt Mimi, and childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu, but thanks him for bringing Jewel back home. Having lost their previous habitat to arson from the illegal loggers Eduardo is anti-human, and  brushes off Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection.\nWhile searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually captured by the loggers. Meanwhile, Blu does his best to fit in with the flock, as his family are doing, but his continued reliance on human tools prevent him from connecting with anyone. Meanwhile, in another attempt to get closer to Blu, a disguised Nigel wins a talent show to become a performer for a Carnival show that Rafael, Pedro, Nico and Carla are hosting. When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the scarlet macaws, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally swats Felipe with a branch. The war turns out to be a football (soccer) match, but Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory when he scores on his team's own goal.\nAfter an argument with Jewel, Blu ultimately decides that he will leave Linda and his human roots behind him for the sake of his family, but when he witnesses the loggers\u2019 destruction of the forest, he returns to the flock and rallies them, finally gaining Eduardo's trust. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, the flock disable the loggers' machinery. During the fight, Eduardo flies into a tractor and gets knocked onto the ground. As the tractor attempts to kill him, Linda tackles the machine in another tractor and wins. As Eduardo is on the ground between the tractors, Tulio picks him up and lets him fly away.

Tommy holds up the cashier with a pistol while Rosie waited in the car she inherited from her father. Tommy is arrested and sent to prison for 18 months. In the meantime, Rosie gets a job at a debt collection agency run by Dave Lovell (Dunne), who went to jail for bilking major companies out of $800,000 through fraudulent invoices. Lovell reformed his life and mainly hires ex-cons at his firm. He is happy to give Tommy a job and a second chance. Tommy is restless and instead of following the call script, he often counsels people on how to defraud Lovell's company.\nWhen Tommy sees some mafiosos in his neighborhood, he grows enraged. He calls them fat old guys living off their reputation, and he resents the way the mafia treated his father. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Tommy's father started his shop with a mafia loan, and he suffered frequent beatings when he was late with payments. Tommy's mother and brother still run the shop, but his mother blames Tommy's criminal activity for breaking her husband's heart and leading to his death. Whereas, Tommy blames his father's death completely on the humiliation he suffered at the hands of the mafia.\nTommy skips work one day to attend the trial of John Gotti. He watches Sammy the Bull's testimony, and he perks up when Sammy explains that no guns are allowed in mafia social clubs. He cases one of the clubs that Sammy mentioned, and then he pitches the idea to rob the club to Rosie. He explains that it will be safe since no one will have a gun, and that the mafia would never call the cops to report the crime. He gets an Uzi, which he does not know how to use. Rosie reluctantly shows him how to load it, and agrees to the plan.\nDuring the robbery, Tommy shoots the Uzi wildly in the air, eventually convincing the mafiosi to hand over their jewelry and cash rolls. He also humiliates them by messing with their hair and making them simulate having gay sex with each other. He leaves the club by shooting up the walls and saying, \"This is for Frankie Uva\". Rosie and Tommy are thrilled with their score, but the mafia are furious. Sal (Rispoli) consults with his boss, Big Al Fiorello (Garcia), about what to do. Big Al wants the duo found and scared, but not killed, because of the heavy scrutiny on the mob due to Gotti's trial.\nTommy and Rosie eventually run out of money and rob another club. Tommy humiliates the mobsters this time by making them strip to their underwear. FBI Agents have the club under surveillance, and they are stunned at the sound of gunfire. When Tommy flees, the mobsters chase after him out of the club. Agent Frank Hurd (Whaley) photographs several of them standing on the street in their underwear looking bewildered.\nHurd shares the story with New York Post columnist Jerry Cardozo (Romano), even reluctantly agreeing to let Cardozo publish one of the pictures. It becomes a front-page story, and a deep humiliation to the mob. Tommy and Rosie convince Lovell to skip work one day and attend the trial with them. Lovell is as enthralled by Sammy the Bull's testimony as they are. Sammy mentions another social club (The Waikiki). On the way back to the office, Lovell notices an Uzi under a blanket in the back seat.\nWhen Tommy robs the Waikiki club, he is dismayed that there are only three very old men in there playing cards. One of them, Joey D (Young) begs for his wallet back, claiming it is a gift from his dead wife. In the wallet, Tommy and Rosie discover a list of the entire mafia organization, including names, ranks, phone numbers, and addresses. They decide to warn the mafia that they have the list, because they feel it is insurance against retribution. Rosie even calls Big Al at home to warn him that they have the list.\nBig Al is furious at Sal, who explains that Joey D had the list because Sal thought no one would think such an old man had such an important piece of evidence. The list is essentially a phone tree, meant to function as a pass by mobsters who get arrested. The mobster under arrest calls the guy with the list to signal he will not be cooperating with authorities, and the guy with the list notifies everyone on it so that they can know the authorities are bluffing if they say that the arrested mobster has turned into an informant. The FBI has always wanted such a document because it undermines the standard mafia defense that they are not a real organization.\nBig Al summons everyone to a meeting and puts out a contract on Tommy and Rosie, who have become known as \"Bonnie and Clyde\". Meanwhile, Rosie calls Cardozo to complain that he has underreported the number of clubs that they robbed. She sets up an interview with Cardozo, and after initially protesting, Tommy joins her in talking to Cardozo. His profile of the couple only humiliates the mafia further, but it draws far too much attention to Tommy and Rosie. After reading the article, Lovell warns Rosie about the danger she is in.\nOne day when Sal is driving through the neighborhood, he nearly runs into Tommy and Rosie, who he recognizes because of their car. He follows them to their apartment, and he is stunned to find they live 3 blocks from the first club they robbed.

Cardozo is outraged to learn that the FBI will not give Tommy and Rosie any protection for the role that they played in the investigation. Cardozo tries to give airline tickets to Mexico to Tommy and Rosie. He warns them that they are in way over their heads. Tommy and Rosie claim they have a plan. They drive into Manhattan to view the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree and the holiday windows on Fifth Avenue.

Led by CEO Raymond Sellars, the company moves to market its technology to domestic law enforcement. However, the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of militarized drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to come up with an alternative. The result is a proposal for a cyborg police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.\nA Detroit police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon as revenge for Murphy's investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphy's wife, Clara, to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, a frustrated Murphy escapes, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), respiratory organs, heart, and right hand, a disgusted Murphy asks for euthanasia. Norton reminds Murphy about his wife's and son's patience, convincing him to live. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones efficiently. Norton alters Murphy's programming to make him more efficient by letting drone programming take over his actions, making Murphy think they are his. This re-programming increases Murphy's efficiency dramatically, but leaves him less empathetic, due to his human nature being bypassed. That night, Murphy goes to his house to meet Clara and his son David to make sure they are okay, comforting David.\nShortly before he is publicly unveiled, the entire police database is uploaded to RoboCop's system, including the Alex Murphy crime scene, leading Murphy to have an emotional breakdown, forcing Norton to suppress his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.\nClara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son David's nightmares, social withdrawal, and unresponsive behavior. The experience drives Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son had PTSD after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallon's gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons but manages to kill Vallon and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis. They confront the two corrupt police officers who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tasing the other. Learning that the Chief of Police was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her but is remotely shut down by Mattox.\nWith the help of pro-OmniCorp talk show host Pat Novak, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and fiercely demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while being repaired and tricks Clara into thinking that Murphy died. Norton reaches him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes a lockdown.\nMurphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the ED-209 drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorp's forces. Mattox subdues Murphy, preparing to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphy's programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars. However, he overcomes his programming long enough to kill Sellars when Sellars overconfidently taunts him.\nOmniCorp's parent company, OCP, shuts down the project. The President vetoes the repeal of the Dreyfus Act based on Norton's testimony, much to Novak's anger.

When the children still refuse to answer, Sean is also given a black implant before being subjected to a deep scan. In the midst of it, Sean insults Smythe, causing him to accidentally interrupt the deep scan, allowing Sean to escape the deep scanner alive.

In exchange, the boys meet Swanny, who has had his implant removed by a watchmaker, and also tells the children to go to a Stone Circle. However, an announcement reveals that Sean's mother, Kate, has been taken a prisoner in the area headquarters, a castle. With Monique's help, the children successfully get to the castle. However, they are caught by a large robot. Sean then discovers that he can take control of the robots because of his black implant, after discovering that the large robot responds to his movement.\nMeanwhile, Smythe is speaking with Kate about how he and she could live together before an alarm goes off. Smythe leaves to go see what has happened. A few moments later, a young guard is tricked into giving the keys to the door to Kate. Meanwhile, outside, Sean appears to have been caught by the large robot, with Smythe scolding him. Sean then turns the large robot's weapon on Smythe and his team, forcing them to drop their weapons, which are picked up by the other children. Kate suddenly dashes by on a horse, causing Smythe and his team to follow. This opens the line of fire for two clankers, insectoid robots with a top-mounted weapon, which destroy the large robot, forcing Sean to hide behind it. One of the clankers then jumps down and prepares to fire at Sean, before Sean takes control of the robot and uses it to destroy the other, before commanding the clanker to deactivate.

As Eric follows the dwarf to his trailer, the dwarf throws a rock at his chained, defenseless dog. Inside the trailer, the dwarf offers Eric a gun for $300.

When Sirisha asks Krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of Krishna where his father, a don fondly called as Anna (Mohan Babu) and as Annagaru with respect, punishing a teacher named Sankar Rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father Rama Rao. Anna is a sexagenarian man who always thinks about the welfare of the people of Rayalaseema, and they too revere him equal to god. Anna is a very powerful and influential don who also controls the political affairs of that region. His friend Ananda Rao (Paruchuri Gopala Krishna), a ruling party politician, is his close friend, and he and the party extends their full support to Anna to stop the Nandavaram project whose happening would destroy 34 villages completely. On the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man tries to make the project to earn crores. The group consists of KR, Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam (Tanikella Bharani), Chandi (Jeeva), and Seshagiri.\nKrishna visits his home when Anna kills his opponent Guruva Reddy (Banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. Then the family of Anna is introduced. Anna lives with his wife Lakshmi (Jayasudha), elder son Bhushan (Kishore), and Krishna. Bhushan is married and has a son, but he never loved them and hates them to the core. Unlike Anna and his dutiful and devoted brother Krishna, Bhushan is a spoiled brat, often terrorizing people in the name of Anna, creating fear in their hearts. When a young woman's brother warns Bhushan, Bhushan comes to their home, kidnaps the woman, and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farmhouse. Bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with KR's group for the formation of the Nandavaram project. Meanwhile, Krishna and Sirisha are deeply in love, and Anna's trusted henchmen Ramudu finds out that she is Gavarraju's daughter. Gavarraju was Anna's enemy who was killed by Anna at Tirupathi during an assassination attempt. Though Sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family, and Anna too respects Krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance.\nMeanwhile, Sirisha informs Krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in Anna's farmhouse by Bhushan, who trashed her brother recently. She also adds that none dared to convey the same to Anna because of Bhushan. Krishna tells the whole matter to Anna, and when he finds the woman assaulted there, he apologizes to her and tells Ramudu to drop her in her home. He also house arrests Bhushan there forever to ensure the safety of the innocent people. But on the request of Lakshmi, he lets him enter his house again. Later, Ramudu invites Anna and Lakshmi for attending his daughter's wedding, and they accept it happily. However, Sirisha's brother reveals to Krishna that Anna is going to be fatally attacked in the way. At the time of execution, firing starts on Anna's vehicles, and in this confusion, Bhushan kills his wife and son, but none knows that. Anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals, who are killed by Krishna. Anna is sent to the nearby hospital. Inspector Gogin Rao (Ravi Babu) asks Anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened of seeing them carrying weapons. This results in a brawl between Krishna and Gogin Rao, and the former is arrested for attacking a police officer on duty.\nHowever, it is later revealed that Gogin Rao is not as sincere as he appears and works for KR. Sirisha goes to the police station and tells Krishna that Anna is going to be attacked again by the rivals' men. Krishna goes there and saves Anna from the goons. Later, as both the plans are failed, Bhushan goes to the hospital carrying oranges to the hospital and leaves soon. He keeps explosives inside them so that Anna dies because of a blast as suggested by KR and Vedam. Unfortunately, Lakshmi cuts them, and the blast occurs. Anna, who was in the way to the room conducting medical tests, collapses and understands what happened then. After Lakshmi's funeral is conducted, Krishna meets Anna and tells that KR, Gogin Rao, Chandi, Vedam, Seshagiri, and Bhushan are the culprits and adds that he would kill all of them. First, he kills Gogin Rao by strangling him with a thin wire. Next, he kills Seshagiri by feeding him a poisoned (possibly cyanide-infused) cake. Then, he kills Chandi by locking him in a car filled with gas, leading to suffocation. Vedam is murdered brutally and is hanged from a tree to resemble a suicide.

He stops recording, annoyed at the interruption. Meanwhile, his father Sam Manning (Billy Crudup) has succeeded in landing a large account at his advertising firm, and calls Josh to celebrate with him and skip that day's classes. Josh tells him he cannot make it but his father insists, though Josh begins to make his way to the campus library anyway. Sam continues to wait at the bar where he told him to meet him and even leaves a message for Josh who has apparently stood him up. He is distracted by a news report of a school shooting incident at his son's campus library on the television in the bar.\nLater, a memorial wake is being held at Josh's home by his mother, Emily (Felicity Huffman). It is inferred that Josh was one of the victims in the shooting. Due to the media coverage received, Sam has a difficult time being able to grieve in his own way with press being cordoned at the end of the street by police, and a news helicopter hovering above the family home. Sam is consoled by family and attendees while sitting alone to one side as his wife is greeting others. Sam walks into Josh's bedroom to look around, attempting to find some kind of understanding over the loss, and is interrupted by Kate Lucas (Selena Gomez), who tells Sam that she and Josh had been dating the year prior. Sam then makes his way to his own home and finds the media coverage is interfering with his daily life, and he eventually succumbs to alcoholism, as far as showing up intoxicated at his firm; acting erratically and kissing his receptionist in a drunken state, for which his employer is advising him to take time off to better cope with the situation.\nTwo years later, Sam has removed himself from his former life and is now living on a sailboat on a lake, far from home, having taken a job as a contractor's assistant and for the most part drinking away his free time. His habits are causing habitual lateness and annoying his employer, who cautions Sam about repeated lateness. Getting up to relieve himself from the side of the boat has caught the chagrin of the governing board of the lake and the \"wrath\" of Alaird Dupree (because it is openly visible to other tenants and the small seafood restaurant nearby), the agent acting on behalf of the board. It is clear he dislikes Sam, and the feeling is very much mutual. Going for a drink with some coworkers after his day of working, he hides the details of his previous life and his true identity from everyone, even making up humorous stories about his past. (He tells his coworkers that he \"fingered\" Gotti and is in the protection of the Federal Witness Protection Program), Sam notices that \"The Trill\" tavern hosts open mic events for musicians.\nReturning to the marina, he encounters his ex wife waiting for him, who says she is moving to Tulsa and is now the mother of a new son. She requires his signature to place their former house up for sale. She has also brought the remainder of Josh's possessions\u2014demo discs, instruments and gear\u2014which Sam emphatically states he has no room for on his tiny sailboat. Emily tells him she was certain he would want it because they had played music together since Josh was younger. Hours pass after Emily leaves. He tries his best to ignore the collection of his son's possessions over a meal. He storms over to where Emily had left it beside the road and begins to place it in a dumpster but stops, noticing the notebooks and discs, and begins to listen to them back on the boat, and read through the collection of lyrics and writings Josh left behind. He even begins to teach himself some of his son's material. After work the next day, Sam decides to perform \"Home\", one of Josh's songs, at The Trill, and catches the attention of Quentin (Anton Yelchin), a young guitarist who was excitedly moved by the performance.  The next day, Quentin brings Sam coffee and food and discusses the previous night performance, stating he believes there are other songs, and if there are, they could perform them together. Sam declares he is not interested, and continues to listen to more and teach himself his son's material.\nQuentin tries again the next day and shows him an alternate arrangement possibility for the song. The two end up sharing a meal and playing instruments together for the rest of the night. Sam neglects to tell Quentin that he was not the piece's actual author. At the end of the night, Quentin gets Sam to agree to perform together at The Trill, adding more and more to each arrangement, including a percussion section in the way of Aiken. The next day, Sam is introduced to Del (Laurence Fishburne), the owner and operator of the local music supply store, who reveals that he is selling his business and plans to retire and tour by motor home with his wife in his later years. Quentin shows Sam the 1978 Gibson Les Paul hanging in the store, but is unable to afford it (a source of good-natured joking between Quentin and Del). Upon leaving the store, Sam watches a staged meeting between Quentin and Willy, a bass guitarist, in hopes that they can include him in their performances, but Sam is resistant to starting a band. The next day, the quartet meet to practice in the garage beneath Quentin\u2019s apartment, and Quentin is very evasive about his own past. The group, now complete, has impressed The Trill owner (played by director William H. Macy) who asks them to perform regularly on Saturday nights as house entertainment, to which the band agrees\u2014even Sam, reluctantly. The new name, \u201cRudderless\u201d, quickly gains notoriety and local fame. Meanwhile, Quentin is revealed as extremely shy of the opposite sex, which Sam attempts to help him through, though Quentin finds the advice generally unhelpful.\nSam arrives at Quentin's apartment one afternoon and meets his mother, Joyce, who Sam mistakes as an older prostitute after seeing Quentin hand her a small amount of cash as they hug. Quentin is embarrassed because his mother has had issues with (unspecified) responsibilities, even spending his junior year of high school living in a car, and has vowed never to lower himself to that level of poverty again. At the mall, Sam buys Quentin new clothing to give him a style, and develop confidence from it. It does help a little, and Quentin begins to enjoy the attention Rudderless has gained him.\nFollowing the show, as the band members are to go to a party, Sam sees Kate\u2014now calling herself by her middle name, Ann, who shames him for playing the songs in public. The next day, Sam visits Josh's grave and finds it vandalized as Josh Manning is revealed to have been the killer in the school shooting incident where he died. Emily arrives with cleaning supplies, and implies that it is a fairly regular occurrence, and the two parents begin to clean off the graffiti from the headstone. Afterward, the two share some tequila, and it is revealed that today is Josh's birthday. Emily tells Sam that a couple of the other parents have reached out to her to forgive them for Josh's actions, but Sam still appears to be in denial.  Emily insists that they had acted properly in their parental roles and they have nothing to feel guilty for and that Josh had to have been mentally ill to carry out such an act of violence.\nContinuing to drink into the Saturday he is scheduled to work, Sam goes to his job and, finding a yard hammock, falls asleep. His employer finds and fires him. Sam assures him that he had already quit and walks away. Later that day, the other members of the band arrive with girls, and spend the afternoon on Sam's boat. As Sam goes below, the other members plead with him about a local block party they have been invited to play, and it is entirely possible it could lead to bigger and better opportunities for Rudderless in the way of airplay and exposure. But Sam is reluctant, now knowing that Josh's songs would never be accepted when people find out the truth of their authorship.\nSam visits Del the next day to acquire a new amplifier tube, and finds Del and wife Tina having gotten the RV stuck. Sam manages to get it out onto the street. Del asks him why he will not play the show, and Sam begins to question why he is really doing all of this. He arrives at Quentin's garage and insists that the song Quentin wrote will be the final song, finally pushing him out of his comfort zone.\nFeeling good about the outcome, Sam makes his way toward the street stage and is surprised to find Kate/Ann talking to the other three members on the stage, presumably telling them the actual origin of the songs they all assumed Sam wrote.\nShe confronts him and tells him that the incident and her association with it had so interfered with her life that she had to change her name and leave school.  She had been pursued and harassed by people and media alike, asking humiliating questions, even suggesting they had been members of a cult. Quentin asks Sam if it was true, and Sam acknowledges the truth for the first time. Quentin outright refuses to play the material and strikes Sam as he is walking away despite the other two trying to persuade him to play the material one time only, and then move on. Sam again goes into a drinking binge and returns home to the marina to find the Board had the area sealed with a chain link fence. Sam attempts to climb it and falls over to the opposite side, breaking the guitar neck of his guitar strapped to his back, ruining it.\nThe next morning, the scheduled sailing regatta Alaird warned him about is loudly underway. The sailboat procession is disrupted by Sam playing the 1812 Overture on his electric, sailing directly into the course of the other boats, and casting some over the sides of their own craft, for which Sam is arrested. He calls Del to bail him out and is surprised when Del tells him he knew who he was the entire time, but did not know the songs were written by Josh. The next day, Sam visits the site of the shooting, and finds the erected memorial identifying the shooting victims by name. Sam breaks down in tears of grief over the guilt of Josh's actions, but finally accepts that he has lost his own son despite what he has done. Sam then visits Emily, bringing her Josh's discs, and says that one day, the new baby will want to know who his half brother was beyond what history will paint him to be.\nSam then visits Del's store and discovers Quentin has discarded his instruments, telling Del to sell them on consignment. Sam then asks if the offer on the store was a \"good offer\", implying that Sam would be interested in buying Del's store. He then goes to visit Quentin at the donut shop where he works, and implores him to continue playing and writing even if it is without Sam. Sam tells him that he found performing Josh's material addictive, offering catharsis to his life and the bond with Josh. He concludes the visit, having brought back Quentin's guitar cases. One contains the Les Paul that Quentin so long idolized and wanted.\nFinally, Sam performs the songs he had been working on, first admitting and telling the audience who Josh was, what he had done, and that he had written the song he was about to play. Closure for Rudderless lets us see Sam has been replaced by a new guitarist. Del has been given Sam's sailboat (presumably in payment), and Emily finally decides to listen to Josh's music.\nSam completes the song, including (presumably) improvised lyrics about missing his son in the song's climax and leaves the stage.", "tmdb_id": 244403}, "37944728": {"title": "Rummy (2014 film)", "plot": "Sakthi joins a college in Sivagangai, where he meets his classmates Joseph and Meenakshi.

Though he declines the request at first, he relents when the official is murdered by Seta S\u014djir\u014d, Shishio's underling. Just after Kenshin's departure, an individual arrives at Tokyo and searches for him, beating Sanosuke along the way.\nWhile on the way, Kenshin meets with Makimachi Misao, who attempts to steal his sakabato. While the two converse, they are alerted by a boy to the plight of his parents and brother, all of whom are killed by Shishio's men for trying to report their atrocities to their village to the authorities. Kenshin beats Shishio's men, though his identity as Hitokiri Batt\u014dsai is revealed. Kenshin is taken to Shishio himself, the latter ordering S\u014djiro to duel Kenshin, which ends with S\u014djiro breaking Kenshin's sakabato. As he leaves the scene, Kenshin urges the villagers, including the orphaned boy, not to take their revenge against Shishio's men.\nArriving at Kyoto, Kenshin is asked by Misao, who is impressed by his words, to take shelter at an inn run by Kashiwazaki Nenji, actually a semi-retired ninja called Okina once employed by the Tokugawa shogunate known as the Oniwabanshu who were previously employed by the Tokugawa shogunate; Misao herself is also an aspiring ninja. Okina warns Kenshin that a lieutenant of his, Shinomori Aoshi (the one who beat Sanosuke previously), has made it his life goal to kill the strongest man in Japan - Kenshin.\nMeanwhile, Kaoru decides to follow Kenshin to Kyoto, accompanied by Yahiko and Sanosuke. At the same time, Kenshin discovers to his dismay that the person who made his sakabato, Arai Shakku has died years before. His son, Seiku, initially refuses Kenshin's plea for another sakabato, but when Shishio's elite warrior, Sawagej\u014d Ch\u014d, kidnaps his baby, Seiku asks Kenshin to defeat him. Seiku gives him a twin of the previous sakabato, which Kenshin uses to defeat Ch\u014d. By interrogating Ch\u014d, the government learns that Shishio plans to raze Kyoto to the ground that night.

Himura Kenshin wakes up at Master Hiko's home, and asks if his friend (Kaoru) was also washed up. He has been unconscious for three days, and Master Hiko tells him that his friend is most likely dead. Kenshin asks to learn the final Hiten Mitsurugi technique, \"Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki\", in order to defeat Shishio Makoto and prevent his onslaught. Hiko agrees, and the two engage in a duel to start his training.\nShishio appears off the Tokyo coast in a large black iron-clad battleship, and demands that the home minister, Ito Hirobumi, visit him to discuss the situation. After inviting the ministers to join him for food, one of them loses his temper, and is killed by one of Shishio's men. The prime minister tries to restore order and decorum, but Shishio takes them prisoner when they try to leave - killing all the government men apart from the prime minister. Shishio demands that Battousai be brought to him, otherwise he will bring down the government by making public all the killings and murders that were undertaken by the current government. Saito Hajime also known as Fujita is still searching for Battousai, and is disgusted with the way the government is handling the matter by giving in to blackmail from Shishio.\nYahiko Myojin finds a poster demanding \"Battousai\" Kenshin be arrested, which he and Sagara realise suggests that Kenshin must still be alive, and they leave for Tokyo and the Kamiya Dojo with Misao to find him and search for Kaoru Kamiya. A young woman approaches them with a scarf as they are leaving, which Misao recognises as the one she bandaged Kaoru with and they rush off. They appear outside a hospital and enter to find Kaoru unconscious and alive.\nKenshin learns through his training from Hiko that he had thrown away his will to live during his time as the assassin Batt\u014dsai, and as he has no intention of coming out alive he will be unable to defeat Shishio. Hiko also points out that Kenshin has lost his killer instinct with his oath to not kill and his ridiculous\" sword, after all it is the strong who survive and the weak who die. That night, Hiko says that something is missing in Kenshin, and that he will be given the night to think about it. If he cannot figure out what it is, he will die the next day. The next morning, Kenshin is still unable to understand what is missing in himself. So Hiko reveals his final task as Master to Kenshin - without realising what is missing, Kenshin will return to his old ways - and so Hiko has to kill Batt\u014dsai. When Hiko attacks him, Kenshin realises that he is trembling. It is not from fear of his master but from fear of death itself and instinctively uses his sword to protect himself as he does not want to die. Kenshin listens as he is told by his master that he cannot learn the secret until he realises that the will to live is paramount, that his life is just as worthy as others and so he has learned the secret of Amakakeru.\nKaoru awakes from her coma, and reunited with Yahiko and Sanosuke they return to Tokyo.  As Kenshin concludes his training and is about to depart, Makimachi Misao arrives with the news that Kaoru is alive. She also tells Kenshin that he has been branded a wanted criminal throughout Japan for his work as Batt\u014dsai during the Bakumatsu era. Knowing that Shishio intends to take Tokyo next, Kenshin intends to return home by a secret route given to him by the Oniwabanshu at the Aoiya Inn. They discover that  Kashiwazaki Nenji (also known as Okina) has gone on ahead and encountered Shinomori Aoshi, who was lying in wait for Kenshin on that route. Kenshin and Misao arrive and Kenshin duels with Aoshi, during which Okina dies of his wounds. Back at the Aoiya, Misao tends to Aoshi and convinces him to return to the Oniwabanshu. On Shishio's battleship, Shishio, his partner Yumi, and one of his men Hori, discover that because of Shishio's inability to sweat, he can only fight for fifteen minutes without putting his health at risk.\nKenshin arrives back at the Kamiya Kashin dojo.  Takani Megumi, who has been looking after the dojo in Kaoru's absence, welcomes him back, but shortly after his arrival police arrive to apprehend him. Wishing to prevent further violence, he surrenders, and is taken to the Home Ministry head, Ito Hirobumi. Ito explains that he had tried to talk Shishio into abandoning his plan to overthrow the Meiji government, but the negotiations had ended in disaster and Shishio, still bitter about his cruel treatment by the new government (being burned alive), would only leave the government be for the time being if Kenshin were arrested and executed. Otherwise, he intends to attack Tokyo. Kenshin convinces Ito that he can defeat Shishio if Ito helps him. Ito seemingly decides to go through with the execution anyway. Kaoru, Sano and Yahiko return to Tokyo soon after and, to their horror, discover that Kenshin is to be executed the same day. Shishio's men attend the execution to ensure that Ito carries through with the negotiations.\nThe execution, however, is merely staged, and Kenshin is freed and assisted in defeating the men by Hajime Saito. Sano joins them, and the three are rowed to Shishio's battleship. While searching for Shishio, Kenshin meets Seta Soujiro again and the two rematch. Kenshin comes out victorious, and Soujiro, who originally believed Kenshin to be weak, is crushed and confused. Kenshin finally finds Shishio, Yumi and Hori waiting in the ship's hold. A duel ensues between Kenshin and Shishio, who easily overpowers Kenshin. Saito arrives immediately after, followed by Sano and Aoshi, who followed them from Kyoto, but even the four together are no match for Shishio. Shishio hits his limit of 15 minutes and Yumi attempts to shield him from Kenshin while Shishio stabs both of them, killing her. Meanwhile, Ito's men begin firing at the ship, intending to sink it and drown both Shishio and Kenshin inside. Shishio condemns Kenshin for helping such a government. Kenshin agrees that the new Meiji government is faulty, but argues that the age of assassins like himself and Shishio is over and that there should be no more violence. He manages to defeat Shishio using Amakakeru, though not physically harming him. Shishio, who has long hit his limit and whose body has become overheated, catches fire and burns to death before the group's eyes.\nSaito, Aoshi, Sano and Kenshin escape from the ship before it sinks and are brought back to shore, where Kaoru, Yahiko, Misao and the Home Ministry are waiting. Ito acknowledges Kenshin as Himura Kenshin for the first time while declaring Batt\u014dsai dead, and his men salute the group as heroes.

There, he notices that his brother-in-law, Christian, is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why Christian tells Cameron that he feels the holiday became too commercialized and consumerist, and that he feels uncomfortable with what he believes are Pagan elements of contemporary Christmas celebration. Cameron tells Christian that he is wrong and recites the story of the Nativity, which is depicted in cartoon form. Meanwhile, two guests at the party discuss conspiracy theories.\nChristian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Cameron tells him that Christmas trees were God's idea since God created trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross; breaking the fourth wall, Cameron encourages the audience to visualize a cross every time they see a Christmas tree. Cameron further addresses several other concerns Christian has about the historicity of the holiday, including its date and the role of the Three Wise Men. Cameron ties the Nativity directly to the crucifixion, saying that baby Jesus' swaddling cloth was a foreshadowing of his burial shroud, and claims that the gifts of frankincense and myrrh were used to treat dead bodies in a form of primitive embalming. Cameron encourages Christian and the audience to place nutcracker dolls around Nativity sets to represent Herod's soldiers during the Massacre of the Innocents.\nChristian is convinced by the arguments, but then complains that Santa has replaced Jesus as the figurehead of the holiday; he further expresses discomfort over the fact that \"Santa\" is an anagram of \"Satan\". Cameron tells Christian the story of Saint Nicholas, including a reenactment of the First Council of Nicaea in which Nicholas had supposedly violently assaulted Arius for heresy. Cameron claims that, after the council, Nicholas went out and began beating other heretics for teaching false doctrine, and that \"Nicholas was 'bad', in a good way\". Cameron explains that St. Nicholas was the basis for Santa Claus, who was a byproduct of Nicholas' story being diluted by secular culture. With this knowledge, Christian joyously declares that \"Santa is the man\".\nReassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Cameron criticizes people who feel that the holiday is too commercial, saying that because God took on material form, it is appropriate to celebrate using material things through the giving of expensive gifts. Cameron explains that presents represent Jerusalem, and that Christmas is \"doing what God does\", as God has given humanity many gifts. Cameron then issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, \"for our children\".

The next morning, the gang is briefed by WWE executive Ms. Richards that the city has been terrorized by bear attacks over the past few weeks. Mr. McMahon asks the gang to solve the Ghost Bear mystery to ensure the security of the WWE belt. Cena and Sin Cara explain to the gang that the legend of the Ghost Bear started over 100 years ago with a wrestling bear named Vicious, who was defeated by Sin Cara's great-great-great grandfather Sin Cara Grande at the grounds that would be WWE City. Furious over its loss, Vicious vented its frustration on the town until Sin Cara Grande warded it off to a cave at the cost of a career-ending leg injury. It is believed by Sin Cara that the spirit of the bear has been stirred by WrestleMania.\nNext morning, the gang is notified by Ms. Richards that the WWE belt has been stolen, and Scooby is arrested after being caught with it around his waist, with security footage showing him caught in the act.

However, she still phones Abi and he invites her to his apartment. After lying about her mother being sick, Teena leaves work early and rushes over to the apartment building to meet Abi.\nThe second person is Feroz, who in present-day is in critical condition at the hospital. He is a hot-tempered young photographer who was raised by his grandparents after his parents' death. They are desperate to get him married but he is preoccupied with saving up money to buy a new studio in the middle of the city.

He is an unsuccessful insurance agent with low self-esteem who lives with his wife, Parvathy and their daughter. He is no longer in talking terms with his Iyer parents because he married a girl without their consent. Unknown to his family, he is going through depression and meets a psychologist to overcome his mental issues. Before returning home from work everyday, he goes to the local cinema to clear his mind. Since he has never achieved his annual target, he goes around asking everyone he meets if they would like to buy his insurance policy, which makes him unpopular in his neighbourhood. After much difficulty, Veeramani manages to convince Mahadevan to become his latest client. He then goes to the same apartment building to meet Mahadevan on the same day to finalize the insurance agreement.\nThe final person is Thampi, who is the one who ends up dead in the lift. He is both a drug dealer and a drug user. He lives in the slums with his two wives and a young daughter. A few hours before his murder, he gets into a fight with the new police officer in the area and is jailed. Once he is released, he returns to the slums and gets high on drugs.

While being questioned, Mahadevan admits that he knows both Feroz and Veeramani and that they were both scheduled to meet him that day. However, he hides the fact that he and Feroz tried to cover up the truth behind Sneha's death. Bimal also learns that Thampi wrote down the number of an empty apartment in the visitors book, which means he was probably up to something suspicious. Also, the coroner's report indicate that he was on drugs before he was killed. Even more strange, he was from the slums where the crime rate is high. Bimal concludes that Thampi was probably high and became paranoid when the lift stopped working. He saw the two young men with him as dangerous and tried to kill them. Teena then attacked him in self-defense,  unwittingly killing him. All the charges on her are dropped and she is released from police custody.

Shivan Kutty, who tampered with the lift on that day, is his partner in crime while Jeevan is their handler.

His ambition is to become a Bank manager, and he manages to get an interview for the same in a bank. While on a pilgrimage, Murali meets Ambujam, a young doctor who is travelling with her chaperone, who is her grandmother Aishwarya. Ambujam initially thinks ill of Murali due to unsavoury incidents which occur between them during the journey, but after she finds out about Murali's true character as he helps her Aishwarya recover from dehydration, she falls in love with him. She expresses a distaste for marrying policemen, which impresses Murali. Meanwhile, a spate of robberies occurs in Chennai where several bank accounts through ATM machines are stolen.

He reluctantly attends the training for Chellapa's sake and deliberately performs poorly during the training in the hope of getting expelled from the academy. Unfortunately, SP Nagaraj, who happens to be Ambujam's father and a former colleague of Chellapa, finds out about Murali's plan and makes a deal with him to avoid the matter reaching Chellapa's ears; If Murali performs badly during training, he will not be expelled from the academy. Instead, he will be made as an SI with the assurance that he can resign if he does not like the job after 30 days, after which he can marry Ambujam. Murali accepts, but this strains his relationship with Ambujam. Shiva and Lawrence plan to steal money from ATMs using information from international credit cards. The robbery is a success, but the CCTV cameras in two different ATMs have exposed Shiva as one of the robbers due to his height.

Emily and the two girls come up with a plan to get the fragile Lavinia to make a confession about the Sisterhood.\nThe same night, Mary finds herself alone while trying to avoid being caught for skipping curfew. She goes to see her boyfriend, Jeff, but he refuses to talk to her. She goes to Gambhir's house to confide in him, unaware they are being observed by Sue Parris (Jessica Hecht), Emily's mother. She snaps a picture of them and, assuming they're in a sexual relationship, sends the photo out. Mary spends the night on his couch before being awoken by her mother the following morning, who saw the photo. Gambhir is fired from his teaching job, even after he and Mary insist nothing inappropriate happened.\nFeeling that things are spinning out of control, Catherine and Lavinia try to convince Mary to tell everyone the truth of the Sisterhood, but Mary promises that she'll fix it. At a small press conference, Mary tries to talk to parents and reporters to dispel the situation. Despite her efforts, Mary is unable to settle the scandal as Gambhir defends the girls.\nMary fashions the now-infamous Sisterhood paper square and gives it to Gambhir, inviting him to see their ritual. After getting Rose to come with him, they watch as the girls stand in a circle around a fire, share their personal thoughts out loud before burning pieces of paper with their written secrets. Through a montage of Sisterhood meetings, Catherine and Mary reveal their biggest secrets; Catherine misses her mother (who is implied to have cancer and getting treatment) and wishes she would die or get better, Mary wants to lose her virginity to someone she loves and Lavinia fears never being kissed.\nEmily, invited to speak on a radio show about sexual abuse, begins to feel guilt and decides to pull out of her plan to ambush Lavinia with her two friends. The two girls are dismayed, deciding to go ahead with the plan without her. Emily tries to warn Lavinia, but it's too late. Lavinia has been lured into the woods by Travis, a boy she has a crush on. In the woods, Travis convinces her to take her shirt off, and she is ambushed by Emily's friends. While filming her, they hold her down while putting a witch hat on her, force her to say the Sisterhood girls are witches, and make her touch herself. They upload the video to the Internet, drug Lavinia, and take her to a Halloween party. At the party, they spread the video around while calling Lavinia cruel names. A now emotionally broken Lavinia commits suicide by overdosing on her mother's pills.\nDuring Lavinia's funeral, Mary, knowing Lavinia's last wish was to be kissed, asks Jeff to do so out of respect. A distraught Emily confesses that she made the whole thing up. She admits how she wanted to be in the Sisterhood so badly, she was outraged when Mary rejected her and lied about their activities as revenge. She then begs for forgiveness. Emily, whose blog is revealed to be a hoax, is persecuted by those who hate her for the damage she caused. However, others focus on how she still helped sexual abuse victims despite the false pretense that made her blog popular.\nCatherine shaves off her hair and finally visits her sick mother while Mary and Jeff reconcile their differences. She and Catherine decide to do a dance they had prepared for school, choreographed to Lavinia's original music, and proceed to dance through town in Lavinia's memory as local residents watch them. Emily stands nearby and Mary approaches her, giving her the Sisterhood paper square and inviting her to join their dance. Emily happily accepts and the Sisterhood girls dance down the streets of Kingston and into the woods.\nThe movie ends with a narrative about how the Sisterhood will continue to be a secret to outsiders and the secret will be passed down to new members and soon disappear into the darkness.", "tmdb_id": 206197}, "43516173": {"title": "Sivas (film)", "plot": "The film follows an eleven-year-old boy named Aslan (Dogan Izci) and his relationship to a fighting dog, Sivas.

Lakshmi's mother rejects the proposal, but her father reveals that he has already agreed and accepted money from Bimla, out of desperation.\nLakshmi and Bimla pass the border without incident and arrive at their destination, a building known as 'Happiness House', which is a brothel run by a woman named Mumtaz. Unaware that she has been sold into sexual slavery, Lakshmi mingles with the other girls at the brothel, including Shahanna and Anita, who she befriends; and the temperamental Monica. Later that night, she is dressed and prepared for Varun, an important and high-paying customer who has a preference for virgins. Resisting his advances, Lakshmi bites Varun and uses the ensuing chaos to escape the building. On the street, she blindly runs for help but is caught and beaten by Mumtaz's workers, who subsequently lock her in an isolated room. While looking out of the window, Lakshmi is spotted by Sophia, an American photographer who has arrived in India to work with an anti-trafficking organisation, Hope House. Sophia takes pictures of Lakshmi, but she is noticed by a brothel worker, Suren, who breaks her camera. After recovering the photos, Sophia becomes determined to save 'the girl in the window', and requests help from Hope House manager Mrs. Tripathi, and her investigators Vikram and Sam.\nAfter multiple failed attempts to ensure her cooperation, Mumtaz drugs Lakshmi's mango juice and prepares her once again for Varun, who rapes her. The next day, she is drugged again and forced to service multiple men. Sophia asks Vikram to raid Happiness House, but he is reluctant to do so without proper planning. No longer new, Lakshmi is given a bed in the communal living space and made to work as the other women do. She befriends Harish, a young boy living at the brothel with his infant sister Gina and mother Pushpa, who is a sickly prostitute. After witnessing workers bury a body in a shallow grave, Lakshmi contemplates suicide but is stopped by Shahanna. Days pass and soon Lakshmi becomes resigned to her fate. She calculates the number of days needed for her to pay off her debt to Mumtaz, but is discouraged by Shahanna, who warns her that there will be consequences if her notes are found. Anita tries to escape, and is punished by Mumtaz, who shoves chilli peppers into her vagina in front of the others. Lakshmi saves Shahanna after she is attacked by an irate customer, and Bimla informs her that the bodies of those who die on the premises are buried in the garden. Monica, who has managed to pay back her debt to Mumtaz after five years, leaves the brothel and returns to her village, where she expects to be welcomed as a heroine since she has been financially providing for her family. Vikram and Sam arrive at Happiness House, posing as customers. Sam gives Lakshmi a card containing the details of Hope House and informs her that a raid will be held soon. The exchange is overheard by Anita. Lakshmi confides in Shahanna, who is dismissive and claims that American men are sent to kidnap girls and harvest their organs. A bruised and battered Monica returns to Happiness House, having been beaten by her father and thrown out of her village. A week later, the women are taken to see a doctor, who examines them and discovers that Monica has Kaposi's sarcoma, a symptom of HIV/AIDS. She is forced to leave the brothel.\nWhile delivering soft drinks to customers, Harish sees Lakshmi in the garden and offers her a bottle. They hide from Suren, who comes looking for Harish and the missing crate of drinks. Anita witnesses the scene and causes a power outage, which stops the pair being found and punished. Mumtaz confronts the women about the power cut, and finds the Hope House card. Anita falsely claims it is hers and is struck by Mumtaz, but she is able to return the card to Lakshmi and tells her that she lied to buy time for the upcoming raid. The raid begins but the police and Sam find nothing since the younger girls are hidden away by Bimla. Sophia apologizes to Vikram for pushing him to conduct a premature search. Anita is sold by Mumtaz to the Middle East, where she will be a sex slave and never be able to return. Pushpa becomes increasingly sick and is forced to leave with Harish and Gina, since she can no longer work. Lakshmi begins to plan her escape, and manages to slip out of a window while the others are watching a religious festival on TV. She is chased by one of the brothel workers but manages to escape in the thick crowds of worshipers. After initially getting lost, Lakshmi finally makes her way to Hope House and is reunited with Harish. Using her information, the police conduct a surprise raid on Happiness House, and find the hidden girls and buried bodies. Bimla, Suren and others are arrested, but Mumtaz gets away.

After the incident, Talia takes Damian to Gotham City to meet his father and remain in his care while she and the League deal with Slade. The aggressive, highly independent Damian objects and frequently disobeys his father's orders in an attempt to seek out Slade and avenge Ra's himself. After he is accosted by Nightwing for sneaking out and brutally attacking an associate of Slade's, Batman berates Damian for his recklessness and willingness to kill. Batman then has Damian don the mantle of Robin in order to teach him discipline.\nSlade, now calling himself Deathstroke, captures Talia as well as Dr. Kirk Langstrom, a scientist previously working with Ra's.

In Bethlehem, Jesus is born to a virgin named Mary and her husband Joseph. Three wise men visit Jesus declare him the future King.\nThirty years later, an adult Jesus Christ (Diogo Morgado) travels to Galilee and begins recruiting followers, James, his brother John, Peter, a fisherman, Matthew, a tax collector and Mary Magdalene. Soon these men and women eventually become his disciples.\nThrough his teachings and numerous miracles, Jesus builds a huge following, who begin to call him the Messiah. He also draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders. The Pharisees claim Jesus is blaspheming God by forgiving sins, something only God can do. Jesus responds by saying he is the son of God.\nJesus tells the disciples they are to travel to Jerusalem for the upcoming Passover holiday. He enters the city on the back of a donkey and is met by a huge crowd of supporters, who lay palm leaves in his path. Caiaphas, the head of the Pharisees, is afraid that Jesus' presence in the city will further agitate his people, who are already in a near state of revolt against the oppressive Romans, led by Pontius Pilate. It is revealed that, earlier, Pilate had warned Caiaphas that if there were any trouble from the Jews, he would close the temple, thus cancelling Passover.\nUpon entering the temple, Jesus sees a group of money changers and proceeds to upend their tables. This act draws cheers from the people and scorn from the Pharisees. Later, Jesus tells a little girl that every stone of the temple will soon fall. The Pharisees take this as a plan to destroy the temple and decide Jesus must be stopped. Judas, one of Jesus' disciples, approaches the Pharisees. He believes Jesus is going too far and wants to help. The Pharisees give him 30 pieces of silver for his assistance.\nThe night before Passover, Jesus tells the disciples this will be their Last Supper together and says that one of them will betray him. Later, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas kisses Jesus' cheek, thereby identifying Jesus to the Pharisees and revealing Judas' betrayal. Jesus is arrested while the disciples flee the garden to save themselves.\nOut of fear of the temple's closure due to an open trial during Passover, Caiaphas orders an immediate trial during the late hours of night in privacy, which are violations of Jewish law, against the order of other priests. Caiaphas asks Jesus if he is the son of God, and he answers \"I am\". This is all the Pharisees need to hear, and they immediately find Jesus guilty of blasphemy.\nThat morning, to a growing crowd, Caiaphas announces Jesus' guilt and reveals the penalty for blasphemy is death. Judas, horrified by what he has done, throws the silver at the Pharisees and runs off; he later hangs himself. Caiaphas believes if the Pharisees killed Jesus on Passover, it would start a riot, so he turns him over to the Romans for the punishment.\nPilate tells Caiaphas that Jesus didn't break any Roman laws, but orders him to be lashed 40 times. Since it's Passover, Pilate says he will follow tradition and free a prisoner of the people's choosing, and if they choose Jesus, he will be set free. By this time, Mary (Roma Downey) has arrived in Jerusalem to see what is happening to her son.\nPilate orders the crowd to enter his courtyard to choose whether to release Jesus or Barabbas, a convicted murderer. Since none of Jesus' followers are allowed into the courtyard, Caiaphas easily sways the vote so that Barabbas is set free. Pilate then asks what he should do with Jesus, and again Caiaphas sways the crowd to have him executed by way of crucifixion.\nFearing a riot among the hostile people, Pilate orders the crucifixion, then literally washes his hands of the situation. A battered and bloodied Jesus then carries a cross to Golgotha and is nailed to it by the mocking Roman guards, who earlier had placed a crown of thorns on his head. Before the cross is put into place, Pilate orders a sign attached to it, reading: \"The King of the Jews\", much to Caiaphas' dismay.\nWith John, Mary and Magdalene watching in horror, Jesus hangs from the cross for several agonizing hours. After forgiving the Romans and the Pharisees who condemned him to death, he asks why God has forsaken him, and declares \"It is finished\". Accomplished, Jesus dies as the temple and earth are shaken by an earthquake. While the lamps are knocked down, the curtains in the temple where God's spirit was supposed to be present, tear apart. He is then lowered from the cross and placed into a tomb, which is sealed off with a large rock.\nThree days later, Magdalene goes to visit the tomb but is shocked to see the rock broken into pieces and the tomb empty. Magdalene soon sees a man by the tomb's entrance and realizes he is Jesus, who has been resurrected. Magdalene goes to the disciples' hiding place and tells them the good news, but they don't believe her at first. Jesus then appears to them, and they all now believe, except \"Doubting\" Thomas. Once Thomas touches Jesus, then he believes.\nForty days later, Jesus is speaking to his disciples where he tells them to travel the world and spread his message. He then ascends into Heaven, and the disciples go their separate ways.\nAfter finishing his story, an elderly John says that all of the disciples were eventually killed for their beliefs, except him. He has been exiled to live alone on a deserted island until he dies.

Vincent's ideas of after-school activities involve visits to racetracks and bars. The mismatched pair begin to help each other mature. Vincent teaches Oliver how to defend himself from bullies, resulting in Oliver breaking the nose of a bully who later apologizes and gives back what he stole. Oliver befriends the boy, who introduces himself as Robert. Vincent and Oliver win a high-odds bet on the horses, enabling Vincent to pay off some of his debts.

He emotionally blackmails her by playing her off of Liz Silver, a camper that will do anything to perform on opening night. Camilla tries to ward off Artie's attentions by only making out with him, which disgusts Joel - whom Camilla has largely ignored since the audition.

After painting a picture of her anorexia as personified by a dark, sinister butterfly in black ink, which she hangs among similar artworks made by other minors suffering from eating disorders, Hannah is able to return home, in part because her parents' insurance will cover no further sessions at the hospital. Hannah is at risk for relapsing back into her old habits, and so her parents need to keep a close eye on her. Hannah tries to distract herself from the internet by going with her parents to attend Leo's wrestling competition at school.

Hannah comes to the realization that Leo himself is the unknown \"HipHopK\" after discovering that her brother had carved the words \"don't eat\" on his own stomach, a \"marking\" that had been on the screen name's profile photo. Leo dies in the hospital, surrounded by his family. After Leo's death, Hannah is welcomed back to dance class by Ms. Christie, who hugs her and praises her for facing her illness. Hannah then seeks out the real \"ButterflyAna\", and finds a homeless adult woman who is living with self-induced starvation, hoarding decaying cosmetics and beauty supplies and keeping an old laptop computer with her. Strangely, the homeless woman does in fact appear to have a small house, but does not inhabit it at all; the house looks filthy and neglected. The homeless woman claims not to be \"ButterflyAna\", but finally admits the truth after hearing that \"HipHopK\" has died. She apologizes for the loss of Hannah's brother, and says that she didn't know the pro-ana blog was hurting other people. Hannah tells the homeless woman that she hopes she gets better soon and seeks help, after which she starts a self-esteem inspiration website in honour of Leo's memory, which contains only positive inspirational quotes and no pro-ana content at all.", "tmdb_id": 273059}, "41683203": {"title": "Stations of the Cross (film)", "plot": "Maria (Lea van Acken) is a 14-year-old girl in a family attached to a Traditionalist Catholic organization, who has dedicated her life to serving God.

Percival believes he is cursed with the inability to take his own life, and his meeting Steven is meant to be.  He pays Steven to kill him.  Steven, scoffing at the idea, gives Percival a chance to reconsider, then shoots him in the chest.  When Percival survives both this and another shooting from Steven, which leaves him blinded in one eye, Steven accepts it is more than mere luck.\nIntrigued by the challenge, Steven probes Percival for clues to defeat the curse.

Although Michael at first only cares about finishing his community service hours he rediscovers his passion for the discipline he left behind long ago. Eventually Michael meets Reggie's niece Jen Monroe (Jess Brown). The two take an instant liking to one another and Jen invites him to a local Mixed Martial Arts fight.\nWhile Jen is a fan of Mixed Martial Arts she asks Michael not to tell Reggie since her uncle isn't fond of the sport. During the fight, Michael recognizes one of the fighters, Dominic Grey (Krzysztof Soszynski), as the man who brutally murdered his parents seven years ago. Hurt and enraged, Michael takes it upon himself to find a way to exact revenge. At first he tries going to the police but the police are unable to act without any evidence. After being denied entry into the local Mixed Martial Arts circuit by the fight promoter Lou (Daniel Faraldo) Michael then follows Gray home and decides to kill him with a gun but finds himself unable to do so.\nMichael again goes to the police and gives them Gray's address but the police still do not act. However one of the detectives that worked on the case involving Michael's parents takes a look into Michael's statements and decides to reopen the case.\nStill seeking revenge for his parents, Michael decides to take Reggie up on an earlier offer to help train him in Karate but doesn't tell Reggie that he wishes to kill Gray in the ring. Through his training under Reggie, Michael becomes more proficient and skilled in combat. After hearing about an upcoming tournament where the fighter that defeats all the other fighters will have a chance to fight Dominic Gray for $50,000 Michael decides to take the opportunity in order to get his revenge. Although Lou still refuses to let Michael enter the circuit, he eventually relents when Michael firmly insists on entering and defeats Lou's bodyguard.\nMichael wins a qualifying fight that allows him entry into the tournament. Reggie later finds out about Michael entering the upcoming tournament and the two have an argument which results in Michael leaving and training on his own. Jen later tells Reggie the reason why Michael is fighting and so Reggie decides to train him for the tournament. Reggie also enlists the help of his friends (Anderson Silva) and (Lyoto Machida) to help Michael train and learn every skill necessary in order to step into the cage and go toe to toe with the man who took everything from him. During his training Michael and Jen grow closer and begin a relationship.\nThe night before the fight Reggie gives Michael a black belt which he claims Michael's father told him he was only a few months away from earning. At the tournament, Michael fares well thanks to the training from Reggie and his friends. Michael makes his way up to the final fight by defeating all of his opponents with an impressive style of Karate. Before the final fight, Dominic tells Michael over the microphone that he will defeat him. In response, Michael tells how he witnessed his parents' murder over the microphone and vaguely reveals to Dominic that he knows it was him that committed the murder.\nRealizing that Michael can identify him as the murderer of his parents, Dominic plans to kill him during the fight and make it look like an accident, a plan his manager comes up with. In the first round Dominic utilizes his strength and size and insults Michael about his parents but Michael holds his own with his speed and technique. In the second round, Dominic injures his knee against the cage after attempting to hit Michael with a knee strike and Michael starts taking advantage by kicking his knee. Before the third round, Dominic's manager pulls the referee out of the cage and locks the gate, much to everyone's surprise. Reggie confronts the manager and knocks him out with one punch.\nDuring the final round, both Michael and Dominic fight with everything they have. Dominic eventually gets Michael in a chokehold and begins to strangle him to death. While in the chokehold Michael sees both his parents in the crowd. This gives Michael a second wind and he breaks the chokehold. Encouraged by both Reggie and the sight of his parents, Michael fights on.\nUtilizing all of his Karate training, Michael overpowers Dominic and viciously continues beating him on the ground. Although Michael is tempted to kill him, he ultimately remembers Reggie's earlier advice about letting him live with what he had done and spares him by breaking his leg instead, thus winning the fight.\nHaving won the tournament Michael is awarded the $50,000 prize money but gives it to Reggie for his school as a token of gratitude for training him and helping him avenge his parents' death. After losing the fight, Dominic is humiliated and ridiculed by the audience. Sometime later, Reggie's Karate school is now thriving and a newspaper article states that Dominic had confessed to the murder of Michael's parents and was imprisoned.

Almost immediately after finding a sizable  nugget, he is robbed at gunpoint by an unnamed man who subsequently flees into the  bush. Shortly after, the unnamed man is himself held at gunpoint by legendary outlaw \"Thunderclap\" Newman, who claims the nugget. However, their exchange is cut short by the screams of the Chinese man (who is killed offscreen) followed by inhuman roars. Newman shoots the unnamed man in the leg to incapacitate him, intending to distract the approaching threat while he escapes. The creature\u2014a  large, hairy, ape-like animal\u2014quickly kills the unnamed man and then chases down and kills Newman.\nIn the present day, two exterminators-cum-treasure-hunters, Jack and Kent, paddle up the same river from the film's opening, intending to find Newman's gold. They enter the bush, camp for the night, and, the next day, navigate via  GPS to a system of  lava tubes, where they quickly find Newman's gold. Upon returning to their kayak with the gold in a bag, Kent attempts to murder Jack but is distracted by movement on the far riverbank. Thinking this to be a potential witness, Kent goes after the individual and leaves both Jack's body and the gold.\nMeanwhile, park ranger Rhiannon spots the smoke from Jack and Kent's campfire from the previous night and investigates. She soon encounters Jack, who had merely blacked out during Kent's attack and now has the bag of gold. Spotting Kent, Jack hides the bag of gold in the river and urges Rhiannon to call the police. Kent spots them before Rhiannon can radio for assistance and holds them at gunpoint, ordering Rhiannon to throw her radio into the river and threatening to kill them both unless Jack reveals where he hid the gold. Jack lies as to the location of the gold and proceeds to lead Kent on a trek through the bush, during which the three come across a makeshift sleeping area and a large footprint. Kent dismisses this but, when distracted by the creature's roar, is overpowered by Jack, who steals his gun and flees with Rhiannon. Kent is left to face the creature but manages to shelter in a hollowed-out tree truck too small for the creature to enter and scares the creature off by stabbing its hand with a pocketknife. While running from the creature, Jack and Rhiannon discover that it will not cross water.\nUpon returning to the river, Kent is confronted by a man in a ghillie suit, Detective McNab (played by  Vernon Wells), who is investigating the series of disappearances in the area and suspects it to be the work of a serial killer. McNab is unconvinced by Kent's explanations as to why he is in the remote area and, noting Kent's blood-covered pocketknife, handcuffs him to a large tree root. Kent then tries to claim the presence of an \"evolutionary throwback ... a yowie,\" which McNab ignores. However, while attempting to phone the local police station, McNab (who is revealed to be on suspension) spots the yowie. McNab's phone rings while he is attempting to take a photograph of the yowie, which then brutally  dismembers him. Kent resorts to breaking his hand with a rock in order to escape the handcuffs.\nWhile Rhiannon is asleep, Jack attempts to recover the gold and is confronted by Kent on one side of the river (wielding the deceased McNab's gun) and the yowie on the other. Kent, satisfied that the yowie has killed Jack, chases down Rhiannon, shoots her through the leg and uses her as bait to lure the yowie into an ambush. The yowie, having impaled Jack through the leg but stopped short of killing him, flees with Rhiannon back to its lair while Kent is distracted by a snake.\nKent then confronts Jack, having deduced that Jack hid the gold in the river. Jack, who by now considers the gold to be cursed, urges Kent to focus on the yowie. Kent refuses and Jack later kills him after a brief but intense struggle. Jack then tracks the yowie to its lair, coming across an unconscious Rhiannon and a collection of items taken by the yowie from its victims over the years.\nJack attempts to battle the yowie but is clearly outmatched and resolves to flee with Rhiannon. Coming up to a sheer cliff and with the yowie pursuing them, Jack reveals that he took a stick of dynamite from the yowie's collection. He throws the lit dynamite stick at the yowie's feet and the explosion blows the yowie to pieces.

Meanwhile, Apollon Media is bought by its new owner Mark Schneider, and to make some needed changes, he learns the hero division (specifically the Second League) is losing profits. As the Second League heroes poorly chase a purse snatcher, Barnaby arrives and swiftly ends the chase after Tigers crashes into a warehouse. While the main heroes stop a bank robbery, and Rock Bison is seen struggling to make it during the season (i.e. copying Sky High's signature pose, or Origami's photo-bomb style), Barnaby wants to go back to the First League so his abilities would be put to better use. Afterwards, Tiger & Bunny are called in by Schneider to be promoted back to the First League right away. At the promotion ceremony Barnaby is spotlighted, and when everyone else expects Kotetsu to appear, Schneider reveals he hired another hero, Golden Ryan, to replace him as he views Wild Tiger as past his prime. Kotetsu doesn't fight this decision as he doesn't want to hold Barnaby back from returning to the First League. On their first mission together, Ryan & Barnaby successfully keep a toppling tower from falling, but Ryan's use of his gravity powers kept the other heroes from helping at all.\nThe next day, Schneider has his secretary Virgil inform the Second Leaguers that the Board of Directors have cancelled their airtime segment. When the main heroes take a day off and reflect, Kaede calls Karina (Blue Rose) for a favor to help cheer up Kotetsu. The morning after, another strange occurrence happens on a bridge with witness statements pointing to the Legend of the Goddess. Upon hearing the howling sound from before, the heroes split into three groups and encounter three NEXTs: Richard Max, a hypersonic howler-boxer; Kasha Graham, a belly-dancer illusionist; and Priest Johnny Wong, an elderly man who puts people into nightmare comas. Fire Emblem encounters the elderly man, and is sent into a coma and forced to relive when he struggled to come to terms with his sexuality and gender identity during his childhood. The dream causes his powers to let loose uncontrolled forcing Blue Rose to stay by and keep the fire from spreading. As Ryan is from overseas and unfamiliar with the Legend of the Goddess, he is told the legend ends with the city being plunged into a cavernous abyss (which Barnaby thinks Ryan's powers may cause) and that very day is tomorrow. Kotetsu later visits Fire Emblem, where he is lectured by Blue Rose about Barnaby still following his ideals as he is using his increased pay to give local orphans a fun time at the festival.\nIt\u2019s the day of the festival and Kotetsu's family comes to visit as Kaede got tickets from Blue Rose as the favor she asked. By the time of the evening parade, Kaede convinces Kotetsu to continue being a hero as it is what he wants and it makes him happy. During the parade the three NEXTs from earlier cause an implosion under the street where the parade is being held- thus causing the final act of the Goddess- and Ryan asking if Barnaby suspected him. Kotetsu goes back to the hospital with piles of fire extinguishers to allow Blue Rose to give backup to the other heroes. The three NEXTs face off against the same heroes from earlier: Blue Rose & Dragon Kid v Wong, Sky High & Rock Bison & Origami Cyclone v Max, and Ryan & Barnaby v Kasha. As the heroes battle, Schneider is abducted by a monster robot and Agnes takes this chance to reinstate Wild Tiger to rescue him. Tiger uses his grapnel line to latch onto the machine taking Schneider, and is dragged across the city.\nWhile fighting Wong, Dragon Kid proclaims that Fire Emblem is the greatest person she knows and is both kind and strong. Upon hearing this via TV, Fire Emblem wakes up and rushes to aid Blue Rose & Dragon Kid, leading to a combined win. Origami retreats from fighting Max, only to return after having copied the form of a parade performer dress as a reverberator, allowing Sky High & Rock Bison to go for the knock out. Ryan tells Barnaby to head into a narrow pass where Ryan vertically extends his gravity field to neutralize Kasha as she follows. After beating Kasha, Tiger is saved by Barnaby just in time as Lunatic appears trying to end Schneider. Tiger stalls Lunatic while Ryan & Barnaby tail the machine taking Schneider to the port. After Ryan grounds the machine, it is revealed to have been Schneider's secretary Virgil this whole time. He explains his real name is Andrew Scott, and he infiltrated Schneider's company to plan revenge for him killing his father and making it look like a suicide to hide the illegal activities. The other three NEXTs sided with Andrew for revenge as well: Richard Max lost his boxing league, Kasha Graham (who used her NEXT abilities as an entertainer) lost her cabaret business and Johnny Wong (who was a Monk) lost his temple which Schneider demolished.\nAndrew tries to ask Barnaby to see his side of things, but Barnaby has since moved on from wanting revenge and wants to prevent Andrew from killing Schneider to save him from himself. Andrew uses his NEXT powers to create a gigantic mecha-crab, which Barnaby holds at bay until his powers recharge and tries to reason with Andrew. Meanwhile, Tiger and Lunatic battle until they land on a blimp where Lunatic kicks Tiger off and into the fray with Barnaby. Tiger & Bunny reunite to hold off Andrew until the other heroes arrive, which gives Barnaby the time to finish recharging his powers. Tiger & Bunny, now using 100 Power, defeat Andrew in the 1 minute limit of Tiger's powers in grand spectacle. At dawn, Tiger & Bunny are celebrated for their in-sync come back and are asked if Tiger will return for good. Tiger worries his 1 minute time limit may not make him a true hero anymore, until citizens start chanting for Tiger across the news feeds that he is their hero. Agnes, now given authority on hero participation, fully reinstates Tiger and allows their partnership again, which the duo prominently display to the masses.\nFollowing their victory, the main heroes work on the cleanup effort, Andrew and his cohorts adjust to prison rehabilitation very well, the Second League is fully reinstated, Schneider is convicted for his crimes, Kaede continues to develop her powers, and Ryan is offered a larger salary from an overseas business and leaves.

Because elderly tenant Mr. Bezzerides (informally called \"Mr. B\" by the protagonists) has not paid his rent in two months, Callie checks on him, and discovers a strange machine in his apartment that takes Polaroid photos of their living room's picture window\u2014apparently 24 hours in the future, always at 8 pm, although Mr. B's photo display includes daytime photos and is missing some photos. The friends check Mr. B's storage unit and find his inexplicably charred corpse; he has apparently been dead for a week. Gambling addict Jasper pushes to use the machine to win bets but loses, and the next day's photo confirms they will do just that. It also shows that Finn has finally created a new painting; copying the work in the photo gets him past his block. Based on what happened to Mr. B and notes in his journal, they theorize that they have to make sure the events in the photos\u2014whatever they may be\u2014have to occur, or their timeline will stop, and they will therefore cease to be.\nSeveral days go by. The friends cover up Mr. B's disappearance, including lying to the complex security guard, Big Joe, claiming the old man is in the hospital. After a week they get a disturbing photo: Callie kissing Jasper, while Finn paints in the background. Feeling that they have to do what's in the photos, they pose at 8pm the following night.  But the actual kiss goes on too long while Finn paints, and he gets angry and jealous.\nThe next photo shows Jasper's violent bookie Ivan at the apartment. Not knowing why he would be there, Jasper calls him the next morning, saying he won't be making any bets that day. The call raises Ivan's suspicions and he visits Jasper that night, learning of the machine. Ivan forces the friends to now pose for the photos with many more event results for Ivan to make bets on. Finn and Jasper's friendship is strained by these events, as Ivan will be keeping each night's photo, preventing Finn from seeing his painting. Jasper manages to get a cellphone picture of the next photo before giving it to Ivan's goon, Marcus. This photo shows a hastily made skull and crossbones on the canvas, which Jasper believes is a warning to themselves, so he hides weapons (a kitchen knife, golf club, and hammer) near the couch.\nThe next evening, Finn runs into Big Joe at the gate, who has just gotten a job as a police officer. Marcus sees their meeting and calls Ivan, who does not believe their story about Big Joe. Ivan threatens all of them, but Jasper convinces him that tonight's new photo is of Ivan's death at Marcus' hands. While Ivan is retrieving the photo, Jasper stabs Marcus, then clubs Ivan to death on his return. They hide the bodies in Mr. B's storage unit. Finn and Callie fight, so Finn sleeps on the couch. Later that night, they are visited by Mr. B's colleague, Dr. Heidecker, who is looking for Mr. B.  Finn and Jasper can't keep their stories straight about Mr. B, so Dr. Heidecker levels a gun at them and forces them to confess. Mr. B had mailed Heidecker a photo that covers the next night, but taken before his death, meaning that the machine could be set to take photos more than 24 hours in advance. The photo shows blood on the window, Mr. B's hat on the friends' couch (Jasper has taken to wearing the dead man's hat), and a picture of a green coil that resembles the broken device on the ground next to Mr. B's corpse. Dr. Heidecker theorizes that \"time\" did not kill Mr. B for trying to change the future - he knocked over a coil in his storage unit and the released gas killed him. As she does not know how to adjust the settings of the machine, Jasper shoots Heidecker dead using Ivan's gun.\nThe next night's photo shows Callie and Jasper having sex in the window with Finn unconscious on the couch. Finn talks with Jasper to try to devise a means to prevent events, but Jasper knocks him out and locks him in Mr. B's storage unit\u2014he does not believe Dr. Heidecker's theory and intends to prevent a paradox, making sure the photo happens, no matter what. Trying to find a way out of the locked storage unit, he searches Heidecker's purse and finds the photo that includes blood on the window, Mr B's hat on the couch, and the painting of the coil, and realizes that he had to have painted the coil in the future the next day so that Mr. B would die in the storage room in the first place, thus allowing him to escape using Mr. B's keys. He escapes and goes to the machine. He calls Jasper, who sees him at the machine, and threatens to destroy it if Jasper does not stop. A fight ensues, culminating with Callie smashing Jasper's head in. When making the painting to match Heidecker's photo, Finn realizes a discrepancy. He discovers that the camera also takes a photo at 8 am, a truth which Callie kept to herself. Callie reveals that she has been using the morning photo to send herself messages to manipulate events and rekindle her relationship with Finn; the sex photo is one of those missing from Mr. B's wall, from a drunken night a month ago (the other missing photos are ones of Callie and Jasper being affectionate, which she took down from the wall when she first discovered the machine). Finn rejects Callie and goes to destroy the machine, so she shoots him, creating the blood splatter on the window from Heidecker's photo - she thinks that if she sends herself a message in the window when the photo is taken, it will send a message to herself 24 hours ago, preventing these events from happening. While Callie is attempting to tape a note to herself on the window, Big Joe stops by, discovers the murdered Jasper and Finn, and arrests her.\nAs Callie is led away by Joe - confident that the timeline will reset - the note she left falls off the window, making permanent the events that have taken place.

Lockdown, a Cybertronian assassin and bounty hunter working for the Creators, is tasked to find Optimus Prime and kill any Autobots who refuse to give up his location.

They hijack a smaller ship, containing other Transformers called the Dinobots, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots learn that Galvatron is Megatron reincarnated, plotting to use the Seed and the Transformer drones to conquer the world and that KSI plans to use the Seed in the Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium.

Regina starts investigating the story by questioning various characters who were involved.\nChapter 1: Voice of Silence-\nThe first person she approaches is a local cashewnut merchant, Shailesha who knows both Richi and his childhood friend Raghu. Richi had been in a remand home for 8 years and Raghu had escaped to Bombay to work in a hotel and later with a local gang. Shailesha accidentally comes across Raghu during one of his Bombay trips. The two meet up in Bombay harbour where Shailesha tells Raghu that his father is no more and his mother is making a living by selling fish at the local market. Raghu tells him he cannot leave Bombay as he knows many secrets of his employer. He plans to relocate to Dubai with his mother, once he has sorted out the necessary funds.\nTo do this, Raghu steals a red bag which was important for a 'deal' between the Bombay party and an interested party in the US. He fights his ways through the gang's henchmen and escapes to Malpe where Shailesha provides him with a safe house. Raghu realises that his location is compromised as two armed gangsters approach his house and start knocking at the front door. As Raghu steeled himself for the impending gunfight, the knocking stops and the men leave.\nChapter 2: Richard Antony alias Richi-\nThe second narrative comes from a close ally of Richi, Dinesha, who is held in lock-up. Richi is a brash and flamboyant young man who carries out dirty work for a local gangster-cum-businessman, Shankar Poojary. Poojary has links with the Bombay underworld and runs several fishing boats in Malpe. Richi has earned a bad reputation for himself and is a disgrace to his father, a priest in the local church.\nPoojary summons Richi and Dinesha to his estate and tasks him to find Balu, one of his employees to 'teach him a lesson. Poojary asks Richi not to overdo it by 'losing control'. The annual Janmashtami festival in Udupi is in full swing as Richi and the gang arrive at Jodu Raste. Balu has painted himself as a tiger and is participating in Huli-vesha (tiger dance). Richi knocks out Balu and has him sent to the harbour. However, he takes a detour when he hears that Raghu is back in town and needs a visit.\nIt is revealed that Richi and Dinesha were the armed gangsters who were looking for Raghu in the previous story. Richi forces his way into the house and goes about explaining the made-up story of a Cuban boy (Tony Montana from the film Scarface) and a boy from Mandva (Vijay Chauhan from the movie Agneepath), and how a person at the receiving end of a beating often doesn't realise why he is being served this. This story doubles as a threat to Raghu and also as a metaphor for the viewers who are kept in dark as the violent story unfolds. Richi finds the red bag which Raghu had stolen from the Bombay gang and asks the latter to join him for a boat ride. Raghu reluctantly agrees to say that he has to join his mother for dinner later in the day.\nOnce on the fishing boat, Richi is torturing Balu and forcing a confession out of him. Eventually, Richi pulls out a gun on Balu who by now is a broken man, and fires a shot. It would seem that Balu is no more.\nChapter 3: Fish Curry-\nRaghu's mother Ratnakka makes a living out of selling fish in Malpe. After the death of her husband, her life is of struggle. Raghu visits his mother at his childhood house and tells her that he wishes to move permanently to Dubai along with her. However, he has to leave immediately and will return to pick her up once her documents are in order. He agrees to visit her the next day for dinner where she will prepare her signature dish Meen-saru (fish curry). The next day, a gleeful Ratnakka is shopping for fish in the local market, where she lets her fellow fisherwomen know that she is leaving for Dubai soon. That evening Ratnakka elaborately prepares the fish curry and waits for her son to arrive. Her joy turns to disappointment as the hours go by and she slowly starts to realise that her son may not return.\nChapter 4: Whispers in the Wind-\nMunna has a soft corner for Balu's sister Sharada, who sells fish. He often roams around the fish market in hopes of getting a glimpse of her. He also tries to woo her with the help of a young lad, aptly known as Democracy. Munna works as a repairman for Shankar Poojary's boats. During the routine inspection of a fishing boat that Richi had used for his earlier adventure, Munna discovers an empty shell casing on the deck. Having the knowledge that Balu was previously seen with Richi at the harbour, Munna concludes that Balu has been murdered by Richi and his gang.\nChapter 5: Ka-\nBalu is in a ragged state when Regina approaches him for questioning. Balu has developed a prejudice for crows and starts to pelt stones at them whenever he sees one. During one of his fishing trips, he catches a heavy log of wood in the fishing net. Balu decides to keep this to himself and soon discovers that the log actually contains a priceless relic which glows like gold.\nBalu tries to make a profit out of this by selling the merchandise to a foreign party through a Bombay-based middleman. The middleman is not able to make full payment as the merchandise has been misplaced and a deal cannot be finalised. As the Janmashtami festival approaches Balu has himself painted as a tiger for Pili-vesha and is performing at Jod raste. Richi and the gang knock him out and take him on a fishing boat to force a confession. During the interrogation, Richi pulls out a gun and it is revealed that the shot was fired at Raghu. During his childhood, Richi had committed a hot-blooded murder trying to protect Raghu, after which the latter escaped to Bombay leaving Richi behind to be arrested. Richi has deep bitterness against Raghu for his betrayal because of which he spent 8 years in a remand home.\nOn opening the red bag, it is revealed that it contains the merchandise which Balu was trying to sell off and Raghu is the middleman, who stole the item before the deal could go through. He was planning to sell it in Dubai in order to secure a life for him and his mother.\nFinal Chapter: Reasons-\nRichi returns to Malpe where he is celebrating with Poojary and the tigers from Pili-vesha. Munna believes Balu was killed by Richi's gang and is now blinded by hatred for Richi and compassion for Sharada. Finding the right opportunity, Munna pulls out Dinesha's gun and shoots down Richi who in his dying moments is unaware of Munna's motive. The irony is clearly seen now that Richi becomes a victim of his own story of The Cuban boy and boy from Mandva. Dinesha returns the favour by killing Munna, who in his dying moments finds peace in the fact that he has avenged Sharada.\nIt is now clear that Regina was investigating the triple murders of Richi, Munna, and Raghu. She concludes that the story has many facets and cannot be clubbed into a single narrative and hence decides to name the story, Ulidavaru Kandante (As Seen by the Rest).", "tmdb_id": 262476}, "44967161": {"title": "Ulsaha Committee", "plot": "The film is about a school drop out whose pursuit for amazing scientific inventions lands him in trouble."}, "37712682": {"title": "Un Samayal Arayil", "plot": "Kalidasa (Prakash Raj) works in the state archaeological department and is a food lover, he is 45 years old and remains unmarried.

The pilot brings the aircraft to a stop at the end of the runway despite an exploded tire.\nIn a flashback to his early youth as an Italian-American boy in Torrance, California, Louie misbehaves by stealing, drinking liquor and smoking. He is often picked on by others for his Italian ethnicity. His brother Peter, seeing how fast Louie runs, trains him to be a runner. Louie becomes a disciplined distance runner, earning the nickname \"The Torrance Tornado\". Louie finishes 8th in the 1936 Summer Olympics and sets a record in the final lap for the 5,000-meter race.\nReturning to his 1943 combat service, Louie leaves with some of the surviving crew and several replacements on a search-and-rescue mission with an old plane. One engine fails and the aircraft ultimately crashes in the ocean. Louie survives alongside two others, Phil and Mac, floating on two inflatable rafts.\nOn their 27th day adrift, they attract the attention of a Japanese fighter plane, which strafes and damages the rafts but misses them. Mac dies six days later. On the 47th day, Japanese sailors find and capture Louie and Phil. Now prisoners of war, Louie and Phil are imprisoned on Kwajalein Atoll. The American airmen are interrogated for info on newer bombers and the Norden bombsight. Louie states they flew older models and draws a rendering of a Philco radio. They are dragged out to disrobe and kneel on planks, expecting to be executed. Instead, they are crudely washed and shipped to Japan. Upon arrival, they are sent to different POW camps.\nAt camp \u014cmori, in Tokyo, Louis and his fellow POWs are the responsibility of Japanese corporal Mutsuhiro Watanabe who is especially hard on Louie, beating him often. Louie is given an opportunity to broadcast a message home saying he is alive after learning the U.S. government classified him as KIA. As he refuses to broadcast another message full of anti-American propaganda, he is sent back to camp, where Watanabe has each prisoner punch him.\nAfter two years, Watanabe is promoted to Sergeant and leaves the camp. The camp is damaged when Tokyo was bombed, so Louie and the others are moved to Naoetsu prison camp. Here, Watanabe is again in command but as he is now a Sergeant, he supervises the prisoners at work loading coal barges. Louie pauses during work and is punished by Watanabe making him lift a large wooden beam and hold it over his head. He orders a guard to shoot him if he drops it, but Louie defiantly holds it up despite his exhaustion. This enrages Watanabe as Louie stares him straight in the eye, provoking him to beat him severely.\nAt the end of the war, Louie and the other POWs are liberated when the Americans occupy Japan just as a bomber flies overhead and confirms that the war is over. Louie tries to find Watanabe in his quarters but sees he has already fled. He sits down, staring at a picture of Watanabe as a child alongside his father. He is returned home to America, where he kisses the ground on arriving home.\nAt the end of the film, there is a slideshow of the real Louie and the events in his life following the war: He married and had two children. Phil too survived and married. Mutsuhiro \"The Bird\" Watanabe went into hiding and evaded prosecution despite being on the top 40 most-wanted Japanese war criminals list by General Douglas MacArthur. Louie lived out his promise to convert to Christianity, to devote his life to God and to forgive his wartime captors, meeting with many of them. Many years later, however, Watanabe still refused to meet with Louie.\nLouie had an opportunity to relive his time as an Olympian when he ran a leg of the Olympic Torch relay for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

One year later, her former childhood best friend Blaire Lily is chatting with her boyfriend Mitch Roussel on Skype, during which they agree to lose their virginities to each other on prom night. Soon after they are joined by their friends and classmates Jess Felton, Ken Smith, and Adam Sewell, and an unknown user known as \"billie227.\"\nThe group of friends tries various ways to get rid of the intruder but are unsuccessful each time. Blaire looks up the account and realizes that it belonged to Laura Barns, revealing \"billie227\" as Laura even though the friends are still incredulous about this possibility. The group suspects that a classmate, Val Rommel, is pranking them. After they invite Val to their chat, Jess' Facebook page is updated with embarrassing photos of Val at a party. Jess denies uploading the photos and deletes them from her account, but the pictures instantly reappear on Adam's account. Val receives a message or picture not visible to the others, but which she considers a threat. Angry, she calls 911 to report that she is being harassed, and abruptly leaves the chat. The group receives a photo of Val and Laura's Facebook messages from before Laura's death, with Val telling Laura to kill herself. Val reappears on the chat, sitting motionless and silent next to a bottle of bleach before collapsing. Police officers arrive shortly after; the friends eavesdrop and learn that Val died from a presumed suicide. User \"billie227\" then sends each of the friends a personalized message proving intimate knowledge of their secrets; in Blaire's case, which is the one visible to the audience, this turns out to be a couple of pictures revealing that she had an affair with Adam. Ken distributes a program to remove \"billie227\" from the chat, and then Adam attempts to call the police. However, the 911 operator turns out to be the intruder and re-enters the chat, revealing a camera view from the other side of Ken's room. He approaches the camera source and his Skype is briefly cut before it shows him killing himself with a blender.\nBillie/Laura forces the remaining four friends to play a game of Never Have I Ever, stating that the loser will die. During the course of the game, it is revealed that Jess started a rumor that Blaire had an eating disorder; Blaire stole and crashed Jess' mother's car; Mitch made out with Laura (although he says it was one-sided on her end and he pushed her off), and also reported Adam to the police for dealing cannabis; Jess stole $800 from Adam; and Adam offered to trade Jess' life for the others in the group. Tensions flare and a drunken Adam finally loses his temper and uses the game to force Blaire to reveal that she is no longer a virgin, having slept with him behind Mitch's back. Mitch is distraught and retaliates by forcing Adam to admit that he roofied a classmate, raped her while she was unconscious, and then forced her to abort the resulting pregnancy.\nBlaire and Adam receive messages sent remotely to their printers which they refuse to show to Mitch and Jess. Mitch threatens to leave if Blaire does not show the note and Laura warns that Mitch will die if he signs off. In a moment of panic, Blaire shows her paper which states: \"If you reveal this note, Adam will die.\" Adam shoots himself, revealing he had the same note, except it was for Blaire.\nLaura continues the game, asking Jess if she defaced her grave.

They target a corrupt minister and become the most wanted people in Mumbai, but also earn respect, affection, and admiration in the media and general public.\nMeanwhile, ACP Ashok Kaale (Sanjay Dutt) meets his superior, DCP Shivraman (Shiv Kumar Subramaniam) who introduces him to Police Commissioner Arvind Kaul (Raza Murad) with the task of deciphering the Ungli gang.

Eventually, it goes so: a college was attended to by the bomb squad when there was news that a bomb was planted there. Nikhil took advantage of the situation and met his girlfriend (Rachel White) with whom he shared a kiss, but soon they were caught by the dogs of the Bomb Squad. Later, it surfaced up that the call was made from Mishra's desk, and Nikhil did it.

Nikhil, it is shown, attends a disco bar, where Kaale calls him up to discuss matters concerning the \"Ungli\" gang.\nNikhil begins searching for altruistic opportunities to earn the Ungli gang great fame, once by blowing up the roads in front of a minister's house and accusing politicians and PWD workers of torturing the people by lavishly spending money on renovation of roads directly linked to houses and offices of politicians and corporates alone, another instance by putting up a label of dishonesty on the auto-rickshaw drivers by accusing them of charging high rates and showing reluctance when asked to drive to places close by.

The old man was firm, but when his granddaughter, while waiting at a bus stop, was threatened with an acid attack, the old man was forced to swerve from his stand to protect her. This plunged Maya into grief, but Abhay was angry at one of Maya's comments and this paved the way for the \"Ungli\" gang. Nikhil poses as a law student to illusion the four.\nWhile preparing for a raid, Nikhil sprained his knee, but later called up Kaale when the four left. However, feeling remorseful, he later attacked Kaale to defend his new \"friends\", but when his identity was discovered, the four friends slammed him with Abhay hitting him hard, and Kaale further hitting him, but Nikhil later chides Kaale for believing the \"Ungli\" gang as a criminal force.

The Drinkers Association and Bhoomesh's fans, led by Ganesh, form groups to fight over this issue.\nAravind and Anjana begin a friendship, and he insists to her that if everything is spoken directly from the heart, then there would be no problem between anyone. He asks her to speak openly with Vinodh and sort out the difference of opinion between them. She does not agree to this, and Aravind challenges her that if he successfully stops the feud between Bhoomesh and Ravi just by means of speaking, Anjana should talk openly with Vinodh to sort out their issues.

Ilavarasi is the daughter of a rich moneylender and greedy loan shark (Vazhakku Enn Muthuraman) who goes to any extent to get his loaned money back from the people who borrowed it. He also loves his daughter and will get anything she points at and will do anything for her. Ilavarasi, as a result of this upbringing, is an arrogant, spoilt brat of a man and is married to a spineless man who does whatever she bids him to do. Though Thenu does not have a good opinion about Ilavarasi in the beginning, they become friends after an incident where Ilavarasi thrashes a stalker who was harassing Thenu repeatedly over the phone. Soon, the women become good friends, enjoy each other's company over the day, and spend a lot of time together.\nOne day, when Karthik and Thenu are preparing for a wedding in Karthik's employer's family, Thenu says that she has only a simple jewellery and will feel out of place and belittled at such a grand wedding. Since Karthik is not in a comfortable financial state to buy her some jewels, she decides to ask Ilavarasi if she could borrow her necklace and return it after the ceremony, and Ilavarasi also happily obliges. The trouble begins when a chain snatcher steals the necklace on their way back home.\nWhen Ilavarasi's father learns of this, he becomes wild and scolds Thenu, Karthik, and even his own daughter. He asks Karthik to lodge a formal complaint to the police. The policemen's attitude towards this issue is lethargic, and they treat them with negligence. Meanwhile, the inspector tells Ilavarasi's father that while Thenu's own chain is still intact, his daughter's jewellery alone is gone, so even Thenu and Karthik could be possible suspects, and this kind of cheating is the latest trend among robbers these days. Ilavarasi's father hears this and poisons his daughter's mind. Ilavarasi also misjudges certain incidents with Thenu and distances herself slowly. One fine day, Ilavarasi throws a surprise party for Karthik and Thenu's wedding anniversary and gifts an expensive showpiece. However, day after day, Ilavarasi's father continues to verbally abuse them and looks at them as thieves. Then, Vennila suddenly gets kidnapped, and after some commotions, Karthik learns that Ilavarasi and her father have orchestrated the whole kidnap drama to check if they have the money from selling the stolen necklace. Karthik is enraged and argues with Ilavarasi's father, who asks him to first find the stolen necklace or at least give the money for the jewellery's worth and then talk as much as he pleases. Karthik, unable to see his family suffer humiliation, agrees to give back the money somehow.\nKarthik goes to his village to sell a property, leaving Thenu and Vennila at home. However, here too, the land brokers make use of his helpless emergency situation and buy the land for exactly the amount that Karthik owes Ilavarasi's father, much lesser than the land's actual worth. Karthik comes back to the city with the money but is in for a rude shock. He finds that Thenu has committed suicide by hanging herself. He reads her suicide note, where she tells that there was a secret camera in the gift that Ilavarasi gave for their anniversary, and their intimate moments were filmed and leaked to the internet. Her stalker had seen this and verbally abused her in public. When she confronted Ilavarasi and her father about this, he told that they fixed the camera only to monitor their activities to find the truth about the theft and they are not responsible if the video is leaked to the internet. When she argued with him, he slapped and humiliated her further. Unable to bear all the humiliation, she has taken this extreme step.\nKarthik is blinded with fury after reading this, and when Ilavarasi's father comes to get his money, he gives it to him and asks him to return his dead wife. This leads to an argument, and he is beaten up by goons, but he bashes all of them and finally strangles Ilavarasi's father to death with his own gold chains.

Scudder, Kenny, Landau, Peter, and TJ drive to the cemetery. Scudder orders TJ to stay in the car. After a stand off, Lucia, alive but with two fingers cut down to the bone, is returned to her father. Albert inspects the money and discovers some were counterfeit. A shootout ensues. Peter is killed, and Scudder wounds Ray. Albert and Ray escape in their van, with TJ hiding in the back.\nAfter Albert and Ray arrive at their place, TJ sneaks out of the van. He tells Scudder their address. Albert betrays the wounded Ray by strangling him to death with a metal wire while in the basement. Scudder and Kenny find TJ outside the house and they all silently enter the house finding Albert calmly eating his dinner. Albert surrenders and Scudder cuffs him. Kenny wants to kill him but Scudder talks him down, seeing how TJ is in the room and is watching everything. Scudder reminds Kenny that there is enough evidence to put Albert behind bars for the rest of his life. Kenny reluctantly agrees. Scudder leaves Kenny alone with Albert while he puts TJ in a taxi to his apartment. Kenny knocks Albert unconscious with a bottle. He goes into the basement where he finds Ray\u2019s body and tools used for dismembering bodies. While Kenny is downstairs, Albert wakes up.\nScudder goes back inside the house and finds Albert gone.

After a table-turning fight, Scudder overpowers and tasers Albert. He eventually kills him with a gunshot to the head. A while later, police arrive at the crime scene with Scudder observing from afar.\nScudder returns home to find TJ sleeping on the couch and spots a drawing that TJ made of himself as a superhero, with a sickle on his costume representing his sickle cell anemia.", "tmdb_id": 169917}, "39177704": {"title": "Walk of Shame (film)", "plot": "Meghan Miles, a newscaster for local Los Angeles TV affiliate KZLA6, is rejected for an anchor position with a network news program in favor of someone with an Asian last name.\nHaving made prior plans with her friends Rose and Denise to go to a club, Meghan ends up highly intoxicated and is invited to join a group of men in a booth.

Terence Fletcher, the conductor of the Shaffer Conservatory Studio Band, recruits him to play in the Studio ensemble as an alternate for core drummer Carl Tanner. Andrew quickly discovers that Fletcher is relentlessly strict, emotionally manipulative, and abusive to his students; he slaps and berates Andrew when he fails to keep tempo during the ensemble's rehearsal of Hank Levy's titular piece, \"Whiplash.\"\nDetermined to impress Fletcher, Andrew intensifies his drum practicing. After their first set at a jazz competition, Andrew misplaces Tanner's sheet music. Since Tanner cannot play without the sheets, Andrew replaces him for the next set. After a successful performance of \"Whiplash,\" Fletcher promotes Andrew to the core drummer. However, Andrew is taken aback when Fletcher abruptly gives the position to Ryan Connolly, a drummer from a lower-level ensemble within Shaffer. Because of his single-mindedness toward music, Andrew's relationship with his family deteriorates, and he breaks up with his girlfriend, Nicole, to focus on his ambitions. After a grueling five-hour practice session with Tanner and Connolly on \"Caravan,\" Andrew earns back the core position.\nOn the way to the next competition, Andrew's bus breaks down.

He learns that Casey hanged himself due to depression and anxiety caused by Fletcher's abuse. Casey's parents want Fletcher held accountable, and Andrew agrees to testify anonymously, leading Shaffer to terminate Fletcher. Andrew subsequently abandons drumming.\nMonths later, Andrew encounters Fletcher playing piano at a jazz club. Over a drink, Fletcher admits his teaching methods were harsh but argues they were necessary to motivate his students to become successful, citing Charlie Parker's rise to fame as an example. He invites Andrew to perform with his band at the JVC Jazz Festival, assuring him that the songs will be the same ones played by the Studio Band; Andrew hesitantly accepts. Andrew invites Nicole to the performance but finds out she is in a new relationship.\nOnstage at JVC, before the first piece, Fletcher reveals that he knows Andrew testified against him. As revenge, Fletcher leads the band into a song Andrew does not know and does not have the sheet music to. After a disastrous performance, Andrew walks offstage humiliated but returns and cuts off Fletcher's introduction to the next piece by playing the intro to \"Caravan\", cueing the band himself. Initially angered, Fletcher resumes conducting. As the piece finishes, Andrew continues into an extended, unexpected solo.

Having no choice, Hanne sits down.\nBenjamin tells Hanne that he is like a superhero: like many heroes, he, too, has no parents; he never met his father as he abandoned the family when Benjamin was born, and his mother committed suicide when he was 8. He lives alone with his ailing grandmother. He regards his \"superpower\" as invisibility, as he was never noticed by most people during his childhood, due to him being socially awkward. He says he learned programming and hacked his first system when he was 14. Though he felt like a loser in real life, he felt a sense of belonging on the Internet. While spending most of his time on Darknet, he met his hacking hero, MRX, whose identity no one knows and who can hack into any system. Benjamin aspires to be like him.\nHowever, as he was unable to attend university, he worked as a pizza delivery boy to pay the bills. He tells Hanne that, one night while he delivered pizzas to a group of students, he saw Marie, a girl with whom he was in love since his school days. Hearing her having trouble with examinations, he decided to help her and be a 'superhero'. He went to the University, hacked into its servers to download the exam questions\u2014but he was caught by a security guard and arrested. Having no prior criminal record, he was forced to perform community service as a punishment.\nHe tells Hanne that while working on cleaning the streets as punishment, he met Max, a fellow hacker, who Benjamin feels is the opposite of himself; a charismatic, cocky and confident individual. Later, Max had introduced him to his colleagues Stephan and Paul. After Benjamin proved himself as a hacker, Max explained to him that the concept of social engineering is the greatest form of hacking. They decide to form a hacking group, called \"Clowns Laughing At You\", nicknamed CLAY, and they use Benjamin's house as a base of operations, since Benjamin was forced to send his grandmother to a nursing home due to her Alzheimer's disease. They cause general mayhem around Berlin in a form of pranking, becoming popular around social media. However, MRX, with whom is Max obsessed, mocks them outright. Infuriated, Max wants to perform a more outrageous feat of hacking, and Benjamin suggest hacking the main building of BND (German Central Intelligence). Impressed by this outrageous idea, the group agrees with Benjamin and decide to hack the BND in order to impress MRX.\nUsing dumpster diving and phishing to gain access to the BND building, they manage to hack the internal servers and hack the printers to print their logo, titled \"NO SYSTEM IS SAFE\", all around the building, impressing MRX. However, when they go to a club and celebrate, Benjamin notices Max kissing Marie. Infuriated, Benjamin refuses to let them into the house, also offending Marie when she visits him due to his anger. Feeling inferior, he secretly contacts MRX, offering him valuable information: a database from BND's private servers, which he hacked while he was in the BND building, which impresses MRX. When the group arrives the next day, Benjamin is still furious and attacks Max, who responds by beating him up. However, Paul, watching the TV, hears on the news that one of the members of FR13NDS, nicknamed Krypton, was murdered. Benjamin admits that he gave the information from the BND to MRX, and after checking them, realizes that the information identified Krypton as a double agent working with Hanne to expose MRX and FR13NDS, and CLAY is now labeled as a terrorist group for hacking the information.\nSeeking to clear their name for the murder, Benjamin contacts MRX, who instructs them to hack into the Europol database in exchange for MRX's identity, giving them a hacking tool to help. After dissolving their hard drives in acid to erase data, they travel to Europol's headquarters in The Hague in order to try and break their way in\u2014but it's impossible to find a way inside.  The headquarters dump their trash in a secured building, the sewers are locked, and phishing attempts failed. However, while checking out the building, Benjamin notices a group of scholars visiting the building, and one of them drops his visitor card.  Using Max's advice about social engineering, Benjamin manages to gain access to the building by fooling a guard and plants a hacking device inside. He then hacks into the internal Europol servers and provides MRX with an entrance, secretly encoded inside a double trojan horse so MRX will be exposed when he tries to gain access. However, MRX, anticipating this, takes a snapshot of Benjamin via his webcam, exposing him. Benjamin is forced to flee when a group of Russian mobsters finds him; he evades them in the subway.\nBenjamin returns to the hotel where he was staying with the trio, only to find them murdered. Having no other choice and knowing that FRI3NDS would kill him, he decided to turn himself in to Hanne, proving that he is serious after stating that he hacked her profile and learned personal information about her. Hanne, who was suspended for her failure to capture them and is desperate to apprehend FRI3NDS and MRX, agrees to put Benjamin into a witness protection program in exchange for capturing them.  Benjamin logs in as MRX himself and spreads lies about MRX being a snitch, forcing the real MRX to force his way into the Darknet servers with unsafe methods, allowing Benjamin to expose him.  MRX is exposed as a 19-year-old American boy from New York City, whom the FBI arrests in a coffee shop.\nHowever, after agreeing to give Benjamin the witness exchange program, Hanne notices a wound going through his palm (the same wound that Max got after running a nail through his hand), and realizes that Max, Stephan and Paul are all made-up characters. Distraught, she visits Benjamin's doctor, who states that his mother had multiple personality disorder and committed suicide because of it, learning that it can be genetically inherited. Hanne connects various plot holes in Benjamin's story and realizes that \"he\" alone was CLAY; he committed all the atrocities, he hacked into the BND alone, and he planted the WWII bullets from his grandmother in the hotel to make it look like they were killed, imagining the trio due to his illness. Hanne confronts Benjamin, who has an emotional breakdown, as people with mental disorders cannot be given witness protection. However, Hanne changes her mind and allows him access to the witness protection program, revealed to be an \"actual\" program containing information about all citizens of Germany; Benjamin changes his identity here. Hanne, dropping Benjamin off, states that she let him go because he truly wants to stay invisible, and lets him go on the condition that he never hacks again.\nBenjamin, now sporting blonde hair, is standing alone on a  Scandlines ferry heading north. However, he is suddenly joined by Marie, Max, Stephan and Paul. In narration, Benjamin states that he performed \"the greatest social engineering hack\" ever; the scene shifts back to Benjamin going back to the hotel, finding the guys alive and well; he instructs them to flee since MRX knows his identity, but they refuse to leave him behind. After Marie visits them and confirms that mentally ill subjects cannot be granted witness protection, they devise a plan for Benjamin to go to Hanne and dictate the story, deliberately giving plot holes which she will most likely decipher, and then using her grief for him to give him access to the witness protection program, and also spiking his hand with a nail to make the story seem truthful. In the server room, it was revealed that Benjamin didn't change his identity, he \"erased\" it completely.

When their infant son is not allowed entry to the country without them, the family is forced to return to their ship named City of Justice. The parents break the display case containing a model of the ship and place their baby inside it on the water, then watch him float to the New York City shoreline. In 1916, the baby boy has grown up to become Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), a thief raised by a supernatural demon posing as the gangster Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). Peter is marked for death when he decides to leave Pearly's gang. In a confrontation, he is rescued by a mysterious (winged at times) white horse, his guardian angel.\nAlthough Peter hopes to move to Florida and come back in the summer, the horse encourages him to steal from one last mansion. The mansion is the home where Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) lives, a young woman dying of consumption, whose fever is so high she sleeps outside in a tent in the winter cold. While her publisher father Isaac (William Hurt) and younger sister Willa are not home, Beverly discovers Peter preparing to rob the house. When Peter assures her that he no longer wishes to commit robbery, Beverly offers to make him a cup of tea. They tell each other their stories and fall in love. Pearly orders his men to Beverly's home, believing that saving her is Peter's \"miracle\" and spiritual destiny and that he can destroy Peter by preventing it. Peter rescues Beverly from being knifed by Pearly, and they escape to the Lake of the Coheeries, where Pearly, who is supernaturally limited to the five boroughs of New York City, cannot follow. Peter meets Beverly's family at their summer home and wins their respect.\nWhile on a walk, Beverly explains to Peter that everyone is born with a miracle inside and they are ultimately destined to become stars when they die. Pearly asks Lucifer (Will Smith), for access to the lake home, but his request is denied. Instead, Pearly, who refers to himself as a Knight among Lucifer's angels, calls in a debt owed to him by another of Lucifer's angels. At a ball, the angel disguised as a waiter poisons Beverly's drink. When Peter and Beverly return home from the ball, Peter watches the shadows she casts upon the sides of her lighted tent, joins her, and the two make love. Her pulse races faster than ever due to the poison in her heart, and she dies. After the funeral, when Peter and his mysterious white horse return to the city, Pearly and his men surround them on the Brooklyn Bridge. To save its life, Peter orders his mysterious winged horse to fly away, and Pearly gives Peter five vicious head-butts, pushing him off the bridge.\nPeter miraculously survives but wanders around the city with amnesia for a century, drawing chalk art of a red-headed girl on the pavements.

He rediscovers the brass name plate of the \"City of Justice\", the model ship in which his parents placed him. Peter then discovers the Theatre of the Coheeries, founded by Isaac, who has dedicated it to Beverly. He visits the Isaac Penn Reading Room where Virginia works, and she helps him restore his memory using historical photographs archived at the library. While there, he meets Beverly's now elderly sister Willa (Eva Marie Saint), the owner of Virginia's newspaper, who recognizes him.\nWhen Peter visits the Gamelys for dinner, he learns that Abby has cancer. Realizing that Abby, who is wearing a red scarf (like his sketches) and has red hair, is his \"miracle\" and spiritual destiny, instead of Beverly as he originally believed, Peter convinces Virginia that he can save Abby. Pearly learns that Peter is still alive and with Virginia, and he is surprised to learn from Lucifer that Peter was Beverly's miracle, making him love her so much that he couldn't die. Enraged, Pearly asks to fight Peter as a mortal so he can destroy him forever, and Lucifer grants his request while reminding him that if he loses then he himself will be destroyed forever. Pearly and his men arrive at Virginia's apartment, causing Peter and Virginia to flee to the rooftop with Abby.

With no way out, the remaining mutants intentionally sacrifice themselves to buy Kitty enough time to send Bishop's consciousness a few days into the past to warn the others of the coming attack and ensure their survival.\nHaving averted the attack, the group retreats to a remote Chinese temple, where they are joined by Storm, Wolverine, Professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto. Xavier explains that the Sentinels were originally conceived by Bolivar Trask, a weapons designer whom Raven Darkh\u00f6lme assassinated in 1973. In response, government forces captured Raven and experimented on her, using her DNA to eventually create Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power. Xavier plans to go back in time and prevent Trask's assassination in hopes of altering the future, but since he would not live if he tried, Wolverine volunteers to go instead because his regenerative abilities would allow him to survive the trip.\nAwakening in his younger body in 1973, Wolverine goes to the X-Mansion, learning from Hank McCoy that the school has been closed for years due to the Vietnam War, and Lehnsherr (Magneto) being falsely arrested for assassinating JFK.

Nixon, Trask, and a disguised Raven retreat to the White House Bunker, but Lehnsherr rips the bunker out of the building with the intention of killing everyone inside. In 2023, the X-Men make their last stand as an onslaught of Sentinels attack the temple. Many mutants perish while trying to buy more time, with Magneto suffering severe injuries. In 1973, Raven reveals herself and subdues Lehnsherr with a plastic gun, saving Nixon and his cabinet. She attempts to kill Trask but Xavier telepathically convinces her to spare him, leading the public to believe that a mutant saved the president.

Before the three leave, they set fire to the bus, leaving Satya to his death. \nHowever, Dr. Sailaja saves Satya by transplanting a new face, which bring a new life, along with a new face and skin. 10 months later, Satya awakes from his coma, which shocks him as he has a different facial identity. Under the pseudonym as Ram, Satya returns to Visakhapatnam where he meets a model named Sruthi, whom Veeru likes. Befriending Sruthi, he takes advantage of his new unknown face, and lures Deva to a under-constructed apartment where Satya kills him with electric shock. A photo of Deva is discovered by ACP Ashok Varma, which has been marked as 1. \nSatya files a report on Deepthi with the police, stating that she has been missing for ten days. Since Sravan knows that Deepthi was killed ten months earlier, he becomes suspicious of Satya in his new persona, and follows him to a mall, where Satya kills him by hanging with a rope. During the investigation on Sravan's death, Satya presents himself to Varma as an eyewitness. When asked to provide a description of the killer, Satya describes his former face. Satya then manipulates Ajay to fall for Sruthi and gets the two of them to pose in compromising positions for some pics, under the pretense that they will be used as a promotion to assist Sruthi in getting an opportunity to audition for the female lead in a film. \nInstead, Satya sends copies of the pics to Veeru, in order to turn him against both Ajay and Sruthi. Satya then convinces Ajay that the only way to save Sruthi from Veeru's ire is to kill Veeru, which would also allow Ajay to gain his brother's position. However, Veeru's henchmen kill Ajay and Veeru gets killed by Satya after revealing himself. He apologizes to Sruthi for using her and departs from Visakhapatnam. On the way, a mysterious person named Raja attacks Satya, but is later killed. Suspecting that the attack might have something to do with his new face, Satya visits Dr. Sailaja. When they meet, Sailaja confesses that she has given Satya the face of her deceased son, Charan; she then goes on to explain the circumstances surrounding Charan's death. \nPast: Charan is a happy-go-lucky rich graduate who hangs out with his friends and girlfriend Manju. One of his friends, Shashank, questions the local don, Dharma, regarding his illegal acquisition of lands by exploiting the neighbourhood. Threatened, Dharma kills Shashank, after which Charan begins to raise support among the local population to revolt against Dharma. Again threatened, Dharma approaches another one of Charan's friends, Sharath, promising to establish his political career if he kills Charan. \nCharan and Sharath go to Visakhapatnam to attend a wedding. On their return, they board the same bus as Satya and Deepthi. When the bus was stopped, Sharath pulls a knife on Charan and the two engage in a fight. Veeru's men simultaneously enter the bus. Deepthi is killed inside the bus while Charan and Sharath's struggle has led them outside the bus, where Charan is stabbed to death. Charan's body is sent to Sailaja, who after observing Satya's urge to live decides to transplant her son's face onto Satya, rather than simple plastic surgery. Before Sailaja could inform Satya about Charan, Satya had left the hospital.\nPresent: Leaving Sailaja, Satya visits the neighbourhood, under the guise of Charan. After meeting the locals, he decides to avenge Charan's death. First, he meets Sharath in a political meeting and, using the shock of Charan seemingly being alive, makes him kill Dharma. Satya makes the slum people follow Sharath to Dharma's house. Sharath stabs Dharma, who in turn kills Sharath. However, the villagers followed by Satya, teamup and kills Dharma.
