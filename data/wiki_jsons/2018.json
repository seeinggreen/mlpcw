He reminisces about Chitti, his previous creation which was dismantled after an error Nila was built in response to.Shortly after, all the mobile phones in the city fly into the sky, throwing the public into a panic. A council assembles to discuss the phenomenon, in which Vaseegaran suggests reactivating Chitti. However, the plan is opposed by a member of the council, Dhinendra Bohra, whose father was killed by Chitti a few years back. But after the cell phones gather into a swarm and kill businessman Manoj Lulla, Telecom Minister Vairamurthy and cellphone showroom owner Jayanth Kumar, the now terrified Home Minister S. Vijay Kumar allows Vaseegaran to reactivate Chitti.\nAs the cell phone swarm causes chaos in the city in the form of a giant bird, a newly activated and upgraded Chitti arrives and battles the bird, during which Chitti runs out of battery and recharges between three antennas at a space station. The swarm tries to follow but is repelled by the antennas. Chitti informs Vaseegaran about this incident and confirms that the phones are powered by an aura, specifically a concentrated mass of negative charge with electromagnetic properties. Since the space station was streaming positive charged ions into space, the swarm was repelled. Vaseegaran builds a photon synthesizer that projects positive charge, tracks the cell phones along with Chitti and neutralises the charge of the bird. Defeated in the confrontation, the phones take up a humanoid form, as the deceased ornithologist Pakshi Rajan.\nChitti converses with Pakshi as he attempts to destroy the synthesizer, in which a flashback reveals that Pakshi protested against the usage of modern mobile phones, radiation from which caused mass deaths of birds, especially near his bird sanctuary and home in Thirukazhukundram. Pakshi tries to draw the attention of the public, but his protests are dismissed by the public who mock him. Birds all over the city including Pakshi's sanctuary die out, including newborn chicks. Even a court investigation finds no violations because of manipulation by the telecom companies, which drives him to suicide by hanging in a cell tower. Pakshi's negatively charged spirit reawakens by the radiation emitting from the tower. By absorbing the souls of the dead birds, he becomes a vengeful entity, promising to avenge the birds' deaths and change people's attitude towards birds and the environment.\nEmpathizing with Pakshi, Chitti tries to convince him not to hurt the public, especially the innocent ones, but Pakshi denies this stating no one is innocent, wishing to punish their ignorance. Left with no choice, Chitti has Pakshi captured and contained after much effort. Vaseegaran is congratulated by the country, and the news spreads to the council which decides to build an army of robots such as Chitti for the military. However, Dhinendra, angered by Chitti's victory, releases Pakshi's spirit from the synthesizer vehicle. Pakshi, now free and wanting to continue his mission ambushes and possesses Vaseegaran in his house, and attacks the public again. Chitti arrives with Nila to see chaos everywhere and confronts Vaseegaran, only to realise Pakshi has taken over his body. Chitti hesitates to attack Pakshi, as it would result in Vaseegaran dying as well, since his body is occupied by Pakshi. Taking advantage of this, Pakshi taunts and dismantles it. Pakshi flies off after Vaseegaran writes '2.0' for Nila to read on the scrap of a damaged car, seeing which she immediately goes to Vaseegaran's lab, reprograms Chitti to its 2.0 alter ego, and alters it to not harm the public and only to fight Pakshi.\nPakshi, now in Vaseegaran's form, goes to a football stadium with 80,000 people and traps them in it, and finding out that Dhinendra, who was present, uses his cell phone, incinerates him alive by focusing radiation from multiple cell towers, despite the fact that he freed him. Chitti arrives with a robot army and confronts Pakshi. Pakshi fails to taunt Chitti by using Vaseegaran because of the 2.0 version's hatred towards Vaseegaran. Both of them assume giant forms and fight each other. Initially Chitti gains the upper hand but Pakshi manages to overpower him and cause him to run out of charge. Pakshi assumes his winged form and creates several bird drones which tear Chitti's fellow robots into pieces, but before Pakshi can summon radiation and continue his plan, he gets interrupted by an action figure sized robot \"Kutti 3.0\" made by Chitti. Released into the stadium by Nila, the Kutti bots mount themselves on doves and threaten to fly them into Pakshi's radiation beam, forcing Pakshi to stand down till the Kuttis self-destruct and destroy Pakshi's drones. After Vaseegaran is released from Pakshi's possession, Pakshi is led to the space station where it is destroyed.\nVaseegaran recovers in the hospital and tells Vijay Kumar that he feels Pakshi was a virtuous person who became a victim of the corrupt society. He suggests they reduce and control cell phone radiation to ensure that technology does not threaten living beings. Vijay Kumar promises to get this passed in the next Parliament hearing. Chitti, now restored to its original version, begins a relationship with Nila as they and the other robots go to report at the Delhi headquarters.\nIn a post-credits scene, Sana asks Vaseegaran over the phone about the odds of mobile phones flying again. Immediately, Vaseegaran's mobile flies out of his hand and morphs into Kutti 3.0, saying, \"I am your grandson\".", "tmdb_id": 373449}, "58443317": {"title": "2nd Half", "plot": "The story talks about the life of a woman police constable Anuradha (Priyanka Upendra) who assigned to the police CCTV control room.

After being briefed and evaluated by COL Mulholland, Commander of 5th Special Forces Group, Nelson and 595 are picked to fight alongside Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum.\nODA 595 is inserted covertly in Afghanistan aboard Boeing CH-47 Chinook flown by 160th SOAR on October 19, 2001. They land 40 miles south of Mazar-i-Sharif, the country's fourth-largest city and a longtime stronghold of the Taliban, where they meet Dostum. Six of the 12 members, led by Nelson, leave with Dostum to the mountains, while the other six remain in a fortified camp nicknamed \"The Alamo\" under Spencer's command. Dostum is attempting to capture the northern Afghanistan city, while battling Taliban leader Mullah Razzan, who rules local communities brutally under strict law of Sharia, and has murdered several people, including Dostum's family. Although the warlord is initially skeptical of Nelson's abilities, Nelson gradually earns Dostum's respect. In one battle, however, Dostum makes a tactical error, costing several casualties. Nelson accuses Dostum of acting carelessly with the lives of his men and of withholding valuable information, while Dostum retorts that he still feels that Nelson, and the U.S. are not willing to pay the potential price of the conflict, and tells Nelson that he needs to use his heart and mind to \"be a warrior\" instead of a soldier. The two eventually reconcile, and, after splitting off a three-man element under SFC Sam Diller to strike a Taliban supply route, and being joined by Spencer's half of ODA 595, continue to work together. They win several victories with Dostum's leadership and manpower and American airpower, making significant progress towards Mazar-i Sharif. When Nelson informs Dostum that another ODA, 555, has been dispatched to support Atta Muhammad, another Northern Alliance leader, who is Dostum's political rival, Dostum is furious, and his men promptly abandon 595.\nFollowing Dostum's departure, Nelson plans to continue operating against the Taliban with his Americans and the few Afghan fighters remaining with them. Encountering a large force of Al-Qaeda and Taliban fighters and armored vehicles, ODA 595, rejoined by Diller and his element, uses air support to eliminate many of the fighters and most of the armor, but are discovered and attacked. Spencer is critically injured by a suicide bomber, and the team is about to be overrun under heavy Taliban and Al-Qaeda pressure when Dostum returns with his forces. Carrying out the U.S. Army's first cavalry charge of the 21st century, the American and Northern Alliance forces disperse the Taliban and al-Qaeda, and Dostum tracks down and kills Razzan. After Spencer is medevaced, Nelson and Dostum continue to Mazar-i-Sharif but find Atta Muhammad has beaten them there. Against expectations, Dostum leaves any differences with Muhammad to be settled the next day. Impressed by Nelson and the Americans' efforts, Dostum gives Nelson his prized riding crop and tells him that he will always consider Nelson a brother and fellow fighter, at the same time bidding him remember that Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires. Spencer ultimately survives, and all 12 soldiers of ODA 595 return home after 23 days of almost continuous fighting in Afghanistan.\nThe film's penultimate moment shows a photo of the Horse Soldier Statue at the World Trade Center in New York City, based on the soldiers of ODA 595 and their victory in the early stages of the response to the September 11 attacks, dedicated to all United States Special Forces.

Spencer and Alek are from single-mother homes, and their mothers often stick up for them when called to the principal's office regarding their misconduct.\nWhile working part time at a smoothie shop, Spencer waits on a recruiter for the United States Marine Corps. He asks the recruiter what military branch he would select if he could go back. The recruiter replies that the Air Force pararescue save lives and \"seem to being doing fine work in the field.\" Spencer is intrigued and decides that he wants to join up, so he begins working out to lose weight. After several months of rigorous training and exercise, he gets into better shape and enlists in the Air Force in hopes of becoming a Pararescueman.\nUpon completing basic training, Spencer takes his exams to qualify for pararescue school but is turned down due to having poor depth perception. Upset, he chooses from the other Air Force options left to him, and is soon stationed abroad. Alek enlisted in the National Guard, and has been deployed to Afghanistan. On Skype, Alek tells him that he is planning to visit his girlfriend in Germany, and the two decide to rendezvous there for their next leave. Spencer skypes Anthony, now a college student, and talks him into coming to Europe for a vacation, starting in Italy. Next, the three meet in Germany and decide to go to Amsterdam. After a few days there, they finally decide to visit France. They depart from Amsterdam Centraal station on the 15:17 train to Paris.\nOn the train, all seems well, until American-born Frenchman Mark Moogalian notices that one of the toilets has been occupied for an unusually long time. When he goes to investigate, a terrorist bursts out with an assault rifle. Another passenger, Damien A., grabs the terrorist by the neck and Moogalian manages to wrest the rifle from the terrorist but is then shot in the back with a 9mm pistol. Passengers begin to flee out of their seats and rush toward the forward cabins of the train, trying to escape. Eventually, the terrorist approaches the next car, where Spencer and his friends are sitting. The moment Spencer sees him, he springs into action. He decides that his only hope, and the only hope of the remaining passengers, is for him to try to defeat the terrorist. Spencer makes a desperate all-out sprint toward the terrorist in the hope of subduing him before being shot. By remarkable luck, the terrorist's weapon jams just as he is about to fire, and Spencer tackles and disarms him. Seeing Spencer's progress in subduing the terrorist, Alek, Anthony, and other passengers join the effort to try to overwhelm the terrorist. Spencer finally knocks him out by putting him in a choke hold. Spencer then stanches the bleeding by plugging the exit wound in Moogalian's neck with his fingers. The police at the next station enter the train fully armed, discovering that Spencer has subdued the terrorist, and the paramedics begin to treat his wounds and the more serious ones of the shot passenger. Paramedics take Moogalian to the emergency room at a local hospital and he survives.\nIn a formal ceremony, Spencer, Alek and Anthony are recognized as heroes of France for their gallantry and bravery by the President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who tells the public that the terrorist was armed with over 300 rounds of ammunition with the apparent aim of using all of it to wreak havoc on all those who boarded the train. The odds of the particular misfire and jam of the cartridge in the terrorist's weapon was estimated on the scene as being less than one out of a thousand, and highly unlikely to have been in Spencer's favor.

One day there is a party, and during that party the Father In Law and Dilip make a plan to get Dilip's passport so he can go to India. Eliza finds out and Dilip says the whole family will go to India with me. Just before the flight, the neighbour's daughter asks Lavi for something from India. Lavi says I will give you an 'Aate Di Chidi' (bird made from dough in Punjabi), because the other day Dilip told Lavi how an Aate Di Chidi was the best thing you could get from a Punjabi childhood.\nThe family arrive in India and Dilip sees things have changed. Dancing at funerals, the impact of social media and much more. Dilip complains that the village sign has the village name written in three languages, and Punjabi is at the bottom. Dilip's other son, \n(Karamjit Anmol) married a woman from Bihar. Vikram and Eliza want to go and see the city nearby but Lavi says he wants to see the village, due to which Dilip becomes really impressed.

The family go to Dilip's friend's wedding, wearing traditional Punjabi clothing. At the wedding venue, the guard stops them thinking they are dancers. A man who is leading the wedding sees Eliza, thinking she is a dancer and calls her in. Eliza and her family sees they are dancing on the stage with guns in their hands and alcohol. Seeing the guns, Eliza dances in fear. After the wedding, Eliza becomes angry at Dilip because Eliza believes Punjab isn't as good as Dilip said to be. Some days later, the family go to Vikram's co-worker's house so that they can receive the money. The co-worker's parents become happy because they can now become financially stable again. However, their spoilt son who lives in Punjab starts arguing with them due to which a huge fight takes place and Dilip's turban falls off.\nDilip then accepts the horrible truth about Punjab and India- it has changed. Eliza then regrets the fact that she tried to prevent her son learning about Punjabi culture. The village sign also then has the name written at Punjabi at the top, telling people that your mother language is the most important. Just before the flight to Canada, Lavi tries to find an 'Aate Di Chidi' as he promised his neighbour's daughter he will get one. He couldn't find it. In Canada, Eliza gives Lavi and the neighbour's daughter an 'Aate Di Chidi', meaning that you can gain knowledge about your culture in other countries as well.", "tmdb_id": 564354}, "57135922": {"title": "Abar Basanta Bilap", "plot": "Badur Bagan is a locality in North Kolkata.

He confronts Abhijith, a boy whose mobile phone was active near the crime scene, and the boy's friends Christy, Bhuvan, and Deepak. The boys reveal that they committed murders of several other girls, avoiding the consequences due to their parents' privilege, being the sons of a prominent businessman, the District Collector of Chennai city, a gold merchant, and a well-known scientist.

Though initially reluctant to undertake a private investigation, Christie goes undercover while the nation searches for her whereabouts.\nCalling herself Mary Westmacott (an early Christie pseudonym), she gathers all the suspects in the attack in a country house under the pretext of determining their share of a large inheritance from a fictitious American businessman, with herself as the representative of a law firm and Mabel acting as housekeeper and cook.  The suspects include Daphne Miller, a young woman whose nursing career Florence could have ruined if she had lived; Randolph, Florence's cousin who inherited her money; Zaki Hanachi, a French soldier of Algerian ancestry whom she helped recover after the war and who may have been asking her for money; Travis Pickford, a boxer and black marketer who was interviewed by the police; and Mrs. Pamela Rose, the woman Florence was travelling to see.

Soon he is approached by a businessman, Amirchand Mittal, who offers him 10 lakh rupees in exchange of the sword. Somnath declines the offer. Amirchand is followed by a police officer, who in turn is killed by the businessman's goons. Unfortunately, Somnath becomes the unwitting eye-witness of the murder. The goons follow him and shoot at him, but he escapes, only to be run over by a car in the highway.\nIn the present day, Soham and Brishti are taking a tour of Kolkata, while Soham explains its histories. He is interested in a historical research of Bengal and Kolkata, to which end Brishti recommends him to her father Ashutosh Singha, a renowned historian and author of Banglar Ayna, a book on Bengal's history, for a scholarship. Ashutosh is being interviewed by Jahnabi, an independent documentary film maker, but his mind is disturbed. He is being sent a number of unnamed chits, each stating the circumstances in which the conspirators against Siraj ud-Daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, died. Brishti brushes these off as pranks, but Soham deduces that it has something to do with her father's book. Soham is introduced to Ashutosh at the latter's house, and Ashutosh agrees upon granting Soham the scholarship, and requests him to stay at his house only. Soham is introduced to Sakkhi Gopal, the caretaker of the house and a distant relative of Ashutosh.\nAshutosh tells Soham about his friend Somnath, who was killed in a road accident 27 years ago. Interestingly, Somnath was also a student of Bengal's history. Just before his death, he had told Ashutosh about a gift he wished to send him, but due to its unprecedented historical value, he has hidden it somewhere, the clue to which he had sent to Ashutosh in a letter. Soham is immediately interested in the riddle, which hints at a particular house and Warren Hastings' court case against Maharaja Nandakumar. With a little help from an old priest, Soham cracks the riddle, which leads him and Brishti to the house of Somnath's professor, also named Nandakumar. The professor, now almost blind due to old age, reveals that Somnath had sent him a letter as well, including a second riddle, telling him to give it to the person who comes to his house after solving the first riddle. The second letter says something about Dinabandhu Mitra's Neel Darpan, its translation to English by Michael Madhusudan Dutt, and the arrest of Reverend James Long for publishing the same (the British Government had declared the play as seditious). Meanwhile, Brishti's brother Abhiraj, a spoilt brat, has huge loans from Amirchand, who tells him to deliver a nose-ring, belonging to the family deity, which is a prized possession of the family.\nSoham and Brishti's quest brings them to James Long Sarani, where the owner of one \"Dinabandhu Mistanna Bhandar\" (sweet shop) performs the act of burying a ledikeni sweet in the ground. He reveals that his father, the previous owner of the shop, knew Somnath well, and was told by him to do this in front of the person who solved the second riddle. Soham deduces that burying a ledikeni stands for the grave of Lady Canning in Barrackpore, since the sweet was specially made on the occasion of her arrival in India. Soham and Brishti travel there, and find a gardener whom Somnath knew and had also given a riddle. The gardener was about to tell Soham how he seemed to be related to Somnath, when suddenly he is shot dead. Brishti and Soham escape with the letter. Brishti suddenly sees Jahnabi, who she had previously spotted following them while entering Nandakumar's house.\nAfter solving the clue from the third letter, the duo travel to a lock-maker's shop called Black Pagoda, in North Kolkata, which was cryptically hinted at in the gardener's letter. Soham learns that Somnath had ordered for a specific lock from the current owner's father, the previous owner. The lock had a number combination system, made break-proof by the fact that anyone entering a wrong combination would be injured by gunpowder blast, incorporated in the lock itself. The owner delivers the next clue to them via a telephone call with his father, which hints at going to Old Mission Church, where Madhusudan Dutt was converted to Christianity. The Father of the church gives Soham another letter, but just as he was about to tell him more about Somnath, he is shot dead, much like the gardener in Barrackpore. Meanwhile, the nose-ring of the Singha family's deity gets stolen by Abhiraj. Amirchand, however, is furious with Abhiraj for delivering him a fake.\nA throwaway sentence by Sakkhi Gopal strikes Soham when he understands that Sakkhi knew Somnath very well. He urges Sakkhi to tell him the real identity of Somnath. The next morning Brishti finds Soham visibly disturbed. He reveals that the letter from the Father hinted at going to a Kali temple in Central Kolkata, where the last riddle was to be found. Soham had already been there and had also solved the riddle, which takes him to Bagbajar library's north east corner, where the specially made gunpowder locker was found behind a photograph of Ramprasad Sen. Soham and the librarian open the locker with the numbers found at the end of every letter. They find a final riddle along with a map; however, they are ambushed by Amirchand and his goons, who were following Soham. In the ensuing clash, the librarian is killed and the map and the riddle stolen by Amirchand, who finalizes selling the gift to a foreign buyer for 35 crore rupees.\nBack at the Singha family household, Abhiraj beats up Sakkhi's son, a drunkard, for stealing the original nose-ring, which he continuously denies. Ashutosh watches the whole drama silently, even as Sakkhi begs him to stop Abhiraj. Brishti is upset with her father not protesting Abhiraj's misconduct, to which Ashutosh reveals that he knows about Abhiraj stealing the nose-ring, shown to him by Jahnabi on her camera. Sensing that Abhiraj might do something like this to have something to mortgage to Amirchand, she had replaced the original with a fake. However, Sakkhi had had enough of Ashutosh, and reveals everything to Brishti about how her father's aristocratic lifestyle led him to mortgage everything, even the house itself, to Amirchand. The latter had agreed to waive off Ashutosh's loans if he delivered him the gift Somnath told Ashutosh about. While witnessing the murder of the police officer at the hands of Amirchand, Somnath had also spotted Ashutosh, who was present right beside Amirchand at that moment, revealing his betrayal. Sakkhi went on to reveal the real identity of Soham\u2014 he is the son of Somnath. Brishti and Abhiraj are both upset by this revelation about their father and leaves the room. Sakkhi then hands Ashutosh the final chit, stating the circumstances of Mir Jafar's death, the prime conspirator against Siraj ud-Daulah, thus revealing that the chits were being sent by him all along.\nBrishti finds Soham in the library, and together they head for Murshidabad, where the gift was located. Soham remembers how the last riddle hinted at Khoshbagh, the final resting place of Siraj ud-Daulah, who had renamed Kolkata to Alinagar when he had captured Fort William from the British. The riddle also hinted at Katra mosque to be where the gift is to be found. Unfortunately, by the time they solve the riddle and reach Katra mosque, Amirchand and his goons are already there, digging. Soham and Brishti are apprehended by the goons, while Amirchand ignores Soham's warning about not to touch the gift, as told by the riddle. The gift is revealed to be the same sword that Somnath had bought from the auction in 1990. The sword actually belonged to Siraj ud-Daulah, which was gifted to him by the French traders as a sign of their alliance, hence its unprecedented historical value. As soon as Amirchand touches it, an electric shock stuns him and knocks him out. It is then revealed that Somnath had carefully placed the sword upon a high voltage wire supplying electricity to the whole of Murshidabad and Berhampore, to keep it from wrong people who choose to ignore the warnings in the riddle. Soham and Brishti are saved by Jahnabi, who reveals herself as a CID officer, investigating the 1990 murder case, and also the daughter of the murdered police officer.\nIn the end, Ashutosh is arrested for being an accomplice in the crime, and the sword itself is given to the museum for safekeeping, now that Amirchand has been apprehended. Ashutosh reveals to Soham that in Somnath's absence, he printed and published Somnath's original manuscript of Banglar Ayna in his own name, linking the chits to this act of betrayal. Ashutosh is taken away while Soham turns around to see a metaphorical glimpse of his father.", "tmdb_id": 615147}, "55981873": {"title": "All About Nina", "plot": "Stand-up comedian Nina Geld is all good on stage but has bad personal life.

Shakespeare and Anne have a distant relationship, as he has spent most of their marriage working in London, and she is a down-to-earth country woman who cannot read or write. Their marriage has never recovered from the death of their son Hamnet, aged 11, in an outbreak of plague in Stratford while his father was in London. While they also have two daughters, Hamnet was Shakespeare\u2019s favourite child, especially because of the poems which he believes the child wrote. Shakespeare now devotes his time to tending to the family garden. In spite of his hard work he is not very successful.\nThe Shakespeares' elder daughter Susanna is married to a doctor named John Hall, who is a prominent Puritan in town. Susanna has to stifle her independence and her own personality to live by her husband's moral codes. She is accused of committing adultery, and faces a public trial. Shakespeare terrifies her accuser by claiming that he knows an African actor who was once in love with Susanna, and who would kill anyone who ruined her good name. The accuser fails to attend the hearing, as a consequence of which Susanna is acquitted. Anne is impressed by her husband's actions, especially as she knows that he was lying: the African actor was a gentle person who would never harm anyone.\nShakespeare's younger daughter, Judith (Hamnet's twin), is outspoken in her doubts about the role of women in Jacobean England. She has not been allowed to have an education or opportunities in life, because it is expected she will marry and provide children. She has refused to marry, and is bitter at her father for not loving her as much as her dead brother. One night during an argument, Judith confesses to Shakespeare that it was she who wrote the poems, rather than her brother. They were in Hamnet's handwriting because Judith cannot read or write, and dictated them to him. Anne agrees that Hamnet was not especially intelligent; they have hidden this from Shakespeare so he would be able to keep his fond memories.\nThe Shakespeares receive a visit from the Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare's former literary patron, to whom he wrote his 154 sonnets. This upsets Anne; she is aware of rumours that her husband and Southampton were lovers. While drinking with Southampton, Shakespeare recites his Sonnet 29, expressing his feelings for Southampton and hoping that Southampton felt the same way about him. Southampton cuts off the conversation, and seems uncomfortable, but as he leaves he also recites Sonnet 29, indicating to Shakespeare that he did have feelings for him.\nAfter some time at home, Shakespeare and Anne grow closer and develop a mature relationship. Anne ultimately allows her husband to sleep with her in the family's second-best bed (the best bed is reserved for guests). Having fallen back in love with Anne, Shakespeare amends his will to make sure that she will receive this bed. Now that the truth has been told about the poems, Judith also develops a warmer relationship with her father. She agrees to marry a local man, Thomas Quiney, who has been her suitor for some time. However Quiney's reputation is damaged when his former sweetheart gives birth to his illegitimate child, and the baby and mother die during labour. Judith becomes pregnant by Quiney, much to Shakespeare's delight.\nWhile researching, Shakespeare discovers that there was no notable plague outbreak in 1596, the year that Hamnet died. He becomes suspicious and questions his family. Anne tries to convince him that Hamnet died of plague, but Judith confesses the truth. One day as a child, Judith told her brother that she was going to reveal the truth to their father, that Hamnet did not write the poems. That night, Hamnet went missing. He was found in a nearby pond, having drowned, with the copies of the poems in the water with him. Hamnet would never normally enter the pond, and so Anne and Judith suspect he committed suicide. The women covered it up, and told everyone that the boy had died of plague. Although it is an emotional revelation, the truth allows Shakespeare to finally come to terms with his son's death, and to accept a more honest memory of the boy.\nIn April 1616 Shakespeare's fellow playwright Ben Jonson visits him and they reminisce about their lives. On the 23rd of April, Shakespeare's fifty-second birthday, he is feeling unwell. His wife and daughters gather to present him with a surprise. Susanna has been teaching Anne and Judith how to read and write. Susanna has found the Shakespeares' marriage certificate, and Anne finally signs her name, where previously she had only been able to sign with an \"X\".\nShakespeare dies that day.

His wife Rho worries that Keda is not ready, but Tau believes he is and the hunters set out.\nTau tests Keda by having him kill a wild boar they've caught, but Keda hesitates. One night, the party's fire draws the attention of a large cave lion, which lunges through their circle, snatching Kappa before anyone can do anything. Hearing the fatal struggle in the darkness, the tribe gives him up for dead. Kappa is given a memorial service in the form of a cairn to symbolize the passing of one's spirit to the afterlife.\nThe hunters eventually reach a herd of steppe bison, which they attempt to stampede off a cliff with relative success. Amidst the chaos, the bull rushes towards Keda and tosses him over the edge, leaving him gripping the rough cliff edge with his hand. Keda loses his grip and plummets to a further ledge where he appears to break his leg and is knocked unconscious. Tau attempts to climb down to him, but he is stopped by fellow hunter Sigma who assures him in good faith that Keda is dead and there would be no way to reach him anyway. The tribe leaves and Tau performs another funeral ritual, stricken with grief.\nKeda is awoken by a vulture who mistakes him for dead.

Seeing the memorial cairn left by his tribe, he realizes he must travel back to the village by himself.\nKeda is later attacked and chased by a pack of ferocious wolves, but escapes up a tree and wounds one of the pack members which the others leave behind. Keda takes pity on it and cares for its injury. Gradually gaining the wolf's trust, he gives it water and then food, establishing himself as dominant by feeding himself first. He sets out for the village without the wolf, but it follows him. Their relationship grows, and they learn to hunt animals together. Along the way, Keda names the wolf Alpha.\nOne night, they are approached menacingly by a pack of wolves. Upon seeing Alpha, who steps forward to greet them, they recognize Keda's companion. The pack run off and with Keda's blessing, Alpha joins them. Keda continues his journey alone as the season changes into winter. On a frozen lake, he encounters a pack of wolves feeding on a carcass. Recognizing Alpha, he runs to them, but the ice breaks and he falls through. Alpha helps rescue him and they are reunited.\nContinuing the journey together, they find a man who has frozen to death outside his tent and scavenge a bow and arrow from it. Later, they take refuge from a pack of cave hyenas inside a cave. However, inside they are confronted and attacked by another cave lion, causing Alpha to violently fight the animal.

While Edwin is more sensitive and quiet, Flake is impulsive and explosive emotionally. There is extreme pressure on both of them, with faculty members and their own parents making assumptions that they are the ones at fault. In truth, the boys are both being bullied and the \"fights\" are one-sided. Edwin's parents, his father in particular, generally dismiss every remark he makes as petty teenage angst, and only start showing concern when the vice principal of the school invites them for a meeting. During an afterschool hangout at Flake's home, he shows Edwin his father's gun collection, floats the idea to shoot up their school, and Edwin reluctantly agrees out of loyalty to his childhood friend.\nWhile developing the plan, Edwin's artistic ability is noticed by his art teacher, who later encourages him to join an art project to enter a competition. He is approached by two classmate girls who tell him they heard that he had art skills and they wanted him on their team, which he reacts to with a small smile, though Flake, by his side, mocks the girls. Edwin appears to gain self esteem incrementally in the process. However, this whole time, Flake hasn't given up on their \"project,\" and the two are still being targeted for bullying. One afternoon there is a fight between Edwin and Flake at Flake's house which ends up with Edwin bloodied and crying at home. During the period of non-contact afterward, there is visible improvement in Edwin's mood and mental wellbeing. One evening, a man and his son are playing in a field while Edwin watches. Edwin politely asks for them to stop because the boy has Gus's beloved toy ball, but they keep walking, so in a moment of frustration, Edwin curses. The man becomes unreasonably aggressive and shoves Edwin to the ground, and they leave with Gus's ball. This affects Edwin profoundly, and he leans farther toward a mentality of seeking retribution. Flake and Edwin later make up and continue to develop their scheme. At a convenience store, they run into a younger acquaintance named Herman, who is also a target for bullying in the seventh grade for another seventh grader named Budzinski. When Flake unsuccessfully threatens Budzinski to stop, Budzinski targets Herman even more. Sporting a black eye, Herman sullenly tells Edwin, \"Someone's got to do something,\" and voices that he wants to get a gun. This worries Edwin. Flake insists on letting Herman in on the plan.\nAs the day of the school assembly nears, Edwin's father's birthday is approaching as well. In an effort to connect with her son, Edwin's mother plans a family trip to the lake with a sailboat they used to take for outings. When Edwin hears this will be on the day of the shooting, he is struck with inner turmoil, but Flake threatens him not to back out of the plan. The night before the assembly, Edwin quietly watches over his younger brother, Gus, who he is very fond of, and later on that night goes to the school with Flake to block off the majority of the school doors and store their weapons in their lockers. That morning, he wishes his father good luck on his lecture and receives a reminder from his mother about the lake trip. At school, Flake gives him a quick run-down of their plan again, and urges Edwin to stick to it. Edwin is to go into the bathroom while the students filter into the gym for the assembly, get the duffel with guns, and then head into the gym with Flake. Flake shoots his classmates without hesitation, sending the audience frantically running. Edwin cannot bring himself to raise his gun, however, and Flake is killed by the police while struggling to reload his rifle.\nThe ending shows a flashback of Edwin and his family at the previously mentioned lake, with voiceover of Edwin relating a story about their having towed another boat to shore.

He tells the terrorists that he must leave immediately, as he is an Egyptian diplomat who cannot be discovered at the place of the attack, while the insurgents aim the launcher at a commercial airliner that is heading to Israel.\nThree years earlier, in 1970, Ashraf lives and studies in London with his wife, Mona, the daughter of Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and their son. Ashraf disagrees with Nasser on how to proceed in the Israeli conflict and suggests that Nasser prevent further bloodshed and try a diplomatic solution with Israel, with the US as a peace-broker. However, Nasser and his men fear this will lose them the support of the USSR. Realising the USSR is on its last legs, Ashraf insists Egypt cuts its ties with the Soviets. Nasser rebukes Ashraf, and afterwards urges Mona to divorce her husband, which Ashraf overhears.\nAngry and embarrassed, Ashraf is further humiliated when he finds out that Nasser, on whom they are financially dependent, is having him followed when he goes out with friends, causing Mona to worry that Ashraf is having an affair with actress Diana Ellis. Frustrated, Ashraf decides to call the Israeli Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Michael Comay, to share important information. When the embassy refuses to connect him to Comay, Ashraf hangs up.\nSoon after, President Nasser dies of a heart attack, and Ashraf and his family are recalled to Cairo. Vice President Anwar Sadat becomes the next president of Egypt. Ashraf wins Sadat's trust by uncovering high-level corruption within the Egyptian government, and slowly begins to climb the political ladder, eventually becoming an important political player in Egypt. His family life suffers from his political career although Ashraf finds time to read his son a bed-time story, The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\nBack in London, Mossad agents finally reach out to Ashraf, playing him a recording of his previous call to the Israeli embassy. Ashraf meets his Mossad handler, Alex, and begins to sell his country's secrets to the Israeli government. The information that Ashraf provides is initially reliable and Alex and Ashraf develop a mutual rapport, with Ashraf being codenamed \"the angel.\" Eventually, however, Ashraf warns the Israelis on two occasions that Egypt will launch a military invasion, which never comes to pass. This puts a severe strain on his relationship with Mossad, who start doubting Ashraf's trustworthiness.\nWhen Israel shoots down a Libyan commercial plane filled with civilians, Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi wants vengeance, but Sadat is not willing to attack civilians. Knowing it will anger Gaddafi and the other Arab nations if Egypt does not support Libya, Ashraf comes up with a ploy to stabilize the situation. He goes to Gaddafi to pledge Egypt's support but makes sure that their retaliatory attack is not successful.\nBack at Rome International Airport on September 3, 1973, Ashraf removes a pin from the missile launcher before giving it to the terrorists, making it ineffective. When the Israeli commercial airliner takes off, the launcher does not fire. Italian authorities, having been notified about the terrorists by Ashraf, apprehend them.\nHaving regained Mossad's trust, Ashraf informs Alex and Mossad chief Zvi Zamir about an imminent Egyptian invasion of Israel on Yom Kippur. However, Israel dismisses the warning as yet another false alarm, like the previous two warnings. It is then revealed that this was Ashraf's plan all along, inspired by the fable of the Boy Who Cried Wolf. Realizing that peace could only be achieved through diplomacy, not war, but also realizing Israel would not agree to peace talks while they had the military upper hand, Ashraf decided to pave the way for a short but successful surprise attack on Israel. A military stalemate between Israel and Egypt ensues in the Yom Kippur War, peace talks begin and the two countries finally broker a peace treaty which heralds a period of lasting peace and sees both Sadat and Menachem Begin receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

Her job involves working as a \"Mimarobe\" within the Mima, an artificial intelligence designed to evoke viewers' experiences of Earth's lush, verdant past through a totally immersive virtual-reality experience that taps into participants' memories and emotions.\nIn the first week of Aniara's voyage, the ship suddenly veers off course to avoid a collision with space debris. Some of the debris pierces the hull and hits the ship's nuclear reactor, setting off an imminent meltdown and forcing the crew to eject all the ship's fuel. This results in the ship having no navigational control, no propulsion, and thus no ability to resume its original course. Captain Chefone promises the passengers and crew that they will be able to resume the trip to Mars once the ship passes a celestial body, which should happen in no more than two years. The Mimarobe's roommate, the ship's astronomer, later reveals to her that this is a lie and that there is no possibility of resuming their course.\nOn board, the Mimarobe finds her usually unimportant job becoming more popular and necessary than ever, as passengers crave the Mima to soothe them from claustrophobia and panic attacks. After three years the Mima becomes one of the most important functions necessary to keep calm on board the ship. With so many people bringing their horrific memories of Earth's destruction to the Mima, it becomes overwhelmed and self-destructs, committing suicide. Though the Mimarobe had asked the captain for a month of rest for the Mima, she is blamed for the machine's malfunction and imprisoned.\nBy the fourth year, cults have developed, and suicides lead the Mimarobe and Isagel, a former pilot, who is now the Mimarobe's lover, to be granted releases and reassigned to work. The Mimarobe and Isagel join a fertility cult dedicated to Mima, which leaves Isagel pregnant after an orgy. She suffers from depression during her pregnancy and is tempted to end the child's life after it is born. The Mimarobe wants to build a \"beam-screen\", a projection device acting as a mimic of Mima to alleviate Isagel's depression, while Captain Chefone forbids her from doing so and orders her to focus on educating children in the hopes that one or more of them might be able to discover a way to return them to Mars.\nIn the fifth year, the ship's astronomer and Isagel discover that a probe large enough to possibly contain fuel is travelling towards the Aniara, meaning that a rescue is possibly being attempted. The probe takes over a year to reach the Aniara, and upon being brought onto the ship in the sixth year, the crew quickly realize that they are unable to identify it, its origins or whether it contains fuel. While the captain orders the crew to keep working on the probe, they eventually lose hope of it being a means of rescue. The Astronomer laments that their ship is a sarcophagus, defying Captain Chefone's orders for the crew to keep a united front to prevent the passengers from losing hope. In a fit of rage, Captain Chefone shoots a taser at the Astronomer, which kills her.\nThe Mimarobe begins work on her projection device, eventually succeeding in projecting a waterfall onto the dark windows of the spaceship. Having succeeded, she learns that Isagel has committed suicide and has also killed the child they were raising together. Five years later, the few remaining crew celebrate the 10th anniversary of their voyage into space. While listlessly accepting an honorary medal from Captain Chefone for her creation of the beam-screen, the Mimarobe notices that his wrists are bandaged from a presumed suicide attempt. The algae tanks the passengers rely on for food and water have become contaminated. In year 24 of the voyage, a few remaining survivors, including the Mimarobe, sit cross-legged in a dimly lit room.

They believe Pym's wife Janet van Dyne might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the Quantum Realm, Lang had unknowingly become quantumly entangled with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.\nWith only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet, despite the strained relationship they have because of Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a large ant with Lang's ankle-monitor on as a decoy so as not to arouse the suspicions of FBI agent Jimmy Woo. Believing the message from Janet is confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the Quantum Realm and retrieve her. They arrange to buy a part needed for the tunnel from black-market dealer Sonny Burch, but Burch realizes the potential profit to be made from Pym's research and double-crosses them. Donning the Wasp outfit, Hope fights off Burch and his men until she is attacked by a quantumly unstable masked woman. Lang tries to help fight off this \"ghost\", but the woman escapes with Pym's lab, which has been shrunk down to the size of a suitcase.\nPym reluctantly takes Hope and Lang to visit his estranged former partner Bill Foster, who gives them a way to locate the lab. After they find it, the ghost captures the trio and reveals herself to be Ava Starr. Her father, Elihas, was another of Pym's former partners who died along with his wife during an experiment that caused her unstable state. Foster enters and reveals that Ava is dying and in constant pain as a result of her condition. They plan to cure her using Janet's quantum energy. Believing that this will kill Janet, Pym refuses to help them and escapes with Hope, Lang, and the lab.\nOpening a stable version of the tunnel, Pym, Hope, and Lang are able to contact Janet, who gives them a precise location to find her but warns that they only have two hours before the unstable nature of the Quantum Realm separates them for a century. Using a truth serum, Burch learns the trio's location from Lang's business partners Luis, Dave, and Kurt, and informs a contact at the FBI. Luis warns Lang, who rushes home before Woo can see that he is violating his house arrest. Pym and Hope are arrested by the FBI, allowing Ava to take the lab.\nLang is soon able to help Pym and Hope escape custody, and they find the lab. Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the Quantum Realm to retrieve Janet, whom he finds alive. Meanwhile, Lang and Hope are confronted by Burch and his men, and following a lengthy chase across San Francisco, Ava regains control of the lab, allowing her to begin taking Janet's energy by force. Luis, Dave, and Kurt incapacitate Burch and his men so that Lang and Hope can stop Ava. Pym and Janet return safely from the Quantum Realm, and Janet voluntarily gives some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her. Lang returns home once again, in time for a now-suspicious Woo to release him at the end of his house arrest.

Investigators later determine that audience members set the fire themselves. The film again goes unseen for many years until it is screened in a theater in California in 1993. Prior to the film, a concession stand worker doses popcorn with LSD; the combination of the drug and the film results in a riot during which a pregnant woman is killed. Following this screening, all copies of the film apparently vanish, and it earns a reputation as being cursed.\nIn 2018, a copy of Antrum surfaces, prompting a documentary crew to make a short film on its history and impact. Although the origins of the movie remain unknown, scientists and film experts who examine the 35 mm reel determine that, among other unique properties, the film utilizes disorienting sounds and subliminal imagery. The documentary crew further determines that unrelated, black-and-white snippets of an apparent snuff film have been spliced into the original movie by a third party. The documentary pauses so that Antrum may be presented in its entirety for the first time in twenty-five years.\nAntrum concerns siblings Oralee and Nathan, whose pet dog, Maxine, was recently euthanized. After Nathan asks if Maxine went to Heaven, their mother teases him with saying that because she was a bad dog, Maxine has gone to Hell. In a flashback, it is revealed that Maxine attacked Nathan, for no apparent reason, which resulted in her being euthanized. Traumatized, Nathan begins experiencing disturbing dreams and visions of demons. In an effort to ease his mind, Oralee claims to have obtained a grimoire from an imaginary classmate named Ike whom she claims is versed in the occult. Using the book\u2014in fact, a sketchbook Oralee has filled herself with arcane drawings and \"spells\"\u2014she takes Nathan to a nearby forest locally renowned as a place for suicides, telling him that it is the place where Satan fell to Earth when he was cast out of Heaven and that if they can find the place where he landed, the pair can dig a hole to Hell and rescue Maxine. Oralee guides Nathan through a series of rituals and \"rites,\" intending all along to arrange for Nathan to discover Maxine's collar in the woods as a \"sign\" they have saved her soul. As the day progresses, Oralee is disturbed to find that her \"spells\" are having an apparent effect on the real world, conjuring actual infernal figures. Additionally, the pair accidentally interrupt a man attempting seppuku, and obliviously pass by the rotting corpse of a suicide near their campsite.\nTheir first night in the woods, Nathan slips out of the tent and sees a boat being rowed in a nearby stream by a figure resembling Charon, who ferries a nude woman. He likewise hears a rattling chain that he attributes to Cerberus. The next day, Nathan and Oralee stumble upon a pair of cannibals in the woods, who capture and cook people alive inside a giant, iron statue of Baphomet, including the man whose suicide attempt they earlier interrupted. When the cannibals become aware of their presence, Oralee attempts to take herself and Nathan to safety by abandoning their camp and rowing downriver in the boat Nathan saw the night before; the pair both end up falling into the water. Oralee and Nathan make it to shore, only to realize they have moved in a circle and are back at their camp. As they hide for the night, Oralee confesses the ruse to Nathan, but he claims to have met Ike. Nathan further tells Oralee that Ike told him not to trust her.\nThe next morning, the cannibals capture them and attempt to cook Nathan, but Oralee escapes her cage and frees him.

At breakfast, she expresses to her father her hope to win a Citizenship medal handed out each year to a student who exemplifies the values of the school.\nThe \u201cmerit day\u201d (on which the medal is awarded) arrives and Emma is seated in the crowd, certain that she will win the medal. To Emma\u2019s shock and disappointment, Mrs. Ellis (Marci T. House) announces that the winner of this year\u2019s medal is Emma\u2019s classmate Milo Curtis (Luke Roessler).\nLater, all students and parents are celebrating outside and Emma expresses contempt for Milo to her father, who scolds her for her bitterness. Emma apologizes, but she secretly guides Milo away from the party and through a nearby patch of trees until they reach rocky cliffs overlooking the sea. She slowly moves towards him and murders him off-screen by pushing him into the sea, after stealing the Citizenship medal from him, and sneaking back into the party. Milo\u2019s body is found shortly thereafter by two girls who scream for help. Emma and David watch from a distance as people desperately try to resuscitate him and his mother breaks down into hysterics.\nThe next day, David asks Emma if she is feeling okay following what happened to Milo, but Emma acts cheerily and neglects to talk about the matter with any kind of empathy. David\u2019s sister Angela (Cara Buono), a psychiatrist, suggests to David that Emma is in shock and will find time to grieve whenever she is ready. Chloe (Sarah Dugdale), a babysitter David hired, begins work. Emma notices her stealing Xanax from David\u2019s bedroom, and tells her she knows what Chloe did as they are watching a film. Emma utilizes this fact to manipulate Chloe into doing tasks for her such as getting her ice cream and letting her stay up past her bedtime.\nMilo\u2019s funeral is held and Emma and David speak with Mr. and Mrs. Curtis (Shauna Johannesen and Robert Egger). Emma feigns sadness in front of them. Mrs. Curtis requests photos of Milo from the day of the ceremony from David.

Mrs. Ellis explains that Emma was the last person to be seen with Milo, having been witnessed taking him into the woods. David becomes anxious and assumes they are insinuating something dark. Chloe appears behind Emma in the next room, deducing that Emma killed Milo. In order to prevent the adults from discussing the matter further, Emma smashes a cookie jar and scratches her arm on broken glass, screaming. Mrs. Ellis and the investigator promptly leave. David asks Emma if she knows anything about being out on the rock-face with Milo, but Emma says she was never out there with Milo and that Mrs. Ellis is lying because she has always hated her.\nWhilst Emma and Chloe are out on a walk the next day, Chloe talks to Emma about what she did to Milo, but Emma denies everything. Chloe and Emma spot Mrs. Curtis and the investigator arriving at Milo's house, and Chloe says that Emma better get her story straight or they would capture her for murdering him. Back at the house, Chloe and Emma are eating together and Chloe lies to Emma, saying that if she gets caught for murdering Milo she will be put into a little electric chair for children that\u2019s been painted pink.

Later on, Mrs. Ellis is seen getting into her car with a wasp nest having been put in it by Emma and she crashes offscreen. Chloe discovers Milo's citizenship medal hidden under Emma\u2019s bed and hangs it from a lamp in David's room so that he will find it.\nWhen David returns home, he does not notice the medal and Emma comes into his room and talks to him. She finds the medal hanging from the lamp and secretly takes it off, hiding it behind her back. David questions her as to what she is hiding and Emma shows him the medal. Distressed, he interrogates her about where she got it and if she was out on the rock face with Milo. Emma admits that she was, but lies and says they played a game and Milo let her wear it for a short time, but that when she left the rock face he didn\u2019t return and so she kept the medal.\nDavid calls his sister Angela to refer Emma to a child psychiatrist because he is extremely worried that Emma may have been involved in Milo\u2019s death and is concerned about her behavior. The next day, David makes Emma return the medal to Mrs. Curtis. That night, he researches antisocial behavior in children and seems convinced that Emma's behavior is psychopathic. The next day, Emma visits a child psychiatrist (Patty McCormack), and acts normally to deceive her. The psychiatrist, named Dr. March, assures David that Emma is \u201cone hundred percent normal\u201d, and he is relieved.\nLater, Chloe goes into Emma\u2019s room and taunts her, telling her that she wants to hook up with David and that one day she may become Emma\u2019s stepmother. Emma is disgusted and says that she is going to have David get rid of Chloe. That night David, is readying to leave for a date and Emma reveals the contents of the conversation to him, but he assures her that what Chloe said isn\u2019t true, and Emma states that she does not ever want to have a stepmother.\nChloe is watching a film downstairs and searches for Emma.

Emma ultimately admits to murdering Milo, Mrs. Ellis, Chloe, and her previous babysitter who she didn\u2019t like. Emma justifies these murders, claiming she didn\u2019t do anything wrong. David is heartbroken.\nThe next day, David drives Emma to a lake house a few miles away, evading the suspicious Sheriff Peterson (Chris Shields).

Bhavesh discovers that the water pipes across the city meant for delivering water to the households have been fitted with extra pipes to siphon out water to water tankers which are then delivered to the various neighborhoods making people buy the same water which they were supposed to receive for free from the municipality.

He also has the ability to see ghosts, a talent that attracts the attention of a katana-wielding young woman in a black kimono. She introduces herself as Rukia Kuchiki while explaining to Ichigo that she is a Soul Reaper, a psychopomp who guides the departed to the Soul Society and purify those who remained among the living and transformed into monstrous beings called Hollows. At that time, a Hollow that Rukia was hunting named Fishbone D attacks Ichigo's home after sensing his high spiritual energy. Rukia is wounded in the attempt to protect the Kurosaki family and forced to transfer her powers into a desperate Ichigo so he can defeat the Hollow as a Soul Reaper. After discovering Rukia has enrolled in his class the following day, Ichigo learns that she has lost her power and he must serve as her substitute until he amassed enough Reiyoku energy from defeating Hollows to transfer Rukia's powers back to her.\nMeanwhile, Soul Reaper captain Byakuya Kuchiki, Rukia's older brother, sends his lieutenant Renji Abarai to retrieve her. A brief altercation between Ichigo and Renji occurs before the latter is driven off by arrows fired by Ichigo's classmate Ury\u016b Ishida. Ury\u016b reveals himself to be of a tribe of spiritually aware humans called Quincies, who were nearly wiped out by the Soul Reapers as they obliterate Hollows rather than purify them. Ury\u016b declares himself an enemy of all Soul Reapers as he challenges Ichigo to a Hollow hunting competition, having deliberately summoned the monsters to Karakura Town.\nWhile Ichigo and Rukia are fighting a Hollow, Hexapodus, they are confronted by Renji and Byakuya. After Renji defeats Ichigo, Byakuya scolds Rukia for having broken the Soul Society's laws by giving Ichigo her powers while giving her an ultimatum: either extract her Reiryoku from Ichigo or return to the Soul Society to be trialed and punished accordingly. As the former choice would result in Ichigo's death since he had not amassed the ideal amount for his survival, Rukia resigns herself for punishment. But Ichigo stops her at the last minute and makes a deal with Byakuya, to purify the infamous Hollow Grand Fisher to gain enough Reiryoku for a non-fatal transfer.\nAs Ichigo vigorously training for the confrontation catches the interest of his classmates Yasutora Sado and Orihime Inoue, he learns that Grand Fisher was the being who killed his mother Masaki when he was a child. While visiting Masaki's grave, Karin and Yuzu are attacked by Grand Fisher. Ichigo is able to free his sisters before taking Grand Fisher on in a highly destructive fight and defeating him with Ury\u016b's support, only for the two to be ambushed and Ury\u016b injured by Renji, who with Byakuya decided to renege on their deal. Though Ichigo manages to overpower Renji, Byakuya steps in and defeats Ichigo with overwhelming pace. Rukia intervenes, convincing Byakuya to spare Ichigo as she extracts her Reiryoku while parting ways with him. The next day, due to the Soul Society's influence, everyone in Karakura Town has forgotten Rukia and everyone thinks the damage to the town from the battle with Grand Fisher was caused by a tornado. However, Ichigo sees a note Rukia had left in his book and seemingly regains his memories.", "tmdb_id": 420426}, "63749289": {"title": "Bleed Out (film)", "plot": "Bleed Out begins by introducing Judie Burrows, the mother of the comedy director Steve Burrows, as an independent, globetrotting, retired school teacher who loved to travel. The film shifts to June 2009, where Judie is rushed to a hospital in Milwaukee, Wisconsin after suffering a hip fracture due to a fall from her bike. At the hospital, Judie undergoes a hip surgery and a rehabilitation process; afterwards, she is sent home where she endured a slow recovery despite the physical therapy. Five months after her initial hip surgery, Judie falls again, and is rushed to the hospital. She spends eight days in the hospital, calmed with painkillers, as the physicians try to understand where exactly the pain was coming from. After a week, the physicians concluded that Judie has broken her hip again and needs a rushed partial hip replacement surgery. Steve Burrows mentions that his mother, before the incident, was taking Plavix, which is a blood thinner, and states that it is usually suggested that the patient should be off the blood thinner a few days before the surgery. Nonetheless, despite being on blood thinners, Judie is cleared and undergoes her second hip surgery, where she loses about half of her body's blood volume.Judie withstands the surgery and is taken to the hospital's intensive care unit (ICU) to recover. On her first night at the ICU, the floor that Judie's room is on has no ICU physicians; instead, Judie's room is an electronic intensive care unit (eICU), where she is monitored by a group of doctors in an airport nearby through a camera. The eICU doctors can monitor their patients with microphones, alarms, and video cameras that can focus the details found on patients' monitors. Within an hour at the ICU, Judie's blood pressure drops below 50/30, and without anyone noticing, she falls into a coma. Two days later, a neurologist comes to evaluate her after she was determined to be unresponsive the day before during post-operation checkup, and declares her to be in a coma. Judie is comatose for almost two weeks, and once she wakes up, she is diagnosed with severe cognitive and physical disabilities because of the loss of oxygen to the brain.The film displays statistics about the frequency and consequences of medical errors in the United States. The film shows a statistic from a study conducted at Johns Hopkins that suggests that medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States. Marty Makary, a surgeon at Johns Hopkins, explains why he considers the occurrence of medical errors as a silent epidemic and why he believes they have become more frequent.The film goes back to the family. They were able to look at the anesthesiology records during Judie's second surgery and suspected that the records were too \"impeccable\" since no drop in blood pressure was ever recorded even if Judie lost a large amount of blood. Judie's family is displeased with the outcome, and it motivates Steve Burrow's uncle, Dr. Ted Payne, to persuade Steve to investigate the situation further and to file a lawsuit against the hospital. Steve visits a medical malpractice attorney, Lynn Laufenberg, and receives insight on how, in Wisconsin, patients lose 90% of malpractice lawsuits. Steve is still interested in filing a lawsuit and starts recording his mother's experience to use it as evidence.\nWhile trying to find a medical malpractice attorney to take the case, Steve simultaneously tries to manage his research about the medical errors and deal with medical bills. Judie is responsible for paying the bills since Medicare cannot cover the entirety of her long-term care at a rehabilitation center. Steve finds a medical malpractice attorney, Mike End; End describes the complications that they will face because of some laws that protect doctors in Wisconsin. For example, End explains Wisconsin statute 907.06, known as the Doctor Privilege Law, give doctors the right to not testify against other doctors. End reminds Steve that it might take three years or more for the lawsuit to get to trial.\nJudie's conditions improve with time, but due to spastic paraplegia, she can only walk by using a walker. Her cognitive impairment does not improve, and a neuropsychologist declares her incompetent with the cognitive abilities of an 8-year old. Steve tries to tell his mom about her situation, but Judie denies what the doctors say about her cognitive abilities and insists on returning home. They decide that it would be best for her to stay at the rehabilitation center. Four years after the incident, Judie, being on Medicare also goes into Medicaid because her 50 years of life savings, about $200,000, were not enough for the medical bills. Steve deals with waves of complications with insurance companies, medical corporations, and medical bills.\nSteve investigates his mother's surgery by meeting individuals related to the case, such as Bauer, his mother's surgeon, and a risk manager for Aurora West Allis Medical Center. He records these meetings with spy-cams. Bauer expresses his confusion about why the ICU has no physicians physically present and calls the eICU \"sloppy medicine\u201d. Eventually, Bauer recommends Steve talk to Aurora Health Care. Steve meets with the risk manager from Aurora and asks why Judie not receive any financial assistance, to which she repliesthat the hospital would have if they felt like they did something wrong.The film transitions from the spy-cam footage to a phone call in which Steve is told that Judie was rushed to the hospital. At the hospital, Judie had a stroke, but the medical caretakers treat her for a seizure. Judie is diagnosed with permanent brain damage, is unable to speak and has a catheter strapped onto her stomach. Then the film transitions again to Makary talking about how the medical field is not learning from its mistakes.\nThe film jumps to 2013, where the lawsuit's depositions begin. Thirty depositions are taken, but each individual blames others for her brain damage. One deposition is from an ICU nurse named Emily who states that the cameras in these units are not on all the time to respect the patient's privacy. Another deposition is from the eICU manager, whostates that the cameras are usually off in the patients' rooms and that an eICU physician should not replace a physical ICU physician since eICU physicians tend to 160 patients per day.After the depositions, Steve meets with Charles M. Harper Jr., a neurologist from Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. They speak about how the field of medicine and its patients would benefit in changing their focus from financial incentives to quality, health outcomes.\nThe film jumps to 2016, where the lawsuit goes to trial.

Dax is preparing to attend Blood Fest, a horror film festival being held on a massive, enclosed ranch with zones based on different types of horror films. Dr. Conway, who blames horror films for driving his patient to kill his wife, finds Dax's tickets and Blood Fest wristband and destroys them, forbidding Dax from attending the festival. Dax's best friends Sam and Krill convince him to ask their friend Ashley, an aspiring actress, to give him an extra ticket. Ashley agrees and convinces her boyfriend Lenjamin, the director of her film, to get Dax access to the festival.\nWhen the trio arrive at Blood Fest, Dax meets Roger Hinckley, an actor who played the killer in his favorite horror film series \"Arbor Day\". When Dax tries to talk to him, Hinckley coldly dismisses him and his own films, disappointing Dax. The festival kicks off with its founder, horror director Anthony Walsh, greeting the audience. He gives a speech about how horror is dead, inviting everyone to help him make the ultimate horror film. An army of chainsaw wielding psychos wearing pig masks, led by a mysterious masked person named Red, descend on the audience and begin brutally murdering everyone. Dax, Sam, and Krill realize they have no chance of getting out through the front entrance and flee into the grounds. Walsh makes his way to a control room at the top of the tower in the center of the grounds, where he and his employees are recording the entire festival to make a \"real\" horror film.\nDax, Sam, and Krill hide in a storage room, where they meet up with Ashley and Lenjamin. Ashley reveals there is an exit at a warehouse at the back of the grounds that can be opened with her pass key, so the group decide to make their way through the grounds to try and escape. They enter a fake graveyard, where Lenjamin convinces Ashley to give him the pass key because he doesn't trust her or the group. Zombies suddenly crawl out of the ground, killing Lenjamin. The others run to a nearby cabin where they find Hinckley hiding. Dax kills a zombie that breaks in by hitting it in the head, discovering the zombies are real corpses being re-animated and controlled by an electrical signal. Dax and Sam fight through the horde to destroy a power box, cutting off the signal and stopping the zombies long enough for them to get away.\nThe group, now joined by Hinckley, continue on and come upon a zone of the festival based on the \"Arbor Day\" films. They are attacked by the Arborist, the killer from the films, and Krill becomes separated from the group. Dax, Sam, Ashley, and Hinckley hide in a high school and meet actor Zachary Levi, who is killed by the Arborist when he sneaks in, forcing the group to run. Krill, meanwhile, runs into a group of vampires, but Rain, the lead vampire, does not bite him upon sensing he is a virgin. Krill takes a flaming stake and returns to the school, and uses it to kill the Arborist and save the others.

Once underground, they realize they are now in Tortureville, a zone of the park based on torture porn films. Sam finds a park employee stuck in a trap and frees him, only to become trapped herself. Just as Sam is about to be ripped in half, Hinckley sacrifices himself to save her. Ashley and Krill get stuck in a bathroom, where Ashley breaks down and admits that Lenjamin had the pass key when he died. Krill comforts her and they end up having sex.

Jayme release Sam, knowing she is important to Dax, and Dr. Conway orders them both to leave before he and Jayme leave to join Walsh and finish their plan. However, one of Walsh's workers notices Dax and Sam about to leave on a monitor and, not knowing who they are, locks the exit. Dax loses hope and considers just waiting for death, but Sam convinces him to face their fears and fight their way out.

Walsh decides to emit an electronic pulse that will cause everyone wearing a Blood Fest wristband to go insane and start killing each other. Dax is not affected due to not having a wristband, but Sam transforms into a mindless killing machine and attacks him, causing him to crash the truck into the tower. Dr. Conway sees Dax on the monitors and panics, activating an elevator to help Dax escape from Sam. Dax is taken up to the control room where he confronts his father and sister about what they have done. Dr. Conway shoots Walsh and tries to convince Dax that he is doing the right thing. However, Dax angrily reveals that he was afraid not of horror films, but of his own father after seeing him kill the patient as a child. Dax overcomes his fears and defiantly presses his head to the end of his father's gun. Dr. Conway is unable to kill Dax, but decides to set off the explosives all over the festival and kill them all.

When they discover their favorite distillery has been turned into a winery, Gordie wanders off to a small antique shop. There he learns the legend of the Bullitt Treasure, buried Prohibition money rumored to be hidden somewhere in Bullitt County. It is also revealed that Gordie is a recovering alcoholic, sober now for almost ten years.\nGordie convinces his friends they should ditch their plans and look for buried treasure, and the four friends set up camp deep in the woods of rural Kentucky.

The two soon realise that Yokohama has been engulfed in the mysterious fog, and everyone but the various ability-users have disappeared from the city.\nKy\u014dka and Atsushi meet with their superior Doppo Kunikida, who reveals that the deaths of ability-users were due to their abilities turning on them.

She requests that, whoever finds her tapes, splice together this interview at the beginning and end of the film, as well as show it to her parents. In May 2015, aspiring filmmaker Gavin York (played by Seth Adam Kallick) has hired a documentary film crew to chronicle his discovery of the tapes, and the research to prove that they are real, in the hopes of this being his last ditch effort to \"make it.\"\nPeeping Tom is a supernatural entity called a \"Flimmern Geist\", or Flicker-Spirit that is summoned by staring down the Ilchester Tunnel between midnight and one a.m. for an hour, without blinking, at which point he will materialize. Once you see him, however, he will always be there, getting closer every time you blink, until he is close enough to give you \"butterfly kisses\" before scaring you to death. The students opt to set up a camera to record the tunnel for an hour, reasoning that the lens is like an eye and the shutter would cause it to blink. It isn't until they're looking at the footage later that they realize it actually worked.\nIn his attempts to legitimize these tapes, Gavin is not able to confirm the existence of any of the people involved, including the students and their professor Dr. Wolfe, or any other corroborating information. The only person he's able to identify and interview is Matt Lake, an author interviewed about the local legend by the original team, but he doesn't remember much about the interview, and has no other information to show that they ever existed. In another bid for believers, he presents the footage of Peeping Tom appearing to a local ghost hunting group, The Inspired Ghost Tracking Team, who dismiss the film out of hand.\nWhile going through the footage, the team he hired, headed by actual film's director Erik Kristopher Myers, discovers some audio distortion in the original tapes that is Morse code for \"Blink.\" However, the documentary team is highly skeptical of Gavin's claims. Their questions begin to skew more towards the idea that perhaps Gavin has made this footage himself.\nWe learn that Gavin has failed in his previous attempts to become a filmmaker, and his relationship with both his wife and son are strained at best. He is unaware of their financial issues, but is so focused on proving that these tapes are real that he ends up pushing everyone away. The team also discovers that the original filmmakers had previously won an award for a documentary where they used an actor to portray a real person, which continues to cast doubt on the \"discovered\" film.\nGavin goes on the radio and is interviewed by host Mike Jones over Gavin putting up the footage of Peeping Tom on a website. The plan is to drum up interest in the discovered film; however, the program goes awry from the outset, only to be made worse when The Blair Witch Project co-director Eduardo S\u00e1nchez calls in to dismiss it as an obvious derivative film. After the interview, Gavin's life continues to spiral apart when he finds a note left by his wife that she's left him after he used all the money for his son's education to fund this film.\nErik and his team find Gavin posted outside the Ilchester Tunnel in an attempt to recreate the experiment using a camera. When the team leaves Gavin to discuss the morality of what they're doing, they're interrupted by someone running across the tracks. They realize Gavin and the camera are missing, but their camera battery runs out while they're standing outside the tunnel.\nWe see some more footage from the original film, which shows Feldman attempting to best Peeping Tom. He is not successful. However, Erik gets a call that when they analyzed the footage, they could see an image in Peeping Tom's eye that was what he would've seen in the tunnel when the students originally filmed the tunnel and summoned him.\nFurther validation is found when the audio engineer is able to isolate the Morse Code sound, and when using a program called Iris from iZotope, it reveals the silhouette of Peeping Tom in the audio files. At this point, it is confirmed that Gavin has been missing for nine days.\nErik receives a package from Gavin that contains both a DVCam film, a package to Sophia Crane from Feldman that has Feldman's original notebook, and Gavin's notebook with a hotel keycard inside. The crew shows up to find it abandoned, but with tons of GoPros set up. They also find the box with the original tapes. When one of the crew checks the bathroom, they find Gavin's mangled body in the bathtub, dead from heart failure at 39. They debate the merits of showing the police the tapes or the original footage, and opt not to.\nSophia Crane's footage shows her attempting to not blink. She tells about how she had a dream about the tunnel, and was able to stare easily down the tunnel for the whole hour, until Peeping Tom appeared. However, to her horror, she realizes that she was not dreaming and was in fact at the tunnel, ten miles from her home.\nOutside the tunnel, Erik and his team argue over whether or not they have an actual story. His crew argues to ditch the project, whereas Erik argues that they have a compelling story, all the footage and discoveries, and an end in Gavin York's death; that someone else could take all this and run, but it would be stupid not to put it out.\nWe then see the final interview once more from the beginning.

She is assigned to sew buttons onto garments, a job she does for no pay, as she lacks the skills to run the machines. The other girls taunt her, calling her Buttons. One girl takes the glass dog her mother gave her, but another brings it back to her. Annabelle runs away from the mill and lives on the street. On a cold Christmas eve, she meets her angel, whom she offers the last of her bread. Because she has stopped believing in angels, she doesn\u2019t recognize him. On her way to the church to get warm, she falls through thin ice atop the frozen river and nearly drowns, but her angel pulls her out and leaves her on he steps of the church. Elizabeth Browning (Devlin Stark) hears the angel knock and goes into the snow to bring Annabelle inside.

Kusakabe employed an assistant named Haba Fumikazu, who previously worked with and fall in love with Tachibana. During the investigation by Kusakabe, Haba discovered that the culprit that hacks into the system of NAZU (resembling NASA) are working in a game company. Haba was arrested for breaking into the game company and was presumed dead after the interrogation by Amuro, causing Kusakabe to exact revenge on the Public Security Bureau. Amuro then revealed that Haba's death was faked to ensure that the public prosecutor will not employ the help of the assistant in the same manner as he did to Haba again.\nHowever, Kusakabe already hacked into the system to change the projectile of the capsule launched from Hakuch\u014d to crash to the Tokyo Metropolitan Police building, but he causes blackout at the building and initiates the IoT attack at the nearby vicinity to allow police personnel and other residents to be evacuated to the Edge of Ocean. Although Kusakabe relented and gave up the access code, it was almost too late, and Conan and Amuro employed help from Dr. Agasa, Haibara and the Detective Boys to detonate the bomb using a drone built by Dr. Agasa near the capsule in order for the capsule to fall into the harmless spot. With the point of impact being the casino tower at the Edge of Ocean, Amuro and Conan race against time and traffic to allow Conan to shoot the ball to deflect the capsule, and the capsule falls harmlessly into the water.", "tmdb_id": 493006}, "68881231": {"title": "Castle & Castle", "plot": "The series is a story of a law family (Husband, wife and son) running a very successful law firm who now finds themselves defending opposite interest in the legal world which in turn now has adverse effect on their happy marriage and family at large.

They arrest him and during the interrogation, he reveals that he is supernatural hunter Professor Van Rental, and that he was trying to stake the woman because she was about to become a Trampire. \nVan Rental explains that back when vampires ruled over Transylvania, they were eventually driven out by the locals and forced into squalor, scrounging for food and living like derelicts. After eons of this, they became depressed and took to binge drinking, and this devolved them to the point where their thirst for blood and alcohol became one and the same, and now will only pray on those with high blood alcohol levels.

The captain doesn't believe them, thinking it's another one of Chucks conspiracy theories like how the governor is an Illuminati lizard man, but allows Steel till midnight to sort this mess out, but takes the monkey, Bubbles, along with him as a partner.\nVan Rental and Steel then proceed to get drunk as a way to lure out the Trampires, during which Van Rental explains that the Master is a Trampire who is destined to bring about 'The Lock-In' where the sun will be blocked out and everyone on Earth will then drink constantly, creating an endless food supply for the Trampires, but, a chosen one is also destined to defeat them. After several failed attempts to find Trampires, they dress Chuck up as a woman, since couples are more likely to be attacked, and find one, who they then follow back to their lair, to find that their Master is in fact Cular.\nHer plan was to make the L.A.P.D ineffective so that they would have no problem finding the 'Puritan' a figure who they must kill to bring about the Lock-In, who Steel and Van Rental correctly predict to be the Governor.\nVan Rental and Steel are captured by Cular where it's revealed that Chuck's wife did not die, but left him for a clown, and he kept it a secret to protect his image. The pair are then tied up while Cular and her Trampires go to the circus, where the governor would be, to execute their plan.

Fearing that his father might be the killer, Tyler befriends a teen outcast and amateur Clovehitch historian named Kassi and asks for her help.

The space agencies of the world prepare to test the Shepard particle accelerator aboard the orbiting Cloverfield Station, which would provide Earth with infinite energy, while conspiracy theorists fear it will create the \"Cloverfield Paradox\", opening portals to parallel universes allowing their horrors to threaten Earth. Among the crew is Ava Hamilton, a British engineer who frets about leaving her husband Michael potentially for years, as their relationship struggles since the loss of their children to a house fire. The crew is rounded out by American commander Kiel, German physicist Ernst Schmidt, Brazilian medical doctor Monk Acosta, Irish engineer Mundy, Russian engineer Volkov, and Chinese engineer Tam.\nAfter about two years of unsuccessful attempts to activate the Shepard, the crew achieves a seemingly stable beam, but it overloads and creates a power surge on the station. After restoring basic power, they find that Earth has vanished from view, and the gyroscope that aids in the station's navigation is missing. As the crew works on repairs, strange events begin to occur, including the discovery (and subsequent rescue) of an unfamiliar woman called Mina Jensen fused with wires inside a wall. Volkov's eyeballs begin moving of their own accord; he begins conversing with his own reflection in a mirror and is compelled to craft a gun using an on-board 3D printer. He uses the gun to threaten the crew, but as he does so he convulses and dies, and the station's worm colony bursts out of him. Jensen tells Hamilton not to trust Schmidt, who Jensen claims to be a spy sent by the German government to keep the Shepard shut down. Mundy's arm gets pulled into a solid wall and is severed clean off, without bleeding or pain. They find the arm roaming of its own volition. When they recognize it is trying to write something, it instructs them to \"cut Volkov open\". Once they do, they find the missing gyroscope. They finally locate Earth and begin restoring their communications, but transmissions state the station was destroyed and fell to Earth two days prior.\nThe crew determine the particle beam overload has activated the Cloverfield Paradox, which is the cause of the strange events, and also moved the station to a parallel universe in which Jensen replaced Tam as the station's engineer, Schmidt is a spy, and Hamilton, (though still working on the mission), has remained on Earth, where her children are still alive. Believing the Paradox can be reversed and they can return to their own universe if they reactivate the Shepard, the crew starts making repairs. Tam is trapped in a chamber that floods with water, and then explodes, freezing the water and Tam. Meanwhile, Hamilton decides to return to parallel Earth with Jensen in order to prevent the fire that killed her children. As they prepare, Mundy is killed in an explosion caused by a strange magnetic field, destabilizing part of the Shepard and threatening to tear the whole station apart.

On his way to offer assistance at the local hospital, he stops to help a young girl named Molly at a dockyard. After finding the hospital was destroyed, he takes her to the underground shelter of a friend and tends to her wounds.\nWith the Shepard particle accelerator ready to activate again, Hamilton prepares to leave with Jensen, but Jensen suddenly knocks her out. Jensen kills Monk with Volkov's gun, wounds Schmidt, and insists the station must stay in her universe to keep the Shepard particle accelerator there.

Colin expresses his concern about the potential conflicts this could cause: in addition to their class difference, Nick is expected to stay in Singapore and run his family's corporation, whereas Rachel loves her job in New York.\nAfter the parties, Nick apologizes to Rachel for not telling her who he really was. Eleanor recounts the sacrifices she made to become a part of the Young family and makes jabs at Rachel for her American background, specifically highlighting the American unwillingness to place family over self, even after Rachel compliments Eleanor's emerald engagement ring. Su Yi arrives and then criticizes Eleanor\u2019s dumplings, making everyone present visibly uncomfortable. Later, Eleanor privately recounts how Nick's father had to obtain her ring because Su Yi disapproved of Eleanor and refused to give him the ring, and she tells Rachel that she will never be enough for Nick or his family. Peik Lin convinces Rachel to stand up to Eleanor and earn her respect.\nOn the day of the wedding, Peik Lin, with the help of Oliver T\u2019sien (Nick\u2019s second cousin) gives Rachel a glamorous and elegant makeover that visibly stuns everyone in attendance, especially Nick. Meanwhile, en route to the wedding, Astrid confronts Michael about his affair only to learn that he blames his unhappiness and his infidelity on the financial disparity between them. During the wedding reception, Eleanor and Su Yi privately confront Rachel and Nick. Using the findings of a private investigator, Eleanor reveals that Rachel's father is alive, and Rachel was conceived through an extramarital affair, after which her mother, Kerry, left her husband and fled to the United States. They demand that Nick stop seeing Rachel for fear of being linked to such a scandal. This shocks Rachel, as her mother had told her that her father was dead. Heartbroken, she flees to Peik Lin's home, remaining in a depressed stupor for days.\nKerry later arrives, explaining that her husband was abusive and that the comfort of an old classmate turned into love, and a surprise pregnancy. She fled with baby Rachel in fear that her husband would kill them. Kerry then reveals that Nick was the one who called her to Singapore, and urges Rachel to talk to him before they go home. When they meet, Nick sincerely apologizes for all that he and his family have put her through. He then proposes to Rachel, promising that he is willing to abandon his family, position, and wealth to be with her.\nRachel arranges to meet Eleanor at a mahjong parlor. As they play, she reveals that she declined Nick's proposal. She points out that Eleanor has placed the three of them in an unwinnable position: Nick can forsake Rachel and remain dutiful but resentful of  his family, or he can forsake his family for love. She then clarifies that she declined his proposal so that he wouldn't have to make a lose-lose decision. Making use of her expertise in game theory, she hands Eleanor the mahjong tile that lets the older woman win, before revealing that she could have kept the tile for herself and claimed victory.  Having thus demonstrated her willingness to place family over self, she leaves with Kerry. Meanwhile, Astrid takes her son Cassian and moves out.\nEleanor meets with Nick, emotionally affected by her exchange with Rachel. Meanwhile, at Changi Airport, Rachel and Kerry are boarding a flight back to New York. They are suddenly interrupted by Nick, who proposes again\u2014this time with Eleanor's ring, symbolizing her blessing.

Now a worldwide star, Donnie proposes marriage to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor, who agrees. Bianca suggests starting a new life together in Los Angeles, but Donnie is reluctant to leave Philadelphia, and thus Rocky.\nIn Ukraine, Ivan Drago, the former Soviet boxer who killed Donnie's father Apollo Creed during a bout in 1985, has been living destitute since losing to Rocky that year, and seeks to regain glory. Assisted by promoter Buddy Marcelle, Ivan pits his son, Viktor, against Donnie. When Rocky refuses to support Donnie's acceptance of Viktor's challenge, Donnie leaves for Los Angeles.\nDonnie and Bianca settle in a luxurious apartment in Los Angeles close to Donnie's adoptive mother and Apollo's widow, Mary Anne. As they adjust to their new life and prepare for the upcoming match, Bianca learns that she is pregnant. Donnie recruits Tony \"Little Duke\" Evers, son of his father's trainer Tony \"Duke\" Evers and later Rocky's trainer, to start training him. Overwhelmed by his life's recent developments, the underprepared Donnie rushes into the match and is badly injured. Viktor is disqualified for hitting Donnie while he is down, allowing Donnie to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Nevertheless, Viktor becomes extremely popular in Russia and wins a series of fights with top billing.\nHis body and ego shattered, Donnie becomes increasingly disconnected from Bianca. Mary Anne reaches out to Rocky, who reconciles with Donnie and agrees to train him for a rematch against Viktor, who is suffering torturous physical tests at Ivan's hands. Bianca gives birth to a daughter, Amara, and Rocky is named her godfather; however, Amara is born deaf, inheriting it from her mother's progressive hearing disorder.\nWhile Viktor taunts Donnie publicly, he faces constant pressure from his father behind the scenes, who enjoys the attentions of the media and various Russian delegates. At a state dinner, he and Ivan encounter Ludmilla, his mother and Ivan's ex-wife, for the first time in several years after she abandoned them following Ivan's loss to Rocky. Enraged at the sight of her, Viktor storms out of the dinner and chastises Ivan for seeking approval from those who cast them out. Meanwhile, Rocky and Little Duke retrain Donnie in a decrepit location in the California desert, focusing on fighting from within and training Donnie's body to absorb the heavy impact he will receive from Viktor in the ring.\nIn Moscow, the rematch is more balanced as a more controlled and focused Donnie exchanges equal blows with Viktor. Viktor is used to winning by knockout as his bouts have never lasted past four rounds; Donnie uses this to his advantage and willingly endures a heavy beating from Viktor, even after his ribs are broken. In the tenth round, Donnie unleashes sequences of effective blows and knocks Viktor down twice. Ludmilla departs after the second knockdown, upsetting Viktor, and Ivan sees the truth of his son's earlier words. An exhausted Viktor is cornered and receives multiple strikes without defending himself, but is unwilling to go down. Finally realizing that his son's safety means more to him than revenge or acceptance from Russia's elite, Ivan throws in the towel, forfeiting the fight to protect his son. He assures the distraught Viktor it is okay that he lost, and embraces him. As Bianca enters the ring to celebrate with Donnie, Little Duke, and Creed's other trainers, Rocky recuses himself and takes a seat to watch them from outside the ring.\nFollowing the match, Viktor and Ivan later train together back in Ukraine. Rocky travels to Chicago to make peace with his own estranged son, Robert Jr., and meets his grandson Logan for the first time.

Once again in a situation where she feels like she needs to flee from him, she falls down an embankment while fleeing and comes across a corpse on the beach.\nAt the same time, Prof. Dr. Paul Herzfeld, a medical examiner working for the Federal Criminal Police Office, is engaged in an autopsy at the Charit\u00e9 University Hospital in Berlin. He finds a capsule in the head of a female corpse whose jaw is missing. The capsule contains a small slip of paper with the cell phone number of his 17-year-old daughter Hannah, whom he rarely sees since separating from her mother. He calls the number and has to find out that his daughter has been kidnapped. He is told to wait for more information which he will get from a man called Erik. Mr. Herzfeld is advised not to call the police if he does not want to risk the life of his daughter.\nWhile Linda is standing next to the corpse, the mobile phone of the dead man found on Heligoland, rings. She answers the call and talks to Mr. Herzfeld. She explains that he cannot come to Heligoland because of the storm. He tells Linda to search for Ender M\u00fcller, who is a friend of his and the caretaker in the local hospital. The two of them should bring the corpse to the autopsy room. At the same time, Mr. Herzfeld and his new trainee Ingolf von Appen begin their journey to Cuxhaven in von Appen's car. The trainee became rich by selling his website which he had invented by the age of 14 but working in forensic medicine is not one of his strengths. During the ride, he urges Linda on the phone to examine the corpse she found on the beach.\nLinda, who is disgusted and a vegetarian, only approves of an external necropsy, which she performs following Herzfeld's instructions, while Ender tries to lighten the mood with jokes. However, when she finds a yellow object in the corpse's throat and is asked to cut the throat open, she resists the request. Only after talking to Herzfeld about her ex-boyfriend Danny, she changes her mind. The object turns out to be the plastic capsule of a Kinder Surprise and contains a photograph depicting the retired judge Friedericke T\u00f6ven who lives on Heligoland. According to Jens Marinek, she once passed a too lenient sentence on Sadler, who had raped Marinek's only daughter who was underaged and later committed suicide because of Sadler. Herzfeld and Marinek were colleagues and friends at that time. At the time, Marinek had urged Herzfeld to give a false testimony so that Sadler got a tougher punishment, though Herzfeld refused to.\nLinda and Ender break into T\u00f6ven's house in Heligoland and find a woman's corpse there, which they also bring to the autopsy room. Meanwhile, Herzfeld and his intern have reached the secluded house of his colleague, Jens Marinek. There, next to a dead pig, they find evidence relating to the sadist Jan Erik Salder, the man who is holding Hannah captive. During the search for clues, Ingolf falls into a frozen lake near the house, though he is saved by Herzfeld.\nEnder wants to secure the electricity supply at the Heligoland clinic, and comes back to the autopsy room, in which Linda has locked herself, with a knife in his shoulder. A block of wood sticks out of T\u00f6ven's rectum. Herzfeld has seen equivalent images in a video. There are numbers on the wooden block, which Linda forwards on via her phone. They are geo-coordinates which lead Herzfeld and his trainee into a forest. There, Herzfeld is overpowered by Marinek, who shoots himself after swallowing a memory chip. Herzfeld gets it out and sees a video on it showing the boss of a moving company Philipp Schwintowski.\nNot only Marinek's daughter Lily but also Schwintowski's daughter Rebecca had been abducted by Sadler. In desperation, both of them had committed suicide after being raped by him. Marinek and Schwintowski decided to take justice into their own hands. They arranged for Hannah's abduction because in their eyes Herzfeld, as part of the justice system, was also responsible for the death of their daughters.\nIn the forest, Herzfeld deliberately causes a car accident to alarm a rescue helicopter via the car's automatic emergency call system. The helicopter takes Ingolf and him to Heligoland. When he arrives, he saves Linda and Ender, who had been attacked by Sadler, which left Ender severely injured. Herzfeld recognizes that the dead person found on the beach was Schwintowski. The reference to Alcatraz leads the group to a bunker system under the Lighthouse of Heligoland, that the Nazis once built. There, Herzfeld finds Hannah and rescues her. Sadler is able to hide and escape unnoticed.\nBefore he flies back in a helicopter with Hannah and the corpses, the forensic doctor thanks Linda and Ingolf for their assistance.

The other inmate who fought the Cops upon landing, Gipsy Rose, wins the qualifying match.  That night, Jane once again sees Connor and brings him to her house.  They talk about how they got into the Sprawl.  She assumes he wishes to sleep with her, but Connor refuses to her surprise.\nThe next day, Connor tells Baltimore Bob that he wants to be in a Death Race.  His qualifying match is a footrace to a tower, which he must climb to claim the keys to a car.  He fights his way to the tower and gets the keys, only to find that now he must face the Butcher, a huge man carrying a sledgehammer and sickle.  Connor gruesomely defeats him and Frankenstein tells his concubine Carley to bring Connor to him.  In the shower, Carley makes a pass at Connor, which he again refuses.  Frankenstein tells him that if he wins the Death Race, he will become king of the Sprawl, and asks if he is ready for that responsibility.  After the meeting, Connor goes to see Jane again.  This time, they appear to begin a relationship.\nConnor begins construction of his Death Racer with Baltimore Bob.  The woman who picked him up after his fight with the Cops asks to be his co-pilot, to which he reluctantly agrees.  He spends the night before the Death Race with Jane again, telling her that before he got to prison, he had nothing to care about, and implies that now he cares only for her.\nThe next morning, he sees the entire prison descending on Jane's house.  He goes outside and is confronted by Frankenstein, who reveals to the whole prison that Connor is actually Sergeant Connor Gibson, a special operative sent inside to kill him.  He declares that Connor will be allowed to compete in the Death Race, but many are angered by this betrayal and wish him dead.\nAs the Death Racers arrive at the starting line, Frankenstein reveals that his new co-pilot will be a captive Jane, whom he is using as an \"insurance policy\" against Connor.  Throughout the Death Race, competitors are taken out one by one, until only Connor, Frankenstein, Johnny Law and Gipsy Rose remain.  Connor, in last, gets rerouted by Baltimore Bob.  He performs a near impossible jump of 250 feet over a downed bridge and gets right back behind Frankenstein.  Johnny Law is eliminated and Gipsy Rose is in third.\nDuring the final stretch, Connor runs out of gas.  Frankenstein turns around and Jane begs him not to kill Connor.  Frankenstein drives at Connor and his co-pilot; they fire a missile at him with no effect.  At the last second, Gipsy Rose T-bones Frankenstein.  Connor rushes to help Jane and Gipsy Rose gets out and shoots Frankenstein, killing him.  She tells Connor that a helicopter will be there to pick them up soon; he realizes that she is also a special agent.  Connor, now torn between his past life and his new one with Jane, decides to stay.  Baltimore Bob tells him to put on the mask, become Frankenstein and run the Sprawl.

When they arrive, they meet Durant, as well as the facility's crew, which include shark trainers Trent Slater, Mike Shutello, and Josh Hooper, and computer technician Aaron Ellroy. As a demonstration, Durant throws Aaron into the water, letting the sharks chase him: at the last possible second, he uses a special device to drive them away in formation. Durant explains that he has been genetically altering the brains of five bull sharks to make them smarter, which renders Misty concerned.\nThe group subsequently convenes in the wet lab, where Durant explains to Misty that the reason he invited her is that the alpha shark, Bella, has been acting strangely, to which Misty concludes is because she is pregnant. Durant is puzzled by this because her pregnancy did not come up on any tests they ran on her, and Misty theorizes that their genetic alterations hid this. Durant then brings Bella into the wet lab, and has Josh take samples of her saliva, although Bella attempts to bite his arm; he narrowly avoids this. Meanwhile, on the surface, a second shark pushes the motorboat into an electric control box, causing it to explode, and creating significant damage.

Amir scolds Nkem for undressing in front of him, calling her \u201cshameless woman\u201d in Hausa. Nkem responds, revealing that she understands Hausa. While Amir is shifting his clothes around, Nkem spots his suicide bomber vest. She says she\u2019s not sure why she\u2019s not afraid, now that she knows he is a suicide bomber, and that she\u2019s paid to take him to the address given to her.

Nkem says she can\u2019t make 5 million quickly enough that way. Amir asks if she\u2019s made 5 million prostituting herself, implying that her current method isn\u2019t working anyway. Amir says Nkem\u2019s brother, Chidi, should take care of himself. Nkem protests that Chidi is only 13, but Amir says he could handle himself at the age of 11.\nNkem reveals that Chidi came home early from school to find his uncle having sex with Nkem, and tried to defend Nkem, but Chidi\u2019s uncle pushed Chidi down the stairs and cracked his skull. Nkem adds that her uncle only paid Chidi\u2019s school fees because Nkem agreed to have sex with him, and that the uncle had been touching her ever since the age of eight. Amir says she should\u2019ve stopped the uncle as soon as she knew he was doing something wrong. Nkem said she tried to stop him because she was on her period and he burnt her face with a waffle iron, causing her disfigured face. Nkem asks, rhetorically, how she could\u2019ve stopped her uncle. Nkem adds that if Chidi dies, everything she\u2019s endured to support Chidi will have been a waste. Amir ends the conversation by saying that by whoring herself out, Nkem is already dead.\nNkem and Amir have arrived at their destination, and are already out of the car. Amir pays Nkem for helping him. Nkem asks if Amir knows the residents, but he refuses to answer. Amir walks up to the building marked Little Saints Chapel and Orphanage. Amir carries a red satchel. He knocks on the metal door outside. The man who answers the door instructs Amir to wait inside the chapel while he goes to find Sister Dorcas and alert her to Amir\u2019s presence.\nSister Dorcas enters the orphanage. She is an older, short woman. She\u2019s very excited to see Amir, who she recognizes as both Joseph and Amir. The man who permitted Amir to enter sneaks up behind him, preparing to stab him with a large machete. Sister Dorcas signals for the man to proceed in attacking Amir, but Amir snatches the machete from its sheath and cleaves the man\u2019s head open. Amir asks Sister Dorcas how she knew him as Amir, since that name was only given to him after he left her orphanage as a young boy. Amir figures out that Mallam and Sister Dorcas are working together. Sister Dorcas shoots Amir with a small firearm she had hidden in her baggy robes. Sister Dorcas expresses sadness at having to shoot \u201cone of my own children.\u201d Sister Dorcas accuses Amir of ungratefulness towards Mallam. Sister Dorcas tells Amir she works with Mallam to earn the money necessary to feed all the orphanage\u2019s young residents. Amir tells Sister Dorcas that Mallam\u2019s organization turned him into an outcast. Sister Dorcas says that was Amir\u2019s mother\u2019s doing, for giving Amir to the orphanage in the first place. While Sister Dorcas is talking about why she must kill Amir, he snatches her pistol to the side and stabs her suddenly. Amir collapses flat on the ground, not moving.\nNkem enters the chapel. She takes Amir\u2019s satchel and looks inside. It contains a lot of money. The man that Amir sedated arrives outside the orphanage on a motorbike, just as Nkem is slowly, painstakingly assisting Amir out of the building. The man calls Mallam to update him. Mallam instructs the man to follow them, ensure they are alone, and then kill them.\nNkem says she is taking Amir to the only healthcare worker she knows, because they can\u2019t take Amir to the hospital. He would get in trouble for his suicide bomber vest. Nkem clarifies that the healthcare worker she has in mind is an abortion specialist. Nkem and Amir stop outside the abortion doctor\u2019s house, and Nkem tells Amir to remove \u201cthat thing under your clothes,\u201d the suicide bomber vest. Nkem finds a map in Amir\u2019s satchel with the location of the hospital where Chidi is being treated marked on it. Amir passes out from blood loss.\nAmir wakes up inside the building, shirtless, without his suicide bomber vest, with an IV drip in his arm. The abortion doctor (Mahin Nosa Itotoi), a middle aged woman, is watching television and laughing in the next room, with Nkem who is much more concerned about whether Amir will survive. The two rooms are separated by a curtain. The abortion doctor has figured out that Amir is planning on committing a crime but does not care because she believes she will be paid in full. Amir enters the same room as Nkem and the doctor, and the doctor leads him back to the bed where he woke up. The doctor introduces herself as \u201cMatron Dora of the Matron Dora Specialist Hospital.\u201d\nThe man that Amir sedated is outside Matron Dora\u2019s house. He calls Mallam and informs him that Amir and Nkem have been inside the building the man is outside of for a while now. The man suggests they try to reason with Amir, but Mallam says to kill Amir on sight. The man points out that Amir could have killed him but did not. Mallam says Amir might still kill the man if given the chance. The man says he will obey Mallam\u2019s orders. Amir tries to leave Matron Dora\u2019s house but she tells him that will break the stitches and she will charge double money from Nkem, who tells Amir she wants to have a conversation before he leaves to do his business.\nNkem demands privacy from Matron Dora and then asks him if he was ordered to bomb St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, informing him desperately that Chidi is recovering from his injuries there. Amir tells her he does not plan on following through on his orders, although his orders were, in fact, to bomb St. Luke\u2019s Hospital. Nkem is relieved. Amir informs her that Mallam has probably already sent another \u201cdelivery boy\u201d to bomb the hospital. Nkem says Amir must kill Mallam. Amir shushes Nkem, suspicious that Matron Dora has been quiet for a while. Nkem insists Matron Dora is just asleep, and enters the next room. Matron Dora appears to be asleep on the couch from Nkem\u2019s perspective but she soon realizes that Matron Dora is dead. Her throat has been cut wide open. The man who was ordered to kill Amir is hiding right behind Nkem, ready to stab her in the back. Amir hears the man move, and darts into the next room to grab Nkem and pull into the room with the hospital bed, saving her life. \nThe man enters that room, and the three begin to fight. Nkem tries to hit the man but he slices at her with the knife and shoves her to the ground. Nkem falls and stops moving. Right before the man tries to stab Amir, he calls the man Kazeem. The man, Kazeem, doesn\u2019t listen and tries to stab Amir. Instead, Amir stabs Kazeem with a knife he finds in the room. Amir starts to reason with Kazeem. Amir points out, as Kazeem did, that Amir could have killed Kazeem and decided not to. Amir reveals his goal is to kill Mallam Sadan. Kazeem asks why Mallam, who serves God, is Amir\u2019s enemy. Amir says Mallam does not serve God, only himself and calls Mallam \u201cfilthy.\u201d Amir points out that Mallam told his child followers everything they know about the Qur\u2019an and their religion. Mallam calls Kazeem, but Kazeem doesn\u2019t pick up. Amir implies Mallam has distorted Islam to fit his purposes and says that Malik was one of Mallam\u2019s victims. Amir regrets having reported Malik for what was supposedly lies. The phone is still ringing. Kazeem picks up the phone and lies to Mallam that he has killed Amir. Kazeem tells Amir to \u201cdisappear.\u201d Kazeem says he is going to meet Mallam and some other followers at a mosque on Fatai Street. Amir advises Kazeem to go home instead, implying that Amir plans to bomb the mosque.\nAmir wakes Nkem up and tells her he plans to kill Mallam, which makes her grateful so she hugs Amir. However, Amir recoils, which confuses Nkem. She asks if he\u2019s ever been \u201cintimate.\u201d He says he\u2019s been intimate before, but not with a woman. When Amir was adopted from the orphanage, Amir says the man who arranged his adoption was called Ofili. Amir flashes back to threatening the driver who Amir later stabbed, implying that Ofili is that driver. Amir, in the present, says that Ofili took him to meet his new father, Mallam Sadan.\nAmir flashes back to the same scene from earlier wherein Amir called himself Joseph and Mallam spoke with Sister Dorcas. Amir confirms that Mallam is his father according to the adoption papers, \u201cbut we did things that a father and son should never do!\u201d going on to say that he too was sexually abused, but by Mallam instead. The sexual abuse continued throughout the an entire weekend. Amir doesn\u2019t think of it as abuse, though, because Mallam treated him with affection. Mallam then sent him to a religious camp to be indoctrinated, where Amir met Malik. Once Amir and Malik formed a friendship, Malik opened up to Amir about being sexually abused by Mallam as well. This implies that Malik\u2019s \u201clies\u201d mentioned earlier, that Amir reported, were Malik\u2019s stories of sexual abuse at the hands of Mallam. Amir became jealous, because Amir perceived the abuse as an expression of love, and Amir thought Mallam had loved only him.\nAmir tells Nkem when and where he plans to kill Mallam. Nkem gives Amir the suicide bomber vest. Amir clarifies that the man he fought was not Malik, and that Malik had come from a different orphanage. Amir confesses that his reporting Malik\u2019s \u201clies\u201d about abuse led to Malik being stoned by Amir and the other child followers.\nNkem gently tells Amir he was never special to Mallam. She explains that Amir was manipulated via shame and need for affection. Amir covers himself, including his face, with a robe so Mallam can\u2019t see him. Before leaving the building, he gives Nkem enough money to pay for Chidi\u2019s surgeries, which makes her cry. Amir passes out again, which makes Nkem cry harder.\nWhen Amir regains consciousness, he finds a letter from Nkem. She has taken the suicide bomber vest and left all the money that Amir gave her. She also took the white robe that Amir planned to use to cover the vest. The letter makes it clear that Nkem plans to sacrifice herself, and she asks Amir to save Chidi and Amir himself. The camera cuts between Amir reading the letter and Nkem walking up to Mallam, where she detonates the vest. Mallam stands still until the vest detonates, meaning he most certainly dies in the explosion. \nAmir falls as a result of the blast\u2019s shockwave. He stands up and looks out the window.\nCredits roll briefly.\nIn a mid-credits scene, an unidentified man calls St. Luke\u2019s Hospital and confirms he is speaking with the hospital\u2019s proprietor. The man identifies himself as Chidi\u2019s uncle and says that the operation\u2019s cost, 5 million Naira, was too high. Chidi\u2019s uncle demands that the hospital give him a partial refund of the cost of the operation. The doctor refuses and the call ends. Somebody knocks on the door, and Chidi\u2019s uncle opens the door. Outside it stands Amir, who makes direct, sinister eye contact with Chidi\u2019s uncle.\nCredits roll."}, "50818732": {"title": "Den of Thieves (film)", "plot": "In Los Angeles, a team of ex-MARSOC Marines led by Ray Merrimen hijack an armored truck.

Of the two priests, Father Thomas Riley is the older, and is disillusioned in his work as a miracle investigator for the Vatican, complaining that he has seen too many frauds over the years, while the younger Father John Thornton is a priest enthusiastic about the assignment, and fervently believes that they will find a genuine miracle. The authoritarian Mother Superior of the asylum initially tries to discredit the letter (which had been sent anonymously from her hospice) by reminding the priests that \"they are not all good girls in this home\" and makes it clear that none of the priests are welcome, treats them grudgingly, and installs them in separate accommodation in the building.\nTo begin the work of documenting the alleged miracle, Father John sets up his film crew (16 mm cameras) in the chapel where the statue reported to have wept blood is located. Upon examining the statue, Father Thomas comments that he cannot analyse the blood, as it has dried up, and he needs a fresh blood sample, so they will have to wait for the miracle or phenomenon to happen again. Meanwhile, the young priest tries to interview some of the women in the asylum, but soon discovers that they have no access to the chapel and are in fact victims of cruel punishments imposed to ensure discipline, and are also exploited for labour, as they are responsible for both keeping the asylum clean and running the local laundry business. The abuse of the hard-working inmates is discussed with the Reverend Mother. Despite being unhappy that the priests have to document all their activities and conversations, she defiantly replies that the Church usually sends them into every dirty secret in the country, and they have had to deal with that ... and adds, \"Do you know how many Church messes I've had to personally clean up? How many of the babies born here had fathers who were fathers?\"\nFor two nights, Father John is constantly awakened at 3 a.m., as he hears strange sounds and has apparent visions of children playing in the hallways. He brings this to the attention of Thomas, who denies hearing anything at all. They also confirm that there are no children living in the asylum; the children's wing has been closed since the war. Father Thomas's long-standing doubts about miracles and human evil keep him convinced that a con man is behind these strange occurrences. However, on the third day, all the statues of the Virgin Mary in the asylum begin to bleed at the same time. Father Thomas analyses the blood and discovers that it is human, type O-negative, and that it comes from a pregnant woman. Father Thomas compares the samples with the blood of the inmates and the nuns, but finds no match.\nA nun privately confesses that she was the person who contacted the Church to investigate the weeping statue. The nun warns Father Thomas that there is a young pregnant woman named Kathleen O'Brien being held in a secret room in the basement, and recites, \"If your eye makes you sin, pluck it out and throw it away\". Despite the Mother Superior's stern objections, Father Thomas insists on seeing Kathleen. Father Thomas demands Kathleen's release when he sees her emaciated, scarred and chained in a filthy room. A local doctor confirms that the girl is a virgin, but that she is pregnant, and in his experience, he cannot explain how it happened. Attempts to move her beyond her room result in violent attacks and soon manifestations of apparent demonic possession. Father Thomas interviews Kathleen, who claims to be possessed by an unknown entity. Kathleen says something to Father Thomas in Greek. The priest attempts to pray with Kathleen, which causes a nearby nun to suddenly experience intense pain.\nAll the statues of the Virgin Mary in the building are suddenly broken. Father Thomas and Father John follow a ghostly apparition downstairs to a room that houses a satanic cult, and items found in the room indicate that a Black Mass has been performed. Father Thomas fetches Mother Superior to take her with him into the room, only to find that all evidence of the Black Mass ritual has inexplicably vanished. As they try to rationalise what has just happened, screams are heard from Kathleen's cell, who is stabbing her belly. Father Thomas intervenes and in attempting the ritual exorcism, Kathleen levitates from her bed and her hand also bursts into flames during another instance of supernatural activity. In response to what Kathleen told him in Greek, Father Thomas confesses to Father John that he was an orphan; furthermore, Father Thomas speculates that he may have been born in that very asylum. Kathleen cryptically says something to the priests about the babies who have been killed in the asylum. \"The babies down there are suffering for the sins of others.\" Father Thomas questions Mother Superior about false records of missing children. Mother Superior explains that she sold the babies to fund the asylum. Kathleen goes into labour. The nuns attend the birth while the priests go in search of the doctor. Kathleen dies in childbirth.\nFather Thomas and Father John follow the apparitions of more ghostly children throughout the building. The two priests return to the room where they had found Satanic paraphernalia, as they hear a baby crying. There they find a murdered nun, whose eyes have been gouged out; she is the one who had previously confessed to sending the letter. They then discover a secret passage leading to a network of tunnels where they discover several skeletons of small children. The two priests walk through the tunnels, but become disoriented and are separated when a nun attacks them. Father John is killed by the nun. After taping a confessional, Father Thomas finds a satanic altar where a baby used to be. The priest encounters a group of nuns who form a coven and are performing a ritual.

Regardless of the developments, the IDF initiates preparations for a rescue mission, consisting of the Sayeret Matkal elite commando unit, headed by Lt. Col. Yoni Netanyahu. Despite favoring a diplomatic approach towards the crisis, Rabin reluctantly supports the operation.\nOn 3 July, with the preparations for the rescue mission - codenamed Operation Thunderbolt, finalized, Rabin convenes the Israeli cabinet for a vote regarding the status of the operation; the cabinet unanimously votes to proceed with the mission, with full endorsement from Gur. The strike force, having already departed for Uganda, is authorized to proceed with the mission.\nThat night, four Israeli C-130 transport aircraft carrying the strike force land discreetly at Entebbe. Almost immediately, and as an approach to maintain the element of surprise, the unit approaches the terminal in a black Mercedes limo disguised as Amin's state vehicle. However, one of the operatives prematurely opens fire, alerting the hijackers and Ugandan security personnel. The operatives storm the building, engaging both the terrorists and Ugandan soldiers. In the ensuing melee, B\u00f6se, Kuhlmann and Yoni are killed, along with the remaining terrorists and several Ugandan soldiers. With the airport secure, the strike force evacuates 102 hostages from Uganda.\nElsewhere, Peres congratulates Rabin on the success of the operation; the latter solemnly retorts that ensuring peace is the only way towards preventing further incidents between Israelis and Palestinians. The film's ending displays archival footage of the survivors' return to Israel, with brief notes about the fates of  Rabin, Peres, Yoni and the aftermath of the operation.", "tmdb_id": 433627}, "46958961": {"title": "The Equalizer 2", "plot": "Robert McCall still lives in Boston, where he works as a Lyft driver and assists the less fortunate with the help of his close friend and former DIA colleague Susan Plummer.

He had previously served in Afghanistan in an attack team alongside his best friend (who he explains \"was like a brother\") and was the only survivor of their last mission. Danni is grounded by her mother for delinquent behaviour, but Knox manages to fix the situation, and her mother gives her consent for Michael to take Danni to the football match.\nArriving at the West Ham stadium, Upton Park, Danni expresses her frustration about her dad's death. Michael goes to get them both hot dogs, at which point Danni gets a text from a boy she fancies and decides to join him at his seat. Meanwhile, Arkady and his mercenaries covertly infiltrate the stadium, take over the control room and initiate a lockdown of the entire stadium. Taking Superintendent Steve Thompson hostage, Arkady threatens Thompson into cooperating by threatening his family. Arkady then has his men blow up all transmission towers across the city to ensure that no communication will be made outside the stadium. Discovering Danni is missing from her seat, Knox seeks help with the cheeky stadium guard, Faisal Khan. Faisal reluctantly assists Knox to the control room. On their way, they run into one of Arkady's men posing as a guard near the lift, who ultimately attacks them, resulting in Michael killing him. Knox finds C-4 explosives in Andrei's jacket. He then uses the only working walkie-talkie to call the police about the situation, but Chief Commander Daniel Steed does not believe him and hangs up. After he kills two other men, Vlad and Anton, Knox brings the latter's body to a balcony and throws him down, smashing into concession stands and thereby summoning the police.\nSeeing this, Arkady and the other mercenaries infiltrate the news studio and kill the crew. Arkady has a reporter read a statement at gunpoint, demanding Dimitri's location, or they will blow up the stadium. As he finishes the statement, Arkady kills the reporter and two others on live television, which Danni's mom sees and prompts her to leave for the stadium. Steed is approached by Agent Cho, who explains that Dimitri fled Russia undercover, underwent plastic surgery, and was given amnesty in London. Cho says that he cannot meet the demands as handing Dimitri to Arkady will plunge the entire Russian region into chaos, endangering millions. Arkady's team learns the background of Knox and Danni, and they decide to take Danni hostage. Hearing them summoning Danni over the speaker, Knox rescues her with help from Faisal.\nBecause Thompson's team failed to capture Danni, Arkady executes him. Knox, Faisal, and Danni ultimately discover the C4 explosives planted below the control room, and Knox alerts Steed about it. Given the urgency of the situation, Knox asks Cho to give him Dimitri's location in the stadium, so he can take him to en extraction point himself. In exchange, he demands that Danni be exfiltrated with Dimitri. On his way, Knox encounters and fights Tatiana, ultimately escaping and finding Dimitri. Meanwhile, Tatiana takes Danni hostage and knocks Faisal unconscious. Knox fights more men and gets to the extraction point, but is reluctant to let go of Dimitri, as the latter is his only bargaining chip to get Danni back. In response, Cho has his men shoot at Dimitri to ensure he is not captured by Arkady. However, the incoming mercenaries fend off the helicopter. After they threaten Danni, Knox agrees to hand over Dimitri in exchange for her. Steed berates Cho for risking the lives of innocent people and takes control of the situation. A helicopter comes back and kills most of the other mercenaries, but Dimitri and Danni are captured. After Knox struggles with Tatiana, they both fall from a higher point in the stadium and she is fatally impaled by a pipe.

But unwilling to let Arkady's madness destroy the region with another revolution, Dimitri shoots himself. With just a few minutes left, Faisal is able to evacuate the audience that is near the stadium's control room. Arkady takes control of the live broadcast holding onto Danni as Knox runs towards the control room from across the field, but he's too late and the bomb goes off, destroying the control room.\nBut as he starts to mourn, Knox looks more closely at the frozen big screen which was not destroyed and notices a time difference in two clocks, realising that the live broadcast was pre-recorded 85 minutes into the match, and that both of them are probably alive. As the crowd stampedes towards exits, Knox hears Danni crying out and confronts Arkady. With a gun to her head, Knox tells Danni to \"use her head\" - she gets the hint and head butts Arkady, sending him briefly reeling and Knox kills him.

Grief-stricken and suspecting he has been grounded, Armstrong applies for Project Gemini and is accepted to NASA Astronaut Group 2. With his wife Janet, and their son Rick, Armstrong moves to Houston alongside other astronaut families. He befriends Elliot See, another civilian test pilot, and Ed White. As Armstrong begins training, Deke Slayton impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the Soviet Union had reached every milestone in the Space Race ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark.\nIn 1965, after the Soviets complete the first extravehicular activity (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will command Gemini 8, with David Scott as the pilot. Prior to the mission, See and Charles Bassett are killed in a T-38 crash, deepening Armstrong's grief at the string of recent losses. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on Gemini 8 and dock with the Agena target vehicle, but soon afterward, a malfunction causes the spacecraft to roll at an increasingly dangerous rate. After nearly blacking out, Armstrong activates the RCS thrusters and safely aborts the mission. He initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault and the mission is rated a \"success\".\nLater, White reveals that he has been selected for the Apollo 1 mission, along with Gus Grissom and Roger Chaffee. During a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a fire kills White and the Apollo 1 crew. Armstrong learns the news while representing NASA at the White House.

As the mission nears, Neil becomes increasingly preoccupied and emotionally distant from his family. Prior to the launch, Janet confronts Armstrong about the possibility that he might not survive the flight and insists that he explain the risks of the mission to their young sons. After telling them about the risks he faces, Armstrong says goodbye to his family.\nThree days after launch, Apollo 11 enters lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the Lunar Module Eagle and begin the landing. The landing site terrain turns out to be much rougher than expected, forcing Armstrong to take manual control of the spacecraft.

An NFFA employee tells Skeletor that he can very soon.\nTwo years later, in 2016, NFFA chief of staff Arlo Sabian and sociologist Dr. May Updale announce an experiment to take place on Staten Island where for 12 hours, citizens will be allowed to purge and release their inhibitions in any way they choose, including murder. The NFFA offers residents $5,000 to stay during the experiment, with additional compensation if they join the purge and survive. They also outfit the participants with contact lens cameras so that they can monitor all activity and put tracking devices in them so they will know if they try to leave the island.\nLow-lying drug kingpin and businessman Dmitri tells his dealers that they will not be leaving the island, as moving his large amounts of money and product will draw too much attention, and tells them to stay in a safe house and lay low. Dealer Capital A decides to defy this order and go out and purge, while newbie dealer Isaiah is attacked and injured by Skeletor. Isaiah goes to his sister Nya, an anti-Purge activist and Dmitri's ex-girlfriend, for treatment. As people flee Staten Island, Nya joins her friends Dolores, Luisa, and Selina in a church to wait out the Purge. Dmitri has stayed behind; Anna and Elsa, two prostitutes, are sent by his dealers to his office to keep him company. Skeletor commits the first Purge murder, and the video recorded by the NFFA goes viral. The NFFA also observe that most of the crimes taking place are minor ones such as looting, vandalism, disorderly conduct, and public disturbances like loud parties, as opposed to the expected violent ones like murder.\nIsaiah secretly joins the Purge to get his revenge on Skeletor.  He eventually confronts him during the Purge but cannot shoot him. Isaiah runs off and into more purgers, before hiding and calling Nya for help. Anna and Elsa are revealed to be Purgers who attempt to kill Dmitri, but Dmitri fights them off and learns that Capital A had sent them in an attempt to take over Dmitri's business. Skeletor captures Nya in the streets and attempts to rape her, but Isaiah wounds him and they escape. Capital A and his crew go to Dmitri's office to thank Anna and Elsa for killing Dmitri, but Dmitri and his gang ambush him and kill them all, except for Anna and Elsa, who are told to never return to Staten Island. Nya and Isaiah return to the church to see blood-soaked white supremacist bikers leaving it. Although Nya's friend Luisa and her daughter Selina survive, Dolores' fate is unknown. They all return to Nya's apartment, where Dolores eventually manages to make it safely.\nMeanwhile, at the NFFA headquarters, Updale becomes suspicious of a sudden increase in murder, along with the presence of masked participants. As she reviews the video footage of the Purge and notices vans full of masked killers arriving, she realizes to her horror that the  masked participants are trained mercenary groups killing multiple civilians. Sabian explains that he sent the mercenaries to make the experiment look successful, and eventually to help balance the wealth disequilibrium amongst the rich and the poor. Updale protests this tampering, realizing that the NFFA only wants to eradicate the poor to save the expense of social programs. Knowing that his corruption has been exposed, Sabian has Updale taken to Staten Island and executed, before erasing all footage of the event.\nDmitri and his gang escape through the streets, until unknown assailants attack them. Dmitri disposes of them all and discovers they are mercenaries. Realizing they were sent by the NFFA, who had also dumped weapons into the neighborhood to provoke participation, Dmitri and his crew decide to take a stand against them and protect the neighborhood. After saving local shop owner and friend Freddy and his associates, they go to Nya's apartment building to try and save her and her friends, but NFFA drones shoot and kill most of Dmitri's gang.

Leading up to the formal launch of his campaign in April 1987, some of Hart's campaign staff are concerned that he won't open up about himself (letting the public \"get to know him\"), instead focusing on ideas and policy. Meanwhile, at The Washington Post, editors and journalists discuss whether the paper should report on Hart's marital problems and rumoured promiscuity.\nAfter the first week of campaigning, Hart joins his friend Billy Broadhurst for a yacht cruise from Miami to Bimini on the Monkey Business, where he meets Donna Rice, a young woman. Days later at an array of pay-phones in an airport, two reporters (A.J. Parker of the Post and Tom Fiedler of the Miami Herald) overhear Hart's end of a conversation, presumably with Rice.\nOn the campaign plane, Hart gets to know Parker, offering paternal advice and giving the young reporter a Tolstoy novel to learn about the Soviets. Later, in Iowa, Parker offends Hart during an interview by asking whether he has \"a traditional marriage\". Hart responds: \"You want to know what I'm doing in my spare time, A.J., is that it? Follow me around, put a tail on me. You'd be very bored.\"\nMeanwhile, in Miami, Tom Fiedler has received an anonymous call from a young woman alleging that Hart \"is having an affair with a friend of mine\". Fiedler dismisses the call at first, but ends up tracking two women on a flight to Washington, D.C., and staking out Hart's townhouse, where he sees Hart go out and come back with Rice. Hart eventually notices Fiedler's car and there is a confrontation, during which Fiedler asks about the woman and Hart denies any wrongdoing and asserts that his personal life is nobody's business. Knowing the story will hit the news, Hart phones his wife, Lee Hart, and apologizes.\nAfter the story appears in the Herald, Lee and daughter Andrea are besieged by reporters outside their home in Troublesome Gulch, Colorado. Meanwhile, in D.C., campaign staffer Irene Kelly is tasked with befriending Rice to try to get information from her, after which she sends Rice back to Miami, where her privacy is torn to shreds by the press.\nHart argues with his campaign manager, Bill Dixon, about whether to respond to the Herald story. Dixon thinks Hart needs to speak out to control the damage, but Hart vehemently argues that any response at all would legitimize the reporters' action and set a dangerous precedent.\nThe Post receives an anonymous package with photos taken months previous of Hart with another woman. Parker argues that reporting on this aspect of Hart's life is not good journalism, but the editor, Ben Bradlee, overrules him, indicating that they need to change with the times.\nWhile preparing for a press conference, Hart's campaign team notes that polls show a majority of the public believes the media has gone too far in their coverage of Hart and that a candidate's marital indiscretions are irrelevant to their qualifications for being president. When told that reporters may ask whether he has ever cheated on his wife, Hart strongly retorts, \"It's nobody's goddamn business!\", which the team agrees is the perfect answer. Then Lee arrives, and the staff leaves. She tells Hart that she may leave him eventually, but not now.\nAt the press conference, it is Parker who asks whether Hart has committed adultery. Instead of giving the rehearsed answer, Hart weakly stammers that he doesn't think it is a fair question. Later, Parker asks for comment from the campaign on the anonymous photos the Post received.\nSeeing how upset Lee is over the public scrutiny and its negative impacts on their family, Hart drops out of the campaign.

Haruo reunites with some of his teammates while they were confronted by who they later learned to be Miana's twin sister Maina before being captured by the latter's hunting party. The group are reunited with Martin Lazzari whose platoon have been healed by the twins' people who are known as the \"Houtua\", surviving descendants of humans who remained on Earth and safeguard the egg of their fallen deity.\nThe group are telepathically questioned by the twins and the Houtua leaders over why they burned their lands, letting them go once Haruo explains they were only attacking Godzilla. Accompanied by Miana and Maina as their protective guides and observers, the twins revealing they can also speak verbally, Haruo's group reunites with Metphies and the other survivors during an encounter with the Servum. During the fight, Galu-Gu realizes that the twins' arrowheads are laced with \"nanometal\", the nanotechnology used to create Mechagodzilla. Galu-Gu explains that the nanometal somehow survived and expanded itself over the past 20 millennia. Haruo is convinced by Galu-Gu to remain on Earth and resume the plan to kill Godzilla, sending a few crew members back to the Aratrum. The group trace the energy signature to the rebuilt facility that held Mechagodzilla, which Galu-Gu christens \"Mechagodzilla City\". The twins part ways with the group while warning Haruo that the nanometal is poisonous; the Bilusaludo assuring the group that the technology is only harmful to Godzilla.\nThe team soon finds that the surviving half of Mechagodzilla's head is the source of the nanometal as Galu-Gu accesses Mechagodzilla's brain to construct all necessary materials to trap Godzilla within the city and cover it with nanometal to finish it off with EMP harpoons. While overseeing the construction, her mech suit modified into one of three Vulture exo-armors, Yuko confesses her feelings for Haruo and kisses him. Feeling slightly ill since entering the city like some of the others, Haruo finds Metphies working in a cave to repair an item with some of Galu-Gu's technology. Metphies cryptically hints the Bilusaludo's motives of becoming monsters themselves due to their obsession with logic, confiding to Haruo the name of a greater terror than Godzilla that destroyed his homeworld: \"Ghidorah\".\nAs Godzilla awakens, most of the human members are horrified to learn that most of the Bilusaludo had willingly allowed themselves to be assimilated into Mechagodzilla City to further fortify it. Godzilla's quick advance on the city forces Galu-Gu to sacrifice the city's defenses in order to divert power to finish the harpoon while Haruo, Yuko and Belu-be use the Vultures to slow Godzilla down. Though the trio managed to hold Godzilla for the plan to go underway, Godzilla survives the trap and proceeds to overheat the facility. This forces a defiant Galu-Gu to fuse with the nanometal as the humans escape the city. Galu-Gu then has the Vultures absorb their pilots to use as sacrificial spears to kill Godzilla.\nHaruo is unaffected while Yuko is being slowly converted against her will. Metphies warns a conflicted Haruo that Mechagodzilla City will consume Earth if not stopped and that its destruction could save Yuko, Galu-Gu arguing that transcending their humanity is the only way to kill Godzilla. Haruo ultimately decides to fight Godzilla with his humanity intact, the destruction of Galu-Gu and the command center rendering the nanometal inert as Godzilla frees itself and destroys the city.

On Earth, Haruo learns from Dr. Martin that Yuko is rendered brain-dead with the nanometal in her body keeping her alive. He also learns that those treated by the Houtua survived the nanometal's attempt to absorb them, with Methphies deceiving the survivors into believing their survival was divine intervention. When confronted by Haruo about converting the remaining humans, Methphies reveals his plan to bring the Exifs' god to Earth and needs Haruo's help to make it possible. Dr. Martin advises Haruo to hide until tensions ease.\nHaruo is escorted to a remote camp by the Houtua twins, Maina and Miana. Miana explains privately to Haruo that her people have no concept of hatred and that their concept of life revolves around \"winning\" (surviving and making life) or \"losing\" (dying and disappearing). She tells Haruo that he is \"losing\" and offers to \"connect life\" with him, but he turns her down.

Ghidorah manifests as a shadow on Earth and partially through singularities, devouring Metphies's followers and destroying the Aratrum. Ghidorah then proceeds to attack Godzilla, who is helpless against the intangible monster as its heads bite Godzilla and drain his energy. Dr. Martin concludes that Ghidorah's true form exists in another plane of existence and is being guided by someone in their universe, Haruo finding it to be Metphies who had replaced his right eye with the amulet he repaired with the nanometal. Metphies proceeds to reveal that his people devoted themselves to Ghidorah since learning that their universe is finite and fated to destruction, having offered planets for the monster to feed on. Proceeding to telepathically assault Haruo, Metphies explains that the human's hatred towards Godzilla made him an ideal offering and tells Haruo that he must submit himself to Ghidorah as its witness to enable its full manifestation.\nMaina and Dr. Martin use the Houtuan god's egg to psychically reach Haruo and reveal how to stop Ghidorah, Haruo learning that Metphies orchestrated the deaths of the Tau Ceti e exploration party so they could be \"saved\". At the same time, Haruo recalls the charm he lost the day he fled from Earth as a boy. Its image of flowers reminds him of the meaning of his name, \"Spring\", and the power of hope to overcome despair. Haruo then breaks free and cracks Metphies' amulet, causing Ghidorah to become affected by Earth's physics, and as such being ultimately defeated by Godzilla. Metphies dies telling Haruo that Ghidorah will always be watching him as long as he lives.\nTime passes as survivors bury their weapons and integrate into Houtua society, with Maina pregnant with Haruo's child. Dr. Martin tells Haruo that he got the last remaining Vulture mech working, having discovered how to use Mechagodzilla's nanometal in Yuko's body as a tool to rebuild civilization as it was. Haruo's right eye stings, hearing Metphies's voice that this turn of events would ensure Ghidorah's eventual return to their reality. Taking Yuko with him, Haruo provokes Godzilla into destroying him and all traces of the living nanometal for the good of the Houtua. This prevents Ghidorah from returning as the Houtua continue to live alongside Godzilla; treating the kaiju like a natural disaster to be respected and avoided but not warred with.\nIn a post-credits scene taking place years later, Maina, showing signs of advancing age, watches a group of children conduct a ritual honoring Haruo, placing knotted strings representing their fears into a fire under a wooden effigy of a Vulture mech.

In the 175th application, Arjun mentions his father's name and gets recruited by the RAW's secret weapon Trinetra. At first, Sathya doesn't accept Arjun's decision for fear of losing him, but Arjun tells about his passion for serving the nation like Raghuveer and Sathya relents.

They implemented an operation Mission Gopi. Arjun notices an Al-Mujahideen member, Hamza, near the Trinetra office and follows him. After some chase and struggle, he obtains a clue 1112 from the agent. Trinetra assumes that it is an attack plan on 11 December, but can't find the target of this attack, so they keep a close watch. During graduation, Acharya, a senior official and founder of Trinetra attends as a chief guest of the ceremony. Sameera suggests that Arjun presents a Jameson Irish Whiskey bottle to Damodar. At graduation, all recruits get their postings: Mohammad Basha is selected for primary security detail, including escorting Acharya. Leena Raajan is assigned to the reconnaissance team in Dhaka through the Indian embassy. Arjun gets selected as a top spy as he achieved the training without any weakness. He is presented with a Trinetra agency number 116 as a covert operative, his primary job is to infiltrate, recon, sabotage, and assassinate, all behind the enemy lines. RAW would disavow him if he gets caught. He is assisted by his former trainers Nadia Qureshi, who oversees the operations, and Shaam, her trusted aid and technical lead. \nAfter the inauguration and reaching home, Arjun realizes he misinterpreted the clue (the code is reverse\u2014The code is 12 November, not 11 December), and that fateful day is the graduation day and that Acharya himself is the target. Arjun tries to warn Basha, but the convoy gets attacked where Basha and Acharya are killed while the assailants flee. At the same time in the Trinetra office, Damodar sips the Whiskey, which was presented by Arjun, and has a conversation with his friend Sathya, who is an ex-RAW agent and Arjun's uncle. Suddenly, Damodar starts choking where he collapses down and dies, revealing that the whisky is poisoned. Arjun learns from the news that he has been framed as the kingpin of the attack, and PMO issues an arrest warrant against him. Simultaneously, Arjun gets attacked by the Al-Mujahideen members and Sameera dies in that attack. Arjun manages to defeat and escape from the commandos, and he leaves for Rajahmundry, to meet Sathya. They both deduce that there is a mole in Trinetra. Arjun decides to investigate Rana and the mole's identities. Based on clues, he leaves for Visakhapatnam. \nMeanwhile, Nadia and Shaam are appointed to catch Arjun. In a media primetime watch, a reporter shows that Arjun is in Rajahmundry on their channel. Shaam travels to Rajahmundry to trace Arjun. Meanwhile, through a phone call received by Nadia on Arjun's phone, she learns that he has a personal locker in a private bank. Nadia opens the locker and finds out about Arjun's past. Rana makes a plan to nab Arjun through his spy Khan. Khan sees Arjun in a market and chases him, but Arjun manages to escape from him successfully and reaches the Visakhapatnam airport to escape, but the local police are searching for him at the airport. Arjun finds Sameera's uncle and confronts him, but Sameera's uncle commits suicide by consuming cyanide. When checking the purse, Arjun finds out Sameera Rao's real identity (Sameera Sheikh). She is a psychology graduate at Harvard who belongs to Chittagong, Bangladesh. With the help of Sathya, he understands that Sameera was also a member of Al-Mujahideen and that he was completely trapped by them. He escapes successfully from the local police and reached Chittagong via sea route and meets his colleague Leena Raajan. Leena believes Arjun is innocent and helps him to find the truth. \nMeanwhile, with a minor clue, Shaam finds out about Sathya's hideout and informs Nadia. At the same time, in Chittagong, Leena and Arjun find out about Sameera's psychology clinic. Leena asks everyone about Sameera as her friend, which is noticed by the sleeper cells. They follow Leena and attack her, but Arjun rescues her, and he infiltrates the headquarters of Al-Mujahideen with Leena's help and finds some DVDs in the hideout. Leena is attacked by Khan and is severely injured. Arjun rescues her again and kills Khan, where he destroys the Al-Mujahideen's headquarters. Arjun finds the training videos of the terrorists and propaganda in a secret locker at the camp. In a video shop, he watches all the old CDs which he has found in the hideout. All the CDs mentioned about Al-Mujahideen show how they brainwashed people into becoming terrorists in the training, and it reveals Al-Mujahideen chief Rana's face. Arjun is shocked and calls Sathya and asks about Raghuveer. Satya reveals that Rana is none other than Raghuveer, who is Sathya's former friend, ex-Trinetra agent, and Arjun's father. \n20 years ago in Sikkim, Sathya had received information about a Trinetra agent, who was working as a covert to Al-Mujahideen. To find out about him, Sathya arrived with his team to catch them and noticed Raghuveer giving all the details of Trinetra agents and their offices. Satya's colleague Vijay started firing on them. In the ensuing shootout, Raghuveer and Satya remain, where Raghuveer tried to kill the wounded Satya, but he was shot from the backside by Vijay before he died. Raghuveer then jumped into the river and Sathya thought he was dead and the information which has leaked by him to the terrorists. Sathya informed to shut down the entire Trinetra agency and didn't revealed to anyone that Raghuveer is Rana as he feared that Al-Mujahideen members might try to take Arjun. To save Arjun, he resigned from RAW and started a secret life with Arjun, changed their identities, and moved to Rajahmundry, and became his father to the world. To divert Al-Mujahideen, Sathya created a fake news that they both died in a car accident. Later, Trinetra was completely shut down from that day onwards and was relaunched by the RAW in 2008. \nAfter hearing this, Arjun confesses that Raghuveer is alive. Rana bargers into Sathya's hideout and instructs Arjun to arrive at his secret base. Arjun reaches Rana's base. Rana reveals that he acted as an Indian spy to spy on RAW, but felt dejected after hearing about his son's death, but he learns that Arjun is alive through the RAW application form. Rana announces that he has his members in Trinetra too, and he decided to kill all the people who are responsible for hiding his son and decided to bring his son back permanently. He reveals that everything was set up by him until now. In the beginning, he uses Sameera to act as Arjun's girlfriend to get information on Gopi and Satya, but she changed her mind and started liking Arjun. According to his plan, he tried to kill Satya, Damodar and Acharya at the same time. However, Sameera managed to resist Sathya for a visit and she didn't inject anesthesia to Arjun or else he can kidnap him and killed all of them in one shot, but couldn't have been possible. Thus, Rana killed her and shifted to PLAN-B. According to that, Arjun wants to search for Raghuveer by himself and played all the tricks to find for himself.  \nLater, Raghuveer points his gun at Sathya and orders Arjun to come with him. Arjun reveals that Trinetra is watching everything and the soldiers arrive to attack the Al-Mujahideen forces. After the attack, Rana escapes with Satya, followed by Arjun. After a rough chase, The wounded Rana again points his gun at Sathya to force Arjun to come with him. Arjun remembers Damodar's words and shoots Raghuveer to death. A week later, Arjun reveals that Basha confessed his conversation with Arjun to Nadia before his death. Then she tracked Arjun's phone and found Sathya's number. Sathya warns Nadia about the mole in Trinetra. Nadia had helped Arjun through Leena secretly. Finally, Arjun confesses that he found the mole in Trinetra and the culprit is going to die in a few minutes. Arjun reveals that Shaam is the culprit. He observed in the DVDs (with the kids who are brainwashed) where the boy, who is getting trained in the terrorist camp and reveals his name as Shaam. Shaam raises his gun to shoot Arjun, but Arjun reminds him that Trinetra is always watching. \nThe Trinetra officers shoot Shaam to death. In Mount Alps, Arjun decided to leave Trinetra, but Nadia reminds Arjun of Acharya's words about responsibilities towards the nation and makes him confident.

Though apparently struggling, they wish to stay rather than go to New Eden. With the help of his friend Agent Porter, he delays sending in his report so the boy can perform at a musical recital the following day; Kross fondly remembers fishing in Canada as a boy and wants Lucas to have a positive memory of his recital. This act of minor insubordination upsets the Bureau and catches the attention of Kross\u2019s supervisor Adam, who places him under investigation.  Rachel's resistance to relocation and the \"truth\" purported by Chester motivate Kross to investigate New Eden.  A defense contractor working for the bureau gives Kross a memory card.\nThe next day, Kross attends Lucas' recital and spends the night with them.  When he wakes up the next morning, he sees the Bureau coming and rushes inside to get Rachel and Lucas.  Rachel is being held hostage by Adam.

The Bureau's director opens a package of what looks like dust in front of him and shows Adam a child's tooth, warning him that if he fails again, he will end up in New Eden, revealed to be an extermination camp where unproductive citizens are incinerated.  Kross has learned the truth and seeks to save Lucas and Rachel.\nDuring their flight, Kross trades his Bureau vehicle for an unmarked station wagon and learns of a man who may know a way north.  When they find the man, they learn that the way north to Canada is highly irradiated and that no one who ever goes returns.  When he insists, the man gives Kross a geiger counter to measure radiation, and iodine tablets which provide some protection against radiation absorption.  Kross gives Lucas a rabbit's foot for good luck during the trip.\nAlong the road, they spot a drone searching for Kross.  After becoming tired and frustrated waiting for it to pass, Kross and Rachel get into an argument where Kross reveals that he knows the real Rachel Weller, and this woman is not her.  Years ago on a Bureau investigation, Kross and the real Rachel conceived a child, who is Lucas.  When the famine struck, Rachel tried to sell Lucas. Amanda, her neighbor, got into an argument over this and the resulting fight ended in Rachel's death. Amanda then assumed Rachel's identity and raised Lucas as her own.\nThe three continue to evade the Bureau and eventually make it to a nuclear power plant, which the man warned them was highly irradiated.

Lucas runs away and Kross gives Adam the card, which Adam scans to find out is empty. Adam executes Kross and Lucas comes running back.

During a party given at the home of Brando, Natasha lights up a fire to create a stir so as to be able to stun Michele, who wakes up in the bedroom of an abandoned noble house, and finds Natasha and a woman named Yelena, who reveals to him that the girl is his sister and that she is their mother. In the meantime, some Specials scattered around the world are kidnapped.\nYelena explains to Michele that she needs blood transfusions from him and Natasha in order to be able to reinforce since she is belonging to the typology of first-generation specials. Transfusions are performed by the Doctor KA, a doctor belonging to the \"normal\" who has worked with Yelena for some time; she tells her son that Andrey has been mysteriously kidnapped and is convinced that the abductor is the cruel Igor Zavarov, a Russian oligarch known to her as a bitter enemy and exploiter of the Specials. Yelena's plan is to help kidnap Zavarov with the help of Michele and Natasha in order to stop his campaign against the Specials and save Andrey. The kidnapping must be carried out while Zavarov is in Trieste for the inauguration of his new pipeline and Yelena entrusts Michele with the task of entering the offices of the police station and stealing the security plans for the day of the inauguration of the gas pipeline, discovering the exact movements of Zavarov. Through his invisibility, Michele succeeds very well in the task by making his mother proud of him.\nThe family begin to know each other and love each other: the two siblings are confiding some of the key episodes of their lives lived in those years. Natasha says she was taken to Morocco and entrusted to a good woman, who later died. Her brother became the legal guardian of Natasha and began to mistreat her until she tried to take advantage of her. This until the girl discovered her power, just before being saved by her mother; one day Natasha is also intrigued by a talisman spotted in a jewellery store, Michele uses his power to steal it for her and, together, deliver the jewel to their mother who, joyful to be re-forming her family, wear it saying that she would have never taken it off.\nThat night Yelena remembers the events following the flight with Andrey and the children. While the man had managed to save himself, Yelena had been captured again and locked up in an institute where, with the arrival of Zavarov, the experiments on Specials to try to understand the origin of their power became real torture.

The Specials took the power of the fortress but they could not stop Zavarov who therefore saved himself on a helicopter. While most of the Specials decided to return to life by hiding their skills, Yelena wanted to find her children, with the help of Artiglio and Doctor KA.\nOnce the time for the inauguration of the gas pipeline has arrived, Yelena and Natasha tell Michele to say goodbye to anyone belonging to his past life and Michele goes to the gym where Stella and his friend Candela rehearse their last issue of artistic gymnastics, so as to see for the last time the girl he loved. As he is about to leave, the boy notices a man and a woman, Cinetica and Morpheus, stealing a wallet through her paranormal modalities and, recognizing them as Specials, the boy follows them. The two enter the villa where Michele lives with his mother and sister and follows them down to the basement, where a meeting is held in which there are Yelena, Natasha, Doctor KA and the Specials who had been kidnapped in Europe. Yelena, who is the leader of the group, exposes an extreme plan that shows how the tortures by Zavarov had made her so rebellious that she became even cruel: at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, the group will go to the warehouse where it is located the generator plant and pour inside it an explosive substance which will be driven by the intensity of the fire of Natasha and provoke a great explosion that will exterminate in addition to Zavarov even a large part of the population of Trieste. So it was Yelena who kidnapped the Specials so that they could use them as allies in that operation that will serve to destroy a good part of the normals that Zavarov belongs to and give the sign of the supremacy of the Specials over them. Michele now knows the truth and would like to warn the police but Natasha, bequeathed by Andrey, can hear her brother's thoughts and spots him out.\nMichele is locked in the cell in the basement, reproaches his mother of not being able to act in the first person being too weak to do it, and Yelena gives him a bitter news: Doctor KA has managed to combine the DNA of Second Generation Specials of Natasha and Michele in a machine called UTERO, thanks to which Yelena and the Special allies have regained their full strength. That's why the mother so badly needed her children. Natasha, who had not had an acceptable life like that of Michele, is determined to follow her mother to the end while the boy discovers that next to his cell is the one in which his father is locked up, kidnapped by his mother and segregated there for all the time as for not having approved the extreme rebellion of Yelena.

Yelena turns invisible and brings a burning beam to the generator; Andrey finds and hears the thoughts of the woman, identifies her and starts to chase her.

Atari decides to continue his search for Spots, and the pack decides to help him. Chief initially declines but is then convinced by Nutmeg, a female ex-show dog, to help the boy out of obligation. The pack seeks advice from sage-like dogs Jupiter and Oracle, who surmise that Spots might be held captive by an isolated tribe of dogs rumored to be cannibals.\nMeanwhile, Watanabe finally develops a successful serum and shows the results to Kobayashi, who only dismisses him. The professor objects, only to be put under house arrest and killed by a piece of poisoned sushi by order of the mayor's hatchet man, Major Domo. Tracy Walker, an American exchange student and member of a pro-dog activist group, suspects a conspiracy and begins to investigate. In the process of investigating, she gains feelings for Atari. Kobayashi and his political party are revealed to actually be responsible for the dog flu outbreak, seeking to eliminate the dogs after Kobayashi's cat-loving ancestors tried to do 1,000 years previously; they were foiled by a child samurai resembling Atari.\nDuring their journey, Chief and Atari are separated from the others. Atari gives Chief a bath, revealing his white and black-spotted coat and thus his striking resemblance to Spots. The two bond and rejoin the rest of the pack, and are saved by Spots and the dog tribe from another rescue team. Spots confirms that he is Chief's older brother and that he was rescued by the tribe, who were test subjects from a secret lab that was abandoned after a tsunami. Spots became their leader and mated with a female tribe member named Peppermint, who is pregnant with their first litter. Because of these circumstances, Spots requests for Atari to transfer his protection duties to Chief. Chief is initially hesitant, but both he and Atari accept, and bodyguard duties are officially transferred to Chief. An owl later brings word that Kobayashi has rounded up all the exiled dogs and plans to exterminate them with poison gas.\nTracy confronts Watanabe's closest colleague Yoko Ono, who confirms Tracy's conspiracy theories and gives her the last vial of serum. At his re-election ceremony, Kobayashi prepares to give the extermination order when Tracy presents her evidence of his corruption. Kobayashi proceeds to deport Tracy, but before he can do so, Atari and the dogs arrive. They confirm the serum works by testing it on Chief and curing him. Atari addresses the crowd and recites a haiku he wrote and dedicated to Kobayashi, rekindling the sympathy that once existed between dogs and humans. Touched by Atari's words, Kobayashi officially rescinds the dog ban. Enraged, Major Domo yells at Mayor Kobayashi for breaking the Mayor's campaign promise and tries to kill Kobayashi and initiate the extermination himself, but thanks to Spots and the activists, Domo's plans are thwarted. Atari and Spots become gravely injured during the struggle and are taken to a hospital, where Kobayashi donates one of his kidneys to save his nephew. It is later revealed that while Kobayashi did win the election, he won't hold office because he was caught in a scandal. Therefore, all mayoral powers and authorities will transfer to his next-in-line, Atari.\nOne month later, Atari officially becomes the new mayor of Megasaki, and has all dogs reintegrated into society and cured of the dog flu, while Kobayashi and his propagandists and co-conspirators are sent to jail for political corruption, doing 30 days of community service, and paying fines of no less than \u00a5250,000 while Major Domo faces a possible death sentence. Tracy and Atari become a couple, while Chief and Nutmeg become their bodyguard dogs and begin a relationship. Meanwhile, Spots (recovering from his injuries) has had a statue erected in his honor and resumes raising his litter with Peppermint under the care of a priest at a Shinto temple.", "tmdb_id": 399174}, "57741412": {"title": "It Comes", "plot": "A couple must protect their 2-year-old daughter's life from a monster called Bogiwan.", "tmdb_id": 505916}, "57828074": {"title": "J'ai perdu Albert", "plot": "Chloe, a young medium that the great business leaders, politicians and the jet set snapped up, shelters in her since childhood the spirit of Albert Einstein.

Seeking proof, they must infiltrate Volta's mansion. In preparation, English is given a virtual reality exploration of the building. However, he unintentionally leaves the simulation room, assaulting various people while in the virtual environment (including battering the manager of a local cafe with two baguettes, and commandeering an Open Top Routemaster by pushing the tour guide off the top deck).A group of people see him pushing the man off the top deck in a meeting room.\nArriving at the mansion, English discovers Bhuletova is also a spy. He records evidence of Volta's plans with her iPhone, but accidentally presses the wrong button, playing music from the phone and exposing himself. English escapes, hijacking a driving instructor's car, returning to MI7 after being chased by Volta. However, he mixes up iPhones with the driving student, so fails to convince MI7 and the Prime Minister of Volta's schemes. Hearing of both the restaurant and virtual reality incidents, she fires English, Bough and Pegasus and proceeds with the G12 meeting in Scotland. Bough convinces him to stop Volta anyway, enlisting his wife Lydia's aid, a Navy captain of submarine HMS Vengeance, to arrive at Garroch Castle via Loch Nevis.\nBhuletova attempts to kill Volta but, knowing she is a spy, he has immunized himself to her poison ring and removed her gun's firing pin. Scaling the castle using a powered bodysuit, English intervenes before Volta can kill her, who escapes. Volta plans to extort the G12 leaders by threatening to shut down the internet. English calls MI7, but forgets Lydia's warning about using a mobile near the submarine.\nAn MI7 secretary unintentionally places two telephones next to each other: one on a call from English, the other from Lydia, calling to confirm a launch code English inadvertently keyed in.

When Volta mocks English's inability to use digital technology, he throws the tablet at Volta, hitting him in the head and knocking him out, then smashes his phone with a sword to stop the attack. The Prime Minister praises and forgives English for his attitude, who accidentally disrobes before the press and G12 leaders while removing the armor.\nEnglish returns to his school as a guest speaker, welcomed by his students.

As the Union government bothered to ban the book and desperately tried to burn every single copy of it, the channel undertakes an initiative to acquire knowledge about K.G.F by interviewing an aged Anand and hires the most reputed and short-tempered Deepa Hegde to interview him. \nIn the interview, Anand narrates that Suryavardhan, an authoritative crime boss and politician in southern Mysore State exterminated a group of government officials, who had discovered an ore of gold with the intent of resorting to illegal mining. The same day, a poverty-stricken woman named Shanthamma delivered her son, at a very young age; the son was named Raja Krishnappa Bairya. Later, Suryavardhan leased the land under the pretext of operating Narachi, a limestone mine for ninety-nine years; he, however established K.G.F. Suryavardhan had five associates to steer his empire:- Rajendra Desai oversaw the transportation of refined gold bars to Bangalore and Mumbai from the industry at Varca; Kamal, son of Suryavardhan's deceased associate Bhargav, was fostered by Desai after Bhargav's demise and handled the industry situated in Varca; Andrews superintended the transport of refined gold to the western coast of the country; Suryavardhan was politically backed by Guru Pandian, the President of ruling party - DYSS; Suryavardhan's younger brother Adheera supervised the security of K.G.F and was infamous for his ruthlessness. \nRaja Krishnappa Bairya, after Shanthamma's death, was inspired to \"die lavishly\" like his mother wanted and arrived at Bombay in quest for power and wealth, opting an epithet Rocky at the age of ten. Employed by a gold smuggler and Andrews's underboss Shetty who competed against Dubai-based mafia kingpin Inayat Khalil, Rocky rose through ranks and was known for his fearlessness and strength and oversaw the arrival of gold bars from Africa to the coast of Bombay. Rocky's image began to overpower that of Shetty, much to Shetty's envy. \nAfter Suryavardhan had a stroke, he designated his elder son Garuda as the apparent heir to K.G.F asking Adheera to be submissive to Garuda but upset with his brother's decision, Adheera orchestrated a murder attempt on Garuda, which did fail. In retaliation, Garuda bombed the convoy, Adheera was travelling in and he was presumed to be dead. As Suravardhan had very little time to live owing to his illness, his associates began to eye the K.G.F and conspired to assassinate Garuda, who vowed to murder them and acquire the control over K.G.F after his father's death. Andrews, meeting Rocky offered him control over Bombay if he would successfully assassinate Garuda. Accepting the offer, Rocky headed to Bangalore and before meeting Desai and others, he got to meet Reena, Desai's daughter and flirted with her, much to the chagrin of her half-brother Kamal and setting up a rivalry between Kamal and Rocky. As per Rocky's plan, Suryavardhan's associates lured Garuda out of K.G.F by deciding to inaugurate a golden statue of Suryavardhan in the DYSS party office. Rocky's attempts to assassinate Garuda in the party office were resisted because of the authority, Garuda commands and his security. Much to the shock and surprise of the associates, the statue inaugurated turned out to be Garuda's while it was meant to be that of Suryavardhan. \nWith no option left, Rocky resorted to intruding Narachi for assassinating Garuda and entered K.G.F by slaying a unit of the security alarming Vanaram, the commander of K.G.F. Citizens of villages neighboring to Narachi were forcefully abducted, taken as slaves for mining gold and subjected to inhumane conditions in K.G.F. Rocky entered K.G.F, disguised as one of the villagers. Initially displaying apathy to the miseries faced by the slaves, Rocky was eventually moved by the killing of a mother and her son as the latter had inadvertently crossed a boundary, which was set up for slaves. Rocky invaded the Maintenance room to access the map of K.G.F. Alarmed that a slave had entered the Maintenance room, Garuda questioned everyone of the newly-brought unit of slaves and a man, who had seen Rocky doing so entrusted him with rescuing his pregnant wife and claimed himself to be the intruder, losing his life consequently to rescue Rocky. The associates were informed that the assassin they sent for was dead and they began to believe that Rocky was killed. \nWhen a ruthless unit of twenty-three guards who attempted to brutally murder a blind slave as the latter could no longer work, Rocky revolted, fought them and burnt them together signalling Virat, Garuda's younger brother and Kulkarni, Garuda's assistant, who were involved with the associates, of his survival. With his act, Rocky was hailed as their messiah by the slaves, who were oppressed for a long period of time. Garuda tried to leave his mansion for investigating the fires but to prevent him, Virat smothered Suryavardhan to death. Concerned about the recent occurrences, Garuda orchestrated a ritual for Kali to be preponed and thought of getting rid of the associates as soon as the ritual ends as he had vowed earlier. Rocky, through a tunnel unsuspected, headed to the place where three men were held captives as Garuda intended to use them for human sacrifice to Kali. Holding back one of them, Rocky disguised himself as the one and went with the other two men to the site of ritual, undetected. Later, Rocky emerged out of his disguise and beheaded Garuda, killing him much to everyone's shock. \nIngalagi, presently, concludes that Rocky intentionally chose not to assassinate Garuda in the party office as he desired for K.G.F and amassed an army for himself by freeing the slaves to seize control over Vanaram's army who would subsequently attack him after Garuda's death and take over K.G.F. Ingalagi indicates that it was just a beginning. \nIn a flashback, the news of Garuda's assassination approached Ramika Sen, a strict politician. Adheera, who was disclosed to be alive planned to resurface while the associates were delighted, intending to take over K.G.F.

Following the call, Mahendra's son Vikramaditya Varma (Neil Nitin Mukesh) informs the police and is accompanied by them to the rendezvous, where Vijay intelligently acquires the ransom without revealing his identity. He deposits the money at the hospital, following which his mother is saved. Vijay drops the girl at a bus stop and informs Mahendra about it. On his way home, he witnesses a car accident. Finding the driver severely injured, Vijay calls the ambulance and sends him to the hospital.\nThe next day, he learns that Samyukta is the actual niece of Mahendra Varma and that he has been framed for kidnapping her. Without revealing his identity, Ajay Bhupathi calls Vijay to tell him his game is over. With the help of his trusted Constable P. Sudarshan, Vijay locates Ajay and thrashes him but is shocked upon first learning he's not the kidnapper and then finding the corpse of the girl he had saved from goons. Upon being noticed, he is chased by cops but is rescued by Vaishnavi (Apoorva Srinivasan), Samyukta's friend. Revealing that Samyukta too loved him, she admits having lied about her engagement in order to test him. She also reveals Samyukta last called from a shopping mall. Through the mall's CCTV footage, Vijay learns of her kidnapping and, by tracing the kidnapper's vehicle number, finds him to be Aravindh, who lives at Aravindh Villa. Along with Vaishnavi, he goes to Aravindh Villa and, by looking at the pictures hanging there, realizes that Aravindh is the same man he had sent to hospital on the night of his accident. He had, however kept his phone with himself in order to answer if his family members called. Vikramaditya is revealed to be the conspirator when he calls on Aravindh's phone, and it's answered by Vijay who reveals the only mistake Vikramaditya made was to call him with the same phone Vijay had asked him to replace his own phone with, while acquiring the ransom.\nVikramaditya then reveals that Samyukta had decided to work as a caf\u00e9 waitress in order to first understand the mindset of her customers, and since his father had chosen her over him to become his company's heir, he conspired to kill her. He first got her kidnapped and then got Vijay, as he loved her, framed for her kidnapping with the help of Lavanya, his girlfriend and the girl he had saved from goons. He also got his mother attacked in order to make him need money and thus execute the fake kidnapping. At the hospital, Aravindh is interrogated by Vikramaditya and reveals he couldn't kill Samyukta as she had tricked him into transferring all his money into her account. Leaving her in a secret chamber and following Vikramaditya's orders, he had gone to kill Lavanya, who in turn attacked him with a stone before getting killed herself. Injured, he couldn't drive properly and met with an accident. Vikramaditya kills Aravindh and informs Vijay about Samyukta's location while arriving at Aravindh villa himself to kill her. Vijay surprises him by revealing he had already rescued her and dropped Vaishnavi at a safe point, telling her to call the police. On his way to meet the commissioner, he learns that his mother has been taken hostage and, along with Samyukta, arrives on the spot where he fights off Vikramaditya and his goons, rescuing his mother and getting Vikramaditya arrested.\nDuring the end credit scenes, Samyukta is declared the heir of S. company and confesses her love to Vijay.", "tmdb_id": 565277}, "55074254": {"title": "Kayamkulam Kochunni (2018 film)", "plot": "At the start, a messenger tells the people of Kayamkulam that Kayamkulam Kochunni, a famed Mappila highwayman of the area, will be executed by hanging. The story then moves into a flashback.\nBaputty, Kochunni's father, is a famed poor thief who struggles to look after his family. One time he gets caught and is beaten up by the local Brahmins in front of Kochunni, who was a young boy at the time. His mother, not wanting him to grow up in abject poverty and suffering the same fate as his father, persuades him to leave home, so Kochunni leaves. He ends up in the house of a local Brahmin landlord and works as an employee in one of the landlord's shops.\nThe film fast-forwards and Kochunni is now an adult. During his time there, Kochunni sees Janaki, a Hindu lower-caste girl who is a servant, and falls in love with her, also learning from her that Thangal, a state-renowned fight master, has opened a school to train students in martial art. After jumping into a well and wrestling with a large python to rescue a boy, he's awarded a medal of bravery by the local British officer and makes a wish that he wants to join in with the dance and celebrations in their local British fort, which the officer grants.\nKochunni goes to the school but is turned away by Thangal on the basis that, like his father, he might become an even bigger thief by learning the martial art. Janaki also confesses her love for him, and with her help, he learns it by sitting and watching the training on a tree next to the school. However, one day he gets caught by Thangal and he tests Kochunni by making him fight the best student at the school, Thananayik Keshava Kurup, which Kochunni wins. Thangal has a change of heart and promises to teach him believing that one day Kochunni will become his successor. Seeing this, Keshava gets angry and leaves the school, threatening Kochunni that they'll meet one day and he will get his revenge.\nDuring a stormy journey from Kochi, Kochunni's beloved caretaker falls into the Kayamkulam Lake. While rescuing him, Kochunni sees a stash of gold at the bottom of the lake. Kochunni reports this to local Brahmin landlords and the Brahmins persuade him to get this gold to them in return for three wishes. He successfully gets the gold to them and they grant him one of the wishes, which was a bag of gold. However, their henchmen beat him up during his return and the Brahmins falsely accuse him on grounds of robbery and punish him by dipping his hand in boiling oil and hanging him upside down for four days. Janaki is then stoned and banished from Kayamkulam for loving a man from another caste much to Kochunni's dismay.\nHowever, on the fourth day Ithikkara Pakki, one of the biggest thief of the place, known for ruthlessly beheading his enemies, comes and frees Kochunni, taking him to Pakki's hideout in the forest. There, he persuades Kochunni to take revenge against the Brahmins by stealing, and he agrees. He is then subjected to intense and hard training by Pakki and his gang of three thieves, Mammad, Kunju Marakkar and Noor Ahmed. He becomes a successful highwayman as well by carrying out robberies against several travelling Brahmins. They then rob several shops of Brahmins in the Kayamkulam market to show their power. Even though they rob many stores, Kochunni refuses to rob his ex-caretaker's store, telling him that he can't watch his beloved ones being attacked by others, unlike what he did when Kochunni was falsely accused by the landlords. One day Kochunni and his friends go to rob a Brahmin's house. They break a wall to go into the house and this woke up some of the Brahmins. Pakki, who saw this, kills some of them. Pakki and his friends enter a room filled with gold. However, the remaining Brahmins see this and try to lock Pakki in the room. Kochunni, seeing this goes to the Brahmin's room and takes the Brahmin's children, and runs away. The Brahmin, seeing this, asks his fellow Brahmins to leave Pakki and his friends to go save his daughter. The Brahmin chases after Kochunni to gain his children. Kochunni does not harm the children and drops them off so the parents can get them back easily. In this time Pakki escapes from the room.\nThen it is the time for Pakki to leave the place. After Pakki leaves, Kochunni becomes the hero for the downtrodden, being a robber for the poor. Keshavan who is out to destroy Kochunni makes several plans to kill him but in vain. Finally he uses Janaki whom Kochunni loved earlier when he was a gentle man. However Kochunni killed the British General and is given the death sentence as he was cheated by his mates who joined Keshavan.\nBack to the present, his capital punishment is fixed and at that time arrives Thangal, his former Kalari Master to see him in jail lastly.

He searched the pockets of the corpse before calling for help, which surprised Buron who insisted on resuming the interrogation.\nBuron goes out for a few moments to talk with his son and takes the opportunity to eat a hot dog. Meanwhile, Philippe, a novice one-eyed policeman, is tasked with monitoring Fugain. Philippe agrees to strike up a conversation and wants to show Fugain his police badge. He stumbles over an open drawer and falls dead, his one eye pierced by a square he held in his hand. Fugain, panicked, hides the body in a cupboard and quickly wipes away the traces of blood.\nBuron returns and continues the interrogation. According to her testimony, Fugain's neighbor says she saw him leave her home seven times during the night. Watching the closet, Fugain explains in detail what he did during the night.

Jack Friar (John Henshaw), a local tradesman and manager of non-league side St Helens Town, spots Trautmann keeping goal against other POWs during a trip to deliver treats to the camp commander and bribes the commander into allowing Trautmann to be allowed out of the camp, whereupon he recruits him to play as goalkeeper for his relegation-threatened side.\nAlthough the war has recently ended with the defeat of Nazi Germany, the other players are angered to be asked to play alongside a man who is from a country they were until recently at war with, but with little other option they agree to take to the field. A string of strong performances see the players slowly come to accept Bert's place in the team. As a condition of his continuing appearances, Friar agrees to let Bert help work in his shop, leading Friar's daughter Margaret (Freya Mavor) to soften her initially-hostile stance, and the pair begin an unlikely romance.\nAs St Helens Town come to their crunch relegation-deciding match at the end of the season, it is announced that the war's end has led to an offer for the German POWs to be repatriated. Although Trautmann is free to return to his home in Bremen, he instead chooses to stay to support his side. After the match, Manchester City manager Jock Thomson (Gary Lewis), who has come on a scouting mission, approaches Bert and offers him a place in his City team to replace the retiring Frank Swift. At their end-of-season party, his teammates present him with a hamper to take home to his family, but Bert's growing connection with Margaret leads him instead to stay, and in due course they are married.\nIn 1949, Bert travels to Manchester to sign for City. The press conference for his arrival rapidly turns hostile as the Manchester press \u2013 representing a city with a large Jewish population \u2013 demand Bert answer questions on his military background. Protesting crowds form outside Maine Road, and the City supporters barrage him with booing, but Thomson and his City side refuse to join them, instead stating \"there's no war in this dressing room\".At an acrimonious meeting with season ticketholders, Thomson and the City board struggle to contain the fury of the city's residents, but a passionate plea by Margaret strikes home with the influential Rabbi Altmann (Butz Ulrich Buse), who writes an open letter to the city published in a local paper asking them to examine all men individually without national bias. Following Altmann's letter, and with continuing fine performances on the field, the mood shifts and soon Trautmann is even being welcomed by players of other teams around the country.\nBy 1956 Bert and Margaret are living an idyllic existence with their young son John, while Manchester City's strong run has led them to the FA Cup Final. As City take a strong 3\u20131 lead, Bert is again winning plaudits for his masterful goalkeeping, when a dangerous collision with Birmingham City player Peter Murphy shatters a vertebra in his neck and almost costs him his life. With 20 minutes of the game left to go, and clearly in a bad state, Trautmann refuses to leave the field and continues to make several brave saves, stopping Birmingham City from scoring any further goals and thus winning City the cup.His joy leads to tragedy, however, as during his recuperation his son is hit by a car and killed. Their heartbreak causes Margaret to grow more distant from Bert, while he himself becomes convinced that his loss is a karmic consequence of his inaction when witnessing war atrocities in Ukraine, and the film leaves them still working through the resulting difficulties in their marriage.

On the drive back to the house, Cathy, who seems quite lonely, tells Anne the story of Guy Favre and his friend Hicham, two teens who both died in a mysterious barn fire many years earlier, although she says Guy's body was never found, and his parents buried a coffin with only clothing inside. Guy's father died, presumable by suicide, days later, and Guy's mother then went mad. Anne shares the last of her whiskey with Cathy before they get out of the car.\nAnne asks Monsieur Vannier to procure another bottle of whiskey for her, and he asks that she not share it again with Cathy, because his daughter previously had a drinking problem and tried to leave him once, alone, to die. \"She's all I have left.\"\nCathy then leaves some old newspaper clippings from her father's archives on Anne's bed, with a note saying she noticed that Anne was interested in the story. She says they probably won't see each other again before Anne returns to Paris, but she is glad they met, signing the note, \"Your friend, Cathy.\" \nBelieving she now knows who the killer is, Anne tells Archie to arrange another shoot with whomever he can get, with the instructions that this scene pays triple. As the shoot takes place elsewhere, Lo\u00efs is editing the final scene from Homocidal when she spots a mysterious figure in the footage. She calls Moon and demands that she pick her up immediately, they race to the shooting location.\nBack at the shoot, issues with both the camera and the performers delay the process, which leads to an improvisation that involves turning the lights off and on again. As the lights go out, Guy appears and murders actor Jos\u00e9 El Hombre. Anne calls out to Guy in the darkness that she knows who he is. As Guy attempts to murder Anne, Lo\u00efs arrives, jumps in front of her, and is stabbed by Guy. She dies in Anne's arms as Guy escapes. \nSometime later, Anne arrives at the Le Far West, the porn theatre that showcases her films, for the premiere of Homocidal \u2014 she drinks heavily and stays for multiple viewings. She is approached by a fan from the audience, to whom she says, \"It was all Lo\u00efs.\" Nans arrives later, unaware that Anne is sitting up front. Guy is revealed to be in attendance as well, sitting in the row behind Nans. When a man sitting next to Nans asks if he has the pleasure of meeting the \"famous Fouad,\" Nans dismisses his sexual advances and explains, \"No, but you're not the first to confuse us.\" Meanwhile, Anne has a vision of all of her dead friends surrounding her in the seats, and Lo\u00efs dead onscreen in place of the masked killer in the film, waking up in time to see Nans leave the room.\nAfter \"Homicidal\" ends, the trailer for \"Spunk and the Land Alone,\" one of Anne's earlier films from 1977, begins playing. As she sees the actors being introduced onscreen, Anne realises that every murdered actor starred in this film, which recreated Guy's tragic story, all of them are dead, except Fouad!\nGuy is out to murder all those involved, including Anne, and now he is after Nans, whom he has mistaken for Fouad.\nNans goes upstairs in the theatre to a darkened room where men meet for anonymous sex, and is followed by Guy, who attempts to murder him, but has a vision of Hicham, and is overcome by grief, repeatedly crying out Hicham's name. As Nans tells Guy he is mistaken, Guy moves to strike, and is interrupted by Anne, who once more calls his name and says she knows who he is. Cornered and in a panic, Guy takes another man hostage and drags him into the theatre, where the audience of gay men attack and kill him as payback for the fear he created in the community. Anne is overcome by grief as she understands the true tragedy of this moment.\nGuy and Hicham's tragic love story is recalled with an epilogue: the boys were caught in the act by Guy's father, who castrated his son and murdered Hicham, setting the barn on fire to conceal his crime. In the forest, the magical Chaladre grackles revived Guy, now burned beyond recognition, caring for him and nursing him back to health. He has no memory and goes to live in Paris, where one day, he enters a theatre and sees these awful events being parodied on the screen, driving him to take revenge...\nIn a Postscript, we see Anne and her crew shooting again in a fantastical ancient Roman setting, where Archibald is costumed as a satyr, crawling amongst the writhing bodies of men making love against a glowing white backdrop. Is it real, or is it merely in Anne's dreams? Lo\u00efs appears, and embraces Anne. The two lovers kiss and it is as though all is well in the world. Yet, Fran\u00e7ois pulls Anne away from Lo\u00efs, bringing her back to the real world. Lo\u00efs fades away into the backdrop. Archie and Anne look upon one another, the love they feel for one another as true friends is palpable. The pain they feel is also clear. But they live on. Life. Love. Grief. Life. Archie smiles. Anne smiles.\nThe End.", "tmdb_id": 475930}, "62527554": {"title": "Knuckleball (2018 film)", "plot": "Henry, a 12-year-old boy, finds out his family's dark legacy when his mysterious grandfather suddenly dies leaving him alone on an isolated farm.", "tmdb_id": 466174}, "55608419": {"title": "Kolamaavu Kokila", "plot": "The film opens with the killing of a police officer by a cocaine-dealer lord Bhai and his henchmen.

Shortly after arriving, Gil vanishes; Fin learns from a message recorded by Gil earlier that due to the instability of the energy needed to time travel, any individual person can only travel back in time once, with any subsequent trips resulting in their disappearance. Fin retrieves the bag containing April's cybernetic head from a dinosaur with aid from Nova, and they are joined by pre-cyborg April and Bryan, all three of whom were saved by Gil removing them from the times of their original deaths. As they begin to lay out their plan, the very first sharknado appears in conjunction with a meteor shower. Fin then plans to use the meteorites' heat to blow up the sharknado. The gang then approaches the sharknado on a pterodactylus and Fin jumps down onto a shark and tries to navigate it to consume meteorite fragments. As they execute the plan, they see the past version of Gil riding a dinosaur inside the sharknado before he disappears into the future. Eventually, Fin knocks the shark into the sharknado before it explodes and dissipates the storm. Believing they have changed history to erase the sharknado phenomenon, the group use a capacitor built into Gil's flight insignia to try to travel back to the present day.\nHowever, Fin and company instead arrive in medieval Camelot, with Bryan turned into a woman due to a temporal alteration. They encounter Morgana le Fay and are brought before Merlin, discovering Gil's research on the Einstein-Rosen bridge to create a method of time travel. Furthermore, Gil's time traveling has altered space-time, unleashing the sharknados throughout history as he searches for his parents. April also learns of her future when Fin accidentally drops the bag with Robot April's head and the others discover its contents, apologizing for keeping April in the dark to spare her from knowing her fate. She accepts Fin\u2019s apology, but just as they reconnect, another sharknado forms and heads straight to the castle. The Gil of the past uses the sharknado to travel into the future, and Fin decides to use Excalibur to defeat the sharknado, with Morgana killed by one of the sharks. The group then travel to the Revolutionary War where they meet Benjamin Franklin and George Washington, with Bryan (who returned to original form) convincing them to let them use their cannons to destroy the sharknado that threatens the Revolutionary Army's fleet. They succeed, with Bryan remaining behind as the others continue.\nEnding up in the Wild West, the group unwittingly allows Billy the Kid to escape capture when they arrive, resulting in Fin's arrest by the local sheriff while April and Nova hide. However, as Billy was Gil's escape route to the next sharknado, this threatens to severely alter the timeline. Nova and April are rescued by Skye, who was also saved by Gil before being sent back to the Wild West. Skye helps April and Nova save Fin and Gil, with Skye establishing a bootstrap paradox by telling Gil to save her future self. Realizing that they can do nothing that would interfere with Gil's journey through time in search of his parents, the group allow him to make a time leap using the sharknado before destroying it with Robot April's eye lasers. The group then use a train to create the next time portal, ending up at a beach in the 1950s as a sharknado is forming. Fin encounters younger versions of his parents Gilbert and Raye, who have been enlisted by Gil to help create the time capacitor. After Gil makes his time leap by entering the sharknado on a surfboard, the group nullifies it using a ray gun created by him and his grandparents. The group tries to follow Gil to July 11, 2013 to stop the sharknado from the first film, but Nova sabotages the capacitor to travel to 1997 instead, where she attempts to save her grandfather from being killed in the shark attack that traumatized her as a child. Despite Fin's warnings against altering her personal timeline to such a degree, Nova rescues her grandfather only to be eaten in the shark attack herself. April is killed as well, while Robot April's head is lost in the ocean.\nDevastated, Fin and Skye decide to continue on and use a shark to attempt another jump to 2013. However, they instead end up in the far future of the year 20013, where they find that Robot April has taken over the ruined world left by the global sharknado using an army of her clones and flying, robotic sharks. She explains that after her head was found by a fishing boat, she felt abandoned and spent the next 20,000 years developing a stable time machine, which she used to force Fin into her future so they could be together forever. Robot April freezes Skye in carbonite and tries to convince Fin to stay with her using her clones of their children and Nova, but Fin refuses, prompting her to torture him with electricity until the human April, who Robot April revived and preserved to act as a genetic base for the clones, wakes up and intervenes. While the two Aprils fight each other, Fin uses the time machine to reach 2013, where he lands on Captain Santiago's boat right as the true first sharknado forms. Fin finds that Santiago's crew has found Robot April's head, and intervenes to change history and prevent her from becoming evil. Fin and Santiago battle the sharks while Robot April's head recharges her eye lasers in order to destroy the sharknado. However, the Robot April of the future (disguised as Gil) arrives, and her struggle with Fin inside the sharknado damages the capacitor, tearing the fabric of reality. Time begins collapsing, creating a \"timenado\" in which figures from throughout history such as Cleopatra and Adolf Hitler pass through the vortex as it destroys the universe. The present-day Robot April's head helps Fin finally destroy her future self, and he triggers her nuclear reset failsafe, sacrificing themselves in order to destroy the sharknado and stitch time back together, resulting in the creation of a new timeline.\nIn the new, sharknado-free timeline, all of the Shepard family and friends are alive.

The main storyline of the film tells the story of the relationship between the 19-year-old Viktor Tsoi (Teo Yoo), 26-year-old Mike Naumenko (Roman Bilyk), and Naumenko's girlfriend Natalia (Irina Starshenbaum), as well as the formation of the Leningrad Rock Club and the recording of Kino's first album, 45.The film's setting, the Leningrad Rock Club, was one of the few state-permitted public performance spaces for rock musicians in its time. The Club is generally a theatrical venue for boundary-pushing music, where audiences are instructed to sit politely and listen rather than mosh. However, interjections by narrator Skeptic (Alexander Kuznetsov) occasionally recast the club as extravagant, hedonistic, reckless, and dangerous. The musicians live frugally; their indulgences are creative rather than material.\nMuch of the narrative focuses on Mike, the frontman of one of the Club's more popular, old-guard bands, and his girlfriend Natacha, whose close, initially monogamous relationship stands in contrast to the expected behavior of rockstars. Also significant to the plot is Viktor, a quiet, slightly otherworldly young man with a knack for melody and a beguilingly peculiar turn of lyrical phrase. Natacha is the first to notice a kind of melancholic magic about Viktor, as the film gradually reorients itself around his budding stardom rather than Mike's less obviously ascending career. However, the film maintains a more general look at the musicians in the club, including the various musicians who come in and out of the lives of the protagonists.\nThe film's musical numbers alternate between diegetic stage performances and sudden flights of music-video fancy. In one such performance, an altercation between musicians and more conservative citizens on a packed train escalates into a demented, carriage-traversing singalong of Talking Heads' \"Psycho Killer,\" the hitherto realist imagery disrupted with early-MTV-style cartoon flourishes. There are a few sequences in which Mike and the other Leningrad rockers seize their moment, using their music to defy the bureaucrats and wow audiences.

The girls are told that the school protects them from the toxic outside air and that their lessons prepare them for adoption by members of high society, who will only want the girls if they are \"clean.\" Breaking the rules results in being taken downstairs for punishment, which the girls universally fear. Two best friends, Sophia and Vivien, line up with the other girls on Level 10 to wash their faces in front of a camera in an allotted, regimented time. Vivien steps out of line to help Sophia, who dropped her jar of face cream, and in doing so exceeds her time limit. The guards arrive and Vivien is dragged away for punishment, screaming in terror.\nYears later, Vivien is moved to Level 16 (the final level) and reunited with Sophia for the first time since Level 10. Sophia warns her not to take the daily vitamins, which are actually powerful sedatives. That night, while pretending to sleep, Vivien and another girl, Olivia, are carried to a lounge. The facility manager, Miss Brixil, presents the sleeping girls to an aging couple, who choose Olivia and make plans to purchase her. Once the girls are returned to the dormitory, Vivien manages to escape into the hall, but finds that the outer door requires key card access. Throughout the night, several other girls are taken to the lounge and subsequently returned. Miss Brixil, talking to an unseen person on the phone, expresses concern about the behavior of a guard, Alex, warning that he should not be allowed around the girls unsupervised.\nThe girls meet the facility\u2019s doctor, Dr. Miro, who informs them that there has been a fever going around some of the other halls and gives them a 'vaccine.' The injection gives them painful rashes and causes one girl to have a seizure. Miro initially acts kind towards Vivien, but when she attempts to share her concerns with him, he realizes she has been skipping her vitamins and injects her with a 'concentrated' dose. Sophia informs Vivien that Alex, the guard Miss Brixil was concerned about, secretly visits the dormitory and \"touches\" the girls while they sleep. She plans to wait until Alex comes to the dormitory, restrain him, and steal his key card. Shortly afterwards, Ava reports Vivien for unclean behavior and Vivien is locked in a box for the night. That night, Sophia attacks Alex when he comes to the dormitory and steals his key card, but she is captured before she is able to free Vivien.\nMiss Brixil and Miro inform the girls that they were unable to find the key card Sophia stole and ask where she hid it. When they cannot produce it, Rita is taken downstairs for punishment with a warning to the group that another girl will be punished each day until the card is found. Alone, Miss Brixil and Miro discuss the school\u2019s dwindling funds and the pressure being put on them (ostensibly by powerful criminals) to produce results. During the night, Vivien finds that Sophia hid the key card behind her headboard and escapes, heading downstairs to rescue her. She frees Sophia, and they enter a crude operating room full of corpses, where they find the missing Rita, dead and with her skin removed. Vivien insists they leave immediately, but Sophia refuses to go without the other girls. While Sophia goes to get them, Vivien finds a video in the lounge revealing that the facility is actually a rejuvenation clinic run by Miro \u2013 the girls are raised in a sterile environment so that their skin can eventually be transplanted onto rich buyers.\nSophia tries to warn the other girls about their situation, but they are initially suspicious of her. Vivien brings Miss Brixil to the rest of the group, where she reveals that Sophia is telling the truth. After locking Miss Brixil in the box, they lead the girls out of the facility, closely pursued by the guards. During a fight, Sophia is injured, but the two narrowly escape by hiding in a shed behind a security door. When the guards are unable to open the door, Miro arrives and attempts to manipulate Vivien into coming outside and helping him round up the other girls, revealing that their birth parents sold them to the facility as babies. Vivien, aware that Miro only cares about her appearance, cuts her face with the scalpel while Miro watches, distraught. Soon afterwards, henchmen lead Miro away to see their boss, the mastermind of the operation. A gunshot is heard; Miro has presumably been killed for losing control of the clinic.

They run into a gypsy fortune-teller whose wagon has a broken wheel. Nando attempts to bargain with the gypsy for a ride to Puebla, but when she refuses, Leo offers her their help free of charge. The woman offers them free palm readings in gratitude, which only Leo accepts. The gypsy soon grows horrified: Leo's hand has two life lines, a long one that speaks of a bright future and a short, dark one that indicates Leo's involvement with the supernatural has left darkness in his soul. She warns him that if he ever walks the realms of the dead again, he will not come out, and vehemently advises him to run home to his family.\nA disturbed Leo catches up to Nando, and talk between the two devolves into an argument over Leo leaving Nando and their grandmother in favor of adventures with his \"imaginary friends\" (so called because Nando can't see spirits, although he does believe they exist). The fight is interrupted by an old man who attempts to enlist their help in recovering his stolen deer's eye charm from a man called Rupertino. Despite Nando's misgivings about the story, Leo persuades him to help them. They find Rupertino, who really does make a living as a con man, in the caravan where he lives with his young daughter Beatriz. The two brothers are violently attacked by Beatriz while Rupertino denies stealing anything, but they manage to pickpocket Rupertino and flee with the charm. Rupertino and Beatriz discover the theft and give chase, catching up to the pair on a bridge where they have already returned the charm to the old man. The old man confronts Rupertino, who genuinely does not recognize him until the old man laughingly reminds him of an encounter they had twelve years ago. The man reveals himself to be El Charro Negro, a malignant spirit to whom Rupertino sold his soul: Rupertino has since been hiding from El Charro Negro to stop him from collecting the debt. Though Rupertino bravely offers him his soul, El Charro Negro takes Beatriz's soul instead.\nAs El Charro is about to return to the underworld, Leo proposes a bet in return of Beatriz. El Charro appears uninterested, but tells Leo he must visit El Charro in his home if he wants to go through before vanishing through a portal. As Leo and Nando argue over this new development and Rupertino also prepares to join them, the ghost Teodora appears to inform Nando that Finado and Moribunda have been desperately attempting to tell her something. Finado frightens Rupertino, who bolts towards the portal, and in the confusion all of them fall through. Beatriz, who is still alive but slowly fading, is left in the care of Ana; she reveals to Beatriz that her father didn't trade his soul for money. He had done business with El Charro Negro because Beatriz had gotten very sick as a baby and Rupertino had been afraid to lose her as he'd lost Beatriz's mother.\nThe group reappears in El Charro Negro's domain, a sprawling agave field dominated by a luxurious hacienda. Teodora realizes she has lost all her ghost powers and must resort to walking, which she has grown unaccustomed to after nearly six decades as a ghost. Unable to locate Finado and Moribunda, the group advances to El Charro Negro's house. He shows them Beatriz's soul being distilled - when the process concludes, the remnants of Beatriz's soul will leave her body and she will die.\nDeep in El Charro Negro's home, the alebrije Evaristo is captured and confined to the same agave mill as Xochitl. \nMeanwhile, Leo's group agrees to a deal with El Charro Negro: they will venture through his personal fair to retrieve four special objects. If they can find all four before the rooster crows, he will return Beatriz her soul. Teodora and Nando find the Medallion of Miquiztli in the tent of a freak show attraction named the Caterpillar Woman, where they fail to answer her riddle ('what is something that is yours but that others use the most?') and are attacked until Teodora discovers the answer ('your name'). Rupertino and Leo make their way through a giant game of duck shooting towards a glowing crystal as Leo's old enemy Rousseau shoots at them. They are successful, but Leo begins to experience discomfort and discovers that the short black life line has begun extending tendrils down his arm. The group later reconvenes to a giant game of loter\u00eda, where they recover the Iyari medallion.\nThe group's final challenge is a fun house. However, they are barred from entering by El Charro Negro once Leo is inside, revealing he has walked into a trap. While all his friends convene outside the house and try to break in, Leo is confronted with a mirror that apparently holds an evil version of himself. He wakes up to El Charro Negro informing him that he has failed and the rooster has crowed; he then presents him with a bottle containing Beatriz's soul in a bottle. Back in the world of the living, Beatriz breathes her last in Ana's company. El Charro Negro refuses Leo's attempts at negotiating and reveals that he has singled out Leo to be his successor, pulling up his sleeve to show Leo his own black-veined arm. He then possesses Leo, forcing him to take on the mantle of El Charro Negro. The bottle containing Beatriz's soul falls and breaks.\nOutside, Leo's friends are distraught when he emerges wearing El Charro Negro's clothes and wielding the spirit's vast powers. Nando manages to catch him off-guard, which allows Evaristo and Alebrije to fire Finado and Moribunda's pure energy into Leo. After a desperate few minutes, Leo's special powers are finally extracted and a furious Charro Negro abandons Leo's body and prepares to do battle with them in the shape of a shadowy black corpse. Though Leo doesn't want to leave his friends, the portal to the world of the living begins to close. After a parting kiss from Xochitl, Leo, Nando and Rupertino (who has scooped up as much of Beatriz's soul as he could into a gourd) leave for the mortal world. Xochitl, Teodora, Don Andr\u00e9s, the alebrijes and the two skull children then launch a combined attack against El Charro Negro.\nBack amongst the living, Rupertino returns to his caravan and pours the scant contents of the gourd into Beatriz's mouth. After a heartbreaking few minutes she finally returns to her father and Ana's joy. After saying their goodbyes, Nando and Leo hurry to Puebla.\nBack in Puebla, they are greeted by many familiar sights, including the San Juan family bakery. Leo makes his way upstairs to find his grandmother awake in her bed. The two share a tearful reunion, after which they're joined by Nando and by Nana Dionisia, who comments on how grown-up Leo is. Although glad to be home, Leo is saddened at the loss of his friends.\nUnbeknownst to the San Juan family, Leo's ghostly friends all crown around the bakery's window, having apparently defeated El Charro Negro. They too are sad that Leo can no longer see or hear them. Xochitl has an idea: she uses her powers to ring the bell that hangs outside the bakery and leaves a flower at the door. Leo goes outside at the sound. Unsure but trusting that his friends might hear him, Leo thanks them and tells them that their love and friendship will be with him always. He raises his hand, at which each of his friends touch back. It seems the touch somehow gets through to Leo, who thanks them with a smile.

The next morning, Lizzie raids Abby's jewelry casket and hawks its contents at a local pawnbroker. Enraged by the robbery, Andrew kills Lizzie's pet pigeons, which he has Bridget prepare for dinner.  One morning, Bridget becomes distraught after receiving a letter from Ireland disclosing her mother's death.

Lizzie smashes a hand mirror in her bedroom and sprinkles the glass at Bridget's door, causing Andrew to cut his feet when leaving.\nLizzie and Bridget's bond grows increasingly close, and with Bridget able to write, the two leave letters for one another around the house. Their relationship eventually becomes romantic.

One afternoon, Andrew spies Lizzie and Bridget having sex in the barn. He later calls Lizzie an abomination and forbids her from associating with Bridget, whom he intends to dismiss. That night, Lizzie burns her father's will in the kitchen stove. The next day, August 4, Andrew and Abby's bodies are found in the house, both bludgeoned with a hatchet. Law enforcement swiftly suspects Lizzie is responsible, though Emma proclaims her sister's innocence. Lizzie is formally charged with both murders and stands a closed trial. Bridget visits Lizzie in jail and asks her cease all contact before boarding a train to Montana.\nA climactic flashback shows both Lizzie and Bridget carrying out the murders: That morning, Lizzie strips nude and hides in Abby's bedroom while Andrew goes for his morning walk. Bridget brings Abby a doctored telegram notifying her of a friend's illness. When Abby rushes to her room to prepare to leave, Lizzie bludgeons her multiple times in the face and head with a hatchet. Bridget, outside washing windows, is sickened by the sounds and vomits. Lizzie cleans herself and redresses. When Andrew returns, Lizzie tells him she is going outside to pick fruit. Meanwhile, Bridget undresses and confronts Andrew in the den, armed with a hatchet, but hesitates. Lizzie re-enters the house, takes the hatchet from Bridget and kills Andrew herself. Afterwards, Lizzie butchers a pigeon with the murder weapon, smearing it with the bird's blood before sawing off the blade and hiding it in a pail in the basement. She then burns the handle and her blood-spattered dress in the kitchen stove.\nLizzie is ultimately acquitted of the murders and lives the remainder of her life in Fall River, ostracized by the community and estranged from Emma. She dies at age 66 and leaves the majority of her estate to the local humane society.

Satish begs Harsh to help Vinod and his family, but he makes no effort to save them, and abandons them for death.\nHarsh begins to feel guilty and regretful upon the revelation of his actions.

Maari and his sidekicks set fire to all the drugs, and Beeja kills Vallavan to make it look as though Maari killed him. Kalai becomes enraged and orders his men to kill Maari.

Maari goes into hiding with Aanandi, whose legs are paralysed. Eight years pass, Beeja and Kalai have grown to become rich dons, but when Kalai has a clear chance to become the MLA candidate of the ruling party, Beeja usurps that chance by threatening Kalai and his family. Vijaya, now the Deputy-Home secretary, in an effort to find Maari, posts his picture along with Aanandi's on newspapers. Maari meets Vijaya, requesting her to remove the photos. Maari then reveals that he was living in Tenkasi with an elderly couple. \nAanandi got pregnant, and a healthy baby boy was born. However, due to complications by the paralysis, Aanandi dies minutes after childbirth. Maari then raises the boy, called Kaali, with help from the old couple, Sani and Robert. Kaali is shown to have inherited Maari's behaviour and keeps picking fights in school. Maari then requests Vijaya to stop coming after him as he changed his ways. When Kaali sees some students teasing a teacher, he complains about them to the principal. In retribution, the boys chase and attack him, only to get thrashed by Kaali. The council's area member, who is also father of one of the boys, calls Kaali to hit him, but Maari goes and begs for forgiveness.\nMeanwhile, the city police commissioner mentions to the media that there is an informer within Beeja's gang. Using his moles in the police department, Beeja tries to figure out who the mole is but fails. It is then revealed that there was not any mole and that the whole story was fabricated to identify the corrupt policemen in the department, including the commissioner. Also, Beeja has been in ties with the commissioner and was the mole himself. He had been leaking information about his men so that he may come out clear to become an MLA candidate. \nIt is also revealed that despite begging for forgiveness, the counsellor insisted on his son beating up Kaali, and so Maari beats up the counsellor and his henchmen. In a final encounter, the police turn against Beeja. Maari fights Beeja and paralyses him for revenge for Aanandi and reveals to him that Maari killed his brother because Beeja could be killed by his own brother for wealth. Soon Beeja gets sentenced to a life term in prison.

The school life is difficult for a boy who doesn't feel pain and is picked on by bullies and Surya finds an unlikely ally in his neighbour, Supri. At home, Surya learns to tend to his own wounds and binges on a whole host of martial arts films on VHS tapes thanks to his grandfather's unique tutelage. The only tape that mesmerises Surya is 100-man karate kumite fought by a mysterious one-legged man called Karate Mani. Surya's foray into vigilantism is to come to the aid of Supri against her abusive father, but that event leads to the family being evicted from the building they lived in, and Surya and Supri are estranged as children. They go their separate ways, each one finding purpose and mentorship in unusual circumstances.\nAjoba encourages Surya to pursue his passion secretly & Surya trains himself by watching VHS videos. Meanwhile, Supri is trained by Karate Mani, whom she meets when she accidentally bumps into his scooter. As a young man, Surya remains as dorky as he was in his childhood because his father will never let him leave the house. When his father finally agrees to let him outside, Surya finds a poster advertising his childhood idol Karate Mani. This poster leads him to the very building where he and Supri had been separated years ago, and it is Supri who is pasting the posters. Both of them don't recognise each other, but he is bedazzled when she fights off thugs to rescue a lady. Later, Surya visits the address mentioned on the poster to meet Karate Mani.

Later, Supri leaves from the hospital on the insistence by her boyfriend Atul, Mani recovers consciousness, and escapes from the hospital, feeling that the hospital will bill him a bomb for trivial treatment.\nSurya chases him and fights off the hospital staff who had come to capture him, and Mani is impressed with his skills. Mani reveals that he and Jimmy were trained by their father, a karate trainer, since they were kids. Mani showed his talent for martial arts and easily won the heart of his father, which made Jimmy jealous. One day, Mani saved Jimmy from a speeding truck, sacrificing his leg in the process. This further elevated Mani in the eyes of his father, and Jimmy is further estranged. After the 100-man kumite, his father gifted his locket to him, whereas Jimmy takes up the path of crime. Imprisoned for one of his crimes, Mani got cozy with Jimmy's girlfriend, and Jimmy caught them red-handed. This incident created a permanent rift between the two, putting Mani in a guilt trap. Later, Jimmy started a security agency and bullied Mani with men and guns from his security agency, taking something from him each time he visited him, while Mani relented out of guilt.\nSupri later reveals that Atul won over her parents by taking care of their medical expenses, which sort of forced her to stay with him so that her mother would get adequate medical care. Atul is taking her family to Canada to treat her mother. Supri is falling into the same trap of family burden as her mother bore all her life with her abusive husband, so much so that she doesn't have time to think for herself and no clue about her career. On his previous visit, Jimmy snatches the locket that was given by their father to Mani, and Surya vows to get it back for him. His grandfather tries to dissuade him as it is too dangerous but eventually gives in when he realises that he should not kill this very motivating factor. Surya meets Mani, who refuses to take him to Jimmy, but when Surya stops at nothing, he accompanies him to Jimmy's office. Meanwhile, at the airport just before boarding their flight to Canada, Supri's mother insists that she run away from Atul so that she doesn't go through the same fate of an overbearing husband.\nSupri's mother hatches a plan wherein she covers up for the absence of Supri inside the plane and falls unconscious with a heavy dose of insulin once the plane lands in Canada, and once unconscious at the airport, she has to be admitted to hospital to be treated. Supri leaves after some pushing from her mother and goes straight to Jimmy's office, knowing Surya would create some ruckus there. At Jimmy's office, a fight ensues between his staff and the two. Surya easily thrashes most of them, and they are surprised to find that Surya doesn't experience pain, which makes him more lethal. In the ensuing fight, the fire is triggered, and the staff lock them in a room and escape from the building. Supri enters in a nick of time and rescues them. They later take refuge at their old residential complex, where they had spent their childhood, which is deserted for reconstruction, and Ajoba gets them all the essentials like blankets and food. In the morning, they are all captured by Jimmy, who arranges a cruel game, where each one of them has to fight his staff members one-on-one.\nThe first up is Mani, followed by Supri, Surya, and Ajoba.

In neighbouring England, Mary's twenty-eight-year-old cousin Elizabeth is the Protestant queen of England \u2013 unmarried, childless, and threatened by Mary's potential claim to her throne. Mary dismisses the cleric John Knox from her court. A Protestant and leader of the Scottish Reformation, Knox views Mary as a danger to the kingdom's Protestant supremacy.\nSeeking to weaken her cousin's threat to her sovereignty, Elizabeth arranges for Mary, whom many English Catholics regard as their rightful queen, to be married to an Englishman. She chooses Robert Dudley, whom she secretly loves; although he and Mary are unwilling, news of Elizabeth's smallpox convinces Mary to accept, provided she is named Elizabeth's heir. Reluctant to let go of Dudley, Elizabeth sends Lord Darnley to Scotland with the pretence of living under their religious freedom. Despite sensing the ulterior motive, Mary grows fond of Darnley and eventually accepts his proposal.\nMary's impending marriage causes a constitutional crisis within both realms: Elizabeth is advised to oppose the marriage for fear that Darnley, an English noble, will elevate Mary's claim to the crown; Mary's council is suspicious of Darnley, fearing an English takeover. Both kingdoms demand his return to England but Mary refuses, leading Moray to mount a rebellion against her. Mary marries Darnley, only to discover him in bed with her friend and private secretary, David Rizzio. Mary quashes the rebel forces but spares Rizzio and Moray, and demands that Darnley give her a child. When a child is conceived, Mary declares the child is \"heir to Scotland and England\" \u2013 offending the English.\nMoray colludes with Darnley's father Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, to undermine Mary. They spread rumours that her child was illegitimately fathered by Rizzio, driving John Knox to vehemently denounce Mary as an adulteress. Fearing these accusations and the possible discovery of his homosexuality, Darnley is coerced by the underminers to join them in murdering Rizzio, and reluctantly delivers the final blow.\nDiscovering the plot of weakening her rule and giving Darnley more power, Mary convinces Darnley to side with her and escape with her instead, which turns out to be a ploy for her army to detain him. Mary agrees to pardon the conspirators if presented with evidence that Darnley took part. She ultimately forgives Moray, and asks Elizabeth to be her child's godmother. They agree the child is heir presumptive, despite the English court's hostility.

Bothwell advises that her council has decided she must marry a Scotsman immediately\u2014and that Scotsman should be Bothwell himself.  Mary resists, suspecting he was involved in Darnley's murder, but after he threatens her and subsequently rapes her, she consents. This induces Knox to preach to the Scots that Mary is a \"harlot\" who had her husband killed, leading Moray and her court to demand her abdication. Despite her objections, Mary eventually abdicates and flees to England.\nElizabeth arranges a clandestine meeting, where Mary asks for help to take back her throne. Unable to go to war on behalf of a Catholic, Elizabeth instead promises a safe exile in England as long as Mary does not aid her enemies.

Maya is surprisingly shocked in disbelief, but as the Queen hesitates for a moment, Beegood warns her not to reject the offer, and she therefore accepts the invitation, regardless of the consequences.\nSoon after, Maya and Willy decide to take matters into their own hands, and they fly to the thriving hive of Buzztropolis, where upon arrival Maya bumps into one of the competitors called Violet, who is later revealed to be Beegood's daughter. As both bees greet the Empress, Maya explains that if the honey is all that matters, then why can't her hive join in the Games? Unfortunately, as they make a deal, Willy spills the honey onto the Empress and Maya's incident is witnessed by the Queen. Later, both royals confide in one another about what happened in the throne room. As Maya insists that the Empress reconsider the decision, she makes a wager: if Maya's team wins, all is forgiven, but if they lose, the Empress will steal all of the hive's honey. Maya agrees, even though the Queen is reluctant of what may happen.\nOn the opening of the games, Maya is met by her team; Spinder, a spider, Craig, a germaphobic cockroach, Bedford, a bed bug, and Arnie and Barney, the ant soldiers, all of which are untrained and unskilled, much to Maya's disappointment. On day one of the games, the teams are tasked with a simple game of dodgeball. Things get off to a shaky start as Maya's team are easily beaten, but as the challenge progresses, the fellow competition is having a fair bit of trouble, too. At the end of the task, the results reveal that Team Tropolis (Violet's team) came first, but Team Poppy Meadow (Maya's team) haven't placed last.\nLater that evening, Violet invites Willy and Maya over to dine with her, but Maya is taunted and bullied by Violet as she keeps calling her a \"meadow bug\". Violet then frames Maya for smashing her hand and being mean to her. Beegood warns Maya that she will be expelled from the games if she creates any further harm. Infuriated, Maya flies off to be alone, though Willy reassures her that they're still best friends.\nOn day two, the teams are tasked with climbing the vines of a willow tree, and reach their colored flag at the top, as a team. As some of the teams get off to an early start, Violet's team tries their best to reach their goal, whereas on the other hand, Maya is desperate to win the challenge, and abandons her teammates. As both team captains reach their goals, it is revealed that Violet and her team came SECOND and Maya's team placed in third place. Unfortunately, she is rejected by the team due to her selfishness and lack of leadership. Violet apologizes to Beegood for not winning, and is reminded by her father not to disappoint again. Later, Maya returns to camp and finds out that the team now knows why she has to win, as Willy previously mentioned. They wonder why she didn't say anything, and she replies that she was afraid that they would worry too much. However, the team finds out that they need just a little training and as the afternoon passes, they are finally ready for the next challenge.\nOn the last day, the final three teams are challenged with navigating through a maze, without waking the tortoise in the center and are also required to not fly in this task. As the teams get going, Maya and her team manage to tie a string of Spindler's silk so that they can follow the way. Meanwhile, Violet and her team are caught in a dead end and after a brief argument about where they're supposed to go, Violet is run over by the giant tortoise that Willy inadvertently awoke. As Maya's team wins, the rest of Violet's team come second, disappointing both Violet and her father. Both the Empress (angered by the result) and the Queen (happy of the result) prepare for the final showdown.\nThe night before the final showdown, Violet and Maya confront each other and dare to do a duel down a big hill covered with thorns called Sluggy Hill. Confident, Maya accepts, unaware that Violet is secretly doing another trick on her again. As they race, Violet stops before the finish line, whereas Maya passes it and accidentally knocks over the Honey Cup, Violet frames her again for breaking the honey cup on purpose. Beegood is furious by the chaos and damage Maya has caused, and expels her from the Honey Games. Saddened once again by the Violet's bullying, she flies away, devastated. Shortly after, Flip talks to her and explains why she has been neglecting the team: she is so caught up in trying to save the hive, that she hasn't been leading nor communicating with her teammates. Inspired, Maya thanks Flip for the advice and buzzes off to camp.\nAfter reconciling with Willy and the team, Maya decides to up her game and knows what to do during tomorrow. As the big day dawns, the Empress, the Queen, and everyone else is gathered in the arena for the last showdown. At first, Maya's team apparently enter without Maya, much to the Queen's confusion and the Empress's appreciation of Maya would never compete the games. Suddenly, Maya flies in and requests for a second chance, regarding to her inexcusable behavior. The Empress gives her permission to continue competing, much to Beegood's dismay. Desperate that Maya should lose, he tells Violet to take a shortcut along the route in order to win.\nThe race begins, with Maya and Violet's teams neck and neck. But Willy once again gets separated from the team and follows what appears to be Maya going into a bush with a shortcut. Violet instructs Willy to fake an injury in order for his team to slow down, to which he refuses to do, and accuses her of cheating. And so, Maya's team successfully find the pollen of a purple flower. Meanwhile, Violet and her team are surrounded by a spider called Thekla. Just as both teams are about to be eaten, Bedford lullabies the spider to sleep with his talented singing. As they rescue their rivals, Violet has a change of heart and guiltily apologizes to Maya for her bullying and for cheating. Maya reminds Violet that having a team means having new friends.\nBoth teams make a last sprint for the finish, and Violet's team stops before the finish line as they helped Maya and her team cross it and are crowned the winners. However, the Empress is aghast as to why this is as it has been. Violet betrays her father and explains to everyone with deep regret that she cheated during the challenge, but Maya rescued her. Before making an example of Maya, the Empress is cut off by the Queen who stands up to her and tells her that enough is enough, and she should accept the fact that the right team won. The Empress finally sees reason and declares that Maya's team wins and also forgives her for her actions.\nAt the after-party, everyone is dancing and enjoying the party, whereas Violet and Maya dance with Willy happily.", "tmdb_id": 499088}, "58626437": {"title": "Maybe a Love Story", "plot": "Virgilio (Mateus Solano) is a single and lonely man but everything changes when he answers the call of Clara (Thaila Ayala).", "tmdb_id": 492826}, "73239330": {"title": "Maza Agadbam", "plot": "Nazuka wants to fulfill her fathers dream by defeating wrestlers all over the world and make name for herself and her state Maharashtra.", "imdb_id": "tt7386870"}, "46788290": {"title": "Maze Runner: The Death Cure", "plot": "Thomas, Newt and Frypan are the last of the free \"Gladers\".

His account of the story is dismissed by fellow survivor Dr. Heller, denouncing Taylor's actions as the result of pressure induced psychosis.\nFive years later, billionaire Jack Morris meets Dr. Minway Zhang at an underwater research facility the former finances called Mana One. Zhang and his oceanographer daughter Suyin supervise a mission to explore what could be the deepest section of the Mariana Trench, concealed by a thermocline of hydrogen sulfide. The mission submersible is piloted by Lori, Taylor's ex-wife, scientists Toshi and \"The Wall\". They discover an abundance of never-before-seen flora and fauna below the thermocline, but an attack by a large, unidentified creature causes the submersible to lose contact with Mana One.\nAn old friend of Taylor's, Mana One operations manager James \"Mac\" Mackreides, suggests sending Taylor down to attempt a rescue. Despite the objections of Heller, now a member of the Mana One crew, Zhang and Mac venture to Thailand to recruit Taylor, now a drunken loner. He is initially skeptical but relents after listening to a taped recording containing the dialogue between Lori, her crew, and Mana One. Suyin attempts the rescue in their absence but is attacked by a giant squid. Before the squid can crush her submersible, it is killed by an enormous shark.

Ethan and Walker infiltrate a Paris nightclub where Lark is supposed to purchase the plutonium from the Apostles, with arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis acting as a broker. They track a man they suspect to be Lark, but after an intense fight in the men's restroom, he is killed by MI6 Agent Ilsa Faust.

He does not wish to kill Casper and Iris, and offers to buy them off with the intention really being to drug the two and have them arrested, thereby keeping suspicion away from the group.\nDownstairs, Alexis secretly tells Iris that she intends to help them escape, but they are found by Cameron and Jeremy, who attack them. Casper holds the rest of the group at gunpoint and forces them downstairs, where they witness Jeremy attempting to strangle Iris, with Elliot disarming Casper. Enraged, Milo beats Jeremy to death, but is shot by Patrick, who intends to kill Iris and Casper, much to the dismay of Roxanne. Alexis manages to hide Iris and Casper in a secret room, which contains photos of the group's members and a sealed off chamber. Seeing his daughter's betrayal over the security cameras, Patrick uses the home's intercom system to play a music box tune which awakens Mikey, the Dawson's \"dog,\" who is in the sealed chamber. Mikey bursts out of his chamber and attacks Iris and Casper. He kills Iris by biting off her face, but he himself is finally killed by a katana-wielding Casper.\nPatrick resets the security system, opening the shutters. Seeing their chance to escape, Alexis and Casper flee the room, but are confronted by Patrick. He attempts to kill Casper, but is disemboweled. The two flee outside and are again confronted by Cameron, wielding a chainsaw. Casper severs Cameron's foot and the chainsaw falls on Cameron, eviscerating and killing him. The two are then knocked out by Elliot, who ties them to chairs suspended over the Dawson's pool. Elliot order Casper and Alexis to cut ropes that will drop the other person's chair into the pool. Alexis cuts Casper's rope, but she is knocked into the pool by Elliot. Watching them, Elliot is surprised by Roxanne, who stabs him and rescues Casper and Alexis. A still-alive Elliot emerges from the pool, but is finally killed by Alexis.\nNot wanting to cause anymore harm, Roxanne gives Casper $100,000 and one of their sports cars, who takes off while Roxanne and Alexis clean up their house. Casper drives straight to Emory's club and slaughters the security guarding it. Casper confronts Emory and slices the top his head off, killing him, all in view of his father.

The story switches to Manny Ortega trying to apply for a job, but hesitates on the convicted felon section of the application. Manny lives with his family including wife Marisol, mother and daughter. Manny goes out to hang out with some of his friends when a cop rolls up near their dice game. In an incident very similar to Eric Garner's death, six police officers attempt to arrest Darius Larson, a friend of Manny's who sells loose cigarettes outside a small bodega. While unclear what transpires, a cop fires his gun and kills Darius while Manny is recording the entire incident from his phone.\nManny, traumatized by the incident, returns home and rewatches the video. The next day in a newspaper, he sees that cops said Darius was reaching for their gun. While sitting in a park, Manny is confronted by two cops who attempt to intimidate him into not releasing the video. He tells Marisol the truth about the incident and how Darius didn't reach for the gun, but she cautions him to avoid any public disclosure because of his new job. Manny then sees a suspicious black vehicle outside his apartment that leaves when he gets close. Manny checks his apartment to make sure they didn't break in. Not willing to be bullied, he puts his video out on the internet for all to see.\nHe sees the effects of this video in the press and out on the street. But shortly afterwards, he is arrested by the same cops who tried to intimidate him in the park. During his interrogation, they tried to pin a gun to Manny that they found on his friend Victor. The narrative focus then shifts to Dennis Williams via the interrogation mirrored window.\nDennis goes out on patrol with his partner. Dennis asks Stacey, a white woman, how many times she has been pulled over this year, and she says none, alluding back to the opening scene. Dennis is then seen interacting in a playful yet competitive basketball game with local kids, in particular Zyrick, but it is undercut by the fact they spit on the door handle. Danny and his partner are then called in to calm a protest happening at the bodega where Darius was shot by police. They are met with angry protestors shouting at them. Dennis goes home and watches the video of the incident.\nThe next day, his partner Stacey brings up that internal affairs is looking into the case of the shooting of Darius Larson, specifically against officer Scala who was involved. Stacey seems dismissive of the entire incident, but Dennis thinks that reform is necessary and Scala is a bad cop. Later at dinner with friends, the incident of the shooting comes up as an item of discussion. Dennis becomes protective of the police as a whole claiming that they risk their lives, meanwhile Lisa argues that a man should not lose his life over a cigarette and that Dennis should be part of the solution to get rid of corrupt police. On his drive into the station, he is told about two officers who were shot and killed on duty. During an internal affairs interview, Dennis does not speak out against officer Scala. Later, on Dennis' night patrol, Zyrick, the boy who was playing basketball with Dennis earlier, is detained by some other officers. While Dennis drives by, the narrative shifts to Zyrick who is visibly scared.\nAfter being released by the cops, Zyrick returns home where he and his father live. The next day we watch Zyrick commute to his private school where he plays baseball. He is told about how recruiting scouts are going to be coming to his upcoming baseball game by his coach. On his way home from school, he sees some cops detaining another young black man on the street. Zyrick comes home and watches the video of Darius Larson getting killed. The next day Zyrick finds Zoe, who Zyrick has seen passing out flyers. Zyrick asks to help out with community activism and Zoe introduces him to the group that is getting ready for a protest against Darius Larson's shooting. A scout comes to recruit Zyrick at his home, but asks him questions about his character, making a lot of racial assumptions in his line of questioning. The scout indicates that Zyrick will be recruited, leading to the father and Zyrick to celebrate after the scout leaves. Later, Zoe and Zyrick then go visit Manny's home. We find out Manny has been arrested, and Marisol is pregnant with another child.\nAfter working out and training, Zyrick hears his teammates talking about the Larson shooting, casually mocking Larson for \"reaching for the gun.\" Zyrick returns home to find a celebration in his honor, but he finds the party overwhelming given the protest scheduled that same night. He walks out of the party, and his father confronts him saying that Zyrick has a ticket given his talent. Zyrick nevertheless joins the protest. During the protest, everyone begins chanting \"I am... Darius Larson\"  before they sit down and raise their fists peacefully. The cops tell them they will be disbanded by force and soon after the police start using aggressive measures and Zyrick runs away back home. The next day, Zyrick goes to his big game.

In opposition, settlements of the \"Anti-Traction League\" have developed an alternative civilization consisting of \"static settlements\" (traditional, non-mobile cities) in Asia led by Shan Guo (formerly China), protected by the \"Shield Wall\". Relics of 21st-century technology such as toasters, computers, and smartphones are valued by historians as \"Old-Tech.\"\nThe city of London captures a small Bavarian mining town called Salzhaken, absorbing its population and resources, under orders of Lord Mayor Magnus Crome.

Hester Shaw, a masked twenty-something woman among the Salzhakens, attempts to assassinate Thaddeus Valentine, Head of the Guild of Historians, but Tom intervenes, pursuing Hester to a chute.

Hester confides that Valentine killed her archaeologist mother Pandora after stealing a piece of Old-Tech she found in a dig in the Dead Continent of the Americas, while young Hester escaped with a necklace her mother gave her.

At the slave market of Rustwater in the Outlands, Tom and Hester are rescued by Anti-Traction League agent Anna Fang. During the chaos, they are pursued by Shrike, whom Hester reveals she knows. Hester explains that Shrike had found and raised her after escaping Valentine, and Hester promised to let him turn her into a Stalker like himself, but she left after discovering that London had entered the Great Hunting Ground, giving her a chance to kill Valentine. In London, Valentine's good-natured daughter Katherine grows estranged from her father, especially after Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod informs her that Valentine pushed Tom down the chute, and they learn Valentine's energy project in the re-purposed St Paul's Cathedral is more than it seems.\nHester and Tom travel on Anna's airship, the Jenny Haniver, to the airborne city Airhaven, meeting other Anti-Traction League members. After questioning Hester, Tom realizes Pandora discovered a computer core for MEDUSA, a quantum energy-based superweapon used by the belligerents during the Sixty Minute War to instantly destroy entire cities, albeit shattering the Earth's crust into a thousand pieces that have rearranged the former continents. The Guild of Engineers has stolen the remaining components from Tom's museum workshop and built a MEDUSA under Valentine's orders. Shrike catches up with them, resulting in a fierce skirmish that critically wounds him and destroys Airhaven. Realizing that Hester is in love with Tom, he spares Tom and frees her of her promise before perishing. As Hester, Tom, and Anna travel to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa with the surviving Anti-Tractionists, Valentine kills Crome in a coup and musters support from Londoners by vowing to destroy the Shield Wall with MEDUSA and lead them to a new Hunting Ground in Asia. Anna convinces Shan Guo's Governor Kwan to launch the Anti-Tractionist airship fleet against London, but MEDUSA destroys the fleet and blasts a hole through the Shield Wall.

Maxa is self-defined as the \"most assassinated woman in the world\" having become famous for being violently murdered on stage more than 10,000 times. The theater director at the Grand Guignol is known for his gruesome stories and realistic gory special effects that often leave audience members shocked and disgusted. Journalist \"Jean\" from Le Petit Journal is tasked with writing a critique of Maxa's performances. He arrives at the theater one night and seeks Maxa after her performance. On the way to her dressing room, he is given a bouquet of flowers by one of her costars to deliver to Maxa, apparently on behalf of one of her admirers. When he arrives in her dressing room, Maxa notices the flowers and asks him to throw them away. The two are intrigued by one another, both noting they are not what either expected of a typical journalist or actress. After Maxa leaves for her next performance, Jean begins to look around her dressing room, and notices the note attached to the flowers he brought her, which expresses her admirers love for her performances on stage, notably her deaths, and how they cannot wait to murder her in real life. Jean reads that the note is from a J. After Jean leaves, an unknown man is seen entering Paula's dressing room, and stealing the postcard on her mirror. The next morning, Paula awakes with a scream from a nightmare in which a man wearing a mask and using a cane has followed her to a caf\u00e9 and killed her. She then has a vision of a girl in her bathtub, playing with dolls. The girl looks visibly deceased, with pale skin and blue lips. Paula takes medication, and the girl disappears. Jean is seen next at work with a stab wound on his hip. When a coworker tells Jean to have it checked by a doctor, Jean ignores him. He goes to see his boss, who asks him how his story is coming along. Although Jean wants to focus his story on the people of the theater, his boss reveals that he has been sent to investigate the link between numerous murders that have occurred in town recently and those portrayed on stage. He believes killers have been drawing inspiration from the fictitious murders for their real-life killings. Later that day, Jean goes to see Paula and asks her on a date.\nPaula arrives at work the next day and continues to have visions of the same girl from the bathtub, who is now on a beach, calling out to her by the name Marie-Ther\u00e8se. Paula receives a package that night containing the new dress she is to wear for her performance, with a note that reads \"This is the end, I am going to kill you one final time!\" from the same sender. Her date with Jean arrives and she is visibly distraught. At the same time, the unknown man from her dressing room is seen there again, this time smelling her perfume and trying on her wigs and makeup. The special effects director Paul finds the man there and asks him to leave. The man explains that he and Paul have a deal in which he delivers him dead bodies to use for the special effects in his plays, and in return he is allowed to admire Paula. He explains that he has come to finally kill her. After their date, Paula and Jean go back to her apartment. She asks him how he got the wound on his hip, and he explains that he was caught in an affair with a married woman, and her husband delivered the stab wound to him when he caught them in the bathroom. Now that he has told her his secret, he asks her what secrets she has been keeping from him. Paula reveals that her sister Aimee ran away from home when she was younger to become an actress, and they would meet in secret as to not alert their parents of her whereabouts. She tells him that during this time she began courting with a man named Jean, who had a limp and used a cane, due to a case of polio when he was younger. One day, Jean offered to take her and her sister to the beach. When they arrived at the dunes, he became violent and tried to rape Paula. As she tried to fight him, he beat her unconscious, with the last thing she remembers being him turning to rape her sister Aimee. When she awoke, Aimee's throat was slit and the man was gone. Paula reveals that she blames herself for not being able to save her sister or catch her killer, as she explains the man allegedly committed suicide before the police could arrest him. She tells Jean that she still hears the click of his cane when she is walking home at night, as though he is there. The two kiss and it is assumed that Jean spends the night at Paula's apartment.\nA woman named Violette is seen at a bar, flirting with the same man from Paula's dressing room, in hopes of having sex. The man accepts her advances and the two go back to his apartment. Once there, the man tries to kill her and Violette desperately tries to escape. The man slices her throat and Violette dies. The special effects director, Paul, is seen the next morning reluctantly picking up Violette's body from the man.  At Le Petit Journal, Jean's coworker tells him that Marie-Therese Beau, who is best known under her stage name Paula Maxa, was raped by a man named Jean De Lancry, who also killed her sister. Jean remembers a fan of Paula's that he met the first at the theater, named Eugene De Lancry, and connects him to the murders and the threats that Paula has received. He tells his boss that he is finished his story and uncovered the identity of the man behind the murders, but in exchange, wishes for three months salary, and two tickets to Los Angeles. Jean then rushes to the theater in an attempt to save Paula, but is confronted by the theater director Andre, who tells him that no one can save Paula, as she is his property and the property of the theater, revealing that those working in the theater are complicit in the murders. Jean is forced out into a cab by the jealous husband who swore to kill him in revenge, and he watches as Paula enters the theater, unknowingly to her death. Paula finds Paul, who has created a special effects piece for her, that will make it appear as though her throat has been sliced for tonight's appearance.

In order to defame GoCabs, Pugazhendhi then hires many wanted suspects to commit crimes in GoCabs taxis as drivers. His plan works in the initial days after several news of GoCabs drivers committing crimes to go viral. Some people in Chennai are even doubting the safety of GoCabs taxis; moreover, some police officers are also investigating Vinayak's responsibility in the cases, and authorities are also filing a lawsuit against Vinayak.\nMeanwhile, Raghav was a brilliant boxer that lived with his father Chandramouli, who had special emotion to old things: his car, which he names Padmini, has been used for longer than 20 years that cannot even start sometimes; and a phone that is only available for phone calls and SMS. People around him always tried to persuade him to buy a new car that works well and change his phone to a new model that he can use Facebook and WhatsApp with. He rejected them all, insisting that he will use the old things to the very end. Raghav was trying to get a sponsorship from Vinayak for a major boxing fight, but the latter rejected him. Raghav then approached Azhagar and got his sponsorship. With that sponsorship, Raghav won the race and gave the award - a new car - to his father. Chandramouli was moved by his son's gift and invited him out for a drive at midnight. During the drive, their car was run over by a truck, which killed Chandramouli and severely injured Raghav.\nThat was all that happened before the first scene of the movie - Raghav waking up in a hospital. He soon learns that his father died in the accident and that his nervous system is also incurably injured, making him no longer able to see things more than two feet away. By then, he still believes that what changed his life was an accident, until several days later, a stranger approaches his house.\nThe stranger is an officer carrying the death certificate of a woman named Bairavi to ask for Chandramouli's signature. As Chandramouli is no more and Raghav, his girlfriend Madhu, and his friend Padmani do not know who Bairavi is, they tell the officer that he came to the wrong place. Still, the officer insists that Chandramouli is the one he is looking for, and he has other papers with Chandramouli's signature. Raghav reviews the papers and confirms that the signature is indeed his father's. In contrast, the papers show that his father is the one who hosted Bairavi's funeral just a few days before his own death because he was the only connected person of Bairavi.\nThey decide to discover his father's untold story, so they approach Chandramouli's close friend Ramamurthy, who later tells them the shocking story. Bairavi, a single woman with no children or parents, was Chandramouli's friend. They got to know each other not long ago when she was trying to buy his car at a high price because the car reminds her of her deceased father, who had the same car. She was also the one that helped Raghav get Azhagar's sponsorship because she was the financial manager of Azhagar's company. Bairavi was recently killed by a GoCabs driver, similar to other GoCabs cases. Still, shortly after her death, Chandramouli told Ramamurthy that Bairavi was not killed by the driver, but by someone else he knew. He asked Ramamurthy's help to reveal the truth, so Ramamurthy took him to a senior police officer to report it. The officer, however, warned him not to get involved in this case, because many big shots are behind it. Chandramouli is seen confused on the night of the same day where he asks Raghav for a drive at 3:00 AM, and that was when he was killed.\nRaghav then finds the driver's name from the FIR copy and confronts him, who tells him that it was a mistake as he lost control over the vehicle. Still, he is later caught red-handed by Raghav as he overhears the driver speaking to Pugazhendhi about Raghav's confrontation. Raghav chases him only to find him hanging dead in an isolated factory. Later, Padmani informs him about Bairavi's phone found in Chandramouli's car, which has pieces of evidence of Bairavi's murder. To find out who the murderer is, Raghav plots to trap the next murderer from GoCabs and sends Madhu and her colleagues in GoCabs. Everybody reaches safe except Madhu, who alerts Raghav when the cab driver stops the car in a remote area. He comes at the right time and catches the driver, who confesses that he was instructed by Pugazhendhi to do so. Raghav finds Pugazhendhi in a bar and chases him, but he escapes. The next day, he is found dead after he uploads a video of his confession about the murders, blaming Azhagar in social media. Raghav then visits Vinayak, who acts naive but is the real culprit, which was found by Raghav on the same day when he chased the lorry driver as he sees Vinayak's reflection in a mirror. Raghav fights with Vinayak and finally burns him to death. The next day, all news channels reportedly telecast the news saying that Vinayak had escaped, no one knows his whereabouts, and police are in search of him.\nFinally, Raghav is seen smiling happily in Chandramouli's restored car.", "tmdb_id": 498366}, "63964537": {"title": "Mr. Virgin", "plot": "Three men \u2014 Dhal Bahadur (Gaurav Pahari), Pavitra Prassad (Bijay Baral), and Kumar Kancha (Kamal Mani Nepal) \u2014 are in their mid-thirties.

Enraged that her father once again chose his career over her, Iris stops speaking to him and his wife Mary files for divorce.\nTwelve years later, Earl visits his granddaughter Ginny to attend her wedding rehearsal, not telling his family that the only reason he's there is because his flower farming business has gone bankrupt, and his home has just been foreclosed on by the bank. While there, he is spotted by a member of a drug cartel who had been tipped off by one of Earl's former employees as to his financial problems. Earl accepts the gangster's offer and becomes a \"mule\", transporting cocaine through Illinois for the cartel.\nFacing little suspicion due to his age, ethnicity, spotless criminal history, and strict adherence to driving laws, Earl is soon entrusted with huge amounts of drugs, the delivery of which earns him thousands of dollars. Over time, Earl gets more involved with the cartel and becomes one of their best mules. With the money he buys a new truck, buys back his home, and even pays for badly needed renovations on behalf of the local VFW post (which had been damaged in a fire). Earl even pays for Ginny's wedding and tuition so she can attend college.\nMeanwhile, Special Agent Colin Bates moves to the Chicago DEA office and is assigned Agent Trevino as his partner. They are tasked with narrowing in on the cartel's deliveries to Chicago. Bates and Trevino find an informant from within the cartel and start looking for their most profitable driver, Tata (grandfather). The head of the cartel, Laton, is overjoyed with Earl's success and invites him to a party. Earl mistakenly believes that the cartel considers him their friend. Things take a turn for the worse when Laton is assassinated and replaced by another gangster, Gustavo. Gustavo is more bloodthirsty and controlling than Laton and demands Earl be kept under tighter control.\nIn the middle of a $12 million cocaine shipment, Earl winds up in a diner with Bates. Neither man recognizes the other, and the elderly Earl gives Bates advice to try and mend fences with his wife and not make the mistakes Earl has made. Earl then leaves to conclude the delivery of the shipment but then gets a call from Ginny, who informs him that Mary is gravely ill. Earl initially tells Ginny there's nothing he can do until she rebukes him for his perceived lack of care.

Gustavo agrees to this demand and allows Earl to continue. Earl proceeds to the drop point but the DEA agents finally catch up and arrest him; Bates has a pleasant aside with Earl before sending him away.

His daily routine includes Namaz at a nearby mosque followed by some chit-chat over a cup of tea from a tea stall managed and owned by one of his close Hindu neighbors. His close-knit family consists of his wife Tabassum (Neena Gupta), brother Bilaal (Manoj Pahwa) who owns a mobile phone shop, brother's wife Chhoti-Tabassum (Prachee Shah Pandya), nephew Shahid (Prateik Babbar) and niece Aayat (Eshita Singh, credited as Vartika Singh). Murad's son Aftab (Indraneil Sengupta) stays abroad with his wife Aarti (Taapsee Pannu), who is a lawyer and is estranged from the family.\nThe story begins on the day of Murad's 65th birthday, when Aarti comes to visit them. The family enjoys a lovely night with the neighbors and friends. Another story is shown in parallel, where it is revealed that Shahid has joined hands with a terrorist organization headed by the wanted Mehfooz Alam (Sumit Kaul) who assigns Shahid with the task of a bomb blast. After the night of the anniversary celebrations, Shahid leaves early morning for Allahabad and executes the attack as planned with two other acquaintances. A lot of innocent people get killed and SSP Danish Javed (Rajat Kapoor) is assigned with the task to investigate the crime. He tracks down everyone involved with the attack, corners Shahid and finally shoots him dead as he tries to escape instead of surrendering.\nSoon, police arrives at Murad's house and starts interrogating the family members. They turn the place upside down to gather evidence. As the news spreads across, people starts to flock outside Murad's house. Police takes Bilaal into custody for further interrogation. Aarti steps up as the defense lawyer for Bilaal and escorts him to police station. Danish interrogates Bilaal for over 17 hours but gets no useful information.\nWithin a matter of hours, the situation around Murad's neighborhood changes drastically. Everyone whom Murad had known for decades starts looking at him as a terrorist. His life's reputation and goodwill gets shattered in a day. Bilaal is taken to court for hearing and the judge Harish Madhok (Kumud Mishra) denies his bail and grants police custody of him for 7 days for further interrogation. After postmortem, police brings Shahid's body to hand it over to Murad, but he refuses to accept. Despite him strongly condemning Shahid's act, situation worsens around Murad's neighborhood where people tag his entire family as terrorists trying to shame them in every possible way. Stones get pelted inside the house and \"Go back to Pakistan\" gets written on their boundary wall. On the other hand, some of the Muslims with extremist mindset approach Murad and try to convince him that Shahid has sacrificed his life in the name of Jihad. He is a true martyr and all the Muslims should appreciate his act and rise up against Hindu dominant society which Murad strongly opposes. Despite everything, the family maintains their compose and relies on legal procedures to get their names cleared.\nAs the legal proceedings begin after 7 days, public prosecutor Santosh Anand (Ashutosh Rana) tries to convince the court that this act of Shahid is not a standalone incident but an eye opener about how Muslims are breeders of terrorists. He argues that every single member of Murad's family was aware and supportive of Shahid's action and his home was the den of terrorist operations. As evidence, he presents Shahid's laptop which has detail procedure of how to make bombs, a transmitter which was installed at Murad's home to communicate with the terrorists via private frequencies, CCTV footage of Bilaal giving lift to Mefooz Alam and him selling SIM cards to terrorists without asking for any valid documents. Based on all these facts, he requests the judge to consider Murad also as a person of interest in this case and remove him as Bilaal's defense lawyer. The court agrees, Murad has to step down and Aarti takes his place as the main lawyer for this case.\nWith things turning against him at court, Bilaal, who is already tired, ashamed, confused, saddened, tortured and humiliated, suffers a massive heart attack and passes away on his way to the hospital. Murad's family again suffers another setback and now everything comes down to Aarti to get her father-in-law and his family acquitted of all the charges that were laid upon them on the basis of mere prejudice.\nAarti tries to justify in court that there is no evidence against any of the family members except Shahid that they were involved with terrorism. Shahid was the only person who knew how to operate a laptop and the transmitter was installed by him under the excuse to boost cable TV signal. Since he had access to Bilaal's mobile shop he only took those SIM cards without any document and used those to communicate with the terrorists. Bilaal had no idea who Mehfooz Alam was and so when he came to meet Shahid, he assumed him to be his friend and offered him a drop at the railway station since he was also heading in the same direction. Aarti also argues that it has become a mindset of people to consider all Muslims as terrorists and someone just by growing a beard or practicing Islam becomes a terrorist in public eye. Just because of this established taboo about Muslims, Murad and his family is going through this horrible trauma and humiliation which even claimed Bilaal's life.\nPublic prosecutor Santosh Anand fails to produce any further evidence and the court concludes that all evidences against Murad and his family are circumstantial thereby dropping all charges against them. Judge Harish Madhok dismisses the case stating that the main problem is with people's mentality and everyone irrespective of their religion should fight against it to bring a change.\nThe movie ends with giving it's viewers the moral that we should change our way of thinking from \"Us and Them\" to \"We\".", "tmdb_id": 526090}, "66107824": {"title": "Mulshi Pattern", "plot": "The film opens with the gangster Rahul Patil a.k.a.

Commissioner Moon and Secretary Gong brings in negotiators from the National Intelligence Services to take over and orders Chae-youn, Ahn, and even Han to leave the site.\nOutside, Han reveals to them that Lee is a black agent working for the NIS, whose mission was to spy on Min's syndicate. She tells them that Min is an arms dealer working in the Malacca Straits, selling every kind of weapons and equipment to other criminals in majority of the Southeast-Asian countries. Chae-youn's two colleagues arrive in their van, and Chae-youn sought to find out the truth themselves. She then asks Ahn to follow Yoon and ask him further. Back inside, the NIS team approached Min aggressively, demanding that Min release his hostages or otherwise they will bombard his location, killing Agent Lee with him. Unbothered, Min reveals that he had also kidnapped a family of four, keeping the NIS under his thumb. Min demands to bring Chae-youn back as he will only talk to her. \nWith no other choice, Chief Han goes over to bring Chae-youn, along with her team, back inside. This time, Chae-youn demands to the NIS to tell her everything that they know about Min. Min demands to Chae-youn to bring Koo Gwan-su\u2014chairman of Nine Electronics, an arms company. As they wait, the NIS tells Chae-youn that Min used to work for Koo as the man in charge for dealing with the company's illegal activities. When Min decided to work alone as an arms dealer in Malacca Straits, Koo betrays Min and tipped him off to the NIS. Koo also revealed the $50 million worth of taxes that he had evaded, and due to his 'honesty', the government practically erased his criminal activities. When Chae-youn asks where Koo really is, the NIS agent reveals to her that they were all inside the Nine Electrics weapons laboratory. Koo himself had funded the entire operation of the NIS to hunt Min down. \nIn a hotel suite lounge somewhere downtown were Koo, NIS Deputy Chief Park In-kyu, Air Force Commander Son Jung-tae, and the Chief of National Security himself, Hwang Ju-ik. These four men had been keeping a close eye on the entire operation. Meanwhile, Ahn found out from the escaping Yoon that NIS Deputy Chief Park was the one who asked him to give Agent Lee a false Daehan Daily ID. Koo arrives to the site and begins to talk with Min. Min asks Koo to restore a certain Swiss bank account, and Koo agrees to it. However, Min had further demands. He asks Koo why he had killed a woman named Yoo Hyun-ju. Koo denies any knowledge of any Hyun-ju, and Min began to tell Chae-youn of Hyun-ju. Min introduced Hyun-ju to Koo as his secretary. In reality, Hyun-ju was to keep records of hidden, expensive paintings that Koo owned and kept. \nThese paintings worth 10 billion won each, and profits from these paintings would be shared between Koo, Park, Son, and Hwang. Some of the paintings were kept in a house that Hyun-ju and presumably her husband stayed in. It is revealed that Hyun-ju was the woman who died in Chae-youn's arms ten days ago, and Min convinces Chae-youn that something was amiss during that operation, which resulted to Hyun-ju's death, and the disappearance of the paintings in the house almost immediately. To further prove his point, Min plays an audio recording of a conversation between the four corrupt men. This recording was done by Hwang himself, where Min explained that Hwang never fully trusted the three other men he was working with, and had a habit of keeping recording devices for important conversations. Min then demands for Hwang to show up and talk to him in one hour, otherwise he'll kill every hostage\u2014including the children.\nChae-youn and her team validates the information Min had given as they try to figure out the connection of Min and Hyun-ju. Secretary Gong lies to Chae-youn, telling her that Hwang was with the President, and that he couldn't come. Meanwhile, Ahn was able to track down Chief Park's phone records. There, he found out that Captain Jung had accepted a bribe from Chief Park. Captain Jung was under the command of Chief Park, and that their plan was to kill Hyun-ju by using the Filipino kidnappers as an alibi. Chae-youn resumes the negotiations with Min, telling Min that Hyun-ju's case will be reopened. Min demands to talk with Commissioner Moon. Min asks if Koo is really being questioned by the police, and that if Hwang is really with the President. Before answering, they found out from a Thai server that Min had been live-streaming the entire situation on YouTube, which sends the country to a frenzy. \nUpon figuring out that Koo is not being questioned, and that Hwang is in hiding, Min shoots Agent Lee in the leg. He gives Hwang one last chance to show himself. Back in their lounge, Hwang orders Chief Park to invent a story and Commander Son to begin the military operation immediately. Hwang wants Min dead, along with the hostages. Meanwhile, Ahn returns to Hyun-ju's home, where the kidnapping ten days ago occurred. There, he found a photo of Somang Orphanage, an old orphanage where Hyun-ju came from. He goes over to the new orphanage, and he found out that Hyun-ju's real name wasn't Yoon Hyun-ju, but Min Hyun-ju\u2014she was Min's younger sister. Back in the lab, the military team arrived in Min's location and authorizes the mission, despite Chae-youn's protests. Min reveals that a bomb is strapped on one of the hostages, revealing a suicide for all of them. Either way, the team blows up a signal tower\u2014stopping their communication. \nChae-youn tries to stop the team from entering Min's hideout as a bomb is present. Hwang (through Commander Son) pressures them to continue, and the team enters the hideout. However, as soon as they moved in, the room had exploded, presumably from Min's suicide bomb, and killing the hostages inside. Hwang and his cronies were finally able to relax, and the NIS were packing up their things. As Chae-youn stares at the last footages of their negotiations with Min in despair, she notices through the background that Min wasn't in Southeast Asia, but in South Korea all along. That night, Ahn went to the old orphanage building and found all of the hostages safe. Meanwhile, Min and his gang arrived at the Nine Electronics weapons lab. He orders his fellow gang to go home, and takes the bomb with him. Min storms the lounge and finally catches Hwang, Koo, Park, and Son, with the bomb strapped to his chest. \nChae-youn convinced Secretary Gong to reveal the true location of Hwang and his cronies, so that they can stop Min. Min shoots Koo, activates the bomb via a detonator, and Chae-youn arrives at the lounge to finally meet Min. She apologizes to Min for not being able to protect Hyun-ju, and she vows to defend Min at any cost to bring the remaining cronies to justice. Min reveals to her that he asked Hyun-ju to betray Koo by stealing every bit of information he had. He believed that his plan ultimately led to his sister's death. He raises the gun at Hwang, and he was shot to the head by a sniper outside. A flashback reveals that Min backfired with his plan, telling his sister that the plan is too dangerous after all. However, Hyun-ju wanted to proceed with the plan, so that the two of them can find a place to live in silence and peace.\nAs the team arrive to escort Hwang, Park, Son, and Chae-youn outside, Chae-youn overheard that the detonator wasn't actually turned on, and it was Min's plan to die in the end, and bring the corrupt men to justice. Chae-youn chases Hwang outside, prematurely telling them of their arrest as she shouts their rights to them. As their car leaves, the reporters then surround Chae-youn. Chae-youn and Ahn went to an overlooking spot, where they made a makeshift memorial for Min and Hyun-ju. Chae-youn shows Ahn of Min's pen drive presumably with the dealings of Hwang and his cronies, as stolen by Hyun-ju. In court, Hwang, Park, Son, and Chae-youn appear, with Chae-youn as a prime witness. The pen drive is revealed to the court as evidence, and the film ends with Chae-youn reciting an oath.", "tmdb_id": 542836}, "56864702": {"title": "Nela Ticket", "plot": "Nela Ticket (Ravi Teja) is an orphan raised in an orphanage in Bangalore belonging to Ananda Bhupathi (Sarath Babu).

She uses their rent money to pay for it and arranges for both of them to do extra hours at the restaurant to make up for the money they spent on the trip. However, Dustin, Jessie's goofy older brother and both girls' roommate, spends his part of the rent in a failed drug sale he attempted with his friends.

While there, he is mesmerized by Girl with Blue Hair, a modernist sculpture by Eugen Hoffmann. Later at home, Kurt walks in on Elisabeth playing the piano in the nude. She rambles euphorically, saying she is \"playing a concert for the F\u00fchrer\" and hits herself on the head with a glass ashtray. She also tells Kurt to \"never look away\" because \"everything that is true holds beauty in it.\"\nElisabeth is diagnosed with schizophrenia and is sterilized and murdered under the Nazi euthanasia program. The doctor who orders her sterilization and death is gynecologist Professor Carl Seeband, a high-ranking member of the SS medical corps. After the war, he is arrested by the Russians and placed in a prison camp. While there, he volunteers to assist a Red Army officer's wife during a complicated birth and saves the lives of both wife and child. The grateful Russian officer releases Seeband and thereafter helps to keep evidence of his Nazi past from catching up with him.\nAs an adult, Kurt studies painting at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts, where he falls in love with a young fashion design student named Elisabeth (like his aunt), whom he calls Ellie. She is the daughter of Professor Seeband, though none of them are aware of their shared history and connection. Kurt excels in his studies, but is forced to complete paintings that reflect socialist realism, an ideology and school of art with which he does not identify. Eventually, he meets Ellie's father, who is now toeing the East German socialist party line. Seeband sees Kurt as genetically inferior to and therefore unsuitable for his daughter and goes to great lengths to sabotage the young couple's relationship, even forcing Ellie to have an abortion due to a made-up health concern when she becomes pregnant with Kurt's child. However, the young couple's love strengthens and eventually the two get married. Fearing prosecution after the Russian officer who had been protecting him is transferred to Moscow, Seeband flees East Germany for West Germany.\nKurt and Ellie flee to West Germany themselves several years later. Since Kurt is already 30 years old, he lies about his age to be admitted to the famous D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy, where he is able to study and practice art more freely than he could in East Germany. His teacher, Professor Antonius van Verten (based on Joseph Beuys) recognizes Kurt's deep personal experience, but also sees that he is struggling to find his own voice, having been trained only in figurative painting, a medium considered outdated and \"bourgeois\" by the standards of the school. Kurt shares adjoining studio space with fellow student and confidant Harry Preusser (inspired by G\u00fcnther Uecker), who experiments with hammering nails into boards to produce large artworks.\nOnly when Kurt finds a newspaper article about a captured Nazi doctor who was Seeband's superior does he have his artistic breakthrough. He starts using his figurative painting skills to copy black-and-white photographs onto canvases, adding a mysterious sfumato blur. Among the sources for the new paintings are Seeband's passport photographs and photographs of Kurt with Aunt Elisabeth from his own family album. When Seeband sees a painting that is a collage of himself, the captured Nazi doctor, and Kurt with Elisabeth, he abruptly leaves the studio. It is unclear if he is simply overwhelmed at being reminded of his past, just realized Elisabeth was Kurt's relative, or believes his son-in-law has uncovered his secret, but Kurt, for his part, still seems to be unaware of the connection.\nAfter years of infertility due to the abortion, Ellie becomes pregnant, and Kurt celebrates the moment she told him by painting her nude. Some time later, he gets his first art show, where his art impresses the critics, even though they completely misunderstand and misinterpret it.

Locking himself in her apartment, he witnesses a family escaping from an apartment across the street only to be swarmed and killed by zombies as they attempt to escape in their car.

The zombies have seemingly taken over all of Paris, are very fast moving, and respond in hordes to any sight or sound.

Clare presents the mission to Billy as her desire to rendezvous with her husband on his journey. At first, Clare is domineering and racist toward Billy while he sees her as being no different to the other colonists who murdered his family members, but their mutual hostility dissipates during their time together and they gradually bond as they learn about each other's tragic upbringings, with both gaining an increased appreciation for each other's culture.

Alexa notices bruising on her shoulder, but then instead of asking her about it, only helps her cover it with makeup and hide it with her hair. She takes a selfie in the outfit and posts it online. This angers Rob, who loudly and publicly shames her in the hallway, telling her she looks like a \"cheap slut\".\nLater, thinking Rob's parents are away, Sarah goes to his house to apologize. She is surprised to be greeted by his mother (Ona Grauer), whom she never met. He turns the situation around on her, claiming she intentionally planned her visit as a way of meeting his mother. He angrily declares it \"wasn't the right time\", and when she leaves, he follows her outside. The situation escalates as he accuses her of always nagging him, after which he punches her so hard that she falls to the ground, injured. Stunned and upset, she breaks up with him and runs away, telling him not to contact her.\nWhen she arrives home, Sarah finds Laura silent on the couch. She hides her injuries as Laura informs her that her own boyfriend just broke up with her. Just as it looks like Sarah might open up to her, she takes a phone call from work and Sarah storms off to her room. When Laura comes in, she notices Sarah's injuries. She lies, saying she fell and \"Rob wasn't even there\", then verbally takes her frustration out on Laura. Later that day, Rob promises to stop abusing her, and they get back together. He gives her a ring, making her promise that they will be together forever.\nWhen Sarah tells Nikki that she and Rob broke up and got back together, Nikki says that he's not going to change. Sarah accuses her of betrayal, and walks off to be with him. Upset and confused, Nikki seeks out the ex-girlfriend she'd seen earlier at Rob's family lake house, hoping to get information and advice. When they meet, she describes to Nikki the abuse she suffered at his hands. She tells Nikki she stopped talking to him altogether, but never reported it because she didn't want to be \"that girl\" and that \"it's not a good look\" to stay with a guy who was abusing her. Nikki asks her how she can help Sarah, and she advises her just to be there for Sarah, no matter who she dates.\nAt the dance, Nikki sees Sarah for the first time since their fight and apologizes to her. She gladly accepts and apologizes too. On the dance floor, when Rob notices her speaking and laughing with another boy, he pushes him and then drags her outside. Nikki and Gus follow them to the parking lot and intervene, so that he can't hurt her again. With Nikki's support, she finally decides she has had enough of his abuse, and breaks up with him.\nIn the days that follow, Sarah ignores Rob's attempts to contact her. He finally tricks her into talking to him by having Jacqueline (Sarah Grey) convince her to do so. She reluctantly agrees to let him give her a ride home, and only to tell him it's really over and that she is done. She gets into his car to discover a drunken, passed-out Zack (Trezzo Mahoro) in the back seat. Rather than taking her home, he tells her that he's taking her for a drive.\nThe next day, Sarah's friends and family are alarmed to discover that she is missing. Zack tells Nikki he doesn't know what happened to her, because he was passed out in the back seat of Rob's car. He says that when he asked Rob about it, he claimed that they dropped her off at home, but Zack noticed that her purse was still in the car. Nikki immediately calls Laura to let her know, and she tells her Rob is there with her. Nikki then tells her about his abuse toward Sarah. Shaking, she hangs up and questions him, revealing that she knows about the abuse. When he denies it, she angrily tells him to leave. She and Nikki go to Rob's family lake house, where they find Sarah's ring. A police search team is sent into the lake, where they find her body.\nAs Rob is arrested by the police and charged with first degree of murder, his mother calls his father about needing a lawyer for him. At the trial (used as the framing wraparound for the film), Judge Elizabeth Hanover (Mira Sorvino) presides over the different testimonies. On the stand, Laura firmly tells Nikki that what happened to Sarah was not her fault, and tells the court that they should be looking at Rob's actions. A flashback to the night of the murder reveals that he accidentally asphyxiated her.\nJudge Hanover reads the guilty verdict and then tells the witnesses to tell someone next time they see a friend being abused instead of standing by and doing nothing, implying how it could have saved Sarah from getting killed by quoting \"Between the years 2001 and 2012, we lost 6,488 souls in battles fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. But during that same time period, 11,766 women were killed, but by their own partners. This is a war that we, in this country, refuse to address. It has to stop because things have gotten so dire that this is what a victory looks like; and I am sorry, folks, but today was no victory. This case should not be closed, because when it comes to domestic violence, there needs to be change on a cultural level, and that change needs to start with each and every one of you.\"\nAt school, a memorial for Sarah is created in the hallway, where friends leave photos, flowers, and mementos.

Despite his reservations, Varun is sworn in as Chief Minister.\nDespite being head of government, CM Varun, who has no idea about all this, accepts for it, provided that his father will be out in bail within two weeks and remains confined in a self-imposed house arrest. Varun actually does nothing except play video games in his room and signs the documents provided by the Chief Secretary. Unfortunately, consequences turn plates negatively to Vinodhan, who is sentenced to prison in the high court appeal until end of case. After Vinodhan gets arrested, riots take place in the city. In the riots, a bus gets burnt in which a little schoolgirl dies in the fire. Varun, who was out to meet his guru Mahendran (Sathyaraj) goes to the spot where the bus was burnt. He asks Mahendran to meet him at the spot. He is heartbroken upon seeing the wails of the little girl's mother. He then realizes the importance of his position and stops the riots, by threatening, in an immediate press meeting on the accident spot. Unfortunately, this is not liked by the opposition party led by Varadarajan (K.S.G.Venkatesh). Varun then gains the name \"Rowdy CM\" given by the opposition party after being mocked as \"Dummy CM\".\nOn the other side, Vinodhan thinks the reason why he passed on the post to his son reason was due to the advice of a swamiji Satyananda (Tej Sapru) who predicted that there is a threat to Vinodhan's position and that he has to resign, while the position has to be taken up by someone of his own bloodline. Vinodhan doubts if Varun is his own son because years ago, Varun's mother (Abhirami Venkatachalam) realized that Vinodhan was a famous actor at that time and was cheating on her with other co-actresses. During a heated argument, she tells him that she might also be cheating on him, which angers him, and he almost chokes her to death. The next day she is found dead, having taken 23 sleeping pills. Thus, Vinodhan never got the answer if Varun was ever his son. Meanwhile, Vinodhan is attacked in a bomb blast by some anonymous men and gets admitted in the hospital, which leads him into a coma. Now, since Varun has to take the responsibility as the CM, he goes through his father's things, in which he finds a diary with codes and bank accounts. He, along with his friend Wong, investigates about it.  Due to sudden heavy rain, a dam was required to be opened without prior notice opening. It turned out that the officials were waiting for the CM's order. Varun mocks them by telling them to wait until Vinodhan is released from jail, but he later acts immediately, creating awareness and asking the youths to help; thus, when the dam was opened, it only destroyed properties but not lives. Also, Mahendran talks to Varun and his daughter Swathi (Mehreen Pirzada) about his first love, which was broken due to his friend's selfishness. When Varun stands for the post as CM, a video of him which was taken earlier that had him kissing a foreigner named Sylvia (Brooklyn) in a nightclub party is released, but in reality, he was drugged by the opposition party.

Vinodhan, hearing his daughter Narmada talking to his second-wife about Varun winning the temporary election and the clean sweep of the bank accounts, wakes up from his coma and asks for Varun. Thus, when he visits, Vinodhan acts in a way to gain his son's pity. Believing this, he tells it to Mahendran, to which he replies that his father was an actor and there is trouble yet to come.\nMeanwhile, a chain of events begin to happen: Swathi meets with an accident; Wong ends up being caught in Panama but somehow escapes; and the foreigner commits suicide and blames it on Varun, who is searched by the police to be arrested, but Varun, with the help of Varadarajan's daughter Kayal (Sanchana Natarajan), stays in her house, where treatment is given to Swathi.

Mahendran admits that he did not meet her after that. He also said that Varun was Vinodhan's own son and not any other's. Vinodhan realizes his mistake and asks Varun to forgive him.

Captain Philip brings Clara to the palace, where she meets the regents of each land: the Sugar Plum Fairy of the Land of Sweets; Shiver of the Land of Snowflakes, and Hawthorne of the Land of Flowers. They tell Clara they are at war with the Land of Amusements, which they refer to as \"the Fourth Realm\". It is also revealed that Marie was the beloved Queen of this magical land and, thus, Clara is the princess.\nThe Sugar Plum Fairy explains that Marie created this world as a young girl and that she animated everyone with a machine that can turn toys into real people. Sugar Plum says this machine can be used to defend the three realms against Mother Ginger, but it needs a key matching the one for Clara's egg. Sneaking into the Fourth Realm, Clara and Philip steal back the key from Mother Ginger (ignoring her warning that Sugar Plum is lying to them), but Clara is disappointed to discover that the egg is only a music box.\nSugar Plum uses the machine to bring toy soldiers to life and orders them to attack the Fourth Realm. She then reveals that she lied about Mother Ginger, who had resisted Sugar Plum's plan to take over all four realms in revenge for her perceived abandonment by Marie, and that the machine can turn this world's people back into toys as well. She imprisons Clara, Captain Philip, and the male regents, causing Clara to blame herself.\nClara opens her egg-shaped music box again and discovers a mirror, illustrating that all she needed was herself. She and the other prisoners escape. One of Mother Ginger's mice shows Clara into the engine room, and Captain Philip convinces Mother Ginger to help overthrow Sugar Plum. Clara shuts down the machine while fighting off soldiers with Mother Ginger's aid. Sugar Plum attempts to turn Mother Ginger back into a toy, but Clara tinkers with the engine so it aims back at Sugar Plum when activated, turning her back into a porcelain doll and rendering her entire army lifeless.\nThanked for restoring peace among the Realms and the destruction of Sugar Plum, Clara promises to visit in the future. After saying goodbye to Captain Philip, she returns to London, where time has hardly passed since she left. She and Benjamin apologize to each other and she finally decides to dance with him. He accepts, and Clara opens her music box. Benjamin reveals that the music was the first song that he and Marie had ever danced to.

Despite introducing himself with a fake name, Forrest becomes drawn to Jewel to the point of revealing that he is a bank robber.

She attends both her classes and his, taking notes and transcribing lectures while caring for Martin and their infant daughter Jane. Two years later, Martin's cancer is in remission and he is hired by a firm in New York City. Ruth petitions Harvard Law School Dean Griswold to allow her to complete her Harvard law degree with classes at Columbia Law School in New York, but he insists on following Harvard University policies at the time and denies her request, so she transfers to Columbia. In spite of graduating at the top of her class, she is unable to find a position with a law firm because none of the firms she applies to want to hire a woman. She takes a job as a professor at Rutgers Law School, teaching \"Sex Discrimination and the Law\".\nIn 1970, Martin brings Moritz v. Commissioner, a tax law case, to Ruth's attention. Charles Moritz is a man from Denver who had to hire a nurse to help him care for his aging mother so he could continue to work. Moritz was denied a tax deduction for the nursing care because at the time Section 214 of the Internal Revenue Code specifically limited the deduction to \"a woman, a widower or divorc\u00e9e, or a husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized\". The court ruled that Moritz, a man who had never married, did not qualify for the deduction. Ruth sees in this case an opportunity to begin to challenge the many laws enacted over the years that assume that men will work to provide for the family, and women will stay home and take care of the husband and children. She believes that if she could set a precedent ruling that a man was unfairly discriminated against on the basis of sex, that precedent could be cited in cases challenging laws that discriminate against women\u2014and she believes that an appellate court composed entirely of male judges would find it easier to identify with a male appellant.\nRuth meets with Mel Wulf of the ACLU to try to enlist their help, but he turns her down. Ruth flies to Denver to meet with Moritz, who agrees to let the Ginsburgs and ACLU represent him pro bono after Ruth convinces him that millions of people could potentially benefit. After reading the draft of the brief, Dorothy Kenyon, who was cold to the idea at first, meets with Wulf in his office and convinces him to sign on. The Ginsburgs and Wulf file an appeal of Moritz's denial with the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Department of Justice Attorney James H. Bozarth asks to be the lead counsel for the defense. Bozarth does a computer search to find all of the sections of the US Code that deal with sex. His defense will contend that, if section 214 is ruled unconstitutional, that will open the door to challenge all of America's sex-based laws. Ruth, having no courtroom experience, does poorly in a moot court, and Wulf convinces her to let Martin lead off arguing the tax law, with Ruth following up with equal protection arguments.\nThe government offers Moritz a settlement of one dollar. Ruth makes a counter-proposal: the government will pay Moritz the sum he claimed as a deduction and make a declaration that he did nothing wrong, and also enter into the record that the sex-based portion of section 214 is unconstitutional. The government declines this proposal because of the constitutionality element. During oral argument at the Court of Appeals, Martin takes more of their side's allotted time than he had intended. Ruth is nervous but makes several key points and reserves four minutes of her time for rebuttal. Bozarth frames his side's argument as defending the American way of life, implying that the Ginsburgs and ACLU want \"radical social change\" and maybe Moritz \"just doesn't want to pay his taxes\". In her rebuttal, Ruth is much more confident. She states that societal roles that existed one hundred years ago, or even twenty years ago, no longer apply. She does not ask the court to change society, but for the law to keep up with societal changes that have already taken place. To a judge's objection that the Constitution does not contain the word \"woman\", she responds vigorously that neither does it contain the word \"freedom\".Outside the courthouse, judgment being reserved, Wulf, Moritz, and the Ginsburgs celebrate that, win or lose, Ruth has finally found her voice as a lawyer. Titles over the closing scene indicate that the Court of Appeals found unanimously in Moritz's favor. Ruth went on to co-found the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, which struck down many of the sex-based laws Bozarth identified, and in 1993 the Senate voted 96 to 3 for her to become an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court.

Having been invited to dinner with his daughter dinner sours when he asks her for money. However, without her knowledge Olavi asks Otto and receives several thousand euro.

Enraged at learning this, Olavi goes and makes a scene at the auction house.

The auctioneer offers to cancel the purchase but Olavi refuses. \nOlavi reads his mail, including a work placement rating card that Otto has filled out as \"6 our of 5\". As he reads, his phone rings and an art historian from Stockholm Museum gives her opinion that the painting is unsigned not because it is a forgery but because, as a portrait of the Christ, it is an icon and icons being made to glorify the divine do not bear the painter's name.\nA short time later while travelling past his old gallery, he sees it refurbished. While tidying his apartment, he dies.\nFollowing the funeral, the auctioneer is engaged to assess Olavi's collection. He says nothing is valuable, not even the unsigned Christ painting which he insists he will buy back for the price Olavi paid despite secretly knowing its value.

In 1954, Mossad agent Peter Malkin mistakenly kills the wrong person while hunting a Nazi war criminal in Austria, damaging his reputation.\nIn Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1960, Sylvia Hermann begins courting the son of Adolf Eichmann, Klaus. At dinner with her German-Jewish father, Lothar, Klaus openly speaks negatively about Jews and claims his father died in the war. Lothar grows suspicious and passes his name along to Mossad in Tel Aviv, Israel. Field agent Zvi Aharoni is dispatched in Buenos Aires to begin reconnaissance. Klaus takes Sylvia to a meeting, which turns out to be a Nazi revival led by Carlos Fuldner, which Eichmann also attends. Sylvia abruptly leaves after the guests erupt in a Sieg Heil chant.\nNow working in coordination with Mossad, Sylvia meets the Eichmann family at their home under the guise of reconciling with Klaus. An argument between her and Klaus causes Eichmann (living under the name Ricardo Klement and claiming to be Klaus's uncle) to intervene; Klaus accidentally refers to him as his father and Eichmann is subsequently photographed by a Mossad agent. Eichmann notices the operative taking his photo and sketches him.\nThe Mossad team uses the evidence from the meeting to confirm Eichmann's identity and plan his capture - they intend to disguise themselves as an El Al air crew and fly him out while he is sedated. Peter and his ex-girlfriend Hanna, a doctor, are brought on to the team with her role to keep Eichmann sedated during their travels. The team coordinates and captures Eichmann outside of his home. While his family and friends try to discern if his disappearance is due to someone discovering his true identity, Eichmann admits his identity to his captors. Meanwhile, the agents learn their return flight has been delayed by ten days. Furthermore, they are informed the airline will not agree to transport Eichmann unless he signs an affidavit stating he will willingly go to Israel; he refuses to sign because he does not believe he will get a fair trial. The team's interrogator is not able to get through to Eichmann and tensions rise among the team; some wish to outright kill Eichmann. Peter eventually obtains the signature after sharing his personal story of the loss of his sister Fruma and her three young children to the Holocaust and listening to Eichmann's story about being ignorant of the actual killing of the Jews, claiming his job was focused exclusively on logistics and he was just \"following orders\".\nDuring the plane's delay and while they await Eichmann's capitulation, Klaus and the police increasingly investigate Eichmann's disappearance, distributing the sketch of the operative to the public. After using US dollars instead of Argentine pesos, one of the Mossad's local contacts is captured and tortured until she reveals the location of the safehouse. As the Mossad team prepare to leave, Eichmann drops his polite fa\u00e7ade and tells Peter a horrific story of watching 5,000 Jews murdered in a pit by the Einsatzgruppen, cruelly wondering aloud if one of them (a woman who had begged Eichmann to save her infant) was Peter's sister.\nWith the Nazis and police bearing down on them, the rest of the team is forced to drastically alter their escape plan, resulting in two operatives having to be left behind. The police also confiscate the  plane's landing permits, grounding it.

Using the assistance of a forward helicopter and a sniper dispatched as part of the assault team, they make significant progress to neutralize the situation and manage to eliminate all the Somali pirates onboard while awaiting the main Chinese fleet on duty in the Red Sea.

Meanwhile, a Chinese-French journalist working in the area receives news that the local terrorist organization, Zaka, are prepared to impede local cooperation with the Chinese by all available military and terrorist means available. The Jiaolong squad manages to save the Chinese civilians caught in the warzone and the PAP gendarmerie forces guarding the ambassador just in a nick of time while also saving an Arabic man forced to participate as a car bomber.\nThe terrorists are also uncovered to have plans to weaponize yellowcake materials into a dirty bomb.

All the Yewaire civilians and local government troops are killed, except the journalist. Zaka uses a kidnapped Chinese citizen as a bargaining chip so that the Chinese navy will release the Yewairian President, and beheads another hostage, who turned to be Abu, Xia Nan's assistant, as an example. Jiaolong and the journalist track down the hostage (first priority of the mission) to a terrorist stronghold with 150 militants, the local leader Sayyid, and armed with mechanized artillery and tanks. The assault team moves in with a risky plan involving covertly swapping the Chinese hostage and the journalist. Although the initial plan goes well at first, the plan backfires when the jeep the team uses gets a flat tire attracting attention, with no other choice the Jiaolong commandos are forced to reveal themselves and fight off hordes of terrorists in the compound. Eventually the Jiaolong commandos are separated with 1 team escaping in a jeep, another in a tank and another attempting to escape through another exit. The enemy sniper Taha from earlier reappears; the replacement Jiaolong sniper and his spotter are able to take him out. The operation eventually succeeds in evacuating all the hostages, but two Jiaolong members are killed in action during the chaos and another two are heavily injured.\nThe four remaining members later wingsuit into the yellowcake exchange site between the terrorists and the rebel group.

In the due course, he manages to land up in Soumiya's college as a lecturer for some event.\nIn the meantime, Harish proposes to Soumiya's friend, but his intentions are towards Soumiya. He gives his number and asks her to call him. Both of them decide to call Harish from a landline outside their hostel so that he will not have their mobile number. Harish, who is waiting outside the hostel, finds the girls, and it is shown that Souimya has feelings for Harish.\nThe next day in a college event, Harish asks Yeman (who is waiting in the car to kidnap Soumiya) to help him in his love. He asks Yeman to act as a kidnapper, and he would come for defense to gain heroism before his love interest. Yeman does as he says but drives the car away, according to his plan. Harish then figures out that it was an actual kidnap and reports this to the police station. When he approaches her parents for a written statement, they deny the kidnap and says that Soumiya went to her grandmother's house. Harish was shocked to hear this and tries to find his own ways to trace out his love. Soumiya gains consciousness and was confused to see her parents in the village.\nYeman's mother then fixes Yeman and Soumiya's marriage, which makes the later surprised as her parents approve of it. Soumiya's father than reveals the flashback. Soumiya's mother belongs to the tribe and married her father. As it was against the tradition, Yeman's mother orders him to kill the groom, for which they come to an agreement to get Yeman married to Soumiya. Yeman's mother approves the proposal and promises that Yeman would never look after any other girl. Godavari, a tribal girl who has an interest on Yeman, was disheartened. Finally, Harish finds the spot and Soumya with Godavari's help. All the plans went in vain.\nKnowing about Godavari, Yeman becomes furious on her and tells that he has been waiting for 14 years to marry Soumiya. In spite of all looks, he would be marrying Soumiya because he has been devoted to Lord Yama for marrying her. Yeman praises to the marriage on Soumiya and asks Harish to leave to rescue their life. On the day of the marriage, Godavari and Soumiya's father plan to spoil the marriage. Harish learns that Soumiya has given him a clue to take her away from the marriage. However, looking at Godavari's efforts and love, Yeman decides to break the marriage and proposes to Godavari to accept his love. Though Yeman's mother opposes the marriage, Yeman says that he would be happy marrying the girl who is in love with him rather than the girl who has no interest in him, and clarifying that Soumiya is still a small girl.\nFinally, Godavari accepts the love, and she marries Yeman. Soumya whispers complaints about Harish to Yeman. Yemen then forces Harish to tell him that he has not been telling about him for a long time. Harish replies that he would be telling it on an auspicious day.

Just before his death, Hannaford was trying to revive his waning career by making a flashy film, laden with gratuitous sex scenes and violence, with mixed results. At the time of Hannaford's party, this film (titled The Other Side of the Wind) has been left unfinished after its star stormed off the set, for reasons not immediately apparent to the audience.\nA screening of some incomprehensible parts of Hannaford's unfinished experimental film takes place, in order to attract \"end money\" from studio boss Max David. Hannaford himself is absent, and a loyal member of his entourage, the former child star Billy Boyle, makes an inept attempt to describe what the film is about. Intercut during this, we see various groups setting out for Hannaford's seventieth birthday party at an Arizona ranch. Hannaford arrives with a young Brooks Otterlake, a commercially successful director with a talent for mimicking celebrities, who credits much of his success to his close study of Hannaford.\nMany journalists attending the party brandish cameras, and shoot out invasive questions, eventually querying Hannaford's sexuality and whether he has long been a closeted homosexual, in spite of his macho public persona. Hannaford has a history of seducing the wife or girlfriend of each of his leading men, but maintains a strong attraction to the leading men themselves.\nSeveral party guests comment on the conspicuous absence of John Dale, Hannaford's leading man in his latest film, whom Hannaford first discovered when Dale was attempting suicide by jumping into the Pacific Ocean off the Mexican coast. As the party proceeds, Hannaford finds out that Dale's suicide attempt had been faked, and that he had actually set off to Mexico to find Hannaford. Meanwhile, guests are shown more scenes from the film at the ranch's private cinema. One scene makes it clear why Dale left the film\u2014he stormed off the set in anger, in the middle of a sex scene in which he was being goaded by Hannaford off-screen.\nAs the party continues, Hannaford gets progressively drunker. He is washing his face in the bathroom when he breaks down in front of Otterlake, asking for the young director's help to revive his career. A series of power outages in the middle of Hannaford's party interrupts the screening. The party continues by lantern-light, and eventually reconvenes to an empty drive-in cinema, where the last portion of Hannaford's film is screened.\nHaving realized at the party that Otterlake is not going to financially support Hannaford's new film, the two have a mournful last exchange in the drive-in theatre, realising that their friendship is at an end. Intrusive journalist Juliette Rich has asked Hannaford the most explicit questions of all about his sexuality. At this moment, Hannaford slaps Rich in drunken outrage, while a drunken Billy Boyle mounts an impassioned defense of the director. As dawn breaks at the ranch, Dale is walking around the mostly empty house, having only just arrived the morning after. He finally arrives at the drive-in just as a drunken Hannaford is leaving and asks him to get in the sports car with him, but Dale does not. Hannaford drives away, leading to his fatal car accident.\nMeanwhile, Hannaford's symbolic film finishes screening to a now-almost-empty drive-in theatre. The only person still watching is the actress who starred in it. She watches the final scene, and drives off as Hannaford's closing narration says:\n\n\"Who knows?

A sock and a jar of moisturizing cream were found at the scene.\nThe manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old knick-knacks.

When she comes to, she talks about the marble, and how she does not remember where it came from. She was an orphan, and has always had it.\nHer co-investigator and supervisor suggest that this looks like \"The .38 Caliber Killer\", who killed young women, but had not struck in many years. The murderer always exchanged knick-knacks with his victims. While doing a more detailed search of the area, Mike finds a gun in a case, and a red scarf she had been having dreams about. The gun, a .38 revolver, is traced to the observatory manager, who admits he found it, and tried to dispose of it so he would not be a suspect. Working out from where the gun originally lay, Mike concludes that Jennifer had shot herself. The investigators agree.\nIn photos of the crime scene, Mike realizes that there are no photos of the jar of moisturizing cream that she noted.

As they argue, they find the chasqui of the Inca, who appeared very ill and tired.

Nate and Mako explain that the Jaeger program is threatened by the Shao Corporation's new drone program, which offers to mass-produce Jaeger drones developed by Liwen Shao and Dr. Newton 'Newt' Geiszler. Mako is due to deliver a final assessment to determine the approval of the drones at a PPDC council meeting in Sydney, but is accidentally killed by a rogue Jaeger, Obsidian Fury, during an altercation with the latter and Gipsy Avenger, Jake and Nate's Jaeger, before she can. Her death prompts the PPDC council to authorize and deploy the drones immediately. Obsidian Fury escapes into the ocean before backup Jaegers can apprehend it.\nMoments before her death, Mako had transmitted the location of a defunct Jaeger production facility in Siberia. Jake and Nate travel there in Gipsy Avenger, but Obsidian Fury destroys the complex and engages them in battle. Although Obsidian Fury initially has the upper hand, Gipsy Avenger is able to overpower the Jaeger. Upon removing its reactor, they find that Obsidian Fury was controlled not by humans, but by a Kaiju's secondary brain, which testing shows was grown on Earth.\nWhen the drones reach their respective locations, their piloting operations are hijacked by cloned Kaiju brains secretly mounted onboard. The Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids simultaneously attack all Shatterdomes, inflicting heavy casualties and incapacitating almost all Jaegers. Newt and Dr. Hermann Gottlieb try to disable the drones, but the latter discovers that the former is behind the attack when he commands the Kaiju-Jaeger hybrids to open multiple breaches across the Pacific Rim. Newt's mind has been possessed by the Precursors\u2014who forged a link when he and Hermann drifted with Kaiju brains\u2014and reveals that he placed the brains in the drones to ensure the Precursors' plan would proceed. \nAlthough Liwen is able to destroy the drones, closing the breaches, three creatures, Hakuja, Shrikethorn, and Raijin had already emerged and reached Tokyo. The team realizes that the Precursors' true goal is to detonate Mount Fuji with the Kaijus' blood which will cause every volcano lining the Ring of Fire to erupt, releasing volcanic matter into the atmosphere and wiping out all life on Earth, simultaneously terraforming the planet for Precursor colonization.\nThe cadets are mobilized while Hermann and Liwen repair the PPDC's four salvageable Jaegers; Hermann develops Kaiju-blood-powered rockets, which launch the team to Tokyo. Although the Jaegers, including Gipsy Avenger, initially repel the three Kaiju, Newt merges them into a \"Mega-Kaiju\" using robotic parasites from one of Liwen's factories. Three of the four Jaegers are destroyed, leaving Gipsy Avenger as the only one remaining. Jake and Amara, replacing the injured Nate, pilot it against the Mega-Kaiju, with Liwen remote piloting Scrapper and aiding them by locating a rocket and welding it to Gipsy, which sends the Jaeger (with Scrapper holding on) into the atmosphere and free-falling back to Earth, colliding into the Mega-Kaiju and killing it at the last second; Jake and Amara survive by transferring to Scrapper.

To her surprise, he tracks her down and the two have a few more trysts before he informs her that he is returning home.\nWalking home at night after another night out, Liusaidh passes the bridge where Alistair committed suicide.

First a young woman Sania (Hania Amir) is sitting by the mountainsides of outer Islamabad in Pakistan. While enjoying several cups of tea, she looks up at the sky and stares in awe of a PAF (Pakistan Air Force) jet flying overby. In the next scene 3 enemy Mirage-2000's \"from the Eastern sector\" have infiltrated Pakistani airspace and 2 PAF JF-17's, piloted by Hamza Haider Ali (Hamza Ali Abbasi) and Nadir Kirmani (Shaz Khan) are scrambled to intercept them. After an intense aerial dogfight, Hamza shoots down one Mirage-2000 with a missile and tries to shoot down the second one with guns which end up jamming. Instead of following orders to retreat from the scene, he stays in the confrontation despite his weapons not functioning and provides cover for his wingman and best friend Nadir to shoot down the second jet with a missile. The third intruder retreats from the battle and Hamza and Nadir return home victorious. Hamza is however reprimanded by his commanding officer for taking such a dangerous risk during the battle with malfunctioning weapons but Hamza mentions how we was mirroring Squadron Leader Sarfaraz Ahmed Rafique's similar circumstances during the 1965 India-Pakistan war which led to his martyrdom.\nA group of young hopefuls who all want to become PAF Fighter Pilots are then shown travelling towards the PAF academy. These hopefuls include the bold but arrogant Saad Khan (Ahad Raza Mir), shy and hardworking Rashid Minhas Yousufzai (Sikander Vincent Khan Yousafzai), goofy Zaid Ali (Shafaat Ali), Shamir Hamid and female cadets Sania and Ujala. Sania is questioned by the selection committee (who are very hesitant to select her because of her barely meeting the physical height requirements despite her superior academics) as to why she wants to become a PAF fighter pilot despite having grown up in the United States since the age of 10 and having a foreign passport and education. She replies with the fact of her undying love for her home country and wanting to serve in the armed forces. All the candidates are then approved and selected for the GD fighter pilot training selection program. The new PAF trainees then undergo a tough physical and mental training routine by their superiors, often with hilarious outcomes. Over the course of the training Saad makes fun of Sania and the other female cadets and ridicules the fact of females trying to become fighter pilots, much to Sania's annoyance.\nThe film then shifts to Hamza preparing Nadir for his wedding to Fiza, who happens to be Sania's cousin. At the wedding Hamza meets Sania for the first time and is instantly smitten by her. He tries to court her and after some playful back and forth they soon start seeing each other and fall in love. Going on motorcycle trips and having several cups of tea by the mountainside becomes a regular activity for them. Hamza explains to Sania how he loves being a fighter pilot for Pakistan just like his dad was and Sania teases him to whether he would choose her or continue being a fighter pilot if he had to make a choice between the two. He gets hurt and offended even though she was only joking as he explains how he holds both things dear. She accepts this fact and becomes fully supportive of his career. After a rise in terrorist attacks by Taliban militants in the urban areas of Pakistan, the Pakistani Forces resolve to fight and rid the country of these militants once and for all, and Hamza and Nadir are chosen to fly on several bombing missions against them. Fiza who is now pregnant is worried for Nadir's safety, who reassures her that he will be fine. Sania is also worried for Hamza who reassures her that he will either return successful or as a \"shaheed\" (martyr) in which case he will live forever in the spiritual sense. When Sania's mother finds out about her relationship with Hamza, she is angered and forbids her to marry him on the grounds that Sania's father was a pilot as well who had died in a plane crash when Sania was a child and left Sania's mother as a young widow. She doesn't want Sania to go through the same thing and is very dismissive of Hamza when she meets him. However Hamza impresses Sania's mother with his patriotism and loyalty to making the citizens of Pakistan safe and his genuine love for Sania, after which she blesses their union. Hamza and Nadir then lead a formation of F-16's and carry out a successful strike against several senior Taliban militant leaders, some of whom were directly involved with the APS school massacre. Hamza takes out their compound with bombs while Nadir takes out a convoy using AGM's (Air to Ground Missiles).\nBack at the PAF academy, Saad performs well in flight training, but his weaknesses are exposed as a group leader when he is made leader of the cadets during a training expedition on the snowy slopes of Pakistan. Sania and Rashid then excel him in all other training courses and exercises after which he gets increasingly jealous of them both, especially after the other cadets make fun of him and when he starts to see Sania becoming good friends with Rashid. Zaid fails his flying course and decides to no longer continue. He then decides to leave the Airforce. When he nearly goes out off the door his friends, Saad and Rashid cry and then Zaid also becomes emotional. The scene then jumps to Sania coming close to failing as she has trouble with close formation flying. She gets very depressed, stating that she will be crushed if she does not become a fighter pilot. Even though Saad still continues to makes fun of her and the female cadets for joining the PAF, he affectionately gives her advice and tips on how to do well in close formation flying. Sania then passes and is elated but becomes even more elated when she learns that Rashid is being considered for the PAF's highest award for the cadets, the Sword of Honor. Saad becomes enraged at Rashid's success and Sania's happiness for him and lashes out verbally at Rashid after which Sania tells him off in front of everybody, humiliating him.\nThe scene then jumps to Hamza's parents informing him that they have gotten him engaged to a daughter of his father's close friend, after which he angrily informs them of marriage plans and love for Sania. While his mother is understanding, his father angrily refuses this union on the grounds that he has already promised his friend this marriage proposal and makes Hamza choose between Sania and his wishes. After Hamza chooses Sania, his father disowns him and refuses to speak with him ever again leaving Hamza very saddened. Later a convoy of Pakistani soldiers comes under attack by Taliban militants and gun mounted vehicles during a patrol, and Hamza and Nadir are scrambled to aid the soldiers under attack. Because the attack is happening near heavy civilian areas, Hamza deduces a plan to carry out a dangerous low altitude strike instead of dropping bombs from high a high altitude in order to minimize casualties, thus exposing himself to much anti-aircraft fire. Hamza and Nadir successfully destroy all the Taliban attackers and vehicles, however one militant is able to fire a MANPAD surface to air missile at Hamza's F-16 which sustains heavy damage forcing him to eject. Because of the low altitude, Hamza's parachute doesn't deploy properly and Hamza is critically injured but still continues to fight off militants with his pistol. An army helicopter is able to rescue him and kill the remaining militants and carry Hamza to a hospital but unfortunately his injuries are too severe and he instructs the staff to call Sania for him. After he tells her what happened she is devastated and heart broken but he tells her that since he will be a shaheed he will live forever in spirit and will always be with Sania in whatever she does in her life and that he loves her. He then succumbs to his injuries and embraces martyrdom.\nHamza's father is dismissive of his son's heroics as he believes he purposely chose to carry his mission out with such dangerous tactics because he was a coward and wanted to die instead living and facing the fact that he had shamed his father. But after meeting Sania at his grave she tells him how in that last phone conversation Hamza spoke lovingly about his father and how he wanted to make him proud. Hamza's father then comes to terms with this fact and is remorseful and becomes proud of his martyred son and accepts Sania as a daughter in spirit as well. It is here where it becomes apparent that it wasn't just Sania's patriotism that caused her to become a PAF fighter pilot, but that her whole journey and relationship with Hamza was a big factor as well, and that she wanted to live through him with his dream.\nBack in the present a frustrated Saad is pacing about in the gym when he is confronted by Rashid as to why Saad feels anger to him even though Rashid has no ill-feelings towards Saad. Saad cannot contain his anger anymore and knocks down Rashid challenging him to a fight, but he then sees a photo that drops out of Rashid's notebook. It is a picture of a village girl named Sherbatgul, and Saad finds out that she is Rashid's fianc\u00e9e whom Rashid loves and has every intention of marrying. Saad becomes embarrassed and realizes that he was jealous of Rashid for nothing as he had wrongly feared that Rashid was after Sania. He sincerely apologizes to Rashid and begs for his forgiveness. Rashid then laughs and is amused at the fact that the source of all of Saad's angst and frustration throughout all this time was his hidden love for Sania. During a dinner for the cadets, Rashid teasingly prods to Sania that Saad has something to tell her. Saad begins by apologizing for his behavior and attitude to Sania and when he tries to tell her how he feels about her, Sania becomes embarrassed when she realizes what he is trying to say and tries to act dismissive to him but Saad is left amused and hopeful. At the graduation ceremony all the cadets pass and finally become fighter pilots and Sania receives the award for being the top academic performer, Saad receives the award for best aviator and Rashid as expected receives the Sword of Honor. All the PAF seniors are in attendance along with a promoted and decorated Nadir who is with his wife and his newborn son, who he has named Hamza after his old best friend.\nThe film then concludes with the same scenes from the beginning showing Sania still coming to the mountainside time to time enjoying several cups of tea by herself, remembering her time with Hamza and coming to full peace of having achieved both his and her dreams. A final scene shows Saad and Sania, now flying the JF-17's, exiting their planes after landing. Sania then sees a vision of Hamza's spirit, smiling at her and then saluting her. Sania and Saad then walking side by side and sharing a laugh and smile, hinting at a possible romance between the two in the future.", "tmdb_id": 543005}, "58600844": {"title": "PASKAL: The Movie", "plot": "In 2018, a supertanker, Laurel 11 (based on the real-life Bunga Laurel), was hijacked by Somali pirates at the Gulf of Aden one night. The Royal Malaysian Navy picks up the distress call and KA Bunga Mas Lima, which was bound for home after a long operation at sea, comes to aid. The pirate's refusal to negotiate prompted Commander Maznan to deploy the Navy's elite special operations unit, PASKAL, commanded by Lieutenant Commander Arman Rahmat. Two boats and a Super Lynx helicopter were deployed for the mission. Their swift and stealthy tactics ensured the eventual success of the operation with the pirates subdued and captured.\nThe team returns to Lumut with Arman thinking on whether to retire or not. His mother's apparent distaste with his dangerous job and the painful memory of his past had prompted him to do so. Back in 2009 when he was a sub-lieutenant, Arman had undergone training with a late friend, Joshua Tee Seng Wai (Girang), and Mohd Zariff bin Zafrudin (Jeb). His motivation to join PASKAL was to honour his father's sacrifice. The three of them were among the best in the unit and were selected to undergo advanced training course with the US Navy SEALs. However, during a peacekeeping operation in Angola two years later, Jeb accidentally killed Joshua in a confrontation with a rebel group while transporting a Chinese UN Observer. Wounded, he was dishonourably discharged after he brutally executed a prisoner with a sidearm. Arman told Joshua's wife, Lily about the incident and Joshua was given a military funeral.\nArman continues to take care of Joshua's wife and only son, who had also developed a close bond with his mother. Despite handling his request to retire, Commander Maznan enlists him on a reconnaissance mission in Kota Kinabalu as a \"farewell party\". He and his team are assigned to capture a pirate leader named Rudi Rusli Parjo, who was involved in the hijacking of MT Orkim Harmony. However, the plan was foiled after Arman discovered Jeb at a food court with Rudi. It was learned that Rudi, through his successful raids, has been hiring ex-special forces members to his ranks, and Jeb was recruited as his bodyguard.\nJeb's jealousy over Arman's achievements and the apparent dislike with the Navy's system brings him at odds with Arman since training day and it only got worse when Jeb starts to stalk Lily, warning Arman to stay away. CCTV footage of Jeb's car showing a logo belonging to an oil rig company where Lily works alerted Arman to a possible hijacking plot. He alerts the Navy, who in turn alerted port authorities to lock down the area. The fake security personnel team was captured by authorities, but Jeb and Rudi managed to evade capture. They eventually seized the oil rig, with Lily being one of the hostages.\nArman's team were recalled from leave and transported to the rendezvous point at sea via a RMAF C-130 Hercules before being picked up by the Scorp\u00e8ne-class submarine KD Tunku Abdul Rahman. Two additional teams were deployed as back-up to a forward operating base aboard KD Selangor. After a change of plans, they dived towards the oil rig and secured the top to make way for reinforcements. As they fought past various traps and ambushes, Arman encounters Jeb with Lily bound to C-4 explosives. Jeb threatens to blow up the entire oil rig if Arman does not put his gun down. Arman complies, but Jeb threatens to kill Arman with a knife, challenging him to see who is the better PASKAL. After a fight, Arman managed to subdue Jeb and pushes him off the deck, still grabbed onto Jeb's hand. Refusing to be captured and accept that Arman had won, Jeb says that he's still the best and shoots Arman with his pistol. However, the bullet only scratches Arman's face. Arman was forced to let go and Jeb fell into the sea to his death. Rudi and another pirate attempt to escape by crossing the Filipino waters by boat but was pursued by a Navy vessel. Just before they can cross, they were shot dead. The boat eventually crossed the Filipino waters with their lifeless bodies on board.\nWith all the hostages rescued and brought to shore, Arman's mother, finally understanding her son's sacrifice, acknowledges him and apologises, saying that his father would be proud if he was alive. Arman and his team were awarded honours by the RMN commander. At one point, he laments about not knowing the full names of the members who he served with, in which chief petty officer Misi replies \"How many kingdoms know nothing of us?\", referencing the philosopher Blaise Pascal in his book Pens\u00e9es.

He has been sent by other Christian communities outside the city to meet with Priscilla and Aquila, the leaders of the community hiding out in Rome. Aquila and Priscilla are currently debating whether to stay in Rome and provide hope to fellow Christians or to leave the city with their community and avoid certain death.\nPaul has been imprisoned inside Mamertine Prison for his strong influence as a Christian leader which makes him a threat to Nero's power. Mauritius Gallus, the newly appointed prefect of the prison, accuses Paul of burning half of Rome down and, by Nero's decree, sentences him to death. After meeting with Aquila and Priscilla, Luke sneaks into the prison and joyfully greets a weary, physically beaten Paul. Both men agree that Paul's time on Earth is nearing an end and so Luke convinces him to help write an account of how Paul, formerly known as Saul of Tarsus, came to be one of Christianity's greatest leaders. Although Mauritius discovers that Luke sneaked into the prison aided by high-ranking Romans, he allows him to visit Paul unscathed.\nPaul narrates his origins. As Saul of Tarsus, a Jewish boy, he was influenced by the zealotry of his leaders and witnessed the martyrdom of Stephen at their hands for professing faith in Jesus Christ. This event made Saul vow to destroy all Christians throughout the world until the day he rode for Damascus with his brethren. He became blinded by God and heard His voice asking why Saul persecuted Him. This event along with Saul's meeting Ananias, a disciple of Christ, humbled Saul so deeply that he repented of his actions. Ananias restored Saul's sight and baptized him in the name of the Lord, which led to Saul rejecting his former name and becoming Paul.\nThe Christian community continues to suffer losses, and Cassius, who lost a cousin to the persecution, adamantly calls for Christians to seek revenge against the Romans. Although Luke rebukes Cassius by saying that Paul never sought revenge or wished ill upon those who harmed him, Luke begins to sympathize with the need for retribution after witnessing the Romans' cruelty and barbarity. However, Paul admonishes him for \"giving up on the world when Christ did not\" and tells him that the very love which Christ died for is the only way to counter this evil. Inspired by those words, Luke receives Paul's promise that he will have the grace and strength to endure.\nMauritius laments being made prefect of the prison despite his many deeds for Rome and the fact that his daughter is dying from a terrible sickness even with all his sacrifices to the Roman gods. Having heard of Paul's reputation as a preacher and miracle worker, he speaks with Paul and relays his concerns about his sickly daughter. Paul suggests that Luke be allowed to examine her and help, but Mauritius refuses to allow a Christian in his home against the protests of his wife who grows impatient with Mauritius' hubris. Further, Mauritius has Luke imprisoned believing that he and Paul are plotting an escape from the prison to lead an uprising against Rome despite Paul's assurances to the contrary.\nHaving lost all patience with Priscilla and Aquila's pacifism, Cassius takes matters into his hands by bringing an armed group of men to storm the prison and free Paul. However, Paul rejects their rescue attempt by saying that Christ has already won the victory upon the cross. Dejected, Cassius and the others escape before more guards arrive and disappear into the night. Mauritius angrily accuses Paul and Luke of the conspiracy to escape despite their protests and has Luke imprisoned with other Christians. After being sentenced to Nero's circus to be devoured by wild beasts, Luke leads the other prisoners in prayer asking the Lord to forgive their captors for their impending execution.\nFearing the loss of his daughter, Mauritius finally relents and has Luke brought to his house to save her. Luke sends Mauritius to Aquila and Priscilla for supplies needed to heal the child. Amazed that Luke would entrust the lives of other Christians to him, Mauritius goes alone to their hiding place and begs for their assistance. Although initially wary of a Roman prefect asking for help, they ultimately give Mauritius the requested supplies. With the items delivered, Luke uses his healing skills as a physician to cure the prefect's daughter of her illness while  the imprisoned Christians are thrown into the circus.\nWith his daughter finally healthy again, Mauritius graciously spares Luke's life and thanks Paul for his continued kindness and compassion. Although Mauritius regrets the deaths of the Christians in the arena, Paul is hopeful that Mauritius may yet come to know Jesus Christ. Paul and Luke express their belief that all the world shall know the Christians by their love and that they will meet again. Aquila and Priscilla, having decided at last to leave Rome with their community, agree to deliver Luke's completed writings to Timothy and thus ensure that the Acts of the Apostles will be told and retold across the world.\nLuke remains in Rome to continue evangelizing in the name of Christianity. As the Christians escape into the countryside, Paul is escorted outside the prison to be executed by decapitation with Luke watching it unfold. Mauritius shakes Paul's hand in a final gesture of goodwill and respect.

His wife sleeps across the room unaware. He has an overwhelming desire to stab his daughter with the ice pick, but is able to push the urge down in the moment. Later, while calming the baby, she looks up at him and says, \"You know what you have to do, right?\". He then decides that he must enact his murderous impulses upon a prostitute, so as to protect his daughter from himself. He has convinced his wife that he is going on a business trip. However, he actually intends to rent a hotel room, hire the services of a sex worker, and go through with his meticulous plot of killing the person with an ice pick, while getting away with the crime.\nThe title credits open as Reed makes his way to a hotel at the beginning of the night. Once he enters the room, he begins a rehearsal of his plans. He continually wipes fingerprints and times himself in a notebook after forcing unconsciousness by chloroform. However, when the appointed time arrives, Jackie (Mia Wasikowska) has arrived instead of his intended victim. She brings with her a collection of kinky fetish gear and  a sadistic impulse. After a bad first encounter, she hides in the bathroom, and Reed nervously awaits. He grows impatient and enters the bathroom after Jackie ignores his calls. Upon entry he sees her repeatedly stabbing herself with a pair of scissors in the leg. He overpowers her and carries her to the bed where she passes out, most likely due to the pills she is seen swallowing earlier. He quickly bandages her and ditches his plans to murder, he grabs his belongings and attempts to leave the hotel, but returns after seeing Jackie leaving the room undressed and bleeding.\nReed decides to dress and transport Jackie to the hospital, but on the taxi ride there, Jackie whispers that she \"was onto him\", suggesting she knew of his plans to kill her. She asks him to wait for her at the hospital, and he promises he will. While waiting, Reed imagines his wife giving him advice and being a voice of reason, suggesting either Jackie does not know what his true intentions are, and he still may be able to kill her, or that she played coy and is alerting the hospital staff and will get Reed imprisoned. He reasons that she does not know and she returns excited to see him still there.\nAfter establishing that trust, they go to Jackie's apartment. Jackie cordially offers dinner, but Reed is quiet and appears disinterested. Jackie attempts seduction which ultimately leads to them lying in her bed. They continually speak in double meaning, either conveying ideas of sex or murder, yet neither knows which intention the other has. Reed resolves that she wants him to kill her, and he gets up to grab his gear from across the room. Yet Jackie is confused, thinking he wanted sex. As he moves towards her, she again suggests dinner. They eat, and Reed begins to suffer from violent and nightmarish hallucinations of people he's killed, notably his domineering mother who tortures him with a lit cigarette. Jackie explains she spiked his soup with narcotics and he falls into a state of unconsciousness. He moans his wife's name and this infuriates Jackie, leading to her beating him with a can opener. Towards the end, Reed gets the upper hand and Jackie still does not believe he is a killer. She allows him to tie her up, thinking he will finally have sex with her. Yet he pulls out an ice pick and right as he attempts to stab her, he passes out once more. Jackie unties herself and looks through his bags, she finds his notebook and reads the sadistic plans he had intended for her.\nWhen Reed awakes the following morning, he finds himself bound and gagged. Jackie sits at her mirror, and pierces her nipple. Then she climbs on top of him, readying the ice pick. As she raises it, he wails, and she hesitates. She ungags him and they stare at each other.

Pinky slowly gets a hold on her new life; she learns to serve her masters and she befriends Grace, the Filipino cook and the Indian driver Santosh. Her employers are among the high society of Dubai: the husband, Hassan Chughtai is a banker, and the wife, Mehr, is a socialite who directs the help in managing the home and her 10-year-old son.\nLife as a maid is not as easy as she had hoped. Her employers had wanted a quiet Pakistani girl who would speak Urdu and cook Pakistani food and massage her mistress\u2019 head with oil in the Pakistani way; these are easy for Pinky. The difficulties are around money; Pinky often requires salary advances to send home to her family. Her income pays for food and clothing and in building a new house with a proper roof. One evening Pinky ventures into downtown Dubai and becomes lost on the streets. Mehr and Santosh are worried and Pinky's cell phone is dead.

The home is run by the help, Mehr has little to do and the routine of massages and shopping and parties quickly becomes dull. Some socialite wives start boutiques: clothes, yoga, jewelry. The stuff is bought, cheap, from Asia and marketed as unique and exotic. It does not sell, the boutique is liquidated at a loss and the husband will not fund another experiment. Pinky's employer purported to be a writer. A publisher friend of her husband published her first book which did okay. This publisher received her second manuscript warmly. In the course of editing the book he told her, gently, that the first book was a kind of favor to the husband and that she was not really a writer and ought to try something else. It was a shock to be told this when Mehr, after all the years in boutiques and having and rearing the child, had approached middle age.

Hassan retreats from the party and admits to Pinky that he still loves his wife. Mehr spots them and fearfully concludes there is an affair. She throws a loud public tantrum accusing her husband and the ungrateful Pinky. The party is over. The couple continues fighting in their room. It is the same script: Hassan is exhausted from his job and travel. Mehr resents being called a trophy and accuses him of neglect and adultery and, to fuel the fire, discloses that their child has developed behavioral problems at school. The argument escalates and Hassan pushes Mehr; she hits her head; he leaves home for the night. Mehr takes the child and moves to a friend's house.

Throughout his time in Norfolk, he repeatedly attempts to dispose of the puppet, but it inexplicably returns to him each time. He recovers a picture book about Possum that he wrote and illustrated as a young boy depicting Possum's origins and how it creeps upon unsuspecting, orphaned children, intent on devouring them in their beds. \nPhillip frequently approaches a closed room in the house. Each time, Maurice asks if he plans to go in, to which he always replies no. Maurice frequently mocks Phillip during their interactions, such as mentioning the disgraceful circumstances that cost him his job and sadistically requesting that Phillip recount traumatic experiences of childhood bullying. He laments Phillip's attempts to dispose of Possum, reminding him that puppetry is something that runs in their family.\nNews reports begin to surface of a missing local boy, Michael, whom Phillip initially encountered on the train ride to Norfolk. Authorities indicate that a man fitting Phillip's description is a person of interest in the disappearance. He revisits his childhood school, though he is discouraged from lingering by the school's staff and treated with suspicion by the local residents. He is also plagued by strange visions and dreams of Possum creeping up on him in bed.

He tells the secretary that Mr. Grant \"knew all about what had happened\" and promised to go to the police with him. The confused secretary has him wait outside, but Phillip overhears her speaking with the principal about calling the police and he flees.

He lewdly taunts Phillip about the deaths of his parents in the fire, leaving him orphaned and in his care, whereupon he beat and sexually abused him throughout his childhood. He muses about how Phillip always knew Maurice was the masked man who assaulted him back then, but that he still never told anyone. As Maurice overpowers a sobbing and mentally-regressed Phillip by beating and molesting him, Phillip hears a whimper from a locked chest in the corner. He overpowers Maurice and breaks his neck.

Traeger also takes the Predator to a lab for experimentation and observation, recruiting evolutionary biologist Casey Bracket to study it, who discovers that the Predator's genetic makeup contains human DNA.

The interrogations are interrupted by renowned artist Yuen Man (Zhang Jingchu) attempting to bail Lee. An agreement is reached where Lee will be released into witness protection for revealing Painter's identity and criminal history, so Lee begins recounting his past.\nIn the 1990s, Lee and Yuen were lovers living together in Vancouver, struggling to sell their artwork. Yuen's artistic talent was eventually recognized, but Lee's artwork was criticized for only imitating the styles of great masters. Lee realized his skills and reluctantly became a forger to make a living.\nLee's work was eventually noticed by Painter (Chow Yun-fat), who invites Lee to join his team. Lee agreed to leave Canada with the goal of returning and winning over Yuen. Lee successfully worked with the team to overcome the security features of the new 1996 US 100-dollar bill, but became disturbed by Painter's increasingly violent actions, especially after an armored car robbery for paint where Painter kills all the guards out of rage when one ambushes him.\nWith their counterfeit stock, Painter's team traveled to Thailand to re-negotiate their contract with a warlord known as \"the General.\" Painter revealed that he was actually here for revenge, knowing that the General was responsible for the death of Painter's father, and an attack was launched. During the destruction of the compound, Lee rescued Sau-ching, the General's own counterfeit expert. Sau-ching joined Painter's team after recovering from her injuries, and Painter gave her a fake passport with the name \"Yuen Man.\" At this time, Lee learned that Yuen had become a successful artist, but also that she was engaged to her agent.\nPainter discovered that their next counterfeit buyer was an undercover from the Canadian police. Painter ordered Lee to kill him during the deal, but Lee hesitated and Painter was forced to kill the buyer in the ensuing struggle. Frustrated with Lee's cowardice, Painter revealed a captured and blindfolded Yuen with her agent in the next room. Painter insisted if Lee really wants Yuen back in his life, he should prove it by killing her fianc\u00e9. When Lee refused, Painter shot the agent himself, causing Lee to turn on him. Almost everybody was killed in the gunfight that follows, with the Painter nowhere to be found afterwards. Lee and Sau-ching escaped to Lee's new home in Thailand, knowing the Painter would definitely seek retribution. Lee was eventually arrested by the Thai police for counterfeiting, and would notice Painter in a crowd, realizing he was set up for the crimes.\nIn the present day, Lee and Yuen are escorted to a hotel. Inspector Ho notices a policeman matching Lee's drawn depiction of Painter. He is captured and interrogated, but the confused policeman insists he is a legitimate officer who drove Lee Man to the police headquarters. At this point, the authorities realize they were deceived all along.\nIt is revealed that while Lee's recount is mostly accurate, the \"Painter\" character is none other than Lee himself. The real Yuen Man is currently in China, while the Yuen Man in Hong Kong is actually Sau-ching, who received cosmetic surgery to look like Yuen following the burns she received. Sau-ching had feelings for Lee, but Lee was only using her as a replica for Yuen Man. Sau-ching would later kill Yuen Man's fianc\u00e9 and report him to Thai authorities. While in prison, Lee wrote to Sau-ching for forgiveness and assistance to escape. Lee and Sau-ching kill their guards and escape Hong Kong by boat.\nThe next day, Sau-ching reveals to Lee that she has been deliberately sailing in circles and they are still in Hong Kong. As the police surround them, she declares she is tired of living as Yuen Man's replacement, and detonates a cache of explosives on the boat.\nInspector Ho visits Yuen Man in China to inform her of Painter's death, but Yuen indifferently says it will not bring back her fianc\u00e9. Asked if she recognizes Lee's photograph, Yuen states that he was a neighbor; it seems Lee's relationship with Yuen was also fabricated, and his obsession with her was no more than the unrequited love of a stranger.", "tmdb_id": 531384}, "58544317": {"title": "Prospect (film)", "plot": "A teenage girl, Cee, and her father, Damon, descend in a landing pod from a transport spaceship to the surface of a forest moon covered in poisonous spores to mine for gems.

As they are getting ready to leave, Regan secretly gives him back the toy, but without its batteries. When they leave, Beau takes back the batteries without anyone noticing.

In a flashback scene, it is revealed that Rana Singha is Shamsher's business rival, who creates problems for Shamsher's family and his business. As Sanjana and Sooraj, Shamsher's children, reach 25 years old, their family lawyer explains their deceased mother's will. As per the will, the twins are entitled to 50% of the property and 50% of the shares as joint partners (25% each), and the remaining 50% for Sikander. This disparity causes the twins to hate Sikander even more as Shamsher preferred Sikander more than the twins. Shamsher tells both of them that Sikander is the son of Shamsher's elder brother, Ranchor Singh, who was actually CEO of Al-Shifa.\nIn a flashback, that portrays the Handia village of the 1970s, the history of the Singh family is depicted. Both the Singh brothers used to supply weapons to Indian army. Local politicians of Handia asked them for illegal weapons, to which Ranchor refused. His refusal caused a rivalry with a local politician, Gajendra Pathak. One day, during an ambush on an arms truck which was owned by Ranchor's company, Vijendra's son Narendra was killed by Ranchor. Then Ranchor died when his car was blown-up by a bomb. The arms company owned by the Singh family was then declared to be an anti-state organization and accused of supplying weapons to terrorists.

Shamsher tells of Sikander's death to the politicians, in the presence of the twins. He then plugs the hard disk and is shocked to find out that the disk was not the original one. Rather, it only contained a video, self-filmed by Sumitra before her death, in which she reveals the truth that Ranchor was killed by Shamsher, and the twins were Ranchor's kids.

Walt brings Bessie into his world of subversive political thought and counter-culture, at one point directing her to Ms. Wiley, who leads the Consumer's League of New Jersey.\nJo eventually falls ill, and Bessie seeks out help. When Mr. Roeder, the foreman, sends along the company doctor, Dr. Flint, the latter finds no problem with Jo. After the sisters ask for him to run more tests, he returns with a diagnosis of syphilis, which was the same diagnosis given to the eldest Cavallo sister, Mary, before she died two years prior.\nThe Cavallo sisters refuse to accept this diagnosis, especially as Jo is a virgin. They seek help from Wiley, who is willing to go against American Radium, but she warns them that the process won't be easy. Bessie tries to warn the other girls at the factory of the dangers and urges them to get tested for radium poisoning, but most are reluctant to quit or get tested. Once Mary's body is exhumed and tested, her bones are found to be radioactive, strengthening the case against American Radium. Eventually two more girls join the Cavallo sisters, but American Radium responds to this momentum by trying to coerce the Cavallo sisters into silence, and then intimidating them by following them around when they walk alone.\nEventually, Mr. Henry Berry agrees to represent the case of the dial painters. The trial proceeds and seems to be going well, but Bessie knows she needs stronger support for her side, so she seeks out Mr. Leech, the branch supervisor, who also had a secret relationship with Mary before her death. Bessie eventually finds Leech in the hospital, suffering of radium poisoning. After much convincing, Leech agrees to testify on behalf of the dial painters, because of the love he held for Mary. Yet, when he is called to the stand, he lies, saying he never had a relationship with Mary, and that he had never warned her of the dangers of radium. When Bessie asks him why he changed his testimony, he says that his sister died of cancer, and while he wasn't able to help or cure her, at least American Radium would provide for her children and grandchildren, so he had to help it survive.\nAfter the state trial judge grants American Radium a long extension on the negotiations, a federal judge who had taken an interest in the case negotiates a deal on behalf of the victims (by now dubbed the \"Radium Girls\").

Bessie is reluctant to accept this deal, because she wants the impacts of the case to be further reaching - but, as Wiley says, \"It is never over.\" All the girls end up signing the settlement.\nThe epilogue states that radium was used to paint luminous clocks until the 1970s, that the judge who had negotiated the settlement was a stockholder in American Radium, that the Radium Girls case impacted labor law in the United States, and that if you place a Geiger counter over the grave of a Radium Girl, it will click for more than a thousand years.", "tmdb_id": 461115}, "56898624": {"title": "Raduaa", "plot": "It is a comedy science fiction movie where four people who are living in 2018 travel back in time to 1955.

Foster specializes in synthetic biology and mapping of the mind's neural pathways, while Whittle's specialty is reproductive human cloning. Foster successfully captures the soldier's neural map and transfers it into the android's synthetic brain, but the experiment fails when the soldier recoils in horror at the android body and destroys it, killing himself again. Foster's boss Jones warns him that if he cannot get Subject 345 to work, the company's shareholders will shut the project down.\nFoster takes his wife Mona and three children Sophie, Matt, and Zoe, on a boating trip, but on the way all except William are killed in a car crash. Determined to resurrect his family, he coaxes Ed to bring him the Bionyne equipment necessary to extract his family's neural maps and to clone replacement bodies for them. He successfully extracts their neural maps and tells Whittle to dispose of the bodies, but the first major obstacle to his plan presents itself: only three cloning pods are available, forcing him to choose one to sacrifice. He chooses Zoe, the youngest, and erases her memory from the neural maps of the other three. Whittle starts the seventeen-day cycle required to create mature replacement clones for Foster's family, and tells him he has only that long to solve the problem of integrating the neural maps into the cloned bodies, or else they will start to deteriorate by aging at an abnormally fast rate. Integrating the mind into a biological clone was phase two of the research project, to be solved after android transfer. Foster is forced to keep this secret, since he and Whittle have stolen millions of dollars of Bionyne equipment and are breaking bioethics. He spends the seventeen days removing evidence of Zoe's existence from his home, and creating cover stories of illness to explain his family's absence from work, school, and social media contact.\nWhen Foster notices his wife's central nervous system reacting to his touch, he realizes that Subject 345 failed because the mind expects connection to a biological body with heartbeat and respiration, rather than a synthetic one. He knows now that transfer into the clones will not be a problem, and the failure of android transfer can be solved by programming a simulated mind-body interface to make the android body appear biological. He successfully transfers the minds of his loved ones into the cloned bodies, then goes back to work creating a synthetic mind-body interface. When the next dead body he receives has suffered too much brain damage to be viable, Foster resorts to recording his own mind for the android transfer. Meanwhile, Sophie has a nightmare of her mother's death, and Mona catches Foster erasing her memory of the event. He confesses that they died in a car crash and that he resurrected them. The family soon discovers evidence of Zoe's existence that he missed, and he admits that he couldn't save Zoe and erased their memories of her.\nJones confronts Foster and reveals that he is aware of what Foster and Whittle have done. He tells him the research is not actually intended for medical purposes, but is being financed by the U.S. government to provide a military weapon, and that Foster's family are loose ends to be eliminated. Foster destroys the mind-body interface, incapacitates Jones, and flees, attempting to escape by boat. Jones' henchmen capture Foster's family. He pursues them to Bionyne, where it is clear that Whittle has sold them out. Jones kills Whittle and forces Foster to finish Subject 345. Foster uploads his own mind into Subject 345, who kills the henchmen and mortally wounds Jones.

Sawyer escapes while the trailer burns, and Lowell struggles to overpower Hollister.  O'Doyle arrives and kills both cousins, then picks up Sawyer.

The townspeople have yet to find any clues about his disappearance. Bobby and the gang proceed to the best part of the inn, a very high-tech cooking arena. They meet Giada De Laurentiis and her cat Bella, and Marcus Samuelsson and his wife Maya Haile.\nThe inn's groundskeeper Jeremiah Noseworthy shows up, and quickly leaves mentioning a red ghost. Bobby elaborates that when Edward disappeared back in 1780, he was alone in the inn and people heard him cry out Red Ghost before he disappeared. The inn has been vacant because of the ghost, but since they reopened it, people claimed to have seen it. The next day on television, Gail announces the big show at the inn and has an interview with Jeremiah, who blurts out that Edward was a traitor. Nacho sees Skip telling him that he is leaving out of stress about the Red Ghost, but Skip changes his mind and goes back to lie down. A businessman named Bradley Bass comes in and tells Bobby that he is sitting on a gold mine, but Bobby refuses to sell. Daphne runs up to Bobby telling him something is happening in the arena.\nHenry Metcalf, who wrote a famous book on the inn, shows up. He gives Bobby a folder of papers and continues by saying during the Revolutionary War, Edward welcomed soldiers to his inn and wrapped the dishes up in these papers for take-out. That night at the show, suddenly the animatronics begin to go haywire. It is soon discovered that this was caused by the Red Ghost, which drives the spectators away. The ghost tries to chase the gang, but Velma uses a fire extinguisher and the ghost disappears.\nLater that evening, the gang notices that the parchment has words on it written in invisible ink, concluding that the personal papers were the parchments the whole time. One of them contains detailed information about troop movements, and the gang starts to think that Jeremiah was right about Edward being a spy. Scooby spots the Red Ghost stealing the rest of the papers, but is too scared to warn everyone else. While running through the lobby, the ghost trips on a carpet dropping all the papers and starts picking them up. The gang begins to follow the ghost's footprints once Scooby regains his bravery and alerts them as to what happened.

The ghost is revealed to be Bradley Bass who was using his smartphone to control the drone. He wanted to buy the inn cheap without damaging the reputation of Edward. Bradley, however, is revealed to be Henry Metcalf in disguise. He spent his entire career around the story of Edward as a hero, but he stumbled upon the truth and did not want it to get out. He believed that the legend that was hidden in the inn was a set of personal papers written by Edward that would incriminate him. However, what Metcalf did not know was that the personal papers were in fact the parchment sheets he gave to Bobby until he overheard them in the kitchen. Velma then reveals that Edward wasn't working for the British, but was working for George Washington and is revealed that he was never a spy, but he was indeed a patriot and a hero.\nIn the end of the film, Jeremiah is still moving and Velma wonders why.

He and Juliet disguise themselves as a squirrel to get the clue from a dog, and manage to evade the dog on a lawnmower.\nGnomeo attempts to free the gnomes, but only he and the Red Goon Gnomes are able to escape before the gargoyles arrive.

Irene gives Juliet the clue, which leads her and Sherlock to Traitor's Gate at the Tower of London. They discover Watson, apparently the true mastermind, who reveals that he pretended to be Moriarty to get through to Sherlock, who never showed respect or appreciation for him, and supposedly has the gnomes in custody, only to find them all missing. The Gargoyles reveal that they never worked for Watson, and dispose of Juliet, Sherlock and Watson on a ship.\nSherlock realizes the gnomes are being held at the bottom of the Tower Bridge with pie filling, and Moriarty appears, revealing that he really was behind everything (having manipulated Watson into helping him) and plans to smash the gnomes with the raised bridge. After witnessing Sherlock's mistreatment of Watson, he had the Gargoyles feign allegiance with Watson to access his map and identify the location of every gnome in London. Sherlock and Watson agree to work together a final time to save the gnomes, and they and Juliet head to the bridge on a drone.\nGnomeo manages to stall the bridge opening with the Red Goon Gnomes dancing, reunites with Juliet and together they defeat the Gargoyles. Although Watson frees the trapped gnomes with soap, Moriarty pursues Sherlock and injures his leg. However, just before he can kill the others, Sherlock throws himself at Moriarty, knocking them both over the bridge. Watson narrowly saves Sherlock with his cane grappling hook, whereupon Moriarty lands in the water and helplessly floats away. Afterward, the gnomes enjoy the fireworks.\nThe following spring, Gnomeo and Juliet happily reveal their completed garden and the gnomes celebrate with Irene and the cat guards in attendance.

Migo is a yeti who abides by the law of the ancient stones held by the Stonekeeper, the yetis' leader. Migo's father, Dorgle, projects himself through the air each morning to hit a gong with his head, as the yetis believe this wakes up the sun. While learning how to ring the gong, Migo is distracted by the Stonekeeper's daughter, Meechee, whom he has a crush on, and misses the gong, landing outside the village. There, Migo witnesses a plane crash and finds a \"smallfoot\" (human), whom the yetis believe is mythical. Migo runs back to inform the villagers, but he lacks proof, and Stonekeeper claims he is lying and banishes him from the village. Migo is suddenly visited by rejected yetis Gwangi, Kolka, and Fleem, who do not believe in the stones, and bring him to the Smallfoot Evidentiary Society (S.E.S.), which is led by Meechee. She convinces Migo to travel below the clouds despite the stones telling them that there is nothing underneath. After some hesitation, Migo agrees to go, but his rope snaps and Migo falls, where he discovers land.\nPercy Patterson is a British human filmmaker of wildlife documentaries who has lost most of his viewership. He meets the pilot who saw Migo, and in an attempt to regain his fame, tries unsuccessfully to convince his assistant, Brenda, to dress up as a yeti for filming. Migo arrives and unknowingly scares Percy when trying to communicate with him due to yeti's and human's inability to understand each other. When Migo inadvertently terrifies Percy by his attempted communication, Percy attempts to tranquilize Migo. However the errant dart ends up hitting Percy, rendering him temporarily unconscious. Migo then decides to abduct the unconscious Percy by stuffing him into a sleeping bag that he straps to his chest for the return trip home.\nDuring the long trek back up the mountain, Migo and Percy encounter a severe blizzard which blows them into a nearby cave. Migo discovers that Percy has frozen completely solid. He quickly lights a fire and ties Percy up over a fire to thaw him out and save his life. As Percy regains consciousness, he believes that Migo is trying to cook him alive. Percy breaks free from the rope and proceeds to film and upload a cell phone video of Migo while narrating that the yeti is threatening to eat him, before attempting to escape. While chasing after Percy, Migo's toe becomes ensnared in a bear trap and Percy takes pity on Migo by removing the trap and bandaging his wound. Realizing that the yeti is trying to communicate with him, Percy agrees to go with Migo and they head back up the mountain overnight, where they reunite with the S.E.S. the next morning.\nThe yetis are confused by Percy's appearance, but happily embrace him and learn about his culture, much to Stonekeeper's dismay. Later, Stonekeeper takes Migo inside the palace and reveals the truth: yetis used to live below the clouds, but were forced into hiding by the vicious humans who mercilessly attacked them. To keep themselves safe, the yetis created the stones, and the clouds are actually steam made by the yetis' daily tasks to keep them hidden from the humans below. Meanwhile, Meechee is able to develop a rudimentary line of communication with Percy by referring to crude chalk drawings that Percy scribbles on her cave wall. In order to protect the yeti village, Migo agrees to continue Stonekeeper's lie by telling the yetis that Percy, who is now experiencing altitude sickness, is just a hairless wild yak. Stonekeeper takes Percy and locks him in an ice box, so Percy will be unable to alert other humans of the yetis' whereabouts. Migo later discovers that Meechee took Percy away to return him home, and jumps down the mountain with Gwangi and Kolka following suit.\nPercy recovers and discovers that his video of Migo has generated significant public excitement, but then notices that Meechee has become distracted by the wonders of Kathmandu and accidentally causes a public disruption.

Ford suspects Noah, whom he threatens to kill if he doesn't admit to the shooting.\nBeckmann hears over the radio that more militia shootings are taking place, inspired by the initial shooting, and attempts to broadcast that their militia has nothing to do with the shooting, to no avail. Keating finally speaks to Gannon, saying he doesn't speak because he prefers to be alone; Gannon reads from Keating's journal, in which he professes a desire to shoot up his school, and Keating neither confirms or denies that he carried out the shooting. Gannon decides that he needs to die in order to give the police a scapegoat, citing an incident where he was forced to kill his partner in order to maintain his cover and give the police a reason to arrest members of the Ku Klux Klan, but before he can shoot himself, Keating admits to the shooting and confesses over the radio. However, the police believe the confession to be false, mentioning that they've received multiple confessions in the last hour.\nFord believes Gannon is protecting Noah, who he feels connected with through their mutual history as police officers, and strings Noah up from a noose in the warehouse. However, the execution is interrupted by the arrival of a squad of police cars. Gannon and Noah both exit the warehouse and surrender to the police, as Gannon tells Ford to tell the police that they both carried out the shooting. The rest of the militia confront the police, armed with rifles and wearing body armor, but as soon as one of them makes a move, the police open fire, killing all of the members except the surrendering Gannon and Noah. Noah then admits that the police faked the shootings to get the militia to distrust each other and give his squad a reason to eliminate the militia. Gannon almost shoots Noah, but relents and gives him his gun, letting him walk away. The police ask Gannon if he wants to rejoin them; the film cuts to black before he decides.", "tmdb_id": 516630}, "46321167": {"title": "A Star Is Born (2018 film)", "plot": "43-year-old Jackson \"Jack\" Maine, a famous country rock singer privately battling an alcohol and drug addiction, plays a concert.

She imagines herself as being older and sophisticated but is surprised at how small and childlike she appears in photos from that time. Jennifer's relationship began one summer when she went to an intensive horse training camp with three other girls. She lived with the beautiful and enigmatic Mrs. G, who also had Jenny and the girls run with professional coach Bill Allens, who was in his 40s.

This prompts Jennifer to remember that she was supposed to participate in group sex with Mrs. G, Bill and Iris one weekend. Jenny, who threw up each time she was raped by Bill, had an anxiety attack and threw up the day before she was due to go away for the weekend, causing her mother to keep her at home. Realizing she no longer wanted to be in a relationship with Bill, Jenny called him and broke up with him, even as he pleaded with her to stay. Unlike Bill, Mrs. G coldly accepted Jenny's decision to remove her horse that weekend. Jenny wrote about her time with Bill in an essay for school (calling it a work of fiction) in which she proclaimed herself a hero, not a victim; this is the essay her mother finds at the beginning of the film.\nJennifer goes to an awards ceremony where Bill is being honored to confront him, calling him out as a child molester in front of his wife and the other attendees.

Lara believes her father to still be alive, but Miller warns Lara that if she does not claim her inheritance, the family estate, Croft Manor, will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts and gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb, where she finds a pre-recorded video message from Richard detailing his research into Himiko, the mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to command the power over life and death. Richard warns Lara to destroy his research, but she ignores his warnings and investigates further.\nNot yet having received her inheritance Lara is forced to pawn the jade pendant her father gave her. With the money Lara travels to Hong Kong where she hires Lu Ren, captain of the ship Endurance, to sail into the Devil's Sea and the island of Yamatai. The ship capsizes in a violent storm and Lara has washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. She awakens only to encounter Mathias Vogel, the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organization called Trinity, which seeks to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Mathias takes Lara prisoner, claiming that he killed her father and revealing that he intends to use Richard's research to continue his expedition. He adds Lara and Lu to his slave force. The two of them try to escape, but only Lara succeeds.\nAfter surviving rapids and narrowly avoiding falling over a waterfall with the wreck of a wartime airplane, Lara is forced to kill a Trinity guard after nightfall. She follows a mysterious figure through the jungle and discovers that the figure is her father, who stayed on the island to prevent Trinity from finding Himiko's tomb. After Lara convinces him that she is real and not a figment of his imagination, Richard treats her injuries. Despite his protests, Lara sets off the next morning to steal Mathias' satellite phone. Lara makes contact with Lu, and he, along with the other slaves, stage a distraction that allows Lara to infiltrate the Trinity camp and take the phone. In the ensuing chaos, Lu grabs an assault rifle, provides cover for the escapees, and guns down several Trinity soldiers, while Richard makes his way to Himiko's tomb but is captured by Mathias, who persuades Lara to open the tomb, something she has prepared for since she was a child. At that point, the entrance to the tomb self-destructs and falls away, allowing them to enter the tomb which has not been seen for over two thousand years.\nThe party navigates a series of booby traps and locates Himiko's sarcophagus. When a Trinity soldier attempts to remove her corpse, he is infected by a highly infectious pathogen that reduces him to an aggressive, necrotic zombie. Lara realizes that Himiko was an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, who chose to entomb herself so that she could not infect others. Mathias concludes that Trinity wants to create a bio-weapon out of her body but he cannot remove Himiko's body and instead settles for cutting off a finger, which he seals in a pouch. In the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, although Mathias escapes and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the disease from spreading across the world. Lara pursues Mathias as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts and kills Mathias by kicking him off a ledge after a fight. She barely escapes the tomb as it collapses, regrouping with Lu and the slaves; they commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai.\nLara returns to London, where she formally accepts her inheritance and inadvertently discovers that Trinity's front company, Patna, is a subsidiary of Croft Holdings.

Hastar, her first and most beloved offspring, was greedy for all her gold and food. Hastar managed to acquire the gold from the goddess but the other gods attacked him just as he was about to acquire her food. Then, the goddess saved him on the condition that he could never be worshipped and would be forgotten by history. For years, Hastar slumbered inside his mother's womb. However, the residents of Tumbbad, where Hastar has been trapped in his mother's womb, defy this ancient taboo and build a temple dedicated to Hastar.

Although Hastar stole the goddess's gold, he was unable to acquire her grain. Therefore, being hungry for years, he desires flour. Vinayak physically trains himself to climb up and down a long rope and makes dolls out of dough to lure Hastar inside the goddess's womb. While he is distracted by the food, Vinayak swipes at Hastar's loincloth containing the gold. Vinayak regularly repeats the procedure to steal dropped coins.

Her parents used to fight a lot, and her father, Kishan, remarried soon after her mother's death. When Rishabh proposes to her, Kalindi is taken aback, but then agrees to marriage for Rishabh's happiness. Avni is a practising lawyer in Delhi whose specialization is divorce cases. Her mother is looking for a suitable groom for her, but Avni's daily professional experience makes her very nervous about marriage. Sakshi is already married but is living with her parents after moving out of her husband's home. The reasons for her break up with her husband are not known at this point. Meera has married an American, John, with whom she has a son named Kabir. Her father, also named Kabir, was intensely opposed to the marriage for cultural reasons. Meera is still estranged from her father, and though she misses him, she refuses to meet him until he accepts John and her son.\nKalindi travels to Delhi to get married, and stays with her uncle Kuki and his partner for these few weeks. Kishan and his current wife, Paromita, offer to help Kalindi in her wedding, though she remains disinterested. Kalindi is overwhelmed by Rishabh's affectionate, wholesome family and their deep, supportive involvement with each other. She is disturbed by the fact that they place way too much importance on the religious ceremonies connected to a Hindu wedding and on the significance of each ritual. She finds this cloying and thinks they will expect a lot from her after marriage, as she has always cherished her independence and individualism. Rishabh's family are surprised at the fact that Kalindi hardly seems to have any family, that she is even estranged from Kishan, and that the rather weird Kuki is unmarried and has a live-in partner.\nAll three of Kalindi's friends attend the engagement ceremony, which turns into a fiasco. Avni gets drunk and ends up sleeping with Rishabh's cousin Bhandari, who is a perfect stranger to her; they are caught. Sakshi, distraught at the gossipy women's jibes, leaves the party midway, Meera is questioned about her family's religious inclinations. Rishabh, too, ends up commenting on Kalindi not having \"proper\" family and friends. This infuriates her, and she leaves her own engagement party.\nThe next morning, Avni, Sakshi, and Meera find Kalindi in her old home, where she grew up. Rishabh apologizes to Kalindi, and they patch up. Kalindi tells him that she would be unable to live up to his family's expectations, and they amicably break off the engagement. Unhappy about it, Avni, Sakshi and Meera try to reason with her. Kalindi points out each of her friend's flaws instead, resulting in an argument.\nSakshi, believing they have become too overwhelmed with troubles, buys her friends a vacation to Thailand. They reconnect and come clean about their respective issues: Kalindi about her commitment issues, Avni about wanting to marry the right guy, and Sakshi about why her husband wants to divorce her. One day, he walked into their bedroom and found her masturbating with a vibrator; appalled, he decided to divorce her. Sakshi is embarrassed to tell her parents the truth. Meera explains that she and John haven't had sex in a year after her son's birth. Everyone decides to go back and face their problems.\nThe friends are recharged this way and resolve to get their families and boyfriends to either go their way or just go away. Sakshi tells her parents about the vibrator and her husband not understanding her need for it. They decide to support her in securing a divorce, of course with large alimony. Meera phones John and they make up. John calls Kabir Sr. and tells him about Kabir Jr.; he then flies down to India to meet everyone and take his wife and child back with him. Avni tells her mother about her reluctance to settle for an arranged marriage. She cheekily promises to keep her mother informed about her adventures as she tries out various hookups before making her decision. Kalindi's friends pressurize Kuki to resolve his feud with Kishan, which is both about property and lifestyle. Eventually, the brothers talk and resolve their issues, and as neither of them has other heirs, they accept the suggestion of transferring the family house to Kalindi as their wedding gift. She then proposes to Rishabh, and they decide to marry. The wedding is held in her home (as is traditional in India), and the ceremony is a smaller affair with fewer guests.

It bonds with Drake, who agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Weying reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Brock. When Brock and Venom are bonded again, the latter promises that it has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through its interactions with Brock, and the pair attempt to stop Riot and Drake with Weying's help.

Working under Nixon's economic adviser, Donald Rumsfeld, Cheney becomes a savvy political operative as he juggles commitments to his wife and their daughters, Liz and Mary. Cheney overhears Henry Kissinger discussing the secret bombing of Cambodia with President Richard Nixon, revealing the true power of the executive branch to Cheney. Rumsfeld's abrasive attitude leads to him and Cheney being distanced from Nixon, which works in both men's favor; after Nixon's resignation, Cheney rises to the position of White House Chief of Staff for President Gerald Ford while Rumsfeld becomes Secretary of Defense.

During the Reagan Administration, Cheney supports a raft of conservative, pro-business policies favoring the fossil fuel industries, as well as the abolition of the FCC fairness doctrine, which led to the rise of Fox News, conservative talk radio, and the increasing level of party polarization in the United States.

As vice president, Cheney works with Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld, legal counsel David Addington, Mary Matalin, and Chief of Staff Scooter Libby to exercise control of key foreign policy and defense decisions.\nIn the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Cheney and Rumsfeld maneuvered to initiate and preside over the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq. Various other events from his vice presidency are depicted, including his endorsement of the unitary executive theory, the Plame affair, the accidental shooting of Harry Whittington, and tensions between the Cheney sisters over same-sex marriage. Cheney's actions are shown to lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq, resulting in him receiving record-low approval ratings by the end of the Bush administration.\nWhile narrating Cheney's tearful deathbed goodbye to his family after another hospitalization, Kurt dies in a road traffic incident while jogging.

Lizzy confides in Emma about having lost her son, Samuel, in a stillbirth. Throughout her pregnancy, Lizzy had grown increasingly paranoid that a demon was coming to her in the night, especially when Isaac was away.\nLate one night, Gideon awakens Isaac and Lizzy, telling them Emma is unwell. They arrive at the couple's cabin, and Lizzy finds Emma hiding under a bed, talking to herself incoherently. She tells Lizzy that something is after her, and that it wants her unborn child. Lizzy renders Emma unconscious with chloroform, and Emma slaps her in the face during the struggle. Throughout her pregnancy, Emma continues to confide to Lizzy that she senses a supernatural presence that she cannot explain, but Lizzy disregards her. Emma tells Lizzy she plans to name the child after either her or Isaac.\nNear the end of Emma's pregnancy, she apparently shoots herself in the head in the middle of the night with Lizzy's shotgun. Lizzy attempts to perform a caesarean delivery to save Emma's unborn child, but is unsuccessful. Isaac and Gideon bury Emma and her child, and travel to report the deaths, leaving Lizzy alone. Lizzy's paranoia reemerges after they depart, and she encounters various frightening incidents: A pack of wolves attack her and kill her goat. The next day she sees her goat alive and, out of fear, shoots it. Late one night, she sees lights emanating from the Harper cabin, and goes to investigate. She finds the cabin empty, but is tormented by violent poltergeist activity before losing consciousness. She awakens the following morning, and finds Emma's diary lying on the floor. In it, she reads an entry in which Emma describes her disdain for Gideon, and claims to be carrying Isaac's child. Lizzy burns the pages in the fireplace. To relieve her anxiety, Lizzy renders herself unconscious with chloroform.\nSome time later, Lizzy is awoken by a reverend passing by. She provides him a meal and offers him lodging in the Harpers' empty cabin, but urges that he not answer the door after dark. In the middle of the night, the reverend knocks frantically on Lizzy's door, claiming to have been attacked by an unseen entity. She allows him in, but quickly realizes he is a manifestation of the entity itself, and flees, locking herself in the Harpers' cabin. In the morning, she finds the reverend's corpse outside. Shortly after, she visits Samuel's grave, planning to kill herself with a shotgun, but is distracted by the sound of Isaac returning on his horse. To Lizzy's shock, Isaac tells her that he passed the reverend en route, and that the two had a conversation.\nGideon returns, packs his remaining belongings, and moves away, but leaves behind a trunk of books for Lizzy and Isaac. In the trunk, Lizzy finds a tract detailing various \"demons of the prairie.\" Lizzy and Isaac argue about the tract, as he fears reading it will reignite her symptoms of prairie madness in general, paranoia about the supernatural in particular.
