Low budget and in b&amp;w, it's set in Greenwich Village, with what seems like a mostly improvised script. It begins as a late film noir crime tale involving a bank robbery where only one of a group of thieves escapes with his life, as well as $90,000 in loot.

Mason is the head beatnik. There's also the owner of both an upstairs coffeehouse and garret, where these beatniks hang out. They, in turn, bring the tourist trade in. Although the robbery is supposed to be the main focus of the plot, it quickly turns into more of a character study featuring these rebellious bon vivants and their odd lifestyle...", "genres": ["Drama"], "file": "65.json"}, "94063": {"title": "Sin You Sinners", "plot": "A stripper/fortune teller uses a magical Haitian amulet to keep young, and in so doing forces others to kill for her.", "genres": ["Drama", "Horror"], "file": "65.json"}, "94411": {"title": "Landmine Warfare", "plot": "In the Japanese war, a village on the edge of Chinese-controlled territory faces constant attacks.
