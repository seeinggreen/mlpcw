Chander was happy when he learned that the dream girl is Pooja; from then on, they start dating.\nWhen Pooja's parents learn about their relationship, they don't approve and force Pooja to get engaged to somebody else. Chander finds out about her wedding arrangements and goes to her house to speak to her father, who starts to abuse Chander and physically assault him, which leads to Chander striking back at him when Pooja arrives. This leads to a misunderstanding between Pooja and Chander that causes them to have a fallout, and Chander returns to his home where Pooja calls him to tell him that she learned the truth and wants to meet him. However, Chander is enraged and does not want to speak to her. Then Chander's childhood friend Jai takes the call for him and asks her to meet him at a deserted area with Chander, to which she agrees.\nAfter Pooja and Jai meet, a gang of men abducts Pooja as per Jai's instructions, who tricked her and revealed to have sold her to one of the city's most feared pimps, Baburao. As time passes, Chander misses Pooja after recalling the moments they had on her birthday and decides to go meet her but is intercepted by Mathur and a squad of policemen and is then taken to the police station for interrogation where Pooja's father reveals that she has been missing for two days. Mathur and his officers try to assault Chander, but he fights back and escapes from the police station. After that, Chander starts searching for Pooja and meets his friend Jai who tells him that he can help him to find her.\nJai contacts Mathur and tries to set up Chander to get him arrested in a dance bar. Chander figures out the set up in the dance bar after he sees an earring that he had given to Pooja in Jai's glass, but Jai manages to escape. Jai goes to the police station and requests inspector Mathur for protection and offers his help in apprehending Chander. They send Mathur's informer, Badru, to give Chander the wrong information about Jai's whereabouts. Chander goes there where it is very dark and kicks Jai down from behind. It turns out to be Mathur in Jai's clothes who reveals to him that Jai is safe in his informer Badru's house. Chander is surrounded by many policemen, but as Mathur knocks off his hat, it turns out to be his friend instead, who was disguised as Chander wearing tall boots and a tape recorder with Chander's voice. He reveals that Chander now knows where Jai really is from a phone which he had with him. Chander eventually finds Jai and beats him out in the street, and makes Jai take him to the brothel where he sold her. However, Chander gets involved in a fight with Baburau's men outside the brothel and gets stabbed by one of them.\nIt is shown that an Arabic man from Dubai had agreed to purchase Pooja for 50 lakh rupees and wants to take her with him to Dubai. Meanwhile, Chander is injured seriously after being stabbed and is being treated by his father and friends in Sapna's house, when Badru finds out about it, he informs inspector Mathur about it. When Mathur goes along with his constable Bawander Singh and other policemen to apprehend Chander, he learns that Chander escaped after Bawander Singh had tipped Chander's friends about the raid, which infuriates Mathur and leads to Bawander resigning from the job due to Mathur's partiality towards his job duties and personal vendetta against Chander.\nChander later finds out that Pooja had been taken by the Arabic man and goes to the airport to save her, where she is almost boarding the plane. However, Chander met Baburao, who gives him a chance to fight him and take Pooja away. After he beats Baburao in a hard-fought battle, he turns his attention towards Jai when Baburao gets up and tries to shoot Chander, Chander moves away, and the bullet hits Jai's forehead instead and kills him. Baburao tries to shoot Chander once again but is shot from behind by inspector Mathur who seemingly helped Chander and is met with a sincere salute from his constable, Bawander Singh.

Jean-Pierre has heard about US$1 million in gold in a safe aboard the sunken Pride of Chicago and that a major search for her wreck has begun. Aboard the La Chamade,  Jean-Pierre and Janine soon find the Caca de Toro. Arno and Jean-Pierre make a deal: Jean-Pierre \u2014 unable to dive due to eardrum damage \u2014 will not report the wanted Arno to the authorities or take him to Ortega and will provide diving and salvage equipment. In exchange, Arno will reveal the location of the Pride of Chicago, do the diving to bring up valuables from the wreck, and agree to split the profits. Jean-Pierre does not tell Arno about the gold aboard the yacht or that Ortega is alive.\nArno begins diving on the wreck and retrieving expensive jewelry from the bodies inside her hull, narrowly avoiding an attack by a shark swimming inside the wreck. Arno and Jean-Pierre divide up the day's salvaged valuables that evening, hiding their shares so that neither can steal from the other. Arno and Coquina have sex, and afterwards he gives her his father's watch to wear around her neck. On his next dive, he makes his first attempt to enter the wreck and nearly suffocates when his air hose snags on the wreck; Coquina saves him again.\nArno secretly keeps some of the salvaged jewelry for himself without letting Jean-Pierre know he had found it in the wreck, and he takes it to Sergeant Major Jim to bribe Jim to drop the murder charges he believes have been lodged against him. Jim accepts the bribe, then tells Arno that Ortega is alive and well. Arno returns to the La Chamade and accuses Jean-Pierre of lying to him about Ortega. A fight ensues, Arno throws Jean-Pierre overboard, and Arno pulls him back aboard only after Jean-Pierre informs him of the gold that is aboard the Pride of Chicago.\nWhile Arno makes a night dive on the Pride of Chicago, Jean-Pierre suggests to Coquina that Arno might betray her, take all the gold, and run off with Janine. He suggests that they double-cross Arno and Janine and split the profits with one another, and even that they could kill Arno by shutting off the air compressor feeding him air during his dive. In the wreck, the shark attacks Arno; he escapes, but loses the diving helmet and diving suit. Arno and Jean-Pierre go ashore and procure explosives with which to blow the safe open and an open-bottomed diving bell that will make up for the loss of the diving helmet and suit by allowing Arno to catch breaths of air without having to come to the surface. While they are gone, Janine confides in Coquina, telling her that she plans to leave Jean-Pierre as soon as the salvage operation is over and that Coquina should be careful about Arno abandoning her, especially when she is older and less beautiful. When Arno and Jean-Pierre return, Coquina tells Arno that Jean-Pierre plans to steal his share, and Arno says that she should play along and that they will turn the tables on Jean-Pierre by stealing his share instead.\nJanine accompanies Arno in the diving bell on his next dive, a night dive in which he detonates the explosives to open the safe aboard the Pride of Chicago. As he visits the diving bell to breathe, Janine proposes that they double-cross Coquina and Jean-Pierre, keep all the treasure for themselves, and run off together. Arno plays along and agrees with her. On the La Chamade, Jean-Pierre asks Coquina to join him in double-crossing Arno and Janine; Coquina agrees to the double-cross. At the wreck, Arno and Janine recover the gold, but the shark returns and attacks Janine through the open bottom of the diving bell, killing her and swimming off with her body.\nBack aboard the La Chamade, Jean-Pierre blames Arno for Janine's death, and Coquina appears to take Jean-Pierre's side. Ortega and one of his henchmen suddenly storm aboard and try to take all the salvaged valuables for themselves at gunpoint. In an effort to appease Ortega, Arno and Jean-Pierre both reveal the hiding places for their shares of the treasure aboard the La Chamade, but a struggle ensues. Ortega stabs Arno in the shoulder but Jean-Pierre shoots both Ortega and his henchman, killing them.\nCoquina tells Arno that she sided with Jean-Pierre in the argument over Janine's death merely to play along with Jean-Pierre in his scheme to double-cross Arno. With Arno's knowledge, Coquina drugs Jean-Pierre so that she and Arno can flee with all the salvaged gold and treasure, but Arno wakes up the next morning to find that Coquina also drugged him, and that she has disappeared in a skiff, taking all the gold and jewels for herself. He laughs ironically when Sergeant Major Jim arrives on another boat to arrest Jean-Pierre and him for possession of the gold.\nArno returns to his life as a beachcomber. One day he stops by the bar where he picks up his mail and receives a package.

The Queen left Princess Kida behind and was lifted up into a floating crystal, which merged with the Queen and created a protective dome over the city's innermost district, which sank beneath the waves.\n8,714 years later, in 1914, Milo Thatch, a Smithsonian Institution linguist who is ridiculed for his dream of finding Atlantis, is introduced by Helga Sinclair to eccentric millionaire Preston B. Whitmore, an old friend of Milo's grandfather. Whitmore reveals that he made a bet with Milo's grandfather to fund an expedition to Atlantis and gives Milo the Shepherd's Journal, a book describing the history and path to Atlantis, offering him a place in the expedition. The expedition is headed by Commander Rourke and includes Helga; demolitions expert Vinny; geologist Moli\u00e8re; medical officer Dr. Sweet; mechanic Audrey; radio operator Mrs. Packard; chef Cookie; and dozens of soldiers. Their submarine the Ulysses is attacked and destroyed by a mechanical leviathan guarding the entrance to Atlantis, leaving only a handful of survivors. Following the journal, they travel through a dormant volcano and eventually arrive at Atlantis, where they are met by the still young Princess Kida.\nAgainst her father's wishes, Kida enlists Milo to help Atlantis regain its glory, as its culture and knowledge have been decaying for centuries. Milo learns that a huge crystal, the Heart of Atlantis, gives the people longevity, and once powered their devices via smaller crystals they all wear. He also discovers that Rourke and the rest of the crew have known all along of the crystal and used the expedition as part of Rourke's evil plan to steal it and destroy Atlantis. Rourke fatally punches the king when he refuses to give up the location of the crystal but discovers the crystal's chamber regardless. Sensing the threat, the crystal merges with Kida. Rourke imprisons her in a crate, whereupon Milo convinces the crew to turn on Rourke, unwilling to be party to an innocent people's extinction. Rourke, Helga, and the soldiers start for the surface with Kida and destroy the bridge to trap the others behind. The dying King gives Milo his own crystal, explaining that he had tried to weaponize the Heart which caused the prior explosion and the fate of his wife. He says the crystal selects a royal host when the city is in danger, and begs Milo to save Atlantis and Kida, who will be lost to the crystal forever if not separated from it in time.\nMilo and his friends rally the Atlanteans to reactivate their flying machines and pursue the mercenaries. They quickly defeat Rourke's men, but he and Helga nearly escape with Kida. Rourke betrays Helga and throws her to her death. As she dies, she shoots the airship containing Kida's crate while Rourke and Milo fight, with the bullet damaging the airship. While the airship over the Heart burns, Milo slashes Rourke with a crystal-charged shard of glass, turning Rourke into a crystal monster before being shattered by the airship's propellers, killing him in the process. The airship awakens the volcano as it crash-lands. Milo and the rest flee back to Atlantis with Kida, who, still merged with the crystal, rises into the sky and awakens ancient Stone Guardians, who rise from the flooded portion of Atlantis, creating a dome to protect it from the lava flow. Once the danger is neutralized, the Crystal returns Kida, alive, to Milo. \nMilo, as a reward for saving Atlantis from Rourke and Helga, elects to stay in Atlantis with Kida, with whom he has fallen in love, and the rest return to the surface, each with their own Atlantean crystals and a portion of treasure.

After purchasing their new house, Trevor is cleaning the attic and discovers a chest.  In the chest there is a staircase, under which he finds a book of black magic that only he can read.  He begins studying the book, and starts to perform rituals with Faith.  In an effort to gain even greater power, he and Faith perform a ritual in an attempt to merge their two consciousnesses.  The ritual goes wrong, and Faith suffers a violent death.  Trevor calls the police.\nYears later, Trevor appears in a hospital.  Apparently having been found insane, he is now under the care of Dr. Ek. The doctor has learned about the book Trevor found, and wants to use it for his own means - one of which, he later admits, is to cure all mental illness.  It is around this time that Dr. Coffee comes to stay at the sanitarium and study under Dr. Ek. Trevor seems to have forgotten much of his past including practicing black magic and killing Faith.  Dr. Ek talks with Trevor, trying to help him regain any previous memories about where Trevor may have hidden the book.  At first Ek is very coy about his intentions.  He worries that if Trevor knows the value of the book and his intent, he won't willingly surrender it.\nDr. Ek sends Trevor to be rehabilitated at \"The House of Love.\"  While Trevor thinks he's being sent to a recovery facility filed with other patients, he is actually being sent to his former house which is now filled with actors pretending to be patients.

Hansen quotes Adam Smith advocating \"every man for himself\", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success in developing a new concept of governing dynamics. Publishing an article on his theory, he earns an appointment at MIT where he chooses Sol and Bender over Hansen to join him.\nIn 1953, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to study encrypted enemy telecommunications, which he deciphers mentally. Bored with his regular duties at MIT, including teaching, he is recruited by the mysterious William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense with a classified assignment: to look for hidden patterns in magazines and newspapers to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive in his search for these patterns, delivering his results to a secret mailbox, and comes to believe he is being followed.\nOne of his students, Alicia Larde, asks him to dinner, and they fall in love. On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into Charles and his niece, Marcee. With Charles' encouragement, he proposes to Alicia and they marry. Nash fears for his life after surviving a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, and learns Alicia is pregnant, but he is forced to continue his assignment. While delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University, Nash tries to flee from people he thinks are Soviet agents, led by psychiatrist Dr. Rosen, but is forcibly sedated and committed to a psychiatric facility.\nDr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia backs up the doctor, telling Nash that no \"William Parcher\" is in the Defense Department and takes out the unopened documents he delivered to the secret mailbox.

Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes to the house to find Nash had left their infant son in the running bathtub, believing \"Charles\" was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash accidentally knocks her and the baby to the ground, believing he's fighting Parcher.\nAs Alicia flees with the baby, Nash fights with his visions and realizes that all of them have looked the same ever since he saw them. He stops Alicia's car and tells her he realizes that \"Marcee\" isn't real because she doesn't age, finally accepting that Parcher and other figures are hallucinations.

Out of gratitude, Knolte teaches Jamal some basic sword-fighting manoeuvres, and also tells him that he has an idea that may give them an advantage in the upcoming battle.\nThe next day, Knolte and the rebels storm the castle, only to be surrounded by guards and Leo's bodyguard, Percival. Seemingly outmatched, the rebels are pushed back. The tide turns briefly when the legendary Black Knight charges in, breathing fire and scattering the guards, but he falls from his horse and is revealed to be Jamal. \nUsing their newfound skills, the peasants overpower the guards, but Knolte is severely wounded by Percival's longbow, who takes Victoria hostage. When a scared King Leo asks Percival for safety he, already seen as pathetic and weak, is killed by him and thrown into the moat.

Police are drawn to two conclusions on the sake cup: it either simply fell from Odell during the murder, or it was left deliberately as a message. The Junior Detective League conducts their own investigation and interrogates Theodore, who got the job because of Odell, and Kisaragi, who was in the middle of painting Mt.

Murnau's Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans three years later); international film star Charlie Chaplin; English writer Elinor Glyn; and Louella Parsons, a film critic for Hearst's New York American.\nSeveral of those participating in the weekend's festivities are at a crossroads in their lives and/or careers. Chaplin, still dealing with the critical and commercial failure of A Woman of Paris and rumors he has impregnated 16-year-old Lita Grey (who appeared in his film The Kid), is in the midst of preparing The Gold Rush. Davies longs to appear in a slapstick comedy rather than the somber costume dramas to which Hearst has kept her confined. Ince's eponymous film studio is in dire financial straits, so he hopes to convince Hearst to take him on as a partner in Cosmopolitan Pictures. Parsons would like to relocate from the East Coast to more glamorous Hollywood.\nHearst suspects Davies and Chaplin have engaged in an affair, a suspicion shared by Ince, who seeks proof he can present to Hearst in order to curry favor with him. In the wastepaper basket in Chaplin's stateroom, Ince discovers a discarded love letter to Davies and pockets it with plans to produce it at an opportune moment. When he finally does, Hearst is enraged. His anger is fueled further when he finds a brooch he had given Davies in Chaplin's cabin. Hearst concludes it was lost there during a romantic liaison, and he rifles Marion's room for further evidence.\nArmed with a pistol, Hearst searches the yacht for Chaplin in the middle of the night. Ince, meanwhile, runs into Davies and the two sit and talk with Ince donning a hat Chaplin had worn.  Davies explains to Ince her love for Hearst and her regret at an earlier affair with Chaplin.  She states \"I never loved him\" just as Hearst arrives behind them.  Thinking Davies is referring to him, and mistaking Ince for Chaplin, a jealous Hearst shoots Ince.  The assault is witnessed by Parsons, who had heard noises and went to investigate.\nHearst arranges to dock in San Diego and have a waiting ambulance take the dying Ince home. He phones the injured man's wife and tells her Ince attempted suicide when Livingston tried to end their affair, assuring her the truth won't reach the media. To the rest of his guests he announces Ince's ulcer flared up and required immediate medical attention. Davies, of course, knows the truth, and confides in Chaplin. Also armed with that knowledge is Parsons, who assures Hearst his secret will be safe in exchange for a lifetime contract with the Hearst Corporation, thus laying the groundwork for her lengthy career as one of Hollywood's most powerful gossip columnists.\nAfter seeing Ince off, Hearst confronts Davies and Chaplin. He is berated by Chaplin, who expects Davies to join him. Hearst, however, challenges Chaplin to guarantee Davies that he can promise her a happy life. When Chaplin fails to answer, Hearst informs Chaplin of the vow of silence he and the fellow guests have made to keep the weekend's activities a secret. Chaplin despairs as he realizes the murder has strengthened Davies' love for Hearst.\nThe film concludes with the guests leaving Ince's funeral, as Glyn relates what became of them:\n\nLivingston went on to star in a number of successful films and her film salary \"inexplicably\" went from $300 to $1000 a film.\nDavies starred in more of Hearst's films before finally being allowed to feature in a comedy Show People (1928), which was (as Chaplin predicted) a success and included a couple of cameo appearances by Chaplin. She stayed by Hearst's side until his death in 1951.\nChaplin married his teenage lover Lita Grey in Mexico and his film The Gold Rush was an overwhelming success.\nParsons worked for Hearst for many years and subsequently became one of the most successful writers in the history of American journalism.Tom Ince was largely forgotten after the events of his death.

In both kidnaps, Abdullah mentions \u2018Attipatti\u2019, which seemed to render his victims speechless.\nWith these two high-profile kidnappings, the case is handed over to CBI, led by Senior Officer Sarojini Harichandran. Sarojini finds out that both kidnap victims worked together in the Mayavaram division some years ago, and was involved in a riot that happened in Attipatti. However, a check with the Mayiladuthurai sub-collector's office and Nagapattinam collector's office found that there is no town or village in the area named Attipatti. She then visits the main collector's office in Tanjavur and is shocked to find out that the village Attipatti existed in records before 1973, but not in the years after that. She becomes certain that the kidnapper, too, has a link to Attipatti.\nMeanwhile, Abdullah becomes irritated with Indhu, who keeps longing for his affection. He scolds her and says that she doesn't know who he really is and the pain he endures in his heart.\nThrough a piece of information given by the Tanjavur office, the CBI team track down a former employee of the local government, which Attipatti was under. He tells them to visit Lutheran Chapel's Father Louis, who knew every single person of Attipatti. In a visit to the Lutheran Chapel, Sarojini and her team meet Father Kuriakose who inform them that Father Louis had passed away 10 years ago, but left a box to be handed over to whichever government body that comes to the church and asks about Attipatti. After reading the letter in the box, Sarojini instructs digging near the coastal area where Attipatti once located. She and her team are horrified to find hundreds of dead bodies buried deep under. They are presumably the former inhabitants of Attipatti. Buried with them is also a tombstone bearing the names of all who perished. After a quick verification with the last census, they found out one name is missing in the tombstone, a five-year-old named Arivanandam. Father Kuriakose informs Sarojini, based on church records, a boy named Anthony was baptised on the same year the atrocity happened, and that he eventually went on to obtain Law degree. Sarojini concludes that Arivanandam and Anthony are the same person, and he is Citizen, and her further investigation leads her to Abdullah. With the CBI officers prepare to ambush Abdullah in a mosque, he manages to escape via a secret route. Sarojini discovers Citizen's secret operation room within the mosque. There she finds out Citizen's next target is DGP Devasagayam. However, at the same moment, Citizen had already kidnapped the DGP. The CBI officers receive information that Citizen is hiding in Tada forest and go after him. In the forest, Indhu comes to meet Abdullah and reveals she already knew he was Citizen some time ago and that she still likes him in spite of that. CBI officers arrive at the forest and, after some chase, finally manage to arrest the Citizen.\nIn the trial, a flashback scene appears where Citizen tells the court what happened in his village, Attipatti. It was a hamlet of some 700 inhabitants surrounded by the sea. Therefore, it is often flooded by the rise in water levels, causing deaths. The area's MLA had promised to build a wall in exchange for votes. However, it was never built. When the villagers, led by Citizen's father, Subramani, go to the collector's office to ask about its status, the collector turned them away, saying a wall cannot be built in that area as the number of people is too small. The villagers later found out that the Collector, together with the MLA, the DGP and the Judge, had taken for themselves some 150 million rupees allocated by the government to build the wall. After that, when the four of them visited Attipatti, the outraged villagers embarrassed them by forcing them to eat moldy rice and pouring water on them. In response, the four officials vowed to make Attipatti disappear from the map. One night, they arrived at Attipatti with some men, caught all the villagers, tied them on a boat, tortured them and pushed them to the sea, killing all except Arivanandam.\nAs the scene switches back to the trial, Citizen explains he didn't kidnap the MLA because he had already been punished after losing in the election. With the judge, DGP and collector in the witness stand, Citizen tells the court death penalty or life in prison is too soft a punishment for them. He says corruption exists because government officers want to provide a luxurious life for their family members.

In Paris in 1969, young and introverted film editor Paul Ballard (Jeremy Davies) is currently working on a science-fiction adventure film set in the futuristic year of 2001, called Codename: Dragonfly, written and directed by renowned director Andrezej (G\u00e9rard Depardieu).\nThe main character of Codename: Dragonfly is the eponymous Dragonfly, a sexy freelance super-agent who lives in a spaceship perched atop the Eiffel Tower and undertakes assignments for the \"World Council\". Dragonfly's latest mission is to stop a revolutionary leader known as \"Mr. E\" (Billy Zane) who is based on the \"far-out\" side of the Moon. The World Council turns for help to Dragonfly, reluctantly so because she charges huge sums of money - with which the council literally showers her.\nAndrezej is utterly infatuated with his film's star who is playing Dragonfly, Valentine (Angela Lindvall), a young American whom he discovered at a political rally. Paul, an aspiring filmmaker himself, regularly borrows cameras and other equipment in order to film his own project: a black-and-white documentary of his own self-reflections. When the producers prove unhappy with Andrezej's ideas - or apparent lack of any real idea - for the movie's ending, they fire him. They are particularly upset with Andrezej's ideas for what they had expected would be an action movie: Andrezej believes the movie should end with a whimper instead of a bang, in order to subvert the audience's expectations.\nAndrezej is first replaced with the shallow, flashy Felix DeMarco (Jason Schwartzman), but ultimately the producers settle on Paul as the new director. They impress on him that his main task is to come up with a satisfying end to the movie, the filmmakers having determined that Dragonfly must chase after and finally confront a mysterious figure in a tunnel alleyway, but no one having been able to decide whom that mysterious figure should be.\nMuch as Andrezej before him, Paul finds his efforts to complete Codename: Dragonfly stymied by his infatuation both with Valentine and with the persona of Dragonfly. Paul has a girlfriend, Marlene (Elodie Bouchez), an Air France flight attendant who makes time for Paul despite her schedule, his obvious growing infatuation with Valentine, his obsession with film making and his self-absorption. Ultimately, Marlene leaves Paul. Paul is also challenged by the apparent work of a saboteur, who cuts up footage before it can be edited, and who sends cryptic threatening messages to the remaining crew. Others suspect Andrezej - who resents being fired and losing control of the film.\nPaul puts himself under increasing pressure from his inability to come up with an ending for Codename: Dragonfly - which he is told \u201chas to be fabulous\u201d - although isolated notions and images might slowly be coming together in his head. The movie's high-living Italian producer, Enzo (Giancarlo Giannini), not intimately involved in the production shoot but still subtly fatherly and supportive, tells Paul a good ending must be exciting and must finally resolve the mystery for the audience but \u201csurprise them a little.\u201d \u201cAstonish me,\u201d he challenges Paul. Paul continues moving forward, beginning to make certain changes in the plot, and occasionally plunging into personal fantasies in which the exotic character of Dragonfly soothes him as his loving companion against the stress of not knowing how to finish the movie.\nAs the crew prepares to shoot the climactic chase scene in Codename: Dragonfly, the saboteur sneaks onto the set and steals their finished footage. Valentine (still costumed and made up as Dragonfly from the shoot) and Paul jump into Dragonfly's futuristic prop car from the movie and chase the saboteur through Paris, with the fantasy of Dragonfly's world melding slightly into Paul's reality, and as the car chase ends Paul and Valentine/Dragonfly kiss. Paul on foot chases after and finally confronts the saboteur in an alleyway on the banks of the Seine not unlike the climactic alleyway in Codename: Dragonfly, and it is confirmed the saboteur is Andrezej. In a moment of vulnerability and mutual respect as filmmakers - even shared identity - Paul convinces Andrezej to return the film, while Andrezej secures Paul's promise that a main aspect of the movie's ending will remain as Andrezej had wished, though their exchange reveals nothing else of the ending. And, in a secondary scene shortly after, Paul gets a hint that slavishly filming all the events in one's life may not be the best way to capture their fleeting genuine essence.\nThe movie's ending is shot according to Paul's idea. It plays for us as it will be seen in the finished movie, and the identity of the mysterious figure chosen by Paul is revealed. The ending Paul devises is everything the producer asked for. It is unexpected, satisfying, and for Codename: Dragonfly even astonishing, carrying in its plot twist an emotional heft and genuineness that lifts the otherwise cheesy movie. The final scene finishes for us and fades out.\nFinally, Paul is a guest speaker at a French film festival in mid-1970. Despite signs of stature, he is asked by a festival participant to pass along a script to Felix DeMarco, as though he is still in the other man's shadow and suggesting quality and sincerity must always compete with the shallow and foolish. The festival also presents Paul's own film - the collection of self-reflections he'd been shooting over the course of Codename: Dragonfly. In voiceovers accompanying Paul's film, it is established that Marlene and Paul never got back together, and the last shot of his film, finally transitioning into color, suggests Valentine is now a part of his life.", "tmdb_id": 27834}, "2155481": {"title": "A Crack in the Floor", "plot": "For the past 33 years Jeremiah Hill (Roger Hewlett) has lived alone, with no contact with the outside world, and he intends to keep it that way.

Her advice is usually followed, however, because she secretly is in a relationship with her boss, Chris Magruder, who constantly reassures her that they will be free to pursue their relationship in public once he finalizes his divorce with his wife.\nWhile attending a dinner with some employees, Voltan, a stage magician calls on Betty Ann and C.W. to be in his hypnotism act. Using the words \"Madagascar\" and \"Constantinople\" on them, respectively, as trigger words to put them in a trance, the two are given the suggestion that they are newlyweds who are madly in love before being reawakened. When C.W. returns home for the evening, he receives a call from Voltan, who uses C.W.'s trigger word to put him back in a trance and orders him to steal jewels for him. C.W. has no recollections of these crimes after he is woken up and is determined to prove himself by solving the crimes. He starts investigating Betty Ann on the grounds of her suspicious behavior (actually related to her affair with Chris) and sneaks into her house one evening. There, he witnesses Chris telling her that he has reconciled with his wife and will not have a divorce.

Barbara convinces him to help them, and the priest speaks with two fishermen at the docks, who volunteer to take either Paul or Barbara to the wreck. Despite Paul's misgivings, Barbara stays to try to find a phone in order to call the police and a doctor while Paul goes to help their friends.\nVicki and Howard are mysteriously missing, however, and Paul is taken back to Imboca, where he is sent to the hotel that Barbara was supposed to have gone to.

He ends up in a macabre tannery full of human skins, where he discovers Howard's remains. He escapes the tannery by starting a fire and finds momentary safety with an old drunkard named Ezequiel, the last full-blooded human in Imboca.\nEzequiel explains to Paul that, many years ago, the village fell on lean times. A fishing ship captain named Orpheus Cambarro (based on captain Obed Marsh) convinced the locals to worship Dagon rather than God. Orpheus's first offerings to Dagon brought Imboca enormous wealth in the form of fish and gold. This caused the locals to make him the high priest of the Church of Dagon, help him dismantle the local Catholic church, and kill the priest to establish the church in Dagon's honor (based on Esoteric Order of Dagon). However, the wealth brought upon by Imboca from worshiping Dagon had a terrible price, as Dagon demanded blood sacrifices and human women to breed with. Corrupted by greed, the villagers and Cambarro blindly followed this demand. These were, respectively, the fates of Ezequiel's father and mother who resisted Opherus's heretical practice. Over time, the people of Imboca eventually began to die off, leaving only the half-fish/half-human offspring of Dagon and Dagon's offsprings themselves to settle in the village, who would kidnap unexpected trespassers to sacrifice to Dagon, while Ezequiel watched the village go to ruin and lamented the villagers' foolishness in worshiping a demon for short-lived prosperity.\nPaul begs Ezequiel to help him escape. Ezequiel relents and takes Paul to the Mayor's manor, so he can steal the town's only car which belongs to Orpheus Cambarro's grandson Xavier Cambarro. Ezequiel distracts some Imbocans long enough for Paul to slip inside, but he accidentally honks the horn while trying to hot-wire the engine. Forced to flee into the manor, Paul finds a beautiful woman named Uxia, the mermaid from his dreams. She saves him from discovery, but when he finds that her legs have been mutated into tentacles, he flees in horror, despite her pleas for him to stay.\nPaul narrowly escapes a horde of villagers in the car, but ends up crashing. He is caught and thrown into a barn, where he is reunited with Vicki, Ezequiel, and Barbara. The three plan to escape, but the attempt is foiled. Having been raped and impregnated by Dagon, the traumatized Vicki kills herself. Paul and Ezequiel are separated from Barbara and end up in a butchery, where they are chained and given a chance to join the worship of Dagon. When they both refuse, Paul apologizes to Ezequiel, who thanks Paul for helping him to remember his mother and father, who died resisting Dagon and the cult. He is flayed alive before Paul's eyes as they recite the 23rd Psalm together.\nPaul is saved by the appearance of Uxia, who informs him that he has no choice but to join them. He offers to stay with her in return for Barbara's release, but she insists that Barbara must stay and bear Dagon's child. When Paul seems to concede, Uxia tells the priest of Dagon to make arrangements for their marriage. After Uxia leaves, Paul escapes, killing the guards and the priest. He starts looking for Barbara, collecting a can of kerosene on the way. When he reaches the church, apparently intending to burn it down, he instead discovers a hidden passage that leads below ground to a ritual chamber. There a congregation of Imbocans watch Uxia prepare Barbara to be offered to Dagon; she is chained by her wrists and lowered nude into a deep pit leading to the sea. While the Imbocan congregation and Uxia call to Dagon, Paul attacks, dousing several villagers in kerosene and setting them on fire. He winches Barbara back out of the pit, but Dagon has already raped her and she pleads with him to kill her.

Compounded with the fact that he stayed out past curfew that night, Sally attempts to talk to Jack about his problems, but he angrily orders her out of his bedroom, slightly shoving her in the process. A short time later, while hanging out with his friend Luke, Jack is arrested for shoplifting at the local mall, and when Sally attempts to question him afterwards, he again becomes furious and smashes a glass. She later tries to ask Jack what caused this outburst, but he tells her he doesn't know and tearfully apologizes.\nNot long afterwards, Sally goes on a date with a colleague named Frank, who is also divorced. While Leo warms up to him immediately, Jack is outright rude when Frank arrives to pick Sally up, and when she reprimands Jack for his behavior, he shouts at her and then pushes her aside. Later that night, Jack receives a phone call from Luke, and although entrusted with watching his little brother, he leaves Leo alone to go to a party. Furious, Sally grounds Jack for a month and takes the phone to call Luke's mother. A confrontation ensues, which soon turns physical, and when Sally slaps Jack in retaliation, he attempts to punch her, but she ducks and he ends up putting his hand through a window, cutting his arm in the process.\nA couple of nights later, Sally has Frank over for dinner, but Jack is once again rude, and when Sally tries to talk to him afterwards, it escalates into another physical confrontation, which is cut short by a visit from the police.

As a result, Sally is released and Jack gets arrested for assault. Although the prosecutor is unwilling to drop the charges against Jack, an offer is made to defer them if Sally and Brad file an at-risk youth petition, which mandates that Jack be placed in a treatment program, during which time he will also be put in temporary foster care, and that his parents undergo individual counseling. Afterwards, Brad takes responsibility for his own anger issues, which Sally points out that their sons have picked up on, and informs him they need to work together to get Jack the help he needs.\nDuring his group counseling sessions, Jack comes to understand that his violent outbursts were learned behavior, rooted in the verbal abuse his father often dealt towards his mother, while Sally's individual sessions gives her the opportunity to acknowledge her own father's verbally abusive behavior toward her mother, as well as her own tendency to back down on enforcing discipline in an effort to avoid a verbal showdown, and what she perceives as having failed at her marriage. However, her therapist points out that Sally did not fail at her marriage; she simply couldn't tolerate the verbal abuse from Brad, and getting out of it was the best thing she could have done.\nAfter returning home, Jack admits to his mother about having felt relief when Brad left and knowing she felt the same, while Sally acknowledges she had no idea how to make Brad stop behaving the way he did towards her, and Jack adds that he didn't either.

Casares and Carmen support the Republican loyalists, and are hiding a large cache of gold being used to back the Republican treasury; the orphanage has also been subject to attacks from Francisco Franco's troops, and an inert bomb sits in the courtyard.\nOne day, an orphan named Carlos arrives with Ayala and Dom\u00ednguez, two loyalists. Casares and Carmen take Carlos in, and he soon strikes up a friendship with Jaime, the orphanage bully, as well as Galvez and Owl. However, Carlos soon begins having visions of a mysterious entity, and hears stories about a child named Santi who went missing on the day the bomb was dropped in the courtyard. On his first night at the orphanage, Carlos is dared by Jaime to sneak to the kitchen for water after curfew. The boys reach the kitchen, but Jaime sneaks back to the dormitory, leaving Carlos alone. Carlos hears a whisper telling him that \"many of you will die.\" Frightened, Carlos rushes outside, but is caught by Jacinto. The next morning, Casares asks who snuck out after curfew but Carlos claims he went alone. This, as well as Carlos saving Jaime from falling in a cistern, earns him Jaime's friendship.\nJacinto knows of the gold hidden at the orphanage, and uses his affair with Carmen as an opportunity to take her keys and search for the treasure. That night, the boys hear strange noises and Carlos decides to investigate. He sneaks out, and encounters a pale figure of a young boy with a bleeding wound on his head, which causes him to run back into the building. Later, after flipping through Jaime's sketchbook, Carlos finds a drawing of a ghostly figure labeled \"Santi\", leading him to suspect that Jaime knows more than the other boys.\nCasares sees that Ayala has been captured by the nationalists. Fearing Ayala will soon be tortured into revealing the gold\u2019s location at the orphanage, he convinces Carmen that they must evacuate the children immediately. Jacinto overhears the conversation and confronts Carmen, demanding the stash of gold and crassly bringing up their affair in front of Casares. Enraged, Casares points a gun at Jacinto and forces him to leave.\nAs the orphans and faculty prepare to leave, Conchita discovers Jacinto pouring gasoline around the kitchen. She shoots him in the arm after he mocks her, causing a furious Jacinto to start a fire before fleeing the building. Carmen and fellow teacher Alma attempt to put out the fire, but fail to prevent an explosion; Alma is killed by the blast, as are several of the children. Casares finds a mortally wounded Carmen inside the building, and tearfully stays with her as she dies. Casares decides to remain in the charred orphanage with the surviving children, arming himself for Jacinto's return.\nThe following night, Jaime reveals to Carlos the details of Santi's disappearance: Jaime and Santi had been collecting slugs at the cistern, when they spotted Jacinto attempting to open the safe where the gold was kept. Jaime managed to escape, but Jacinto cornered Santi and attempted to threaten him into keeping silent. In anger, Jacinto shoved Santi against a stone wall, giving him a severe head injury and sending him into shock. A panicked Jacinto then tied stones to Santi before sinking his body in the cistern. A terrified Jaime then ran into the courtyard, only to have the bomb land several feet from him moments later.\nJaime insists that he is no longer scared of Jacinto, and will kill him if he returns. Conchita attempts to walk to the nearest town for help when she encounters Jacinto and two associates driving back to the orphanage to claim the gold. Jacinto threatens her with a knife, telling her to apologize for shooting him, but she insults him instead, and he stabs her to death.\nCarlos has a final encounter with Santi's ghost, who he is no longer afraid of after hearing the circumstances of his death. The ghost quietly demands that Carlos bring Jacinto to him.\nCasares dies of his injuries as Jacinto and his associates reach the orphanage and imprison the orphans while they search for the gold. The two other men eventually grow impatient and leave, but Jacinto finds and takes the stash. Meanwhile, Jaime encourages the children to fight back. They fashion weapons from sharpened sticks and broken glass and attack Jacinto in the cellar, finally pushing him into the cistern where he had dumped Santi's body.

Maybe the light is the light within our interior enlightenment. Nature's biggest catastrophe is when man began to think. However, before God created light, he said: \u201cLet there be light!\u201d So, before light there was the voice of God. \nA sound ... a big bang ... the sound of thunder ... rolling off a drum.

Switching places with lowly French deckhand Eugene Lenormand, Napoleon will make his way to Paris, at which time Eugene will announce the switch, allowing Napoleon to reclaim his throne.\nHowever, the plan quickly goes awry: the ship Napoleon is serving on abruptly changes its itinerary and docks in Belgium instead of France. Having to make his way to France by land, and gaining an appalling look at the tourist trap the battlefield of Waterloo has become, he is finally met at the French border by a loyal agent, Sgt. Bommell, formerly of the Imperial Guard.  Bommell gives him the name of another agent in Paris he can trust, Lt. Truchaut.\nArriving in Paris, Napoleon is surprised to find that Truchaut has recently died.  Passing himself off as an old comrade of the Lieutenant, Napoleon accepts the hospitality of Truchaut's widow, Nicole, whom everyone calls \"Pumpkin\", and makes the acquaintance of her other lodger, Dr. Lambert and her adopted young son, Gerard.\nThe crucial flaw in the plan reveals itself when, back on Saint Helena, Eugene decides he likes living in the relative luxury of Napoleon's exile, and refuses to reveal the switch. Napoleon's French entourage find themselves unexpectedly powerless, as Eugene stuffs his face with sweets, dictates his own bawdy version of Napoleon's official memoirs, and even manages to convince his British captors that he is the true Napoleon.\nWith no news from Saint Helena, Napoleon is drawn into Pumpkin's life. When her fruit-selling business is on the brink of failure, he applies his own talents for planning and organization, and the business becomes prosperous again.\nAs affection develops between Napoleon and Pumpkin, Dr Lambert, who had designs on Pumpkin himself, jealously searches for some kind of dirt on \"Eugene\".

Realizing that the dead man on the island is not Napoleon, the British garrison commander lays out their options: either they announce the fraud, and face heinous punishment, or else maintain the illusion, and all will be well. \"Gentlemen\" he tells them \"what we have here is a dead emperor\".When \"Napoleon's\" death is announced throughout France, the real Napoleon abruptly remembers his original plan and announces to Pumpkin that it is time for him to take his rightful place on the French throne.  To his fury, Pumpkin is horrified and dismisses him as delusional, pleading that she loves Eugene, but hates Napoleon for taking her husband away.\nWith no loyalist agent in Paris to vouch for his identity, Napoleon finds himself an Emperor without an army, or a friend.  He is reduced to going to Dr Lambert, who he realizes stole the portrait, and demanding it back. When he demands to be told \"who I am\", Lambert retorts, \"I will show you.\"\nIn revenge for being beaten to Pumpkin's affections, Lambert lures him onto the grounds of a sanitorium, where it seems every patient is dressed up as Napoleon, and pretending to be him.  Lambert withdraws, expecting him to be rounded up by the attendants, but a shaken Napoleon escapes the grounds by climbing over the wall, suffering a nasty cut on his hand from the chevaux de frise on top.\nEmotionally and physically exhausted, he returns home to Pumpkin's house.

Leon and his friend Trish (Eva Mendes) have been videotaping the activities of Strutt's gang, hoping that it might help prove Shaun's innocence and get him out of jail.\nBoyd meets Mulcahy at a parking lot and to inform her what he has uncovered. Montini, Useldinger, and some other men try to kill Boyd and Annette. Mulcahy is killed in the chase and Boyd escapes. Boyd calls Frank and tells him that Strutt will be having a meeting at a warehouse in about an hour, to sell the heroin that was stolen. Strutt plans to try to sell it to Leon and T.

Boyd realizes that it is Frank who is behind everything. Clark blows open the door and barges in with backup, including police chief Hinges (Bill Duke). Useldinger shoots Boyd and as he is about to shoot him again, George shoots Useldinger dead. Chief Hinges kills Frank by shooting him four times with a shotgun. After a fight with Boyd, Strutt grabs a case full of money and runs up to the roof, where a helicopter is waiting.

The experiment is led by Professor Klaus Thon and his assistant, Dr. Jutta Grimm. He decides to join in.\nTarek participates as a journalist while wearing a pair of glasses with a built-in mini-camera. After a car accident he suffers shortly before the experiment, Tarek meets a woman called Dora. She spends the night with him and Tarek keeps thinking of her, shown in flashbacks. The 20 volunteers are pronounced guards and prisoners, 12 prisoners and 8 guards, and are being observed by a team of scientists.\nIn the experiment, the prisoners lose their civil rights and have to obey arbitrary rules, such as the obligation to completely finish their meals. The guards are given nightsticks, but are told not to use violence in any case. Each prisoner's name is taken away and replaced by a number. Tarek (prisoner number 77) initially refuses to acknowledge the guards' superiority by drinking the milk of one of his co-prisoners because of that prisoner's lactose intolerance, or by throwing his blanket out of his cell to provoke the guards. He befriends his cellmates Steinhoff and Sch\u00fctte. Psychological changes develop and the situation deteriorates. The circumstances seem to be escalating after only a few days. It becomes clear that limits are not only being reached, but being surpassed when the guards kidnap Tarek from his cell late in the night, order him to strip fully naked, shave his head bald and urinate on him.\nThe guards become excessively aware of their power and use the prisoners' fear to make them obedient. On both sides, one person is considered dominant. On the prisoners' side, this is Tarek, and on the guards' side, it is the quiet guard Berus, a sadist, whose motto during the experiment is: \"Humiliation is the only way we can solve these troubles.\" From that moment on, the guards start to use more and more violence against the prisoners. The scientists engage in a discussion whether or not to abort the experiment. Dr. Grimm suggests putting an end to the alarming situation, but Professor Thon refuses to stop the experiment until the violence has reached a maximum.\nDora meanwhile returns to Tarek's apartment and discovers his participation contract for the experiment. She surprises him by showing up for a visit day. Tarek, who was forced to clean the toilet with his own clothes, pleads to the friendly guard Walther Bosch to secretly bring her a message. Berus intercepts Bosch, however, and tells Dora that everything is all right and refuses to let Tarek see Dora.\nThe situation becomes critical and more violence is involved. The prisoners are being abused and their self-esteem is drastically decreased by the guards' power. Most of the violence is directed against Tarek and he is locked up in solitary confinement inside a \"black box\" resembling a safe. Sch\u00fctte, protesting this, is beaten severely, bound and gagged with duct tape and forced to sit on a chair. Later he suffocates to death due to his bloody nose drying up while gagged.\nBosch is beaten by the other guards for his \"betrayal\" and is put into confinement. Lars, a member of Thon's team, notices this and attempts to contact Professor Thon, who is attending a conference. The guards, who are aware that the professor cannot be reached by phone, are convinced by Berus that the entire situation is a test put up by Thon's team, in order to make the guards handle an exceptional situation. They take over control of the facility and capture Lars, Dr. Grimm and the other scientists, who are put into confinement as well, and gradually start their own prison in which they engage in brutally sadistic games with total control.\nDora comes to the facility a second time to speak to Tarek and is lured into a room by Berus, where he locks her up. Dr. Grimm is handcuffed and gagged with duct tape while the guard Eckert attempts to rape her. He is stopped by Tarek, who escaped from solitary confinement through the use of a screwdriver that he found inside the \"black box\". Tarek knocks down Eckert and frees Lars, Bosch, Steinhoff, Dr. Grimm and the other prisoners. They manage to escape by removing the wall paneling of one of the cells with the screwdriver. Meanwhile, Professor Thon hears Lars' desperate message in his voicemail and leaves for the facility.\nMeanwhile, Steinhoff and Tarek stay behind in order to prevent Berus from coming after them. Professor Thon reaches the facility and demands an explanation from Eckert, who accidentally injures him with a pistol. The fleeing prisoners are ambushed by the guards and trapped. Bosch, who could not keep up with the others, loses his sanity and kills Eckert with a fire extinguisher. Dora then escapes the room she was locked up in, and steals Eckert's gun. She injures one of the guards while he is engaged in fighting Tarek and Steinhoff, leaving only Berus to fight them. Tarek incapacitates Berus, who is nearly choked to death by Steinhoff until Tarek convinces him not to kill Berus.\nThe film ends with a news break, confirming two deaths (Sch\u00fctte and Eckert) and three severely injured (Thon, Berus, and Bosch). Both Berus and Thon will be put on trial, Berus for multiple homicides and torture with rape, and Thon for allowing an illegal and unethical experiment.

Hideshi explains that there is either a traitor in their midst or else someone from another group deliberately leaked the code word from negotiations.\nAfter the meeting, Hisako shows Hideshi a photo of the killer with the scar that the Mutsumi Group is distributing around Tokyo. Hideshi recognizes the killer as his younger brother Takeshi but feels that Iwaida needed to die.

Franklin's best friend Bear and his little sister Beatrice come to collect Franklin's pet goldfish, Goldie, and Franklin accidentally leaves his favorite stuffed toy dog Sam behind.  Franklin thinks that Harriet dumped Sam in the snow on purpose, when in reality Beatrice had found Sam and Bear had failed to give it back to Franklin before they left.  Franklin is still annoyed with Harriet when they get to Faraway Farm, and he becomes even more annoyed when he learns that he and Harriet will be sleeping in the same room.  Later that evening, his grandmother, Jenny, tells a strange story from her childhood about a reindeer.  This story involves a flashback showing young Jenny and her father (Mrs. Turtle's grandfather and Franklin and Harriet's great-grandfather).  Jenny admits that she might have imagined things just as Mr. Turtle takes a family portrait, in which Franklin gives a sad look because he still misses Sam.  Jenny then shows Franklin Sirius outside and sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star to him before sending him to bed.\nThe next day, as Franklin feeds the chickens, Jenny lets him in on a little surprise - she is fixing up an old sleigh for Grandfather Turtle. Franklin decides to help, and Jenny introduces him to her neighbors, the Collies, who collect the polish for the sleigh.

Harriett then reveals that she has the bell.  With Franklin's approval, she rings it, and this time two reindeer come.  One of them has the same exact bell as the one Franklin and Harriet have.

Sakina leaves with a heavy heart. She meets her whole clan back in Lahore. Everyone is thrilled to see her. Later, when she wants to return to India, her mom tells her that she was about to be disowned as people were babbling about her staying with an Indian Jat. Her father, too, relates all of their hardships during the journey from India to Pakistan. Sakina is hurt and heart-broken. But she starts protesting when her parents' friends start using her post-marriage life as a publicity stunt and depict her in-laws badly to extract more sympathy and votes from the Pakistani population. Later she is introduced to a very handsome guy who hails from a very influential rich family. She is told that she would be marrying him. But Sakina refuses and even asks the Qazi Saheb to leave her alone, saying second marriage during the husband's lifetime is a sin. Her parents and Mamaji are irate about that. They forcibly lock her up in a room inside the palace.\nAfter learning they will not get a visa, Tara and his son, accompanied by a friend, enter Pakistan illegally at the border. Tara tries to take shelter in his old friend's house but hearing his wife fight about that. He leaves the place with his son Jeet and his assistant.

A fight is about to break out when the priest stops them, as this can end up harming Sakina's father's career in politics. Ashraf Ali agrees to their marriage under two conditions: they should live in Pakistan, and Tara should convert to Islam. These conditions are accepted by Tara in public the next day, which was against Ashraf Ali's plans. He makes Tara insult his country to prove that he is a true Pakistani, which enrages him, and this makes him kill some member of the large mob that Ashraf hired to kill him. Tara, Sakina, their son, and a friend manage to escape. Tara and Sakina escape from the city and hide in a poor couple's cottage near the border forest. But the man's wife is a greedy woman who wants all of Sakina's ornaments for herself.

Some Scottish politicians attribute the deteriorating relations to a recent influx of Kurdish asylum seekers in Glasgow, supported by local authorities and handled by the Asylum Seeker Resettlement Project, which they claim is unwanted by the British public and has resulted in a backlash by disaffected citizens.\nOne such asylum seeker, Sherko Hussein (Sherko Zen-Aloush) struggles to make a living with his illegally underpaid job, having moved from Iraq with his daughter Resa (Benae Hussein) to northern Glasgow. While in a shopping centre with Resa, he notices that Resa has developed a bad cough and is unwell. He asks ASRP worker Robina Dhoody (Robina Qureshi), assigned to the Husseins, to watch his daughter while he goes out to work, to which she reluctantly agrees. Noticing the poor conditions in which they are living, Robina becomes concerned about Resa's health, and convinces Sherko to take her to Broomyhill Infirmary.\nDoctor Annie Millbrook (Morag Calder) diagnoses Resa with acute influenza and prescribes antibiotics to her and admits Resa to the ward. Robina notices that the hospital is inundated with large numbers of other asylum seekers from the same block of flats that the Husseins live in, all presenting with similar flu-like symptoms. However, she is met with a cool response when she encourages Sherko to complain to the authorities, who is fearful he will be discriminated against because of his migrant status and deported back to Iraq, and he implies that Robina does not care or understand their plight, which offends her.\nGlasgow Central Police receive an anonymous email with imagery of dead livestock and other threatening media. The force ignores the email.\nMeanwhile, a neighbour of the Husseins, Hamaz Mohammed, suddenly deteriorates and despite attempts to revive him, dies from his illness. This concerns the Kurdish community, who worry a similar fate awaits their affected members, and confuses the medical staff treating the asylum seekers, who order a postmortem and hold a meeting with the families of the asylum seekers to reassure them. Robina becomes suspicious about the circumstances of Hamaz's death and becomes convinced that the conditions in which the asylum seekers live is attributable to Hamaz's death. However, she is warned by her superior Bill Grigson (Laurie Ventry) to fall in with the official angle and that investigating her \"wildcat\" theories will be both fruitless and unhelpful to the situation. Despite this, she becomes determined to act when at the public meeting, Millbrook and other officials accidentally reveal that Hamaz died of an unknown infection and that it could be a serious viral pathogen such as TB, exacerbated by Robina mentioning TB which is picked up by the interpreter and disseminated to the community.\nRobina is convinced that the asylum seekers contracted TB by way of infectious animal ash being blown from an incinerator north of the high-rise flats the Kurdish live in. She attempts to break into the compound discreetly, but is caught by the security firm guarding the facility and removed. Grigson asks her to focus on her job of integrating asylum seekers and to allow the medical staff to treat the contagion without her interference, warning that the council will not tolerate repeated maverick actions. However, Robina ignores this and immediately returns to Broomyhill to interrogate Millbrook.\nOvernight, police and racial groups and protesters clash in heavy riots across the UK, particularly in the Glasgow area, and emergency services struggle to maintain order as the social unrest escalates.\nAt Broomyhill, patients begin to make decisive recoveries and Millbrook begins to discharge the asylum seekers. However, she remains concerned at the unusual pathology and the death of Hamaz. While waiting for the postmortem results, she investigates possible causes of the illness experienced by the Kurdish. She eventually reaches an alarming conclusion; it is possible that Hamaz has been killed by anthrax bacteria. This is confirmed by the postmortem of Hamaz. Grigson learns of Robina's illegal activity in investigating the illness and warns that further scaremongering regarding the epidemic will result in her being sacked. More emails are sent to Glasgow Central, which fails to act despite the threats communicated to them in the email.\nAn emergency outbreak control team is assembled consisting of personnel from all of the relevant departments; however, the NHS chief executive is adamant that the mounting threat of an anthrax attack be censored from the press, worrying at the public panic and the resulting collapse of the already overstretched infrastructure, and the team are ineffectual in responding to the threat of the illness, treating the potential outbreak as an isolated case and investigating nearby agricultural facilities for sources of anthrax outbreaks, believing that Hamaz may have contracted the virus from moonlighting cheap farm labour. However, this is leaked to the media, which begins to make a connection between the Kurdish epidemic and the illness\n\n\n== References =="}, "12025545": {"title": "Gasoline (film)", "plot": "A young lesbian couple, Stella and Lenni, go on the run after the accidental death of Lenni's mother.", "tmdb_id": 12800}, "19483856": {"title": "Gaudi Afternoon", "plot": "Cassandra, an expatriate American book translator (Judy Davis) living in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain, who is hired by a mysterious woman, Frankie (Marcia Gay Harden), to locate her missing husband so he can sign some important papers.

Even though she is a talented artist, her art teacher, Roberta, believes that art must be socially meaningful and dismisses Enid's sketches as nothing more than \"light entertainment\".\nThe girls see a personal ad in which a lonely, middle-aged man named Seymour asks a woman he met recently to contact him. Enid makes a prank phone call to Seymour, pretending to be the woman and inviting him to meet her at a diner. The two girls and their friend, Josh, secretly watch Seymour at the diner and make fun of him. Enid soon begins to feel sympathy for Seymour, and they follow him to his apartment building. Later they find him selling vintage records in a garage sale. Enid buys an old blues album from him, and they become friends. She decides to try to find women for him to date.\nEnid has meanwhile been attending her remedial art class, and she persuades Seymour to lend her an old poster depicting a grotesquely caricatured black man, which was once used as a promotional tool by Coon Chicken Inn, the fried chicken franchise now known as Cook's Chicken, where Seymour works in corporate.

Martian society has become matriarchal, centering on the city of Chryse, with smaller, far-reaching outposts connected by an expansive network of trains. In the wake of a series of mysterious 'incidents', Mars Police Force officer Lt. Melanie Ballard is called before a tribunal to give testimony following a disastrous mission to the remote mining outpost Shining Canyon to retrieve convicted felon James 'Desolation' Williams of which she is apparently the sole survivor.\nThrough a series of flashbacks, and flashbacks within flashbacks as new perspectives are incorporated into the narrative, Ballard recounts her mission to Shining Canyon. Accompanied by commanding officer Helena Braddock, cocky sergeant Jericho Butler and rookie officers Bashira Kincaid and Michael Descanso, Ballard arrives at Shining Canyon to find the town seemingly deserted. Investigating the town's jail, Braddock discovers a trio of individuals who appear to have sealed themselves into one of the cells; among them science officer Dr. Arlene Whitlock.\nBallard and Butler discover a number of disoriented miners and an escaped Desolation. The group are soon attacked by several of the miners, forcing Ballard and Desolation to band together and incapacitate them. Ballard is forced to shoot and kill one of them, causing their affliction to be passed on to one of the three survivors. Butler, venturing out to the edge of town in pursuit of one of the feral miners, discovers a row of severed heads mounted on spikes, including the head of Commander Braddock, and a large assembly in the canyon below committing horrific acts of self-mutilation and ritualistic execution.\nDesolation's associates soon arrive and force Ballard and Butler to release him. While they originally plan on leaving the officers and remaining miners to die, Ballard convinces them to work together to survive. Their initial effort to escape is halted when the army of feral miners converge on their position, killing, injuring and infecting several of their number. Confronted by Ballard, Whitlock eventually explains that she fled from her post after discovering an ancient underground vault created by an extinct Martian civilization. When the door to the vault was opened, it released hostile spirits or \"ghosts\", which took possession of the workers, causing their violent behavior. Killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another host. Ballard surmises that these Martian spirits believe humans to be an invading race. Ballard is briefly possessed until Butler feeds her a hallucinogenic drug, which forces the Martian spirit to leave her body.\nThe group are forced to flee as the possessed workers breach the jail, leaving only Ballard, Desolation, Butler, Kincaid and Whitlock left alive. While they are able to make it to the train, Ballard realizes that they have a duty to exterminate the Martian threat and decide to return to Shining Canyon to overload the outpost's nuclear power plant, assuming that the ensuing atomic blast will vaporize the spirits. While they are able to initiate the meltdown, Whitlock is possessed, while Butler, Kincaid and the two train operators are killed. Boarding the train, the two watch as the army is engulfed in the explosion. Desolation tends to Ballard's wounds. Unwilling to face the authorities, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and leaves. She moves to shoot him, but realizes her respect for him and lets him make his escape.\nResting after her tribunal, Ballard is woken by an alert that the city is under attack.

They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the men's camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured but they don't reveal the plot.

He removes her from the chamber and after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer, takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her.

What she does not know is that Carter and Morgan are undercover FBI agents.\nAlan throws the game, gives his parents the money, and then undergoes a psychedelic experience after he ingests a big dose of LSD, 15,000 micrograms.

Jay plans to study art at Peterson and he's prepared a presentation that he hopes will earn him the scholarship. The headmaster of Columbus and Ronny's father, Ward Van Dusen, confiscates Jay's presentation notecards because they contained drawings depicting him as a wolf in disguise. After Ward leaves the notecards lying around his office, Ronny copies the presentation and wins the scholarship by using it in the contest.

When the Van Dusens return home, they find their maid shaken up and Camille missing, and based on the maid's recount of seeing a disguised Jay leave the pool house, they believe she has been dognapped.

After traveling through interstellar space, the vessel is drawn towards an unidentified ice planet where it lands automatically in a crater. The planet has a breathable atmosphere and earth-like gravity, but an unknown force field keeps the Magellan and the 1426 refugees on board trapped on the surface. The planet's orbit is also highly unusual, resembling that of a spacecraft rather than a planet. It is located so far from Earth even the Andromeda Galaxy is not visible in the sky. The Magellan is stranded and its crew has to cope with the fact that returning to Earth is impossible.\nRumla now reveals to the astonished crew that six years previously, a meteor crashed into a remote area of Sumatra. The meteor contained an extremely old and heat resistant crystal, named \"ICE-13\" by Earth scientists who discover an encryption in the crystallized structure itself. Rumla managed to crack the code and discovered that it contained specifications for the construction of an advanced space vessel.

During the montage, a title card appears that says:\n\nFrom 1930 to 1961, General Rafael Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo held absolute control of the Dominican Republic.\nHis secret alliance with the church, aristocrats, intellectuals and the press were the foundation of his dictatorship.\nHis formula to remain in power was simple: murder anyone who opposed him.\nMore than 30,000 people were executed during his regime of terror...The scene shifts to a prison cell, where one of his victims, Minerva Mirabal (Salma Hayek), recounts the events of the story.\nMinerva and her three sisters, Patria (Lumi Cavazos), Ded\u00e9 (Pilar Padilla), and Mar\u00eda Teresa \"Mat\u00e9\" (M\u00eda Maestro), live on a farm in rural Ojo De Agua. Minerva, the outspoken sister, convinces her father, Enrique Mirabal (Fernando Becerril), to send her, Patria, and Mat\u00e9 to a boarding school. The sisters spend five years away at school, during which time Minerva captures the attention of Trujillo (Edward James Olmos), who notices her at a school play.\nWhen school is over, Minerva wishes to study to become a lawyer, but women are not allowed in law school. The sisters return to the farm, and Minerva soon meets and falls in love with Virgilio \"Lio\" (Marc Anthony), a member of the Dominican resistance, who gives her the nickname \"Butterfly\", or Mariposa in Spanish. Lio's activities during a college protest are noticed, and he is forced to leave the country out of fear for his life, though he continues to write to Minerva.\nMinerva, along with her family, is invited to a formal ball at Trujillo's palace, where she dances with him. During their dance, Minerva asks for permission to attend law school, but Trujillo declines. He grabs Minerva inappropriately, and she responds by recoiling and slapping him in the face. Her family quickly rushes to her side, and Trujillo allows them to leave. The next day, the chief of police, Captain Pe\u00f1a (Pedro Armend\u00e1riz, Jr.), arrives at the family farm and takes Minerva's father away. The sisters spend several weeks dealing with the police bureaucracy, trying to locate their father, before it's suggested that there is a way Minerva can get her father out of prison. Minerva goes to the palace, and Trujillo suggests that her father can leave if she stays. Minerva points out that her mother is waiting outside and would \"appreciate his hospitality\" too. Trujillo decides that they should leave it to chance (a dice roll) to determine if Minerva and her family go free, or if Minerva stays at the palace while her family is released. Minerva accepts, but asks to \"up the stakes\"\u2014if she wins, she goes free and also gets to attend law school, and if she loses, Trujillo can \"have his wish\". She rolls the dice and wins, and Trujillo lets her leave.\nMinerva's victory is hollow. Her father is released from prison, but has been tortured and soon dies. While attending his funeral, the police chief delivers to Minerva a letter permitting her to attend law school. Minerva's hatred of Trujillo is intense, but she decides to accept his \"gift\" because she views it as her only way to effectively oppose him.\nWhile in law school, Minerva discovers that Lio has been killed by Trujillo supporters even though he was out of the country. She meets other members of the resistance, who, through Lio, know of her as \"Butterfly\". She becomes a member of the resistance, and over time Patria and Mat\u00e9 learn of her activities and become involved too. She falls in love with Manolo Tav\u00e1rez (Demi\u00e1n Bichir), a fellow law student and member of the resistance, and they are married.\nWhen Minerva graduates from law school, Trujillo is present to pass out the diplomas. All the other students receive diplomas, but he refuses to give Minerva hers, saying he agreed to allow her to attend law school, not to practice law.\nAfter law school, Minerva has children but continues her resistance activities. After a series of increasingly dangerous events, she, Mat\u00e9, and many resistance members are arrested and sent to jail. Minerva becomes a symbol, and many prisoners, guards, and outsiders secretly voice their support for \"the Butterflies\".\nEventually, Minerva and Mat\u00e9 are released from jail, but their husbands and Patria's are still held captive. The women continue their efforts to locate their husbands. Trujillo stops by to visit Minerva at her home, and she asks for his help to get their husbands released. Trujillo vows to help Minerva \"end her troubles\".\nWhile returning from a trip to visit their husbands, Minerva, Patria, and Mat\u00e9 are stopped on the road by a large group of Trujillo's men. They are taken some distance off the main road, and the men surround them and beat them to death.\nAnother title card appears at the end that says:\n\nThe Death of the Mirabal Sisters was the final blow to the regime of Le\u00f3nidas Trujillo, who was assassinated six months later.\nSeveral of the children of the Mirabal sisters held important posts in the later democratic governments of the Dominican Republic.\nThe day of the sisters' death, November 25th, is observed in many Latin American countries as the International Day Against Violence Towards Women.", "tmdb_id": 21997}, "31199884": {"title": "Indian (2001 film)", "plot": "Raj Shekhar Azad, an honest DCP whose sole intention is to wipe out corruption, emerged unflinching patriotism from his name to aim.

There, he met Brandy and her dog, Charlie, and became a target for jealousy from Robby, the town bully.\nAfter Brandy's alcoholic father shoots Charlie dead, Joe decides to try to find his parents. He details his adventures across the country including his friendship with Kickin' Wing, an unsuccessful Native American fireworks salesman. In Indiana, Joe has an encounter with a serial killer named Buffalo Bob, who is parodying the lotion scene from The Silence of the Lambs. This brings him unwanted attention from the media, but helps his search. In Louisiana at a high school, he was a janitor working with Clem Doore, a former mobster in the Witness Protection Program. Clem rescues students after a mustard gas explosion and informs the media Joe was the hero. While traveling on further he came across an alligator farm and met the owner Charlene. Looking to make money he was hired to be an Alligator wrangler for audiences. After one encounter with an Alligator in which he landed wrong, he had an epiphany about his little sister yelling at Joe about why his last name was Dirt and not his real surname Nunamaker. Upon realizing his real last name, this helps Joe discover the address of his old family home and he travels to Baton Rouge only to find that they moved away many years prior.\nListening to Joe's story, both Zander and the radio audience initially find him an object of scorn, but Joe's kindness and optimistic outlook on life win them over.\nEventually, Joe lands the janitorial job at the radio station, where he recounts how he gave up the search and returned to Silvertown to be with Brandy. However, Robby informed him that he and Brandy are getting married and that she found Joe's parents, but instructed him not to tell Joe. Zander calls Brandy to find out why, and she tells Joe his parents were killed the day they were at the Grand Canyon; she pleads with Joe to return to Silvertown. Upset by the news, Joe stays in Los Angeles.\nJoe is unaware that he has become a media sensation, but he quickly discovers his newfound fame. An appearance on TRL results in a phone call from a woman claiming to be Joe's mother. Joe meets his parents and he discovers that they intentionally abandoned him, and that they only reconnected with him in order to boost their sales of clown figurines. Joe storms out, cutting ties with his parents. He intends to commit suicide, but Brandy arrives and finally admits that she lied to him about his parents being dead because she had to protect him from them and their greed after she found out what horrible people they were. Brandy expresses her love and convinces Joe to come home with her but he suffers a head injury after a police officer lassos and accidentally causes him to fall off a bridge hitting his head while springing back up.\nJoe wakes up in Brandy's house, surrounded by his friends: Kickin' Wing, who reveals that thanks to Joe he now owns 30 successful firework stands, Clem (who is now under the name of Gert B. Frobe) and Charlene (now without a thumb and middle finger on her left hand), who are now engaged. Brandy reveals that she got Joe a dreadlock wig following his head operation, has retrieved his Hemi, and she has a new dog that Charlie fathered.\nAs they prepare to take a ride in Joe's Hemi, Robby arrives and tells Joe that no one wants him in Silvertown. Clem threatens Robby and exclaims that they are Joe's family. Robby challenges Joe to a race and Joe leaves him in the dust as Robby's car malfunctions and breaks down.

In the bus he meets R Sundarrajan. Sundarrajan tricks Pandiarajan into staying awake for the entire duration of the bus's overnight travel time whereas Sundarrajan peacefully sleeps. Sundarrajan irritates him even more by saying the next time Pandiarajan takes a bus ride he should inform Sundarrajan, so that Sundarrajan can again use Pandiarajan as an unpaid guard for his belongings. Pandiarajan joins the company and to his surprise he finds Sundarrajan to be one of the Watchmen at the company. Pandiarajan takes revenge by assigning Sundarrajan to night duty for three winter months.\nPandiarajan then finds a rental house. He reduces the rent to a very low amount by convincing the house owner by telling him that he would help out in menial household tasks and work for free for a few hours in the owner's cycle repair shop.\nPandiarajan also meets Sangeetha, the heroine, who lives in the house opposite to his. He promptly falls in love with her. He tries to get the local petty shop owner Manivannan to introduce him to Sangeetha. Manivannan calls Sangeetha to the shop and introduces Pandiarajan to her. Just before he shakes her hand, he sees an old man get into an accident with his scooter. A small kid falls in front of the scooter and falls down. Pandiarajan wanting to make a good first impression, slaps the old man. But the man turns out to be the Sangeetha's father. Sangeetha understandably gets very upset and scolds Pandiarajan.\nThe next day Pandiarajan explains to Manivannan how he couldn't have guessed how the guy who he hit could be the heroine's father. He reasons the man was so ugly looking like coal and the heroine was so beautiful looking like Bangalore tomatoes and there was no way the man could be her father. Unbeknownst to him the heroine is actually standing behind Pandiarajan when he says this. Now she gets very angry as he has questioned her Patrentage.\nTo add to Pandiarajan's woes further, his grandma arrives from the village and upon hearing Pandiarajan's love troubles decides to take matters in her own hand. Since her eyesight is not good, she misunderstands the heroine's mother to be the heroine and asks the mother to marry Pandiarajan. This also irritates the heroine.\nAnother parallel thread is how a group of inept rowdies think Pandiarajan as a big shot and claims him to be their leader when Pandiarajan gets drunk and unwittingly beats up a big local rowdy. His association with these rowdies also irritates the heroine.\nBecause Pandiarajan couldn't make a direct good impression on her, he tries to help her anonymously. Every time she faces a monetary problem Pandiarajan takes money from his savings and spends it for her. He even spends his savings for his grandma's eye surgery on the heroine's needs such as her college fees.\nNow enters Karan. Since Pandiarajan pays very less amount as rent, the house owner forces Pandiarajan to take upon Karan as roommate. Karan is a fraud. He steals Pandiarajan's certificates and secures a job. He also sees Sangeetha and tries to woo her. He impresses Sangeetha and her parents too. Whatever bad Karan does, it falls on Pandiarajan, bringing his respect and name even more down with the heroine. Whatever good Pandiarajan does, it seems like Sangeetha misunderstands it and thinks the good is done by Karan.\nR Sundarrajan actually turns out to be Sangeetha's uncle. Sundarrajan discovers that Pandiarajan is in love with Sangeetha. He makes Pandiarajan make him the day shift Watchman again. He also uses Pandiarajan to get money, eat at high class restaurants and other benefits. Pandiarajan begrudgingly allows all this so that Sundarrajan could get Sangeetha fall in love with him. But these efforts also fail.\nWhen Pandiarajan almost gives up on his love, luck comes in the form of the comedic rowdy gang who adopted Pandiarajan as their leader. They want to show some gratitude as Pandiarajan beating up the old big don has boosted the revenues for these small time rowdies. But they also mistakenly think Pandiarajan loves Sangeetha's mother and so they kidnap her. Pandiarajan mentions that he actually loves the daughter. The rowdies again kidnap Sangeetha. Upon hearing this, all the people in Pandiarajan's housing colony tries to rescue the two women from the clutches of the inept rowdies in their customary rundown factory which they use for kidnapping and other illegal activities. Karan uses this confusion to try to marry Sangeetha but she refuses and opens up the truth. She actually loved Pandiarajan all along and she knew all the good things were done by him. She also knew Karan was undeservingly taking the credit due for Pandiarajan. She wanted Pandiarajan to come out of his shyness, insecurities and confidence issues to propose to her. For that reason she irritated Pandiarajan by her friendship with Karan. She basically had used Karan to get Pandiarajan out of his shell. Karan, obviously as a villain, tries to force her into marrying him. Pandiarajan, upon hearing the heroine's admission of love, gets confidence and beats up Karan and saves Sangeetha.

He has created a design for a primitive elevator, and has built a small model of this device. His strict Uncle Millard has no patience for what he sees as Leopold's frivolous interest in the sciences and new inventions, having brought him to New York City in order to marry a wealthy American heiress, as the Mountbatten family is heavily indebted.\nWhile sketching the Brooklyn Bridge during a public meeting dedicated to the completion of its Manhattan tower, Leopold notices Stuart Besser taking photographs with an anachronistically small camera. Stuart is an amateur physicist (and great\u2011great\u2011grandson of Leopold) from 21st\u2011century New York who has discovered the existence of gravitational time portals. Later, Leopold catches Stuart in the Duke's study, photographing his schematic diagrams. When Stuart attempts to flee, Leopold follows and tries to save him from falling off the unfinished bridge, only to fall with him into the time portal.\nLeopold awakens on a Wednesday morning in the year 2001 in Stuart's apartment at 88 White Street, Manhattan. Stuart explains that the portal they have travelled through has closed, but will reopen on the next Monday, until which time Leopold should stay in Stuart's apartment. As Stuart takes his dog out, he is injured by falling into the empty elevator shaft and, after ranting about his scientific discovery in the hospital, is involuntarily committed to a mental institution. According to Stuart's concept, Leopold's unintentional time travel to the 21st century has caused a widespread \"occlusion\" of elevators, and may cause the disappearance of Stuart himself if Leopold doesn't go back to 1876 on Monday.\nLeopold is intrigued by the cynical and ambitious Kate McKay, Stuart's ex-girlfriend who lives downstairs. He says that she produces the impression of a \"career woman\" and, upon learning that she works in market research, ironically remarks, \"Mm. A fine avocation for women, research. Perfect for the feminine mind.\" (Later on, Kate's boss tells her the same thing, \"You skew male. You're like a man. A man who understands women\u2014their desires, their needs. You understand them but you're not really one of them.\") Kate shrugs it off and demands that Leopold take Stuart's dog for a walk. Back at the apartment, he befriends Charlie\u2014Kate's brother and an aspiring actor, who believes him to be an actor as well, steadfast to his character.\nOn Thursday morning, Kate becomes impressed by Leopold's eloquent exposition of how important the tastiness of food is to the quality of human life. She takes him to an audition for a TV commercial pitching a fat-free butter, Farmer's Bounty, produced by the English company Jansen Foods, which is being taken over by Kate's company, Camden Research Group. After the successful audition, Kate and Leopold stop by a horse-drawn tourist carriage to hail a taxi, at which moment a thief snatches Kate's briefcase and flees into Central Park. Seeing Kate run after the purse-snatcher, Leopold borrows one of the horses and hurries to help her. Riding together with Kate, he drives the thief into an impasse and forces him to drop the briefcase. Bedazzled by the sight of Leopold riding on a white horse to her rescue, Kate begins to admit that his 19th century dukedom may be \"for real\".\nOn Friday, Leopold hires a violinist and invites Kate to a rooftop dinner, which ends with a waltz and the first kiss.\nOn Saturday, they take a stroll about Lower Manhattan and come across Uncle Millard's home at 1 Hanover Square, where Leopold retrieves a metal box with his boyhood treasures, including his mother's ring, from a secret drawer hidden in his room's wall. In the evening, he tries to propose to Kate, but she falls asleep on his lap.\nOn Sunday, Leopold acts in a Farmer's Bounty commercial, but walks off the set upon finding the diet margarine disgusting. Leopold chastises Kate about integrity, to which she counters that he lacks connection with reality. Realizing that their time together is nearly over, both spend the evening in subdued contemplation.\nOn Monday morning, Stuart escapes from the asylum and sends Leopold to his own time, which makes the elevators work again. Charlie notices Kate in a photo taken at Leopold's ball on 28 April 1876, and shows the picture to Stuart, who realizes that Kate's future is in the past. That night, when Kate is about to accept her promotion at the Anglo-American merger meeting held, to her surprise, at 1 Hanover Square, Stuart and Charlie tell her that in order to be with Leopold she has to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge within the next 23 minutes. Kate rejects their suggestion as absurd and goes to give her acceptance speech, during which she sees herself, wearing the same evening dress, in one of Stuart's photos. She abruptly ends the speech, and the three of them rush to the bridge.\nHaving made it through the portal, Kate appears in 1876 and runs to 1 Hanover Square, where the Anglo-American engagement is to take place. Just when Leopold is about to announce his bride of convenience, Kate storms into the ballroom, and he instead announces her name, styled as \"Kate McKay, of the McKays of Massapequa\".

With one more pass, he could have won the tournament. Destitute, William wears Sir Ector's armour to impersonate him, taking the prize.\nAlthough only nobles are allowed in tournaments, William is inspired to compete and win more prizes. Roland and Wat would rather take their winnings and leave, but William convinces them to stay and help him train. While traveling, they encounter a young Geoffrey Chaucer, who is also destitute and agrees to forge a patent of nobility so William can enter, assuming the name of \"Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein\" from Gelderland. But William is brought before Simon the Summoner and Peter the Pardoner: Chaucer has a gambling problem and is in their debt. William demands Chaucer be released and promises payment.\nDuring the competition, William's armour is badly damaged; he goads Kate, a female blacksmith, into repairing it without payment. He wins the tournament's sword event, enabling him to pay Chaucer's debt. In the joust, he faces Sir Thomas Colville, who withdraws from the tournament after being injured by William, though they exchange a ceremonial pass so that Colville can retain the honour of never having failed to complete a match. The proceedings are observed by Jocelyn, a noblewoman with whom William has become infatuated, and Count Adhemar of Anjou, a rival both in the joust and for Jocelyn's heart. In the final joust, Adhemar defeats William. William vows revenge, but Adhemar taunts him, \"You have been weighed, you have been measured, and you have been found wanting.\"\nKate joins William's party and forges new lightweight armour. In the following tournament, Adhemar and William are both assigned to tilt against Sir Thomas Colville, but they learn that he is actually Prince Edward, the future King of England. Unwilling to risk harming him, Adhemar withdraws; but William chooses to joust against Edward anyway and then addresses him by name, further earning his respect.\nAdhemar is called away to the Battle of Poitiers, and William achieves several victories in his absence. William proves his love for Jocelyn by complying when she first asks him to deliberately lose (in contrast to knights who promise to win \"in her name\"), and then, just before he would be eliminated, to win the tournament after all.\nThe group travels to London for the World Championship. William recalls leaving his father to squire for Sir Ector and learn to become a knight, hoping to \"change his stars\". Adhemar has also arrived in London and announces that he is in negotiations with Jocelyn's father for her hand in marriage. William dominates at the tournament, but is seen visiting his now-blind father. Adhemar alerts the authorities to William's true identity.\nWilliam is arrested and placed in the pillory, but is defended from the hostile crowd by his friends. Just as the mob reaches its frenzy, Prince Edward reveals himself. He acknowledges William's honour and an ability to inspire his friends' dedication that is in the best traditions of knighthood. Edward then announces that William is in fact descended from an ancient noble family, and knights him \"Sir William\". He asserts that as Prince-royal, his declaration is \"beyond contestation\".\nWilliam returns to the tournament to face Adhemar in the final match, but Adhemar cheats with an illegally sharpened lance, seriously injuring William. Entering the final pass, William is losing by two lances and must unhorse Adhemar to win. He demands to be stripped of his armour while Chaucer buys time by performing the introduction of William that he omitted earlier. William, unable to hold the lance due to his injuries, asks Wat to strap it to his arm. Finally, he tilts against Adhemar, with his father and Jocelyn in attendance. Bellowing his true name as he charges, he knocks Adhemar to the ground with a crushing blow; Adhemar experiences a vision of William and his friends mockingly telling him that he has been \"weighed, measured, and found wanting\".

The night they spent together was not only a sexual, but also an emotional awakening, for the boy.  While Lan Yu immediately fell in love with Chen Handong, the older man, who was very closeted, wanted no emotional relationship, only sex.  He tried his best to avoid any attachment whatsoever with the youth, instead he showered Lan Yu with money and expensive gifts.  His efforts to turn Lan Yu's love for him into a dependent, loveless relationship failed until Lan Yu discovered Chen in the middle of the seduction of a young college athlete.  Crushed, Lan Yu left Chen's apartment.  They would not meet again until 4 June 1989, when Chen went looking for Lan Yu, fearing for the youth's safety amid the army's Tiananmen Square crackdown.

With his father dead and no longer able to protect him, Chen Handong faced a long prison term, if not execution.  Lan Yu took his savings and the proceeds of the sale of his villa and all of Chen's other gifts and raised enough funds to get Chen Handong out of legal and financial trouble.

Seventy-four years old, Queen Joanna of Castile, called Juana la Loca (Joanna the Madwoman), is still mourning the loss of her husband who died a half century before. Joanna remembers with emotion the man she loved passionately, but who brought her ruin. She does not fear death, she says, because death would allow her to be reunited with her husband. Their story goes back almost 60 years.\nIn 1496, Joanna, the third child of the Catholic Monarchs Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, is leaving Spain through the port of Laredo. She is headed to Flanders to marry the Archduke of Austria, Philip, nicknamed the Handsome, a man she has never laid eyes on. The marriage has been arranged for political purposes. Joanna's siblings and her mother, Queen Isabella, bid her farewell.\nOnce in Flanders, Joanna, young and inexperienced, is immediately smitten by her handsome fianc\u00e9. He is equally pleased with his beautiful bride and orders the marriage to take place at that very moment so they can consummate their marriage without any delay. Their union is initially a great success. The political alliance between their two countries has been consolidated and Joanna and Philip are very attracted to each other. With his good looks and bed manners, Philip completely captivates his wife. Their passionate love making soon produces results. Joanna has a daughter, followed shortly after by a son. \nThis combination of love, lust and emotional dependency make the passionate Joanna deeply attached to her husband. Her love becomes consuming, but the intensity of her passion turns Philip away. He is a restless man who finds entertainment in going hunting and in the arms of other women. The deaths of Joanna's brother, the stillbirth of her brother's daughter, her older sister's death and her sister's son's death unexpectedly make her heir of the Castilian and Aragones crowns. However, she is not interested in government. Obsessed with her husband, Joanna surprises him in bed with a lover, who Joanna later successfully identifies as In\u00e9s de Brabante, one of the court ladies. In a fit of jealousy, Joanna cuts the hair of her rival. While Joanna despairs at her husband\u2019s unfaithfulness, she receives further bad news. Her mother has died. Joanna thus becomes Queen of Castile and has to return to her kingdom. Her tantrums over her husband\u2019s infidelities have made her start to become known as Joanna the Mad.\nAt the Castilian court in Burgos, the Queen is happily greeted by her subjects, but her marital life is still in turmoil. Philip is soon bewitched by the charms and spells of Aixa, a Moorish prostitute who uses her sexual attraction and black magic to secure Philip's favour. With this new lover, the King becomes noticeably indifferent toward his wife, which adds to her increasingly insane jealousy.\nAgainst the background of this troubled marriage, there are two opposed political parties at court, one Flemish, the other Castilian. The conspiring Flemish usurpers are headed by Se\u00f1or de Veyre, Philip's right-hand man. Their objective is to have Joanna declared insane and for Philip to take power away from her. Joanna has her own set of supporters, the loyal Castilian royalists, headed by the Admiral of Castile. The Admiral and the Queen's friend and confidant, Elvira, try unsuccessfully to rescue Juana from her marital obsessions.\nHowever, it is not the government that is on the Queen's mind; she is fixated on retaining her husband\u2019s love. To avoid any temptations at court, she hires only ugly-looking maids of honour to serve her, but in fact Aixa has been brought to court by Philip, passing as one of the court ladies under the name of Beatriz de Bobadilla. Unaware of this, the Queen relies on Beatriz to find a spell to help her retain her husband's love. Joanna is equally misguided in her attempt to regain Philip's attention by simulating a love affair with Captain \u00c1lvaro de Est\u00fa\u00f1iga, a close friend from her childhood. The Queen\u2019s lack of control permits the manipulation of her enemies to have her declared incompetent to rule. The King, encouraged by Se\u00f1or de Veyre, resolves to take the rule of the kingdom for himself and shove Joanna out of the way. He finds an unlikely ally in Joanna's own father, king Fernando, who has remarried and has no further interest in either the fate of his daughter or in the kingdom of Castile.\nWhile her fate is decided at a court assembly, Joanna is able to successfully make her case, counting on the unquestionable support of her subjects. However, her powerful speech coincides with Philip falling gravely ill. Although she devotedly takes care of her husband, the doctors are unable to do anything for him. On his death bed, Philip apologises to his wife for his past excesses. After the death of her husband Joanna, heavily pregnant, takes on a long journey to the south of the country to bury her husband. She does not go far.

The team later take part in an open-top bus parade but the driver accidentally takes them the wrong way and they end up going down a motorway leaving the entire team windswept before returning to the city centre to finish the parade. Away from Norwich, it is reported in the papers that England manager Phil Cope has suffered a heart attack during qualification for the World Cup, which started out well but has since gone badly wrong.\nThe heads of the Football Association meet to decide who should be the new England manager. After phoning around Italy, France and Spain they conclude that nobody wants the job and are forced to look for a new coach in England but cannot decide on who should take the role. The most successful Premier League manager is Scottish (based on Sir Alex Ferguson), while the second-most successful is a former England captain who is interested in the job, but the FA decide that he is too much of a \"loudmouth\" and refuse to consider him (a reference to the numerous times Brian Clough was passed over for the England job). None of the other English managers in the Premier League are interested, forcing the FA to look to Division One for a new manager, with the press speculating that Mike Bassett may be the new man for the job. Mike lives at home with his wife Karine and son, Jason. He is described as a former professional footballer who played for Doncaster Rovers, Darlington, Hull City and Grimsby Town.\nWhen the press turn up at Mike's house to question him about the job he initially denies the speculation until his son Jason appears with a phone to tell him he's got the job. Bassett takes over the England team and moves to appoint his coaching staff, namely assistant manager turned car salesman Lonnie Urquart (Philip Jackson) who is not interested unless Mike buys a car from him, and coach Dave Dodds (Bradley Walsh) who is a sycophantic yes man who once managed with Mike at Colchester United (a reference to Phil Neal under the Graham Taylor era). The team need one win from three World Cup qualifiers to get to the World Cup finals in Brazil. Bassett travels north to meet Kevin Tonkinson (Dean Lennox Kelly), who he believes will win England the World Cup, but on arrival at the pub he finds Tonkinson laying drunk on a pool table with people pouring beer into his mouth. Once calmed down, Bassett tells him to clean up his act and if he can promise to do it then he will recall him to the squad.\nBassett takes his first training session at Bisham Abbey ahead of his first game at Wembley Stadium against Poland. He selects an old-fashioned 4\u20134\u20132 formation and writes his team sheets on the back of an old cigarette packet. During the game, Tonkinson opens the scoring with a dink shot over the keeper, but Poland soon begin to put pressure on and eventually equalise before going on to win the game 2\u20131. Bassett is criticised by the media for the formation he played and the tactics used. Meanwhile, some of his players anonymously state to an interviewer that they have doubts about Bassett's credibility to lead the team. Bassett sits his coaching staff down to review the game but Doddsy's wife has taped Ground Force over the recording. In an attempt to improve the team's mental and psychological wellbeing, they visit a sports science institute but half the team are injured in the process, leaving Bassett with selection issues over his next game against Belgium. In a mix-up, his secretary accidentally calls up to the squad two players called Benson and Hedges, aging players who are playing in the Third Division. When querying who they are, Mike realises she has mistaken the brand of cigarettes Benson and Hedges as the names of players. Bassett is mocked in a press conference but claims he called them up intentionally. England lose the game 3\u20130, leading to pressure being placed on his family by angry supporters.\nFor the last qualification game, England need to beat Slovenia in order to qualify and with Tonkinson missing due to a drunken car crash, they struggle to a 0\u20130 draw in which captain Gary Wackett (Geoff Bell) is sent off and Rufus Smalls (Robbie Gee) misses a penalty. After the game, they learn that Luxembourg have beaten Turkey 2\u20130 which sees them go through on goal difference. The team head off to record the official England World Cup song with girl group Atomic Kitten and \"hellraiser\" Keith Allen.\nEngland travel to Brazil for the finals but on arriving at the airport they start brawling with the Scottish and Irish teams. A difficult group stage sees them on the verge of heading home after they can only manage a goalless draw with unfancied Egypt before losing 4\u20130 to Mexico. To make matters worse, Bassett receives a phone call from Karine at home in England, informing him that Jason was bullied at school for the Egypt draw, resulting in his eyebrows being shaved off. One of England's training sessions is ruined after Urquart locks the footballs in his Opel and goes shopping. Wackett is then sent home for taking part in hooliganism and Tonkinson accidentally gets involved in a drunken tryst with a transsexual and is also booted from the team. During a team meeting the next morning, Urquart begins to praise the Mexicans by getting the English players to cheer \"three cheers for Ramirez\"; this angers Mike, who proclaims \"We're England\", saying that the country hates him and that his wife is about to leave him. Urquart, unhappy with Mike's tone, asks him to get more off his chest, which leads to Mike calling him a small-minded bigot and criticising the car he bought from him. Urquart reacts by punching him in the nose and is effectively sacked from the team instantly. Later that night, Tonkinson is reconciled with Bassett and the two share a drink, which leads to them dancing drunkenly on a bar top. When Lightfoot gets on the bar to coerce Mike down, the pair both fall off in full view of the local press.\nThe morning after his drunken incident, Bassett is involved in a press conference at which he is expected to step down from the managerial position. When he announces that he is carrying on, the press begin to get hostile and Bassett responds by reciting of \"If\u2014\" by Rudyard Kipling, which he finishes by saying that \"England will be playing 4\u20134\u2013fucking\u20132\" and storms out. Following this, England need to beat Argentina to get through to the second round. Reporter Tommo (Phill Jupitus) proclaims that if England win he will quit his job and become a bin man. In a close game in which England are the better team, they eventually succeed when Tonkinson dribbles past the Argentinian defence and blasts a shot that deflects off the crossbar. Tonkinson then punches the ball into the net \u2013 a reference to the hand of God goal from Argentina's Diego Maradona which helped to knock England out of the 1986 World Cup. As the full-time whistle sounds and the England team celebrate, Bassett heads down the tunnel telling Doddsy he's going to call his wife.\nIt is later seen in a series of newspaper articles that England advanced to the knock-out stages, where they beat Romania and France, with Rufus Smalls breaking his goal drought and scoring a hat-trick against Romania to become England's top goalscorer, with 52 international goals. They eventually lost to host nation Brazil in the semi-finals. Tommo Thompson is also seen briefly working as a binman following his statement during the final press conference. On their plane journey back to Britain, Bashir says to Bassett that England had equalled their best performance since they won in 1966 (in 1990, England finished fourth). Bassett replies that he is ready to move aside and let somebody else take the job. As the plane doors open at the airport, the team depart to a cheering crowd, where a surprised but happy Bassett confirms to the waiting press that he will remain as manager.", "tmdb_id": 19962}, "47585814": {"title": "The Milk of Human Kindness (film)", "plot": "Christelle, a mother, disappears without a trace.", "tmdb_id": 57945}, "829780": {"title": "Millennium Actress", "plot": "Ginei Studios, a prestigious but bankrupt film studio, goes out of business.

After having eliminated the Grey-Pink Man, accused to be a traitor, the President of the Gray Men gives the order to capture Momo, who manages to escape from them thanks to Cassiopea, who leads her to a magical place. Momo is welcomed into the home of Master Hora, who controls time assisted by his faithful helpers, the time of day and the time of night, under the guise of a Rooster and an Owl.\nMaster Hora unveils to Momo the true nature of the Gray Men and the secret place where time lives. Momo listens to the Music of Light, a song that can break the spell of the Grey Men and free everyone, but the wise Master Hora tells her that it takes time for her to internalize the music, she has to sleep on it. Momo then goes to sleep, but meanwhile, the quiet town on Earth has turned into a huge metropolis. Poor Beppo, destroyed by the disappearance of Momo, is arrested and kept into an asylum after he tried to denounce the Grey Men to the authorities, and Gigi, who is hired by television, is threatened with dismissal if he keeps looking for Momo.\nWhen Master Hora wakes up Momo, the town seems to be lost, but there is a way to save it: stop time. Master Hora can stop time by falling asleep, but only for an hour. The Grey Men steal the hours from the people and turn them into cigars that must smoke continuously, in order to avoid disappearing. If time stops, they can no longer steal hours and will eventually dissolve all. Unfortunately, the evil Grey Men have a reserve of cigars in their Bank and, as long as they can access them, they have enough cigars to survive until the awakening of Hora; Momo should, therefore, be able to keep them away from storage the necessary time. The girl faces the great challenge, helped by Cassiopeia, and manages with purity of soul and kindness to defeat all the Grey Men, freeing all her friends. The town is saved and the sweet Momo can finally re-embrace Beppo; Gigi returns to what it once was and Momo will live happily ever after with her friends.

Soon, the necklace is passed. And it's not even real gold.\nThe old jailer picks up the story, saying the prisoner is a boy named Pan from his home village. Pan is a simple country boy. In the words of the jailer, he thinks about entertainment too much and is not respectful enough of his elders. In other words, he's not too bright. Yet, he is a good singer, and the story flashes back to a village fair, where he's up on stage singing his heart out, with his lyrics being composed on the spot and directed toward Sadao, a pretty village girl who is dancing in the crowd.\nA local rich kid pulls up in his truck and asks Sadao to dance. Then, when the rich kid goes to the drinks stand, Pan hands his microphone over to another performer and moves to dance with Sadao. The rich kid returns, and Pan bumps into him, spilling the drinks. The rich guy, with his thuggish friends in tow, orders Pan to clean up the mess. Pan does so by spitting on the guy's shoes. A fight breaks out, but the music keeps going, with a guitarist picking up the beat and screaming a punk song as the fight intensifies.\nPan and Sadao retreat to Sadao's home, where Pan breaks into another song, expressing his love. But before long, Sadao's irascible father shows up with a shotgun, causing Pan to jump into the river to escape the shotgun blasts.\nPan is not easily deterred. Via his sister, he sends Sadao a pretty blue blouse, accompanied by a love note. He then shows up one day to dig a pond for Sadao's father, explaining that the man Sadao's father had originally hired was sick. He insists on calling the man Dad.\n\"Stop calling me Dad. When did I fuck your mother,\" the old man cruelly admonishes Pan.\nThe old man is complaining of various aches and pains. Pan offers to get him some folk medicine, something involving foot pollen, which because of the cultural association of the foot being the basest part of the body, gravely offends him. Pan is back in the doghouse with Sadao's father.\nYet the two become married. For a present, Pan presents Sadao with a new transistor radio. They have a baby on the way and they enjoy being together.\n\"The movie could end here,\" the narrator chimes in, \"and you'd be heading for exits with a happy ending. But there is more to this sad tale.\"\nPan's run of bad luck starts when he draws the wrong number in the draft lottery and must enter the army. He heads off to basic training before his wife gives birth to their child. He promises to write her a letter every day.\nA musical interlude depicts Pan and the other soldiers singing the mournful song \"Mai Leum\" (\"Don't Forget) as they crawl on their backs in the mud under barbed wire, and during their haircuts.\nOne day Pan sees a poster for a singing contest and at the urging of his army buddies, he enters. He nervously gets up on stage and says he wants to sing \"The Sad Soldier\". The band doesn't know the tune, so Pan sings it a cappella. Though he wows the crowd, he faints onstage when the song is complete. Along with a local girl, Dao, Pan wins the contest and without giving thought to the consequences, he's on a bus headed for Bangkok, where he hopes to become a big singing star.\nHe ends up locked inside the music company's office, where he spends the night. The next day, he meets his new boss, a sleazy producer named Suwat, who insists Pan call him \"Daddy\". He lectures Pan about all the hard work he'll need to do before making it as a star.\nSo Pan pitches in around the office, mopping floors and running errands. Months go by. He mops the floor while the other singer who won the contest, Dao, receives training as a singer. Pan keeps mopping. Soon, 27 months have gone by.

He also becomes close with Dao, whom he assists one night after she becomes ill.\nFinally, one night at a show, Pan gets his big break when the star male singer doesn't show up. Pan is hastily thrown into a gold lame tuxedo and pushed onstage.\nWhat he doesn't know is that out in the crowd is Sadao and her father. They have finally tracked down Pan and have come to visit him. She's brought him bottles of rainwater from the village, figuring the water in the city is dirty and unfit to drink. Pan and Sadao enjoy a brief reunion after the show, but Pan is quickly whisked away by Suwat, to Suwat's home, which is decorated with animal skins.\nSuwat tells Pan to relax and goes to change. He comes out with some beers, wearing just a silk bathrobe and his underwear. Suwat puts on a porn tape \u2013 it's a film of the girl singer, Dao.

He's taken a liking to Sadao, giving her some medicine for her sick baby and inviting her to a movie screening that night. He further charms her at the screening, by demonstrating his talents as a film dubber, improvising lines to tell her how beautiful she is.\nBack on the sugar-cane plantation, the workers, tired of their diet of vegetables and rice, are restive. Pan has made friends with one of the workers, Siew, but Pan is also well liked by the tough boss, Yot. One night at a card game, Yot finds that Siew has won all his money. A fight breaks out. There is running through the jungle. Dead bodies are uncovered. The horror!

Siew snatches a woman's necklace, and, as she chases him, he passes it Pan, who is then chased by the police. Eventually Pan is caught, and this brings the story back to where it started in the jail.\nPan ends up serving two years in prison, where he and the other inmates work on the prison farm, fertilizing crops with their own feces and urine. While dipping a bucket into the sewage well, Pan falls in, and is covered in the brown substance.\nOn his release, Pan waits on the street for a ride. A truck pulls up. It is Siew, who is wearing a track suit and much jewelry and is carrying a cellular phone. With his hair dyed blond, he calls himself Peter and announces he is now a drug dealer, and has made quick money. And, to add more indignity to the situation, he's married a former singing star and porn actress - Dao.\nFinally, Pan returns to Sadao. She looks more careworn than ever. In addition to a little boy, there's an infant in a crib. \"Whose kid is that?\" Pan asks when he sees the younger baby. \"His father was a dog,\" she explains. \"They are all dogs.\" Pan looks around. A photo of Sadao's father is on the wall. He's died. The transistor radio lies in a corner, broken and covered with dust. The pretty blue blouse is faded and stained and crumpled on the floor in another corner.\nThere's a final musical reprise of \"Mai Leum\", with all the characters in the film putting in an appearance to sing the chorus.

A few days before the engagement, Tej Puri (Rajat Kapoor), Lalit's extremely wealthy brother-in-law, arrives from the U.S.. Tej is married to Lalit's sister and has helped the Verma family regain their financial footing after the Partition of India left them penniless many years ago.

Beautiful white doves  (symbolizing peace) also fly around in the foreground in idyllic slow motion while an audience is introduced to the local Mosque and its saintly Imam (priest) played by Abid Ali. The Imam completes his prayer and emerges from the distance as pigeons and doves flutter about in a mad frenzy.\nMeanwhile, we are shown that across the way there is a temple where instead of doves of peace, there is a python near a large group of snarling, drooling old men in orange robes, with funky hairstyles who are cringing at the voice of the nearby priest. So enraged are they by his voice that they hatch an evil scheme in collusion with the local godless firangi gora's (white men - who worship only money) to bring about the end to the voice once and for all.\nAs the villains try to gun down the lecturing Imam, their guns suddenly malfunction by divine intervention and when the ghastly Hindus decide to fire some heavy artillery and rocket launchers at the mosque (it appears divine intervention only disables rifles and pistols but not rocket launchers) the super-human maulvi appears magically leaping in the way of the projectiles, thwarting any attempt at desecrating the mosque. Then, while in the background people turn from peace mode to crusade mode, the Maulvi mumbles a few pious utterances and launches his \"tasbees\" (holy beads) into the air to see it transform in mid-air into a holy sword. He dramatically catches the falling blade and proceeds to hack to death the entire lot of goons who had dared to try to attack the mosque. As the Imam finally caves in, he says to his child Moosa, \"sorry Moosa\" the maulvi says in slow motion at the death scene, his eyes burning with the fire of vengeance.\nMoosa grows up in a cave somewhere, having turned his back on his religion due to the disillusionment that he felt when his father was murdered. He has instead taken to living alone in some distant cave with his horse Sheru to keep him company. Moosa (Shaan) has turned into a cold-hearted mercenary but all that is soon to change with Saima's arrival.\nShe shows up, dressed to kill with her father. He clearly had his own reasons for bringing his daughter to this place but when the goons start making moves on her, he turns defensive and starts throwing moralizing lecture, and for this he gets shot by one of the goons. Shamoon (Shafqat Cheema) sporting his usual bizarre \"get up\" with flowing ponytail becomes obsessed by Saima's voluptuousness, Shamoon imprisons Saima. However, in keeping with the film's utterly warped manner, Saima chooses to stab herself to death rather than to compromise her \"izzat\" (honour). Shamoon has her stitched up in the nick of time, yet she remains merely a captive pet for her tormentor, waiting for the first opportunity to flee. Saima is rescued from Shamoon's clutches one night by Moosa and whisked away to freedom, but just when she is beginning to take a fancy to her rescuer, it's revealed that all he intended to do was use her as part of a transaction or agreement. Saima is stunned when Moosa gives her over to another set of captors. Saima begs him not to do this, but he continues to walk away, stone faced and impassive. As Moosa is about to mount onto his horse and ride off into the distance, Saima comes up with an idea; she takes to covering her head with a scarf (in dramatic slow-motion) and starts reciting the words (with added echo effect) of the Quran in a last-ditch effort to get through to the stubborn Moosa. When Saima reaches a crescendo with the retort of \"Kya tum Moosa nahin ho\" (Are you not Moosa?) her words finally seem to hit the right spot and suddenly Moosa assumes the role that his father the saintly priest had always dreamed of.\nMoosa forcefully bludgeons his way through the fully armed opposition and rescues her again and makes away with Saima to the safety of the forest where they are joined by his childhood chum Jan Rambo. Love blossoms and Saima and Moosa get married and build their dream home away from the troubles of the world but Shamoon's henchmen are constantly searching every inch of the forest in order to recover Saima and destroy Moosa and it is a matter of time before they discover the mountainside home. Meanwhile, Saima gives birth to a child and forces her husband to bury his weapons and to take to praying for solace.\nOne fateful day, while the child and father are away hunting, Shamoon's horrible henchmen show up. There follows the usual bloodbath and mayhem as child and dad return to begin their fight. In one of the more hysterical scenes of the movie, we have Moosa performing his prayers when a goon with a huge machine gun arrives firing shot after shot at Moosa, but these giant bullets float in Matrix-like slow motion towards our hero and each time by divine intervention they somehow fail to hit their target. In a moment of sublime ridiculousness, Moosa in fact catches the last bullet in mid-air and tosses it aside disdainfully before striding out, (angels in full battle cry by now) to purge the land of all evil."}, "25944368": {"title": "Morgan's Ferry", "plot": "A trio of escaped criminals hide out in a woman's home as they wait to catch a ferry.", "tmdb_id": 95143}, "1515876": {"title": "Mostly Martha (film)", "plot": "Martha Klein (Martina Gedeck) is a chef at Lido, a gourmet restaurant in Hamburg, Germany.

Martha's therapy sessions, however, turn into monologues on food, and her approach to stress management usually involves briefly retreating to the restaurant's walk-in refrigerator.\nMartha's life takes a dramatic turn when her sister is killed in a car accident, leaving behind an eight-year-old daughter, Lina (Maxime Foerste). Martha must now look after her niece, who is understandably depressed, withdrawn, and refuses to eat. The girl's Italian father, Giuseppe Lorenzo, has been out of the picture for years, living somewhere in Italy. While coping with her sister's death and raising the young girl, Martha's world is further complicated when Frida hires fun-loving and unorthodox Mario (Sergio Castellitto) as a sous-chef to replace Lea (Katja Studt), who is expecting a child any day. Martha looks on in horror as Mario transforms her kitchen of precision and logistics with his relaxed banter and up-beat music.\nUnable to find an acceptable babysitter, Martha brings Lina to the restaurant with her. Lina begins to emerge from her depression in the presence of Mario's playfulness, and even begins to eat when Mario leaves her unattended with a plate of spaghetti he's prepared. Touched by Mario's kindness and concern for the child, Martha becomes more accepting of Mario. She even asks for his help in locating Lina's father in Italy and translating a letter she's written to him.\nJust as Martha's strained relationship with Lina seems to be improving, she forgets to collect the girl from school while helping Lea, her very-pregnant sous chef, get to the hospital to deliver her baby. Lina is angry at being forgotten at school, and the incident causes a serious setback in their relationship. To make amends, Martha offers to grant Lina any wish: Lina wants Mario to cook for them. Mario agrees, and prepares a picnic-style dinner in Martha's living room. Despite the mess left behind in the kitchen, the evening of food, stories, and games brings the three closer together.\nThe renewed warmth between Martha and Lina is immediately tested when Martha is told by the school principal that Lina has not been attending school regularly, and that when she does come to school, she falls asleep. The principal also tells Martha that when he asked the girl why she was always so tired, she told him that she was forced to work in a kitchen to earn her room and board. Angered by Lina's behavior, and also having been warned by the restaurant owner, Martha tells Lina that she can no longer come to the restaurant. Lina storms off, nearly getting hit by a car, and later attempts to run away to Italy. Mario continues to support Martha emotionally as their relationship becomes romantic.\nLina's father, in answer to Martha's letter, arrives to take his daughter to Italy to live with his wife and family. Distraught and conflicted by the separation, Martha rejects Mario's loving support, and after another confrontation with a customer, quits her job. Soon after, \nMartha asks Mario to accompany her to Italy to retrieve Lina. After reuniting with the girl, Martha and Mario marry, and the three begin their lives together as a loving family.", "tmdb_id": 3640}, "3520906": {"title": "Motocrossed", "plot": "The fast-moving Carson family gets ready to take on their next challenge as eldest son Andrew (Trever O'Brien) gears up for a motocross race with the hopes of winning a corporate sponsorship.\nTwin sister Andrea \"Andy\" Carson (Alana Austin) finds herself in a bind when her love for motocross racing provokes her overprotective father, Edward (Timothy Carhart), who is averse to the idea of his daughter participating in such a dangerous sport and prefers that she stick to \"girl things\". When their parents are out of the house for the day, Andrea and Andrew decide to have a friendly race on the family track. While racing, Andrew loses control of his bike, causing him to be thrown off and crash, injuring his knee which renders him unable to race in the Cup. Edward is forced to quit his job, dipping into the family's finances to find a replacement rider from Europe.\nFueled by her desire to get on the track and feeling guilty over her brother's injury, Andrea forms a plan to masquerade as her brother, to which Andrew reluctantly agrees. Andrea is \"welcomed\" by unfriendly competition and comes back home with a scrape on her arm, which makes her mother, Geneva (Mary-Margaret Humes), suspicious. After dragging the answer out of youngest son Jason (Scott Terra) and a whole night to think it over, Geneva secretly (and reluctantly) agrees to let Andrea race in Andrew's place. The catch, however, is that this all needs to happen behind Edward's back, and before he comes home with a replacement rider.\nAndrea and her mother arrive at the race venue and register under her brother's name, \"Andy\". In spite of her initial confidence, Andrea learns the hard way that competition is fierce, and finishes last in her first race. Thinking that Andrea is a guy, competitor Dean Talon (Riley Smith) takes notice when the \"lapper\" garners the attention of several young women, finding it unbelievable that a 125 rider is getting looks. Dean, knowing that \"Andrew\" needs help with riding, offers to help the rookie in exchange for advice on his crush, Faryn Henderson (Katherine Ellis).\nAndrea quickly finds herself falling for Dean, who she reluctantly helps win Faryn's shallow affection. Her training also pays off when she places 7th in a following race. She continues to improve and takes 1st place in the last race of the day to get an overall 3rd place finish.

He is poorly received by Andrea after he tries to hit on her and treats her brothers with disrespect. After some research, Andrea learns that Cartier has garnered a bad reputation for his harsh, underhanded and dangerous behavior on the track, but when Andrew brings it to Edward's attention, he says that an aggressive rider is what the family needs at the moment.\nAndrea finds no further solace when she finds Cartier talking with Art Henderson, a competitor, though she is only scolded by Edward when he sees the two of them arguing. Back at camp, the Carson family confront Edward for the way he's treating Andrea. He tries to defend himself, but Geneva and Andrew show him how much he's really hurting Andrea by behaving the way he is. Alone in his thoughts, Edward begins to realize how much racing really means to Andrea and the support the rest of the family has given her. He finds Andrea arguing with Cartier; Andrea says that she's only trying to help her family, and Cartier rudely tells her to back off before shoving her. Edward sees it, runs over to them and shoves Cartier back in retaliation before telling him off and firing him. He and Andrea then go for a walk, where Edward tells her that he is proud of her for bringing Carson Racing to where it is now. Andrea admits her only regret was that instead of Andrew that got injured, it was her. Edward tells her not to think about anything else, and allows her to race in the final heat.\nOn the final race, Andrea and Cartier, now racing under Art Henderson Racing, find themselves fighting fiercely for the finish. When Cartier fumbles on a turn, Andrea takes the victory and finishes 1st. However, an angry Cartier exposes her during a live interview, much to the shock of the entire community and Dean's dismay. A heated argument between the Carson family and Art Henderson Racing gets under way about disqualifying Andrea by saying that a girl isn't allowed to compete, which Geneva argues, saying that she read the rules and it doesn't mention anywhere about girls not being allowed to race. Henderson then tries to argue that Andrea wasn't registered, and Geneva pulls out the registration form showing that Andrea did register under \"Andy Carson\", as it is short for Andrea. Barbara Rollins (Aloma Wright), the corporate CEO, expresses her inspiration at Andrea's actions, much to Henderson and Cartier's embarrassment. She is inspired that a woman \"came on top in a man's sport,\" and not only allows Andrea to retain her title, but also awards the entire Carson family a full factory sponsorship.\nBack at home, Geneva surprises the kids with the news that they have the privilege of hiring a 250 rider for the next race. She then tells the kids that someone is already interested in the job, and is at the house to interview. Upon walking outside, Andrea finds Dean who says that he heard they needed a 250 rider.

Confounding the situation is another wounded Bosniak soldier (Cera, portrayed by Filip \u0160ovagovi\u0107) who wakes from unconsciousness. A land mine had been buried beneath him by the Bosnian Serbs; should he make any move, it would be fatal.\nA French sergeant (Marchand, portrayed by Georges Siatidis), of the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), gets involved in effort to help the three trapped soldiers, despite initial orders to the contrary by high command. UNPROFOR's mission in Bosnia was to guard the humanitarian aid convoys, to remain neutral and act as a mere bystander.

Reuben's familiarity with casino security makes him very reluctant to get involved, but when he starts to think of it as a good way to get back at his rival, Terry Benedict, who owns all three casinos, he agrees to finance the operation. \nThe three men know that the Nevada Gaming Commission requires casinos to have enough cash on hand to cover all their patrons' bets and they predict that on the night of a highly anticipated boxing match, the Bellagio vault will contain more than $150 million.\nDanny and Rusty recruit eight former colleagues and criminal specialists: con men Frank Catton and Saul Bloom, auto specialists Virgil and Turk Malloy, explosives expert Basher Tarr, electronic surveillance technician Livingston Dell, acrobat \"The Amazing\" Yen, and pickpocket Linus Caldwell.

Inside a theater in Mexico, one of the men, the dapper and refined French tenor Armand Dupres sings an operatic aria. Backstage, Spanish tenor Ricardo Palacios' wife tries to shoot him in the groin for cheating on her. Police take her away screaming, as Palacios and superstitious Italian tenor, Fabrizio Bernini, prepare to go onstage. Palacios hands his colleagues large Mexican sombreros and tells them to their disgust they must sing a mariachi number together. The concert turns into a disaster. A series of newspaper headlines follow their performance asking \"Tenors or Clowns?\" and explaining that his singing partners are suing Palacios for fraud. Paparazzi photographs follow showing Bernini kissing Palacios' wife and Dupres mourning his own wife's death.\nThe action shifts ten years forward as Dupres is preparing to marry Palacios' daughter. The Frenchman's butler is horrified and tries to sabotage the union. Bernini has also married Palacios' now ex-wife. The Italian tenor does not want to attend Dupres' wedding, but his wife wants to be there for her daughter. She chides him about his insecurity, as he questions her whether Palacios was a better lover. Palacios also plans to attend his daughter's wedding at Dupres' French villa, but he has additional schemes in mind. He hires a call girl to pose as his fianc\u00e9e to convince his former partners and ex-wife how well he is now doing. While learning facts about his life (e.g. he was born on a boat to Mexico), the call girl tries to seduce him but he refuses, saying that sex has gotten him into trouble in the past. Immediately, an irate chef confronts the tenor about sleeping with his daughter, whom he insists now has twins who sing constantly.\nOn the way to Dupres' villa, Bernini feels ill because of his phobia of air conditioning and germs. At the villa, his wife and Dupres are briefly alone together. She threatens to tell her daughter and he threatens to tell her husband that they too were once lovers. Dupres and Bernini speculate over why Palacios is really attending the wedding. Dupres suggests that the Spaniard is more concerned with money than anything else. Once he arrives, Palacios tells his former colleagues that he has discovered \"the new Three Tenors\", in a bid to get them to return to performing together instead. Later, while his wife is painting his greying eyebrows dark, Bernini theatrically exclaims that everyone wants to replace him. She chides him for thinking the world revolves around himself.\nThe following day, after Palacios sings a tango, the tenors have an argument. Dupres and Bernini express disgust that Palacios got them to record duets with pop singers, dress as mariachis, and promote Pizza Hut and the World Cup, when what they do is art. Palacios avers that repeating the same compositions over and over for rich people is not art. It is more important to him that 1.5 billion people watched them perform on television.\nLater that day, Palacios hears a new composition by Dupres' son performed by three singing waiters. Telling the son that he has conducted modern music like his, he convinces them to perform the composition at a party on the eve of Dupres' wedding, claiming to his former partners that these were his three young discoveries. Once they hear them sing, the older tenors begin to sing together too. After the party, Bernini unsuccessfully tries to kill himself, despairing over his thirty-year rivalry with Palacios, while Dupres' fianc\u00e9e realizes she is actually in love with his son.

For two years, Gabe has been experiencing increases in strength, speed, and mental ability, but neither he nor his wife T.K. (Carla Gugino) can understand why. While transporting a prisoner, Gabe \"feels\" Yulaw's presence in time to avoid being shot. Gabe sustains an injury after falling from a wall which Yulaw scales with ease. Roedecker and Funsch arrive in time to stop Yulaw from finishing off Gabe.\nAlthough unfamiliar with interdimensional travel, Gabe realizes that Yulaw is identical to him in every way. Rodecker and Funsch track Yulaw to the hospital where Gabe is being examined. Yulaw deters them from shooting him because if he is killed, Gabe would then be left as the One.

Yulaw sneaks into Gabe's residence where T.K., believing him to be Gabe, agrees to hide him from the police. She realizes that Yulaw is deceiving her but not in time to avoid being captured.

On a dare by some courtiers, Seimei demonstrates his exceptional skills in onmy\u014dd\u014d by killing a butterfly without touching it (i.e. casting a spell on a leaf which then flies and cuts through it).\nHiromasa later visits Seimei at his home, where he sees Seimei's shikigami in human form, one of whom was Mitsumushi, the butterfly he had killed (and subsequently revived) earlier. Seimei joins Hiromasa in inspecting a mysterious gourd growing from a pine tree in Lord Kaneie's house; Seimei reveals the gourd to have been caused by a curse cast by a former lover of Kaneie who committed suicide.\nOne night, Hiromasa impresses an unseen lady on an oxcart with his flute playing. Unbeknownst to him, this woman is Sukehime, Minister of the Right Fujiwara no Motokata's daughter and one of the current emperor's wives, who is worried that she is losing the emperor's favor as another wife, Lady T\u014dko, the daughter of Minister of the Left Fujiwara no Morosuke, had just given birth to a baby boy, who is to be the heir to the throne.\nMeanwhile, the head onmy\u014dji of the imperial Bureau of Onmy\u014d, D\u014dson, is secretly plotting to overthrow the emperor by trying to awaken the vengeful spirit of Prince Sawara, who had died 150 years ago. Wrongfully accused of treason by his brother, the Emperor Kanmu, Sawara committed suicide, but not before swearing eternal vengeance on the Son of Heaven (i.e. the emperor). When D\u014dson curses the emperor's newborn son, Prince Atsuhira, to be possessed by an evil spirit, Seimei combats his spells and drives the demon away with the help of Hiromasa and the immortal Lady Aone, who was ordered by Kanmu to guard the burial mound where Prince Sawara's spirit is sealed away.\nHiromasa once again meets Sukehime (again unseen by Hiromasa) on the oxcart. He confesses his feelings for Sukehime, who he calls 'Lady of the Full Moon' (\u671b\u6708\u306e\u541b Mochizuki no kimi), but Sukehime, who still loves the emperor, rejects his advances.\nBoth Seimei and Aone are put under arrest by Motokata and accused of cursing the infant prince. They are saved in the nick of time by Morosuke, who points out it is unlawful to kill a court onmy\u014dji without imperial permission. D\u014dson, who is implied to be behind the allegation, enchants one of the imperial police to attack the two; Aone is severely wounded, but proves to be unharmed due to her immortality.\nTaking advantage of Sukehime's jealousy against T\u014dko, D\u014dson uses his powers to turn her into a namanari (a woman halfway to becoming an oni) that harasses both T\u014dko and the newborn Atsuhira. Seimei uses onmy\u014dd\u014d to transform straw effigies into the likenesses of the Emperor and the infant prince. Sukehime arrives and assaults the effigies, thinking them to be the real emperor and Atsuhira. The emperor, moved by a waka poem she recites (the same poem Hiromasa hears the lady on the oxcart recite earlier), speaks out loudly, breaking Seimei's spell. Hiromasa, recognizing Sukehime to be his 'Lady of the Full Moon', steps in to accost her.\nSukehime briefly comes back to her senses when Seimei removes a paper talisman attached to her back, but D\u014dson doubles his efforts, and she completely transforms into an oni. When Hiromasa sacrifices himself by allowing her to bite on his arm, Sukehime comes back to her senses once more and kills herself with Hiromasa's tachi. In her final moments, Sukehime - now a human once more - begs to hear Hiromasa's flute one last time.\nSeimei shoots an arrow with the paper talisman towards the sky, ordering the curse to go back to its sender. The arrow, now on fire, lands in D\u014dson's secret lair, burning it to the ground. D\u014dson, swearing vengeance on Seimei, finally releases the spirit of Prince Sawara from its confinement in the burial mound. Sawara's ghost enters D\u014dson's body and summons a horde of vengeful spirits to attack Heian-ky\u014d. Aone reveals to Seimei that he and Hiromasa are foretold by the stars to become the two protectors of the city: one cannot survive without the other. She, Seimei and Mitsumushi then go off in search of Hiromasa.\nD\u014dson makes his way to the imperial palace. Hiromasa tries to stop him in his tracks, but he is no match for his superhuman abilities; he is mortally wounded when D\u014dson throws back an arrow Hiromasa shot towards him. Seimei and Aone find him, but it is too late. Aone suggests that Seimei resurrect Hiromasa by performing the rite of Taizan-fukun, the Chinese god of the dead (\u6cf0\u5c71\u5e9c\u541b\u796d Taizan-fukun no matsuri), offering to sacrifice her immortality and life to do so.\nHiromasa, brought back to life by the ritual, and Seimei go to face D\u014dson. Aone's spirit, speaking through Hiromasa's body, convinces Sawara to give up his hatred. While Sawara at first refuses to do so, he is finally moved by the prospect of being with Aone - who was the prince's lover during his lifetime - forever; he then passes peacefully with Aone into the afterlife. Although now without Sawara's spirit to empower him, D\u014dson resumes the fight. Seimei, using his wits, traps D\u014dson within a magical barrier. Finally admitting defeat, D\u014dson slashes his throat with the sword from Sawara's burial mound.\nAt the end of the movie, Seimei and Hiromasa drink sake together in Seimei's house. Hiromasa teases Seimei for crying when he died and reflects on what Seimei said to him earlier: that the human heart can turn one into a demon or a buddha.

This new order brings together members from the three main religions of the region: Christians, Jews, and Muslims. As a self-declared leader and messiah, Charles writes the sacred texts of the Order. While traveling to Syria, his camp is attacked by the Christian knights, who kill Le Vaillant.

His problems are compounded when a potential buyer attempts to steal the egg and falls on it, destroying it.\nIt is revealed that Rudy's father is archaeologist and museum curator Oscar \"Ozzie\" Cafmeyer (Vernon Dobtcheff). Ozzie travels to Israel in search of a secret he has discovered and is kidnapped while on the phone with Rudy, who travels to Jerusalem to rescue him.

Barr gives Rudy papers left by his father in which Ozzie explains he had discovered the lost manuscripts of the Order, lost since the Crusades, and that the new sect within the Order does not wish for them to be revealed because they show the location of a mythical Jewish treasure. Rudy shows it to Avram, who insists that the \"treasure\" is merely a metaphor for the wisdom of the ancient sages and says that its location in the Order's monastery cannot be accessed by outsiders anyway.

Barr and American Rudy Cafmeyer in order to trigger World War III. Rudy saves Avram from falling into a pit trap before they reach a room loaded with treasure next to the chamber underneath the Well of Souls.

After she leaves, Mrs. Mills joins him and it becomes clear that he is piling up the leaves to hide the gravestones, Mrs. Mills assures him that Grace will learn the reasons behind the unexplained events in due time. Outside, in thick fog, Grace runs into her husband Charles, who she thought had been killed in the war. Charles greets his children after a long absence, but is distant during his short stay at the house. Later, Grace checks up on her daughter, Anne, whom she has left to play in a spare room.  Instead, to her horror Grace finds an old woman on the floor in the room wearing her daughter's communion dress, veil down. She demands of the old woman \"What have you done with my daughter ?\" but the old woman replies in Anne's voice \"I am your daughter\". Frightened, Grace attacks the old woman only to find that the old woman is merely an illusion and Grace has inadvertently attacked her own daughter. Later, Anne tells her brother that their mother has gone mad in the same way she did \"that day\" but he does not recall. Charles says he must leave for the front, even though Grace claims that the war is over. The two embrace and lie motionless together in bed.\nThe next morning, Charles has left and the children are screaming that the curtains are gone, thus letting in the sunlight. Grace accuses the servants of having removed the curtains against her wishes and expels them from the house. That night, the children sneak outside and discover that the gravestones in the grounds belong to the recently banished servants. The children run away in fear when they turn to see that the servants are approaching them in the foggy dark of night. Meanwhile, Grace finds a photograph that has slipped out of the Book of the Dead and fallen onto the floor under some furniture. The photograph displays the corpses of the three servants, Mrs. Mills, Tuttle and Lydia, who perished during a tuberculosis outbreak in 1891. The children run upstairs and hide in the bedroom where they are discovered by \"the other\" elderly woman. Mrs. Mills returns to the house and tells Grace to go upstairs and talk to the intruders.\nGrace discovers that the old woman is in fact a medium in a s\u00e9ance with Victor's parents, who has found out via automatic writing that Grace smothered her children to death with a pillow in a fit of despair before committing suicide. Grace realizes that \"the others\" are the family that has moved into the house, and that she, her children, and the servants are, in fact, dead.\nFollowing this display of supernatural and spiritual activity, Victor and his family vacate the house and leave it in the occupancy of the ghosts of its predecessors. However, because they are dead, Anne and Nicholas' ghosts are finally allowed to play in the sun. Mrs. Mills informs the Stewarts that others will come back to the house and they will have to learn to coexist together, but Grace ominously states that the house is theirs.

Between the two they argue about who should buy the tickets.\nThe narration moves to days before, when in a first match between Colombia and Argentina, the streets of Bogota are empty because people are watching the match. Mariano watches the game on television with Sa\u00fal, his mother Rosa, his grandmother, Uncle Pedro (a supporter of Argentina nicknamed by his nephews \"The dogs\") and Rita, Pedro's wife. Uncle Pedro hates the Colombia team because unlike other teams they have not won major soccer championships and he is even more disappointed when he sees that the Colombians, especially his nephews, celebrate that the match ended in a tie by the national team Colombia. At the same time Luz Dary, Mariano's wife, arrives, who reluctantly leaves accompanied by Rita to buy schnapps at Mariano's request. After the tie celebrated by the residents of the neighborhood, the press interviewed the parents and brother of Jorge Alfredo 'the Beast' Sanabria, neighbors of the protagonists. 'The Beast' Sanabria is a star soccer player for the Colombia team, and therefore, also a neighbor and acquaintance of the protagonists.\nWhile in the rain Sa\u00fal stands in line to buy tickets, Mariano has sex with Luz Dary. Later it is revealed that Mariano is also a dreamer in which Luz Dary refutes him not to be aware of the eventual purchase of an apartment for the two of them living close together in the Concha family home. The next day, Mariano and Sa\u00fal argue with Uncle Pedro about who will win the rematch match. Mariano bets money, which he does not have, and Mariano, unconsciously and irresponsibly, bets the 6 million pesos saved to buy the apartment for his wife and proposes to his uncle to bet the house, which is actually the grandmother's, against. Sa\u00fal is against the bet, because they bet what does not belong to them. Pedro, knowing that Argentina will win, accepts the bet. But he makes a condition; if Argentina wins, Pedro will keep the money but Mariano and Sa\u00fal will have to leave the house. Mariano also accepts and offers the opposite, if Colombia wins, Mariano keeps the money, the house and Pedro would be the one who would leave the house. Both seal the bet as gentlemen before the astonished gaze of Sa\u00fal and the grandmother.\nMariano and Luz Dary are going to withdraw the money to the bank and decide to celebrate their wedding anniversary at night, although Luz Dary is unaware of her husband's intentions. It is later revealed that Mariano is an obscure bureaucrat who works in a government ministry, but is a rather inept employee with reprimands on his CV. Being sure that the Colombian team will win the match, Mariano also bets the 6 million pesos on his boss Ram\u00edrez, having his partner Emilio Guti\u00e9rrez as guarantor of the bet with the money temporarily in his account. Ram\u00edrez accepts the bet and demands that he stay the night updating some papers or he'll working on Sunday, when Concha had already bought tickets for the game. Mariano reluctantly stays and argues that he gave the money to Don Vicente Sanabria, father of 'The Beast', who would sell them the apartment.\nDisappointed that her husband is staying the night working, Luz Dary celebrates her anniversary with Sa\u00fal by having a few drinks. Sa\u00fal, taking advantage of the drunkenness, seduces her sister-in-law, and they both go to a motel where they try to have sex but Luz Dary stops Sa\u00fal at the last moment. Mariano runs away without finishing work and gets home before his wife. Both argue about Mariano's decision not to be with her because he is working and Luz Dary's boredom at her house without being able to go out to have fun.\nThe next morning, Sa\u00fal argues to his brother that he had spoken good things to Luz Dary about her husband. Then they go to church where they ask the priest to make the Colombia team win the match. On Sunday morning, Mariano and Sa\u00fal prepare to go to the game but they are surprised that Uncle Pedro is not ready to go. They both go to his bedroom where they try to wake him up and to Mariano's surprise, his uncle Pedro is dead; he died while he slept. Sa\u00fal begins to feel guilty since both he and Mariano irritated his uncle who also suffered from heart disease. Pedro suffered with each game, which could hasten his death. Sa\u00fal remains undecided about going to the game, but Mariano decides to go no matter what. When Mariano finally convinces Sa\u00fal to go to the stadium, Luz Dary discovers that Pedro is dead and alerts Mariano, much to his immediate frustration. The corpse is taken to a small funeral home. Sa\u00fal, as a last tribute to his uncle, leaves the radio to his uncle's corpse, according to Sa\u00fal, so that his uncle could listen to the game in the Beyond. But still Mariano decides to go at any cost, but several more unfortunate circumstances prevent him from doing so; He must take his grandmother because there is no space in the other cars, when he arrives he tries with Sa\u00fal to escape in his car but it breaks down. Saul reveals to Luz Dary Mariano's intentions to go to the stadium to watch the game. Mariano calls his boss Ram\u00edrez who refuses to believe that his uncle died and that he is at the funeral home. Ram\u00edrez warns him that Argentina is close to scoring a goal and that he is about to win the bet. Mariano and Saul try to flee this time taking her grandmother arguing the old woman's need to go to the bathroom. But when they try to take a taxi to the stadium they fail and instead Uncle Augusto arrives for the funeral, forcing both men to stay. Don Vicente reveals to Luz Dary that Mariano never bought the apartment for him and tells Mariano that although the game is tied, Argentina is close to scoring a goal. Mariano confesses to Luz Dary that he bet the money on the football game, which unleashes the woman's anger. The match ends in a draw 0-0, so the victory must be decided by penalties. Mariano listens to the game by placing his ear on the coffin where the radio is.

Just before Daddy Tang's death, Pootie inherits his father's belt and is told that (as long as he has right on his side) he can \"whoop anyone's ass with just that belt.\" He uses his dying breath to warn his son to not let the ladies get between him and the belt.\nAs a young adult, Pootie Tang rises to fame and becomes well known for a variety of reasons. He sings in nightclubs, stars in public service announcements for children, produces top-of-the-charts music hits, and generally defeats wrongdoers with the power of his belt. Dick Lecter, the chief operating officer of multi-industrial conglomerate LecterCorp, learns of Pootie Tang's positive influence on society \u2014 and his negative influence on LecterCorp's bottom line. After his henchmen and a villain named Dirty Dee are sent away by Pootie's friends, Lecter encourages his right-hand lady, Ireenie, to seduce Pootie Tang into signing an agreement with LecterCorp that would stop Pootie Tang's influence on America's children.\nPootie Tang falls for Ireenie's tricks and subsequently falls apart. His status as pop culture icon is destroyed, and he engages on a quest to \"find [him]self\". This journey is encouraged by his friend Biggie Shorty, who promises to wait for Pootie to return to her and to the rest of society. Pootie moves to a farm where the local sheriff decides Pootie should start dating his daughter. After his single corn stalk dies, he has a vision of Daddy Tang and Momma Dee. Daddy Tang reveals that there is nothing special about Pootie's belt; instead, Pootie must fight evil with the goodness that is inside him. After dealing with Dirty Dee and his henchman Froggy (as well as getting his belt back), Pootie realizes he must move back to the city and fight crime once again.\nPootie Tang returns to the city just as Dick Lecter is unveiling the first of his new restaurant chain, Pootie's Bad Time Burgers. At a small news conference, Pootie confronts Lecter only to discover that Lecter has amassed dozens of \"Pootie-alikes\" who will spread the message of LecterCorp around the nation. Pootie Tang, with the help of Biggie Shorty, defeats all of these henchmen and Lecter himself. Good triumphs over evil once again, and Biggie Shorty finally gets her man: she and Pootie Tang plan to get married now that Pootie is back. Elsewhere, Dick Lecter leaves corporate life and becomes an actor, Ireenie leaves him and becomes a counselor helping at-risk teenage prostitutes, and Dirty Dee is still dirty.", "tmdb_id": 10615}, "6640066": {"title": "Poovellam Un Vasam", "plot": "Two families stay in identical bungalows, adjacent to each other, tracing their friendship to over 40 years.

Her co-workers include Junko Sasano, Toshio Yabe, and Taguchi, who has been missing for several days while working on a computer disk for the shop's sales. Michi goes to Taguchi's apartment and finds him distracted and aloof; during their conversation, he casually makes a noose, goes into another room, and hangs himself. Michi and her friends inspect the disk he left behind and discover it contains an image of Taguchi staring into his own computer monitor, on which Taguchi staring into his monitor can be seen - creating an endless series of images. In the other monitor on his desk, they discover a ghostly face staring out into Taguchi's room.\nYabe receives a phone call and hears a distorted voice saying \"help me.\" Upon checking his phone, he sees the same image found on Taguchi's disk. He goes to Taguchi's apartment and sees a black stain on the wall where he hanged himself, as well as a paper with \"how to make a forbidden room\" (akazu no heya no tsukurikata) written on it. He notices a door sealed with red tape and enters it, where he encounters a ghost. Yabe becomes depressed and tells Michi that he saw something horrible in \"the forbidden room.\"\nMichi receives a call like the one Yabe got. She goes check on Yabe and finds a black stain on the wall like the one in Taguchi's apartment. She panics when she realizes Junko has unsealed and entered a \"forbidden room.\" Inside, she witnesses Junko being cornered by a ghost, and rescues her. Junko becomes catatonic from the encounter. She later steps toward the wall and becomes a black stain, which then dissolves and scatters as Michi tries in vain to stop it. Worried, Michi goes to check on her mother, who lives outside Tokyo.\nThe second plotline follows Ryosuke Kawashima, a university economics student who has recently signed up to a new internet service provider. His computer accesses a website by itself, showing him disturbing images of people alone in dark rooms exhibiting bizarre behavior. That night, Ryosuke wakes up to find his computer on again with the disturbing images displaying and frantically unplugs it. The next day he goes to the university computer lab looking for answers and meets Harue Karasawa (Koyuki), a post-graduate computer science student, who suggests he either bookmark the page or screen capture the images for her to examine. Ryosuke attempts to do so, but finds that his computer will not follow his commands. Instead, a video plays of a man with his head in a plastic bag sitting in a room with the words \"HELP ME\" written all over the walls.\nA graduate student who Harue is working with explains to Ryosuke his theory that the souls of the dead have begun to invade the physical world. Harue confides her lifelong feelings of isolation to Ryosuke, then begins acting strangely, suggesting that ghosts would want to trap humans in their own loneliness rather than kill them. Ryosuke tries to escape with her to a faraway place on the train. However, their train stops, and Harue, seized by a desire to return home, runs away. Upon returning to her apartment, she witnesses the man with the plastic bag shoot himself on her computer.

He grasps an old okiagari-koboshi musical doll which brings his memories back to August 1945, near the end of the war.\nAt Mt. Grand Xingan in 1945, Yang, a Hebei peasant in his 30s, was captured by Japanese imperial soldiers, and was brought to the Daxing'anling area near Manchuria (bordering the Soviet Union) after the Japanese slaughtered his aged mother. He was put in a firing squad to be executed. The firing killed everyone in line but Yang. As a Japanese soldier reloaded the machine gun, a Soviet T-34 tank knocked over the wall which the captives were lined. The tank crushes a Japanese soldier and saves Yang's life. Yang was the sole survivor and was put under the charge of Nadja, a young female Soviet lieutenant and her comrades. Nadja was tasked with escorting Yang to headquarters, but their truck driver Shakov took a wrong turn and strayed into a Japanese garrison. Most of Soviet soldiers on the truck were killed in the ensuing skirmish but Nadja, a Soviet tank soldier and Yang escaped into a forested area.\nAs the three crossed a bridge, they came under a grenade attack from a teenage Japanese schoolgirl named Akiyoko and her older sister in a wooden shed. After being confronted by Shakov, Akiyoko's sister commits suicide by swallowing a cyanide capsule. After Akiyoko attempts to commit suicide the same way but is stopped by Shakov. Fearing that releasing her will alert the Japanese troops, the three take Akiyoko captive and force her to lead them out of the vast forest as a guide. Akiyoko brought the three to a minefield where Shakov was blown up by a land mine. Realizing that Akiyoko had led them into a death trap, Nadja was infuriated by the death of her comrade, but decided not to kill her as she was their sole guide. Nadja carries very little food, both Yang and Akiyoko follow her for this reason: without Nadja they would not make it out of the forest alive.\nFeeling betrayed by Akiyoko's cunningness, Akiyoko is forcefully tied to a tree. Nadja hands Yang a dagger to kill Akiyoko, Yang falters at the last second and hesitates due to a flashback. Yang remembers the Japanese tying his elderly mother and himself to wooden posts when they invaded his village, and used bayonets to stab his mother to death in front of his very eyes. Faltering, Yang drops the blade and convulses into tears. Afterwards, Yang decides to continue the path with Nadja, leaving Akiyoko stranded in the forest and left to die. However, in a stroke of mercy, he returns and frees Akiyoko, taking her along with them.\nAt many points both Yang and Nadja were tempted to kill Akiyoko, but eventually saved her life from drowning in a quagmire. That night, Yang encounters another flashback; being forced by the Japanese to dump the bodies of dead Chinese civilians into the river. One victim makes an effort to signal Yang that he is still alive, when Yang conveys this information to the Japanese captors, they forcefully place the victim into a sack and proceed to burn him alive. Delighted by this sadistic endeavour, they then tie a bundle of live grenades to the sack and dump him into the river. A traumatized Yang looks on with pain and anguish.\nBy the third day, the three make it out of the forest alive. To the north lies flat, open grassland that stretches on forever. When crossing the plains, they witness a dogfight occur between a Japanese Mitsubishi Zero and another plane. The Japanese fighter starts emitting a trail of black smoke and crashes into the field behind them. Akiyoko is reminded of her childhood sweetheart Onishi, who was conscripted as a fighter pilot by the Japanese air force, and in a sudden urge of desperation, runs towards the downed plane. Worried, Yang follows her. The wreckage soon is engulfed in flames, and the fire catches on to the surrounding grass. The fire starts spreading and rages towards them. Knowing that they are unable to outrun the spread of the flames, Akiyoko saves the lives of Yang and Nadja by telling them to stay low to the ground on a burnt patch of grass.\nAfter the fire is over, Yang realizes that Akiyoko is capable of speaking Chinese. He frees her by cutting the rope binding her hands. Yang and Nadja later learn about Akiyoko's background: she moved to China when she was four years old, and grew up in Mt. Grand Xingan. Her father was the owner of a lumber farm. When the Japanese conscripted her father to the front line, he instructed her to flee with her sister to the seaside where they would cross the sea to the Japanese mainland. However, having been dispersed among the refugees, they became lost and ended up in the hideout where they encountered Shakov.\nAlthough Nadja wanted to move north to meet up with the Soviet troops, Akiyoko convinced Yang moving south was the only way out of the forest. Conflicting feelings of mistrust and friendship dogged all three as they rely on one another to survive. At one point, a sudden rainstorm caused Nadja to stray from her two partners whilst searching for food. Yang and Akiyoko waited for two days for Nadja's return, but Nadja was able to find her way back after hearing Yang firing her accidentally PPSh-41 submachine gun at an attacking tiger. Akiyoko discovers that despite Yang not knowing how to fire a gun, he refused to let her touch it. From that day on, Yang develops a curiosity towards Nadja's gun, and teaches himself how to use it.\nThe three eventually found their way to the same location where they confronted the Japanese troops, and Yang and Nadja realized they have been tricked by Akiyoko by circling around the forest. A tearful Akiyoko explained she was trying to get them to surrender to the Japanese troops so that they could get food and lodging at the camp. The three ended up back at the Soviet truck which they had earlier left during the skirmish with the Japanese troops, where the radio began to announce Emperor Hirohito's unconditional surrender to the Allied troops. Akiyoko, shocked and humiliated by Japan's loss, grabbed Nadja's PPSh-41 and took aim at Yang and Nadja. Yang advanced on Akiyoko, placing the muzzle of the gun against his chest. Akiyoko was unable to fire the gun, and convulsed into sobs. Nadja then discovered that Yang had removed the cartridges from the gun before Akiyoko picked it up.\nThe war having now ended, Yang urged Akiyoko to go back to Japan and live a good life. Akiyoko tells Yang that she wishes to return to Japan in search of Onishi. Unfortunately, Onishi was part of the final fleet of Kamikaze fighter pilots sent to their deaths on August 16, 1945, one day after the Japanese surrender. The scene then transitions to Onishi being instructed to crash his fighter plane into American battleships. While in flight, Onishi attempts to escape from the cockpit, only to find it locked. Resigned to his doomed fate, Onishi crashes his plane into the sea, which subsequently explodes.\nHaving heard a series of loud explosions, the three then witness a group of Japanese soldiers and civilians committing mass suicide as they could not accept the fact their country had surrendered. Akiyoko mistakenly thought they were not informed of the surrender and ran to stop their foolish acts, but was shot in the head by a Japanese captain. Akiyoko's okiagari-koboshi doll rolled out of her grasp and she died.\nConsumed by fury and vengeance, Yang and Nadja drove the truck and attacked the remaining Japanese soldiers, who were charging at them. After all of Japanese soldiers were killed, Yang picked up Akiyoko's okiagari-koboshi doll. The film then fast-forwards to present day where an elderly, wheelchair-bound Nadja places flowers on Poklonnaya Gora war memorial with the large numerals \"1945\" to commemorate Akiyoko's death. The film then flashes back to 1945, where a voice from the truck's radio read out a declaration of peace and harmony, as the remaining Japanese troops toss their weapons aside as they make their way towards the sunset. Nadja points out to Yang that the sunset is purple, a sight that Akiyoko cherished.

The tribunal consists of Commodore Pellew, Captain Hammond, and Captain Collins. Pellew is very fond of Hornblower, his former subordinate, while Hammond views the lieutenant as an overambitious schemer.\nEvents flash back and forth between the circumstances of six months previous (which is also covered by the previous film, Mutiny) and the court-martial. After Sawyer's failed attack on the Spanish fort, Buckland wants to admit to defeat and sail to Kingston, but Hornblower suggests they launch a bold surprise night assault on the fort by land and then trap the Spanish ships anchored in the bay beneath the fort. Thirty-three seamen, led by Randall, desert during the night. Because the desertion occurred under his command, Buckland tries to salvage his reputation by agreeing to Hornblower's plan. The landing force, led by Hornblower, Kennedy, and Bush, discovers the deserters all dead. Hornblower concludes they were killed not by the Spanish, but rebelling slaves.\nA slave leader, \"Colonel\" Francois Lefanu, parlays with Buckland, admitting his men mistook the deserters for Spaniards. He demands the British leave Santo Domingo, asserting this is not their fight. Due to Buckland's blundering, a firefight begins accidentally. The shots alert the Spanish to the British attack. The landing party charges the fort, but is pinned down by heavy fire. Hornblower discovers a series of tunnels and leads some of the men inside; his quick thinking results in the capture of the fort. Using hot shot, the landing party fires the fort's cannons at three fleeing Spanish ships, disabling one.\nAfter their victory, the British meet Colonel Francisco Manuel Ortega, the Spanish commander, who is strangely anxious to surrender the island to them, as long as the Spanish are allowed to board their ships and depart. The British soon discover why; the fort is under siege by the rebel slaves, and the Spanish are starving. At Hornblower's urging, Buckland stalls for time while a cannon is lifted up a cliff to where it can fire on the Spanish ships. Once they demonstrate that the Spanish ships are within range of the British cannon, Buckland obtains an unconditional surrender. Hobbs tries to free Sawyer, but fails. Hobbs then confronts Midshipman Wellard and accuses him of pushing Sawyer down the hold.\nAs the Spanish are surrendering, the slaves attack the fort. While evacuating the Spanish prisoners, Buckland orders Hornblower to blow up the fort. Bush and Kennedy disobey Buckland's order to remain aboard Renown and aid Hornblower in setting off the explosion, then help him return to Renown. Buckland gives Hornblower command of the Spanish ships. Later that night, the Spanish prisoners try to seize Renown. The attempt fails, due in large part to Hornblower leading his crew back aboard Renown during the fighting. Sawyer and Wellard are killed and Bush and Kennedy injured.\nThe tribunal members are unimpressed with Buckland when they learn that during the Spanish attempt to seize Renown, he was surprised in bed and spent the fight tied up in his cabin. In an effort to salvage his career, Buckland rashly states that Sawyer became mentally unstable because Hornblower pushed him into the hold. Buckland calls on Hobbs to back him, but Hobbs states that he does not know. During a recess, Pellew tells Hammond and Collins that instead of hanging Hornblower, they should promote him.

Amongst the protesters is Paul Parsons, the brother of Kimberly Parsons who was one of Stanley's last victims. When Lauren confesses to hiring someone to rewrite his screenplay, Stanley binds her to a cement flower pot. A horrified Lauren realizes Alan's true identity and desperately suggests that he become a director. Stanley is intrigued by the idea, but nevertheless pushes her overboard to drown.\nOn the set of the film, Paul Parsons confronts Mike Helton and demands that he cease the production, but is dragged away by security.  Stanley then arrives in disguise, claiming that he owns the cabin where the film is being shot, in fact the actual cabin where he had lived two years prior.

She explains her fascination with Stanley as a film student and invites him out for coffee at a later date, which Stanley accepts.\nHelton unveils the indoor set for Cabin by the Lake: An enormous water tank almost identical to Stanley's original \"garden\". Tasked with shooting the underwater scenes, Stanley dons scuba gear and dives into the tank to tend his garden, infuriating Helton by ignoring his stage directions.

When she mentions Kimberly Parsons, Stanley describes how she had fought the hardest of all his victims, remembering vividly how she had scratched and clawed him.\nWhen Alison returns to the tank alone to continue writing, she is ambushed by an unknown person. Helton believes that Paul Parsons is responsible, in an effort to sabotage the production.

In turn, Stanley drugs Helton and takes him back to the cabin where he buries him alive, using fireworks to cover his panicked screams.\nStanley takes over as director, micromanaging every aspect of the film.  At the lake, Paul confronts Alison about her part in the production. He apologizes for scaring her at the tank and invites her to meet him at the bar to discuss his sister. Paul gives details of Kimberly's death that eerily correspond with those from Stanley himself, rousing Alison's suspicions. When she confronts Stanley, he gives her a drugged glass of wine that renders her unconscious. She awakens in Stanley's cabin basement, chained to the floor by her ankle just like all his previous victims. As he greets her with food, the scars on his forearm confirm his identity.\nPaul repeatedly calls the set looking for Alison, but is told that she finished rewriting the script and went home.  Stanley then falsely informs Paul that he is planning to scrap the production and invites Paul to meet him at the stage that night. Stanley directs the final scene of the movie, but secretly rigs a light fixture to fall into the tank and electrocute the actress inside. When Paul arrives on set just afterwards, Stanley frames him for the incident and sends him fleeing.\nStanley coerces the actors playing Mallory and Boone to come back to the set for one final shot, then returns to the cabin where a defiant Alison manipulates him into bringing her to the stage. She tries to warn the two actors that Stanley is planning to kill them, but to no avail. While looking for Alison, Paul discovers she was abducted by Stanley.\nHolding them at gunpoint, Stanley carries out his plan to drown Mallory's actress.

Paul returns to help, but Alison is recaptured by Stanley and forced into his car. While driving, Alison deliberately crashes the car and escapes, but Stanley recovers and pursues her back to the cabin.\nStanley finds her hiding in the bathroom, but Alison strikes him with a towel rack and knocks him into a bathtub full of water. After a brief standoff, she throws a hair dryer into the tub and electrocutes him. The police arrive with Paul but a search of the cabin yields no sign of Stanley. They find his boat on the lake, and Alison finds a watch he had stolen from JC on the dock. The police decide they will drag the lake tomorrow and try to reassure Alison that Stanley is dead.\nA news report states that Cabin by the Lake was a surprise hit in its opening weekend, earning $36 million at the box office with a sequel already in the works.

Chris experiences his own strife with his Blood Pollution bandmates, particularly guitarist Rob Malcolm. During a show, Rob plays a guitar solo instead of following the note-for-note accuracy to the original Steel Dragon song and, after Chris sabotages Rob's amplifier mid-song, a fight breaks out between the two onstage. The next day, Chris goes to rehearsal but he finds out that he has been replaced by his arch-rival, the erstwhile lead singer of another Steel Dragon tribute band. Rob and Chris argue, and Rob criticizes Chris for preferring to remain the singer in a tribute band rather than create his own music.\nOne day, Chris receives an unexpected phone call from Steel Dragon's founder and rhythm guitarist, Kirk Cuddy, and is offered an audition for the band (thanks to two of Blood Pollution's groupies, who showed Kirk a videotape of one of Blood Pollution's concerts). After hanging up on Kirk once, thinking he's being pranked by Rob, Chris ecstatically agrees. At the studio, he meets the band and gives an outstanding performance of \"We All Die Young\" (a Steel Dragon song in the movie, but it is a real song by Steelheart, whose lead vocalist, Miljenko Matijevic, provides Cole's singing voice for the film). Chris joins the band as their new singer, adopting the stage name \"Izzy\". Following a successful debut concert with Steel Dragon, Izzy must come to grips with the pressures of his new-found fame and success. The band embarks on a lengthy tour and Izzy experiences the excesses of the lifestyle, with the group's road manager, Mats, serving as a sympathetic mentor to Izzy.\nHis new lifestyle impacts his life both for better and worse, particularly with his relationship with his supportive girlfriend, Emily Poule, when she decides not to continue with him throughout the remainder of the tour as a rock star girlfriend, though Emily and Izzy agree to get back together when the tour reaches Seattle. Eventually, Steel Dragon stops in Seattle for a show, and Emily arrives at his hotel room as they had previously arranged, although Izzy has become so inebriated while on tour he forgot about the arrangement and does not even know what city he is in. Although taken aback by all the groupies, Emily still tries to reconnect with him, reminding him of their plans to meet up once he got to Seattle; however he is too intoxicated to really understand what she is saying, eventually suggesting they go to Seattle together. Heartbroken with his inconsiderate behavior, intoxication and the fact that he is having sex with so many groupies, Emily leaves him.\nSix months later, Izzy reports to the next series of Steel Dragon recording sessions with song concepts and artwork for the band's next album. The rest of the band like his ideas, but they reject them, with Kirk explaining that the band has to stay true to the \"Steel Dragon thing\" to fulfill fan expectations. Izzy is angered upon realizing that he was only recruited for his vocal abilities. After a heartfelt conversation with Mats about how he feared he had no control over the direction life has taken him, Izzy begins to reconsider his rock star lifestyle. On the next tour, in a scene directly paralleling one near the beginning of the film with their roles reversed, Izzy hears a fan singing along with him toward the end of a live concert. Impressed, Izzy pulls the fan, who introduces himself as Thor, onstage and hands him the microphone to finish the concert.  Backstage, Izzy realizes that what he thought he wanted for so long was not what he wanted, and he says goodbye to Mats, departing from the band while doing so.\nAfter leaving Steel Dragon and ditching his rock star image and stage name, Chris makes his way to Seattle and starts a new band with his old friend and former bandmate, Rob, allowing him to write his own music. Chris finds Emily working in the coffee shop she and her roommate purchased a few years earlier, and he is initially too ashamed to speak to her. While walking one evening, Emily sees a flyer for his band posted on the wall and takes it down. In the final scene, Chris is singing with his band in a bar and Emily walks in. Chris leaves the stage and speaks to her.

He reveals that he and Steph are Federal Marshals assigned to capture Rabbit and bring him to court in Los Angeles to testify against his former boss, a mobster named Benny \"The Buzzsaw\" Buffalino, who has recently become partners with the Russian Mafia. Benny contracts Russian hitmen led by Sergei to hit Rabbit before he can testify against them. He was initially going to testify in exchange for complete immunity but ran after the Russians came to kill him. They are hunting him, too. Jack calls for a Suburban driven by four other marshals to pick them up before Sergei and his crew of killers arrive with heavy firepower. They leave out the back and battle the assassins until marshals; Nick, Mary, P.T., and Joe arrive between them. They manage to kill all assassins but Sergei. Jack and Rabbit use Rabbit's car to escape the same path as the other marshals (including Steph in the truck). Jack manages to shoot Sergei's tires out before leaving.\nP.T. complains to Stephanie about Jack, believing he isn't trustworthy. She tells him to focus on finding out where they are. Jack tries to find the roads they are using on the map, but Rabbit says the back roads are too old and do not have a place on the map except for his old guide. He reads that a second highway exists next to Route 66, leading faster to the California border. The road is U.S. Route 666, condemned after a prison road crew accident. Hearing the story, Jack has strange quick flashbacks of four prisoners digging a hole surrounded by law enforcement.\nMeanwhile, Sergei shoots a tourist and takes his Jeep. The marshals arrive at a deserted tourist attraction bordering Route 666 and see a restricted access sign. As Jack debates about using the road, he experiences more flashbacks and tells Stephanie that he was born around the area and his mother died when he was six, and he hardly knew his father. To Rabbit's dismay, Jack kicks open the gates, and the group drives onto it. Stephanie rides with Jack and Rabbit.\nUnknown to them, a county sheriff's deputy named Gil has been following them. He sees they went down Route 666 and requests backup on the radio. His father, Sheriff Conaway, denies and tells him to leave the road. Gil ignores and pulls the two vehicles over. Jack and P.T. confront him, and Gil abusively tells them the road is restricted. Jack shows him his badge, and he leaves irritated. They drive along until they spot a cemetery along the road and stop there. Jack and Stephanie explore the graveyard, finding Jack's father, John La Roca's grave. P.T. sees the grave along with three others next to it are the graves of Miles Hackman, Frank Slater, Steven Pikowski, and John La Roca. P.T. explains that all but John La Roca were infamous murderers from the 1960s. La Roca was a bank robber who quit robbing after marrying a woman in a small town and having a baby, Jack. After six years, there was no more money for his family, so he tried to rob a bank but was caught and thrown in the same prison as Hackman, Slater, and Pikowski.\nP.T. suddenly realizes La Roca is Jack's father. They soon start to fight each other. Mary and Nick leave Joe to watch Rabbit while they go back into the Suburban and have sex. Behind Joe, Sergei appears and fires at the two with a silenced gun. Before he can reach Rabbit, Joe stabs Sergei and takes his gun. Blood rushes out of Sergei's back, attracting the decomposed walking corpses of Slater, La Roca, Pikowski, and Hackman. They capture Joe and drag him to the road, where they pound his back into the asphalt with a jackhammer. While screaming at Nick and Mary to get out of the Suburban, Rabbit takes the silencer off the gun and fires at the zombies, alerting everyone else. The team battles the undead with no effect, and they escape the area. Jack stays behind to slow the zombies and uses the stolen Jeep to escape but crashes.\nJack wakes up in a cave next to a native, explaining that he found him and brought him here. He tells him that he must restore peace to the cursed road because haunted spirits still walk it. A confused Jack thanks the man and leaves. Nick leaves to smoke in the Suburban. He slowly falls asleep until Slater slams his fingers off with the car door and slams his head with a sledgehammer. He travels along the road until he sees the two vehicles with their tires melted at a ruined drive-in theatre and reunites with the rest of the group.\nThe group goes to check in on Nick while Rabbit stays handcuffed to a pole and stomps a Scorpion, exposing much blood. Rabbit turns around to see Pikowski's zombie swinging a pickaxe at him and missing. Rabbit manages to pull the pole out and escape with Pikowski not following. He catches up with the group and sees that Nick is missing. Rabbit thinks and establishes that the zombies can only travel on the road and concrete/cement and appear from underground. Jack spots an old telephone booth and successfully dials 911, connecting with Sheriff Conaway. Jack gives him the number of the Los Angeles Marshal\u2019s office and tells him to call the office and request backup. He agrees and hangs up.\nAfter four hours of waiting, Jack has another flashback and sees his father, Slater, Hackman, and Pikowski working on a road. Hackman pulls out a knife and attempts to escape while John hides under a machine and tries to stay away from the trouble. The escape fails, and the unseen police officer in charge makes them start digging a large hole. Hearing sirens, they spot Sheriff Conaway and his deputies, Tim and Gill. Jack and Rabbit go to the bathroom stall while Conaway and his officers hold everyone else at gunpoint. Conaway demands to know where Jack is, only to hear that Jack is dead. Conaway shoots Mary in order to make P.T. tell them that Jack and Rabbit are in the stall. Tim and Gil grab Rabbit, wearing Jack's badge, to confuse them and bring him outside. Jack draws Gil out and points a gun at his head when he enters his truck.\nThey drive further away, and Jack handcuffs Gil to the truck and breaks his nose. He begs him not to stay on the road, stating the zombies kill anything on the road. Jack asks why when the four zombies rise again and start approaching. Gil uncuffs himself but is too late as they knock him down and kill him with the jackhammer. Jack drives back, and Conaway goes to the truck, thinking Gil is in it, and P.T. fights Tim who drops his shotgun but is able to shoot P.T. in the stomach with his pistol. Rabbit picks up the shotgun and shoots Tim, saying, \"There's a new Marshal in town.\" Jack punches Conaway multiple times and restrains him to the SUV. Conaway starts bleeding and asks where his son is. Jack doesn't reply, and Conaway slowly realizes that the zombies put him in the road.\nHe explains that they travel under the road and feed on blood to stay strong, or they cannot rise from underground, and that blood awakens them. Jack wonders how Conaway knows so much about the zombies and has a final flashback. The unseen boss is Sheriff Conaway, put in charge of the gang. Though La Roca didn't assist in the attempted escape, he is knocked unconscious and thrown into the hole dug by the three others. Conaway and his men open fire at the convicts in their legs, keeping them alive and preventing them from moving out of the hole. Conaway plans to tell the warden that there was an accident and the convicts were caught under the roller. He starts the steam roller and buries the four men alive. Conaway and his thugs learn about the zombies' return, and they kill anyone who sets foot on the road to cover up the crime and the zombies.\nJack finally realizes this and continuously yells at and brutally punches at Conaway. Conaway begs him not to be in the road. Suddenly, the zombies arrive. They pin Jack down, and Conaway tries to enter the SUV, but Rabbit knocks him out. He and Steph are unable to kill the zombies by gunfire as the jackhammer is brought up. Jack looks at John and yells with sympathy that he is his son. After seconds, John suddenly snaps and pushes the jackhammer into Slater's stomach, destroying his spirit and body. He then kills Hackman with the jackhammer, which stops working. Pikowski hits John multiple times with the hammer until he loses too much blood energy. Jack cuts his hand with a knife and embraces it into his father's hand. With enough energy, John thanks his son and chokes Pikowski, killing him.\nJohn tears off his dog tag and gives it to Jack. John walks onto the dirt and crosses the afterlife into Heaven, finally lifting the curse on Route 666. Conaway emerges from the SUV and tries to shoot them, but Jack, Steph, and Rabbit shoot him everywhere. He falls barely stable to the ground and has an unseen vision of an even larger steam roller (as the Grim Reaper) coming towards him. He shoots at it with no effect, and it crushes him. Jack, Steph, and Rabbit walk alone along Route 666 to head to the Arizona/California border as Jack finally pieces together what the native said to him. With Sheriff Conaway and his thugs dead, Route 666 is now peaceful once more.

They enable the two captives' escape, in which they inadvertently kill Stinking Lizard's pet rabbit, prompting the Shoshone chief to declare war on them and unbury a folding chair in lieu of a hatchet.\nTo gather the other parts of the map, Abahachi and Ranger travel across the land to meet with Winnetouch on his all-pink ranch-turned-beauty-plaza, the Powder Rose Ranch. Winnetouch remembers who Abahachi gave the other map pieces to, setting Abahachi and Ranger on Uschi's and Dimitri's trail. The trio notices Santa Maria's gang surrounding them, so Winnetouch dresses up as Abahachi to distract them while Abahachi and Ranger ride off to gather the other pieces of the map. Knowing they are short on time, they decide to split up; Abahachi goes to find Dimitri, while Ranger seeks out Uschi. Meanwhile, Winnetouch is captured and held at the Powder Rose Ranch under Hombre's watch, but the two grow closer as they spend time together.\nJust as Uschi, whom Ranger finds as a singer in a bar, gets ready to give Ranger her piece of the map, Santa Maria finds and captures them. When the two of them don't show up at the meeting point, Abahachi and Dimitri, whom Abahachi found as the proprietor of a dingy bar, decide to go rescue them. During the rescue attempt Abahachi gets captured as well, bringing Santa Maria in possession of all the map pieces. He takes off with his gang to head for the treasure, taking Uschi with him since she tattooed the map on her back (and because he has taken an interest in her), leaving the others tied up in the ranch house which he sets on fire. However, before they burn to death, Dimitri comes to their rescue.\nSanta Maria finds the mountain in which the treasure is hidden and goes inside, leaving his gang to guard the entrance. Abahachi, Winnetouch and Ranger manage to save Uschi and convince Hombre to join them. While Dimitri distracts the rest of the gang, the others go after Santa Maria. They get the treasure, a diamond necklace, from Santa Maria, who triggers and drowns in a mud trap. In the ensuing shenanigans, they lose the necklace, and upon their exit of the mountain they find themselves surrounded by the Shoshone and Santa Maria's gang. In the subsequent fight, Santa Maria's gang is defeated. Hombre clears Abahachi's name and returns the embezzled gold to Stinking Lizard, ending the hostilities.\nIn the end, each character realizes their dream and Uschi, while pregnant with her and Ranger's child, urges him to set off with Abahachi, and both heroes ride into the sunset for new adventures.", "tmdb_id": 8366}, "3718903": {"title": "Scooby-Doo and the Cyber Chase", "plot": "Mystery Inc. visits their old friend and college student, Eric, who has invited them to see a prize-winning computer game he made based on their adventures and a high-tech laser, both of which intends to enter at a campus science fair.

The men begin their job, and Mike discovers a box containing nine audio-taped sessions that were recorded with Mary Hobbes, a patient who suffered from dissociative identity disorder. Mike begins listening to the tapes in the ensuing days. In the sessions, Mary's psychologist attempts to unveil details surrounding a crime she committed at her home two decades prior and Mary exhibits numerous personalities who have unique voices and demeanors. Meanwhile, Hank discovers a cache of antique silver dollar coins and other valuables from the crematory. Late that night, Hank returns to the hospital to retrieve the items, and discovers a lobotomy pick among them. He becomes frightened by noises and a shadowy figure, and is confronted by an unknown assailant.\nHank fails to show up to work the next day. An additional worker, Craig McManus, is hired to take his place.

Mike restores the electricity and continues listening to the ninth session tape, which reveals that one of Mary's malignant personalities, \"Simon,\" was responsible for Mary stabbing her little brother and parents to death. Phil finds Gordon in Mary's former hospital room, staring at photos from his daughter's baptism which he has pasted to the wall. Jeff emerges from the tunnels and is attacked by an unseen assailant at the company van.\nThe following day, Gordon arrives at the hospital and finds Hank wrapped in plastic sheeting in one of the rooms, the lobotomy pick protruding from his eye. Gordon is then confronted by Phil, who repeatedly tells him to \"wake up\" before vanishing in front of him. Craig witnesses Gordon standing over Hank, who is barely alive. Gordon attacks Craig before pulling the lobotomy pick from Hank's eye and stabbing it into Craig\u2032s. Gordon, in a dissociated state, finds the bodies of each of his crew members in various rooms in the hospital, and recounts his murdering each of them. He also recalls killing Wendy, his daughter, and the dog after Wendy spilled the boiling water on him.\nDistraught, Gordon confusedly attempts to call his home to apologize to Wendy.

Gowtham, then, turns his eye on the annual bullock race in which Chandru is taking part, by loosening the wheels on Chandru's cart to cause a serious accident and frame Padmini as the culprit, thus creating a wedge between Chandru and Aravind. Unfortunately for Gowtham, Aravind decides to take part in the race in Chandru's place since Chandru is to be married, and manages to win despite using the broken bullock cart.\nChandru accuses Padmini of trying to kill him. Padmini threatens to leave the house if Aravind remains friends with Chandru and does not throw him out of the house. Aravind then reveals to her that he had accidentally killed Chandru's deaf-and-dumb younger brother (Master Abhinai) when they were children, which traumatized him so much that he never told anyone about it. Since then, he has been looking out for Chandru out of the guilt that he had no one else in his life anymore. Gowtham overhears their conversation and tells Chandru about it to anger him. Chandru fights with Aravind, breaks their friendship, and leaves the house. Aravind tries to convince Chandru to return and marry Amrita, even if he cannot repair their friendship. However, in the process, Aravind falls from a cliff and seemingly dies. Although Chandru tries to save Aravind, he blames himself for Aravind's fall. Chandru later realizes that his brother was accidentally killed and that Aravind was not intentionally at fault.\nFive years later, Chandru is a Major in the Indian Army and has never returned to Aravind's home since his supposed death. He receives a letter from Kimoo stating that Aravind is not dead, but in a vegetative state, not responding to anyone and only sitting in a corner. Chandru immediately leaves for Aravind's house, where he also learns that Aravind and Padmini have a young son whose name is Chandru, in tribute to their friendship. Meanwhile, Gowtham, who has been torturing Padmini and Amrita since Aravind went into the vegetative state, finds out that Chandru has returned and beats him up. On hearing Chandru's cries, Aravind wakes up from his coma state and subdues Gowtham and his goons.

As thanks for freeing him, the Green-Eyed One asks John what he needs. John requests milk for his daughter, and the Green-Eyed One grants his wish. John then asks to have his wife back, calling Josephine his Queen, but the Green-Eyed One cannot resurrect the dead. However, he says he can give John a Queen, and John suddenly finds himself a king with his own kingdom.\nSince the Green-Eyed One is obligated to fulfill John's wishes, he pays a visit to Elspeth, his hideous spellcasting sister. He transforms her into a beautiful young woman who can now marry John and become his queen and Snow White's stepmother. The creature also provides Elspeth with a magical mirror that allows her to see others unseen and to deceive John. As years pass, Elspeth forms a good relationship with her new husband and stepdaughter, now a beautiful sixteen-year-old princess. However, Elspeth is vain and keeps a room full of magical mirrors which assure her each day that she is the fairest of them all whenever she asks.\nWhen Prince Alfred arrives in the kingdom and falls in love with Snow White, Elspeth is furious to discover that images of Snow White are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is the fairest of them all. Driven with jealousy, Elspeth orders a hunter, Hector, to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume.

When Elspeth learns that Snow White is still alive, she prepares a poisoned apple and transforms into Snow White's deceased mother, Josephine, with the magic mirror the Green-Eyed One gave her. Aided by Monday, who is turned into a garden gnome afterward, Elspeth (disguised as Josephine) finds Snow White and convinces her to eat the enchanted and poisoned apple, which seemingly kills Snow White.\nWith her task finished, Elspeth tries to use the mirror to become the Queen again but she instead reverts to her true form, even more loathsome than before. The Green-Eyed One appears and reveals that her evil deed has cost Elspeth her beauty. Meanwhile, the dwarfs, unable to revive Snow White, place her in a coffin of ice and leave her near Monday's statue.

Heading towards his 30s, Sol aims to become an actor and to hit it big in Hollywood, but like many others, he has not been able to catch a break or a role in anything. Outside of acting, Sol's socializing has made him both somewhat famous around guys and infamous amongst women in LA, for his larger than life party wild ways with the former and constant one night stands with the latter. He lives in an uptown bungalow with his friend and roommate Justin, and the constant crew of friends in his life consists of the working and consummate Justin, Cooper; a slick playboy (and possible metrosexual in the closet), Happy; his easygoing drifting well-endowed cowboy cousin who comes into town now and then; and Chloe, his only female best friend who works as a waitress and attends college. \nAfter a one night stand with Tammie, a \"low end\" girl in the social scene, Sol realizes he has run out of money to pay his share of the rent, and Justin has to reprimand him for not having a job and the possibility that he will have to grow up. Sol's situation is further compounded when visiting his parents, who give him a \"sit down\", confronting him about his lack of responsibility, all while refusing to issue him rent money. At work, Justin is singled out for a promotion from mail room duty, to become the assistant of the bossy and snappy female Hollywood agent Bernie \"Best\", and his off hours are devoted to his controlling and manipulative fiancee, Brenda. \nOne day, Happy comes into town to see Sol, stating that his time off is thanks to he and his lover taking time off from their relationship, something that Sol refers to as \"a hall pass\". When Happy comes along with Sol for an audition, Sol's agent proceeds to hire Happy for a Levi Jeans commercial and drops Sol behind his back. At the end of his rope with this turn of events, his rent due and eviction nearing, and his car being towed away, Sol again turns to trying to pull a one night stand to ease his frustrations, but is forced to hitch with Tammy when no other options are available. Meanwhile, Justin is forced to perform demeaning and menial tasks as Bernie's assistant and endure the brunt of her abuse, from picking up the feces of Bernie's dog, being the receiving end of her verbal abuse, forced to run incredibly petty errands for her, and put into high pressure jobs that test his patience. During a day out with his friends, Brenda reveals she wants Justin to move in with her, and issues a reluctant Justin the ultimatum of choosing time with his friends or her.\nThe morning after, Tammy confronts Sol about how she is called for nothing but sex between them, and implores and coerces Sol into taking her out on a date.

The date turns out to be a very awkward affair that ends with Tammy being the one wanting to engage in a purely sexual relationship with Sol, and perturbed, Sol ditches her when she awaits for him in the women's bathroom. During a night out afterwards, Sol sees Chloe share drinks with Happy on a date, while Justin gets drunk and engages with a fling with an old acquaintance, both of them discussing Brenda's notorious reputation. The next day, Sol confronts Happy about Chloe, whom the latter can tell that Sol has deeper feelings for, while Justin is caught in bed by Brenda. Unable to state anything but how the fling \"just naturally happened\", Brenda bitterly breaks off the engagement, which Justin indifferently lets pass on.\nWith the awkward date shaking him up and getting to realize how unstable things are, Sol attempts to get his life in order. He applies for numerous jobs at a placement center, from golf range tender, paperboy, and even out of his agent's \"mercy\", a sewage maintenance worker, but none are anything he can stand or be competent in. Sol then invites Chloe to their hangout spot, and confesses how they are both everything they are looking for in love, but despite him realizing the signs this time around, Chloe's reception is mixed due to his initial boundaries that she is just to strictly be \"a friend\" and how she is still in a relationship with Happy, leaving their future together uncertain. Justin meanwhile gains the confidence to stand up to Bernie, which has her reveal that her tempestuous attitude and demeaning tasks were meant to test him to see if he had what it took to be an agent, which he passed.

Later that year, Eads makes his last appearance at the Southern Comfort Conference in Atlanta, Georgia, a prominent transgender gathering. Already feeling ill, he addresses a crowd of 500 and takes Lola to what is for them a prom that never was. Shortly after the conference, Eads dies in a nursing home with his chosen family beside him.\nAfter Eads' death, his ashes were spread across the family farm around a lone Christmas tree which was to symbolize Robert's many changes and blossomings in life.\nEads' friends, Tom and Debbie King, also appear in the film. They saved Eads' life when he collapsed in a pool of his own blood while staying with them. They initially sought treatment for Eads but were unable to locate a doctor willing to treat a transgender man.\nEads' lifelong struggle to have his outer appearance match his inner self is a salient theme in the movie.

The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learns that its asset Tom Bishop has been arrested at a People's Liberation Army prison in Suzhou and will be executed in 24 hours, unless the U.S. government claims him and bargains for his release. Bishop's actions, unsanctioned by the CIA, risk jeopardizing the agreement. A group of CIA executives summon Nathan D. Muir, a veteran case officer and Bishop's mentor, who plans to retire from the Agency at the end of the day. While purportedly interviewing Muir to learn his history with Bishop, the executives seek a pretext for not intervening on Bishop's imprisonment. Unknown to them, Muir was tipped off about Bishop's capture by fellow CIA veteran Harry Duncan in Hong Kong.\nMuir leaks the story to CNN through an MI6 contact, Digby 'Digger' Gibson in Hong Kong, believing that public pressure would force American intervention. They are stalled briefly before a phone call to the FCC from Deputy Director for Operations Charles Harker results in CNN retracting the story as a hoax. Muir met Bishop in 1975, when Bishop was a United States Marine Corps Scout Sniper during the Vietnam War. Muir gives Bishop a mission to eliminate a high-ranking North Vietnamese military officer. Bishop and his spotter Tran are able to assassinate the target despite being compromised, though Bishop takes out a pursuing enemy attack chopper. Bishop escorts the now wounded Tran to safety, impressing Muir. In 1976, Muir recruited Bishop as a CIA asset in Berlin, where Bishop was tasked with procuring assets in East Germany. Then he discusses Bishop's spy work in Beirut in 1985, during the War of the Camps, which was their last mission together.\nIn a series of flashbacks, Bishop is troubled by Muir's conviction that civilian \"assets\" who endangered a mission should be sacrificed to preserve the \"greater good.\" After Bishop attempts to countermand Muir during a mission to save the life of an asset, Muir emphasizes that he will not tolerate dissent, and would not rescue Bishop if he was captured going \"off the reservation\". During a mission in Lebanon, Bishop, posing as a photojournalist, meets relief worker Elizabeth Hadley. While using her to connect with an asset for the mission, they became romantically involved. Muir distrusts Hadley, and reveals to Bishop that she was exiled from the United Kingdom. Hadley later confesses to Bishop that she was involved in the bombing of a Chinese building in Britain, which was supposed to be empty but contained Chinese nationals. Bishop reveals to Hadley his true identity. Muir elects again to sacrifice a civilian asset for the sake of their mission, and Bishop cuts professional ties with Muir. Muir, fearing that Hadley could threaten the Agency and potentially Bishop, makes a deal with the Chinese, exchanging Hadley in return for an arrested U.S. diplomat. Chinese agents kidnap Hadley, and a Dear John letter is forged and left for Bishop.\nIn the present, Muir realizes that Bishop went to China for Hadley. In a series of misdirections, he forges a directive signed by the Director of Central Intelligence to begin \"Operation Dinner Out\", a rescue mission spearheaded by a SEAL team that Bishop had developed as a \"Plan B\" for his own attempt at rescuing Hadley. Using $282,000 of his life savings and a misappropriated file on Chinese coastline satellite imagery, Muir enlists Duncan to assist him in bribing a Chinese energy official to cut power to the prison for 30 minutes, during which time the SEAL rescue team will retrieve Bishop and Hadley. Harker is suspicious that Muir is working against the CIA, but when he confronts Muir before the gathered executives, Muir \"confesses\" to unprofessionally using company resources to gather information about his intended retirement home, which he has distorted the evidence to support. Bishop is rescued along with Hadley, and surmises that Muir was responsible for saving him when he hears the helicopter pilot refer to \"Operation Dinner Out\", which was also the code name for an operation Bishop used to get a birthday gift for Muir while they were in Lebanon.

The house is attacked by Ninja Thumb-Thumbs, and Felix is captured while the children escape alone on the submarine, the NIX Super Guppy, set to auto-pilot to a safe house.\nAt the safe house, the children accept that their parents were spies and decide to rescue them. Inside Floop's castle, he introduces his latest creation, small child-shaped robots, to Mr. Lisp. They plan to replace the world leaders' children with these super-strong robots to control the world. The androids have no artificial intelligence yet, so they can't function outside of their regular programming. Lisp is furious, demanding usable androids.\nFloop, with his second-in-command Alexander Minion, interrogates Gregorio and Ingrid about 'The Third Brain'. Ingrid knows nothing of it, while Gregorio claims he had destroyed the brain years ago. After Floop leaves, Gregorio reveals to Ingrid that the Third Brain was a secret OSS project he had worked on: an AI brain with all the skills of the entire OSS. The project was scrapped as being too dangerous, but Gregorio didn't want to destroy the final prototype.\nAt the safe house, Carmen and Juni are visited by OSS agent Ms. Gradenko. Giving Carmen a bracelet as a sign of trust, she asks about the Third Brain, but she doesn't know anything. Gradenko orders the house to be dismantled, and Juni sees Ninja Thumbs outside destroying the submarine because she works for Floop. With Gradenko's intentions revealed, Juni accidentally exposes the Third Brain, and a BuddyPack chase ensues. Carmen gets the brain, and she and Juni escape.

With it, Floop can achieve his goal, but he wishes to continue his children's show. Minion has different plans and takes over, locking Floop inside his \"virtual room\", the chamber where he films his television series. Carmen and Juni receive reluctant help from Gregorio's estranged brother Isador \"Machete\" Cortez when they show up at his spy shop. He refuses to accompany them, so they steal some gear and take his spy plane, the RX Express, to fly to Floop's castle. After a few mishaps, Carmen and Juni eject themselves from the plane before it crashes into the castle, and they enter via the underwater entrance.\nWhile their children infiltrate the castle, Juni rescues Floop who helps him and Carmen release their parents.

Despite the fact that he is clearly one credit short of graduating, after four hours Alec convinces the college that he indeed has the credit and is set to graduate. The four of them have to move out of their apartment and proceed to work book buy back day, an event at college that lets students buy and sell used textbooks. The movie shows them repeatedly stealing some of the books and then selling them back to the book buyer in a smooth and elegant manner, as though they have done this many times. They also visit their favorite bar, Rennie's Landing, one last time. Casey asks Sam at one point why nothing has ever happened between the two of them, but she brushes him off and just tells him \"don't.\"\nThe movie then picks up a year after they have graduated from college. Alec, the main character, is working as the secretary for a producer who he hates. Sam is in a dead end relationship and working at a Mexican restaurant in Salt Lake City, Utah. Casey is working as a coach for a girls' soccer team.

He has also spent most of their money without her knowing. Consequently, Casey was coming to visit as this happens and he and Sam leave to visit Alec and Trevor, who are now roommates. During the visit, Alec is diagnosed with a brain tumor, a fact that he conceals from his friends. Casey reconnects with a woman he used to date and who had had his baby without his support. Upon learning that the child died before his fifth birthday, Casey visits the child's grave and says that he's more responsible than he used to be, and he's ready to be a father now.\nThe four friends visit a convenience store, which Alec attempts to rob on a whim. This alarms his friends, who demand some kind of explanation, which he fails to provide. He then takes a long walk and decides that they all must take control of their lives. His solution to their problems is obvious in his mind; he wants them to rob a bank. At first his friends are skeptical, but they're all gradually shown how meticulous Alec has been about details; he had the whole thing planned down to the minute, but stresses that any slip up will cost them time and potentially cause them to fail the mission.

Sam wants to run away with Casey, who wants to help an immigrant woman and her daughter stay in the country, Trevor wants to go to Fiji, and Alec's plans aren't really clear.\nThe gang then don their disguises and proceed to rob the bank.  The robbery is successful in that they find a larger amount than expected, $5 million. They steal the cash and successfully get out of the bank, splitting up according to their plan, except Alec inadvertently knocks over a jar of pennies that he brought into the bank with him as a distraction for the bank manager and security guard. The jar shatters and its contents spill out all over the floor. Realizing he does not have time to recover the jar's contents, Alec leaves it behind. Casey and Sam meet up at a restaurant called The Outlaws, the agreed-upon meeting point.  They are joined by Trevor, and the three wait nervously for Alec, who is late.  A television news broadcast in the bar states that the police have recovered a very good lead.  Stuffed among the jar of pennies that Alec unintentionally left behind at the bank was a Rennie's Landing badge that Trevor was playing with innocently earlier in the film. The badge has Trevor's full name on it.  Using this lead, the police issue a broadcast alert for Trevor, who had just used his credit card at the restaurant to pay for their drinks. The bartender calls the police, who surround the bar. Casey is stopped leaving the bar. Sam goes to the ladies' room.  Trevor comes outside to join Casey and sees that he is surrounded. He reaches into his back pocket for his keys, but the police (thinking he is reaching for a gun) fire on Trevor and Casey, instantly killing Trevor and mortally wounding Casey.  Sam, hearing the commotion, exits the ladies' room using a back window. As she inches around the bar, she sees Trevor dead and Casey lying on the ground. He looks up at her and realizes she can still escape. When the police ask a dying Casey if anyone else is still inside, he says no, then dies.\nWatching all of this from a distance is Alec, who was running late but had showed up at the meeting point to join his friends.

He will be responsible for driving prostitutes Tess (Emma Nooyen) and Lulu (Luanne Gordon) to their jobs. The madam, Janelle, reveals that Daddy owns the brothel.

Daddy then gives Jack a haircut while offering him a bet of $15,000 on the tournament. Jack protests that they don't have that kind of money but Daddy says that they can work out a payment plan. Feeling intimidated, Jack agrees to the bet.\nThe next morning at breakfast Jack breaks the news to the other two that their next match will be against \"Caller\" (Neville Stevenson), and he remarks that the only way they have a hope is if they win the toss. Sara tells Karen that she's not sure if she can go through with their plan. Karen's ex-boyfriend Hugh and his friend turn up and Sara leaves. She meets Thomas at the Bucket Fountain on Cuba Street, where they agree to take their relationship to the next level (being boyfriend and girlfriend).\nThe next evening, Wayne rescues Lulu from a fat, drunken customer, who has passed out on top of her. He invites her to come and watch him play pool to cheer her up, and takes her home to get his cue. However, he finds that Tess, who had been living with him temporarily, has stolen most of his stuff. He explodes in a fit of anger, starts drinking and tells Lulu that Caller is too good and they can't beat him. After some encouragement from Lulu, he agrees to play.\nCaller, it turns out, is a pierced, bare-chested pool player with dreadlocks who gets his nickname from calling his shots. Wayne turns up drunk and announces to Thomas and Jack that he will play Caller. Jack objects, knowing that he is the only one who has a chance at winning, but Holden states that since Wayne has stepped up, he has to play. In a \"drunken master\" style, Wayne runs the table and beats Caller, who never gets a single shot. As Holden mentioned earlier in the film, New Zealand pub rules require a player who loses a game without sinking any of his balls to drop his trousers. Caller appears to comply with the rule, but then punches Wayne in the face. In the resulting fight, Jack's hand is cut. Holden, backed up by two of Daddy's thugs wielding machetes, forces Caller to drop his trousers.\nDue to Jack's injury, he is barely able to play pool, meaning that Thomas and Wayne will have to play in the semi-finals.

He buys them matching jackets to wear to the finals.\nAt the semi-finals, Holden announces that their opponent is \"Bastinados\", who turn out to be Sara and Karen.

They are in a creative writing class taught by a well known black author, Mr. Scott (Robert Wisdom). Marcus has written an amateurish story about the effect of Vi's love on his medical condition, and she encourages him to share it in the class's workshop. While other students give it tepid praise, Mr. Scott and his favorite student, Catherine, harshly dismiss it as mediocre trash. Upset, Marcus angrily blames Vi for not warning him against sharing the story, and breaks up with her, accusing her of being secretly attracted to Mr. Scott. A hurt and heartbroken Vi goes out to a bar and encounters Mr. Scott. She thanks him for being honest about Marcus's story, praises his writing, and asks if he thinks she will make a great writer; he tells her that he does not.

Though he originally intends to make a film about the experiences of teenagers post-Columbine on a wide scale, he is eventually forced to limit his scope to one dysfunctional, upper-middle-class suburban New Jersey family and their teenage son Scooby (Mark Webber). His father, the strict and unsympathetic Marty (John Goodman), is frustrated with Scooby's lazy attitude and unwillingness to attend college, while his football player brother Brady worries that Scooby is secretly gay and his obnoxious youngest brother Mikey is obliviously self-obsessed. Scooby's only vague ambition is to be famous, and have a talk show on television like his idol Conan O'Brien, who appears to him in a dream sequence as Scooby allows a love-struck friend to perform oral sex on him. Scooby intentionally flunks his exams, but to his surprise, he finds that he has been accepted to Princeton University, which Marty privately reveals was because of a large donation from a family member.\nMeanwhile, Mikey torments the family's overworked, underpaid, and exhausted housekeeper, Consuelo, exercising his privileged and sheltered upbringing to badger her with questions that emphasize the discrepancy between their lifestyles. She reveals that she is still poor, has no time for any personal activities due to the constant demands from the family, and that her beloved grandson has been executed after being arrested for rape and murder. The self-centered Mikey only continues ordering her around. Later, Brady suffers a serious accident during football practice and falls into a deep coma. Mikey takes advantage of Marty's vulnerability over Brady's condition to perform hypnotism on him, during which he commands himself to be Marty's new favorite son and orders Marty to fire Consuelo for petty reasons. Miraculously, the hypnosis works perfectly. Marty fires Consuelo despite her tearful pleading, much to Mikey's smug enjoyment.\nAfter the documentary is finished and Toby refuses to let him see the completed footage, Scooby secretly attends a late-night screening, where he witnesses the audience laughing uproariously at his dim-witted portrayal. Realizing that he will never be famous, Scooby is left devastated. While he is away, a vengeful Consuelo sneaks back into the house and murders the rest of the Livingstons by poisoning the house with carbon monoxide.

With no spare landing craft, Lowell, the pilot of the Ares, returns to Earth with it.\nIt will take 26 months for Lowell to send a rescue ship from Earth, but the stranded landing crew have supplies for less than a year and need to find ways to extend the life support system. The main problem is the thermoelectric power generator, since air and water recycling require electrical power. Since the lander is damaged beyond repair, it no longer requires fuel, and Sagan (the mission geologist) proposes to use what is left to power an improvised silicate reactor to produce methane and water vapor from the Martian soil. They try to build it, but the landing engines and propellant tanks prove to be too damaged to salvage.\nThe landing crew tries to find ways to save electrical power, but even draconian measures will only extend the life of the generator to fourteen months. The required lifetime can be attained only if the crew is reduced to two astronauts. Sanchez, the new commander, decides that she, Sagan and Rodrigo should abandon the craft, since their specialist skills are less important to the survival of the mission. They don their spacesuits and walk to the edge of the Valles Marineris valley, not far from the crash site. Recent radar scans from the orbiter reveal a maze-like structure hidden below a thick cloud of water vapor in the Valles Marineris.

They find that the air pressure and oxygen content in some of the tunnels is just like that on Earth. Rodrigo dies when accidentally entering a tunnel with no atmosphere, but Sanchez manages to contact the two astronauts still at the lander, who have meanwhile discovered that they are gradually losing air pressure and have realised that there must be an air leak somewhere.

They particularly enjoy tormenting fellow trooper Rodney Farva, a cocky and overzealous officer who has been suspended from the road for an unspecified incident.\nThe troopers, led by Captain John O'Hagen, are called to investigate an abandoned Winnebago off the highway, only to find the Spurbury police have already arrived: by claiming the investigation, the Spurbury police chief, Bruce Grady, hopes to force the closure of the troopers' station, thereby securing increased funding for his agency. The animosity leads to a brawl between the assembled officers, during which the body of a murdered woman is discovered inside the Winnebago. The troopers observe a tattoo on the dead woman depicting a monkey. During a routine traffic stop of a semi truck shortly after, Foster and Womack discover a large shipment of marijuana marked with stickers depicting the same monkey. The troopers suspect the dead woman and the marijuana are related, but Chief Grady laughs off the claim and refuses Captain O'Hagen's suggestion that the troopers and local police cooperate on the investigation.\nFoster begins a relationship with Spurbury police officer Ursula Hanson and, while attempting to have sex with her in the now-impounded Winnebago, discovers hidden bundles of marijuana, all bearing the same monkey sticker. Foster conspires with Ursula, who hates her coworkers and is stuck manning the front desk, to reveal the bust at an upcoming visit by the governor, thereby proving the troopers' suspicions and embarrassing the local police. Meanwhile, Farva is reinstated to patrol and partnered with an exasperated Ramathorn. However, Farva attacks a restaurant cashier and is arrested by the Spurbury police. Chief Grady offers Farva a job with his department in exchange for information about the drug investigation, but Farva refuses. Farva is subsequently reprimanded by an infuriated O'Hagen, who re-suspends Farva.\nThe governor arrives in Spurbury; Ramathorn and Foster break into the police impound and steal the Winnebago, planning to reveal the marijuana discovered by Foster at a press conference. They barely make it in time, only to discover the marijuana has already been seized by the Spurbury police, with Chief Grady claiming credit. Foster accuses Ursula of revealing the location of the marijuana in exchange for a favorable assignment. Having nothing to show for their efforts, the state troopers expect their station to be shut down.\nBack at the station, the troopers find Farva dressed in a Spurbury police uniform; Foster realizes that it was Farva, not Ursula, who betrayed the location of the marijuana. The troopers, including Captain O'Hagen, handcuff Farva to a toilet and drunkenly vandalize Chief Grady's house.  Ursula offers to help the troopers get back at Grady, and tips them off to intercept a drug-running truck. As they attempt to pursue it, the troopers encounter an escaped Farva, who holds them at gunpoint and berates them for not taking him seriously as a cop. O'Hagen intervenes and the troopers convince Farva to help them stop the drug smugglers. Following the truck to a nearby airfield, the troopers observe it being loaded with marijuana from a Canadian-marked plane. Chief Grady and several Spurbury officers then arrive, and the troopers realize that the local police are running protection for the smugglers. After creating a diversion, the troopers brawl with the Spurbury officers and smugglers, ultimately arresting them.\nSome days later, the governor sends Captain O'Hagen a letter thanking him for his efforts, but telling him the station will still be shut down.

The meticulous attention that Taghv\u0101'i has given to the accurate representation of even the most mundane aspects of the film would at first sight seem to be at odds with the fact that with the exception of the opening and closing scenes, in all other scenes where the clock on the wall of the sitting room is in sight, its pendulum is conspicuously motionless. The opening scene depicts some moments before the family starts a very active day (the day at which the two children of the family, Shangul and Mangul, have their first school-day after the summer school-holiday) and the closing scene, the end of a protracted Friday night, during which Jah\u0101ngir and Roy\u0101 have spent an intellectually and emotionally exhausting night. The motionless pendulum suggests that the events in the intervening period have taken place out of time, or only in imagination. Although the work presented by Taghv\u0101'i certainly qualifies as a surrealist art-form, this motionless pendulum serves as a more profound tool than a means that solely hints at surrealism. Taghv\u0101'i conveys a number of unobtrusive verbal and visual messages to his viewers. Briefly, Taghv\u0101'i and Ms Minoo Farsh'chi, the co-author of the film script, variously refer to the theory of eternal recurrence, as revived by e.g. Friedrich Nietzsche, with a strong emphasis on the importance of having a creative mind thereby to forge room for free will in at least an imaginative world.Jah\u0101ngir is a draughtsman, or perhaps an architect. Roy\u0101 is normally a housewife, but has recently started to attend a course on writing film scripts, an undertaking that has been actively encouraged by Jah\u0101ngir. Taghv\u0101'i introduces his viewers  to Roy\u0101's penchant for story telling through a scene in which she tells a bedtime story for Shangul and Magul, the story being in reality a popular Persian children's story which is very reminiscent of The Wolf and the Seven Young Kids. This scene also reveals the two children as being both imaginative and highly theatrical. The names Shangul and Magul are the names of two baby goats in the same story; there is no hint in the film however that Shangul and Magul might be the pet names of the children, as opposed to their real names.\nJah\u0101ngir is working on a project that he apparently has initially introduced to Roy\u0101 as being a villa on an island, but that Roy\u0101 has later discovered that it is a prison compound on the island. Following an intense argument between Jah\u0101ngir and Roy\u0101, Jah\u0101ngir reveals that he himself is deeply unhappy about his project, as his colleagues have nicknamed the prison compound as Jah\u0101ngir's Villa. An apparently innocuous argument between Jah\u0101ngir and Roy\u0101, married already for twelve years, thus leads to an intense and emotional flow of exchanges revolving around the subject matter of how well even closest individuals know each other and the reason why Jah\u0101ngir reacts nervously to Roy\u0101's curiosity regarding his  past. The deliberately ambiguous circumstance in which the intense discussion between Roy\u0101 and Jah\u0101ngir takes place, greatly enhances the power of the words exchanged between the two characters. On the one hand, one is given the impression that Roy\u0101 is curious because she is preparing her first film script for her class and that she must be using her husband's character in her story. On the other hand, while Jah\u0101ngir appears to be disconcerted, one cannot escape the suspicion that he may in fact be a willing participant in the creation of the script that Roy\u0101 is in the process of creating. Jah\u0101ngir never fails to ease the tension by using his dark humour when the going gets tough. It has been speculated that what one is witnessing is the film, or at least a rehearsal of it, is actually based on the script written by Roy\u0101, with all the members of the family playing their allotted roles.The philosophical messages of the film are mostly conveyed by the professor of literature (Jamshid Mashayekhi) who teaches the course that Roy\u0101 attends. His reflective manners and insightful statements convincingly portray him as a wise academic who has lived a profound life. In a pivotal scene, while being driven by Roy\u0101 to his home, in the vicinity of \"the end of the world\", he says:\n\n\"This world in which we live is not fit for working. Before I and you everything in it has already been invented. The world of your story is a kind of a world that you have to create yourself; if you want it to revolve on its axis, it must revolve by your will; when you want the sun to shine, it must shine, and when you do not want it to shine, it must disappear behind the clouds; when you want that it rains, the rain must descend from the sky; if you don't wish that it rains, wish it, and the rain will stop.\"\n\nIn the one but the penultimate scene of the film, N\u0101ser Taghv\u0101'i introduces a visual metaphor, indicative of the intimacy between a husband and wife. This metaphor, which consists of a knife falling from the table to the ground and subsequently being simultaneously retrieved by Jah\u0101ngir and Roy\u0101, with the former grasping the handle of the knife firmly in his fist, and the latter fixing her fingers on the sides of the blade. Of note is the fact that in the motion pictures made in Iran men and women are not permitted to have physical contact.", "tmdb_id": 373624}, "3332886": {"title": "The Unsaid", "plot": "\"A seemingly-untroubled adolescent carries disturbing secrets that compel a psychiatrist to unearth the patient's gruesome past.\"\nPsychiatrist Michael Hunter and his wife are watching their daughter Shelly's school play.

While the parents are applauding Shelly, Kyle commits suicide in the family's garage using the exhaust from a car.\nSeveral years later the family has fallen apart because of their loss. Michael retreats, writes books, holds speeches for University students, but he no longer treats patients. When his former student, Barbara Wagner, approaches him asking for help with a case he initially refuses, but then gives in to taking over the case of 17-year-old Thomas \"Tommy\" Caffey, who witnessed his father murder his mother and repressed the memories. The teenager will be allowed to leave the psychiatric facility in a few weeks when he turns 18. But while working with Tommy, Michael realizes how much the boy reminds him of his own son Kyle and feelings of guilt arise in the psychologist.\nIn flashbacks and conversations, the viewer receives background information of Kyle's suicide. Michael had his son see a therapist\u2014an old university friend named Harry Quinlan\u2014instead of taking medication. In his son's suicide letter, Michael finds out that Kyle was sexually abused by Quinlan. When Michael tries to confront Quinlan, the therapist won't unlock the front door. Michael goes to the glass back door, through which he sees Quinlan pull a gun out of a drawer. As Quinlan places the barrel in his mouth, Michael angrily yells at him to shoot himself, which the therapist does.\nTommy punches Chloe, a girl on ecstasy, at a party because she tried to force him to have sex. At the same party, Tommy befriends Shelly and they become closer. Shelly tells Tommy about Kyle. From then on, Tommy uses the information in therapy sessions and manipulates Michael, who more and more sees his own son in him.\nWhen Michael visits Tommy's father in prison he finds out that Tommy's mother misused her son as a lover and slept with him regularly. This is the reason why his father, who came home early one day, bludgeoned her to death, and why Tommy reacts violently when women try to have physical contact with him. However, Mr. Caffey had always said it was because he found out his wife had a lover, running away, and tells Michael he'll deny all of that if he repeats that.\nIn the last part of the movie, Tommy tries to make Barbara release him to an independent life immediately. When she refuses and touches him, he pushes her through a glass window. After she crawls to a telephone and attempts to call police, Tommy beats her with the handset. He flees in a car stolen from Troy and, armed with a handgun, picks up Shelly from her mother's house and speeds away. Michael finds the severely wounded Barbara in her apartment. Just before being placed in the ambulance, Barbara warns Michael about Tommy's plan. Michael races to his ex-wife's house, narrowly missing the boy and Shelly, whom he chases. The boy's flight comes to an end near train tracks, where he holds Shelly at gunpoint. Michael confronts Tommy with what his mother did and Tommy surrenders the girl and the gun. When a train approaches, Tommy tears loose from Michael's embrace and runs onto the tracks. At the last second, Tommy stops on the tracks, throws up his arms, and awaits impact.

He is introduced to Sofia Serrano by his best friend, Brian Shelby, during a party. David and Sofia spend the night together at Sofia's apartment and fall in love, unaware that David's current lover, Julie Gianni, has followed them there.

Brian convinces David to join him and Sofia at a club. They leave him in the street outside the club after he becomes drunk and insults them.\nThe next morning, Sofia returns and apologizes to David. She takes him home, the two form a relationship and he slowly begins to recover. Doctors find a way to repair David's face despite their prior prognosis. Later, he is plagued by bizarre experiences, such as brief flashbacks of his disfigurement and an encounter with a mysterious man at a bar who informs him that David is omnipotent, demonstrated by the entire bar falling silent at David's command. One day, while at Sofia's, David awakens to find himself in bed with Julie, whose face has replaced Sofia's in their photographs. In shock, he suffocates Julie.

However, a glitch in the software had caused other elements of his subconscious to distort his dream.\nThey emerge on the rooftop, high above the clouds. Tech Support tells David that while they have corrected the flaw, he now has a choice of either being returned to the dream or being restored to life, requiring a literal leap of faith off the roof that will wake him from his sleep.

He was helpless and physically sick as the SA brown-shirts clubbed their victims to the ground. The experience left him with a resolve to do something to help the Jews.\nBack in the United States, Fry begins to canvass his influential friends and acquaintances, only to find indifference or even antisemitism. Learning that the Nazis have targeted artists and intelligentsia, he approaches the State Department with a plan and a few prominent names, such as artist Marc Chagall, scrawled on a list. When the State Department tries to block his plans to head back to Europe, Fry finds an ally in First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who intervenes on his behalf. She specifically asks Fry to check on Lion Feuchtwanger, imprisoned without charge by the French in the Camp des Milles internment camp.\nIn 1940, heading for Marseille in Vichy France \u2013 the nominally unoccupied zone libre in the southern part of Nazi-conquered metropolitan France, where he knows that Jewish artists have taken refuge \u2013 Fry arrives with money to bribe officials.\nWhile U.S. Consul Jamieson is intransigent and rude to him, Fry later learns that Vice Consul Harry Bingham is an ally, as Bingham has worked with Waitstill and Martha Sharp, taking Feuchtwanger, Hannah Arendt, and Marc and Bella Chagall into his own home. The Chagalls, like many other expatriates, believe they are safe in Vichy France, willfully ignoring the article in the terms of the French surrender stating that France must immediately hand over any French citizen that the Nazis should demand. Word spreads quickly in Marseille that an American will help Jews to escape Vichy France. In setting up an office out of his hotel room, Fry encounters Miriam Davenport, who helps him screen the numerous refugees that begin lining up at his hotel.\nTwo other accomplices approach Fry, Albert Hirschman, a Jewish con-man that he names \"Beamish\", and Bill Freier, a counterfeit expert. With picture-perfect forged passes and identification cards, Fry begins to send Jewish artists out of France to Spain where they can arrange transport to the United States. Both French and German officials suspect that Fry is deceitful and assign agents, such as Nazi SS Oberstleutnant Marius Franken, to follow him.\nWith French collaborators turning in Jews, an urgency to leave begins to take hold. Even Chagall now joins with author Heinrich Mann and others in seeking passage out of Marseille. Fry and Davenport decide to shepherd a large group of frightened refugees, first on a train, then taking the group on a long hike through a mountain forest to a checkpoint where, if their documents will be accepted, they will be free to enter neutral Spain. Despite some near misses, the group makes it to freedom.\nIn just under one year, ending with his expulsion in September 1941, Fry's clandestine underground escape route over the Pyrenees eventually frees more than 2,000 artists, authors, scientists and intellectuals from Vichy France, including some who are listed onscreen in the background of the closing credits: Chagall, Arendt, Jacques Lipchitz, Hans Bellmer, Heinrich Mann, Andr\u00e9 Masson, Max Ernst, Franz Werfel, Ferdinand Springer and Feuchtwanger.", "tmdb_id": 74474}, "16166731": {"title": "Vedham", "plot": "Sanjay and Anitha are a married couple living in Coimbatore but are on the verge of getting divorced.

They interrogate the servant responsible for maintaining Belmont's and Veraldi's suits, who confesses that he received a letter, with cash, ordering him not to clean their jackets.

A man with a mirror mask, called the Alchemist, offered them an elixir of eternal youth in return for their cooperation in capturing young maidens for his experiments. The three rich men went along, but later stopped cooperating due to a sense of guilt, so the Alchemist killed them. After Boisset leaves, the Alchemist arrives, killing Froissard and Marine.

In one of these films, they demonstrate how to make a homemade bomb out of a pressure cooker and chemicals available over the counter, and they plant the bomb in a vacant villa in Grunewald. However, the timer sticks, and the bomb does not go off until 12 years later, when it is jostled by a real estate broker and a potential buyer. They are injured in the blast, and the police are pressured to hunt down the \"terrorists\" responsible.\nTwo of the original anarchists, Tim (Schweiger) and Hotte (Martin Feifel), still live in the original building and engage in anti-police graffiti, anti-gentrification protests and petty theft. The current owner of the building, a nouveau riche Turk named B\u00fclent, cannot evict them, because Hotte is disabled, having lost his legs. (It is later revealed that they were crushed by a water cannon during a riot.) While Tim is out, the police raid the building in a sweep for clues to the bombing and confiscate their cache of old films, including the incriminating bomb-making film. They cart the films off to the fortresslike police headquarters, a former Prussian military barracks. One by one, Tim and Hotte visit the former members of their group to warn them of the bust. They are distressed by the news, having gone on with their lives: Nele (Nadja Uhl) is a single mother of two young children; \"Terror\" (Matthias Matschke) is an attorney; Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) runs an advertising agency that exploits radical imagery; and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer), Tim's former lover, has evidently gone bourgeois, although her circumstances are never fully explained, and is about to get married. They balk when Tim and Hotte propose breaking into the police headquarters and destroying the evidence, but Terror's counter-suggestion that they should turn themselves in is met with even stronger disagreement, and finally the former radicals devise the plan of infiltrating the headquarters by pretending to be a television news crew.\nA rift within the police department makes their plan possible: Manowsky (Klaus L\u00f6witsch), an old-school Berlin cop, wants to use aggressive tactics and avoid press coverage, while Henkel (Devid Striesow), a technocrat from Bonn, prefers more modern, less intrusive methods and is eager to earn good public relations for the department. Henkel gives the \"TV crew\" a tour of the police headquarters, including the evidence room where the films are stashed. Manowsky interrupts the tour, and the former radicals barely manage to slip away.\nTo destroy the films, the radicals decide to smuggle a second homemade bomb into the evidence room as a Trojan horse: all the evidence is stored alphabetically according to the street where it was found, so they need only plant the bomb in a suspicious-looking crate in their old building and entice the police into picking it up. What the other radicals do not know is that Hotte intends to smuggle himself into the evidence room inside the crate along with the bomb, to make sure it's placed correctly. Hotte, without his wheelchair (he uses a dolly), is trapped in the evidence room when the emergency exit door is jammed. Frantically, he uses the phone in the room to call his compatriots, but they are all away from their phones. In desperation he calls B\u00fclent, who at that moment is trying to talk Tim into abandoning their apartment and accepting a payoff for their few remaining goods. Tim rushes to Hotte's aid. The others eventually get Hotte's message and come to rescue him as well, but meanwhile, Manowsky intercepts Hotte and Tim in the evidence room. After a taunting lecture on their inability to let go of past ideals, Manowsky prepares to arrest the two, but the others arrive just in time to distract him. Tim seizes Manowsky's handcuffs and shackles him to the evidence cage. He threatens to leave the bomb in Manowsky's lap, but the others persuade him not to commit outright murder. Tim tosses Manowsky the handcuff keys, and the radicals flee as an alarm sounds.\nPursued by police through the headquarters, the former radicals stumble upon a water cannon and use it to drive back the police and escape. As Manowsky and Henkel observe their flight, Henkel confidently predicts that the evidence will lead to their capture. However, Manowsky \u2013 moved by the radicals' compassion, by his annoyance with Henkel and by reflection on his own long-held ideals \u2013 has left the bomb in the evidence room, and it destroys the evidence.\nThe group of friends walk through the streets of Berlin and end up on the floor of an S-Bahn car.

Walter is exhausted as Max does not take the proceeding seriously and still spends freely, even asking to declare bankruptcy immediately without trying to budget so his assets are protected. He tells his wife, Lutetia Fairbanks, that his company is in a technical procedure to disguise what his company is really going into.\nKevin learns about Max from his friend Berger, a fellow thief who happens to know what places to hit. Berger tells him about Max's current situation with his company, as well as what he couldn't access due to the critical condition of the chapter 11 bankruptcy code, which includes going into his beachfront mansion. When the two go to rob Max, Max manages to capture Kevin and call the police.

Afterwards, Amber decides that Kevin's feud with Max has gone too far and that she no longer cares about the ring. While Max later addresses the Senate Committee, he gets a call from Kevin who tells him that if Max will give him his ring back he will give him back his. Max refuses and proceeds to repeatedly curse at Kevin, appearing to be speaking to the senators, and other viewers. This results in the hearing ending poorly for Max.

Danny and James are staying with James' father, known by all as \"Uncle Fred\" (Christopher Lloyd). Uncle Fred is considered crazy and is a bit childish, but Danny loves him very much. Danny dislikes his new life in Walker Falls, and it seems no one likes him, especially the football coach Mike Kankel (Joe Clements) and his son, Ryan (Craig Marriott), the school's biggest bully. The only people who seem to be nice to Danny are his crush, Dayna Stenson (Brittany Byrnes) and Taylor Morgan (Imelda Corcoran), the school nurse, James' childhood friend, and Dayna's mother.\nDanny is surprised by how few decorations are up with Halloween only a week away. The people of Walker Falls do not seem to be making any effort at all to celebrate the holiday. Sheriff Ed Frady (Alan Flower) even takes down the decorations that Danny puts up. When walking home from school, Ryan and his pal, Leo (Daniel Karr) push him into the cemetery, lock the gate, and tell him that Walker Falls does not celebrate Halloween because of the legend of a curse.\n20 years ago, Curtis Danko (Brendan McCarthy), an artistic boy, was ostracized by \"normal\" people. When a competition was held for all the eighth graders to design a sculpture of their personal hero, Curtis kept his project covered during the day, then came to school at night to work by the light of captured fireflies. On Halloween night, Mike Kankel and his friends were walking by the school when they saw Curtis from the window, at work on his sculpture. When Kankel returned the next day, he noticed the kiln had been on all night and ran all out of fuel. He opened the door and found Curtis's charred skeleton and a message in the ashes, saying that if the town ever celebrated another Halloween, he would come back and destroy them all. Kankel was struck blind for three days after seeing Curtis' finished statue. Everyone in the town believed the threat and, since then, Halloween has never been celebrated.\nDanny thinks it is a silly story, and runs home. James is rarely around, so Uncle Fred serves as a stand-in father for Danny. That night, James is planning to announce his \"Halloween Spooktacular\" idea to raise funds to re-open Walker Chocolates at the town meeting. Uncle Fred and Danny try to tell him that the townspeople will be too afraid to support the Spooktacular because of the curse, but James will not listen.  At the meeting, Mayor Churney (Roy Billing) announces James, who is surprised to find the people of Walker Falls shudder at just the mention of Halloween. To bring the conversation back on track, his secretary passes out samples of chocolate, and James almost wins them over, but when he reveals his Spooktacular plans, the townspeople are terrified and run out of the building.\nThe next morning, there is a commotion outside the house. Halloween decorations are all over town, and a large pile of pumpkins has been discovered in the town square. When Uncle Fred lifts a pumpkin as he says \"Happy Halloween\", the entire pile rolls on top of him, killing him. Everyone in town is at Uncle Fred's funeral and Danny is very sad. As a memento, he lets his grandfather's favorite car shoot down the track and rest with his coffin.\nHowever, because of Uncle Fred's love of Halloween, the magic in the cemetery allows him to return as a zombie. Unfortunately, that same magic awakes others from their slumber, including Curtis. The zombies begin capturing all the townsfolk and gathering them to the creepy old Victorian style house chanting the phrase \"Statue.\" Meanwhile, Danny and Dayna try to explain to James and Nurse Taylor the situation. Uncle Fred reveals his zombie self to his son and Nurse Taylor, both fainting in the process. Zombies break into the house and Uncle Fred explains that Curtis might be behind the zombies awakening and tells them to escape while he holds the other zombies off. Unfortunately, he, his son, and Nurse Taylor are all captured, one of the zombies stating that Uncle Fred was the main part of the plan. Dayna pleads to stop and blames herself for trying to celebrate Halloween. Danny blames himself for being a coward and not standing up for himself.\nWhen everyone is gathered, Curtis reveals himself to the people. As he is about to reveal his statue, he is attacked and literally torn apart by Kankel. However, because Curtis is a zombie, he manages to pull himself together, and scare the wits out of Kankel. As Curtis pulls the shroud off of his statue, everyone covers their eyes in fear. Surprisingly, nothing happens. Everyone uncovers their eyes and Curtis' statue is revealed to be of Uncle Fred. Curtis then shows Uncle Fred a picture of the two of them, Uncle Fred shaking Curtis' hand, as it implied that Curtis looked up to him. Uncle Fred, still guilty about Curtis' death, wonders why he was a hero to Curtis as it was his kiln that killed him. Curtis then turns to Kankel and points to him, naming him as his killer.\nKankel confesses that the night Curtis died, he was working on the statue of Uncle Fred and as a prank to scare him, Kankel, Frady, and his group pushed Curtis into the kiln and locked him in it while taunting him. Suddenly, the janitor appeared and Kankel's group ran off. While cleaning the class, the janitor accidentally turned on the kiln; not realizing Curtis was in it. The next day, Kankel went inside the kiln and saw Curtis' corpse as well as the completed statue of Uncle Fred. To hide his crime, he made up the curse by pretending his eyes were burned when he saw the statue to make it seem like it was Curtis' doing. Kankel also reveals that the statue of Uncle Fred would have been voted to be put in town square, instead of Kankel's statue of his own father. It's revealed that Uncle Fred donated much time and money to the town's children, promoting creativity and imagination; thus, he was loved by many children; explaining why he was called \"Uncle Fred\" and why much of his actions were seen as childish to some. Kankel wouldn't stand for someone to promote things that were \"girly\" and wanted things \"manly.\"  Danny looks at Kankel with disgust because Danny got bullied and became a coward because of him. Kankel robbed the town of Halloween for 20 years. However, Kankel's action earns him the wrath of his father, Pops Kankel (Gordon Boyd), who is among the group of zombies and is upset at what he has done. He then grabs his son's ear and drags him out to \"give him a whooping he won't forget for the rest of his years.\"\nBy the end, the zombies and the townspeople applaud Curtis' statue. With that, Curtis has accomplished what he's done and bids farewell to the town, disappearing into the night, returning to his crypt to finally rest. Meanwhile, the other zombies bid farewell. Uncle Fred reconciles with James, saying this will be the last time he will see him on Earth, but he'll always be watching him on the other side. Danny and the others realize that they apologized and blame themselves for nothing and regretting believing Kankel's lies. He then leaves with his wife, Dolores (Jenny Dibley) and the two join the other zombies, sharing one final dance with the fireflies, as all the entities slowly disappear dancing into the night. Danny and Dayna share a kiss, while James and Taylor hold hands as they watch the dancing zombies fade into the night. The town decides to celebrate Halloween once again.\nBy the end, German investors that spoke to James earlier love the concept of Halloween and decide to support him into reopening the family chocolate factory within two weeks.

After gaining his freedom, the Djinn is asked by Professor Barash to let him be the one who makes the wishes. The professor wishes for two of the world's loveliest ladies to be in love with him.\nHowever, as soon as the Djinn grants this wish, the women kill the professor; the Djinn takes the face off of the dead professor and is able to steal his identity. He then kills a secretary by her wishing for \"files to burn up\" but instead of the files, she burns. He takes the student file of Diana in an effort to find her and force her to fulfill her three wishes. While Diana is on the run, she must endeavor to prevent the Djinn from subjecting the entire world to Hell's wrath. She goes to a church for safety, but the Djinn is there instead of the priest. Her friend Ann, who is now the \"professor's Teaching Assistant\" makes the wish of \"wanting to lose a little weight\", to which she pukes up her guts in pain. Diana uses her first wish for her to stop having pain, but of course to the Djinn, that means killing Ann.\nDiana, noting that she is in a St. Michael church, uses another wish to summon the archangel Michael who possesses the body de Oscar Merchan Valencia   (it was about to be her body, but Oscar Merchan Valencia pushed her away as the spirit went into him).

As the Djinn tries to follow them, he goes a different way and encounters a female student named Elinor who puts the moves on him, and then wishes for him to \"break her heart\", which he literally does resulting in her death. Next, the Djinn goes into Diana's room where her friend Billy is. Billy is killed by telling the Djinn to \"blow him\"; he blows his body into a wooden head of a bull, and the horns pierce into his body. The Djinn then picks up a photo of Diana and her friends, and threatens to hurt Katie unless Diana makes her third wish. Michael has revealed to her that only by using his sword can she kill the Djinn. She isn't ready, and when he does try to give her the sword, it severely burns her arm, but Michael heals it.\nKatie happens to find the dead body of Billy and finds herself being pursued by the Djinn into a science room, where the Djinn tricks her into thinking she could successfully hide from him. When she wishes \"for a place to hide\", he sticks her head into a cage of lab rats that bite at her head, resulting in her death.\nA second battle ensues between Michael and the Djinn, resulting in the Djinn's hand briefly being cut off by the sword, but it grows back. Michael escapes with Diana in a car, but the Djinn runs to the car, jumps on top of it, and tries to hurt them. Diana drives his side into another car, thus making him fall off. She then careens into an information post and the car is flipped, mimicking how her parents had died years earlier.\nIn the end, Diana's attempt to commit suicide by jumping off a building actually gives her the ability to wield Michael's sword, and she kills the Djinn with it, but is fatally injured when they both fall in the process.
