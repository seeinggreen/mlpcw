Gilman has reported Denmore for lying to him during training, and in retaliation has been accused of bullying and hazing the dismissed cadet. Denmore's attorney, Lew Proctor, attacking the academy and its Honor Code system, declares that Gilman is unfit and possibly criminally liable. Gilman is confined to quarters by the academy superintendent and warned not to discuss the case with anyone. Consequently, he breaks a date his girlfriend Ann Daniels without explanation. The hearing resumes and Gilman's classmate, Eddie Loughlin, recounts how Gilman uncomplainingly withstood the rigors of academy training, especially during his plebe year, when he was still recovering from war wounds. Gilman takes the stand and testifies about his war experiences.\nUnwillingly drafted in December 1941, he learned by bitter experience that all soldiers in combat must obey their superiors unquestioningly. As a result, he applied for and completed officer candidate school. Gilman joined a unit going into combat in North Africa and became friends with both Loughlin and West Point graduate Lt. Harry Daniels. Daniels was killed in action and Gilman wounded during a battle in Tunisia, after which Gilman spent two years recovering in an Army hospital. Although awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for destroying an enemy tank during the action, Gilman turned down the medal. After his discharge from the Army, Gilman returned home to Brooklyn where he learned that his former sweetheart had married in his absence. Gilman changed numerous jobs before realizing that he cannot adjust to civilian life. On the evening of V-E Day, as the city celebrated, Gilman became depressed, feeling that people were dancing on the graves of countless soldiers, and instead went to see Daniels' family and his widow Ann.\nJohn Craig, a nurse at the hospital where Gilman was treated, then testifies that Gilman suffers from nightmares but refuses to discuss what troubles him. When given a drug to help him reveal his feelings, Gilman disclosed that during the battle Daniels ordered Gilman's platoon to counter-attack at a specific hour but Gilman inexplicably delayed the attack for three minutes, resulting in Daniels' death. Gilman was unable to explain the delay and believes himself a coward. Called back to the stand, Gilman concedes Proctor's charge that he deliberately disobeyed orders but refuses to discuss it. Proctor demands his immediate court-martial, but the superintendent insists that Rocky be given time to consider his testimony. That night Gilman receives a note from Ann saying she is going away and breaks quarters to go to New York. Gilman tells Ann that he has decided to resign from the academy and go with her. Ann refuses to accept the decision and insists that he return to confront his accusers. The next day, Gilman's adoptive father, Pop Dewing, brings three witnesses to the hearing to support his son.\nThe first, Ann, recalls that when she first met him on V-E day, Gilman shocked her with a confession that he caused her husband's death. Realizing that he is tortured by misplaced guilt, she took him to a West Point ceremony commemorating Daniels' death. Ann realized that she has feelings for Gilman and was told by her mother-in-law that in his last letter, Harry said that if he should be killed, he wanted Ann to have a normal life. Encouraged by Ann, Gilman was admitted to West Point as a cadet, continuing to see her, but she remained unsure if he ever intended to marry her. When he cancelled their date, Ann intended to break off their relationship until he told her of his decision to resign. The next witness, the Army physician who administered the therapeutic drug, testifies that after reviewing Gilman's medical records, he realizes that there is a gap in his memory of the battle. Finally a soldier from Gilman's platoon testifies that while Gilman was leading the unit to make the counterattack, it was ambushed by a German tank concealed in a grove. Gilman was knocked unconscious by an explosion and when he recovered shortly after, was unaware that he was ever unconscious. Gilman was mortified to discover that the specified time of attack had passed and that Daniels had been killed, but because he refused to discuss the incident, he never learned about the concussion that created the delay.

When Bugs asks him who he is, he responds in his typical way: \"What's up, doc?! I ain't no doc! I'm a pirate!

But, when Sam climbs up, he climbs back down and crashes on the ground below. For his next attempt, he made a seesaw, and puts a ball on it, but that kind of failed too. In another one, that skirts the laws of physics, Bugs tells Sam he's going to jump. Instead, Bugs drops a convenient anvil over the side of the crow's nest, Sam catches it, and the anvil's momentum causes the entire ship (\"except for the crow's nest\") to submerge. Sam mouths some apparent curses underwater, then tosses the anvil overboard and the ship resurfaces.\nWhen Bugs comes down to check on Sam, Sam proceeds to attack him with his sword, making Bugs mad that he's \"sore again\".

Suddenly, another hatch opens in his face and a cannon blasts Sam once more, much to his annoyance.\nSam now chases Bugs again, and is now subjected to the lots-of-doors in-and-out routine (previously used in Little Red Riding Rabbit), which ends with Sam getting blasted by a cannon again. Sam confronts Bugs, who throws a match into the powder room, which a panicking Sam swiftly retrieves (a gag that would later be recycled into 1954's Captain Hareblower). This is repeated until finally, Sam is too late to retrieve the match that ends up exploding the entire pirate ship when he refused to go after another match again, reducing the ship to splinters. On his last nerve, Sam furiously chases Bugs with his gun: \"ooooh, I'll blast your head off for this!\" until he seemingly has Bugs defeated (\"Alright, now! I got ya cornered!

A stream of them sail one way along the main street; a traffic light (an Acme Regulator, in keeping with Looney Tunes tradition) turns red and those bullets hover in mid-air while another torrent of them shoot by on the cross street, though they hesitate to resume when they get the green light when one last bullet zips past on the cross street, running the red light. Inside the Gunshot Saloon ('Come in and get a slug') at the bar a cowboy shoots another, apparently only for his drink. Outside there is a commotion and women screaming, then Yosemite Sam, guns smoking in his hands, walks in (being so short, he passes beneath the saloon doors). The patrons react with fear, yelling his name as the score quotes from Erlk\u00f6nig (as is often the case for villains in Looney Tunes).\nSam orders everyone (\"all you skunks\") out of the place, firing his guns for emphasis. All comply (including an actual skunk), except one cowboy Sam catches trying to sneak out the back and turns into a shooting gallery target.

They then draw on each other with increasingly larger guns until Sam makes it to a 'ten shooter'. Bugs pulls out a pea shooter; Sam reacts to the pea-shot bounced off his nose by opening fire. Bugs runs outside, right into Sam who, in typical Western parlance, demands the rabbit \"Dance!\" as he fires bullets at his feet.\nBugs performs a soft shoe routine; entertainment-style, he turns the 'floor' over to Sam who does a routine of his own. As he dances 'off stage', Bugs opens the door to a mine shaft which Sam then falls into. (\"Tsk tsk tsk. Poor little maroon. So trusting. So na\u00efve.\") When Sam returns to the surface and is immediately confrontational, Bugs draws lines in the sand, each time daring Sam to step over them.

At the same time, Countess Johanna Augusta Franziska von Stoltzenberg-Stolzenberg (Joan Fontaine) and her father, Baron Holenia, are celebrating the fact their black poodle Scheherezade has been selected to mate with the emperor's poodle. As they depart from the palace, they meet Virgil and his white fox terrier Buttons, whose scuffle with Scheherezade leads to a discussion about class distinctions.\nWhen Scheherezade experiences a nervous breakdown, she is treated by veterinarian Dr. Zwieback, who practices Freudian psychology, and he advises Johanna to force her dog to face Buttons in order to dissipate her fear. When the dogs are reunited, romantic sparks begin to fly between not only the animals but their owners as well. They begin to spend a great deal of time together, during which Scheherezade and the salesman's dog mate, unbeknownst to their owners.\nVirgil eventually convinces Johanna true love can overcome their social differences, and he asks the emperor for her hand in marriage. This is the crucial scene in the picture, and brings the otherwise lightweight movie plot to a higher level. The Emperor is cordial and fatherly with Virgil, and treats him with respect and even a bit of admiration. But he is certain Johanna could never be happy living in Newark, New Jersey. \"We are not better than you\", explains the Emperor sadly, \"I think perhaps you are better than us. But we are like snails: If you take us out of our majestic shells, we die.\"\nFinally, the Emperor tells Virgil of the disastrous end to several similar matches he has seen in his long life, and makes him an offer: He will endorse the gramophone\u2014which will lead to enormous sales and profits for Virgil\u2014only if he breaks up with Johanna. Virgil refuses, highly insulted, but the Emperor asks him one more question: Are you sure you will be enough for her?\nThe question strikes home, and Virgil decides he loves Johanna too much to take a chance on ruining her life. He lies to her, saying he used her only in order to gain access to the emperor to sell his wares, and walks out apparently uncaring, making himself the villain.\nSeveral months later when Scheherezade gives birth to a litter of white puppies with black patches, it is obvious they were sired by Buttons and not, as everyone thought, by the Emperor's poodle. Fearing the Emperor's reaction, Baron Holenia tells the Emperor they were stillborn, and secretly orders them drowned. However, Virgil, who has sneaked into the palace to see Johanna one last time and set the record straight before he leaves for America, rescues the puppies and confronts the Emperor, who he thinks has ordered the drowning. The Emperor demands an explanation from Holenia, chastises him severely, and asks Virgil to give him the puppies.\nBut Virgil is still furious, and continues to berate the Emperor about class snobbery which he sees as the reason Holenia tried to drown the pups. He is so angry that he forgets Johanna is standing there listening and tells the Emperor he never should have agreed to give up Johanna to save her from a commoner's life with him. Johanna realises what Virgil has done and forgives him, and tells the Emperor that better she take one chance in a million of a happy life with Virgil, than no chance at all with someone she cannot love.

One afternoon, when Philippe's father departs for the weekend to retrieve his mother after eight months in hospital, Baines and Julie meet at a nearby tea shop.  Although Mrs. Baines has expressly forbidden him to go, Philippe slips down the fire escape to find Baines, discovering him deep in conversation with Julie.  She is seeking to end the liaison and go away, has already made a reservation for the Continent, but Baines is desperately trying to change her mind. Philippe is oblivious to the intimate nature of their conversation. Afterward, Baines tells Philippe that Julie is his niece and asks that he not mention the incident to Mrs. Baines. That afternoon, Philippe is chastised by Mrs. Baines for playing on a window ledge on the staircase landing. Later, she attempts to glean information about her husband from the child, suspicious he is cheating on her.  She and Baines quarrel bitterly when he seeks to tell her he wants out of their marriage.  She cuts him off, then announces she is leaving to spend the night with an aunt.  Baines assents, echoing aloud that he has been telling her she needs to get out more.\n\nThe next morning Mrs. Baines pretends to leave, case in hand, but doubles back into the house unseen.  Baines takes Philippe on a promised trip to the London Zoo. Julie joins the pair and accompanies them back home for supper, believing they will be alone there. On their arrival Philippe finds a telegram from Mrs. Baines, notifying Mr. Baines that she will return in two days. \nThe three have an impromptu \"picnic dinner\" in a basement courtyard and afterward play a spirited game of hide-and-seek throughout the house. All the while Mrs. Baines skulks around, spying on the threesome. She later awakens Philippe, seeking to wrest Julie's whereabouts out of him.  Frightened at her unhinged appearance and manner, he yells out to alarm Baines of her presence. Enraged, she slaps the boy. The couple then argues and struggle at the top of the home's main two-story staircase, which Philippe partially witnesses. Mrs. Baines confronts her husband with having an affair with Julie. Mr. Baines tells her to go downstairs before he loses his temper, then withdraws toward the guest room. Determined to see in, Mrs. Baines instead slips onto an unprotected ledge high above the staircase to peer over a terrace in that direction.  Pressing on an open window she is leaning against, it pivots outward at the top, sweeping her feet from under her and sending her plunging to her death at the base of the stairs. Philippe does not see the fall and presumes that Baines pushed her in anger.\nPhilippe becomes frightened, flees the house barefoot in his pajamas, and, blocks away, darts straight into the path of a police officer patrolling his beat.

There Baines recounts the evening to police, carefully leaving Julie out of his story.  The attending doctor, originally confident the death had been accidental, recognizes Philipe and begins to query him on why he had been out alone in the night.  Suspicions begin to arise and he refuses to sign a death certificate, requesting the police physician be sent for to open an official enquiry.  He arrives and more questions are raised.  Scotland Yard is sent for, and Detective Ames appears and furthers the interrogations.  Baines lies that he and Philippe had dinner alone, but is caught out by three place settings having been used.

Soon after, Detective Ames and Inspector Crowe arrive, along with a specialist in fingerprints and photography. Julie attempts to leave, but upon being identified as an embassy typist is asked to stay by the police to transcribe their interviews. Crowe and Ames first interrogate Philippe alone. He denies that Mrs. Baines slapped him, or that Julie ever visited the house. Julie overhears Philippe concealing the truth, and conversing in French, sharply implores him to be honest. \nSent off, Philippe attempts to make off with the telegram Mrs. Baines sent, but it is confiscated by the police as evidence against Baines.  Seeing he's cornered, Baines proceeds to dolefully recount to police what actually happened the night before. They continue to disbelieve his story and suggest he make a formal statement.\nTold he must go to police headquarters, Baines announces he will go to his basement quarters to get his things. He is initially followed by Philippe, who tearfully questions whether his many stories are true. Baines admits they were merely fantasies and adamantly denies killing his wife. In his rooms he folds a hinged set of framed portraits of himself and Mrs. Baines and opens a bureau drawer to toss it in, only to see his pistol.  Fearing he cannot prove his innocence, thoughts of suicide dance.  \nUpstairs two investigators notice a footprint in the spilt soil from a potted plant on the unprotected window ledge high above the main stairway.  It is clearly of a women's shoe, appearing to clear Baines of fatally pushing Mrs. Baines from the top of the stairs. Crow and Ames swiftly retract their accusation against him. Julie goes to the basement and informs Baines, hat in hand, that he is no longer a suspect. Philippe, having again been strongly compelled by Julie to be truthful, desperately insists on being able to explain that the footprint had actually been left in a row he'd had with Mrs. Baines two days before, but no-one will let him.  Inspector Crowe has already heard too many lies to believe he won't just be told another. \nThe police leave, and Baines and Julie share a brief moment of renewed affection.

After his father leaves, Henery remarks, \"A fine thing.  I'm a chicken hawk and I've never even seen a chicken.\"  He determines to get his first one that day.\nHenery's father invades a coop and struts out with a couple of traumatized chickens.  Foghorn approaches, demanding he \"unhand those fair barnyard flowers\", and insists on an explanation from the chicken hawk. Foghorn does not allow the bird to get a word in edgewise, however; with his stomach, the rooster bumps Henery's father across the barnyard and kicks him out. (Two years later, in A Fractured Leghorn, Foghorn uses this technique several times against a cat when the two are after the same worm).\nHaving arrived on the scene, Henery asks, \"Hey, was that a chicken, Pop?\"  His father summons some false bravado and claims he would never allow a chicken to treat him that way, that Foghorn is nothing but a \"loud-mouthed shnook\". A yellow stripe down his back is quite apparent as a sign of cowardice as he walks away.\nOn his way to find a chicken, Henery is intercepted by Foghorn and his insufferable wordplay. Finally, the chicken hawk walks away and comes upon Barnyard Dawg's house, which, due to his father's false stories about chickens, he assumes is a \"chicken's cave\".  He takes a hammer, hits the sleeping dog over the head, and proceeds to haul his prize across the barnyard.  Foghorn interrupts this, asking, \"What's the gimmick? What's it all about?\"  When Henery replies that he has just caught himself a chicken, Foghorn guffaws, saying, \"That's no chicken, son. I'm a chicken. Rooster, that is.\" Henery does not buy this and when Foghorn asks him, \"What am I then, boy?\" Henery responds that he is \"a loud-mouthed shnook\".  Foghorn then prattles on about his identity and tells the hawk that what he thinks is a chicken is actually a dog (all while slapping Barnyard Dawg around). His position is not helped, though, when Barnyard Dawg wakes up, kicks the rooster, and calls him a shnook.\nIn an effort to convince Henery he is a chicken (\"rooster, that is\"), Foghorn pulls out a cardboard cutout of the sun and crows. This does not work; Henery walks off, leaving two signs reading \"Shnook!\", and \"Loud Mouth'd That Is!\" respectively. As Foghorn stalks across the yard, kicking the signs away and muttering to himself about how he has to straighten Henery out, the hawk comes by pushing a huge trunk. After turning to the viewers to remark, \"Nice kid, but a little dumb!\", the rooster proceeds to explain to Henery that he still has not captured a chicken. Foghorn emphasizes his points by regularly hitting what he thinks is the trunk; he misses the fact that it has opened and he has been, in fact, hitting Barnyard Dawg, who was inside it. Upon noticing the dog, Foghorn screams, makes a run for it, and climbs a ladder to the top floor of the barn. The dog is waiting there with a watermelon which the rooster plows his head into, then mutters, \"Some days it don't pay to get outta bed!\" as the dog leaves.\nAs a last resort, Foghorn shows Henery a photo of a roasted chicken and demonstrates how he himself would look on a platter. Henery utters, \"Shnook!\", and goes off to throw a lit stick of dynamite into Barnyard Dawg's house.  Knowing he will be blamed, Foghorn dives into the house in an attempt to stop the explosion. He fails and, when the smoke clears, amidst the rubble, the rooster is holding what remains of the dynamite. The enraged dog starts body-slamming Foghorn and finally calls him a \"good-for-nothing chicken\". This is at last enough to convince Henery, who brings a shovel down on Foghorn and begins dragging him off.\nDisgusted with himself, the rooster admits, \"I'm just a loud-mouthed schnook.\"  Henery declares, \"Chicken or shnook, in our oven he'll look good!\"", "tmdb_plot": "Little Henery the Chicken Hawk wants to prove he's big enough to hunt chickens, but he doesn't know what a chicken is.

After hanging up on him twice, Mary spends the rest of her day fielding calls from various Supreme Court justices who attempt to reconcile her with her former fianc\u00e9, Phillip Manning (Jeffrey Lynn), a Justice Department attorney.\nLater that night, Mary meets Justice Peabody (Harry Davenport) at a restaurant to discuss her breakup with Phillip, who is also there. After resisting their efforts to reunite her with Phillip, Mary tells Phillip that she broke their engagement not because she saw him with another woman, but because she was not jealous about it. Their conversation about her hard day at the White House fending off calls from the \"fish peddler\" is overheard by David, also in the restaurant, who then assures Mary that he will speak to the President, despite her interference. He then storms out.\nThe next morning at the White House gate, David apologizes for his actions the night before, and attempts to bribe Mary with flowers and candy, only to have them thrown back into his face. Later, at the switchboard, Mary receives a call from the President. When Mary hiccups into the phone, the President sends his executive secretary, Harvey Elwood (Ray Collins), to check on her condition and offers her a paper bag to breathe into. Phillip calls, expecting to drive her to Justice Peabody's party that night, but she declines, not wanting to resume their relationship. Later, as she is leaving work, Mary must drive David off the White House grounds to prevent his arrest. Mary asks David to escort her to the party, offering to introduce him to the President's secretary in exchange for the favor.\nMeanwhile, the President, having overheard Mary telling Phillip that she would rather stay home than attend the party with him, sends Lt. Tom Farrington (Edmond O'Brien), a naval aide at the White House, to escort Mary. At the party, they cause a stir and not a little jealousy in Phillip. After a pleasant evening of singing around the piano, Tom escorts Mary home, where she notices they're being watched by her father from an upstairs window. After she kisses Tom goodnight and he leaves, she is confronted by David, who's been waiting on the porch all night. David kisses a startled Mary, who starts to hiccup again.\nThe next day, when the President learns that Mary was upset about not keeping her date with David, he calls the fish expert himself to express his regrets, but then decides David's 'obsession' with fish means he is a nut. Later over lunch, after David explains his situation in full, Mary tells David she will arrange a meeting for him with Phillip, who can help him with his political issue. That afternoon at the Peppertree home, Tom arrives with presidential orders to take Mary to a White House movie screening. When Phillip learns that Mary is with Tom, he questions David about his relationship with Mary. The frustrated marine biologist announces he is leaving town and that everyone in Washington seems to have a \"Mary Peppertree fixation.\"\nMeanwhile, Tom's friend, newspaper publisher Samuel Litchfield (Frank Conroy), complains to Elwood about Tom's involvement with Mary, a mere switchboard operator. When Mary and Tom arrive together at the restaurant, the owner, Gustav Heindel (Hugo Haas), tells Elwood he saw Mary kissing David. Elwood decides to handle the matter with the Navy personally. Phillip offers to put the Justice Department on the case and promises to clear up the matter in two days.\nThat night, at Elwood's request, David takes Mary out on a date in Tom's place. Afterwards, back home in front of her house, upon kissing David, Mary breaks out in hiccups again, a sign that she is in love. Then both Phillip and Tom show up, and Phillip says these circumstances\nare being contrived by others, claiming Tom is a 'patsy' for him, and David is a 'patsy' for Tom. David, further confused and jealous,  leaves the three of them in frustration.\nThe next morning, Mary receives calls from Gustav and the Supreme Court justices congratulating her on her engagement to Phillip, and a call from the President congratulating her on her engagement to Tom! When Elwood learns that David is not technically a citizen of the United States, he has the young man arrested for illegally entering the country. Elwood soon discovers, however, that the Pacific island on which David was born and holds the deed to, is now home to a $300 million strategic U.S. Naval base. If David is declared an alien, the Navy could be forced to move. Later that day, everyone arrives at Gustav's restaurant to try to resolve the issue. After meeting with the President's advisors, David fashions a Senate resolution for the American annexation of his island if Phillip and Tom are given appointments far from Washington, and he and Gustav are made United States citizens.

To the surprise and disappointment of the company, command of the regiment was given to Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda).

However, the class-conscious Thursday forbids his daughter to see someone whom he does not consider an equal and a gentleman.\nWhen unrest arises among the Apache, led by Cochise (Miguel Incl\u00e1n), Thursday ignores York's advice to treat the tribes with honor and to remedy problems on the reservation caused by corrupt Apache agent Silas Meacham (Grant Withers). Thursday's inability to deal with Meacham effectively, due to his rigid interpretation of Army regulations stating that Meacham is an agent of the United States government, so entitled to Army protection (despite his own personal contempt for the man), coupled with Thursday's prejudicial and arrogant ignorance regarding the Apache, drives the Apaches to rebel. Eager for glory and recognition, Thursday orders his regiment into battle on Cochise's terms, a direct charge into the hills, despite York's urgent warnings that such a move would be suicidal.

Marcellus then arrives with the skeptical Horatio (Norman Wooland), Prince Hamlet's friend. Suddenly, all three see the Ghost, and Horatio demands that the ghost speak. The ghost vanishes then, without a word.\nInside the Great Hall of the castle, the court is celebrating the marriage of Gertrude (Eileen Herlie) and King Claudius (Basil Sydney); old King Hamlet has died apparently of an accidental snakebite, and his wife, Gertrude, has, within a month of the tragedy, married the late King's brother.

Claudius, however, is not fully convinced, and has Polonius set up a meeting between Hamlet and Ophelia. Hamlet's \"madness\" is constant even in this exchange, and Claudius is convinced.\nHamlet then hires a group of wandering stage performers, requesting that they enact the play The Murder of Gonzago for the king. However, Hamlet makes a few alterations to the play, so as to make it mirror the circumstances of the late King's murder. Claudius, unable to endure the play, calls out for light, and retires to his room. Hamlet is now convinced of Claudius' treachery. He finds Claudius alone, and has ample opportunity to kill the villain. However, at this time, Claudius is praying, and Hamlet does not seek to send him to heaven, so, he waits, and bides his time.\nHe instead confronts Gertrude about the matter of his father's death and Claudius' treachery. During this confrontation, he hears a voice from the arras, and, believing that it was Claudius eavesdropping, plunges his dagger into the curtains. On discovering that he has in fact, killed the eavesdropping Polonius instead, Hamlet is only mildly upset, and he continues to confront his mother. He then sees the ghostly apparition of his father, and proceeds to converse with it (the Ghost is uncredited in the film, but is apparently voiced by Olivier).

Fortunately, Hamlet's ship is attacked by pirates, and he is returned to Denmark. In his absence, however, Ophelia goes mad over Hamlet's rejection and the idea that her own sweetheart has killed her father, and she drowns, supposedly committing suicide. Laertes (Terence Morgan), Ophelia's brother, is driven to avenge her death, as well as his father's.\nClaudius and Laertes learn of Hamlet's return and prepare to have him killed. However, they plan to make it look like an accident. Claudius orders Laertes to challenge Hamlet to a duel, wherein Laertes will be given a poisoned blade that will kill with a bare touch. In case Laertes is unable to hit Hamlet, Claudius also prepares a poisoned drink.\nHamlet meets Laertes' challenge and engages him in a duel. Hamlet wins the first two rounds, and Gertrude drinks from the cup, suspecting that it is poisoned. Whilst in-between bouts, Laertes rushes Hamlet and strikes him on the arm, fatally poisoning him. Hamlet, not knowing this, continues to duel. Hamlet eventually disarms Laertes and switches blades with him. Hamlet then strikes Laertes in the wrist, fatally wounding him. Gertrude then submits to the poison and dies, warning Hamlet not to drink from the cup.

When Casbah isn\u2019t looking, Bugs hits him over the head, puts a mouse trap down, and gives him an explosive carrot.\nIn addition to tricking Casbah on the swing, Bugs pretends to kiss Casbah by using a plunger and hitting him on the head. He continues tricking Casbah by painting a bomb to look like Daisy Lou.\nCasbah is so excited by explosion of the bomb, he accidentally runs into the house. Once again, Bugs tries to trick Casbah by pretending to be Mr. Daniel Cupid and shooting him with an arrow. Casbah becomes enraged and finally sees through Bugs' disguise (\"You can't fool me no more! I KNOW who you are! You're that screwy rabbit!\" he shouts, clearly not realizing this description applies just as well to himself). Bugs tries to get Casbah out of hitting him by donning a pair of glasses (\"You wouldn't hit a guy with glasses, would ya?\"), but Casbah still punches him in the face, breaking the glasses and making Bugs realize he's angered Casbah (\"Ya know? I believe he would\"). Casbah then chases Bugs as he is now on the warpath against Bugs, who manages to escape into Daisy Lou's house and slam the door on Casbah's face.\nBugs sees Daisy Lou coming home and runs around the side of the house. Casbah sees Daisy Lou coming up the porch and thinks it is again Bugs dressed up as her. When Daisy Lou enters the house, Casbah hits her upside the head with a giant vase. Daisy Lou screams and, by the sound of it, proceeds to assault Casbah with every single vase in the house, throwing the last one after him as he flees.\nThe cartoon ends with Bugs showering Daisy Lou with compliments and kissing Daisy Lou after she has eaten an explosive carrot. Both Bugs and Daisy Lou think the explosive effect the carrot lends to the kiss is due to the other's romantic capabilities (\"What a man!\"/ \"What a woman\"), and they hop wildly and enthusiastically kiss again.", "tmdb_plot": "When Bugs arrives for his date with Daisy Lou and finds her out shopping, he puts on her clothes to fool his rival Casbah.", "tmdb_id": "237274", "wiki_id": "11020848"}, {"title": "Haredevil Hare", "genres": ["Animation", "Comedy", "Science Fiction", "Family"], "wiki_plot": "The cartoon opens with the newspaper ('The Daily Snooze) headlines \"Scientists to Launch First Rocket to Moon\" and \"Heroic Rabbit Volunteers as First Passenger\" (also with two titles that look as though they were pulled from real papers, namely, \"Big eastern interests\" and \"60,000 Greeks in big push on guerrillas\"). However, the scene then changes to Bugs literally being dragged across the launching pad to the waiting rocket as he frantically protests against what is to be expected of him, but then immediately becomes cooperative when he sees the rocket being loaded with carrots. The rocket is then launched into space. Shocked by the sudden acceleration of the rocket, Bugs attempts to exit it, but when he opens up the hatch, he is horrified when he sees that the rocket has now already left Earth.\nWhen the rocket lands on the Moon, Bugs has a panic attack, but quickly regains his composure as he starts to walk on the surface of the moon, contemplating the fact that he is the first living creature to set foot on it, while passing behind a large rock on which the words \"Kilroy was here\" are written. Another rocket soon lands nearby, called the Mars to Moon Expeditionary Force from the planet Mars, and from it emerges an unnamed Martian (later known as Marvin the Martian), who begins work on something that involves a missile and clearly concerns Earth.\nCurious, Bugs asks Marvin what he is up to, and Marvin explains he is there to blow up the earth. Bugs is initially not concerned, until he realizes the severity of the situation and steals from Marvin the missile's fuel source, a Uranium PU-36 Explosive Space Modulator, a small device resembling, and that operates the same as, a mere stick of dynamite.

Belinda is befriended by Dr. Robert Richardson, the new physician who recently moved to town. The doctor realizes that, although she cannot hear or speak, Belinda is very intelligent. She lives on a farm with her father, Black MacDonald, and her aunt, Aggie MacDonald. She wears plain work clothes, rarely goes into town, and only once to church. The family raises cattle and sheep and makes a small living grinding local wheat into flour at their small mill. Her father and aunt called Belinda \"Dummy\" and resent her because her mother died giving birth to her. Dr. Richardson teaches Belinda sign language and the signs for many common things and ideas. She learns to read.  Over time, his affection for her grows. He buys her a pretty dress and encourages her father to take her to town and church.\nDr. Richardson's secretary, Stella, is attracted to him and tries to get his attention, but the doctor does not reciprocate her feelings. After Stella figures out that he is becoming attracted to Belinda, she starts to resent both of them.\nOne of the family's customers, Laughlin \"Locky\" McCormick, meets Belinda when he and a group of young people stop by the MacDonald farm to pick up their orders of flour and ground grain. Locky is dating Stella at the time. Stella notices Locky noticing Belinda, and warns Locky to \"stay away from the dummy.\" Locky gets drunk at a dance, leaves the dance, and goes to the farm where Belinda is alone, and rapes her. This results in her pregnancy, which is diagnosed by another doctor to whom Dr. Richardson had brought her for audiology testing. Belinda gives birth at home to a healthy baby boy, whom she names Johnny. The people in town begin to shun the MacDonald family and Dr. Richardson, as they gossip that he must be Johnny's father. Dr. Richardson tells Black that he is willing to marry Belinda in order to quiet town gossip. Black rejects this idea, as he believes that Dr. Richardson does not truly love Belinda, but merely pities her. Boycotted by locals, the doctor leaves the small community and takes a position in a Toronto hospital. He writes Belinda suggesting he will return for her and Johnny.\nLocky goes to the MacDonald farm under the pretense of purchasing ground barley, but really wants to get a look at baby Johnny. When Black sees him, he orders Locky to leave. Locky inadvertently boasts about the infant son, saying, \"spittin' image of his father,\" revealing to Black that he is the father of the child. Black follows Locky and threatens to expose him to the town. They have a fight on a seaside cliff and Locky throws Black off the cliff into the sea, killing him. Town gossip calls it an accident and does not suspect Locky. They celebrate his wedding to Stella.\nBelinda and her aunt Aggie try to operate the farm but they are struggling to pay the bills and keep the farm running. Farmers boycott their flour mill.  The town, at the urging of Locky, has a meeting and declares Belinda unfit to care for the child and award him to Locky and Stella. They come to take Johnny.  Belinda first makes Stella realize that she is a smart and competent mother.  She also makes it clear that she will never give up her baby. Stella retreats and tells Locky that the mother should keep Johnny.  Locky demands the baby, telling his wife that it is his son. When he goes to retrieve the boy, he pushes Belinda aside. Before Locky can unlock the upstairs door, Belinda kills him with a shotgun.  Belinda is arrested and goes on trial for murder. At the trial, Dr. Richardson testifies that she was protecting her property and family. The court dismisses this as the doctor's love for her, and is ready to sentence Belinda to execution, but finally Stella blurts out that her husband Locky had confessed the truth about the rape to her on the day he was killed.

In anger, Prokop blows up the laboratory where he has been held captive, and with his coat loaded with explosives he confronts the princess, whose face dissolves.

Not knowing the reason behind the chase and figuring the odds are unfair, he intervenes, stopping them in their tracks. After some banter, Duke tries to leave, but one of the three men, Hank, takes a shot at him. Duke shoots Hank in the arm, and upset at the attempted double cross, Duke forces the men off their horses, and makes them take off their boots, forcing them to walk back to their destination barefoot.\nIt turns out the three men work for the Double C Ranch, and Duke has to stop by there to get his horse reshod. The ranch is owned by Charlie Cooper, a man who is running other local small ranchers out of business, but worse than that, he is depleting the herds of wild horses all around. The sheriff happens to be passing by looking for a suspicious man who looked like he wanted to rob a stagecoach before mysteriously disappearing. The three barefoot men arrive and tell the sheriff about the trouble Duke has caused them too. It's all enough for the sheriff to bring Duke into town for questioning.\nFortunately for Duke, two of the townspeople, Remedy and Terry, come to Duke's aid and give false alibis until the sheriff agrees to let the two take Duke into their custody, where Duke is expected to be an additional hand on Remedy's ranch. Remedy is an older gentleman who claims to have a remedy for every ailment there is, and we see this in action when fellow ranch hand and Comic relief character Curly complains of a toothache leading Remedy to go straight to a painful tooth extraction.\nMeanwhile at the Double C Ranch, Charlie Cooper's daughter Jane finally convinces him to not be so aggressive in obtaining horses from the wild. So he reluctantly agrees to leave the herds alone for a full year. But, Riley, an unscrupulous individual who has been taking over more responsibility for the Double C Ranch over the years, has no intention with complying with this new imposition. In fact, he stirs up trouble by having the Double C Ranch hands round up more horses and instructs them to leave a Double C Branding iron on the scene.\nWhen the other cowboys in the city question Charlie Cooper about this, he is puzzled and gets angry that he is accused of breaking his word. Riley stirs the pot even more by going to the sheriff and demanding that all the Double C guys under his control be made into deputies, reminding the sheriff that Cooper at the Double C is the one that gave him his job. So the Double C guys become deputies with the law on their side and they raid not only horses from the wild, but horses from smaller local ranches as well. Charlie Cooper finally finds out what his ranch hands are doing and confronts them, but Riley is able to choke Charlie to death with Duke Barnham's bandana.\nThe sheriff arrests Duke for the murder and a sensational trial ensues that the entire town attends. Based on testimony from others, primarily Riley and his group of guys at the Double C Ranch, Duke is found guilty. But Terry gives him a gun and he's able to escape into hiding.\nLater, when Remedy gets his mail from the post office, the postman asks if he can drop a letter off at the Double C Ranch along the way. Remedy reads it and it's a blackmail letter to Riley from one of his fellow ranch hands, Hank, saying he needs more money or else he'll reveal who really killed Charlie Cooper. Right then Riley's horse approaches, and Remedy panics and drops the envelope from Hank. Riley recognizes the envelope on the ground and figures Remedy has a blackmail letter, so he shoots Remedy as Remedy is crossing a river on horseback, and then makes plans to deal with Hank.\nSomehow Remedy survives the attack and delivers the wet letter to Duke at his hideout. Duke tells Terry to give the letter to the sheriff and immediately goes on a search to find Riley. They have a brutal fight in a hayloft, and both take a nasty fall.\nIn the epilogue, Remedy reveals to Duke that he has been taking a correspondence course by mail while he has been in recovery. He giggles with glee when a young woman arrives. He says his correspondence course was in art, and the course sent him a model.

Nearby at a tree, a sign reads \"No Hunting Before 6:AM.  As the clock finally strikes six, all the ducks fly away before George and Junior have the chance to shoot one. Then George and Junior spot a mother duck having her nest with an egg in it strapped to herself. George and Junior fire, but miss the shot, then watch as the strap breaks, dropping the egg onto the boat and hatching. Just then, a small duckling appears, starts dancing and taking off the egg shell, and jumps into the water. George and Junior point their guns into the water, but hear that no shooting is heard. George and Junior lift their guns, revealing that the duckling had tied the point of their guns together in a knot. The duckling laughs and jumps back into the water. The duckling goes under the boat and pulls out a drill and puts a hole in the boat. George and Junior notice the leaking, and as George covers the hole with his hands, water starts coming out of his ears, but are stopped by Junior, who covers George's with his hands. Suddenly, water starts coming out of George's ears, and is stopped by George, who stops the water by using Junior's nose like a faucet. George uncovers the hole, and the duckling honks his nose, laughs, and dives back in. George points his gun into the hole, and tries to shoot the duckling, but fails when the duckling snaps it shut with a clip. George pulls up his gun, but as Junior lets go of the clip, the gun explodes in George's face. The duckling then lifts the boat and hits it against the water. The duckling laughs and swims away.\nGeorge then heads to the motor, and tries to start the engine, but fails when it has problems trying to start start. Junior lifts the anchor and uses George's head to start the boat. As George and Junior chase the duckling at super-sonic speed, the boat's rudder blades cut the water in half, then the land in half, sinking a tree. Continuing the chase in the boat on dry land, the blades proceed to turn a log, two trees and a rock mountain into a bridge, staircase and ladder, and Mount Rushmore, respectively. The duckling and the boat go into a hole in a tree and go through another tree that has a hole. The duckling passes between two trees with the big tree suddenly lifting the small tree before the boat can do something to it. After crossing a mudpit and squeezing between two other trees, the chase temporarily ends with the boat and everybody crashing into a rock and getting flattened. Now chasing the duckling on foot, they stop upon a \"Stop School Crossing\" sign with an actual schoolhouse crossing the road. Chasing the duckling into a forest, everything suddenly turns black and white, the trio having passed a sign indicating \"Technicolor Ends Here\" where they go to have a look at it to read it. Going back into the color portion of the forest, the duckling stops at the edge of a cliff and spots Junior coming toward him and screams, prompting the duckling to pull out a bottle of \"Quick Grow\" and instantly turning a small plant into a tree which Junior crashes into. Junior then grabs an ax, and then puts it down to spit on his hands. George comes back, and Junior blindly uses him instead of the ax. Junior notices this, and puts George down. Then George spits out a little pile of logs.\nBack at the pond, Junior is sniffing out the scent of the duckling who dumps pepper into Junior's nose and places a pie in his hands. Junior sneeze blows the pie out of his hands and all over George's, the whipped cream and cherry filling looking like an outfit of Santa Claus.\nThe duckling jumps into a hole in a log. Junior then reaches his hand into the log, but fails to catch the duckling, who makes a slingshot, slinging Junior's hand into his head. George then points his gun toward the hole, but fails to catch the duckling, who pulls out a frightening mask, scaring and shrinking the gun, which screams and fires a shot and lets out some bullets. Junior grabs George's gun, and tries to shoot the duckling, but fails when it doesn't shoot. Junior pulls out the bullet and hands it to George, who gets shot in the face, leaving him in blackface. George hands Junior the bullet, which gets him left in blackface.\nNext, the duckling leaves his footprints in the ground. George and Junior's guns point to where the duckling is: in three different paths. George then gets out a duck call, and blows to call for the duckling, but is shocked when the duckling answers back with a smaller duck call. The chase on water resumes by George and Junior in their repaired boat. The duckling suddenly stops, and just as George and Junior are about to shoot, the duckling pulls out a STOP sign and points to the clock from the beginning which now has a sign showing \"NO SHOOTING AFTER 5:00 PM\". The bell rings, much to George and Junior's horror, but as they both scream in terror, the ducks come back, swimming, flying and doing another conga line, while the disgruntled George and Junior sit angry that they didn't even shoot one single duck.

In a voiceover narrated by Dunnigan, we learn that he was in love with Olga, although he never told her; we also never find out if she loved him. He has brought her back to Coaltown to honor her deathbed request to be buried there. He encounters hostility from the local funeral director who resents her because she never finished paying for her father's burial. After being pressured by the funeral director and the pastor of the larger and more prestigious St. Leo's Catholic church, Dunnigan goes to Father Paul, the priest of the smaller and poorer Polish St. Michael's church in accordance with Olga's wishes. Showing Dunnigan where Olga's parents are buried in the graveyard atop a hill, away from the dust of the mines, Fr. Paul sings, a cappella \u2013 in both English and Polish, the plaintive \"Ever Homeward\", the only song in the film.\nThe main flashback story then begins, showing how Olga is plucked from a chorus line in a nightclub to serve as the stand-in for an extremely temperamental film actress who is to star as Joan of Arc in a motion picture. Dunnigan realizes that Olga has the makings of a talented actress herself, and when the film's star throws a tantrum and walks out, he manages to convince Marcus Harris, the film's producer, to audition Olga, despite her having had no film experience. The screen test is a success and Olga is cast as Joan. However, as filming progresses, she shows signs of being seriously ill. After inquiring after her health from her doctor, Dunnigan is secretly informed that Olga has a severe, fatal form of tuberculosis, likely caused by her inhalation of the coal dust where she grew up. Desperate to do something for her hometown that will restore the pride of its bitter and disillusioned citizens, Olga continues with the filming, and collapses after the shooting ends. Rushed to a hospital, she dies with Dunnigan at her side.\nTo generate interest in the film, the grief-stricken Dunnigan desperately pulls a publicity stunt, convincing all five churches in Coaltown to ring their bells for three days as a tribute to the dead actress, paying them with checks that he cannot cover. Huge interest begins to develop in the unknown actress who gave her life to complete the film, and Marcus Harris wires Dunnigan enough money to cover the checks. But Harris calls Dunnigan and tells him that he has decided not to release the film, because the moviegoing public might resent greeting the arrival of a new star who has died. Harris intends to recast the role and begin filming all over again.\nOn the day of Olga's funeral, an overflow crowd which includes Dunnigan enters the tiny local church, which has never been so full. As the crowd prays, a loud creaking noise is heard, and the statues of St. Michael and the Virgin Mary slowly turn on their pedestals until they face Olga's coffin. The parishioners regard this as a miracle, even though Fr. Paul has already gone to the basement (to ensure the safety of the parishioners) and determined the ground has shifted\u2014causing the pillars which support the statues under the church to move because of the large crowd.  Dunnigan persuades Father Paul not to quash the faith of the people of Coaltown. Marcus Harris, after much reluctance, decides to release the film, which becomes a huge success. Fr.

He accidentally ends up near Loch Lomond, Scotland, instead of the La Brea Tar Pits, having once again not \"made that left toin at Albahkoiky!\", and mistakes a Highlander named Angus MacRory playing the bagpipes for a lady being attacked by a \"horrible monster\". Bugs jumps MacRory, trying to rescue the \"woman\", and in the process he smashes his bagpipes to pieces.\nMacRory becomes enraged that his bagpipes have been absolutely ruined. He yells at Bugs, and is about to threaten him, but Bugs figures out that MacRory is actually a man (much to Bugs's outrage) by pointing out to MacRory that he can't wear a skirt, not knowing it's a kilt (much to MacRory's confusion), and throws a barrel over MacRory for indecency.\nBugs then asks MacRory for the directions to the \"La Brea Tar Pits in Los Ahn-galays\", at first confusing then causing the Scotsman to threaten Bugs with a blunderbuss, telling the rabbit, \"There are no La Brea Tar Pits in Scotland!\" When Bugs realizes the location he is in, he bids MacRory, \"Eh, what's up, MacDoc?\", and runs for it just as MacRory shoots. MacRory chases after the bullet and picks it up (\"It's been in the family for years\"), reloads the bullet back into his gun, and shoots at Bugs repeatedly, who dives back into his hole (which MacRory fires into) and comes back out elsewhere moments later thinly disguised as an elderly Scotsman, accusing MacRory (whose last name is revealed by the disguised Bugs) of \"poaching on [his] property\". MacRory doesn't believe him, however, and challenges him to a traditional Scottish duel \u2014 a game. Bugs, upon hearing this, sets up a card game. MacRory corrects him, stating the challenge is a game of golf; as they head off, Bugs then asks MacRory: \"Have it your way Mac, but don't ya get a little tired running them 18 bases?\"\nThroughout the golf game, Bugs continually outsmarts the Scotsman. On the first hole, Bugs, focusing on swinging the ball, looks down at the Scotsman for tapping his foot impatiently. MacRory stops tapping, and sheepishly hides his foot behind his other leg. After declaring \"FORE!\", Bugs takes his swing and the ball veers off course, so Bugs quickly digs another, bigger hole to earn a hole in one (with the real hole shown to be off in the distance). Bugs then nails MacRory's ball to the tee so that it won't go anywhere (\"Fore!\" \"Four? Three-and-a-half.\"); but MacRory gets a hole in one anyway (through ending up in the hole himself), to Bugs' protests (\"A hole in one? Why, you little cheater! You little four flusher! Why, you can't...\").\nOn the 8th hole, MacRory laughs at Bugs, whose ball has fallen shorter of the hole than MacRory's. Bugs then turns his club into a pool cue, and hits a bank shot into the hole, causing MacRory to break his own club in half in anger.\nLater, after being seen hitting his ball out of a bunker multiple times to get his ball in hole 16, Bugs figures how many strokes to write on his scoreboard. After he goes through elaborate motions of doing addition in the air, he announces his score: \"Two.\" MacRory, not believing Bugs at all, counters: \"Two? FIFTY-FIVE!\" Bugs immediately sets up a fake auction, with Bugs acting as the auctioneer and continually lowering the score, until MacRory offers \"one\" as his \"final offer\", much to the dumbfounded Scotsman's surprise.\nAt the last hole, MacRory gets a hole in one. Bugs however misses the hole altogether and quickly digs a channel with his club for the ball to roll through into the hole. After checking his score, Bugs then declares himself the winner, whereupon the Scotsman angrily denounces the rabbit's earlier action as cheating. But Bugs defends himself with a list of phony \"historical\" citations where his action had also supposedly occurred: \"Cheating? Why, that identical situation occurred in the New Hebrides Open. Kaduffleblaze versus Fuddle in 19-aught-18. And what about Fradis versus Ginfritter? Hah! Bizbo versus Stoigen in the Casablanca Amateur. Cheating, indeed!

After playing, he dares Bugs to try and top that \u2014 which, to MacRory's shock, the rabbit does by dressing like a Scot and playing not only the pipes, but also a trombone, a saxophone, a trumpet, two clarinets, cymbals on his feet, and a bass drum on his head with the beaters tied to his ears, in the manner of a one-man band.

Jimmy Halloran, are assigned to Jean's case, which the medical examination has determined was murder. Muldoon has been a homicide cop for 22 years, Halloran for three months. At the scene, the police interrogate Martha Swenson, Jean's housekeeper, about Jean's boyfriends, and she tells them about a \"Mr. Philip Henderson\". They also discover a bottle of sleeping pills and her address book. Halloran questions the doctor who prescribed the pills, Lawrence Stoneman, and Ruth Morrison, another model and Jean's friend. Back at the police station, Muldoon questions Frank Niles, Jean's ex-boyfriend, who lies about everything, claiming only a business relationship with Jean and denying knowing Ruth. Because of his lies, Niles becomes the prime suspect. Later, Muldoon deduces from the bruises on Jean's neck that she was killed by at least two men.\nThat evening, Jean's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Batory, from whom Jean was estranged, arrive in New York to formally identify the body and tell the detectives that they have no knowledge of Jean's acquaintances. The next morning, the detectives learn that Niles sold a gold cigarette case stolen from Stoneman, then purchased a one-way airline ticket to Mexico. They also discover that one of Jean's rings was stolen from the home of a wealthy Mrs. Hylton. At Mrs. Hylton's Park Avenue apartment, the police learn that the ring actually belonged to her socialite daughter, who, to their surprise, turns out to be Ruth Morrison (having retained the name of Mrs. Hylton's previous husband).\nLearning that Ruth's engagement ring is also stolen property, and that she is engaged to Niles, Muldoon and Halloran take Ruth to Niles' apartment, where they coincidentally interrupt someone trying to murder him. The killer takes a shot at the cops and escapes down the fire escape onto the nearby elevated train. When questioned about the stolen jewelry, Niles claims that they were all presents from Jean, which reveals his true relationship with her, much to Ruth's chagrin. Ruth realizes she is engaged to a swindler and slaps him. Niles is then arrested for the jewel thefts, but the murder case remains open.\nHalloran learns that a body recovered from the East River, is that of small-time burglar Peter Backalis, who died within hours of the Dexter murder, and Halloran believes the two incidents are connected. Muldoon, although skeptical, lets him pursue the lead and assigns two veteran detectives on the squad to help Halloran with the legwork. Through further methodical but tedious investigation, Halloran discovers that Backalis's accomplice on a jewelry store burglary was Willie Garzah, a former wrestler who plays the harmonica. While Halloran and his team canvass the Lower East Side of New York using an old publicity photograph of Garzah, Muldoon compels Niles to identify Jean's mystery boyfriend. He reveals that Dr. Stoneman is \"Henderson\". At Stoneman's office, Muldoon uses Niles to trap the married, respectable physician into confessing that he fell in love with Jean, only to learn that she and Niles were using him in order to rob his society friends. Niles then confesses that Garzah killed Jean and Backalis. Halloran and Muldoon, using different approaches, have come up with the same killer.\nMeanwhile, Halloran finally locates Garzah and, pretending that Backalis is in the hospital, tries to trick Garzah into accompanying him, but Garzah (knowing he killed Backalis) sees through the ruse.

Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As Heart of Fire progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions. During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicky meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\nJulian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind Heart of Fire, but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter. Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of Heart of Fire. Lermontov hires Julian as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy').\nJulian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with Ballet Rambert in a matinee performance of Swan Lake at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, in a production with a company led by Marie Rambert (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and Monte Carlo. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, The Ballet of the Red Shoes, for which Julian is to provide the music. In three weeks creating the ballet together, Julian and Vicky learn to trust and respect each other as artists.\nThe Ballet of the Red Shoes is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalises the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.\nSome time later whilst traveling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to \"put on the red shoes again,\" to dance her famous role once more. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the premi\u00e8re of his opera at Covent Garden to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.\nJulian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky leaps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train, which hits her. Whether this is suicide or murder (by the red shoes) is left ambiguous.

His pet cat Sylvester is frightened by the creepy-looking place, but Porky finds it \"quaint\" and \"peaceful\" and looks forward to his first night there. Sylvester is already holding onto the bottom of Porky's coat, unwilling to let go, when he is spooked by a bat and jumps inside the coat. Porky chastises him for being afraid of the bat and says he is going upstairs to bed while Sylvester will sleep in the kitchen. Unknown to Porky, Sylvester clings to him all the way to the bedroom and into bed. When Porky discovers him in the bed, he kicks him down the stairs, telling him to stay in the kitchen. Suddenly, Sylvester sees that the house is overrun with murderous mice who are in the process of carting off the previous owners' cat to be decapitated by a mouse wearing a black hood and holding an executioner's ax. Terrified, Sylvester races upstairs and hides in Porky's nightshirt. Porky begins scolding Sylvester, who interrupts this by demonstrating (in mime) what occurred downstairs. Porky criticizes the \"ridiculous acting\" and orders Sylvester back to the kitchen. Too frightened to comply, Sylvester pulls a gun from a dresser drawer and prepares to shoot himself in the head rather than face whatever fate the mice have in store for the pair. Porky disarms him and cannot believe how desperate his cat is.\nRealizing he has no choice, Porky allows Sylvester to share the bed. Four mice push the bed out of the window and it sticks on a pole. Porky, half-asleep and thinking it is cold in the room, asks Sylvester to close the window. Sylvester proceeds to do so, himself barely awake and walking on thin air, as the pole springs the bed back into the room. Sylvester closes a tiny curtain on a birdhouse, gets back into the bed that is not there and falls to the ground. He comes through the bedroom door with a big lump on his head. At that moment, he sees that the mice are about to drop an anvil on Porky from a crawlspace above the bed. Sylvester grabs the anvil at the last moment. Porky awakes and sees Sylvester poised above him with it in his hands. Porky questions Sylvester's intentions before dropping it on the cat's head and leading the way back to the kitchen. Descending the staircase, Sylvester sees the hooded mouse roll a bowling ball down the banister, targeted directly at Porky, who has reached the bottom. Sylvester races down the stairs and shoves Porky out of the way so hard that the pig ends up in the kitchen headfirst in a laundry basket. Meanwhile, at the base of the staircase, Sylvester teeters and then falls to the floor unconscious after his head is flattened by the bowling ball intended for Porky.\nPorky storms back from the kitchen (not noticing the basket being lowered below the floor) demanding to know why Sylvester pushed him. Seeing the cat knocked out, Porky suggests it is just a ploy to gain sympathy. Over the next few scenes, as he lifts Sylvester, carries him to the kitchen and puts him in the basket, an oblivious Porky barely escapes many attempts, via several tools and weapons, by the mice to kill him. Sylvester, out cold in the basket, is lowered below the floor just after 1:00 A.M. and is raised up again just before 4:00 A.M., without the basket and with the normally black portions of his fur having turned completely pale gray. Traumatized, he makes his way to Porky's room where he startles the pig awake with his gruesome appearance. Finally at his wits' end, Porky drags him downstairs, and goes into the kitchen by himself to show Sylvester there is nothing to fear. After a few seconds of silence, Sylvester looks in the kitchen and sees the mice parading as they did earlier with the other cat, only now it is Porky who bound and gagged and on his way to be decapitated. As the mice take him away, Porky holds up a sign that reads \"YOU WERE RIGHT \u2013 SYLVESTER\". Sylvester is horrified and immediately flees out of the house. As he rests to catch his breath, his conscience (a miniature Sylvester wearing a wizard's robe and carrying a star-tipped wand) appears. He magically produces an easel on which the word \"coward\" is written; then, with diagrams and charts, he reminds Sylvester how Porky raised him from a kitten, shows him the \"comparative sizes\" of a cat to a mouse, and demands that he return to the house to take action. Reinvigorated, Sylvester grabs a tree branch for use as a weapon, then decides to use the whole tree instead and races back into the mouse-infested house to fight. He sends the hundreds of murderous mice running for their lives, much to his conscience's delight.\nWith the mice now all supposedly gone for good, Porky graciously apologizes to Sylvester and thanks him for saving his life. One leftover mouse (the executioner) pops out of the longcase clock behind Sylvester, wielding a large wooden mallet. Seeing this, Porky yells at Sylvester to look out, but the mouse clobbers Sylvester on the head, knocking him unconscious, much to Porky's shock. The mouse then yanks off his hood, revealing that he has transformed into a Lew Lehr caricature wearing a Napoleonic-era bicorne hat.

Wilson, whom Scott hopes to recruit, is much less enthusiastic, but Wilson agrees to go on condition it is a scientific expedition. Scott also visits Fridtjof Nansen, who insists that a polar expedition must use only dogs, not machines or horses. Scott goes on a fundraising campaign, with mixed results, finding scepticism among Liverpool businessmen, but enthusiasm among schoolchildren who fund the sledge dogs. With the help of a government grant he finally manages to raise enough money to finance the expedition.\nAfter a stop in New Zealand, the ship sets sail for Antarctica. They set up a camp at the coast, where they spend the winter and hold a MidWinter Feast on 22 June 1911. In the spring a small contingent of men, ponies and dogs begins the trek towards the pole. About halfway, the ponies are, as planned, shot for food and some of the men are sent back with the dogs. At the three quarter mark, Scott selects the five-man team to make the push to the pole, hoping to return by the end of March 1912. They reach the pole only to find the Norwegian flag already planted there and a letter from Roald Amundsen asking Scott to deliver it to the King of Norway.\nHugely disappointed, Scott's team begins the long journey back. When reaching the mountains bordering the polar plateau, Wilson shows the men some sea plant and tree fossils he has found, also a piece of coal, to Scott's satisfaction, proving that the Antarctic must have been a warm place once, and opening economic possibilities. The perceived lack of such opportunities had been one criticism leveled at Scott while fundraising. Nevertheless, Scott is increasingly concerned about the health of two men: Evans, who fell and has a serious cut on his hand, and Oates, whose foot is appallingly frostbitten. Evans eventually collapses and dies, and is buried under the snow. Realising that his condition is slowing the team down, Oates says \"I hope I don't wake tomorrow\" but when he does, he sacrifices himself crawling out of the tent, saying \"I'm just going outside; I may be away some time.\" (sic`; the words as famously recorded by Scott are \"...and may be some time\"] Finally, just 11 miles short of a supply depot, the rest of the team dies in their tent trapped by a blizzard.

The proprietor of a nearby hotel tells Blair that the auction is rigged in his favour, but instead there is a heated bidding war, with a lawyer for an unknown party making an excessive winning bid.\nKeramikos tells Blair that he knows he is not really writing a script and also claims that Mayne was a deserter from the British Army who worked for him in Greece. Blair begins falling in love with the Comtessa, who admits her real name is Carla Rometta. Also, Blair observes Keramikos speaking German with another man, understanding the conversation as he speaks a degree of German himself.\nThe next day Mayne invites Blair to go skiing. When Blair is made to crash by Mayne and is knocked unconscious, Mayne leaves him behind in the freezing snow and just reports by telephone to Wesson that Blair is missing. Carla overhears and telephones Mancini, who organises a search party and Blair is rescued.\nEngles arrives at the lodge, just before a snowstorm that leaves all the parties stranded for the night. At dinner, Engles confirms he was a colonel in British Intelligence and identifies Keramikos as Von Kellerman, a Gestapo special agent based in Venice. When Italy was being over-run by the Allies, Kellerman was ordered to transport the gold reserves of the Bank of Italy to Germany. He assigned the task to Captain Heinrich Stelben, unaware Stelben was involved with Carla Rometta. At Carla's urging, Stelben left the gold at the lodge and, after shooting his own men, reported he had been ambushed. One of the men is only wounded and Kellerman learns of the gold's whereabouts, which he wants to finance the rebuilding of a new fascist Germany.\nWhen Carla attacks Mayne after learning that he had agreed to kill her and Valdini (and that it was Mayne who had paid the 4.5m lira to buy the lodge at auction), he knocks her unconscious. Valdini throws a knife at him but misses and Mayne shoots him dead. Mayne is knifed in the back by Aldo on Kellerman's order. Kellerman produces a pistol, has Carla locked up, and orders the Englishmen to dig for the gold in the cellar. Mayne comes to and tries to free Carla but knocks over a lamp that sets the building on fire, then succumbs. When no gold is found, Kellerman does not believe that Engles does not know where it is and shoots him. In the ensuing fight, Wesson drags the unconscious Blair out of the basement. The burning lodge collapses on the others. Carla reveals that she knows where the gold is but, cradling Blair, declares she will never reveal its location, as it has caused too many deaths.", "tmdb_plot": "Good and bad characters are stuck in a ski chalet near buried Nazi gold in the Alps.", "tmdb_id": "116529", "wiki_id": "31011037"}, {"title": "So Dear to My Heart", "genres": ["Drama", "Family", "Animation"], "wiki_plot": "Set in Indiana in 1903, the film tells the tale of Jeremiah Kincaid (Bobby Driscoll) and his determination to raise a black-wool lamb that was once rejected by its mother.

Fully recovered by the time the ship docks, Mark persuades Olivia to allow him to take up residence in the lodging house she has inherited from her late husband. He proceeds to work a smooth line of seduction on her, while still finding time to also use his charms on the more worldly and vulgar Kitty (Moira Lister).\nMark's past as an art thief and forger is revealed as he reunites with former partner-in-crime Edgar Bellamy (Raymond Lovell) and the two plan a daring art heist. Things go awry, and they are forced into a rooftop flight, narrowly avoiding police bullets. Returning to Olivia, he tells her he intends to leave London to try to make good elsewhere. However, she has now fallen under his romantic spell and is prepared to do anything to keep him with her. The couple are in dire need of money, and Olivia is persuaded to insinuate herself into the home of her wealthy former schoolfriend Susan Courtney (Fitzgerald) and her older husband Henry (Raymond Huntley). She finds Susan in a state of neurosis and barely suppressed hysteria, worn down by the criticisms of the cold and sneering Henry, who agrees to employ her as Susan's live-in companion. Under Mark's urging, she immediately begins to pilfer stocks and bonds and small valuables from the Courtney household, passing them on to Mark to turn into cash.\nMark meanwhile has discovered an old bundle of letters from Susan to Olivia, containing youthfully indiscreet descriptions of romantic dalliances and questionable moral conduct. Realising that making public the contents of the letters would ruin the Courtneys' social reputation, he believes that he has hit the financial jackpot. As low as she has already sunk under his influence however, Olivia finds the notion of blackmail repugnant and a step too far down the road of criminality. She flees from the Courtneys and looks into the possibility of a return to overseas missionary work, only to find that a lone woman is not wanted. She finds herself sheltering in a gloomy church, where Mark somehow manages to track her down. In despair, she falls for his blandishments and submits herself again to his control and instructions, blackmail and all.\nOlivia returns to the Courtney household and sets in motion the blackmail plan, while Mark continues to dally with Kitty and gifts her a locket which was given to him by Olivia. Unknown to Olivia or Susan, Henry has become exasperated by Susan's apparent inability to produce the heir he craves, and is plotting to have her committed to a distant mental asylum. He has also employed a private detective (Leo G. Carroll), who has managed to trace the missing stocks and bonds back to Mark and has built up a dossier of his criminal past.\nHenry locks the horrified Susan in her room to await the arrival of the sanatorium doctors and orders Olivia out of the house. At Mark's behest, she returns to step up the blackmail threat, but is countered by Henry confronting her with the information he has on Mark, which would be more than enough to hang him. A struggle ensues, and Henry collapses with a life-threatening heart attack. Olivia releases Susan and tricks her into giving her husband a dose of medicine laced with poison. Henry succumbs, the police are summoned and the hopelessly confused and incoherent Susan makes what sounds like a confession to murder. She is taken away to prison to face the prospect of the gallows.\nMark announces his intention to take Olivia away with him to a new life in America, beyond the reach of British prosecution. Olivia however is conscience-stricken about Susan, and matters take a fatal turn when she runs into Kitty, wearing the incriminating locket. All her illusions about Mark's love for her suddenly shattered, she finally realises that she has all along been no more than a willing pawn in his game.

It centers around 17-year-old Richard Miller, who is about to graduate from high school, go to Yale, and step into the world of adults. He has a cynical view of the world because of all the books he has been reading. He has a girlfriend, Muriel McComber, whom he loves very much (she lives across the street) but she is afraid of being kissed. He tries to convince her as they sing \u201cAfraid to Fall in Love.\u201d He doesn't get the kiss but they do dance across the park.\nRichard's father, Nat Miller, editor of the town newspaper, is a wise man with a sense of humor that serves him well in facing the challenges of parenthood. Richard has three other siblings: older brother Arthur, who is home on vacation from Yale; sister Mildred, and mischievous Tommy, the youngest.\nAlso living with the family are his Uncle Sid and Cousin Lily. They are usually on the verge of getting engaged, but the uncle's drinking gets in the way. Uncle Sid is leaving for a new job in Waterbury, in hopes of making good (he is nearly 50).\nThe graduating class enters the auditorium marching to the Danville High fight song and smoothly transitions to an elegiac Alma Mater, and the camera pans over touching vignettes of listening townspeople, including a deliberate recreations of Grant Wood\u2019s \"Daughters of Revolution,\" \"Woman with Plants,\" and \u201cAmerican Gothic\u201d. Richard, who is valedictorian, plans to give a Marxist call to arms, but he leaves his speech where his father can see it and, during a round of applause, Nat stops him before he can get to the revolutionary material. After the ceremony, his father asks him if his conscience will allow him to drive the family\u2019s Stanley Steamer. A bright number built around the song \u201cStanley Steamer\u201d follows.\nDawn on a peaceful morning; the town is hung with flags for the 4th of July. Suddenly explosions erupt all over town as boys and girls (and a young-at-heart grandfather) set off masses fireworks.\nRichard, still spouting revolutionary propaganda and scorning the 4th, is surprised to find that his father has not only read Carlyle's \u201cFrench Revolution,\u201d but admires it\u2014as he does the Rub\u00e1iy\u00e1t of Omar Khayyam. Mother Essie, on the other hand, is horrified at Richard's choice of reading, which also includes Swinburne and Oscar Wilde's The Ballad of Reading Gaol, and says that this \u201cis no kind of reading for a young boy.\u201d\nUncle Sid appears, and Nat quickly realizes that he has been fired. To save him the embarrassment, he offers Sid his old job.\nAt the bandstand, a cornet player displays his skill, setting off the \u201cIndependence Day\u201d number. A tableau recreating The Spirit of \u201876 takes a bow. Everyone celebrates at separate picnics; each area has its own routine  to go with \u201cIndependence Day.\u201d\nAt the men's picnic, they have a beer-drinking contest, which Sid wins. At the women's picnic, they play croquet and share the delicacies they have cooked. The kids swim at the pond and the young people sing and dance.\nNo sooner has the Miller family returned home for dinner than Muriel's father arrives, accusing Richard of corrupting Muriel's morals. He saw Richard trying to kiss her. That was bad enough, but the letters Richard wrote to her are worse. When Nat Miller takes the whole things with a sense of humor, Macomber threatens him with loss of his advertising and storms out, leaving a farewell letter from Muriel to Richard, dictated by him. When Richard reads it, he is heartbroken, devastated and angry; he bursts into tears.\nAt the dinner table, a tipsy Sid has everyone laughing, but Lily weeps, saying that they all encourage him and laugh at him\u2014and maybe they shouldn't. Richard launches into a diatribe about women driving men to drink and marches out of the house. At the front gate, his older brother's friend Wint (Hal Hackett) invites him on a double date with some \u201cslick babies from New Haven.\u201d They turn out to be a couple of dance hall girls. Wint and Crystal (Ruth Brady) leave immediately. Richard's girl, Belle (Marilyn Maxwell), takes him to a bar to drink, although he is underage.\nLike the opening, this is a long scene mixing spoken and sung dialogue. It has a nightmarish quality that is enhanced by the  way Belle's costume changes, from pastel pink to scarlet and back, and the bright green wash of light over the background.\nThe bartender slips something into Richard's drink. He gets drunk but it has the opposite effect to what Belle expected. He starts trying to reform her.  Belle gets fed up with him and goes to sit with another guy. When that man points out that Richard is underage, the bartender throws him out. When Belle tells him that the boy is the son of a newspaper owner and could run him out of town, he throws Belle out.\nRichard arrives home drunk and miserable. The next day, Belle writes to Nat, reporting the bartender for serving alcohol to an underage boy.\nMeanwhile, Muriel finally finds a way to send a note of apology to Richard, through Tommy, saying she will always love him. They meet at night at the brook and finally kiss. \u201cWon\u2019t it be wonderful when we\u2019re married!\u201d Richard exclaims\nHe returns home in state of exaltation. His father says that it's about time that they had a serious talk about\u2014\u201ccertain women.\u201d Nat works himself into a state, hemming and hawing and mangling Richard's clay sculpture of Lincoln\u2014and never completing a sentence. Finally, Richard, full of concern, gives his father a drink of water and tells him not to worry, he is going to marry Muriel. (The scene was written this way to get around the censor, who refused to approve any language that came near the subject of sex.)\nSid and Lili are in the swing, drinking lemonade. Mildred and Art are out walking with their sweethearts. Mr. Macomber and Nat have been reconciled, off camera. Richard's outlook on the future is now brighter and happier. \u201cWe are completely surrounded by love.\u201d Nat says. Richard kisses his parents and goes out to look at the moon, waving goodnight to Muriel, who is standing in her bedroom window.

The first phase tells us about the fishermen's attempt to improve their economic circumstances. They demand a better price for their fish, urged by the eldest son 'Ntoni, to throw the wholesalers' scales into the ocean. The fishermen end up in jail. The wholesalers realize it is more profitable to have 'Ntoni and his friends fishing, so they have the fishermen released. 'Ntoni, who lived on the mainland for a time, had brought some new, open-minded ideas back to Sicily, and he tries to form a cooperative, but no one joins him. In deciding to do it on his own, he convinces his family to mortgage their house to buy a boat and starts his new life. A festive mood is present in this sequence, with all the village joining the Valastro family salting fish in laughter and joy.\nThe second part shows the Valastros' vulnerability. They realize that the price of being owners is high; they not only have to buy the salt but also work hard and not stop even in the hardest storm, risking their lives to be able to feed so many mouths at home.  When they go out in a particularly bad storm, their new boat is severely damaged, and the Valastros have no money to get it repaired.  At this point in the film, we see the other fishermen and the wholesalers mocking them already, convinced of the immutability of the prevailing social order.\nThe third phase of the film affirms the Valastros' vulnerability and traces their decline. The social and psychological consequences of the Valastros' attempt to change things are gradually revealed. They go out of work, no one wants to give them any opportunities, and the wholesalers are able to set the price for their fish. In the scene showing the wholesalers increasing the prices yet again, we can see the faces of the children registering amazement at the cruelty of the adults.  This was quite a common feature in neorealist films, and one almost sees this as an awakening of consciousness.\nThe family unit, so strong in the beginning of the film, breaks down. Now they have no family, no house, the grandfather dies, 'Ntoni's brother Cola leaves for the mainland to seek new opportunities, their sister Lucia loses her reputation, yielding to the seduction of Marshal Don Salvatore, and 'Ntoni starts drinking. Only the elder sister Mara remains strong, although she loses all hope of ever getting married because her family is now poorer than before.\nIn the epilogue, 'Ntoni finally overcomes his pride, recognizing the true cause of the problems of his kind and his class, and sees the need for collective action by going back with his two young brothers, Vanni and Alessio, to work as a day laborer for the wholesalers, who have bought new boats.\nThe entire mood of the film becomes oppressive since the camera never leaves Aci Trezza, except in the scenes at sea at the beginning and end of the film. The outside world appears only indirectly when 'Ntoni goes to prison, when the family goes to sign a contract with the bank, when a stranger offering American cigarettes appears to tempt the youngsters to move to the mainland, and when the old baroness honors the inauguration of the wholesalers' new boats with her presence. Some allusions to modern Italian history are also there. On the wall of the restaurant we can see an image of a hammer and sickle. One of the wholesalers suddenly says: \"The country is full of communism!\", and his colleague answers: \"Raimondo is always right,\" in a parody of the Fascist slogan, \"Il Duce is always right.\" At the end of the film, a faded text can be seen behind Raimondo:\n\nGo with determination toward people. ~ Benito Mussolini.", "tmdb_plot": "In rural Sicily, the fishermen live at the mercy of the greedy wholesalers.

Afterwards, Mike treats his hangover with some fresh air in Prospect Park and a trip to a Turkish bath, and then introduces Eddie to Mr. Gaboolian, owner of a \"riding academy\" of mechanical animals, including two horses, a camel, and an elephant, which has only two regular customers. Knowing Perry's love of horses, Eddie pays Mr. Gaboolian to hire Perry, but although she tries to apply her business skills to improve the place, business remains bad. Eddie buys the business with his last $800 so Perry will still have a job running it. \nOn Christmas Eve, a group of Santa Clauses converge on the academy at midnight to avoid going home, and Eddie sees an opportunity for publicity. He calls all the newspapers, who send photographers. Mandy and the Cheever sisters come too, and soon all are drinking liquor and riding the horses.

His letter of introduction from his father to de Treville, the commander of the Musketeers, is burned.

The young Gascon spots the very man and in his haste to confront him, annoys three of the most skillful Musketeers: Athos, Porthos and Aramis. Each challenges him to a duel. Upon learning they are all at the appointed place to duel the same man, the swordsmen are amused. Before they can begin, however, they are interrupted by Richelieu's guards, who try to arrest the Musketeers. D'Artagnan joins them in dispatching their foes. As a result, he is welcomed into their ranks.\nLater, d'Artagnan rescues (and falls in love with) Constance Bonacieux, a confidante of Queen Anne. The queen was given a matched set of twelve diamond studs by her husband, King Louis XIII. Foolishly, she gives them to her lover, the Duke of Buckingham, who is also the Prime Minister of Great Britain. Knowing of the queen's indiscretion, Richelieu sees a way to persuade the King to go to war with Britain. Richelieu arranges a ball and suggests to Louis that he have the Queen wear the diamonds.\nD'Artagnan and his three friends volunteer to travel to Britain to retrieve the jewels, but along the way, they are ambushed by Richelieu's men.

When they enter the suite in question with the help of hotel manager Schidlap, there is no one there and no body to be found. The room is supposed to be inhabited by a man named \"Silky\" Thomas.\nAs the boys show Gabe how the strangulation was done, using themselves and Schmidlap as figurines, Gabe's superiors, Madison and Jones, enter the room and mistakenly believe a crime is happening in front of their eyes. After some explaining, Thomas returns to his room, and since it can't be proved that something has actually happened, everyone leaves.\nLater, Slip helps Gabe find illegal gambling operations by collecting information on the street. The location of the operation is then successfully raided by the police, but as it turns out, Thomas is the one in charge of the gambling operation. Thomas receives information from one of his goons, Feathers, that Gabe probably can be bribed to back off, but when he tries to do so, Gabe threatens to arrest him.\nWhile reading the newspaper, Slip finds out that a man named Frederick X. Prescott has been found murdered, and realizes when he sees the pictures that it is the same man he saw being strangled in the hotel. Prescott's body was found far from the hotel, and the police sees no other connection between the two events.\nFrom Prescott's daughter, Ann, who visits the morgue at the same time as Slip and Sach, the boys find out that Prescott owned a share in the hotel, but very recently transferred the stock to Ann.\nAs part owner of the hotel, Ann gets Slip and Sach positions as bellboys, so that they can look further into the matter. Thomas runs the hotel bar and nightclub, and when he sees the boys he recognizes them from his room. Thomas learns that Ann is the owner of Prescott's shares.\nSoon a recently released gangster, \"Hatchet\" Moran, comes to the hotel and wants a room, saying he is a good friend of Thomas.

He is temporarily suspended for this.\nMoran mistakes Sach for a former gang member he used to work with, and when Sach performs a room-service to Moran, he is ordered by the gangster to drive the getaway car at a planned bank robbery.\nAnn tells Slip that she recognizes the coin they found as the one her father used to wear on a chain around the wrist. Thomas reveals to Moran that Sach isn't who he thought he was, and both Slip and Sach are called to Moran's room. They are asked to hand over the coin, and Slip accuses Thomas of being a murderer.\nThe boys escape the room through a window out onto the fire escape ledger.

When the Gophers, after deciding to ignore the \"Do Not Open until Xmas\" sticker, open it, they \"see\" jewelry in it and take the chest with them. The dog takes the chest away from the Gophers and opens it, only to be punched below his chin, as he bounces like a pogo stick.\nNo. 2: Gophers are quite fond of fresh vegetables which can therefore be used as bait that would attract them: The dog, knowing that the gophers are vegetarians, plants a row of radishes in the ground along with a turnip at the end of the row that is booby-trapped to an overhanging rock tied around a nearby tree, which the dog tests with a ball, triggering the trap successfully. Naturally, the Gophers pick up all of the radishes, and after initial trouble, take the turnip\u2014but the trap is not triggered this time. The dog then holds the string, but triggers the trap and says to himself \"Oh,No.\" before he is crushed.\nNo. 3: The gopher is a sentimental little creature whose feelings may be played upon to your advantage: The dog, calling himself Snookie, places himself in a booby-trapped carriage, with his cries quickly noticed by the Gophers. After discovering the booby trap under the dog (which includes a handgun, rifle, bomb, and grenade), the Gophers push the carriage up a hill, and then release the carriage with the dog in it down the cliff on the other side, leaving the dog howling as he goes over several hills (we see a sign that reads \"Next time try the train\") and vertically down a second cliff, where he crashes. As the dog claims that the Gophers missed his inner strength, the dog then falls down, stiff as a board.\nNo. 4: If all else fails (and it has), you must utilize the gophers' love of music: The dog begins playing what amounts to a one-man band of music, drawing the Gophers' attention as they start dancing to the music. The dog unsuccessfully tries to crush them with cymbals and a banjo that also doubles as a gun, but does drag them to the drums using a trumpet. As the dog tries to crush the gophers on the drums, they evade him and the dog and Gophers end up in the piano, where the Gophers have the dog \"trapped like a rat in a trap\", as the Gophers then hop all over the piano keys.

They decide to talk, and Osborne asks if Tarnowski is willing to give them a charter in his ship to the unknown island. Initially Tarnowski refuses, but then Osborne tells that during World War II he was a pilot in the US Navy. He had flown over many remote islands, and on one he reported seeing large, moving creatures that looked like Dinosaurs. He shows Tarnowski a photo, and the captain finally agrees to take them there. Before departing, Tarnowski introduces them to John Fairbanks (Richard Denning), an old friend of his, who agrees to help them with their quest. Fairbanks and a group of friends had been shipwrecked on the island with Fairbanks being the lone survivor of attack by the dinosaurs.  As Fairbanks had been drinking incessantly to forget the events of the past since his rescue, his account of the dinosaur island was believed to be the result of alcoholism and insanity.  Since Fairbanks and Osborne's stories collaborated, Tarnowski agrees to allow his ship to be hired, but specifies that no one in the crew be told of their destination.\nThey sail aboard Tarnowski's ship, heading for weeks in the direction of French Polynesia, where the island is supposed to be located. During the voyage, it becomes clear that Fairbanks is obviously becoming attracted to Carole, even though she is the fianc\u00e9e of Osborne.\nSome of the crew realize they are headed to a dangerous island, so they mutiny and attack the officers. They lose the fight and are forced to proceed to the island.\nThe next morning, the ship's first mate spots the island in the distance. As they approach, he spot a Brontosaurus. With the confirmation of living dinosaurs inhabiting the island, they become cautious. They unload supplies, and a camp is set up in a forest clearing not far from shore. Whilst exploring the island, they find two Brontosaurus and a Dimetrodon. Then, as they venture out onto the flats of the island, a crewmen is killed by two Ceratosaurus. Knowing these creatures can be a threat, the crew are ordered to guard the camp at all times.\nAfter a near fight between Fairbanks and Osborne because of Carole's safety, a Ground sloth appears near the camp. Carole screams and the men are alerted, but the sloth moves away quickly. The next morning they go back to the flats where they find many Ceratosaurus. The crewmen try to persuade them to leave, and when the first mate agrees with them, he gets into a fight with Tarnowski and is killed when one of the crewmen accidentally throws a knife into his back. The crewman is shot and killed by Tarnowski while the officers focus on driving away the dinosaurs with rifle grenades and explosive bullets. Fairbanks still tries to convince Osborne to leave the island but still he refuses. Eventually though, he feels he has observed the dinosaurs long enough and decides to leave shortly. Tarnowski, however, will not leave the island until he brings back one of the dinosaurs alive, which none of the other men think is right. He starts saying bad things about the men due to the overdose of whiskey he has been drinking.\nThe crewmen, knowing that the officers are not treating them well, try to steal the lifeboat and get off the island. The officers are alerted, but the crewmen are able to dodge their gunfire and escape. However, they are all killed when a giant wave topples and smashes the boat. The survivors come back to the camp and find it destroyed, because Tarnowski carelessly threw away his match. Knowing that they must soon leave the island, they gather wood and begin building a raft. While Fairbanks and Osborne are working on the raft, Carole is grabbed by Tarnowski, who plays a cruel trick on her. A Ceratosaurus arises but Tarnowski kills it with two grenades and kidnaps Carole.

Fairbanks meanwhile sets off in search of Carole.\nWhile Carole and Tarnowski are waking up, a Dimetrodon appears but Carole kills it with Tarnowski's gun. Next, Tarnowski tries to kiss Carole but Fairbanks arrives. The two men fight and Tarnowski is knocked out, giving Fairbanks and Carole time to escape. The sloth reappears and kills Tarnowski. As Fairbanks and Carole reach the shores of the island, they are trapped behind a rock during a fight between the sloth and a Ceratosaurus.

Staying at the hotel courtesy of night manager Dick Hebert, Marvin has the misfortune of being roomed next to Dee Dee and Henry Benson.\n\nWhen she enters Marvin's room, Dee Dee introduces herself as \"Dottie Blucher,\" and Marvin assumes that she is a penniless country girl come to the city, who has descended to sleeping with married men to get by.
