He is ordered to reoccupy a nearby deserted hamlet named Muc Wa on the Da Nang-to-Phnom Penh highway - which a decade ago had been the scene of a massacre of French soldiers during the First Indochina War. Barker and his executive officer, the career-orientated Captain Olivetti, get four replacements for the mission.

Hamilton is killed trying to rescue a badly wounded man who was left behind by a combat patrol. An anguished Oleonozski commits suicide the next day. When informed of the deaths, Barker wants to pull his troops out now that they lack an experienced leader, but this request is denied by General Harnitz forcing Barker to send Olivetti to Muc Wa. That night, the outpost is attacked again by a large force of well-armed Viet Cong, not the few dozen predicted by high command.

Qoravoy blackmails them to get some food and money, then leaves.\nQoravoy spends the night at a marketplace. In the morning a lynch mob accuses him of partaking in a theft. Scared Qoravoy confesses every crime possible and impossible, including murdering the man who is beating him right now. The crowd laughs and lets him go.\nQoravoy applies for work in an apple orchard, but warns the bai (landowner) that he lies often. The bai enjoys taunting his workers and beats them when that gets boring. As a result, when the workers need to report the news from the estate to him, no one wishes to go, and Qoravoy volunteers. But instead of the news, he tells a story similar to The Servant Maimundus: servants broke an expensive knife, when they were skinning bai's prized hound, who died from overeating meat of the bai's prized horse, who was worked to death carrying water to extinguish his house, which caught fire from a candle, which was lit over the corpse of his infant son, who fell from a tree. In the end Qoravoy is kicked out and paid with rotten apples.\nQoravoy sells the apples at a marketplace and meets his friend Aman, who now works as a sheep herder and invites Qoravoy to join too. Then the friends witness an unusual scene: the thief Sultan accuses a peasant of stealing his purse. Then Sultan forces the boys to testify in his favor.\nIn the next scene Sultan is partying with his gang and boasts how on a bet he stole a purse, put his ring inside, returned the purse, called police, made them arrest the victim, then felt so generous, he bribed the police to let the peasant go. When Qoravoy tries to leave, Sultan stops him, telling that now he cannot leave the gang. But then the gang starts beating a quack-doctor (who keeps calling himself \"Domla\" \u2014 a medrese teacher) and the boys slip away. Aman blames Qoravoy for his misfortunes and they part their ways.\nQoravoy returns to Tashkent. There he helps an old man to carry a sack of bread.

Monks in training must jump on a bundle of sticks floating in a pool of water to reach the dining hall.  Falling in the water requires the monk to dry his clothes off before entering the dining hall (by which time the food is all gone).\nThird Chamber: This chamber trains arm strength.  Monks must carry water in buckets with blades attached to their arms to keep the arms held straight out.  The chamber also serves as the monastery's laundry.\nFourth Chamber: This chamber trains wrist strength.  Monks must strike a gong with a weighted pole to the rhythm of the head master's striking his wooden fish.\nFifth Chamber:  This chamber trains eyesight.  Monks must follow a light without turning their heads, or risk getting burned by large sticks of incense.\nSixth Chamber: This chamber trains head strength.  Monks must headbutt their way through a corridor of sandbags and then place incense sticks on an altar.

His father, Don Jose (Hans Alfredson), is an artist and discovers early his son's talent when the young boy makes a sculpture of Don Jose with his food. \nWhen Pablo is old enough (and now portrayed by G\u00f6sta Ekman) his father takes him to Madrid, so that Pablo can study art. On their way, they encounter two robbers who try to hurt a beautiful girl named Dolores (Lena Olin). After a slapstick number in which Picasso defeats the two attackers, she gives him a bottle of paint, containing a djinn. With the paint from that bottle he signs all his paintings. \nAt the academy of art Pablo's talent is praised and awarded. When he returns home with a portrait of his mother Dona Maria (Margaretha Krook), he is equally praised there. Unfortunately, their happiness is ruined when Don Jose suddenly dies - or so it seems. At the funeral it turns out he's actually still alive. Despite this, Dona Maria keeps ignoring him with the words: \"Idioto, t\u00fa es muerta\" (= \"You are dead, fool\").\nPablo leaves for Paris, but has a hard time selling any of his paintings. One day his father comes to visit him, bringing the sad news that Dona Maria is dead. When Don Jose starts to eat an apple that Pablo used as a reference for his painting, Picasso starts to draw faster, still using the apple as reference.  The result is the birth of cubism.\nThis new style, however, is very hard to sell - until Pablo's father gets an idea from a fishing rod. He lowers the painting down from a window during a vernissage. The overall reaction is negative, with comments like \"Scandal\", \"Merde\", \"Oh, mon dieu\" and \"piss\".\nOne of the guests however, finds the picture both charming and marvelous and declares that she wants to buy it. This lady is none other than the great writer Gertrude Stein (Bernard Cribbins), who is attending the vernissage with her companion Alice B. Toklas (Wilfrid Brambell).\nAfter this, Picasso becomes the center of the artworld of Paris. Along with names like Braque, Matisse, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pompidou, Entrec\u00f4te, Carl Larsson, Karl-Alfred, Loulou, Dodo, Jou-Jou, Clo-Clo, Margot, Frou Frou, Jenny Nystr\u00f6m, Hejsan-Tjosan, Corselet, Omelette and Rembrandt (most of these names are just nonsense and mean other things than you might suspect). The Paris artworld also included Hemingway, who enjoys knitting, Erik Satie, Guillaume Apollinaire, Henri Rousseau, Vincent van Gogh and no less than two Toulouse-Lautrec. Along with Mimi, a waitress who gave Puccini the inspiration to \"Thy tiny hand is frozen\", the reason for this being that she is carrying a wine cooler.\nAfter this introduction to the artworld of Paris, the narrator tells about a \"normal\" day in Picassos life. It ends with a visit from Mr. and Mrs. Guggenheim from New York City. Although the Swedish American multimillionaire Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim (Birgitta Andersson) doesn't understand Picasso's art, she knows that it is expensive, and therefore immortal. She becomes a pest and at whatever the cost she is determined to become a part of Picasso's art and world. When Picasso no longer seems to be able to escape the annoying American, his two friends Rousseau (Lennart Nyman) and Apollinaire (Per Oscarsson) invite him to Rousseau's hidden forest, where Apollinaire reads aloud some of his poems for his friends. This gives Picasso an idea. They will have a masquerade in Rousseaus honor.\nThis masquerade has a lot of famous historic persons, most of them dressed as furniture. It all ends with Rousseau, while playing his violin, flying out the window and into the night of Paris.\nNow it's 1914 and Picasso and all of humanity is looking forward to a bright future full of liberty, equality and fraternity. This is all destroyed however with the coming of World War I and the headlines \"KRASH! BOM! BANG!\"\nIn 1918, when the war is over, Pablo once again meets his father, who has invented a new shampoo that will regrow hair. It has another effect on Pablo however, who loses all of his hair and gives him his famous bald look.\nShortly after this, Pablo gets the job to make the sets and clothes for the russian ballet. The ballet, premiering in London, is not a success however. Don Jose makes the dancers' food and all the performers end up passing gas. \nPicasso returns to Paris, where he meets Sirkka (Lena Nyman), a Finnish singer who sings a song that he becomes enchanted by. However, when it turns out that that song (which is essentially a recipe for making a kalakukko (the equivalent of the Russian rybnik or kurnik)) is the only one Sirkka\u2019s got on her repertoire, Picasso soon gets sick of it and leaves for New York City with his father.\nIn America there is a prohibition on art (a reference to the real Prohibition era of liquor). Pablo works underground and one day he is asked to deliver a set of pictures to a Mrs. X. It turns out that this mysterious woman is none other than Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim. She doesn't give up so easily, but Picasso manages to escape her flirting.\nWhen delivering art to the local gangster Big Mac Kahnweiler, Pablo, Don Jose and Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim are caught in a shootout between Big Mac and his rival Mr. Peperoni. The shootout is interrupted however by a police raid. A very foulmouthed cop accuses Pablo of being a murderer and states that art is a lethal poison. It all turns into an impromptu trial against Pablo with Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim and the two gangs as the jury. Don Jose, acting as Pablo's lawyer tries to defend his son, stating that Picasso's work is not art, but childish graffiti. However, Pablo is still found guilty and is sentenced to death by the electric chair.\nThe chair refuses to work however, and the electrician, a Norwegian named Grieg (Rolv Wesenlund), is sent in to fix it. It all backfires however and in the mess Pablo draws a door on the wall and escapes back to Europe.\nIn Europe however, \"the monsters\" -- Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco\u2014have seized power. Don Jose joins the German army and later on becomes promoted to the rank of Hauptbahnhof (a German word meaning main train station) in the SS, in charge of Operation Ostrich, with the mission to find opposition men in hiding. During the war, Picasso uses his apartment to hide opposition members. When the war is over, Don Jose quickly changes into French clothes, stating \"I like Ike!\", waving the American flag and singing My Old Kentucky Home, charming the Americans in pretty much the same way he did with the Germans.\nAfter World War II Pablo settles down at the Riviera, where he once again meets the love of his youth, Dolores, and her granddaughter (who, like young Dolores, is played by Lena Olin). Inspired by them Picasso sends his doves (animated birds) out in a world plagued by the Cold War.\nAfter a while, Don Jose shows up again with his new wife, who turns out to be Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim. Picasso is trapped by his own fame, he has become an industry and his house is converted into a museum while he still lives in it. After drinking the last of the ink in the magic bottle Dolores gave him years ago, he falls asleep and dies. At the same moment all the signatures on Picasso's paintings disappear, it becomes The Great Picasso crash. \nBut, as we find out, Picasso is not really dead. When everyone has left the room he gets up, waves goodbye to his paintings and fades into the wall.", "tmdb_plot": "Already in his childhood, Pablo Picasso shows talent for painting and is sent to the Academy of Arts in Madrid.

Freed's radio program is hugely popular with teenagers, and the Paramount show is expected to sell out, despite concern that the police will shut it down as they did with Freed's previous show in Boston. Local law enforcement, led by D.A. Coleman (John Lehne), targets Freed for allegedly inciting teenagers to wild and immoral behavior by broadcasting raucous and sexually suggestive rock n' roll songs, many of them by black musicians. WROL station management also dislike Freed's unconventional programming habits, including playing songs that the station has banned such as \"Tutti Frutti\" by Little Richard. Freed nevertheless rejects all suggestions that he change his programming style and feature more socially acceptable musical acts, such as Pat Boone. He also refuses to sign a statement declaring that he never accepted anything in return for playing a record, on the grounds that signing it would be a lie and that all disc jockeys, including those who have signed the statement, take such bribes.\nBecause Freed has the power to make a record a hit by playing it on his show, he is constantly besieged by record promoters and artist managers.  He avoids most of these people, but takes an interest in those who share his love for rock n' roll. He repeatedly rebuffs the aggressive record promoter Lennie Richfield (Jeff Altman), but is kind to Artie Moress (Moosie Drier), a young boy who is the president of a Buddy Holly fan club, and even puts Artie on the air to talk about his idol Holly. Freed also encourages Louise (Laraine Newman), a white teenage songwriter whose parents ignore her talent and disapprove of her associating with the Chesterfields, a black doo-wop group who perform her songs. Freed himself suffers discrimination when he takes a racially mixed group of teenagers with him to look at a luxury home he wants to buy; the owner refuses to sell to him at any price. Freed's own father back in Akron, Ohio also rejects him, returning a check Freed sent him and refusing to talk on the telephone with his son.\nThe Paramount show goes on despite Coleman's attempts to stop it, including a failed attempt at a drug bust. Louise is moved to tears after the Chesterfields, a late addition to the show, perform her songs to thunderous applause from the capacity crowd. Freed's feisty young secretary Sheryl (Fran Drescher) and his chauffeur Mookie (Jay Leno), who have constantly bickered on the job, finally bond over their shared love of Freed and rock n' roll, and begin a romance. Mid-show, IRS agents appear and seize all the proceeds from the box office, leaving Freed with no money to pay his artists. However, Chuck Berry saves the day by doing Freed the favor of performing for free. Jerry Lee Lewis, who initially had said he was not coming, then arrives at the last minute and closes the show as the police try to shut it down because teenagers are \"dancing in the aisles\". As the police begin clearing the theater with Lewis still performing onstage, chaos breaks out and the film abruptly ends, with an epilogue stating that this was Freed's last performance, and that he was taken off the air, indicted, moved to California, and died five years later, penniless, but that rock n' roll lives on.", "tmdb_plot": "This is the story loosely based on Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed, who introduced rock'n'roll to teenage American radio audiences in the 1950s.

Larry and Kent are accepted as Delta pledges and given the fraternity names \"Pinto\" and \"Flounder,\" respectively.\nDelta is on probation due to campus conduct violations and poor academic standing. Wanting to remove the fraternity from campus, Dean Vernon Wormer directs Greg Marmalard, the smug Omega president, to find a justification for him to do so. Various incidents deepen the animosity between Delta, Omega, and Wormer, including the prank-related accidental death of a horse that belongs to Omega member and ROTC Cadet Commander Douglas C. Neidermeyer, who has been bullying Flounder, as well as Otter flirting with Marmalard's equally stuck-up girlfriend, Mandy Pepperidge.\nBluto and D-Day steal the answer key to an upcoming psychology test from the trash, unaware that the Omegas have switched it for a fake. The Deltas all fail and their grade-point averages drop so low that Wormer tells them he needs only one more incident to revoke their charter and have them permanently dismissed from campus. To cheer themselves up, the Deltas organize a toga party and recruit Pinto and Flounder to shoplift food for it from a supermarket. There, Pinto meets a pretty young cashier named Clorette and invites her, while Otter invites Wormer's alcoholic, lecherous wife Marion. During the party, at which Otis Day and the Knights perform, Otter has sex with Marion, while Clorette makes out with Pinto until she passes out drunk. Pinto resists the temptation to have sex with her and instead takes her home in a shopping cart. He later discovers that she is the 13-year-old daughter of Carmine DePasto, the town mayor.\nOutraged by Marion's escapades and threatened with personal harm by DePasto, Wormer organizes a kangaroo court with the Omegas and revokes the Deltas' charter, confiscating the entire contents of their house. To clear their heads, Otter, Boon, Pinto and Flounder take a road trip in Fred's car. They visit an all-girls' college, where Otter poses as the fianc\u00e9 of a student who has recently died in order to find dates for himself and the others.

While the President's press secretary Jim Richardson tries to convince the public that no credible threat exists, the President puts together a team of specialists to stop the tomatoes, led by a man named Mason Dixon.

Eva's main concern is to be the mistress of her home, wife, mother, and loving sister. It is gradually learned through her dialogue with her mother that her life has had a large number of unfortunate setbacks: a husband Viktor (Halvar Bj\u00f6rk) she respects, but does not really have affection for, their son Erik who drowned when only 4 years old, and Charlotte never appears to have loved Eva as a mother normally loves a daughter.

However, the boy betrays Philip and informs on Lumden to the commander of his unit, who is none other than Roger Amberly. Roger goes to the Wares' house in search of Lumden, but finds only Anne. When Philip arrives, Roger recognizes and attacks him.

Jumping a few years later, both are playing with a grown turtle, Magnus carves \"J+M\" inside a heart on the turtle's shell while Jennie makes a cowrie shell necklace for Magnus. The scene then shifts to young Magnus on the beach spotting Jennie riding the turtle, heading out to open sea and disappearing beneath the water as he calls after her, then shifts again to his nightmare of the night his father, Lionel, was knocked into the water by an unseen horror in the cave beneath the house and part of his house on a cliff crumbling down to the beach as the storm rages on.\nFinally awakening and groggily gathering his things to go to town, Magnus sees a woman swimming in the ocean. He meets his childhood friend, Eric, at the docks. When Eric asks him where he has been, he admits he has been drifting for a few years. Eric introduces Magnus to Dr. Paulis, whom Eric is working for to finish his master's degree in marine biology. Suddenly, the boat lists violently to one side and the net they pulled up has been shredded by something very large and strong.\nThat evening, the three men are joined by Eric's wife, Doshan, for dinner at Dr. Paulis' house. He explains that he and Eric are doing teratology. Dr. Paulis calls out to Delia to hurry up with dinner. Magnus is intrigued by the necklace she wears, which resembles his own.\nAfter dinner, upon not getting answers to his question about his father's death from Dr. Paulis, Magnus steps outside. He again sees Jennie swimming by the boat. He jumps into the water to follow her, but he is saved from drowning and revived on the beach by the woman, whom he does not recognize. She returns to the ocean, telling him her name is Jennie Haniver. His description of the incident to Dr. Paulis is not taken seriously. Dr Paulis tells him the woman must have been joking with him, as \"Jennie Haniver\" is the name given to a sea creature of local folklore. But Delia later tells him the full legend; Jennie Haniver was a beautiful but vain woman who bargained with a mysterious god to save her from a violent storm at sea, and was granted eternal life at the cost of becoming a sea creature who can never again live on land.\nThe next morning, the police brings in Eric to examine enormous tracks on the beach. Magnus goes down to the beach and meets Jennie. Finally remembering her as his young playmate, he takes her to his father's wrecked house. He tells her some of his memories from childhood, while she describes the quadrilles her father would hold in their great hall. Then Eric calls him away to go out on a boat with Dr. Paulis. Again the boat lurches uncontrollably, forcing Eric to cut the cable to the trawling net.\nIn the evening, Magnus again confronts Dr. Paulis about his father's death. Paulis explains that Lionel was conducting tests regarding mutation in sea life when he was attacked and apparently eaten. Magnus asks him if he remembers the turtle from his childhood, and describes how he carved initials on the shell, for himself and Jennie. Paulis is dismayed.\nMagnus awakens to Eric and Dr. Paulis arguing. Eric wants to use the Horror, a harpoon-firing bazooka. Paulis, aghast at the idea, withdraws his support for the expedition. Eric collects Magnus and heads out in the boat. After some trawling, they again find something dragging on the line. Taking a small harpoon gun, Eric dives to try to save the net. He shoots at a form he can see only vaguely. It turns out to be Jennie. Eric and Magnus resume trawling. Magnus tells Eric he had been with Jennie the night before on the beach, and how she was his friend from when he was young. Eric does not remember her, and dismisses her as an imaginary friend. The trawl lines finally catch the turtle, which is so large it begins to tear through the net. Eric blasts it with the Horror, and allows it to run out the line, waiting for it to resurface.\nAfter sundown, the boat's power mysteriously gives out, the compass spins crazily. Magnus leaves the boat's cabin, finds Jennie on board the ship. She begs him to free the turtle, nebulously saying she made a promise long ago she will forever regret.\nAt Doshan's insistence, Dr. Paulis boards a helicopter to fly out to the boat. Upon arriving, he observes a huge shape underwater near the boat. The turtle surfaces, swimming quickly towards the helicopter, then leaping out of the water, sending the helicopter crashing into the ocean. Upon seeing the crash, Eric rushes out onto the deck, but is confronted by Jennie. To his horror, her eyes glow an eerie green, just as the turtle surfaces under the boat, capsizing it. Magnus climbs aboard the lifeboat amidst the wreckage and desperately tries to help Eric on board, but he is entangled in the line from the Horror. The turtle surfaces, its eyes glowing green exactly like Jennie's, before it dives down into the depths, dragging Eric helplessly behind.\nJennie approaches an unconscious Magnus lying face flat on the beach, sadly kisses him, then returns to the ocean for the last time.\nDoshan approaches Magnus in the graveyard where his parents are buried and expresses her horror at the losses of her husband and Dr. Paulis. Magnus tells her he is leaving Bermuda and wants nothing to do with the sea ever again. He walks away without noticing the statue of Jennie and the inscription \"Jennie Haniver, 1701-  , Lost at Sea\" on her gravestone.\nOn the ferry leaving Bermuda, Magnus removes the necklace Jennie had given him and sadly throws it into the sea.

At Smokey's house, the trio lament their financial hardships and hatch a plan to rob a safe at the American Auto Workers union headquarters. Smokey gets advice on how to crack a safe from local racketeer and loan shark Charlie T. Hernandez, who provides his expertise in exchange for a percentage of the robbed proceeds. Despite a few rough bumps, they successfully commit the caper but find only $600 in petty cash. More importantly, they also come away with a ledger which contains evidence of the union's illegal loan operations and ties to organized crime syndicates in Las Vegas, Chicago, and New York. They decide to blackmail the union with the information, especially after the union has issued a false statement claiming that over $10,000 had been robbed so they can fraudulently collect money from the insurance company.  Meanwhile, Charlie pays Smokey a visit, demanding to get his cut of the cash, but grants him a grace period of a few more weeks after Smokey pleads for more time. Shortly afterwards, Charlie gets busted by the police for his connection to an unrelated crime and attempts to negotiate a softer conviction in exchange for revealing information about the trio's theft and their blackmail attempt. This information subsequently gets back to the union and they begin to retaliate strongly against the three friends. Jerry experiences a near-miss one evening when a pair of hired thugs show up at his house to attack his wife, but both get intercepted and roughed up by Smokey. The next day at work, Smokey is killed after being trapped in one of the paint repair booths of the factory, unable to turn off the overhead sprayers and succumbing to the poisonous paint fumes. Although Smokey's death is covered up as a work accident caused by negligent enforcement of safety rules, Zeke and Jerry realize it was a murder coordinated by the union bosses due to the incriminating knowledge they possess against the union. Jerry sends his family out of town to stay with relatives in Manistee, Michigan to keep them out of harm's way.\nAn FBI agent, John Burrows, who has been investigating the union, attempts to coerce Jerry into becoming a material witness or cooperating witness against the union's corruption, which would make him an adversary of his co-workers and give him a reputation as a cowardly snitch. At the same time, corrupt AAW Union leader, Eddie Johnson, convinces Zeke to give back their stolen ledger and work for them with promises of a promotion to shop steward and increased pay. Zeke, encouraged by the possibility of new opportunities & changing the system from within, decides not to seek justice for Smokey's murder, as it would jeopardize his newfound standing within the ranks of the union. Jerry attempts to convince Zeke to avenge Smokey's death, but Zeke rebukes him, telling Jerry that nothing will bring Smokey back and that they should just move forward.  One evening, two gunmen, hired by the mob, follow and try to shoot Jerry in a drive-by shooting while they're traveling through a tunnel.  This evolves into a chase where Jerry attempts to make a desperate break for Canada via the Detroit\u2013Windsor tunnel. However, he ends up crashing his car before he gets there, and is arrested by the police. Disgusted with Zeke's capitulation and terrified after another attempt on his life, Jerry decides to contact John Burrows and cooperates with the FBI and a United States Congress Select or special committee (United States Congress).\nIn the end, as Jerry enters the plant with federal agents, Zeke confronts him. Once friends, Jerry and Zeke now turn on each other as a heated discussion escalates into the two attempting to physically attack each other.

Rural communities and the National Guard have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, but urban centers descend into chaos.\nAt WGON TV, a television studio in Philadelphia, traffic reporter Stephen Andrews and his pregnant girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are planning to steal the station's helicopter to escape the city. Across town, police SWAT officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income housing project, whose mostly African American and Latino tenants are defying the martial law of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The tenants and the officers exchange gunfire as the officers try to gain entry. Roger unsuccessfully tries to restrain Wooley, a brutal and racist officer, after he maniacally kills several unarmed civilians. Wooley is shot dead by an officer from another unit, Peter Washington. As the SWAT team dispatch the reanimated dead that have injured or killed several tenants, a disillusioned Roger suggests that he and Peter desert and join up with Stephen (who is Roger\u2019s friend) in escaping the city. An elderly priest tells them that several zombies are confined in the basement. He also tells them that the SWAT team is stronger than the residents, but that soon the dead will be stronger than the SWAT team.  The two go there and take on the grim job of eliminating all of them.\nLater that night, Stephen discovers the dead body of a security operator who had been guarding a traffic helicopter belonging to his employer. Roger and Peter join Fran and Stephen at a police dock and then leave Philadelphia in the stolen helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a shopping mall, and decide to remain there since there is plenty of food, medicine, and all kinds of consumables. Peter and Stephen camouflage the entrance to the stairwell which leads to their safe room, and they block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead from penetrating. This involves driving through crowds of zombies who are indifferent to their own injuries and attempt to enter the trucks. Roger survives a particularly dangerous encounter, and becomes reckless as a result. He is soon bitten by the zombies.\nAfter clearing the mall's interior of zombies, the four enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods available to them, furnishing their safe room with the mall's many commodities. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; when he reanimates as a zombie, Peter shoots him in the head and later buries his body in the mall.

Along with the police, Don makes a few other enemies through his merciless approach to running his organization. At this point, one of his henchmen Ramesh (Sharad Kumar) fearfully decides to leave the business of crime and escape from India. However, Don learns about Ramesh's decision and gets hold of him during his attempt of elopement, killing him. This introduces Don to his two new enemies; Kamini (Helen), Ramesh's fianc\u00e9e, and Roma (Zeenat Aman), Ramesh's sister. Kamini seduces Don in an attempt to have the police arrest him, but her plan backfires as Don outsmarts her and the police in his escape. In the process, Don kills Kamini, too. A shattered Roma swears to seek revenge from Don for her brother and sister-in-law's deaths. She gets her hair cut short, trains herself in judo and karate, and enters Don's gang after deceiving the members into believing that she too is on the wrong side of the law. Without suspecting any ulterior motive, Don is impressed with her fighting skills and allows her to work for them all.\nAfter several years of unsuccessful attempts, the police finally succeed in nabbing Don who, however, tricks them all and flees from the spot. During a police chase, he is badly injured by a gunshot inflicted by the police which leads to his sudden disappearance. That night, DSP D'Silva individually encounters a wounded Don hiding in his car and decides to take him into custody alive, to extract the source of the crime organisation that he relies on. While on their way to the police station, Don succumbs to his serious injuries in the car, botching DSP D'Silva's plan. \nStill wanting a chance to take down Don's gang, DSP D'Silva secretly gets Don's dead body buried in a graveyard while ensuring many people that he may still be alive. The only ones who are aware of Don's death are DSP D'Silva himself, the graveyard priest, and his followers. As luck would have it, D'Silva remembers his previous encounter with slum-dwelling simpleton and street performer Vijay (also Amitabh Bachchan), an exact doppelg\u00e4nger of Don who is currently taking care of Deepu and Munni, two motherless children separated from their father. Meeting up with Vijay, DSP D'Silva reveals Don's death to him and hatches a plan to have Vijay impersonate Don, so that he can get the police to arrest the rest of the gang and find out the source of crime that they all rely on. As a startup, Vijay and DSP D'Silva stage an \"accident\" that lands Vijay in a hospital under police custody. This prompts Roma and Don's gang, currently led by Don's right-hand-man Narang (Kamal Kapoor) to kidnap Vijay from the hospital and take him to their hideout, allowing him to infiltrate the gang under the guise of having amnesia.\nAround the same time, a poor widower Jasjit (Pran) is released from prison after being arrested by DSP D'Silva few years ago for a past robbery he was involved in along with Narang. Jasjit took the job only with the intention of using the money to save his ill wife from death, but was caught by D'Silva in the act which resulted in his wife's death. He also intends to reunite with his children Deepu and Munni who are currently being taken care of by Vijay as they went missing after Jasjit's arrest.  \nAs part of his mission, Vijay finds a red diary containing all the addresses and contacts of the criminals and even the evidences regarding their activities. He replaces the diary with a blank one and heads to DSP D'Silva's house to hand him over the real diary. While Vijay is climbing to D'Silva's apartment, Roma chases him and attacks him in an attempt to avenge both Ramesh and Kamini's deaths. Vijay survives the attack and tries to explain to Roma that he is not Don but she refuses to believe him. DSP D'Silva intervenes and confesses about Don's death to Roma, who apologises to Vijay and agrees to help him out in taking down the gang members. Using the diary, DSP D'Silva learns that all of the gang members are working for a notorious crime lord Vardhaan Makhija who is serving as the source of crime in Mumbai (even Don and Narang are nothing more than just middlemen reporting to Vardhaan). Despite this, there is no indication in finding out Vardhaan's identity as it remains unknown. Meanwhile, Vijay announces to the gang members that he has regained his memory after learning more and more about Don's past through the diary. \nHowever, things take a drastic turn when the police, acting upon Vijay's information, raid the hideout during the celebrations and DSP D'Silva, the only witness to Vijay's true identity, is shot in the crossfire while Vijay and the gang members are arrested as Inspector Verma and Malik mistake Vijay for Don. In the hospital, Vijay desperately tries to make a gravely injured DSP D'Silva confess that he is not Don. Unfortunately, DSP D'Silva dies from his serious injuries and Vijay is imprisoned. He is forced to escape from the police truck while on the way to a high-security jail, and the commotion causes Narang and the gang members to finally learn that Vijay is an imposter, just as they too escape from captivity, swearing to kill him. \nTangled in a web of confusion where the police refuse to believe he is Vijay while the gang members realise he is indeed not Don, Vijay learns that the diary (the sole evidence to prove his innocence) is stolen by Jasjit in order to track down Deepu and Munni. He meets Vijay and Roma who team up with him. However, the trio learn that Malik himself is actually Vardhaan who captured the real R.K. Malik (Pinchoo Kapoor) and posed as the latter to cover his crime, and that Vardhaan was the one who had murdered DSP D'Silva during the raid-up and had already exposed Roma's identity to the gang members, before having them kidnap Deepu and Munni so that the trio can surrender themselves and the diary to Vardhaan. After being captured by Vardhaan, Jasjit is reunited with Deepu and Munni and manages to escape the hideout with them, thanking Vijay for taking care of his children. \nMeeting up in the same graveyard where Don was buried, Vardhaan and his gang members who are holding Deepu and Munni hostages, have a long standoff with Vijay, Roma and Jasjit, resulting in Vardhaan grabbing the diary from Roma and throwing it in a fire. Eventually, he calls Inspector Verma and the police to the scene to have the trio and the gang members arrested so that he can get away scot-free. However, anticipating the possibility that Vardhaan would try to escape, Vijay cleverly reveals that the diary that he had thrown in the fire was actually the blank one that he had switched, just as he hands over the real diary to Verma, exposing Vardhaan's identity and occupation to the police. Eventually, Vardhaan and the gang members are arrested and sent to prison for their crimes while all charges against Vijay are dropped.

These three storylines are intertwined. Early in the film, we see early scenes from the play being rehearsed, the play\u2019s director and Maya argue about Maya\u2019s (first) interpretation of the character of Medea, and Brenda Collins is introduced.

Early in the film, one of Maya's BBC contacts manages to arrange a publicity stunt for Maya, in which Maya will meet an American woman, Brenda Collins, who was imprisoned several years earlier for the murder of her three young children. The Collins family had lived in a suburb of Athens, Glyfada. Brenda committed the murders to punish her husband, Roy, for having an affair with a Greek woman. The press at the time called her \"the Medea of Glyfada.\" Maya happily imagines what the headlines will be after their meeting: \"The Two Medeas.\"\nThe publicity stunt ends in disaster. Brenda is initially happy and excited about talking with Maya, having never met a movie star before, but she is frightened and then infuriated when the press suddenly rushes into the interview room, snapping photos. She screams obscenities and curses at Maya as a nun pulls Brenda out of the room. Maya is horrified at how the stunt turned out and later sends flowers and a note of apology to Brenda. Brenda agrees to meet Maya again, and the two establish something of a friendship.\nTo learn more about Brenda Collins, Maya goes to see the publisher of the Kathimerini newspaper, a woman she already knows. She shows Maya the records the paper still has from their coverage of the case, including crime-scene photos, a copy of the note Brenda left for Roy after the murders, and the notes of a psychologist who examined Brenda after the murders. Maya also visits the Collins' former house (which has remained unoccupied\u2014the chalk outlines are still on the floor, showing where the children's bodies were found) and meets with Brenda several more times at the prison.\nBrenda Collins is a deeply religious woman. She had been devoted to her husband and children and had begged Roy to stop his affair, but he treated her and her faith with disdain. She talks about the events leading up to the murders and the murders themselves with a mix of anguish and fury and a mix of obscenities and quotes from the Bible. She says that she did not kill her children with the story of Medea in mind; she tells Maya that she didn't understand the reference when the press first started calling her a \"Medea.\"\nMaya's research into Brenda's case, looking at it from Brenda's point of view and having rethought difficult events in her own life (in particular, her relationship with her own somewhat estranged husband and her friendship with and later mistreatment of Maria\u2014who was once an actress and is now the prompter for the stage production), causes Maya to rethink her portrayal of Medea.

No one knows the content of the script or its author who Craig claims is a new writer by the name of Malcolm Hart.\nBret Easton (Vince Edwards) is a popular American film actor, director and producer who lives and makes films in Europe.  His most recent film is about a revolution and uprising in a third world country in which he portrays the leader of the revolutionaries in the film.

The bomb blast kills Constance and injures Craig who is taken to a local hospital.\nThe police inform Craig that he was the intended target of the bomb and the type of bomb that was used is the trademark of an assassin who works for a terrorist group that has been staging attacks across Europe. Craig starts his own investigation in an attempt to avenge Constance's murder.  He meets a reporter, Gail McKinnon (Erin Gray) who wants to interview him.

These cities are Washington, D.C., New York City, and Miami, Florida.\nBombs have been planted on three flying commercial airliners and set to detonate in flight so the terrorist-controlled jets can impersonate the legitimate commercial flights.

Easton confirms Craig's suspicions while boasting about his grand plans and then tries to murder him.  A violent brawl ensues and Easton tries to stab Craig with a small sharpened boat anchor.  Craig gets a hold of a revolver that he had taken off a dead terrorist before he boarded the yacht and shoots Easton dead.\nJesse and Gail use the radio-telephone on the yacht to contact General Olson.

A gunfight ensues between a SWAT team and an armed murderer who is shot, after which the team enters the killer's house to find his family stabbed to death; Gr\u00f6ss questions whether the man's actions were caused by society. As criminal Larry DeSilva is executed by electric chair, Gr\u00f6ss questions \"if two wrongs make a right\".\nGr\u00f6ss visits a Chinese Morgue, where Dr. Thomas Noguchi is performing the embalming process on multiple corpses after their autopsies. One cadaver is a pale, horrifically bloated drowned woman; the other a decapitated man whose skin is peeled off his skull for examination. Gr\u00f6ss askes Noguchi for his thoughts on his own embalming process after he dies, to which he replies, \"life is purely a transitory state\". One cadaver, Samuel Berkowitz, has his bodily fluids replaced with a liquid with a low freezing point, and his body stored in a freezer with 24/7 maintenance. Gr\u00f6ss explains the purpose of this \"particularly costly\" process is to preserve the body for future sciences to revive him.\nThe next segment displays war and atrocities in history, including the Holocaust. The segment ends with Nazis being obliterated in battle, with Gr\u00f6ss adding that Hitler \"lost control not only of his army, but of his mind\". Footage of a woman jumping from 23 stories and hitting the concrete is shown. Gr\u00f6ss admits that suicide is a face of death he wishes to never face again.\nFootage of animals dying due to litter and pollution is shown, followed by sick children in impoverished villages due to polluted lands and famine. More of the \"horrific nature of man\" is examined with footage of a cannibalistic cult eating the innards of a cadaver stolen from a morgue and partaking in an orgy after. Gr\u00f6ss abruptly leaves, fearing for the safety of him and his crew.\nFootage of several more tragic accidents is shown, culminating in a scene of a wing walker attempting a parachute jump from his plane but dying after the parachute fails to open properly. Gr\u00f6ss disputes the notion that this death was quick and painless, as he would have been conscious and aware for the entire fall to the ground. The segment ends with photographs, footage and air traffic control audio from the crash of PSA Flight 182 and its grisly aftermath of scattered mutilated body parts and numerous destroyed houses. Gr\u00f6ss states that the neighborhood still smells like \"rotting bodies and jet fuel\", and that a mutilated body with only its torso and right hand \"is the worst face of death\".\nGr\u00f6ss introduces his next topic, the role of supernatural forces in death. He meets with architect Joseph Binder, whose wife and son both died under tragic circumstances. He confides to the viewer that he believes his family remain as ghosts in his house, attempting to communicate with him. Gr\u00f6ss enlists the services of parapsychologists to verify this. The team takes photographs of footprints and two apparitions. Binder communicates with the spirits of his family through a medium, seemingly confirming the existence of life after death.\nAfter studying Binder's case, Gr\u00f6ss concludes, \"when we die, it isn't really the end\" as \"the soul in each of us remains a traveller forever\". Gr\u00f6ss ends by questioning whether death is \"the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end\" and leaves the footage he has shown to the viewer's interpretation. The film ends with peaceful music, footage of a baby's birth and photos of the child growing up happily.", "tmdb_plot": "A collection of death scenes, ranging from TV-material to home-made super-8 movies.

All are shocked when it is confirmed Fedora committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a train.\nOne of her mourners at her funeral is aging has-been Hollywood producer Barry \"Dutch\" Detweiler, who was once Fedora's lover. Dutch recalls visiting Fedora two weeks before her death at her villa near Corfu in order to convince her to come out of retirement for a new screen adaptation of Anna Karenina. Dutch is suspicious when Fedora seems confused, disheveled, and cannot remember details of their love affair. Fedora tells him she is a prisoner on the island, held captive by the elderly Polish Countess Sobryanski, her overprotective servant Miss Balfour, her chauffeur Kritos, and Dr. Vando, the cosmetic surgeon responsible for keeping Fedora looking so young. Dutch attempts to help Fedora flee the island, but Kritos knocks him unconscious. He awakens a week later to discover Fedora has killed herself. Dutch suspects she was murdered by the countess for revealing the secret of her captivity.\nAt the funeral, Dutch accuses Vando and the countess of murdering Fedora. The countess reveals that in fact she is Fedora, with whom Dutch had the affair. The woman who died was her daughter Antonia, who took her mother's place after one of Fedora's surgical treatments disfigured her face. Antonia closely resembled her mother physically but was a much better actress, causing people to believe Fedora herself had become more skillful with age.

She begged her mother to be allowed to tell Michael the truth, but the scandal would have ruined both Antonia's career and Fedora's legacy.

He plans to steal a monthly shipment of gold from the London to Folkestone train which is meant as payment for British troops fighting in the Crimean War. The gold is heavily guarded in two heavy safes in the baggage car, each of which has two locks, requiring a total of four keys. Pierce recruits Robert Agar, a pickpocket and screwsman. Pierce's mistress Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down) and his chauffeur Barlow (George Downing) join the plot, and a train guard, Burgess, is bribed into participation. The executives of the bank who arrange the gold transport, the manager Mr. Henry Fowler and the president Mr. Edgar Trent, each possess a key; the other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the South Eastern Railway at the London Bridge railway station. In order to hide the robbers' intentions, wax impressions are to be made of each of the keys.\nPierce ingratiates himself with Trent by feigning a shared interest in ratting. He also begins courting Trent's spinster daughter, Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd), and learns from her the location of her father's key. Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent's home at night, manage to locate the hidden key and make a wax impression before making a clean getaway despite a close call with the butler.\nPierce targets Fowler through his weakness for prostitutes. Miriam reluctantly poses as \"Madame Lucienne\", a high-class courtesan in an exclusive bordello. Miriam meets with Fowler and asks him to undress, forcing him to remove the key worn round his neck. While Fowler is distracted by Miriam, Agar makes an impression of his key. Pierce then stages a phony police raid to rescue Miriam, forcing Fowler to flee to avoid a scandal.\nThe keys at the train station prove a much harder challenge. After a daytime diversionary tactic with a child pickpocket fails because Agar cannot wax them in the time available, Pierce decides to \"crack the crib\" at night. The whole operation is a matter of timing, because the officer guarding the railway office at night leaves his post only once, for seventy-five seconds (to go to the toilet). Pierce plans to use \"snakesman\" (cat burglar) Clean Willy to climb the station's wall, climb down into the station, enter the office via a small skylight in the office ceiling, and open the office door and the key cabinet from within. Because Clean Willy is incarcerated at Newgate Prison, Pierce and Agar first have to arrange for him to break out, using a public execution as a distraction. With Willy's help, the criminals succeed in making wax impressions of the keys without detection.\nClean Willy is subsequently arrested after being caught pick-pocketing and informs on Pierce. The police use Willy to lure Pierce into a trap, but the master cracksman easily eludes capture. Clean Willy escapes from his captors, but is murdered by Barlow on Pierce's orders. The authorities, now aware that a robbery is imminent, increase security by having the baggage car padlocked from the outside until the train arrives at its destination and forbidding anyone but the guard to travel in the baggage van. Any container large enough to hold a man must be opened and inspected before it is loaded on the train.\nPierce smuggles Agar into the baggage car disguised as a corpse in a coffin.  Pierce plans to reach the car across the coach roofs while the train is under way, but he and Miriam encounter Fowler, who is riding the train to Folkestone to accompany the shipment. After arranging for Miriam to travel in the same compartment as Fowler to divert his attention, Pierce travels down the roof of the train and unlocks the baggage van's door from the outside.  He and Agar replace the gold with lead bars and toss the bags of gold off the train at a prearranged point. However, soot from the engine's smoke has stained Pierce's skin and clothes and he is forced to borrow Agar's suit, which is much too small for him. The jacket splits across the back when he disembarks at Folkestone. The police quickly become suspicious and arrest him before he can rejoin his accomplices.\nPierce is put on trial for the robbery.

To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \"Force 10\", an American sabotage unit led by US Army Rangers Lieutenant Colonel Mike Barnsby and steal a bomber. They are joined by Weaver, a Medical Corps sergeant arrested by the Military Police, and escape, only to be shot down by the Luftwaffe. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Lieutenant Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) escape the crippled plane.\nThe survivors come upon a band of men they believe to be partisans but are later revealed as collaborationist Chetniks led by Captain Drazak. Taken prisoner, they tell the German commander in control of the area, Major Schroeder, that they are deserters. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's explosives suitcase, Mallory claims it contains the new drug \"penicillin\" which will spoil if exposed. The next morning the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. They improvise an excuse, \"admitting\" they buried the samples. Schroeder sends Barnsby and Mallory to retrieve them under the guard of his concubine Maritza and three soldiers. Miller, Weaver, and Reynolds are left in camp.\nFar from camp, Maritza kills the Germans, revealing herself to be a partisan and the person who hid the explosives. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the partisan camp under the command of her father, Major Petrovich. Mallory and Barnsby escape and meet a patrol of real Yugoslav partisans led by Lescovar, who has gained Petrovich's trust. Mallory and Barnsby are taken to the camp, which lies near a hydroelectric dam. An arch bridge spanning the river ravine is set to be used by a German force for an impending assault on the partisans, who have been unable to destroy the bridge. Barnsby reveals that the bridge is Force 10's target.\nMallory convinces Petrovich to mount a rescue mission of demolitions expert Miller, using Lescovar and Marko, a loyal partisan. The four re-enter the camp at night, with Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives, and Lescovar and Marko disguised as Chetniks. Drazak discovers that Maritza must have helped Miller and Mallory escape, and begins beating her viciously. Schroeder and Reynolds are killed in a gun battle, but the others escape with a badly beaten Maritza and the recovered explosives.\nMiller reveals that the bridge is impregnable, which Barnsby refuses to accept. Mallory hits upon the idea of destroying the upstream dam, to use the sudden onrush of millions of gallons of water to destroy the bridge. A night-time air drop is arranged to replace Force 10's lost supplies, but Lescovar, revealed to be the saboteur, calls in German planes to stop the drop. Maritza catches Lescovar in the act, but he kills her before she can warn the others, and German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone, killing numerous partisans.\nPetrovich, angered by the botched air drop, orders the men to be sent to Marshal Tito's headquarters for transport back to Italy. Accompanied by Lescovar and Marko, the team instead infiltrates the German marshaling yards at Mostar to steal explosives. Lescovar again betrays them, alerting a German sergeant to their presence. Marko sacrifices himself to save the others, who escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar is questioned by the others, who have grown suspicious of him. Lescovar initially denies the accusations, but gives himself away and is shot dead by Barnsby, who then asks Mallory to return the favour by helping him accomplish Force 10's mission.\nJumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver run a diversion, while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam. Weaver runs into Captain Drazak and kills him in a knife fight. Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam; its structural integrity compromised by the blast, the dam wall bursts, releasing a torrent of water that topples the bridge.

Driving home, Gloria picks up an attractive man named Bob \"Scotty\" Scott (Bruce Solomon) when she encounters him next to his broken down car at Powell and Market streets. She impulsively accepts Scotty's invitation to join him at the movies that evening, and before they part ways, he asks her to take his pack of cigarettes to help him curb his smoking. Unknown to her, Scotty has secreted a roll of undeveloped film in the cigarette pack. That evening, a seriously wounded Scotty meets Gloria in the movie theater and asks her about the film. He bleeds into her popcorn and warns her to \"beware of the dwarf\" before he dies.

At home she tells her elderly neighbour/landlord Mr. Hennessey (Burgess Meredith) of the events.\nAt the end of the next day, Gloria is attacked in her library by albino Whitey Jackson (William Frankfather) who tries to use ether on her.

When he attempts to strangle her with a scarf, Gloria stabs him in the stomach with a pair of knitting needles and calls the police for help. When the attacker tries to stop her, he is killed by a knife thrown by Whitey through the kitchen window, and Gloria faints in shock.

Now assigned to protect Gloria from her would-be killers, Tony later takes her to his houseboat, where the two fall in love.\nWhen Tony and Fergie discover that the limousine is registered to the archdiocese of San Francisco, they visit the office of Archbishop Thorncrest (Eugene Roche), unaware that their interviewee is actually the archbishop's twin brother Charlie, who is involved in a plot to assassinate Pope Pius XIII (played by prominent San Francisco businessman Cyril Magnin) during his upcoming visit to San Francisco, and has murdered his twin in order to impersonate him. The following day, Rupert kidnaps Fergie and uses him to lure Gloria into a trap. She manages to hide in a massage parlor, where she encounters Stanley yet again, but Whitey and Stiltskin then find and abduct her.\nAt Gloria's request, Stella has researched an organization known as the Tax the Churches League, and discovered that the league is a radical fringe group founded by Delia Darrow and her husband. For the Darrows, organized religion is a corrupt, greedy sham involving powerful billion-dollar corporations. Stella gives the results of her findings to Tony, who returns to the archbishop's residence with Mr. Hennessy. Sneaking into the wine cellar, Tony discovers the imprisoned Fergie, who informs him that the Darrows hired Stiltskin to assassinate the Pope during a performance of The Mikado at the San Francisco Opera House that evening. Tony is attacked by Rupert and kills him in self-defense by toppling shelves of wine upon him, but the fake archbishop's assistant Gerda Caswell (Rachel Roberts), who is really Delia Darrow, holds him and Gloria at gunpoint.\nDarrow then details her \"contingency plan\" to eliminate the pope: If the pope is not dead at the end of act I, Whitey Jackson will open fire from one of the auditorium's two organ bays (\"He will also open fire should the pope unexpectedly leave his seat, or if the police arrive in the auditorium\", Darrow explains). Mr. Hennessy knocks out Charlie and defeats Delia in a duel of martial arts, after which Tony and Gloria drive to the opera house, having some unusual problems along the way (such as crashing into an Italian restaurant and commandeering an airport limousine carrying a pair of Japanese tourists). After making it backstage, Gloria is grabbed by Jackson, who kills one of several security guards who have joined the pursuit. An enraged Gloria attempts to attack Jackson, who simply shoves her to the floor. This gives Tony the room he needs to shoot the albino, thus thwarting the plan to kill the pope.

Still obsessed with his football destiny, Farnsworth/Joe buys the Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince and then secure the help of a longtime friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with Betty Logan, an environmental activist, whom he met when she came to his doorstep to protest the original Farnsworth's corporate policies.\nWith the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, all the characters face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Joe that he must give up Farnsworth's body as well. Joe resists but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else, possibly another quarterback, and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott finally shoots Farnsworth/Joe dead. The Rams are forced to start Tom Jarrett, another quarterback, in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.\nAfter a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe occupies Jarrett's body and leads the Rams to victory. During the team's postgame celebration, Corkle finds Joe, and when he realizes that it is him, they share an emotional embrace. As Joe is being interviewed on television, Mr. Jordan tells him that, to live as Tom Jarrett, he will have to lose the memories of his life as Joe Pendleton. As Mr. Jordan disappears, Tom/Joe becomes disoriented. Corkle goes to find Joe later and is crestfallen to realize that Joe has \"left\" Tom. \nTom bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and each appears to recognize the other, but they do not know how. The lights go out in the stadium as they exit the venue, and Tom says something that reminds Betty of Farnsworth/Joe.

Sonny and Ski would race through the carnage to a nearby gorge, where the bridge explodes before they can cross it. Roger suggests they rappel down one side of the gorge and up the other to safety, but Ski proposes jumping a car over the gorge, with Hooper adding that a rocket car can make the 335-foot (102 m) jump.

Donald meets Terry (Denise Flamino), a gorgeous young woman in the bar, grips the tape recorder and microphone and tries Claybrook's technique and gets her number. This bumps up Donald's confidence and he courageously goes to the source on what makes women tick, and the best way to approach them. Unfortunately this confidence ultimately blinds Becker as he swoons Cynthia Miller (Deborah Raffin), an alluring model and girlfriend of his employer (Chandler Cory) of four years. When Donald informs Robby of his dinner date, Harrington tells him, \"That's terrific I'm very proud of you, you're making great progress, now break the date, is it worth your job?\" Becker responds, \"It's worth my life!\" Donald calls from Studio 54, to tell Robby how well it's going, Harrington tries his best to stop Donald from going any further, but to no avail, the two hit the dance floor in a spectacular liveliness which really defines the New York Disco scene.\nDonald has the best night of his life, then has the worst day when Chandler humiliates Becker while firing him.

Sally invites Donald up to the roof for a surprise picnic, Donald having undeniable romantic feelings for Sally, and he believing they're mutual, he finally pushes to know what's the story between her and Cavanaugh. While finishing the typing of \"The End\" of his book, Sally hysterically knocks on the door with wine and flutes to celebrate the triumph of her thesis. The two end up spirited by the wine singing \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\", the very song which introduced the two. Donald makes a move on Claybrook, and the two become an item.\nWith multiple manuscript rejections and red wine to soften the fall, Claybrook cheers up Becker by scratching off Cavanaugh's name from the mail box. Donald receives a letter to meet with Dana Greenberg, editor (Polly Bergen) and throws oil on the fire by assuming Dana Greenberg is a man, believing only a man would be interested in his book. Ms. Greenberg hated the book and only sent the letter to personally insult and reject Donald. Sally cheers up Donald by singing \"The Sons of Nebraska\" (an old collegiate football fight song), then introduces Donald to a printer by the name of Nathan Perlmutter (Abe Vigoda) who begins sentences with \"Based on my experience\" and instructs Becker on taking ads out in magazines to bring his book exposure, then getting the orders for the books first, then printing them. Perlmutter instructs the two not to go to the post office for a week. Yet every day the two meet at the post office only to witness lint in the box. On the day the rent is due on the p.o. box, Donald asks Sally if he could go alone. Donald receives a note to report to the postal carrier, and is reprimanded on having his mail pile up. As excited as Donald is to announce the news to Sally's door, that jubilation is halted as Frank Cavanaugh opens the door, making things difficult and complicated between the two as Donald cannot fully celebrate his success with Sally. Becker's star keeps climbing as press and beautiful women clamor for him, even the venomous Dana Greenberg sees Donald's book and stardom skyrocket, and decides to gain a reprieve with him. Soon enough Harrington and Becker's apartment become too crowded with overstock of his book, Donald seeks a more suitable abode to complement his successful jet-set lifestyle and his best friend Robby. With all of his success, he still sulks and wishes things with Claybrook worked out. While back at the old apartment Donald stands in the center of a maze of boxes packing his book in envelopes, Sally comes to tell him that she's leaving to Chicago for good with Frank Cavanaugh. She gets a cold and unfeeling \"goodbye\" from Donald and the two get into an argument that has Sally storming off, toppling the maze of boxes.\nDonald visits with Dana Greenberg to discuss the paperback right to his book, once again she insults his book while insisting he be a spokesman on \"swinging singles\" \"the definitive expert on picking up girls\". Donald insists his book is not silly and he couldn't be spokesman for anything, \"I didn't write this book for swinging singles, they don't need one. I wrote this book about loneliness and how to find somebody\". During the meeting Donald realizes that he's done being petty with the Cavanaugh/ Claybrook situation and wants to profess his undying love for Sally, by telling Greenberg, \"You know I suddenly have a yen for frozen yogurt\" (the celebratory meal Sally and Donald shared when their success came together). Donald races through security at the airport but it's too late, as he sees Claybrook's airplane pulling away from the terminal. Sad and dismayed Donald accepts the truth and heads back to his new apartment to find Sally and her luggage in the outside patio. The two innocently converse about things. Sally says, \"A lot of the old stuff went away today.\" Donald asks, \"For good?\" Sally responds, \"For very good.\"", "tmdb_plot": "A shy guy gets fired for dating his boss\u2019 girlfriend.

The opening shot introduces the audience to the themes the film will later elaborate. Michael Goddard's The Cinema of Ra\u00fal Ruiz: Impossible Cartographies poses that this film demonstrates the exploration of cinema's power of \u201csimulacral repetition,\u201d the ability of cinema to simulate images that extend beyond the power of repetition where repeated images build upon themselves. Or, as David Heinemann puts it, film \"demonstrates how visual signs draw on, and generate other signs. Hypothesis, with its inclusion of multiple forms of reproduction, exhibits this cinematic power.\nThe remaining scenes center around an art collector participating in a mockumentary style of interviews from a disembodied interviewer who the audience never sees. Through a large 19th-century baroque-style house and its grounds, the camera follows the collector as he guides the interviewer. The collector has six of seven canvasses by a fictional 19th-century painter called Fred\u00e9ric Tonnerre (a reference to Klossowski's short story about a painter of the same name). No one knows what was in the fourth painting of the sequence because it was stolen. His quest is to recreate the missing painting through a series of connections between the other six in order to ultimately discover the meaning of the series in its entirety. To achieve this, he hires models, acquires props and rigs lighting in order to bring each of the six surviving scenes to life as a tableaux vivants. The collector takes advantage of the tableaux vivants as a medium to experience aspects of the paintings that could only be materialized in three dimensions. He can then walk around each tableau, adjust lighting, move actors to different positions, and construct narratives intertextually between the tableaux. All this he does in speculation to search for the artist's intended meaning behind the set of Tonnerre's paintings. The tableaux vivants depict singular narratives that lie within each painting. Some narratives include the mythological characters of Diana and Actaeon, Knights of the Templar playing chess, a scandal among Parisian nobility, and an occult ceremony involving a sacrifice similar to that of St Sebastian.\nIn each case the collector discerns strong sexual currents flowing between the characters, both heterosexual and homosexual. He also recites the incredibly complicated plot of the novel in which the paintings were primarily conceived. As the collector explains the multitude of threads connecting each painting, the disembodied narrator questions the collector's pedantic conclusions. The collector stubbornly presses on with his investigation despite the narrator's critique. Throughout the film the collector makes many claims regarding the connections between each tableau. More significantly, he thinks traces of an esoteric cult of the Baphomet are hidden in secret codes within the pictures. Yet, without the missing painting any overall answer eludes him, and the collector is left asking more questions than when he'd begun. He travels back through the gallery toward the exit, slowly walking past the tableaux vivants which are now entangled and sprawled throughout the gallery. The actors playing the characters in the tableaux are having trouble keeping still. Some blink and some begin to lose their balance.

When he asks Emma and Noah if he can join in on their game of Child Power, they tell him that he is too little to play. When he enters the kitchen, he asks his mother if he can help with dinner, but once again he is told that he is too small. Finally, Jacob visits his father in the living room, where he is reading a newspaper. Jacob expresses his disappointment that he is too small to help and play, and Jacob's father suggests that he travel to the store down the street and buy some chocolate ice cream.\nJacob leaves for the corner store and passes a policeman on his way inside. Inside he sees adults looming over him. He sees a man holding a fish, a woman holding a bird, and a man holding a lollipop. Jacob approaches the store owner, Mr. Cooper, and asks for \"two quarts of chocolate ice cream please, two quarts of chocolate ice cream please.\" Mr. Cooper is taken aback by Jacob's odd behaviour and begins to tease the boy. The policeman enters the store and joins in on the fun. Mr. Cooper demands that Jacob be charged with insulting an adult. The policeman agrees and pulls out his pad of paper, pretending to write the charge down. Jacob panics and runs from the store. The policeman runs after him and tries to explain that he and Mr. Cooper were only joking, but Jacob is already too far away. Jacob runs to a park and hides under a pile of fallen leaves, where he eventually falls asleep.\nWhen Jacob wakes up, he is in a jail cell. The policeman from the store comes into the cell and introduces Jacob's lawyer, Mr. Loser. When Jacob walks into the court, he is surrounded by screaming adults. The judge sits in front of him and is angry and rude to the boy. He says that offenses such as Jacob's cannot be taken lightly, as they may lead to bigger crimes in the future. Jacob pleads innocent, and the judge tells him that his plea is very inconsiderate because it is a busy court. The jury finds Jacob guilty and sentences him to \"\u2026two months, two days, two hours, two minutes in the darkest dungeons of prison.\"  Suddenly, a voice from the back of the room yells, \"I appeal this verdict\". Exciting music begins to play and the adults in the room scream, hide, and faint. Child Power enters the room, portrayed by Jacob's siblings, Emma and Noah. They are introduced as \"The Intrepid Shapiro\" and \"The Fearless O\u2019Toole\".  The judge is afraid of the two children, and nervously tells them that Jacob's sentence has already been passed. Child Power agrees but remind the judge that cruelty to children is against the law. They warn the judge that if they hear of any cruelty in the prison, then he will be hearing from them. Jacob leaves the court room only to find his siblings waiting for him in his cell. They give him a jewel shaped tracking device, and ask for his help. He promises to contact them if he senses any child cruelty in the prison, and Child Power leaves him in the cell.\nMaster Fish and Mistress Fowl take Jacob from his cell and lead him to the prison. They have similar faces to the people that Jacob saw when he was in the store. As they walk towards the prison they tell Jacob scary stories and point out the smog and crocodiles that block the way to the prison's island. When Jacob gets to the prison, he is introduced the fearsome warden, The Hooded Fang. The warden reads Jacob's sentence and sends him to the deepest and darkest cell in the prison. The Hooded Fang tells Jacob that he hates children. He says that when he was a wrestler, he was feared by everyone. During one match, a child pointed at him and laughed, telling the audience that the wrestler was not scary \u2013 only funny. After this incident, the Hooded Fang was unable to fight, because everyone around him would laugh him out of the stadium. Jacob apologizes to the Hooded Fang after hearing his story, telling him that he seems like a nice man. The warden is furious, as he wants everyone to think of him as mean and scary, and sends Jacob to his cell. As Jacob passes by the other cells, he notices that the children's skin is gray in colour. They beg Master Fish and Mistress Fowl for food, but are given only stale bread and moldy apples. When Jacob reaches his cell, he finds some candy and a note that says, \"You have a friend\".Jacob is woken up the next morning by a man in a large fur coat. He introduces himself as Mister Fox, the head guard, and takes Jacob to the shower room to give him his new uniform. When they enter the shower room, Jacob realizes that it is a freezer. After his cold shower, Mister Fox inspects behind Jacob's ears to make sure that he is clean and finds the jewel that Child Power gave him. Mister Fox takes the tracking device from him, thinking that it is a precious jewel. Jacob is then taken to a party in the dining hall. He sees all of the gray children and sits down with them. He asks them why they are gray and they tell him that it is because the smog hides the sun. The Hooded Fang enters the room and all of the children start screaming. Jacob's new friends tell him that he must pretend to be afraid as well, or else the warden will be angry. The Hooded Fang presents Mister Fox with a \"Rotten Child Award\" and says that he must go to the city and complete some undercover work. He wants Mister Fox to visit toy stores and sabotage all of the toys. Jacob is worried because Mister Fox has the tracking device, and if he leaves the prison, then Child Power will not be able to find the children. Jacob feels that by losing the tracking device, he has failed everyone.\nChild Power is alerted that the tracking device has traveled to a toy shop in the city. They decide to go and investigate and find Mister Fox sabotaging the toys. They ask him where he found the jewel, and Mister Fox lies and tells the children that he found it in a fish. Child Power is devastated, because they think that Jacob drowned while trying to escape and was then eaten by a fish. The film then cuts back to the prison, where Jacob is working in the smog making workshop. He tells his friends that he has been receiving many notes with candy attached, telling him to tremble when the Hooded Fang is around.\nThe Hooded Fang talks to his mother about Jacob. He tells her that no matter what he does he cannot get the small boy to cower or scream in fear. He travels to Jacob's cell and asks him questions in an attempt to break his spirit. He tries to get Jacob to say numbers other than two, but Jacob finds ways around it. Jacob tells the Hooded Fang that \"he too can be a two-two\", making the retired wrestler more and more frustrated until he eventually threatens to feed Jacob to the sharks.  When Jacob is in the dining hall with his friends, he tells them about a plan for escape. He has written a note for Child Power and thinks that the Hooded Fang will deliver the letter for him.\nThe Hooded Fang brings Jacob his last meal before he is to be fed to the sharks. He tried to get Jacob to scream, but Jacob says that he knows the warden's secret. Jacob tells him that he knows the Hooded Fang is not evil. He thinks that The Hooded Fang is the one who has been leaving Jacob notes and candy, because they always appear after the warden leaves Jacob's cell. Jacob says that he will hug and kiss him unless they make a deal. After several hugs, the Hooded Fang agrees to deliver the letter for Jacob. Child Power receives the letter and sets out to find Mister Fox. They battle Mister Fox in the toy store, but eventually The Intrepid Shapiro and The Fearless O\u2019Toole get the better of him. They tell him that they will spare him if he promises to take them to the prison. When they reach the water surrounding the island, Child Power poisons the crocodiles. Mister Fox teases Child Power, poking fun at Jacob's size and telling them that he could never actually help. Jacob's siblings stand up for him, telling Mister Fox that Jacob isn\u2019t too small to help. The children in the prison rebel against the guard by destroying the smog machine and blinding the adults with the sun. The only adult that doesn\u2019t cower is the Hooded Fang, because as Jacob predicted, he is just a big kid. The Hooded Fang tries to scare the children, but they only laugh.\nWhen Child Power reaches the prison, Jacob tells them what happened. Child Power points out to Jacob that he is no longer repeating what he says. Jacob realizes that people are finally listening to what he says the first time.

Amyl Nitrate instructs a group of young women about history \u2014 in so doing, valorising the violent criminal activity of Myra Hindley \u2014 before reminiscing about her time as a ballet dancer. Bod, a sex-hating anarchist, has just strangled and killed Queen Elizabeth II, stealing her crown in an arbitrary street robbery.\nFrom there the group move on to a caf\u00e9, where Crabs picks up a young musician called simply Kid, Mad tears up some postcards, and Bod attacks a waitress with a bottle of ketchup. Bod contacts impresario Borgia Ginz. On meeting Ginz, however, she is surprised to find Amyl performing a pastiche of \"Rule Britannia\". Sphinx and Angel establish a relationship with Viv, a young former artist, whom they take to meet Max, an ex-soldier. In exchange for sexual favours, Crabs takes Kid to see Ginz, who auditions Kid's band and signs them up under the name \"Scum\". Sphinx and Angel try to talk Kid out of this, but he just laughs at their lecturing. Ginz is branching out into property management and has purchased \"abandoned\" properties such as Westminster Cathedral and Buckingham Palace, which are transformed into musical venues.\nMeanwhile, Mad, Bod and Crabs asphyxiate Happy Days, one of Crabs' one-night stands, with red plastic sheeting. They proceed to break into the flat of androgynous rock star Lounge Lizard, whom Bod throttles to death. A fight breaks out between Kid and a policeman, at a disco session in Westminster Cathedral. After the gang all watch Kid's TV debut together, Viv and the three males pay a visit to Max's bingo hall, where violent police activity causes the death of Sphinx, Angel and the Kid. Revenge attacks on the two police officers responsible follow. One of them is castrated to death by Mad and Amyl; the other, who has just started an affair with Crabs, is blown up on his doorstep with a petrol bomb by Bod.\nFinally, Ginz takes the four women off to Dorset - \"the only safe place to live these days\" - an unreconstructed right wing aristocratic enclave, where he signs a recording contract with the gang.

After a brief firefight, the aliens disintegrate the man, then return to their spacecraft and fly away, leaving behind the laser cannon and a metallic pendant the man was wearing. Elsewhere, teenager Billy Duncan (Kim Milford) wakes up in his bed, seemingly disturbed. He goes outside to find his mother (Janet Dey) has been invited to a trip to Acapulco and, despite her son's protests, she leaves her son behind. A dejected Billy goes to visit his girlfriend Kathy (Cheryl Smith), but her grandfather Colonel Farley (Keenan Wynn), a disheveled military veteran, spouts wild conspiracy theories and paranoid rants at Billy until he goes away. It becomes clear Billy despises the town he lives in and everybody around him, and for good reason; he is soon harassed both by a teenage bully named Chuck Boran (Mike Bobenko) and his nerdy friend Froggy (Eddie Deezen), and by two police deputies (Dennis Burkley and Barry Cutler), who give him a speeding ticket.\nBilly wanders into the desert alone and discovers the laser cannon and pendant. He starts playing with the cannon, making \"pow, pow, pow\" noises and pretending to shoot things. However, while wearing the pendant and using the cannon simultaneously, the weapon actually fires, and Billy starts firing randomly at things in the desert. Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse (in an unsubtitled alien language) with their leader, who orders them to return to Earth and recover the cannon: it is implied that the aliens left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had. Meanwhile, Billy and Kathy attend a pool party with other teens, where Chuck makes an unwanted advance on Kathy, resulting in Billy fighting with Chuck and Froggy. That night, from a hidden vantage point, Billy fires at Chuck's car with the laser cannon, resulting in a huge explosion that Chuck and Froggy barely escape. A government official named Tony Craig (Gianni Russo) arrives to investigate both the explosion and the desert where Billy found the cannon. Tony informs the local sheriff (Ron Masak) that the town must be sealed off due to his investigation.\nMeanwhile, Billy feels sick due to an unusual growth on his chest. At Kathy's urging, he visits Doctor Mellon (Roddy McDowall), who surgically removes a metallic disc from Billy's chest. He calls the police laboratory technician Mike London (Rick Walters) to arrange for the disc to be investigated. However, later that night, a green-skinned and seemingly crazed Billy opens fire on Mellon's car, killing him in an explosion. The next day, Tony investigates the wreckage and recovers unusual material, which he brings to Mike London. After some experiments, Mike concludes it is an alien material and cannot be destroyed. Later that night, Billy, once again appearing deranged and grotesque, attacks and kills the two police deputies who harassed him earlier.

The group consisted of Rick Danko on bass, violin, and vocals, Levon Helm on drums, mandolin, and vocals, Garth Hudson on keyboards, saxophone and accordion, songwriter Richard Manuel on keyboards, drums, percussion and vocals, and guitarist-songwriter Robbie Robertson on vocals.\n\nVarious other artists perform with The Band: Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Dr. John, Neil Diamond, and Eric Clapton. Genres covered include blues, rock and roll, New Orleans R&B, Tin Pan Alley pop, folk, and rock. Further genres are explored in segments filmed later on a sound stage with Emmylou Harris (country) and the Staple Singers (soul and gospel).\nThe film begins with The Band performing the last song of the evening, their cover version of the Marvin Gaye hit \"Don't Do It\", as an encore. The film then flashes back to the beginning of the concert, and follows it more or less chronologically. The Band is backed by a large horn section and performs many of its hit songs, including \"Up on Cripple Creek\", \"Stage Fright\", and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\".\nThe live songs are interspersed with studio segments and interviews conducted by director Martin Scorsese in which the Band's members reminisce about the group's history. Robertson talks about Hudson joining the band on the condition that the other members pay him $10 a week each for music lessons. The classically trained Hudson could then tell his parents that he was a music teacher instead of merely a rock-and-roll musician. Robertson also describes the surreal experience of playing in a burnt-out nightclub owned by Jack Ruby.\nManuel recalls that some of the early names for The Band included \"The Honkies\", and \"The Crackers\". Because they were simply referred to as \"the band\" by Dylan and their friends and neighbors in Woodstock, New York, they figured that was just what they would call themselves.\nDanko is seen giving Scorsese a tour of The Band's Shangri-La studio, and he plays a recording of \"Sip the Wine\", a track from his then-forthcoming 1977 solo album Rick Danko.\nA recurring theme brought up in the interviews with Robertson is that the concert marks an end of an era for The Band, that after 16 years on the road, the time had come for a change. \"That's what The Last Waltz is - 16 years on the road.

To save time that day, Celia boards a school bus with her fellow classmates. The bus stalls on a set of train tracks, and the driver desperately tries to move it, but a freight train arrives before he can do little more than honk the horn. The bus is split apart by the train, killing numerous students and also leaving many injured. While Amy shows up at the hospital looking for people she knows, Celia is critically wounded and needs to be flown by helicopter to a more urban hospital to save her injured leg. This is a risky move, as she could bleed to death on the way, but her parents insist on it. This is still not enough to save her leg, and Celia is comatose with severe brain damage and a newly-amputated leg.\nWhen Celia wakes up, she is unaware that her leg is missing at first.

They come from totally different backgrounds and can hardly speak the other's language. When Balu and Sapna admit their love, there is chaos in their homes as they face an unexpected test of their love.\nThe movie begins with an old, ruined building near the beautiful beach of Vizag. The dilapidated walls of the building are covered with many names, but two names stand apart from the rest---Balu and Sapna.\nBalu is a happy, carefree young man who belongs to a Tamil family. He resigns his job after his boss scolds him and he returns to his home in Vizag. His orthodox Tamilian father is always at loggerheads with the Telugu-speaking neighbour family. The family has a beautiful daughter named Sapna, a college student.\nWhile being followed on her way home by a creepy bookstore clerk (who'd earlier shown her a book of nude photos), Sapna sees Balu jogging and starts a one-way conversation with him. Seeing this, the bookstore clerk retreats. Sapna thanks Balu for pretending to be her friend, but he reveals that he doesn't understand Telugu. Vasu wants to make friends with her. He tries to meet her later pretending his motorcycle has broken down but he crashes and ends up in the hospital. Impressed, Sapna sends him a gift: a ceremonial mask with her name on it and asking his name.\nDespite the nasty conflicts between their families, Vasu and Sapna fall deeply in love with each other. They get to know each other, experiencing the joy and innocence of first love. One day, however, Sapna fairly misunderstands Balu when he forcefully kisses her and is offended and breaks up with him. Despite Balu's efforts to make her understand his love, Sapna ignores him and remains angry. A week later, Sapna finds Vasu awake all night looking at her window hoping that she would forgive him. Heartbroken at seeing him like that, Sapna forgives him and signals him by turning her room light off and on repeatedly.\nThey meet the next day and Sapna expresses her love for Balu by kissing his hand. The lovers unite and visit the beaches, forts, waterfalls and scenic places of Goa. While returning home late at night, Balu's motorcycle runs out of petrol. They pose as a newly married couple and ask for a lift in a car. To their shock, Sapna's father is in the car and he takes her home immediately. Balu and Sapna keep meeting each other and fall in love even more.\nOne day when Sapna returns from college after meeting Balu, she finds the lewd bookstore clerk at her home. The man has secretly clicked pictures of her and Balu together and shown them to her parents. Burning with rage, Sapna's mother forbids her from seeing Balu and accompanies her everywhere. Heartbroken, Balu makes a plan and stealthily meets Sapna during her college lunch break. They go to a hotel for lunch and Balu pauses the elevator halfway to spend some time with Sapna. He sings a love song for her using his broken Telugu. This leads to an amused crowd at the hotel lift listening in. They are reprimanded by the guard as they exit.\nBalu and Sapna's families find out. In anger, they lock up Sapna at home and Balu's father scolds him. Despite the opposition, Balu boldly goes and meets Sapna in her home in the presence of her parents and expresses his love for her. Sapna's mother screams and claims that Balu is ruining their family honor.\nFinally, both the families meet and Balu and Sapna affirm their love for each other. Their families agree to allow them to marry on one condition \u2013 that they separate from each other for one year without any contact or communication. Afterwards, if they still want to be together, they can get married. Balu and Sapna reluctantly agree to the contract.\nBalu goes to Hyderabad for a job, while Sapna stays behind in Vizag. During their year of separation, Vasu writes a letter every day to Sapna, in which he expresses his pain and love, but doesn't send it to her because of the contract. He learns to speak Telugu fluently from a young widow named Sandhya. To drown his pain of separation, he also learns classical dance from Sandhya.\nOn the other hand, Sapna visits all the places where she and Balu used to go which brings back old memories. She also visits a rocky hill by the beach, where their names 'Balu' and 'Sapna' are painted on the highest rock. In order to make Sapna forget Balu, her mother destroys the cassette tape that he had given her. The mother also burns her only photo of Vasu which Sapna crumbles into her tea and drinks in defiance. In response, Sapna writes Balu's name on every inch of her bedroom wall, making her family even more angry.\nSapna goes on a college trip to Mangalore, where her mother sends her cousin Chakram to spy on her. Chakram wants to marry Sapna, but she doesn't like him. Coincidentally, Balu also comes to Mangalore due to a job assignment. He spots Sapna and follows her to her hotel room, but bumps into Chakram, who lies that he and Sapna are married. A shocked Balu meets Sapna's college friends and asks about her, but they mistakenly say Chakram and Sapna are soon to be married.\nBalu is heartbroken and proposes to Sandhya, thinking that Sapna was unfaithful to him. Sandhya is surprised but accepts and fixes their wedding date. Later she finds in his room all the letters he wrote to Sapna, and discovers the truth. Sandhya goes to Vizag and meets Sapna and learns that she is not married and is still waiting for Balu. Seeing their true love, Sandhya sacrifices her love and decides to unite Balu and Sapna.\nShe tells the truth to Balu and cancels their wedding, urging him to go to his beloved Sapna as their one-year contract was completed. Sandhya's older brother hears that the wedding is cancelled and thinks that Balu abandoned his sister. In a drunken, angry state, he phones his criminal friend in Vizag and asks him to 'completely get rid' of Balu.\nWhen Balu arrives back in Vizag, and is about to meet Sapna in their favorite beach spot, Sandhya's older brother's criminal friend and a gang brutally beat up Balu. Meanwhile, Sapna is heading to the beach to meet Vasu. The lascivious bookstore clerk tries to attack her, Sapna tries to escape him and falls from the second floor. The bookstore clerk seeing her almost dead from the fall, still violently rapes hers! Sapna and Balu meet after the clerk and the goons flee. However, Balu is badly injured.

The others are sympathetic but unwilling to get involved in a war. Garuda hands his Liabe seed to Emeralida and leaves. Beba-2 follows Garuda, trying to change his mind.\nUrocco exhorts Emeralida to find the others chosen by the Liabe seeds, while Meia pushes Jack, Aaron and Shiro to help the Jilutians. Jack announces that the other recipients are 'wolf-hunters', and offers to lead the Jilutians to them.\nJack leads Urocco and Emeralida to the home of a wizened old crone; she examines the Liabe seed, and names wolf-hunters she had seen with the same seeds. Emeralida stays in the home while the others go on a dangerous night search, with a guide, Hikiroku. Hikiroku's robe conceals his face and hands, and he does not speak but only growls. As they leave, the old woman hands Jack and Urocco cups of drugged liquor.\nWalking in the darkness through the mountains, Urocco becomes dizzy and disoriented. Jack hits him on the back of the head with a rock. Urocco, dazed and drugged, tries to raise his sword.  Their \"guide\" shoots him, pushes his body into a gulley, and hands Jack a satchel with money, his payment for the betrayal. Jack finds the Liabe seed in his pocket; he hurls it away.\nHikiroku returns to the old woman's home; she tells Emeralida that Urocco won't be coming back, and that she bribed Jack to give Emeralida to her for her son, Hikiroku, who is revealed as a lizard-man mutant. He disarms the horrified Emeralida, but is killed when a brigade of Gavanas troops enter the crone's home and capture her and the princess.  Urocco, alive but injured, wakes and learns of her capture.\nBack at Shiro and Aaron's house, Meia, still thinking they're helping the Jillucians, dances happily around the room with Jack.  Aaron and Shiro are silent and glum. Urocco bursts in, sword drawn and tries to attack the men, but falls down unconscious.\nJack confesses his guilt to Meia, but tells her that Shiro and Aaron were in on the plan. All three point that Meia's father grew rich profiteering from war. Aaron and Shiro hurl their Liabe seeds through a window. Meia angrily flies away in her spacecraft. She hears a rattling behind the cockpit and finds a Liabe seed glowing orange.\nAaron, Jack and Shiro are plagued by nightmares about the Gavanas killing Emeralida and the Jillucians. After they awake, Shiro and Jack's Liabe seeds come back through the window into their hands, glowing orange, but Aaron's seed has not returned. Meia returns, showing her seed, and three of them rejoice; Aaron is upset that his seed has not come back.\nAt the Gavanas' base headquarters on Jillucia, Rockseia points out to Emeralida that the planet could have remained fertile and rich, but brought desolation when they refused to surrender.  Rockseia's men wheel in the old crone on a gurney. Using a mind probe, Rockseia extracts images of Earth landscapes and wildlife until the old crone dies.  Using huge engines built into the planet, Jilutia is propelled towards Earth, the Gavanas' next conquest.\nThe Gavanas overcome Earth's defenses and give Earth three days to surrender and become a tributary planet.  The Chairman of Earth Council, Earnest Noguchi, appeals to his old friend, General Garuda, to go to Rockseia as Earth's Special Envoy, hoping to buy time for a renewed defense. At first, Garuda refuses, but then finds a Leyabe seed in his drink, this time glowing orange. Realizing that his destiny is to defend the Earth, he agrees to go to Rockseia.\nJack and the other roughriders decide to go to Jilutia as well.  Aaron continues to sulk over his missing Liabe seed. The Gavanas space carrier appears over their house and Jack is captured by the ship's tractor beam. Aaron rescues him, and finally finds his Liabe seed on the hull of his ship.\nUrocco, Jack, Shiro and Aaron fly to Jilutia, with Shiro and Aaron's ships mounted on Meia's ship. As they near their destination, Meia's Liabe seed explodes, causing the ship to crash on a planet in the Bernard system.  There they find what appears to be a Gavanas warrior without a metallic skin, and wearing a Liabe seed around his neck.  The warrior introduces himself as Prince Hans, the rightful heir of the Gavanas' throne. He explains that Rockseia killed his royal parents and took the throne for himself.\nGaruda arrives at Jilutia as the Earth envoy and greets the Emperor and Empress.  Rockseia brings in Jack, who begs Garuda to save him. Garuda challenges a nearby warrior to a duel, but the warrior fires before he has taken the required 10 steps, and Rockseia kills him in disgrace.  Rockseia dismisses Garuda's request for time to prepare Earth's population for surrender, and destroys Earth's moon as a warning. The Empress expresses fear that the Garuda, a Liabe-seed chosen one, might be dangerous.\nGaruda, Jack and Beba-2 leave Jilutia but then turn around. All three parachute to the surface.  In the meantime Meia's ship approaches Jilutia, making the 'chicken run' approach used earlier by Aaron and Shiro. The pair separate their ships near the surface, and the three ships pull up and fly through a rocky canyon, simulating a meteor impact.  The ships then re-connect and land.  Urrocco finds the Jilutian survivors hiding in the hull of a space galleon.  Urrocco and the others meet Jack, Garuda and Beba-2. They realize there are now six Liabe warriors, but wonder who the other two might be.\nKido lays a wreath formed with eight additional Liabe seeds on a pool of water. The wreath then shows a vision of tunnels leading to the reactor furnaces. If these are destroyed, the Gavanas' base will be destroyed too, along with Jelutia.  Shiro and Aaron boast that they can fly their spacecraft through the narrow tunnels. The Jilutians are resigned to the destruction of their world, but Urocco is horrified and runs away.\nLater, the group is captured and led back into the Gavanas' base where Rockseia, addressing them using a giant hologram, tells the prisoners that he has learned of their plans from Urocco.\nUrocco angrily decries their hopeless resistance, and their plan to destroy the planet. He lifts his rifle to fire on them, but just then the Liabe seeds begin to glow, and Urrocco turns on the Gavanas. The Jilutians rise up against their captors, while Prince Hans draws his sword against the Gavanas warriors. Urrocco is mortally wounded but lives long enough to find a glowing Liabe seed in his wreath, learning as he dies that he is the eighth Liabe warrior.\nPrince Hans tells the Jilutians to evacuate in their ship. Meia, Shiro and Aaron get back to their ships and leave, avoiding the attacking Gavanas fighters.  The Jilutians storm the space galleon and seize it. Meanwhile, Prince Hans fights his way into the throne room. He fights Rockseia, and stabs him in the forehead; the energy from Hans' sword surges into Rockseia, throwing him through the window of his tower.  As he dies the entrance to the reactor tunnel opens.\nShiro and Aaron fly their ships into the tunnel, outmaneuvering Gavanas fighters. They destroy the reactor, and then fly to the surface as the planet begins to break up.\nGaruda, Beba-2, Jack, Prince Hans, Emeralida, and all the Jilutians climb aboard the last Galleon. Kido decides to die with Jilutia. The space galleon then launches and is joined in flight by Meia, Shiro, and Aaron. The trio launch a suicide attack against the Gavanas space carrier, causing it to explode and crash in flames. The planet detonates.\nShiro, Aaron and Meia awake on board the space galleon, surprised to be alive. Emeralida explains that it's a miracle of the Liabe seeds.

For example, the role of the Th\u00e9nardiers is reduced to a scene in which Valjean ransoms Cosette from them.\nThe film begins with Jean Valjean's theft and then lingers in the Toulon prison where his mistreatment is detailed under the gaze of Javert, who witnesses Valjean's amazing feat of strength in rescuing a man crushed under a boulder. Valjean escapes when saving another convict who had fallen while repairing some battlements. Struggling to survive, he encounters a kindly Bishop, who feeds and shelters him. He steals silver plates from the Bishop. When Valjean is arrested and brought back to the Bishop, the Bishop pretends the silver pieces were a gift, dismisses the police, and gives Valjean two silver candlesticks in addition to what he had originally stolen. Valjean is overcome. The Bishop tells him he has purchased his soul for God and that his life will now be different.\nValjean becomes a prosperous businessman using techniques for the manufacture of black beads that he learned in Toulon and becomes mayor of his town under the name Madeleine. Javert arrives to serve as chief of the local police. He thinks he recognizes Madeleine and notes his use of the Toulon manufacturing method. Madeleine rescues the beggar Fantine, who recounts her history in a few sentences, when Javert is about to punish her, and Javert witnesses Madeleine rescue a man trapped beneath a cart, another astonishing feat of strength. Javert denounces Madeleine to his superiors, but before they can confirm Madeleine is actually Valjean, another man is arrested and charged in Arras with being the escaped convict Valjean. Javert confesses his actions to Madeleine and asks to be dismissed from his position. Madeleine refuses his request and goes to Arras where he wins the release of the falsely accused man by identifying himself as Valjean.\nValjean returns to his town and tries to help the dying Fantine while he awaits arrest. He learns how the Th\u00e9nardiers are caring for her daughter Cosette. Javert insists on arresting him, Fantine dies, and Valjean escapes. He ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and gives her a doll. Living in Paris with Cosette, Valjean escapes from Javert, who is directing police searches of the district where he is living, by climbing a wall, landing in the garden of a Paris convent. The gardener is the man he rescued from being crushed under a cart, who agrees to pretend he and Valjean are brothers and recommends him to the nuns as a gardener. Cosette attends the convent school. When she completes her education and has become a young woman, Valjean decides they should leave the convent's cloistered premises so she can experience the world.\nValjean and Cosette are strolling in a public garden and pause to listen to radicals denounce the government. Cosette and Marius, one of the radical group though not a speaker, see one another and their eyes lock. Marius pays the urchin Gavroche to tail them and report their address to him. Marius soon romances Cosette through the entrance gate to their home. Valjean sees this and abruptly announces to Cosette that they must leave for England. When Marius learns this, he visits his grandfather, Gillenormand, who detests his radical activities, to ask for money. Instead his grandfather suggests he make the woman he wants to marry his mistress and Marius, repulsed by the suggestion, leaves.\nThe radicals have created a barricade and are exchanging gunfire with the military. Gavroche identifies a man on the radical side of the barricade as the undercover police infiltrator, Javert. Enjolras arrests Javert and promises to shoot him if the barricade falls to the government's forces. Marius sends Gavroche with a message for Cosette, which Valjean reads. Valjean goes to the barricade and tries to talk Marius into abandoning the radicals. Gavroche is shot by the soldiers and dies. Valjean asks Enjolras for the privilege of killing Javert, which Enjolras grants him. Valjean instead releases him, repeating the words of the Bishop that his soul was once purchased for God. When Marius is wounded, Valjean escapes carrying his limp body with him through the sewers. Javert pursues him there and confronts him about their earlier encounter.

Lupin, however, is more interested in the Stone, and searches Mamo's island for it. After retrieving the Stone, he and Fujiko are chased by Mamo's henchmen until they stumble across Mamo's lair. Mamo deems Lupin unworthy of eternal life and attempts to visualize his perverted nature to Fujiko, but she refuses to abandon him. The USAF attacks the base, having tracked Jigen and Goemon to the island. Jigen rescues Lupin and Fujiko and seemingly kills Mamo in a shootout, while Goemon duels with Flinch. The altercation damages Goemon's sword, the Zantetsuken, causing him to leave for training purposes.\nZenigata tries to catch the gang, who escape the island with the unconscious Lupin, but fails. He is found by the ICPO chief, who had traveled to Colombia to tell him that he's off the Lupin case and that the situation is bigger than either of them can handle. Zenigata responds by resigning and chasing Lupin as a private citizen.\nLupin, Fujiko and Jigen travel to Colombia, where Lupin theorizes that Mamo may have gained eternal life by continuously cloning himself. They are thrust into a vision by Mamo, who reveals that his cloning technique has kept him alive for ten thousand years, and that he is responsible for virtually every major event in human history. Mamo also explains that he cloned Lupin. He then appears in person to reclaim Fujiko, and a distraught Lupin challenges him to perform a miracle. Mamo responds by setting off an earthquake through the destruction of a nuclear power station.\nInside a temple, Mamo explains to Fujiko that his cloning technique has never been perfected, and that he has degenerated from his original form as a result. He decides that he and Fujiko must repopulate the Earth, and convinces her to push a button to launch nuclear missiles to achieve this end. Lupin arrives, and reveals that he rigged the missiles to explode before they could launch. Frustrated, Mamo takes Fujiko with him to a launching pad and fends Lupin off with lasers. Lupin uses the tip of Goemon's sword (given to him by Jigen earlier) to deflect the lasers, incinerating Mamo.\nA rocketship emerges, containing a giant brain that reveals itself to be the original Mamo. Lupin realizes that Mamo had controlled his clones resembling his body just as the rocket launches into space. Lupin and Fujiko escape the rocket's trajectory, but not before Lupin plants an explosive on it. The glass shatters, and Mamo's brain drifts toward the sun. Lupin finds Fujiko in the rubble, where he is captured by Zenigata. Fujiko offers to help Lupin, but the Americans launch a missile attack on Mamo's base.

Manuela wakes the other women in the brothel in search of red thread to mend the dress. She is sent instead to Ludovinia, an elderly, deaf woman who gives her the thread. Ludovinia reveals that Don Alejo (Fernando Soler), the town's mayor, had once taken a liking to Pancho, hiring him to drag his daughter, Moniquita, in wagon and encouraging him to go to school. As Manuela leaves, she bumps into Don Alejo, who offers to buy the brothel.\nMeanwhile, Pancho is at the gas station of his brother in law, Octavio. Octavio is closing the gas station because the town has been reduced to practically nothing. They complain about Don Alejo, who has been systematically buying all of the property.

He attacks her for seeing him in this state, but relents. He tells her that Don Alejo is a bad man, but she refuses to believe it, insisting that Don Alejo had promised to restore the electricity to the brothel. Pancho tells her that Don Alejo was the one who had cut it in the first place.\nAfter Manuela and Japonesita fight over the possible sale of the brothel, Japonesita declares that she wants to decorate it the way her mother, La Japonesa, would have.

She places a bet with Don Alejo that she can get Manuela aroused and \"make her a man.\" Don Alejo, disbelieving, offers her ownership of the brothel if he can watch them have sex. La Japonesa enters Manuela's room and begins kissing her, and it cuts to Don Alejo leaving the doorway, apparently satisfied with the bargain. After, Manuela declares her love for La Japonesa but is rebuffed.  \"If you fall in love with me you'll become a man, brutish and rude.\"\nIn present day, Octavio lends the money for Pancho to pay off Don Alejo, and they celebrate his freedom by going to the brothel. Manuela hides, watching through the window as Pancho and Japonesita dance. Pancho insists that Japonesita \"owes him\" for the tears she saw. He starts to hurt her, roughing her up and demanding Manuela. Japonesita insists that Manuela has gone as Pancho gets increasingly violent. Manuela eventually bursts in in her red flamenco gown, dancing seductively for Pancho. They eventually begin kissing until Octavio sees them and breaks them up.

Brigitte excuses herself to visit the restroom and doesn't return for a long time; then the vineyard worker comes aboard, encounters Brigitte, and a bit later joins \u00c9lizabeth in her compartment. In time, the man's neck suddenly grows an ulcer which starts oozing blood. Panicked, \u00c9lizabeth escapes him, stumbling upon Brigitte's corpse on the way.\nLeaving the train, \u00c9lizabeth flees to a nearby village for help. A man named Pierre and his daughter Antoinette take her in, but react coldly to her tale. \u00c9lizabeth panics when she sees Pierre's arms disfigured by infection, but Antoinette holds her back, telling her to get upstairs to take a rest. When \u00c9lizabeth enters the bedroom and discovers a woman whose throat has been cut, Antoinette explains that the dead woman is her mother, and that her father killed her because he's become insane. \u00c9lizabeth and Antoinette try to leave the house, but Pierre, now featuring the same facial ulcers as the vineyard worker, catches them and rips open his daughter's blouse, revealing similar ulcers on her body.

Sgt. Pepper and his Lonely Hearts Club Band brought happiness through its music, even causing troops in World Wars I and II to stop fighting. In August 1958, Sgt. Pepper died of a heart attack in the middle of a performance, at the unveiling of a new weather vane in his likeness. Sgt. Pepper left the band's magical musical instruments to the town; so long as they remain in Heartland, its people will live happily ever after. Heartland City Hall, which doubles as a Sgt. Pepper museum, contains the instruments. Sgt. Pepper left his musical legacy to his handsome and good-hearted grandson, Billy Shears (Peter Frampton). Billy forms a new Lonely Hearts Club Band with his three best friends: brothers Mark, Dave, and Bob Henderson (The Bee Gees). Billy's charming but avaricious half-brother, Dougie (Paul Nicholas), serves as the band's manager.\nHeartland loves the new band (\"With a Little Help from My Friends\"), and soon Big Deal Records president B.D. Hoffler (Donald Pleasence) invites them to Hollywood with the promise of a record deal, to which the band accepts. Billy bids farewell to his sweet hometown girlfriend, Strawberry Fields (Sandy Farina) (\"Here Comes the Sun\"). Once in Hollywood, B.D. introduces the band to their new labelmates, sexy singers Lucy (Dianne Steinberg) and the Diamonds (Stargard), and they negotiate the contract over a sex-and-drug-induced dinner. Hitting it off with Lucy, Billy all but forgets about Strawberry. The band quickly succeeds with hit records and sold-out shows.\nMeanwhile, villainous Mr. Mustard (Frankie Howerd) and his henchman the Brute drive to Heartland in their computer- and robot(Polythene Pam)-equipped van. Mustard receives orders from the mysterious FVB to steal the magical instruments from City Hall and distribute them among FVB and its affiliates. Without the instruments, Heartland\u2014now under Mustard's control\u2014quickly degenerates into a hotbed of vice and urban decay. Strawberry takes an early morning bus to Hollywood (\"She's Leaving Home\") to tell the band. Mustard, who has a crush on Strawberry, follows. In Hollywood, the band and Strawberry steal Mustard's van and use its computer to locate the stolen instruments. They recover the cornet from the deranged, money-driven anti-aging specialist Dr. Maxwell Edison (Steve Martin), and the tuba from mind-controlling cult leader Father Sun (Alice Cooper). They find the drum still in Mustard's van. However, the computer malfunctions before they can locate the final missing instrument\u2013the saxophone\u2013which remains in the hands of FVB.\nAs Heartland continues to deteriorate, Dougie and the band convince B.D. to organize a benefit concert to save the town (\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!)\". Dougie and Lucy, who have bonded over their shared love of money, plot to run off with the show's proceeds (\"You Never Give Me Your Money\"). They hide bags of money in Mustard's van while Billy, Strawberry, and the Hendersons are watching Earth, Wind & Fire perform at the benefit (\"Got to Get You into My Life\"). Mustard and the Brute suddenly arrive and take back the van, which also contains the recovered instruments. They also kidnap Strawberry, with whom Mustard has fallen in love from afar (\"When I'm Sixty-Four\"). Mustard drives off with Dougie, Lucy, Strawberry, and the money hidden on board. Billy and the Hendersons see the van leave and pursue it in the town's hot air balloon.\nMustard drives to FVB's headquarters, where the Future Villain Band plans to take over the world. This Orwellian hard-rock group (Aerosmith) contrasts the wholesomeness of Sgt. Pepper's band. FVB is described as \"the evil force that would poison young minds, pollute the environment, and subvert the democratic process\"; they perform in militaristic uniforms on a high platform stage made to look like stacks of money, accompanied by uniformed youth twirling flags. To turn Strawberry into a \"mindless groupie\", FVB chains her up onstage while the band plays \"Come Together\" and lead singer (Steven Tyler) fondles her. Dougie and Lucy are also tied up and forced to watch. Billy and the Hendersons arrive and engage FVB in hand-to-hand combat. The singer is thrown off the stage to his death, but unfortunately, so is Strawberry.\nThe town of Heartland, now cleaned up and the instruments returned, holds an elaborate funeral for Strawberry (\"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\"). The depressed Billy attempts to get Strawberry off his mind (\"The Long and Winding Road\"); when he cannot, the Hendersons worry for him (\"A Day in the Life\"). Billy attempts suicide by jumping from a rooftop. Before he can hit the ground, in a form of Deus ex machina, the Sgt. Pepper weather vane atop City Hall comes to life (Billy Preston). Wielding magical lightning bolts, Pepper catches Billy (\"Get Back\"). Pepper dances through the town square, transforming Mustard and the Brute into a bishop and a monk. Mustard's van is transformed into a Volkswagen Beetle. Dougie and Lucy are transformed into a priest and a nun. Strawberry is restored to life, and happily embraces Billy. Sgt.

Meanwhile, Blood is rejoined by Snake, who offers him a deal. Snake reveals that he took in Thomas, Jr. after he left and intends to ransom the boy back to the Barrett family.

Murphy (Harry Gorsuch) to follow them, anyway.

Tired of distractions and complications, Lonigan decides to purchase a homer of his own so he and the gang can track them down more easily. When they catch up with them again, along with Herschel and Murphy in a police car, they manage to disrupt a concert in the park by knocking over the stage, musicians, and sound equipment and Herschel's car ends up getting disabled when a fallen ladder damages the car's radiator. The chase is once again cut short when Abigail demands Lonigan to pull over so she can change out of her nun costume, causing another delay. Thinking that they lost them, Al and Elmo pull the car into a service station to get gas and Al decides to use the phone booth to call the police to explain the situation. When Elmo uses his jacket to wipe the sweat off his face, he notices bags of heroin in the backseat. He runs over and yanks Al out of the phone booth, causing him to rip the receiver out. Though annoyed with Elmo, he manages to persuade him that they should peddle the heroin for money or end up getting killed by the cops. As they begin to leave, Lonigan spots them and Al immediately peels out of the station, with Elmo forcing to take a shortcut by running into the woods, with Abigail and Rosco on his tail. After destroying the roadside snack stand next to the station, Lonigan and Tony go after Al, thinking it will be an easier way to get rid of Abigail since the two are fed up with her.\nAs the chase begins, it gets interrupted by two country hicks, in a delivery truck, blocking their path, Lonigan throws a grenade into the back of their truck, causing them to stop and run for their lives. Al eventually loses them in a construction site by temporarily disabling Lonigan's car with a bulldozer. Meanwhile, in the woods, Elmo hides up in a tree to avoid being spotted by Abigail\nand Rosco. Elmo eventually falls to the ground, but manages to run away as the two shoot at him. Abagail accidentally kills Rosco with her machine gun  after a brief scuffle. Elmo eventually steals a motorcycle from a young, naked couple making out in the woods and Abagail steals the other one, but soon after, she ends up losing him when she crashes it during a jump and its runs out of gas. She eventually meets up with Lonigan and Tony at the construction site, not knowing that she killed Rosco. She manages to free the car from the bulldozer and they try to find the Corvette.\nAs night falls, Al decides to make a stop at a neighborhood bar called Ronnie B's to relax and have a beer. Not long after, a weary and filthy-looking Elmo arrives and decides to clean up in the bathroom, but Abagail, Lonigan, and Tony arrive thanks to the homer. Abagail instructs Tony to stand guard outside while she and Lonigan go in to find them. Once in there, a bar patron (John Carl Buechler) tries to hit on Abagail, but she ends up setting his crotch on fire with a cigarette lighter. The pandemonium eventually erupts in an all-out bar fight and amidst the chaos, Al and Elmo sneak out of the bathroom window and are immediately caught by Tony, but Elmo knocks him out after he punches Al to the ground and they escape in the Corvette. At his boiling point, Lonigan lays it on the line with Tony saying he and Tony will not take the heat for this caper and decide to abandon Abagail altogether. They try to run her over in the parking lot, but get chased away by her gunfire.

Elmo thinks the only way to elude them is disguising the car in a different color, something Al is not too thrilled with. Meanwhile, Abagail manages to steal an Austin Healey by fatally shooting the driver and putting his body in the backseat. As Abagail sneaks up to Lonigan and Tony, she kills Lonigan by stabbing him in the neck with an ice pick. She attempts to kill Tony, too, but decides to spare his life, providing he will share the million dollars with her. Al, Elmo, and the hitchhiker accidentally pull the Corvette into a car wash, causing the new paint job to wash away, blowing their cover. Abagail and Tony engage in one final chase that ends in a dead end embankment road under a city bridge. Elmo disables Abagail and Tony's car by blowing up its engine with Abagail's Machine gun that Tony left back at Ronnie B's accidentally. Al, Elmo, and the girl retreat and Abagail gets shot by Tony, stating that he does not share a million dollars with nobody. Thinking she died of the wound, Tony collects the heroin bags and starts to leave in the Corvette, but she sits up and fatally shoots Tony multiple times. Despite being shot, she tries to get into the Corvette, herself, but the machine gun Elmo left behind is standing next to the car door and the gun's charge ignites when she tries to shut it, causing it to shoot her in the head. Suddenly, Herschel, Murphy, and a squad of policemen arrive on the scene and discover all of the dead bodies, including Lonigan's in the back seat of their car. Later on, Al and Elmo attempt to locate the suitcase of money the girl managed to sneak away from the crime scene, but they discover it's gone. They find out that a derelict had stole the case and they chase after him under the bridge supporter. Al tries to retrieve it, but falls into the river and never comes back up.\nThe final sequence has Elmo explaining to the girl saying they should have gone to the police, originally and blames himself for being too greedy, but Elmo notices Al's body floating over to the shore.

The other council members dismiss his claims. To save Kal-El, his infant son, Jor-El sends him in a spaceship to Earth, where his dense molecular structure will give him superhuman strength and other powers. Krypton, thereafter, is destroyed.\nThe ship lands near Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El, now about three Earth years old, is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are astonished when he lifts their truck. They decide to raise him as their own, naming him Clark after Martha's maiden name. Jonathan tells the boy that he must have been sent to Earth for \"a reason\".\nAfter Jonathan's death from a heart attack, 18-year-old Clark hears a psychic \"call\" and discovers a glowing green crystal in the remains of his spacecraft. It compels him to travel to the Arctic where he uses the crystal to construct the Fortress of Solitude, which resembles the architecture of Krypton. Inside, a hologram of Jor-El explains Clark's true origins, and after twelve years of educating him on his reason for being sent to Earth and his powers, he leaves the Fortress wearing a blue and red suit with a red cape and the House of El family crest emblazoned on his chest. Becoming a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis, Clark meets and develops a romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane.\nLois is involved in a helicopter accident. Clark publicly uses his powers for the first time to save her, astonishing the crowd gathered below. He then thwarts a jewel thief attempting to scale the Solow Building, captures robbers fleeing police and depositing their getaway cabin cruiser on Wall Street, rescues a girl's cat from a tree, and saves Air Force One after a lightning strike destroys an engine. The \"caped wonder\" is an instant celebrity. Daily Planet boss Perry White wants the newspaper to find out more information about him. Clark visits Lois at her penthouse apartment the next night for an interview and takes her for a flight; Lois subsequently writes an article naming him \"Superman\".\nMeanwhile, criminal genius Lex Luthor learns of a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy nuclear missile test. He buys hundreds of acres of empty desert land and reprograms the two missiles to detonate in the San Andreas Fault, with his assistant Otis accidentally programming the second missile coordinates incorrectly. Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Lex deduces that a recently discovered meteorite is from Krypton and is radioactive to Superman. After he and his accomplices Otis and Eve Teschmacher retrieve a piece of it, Luthor lures Superman to his underground lair and reveals his plan to cause everything west of the San Andreas Fault to sink into the Pacific Ocean, leaving Luthor's desert land as the new West Coast of the United States. Luthor then exposes him to the meteor piece's mineral, Kryptonite, which weakens Superman greatly as Luthor taunts him about the second missile which will detonate in Hackensack, New Jersey.\nTeschmacher is horrified that Luthor does not care that her mother lives in Hackensack. Luthor leaves Superman to die. Knowing he always keeps his word, Teschmacher helps Superman on the condition he will stop the eastbound missile first. After being freed, Superman diverts the eastbound missile into outer space, consequently preventing him from reaching the westbound missile before it explodes in the San Andreas Fault. Massive earthquakes erupt across California, damaging the Golden Gate Bridge and breaching the Hoover Dam. Superman mitigates the effects of the explosion by sealing the fault line.\nWhile Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car falls into a crevice from one of the aftershocks, trapping her as it fills with dirt and debris. She suffocates before Superman can reach her. Angered over failing to save her, Superman defies Jor-El's earlier warning not to manipulate human history, and instead heeds Jonathan's advice that he must be there for \"a reason\".

An Air Force unit, led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman), investigates, and comes across an unauthorized scientist at the secured base, Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), who was tracking a large swarm of killer bees, when they attacked the Air Force bunker. General Slater (Richard Widmark) orders two helicopters to check the area, whereupon the helicopters are destroyed by the swarm of bees. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.\nMeanwhile, in the nearby countryside, the Durant family is attacked by the swarm of the bees. The mother and father die from the bee stings, but Paul, their son, escapes in a Mustang. Although he is stung, Paul manages to make it into town and crashes into the Marysville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Wheelchair-bound Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater confronts angry county engineer Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens), who demands to see the dead body of his son, an airman in the bunker, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation, as the poison will wipe out plant growth for a decade or more.\nRecovering from his earlier bee attack, Paul and his friends search for the hive to firebomb it in revenge for his family, which results only in angering the bees, who make their way to Marysville, where they kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant caf\u00e9 waitress Rita. Reporter Anne McGregor (Lee Grant) watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, and fear of another one, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees attack the train, causing the locomotive derail over a cliff, killing everyone aboard, including a love triangle made up of schoolteacher Maureen Scheuster, retiree Felix Austin, and town mayor and drug store owner Clarence Tuttle.\nRita tries to board the ill-fated train but is saved at the last minute by going into labor and is confined to the hospital. She gives birth to her child while falling in love with the doctor in the process; but Paul suffers a relapse from the effects of being stung earlier and later dies, devastating Helena and sending her into a rage about why the children have to die. The savage swarm heads for Houston, Texas, and Crane decides to drop eco-friendly poison pellets on them, hoping that the swarm senses will harm them and stay away from the city. Unfortunately, the plan fails. Dr. Krim self-injects an experimental bee venom antidote, planning to track the results, but the trial proves fatal and he dies. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews (Jos\u00e9 Ferrer) is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees, ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain). However, the bees invade the plant, causing a nuclear explosion, killing Andrews and Hubbard, destroying the plant, and wiping out a nearby town.\nMeanwhile, in Houston, Crane analyzes tapes from the bee invasion and comes to the conclusion that a test of an alarm system at the ICBM bunker attracted the swarm into the base. The bees attack Houston, resulting in the deaths of Major Baker and Dr. Newman, one of Crane's associates. Slater sacrifices himself to save Crane and Helena from the bees. Helicopters playing the alarm sound from the ICBM bunker over loudspeakers lure the bees out to sea, where they douse the water with oil and set the swarm ablaze.

The movie opens with an unidentified spy master giving instructions to protagonist Yu Rim, a Korean expatriate in the United Kingdom working as a journalist, who is ordered to proceed to Seoul and gather intelligence on the United States Forces Korea. Initially, he only has three contacts in Seoul: Park Mu, the chief press officer for the Republic of Korea Army, Janet O'Neill, the wife of senior American intelligence official Dr. Kelton, and Lee Hong-sik, his handler, through whom Yu also runs into his old lover Kim Soon-hee, who is apparently employed by the United States Counter Intelligence Corps, and is introduced to Colonel Klaus. Yu begins gathering intelligence on a coup plot by rightist South Korean general Sin Jae-sin. Lee helps him pass back this information to North Korea using his unwitting friend Kim Su-gyong as a courier. Lee is suspected by a US counter intelligence agent Martin who found Lee takes care of homeless kids. Soon after, Lee is killed in a shootout with CIC agents, including Kim Soon-hee, leaving Yu unable to pass his crucial intelligence back to his government. Yu calls Lee from a bar, but after realizing the person on the other end of the line is not Lee, hangs up immediately. A waitress in that bar is subsequently arrested and tortured by Colonel Klaus, who learns that a man suspected to be Yu was seen making the phone call.Yu flees to a Hong Kong safe house run by a North Korean singer. He is instructed to return to Seoul and contact an agent code-named White Horse. However, he is suspicious of White Horse and sets a trap for him which reveals that he is working with Colonel Klaus. White Horse is then killed by an unknown person. Yu obtained the information from Janet O'Neill that John Foster Dulles is visiting Europe to get reinforcements. Yu meets Lewis, an army lieutenant, and converts him to Communism to relay this information; Lewis stages his own kidnapping so that he can disappear to the North for training, and later returns to Seoul. Two months later, Yu receives a coded message on Voice of Korea instructing him to contact an agent named Diamond, who turns out to be his old lover Kim Soon-hee, ostensibly working for the Americans, but really a double agent for North Korean intelligence. With Dulles's agenda exposed to the media, the US plans a battle to demonstrate their superiority, but Yu obtains this information from Park Mu. The Americans fail to get more reinforcements from their European allies and are defeated by a well prepared Korean People's Army.Yu continues to gather intelligence on General Sin's coup attempt, this time passing messages back to Pyongyang by way of a radio operator disguised as a disabled veteran who begs outside hotels. Yu hides messages in cigarette filters, which he then throws on the ground near the beggar. However, he is unaware that he is being followed by the CIC, who are filming his activities. Colonel Klaus hears about a North Korean spy disguised as a veteran, and begins reviewing video tapes to check on Yu's activities. Kim saves the day by cutting the scenes out of the tapes to avoid further suspicion falling on Yu, but the disappearance of the scenes triggers Klaus' suspicion towards Kim herself. Klaus stages a test of loyalty for her, in which she is kidnapped and threatened with execution by American agents in Hokkaid\u014d, Japan pretending to be Communists; however, Kim correctly senses this is a trap, and escapes by killing the agents.Park Mu realizes that Yu and Kim are spies. Klaus discovers that Yu was the one who leaked out intelligence. Park is pushed by Klaus, and kills Kim who tries to protect Yu.

Captain Holly describes it as a dangerous totalitarian state, but Hazel feels they must go there. Bigwig infiltrates the warren and is made an Owsla officer by their cruel chief, General Woundwort. Bigwig recruits several potential escapees to his cause, including Blackavar and Hyzenthlay. With Kehaar's help, the escapees find a boat to float down the river. That night, Kehaar leaves for his homeland with the gratitude of the warren.\nEfrafan trackers eventually find Watership Down. Woundwort rejects Hazel's offer of peace and demands that all deserters must be turned over or Watership Down will be wiped out. While the Watership rabbits barricade their warren, Fiver slips into a trance, in which he envisions a dog running loose in the woods. His mumblings inspire Hazel to try and release the farm dog and lead it to the Efrafans. When they arrive at the farm, Hazel unties the dog and releases it while Blackberry, Dandelion and Hyzenthlay use themselves as bait to make the animal follow them. Meanwhile, when the Efrafans break through the warren's defences, Woundwort goes in alone; Blackavar attacks him but is easily killed. Bigwig ambushes Woundwort and they fight to a standstill. When the dog arrives and starts attacking the Efrafans, Woundwort abandons Bigwig and fearlessly attacks the dog. However, no trace of Woundwort is ever found, which leaves his fate a mystery.\nSeveral years later, an elderly Hazel is visited by a strange ghostly rabbit, who invites him to join his own Owsla, assuring him of Watership Down's perpetual safety. Reassured, Hazel accepts and dies peacefully. His spirit follows the visitor through the woodland and trees towards the Sun, which metamorphoses into Frith, and the afterlife, as Frith's parting advice to El-Ahrairah is heard once more.", "tmdb_plot": "When the warren belonging to a community of rabbits is threatened, a brave group led by Fiver, Bigwig, Blackberry and Hazel leave their homeland in a search of a safe new haven.", "tmdb_id": "11837", "wiki_id": "982243"}, {"title": "A Wedding", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Dino Corelli marries Muffin Brenner and attends the reception at the Corelli mansion. Bedridden matriarch Nettie Sloan, mother of Dino's mother Regina Sloan Corelli, is being tended by disreputable Dr. Jules Meecham. While speaking with wedding planner Rita Billingsley, Nettie suddenly dies. Meecham informs Dino's father, Luigi Corelli, but Luigi is unable to tell his wife Regina because she is mentally unstable. Nettie's corpse remains in bed throughout the reception, while various attendees visit her room without realizing she's dead. By the time bossy daughter Toni finds out and plans a dramatic announcement, other family members are mostly unsurprised or not even too upset.\nThe Brenners are a nouveau riche family from Louisville, Kentucky, where Muffin's father, \"Snooks\", made millions in the trucking industry. The Corellis are an old money family from North Shore Chicago. Because of rumors that Luigi has mob connections, virtually every invitee sent regrets. Only one guest (other than family members) attends. Nevertheless, Rita is determined to run the reception by the book, setting up a receiving line for the one guest and asking family members and staff to go down the line so it will not look empty.\nA series of disasters unfolds, including the display of an embarrassing nude portrait of the bride; caterer Ingrid Hellstrom becoming ill, then getting high and causing a disturbance after Meecham gives her a pill; and a tornado when the cake is to be cut, forcing everyone to find shelter in the cellar. Two guests arrive late: the groom and bride's disgruntled exes, Tracy Farrell and Wilson Briggs, who bond over their shared anger.\nUnsavory family drama unfolds. Regina is a drug addict. Her marriage was arranged by Nettie after Luigi met Regina while working as a waiter in Italy. Luigi was forced to change his name and be estranged from his Italian family for 22 years. His Italian-speaking brother unexpectedly shows up, and when Meecham reminds Luigi that Nettie is dead and can no longer impose the marriage conditions, Luigi is thrilled to see his long-lost brother. Regina's sister Clarice has a romance with her African-American butler, Randolph; her other sister, Toni, is married to Mack Goddard, who falls in love at first sight with Tulip Brenner, mother of the bride, and tries to woo her.\nSnooks has a borderline incestuous attachment to his nearly mute daughter Buffy, the maid of honor, who speaks at the reception only once, to tell Dino she is pregnant and he is the father. Not wanting to be upstaged by the bride, Buffy disrobes in front of Muffin's nude portrait. Dino confides to Wilson about Buffy's pregnancy; Wilson tells Tracy, who vindictively spreads the news. Snooks confronts Dino, who admits to sleeping with Buffy but says she also slept with nearly every member of his military-school barracks. Snooks's sister from New Jersey, Marge Spar, starts romancing the Corellis' gardener, while bridesmaid Rosie Bean is unaware her shy friend Shelby Munker is having an affair with Rosie's husband Russell.\nMuffin and Dino prepare to leave for their honeymoon in a new car, the Corellis' wedding gift. Muffin is rattled when Rita makes an unexpected pass at her. She then finds Dino in the shower with his groomsman, Reedley Roots, seemingly engaged in a gay sexual encounter. Actually, Dino has passed out drunk and Reedly is just holding him up straight while trying to sober him up.  The newlyweds' car is seen driving away, and the families assume Dino and Muffin left without saying goodbye. Snooks drives his family back to their hotel. They see Dino's car wrecked and in flames, and rush back to the mansion to share the awful news. The families are grieving when Muffin and Dino appear from upstairs, having never left because of Dino's passing out. When Luigi remembers that the car keys were last seen in Wilson's possession, it becomes clear that Wilson (presumably accompanied by Tracy, since she is nowhere to be found), out for revenge, stole the car and died in the crash. Tulip privately declares the incident was God punishing her for sinful thoughts of having an affair with Mack.\nLuigi pays his respects to Nettie.

It is a quiet town where all the residents know each other and the passage of the \"Bucharest-Sinai\" express train is considered a major event. The express train never stops: it passes through town once in the morning on the way to Sinai, and once during the evening on the way back to Bucharest. The residents of the town regularly congregate at the train station to watch the express pass and to speculate about the faraway lives of the passengers.\nOne evening, the owner of the town's department store Mr. Pascu returns from Bucharest with various specialty orders for the residents. One of the orders is clothing for Mr. Ispas, the head of the train station. Another order is a rare book for Mr. Miroiu, the town's astronomy teacher. Pascu confides to Ispas that Miroiu's book is worth 22,000 lei. When Pascu delivers the order to Miroiu, it turns out that he confused Miroiu's and Ispas' packages. Miroiu rushes to the train station, as Ispas must remain there until the evening \"Bucharest-Sinai\" express passes. They exchange packages, and Miroiu begins leafing through his new book in the station.\nThe \"Bucharest-Sinai\" express arrives and stops at the station, to Ispas' surprise. The conductor calls Ispas on-board to assist him with a stowaway. The stowaway is a young woman in an expensive dress who has no ticket, documents, or money. Ispas and the conductor manage to trick the woman (Mona) off of the train and into the station, and the train departs. Miroiu is heart-struck by Mona. Mona is non-cooperative with Ispas when he attempts to process her as a stowaway. Miroiu offers to house Mona for the night (himself staying at a friend's house) and to return her for processing in the morning, to which Mona reluctantly agrees. Ispas is supportive of the idea, as he wants Mona gone before his wife arrives and misunderstands the situation. Mona and Miroiu leave the station just before Mrs. Ispas arrives. She forces her husband to explain what happened after smelling Mona's perfume in the station office.\nMiroiu shows Mona the town as he escorts her. Mona is unimpressed by the provincial nature of the town and Miroiu's meager home. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ispas runs into Mlle. Cucu (a colleague of Miroiu) at the theater and tells her about the events at the train station. Cucu is upset by the news (it's implied that she is in love with Miroiu). Cucu finds Miroiu's neighbour Mr. Udrea and convinces him to escort her to Miroiu's home, without revealing that it's because she wants to see the mystery woman. When Cucu and Udrea arrive at Miroiu's home, Miroiu has Mona hide in the bathroom. Cucu interrogates Miroiu. Unable to reveal her true feelings when asked why, Cucu instead says that she wants to know where Miroiu acquired 22,000 lei to purchase his new book. Cucu accidentally finds Mona's gloves and runs away in tears. Udrea follows Cucu to escort her home, but not before Miroiu asks him to return afterwards.\nMona overheard everything from the bathroom and asks to see the book. Miroiu accepts because Mona is in town for only one night. The book is a 17th century astronomical treatise, which Miroiu was able to afford by living an intensely frugal lifestyle. Miroiu purchased the book because he believes that he has discovered a new star, and this book contains the only remaining star chart which he has not checked to verify that this is an original discovery. Mona asks to see the star, but Miroiu explains that it's not visible: he discovered it through mathematical reasoning. Mona doubts him, so Miroiu attempts to show her where the star is in the sky from his balcony, but his aggressive explanation frightens her and she retreats back inside the house.\nUdrea returns and Miroiu introduces him. Udrea is the town music teacher and a hobbyist composer. He has written a symphony which he wants to perform, but it requires an English horn which costs 4,500 lei and which the town does not have. At Mona's request, Udrea performs a short version of his symphony using his voice. Miroiu and Udrea attempt to depart to Udrea's house for the night, but Mona requests that Miroiu stay. Mona asks Miroiu to show her his star again. This time, she is awed by his knowledge of astronomy and the beauty of the stars. Miroiu tells Mona that he has not yet chosen a name for his star. They kiss on the balcony and spend the night together.\nThe next morning, Mona tells Miroiu that she intends to stay with him. Miroiu departs to purchase a new dress for her. While he is away, a man named Grig arrives at his house and the details of Mona's life are filled in. Mona has been Grig's lover for three years, though she is more like his pet. The previous night, they were playing roulette at the casino in Sinai. Grig blamed Mona for his poor luck and sent her away to their hotel room. Instead, Mona attempted to run away. Grig tracked her down to Miroiu's house and has arrived to take her home.\nMiroiu returns from the store with a dress. Grig falsely introduces himself as Mona's brother, then sends Miroiu away to exchange the dress, telling him that Mona doesn't like it but is too polite to say so. After Miroiu leaves, Grig insults Miroiu, the town, and the townspeople. Mlle. Cucu arrives, and Grig concentrates his ire on her, using her as a symbol of what Mona will become if she stays. As Cucu attempts to leave, Mona asks her for advice. Hurt, Cucu advises her to leave with Grig and then departs. Mona tells Grig that she doesn't have the strength to resist him. In a last, desperate attempt, Mona asks Grig to abandon her; Grig refuses.\nMr. Udrea arrives. Udrea and Grig go outside to discuss Udrea's symphony after Mona agrees to go with Grig if he pays for Udrea's English horn. When Miroiu returns, Mona tells him that she needs to leave. Miroiu presses her about when she'll return, and but her answers are evasive. Mona suggests that he name his star after her, because just like his star, he won't see her, but he'll know that she exists.\nMona departs with Grig. Udrea returns to tell Miroiu that Grig gave him 5,000 lei to buy an English horn. When Miroiu tells Udrea what happened, Udrea replies that he doesn't think Mona will be back. Miroiu says that he suspected something like this would happen, explaining by quoting an astronomical law which he had previously quoted to Mona: \"No star may deviate from its path\".", "tmdb_plot": "\"Stars never leave their orbits\".

Speaking candidly and often cynically about their craft, interviewees are seen routinely interrupting one another as their artistic claims are contested or derided by orchestral peers, each self-importantly regarding his own instrument as the most vital to group performance, the most solitary in nature or spiritual in relation \u2014 these varied opinions reflecting each listener's intensely personal experience with music, one of the recurring themes of the film.\nThe conductor arrives (speaking Italian but with an affected German accent), proving theatrically critical of the ensuing performance quality and equally quarrelsome with trade union representatives on site, wearing down the orchestra members as he commands them to play with exceedingly particular nuances bordering on absurd abstraction, leading several musicians to strip away clothing under the strain of this taxing effort.\nProtesting the conductor's authoritarian abuses, the union reps intervene, spitefully announcing that all musicians will be taking a 20-minute double break. While one camera follows the players to a local tavern to further catalog their ideological musings, in a backstage interview the defeated conductor expresses his frustrations regarding the impossible contradictions of his leadership role, opining on the subjective power of music just as a power outage in the building prompts his return to the auditorium hall.\nThere he discovers the darkened auditorium space has been thoroughly defaced with spray-painted revolutionary slogans and rubbish being flung about by the musicians who chant a discordant chorus of protest against their oppressive taskmaster and then against music itself (\"The music in power, not the power of music!\"). This increasingly anarchistic bacchanal culminates in a violent crescendo of gunshots and in-fighting, until finally an impossibly large wrecking ball \u2014 its presence going unexplained \u2014 smashes with God-like wrath through a wall of the building (at the altar of this former church), causing the death of the harpist beneath an avalanche of rubble.\nAs the silenced fellow musicians reflect on this tragedy in a cloud of settling dust, the conductor steps in to eulogize with a motivational speech declaring that music requires them to play through the pain of life, to find strength, identity and guidance in the fated notes of its composition. Amid the ruins, the newly inspired musicians accommodatingly take to their instruments to deliver a tour de force redemptive performance. At its conclusion, however, the conductor's former words of fleeting praise once again sour to perfectionist dissatisfaction, resuming his comically agitated critique at the dais as the picture fades to black, to the swelling accompaniment of a classical opus.
