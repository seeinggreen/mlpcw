{"6724790": {"title": "3 Ring Circus", "plot": "Pete Nelson, a smooth operator who has just been discharged from the Army, joins forces with his old buddy, the loud Jerome X. Hotchkiss, and together they join a circus. The Clyde Brent Circus, to be exact. Jerry has taken a job as apprentice lion tamer. He is set on being a circus clown, but his plans are squandered when they meet the circus manager Sam Morley and owner Jill Brent, who is also ringmaster. The circus has financial problems, so the only way that both Pete and Jerry can be hired if they help out wherever needed.\nJerry dutifully reports to the designated lion tamer, Colonel Schlitz, but is terrified when Schlitz forces him into the lions' cage with only a whip and chair for protection. Schlitz keeps calling at him to behave coolly and to show no fear, but all Jerry can do is to nervously try to befriend the beasts. Schlitz pulls him out of the cage.\nLater in the day Jerry and Pete are washing the elephants when Jill stops by to chat. Pete starts flirting, which she finds both attractive and annoying. Jerry sneaks into Puffo the Wonder Clown's tent and tries on his hats. Morley catches him red-handed and scolds him.\nOne night while working in a custard stand. Pete and Jerry are overwhelmed by the crowd and lose control of the machine. Morley sends Jerry to help Puffo dress for his performance. The arrogant clown rejects Jerry's help. Jerry's next assignment is to hand Nero, the tightrope walker, a unicycle. The audience roars with laughter at Jerry's fumbling attempts to climb a rope ladder while holding the bike. When Jerry accidentally ends up riding the unicycle on the tightrope, the crowd hushes. Pete and the clowns rush in with a net and catch him when he falls.\nSaadia, the Queen of the Trapeze, is up to perform. She goes into the ring and Pete is indeed breath-taken by her great beauty. Jill, however, dislikes the egotistical, greedy Saadia. Morley insists the circus would go bankrupt without her. To Jill's disgust, Pete agrees to become Saadia's personal assistant.\nMorley then talks Jerry into becoming a human cannonball. Pete, wearing nothing on his upper body, shows off for Saadia, giving her a private demonstration of his skills on the parallel bars. Saadia is attracted to Pete, and they end up kissing. They are interrupted by the slightly jealous Jill, who informs Saadia that, for financial reasons, there will be an extra show on Saturday.\nSaadia is well aware that the survival of the circus depends on her, but she refuses to do the extra show. Pete, watching her perform to a capacity crowd, gets an idea of how to save the circus.\nMorley finally allows Jerry to go into the ring in place of a sick clown. Jerry is ecstatic, but one performer unhappy with Jerry's big break is Puffo. He resents the cheap laughs that Jerry gets from the audience and starts bullying him in the ring. The audience is upset and starts to boo Puffo, wanting him to go off. After the show, Jerry tells Puffo that he is not angry with him.\nPete flirts with a very receptive Jill, but when he asks about the circus's profits, she is furious and slaps him. Soon after, in Saadia's tent, Pete explains to Jill his plan to increase his profits with gambling. A skeptical Jill, who inherited the circus from her father, allows Pete to set up some gaming tables on the midway.\nThe circus continues its tour. On Jill's birthday, Pete and Jerry throw her a big party. Puffo gets quite drunk and interrupts the festivities to declare he is quitting. He will consider staying on if Jerry and Pete are fired. Pete gets angry and punches Puffo in frustration. Jill later fires Puffo from the circus and replaces his act with Jerry.\nJerry starts performing under the name Jerricho. He is an instant hit with the audience, even bigger than Saadia, who gets jealous. So jealous she too threatens to quit unless the circus gets rid of Jerry. Tired of her ego, Pete tells her \"drive carefully\" and sends her on her way. Jill is quite relieved that the alluring Saadia is out of her way.\nHowever, her relief is short-lived. She witnesses a fight between Pete's shell-game operator and a customer then demands that Pete stop the gambling operation. Pete refuses and announces he is leaving the circus, too. Sure that the loyal Jerry will go with him, Jill insists on leaving instead, preferring to leave the circus to Pete than lose it entirely.\nJerry verbally attacks Pete for canceling a benefit performance for disadvantaged children. Pete then tells Jerry he \"ain't nice\" anymore, and quits. Jerry and the other clowns decide to perform the show anyway, and Jill meets them at the outdoor arena.\nJerry's words ring in Pete's head while Jerry performs and delights the children with his clowning. Jerry goes to great lengths to get a sad-faced handicapped girl to laugh. A car arrives in the ring out of it comes Pete, dressed in a clown suit. Jerry and Jill are delighted to see Pete join in the fun.", "tmdb_id": 62396}, "40343634": {"title": "08/15 (film)", "plot": "The movie opens in the barracks of an artillery battalion somewhere in Germany; the year is 1939. The enlisted men of the battery are harassed by their Hauptwachtmeister Schulz and a platoon leader, Feldwebel Platzek, at every opportunity. Gunner Vierbein, who has a passion for music and wanted to become a piano player, is a preferred target. This intensifies when Vierbein is ordered by Schulz to beat the carpets in Schulz's duty apartment and Schulz's wife, Lore, begins flirting with him. Even the squad leader Unteroffizier Lindenberg, who is known to be fair and correct, starts under pressure from Schulz to pick on Vierbein. He breaks down under the constant hard drill and harassment and steals ammunition on a rifle range to commit suicide. One of his comrades, Gefreiter Asch, who helps him to get along with the military life, prevents this and decides that the harassment by the NCOs mustn't continue.\nAsch, who is viewed as one of the best soldiers in the battery and highly valued by Schulz and the other NCOs, and his friend Obergefreiter Kowalski start to compromise their superiors one by one. Lindenberg is provoked to report Asch for insubordination, but Kowalksi, who is named as witness, doesn't support the claim. The mess-sergeant, Rumpler, reports Asch for mutiny when he controls the food and gets a result of unwarranted decrease. Rumpler withdraws his report when Schulz is threatening to inspect the kitchen food himself. Platzek tries to cover up the loss of the ammunition that Asch has kept, and though Asch helps him to falsify the documents he makes clear to Platzek that he is in his hands now. Later Asch and Kowalksi use the ammunition to fire several shots into Schulz's office while Schulz and Platzek are in it.\nSchulz, who recommended Asch for promotion to Unteroffizier himself, is unnerved because of the shooting and the constant reports about Asch, and relays the reports up to the battery commander, Hauptmann Derna. Derna refers Asch to the doctor, who declares him officially insane. Asch uses this diagnose and threatens the doctor with a gun. Now the situation is so severe that Derna takes the reports to the battalion commander, Major Luschke. Luschke, severely unnerved by Derna and his inability to handle it himself, takes measures. He talks the officers and NCOs who reported Asch into withdrawing them by threat of demotion or transfer.\nAfter that Asch is promoted to Unteroffizier, as the Major has already granted it before the reports began, and Kowalski is promoted to Stabsgefreiter. Only minutes later the battalion is falling in on the courtyard to hear Hitler's speech on the radio announcing the outbreak of war against Poland (and thus the start of World War II).", "tmdb_id": 19430}, "5516824": {"title": "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)", "plot": "In 1868, rumors spread of a sea monster attacking ships in the Pacific Ocean. Professor Aronnax and his assistant, Conseil, are asked to investigate and soon board a U.S. Navy frigate. They are joined by cocky master-harpooner Ned Land.\nAfter months of patrolling, the monster is spotted. The frigate's guncrew open fire with their Dahlgren cannon, but the monster turns and rams the warship. Ned, Conseil, and Aronnax are thrown overboard while the disabled frigate drifts away, unable to respond to their cries for help. While clinging to wreckage, Aronnax and Conseil come upon a metal vessel and realize the monster is a man-made \"submerging boat\" that now appears deserted. Going below decks, Aronnax finds a large viewport and witnesses an underwater funeral, while Ned Land arrives on an overturned longboat from their ship. Spotted by the divers, Ned, Aronnax, and Conseil attempt to leave in the righted longboat, but the divers stop them. The vessel's captain introduces himself as Nemo, master of the Nautilus. He returns Ned and Conseil to the deck while offering Aronnax, whose name he recognizes, the chance to stay. After Aronnax proves willing to die with his companions, Nemo allows Ned and Conseil to remain aboard.\nNemo takes Nautilus to the penal colony island of Rura Penthe, where the prisoners are loading a munitions ship. Nemo, once a prisoner there as were many of his crew, later rams the steamer, destroying it and its crew. Nemo tells Aronnax that he has just saved thousands from death in war, and that \"this hated nation\" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force him to reveal his discoveries. In Nemo's cabin, Ned and Conseil discover the map coordinates of Nemo's secret island base, Vulcania, where Nautilus is now heading. Ned throws messages overboard in bottles in the hope of being rescued.\nOff the coast of New Guinea, Nautilus becomes stranded on a reef. Nemo allows Ned to go ashore with Conseil, ostensibly to collect specimens, while admonishing them to stay on the beach. Ned instead goes exploring for avenues of escape, and finds human skulls posted on stakes. Ned quickly rejoins Conseil, and they row away pursued by cannibals. Aboard Nautilus, the cannibals are repelled by an electrical charge sent through its hull, and Nemo confines Ned for disobeying orders.\nA warship fires upon Nautilus, which descends into the depths, attracting a giant squid. After an electric charge fails to repel the creature, Nemo and his men surface during a violent storm to dislodge it. Nemo is caught by one of its long tentacles, and Ned, having escaped from captivity, fatally harpoons the squid, saving Nemo. Having had a change of heart, Nemo wants to make amends with the world.\nAs Nautilus nears Vulcania, Nemo finds the island surrounded by warships, with marines having disembarked. Nemo submerges Nautilus, enters his base from underwater, and surfaces within its large lagoon. He rushes ashore to activate a prearranged time bomb in order to destroy any evidence of his discoveries, but is shot and mortally wounded. Navigating the submarine to a safe distance from Vulcania, Nemo announces that he will be \"taking the Nautilus down for the last time\". His crew declare that they will accompany their captain in death.\nAronnax, Conseil, and Ned are confined to their cabins, while Nautilus's crew retreat to their own at Nemo's instructions. Ned escapes and surfaces the submarine, striking a reef in the process, causing Nautilus to flood. Nemo dies while viewing his beloved undersea domain through the hull's viewport.\nAronnax tries retrieving his journal, but the urgency of their escape obliges Ned to knock him unconscious and carry him out. Aboard Nautilus's skiff, the three companions witness Vulcania explode. A large, billowing mushroom cloud rises above the island's destruction. Ned apologizes to Aronnax for striking him, but Aronnax concedes that the loss of his journal might have been for the best. As Nautilus sinks, Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo: \"There is hope for the future.

On landing, he finds his quarters are not ready for him, and he is invited to stay by the local missionary Owen Jones (Paul Rogers) and his sister Martha (Glynis Johns). He soon finds their company, while friendly, a little overbearing, and returns to stay at his own residence despite it not being finished. That evening, he is visited by the only other European resident of the island, Edward Wilson (Robert Newton), known as the \"Honourable Ted\",  who introduces himself and drinks a large amount of Gray's whisky. Despite having been warned that Ted was a scoundrel, Gray soon warms to him, finding him well-spoken and obviously educated.\nA year after arriving on the island Gray is disappointed to see Ted arrested and brought up before him in court for encouraging a girl at the mission to steal some money which he then spent on drink before becoming involved in a drunken brawl. Gray breaks with precedent and sentences Ted to three months' hard labour on a neighbouring island. While there, the local headman (Michael Hordern) suffers from appendicitis. Because her brother, who functions as a local doctor as well as running the mission, is unwell, Martha travels out and successfully performs the operation. She nurses the headman back to health, while also tending to a local elephant that had injured its trunk after being attacked by a crocodile. On the way back she travels in a boat with Ted, who has now finished his sentence. She strongly disapproves of Ted, and the fact that he and the crew are drunk on arrack. She is horrified when the propeller fails and they are forced to spend the night on a small desert island. She is convinced that Ted will try and molest her, but to her surprise he leaves her alone all night\u2014except to put some blankets on her to stop her becoming cold.\nWhen they return to the capital she is now slightly infatuated with Ted, in whom she can see signs of goodness. He remains repulsed by her, and ignores her gentle attempts to get to know him better. His drunken behaviour on the island carries on as before, and he is involved in another brawl. This time Gray is forced to sentence him to deportation to Australia. His departure is delayed by a sudden outbreak of cholera which sweeps the islands. With all available hands needed in the capital, only Martha can be spared to go to the northern islands to treat the outbreak there. Because the governor and her brother are worried that the spread of disease might encourage a native rebellion they are hesitant to let her go. Ultimately they agree, provided she takes Ted with her. At first he refuses to help her when he is approached, but later guiltily agrees to join her.\nOnce they reach the northern islands they discover the inhabitants have become hostile to them, blaming the spread of the disease on the Europeans. However, Martha persuades them to let her help, reminding them of how she saved the life of the headman months before. They assent to her presence, and she and Ted throw themselves into the task of fighting the disease. Slowly they grow extremely fond of each other, and finally embrace.

Other charges include leaving the base and entertaining a woman officer in his room, this being forbidden by the battalion commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson).\nAppearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly because of back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster had failed to pay him for expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) was pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, and has become ill and suicidal as a result of financial worries.\nCarrington claims he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred \u00a3100 of it to his wife's account to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base to compete in a major horse race in which he bet the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash taken. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money, but was denied access to the safe.\nAs for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden from his fall and that Graham was visiting him to discuss the embezzlement. She was fully dressed and sitting on a chair when Colonel Henniker stormed in, reminding them that it was against regulations for male and female officers to be together in private quarters. Henniker admits waiting for some time between seeing Graham go to Carrington's room and then entering himself.\nHenniker is in fact Carrington's enemy, resenting his war record, achievements and popularity at the base. There is an element of sympathy for Carrington's actions and it is pointed out that the Major could be cleared if established that Henniker had forewarned knowledge of his intentions. He thus perjures himself at the court-martial by denying being told by Carrington of his decision to take the money from the safe. Much of Carrington's debts were due anyway to Henniker's constant delays in pursuing the Paymaster to give Carrington the money owed him.\nDue to her ill-health, Carrington did not intend to call his wife Valerie as a witness, but decided that he will have to when the case goes against him following Henniker's \"evidence\". She resents the idea of washing their dirty linen in public but finally agrees to turn up.\nThings go wrong when Valerie becomes suspicious of Carrington's relationship with Captain Graham. Under pressure, Graham admits to Valerie that she had a one-night stand with Carrington when they became stranded in a pub in the middle of a storm. But Carrington then insisted that a full affair would not be fair to anyone, and ended it. He and Graham are now just friends.\nIn her evidence, Valerie also perjures herself, denying her husband ever mentioned telling Colonel Henniker he planned to take the money. Carrington produces a letter she wrote to him in which she does mention his argument with Henniker. Carrington intends to only read the parts relevant to his defence, since the letter also contains embarrassing matters about the couple and Valerie's health. But when the judge insists that he and the other officials read it before it is submitted into evidence, Carrington tears it up.\nThe officers who are to determine his fate have seen through the lies told in court and sympathise with Carrington. But the law finds Carrington guilty on all counts, which means dismissal from the service.\nAll the regular soldiers at the base are near-unanimous that it is an unfair decision. One of them, Owen (Victor Maddern), was a sergeant demoted when loyalty to Carrington resulted in his failure to co-operate with the investigation. His defiance in and out of court on the subject results in his demotion again to a mere private.\nHaving made his grievances public, Carrington has decided not to appeal the verdict. His marriage is also over, but, with an attitude typical of him, he puts it down to the fact that Valerie is still in love with her late husband, killed during the war, and the father of her sons.\nHowever, in the course of gossiping about the case, a telephonist at the exchange admits overhearing Carrington's phone call with his wife and what was really said. The telephonist's testimony (if heard at the court-martial) would have provided evidence that Valerie was lying under oath.\nWithout Carrington knowing, as he exits the court-martial building, the other soldiers rally around and display their support for him.

McCord is in cahoots with Indians, in particular Natchakoa of the Blackfoot tribe, whose braves stampede the Jones family's cattle, knock Sierra cold, wound her cowhand Nat and kill Pop, after which McCord steals a document from Pop's dead body that grants rights to the land.\nSierra is nursed back to health by Colorados, a young Blackfoot who attends school among the whites, to the displeasure of the tribal chief, his father. McCord offers a $2,000 bounty to Farrell if he kills Sierra and Nat, but instead Farrell comes to her rescue.\nFarrell reveals that he is actually an agent for the U.S. Cavalry, investigating the rustling and killing. With the help of Sierra, he blows up a McCord wagon filled with ammunition being sold to the Indians, doing away with McCord once and for all and bringing peace to the territory at last.", "tmdb_id": 121703}, "58080321": {"title": "Certificate of Maturity", "plot": "Gifted, but spoiled by the adoration of teachers and classmates, the young hero of the picture provoked a conflict in school.

While Porky goes on about how 'quaint and picturesque' the local hotel is, deciding it is 'the perfect' spot to spend the night, Sylvester is trembling with fear and literally attaching himself to Porky.\nAfter a few scares for Sylvester on the way into the hotel, Porky signs the two of them in the register. Sylvester has become aware of the actual danger, which is from murderous mice that have taken up residence in the hotel. Unlike the cartoon \"Scaredy Cat\", however, the mice are generally unseen, except for a few scenes including tiny, malevolent-looking pairs of eyes peering out of dark corners.\nThe mice begin their attempts to kill Porky and terrify Sylvester. As always, Porky does not see the danger until Sylvester has chased the mice away, leaving him holding the bag \u2014 or, as in the first major incident, the noose (intended for Porky's neck) which the mice drop from a mounted moose head above the front desk. When Porky demands to know why Sylvester has shoved him over the desk, the cat impersonates the moose head and demonstrates how the rope was dropped. Porky derides Sylvester and starts up the stairs to a room. The moose head, a shotgun protruding from its mouth, follows to the foot of the staircase, whereupon the mice inside position the gun for a shot at Porky. Sylvester pounces and, preventing the assassination, is left standing with the gun and the now-empty moose head. Porky scolds Sylvester for fighting against stuffed animals.\nThe two end up in Room 13. Porky settles in bed for a good night's sleep while Sylvester is curled up on a chair on high-alert. Suddenly, a noose drops from the ceiling and finds its way around Porky's neck. As the mice tighten it, Sylvester finds a razor in a suitcase, leaps on the bed and cuts the rope. Porky wants to know what the cat is doing with a noose (still around Porky's neck) and a razor. Just then, on a ledge above the bed, Sylvester spots a mouse (which closely resembles Wile E. Coyote) with a kitchen knife. The mouse, a string tied around its waist, swoops down, presumably to slice off Porky's head. Sylvester shoves Porky down, out of danger, though the knife slices off a line of fur down Sylvester's back. Still unaware of what just happened, Porky gets fed up and boots Sylvester out of the hotel room.\nIn the hallway, a ghost appears to be coming up the stairs toward a terrified Sylvester. A shaft of moonlight reveals that the \"ghost\" is merely more mice standing on each other's shoulders under a white sheet. Sylvester breaks through the closed door to get back into the room. He takes refuge beneath Porky's nightcap. When Porky commands him to explain this particular behavior, Sylvester points to a white sheet floating ghost-like by the window. Porky pulls the sheet to reveal it is merely covering a chair and being gently blown by the wind. Porky looks for an explanation - \"Well?\" - and Sylvester acts out his experience. Porky does not believe him, but suggests that Sylvester may as well share the bed if he is that frightened. Shortly, a shotgun pokes through a hole in the wall. Sylvester dashes over and sticks his finger in the barrel, stifling the shot, although the bullet does pass through the tip of Porky's nightcap. Sylvester wrestles the weapon away from the mice. \"Tell me, Sylvester, is there any insanity in your family?\" Porky asks, upon waking to see the cat returning fire through the hole in the wall. For the rest of the night, Sylvester performs guard-duty at the foot of the bed.\nDawn finally breaks, ending the bleary-eyed cat's vigil. Porky wakes up refreshed, happy and eager to spend 'a week or 10 days' further in the town 'to get really rested up'.

Steve recognizes that the other two escapees, Penny and Hastings, will likely arrive soon. Ellen convinces him to phone his parole officer; while they are talking, Sims shows up. He grills Steve, demonstrating that he believes \"once a crook, always a crook\" and takes him to jail for three days, threatening him with fresh charges if he does not help catch Penny and Hastings. Steve refuses.\nWhen Steve and Ellen get home after his release, the two men turn up and impose themselves. Fearing for Ellen's safety, Steve resigns himself to having them there for \"a couple of days.\"  Sims visits Hessler and persuades him to go to Steve's to ascertain if he has heard, or expects to hear, from his old prison mates. The veterinarian does what he is told and happens to overhear men's voices in the apartment, though he does not see anyone other than Steve. After Hessler is shaken up by Steve and leaves, Hastings follows him, in Steve's car, to the dog and cat hospital where he prevents Hessler's phone call to the police by murdering him.\nPenny, meanwhile, is laying out the details of his plan to rob a bank. Steve insists he will not be involved but when Hastings returns to report that he has \"fixed\" Hessler \"real good\" and, because someone heard the commotion and summoned police, he had to leave Steve's car behind, Penny notes that Steve is involved whether he wants to be or not. Penny then decides that all four will leave the apartment and set the bank job in motion. Sims finds the car and immediately orders an All Points Bulletin be issued for Steve Lacey, \"wanted for murder.\"\nPenny and Hastings direct Steve, in a stolen car, to a hideout where two other thugs are waiting. The deal is set that Steve must help with the robbery, as getaway driver, or Ellen will be harmed.\nWhen they pull the job, the criminals are ambushed; the entire bank is staffed with police officers. Steve takes off for the hideout, with Sims in pursuit. At the hideout, Steve fights off the gang member who is holding Ellen hostage. Sims takes the couple away in his car.  After revealing that the note Steve left in his medicine cabinet, alerting police to the robbery, was found and helped to set the trap, Sims lectures Steve about how he chose to handle the situation - \"Next time, Lacey, call me...you got trouble, you need help, call me.\"  He then sends the two home.", "tmdb_id": 19618}, "18921547": {"title": "The Crowded Day", "plot": "The Christmas holidays are approaching, and a group of shopgirls head to their jobs at Bunting and Hobbs, a busy London department store. Peggy French (Joan Rice) is upset at her shopman fiance, Leslie Randall (John Gregson), because he refuses to sell his vintage car, \"Bessie\", that takes up all of his time and money. Peggy notes that he went to a car club meeting the previous night instead of taking her on a date, that he spends on the car instead of saving so they can get married, and that he has not even bought her an engagement ring. As they head into their respective jobs in the furnishings and estates departments, they quarrel and Peggy breaks off their engagement. She also refuses to let Leslie take her to the staff Christmas party that night and leads him to believe that she has been dating the kind but very proper personnel manager, Philip Stanton (Cyril Raymond). In reality, although Mr Stanton is charmed by Peggy, he is not interested in fraternizing with any of the shopgirls as that is improper for a manager and could cost him his job.\nLeslie attempts to win Peggy back, but his efforts get him reported by Peggy's supervisor Mr Preedy, who has been making romantic overtures to Peggy despite being a married man and sees Leslie as unwelcome competition for her affections. Leslie also gets reported by his own supervisor after Leslie botches his assignment of showing a house to friends of the store owner, Mr Bunting, because he is distracted by trying to make up with Peggy. Mr Stanton, looking through Leslie's personnel file, sees a report he wrote about promotions and thinks he might transfer Leslie to a higher-paying position in the publicity department. Mr Stanton also gives Leslie's report to Mr Bunting, saying it contains new and useful ideas. Leslie later informs Mr Stanton that he took the ideas for the report out of a book written by Mr Bunting, causing Mr Stanton to worry that he himself will now be sacked for repeating Mr Bunting's own ideas back to him.\nAnother shopgirl, Yvonne Pascoe (Josephine Griffin), is worried and ill at work. She tells Peggy that she urgently needs to get in touch with her fiance, Michael Blayburn, who left his mother's home two months ago to look for a job so that he could marry Yvonne. Yvonne has not heard from Michael since he left, and when she tries to telephone his wealthy mother to find out his whereabouts, she is rebuffed. Peggy suggests Yvonne go visit Mrs Blayburn at her home during Yvonne's noontime break from the cosmetics counter. Yvonne does this, but Mrs Blayburn is cold to her and tells her Michael is tired of her and doesn't want to see her or hear from her. When Yvonne confesses she is pregnant with Michael's baby, Mrs Blayburn becomes angry, calls her a \"slut\" and orders her out of the house. Yvonne is late getting back to work and is reported by Moira, who is annoyed at having to work all alone at the busy cosmetics counter. Mr Stanton meets with Yvonne, learns she is pregnant, and tells her she will have to stop working, although she can have her job back after the baby is born and put up for adoption. He suggests Yvonne visit the welfare office in the meantime, since she has no other family to turn to.  Yvonne returns to the cosmetics counter, where she pockets a prescription intended for a customer that contains strychnine and leaves the store. In her hurry to leave, she fails to take an urgent note that a young man left for her at the counter; the note falls on the floor and is trampled by shoppers.\nAt the staff Christmas party that night, Peggy tries to attach herself to Mr Stanton, interrupting his efforts to socialize with Mr Bunting's homely daughter. Leslie then appears and Mr Bunting calls him over and praises him on his fine report, putting Leslie on track for the well-paying publicity department job. Leslie pays Peggy back for her deception by telling Mr Bunting that he heard Peggy and Mr Stanton were engaged, causing Mr Bunting's daughter to burst into tears. After the party, Peggy learns that Leslie has sold his old car, thus proving that he cares more about her than the car. She happily reunites with him, only to find he has bought an even older car.\nMeanwhile, shopgirl Suzy (Vera Day), who dreams of being a film actress, is seduced after the party by her date, a chauffeur who has pretended to be a director and promised her a screen test. Alice, another shopgirl who could not get a date for the party, hires a paid male escort, only to have him tell her at the end of the evening he enjoyed going out with her and the date is free of charge. Eve Carter, a beautiful but mysterious model at the store, is shown to be secretly happily married to (and, it is implied, financially supporting) a man using a wheelchair. She hides her marriage by taking off her wedding ring at work so she will not lose her job.\nYvonne does not attend the party, but wanders the dark streets of London contemplating suicide. At one point she orders tea from a stall and starts to take the strychnine pills, but is interrupted by the menacing sexual advances of a customer at the stall. He chases her through the streets until she finally escapes into a church, where she collapses in tears, but decides not to kill herself. As she walks home past Bunting and Hobbs, she throws the pills into a waste bin. The next morning, the watchman (Sid James) finds the note that Yvonne never received, crumpled on the floor.

Daffy visits Elmer Fudd at his house as he is preparing to leave for work, and says that Acme has authorized him to install, at no cost, a complete line of ultra-modern automatic household appliances (on a 10-day free trial). Elmer tries to speak but is repeatedly interrupted by Daffy, who grabs Elmer by the arm and escorts him to a bus to take him to the office. Despite Elmer's protests that he has his own car, he is placed on a non-stop bus to Duluth.\nLater that day, Elmer hitches a ride in a van from Duluth and returns home. Daffy greets Elmer at the front door and welcomes him to his new future-antic push button home. Elmer sees that his house is different and asks Daffy what he's done, but Daffy quickly pushes a button and a machine removes Elmer's hat and coat. Daffy then guides Elmer to a massaging chair.  Elmer likes it at first, but Daffy pushes a button and Elmer receives an aggressive massage, which dazes him. The chair then automatically puts a cigar in Elmer's mouth and lights it, but the smoke activates a robotic fire extinguisher from another room which douses Elmer with a bucket of water. Daffy states \"It's, uh, very sensitive to heat. Probably needs adjusting\", then guides Elmer into the kitchen. Daffy encourages Elmer to bask in the kitchen's \"treasure trove of work-saving appliances\" and demonstrates a new knife sharpener which ends up destroying the blade on one of Elmer's knives. Undaunted, Daffy points out the garbage disposal, which is revealed to be a pig which is housed under the kitchen sink (presumably because of budget cutbacks).\nDaffy then shows Elmer the \"main control panel\" which operates all of the new appliances. Daffy suggests what Elmer would do if the walls were dirty. Elmer simply says that he would scrub them, though Daffy pushes a button marked \"Wall Cleaner\" and a robotic device emerges to clean the walls but it removes Elmer's wallpaper instead (humorously defacing a portrait of a captain in the process by removing all but the captain and his underwear). Daffy tries to adjust the device but the adjustment causes it to start removing the plaster (\"Oh! My walls are wuined!\"). Daffy quickly deactivates it, then asks Elmer if he is tired of looking at his dirty windows; Daffy then summons a machine which covers Elmer's window with bricks, and says that he'll \"never have to look at those dirty windows again\". Elmer becomes angry, telling Daffy that \"[he's] so angwy, [he's] burning up!\" which again activates the fire extinguisher and Elmer is doused with another bucket of water (\"I tried to warn you!\"). Daffy tries to continue the demonstration, but Elmer objects, saying that something bad happens to him whenever Daffy pushes a button. So Daffy agrees to let Elmer push a button. Elmer spots an unmarked red button, saying in his distinct voice, \"I think I'll push this wed one.\" Daffy stops Elmer, shouting, \"No, no, no, no, no!  Not the WED one!  Don't EVER push the WED one!\" Elmer pushes another button that reads \"Burglar Alarm\" and a mechanical dog comes out of the wall which bites him in the leg, and he screams in pain.\nDaffy then takes Elmer into a bedroom and shows him a device which will automatically tie a neck tie, from the options of Bow, Four-in-hand, Five-in-hand, False Granny, Windsor, Smindsor and an unlabeled option. Daffy tries to demonstrate it, but mistakenly pushes the unmarked button, causing the machine to put Elmer in a noose (\"Help! Get me down!\"). Daffy shuts off the machine and casually refers to the noose as the \"Alcatraz Ascot\" as if it were a type of neck tie. Elmer is exhausted, telling Daffy that he wants all of the \"push-button nonsense\" removed and tries to go upstairs and take an aspirin, but cannot do so because his stairway has been removed. Daffy confidently boasts that there is no need to walk up stairs in a push-button home, and uses an elevator-like device to bring the \"upstairs (to the) downstairs\". Elmer seems impressed but asks what happens to the downstairs, and Daffy raises the upstairs which shows that everything downstairs has been destroyed. Elmer asks if there is \"any more cwever gadgets to demonstwate, Mr. Smarty Salesman?\", and when Daffy says no, Elmer makes a phone call but the conversation is inaudible. When Elmer hangs up there is a knock on his front door and a large crate is brought inside. Elmer opens the crate and starts the motor, telling Daffy about his new \"future-antic push-button salesman ejector\" which grabs Daffy by the shoulders and wheels him out of the house, kicking him repeatedly (it was done as revenge from Elmer).\nWith Daffy gone, Elmer remembers the red button and wonders \"what that wed button is for?\" Despite Daffy's warning to never touch it, Elmer's curiosity gets the better of him, and when he pushes it, a display reads \"IN CASE OF TIDAL WAVE\".  A hydraulic lift raises his house high into the air.

All the while his public bravado was merely a cover to collect evidence for analysis.\nEventually it becomes clear that Decker shot & killed the sheriff in order to further his plans to obtain all the land necessary to control and exploit the transit of cattle over those properties. With the help of gunfighter Jack Larson (Alan Hale Jr.), who had earlier come to blows with Destry but ultimately comes to a respectful accord with the new deputy, arrests from Decker's gang are made and it seems evident that Decker will be arrested for the murder. However a jailbreak is committed, on Decker's orders, and Barnaby is killed in the jail. Destry finally abandons his resolve to seek orderly resolution and heads to the saloon with gun in hand. A shootout follows, in which Decker, his gang, the mayor and even Brandy (who sacrifices herself to save Destry) are killed.

She is armed with a raygun that can paralyse or kill, and is accompanied by a tall, menacing robot named Chani.\nProfessor Arnold Hennessey, an astrophysicist, accompanied by journalist Michael Carter, is sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the crash, believed to be caused by a meteorite. The pair come to the Bonnie Charlie, a remote inn run by Mr and Mrs Jamieson in the depths of the Scottish Highlands.\nAt the bar they meet Ellen Prestwick, a fashion model who came to the Bonnie Charlie to escape an affair with a married man.

Not knowing what a Tasmanian Devil is, Bugs walks down the stairs into his hole and looks in an encyclopedia. It describes the Tasmanian Devil, or Taz, as a \"strong, murderous beast\", with \"jaws as powerful as a steel trap\" and a \"ravenous appetite\", who eats a long list of animals. Taz, unknown to Bugs, has spun into the area and is actually standing next to the rabbit as he is reading; the marsupial interjects by writing \"and rabbits\" at the end of that list.

Taz does this, but as he is pulling the slingshot back in preparation to fling the pre-loaded rock, Bugs saws down the anchoring tree. Taz soars backwards and crashes.\nAs Bugs laughs and enjoys Taz's misfortune, a real fawn appears next to him.

Tony invites Swann to his Maida Vale flat on a pretext, and tells him of Margot's affair. Tony also confides that six months previously, he stole Margot's handbag, which contained a love letter from Mark, and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony entraps him, threatening to turn him in as Margot's blackmailer unless he kills Margot. With the added inducement of \u00a31,000 in cash, Swann agrees to the murder and Tony explains his plan. Tony and Mark will attend a party while Margot stays home alone. At a specific time when Margot is certain to be in bed, Swann will enter the flat using Margot's latchkey, which Tony will stash under the foyer carpet, and hide. Minutes later, Tony will telephone the flat from the party and Swann will kill Margot when she answers the call. Swann will then whistle over the phone to signal the job is done, leave signs of a burglary gone wrong, and replace the key under the foyer carpet when he departs.\nThe following night, Swann enters the flat and Tony calls as planned. When Margot comes to the phone, Swann tries to strangle her with his scarf, but she fatally stabs him with scissors. Upon hearing Margot plead for help instead of Swann's whistle, Tony advises her not to speak to anyone. He returns home, calls the police, sends Margot to bed, and transfers what he thinks is Margot's key from Swann's pocket into her handbag. He also attempts to frame Margot by planting Mark's letter on Swann and destroying Swann's scarf.\nThe next day Tony persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police. Chief Inspector Hubbard arrives and questions the Wendices and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard says the evidence indicates that Swann entered through the front door, Tony claims that Swann must have been responsible for stealing Margot's handbag, and made a copy of her key. As Tony intends, Hubbard does not believe the story and arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her. Margot is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death.\nMonths later, on the day before Margot's scheduled execution, Mark visits Tony, saying he has devised a story for him to tell the police to save Margot. Mark's \"story\" is very close to what actually happened: that Tony paid Swann to kill Margot. Hubbard arrives unexpectedly, and Mark hides in the bedroom. Hubbard asks Tony about large sums of cash he has been spending around town, tricks Tony into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and inquires about Tony's attach\u00e9 case.

Deducing that the money was Tony's intended payoff to Swann, Mark confronts Tony and explains his theory to Hubbard. Tony \"confesses\" that the cash was Margot's blackmail payment to Swann, which he had concealed to protect her. Hubbard appears to accept Tony's explanation, and Mark leaves angrily. Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony's. As soon as Tony leaves, Hubbard uses Tony's key to re-enter the flat, followed by Mark. Hubbard had already discovered that the key in Margot's handbag was Swann's own latchkey and deduced that Swann had put the Wendices' key back in its hiding-place after unlocking the door. Now, correctly suspecting Tony of having conspired with Swann, Hubbard had developed an elaborate ruse to trap him.\nPlainclothes police officers bring Margot from prison to the flat. She tries unsuccessfully to unlock the door with the key in her handbag, then enters through the garden, proving to Hubbard that she is unaware of the hidden key and is therefore innocent. Hubbard has Margot's handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. The key from Margot's bag does not work, so he uses the hidden key to open the door, demonstrating his guilt and exonerating Margot.

As Donald's tractor pretends to sleep, Chip and Dale sneak up on the beast, before unleashing the attack. Donald sets the tractor on the chipmunks to squash them, but they manage to escape. Thinking they killed the tractor, the chipmunks celebrate, but they are grabbed and chomped by it. Inside, realizing they got eaten, the chipmunks push their way out with a pipe. Infuriated, Donald gives it a new tooth: a golden one.\nA wild goose chase then occurs, with Chip and Dale retaliating by pelting a boulder & throwing a barrel of tar on the predator, leaving it with no teeth. The chipmunks evacuate, but Donald grabs them and sets them in a toolbox. Chip and Dale make their getaway with a saw and use wrenches to dismantle the tractor. All that remains of it are Donald and the chair who crash beak-first, leaving Donald dazed while the chipmunks roll back home. The chipmunks taunt Donald, who figures that if he can't force them out, he'll blast them out with dynamite. He sets firecrackers around the tree, lights the dynamite, and rushes off to await the explosion, but Chip and Dale extinguish the firecrackers, collect them, and replace the rungs on the ladder with the dynamite. Dale gets Donald alert, who then pursues him until he gets him to stop, look and listen. When Donald finds out about the charade, he quickly hurries off with the dynamite. The dynamite ladder explodes multiple times sending Donald high into the air. As they witness, Chip plays a trick on Dale; he pretends that he's the monster.

Her husband, Red Cross physician Dr. Stephen Cottrell (Bruce Bennett), is said to have been killed in action. When Donna finds out that he is actually alive - he had been captured, but was able to escape - she returns to him. She tells Matt that Stephen cannot work as a surgeon any more, as his hands were badly injured during enemy torture. She is intent on doing the right thing, but feels torn between the two men.\nThe training of the South Korean pilots makes progress, which is carefully noted by Dixon (Jess Barker), a reporter. Captain Veddors (Harry Lauter) tells him that Matt does not fly any more because he once caused a fatal crash with a test pilot. Matt receives an encrypted message announcing a serious enemy attack. MacIntyre informs Matt that Lieutenant Kim-Sun is not able to fly due to the illness of his sister, but Matt needs every man. Kim-Sun dies in the crash of his aircraft and, as a consequence, the pilots blame Matt.

He rises to and falls from great prosperity, wanders the world, and becomes increasingly drawn towards a new religion spreading throughout Egypt. His companions throughout are his lover, a shy tavern maid named Merit (Jean Simmons); and his corrupt but likable servant, Kaptah (Peter Ustinov).\nWhile out lion hunting with his sturdy friend Horemheb (Victor Mature), Sinuhe discovers Egypt's newly ascendant pharaoh Akhnaton, who has sought the solitude of the desert in the midst of a religious epiphany. While praying, the ruler is stricken with an epileptic seizure, with which Sinuhe is able to help him. The grateful Akhnaton makes his savior court physician and gives Horemheb a post in the Royal Guard, a career previously denied to him by low birth. His new eminence gives Sinuhe an inside look at Akhnaton's reign, which is made extraordinary by the ruler's devotion to a new religion that he feels has been divinely revealed to him. This faith rejects Egypt's traditional gods in favor of monolatristic worship of the sun, referred to as Aten. Akhnaton intends to promote Atenism throughout Egypt, which earns him the hatred of the country's corrupt and politically active traditional priesthood.\nLife in court does not prove to be good for Sinuhe; it drags him away from his previous ambition of helping the poor and he falls obsessively in love with a Babylonian courtesan named Nefer (Bella Darvi). He squanders all of his and his parents' property in order to buy her gifts, only to have her reject him nonetheless. Returning dejectedly home, Sinuhe learns that his parents have committed suicide over his shameful behavior. He has their bodies embalmed so that they can pass on to the afterlife, and, having no way to pay for the service, works off his debts in the embalming house.\nLacking a tomb in which to put his parents' mummies, Sinuhe buries them in the sand amid the lavish funerary complexes of the Valley of the Kings. Merit finds him there and warns him that Akhnaton has condemned him to death; one of the pharaoh's daughters fell ill and died while Sinuhe was working as an embalmer, and the tragedy is being blamed on his desertion of the court. Merit urges Sinuhe to flee Egypt and rebuild his career elsewhere, and the two of them share one night of passion before he takes ship out of the country.\n\nFor the next ten years, Sinuhe and Kaptah wander the known world, where Sinuhe's superior Egyptian medical training gives him an excellent reputation as a healer. Sinuhe finally saves enough money from his fees to return home; he buys his way back into the favor of the court with a precious piece of military intelligence he learned abroad, informing Horemheb (now commander of the Egyptian army) that the barbarian Hittites plan to attack the country with superior iron weapons.\nAkhnaton is in any case ready to forgive Sinuhe, according to his religion's doctrine of mercy and pacifism. These qualities have made Aten-worship extremely popular amid the common people, including Merit, with whom Sinuhe is reunited. He finds that she bore him a son named Thoth (Tommy Rettig), a result of their night together many years ago, who shares his father's interest in medicine.\nMeanwhile, the priests of the old gods have been fomenting hate crimes against the Aten's devotees, and now urge Sinuhe to help them kill Akhnaton and put Horemheb on the throne instead. The physician is privately given extra inducement by the princess Baketamun (Gene Tierney); she reveals that he is actually the son of the previous pharaoh by a concubine, discarded at birth because of the jealousy of the old queen and raised by foster parents. The princess now suggests that Sinuhe could poison both Akhnaton and Horemheb and rule Egypt himself (with her at his side).\nSinuhe is still reluctant to perform this evil deed until the Egyptian army mounts a full attack on worshipers of the Aten. Kaptah manages to smuggle Thoth out of the country, but Merit is killed while seeking refuge at the new god's altar. In his grief, Sinuhe blames Akhnaton for the whole mess and administers poison to him at their next meeting. The pharaoh realizes what has been done, but accepts his fate. He still believes his faith is true, but that he has understood it imperfectly; future generations will be able to spread the same faith better than he. Enlightened by Akhnaton's dying words, Sinuhe warns Horemheb that his wine is also poisoned, thus allowing him to marry the Princess and become Pharaoh.\nLater, Sinuhe is brought before his old friend for preaching the same ideals Akhnaton believed in and is sentenced to be exiled to the shores of the Red Sea, where he spends his remaining days writing down his life story, in the hope that it may be found by Thoth or his descendants.

As he collapses, he drops his wallet. A bystander picks it up, steals the cash, and shoves the wallet into a wastebasket. As a result, there is no way to immediately identify the body.\n\nGeorge Caswell, a member of the Tredway board of directors and one of the investment bankers with whom Bullard had just met, sees what he believes is Bullard's body in the street below their offices. He tells his broker to make a short sale of as much Tredway stock as he can before the end of trading that Friday afternoon. Caswell plans to make an easy profit and cover the sale by buying Tredway stock at \"a 10-point discount\" on Monday, when news of Bullard's death will push the stock price down. Caswell begins to doubt that it was Bullard who died, but when he reads in a newspaper that the man had the initials \"A.B.\" on his clothes and cufflinks, he calls the police to tip them off to the identity of the deceased.\nBullard had never named his successor nor had he appointed an executive vice-president since the previous one died. Over the next 28 hours, Tredway's executives vie for the position of president. \nCompany controller Loren Shaw arranges Bullard's funeral and coordinates the company's public reaction. In so doing, he undercuts treasurer Frederick Alderson, one of Bullard's close friends, and this effectively diminishes Alderson in his own eyes so that he does not seek the presidency. Shaw also releases the upcoming quarterly report so that the news of big profits can counter the effect of Bullard's death and perhaps even raise the stock price when the market opens. Ambitious, but narrowly focused, Shaw is concerned more with short-term accounting gains and satisfying the stockholders than the quality of the company's actual products and long-term growth. \nHe gains the proxy of Julia Tredway, the daughter of the company's founder, who is a major shareholder and board member. She had been considering selling her stock after realizing the futility of her difficult romantic relationship with and love for Bullard after many years. She was finally heartbroken after coming second behind the company for both her father and Bullard.\nShaw buys Caswell's vote in exchange for allowing Caswell to purchase 4,000 shares of company stock at the Friday closing price to cover his unscrupulous short sale. If Caswell does not get those shares, he will be in serious financial trouble. Meanwhile, Walt Dudley, the back-slapping Vice President of Sales, is having an affair with his secretary, Eva Bardeman, which Shaw uses to blackmail him.\nVice President of Manufacturing Jesse Grimm decides to retire instead of seeking the top job. But while he is no fan of Shaw's, he has serious reservations about the relative youth of the only other potential contender, Don Walling, the idealistic Vice President for Design and Development.\nAll these machinations result in Shaw having enough votes to get the job even before the board meets. Treasurer Alderson and Walling, however, are determined to thwart Shaw. Walling convinces Alderson to back him. Walling is a strong believer in developing new, higher quality products and more efficient manufacturing methods, although his wife, Mary, is against his giving up his dream of being a full-time designer.\nAt an emergency board meeting on Saturday evening, the machinations, bargaining, and maneuvering culminate in Walling's enthusiasm, vision, and his stirring boardroom speech eventually swaying Grimm, Dudley and Julia Tredway to his side.

When he realizes a professional mechanic is required, he invites Susan and Joan to rest at the nearby Garden of Eden resort until a garage opens. After making them comfortable in a cabin at the \"members only\" resort, Johnny leaves to arrange to have the car worked on, but fails to advise Susan and Joan that they are in the middle of a nudist colony.\nMeanwhile, the abandoned car has been found by a Highway Patrol unit and Lattimore is advised. After a short nap, Susan awakens, looks out the cabin window and is surprised to see Joan, and other children, playing without any clothes on. Several naked adults also pass by. When Johnny returns to explain that he is arranging to have her car repaired, Susan tells him that she thinks that the children are delightfully natural naked, but is not convinced about the adults and decides to remain in the cabin until the car is ready. Johnny tells Susan that he is an actor and also works at the camp.\nLattimore, meanwhile, receives a phone call from the police advising him that Susan and Joan are safe at the Garden of Eden, which he assumes is a motel.

In the dream, Johnny swims up to her, but she is embarrassed by their nudity and asks him to leave. When Susan wakes up, Johnny is there with an update on the car and she tells him that that evening the director has asked them to perform a scene together from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet.\nLater, during the performance for the clothed theater group, Lattimore arrives at the camp's entrance demanding to take Joan home with him. However, some members persuade him that he is tired and angry and should rest overnight and resume discussions in the morning. Before going to sleep, Lattimore visits Joan, who tells him that she is happy there and wonders why he is so grouchy and makes her mother cry. Early the next morning, unaware that he is in a nudist camp, Lattimore leaves his cabin for a stroll and meets the theater director, whom he recognizes as a famous Shakespearean actor, but is stunned when the man goes swimming naked.\nAfter observing more nudists, Lattimore phones his lawyer demanding that he take action against Susan and Joan, but the lawyer refuses as, he too, is a nudist. Later, Lattimore meets Johnny and apologizes for his conduct the night before and, after wandering around the camp and observing how relaxed everyone is, becomes enthused about nudism and decides to become a member.

Prominent placement in the film is given to Miller's courtship and marriage to Helen Burger (June Allyson), and various cameos by actual musicians who were colleagues of Miller.\nSeveral turning points in Miller's career are depicted with varying degrees of accuracy, including: the success of an early jazz band arrangement; his departure from the Broadway pit and sideman work to front a band of his own; the failure of his first band on the road; and the subsequent re-forming of his successful big band and the establishment of the \"Miller Sound\" as typified by \"Moonlight Serenade\". Also depicted is Miller's international success touring his band in support of the Allies in World War II.\nThere are several anachronisms in the picture. When the military band led by Miller is playing in front of General \"Hap\" Arnold, a B-29 bomber is in the background. The marching troops are desegregated, which did not occur until 1948. Scenes ostensibly shot in England are clearly staged in the U.S., as witness the presence of RCA Type 44 microphones during a BBC broadcast.

Fishing catches mysteriously drop to zero and are blamed by an elder on the ancient sea creature known as \"Godzilla.\" Reporters arrive on Odo Island to further investigate. A villager tells one of the reporters that something in the sea is ruining the fishing. That evening, a storm strikes the island and destroys the reporters' helicopter, and Godzilla, briefly seen by some of the villagers, destroys 17 homes and kills nine people and 20 of the villagers' livestock.\nOdo Island residents travel to Tokyo to demand disaster relief. The villagers' and the reporters' evidence describes damage consistent with something large crushing the village. The government sends paleontologist Kyohei Yamane to lead an investigation on the island, where giant radioactive footprints and a trilobite are discovered. The village alarm bell is rung, and Yamane and the villagers rush to see the monster but retreat after they see that it is a giant dinosaur. Yamane presents his findings in Tokyo, estimating that Godzilla is 50 m tall and evolved from an ancient sea creature becoming a terrestrial creature. He concludes that Godzilla has been disturbed by underwater hydrogen bomb testing. Debate ensues about notifying the public about the danger of the monster. Meanwhile, 17 ships are lost at sea.\nTen frigates are dispatched to attempt to kill the monster using depth charges. The mission disappoints Yamane, who wants Godzilla to be studied. When Godzilla survives the attack, officials appeal to Yamane for ideas to kill the monster, but Yamane tells them that Godzilla is unkillable, has survived H-bomb testing, and must be studied. Yamane's daughter, Emiko, decides to break off her arranged engagement to Yamane's colleague, Daisuke Serizawa, because of her love for Hideto Ogata, a salvage ship captain. When a reporter arrives and asks to interview Serizawa, Emiko escorts the reporter to Serizawa's home. After Serizawa refuses to divulge his current work to the reporter, he agrees to give Emiko a demonstration of his recent project if she keeps it a secret. The demonstration horrifies her, and she leaves without mentioning the engagement. Shortly after she returns home, Godzilla surfaces from Tokyo Bay and attacks Shinagawa. After attacking a passing train, Godzilla returns to the ocean.\nAfter consulting international experts, the Japanese Self-Defense Forces construct a 30 m high and 50,000 V electrified fence along the coast and deploy forces to stop and kill Godzilla. Dismayed that there is no plan to study Godzilla for its resistance to radiation, Yamane returns home, where Emiko and Ogata await and hope to get his consent for them to wed. When Ogata disagrees with Yamane and argues that the threat that Godzilla poses outweighs any potential benefits from studying the monster, Yamane tells him to leave. Godzilla resurfaces and breaks through the fence to Tokyo with its atomic breath and unleashes more destruction across the city. Further attempts to kill the monster with tanks and fighter jets fail, and Godzilla returns to the ocean. The next day, hospitals and shelters are crowded with the maimed and the dead, and some survivors suffer from radiation sickness.\nDistraught by the devastation, Emiko tells Ogata about Serizawa's research, a weapon called the \"Oxygen Destroyer,\" which disintegrates oxygen atoms and causes organisms to die of a rotting asphyxiation. Emiko and Ogata go to Serizawa to convince him to use the Oxygen Destroyer, but he initially refuses and explains that if he uses the device, the superpowers of the world will surely force him to construct more Oxygen Destroyers for use as a superweapon.

Dr. David Sheppard, from the Office of Scientific Investigation (OSI) in Washington, D.C., is called in to investigate the mysterious deaths. Working with Joanna Merritt, another OSI agent already at the facility, Sheppard determines that the deaths among the laboratory's 150 top scientists are due to sabotage of the facility's Nuclear Operative Variable Automatic Computer (NOVAC), which controls and co-ordinates all the equipment in the underground facility.\nIt is far more difficult, however, to determine how the sabotage is being done. The unseen enemy strikes again and again, snuffing out the lives of five scientists and two human test subjects in quick succession, as well as Major Howard, the complex's Chief of Security. In addition, both Madame Elzevir (solar engineering scientist) and Dr. Peter Burden (chief atomic engineer) are attacked, but manage to survive, although both are injured.\nEventually, Sheppard determines that a powerful radio transmitter and receiver were secretly built into NOVAC during its construction in Switzerland, without the knowledge or consent of its designer, Dr. Zeitman. An enemy robot plane, whose fiberglass body does not register on radar, has been flying overhead, beaming precisely focused, ultra-high-frequency radio signals into the complex to control NOVAC's every function. The computer, in turn, controls Gog and Magog, two huge mobile robots with multiple arms, powerful gripping tools, and other implements.\nMagog is finally directed to go to the complex's nuclear reactor control room and pull the safety rod out of the atomic pile, starting a chain reaction that will build to a nuclear explosion, which in turn will destroy the entire facility. Sheppard arrives in time to push the safety rod back into the pile, stopping the chain reaction. He then attacks the robot with a flame thrower and disables it, but Gog soon follows its twin to the reactor room to finish the job. Sheppard's flame thrower runs out of fuel as the robot advances on him. Dr. Van Ness arrives with another flame thrower, but the control valve sticks, and Gog now turns on him. Sheppard desperately begins using the nozzle of his flame thrower as a bludgeon, trying to smash the robot's electronic tubes. The now-crippled robot begins spinning back and forth, its arms thrashing about wildly. At that point, Gog suddenly comes to a halt, its metal arms falling limply to its sides. American F-86 and F-94 jet fighters have found and destroyed the enemy plane, ending NOVAC's reign of destruction.

Jones meets Professor Montel and a small group of international scientists, businessmen, and statesmen who suspect the Communist Chinese are building a secret atomic base on an island somewhere north of Japan. They must have proof, and so offer Jones $45,000 if he will command a World War II-era Japanese submarine to follow a Communist Chinese freighter Kiang Ching, which has been making suspicious deliveries in that area. Jones reluctantly agrees, providing that the submarine is armed, and that he is allowed to hire some of his former navy shipmates.

Denise detects an extremely high level of radioactivity but is forced to shoot and kill a Chinese soldier who stumbles upon her. Back aboard the submarine, Jones is worried because he recognized an American B-29 bomber sitting on an airstrip.

Upon reaching orbit around Cassa 7, Reggie and Vena are rescued by Jones and Winky, and it is revealed to the Rangers that the missing ships are actually being hijacked by a group of space pirates led by Rinkman (Henry Brandon), using a method created by partner in crime Dr. Vanko (Gabriel Curtiz) in which the ships' power and equipment are neutralized, turning them into artificial satellites of Cassa 7. Jones speculates that the pirates must be operating from a base at the nearby planet of Prah, on which no unauthorized landing has ever successfully taken place due to an unknown defense barrier. Meanwhile, on the planet Ophecius, we learn that its ruler, Queen Cleolanta (Patsy Parsons), is actually the one employing the pirates and is behind the looting of the vessels near Cassa 7. Jones and Winky seek help from Professor Newton (Maurice Cass) who offers to equip their vessel with a cloaking device utilizing \"cold light\" (it is explained that as heat can cause things which aren't there to visually appear, such as mirages, cold can purportedly cause objects to visually disappear). Using cold light, Jones successfully lands on Prah and discovers \u2014 after being captured by Rinkman and made an offer to join him as a pirate in exchange for the cold light device \u2014 that the pirates are actually working for someone else, although Rinkman doesn't reveal who it is. With Winky's help, Jones escapes and the two flee Prah.\nDown on Cassa 7, Space Traffic Controller Ken (James Griffith) is secretly a double agent working for the pirates, and informs them of Rocky Jones' arrival. The pirates come to Cassa 7 and capture Rocky, who is bound and tied next to Ken's Martian assistant Hagar Nu, also bound and tied. Hagar Nu explains to Jones that he was kidnapped by Ken in order to frame him as the inside pirate collaborator. Jones and Hagar manage to escape, and Jones manages to trick the pirates into thinking his (still invisible) ship is no longer on the planet by switching a mark Ken had made on a platform to denote its location. Ken is captured by Jones, but manages to break free for a moment and warn the pirates over the loudspeaker. Hagar plants plastic explosives in the nozzle of the pirate's ship which will detonate on takeoff, but Jones is determined to take them alive and leaves to warn the pirates of the danger. Rinkman ignores Jones' warning and a fight ensues. The other pirates attempt to launch, but the ship doesn't respond, and a fistfight between Jones, Winky, and the pirates ensues, with Space Rangers emerging victorious. Winky reveals that he had disabled the ship's fuel pumps, thus preventing it from launching. The film ends with Winky pondering whether or not a girl is still waiting for him to go on a date, and offering to see if she has a friend for Jones.\nThe story is continued in Crash of the Moons.", "tmdb_id": 154371}, "34595505": {"title": "Manohara (film)", "plot": "Kesarivarman, an artiste, comes to the court of king Purushothaman, along with his wife Vasanthasenai to perform.

According to folklore gypsies are descendants of an Egyptian pharaoh. In the film, actors are dressed in ancient Egyptian costumes as they dance to flamenco music. As the story continues, the gypsies are run out of their lands and are forced to live nomadic lives, stealing and thieving as a means to survive.

This scene presents some of the most entertaining banter in the entire film as Trinidad and Regalito argue their innocence with very matter-of-fact language and mannerisms common to Andalusian gypsies. Their witty mockery, while creating uproars of laughter from the courtroom audience, causes the judges to grow more infuriated with the pair. It is then that Enrique, a lawyer, steps in to defend Trinidad and Regalito. After much deliberation, the two gypsies, after having to pay a fee, are set free.\nThe fee they are required to pay forces Trinidad to find employment. Coincidentally, she finds a job as a maid in Seville at the home of Enrique, the lawyer. Instead of dismissing Trinidad, Enrique decides to make her part of an experiment he plans to conduct. His experiment is to see if he can turn Trinidad from a thieving gypsy into a functioning member of Spanish society. He plans to track change in his Pygmalion-like experiment by playing a song and seeing how she reacts to it. The more refined she becomes, the less she should react to the folkloric music. Trinidad\u2019s reaction to Enrique\u2019s statement, while humorous, presents the moral of the story: she tells him that the spirit of a gypsy is something that no one can tame and that, even though she will try because he has asked her to do this for him, it is an impossible task. Fitted with new, modern clothing, Trinidad\u2019s reaction to the music is a romping performance full of beautiful arm movements and earth-shaking stomps. Trinidad\u2019s performance is so spell binding that, not only is Enrique entranced, but her impromptu tune is so catchy that he hums along to it the very next morning.\nAs the months go by, Enrique\u2019s experiment grows more futile as Trinidad\u2019s charisma wins him over. As Enrique\u2019s coworker sees how entranced he has become by her, he plots to convince Trinidad to leave with the pretense that Enrique\u2019s career might be jeopardized by her presence in his household.

He seeks out Forrester and upon finding him, convinces him to visit a village where he is introduced to beautiful Burmese woman named Anna. They strike up a friendship and continue to see each other. During one of their conversations, he tells Anna about the loss of his past wife and his desire to end his own life by dying in action; \"You'd think that would be easy in a war\", he explains to Anna, \"but I just kept getting medals instead.\" Anna and he begin to fall in love and with Anna's support, Bill begins to recover his emotional stability.\nForrester is allowed to return to the air by flying a ferry mission. He and his new navigator Carrington (Lyndon Brook) are assigned to fly a routine non-combat flight to Meiktila. Their passenger is Flight Lieutenant Blore (Maurice Denham) who is riding in the Mosquito's bomb bay--\"strap-hanging.\" During the flight an engine fire forces them down in a remote arid area of Burma's central plain, which is controlled by the Japanese. The soil on the arid plain and the surrounding hills have a purple hue, thus the name of the film.\nCarrington is injured during the crash landing. His leg is badly burned and he is unable to walk. Without supplies and very little water, Forrester decides their best chance for survival is to walk 30 miles to the nearest river, where they can get the much needed water. From there they would stand a better chance for rescue. Blore on the other hand, believes their best chance is to stay with the plane and wait for rescue, as search parties would surely be looking for them. Blore's hope is bolstered by sighting an airplane flying high overhead, on the same route they were on before the crash. Forrester points out that being spotted from such a great altitude is one in a million. Blore is convinced and decides to go with Forrester's plan. They build a stretcher for Carrington out of bamboo and set out for the river by walking at night and resting during the day. As the three men struggle to survive in the hostile environment, the self-destructive Forrester proves to be the one with the strongest will to live. His goal becomes the survival of the other two and seeing Anna again.\nDuring the trek, Blore, while carrying the stretcher from the front, slips and falls down a rocky slope. In the fall he breaks his collar bone and is badly skinned up. Unable to continue carrying the stretcher, and with the meagre water supply dwindling, Forrester alters their plan. Blore must continue on to the river while Forrester stays with Carrington. Once there he can bring back water for the both of them. Blore once again objects and wants for all of them to return to the airplane. Forrester tells him to sleep on the suggestion and they can decide once they get some rest.\nUpon waking, Forrester discovers that Blore has gone, but he has left a canteen with some water in it. Forrester tells Carrington that he will go bring Blore back and leaves the canteen with him. He sets out to rescue Blore once again and without water, only to hear the gunshot of Blore committing suicide before he can catch up with him. Upon reaching him, he takes Blore's dog tags and the pistol. He also finds Blore's wallet with a picture of his family in it, a wife and two children. The irony of the moment is striking in that Blore, the one person that claimed to have the most to live for with a family and a profession back home, ended up being the one to lose all hope so quickly. Forrester gathers up his belongings and returns to Carrington.\nThe two once again set out for the river, this time with Forrester carrying Carrington on his back. With very little water left and still many miles to go, Forrester is unable to walk any further and they collapse with exhaustion to the desert floor. Carrington convinces him that their only hope now is to take whatever water is left, and when Forrester reaches the river, to fill the canteen and bring it back. Forrester reluctantly agrees.\nNow alone and near complete exhaustion, Forrester struggles on through seemingly endless miles of scrub brush and parched arid plain. Near his limit of endurance he struggles up a hill and falls face down, unable to go any further. Upon finding some lost reserve of strength, he opens his eyes and hears the sound of water. He struggles over the crest of the hill and on the other side is a miracle. It is the river.\nThe next scene is that of the people back at his home base hearing the news of their survival. Forrester has indeed returned with the water to Carrington, and now the two are headed back on a transport airplane. Upon landing Forrester says goodbye to Carrington who must stay on the plane which will take him to a hospital. Forrester, still weak from the ordeal, is greeted by the base doctor who upon giving him a quick examination, agrees to deliver him by jeep back to the waiting Anna. The final scene is that of Forrester finding Anna asleep in her bed. He lies down beside her without waking her up and falls promptly asleep.", "tmdb_id": 73907}, "3782101": {"title": "Pushover (film)", "plot": "During a bank robbery a bank guard, in attempting to wrest a pistol from one of the two robbers, is shot and killed by the robber, Harry Wheeler (Paul Richards).\nLona McLane (Kim Novak), an unaccompanied young woman in a mink coat, leaves a movie theatre and walks to her car. When she tries to start it, it will not turn over, but almost immediately Paul Sheridan (Fred MacMurray) appears at her window to offer his assistance. He spends the evening with her as they call a mechanic, stop for a drink at a bar, and repair to his apartment.\nIn the morning, Sheridan appears at his office, a police precinct, where we discover he is a cop who has been dispatched to see what he can find out from Miss McLane, the erstwhile girlfriend of Harry Wheeler, who has now been identified as the principal bank robber.  Sheridan is presented as an honest cop who, along with his partner Rick McAllister (Phillip Carey) and a number of his other associates, has been tasked by his boss, Police Lieutenant Karl Eckstrom (E.G. Marshall), to recover the stolen $250,000 and to capture Wheeler alive so the police will be able to find out from him who his accomplice is. Among Sheridan's other associates is Paddy Dolan (Allen Nourse), who has a drinking problem but is well-liked and nearing retirement. As such he is in danger of losing his pension if he screws up again, and Lt. Eckstrom has asked Sheridan to watch out for him so that he does not screw up.  He and other officers maintain 24-hour surveillance on Lona McLane in her apartment from a stakeout apartment they rent, conveniently, across the courtyard and from the driver's seat of a car parked outside the apartment building.\nSheridan is falling for Lona, who has now figured out that he is a cop, as the mechanic fixing her car, tells her it was tampered with. She is at first furious, but quickly melts in Sheridan's arms, professing her love for him. She then tries to persuade him to kill Wheeler so the two can take off with the loot. At first he seems insulted and angrily resists\u2014he has been an honest cop\u2014 but also because he now believes he is the one being used. He orders her to leave his apartment where they have met for an assignation.\nSheridan then is shown to brood, in hallways and in his apartment stakeout, smoking cigarette after cigarette, as he mulls over the proposition Lona has made him. Eventually, he caves and they meet on the roof of the apartment building where he agrees to mastermind Wheeler's murder and the theft of the bank's money.\nMeanwhile, Sheridan's associate, Rick McAllister, has been watching through his binoculars not only Lona in her apartment but also a woman in the apartment next door, who turns out to be a nurse, Ann Stewart (Dorothy Malone). Rick has become fascinated and infatuated with her as she bustles about her apartment hanging drapes and doing calisthenics. He later saves her from an unwanted advance, and she becomes interested in him.\nAs Sheridan's plot unfolds, things go awry. He is unable to find Lona when he goes into her apartment to look for her. Miss Stewart, who is having a party next door, goes to Lona's apartment to ask to borrow some ice. As she is about to knock, Sheridan opens the door to leave, and encounters her. He rudely refuses her request and quickly closes the door.\nAs planned, Wheeler shows up, betrayed by Lona, and is nabbed by Sheridan. Because Paddy was not at his post as he should have been, Sheridan, who has agreed to hide Paddy's dereliction of duty, now has Paddy in tow. Sheridan and Paddy force Wheeler to take them to Wheeler's car where he has stowed the bag of money in the trunk. As Paddy leans in the trunk to inspect the bag, Sheridan pushes Wheeler onto Paddy and shoots Wheeler dead, claiming to Paddy that he had no choice since Wheeler had jumped Paddy and swift action was necessary.\nMeanwhile, Rick has spoken to Miss Stewart, who has told him about the man she saw in Lona's apartment. Rick believes this man to be Wheeler, and tells her to call the police if she sees the man again.\nPaddy figures out that Sheridan is not protecting him just because he wants to save his pension but because he wants the $250,000. Paddy, though a screw-up, is an honest man and vows to tell the lieutenant what has transpired. This means Sheridan would not get the money. When Sheridan moves across the front seat to prevent Paddy from opening the car door, Paddy pulls his pistol. There is a struggle and Paddy is shot in the stomach and killed with his own gun.\nNot long thereafter Miss Stewart, taking out the garbage, has another chance encounter in the hall with Sheridan, whom she recognizes as having been in Lona's apartment. She goes back to her apartment to call the police. Sheridan, watching from the stakeout apartment, enters her apartment and forces her and Lona, who has now returned, to accompany him to Wheeler's car where he believes the money is still located.\nThey walk to an alley across from where the car is parked, but a police car is parked behind it. He tells Miss Stewart to cross the street to retrieve the money from the trunk of the car. As she reaches the car, Rick, who has reached the police car unseen by Sheridan, tells her to get down when he fires his gun. He shoots towards the alleyway where Sheridan and Lona are standing. Sheridan tells Lona to leave, and runs out to Wheeler's car, in a misguided attempt to flee the scene. A detective fatally shoots Sheridan. More police arrive as Lona walks towards the dying Sheridan, and she is gently guided to the back of the police car.

Back at the fort, Argur explains to the hot-headed officer that the construction of the cross-country railroad has been halted outside Laramie by Jim Shanessy, who runs the town and wants the crew to stay and spend their money at his hotel and casino. It is only the threat of the blockade that convinces Jeff to take the assignment. He is further annoyed when his arrival in Laramie is met with dismay from the chief railroad engineer, Lee Graham, Judge Pierce and Mayor Frank Logan, who expected him to bring troops.\nGraham, Pierce and Logan grow more aghast when Jeff warmly greets Shanessy, his childhood friend. Jim is at first pleased when Shanessy offers him free board at the hotel, but when the businessman's henchmen, brothers Con and Ace Winton, deliver a two-thousand dollar gift, Jeff recognizes it as a bribe. In the lobby, Jeff agrees to meet later that night with Pierce, who is still suspicious of him, and then visits the ineffectual but good-hearted marshal, Orrie Sommers, and advises him to ready the jail cells.\nAt the casino soon after, Shanessy introduces Jeff to his partner, beautiful Lou Carter, but Jeff spurns Lou's advances and returns the money to Shanessy. Shanessy, who remains friendly even after Ace threatens Jeff and is beaten up in return, invites Jeff to his home, hoping that Jeff's lingering feelings for Shanessy's wife Helen will keep him from pursuing his new duties. Later, Jeff meets with Graham, Pierce and Logan, and then, armed with their promise of complete authority, visits the railroad work site, where the men are drinking, gambling and sleeping. After Jeff knocks out the brawny foreman, the other men back away, allowing him to shut down the makeshift saloon. The next day, however, when Jeff posts notices that all the men have been fired and construction suspended, both the workers and the town merchants complain bitterly.\nGraham calls a council meeting, at which some merchants demand Jeff's court-martial but, after he explains that he can rid the town of gambling and alcohol and only those who want to work will remain, they agree to give his plan a two-week trial. Shanessy counters by refusing to grant workers credit, and when they gather into an angry mob, as he has planned, he easily convinces them to wreak havoc on the town and defeat Jeff's plan. Jeff, however, arrests Shanessy, and that night, Lou invites Jeff to her room and, explaining that no local jury will convict Shanessy, offers to help. A mistrustful Jeff kisses her but then leaves. At the jail, Shanessy talks Jeff into visiting Helen, and when Jeff later leaves her house, too attracted to her to stay, he is beaten and deposited into a railroad car by Shanessy's men. In the morning, Jeff's absence results in a mistrial. Shanessy then instructs the workers to burn down all the railroad camps, after which every arrest Jeff makes is dismissed by crooked juries. He then sends for backup troops, but Shanessy shuts down the telegraph and, anticipating that Jeff will travel to see Augur himself, creates a landslide that blocks all traffic.\nGraham, Pierce and Logan insist that Jeff rehire the workers, and when he refuses, they send Orrie on horseback to Cheyenne to order Jeff court-martialed. Soon after, Jeff discovers that Orrie has been killed on the trail, and Lou informs him that Shanessy is the culprit, but the only way to convict him is to construct a jury out of the Wyoming women who have just been granted the right to vote.

Her father disapproves.  She cannot leave, because he needs her as hostess of his luncheon of VIPs.  He sees no reason to waste time with aspiring artists, when he has the cream of the crop at the luncheon she is about to miss. Besides, she lacks the discipline to study piano at the conservatory. She scoffs, \"You'll see. Have you ever stopped me from doing what I want?\"   He replies \"No\".\nThe couple joyfully motor to Zurich in a convertible. Bronte playfully muses how crazy it is to take her, when he must work.\nIn Zurich, the couple bring Durant's bags to her elegant furnished flat. Paul inquires about the \"For Rent\" sign that the matron (played by Celia Lovsky) had just removed from the front window. She explains that the attic had just been rented to an American (James Guest, played by John Ericson). When the affable Guest shows, Bronte tries unsuccessfully to convince Guest that he must give his room to Bronte because of seniority. Guest won't be conned.

Something you would understand.\" Father admits he doesn't like Bronte's arrogance; Daughter retorts \"You dislike him because he is like you and doesn't crumple like all the other men.\"  Father  correctly predicts their relationship is doomed, because Bronte can't give her the attention she needs, and he is a hummingbird that can't be caged.\nBronte's solo at the Symphony is a smashing success.

When she goes back stage, the joyous crowd surrounds him and she can't get near, but sees him spontaneously kiss another woman in ecstatic celebration.  When music agents shuffle him off to a back room to make deals, Durant calls out to him, but he waives her off.  When he leaves the room hours later, she is sulking.  Energized and happy to see her, he spouts off all his future plans for a tour with a finale in Rome, but indicates she can't go with as she would be a distraction.  The couple fight.

The villagers overhear this and turn to Gisaku, the village elder and miller, who declares that they should hire samurai to protect them. Since they have no money and can only offer food as payment, Gisaku advises them to find hungry samurai.\nSeveral villagers go into town and eventually find Kambei, an aging but experienced r\u014dnin, whom they see rescuing a young boy held hostage by a cornered thief. A young samurai named Katsushir\u014d asks to become Kambei's disciple. The villagers ask for Kambei's help, and though initially reluctant, he agrees. He then recruits his old comrade-in-arms Shichir\u014dji, along with Gorobei, Heihachi, and Ky\u016bz\u014d, a taciturn master swordsman whom Katsushir\u014d regards with awe. Kikuchiyo, a wild and eccentric samurai-poser, is also eventually accepted despite attempts to drive him away.\nUpon arrival, the samurai find the villagers cowering in their homes, refusing to greet them. Insulted, Kikuchiyo rings the village alarm, prompting the villagers to come out and beg for protection. Slowly, the samurai and farmers learn to trust each other. Katsushir\u014d meets Shino, a farmer's daughter whose father has disguised her as a boy, and becomes intimate despite knowing their different social classes prohibit it. Later, the samurai are angered when Kikuchiyo brings them armor and weapons, which the villagers acquired by killing other samurai injured or fleeing from battle. Kikuchiyo angrily retorts that samurai are responsible for much of the suffering farmers endure, revealing his origin as an orphaned farmer's son. The samurai's anger turns to shame.\nKambei arms the villagers with bamboo spears and divides them into squads to prepare defenses and train. Three bandit scouts are spotted; two are killed, while the survivor reveals the location of their encampment before being slain by the villagers. The samurai burn down the camp in a pre-emptive strike. Rikichi, a troubled villager aiding the samurai, breaks down when he sees his wife, who was kidnapped and made a concubine during a previous raid. Upon seeing Rikichi, she runs back into a burning hut to her death. Heihachi is killed by a gunshot while saving Rikichi from going in after his wife. At his funeral, the saddened villagers are inspired by Kikuchiyo, who raises a banner Heihachi made to represent the six samurai, Kikuchiyo and the village.\nWhen the bandits finally arrive, they are confounded by the new fortifications, which include a moat and high wooden fences. They burn the village's outlying houses, including Gisaku's mill. Gisaku's family tries to save him when he refuses to abandon it, but all perish except a lone baby rescued by Kikuchiyo. The bandits then besiege the village, but many are killed as the defenders thwart every attack, which includes cavalry charges that are allowed through a breach so that they can be ambushed.\nThe bandits possess three matchlock muskets. Ky\u016bz\u014d ventures out alone and captures one; an envious Kikuchiyo abandons his squad to bring back another. However, Kikuchiyo's absence allows a handful of bandits to infiltrate his post and kill several farmers, and Gorobei is slain defending his position. That night, Kambei predicts that the bandits will make one final assault due to their dwindling numbers. Meanwhile, Katsushir\u014d and Shino's relationship is discovered by her father, who is enraged that her virginity has been taken and beats her. Kambei and the villagers intervene; Shichir\u014dji reasons that such a coupling is normal before battle and that they should be forgiven, but the social shame is irreconcilable.\nThe next morning, the defenders allow the remaining bandits to enter the village and then ambush them. As the battle nears its end, the bandit chief hides in the women's hut armed with a musket, and shoots Ky\u016bz\u014d dead.

Maria and Frances throw in their coins, but Anita, who is planning to return to the United States to marry, declines.\nAnita takes Maria to the agency and introduces her to Giorgio Bianchi, a translator with whom she works. Maria senses that Anita and Giorgio are attracted to each other, though Anita states that the agency forbids its American and Italian employees to fraternize. Later that evening at a party, Maria is attracted by the handsome Prince Dino di Cessi, despite being warned by Frances and Anita about his being a notorious womanizer. His girlfriends become known as \"Venice girls\" after he takes them to Venice for romantic trysts. Dino charms Maria, telling her to ignore what she's heard about him.\nAfter the party, Anita and Maria walk home and Anita admits that she has no fianc\u00e9 waiting back in the United States. She's leaving because she believes she has a better chance of finding a husband in America; wealthy Italian men are not interested in mere secretaries, and the men who are interested are too poor. As they walk, Maria is pinched by a man who pesters her until she is rescued by Giorgio, who then asks Anita to go with him the next day to his family's country farm to attend a celebration. Anita reluctantly agrees.\nThe next morning, Giorgio picks Anita up in his cousin's dilapidated truck. On their way out of town, they are spotted by her boss, Burgoyne. On Giorgio's family farm, Giorgio tells Anita that he hopes to become a lawyer, despite his poverty. Anita then climbs into the truck and is almost killed when it rolls down the hill. After Giorgio rescues her, the breathless couple give in to their attraction and they kiss. Meanwhile, back at the apartment, Dino calls for Maria and asks if she will accompany him to Venice. Desiring to see Venice but not wanting to lose Dino's respect, Maria arranges for Frances to chaperone them \u2014 to Dino's disappointment.\nAt the agency on Monday, Burgoyne questions Maria about Anita's weekend with Giorgio and although she maintains that Anita did nothing wrong, Burgoyne assumes Anita is having an affair with Giorgio. The following day, he fires Giorgio. When Anita learns about this, she blames Maria for betraying her confidence and insists on moving out of their apartment. She visits Giorgio, worried that she might have ruined his chances of becoming a lawyer. Giorgio has no regrets.\nMeanwhile, Maria sets out to attract Dino's affections. She learns about the modern art he loves, his favorite food and wine, and pretends to learn the piccolo (his favorite instrument). Maria even lies about her background, telling Dino she is three-quarters Italian. Beguiled by how much he apparently has in common with Maria, Dino introduces her to his mother, the Principessa, who expresses her approval. Later, Dino confides in Maria that she is the only girl whom he has ever completely trusted. Troubled by her deception, Maria confesses her subterfuge, even showing Dino her notebook listing his interests. He angrily takes her home.\nFrances meets Anita, who admits that she and Giorgio are in love but will not marry because he is too poor. Frances returns home to comfort the guilt-stricken Maria, who is also determined to leave Rome because Dino has not contacted her since her admission. Frances tells her she is glad she is no longer young and susceptible to romance. The next morning, however, Frances suddenly announces to Shadwell that she is returning to the United States, explaining that she does not want to end up as an old maid in a foreign country. Shadwell, unaware that Frances has been deeply in love with him for fifteen years, offers her a marriage of convenience based on mutual respect. Eager to be with him under any circumstances, Frances accepts.\nThe next day, Shadwell learns that he is terminally ill and has less than a year to live unless he goes to America for experimental treatment. Shadwell returns to his villa and coldly breaks off his engagement to Frances. After Shadwell leaves, Frances learns from his doctor the truth about Shadwell's condition, and then follows him to a caf\u00e9, where she proceeds to match him drink for drink while bickering about whether he should pursue treatment. Completely drunk, Frances climbs into a nearby fountain and sobs about her life. After Shadwell takes her back to the villa and tucks her in, he goes to see Dino at the di Cessi palace. Shadwell tells Dino he is leaving for the United States where he will marry Frances. He uses reverse psychology to provoke Dino into realizing that he loves Maria.\nAfter Anita and Maria are packed and ready to leave, Frances telephones and asks to meet them at the Trevi Fountain. When they arrive, Maria and Anita are disappointed to see the fountain emptied for cleaning. When they are joined by Frances, however, the water springs up again, and the women are thrilled by its beauty. Dino and Giorgio then arrive, and as the men embrace their girlfriends, Frances is joined by Shadwell, and they happily admire the fountain, which has proved lucky to them all.", "tmdb_id": 41503}, "42536064": {"title": "Three Hours to Kill", "plot": "Jim Guthrie (Dana Andrews) returns to town three years after being falsely accused of murdering Carter Mastin (Richard Webb).

Nordstrom's daughter, Janice Roberts (Karin Booth), and her 11-year-old son Brian (Billy Chapin), nicknamed \u201cGadge\u201d, become very interested in the project.\nWhen a press conference is called to announce the creation of \"Tobor\", reporters, such as the inquisitive journalist Gilligan (Alan Reynolds), are invited to Professor's Harrison's home to see the remarkable invention. In order to undertake space travel, the remote-controlled robot has been given some human capabilities, including the ability to \"feel\" emotions and react via a telepathic device built into his robotic brain. Under the watchful eyes of Harrison's trusted assistant Karl (Franz Roehn), the giant robot Tobor is unveiled and then demonstrated. Unknown to the scientists, a foreign spy chief (Steven Geray) has quietly joined the group of reporters; he quickly draws up a plan to steal the robot.\nWhile trying to perfect the robot's control systems, an inadvertent episode involving Gadge, who sneaks into the laboratory and turns on Tobor, shows that the robot can make emotional connections with people. Gadge not only controls the robot, but when he is accidentally tossed about, Tobor appears to comfort him, as if he is sorry for hurting the boy. After cleaning up, the scientists realize that an additional chair was brought to the news conference, leading them to believe that someone has infiltrated the closely guarded laboratory. Aware that their robot could fall into the wrong hands, they construct a small transmitter in a fountain pen that is able to communicate with Tobor.\nAn organized attack by the foreign agents is thwarted by the defensive devices at the Nordstrom's home, so the spies devise another scheme.

She holds them off by telling them she first wants to finish her tapestry, but she unweaves it every night to stall. Telemachus, the son of Ulysses and Penelope, is sick of the suitors' behavior and decides to search for his father.\nIn the meantime, on the nearby island of Phaeacia, royal princess Nausicaa and her handmaidens find a shipwrecked man washed up on the shore. Due to his ordeal, the stranger has lost his memory, not even remembering his name. He is taken in by Nausicaa's parents, King Alcinous and Queen Arete, and in short time he and Nausicaa fall in love. Just on the day they are scheduled to be married, however, the stranger, longing to remember who he really is, returns to the shore and stares out to the sea. And as he does so, his lost memories begin to stir.\nGradually, the stranger remembers that he is Ulysses, who was lost at sea when his ship was blown off course in a storm during his return voyage to Ithaca, as a consequence of his desecrating Neptune's temple during the sacking of Troy. Going ashore on an unknown island to forage for food, they intrude on the cave of the cyclops Polyphemus, who locks them inside and then eats one of Ulysses' men. Upon the giant's complaint about the taste of human flesh, Ulysses suggests for Polyphemus to collect grapes for making wine. After Polyphemus leaves, Ulysses and his men prepare a stake to blind the cyclops after getting him drunk. The plan succeeds, and after Ulysses has taunted the blinded giant into removing the rock from the cave entrance, the Greeks make their escape.\nSome time afterwards, Ulysses' ship passes the rock of the sirens. Eager to learn what they sound like, Ulysses has himself tied to the mast while his men plug their ears to resist their enchanting singing, and is tormented when the sirens speak to him with the voices of his family. After passing the rocks, a strange current pulls the ship towards another island. Leaving his men to explore, Uylsses returns to find them all missing, captured and transformed into pigs by the mistress of the island, the sorceress Circe. Circe, who has fallen in love with Ulysses after learning of his heroics, strives to keep him here, but Ulysses forces her to return his men to their original forms. Persuaded by Circe to stay for a while, he stirs resentment in his men, who want to return home. Ignoring Circe's warning that Neptune will strike them down if they leave, they set out to sea on their own and perish in a storm. Blaming Circe for allowing them to die, and determined to return to his family, Ulysses begins building a raft. Circe tries to make him stay and enjoy an eternal life by her side by calling forth the dead from the underworld, including Ulysses' crew and his lost comrades-in-arms from Troy. But then his recently deceased mother Anticlea appears before him, telling him of Penelope's plight. With Ulysses' resolve reaffirmed, the embittered Circe lets him go, daring him to defy Neptune's wrath.\nWith his memory fully restored, Ulysses reveals his identity and sets out for home, breaking Nausicaa's heart. Returning to his palace disguised as a beggar, he meets Penelope, pretending to be an old friend of her husband. Upon witnessing her despair and faithfulness for him, he suggests that she hold a contest to determine the suitor who shall marry her the next day: stringing Ulysses' hunting bow and fire an arrow through a dozen axe heads. As he turns to leave, he stops to pet his old hunting dog Argos. Telemachus, who has just returned, witnesses this, and he and Ulysses reveal themselves to each other.\nThe next day, Penelope stages the archery contest, with Ulysses attending in his disguise. When the suitors are unable to string the bow, Ulysses taunts them into letting him try and succeeds with his shot, thus revealing his identity.

After several moments, he exclaims: \"I give up!\". His uncle Bugs offers to help and proceeds to tell him how rabbits made American history.\nIn the first segment, in a trade of land with the Native American Indians, Bugs explains that Manhattan wasn't the bustling city you see today, but was rather, filled with Indian teepees. Bugs explains that the Statue of Liberty was \"... just a little goil (girl) at the time\".\nIn the second segment, Bugs is interacting with Benjamin Franklin on the day that Franklin discovered electricity. \"What's up, Benny?\" Bugs asks. Ben states: \"I'm trying to discover electricity,\" and asks Bugs if he can tend to his kite (with a key tied on it, naturally), and that he must get out \"... ye first edition of The Saturday Evening Post\", so he hands his kite string to Bugs to look after until he gets back. Bugs sees a storm cloud approach, lightning hits the kite and travels down the string and electrocutes him. Ben runs back, picks up Bugs who is flashing off and on like a lightbulb, exclaiming \"I discovered electricity! I discovered electricity!\" Bugs looks at the camera and says: \"Heh ... He discovered electricity!\"\nIn the third segment, Bugs explains to Clyde about the Boston Tea Party. The King is seen approaching a worker in the Royal Tea Warehouse in Boston. With a box of hardware tacks in hand, he orders the worker to \"Spread these tacks on the Colonist's tea\". When the worker explains: \"But Your Majesty, these are carpet tacks\", the King dumps the tacks all over the place in a fit of insanity and exclaims: \"Well, they're tea tacks now!\" and exits, laughing all the way. Bugs explains to Clyde that the Colonists refused to drink their tea with tacks and that's how the Army was formed.\nIn the fourth segment, George Washington gets a letter in the mailbox, opens it and exclaims: \"Gadzooks! I've been drafted!\" He is then seen racing off on horseback to the Candy Shoppe, where he says to Martha Washington that she'll have to look after the candy stores  alone, while he is off to fight the war. He then races off screen, yelling \"Charge!\"\nIn the fifth segment, Bugs is seen approaching Betsy Ross' home where she is sewing an American flag (presumably after several failed design attempts, this is the first iteration of the flag - it has the 13 red and white colony stripes and blue field). He says: \"Hiya Bets - how's the flag coming along?\" She opens the flag displaying it and asks: \"How's this, Mr. Bunny?\" but Bugs makes a comment to Betsy that something is missing in the blue field. (Note the sign at the front gate that says: \"Watch your step - Geo. Washington slipped here\"). Pacing back and forth thinking hard about what can go in the blue field, Bugs unknowingly steps on a rake and the handle hits him in the head, forming a circle of stars around his head. He then looks at Betsy and asks: \"Hey Betsy, does this give you an idea-r?\" Betsy agrees, and starts sewing the stars into the blue space on the flag. That is how rabbits helped with the formation of the American flag.\nThe sixth segment has the enemy storming Bunker Hill. Of course, a cannon is pointed right at them, and as soon as they get close enough, the cannon goes off surprising the enemy, who then turn around and walk in the opposite direction, their uniforms and weapons in tatters.\nThe battle at Valley Forge is the seventh segment, where Bugs explains the hardships endured, including 6 ft (1.8 m) of snow and frigid temperatures. An ice cream wagon is seen driving across the snow playing Yankee Doodle, and is immediately fired upon and explodes. The practically destroyed truck turns around in the opposite direction and rides off-scene.\nThe last segment opens with Bugs explaining \"The enemy fleet was all bottled up\", showing two ships in a bottle in a harbor, then shows Bugs steering a motor boat across the Delaware River with George Washington.\nAfter Bugs tells Clyde all of these important historical events, the school bell is heard in the distance and Bugs rushes him off to school saying: \"And don't forget what I told ya!\" Later in the day, Clyde returns home with an angry look on his face and Bugs asks him: \"Well, Clyde!

A regular gambler is \"Jackpot\" (whose daughter, Nevada, is the films love interest and the town's ore assayer).\nBuying up a mine stake, the partners make a rich strike. But their miners are taken away by a better pay offer from the town's other main mining magnate, \"Bannon\". A confrontation in the street with one of the hired guns escalates tension and sparks a price war. But neither mine can keep the loyalty of mule drivers to transport the ore to the smelter to turn into cash and continue the price war. The partners plan to ship a load out of town, but are betrayed by their lawyer to Bannon. (Continuity error - far too large a couple of ore wagons for the number of horses towing it.) The wagons are bushwhacked by Bannon's men outside town and crash. Martin is left unconscious to die in the desert, but is found by a passer-by and taken back into town.\nAs Martin is returning to town, there is a cave-in at the mine with three men trapped. While the men work to free the trapped men, Menlo and Bannon discuss an offer from a state-wide magnate to run a railway to the town and the smelter, in return for a 50% stake in the town's mines. Martin arrives and incorrectly detects a double cross (financial and romantic) where there was none, and dissolves the partnership and the romance.\nMartin and Jackpot meet in a casino, and Martin wins Jackpot's mine, but by an obscure mining law it turns out that the rights to the mines are all controlled by the owner of Jackpot's mine (now Martin). The lawyer is run out of town. Menlo attempts to buy the mine from Jackpot, and discovers that it now belongs to Martin, so attempts to buy it back via Jackpot. This alerts Martin that Menlo is up to something. He is then attacked again by Bannon's hoodlums and dragged to a meeting with Bannon, who also tries to buy the mine. Martin, Nevada and Jackpot figure that something is up, work the mine, find high-quality ore that will control the whole area's strikes but are observed by one of the hoodlums.\nBannon wants to kill the prospectors, but Menlo argues against it. After a fight, Menlo is knocked unconscious and Bannon and his hoodlums head to the claims registration office to prevent the prospectors party from registering the claim. A gunfight ensues, in which the hoodlums are killed, and Menlo reappears just in time to prevent Bannon from killing Jackpot.
