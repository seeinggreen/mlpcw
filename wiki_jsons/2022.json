As the paperwork is about to be finalized, Sara asks the realtor why the house has not had anyone living in it for a long time, to which she frankly responds that there had been some gruesome incident in it many years back. Alex says that they do not want to know about it, but Sara insists that they should, and the realtor reveals that a girl had committed suicide in the house after killing her baby and father. She hands them an enveloped report and suspects that the couple will also obviously skip the property, much like everyone else before them. But Sara says that they still want to take it and even tells her husband that she would not mind a little haunting.\nSara most struggles to be close to her son, who also seems to not want to be breastfed and instead prefers milk from a bottle. Alex, a veterinarian, often works long days, leaving Sara alone with Liam. She and Alex find a locked room in their new house, which they open and to find a child\u2019s room, presumably the girl\u2019s. As they are exploring, a man arrives and scares them. He says his name is Renner, and he lives next door. He is helpful, fixing things around the house for Sara and telling her what really happened in there. Sara also opens the envelope and reads up about the incident: a young girl, Anna, used to live with her father, Robert, in the house, who she murdered along with her own infant baby, before killing herself some forty years back. \nSara begins to hear and see things in the house. It is revealed that she is suffering from postpartum depression, which leaves her feeling distant from her husband and baby. She hears children laughing and playing behind a locked door that has been hidden by a heavy wardrobe. Renner tells Sara that Anna had a brother, their mother had died in childbirth, and that Robert had been raping Anna. When Sara asks what happened to the brother, Renner says he was ignored and blamed for his mother\u2019s death. Sara reveals to him that she\u2019s seen both Anna and Robert in the house; Renner says he doesn\u2019t believe in such things and leaves. Sara invites the realtor over to ask what happened to the boy, and the realtor tells her it is Renner; he had tried to assume a new identity when he returned. \nThings begin to disappear in the house \u2014- Liam\u2019s pacifier and toy truck and Sara and Alex\u2019s wedding portrait.

She puts Liam down on the floor to investigate. As she is distracted by this, Liam nearly crawls down the stairs. He is saved by Alex. The next morning, Alex tells her he\u2019s called a psychiatrist and will not leave her alone with Liam for the time being. She tries to tell him that there\u2019s a presence in the house, but he remains logical. The psychiatrist arrives and Alex leaves for work. She lies to him when he asks if she\u2019s been hearing or seeing things. He wants her to begin taking medication, but she refuses. Sara tells him she feels none of the euphoria of motherhood, which causes her to feel embarrassed and guilty.

Sara asks if there were other babies before the one Anna killed, and he reveals there were three; he becomes visibly upset and tells her not to bother the wardrobe, that there\u2019s a reason it was placed in front of that door, and a reason only Robert could move it. \nSara pretends to take the pills for Alex\u2019s sake.

One day Frylock is summoned to Neil, who explains that he wishes to become taller. He has a scientist assistant, Elmer, who had no success in that regard and who is shown (seemingly also without success) working on creating plants with humanlike intelligence. Neil requests Frylock to repair one of Elmer's stretching machines, but Frylock suggests DNA splicing to clone a larger version of Neil, who enthusiastically agrees.\nLater that night, Frylock is attacked by muggers and badly mutilated, before he is rescued by Neil and Elmer. Since Frylock's old shell is destroyed in the attack, he is given a new metal shell by Neil and Elmer, who admire the crystal that is attached to Frylock and powers him. During his reconvalescence, it seems that a friendship develops between him and Neil.\nAfter several failed experiments, Frylock is able to splice the DNA of a giraffe and former basketball player Shawn Kemp into Neil's, which creates an extremely tall clone. The clone calls himself Big Neil and immediately usurps Neil's position, locking him inside a wooden box. \nMaster Shake and Meatwad arrive in short succession at former neighbor Carl's house, asking to crash with him. Carl only lets them stay in his backyard. \nAmazin has sent out scores of packages to addresses all over the United States.

Neil comments that he only got close to Frylock to obtain access to his crystal and that all Amazin packaging consists solely of seeds, which develop into the creatures when they are watered. When a storm creates the plant creatures all over the land and they seem to overwhelm the humans, Big Neil fires Elmer and wants to kill the creatures with pesticide.

Public prosecutor Julio C\u00e9sar Strassera is chosen to make the government's case against the military junta for alleged crimes against humanity after the military courts declined to press charges. The junta have retained the services of senior, experienced lawyers, while Strassera struggles to find lawyers to form his prosecution team amongst Argentina's largely conservative legal community. Strassera meets Luis Moreno Ocampo, his assigned deputy prosecutor, but initially rejects his offer for help, particularly after learning of his family's strong military ties and their support for the junta. Strassera receives several death threats, leading the government to assign him a security detail for him and his family.\nFinding no other lawyers, Strassera decides to accept Moreno Ocampo's offer of help. Moreno Ocampo, a professor, suggests that they look for young law graduates and inexperienced lawyers, as the senior lawyers are unwilling to risk their reputations or safety to sign on to a trial that is so divisive amongst the public. \nSlowly, Strassera and Moreno Ocampo interview and assemble a young team, many of whom are working in government offices and are able to use their access to materials to help the case. Because the atrocities were committed across the country, Strassera and his team map out areas where military prison camps were, and interview and seek out as many victims of the junta as they can to record their testimonies. Meanwhile, he and his team face serious risks to their safety, with several of them being followed, and Moreno Ocampo's family turning on him for going against their military history.\nOn the first day of the trial, the court receives a bomb threat, which Strassera argues is a fake one phoned in by supporters of the military to postpone the trial. He manages to persuade the reluctant judges that the trial must continue. The trial is fully recorded on cameras and parts of it are broadcast around the world. Many of the victims of the junta testify about the brutal and senseless torture they endured or witnessed happening to their families and loved ones. President Ra\u00fal Alfons\u00edn invites Strassera to meet with him and informs him that he is keeping a close watch on the court events as they unfold and was deeply moved by the testimony of the witnesses. Despite this, the Attorney General later intimates to Strassera that he should be lenient with the Air Force. Strassera is angered and makes vulgar gestures at the Air Force generals in court, threatening to get himself thrown out of the courtroom for contempt. \nFor his closing argument, Strassera realizes that he will have the chance to make his case not just to the judges in the courtroom, but to the people of Argentina and those around the world. With the help of his family, he composes an eloquent closing statement: \"I wish to waive any claim of originality in closing this indictment. I wish to use a phrase that is not my own, because it already belongs to all the Argentine people. Your Honors: \u00a1Nunca m\u00e1s!\".\nThe judges move into deliberations and Strassera's team is desperate to hear the outcome.

The inhabitants observe them, from their arrival until their departure. After getting back on the road, Renata stops near a house to ask for directions. They ring the house bell while Mathilde takes pictures. She then notices a human foot torn off and hanging from a clothesline; when she tries to photograph it, several dogs rip it down. The inhabitant of the house comes and asks them what they are doing. The teenagers tell him that they are looking for the house that was used for the filming of the film Arthur and the Minimoys. The inhabitant, now seeming paranoid, tells them that the area around the house is dangerous, and that they should turn around and leave. When they protest, he returns with a shotgun, and fires a shell into the air to make them leave.\nUndeterred, the group of friends manage to find a road which will lead them to the house, but are forced to stop in the forest, due to a fallen tree blocking the road.

Alex and the others begin to worrying about Momo, but continue to party nonetheless. While going to bed, Alex and Samantha mutually confess their feelings and kiss. In the night, Alex is awakened by a nightmare where he sees Momo, Pilou and himself being attacked by strangers. Leaving the tent, he notices lights coming from the distant forest, as well as several people. Thinking it is Momo, he calls out, but he gets no response and the lights suddenly go out.\nThe next day, the teenagers discover the cooler overturned, and their food eaten. Douglas thinks a bear might have done this, while the others tell him there are no bears in the area. Douglas is sent to the car so that he can take it back to town and buy new supplies, while Dominique and Maxime go swimming in the river in the forest. Douglas follows the ribbons Renata had hung from the trees to find the way back to the cars, but comes across a strange tree where a person seems to be stuck inside. As he approaches the tree, an unseen person knocks him unconscious. As Maxime and Dominique are resting by the river, they discover Momo's unconscious body, hanging upside down from a tree. Maxime, while trying to unhook the rope attached to Momo's foot, is caught in a bear trap. Dominique arrives to free Maxime's foot from the trap, and begins cutting down the ropes suspending Momo, but once freed, he plummets to his death. Meanwhile, the rest of the group find the hole used for the filming which, in the movies, was the gateway to the kingdom of the Minimoys. They tie Jean and the camera together with a rope and start lowering it into the hole to see how deep it goes. They then observe something strange that rips the camera away, pulling Jean into the hole. Alex cuts the rope that connects Jean to the camera and saves his friend.\nRenata angrily tells Alex that they should all go home after what happened.

After being joined by the group, Dominique explains to Alex that Momo is dead and begs him to leave. After treating Maxime, Alex, Jean and Dominique bring him to the cars, leaving Samantha, Mathilde and Renata at home. As they arrive at the car, they find that a log has fallen on Renata's vehicle and Douglas has gotten lost in the forest. While Alex and Jean are looking for him, they leave Dominique and Maxime behind in Jean's car with instructions to honk every two minutes to make sure they are okay, and to honk several times in case of problem. At home, Renata and Samantha sit on a swing to listen to music.\nMathilde then looks at the photos she has taken with her camera and notices in the photos that a person is watching them from the window upstairs in the house; when she turns her head to observe the window, she then sees that the person is still observing her. To be safe, she locks herself in the barn, but sees through the door that a person is lurking around the barn. She climbs onto the roof, which attracts a whole honeycomb towards Mathilde, who is allergic to bee stings. Stuck in the barn, she breaks the window to try to get out but succumbs to her allergy. Alex and Jean, still in the forest looking for Douglas, find the latter with his hands clinging to a tree. As Jean approaches him, he notices that his arms are ripped off, signifying Douglas' death. Dominique, watching over Maxime, notices that strangers are approaching the car; he then honks several times to signal the danger to Alex and Jean, but someone breaks the car window. In the distance, Alex and Jean hear the cries of their friends, but, soon enough, they are already dead. Alex and Jean therefore head towards the house to alert Renata and Samantha.\nIn the distance, Xander calls Samantha telling her to get away as soon as possible, but the person who has been watching them all along cuts the wire of the swing she is sitting on, causing her to fall into a tunnel under the house. Xander, Jean, and Renata cast a fluorescent light to locate her and grab a rope to bring her to the surface, but a hand grabs Samantha's foot and drags her down with her into the basement. Alex and Jean therefore immediately go to the basement to try to find her and, while crossing a tube, Alex falls on Pilou's lifeless body, but finds Samantha, alive and made up with paint like in the film. Jean announces to Renata, who remained on the ground floor, that they have found Samantha; as she catches her breath, a person who had confused themselves with the walls of the house with paint on her body, approaches her and kidnaps her. As they head back downstairs, Jean, Samantha, and Alex lay on the floor, taking a deep breath, but upon hearing footsteps, Alex turns around and gets knocked out with a punch.\nKidnapped by people dressed as Matassalai, characters from the Arthur trilogy, Alex, Samantha, Renata and Jean regain consciousness while they are tied up. A Matassalai approaches Alex telling him that the moon is full and that he is ready to join the world of the Minimoys, Jean tries to find a plan and cut the rope that keeps them prisoners. As the Matassalai pull on the vines to send Alex into the world of the Minimoys, as in the second part of the saga, Jean arrives to rescue her friend with Renata while Samantha leaves to seek help.\nAs she tries to get the Matassalai's attention, several people disguised as Minions (the minions of Maltazard in the movies) arrive, armed with knives, and one of them stabs Renata who bleeds out. A fight between the Matassalai and the Minions then begins. Alex tries to escape from the vines that hold him prisoner and Jean fights with a Matassalai, which knocks him out. As he is about to finish him off, Alex arrives and stabs the Matassalai in the back with a spear. After escaping, Samantha comes across a figure, which turns out to be a person disguised as Maltazard, the villain of the Arthur and the Invisibles movies. As she flees, she is caught by Maltazard, who tries to strangle her to death, but she is saved by the paranoid inhabitant of the house, whom the gang had met to ask directions. Shooting Maltazard with his rifle, he then kills the Matassalai and the remaining Minions. He then approaches Alex telling him that he told them not to approach this house because it was dangerous; he then threatens Alex by pointing his gun to his head, and tells him not to set foot in that house again, which Alex accepts. The inhabitant of the house leaves and leaves them in the middle of the corpses, but the police and the emergency services arrive to save them.\nIn the morning, the police, who have completely secured the place, announce to them the death of Mathilde and informs Alex, Samantha, and Jean that the bodies of their friends will be repatriated. The police also explain to them that their attackers were just a bunch of out-of-town, drug-addicted kids who played deadly role-playing games like Batman vs. Superman, but they started playing Arthur and the Invisibles after discovering the house that was filmed. When getting into a police van that will take them to the hospital, Alex notices an individual at the window of the top floor of the house watching them.

Arjun gets injured in the fight, but recovers two weeks later and is bound in the wheel chair with only movement in his neck. Vadraj Kumar Subramaniam/V. K. Subramaniam, who is the Chief of Indian Intelligence and Arjun's superior officer, proposes the idea of introducing a supersoldier program to the PM, which is operated through AI to save lives in times of war from any collateral damage. The supersoldiers are programmed by DRDO scientist Sabaha Qureshi, who has been modifying the program for 7 years and is on the verge of a major breakthrough.\nThe PM agrees to the proposal, but Sabaha explains that the program is developed on paralysed persons. Subramaniam selects Arjun for the program. Arjun though hesitant at first then agrees to the program, as he wants to avenge Ayesha's death. While going through the surgical process, Arjun's chances of survival are shown to be minimal, but manages to survive the on-boarding process. Arjun operates himself, under the command of the Intelligence Robotic Assistant or I.R.A, but the I.R.A gets restricted due to Arjun's trauma.

Sabaha gets caught by the terrorist Hussain, while seeking help from Arjun, but Arjun rescues her by killing Hussain and other terrorists where the two escape, thus making Hamid believe that someone else has arrived and orders to find him. Arjun reveals himself to Hamid via a walkie talkie where Hamid forces Digvijay, Subramaniam and others to force Arjun to surrender. Subramaniam tells Arjun to surrender, which he decides to do, so that he can kill Hamid and save the hostages.

To the Na'vi's dismay, the RDA, led by their new leader, Frances Ardmore, returns to colonize Pandora as Earth is dying. Among the new arrivals are Recombinants\u2014Na'vi avatars implanted with deceased human soldiers' memories\u2014with Quaritch's recombinant serving as the leader.\nA year into the occupation, Jake leads a guerilla campaign against the RDA. During a counterinsurgency mission, Quaritch and his subordinates capture Jake's children. Jake and Neytiri arrive and free them, killing several of Quaritch's soldiers, but Spider remains captured by Quaritch, who recognizes him as his son. After the RDA fails to get information from Spider, Quaritch decides to spend time with his son to draw him on his side. In turn, Spider teaches Quaritch about Na'vi culture and language. Aware of the danger posed by Spider's knowledge of his whereabouts, Jake and his family exile themselves from the Omatikaya and retreat to Pandora's eastern seaboard, where the Metkayina clan gives them refuge. There, the family learns the ways of the reef people, Kiri develops a spiritual bond with the sea, and Lo'ak befriends Tsireya, the daughter of chief Tonowari and his wife, Ronal.\nAfter defending Kiri against Aonung, Tonowari's son, Lo'ak apologizes at Jake's insistence.

During the link induced trance, Kiri suffers a seizure and falls unconscious, nearly drowning. \nJake summons Norm Spellman and Max Patel for help using their medical equipment, where they diagnose Kiri with epilepsy and warn that she cannot connect to the Spirit Tree again, as doing so may kill her. Although Ronal saves Kiri, Quaritch tracks Norm and Max's aircraft to the archipelago where the Metkayina live. Bringing Spider with him, Quaritch joins forces with the RDA's marine operations, led by Captain Mick Scoresby, and commandeers a whaling vessel that hunts Tulkuns to extract an anti-aging serum called amrita. Quaritch's squad raids the archipelago, interrogating the tribes about Jake's location to no avail. Quaritch then orders the whalers to kill Tulkuns near the villages to draw Jake out. Lo'ak mentally links with Payakan and learns that he was cast out because he went against the pacifist ways of his species and attacked the whalers who killed his mother, causing many deaths.\nWhen the Metkayina learns of the Tulkun killings, Lo'ak warns Payakan, followed by his siblings and friends. They find Payakan being hunted, and Quaritch captures Lo'ak, Tsireya, and Tuk. Jake, Neytiri, and the Metkayina set out to confront the humans and rescue the kids.

His life takes a u-turn when he meets Brishti. The film tries to highlight that love can happen anywhere, anytime.\nThe film begins with Megh becoming a father through surrogacy to two little boys (later referred to as Potol-Posto). Due to his constant denial and disinterest in marriage, his father comes to doubt if he is gay and in a relationship with his best friend. However he reveals that his disinterest is not only due to his age but also due to rejection he faced from his former girlfriend due to his love and desire for children.\nMegh goes to a toy shop to buy toys for his boys, sees Brishti scolding a man for his indecent comments. Megh, as his caring nature suggests, rescues Brishti from the ruckus, also having developed a crush on her. Through numerous encounters henceforth, he helps Brishti in various ways. It is eventually revealed that Brishti has a sour relationship with her mother due to her second marriage as she believes her mother dumped her father, while it is the vice versa. It is also revealed that she hates kids as she believes they are irrational and impractical unlike adults which breaks Megh's heart. Enter Souvik, Brishti's boyfriend, who plans to shift to Sydney with Brishti and sell the house and toy shop that Brishti and her mother have inherited from the latter's second marriage. This makes Brishti's mother furious and Brishti leaves the house with Souvik. Brishti seeks help from Megh and he finds them an apartment beside his own flat for rent. A beautiful relationship develops between Megh's parents, Brishti and Megh's children, whom Brishti begins to accept.\nWe see the constant neglect that Souvik offers in the relationship to Brishti, not being there when she needs him the most, unlike Megh, who always open heartedly tries to hear Brishti out. Brishti finds a letter in her luggage which was written by her biological father to her mother before she got married for the second time, stating that he has happily settled again and Brishti must not know of how he has dumped her. Brishti regrets not accepting her adoptive father and her mother's marriage when her adoptive father was actually alive. She tries to contact Souvik who is out of the house, but not getting any support from him, calls Megh instead. Megh consoles her. Brishi reconciles with her mother.\nSome days later, as Brishti is about to leave for sydney with souvik, her mother shows her a picture of Megh and approves him over Souvik, as he kept sending Brishti's pictures to her mother all the while that she was away.\nBrishti and Souvik have lunch at Megh's place and Brishti leaves for sydney with a heavy heart. Megh realises how important Brishti is to him and goes to stop her when his parents motivate him, however in vain. He returns home only to find Brishti waiting for him. From here onwards the director's open end trick works. It is shown that Megh imagines himself having a conversation with Brishti after entering the room. She tells him that she was always confused if Megh was her father or her lover due to his fatherly nature, hinting of the void of the fatherly love that she had always craved for. Megh assures her that she is free to love him in whatever way. Brishti says she might not be a good mother to Potol Posto but can be a good friend to them. Megh tells her that every kind of love has an affection and she is free to mould their children in any way she wants. Megh and Brishti reconcile, a happy family scene is shown, hinting at their marriage and love filled life with a sense of freedom ahead. But the moment Megh is back and another Megh is portrayed imagining the entire thing with all the other cast ignoring Megh to be back signifies that Brishti didn't return. The imagination of what could have happened if Brishti returns is what shown in the end. Many will be mistaken on this perspective and would consider this as a happy ending which is rather unrequited. One can think of all realistic possibilities to support the fact that Brishti is back but that won't be a justified one both in reality and technically. This film's climax is much more than just a happy ending. This is why this film stands out in a different way altogether.

After fighting at Sinhung-ni, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army 7th Company arrives at a location 12km from Hagaru-ri where it meets elements of the 20th Corps and the artillery battalion commanded by Commander Yang, preparing to attack the airfield and American 1st Marine Division supply base at Hagaru-ri. The PVA units drive captured American vehicles and use captured equipment.\nThe film jumps to the Sea of Japan where Douglas A-1 Skyraiders launch from U.S. aircraft carriers to attack PVA units advancing on Hagaru-ri from nine directions. The 7th Company is then strafed by United States Navy Vought F4U Corsairs, but they move on to a different target inflicting no casualties. 7th Company commander Wu Qianli realises the planes intend to attack the artillery battalion and moves his men forward. The scene then shifts to the artillery battalion column advancing in captured U.S. trucks towing artillery pieces which is then attacked by the Corsairs inflicting \"maximum damage\" on the column, destroying all the guns. The 7th Company arrives on the scene, Yang tells Qianli that all his captured guns have been destroyed, Qianli hands Yang a pistol and tells the 7th Company to go capture more guns 1.5km away. Yang then rallies his men to also go capture more guns.\nThe scene then shifts to the U.S. perimeter at Hagaru-ri which is besieged by PVA forces. PVA soldiers thrown themselves onto a barbed wire fence so that their comrades can run over their backs to attack U.S. positions. PVA forces, including the 7th Company and the artillery battalion overrun the U.S. defenders, killing many of them. Ping He uses a Bazooka to destroy a U.S. machine gun position and the U.S. flag is blown into the sky. The artillery battalion then turns the captured artillery around to begin shelling the Hagaru-ri airfield. Qianli reclaims his pistol from Yang and then moves his unit forward to attack the airfield.\nThe PVA attacks Hagaru-ri. 1st Marine Division commander Major general Oliver P. Smith is informed that that PVA are everywhere and coming in fast. The artillery battalion fires a creeping barrage ahead of the 7th Company. The Americans evacuate their hospital while Smith demands that the runway is kept open and he is put in contact with Tokyo. The scene then shifts to Tokyo where General Douglas MacArthur is attending a celebration. MacArthur receives a phone call from Smith who advises him that Hagaru-ri airfield is the rear line, that he lacks troops to hold the line and requests reinforcements to cover their withdrawal. MacArthur shouts \"Smith this is war! Retreating is treason\" and orders Smith to stop his retreat. The scene returns to Hagaru-ri where PVA artillery is now hitting the airfield and the rest of the base. A C-47 Skytrain is destroyed by artillery fire and Smith orders aircraft to use the road instead. Smith orders reinforcement of the Sumun Bridge and then orders a retreat from Hagaru-ri. Yang is wounded by U.S. artillery fire mangling his hand but alone manages to load and fire an artillery piece destroying an American gun. The Americans retreat under artillery fire as the PVA infantry overrun Hagaru-ri.\nThe scene shifts to the PVA 9th Corps headquarters at Chengfang-dong. Song Shilun is informed that the Marines are retreating and that the only route is across the Sumun Bridge.

Wu Wanli who was injured in the attack gives his blanket to a badly wounded American in the hospital. The PVA troops rest and recuperate while the commanders meet and count their casualties, Qianli receives the identity tags of the 78 men who have been killed and then leaves a lit cigarette as an offering in the snow.\nQianli receives the order to advance to the Sumun Bridge and destroy it. Qianli's radio operator points out a destroyed U.S. helicopter and says that in the future China will have their own better planes and Qianli responds that it is just a matter of time. Qianli orders the 7th Company to get ready to move out.\nThe scene shifts to The White House where President Harry S. Truman receives a telegram from MacArthur requesting use of atomic bombs to win the war. A voiceover from a 30 November press conference has Truman avoiding saying whether or not atomic bombs would be used.\nThe 7th Company advances towards the Sumun Bridge in blizzard conditions that freeze their compass. The 7th Company arrives at the bridge to find the 9th Company attacking the U.S. forces and they join the attack, rescuing the 9th Company survivors but are forced to withdraw. The 7th and 9th Company soldiers tend their wounded and eat frozen canned food, while Qianli counts the dead. U.S. bombers attack the area with minimal effect. A 9th Company soldier recounts their attack on the bridge which caused slight damage. The U.S. forces repair the bridge and their defensive positions. The 7th and 9th Companies plan a new attack, the 9th Company commander says that they must destroy the bridge and then dies from an earlier wound.\nU.S. forces at the bridge inventory their weapons while armored reinforcements proceed toward the bridge. The U.S. commander, a Captain plans to draw the PVA onto the south end of the bridge and then destroy them. Qianli briefs both companies on the plan to attack the bridge from four different directions. Qianli tells Wanli to run free showing that he has earned his trust. The companies salute the sun looking north towards China and recite \"Long live the People's Republic of China\" before splitting up for the attack.\nThe four groups deploy unseen in the dark. A U.S. sniper shoots a PVA messenger and in turn is shot by a PVA sniper who also shoots out a searchlight on the north end of the bridge. Wanli throws a grenade which blows up the U.S. communications bunker starting the attack. A U.S. watchtower on the south end of the bridge is destroyed by a bazooka shot. The U.S. defenders go on full alert, but still plan to trap the PVA attackers. PVA forces blow a hole in a water pipe below the bridge and then fire a bazooka up the pipe causing an explosion at the pump house behind the bridge. Three PVA soldiers run up the pipe and take over the pump house, setting off explosions that kill U.S. soldiers who arrive to investigate. More PVA soldiers run up inside the pipe and more U.S soldiers enter the pump house, one of the U.S. soldiers throws a grenade down the pipe and a PVA soldier jumps on it and absorbs the blast. Another bazooka round is fired up the pipe killing more U.S. soldiers. A PVA soldier shoots out the lights in the pump house and more Americans are killed then more PVA soldiers emerge from the pipe. North of the bridge Qianli launches a solo attack, when the Americans try to shoot him with a recoilless rifle they hit their headquarters bunker. The Americans leave the HQ bunker after setting a demolition charges, Qianli stops more than ten unarmed U.S. troops, the demolition charge detonates and the Americans scatter while Qianli searches the bunker to try to capture the U.S. commander. PVA and U.S. soldiers fight for control of the pump house while PVA mortars destroy the U.S. ammunition storage areas. PVA forces overrun the U.S. positions on the north end of the bridge, while on the south end they spring their trap on the PVA attackers. Wanli blows up a machine gun position with a grenade, Yu Congrong pushes him out of the way of a sniper who shoots Yu, apparently killing him. The U.S. armored column approaches the north end of the bridge and a tank fires on the PVA who respond with mortar fire and an uphill infantry attack. Wanli, having moved through the U.S. trenches, tries to grenade a U.S. position but is stopped by the U.S. commander, they wrestle and the captain prevails until Qianli arrives and puts a gun to the captain's head, Wanli then puts the primed grenade inside the captain's jacket and it explodes killing him. The U.S. defenders at the north end of the bridge fire on the PVA with flamethrowers, killing several soldiers one of whom keeps firing until he burns to death. The PVA use mortars as bazookas and shoot a gas can causing petrol to spread on the ground, when the flamethrowers fire again they ignite the petrol killing many U.S. soldiers. The PVA soldiers in the pump house kill American soldiers on the roof. Wanli and Qianli rescue Yu who was concussed. A U.S. tanks advances across the bridge, the PVA troops at the south end try to destroy it with a captured recoilless rifle. Qianli launches a solo attack on the U.S. troops on and around the pump house, tackling a U.S. soldier on the roof and then falling inside. A PVA soldier runs from the pump house towards the tank carrying a satchel charge, he is repeatedly shot and the charge explodes disintegrating him. Inside the pump house Ping He is attacked by a U.S. soldier who impales him on a metal beam, but Qianli then garrots the American but is entangled in wreckage. Ping He takes another satchel charge and dives underneath the tank, his arm is crushed and he is dragged under the tank, he tells Qianli to fire and he does so igniting the satchel charge, destroying the tank and blowing a hole in the bridge. The PVA units advance on the bridge destroying the final U.S. positions, while Qianli is trapped in the pump house wreckage. Renewed tank fire disintegrates a PVA soldier as the vanguard of the 1st Marine Division approaches the north end of the bridge and then proceed to bombard the area. Qianli uses a signal whistle to order a retreat and the PVA withdraw. Wanli tries to rescue Qianli who tells him to leave, but he and another soldier extract Qianli and they escape down the pipe.\nThe next morning some surviving 7th and 9th Company soldiers sleep in a valley near the bridge. Yu climbs a hill for a better radio signal when a flight of F4U Corsairs approaches the valley. The Corsairs drops napalm which falls short as Yu has fired on the planes drawing their attention to him, the planes follow Yu dropping more napalm and he is set alight and disintegrates in the fire. The planes return and strafe the valley pulverising several PVA soldiers and wounding many others, including Wanli. At the bridge the Marines repair the bridge and their fighting positions as they prepare to hold the bridge for three days to allow their forces to retreat across it. Below the bridge more PVA survivors strip the destroyed U.S. tank for supplies. The scene then ships to the Sea of Japan where a voiceover says that the 1st Marine Division is facing a major test. The scene then shifts to MacArthur in Tokyo who is informed of the damage to the Sumun Bridge, MacArthur says that he told Smith not to retreat, he is told that his atomic bomb plan caused controversy in the UN and he orders the Sumun Bridge be repaired.\nThe PVA then put a captured U.S. M3 half-track back into service, while in a voiceover Qianli pledges to attack the bridge no matter how many times the U.S. repairs it. The wounded Mei Sheng is seen in a flashback with his wife where she tells him to come back alive. Qianli gives his commander's whistle to Wanli. Night falls and the U.S. forces at the bridge scan the area. In a voiceover Qianli orders Wanli to blow the whistle every three hours from either end of the bridge to distract the defenders. Qianli wraps himself in a parachute and approaches the bridge from the north. Meanwhile the U.S. commander orders that music is played over the bridge loudspeakers causing the defenders to relax. The 9th Company then attacks the bridge while above the bridge Mei sets the cargo in the half-track alight and drives it down towards the bridge as Qianli slides down the hill. Wanli tries to enter the pipe but finds it barricaded with barbed wire. The U.S. defenders fire on the half-track killing Mei but it explodes on the bridge. Qianli slides over U.S. positions and lands on the pump house roof, he slides off the roof and onto the bridge where he is surrounded by many U.S. soldiers who take no action because it would be \"more exciting.\" Qianli tries to shoot an artillery shell he was carrying, but his pistol misfires, the Americans open fire, Qianli is hit numerous times and falls off the bridge but manages to shoot the shell's fuse causing a massive explosion that blows a hole in the bridge. Wanli recovers Qianli who dies in front of him. Wanli recalls Qianli's instruction to him to run free.\nAt dawn Wanli is frozen to Qianli's body. The Americans patrol the area around the bridge, seeing Qianli's head they fire a flamethrower and his body is consumed in flames causing his body and Wanli to slide down the hill. The flamethrower operator reports that there are no more PVA below the bridge and the U.S. commander says its time to go home. Wanli regains consciousness from the heat of Qianli's burning body. Wanli looks up to see U.S. helicopters flying in bridge spans while a voiceover narrates how U.S. aircraft flew in spans to repair the bridge. The U.S. troops lay the bridge spans and vehicles begin crossing over the bridge. Smith crosses the bridge in a jeeep and sees a red scarf in a tree which he takes as a sign that the U.S. doesn't have much time to pull out. Truman is shown looking pensive in the Oval office. The scene then shifts to the evacuation of Hungnam on 24 December where U.S. forces described as the \"10th Army\" prepare to destroy rail lines and supplies that cannot be evacuated. A U.S. soldier is shown putting a bottle of whisky into the body bag of a dead soldier. Captions state: \"The Battle of the Sumun Bridge was a typical penetrating attack into the depths of the U.S. defense. It had significant importance in cutting off the enemy's retreat, crashing the enemy's morale, and accelerating the course of the battle. This battle demonstrated our army's indomitable spirit in battle and the powerful will of Chinese people to defend Chinese nation's dignity!\" Smith is shown paying his respects at a huge graveyard overlooking Hungnam.\nThe PVA are shown quick marching past the bridge towards Hungnam, Wanli fires his carbine to draw their attention and is recognised as being from the 7th Company. At Hungnam demolition charges explode across the city as glum and wounded American troops look on from ships as they sail away. The PVA, including Wanli, are shown triumphantly running into the ruins of Hungnam on 25 December, reaching the beach where they wave red flags and cheer. Four jeeps containing PVA officers stop on a mountaintop. Song looks out over Lake Changjin, removes his cap and bows while other officers salute. Wanli takes a handful of dirt and wraps it in fabric. In a rear area PVA company commanders report their losses, among the artillery battalion only 107 out of 221 report for duty, while Wanli reports that of the 157 soldiers in the 7th Company only one reports for duty. Song stops and stares solemnly at Wanli and orders that a flag be brought. Song asks Wanli if he wishes for anything, Wanli replies that he wants to restore the 7th Company. Song presents Wanli with a flag and salutes him. The flag is then shown flying as Wanli holds an urn containing Qianli's ashes. Wanli imagines Qianli asking him about skipping stones across water.

Meredith speeds away but crashes into a tree, stranding them.\nMartin radios Nate on a walkie-talkie, warning him to stay away, saying the lion is using Martin as bait to lure the others out.

She fails to recognise her husband Biswanath, and has forgotten everything about her marital life except her 3 daughters - Malasree, Kaberi and Piu, and her son Barin. She recognises Bijon (Malasree's husband) and Sharmistha (Barin's wife), and remembers the existence of Jyotirmay (Kaberi's husband) and Palash (Piu's husband), but is unable to recognise them. Because of Arati's decreased tolerance to noise, Biswanath moves her from Kolkata to Santiniketan. In spite of his own advanced age, Biswanath single-handedly takes care of Arati, refusing to hand over her responsibility to their children or to any nurse. Biswanath states that he wants to take care of Arati alone without anyone's help as penitence for his inability to devote time for her during their married life. In spite of his efforts, Arati is completely unable to recognise Biswanath as her husband (who, she believes, has abandoned her), and regards him with contempt for violating her privacy. She often sneaks out of the house & roams around the village in her quest to return to her native village in Faridpur and meet her childhood friend Atindra. In an attempt to help Arati regain her memory, Biswanath decides to take Arati to her native village. They are accompanied by Malasree, Bijon, Piu, Palash, and Jyotirmay. At Faridpur, they meet Atindra and try to reconnect Arati with her childhood memories. Arati becomes visibly happier and starts to recall the day of her marriage. She recalls her husband's name, but still fails to recognise him. In a last attempt to help Arati recollect her memories about Biswanath, her family recreates the day of her marriage, complete with all the necessary customs, which she gladly recognises. Although Arati's contempt for Biswanath had gone after the re-enactment of her marriage, she is still unable to recognise him as her husband. Biswanath finally gives up all hopes of Arati ever recognising him as her husband, but continues to take care of her.\nParallel to Biswanath & Arati's story, the film shows the story of their children & their spouses. Barin (who was his father's assistant in his publishing house in Belaseshe) is now a successful businessman who runs his own publishing house in Kolkata. He had been apprehensive about Sharmistha (who was portrayed as a middle-scale cloth merchant) outshining him professionally. This has now culminated in Sharmistha divorcing Barin. Sharmistha has shifted to Mumbai with her son & daughter, where she runs a large boutique frequented by big names of Bollywood, and is considering marrying her colleague Kunal Bharadwaj. Arati doesn't remember Barin's divorce, and keeps asking him about Sharmistha. In an attempt to help Arati recover her memories, Barin personally requests Sharmistha to visit Arati. Sharmistha initially declines but later she visits Barin & his family at Shantiniketan after they had returned from Faridpur. Here, Barin apologies to Sharmistha for not allowing her to work freely during their married life & accepts her to be more talented than him. As a result, love is rekindled between them & Sharmistha refuses to go back to Mumbai.\nBijon & Malasree haven't produced children in spite of being apparently happily married for many years. Malasree is pressured by her family to consult a doctor, but refuses. Later she reveals to Biswanath that Bijon is gay, was forced by his family to marry her for the sake of appearance. Biswanath urges Malasree to divorce Bijon, but she retorts that Biswanath himself has proved by his dedication to the now intellectually-disabled Arati that married life isn't centred exclusively around children. She states that both she & Bijon had tried to end the marriage by indulging in extra-marital affairs but failed to do so because they found solace in each other's companionship. Malasree believes that their friendship transcends physical desire, and Bijon would prove to be as faithful and devoted as Biswanath if she ever became like Arati.Palash has abandoned his position as a director in Bollywood, and works as a TV actor in Mumbai. Piu, too, left the film industry to work as a designer, but then stopped working because she wants to bear children and enjoy motherhood. However, their attempts in this regard have not yet borne fruit, and Palash has become too busy with his work to devote time to Piu. Piu was becoming frustrated with her married life, but when she finds Biswanath regretful for not having spent enough time with Arati, she decides not to repeat the same mistake with Palash. It turns out that Palash is stressed by severe competition among small actors to remain relevant in the television industry, and is suffering from oligospermia. He is initially reluctant to accompany Piu to Shantiniketan, but is eventually persuaded by Arati's repeated insistence to see him. At Shantiniketan he is able to reconnect with Piu. On the eve of the family's departure for Faridpur, Palash takes the monumental decision to pull out of the television industry and spend more time with his wife.

A lieutenant drives her to the base through a dangerous neighborhood and strands her there. Edh is attacked by refugees, and manages to fight her way out. Upon arriving at the base, she is taken for a briefing with Colonel Raad and she meets the other soldiers recruited for the special mission: Karimi, Malik, Granvik, \nand Captain Forsberg. \nThe Colonel explains that the team must cross the ice-covered Stockholm Archipelago on skates and deliver some canisters to a research base, named \u00d6d\u00f6, which he says could lead to victory in the war. The team will skate across the ice, as it is too thin for vehicles. Edh points out that this appears to be a suicide mission, but she is given a reason to try to make it: the chance to be reunited with Vanja, who has been found in a refugee camp.\nThe team leaves as the base is attacked the next day, and is joined by the lieutenant who abandoned Edh earlier, Nylund. Before they can be properly briefed on the mission, Forsberg falls through the thin ice and drowns. Edh jumps in after her, saving the two packages from Forsberg\u2019s backpack but leaving her body behind.\nThe group takes Edh to a house on land, where they warm her and themselves by a fire and Nylund is selected to be their new commander, according to the chain of command. This gets some pushback from Edh as she wonders whose place he took on the mission, as he was a last-minute substitute for an unnamed missing person. \nThe following morning, Edh hears the thrum of rotors and she catches Karimi using the radio. The helicopter fires a missile into the house as the team escapes, leading to the suspicion that Karimi is a traitor.

He shoots himself in the head. \nAfter spotting lights on the ice, which could be enemy forces, Edh leaves alone to continue the mission with the vials. She comes across dangerously thin ice and attempts to skate across, but it cracks and leaves her stranded. Granvik and Nylund rescue her with a rope before all three attempt to cross. Granvik shoots a lone machine gunner in a pillbox on a rocky hill overlooking the ice, before the trio comes across the latter's comrades, frozen to death. \nGranvik recounts why he enlisted in the military: after being forced by the enemy to dig a mass grave with his childhood friend, he fell in as his friend was shot and the enemy soldiers did not realize he was still alive. Forced to push his way out from under the corpses, he witnessed them being eaten by rats and enlisted soon after. \nThe next morning, awoken by memories of her daughter, Edh realises Nylund has run off with the capsules.

On the tape, he recounts the story of Maren's first cannibalistic episode, when she killed her babysitter at the age of three. As similar incidents continued to occur over the years, although Frank helped his daughter evade consequences, he grew increasingly anguished over her apparent lack of remorse. He concludes with the hope that she will someday learn to overcome her urges.\nMaren decides to head to Minnesota, which is listed as the birth place of her mother, Janelle, who left her and Frank when Maren was only a baby.

As they embark on a cross-country road trip, the two fall in love. During a brief stay in Lee's hometown in Kentucky, Maren notices his unwillingness to discuss certain aspects of his past, such as his father's absence and the reason why Lee avoids being spotted around town.

Having turned down appearing in the fifth film in favor of doing the aforementioned panned role, Carol initially fears that her former Cliff Beasts castmates may still hold a grudge against her.\nOne of the first major film productions to resume amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Cliff Beasts cast arrive at a swanky English hotel and must self-quarantine for two weeks. During this time, they go stir-crazy, stuck in their rooms. Afterwards, a welcome back party is organized for the cast and crew. Here, Carol happily reunites with co-stars Dustin, Howie and Sean but has an awkward meeting with Lauren, the only Cliff Beasts co-star appearing bitter about her absence. There are two series newcomers, Dieter, a respected, but indifferent veteran actor, and Krystal, a young TikTok sensation to attract a younger demographic. The latter quickly bonds with Carla, a deadpan on-set production assistant who's her age. Director Darren Eigan, an enthusiastic, but frazzled indie filmmaker, tries to boost morale and make the shoot special, coming off as pretentious. He clashes with leading man Dustin, who constantly bombards him with revised versions of the script to fit his own vision. Dieter has a crush on Anika, the hotel's sweet front desk clerk, hitting on her. She\u2019s interested but wants to build a proper relationship first before jumping into sex.\nShooting begins and for the first few days, everything appears to be okay. The cast starts pre-production training, including Sean humorously learning how to fly a helicopter up and down. However, a series of events delay the production even more. During a group meditation session, Howie becomes paranoid and quits the film in a panic. In response to this, Howie's Cliff Beasts character is killed off gruesomely. Bored in the hotel, Krystal and Carla sneak out to party in the city. This gains traction online and gets Krystal cancelled for her behavior, losing many of her followers. Later the cast tests positive for influenza, linked to a delivery girl who had given them all their morning coffees. Despite being ill, the studio forces them to film, leading to the cast projectile vomiting during an intense shoot. They are told to self-quarantine yet again.

She begins a fling with him until he reveals he's married and has multiple girlfriends and mistresses. When the shoot starts back up again, Carol realizes that most of her character's dialogue and actions have either been given to Krystal or omitted entirely. Humiliated after shooting a scene where Dr. Lacey urinates in fear, she suspects this is how the studio is getting back at her for leaving the franchise. Carol has a heart-to-heart with Darren, telling him of her concerns, but when he talks to the higher-ups about giving back her dialogue it backfires.\nLauren tries to escape from the hotel in a frenzy one night. Mr. Best's men graphically shoot one of her hands off, leaving her in the hospital for the remainder of the shoot. Mr. Best claims that his men thought she was a crazed fan that had wandered onto the premises, but the cast theorizes that he himself is there so they complete the movie by any means necessary. Infuriated, Carol tries to rally together her castmates and fight for their rights. One night, the remaining cast bond over drugs and the grievances they've been having with the shoot and with themselves.

This event inspires Carol, noticing the cast\u2019s long-forgotten effective teamwork. The reinvigorated friendship is strong and they plan a getaway. As they shoot the climax, Dustin creates a distraction by clashing with Darren about the script revisions while the rest of the cast leave the set and try to avoid getting caught by Mr. Best and his men.\nCarla reveals she was a studio mole put in place to befriend Krystal and spy on the cast, leading to a live-streamed fistfight between them.

At Kyoto, Ladybug gives the White Death the briefcase. The Prince, revealed to be the White Death's daughter, fails to goad him into shooting her with the rigged gun. The White Death explains that everyone on the train was linked to the death of his wife. He hired them hoping they would kill each other, not knowing Carver (his wife's killer) was replaced by Ladybug. The White Death's henchmen open the briefcase, which explodes, knocking Ladybug and the White Death back onto the train.

They discuss a particular case known as the Basket Killings which was successfully investigated by senior CBI officer Sethurama Iyer who is now posted at the CBI Headquarters, Delhi. \nThe case takes place in October 2012 when Home Minister of Kerala state Abdul Samad dies en route to Kerala from Delhi. Many believe his death to be natural circumstances, but some find it mysterious. The suspicions escalate when Samad's personal doctor is also found dead under mysterious circumstances. Protests take place asking the government to order an investigation on the death of Abdul Samad. A journalist named Bhasuran heads these protests and the next day he is found murdered by hanging. A cop named Josemon is also found to be murdered the next day. The police understand that he was murdered by a car that hit and ran over him. The police come to the conclusion that these murders are related and names them the Basket Killings. \nThe case is handed over to DYSP Sathyadas, who is the son of former DYSP Devadas; a corrupt cop and also hates the CBI, particularly Iyer, but the I.G K.C Unnithan is against handing over the case to Sathyadas, citing his corruption. Unnithan shares these concerns with the state police DGP, but he rejects his plea and asks him to wait. Sathyadas finally concludes that the murder of Josemon is linked to a sand trafficker named Sam. Out of suspicion, he takes Sam under custody. Meanwhile, a petition has been moved on court to hand over the case to CBI by Josemon's family. The case is headed by Sathyadas' wife Adv. Pratibha, who seems to have her own reasons for encouraging the petition. \nAt the same time the CBI had also given a workload petition in the court.

So Balagopal meets Sethurama Iyer at CBI Headquarters in New Delhi and they later meet the CBI Director who decides to withdraw the workload petition. The case is eventually handed over to the CBI and Iyer is called upon by the Kerala Government and his associates at the CBI office in Kerala. Iyer reveals that Abdul Samad and the C.M had come to visit him to talk about a youth named Mansoor who was a relative of Samad and that he had joined a militant group some years ago.\nThey focus on Sam and learn that Adv. Pratibha and Sam are acquainted. They question her and she proves that she has no involvement in the killings. They find Sam dead in a remote place after his escape from a hospital earlier while he was under custody. The CBI suspect his death is also a murder, but it is revealed in the forensic reports that his death was due to heart attack. They decide to search Bhasuran's house and they also question his friend. They find evidence that the killer might be a person named Mansoor, and Iyer and his team suspect the involvement of the same Mansoor that was Samad's relative. They also heard this name before from the murdered doctor's wife and his driver as well. During the search Vinay finds a portrait that resembles one of the people he saw in the Delhi Airport CCTV recordings, and learn that his name is Sandeep and that he is linked to DYSP Vikram, a CBI official who is the victim of a murder attempt. Iyer and his team pay him a visit along with DYSP Chacko, a long-time friend of both Iyer and Vikram. \nIyer learns from Vikram that Sandeep's actual name is Paul Meyjo. Later they find Meyjo at a private space near a beach. While questioning him they find many designs to a pacemaker and notes describing how to hack a pacemaker. They ask Paul about this and he tells them that he made those to prove his friend, Dr. Venu's claim that a person cannot externally hack a pacemaker. They are forced to release Meyjo due to a lack of evidence. Later, Sathyadas comes to meet Iyer to share with him that he had seen lights coming out of Sam's guesthouse, which was supposedly empty. Iyer decides to investigate and finds that someone was indeed there. Iyer conjectures that murder of Minister Samad was an accident, and the original intended victim had been Susan George, a patient of the late Dr. Venu and also the wife of a renowned doctor, Dr. George Abraham. She is visited by a disguised Meyjo not long before the CBI infiltrate the house to save her. \nMeyjo tries to flee, before being arrested, and interrogated. They find an article ripped from a newspaper in his bible, which contained a photo to identify Susan. Iyer stays behind to question Susan. Susan was previously named Ambika Mohan and married to Unnithan. It is revealed that Meyjo was indeed the one who killed Abdul Samad on the orders of Sam and Unnithan. Unnithan had acute schizophrenia and abused his wife, so she left him, but he resolved to eliminate her. After the accidental murder of Samad, Sam and Meyjo decided to kill Dr. Venu as he had grown suspicious of Meyjo. They then killed Bhasuran for organising protests to find the real murderers of Samad's murder. Josemon, who was jogging at that time,  passed through the front gates of Sam's guesthouse to find Unnithan and Sam colluding. \nThe very next day, Sam was ordered by Unnithan to kill Josemon and he in turn instructed Meyjo. He did so by hitting and running his vehicle over Josemon. Iyer visits Unnithan, who boasts that Iyer will never be able to prove that he was the one who ordered Meyjo to commit the murder. Iyer is initially stumped, then suddenly figures out that the newspaper from which Meyjo got the target's photo would be in Unnithan's house. He finds it, and now has physical proof that Unnithan and Meyjo met and discussed plans to kill Susan. Unnithan is arrested, and later died of a heart attack during the trial. Sometime later, Iyer goes to the prison and happens to encounter Meyjo in his cell. Meyjo warns him that Iyer is his next target.

L\u00e9o's family also helps run agricultural work at a flower farm, where L\u00e9o and R\u00e9mi also like to play together.\nAfter a carefree summer together, the two boys start high school and find themselves in the same class. A trio of female classmates openly ask if the two are a couple. L\u00e9o vehemently denies it, while R\u00e9mi doesn't comment on it. L\u00e9o becomes uneasy with this external perception, with instances of homophobic slurs directed towards him by boys who notice their intimacy. Wanting to avoid being ostracized, he begins new friendships and takes up ice hockey, from which he deliberately excludes R\u00e9mi. One night, while sleeping over at R\u00e9mi's, L\u00e9o decides to sleep on a separate mattress. Upon waking up, he finds R\u00e9mi sleeping on the same mattress as him. The two wrestle, starting off playfully but becoming increasingly rough, leaving R\u00e9mi hurt and confused.

L\u00e9o unsuccessfully tries to suppress his inner pain and cover it up by continuing to do ice hockey and gardening work with his family.

Most significant among these changes is the disappearance of physical pain and infectious disease for an overwhelming majority (allowing for surgery to be safely performed on conscious people in ordinary settings), but other humans experience more radical alterations to their physiology.

Tenser suffers from \"accelerated evolution syndrome\", a disorder that causes him daily torment, anxiety and digestive issues, as his body constantly develops completely new cancerous organs. They have become celebrities of the flesh, by surgically removing them before a live audience. The ongoing treatments for the syndrome, which they\u2019ve transmuted into an artistic lifestyle, leaves Tenser in constant pain and with severe respiratory and digestive discomfort; he is consequently reliant on several specialized biomechanical devices, including a bed, a machine through which Caprice performs surgery on him, and a chair that twitches and rotates as it assists him with eating.

Without telling Caprice, Tenser meets a series of contacts through other biological performance art shows that lead him to the evolutionist cell. One of them, former cosmetic surgeon Nasatir, creates a zippered cavern in Tenser's stomach, which Caprice uses to access Tenser's organs in an oral sex act where she fellates his zipper wound and presumably his internal organs while he moans in erotic pleasure. Caprice continues to network with other performance artists, eventually choosing to receive decorative cosmetic surgery on her forehead.\nTenser meets with Timlin, who reveals to him the agenda of the evolutionists: they have chosen to surgically redesign the cancerous organs common in their digestive system, that have been appearing in others like Saul, to make them able to eat plastics and other synthetic chemicals, claiming they are simply completing the evolution that has already started in humanity, presuming it\u2019s purpose: a new strain of human that can evolve into being that can subsist off toxic industrial waste, to survive the man made environmental destruction of the Earth. Their principal food is a purple processed \"candy bar\" of toxic waste, fatally poisonous to others, causing the death of a cell member who was a government informant pretending to have had the surgeries. Lang is the leader of the cell; his son Brecken had been born with the ability to eat plastic, proving the inaccuracy of the government's critical stance on human evolution, and being the first natural example of humankind\u2019s evolution into another species of man. Timlin tries to initiate sex with Tenser, but he says he is not good at \"the old sex\". Tenser begins to question his values, with the arrival of his cancerous new organs becoming more frequent, and his partner worrying that if he stops removing them he will simply succumb to \u201cdesigner cancer\u201d.\nTenser is eventually approached by Lang, who wants Tenser and Caprice to reveal the cell's anti-government agenda through a public autopsy of Brecken that will highlight his evolved digestive system. After some deliberation, Tenser agrees. With Timlin, Lang, and many others watching, Tenser performs the autopsy, but it is revealed that Brecken's natural organ system has been surgically replaced. Lang flees the show in tears. Outside, he is approached by two government agents who supposedly used as cover work for the corporation that manufactures Tenser's biomedical machines. Mimicking their earlier killing of Nasatir, they assassinate Lang by driving power drills into his head. Tenser's connection within the police unit admits that Timlin replaced Brecken's organs to keep the deviation in human evolution secret from the public. Saddened by Brecken and Lang's deaths, Tenser informs the police that he will no longer serve them, approvingly mentioning the cell's beliefs on evolution.\nTenser struggles to eat in his chair, having spent weeks deciding not to remove his new cancerous organs. He asks Caprice to give him a bar of plastic, to test if he\u2019s a new human like Lang\u2019s deceased son. As Caprice records him, he eats it, looks into Caprice's camera, and sheds a tear. His mouth twitches into a smile as the chair finally quiets, with an ambigious ending leaving her audience to decide if he died in peace, freed of his lifelong suffering, or nourished by the toxic food made of industrial waste, awakening as mankind\u2019s next new human species.", "tmdb_id": 819876}, "70655659": {"title": "Crush (2022 film)", "plot": "Paige Evans is a student at Miller High School who has a passion for art and hopes to study at a summer program at her dream school, CalArts.

Subsequent occupants of the house died mysteriously and the place was eventually abandoned. Shawn speculates that the various deaths over the years were Mildred trying to build a family she was unable to have in life.

He discovers the incantation that Mildred used to gain her satanic powers, and the phrase repeated by the ghostly voices is actually in one of the poems. Putting the pieces together, he realizes Mildred never wanted a family, but an audience for her poetry. He becomes inspired to complete the ritual to circumvent her power through his own audience and send her back to hell. \nShawn arms himself, returns to the house to challenge Mildred.

Officer Sango explains to Knight that this kind of heist is taking place all over the country, and there is one plane seen in every city the theft has taken place in. He also says that the aircraft belongs to Winna, the owner of a New York-based shell company. From this intel, Knight states that he knows Winna and that he is originally a bookie.\nIn New York City, Casey's wife tells him that he is not the same person he used to be, while also expressing concerns about his drug abuse.

He talks with the investigative officer during the time of the murder 16 years back and starts checking with other police stations in the state for robberies with similar modus operandi. One day he receives a call from his batchmate posted at Coimbatore telling him that she came across a similar robbery at Kumbakonam and gave him the details of the accused. To go there personally and check himself, Varadhan sets off with Pavithra, only to find his car parked outside the station stolen. They find the carjacker to be a habitual offender Satya from CCTV records and rushes to find him. Then find the carjackers hideout with phone records and recovers the car but finds Sathya to have escaped from there with the car belongings including Varadhan's service gun. Desperate to recover it and reach Coimbatore, both starts travelling down the ghats in the police jeep.\nParallelly in the midnight the last bus from Ooty starts towards Coimbatore with a few passengers. A set of robbers who murder another couple in Ooty boards the bus with the loot along with some other people. Among the passengers are also a young lover pair who have eloped and on the run from the girl's father Gunasekaran, the local MLA. They share their plight with other passengers and reveal that when Gunasekaran came to know about their affair he murders the boy's father and is planning to kill them too. They have been on the run ever since with the jewels taken from her house for their better future. A group of tribal people who board the bus and other families make the bus stop midway at a temple and get them married to make them safer. The robbers on the run meanwhile have their eye on the jewelry bag and plan to nab it as well. One of the passengers of the bus, a young man travelling to meet his lover and elope with her before her planned marriage and another old lady start feeling the presence of supernatural elements in the bus. When the bus stops for the marriage, they run off and meet Varadhan and Pavithra. Varadhan continues behind the bus with the man in a bike to reach Coimbatore while Pavithra keeps with her search for Satya.\nOnce Varadhan boards the bus, he accidentally finds Satya who had boarded the bus from another stop and recovers his gun after thrashing him. After a while Varadhan also starts experiencing something eerie in the bus. He checks the IDs of conductor and driver and passes on the bus number to Pavithra to do a background check. He overpowers the robbers who were trying to rob the gold from runaway couples and ties them up. Having known of the murder they committed at Ooty, he alerts the station to check all hotels near the vicinity for the victims and the police start a detailed raid of all hotels to find the murdered couple. Pavithra goes to Ooty bus stand and finds out to her horror that the bus number Varadhan shared does not exist at all and the last bus which left Ooty station by 11 PM has already reached Coimbatore. Alarmed she alerts Varadhan of the strange turn of events. Gunasekaran's henchmen find the tribal people who have got off at their destination on the way and runs them over after learning that they helped the couple get married, upon Gunasekaran's orders. After some time, they catch up with the bus, find the lovers and starts attacking the passengers at the behest of their boss, who is furious that they let his daughter be married off and wants all of them killed.\nDuring the fight the driver is injured fatally and crashes another car which was shown during the movie prologue. The bus crashes into the gorge from the 13th hairpin bend, the only survivors being Varadhan, the young man who travelled with him and couple of other passengers. A search party starts searching the lake below for the drowned bus as per the locations pointed by Varadhan but does not find anything for long. At last, they find the remains of a bus, but what they find is a very old bus with lot of human skeletons inside. It is revealed that what they unearthed was the remains of the bus which crashed 16 years ago, and skeletons belonged to all the passengers who were travelling in it that time. Varadhan infers that the bus that he got into was the same supernatural copy of the crashed bus and the dead passengers travelling inside that same bus as ghosts. It is shown that the murder shown to have been committed by the robbers is the same one which Varadhan is investigating now, and the reason police could not find bodies during the hotel raid was that the incident happened 16 years ago only and it was the robbers\u2019 ghosts whom Varadhan has run into now. He explains this to Pavithra citing the Bus 375 urban legend. They travel to the transport department to confirm that the number plate Varadhan gave to Pavithra was the exact number plate of the missing bus from 16 years ago and the conductor and driver credentials also matched with the same. Varadhan and Pavithra deduce that the bus with drowned passengers undertake the journey periodically as ghosts and whoever gets into the bus and leaves before the 13th hairpin bend survives every time. Based on the experience they confront Gunasekaran and have him arrested with circumstantial evidence for the crimes he committed 16 years back.\nDuring the epilogue, Varadhan, after solving the case successfully, visits the church priest who was his guardian at the foster home. He learns that the car shown at the epilogue, and which got into an accident with the bus was driven by his father, with him and his mother inside. After his parents die during the accident at 13th hairpin bend, the priest finds him and takes him in. 4 years later, Varadhan is married to Pavitra and while reminiscing the incident they find out that since the accident happened on 29 February which is a leap year and it was on a Feb 29th 4 years back that they also got into the bus, the bus travels the same route with the ghosts every 4 years. Varadhan goes to the bus stand at midnight to confirm these deductions and finds Satya boarding the bus to see his mother again, whom he lost years back during the accident, when he was still a little boy.", "tmdb_id": 807598}, "73021274": {"title": "Diary of a Spy", "plot": "Anna (Tamara Taylor) is a disgraced spy: after living in Saudi Arabia for several years, all other members of her cell have been killed, and the blame (deserved or not) has fallen on her.

The two escape with help from the Earth-838 version of Strange's ex-fianc\u00e9, Christine Palmer, a scientist working with the Illuminati.\nStrange, Chavez, and Palmer enter the space between universes to find the Book of Vishanti, which is the antithesis of the Darkhold, but Maximoff appears and destroys it. She then takes over Chavez's mind, using her powers to send the others to an incursion-destroyed universe.

With Wong's help, Strange saves Chavez from Maximoff as she tries to take Chavez's powers and encourages Chavez to use her abilities. She transports Maximoff to Earth-838, where she sees Billy and Tommy recoil from her in fear while crying for their real mother. Realizing the error of her ways, Maximoff relents and uses her powers to bring down Mount Wundagore, simultaneously destroying all copies of the Darkhold throughout the multiverse and apparently sacrificing herself in the process. Chavez returns Strange and Palmer to their respective universes.\nSometime later, Kamar-Taj is under repair and the surviving sorcerers, joined by Chavez, continue training.

However, after he moves with his parents to Memphis, his peers ridicule him due to his fascination with the African-American music of Memphis's Beale Street. Parker, at the time a carnival \"huckster\" who fancies himself a modern-day P. T. Barnum, is partnered with country singer Hank Snow, but realizes Presley's crossover potential as a talented musician with intense sex appeal when he hears him \"sounding black\" on \"That's All Right.\" That night, after seeing him at a \"Louisiana Hayride\" performance, Parker meets with and persuades Presley to let him take control of his career, beginning a meteoric ascent that sees the Presley family lifted out of poverty. \nThe regional public is divided in their view of the singer. Feeling that Presley's music will corrupt white children and stoke racial hostility, the segregationist Southern Democrat Mississippi Senator James Eastland calls Parker to an informal hearing and questions him about his mysterious past.

During his military service in West Germany, Presley is devastated by his mother's alcoholism-induced death, but meeting Priscilla Beaulieu, the teenage daughter of a United States Air Force pilot, comforts him. After his discharge, he resumes his film career and later marries Priscilla.\nAs the popular culture of the 1960s passes Presley by, the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F.

Burt is offered a new job in Phoenix, Arizona, and he and the family move there in early 1957; at Mitzi's insistence, Burt's best friend and business partner Bennie Loewy goes too.\nYears later, teenaged Sammy continues making films with his friends in the Boy Scouts, during which he begins utilizing post-production effects and subsequently earns a badge in photography. Later, the Fabelmans, including Bennie, take a camping trip with Sammy capturing footage of their vacation. \nShortly afterwards, Mitzi's mother dies, leaving her especially distraught. Providing him with film editing equipment, Burt suggests Sammy turn the camping trip footage into a film to cheer Mitzi up. Sammy objects over the scheduling of his next film, but Burt, who sees his passion for film as simply a hobby, argues that the home movie is more important.\nThe next morning, the Fabelmans receive a surprise visit from Mitzi's uncle Boris, a former lion tamer and film worker. That night, he speaks with Sammy about compromising his family with art, telling him that both aspects will continue to be at odds with one another. After Boris leaves, Sammy begins editing the camping trip footage, during which he finds evidence of Mitzi and Bennie having an affair. \nAfter weeks of harsh treatment towards her and Bennie, Sammy and Mitzi get into a heated argument. In a fit of rage, she slaps him across the back, forcing a distraught Sammy to show her the compiled footage. He promises to keep their secret.\nThe following week, Burt receives another work promotion, requiring another move to Saratoga, California. To keep the marriage intact, Bennie stays in Phoenix, but not before gifting Sammy a new film camera. Sammy refuses the camera until Bennie lets him pay $35 for it. Despite purchasing the camera, Sammy announces he will never use it.\nSoon after arriving in his new neighborhood and school, Sammy becomes targeted by students Logan and Chad, who levy anti-Semitic abuse toward him. He also begins dating the devoutly Christian Monica. While having dinner with the Fabelmans, she suggests that Sammy film their Ditch Day at the beach, something he considers and eventually accepts after Monica tells him her father owns a 16mm Arriflex camera that he would let him use.\nAfter finally moving from a rental to their newly purchased home, Mitzi and Burt announce their divorce due to her extreme depression and his discovery of the affair. This leaves the family heartbroken.\nAt prom, Sammy declares his love for Monica and asks her to come with him to Hollywood after high school. Unable to throw away her own life's plans to attend Texas A&M University, she breaks up with him, leaving him despondent. \nThe Ditch Day film is played in front of Sammy's peers to a rapturous response. It glorifies Logan and vilifies Chad. When Logan confronts Sammy, confused over his positive portrayal, they reach an understanding, cemented when Logan fights Chad off when he tries to attack Sammy. The next morning, Mitzi and Sammy talk about their future together; just as she cannot give up her love for Bennie, she tells Sammy not to give up his love for filmmaking.\nThe following year, Sammy is living with Burt in Hollywood. He wants to drop out of college, but is unable to find work in filmmaking. Burt begrudgingly accepts his son's passion. After seeing a photograph of Mitzi and Bennie together, Burt tells Sammy to keep on his path if it makes him happy. Sammy finally receives an offer from CBS to work on Hogan's Heroes. \nKnowing he is more interested in filmmaking, show co-creator Bernard Fein invites Sammy to meet director John Ford.

Alice insists that she has been \"legally abducted\" by her husband Heliodoro so he could seize her riches. Dr. Castell introduces the facility to Alice, who begins to do investigative fieldwork on the death of Dr. Raimundo Garc\u00eda del Olmo's son Dami\u00e1n. Alice (or Alicia) gets acquainted with Ignacio Urquieta and the twins (R\u00f3mulo and Remo) as well as the Gnome, a sexual molester protected by the Elephant Man, who shows animosity towards R\u00f3mulo. Alice attends sessions by Dr. Arellano.\nRunning along the primary timeline, a secondary timeline starts in a rainy night, in which a fire and riot take place and a corpse is found in one of the cells. In this timeline Urquieta is incriminated by the cops (after which a forensic doctor also comes into action) and later cleared from suspicions.\nIn the main timeline, Urquieta is interrogated by Alicia whether if he suffers from schizophrenia, the condition Alice believes Dami\u00e1n's killer suffers from.

Alvar denies this. Alicia attacks Alvar and tries to escape, only to be sedated.\nAlicia tells Castell her suspicions about Dami\u00e1n's murder and asks for a meeting of the medical council.

How Garc\u00eda del Olmo gave her instructions that she should feign a condition of paranoia to be able to enter the facility and how they managed to get Donad\u00edo to attest her condition and Heliodoro to sign the permission to withhold her. Alvar tells that Alice, offended because the man she chose to marry only wanted her money, tried to kill him by poisoning; Heliodoro, after recovering from a seizure, found Alice hiding poison; and knowing herself caught, she decided to fabricate a private investigator persona.\nAfter failing to identify a man whom Alvar identifies as Garc\u00eda del Olmo, Alice is electro-shocked, and taken to the Cage, where she becomes convinced that she has been framed by Heliodoro, who hired someone to impersonate Garc\u00eda del Olmo.

Taking advantage of the situation and believing that it would benefit the upcoming election, acting CM Narayana Varma sends party workers to riot outside the hospital. Govardhan, a truth-seeker, records a YouTube live stream and condemns those who praise PKR, claiming that he was a puppet, during his final years in the hands of a financial syndicate, which controls the entire Indian political system. He claims that the JJP party has twice the amount of money than the entire state's treasury, and the person who replaces PKR is crucial. He lists four possible candidates during the live stream: Sathyapriya, Jaidev Das, Varma, and Brahma Teja.\nSathya is PKR's daughter married to Jaidev, a notorious and discreet drug dealer, who mainly deals with real estate and Hawala scams. He is also in contact with drug lords in Mumbai, all unknown to Sathya. Varma declares himself as the most likely successor to PKR due to his seniority in the party and particularly for his lobbying skills. Brahma, meanwhile, is PKR's first child but was kept a secret from the world, as PKR did not want the public to know that he had a son with his first wife. Govardhan describes him as the \"most dangerous\" person from the list and addresses him as Godfather. Brahma's past is unknown but is now known for his contract work for corporations in Chennai, all known from Govardhan's research. Meanwhile, in Mumbai, Jaidev and Varma meet the former's partner, Abdul, and tell him that PKR had given him an ultimatum, a month ago, to stop his immoral activities. With PKR's demise, Jaidev plans to fund the JJP with drug money, by offering money to the present financier. With the help of Abdul, Jaidev cuts a deal with Lukas, who agrees to transfer \u20b9750 crore (US$94 million), every month, in exchange for importing unchecked drug contraband into Hyderabad, once the JJP wins the election. For the deal to proceed, Jaidev has to first set up a discreet drug factory. Abdul insists that the factory should be on a government-sealed roadside.

On Varma's orders, Indrajeet attempts to hinder his way but fails. That same night, Jaidev arrives home, where he gives some malana cream to Sathya's sister Jhanvi and convenes a meeting with the JJP ministers, informing his decision to fund the party and dissolve the current ministry, which will ensure the preponement of the elections. This will allow them to take advantage on the present sympathy wave and nominate himself as the party's next CM candidate.

Upon learning that an old friend, Johnny, is killed in action, Chickie and friends attend his funeral and are informed that another close friend, Tommy Minogue, whom Chickie persuaded to join the draft, has gone missing in action. After the funeral, Chickie and his friend Red find Christine in an anti-war demonstration and get into a brief physical altercation with some protestors. Back at the bar, Chickie and Red talk about how they could lift their serving friends' spirits. Chickie has an idea to go to South Vietnam himself and deliver his friends some beers. The next day, Chickie appears to backtrack on this, but as Tommy's mother suggests Chickie take to her son a set of rosary beads if he finds him, he sets out on the trip against Christine's warnings.\nChickie signs on to a ship sailing to Saigon with a duffle bag full of Pabst Blue Ribbon cans in search of military policeman Tommy Collins. He finds Collins, who is ecstatic to see him. That night, Collins' superior officer comes in and chastises Chickie for delivering the beers, then suspects him to be a CIA agent. Chickie and Collins' friends map out a plan for reaching Chickie's other friends, despite Collins urging Chickie to not put himself at risk in the battlefields and return to his ship. With guidance from a local named Hieu, Chickie stops at the Caravelle Hotel, where he finds American and British reporters opposed to the war. Using his CIA guise, he hitches a ride on a military caravan to Bien Hoa Air Base and is flown to Danang Air Base and then on to LZ Jane, where he searches for Rick Duggan, who is serving in the 1st Cavalry Division. Duggan\u2019s sergeant radios him to report to the command post, forcing Duggan to run in plain sight under enemy fire. When Chickie surprises him, Duggan reacts angrily but allows Chickie to join him and his squad on the battlefield as they fire upon the Viet Cong from trenches. When night falls, Chickie again passes around beers. Duggan also tells Chickie that one of their friends, Reynolds, was killed. After parting ways with Duggan in the morning, Chickie is put on a chopper with two CIA agents who brutally interrogate and throw out a prisoner.\nLanding at Kontum Airfield, Chickie requests a ride to Saigon, and one officer explains that he may leave his post to escort Chickie to Pleiku Air Base.

Chickie walks alone and passes by a busted jeep and a child who runs away in fear with her mother. Later that night, after nearly being trampled by elephants running from napalm, Chickie is found by another old friend, Kevin \u201cLooney\u201d McLoone. Despite their orders to move in the opposite direction of where Chickie is headed, Chickie persuades McLoone and his men to drive him to Pleiku. McLoone puts Chickie on a chopper, and Chickie throws him his beer as the helicopter ascends.\nBack in Saigon, Chickie learns that his ship has left early due to warnings of an impending attack and is on the way to the Philippines. Hieu gives Chickie directions to the U.S. Embassy, and he gives Hieu his address to visit him in New York.

Chickie sees an armored car blow a hole in the embassy wall. The next morning, Coates photographs the aftermath of the embassy attack and witnesses a huge explosion in the distance. The two drive to the scene of the explosion at Long Binh Post, where Coates explains that the military would rather fake an entry hole in the embassy wall than admit that the attack was an inside job. At Long Binh, Chickie looks for and shares a beer with one last wounded friend, Bobby Pappas, who confirms Tommy Minogue's death.\nChickie returns home with a changed perspective on the war. Before drinking with his friends, he visits Mrs. Minogue to give her the rosary beads he was to give to Tommy.

When Marek investigates the room later, he discovers that all the effects were staged. However, he also experiences more strange and inexplicable phenomena. He joins the priests for meals but has trouble eating the exceptionally unappetizing food, which makes him retch. One day one of his teeth breaks open, revealing a live fly. A few days after the exorcism, he witnesses the priests burying a casket in the church's graveyard, presumably for the girl, whose room is now empty. Piotr, the vice Prior, approaches him stealthily and asks him to meet in the confessional, where he says that the church is watching both of them and warns Marek to be careful, because those who disobey are severely punished. Marek reveals that he is a militiaman investigating an anonymous tip about missing local women, disguised as a priest because the militia does not want to openly meddle in church business after the murder of the priest Jerzy Popieluszko. According to Piotr, the Prior fakes the exorcisms to defraud the Curia and the Vatican; however, he doesn't know what happens to the women following their exorcisms. Marek searches his room for surveillance devices and finds a bizarre bone-and-eyeball device in a gap behind the closet. He hurls the device into the trash and vomits up a dark liquid full of flies that buzz and take off, and hallucinates his face being drenched in the liquid. Later, he sneaks out to dig up the exorcised woman's grave and finds an empty coffin. At this moment, Father Dawid captures Marek, knocking him out.\nMarek wakes up tied to his bed. Prior Andrzej and Father Dawid force him to consume four more portions of cooked meat, after which Marek loses consciousness. When Father Dawid dozes off, Marek frees himself; in a subsequent struggle, he fatally shoots the Father. In the kitchen, he finds the bodies of the missing women hanging on hooks in the freezer and realizes he was being fed their organs. Piotr discovers him there and convinces him to go to the library, where he explains that the priests believe Marek to be the \"chosen one,\" a baby born during an eclipse who could be used to complete a ritual that involved eating the flesh of seven sinners and drinking the blood of an innocent, after which it would transform into a demon, ushering in a new era of world order. According to Piotr, the church's former priest had tried to kill Marek at birth but failed. However, the current priests were working to complete the ritual and realize his destiny. Piotr leads Marek to a hidden exit to the sanatorium, where he betrays him to the other priests, who incapacitate him and drag him back to the sanatorium.\nWhen Marek awakens, he is restrained. The Prior explains to him that the militia's anonymous tip was intended to lure Marek to the sanatorium. He says that God and the Devil once ruled side by side, and humans are evil and should be punished by the Devil. The brotherhood has been awaiting the chosen one's birth for 800 years, and the church itself was constructed around a well that served as a portal to hell. Once the ritual is complete, the Evil One will pass through the portal to hell and assume the body of the chosen one. They envision themselves as the Devil's servants, assisting him in ruling the new world.\nThe priests then bring in a young woman, slit her throat and gather her blood, which they drink and then force Marek to partake in. However, after they finish the ritual, nothing happens. In a panic, the priests decided to hide all of the murders. Piotr stabs Marek and tosses his body into the well, while the Prior retreats to his quarters and gets exceptionally drunk. Piotr finds him there and offers to help him to bed, but instead suffocates him with a pillow. Unnoticed, the cross in the Prior's room turns upside down. At the bottom of the well, Marek awakens atop a pile of bones and convulses in agony.\nThe next morning, Piotr assumes control of the sanatorium and leads a prayer service for the Prior. In the middle of it, he freezes up, then levitates into the crucifixion pose before dissolving into a large cloud of flies. From the well, a transformed and now-demonic Marek enters the church, freezing the other priests when they attempt to flee before suspending them upside down in the crucifixion pose. On the large crucifix, the statue of Jesus turns to look at the demon. Outside, dead flowers and trees begin to bloom again, signifying that the dead are reviving and that the living may eventually pass away. Thunder rumbles as the sky splits open, signifying the beginning of the new global order and the transformation of Earth into Hell.", "tmdb_id": 1032950}, "65636298": {"title": "Hello, Goodbye, and Everything in Between", "plot": "Clare, a high school senior recently moved back to a west coast town, is convinced by her old friend Stella to attend a Halloween party.

Journalist Arezoo Rahimi (Ebrahimi) arrives in the city from Tehran to investigate a series of murders of local street prostitutes. The killings follow a pattern, with women picked up from area roundabouts by a man on a motorcycle, taken elsewhere, and strangled with their own headscarves. They are then dumped in local rubbish areas. The serial killer, Saeed Azimi, is introduced from the outset. The film's opening tracks the last evening of one of his victims. Addicted to opium, she solicits a series of clients before concluding with Azimi. They journey to a decrepit apartment complex but she senses trouble and attempts to flee before entering his apartment. Azimi strangles her in the stairwell and then flees with her body on his motorcycle.\nRahimi is depicted as self-directed, sharp in her analysis of evidence, and genuinely concerned about the fate of the murder victims. She arrives in the city alone and must navigate various restrictions placed on women in the holy city. She forms an investigative relationship with a male journalist, Sharifi (Arash Ashtiani), who offers support, but for the most part her dealings with local police are filled with dismissiveness and stonewalling. Sharifi has been in contact with the killer, having been chosen by Azimi as a kind of publicist. Sharifi's recordings and recollections offer Rahimi insight into the motive for murder: Azimi is mercurial, by turns friendly and then explosive, excoriating the prostitutes as corrupt and filthy. He claims to be cleansing the city in the name of Imam Reza, the eighth Shia Imam; he is shown in tears at the Imam's shrine.\nCultural misogyny pervades Rahimi's interactions with men during her investigation. A uniformed detective, Rostami (Sina Parvaneh), at first seems affable before making an unwanted pass and then ridiculing Rahimi's character when rebuffed. A powerful local cleric (Nima Akbarpour) similarly suggests that a loose reputation precedes her. Rahimi makes clear to Sharifi that these insinuations are themselves the product of an unwanted advance\u2014a journalistic supervisor in Tehran demanded after-work contact with Rahimi to further her career. Her position as an outsider informs Rahimi's emotionally difficult interactions with victims' families and, in one case, a preliminary conversation with a prostitute on the night of her murder.\nAzimi's personal life is portrayed in some detail. He has three children, a caring wife, and a network of fellow military veterans from the Iran-Iraq War. Emotional pain from his service is evident and he feels a failure for not having achieved martyrdom. Azimi's devotion to his family is contrasted with the brutality of his murders. One killing takes place in his home and is almost interrupted by his wife's arrival. Azimi manages to hastily hide the body in a rug. In the scene's most jarring sequence, Azimi has sex with his wife while spying the foot of his dead victim. Hannaei's adolescent son Ali idolizes him\u2014despite the violence that occasionally reaches the surface in their interactions\u2014and intergenerational imprinting is a key theme of the work.\nEventually, Rahimi and Sharifi are confident enough in the schedule, location, and patterns of the killer to initiate a dangerous trap. Rahimi, dressed as a sex worker open to solicitation, boards Azimi's motorcycle. Sharifi follows by car but loses them in the city's backstreets. Rahimi, armed with a pocket knife and a tape recorder, plans to elicit a confession from the murderer and flee but is easily found out. After a struggle, she manages to escape and make her way to the police with evidence; Azimi is picked up at his home in the following days.\nAs the case goes to trial, it becomes clear that a large portion of the public support Azimi's brutal crusade against street prostitution, and there is pressure to have him go free. Offered the opportunity to claim madness, Azimi doubles down on his religious motivations, claiming only to be mad for the eighth Imam and for God. The perpetrator being obviously lucid, the court has no choice but to find him guilty and he is sentenced to death. Supporters from the prosecution and his veteran's association visit Azimi in prison, assuring him he will be spirited away in a car on the day of execution. When the time arrives it is clear this was a ruse to keep him quiet and he is hanged, raging and struggling when dragged to the scaffold.\nThe film ends with a kind moment of goodbye between Rahimi and Sharifi before she boards a bus home. While traveling she reviews video evidence gathered during the case, pausing over an interview with the killer's son, Ali: he proudly describes how his father overpowered and choked his victims, play-acting a killing with his younger sister.", "tmdb_id": 889699}, "69316319": {"title": "Holy Wound", "plot": "The film depicts the story of two Homosexual young women.

Rex promotes Stanley to assistant coach, allowing him to remain at home with his family. The same evening, however, Rex dies, leaving Vince in charge. Three months later, Vince demotes Stanley again to scout, sending him overseas. His former college teammate Leon Rich encourages him to leave the 76ers and also become a player agent. When Stanley's plan to scout a player in Spain falls through, watching a local pick-up game, he is stunned by an incredibly talented unknown player.\nStanley attempts to speak with the man, Bo Cruz, but is rebuffed until he makes a FaceTime call to Dirk Nowitzki to prove his legitimacy. Bo and his mother Paola recount his life story: he was a talented player from an early age and was invited to play in America at age 15, but stayed in Spain after his girlfriend became pregnant with his daughter Lucia. Bo now works construction and makes extra money hustling at basketball. After an impressive workout with members of the Spanish national team, Stanley urges the 76ers front office to sign Cruz immediately, but Vincent is unconvinced. Taking matters into his own hands, Stanley pays to bring Cruz to the US, telling him he will be signed by the Sixers or enter the NBA draft.

Teresa and Alex assist with the training by preparing meals and taping workouts.

To create interest, the Sugermans enlist Julius Erving to create a viral video of \"the Boa Challenge\", where people, including 76ers player Tobias Harris, attempt to score on Bo for money.

Mark gives two escape options: going down a sewer, or using a bomb and escaping from the vault.\nChoosing the sewer, they stumble upon a branch leading to two tunnels: a dark or a light one.\nAfter choosing the dark tunnel, Mark repeatedly suggests splitting up to cover more ground. Choosing this option invariably results in Mark's immediate death or disappearance. If the assistant chooses not to split, they and Mark investigate further into a tunnel inhabited by the \"Sewer Cult,\" eventually resulting in the tunnel's destruction, the assistant holding Mark over the enormous pit. If they decide to let him go, the assistant escapes the tunnel, having to cope with Mark's demise. If they hang on, they both fall, Mark using the box's contents, a portable wormhole device, to allow them to escape. The device teleports them through various other timelines of the film before returning them to the start. Additionally, one of the \"split up\" decisions results in the assistant being confronted by \"Darkiplier,\" who tells them that Mark is a liar, and that he has hidden codes in every ending. Traveling to the light tunnel somehow brings them to the middle of the ocean, resulting either with the assistant being abducted by pirates, or Mark and the assistant being stranded on a deserted island, either being abducted by aliens (Hanson, Avidan) or joining the company of a potential cannibal (Patrick).\nIf the assistant chooses to use the bomb to escape the vault, they and Mark escape and are presented with two getaway options: a helicopter or a car.\nIf the assistant chooses the helicopter, they find themselves unable to fly it and are sent to Happy Trails Penitentiary, a rehabilitation-focused prison. The assistant can attempt to gain respect from the guards or the prisoners. If they attempt to suck up to the guards, they find themselves unsuccessful and try to do it on their own. In one of the resulting endings, the box contains a fairy that grants wishes, but is confiscated by a prison guard (Boggs) due to its annoying cries of \"Listen!\". In another ending, Mark is ambushed by Bubba (Muyskens), an undercover federal marshal, who reveals his true name to be Bob. If the assistant shoots Bob, he takes off a mask to reveal that he was really Wade (Barnes). Mark is then shot by the real Bob, who then reveals that the assistant was also Wade all along. The assistant can also open the box, sending them back in time to the beginning. Briefly investigating a human shaped hole, but deciding against entering reverses the roles of Bob and Wade, and travelling back in time then results in the assistant being interviewed by \"Wilford Warfstache\". Entering the human-shaped tunnel slowly deforms the assistant, a reference to The Enigma of Amigara Fault. If they attempt to gain the respect of the prisoners, Mark is immediately punched through a wall upon mentioning escaping. A musical number ensues, led by an inmate named Yancy, explaining that none of the prisoners desire to leave. The assistant is then asked if they still wish to do so. If they do not want to leave, they end killing another inmate to ensure that they will receive a life sentence. If they wish to leave, Yancy offers his assistance in their escape.\nIf the assistant chooses the car, Mark tells the assistant that the car broke down amid a ride. He offers options of walking or fix the car. If they decide to fix the car, a sinkhole separates them. The assistant reaches a cave, where a man named Illinois, resembling Indiana Jones, hands the assistant a cursed monkey statue and asks them to place it on a pedestal. If they refuse to place it, the assistant, seemingly possessed by the statue, attacks Illinois. If they place it, they are both briefly transported to monkey heaven before Illinois leaves them behind.\nIf they decide to walk, a set of zombies chase them. Unbeknownst to Mark, the assistant is bitten by one of the zombies (Scheid). If they tell the truth, Mark tells them to go away, and the assistant lives with the zombies forever after. Otherwise, they are given a choice between finding a scientist or going to the safety of a nearby fort. At Fort Brannagan, supposedly the only zombie-proof area, Mark and the assistant are inspected for bites by a soldier named Ed (Morris). If the assistant tells the truth about their bite, they are shot. If they don't, it is revealed that the fort has been infiltrated by zombies, and that Ed has been bitten, rigging the fort to explode to prevent the virus' spread. After it explodes, the assistant reveals their bite to Mark. The box is revealed to be the \"world's oldest picnic basket,\" and the assistant is given a choice between two ancient sandwiches: a peanut butter and jelly sandwich (PB&J) or a tuna fish sandwich. If the 2,000-year-old PB&J is eaten, it allows the assistant to turn into a more relaxed zombie, allowing for them to unite humans and zombies. If the 17 AD tuna is eaten, it creates a cure to the zombie virus. At the science lab, the scientist (Pansino) explains that something has caused time and space to warp, intent on destroying the anomaly. She initially believes that the assistant is the anomaly, attempting to kill them to save the fabric of the universe.

The insignia and incantation are interspersed frequently throughout the film to encourage the viewer to pray along. The events of the film are shown as a found footage in a non-linear manner.\nSix years earlier, Ronan, her boyfriend Dom, and Dom's cousin Yuan, broke a religious taboo while documenting a ritual for their online video channel. They went to a remote clan village inhabited by Dom and Yuan's relatives, who practiced an esoteric Yunnan religion worshipping an ancestral deity called Mother-Buddha. The clan asked the three to submit their names with the incantation to the Mother-Buddha. A clan elder told Ronan that after her daughter was born, she must also submit her daughter's name; Ronan was surprised as she had not realized that she was pregnant.\nThat night, the group spied on the clan performing the ritual, where a young girl seemed to be willingly prepared for a sacrifice. The unconscious girl, whose body was covered in runes, was left in front of a tunnel, which the group were keen to enter but the clan had said was forbidden. Ronan waited with the girl while Dom and Yuan entered the tunnel after destroying its barricades. Yuan later emerged screaming hysterically, while Dom's lifeless body was later seen being carried by the villagers from the tunnel. The footage from within the tunnel has since become damaged and cannot be played. After Dodo was born, Ronan left her at a foster care home and sought psychiatric help.\nIn the present, Ronan has recovered and is taking Dodo to live with her. Their house soon becomes infested by unexplained activities and Dodo is disturbed by a shadowy presence. Dodo gradually develops a debilitating illness and Ronan's mental health declines. When social workers arrive to take Dodo away, she and Ronan escape with the help of Ming, the sympathetic manager of the foster care home. They bring Dodo to a shrine, where a priest and his wife agree to risk their lives to exorcize Dodo. They forbid her from eating for the next seven days, but when her condition deteriorates and runes appear all over her body, Ronan feeds her. The priest and his wife are violently killed, and Ronan takes Dodo to a hospital.\nMeanwhile, Ming goes to Yunnan to conduct more research into the esoteric religion and restores the damaged tunnel footage. As his mental health rapidly declines from watching the undamaged portion of the footage, he decides not to send the tunnel footage to Ronan. However, he later becomes possessed and sends copies of the tunnel footage to Ronan before killing himself by smashing his own head repeatedly on camera. In the footage, it is shown that Dom and Yuan had reached the altar of the Mother-Buddha, whose face was covered with a veil. While trying to remove the veil, Dom got possessed and died after smashing his head. The footage also reveals that Yuan became possessed before being violently killed in the village by unseen forces.\nRonan confesses that she has been lying to the viewer all along. It is revealed that a priest in Yunnan had explained to her that the Mother-Buddha is a malevolent entity, and that if you submit your name with the incantation, it means you agree to carry the curse. Instead of conveying blessings, the incantation actually serves to dilute the curse. When more people chant it, the curse gets spread out and the burden on those bearing it becomes lighter. The Mother-Buddha's face has to be covered because it is the source of the curse. Ronan, now covered in runes, returns and enters the tunnel correcting small mistakes in the labyrinth of caves and takes the viewer to the altar and asks the person watching for their name before revealing the Mother-Buddha's face on camera. She then gets possessed and smashes her own head on the altar.

The second site is a remote platform in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. U.S. Army Captain J. J. Collins is recently reassigned to the latter of the two interceptor missile launch sites. Following the conclusion of a high-profile case where she reported sexual misconduct by one of her superiors, she experienced hazing, bullying and threats from her peers in the military as revenge, hence her new deployment to this remote station.\nUnder the command of Lt. Colonel Marshall, and working alongside Beaver and Shah in the station's command center, Collins finds herself as part of the last line of defense after the hostile takeover of Fort Greely. The station is infiltrated by a small group of operatives led by ex-military intelligence soldier Kessel, who promptly kill Marshall and the other occupants of the base, leaving only Collins, Shah, and an unconscious Baker, who was grazed by a stray bullet, as the survivors, holed up in the command center. The infiltrators attempt to negotiate entry into the command center, by which they can disarm the interceptor system and leave the continental U.S. open to nuclear attack from the sixteen stolen warheads. They are rebuffed however, and attempt to forcibly enter instead with blowtorches. An operative launches a surprise attack after entering via a floor hatch, but is defeated and killed by Collins and Shah. Beaver regains consciousness and reveals himself to be an inside man for the infiltrators and motivated by a big pay day and xenophobia, holding both Collins and Shah at gunpoint while allowing Kessel and the remaining operatives to enter and assume control.\nKessel hijacks a live feed and streams his manifesto about the failures in the history of the United States online, naming the sixteen American cities to be destroyed, and instructing the terrorist faction to launch the nukes immediately. Collins breaks free of her restraints and locks Kessel, Beaver, and a henchman back out of the command center, while defeating and killing Kira, the lone enemy operative still in the room, and another henchman. Kessel attempts to force Collins to surrender, torturing her father, but she refuses and her father is apparently killed when the transmission is cut. Kessel turns to plan B, initiating the station's scuttling protocol, hoping to sink the station if he cannot take control of it. As the station begins to sink, Shah volunteers to drop through the floor hatch to the ocean below and manually re-engage the station's hatches, in order to slow down the station from sinking, such that the interceptors are still able to launch and destroy the warheads when they eventually pass through the airspace overhead. Shah succeeds, but he is killed by Beaver.\nCollins decides to make a risky gamble, hiding in the command center and letting Kessel, Beaver, and the remaining henchman take over and disable the seemingly empty center. Her ruse works, with Beaver going to check up on the station's roof to find and eliminate her. Collins is able to stealthily dispatch the remaining henchman while Kessel flees the room. Grabbing a laptop, Collins ascends to the roof and plugs the device in, hoping to manually launch the interceptor missiles using this method. She is found by Beaver however, and the two engage in hand to hand combat, with Collins emerging victorious after using razor wire to decapitate Beaver. Kessel, who had called in a Russian submarine to pick up the team of operatives earlier, finds Collins just as she successfully launches the interceptor missiles with a fraction of a second left before the nukes would have crossed the point of interception. His plan failed, he engages in combat with Collins, who manages to defeat and subdue him, just as the Russian submarine ascends from the sea.

While digging the well, the land slides and the well becomes too deep. Sambath gets out of the well with the help of Mohini and Mathamma. He requests that they bring a lamp to measure the depth of the well. They tied a rope around the lamp and put the lamp into the well. When they pulled up the rope, the lamp was missing, but a mud pot was tied with the rope. When they opened the mud pot, the pot was filled with gold jewels. By seeing this, Sambath tells them he is going to buy more lamps to get more gold. After Sambath leaves, they discover a piece of paper with the words, \"If you have anything else, send it to me.\" So they took a chicken and threw it down the well, and this time they got a large mud pot filled with gold and a piece of paper that said, \"If you have anything else, send it to me.\" Sambath came back with a lot of lamps, and he put all of those lamps into the well, but when he pulled the rope, all of those lamps were damaged. When he saw those damaged lamps, he got angry and took an aruval and entered the well tied up with a rope. When Mathamma and Mohini pulled the rope, a big wooden barrel appeared with a paper written with \"Keep sending this to me\". By seeing the paper, they send their drunkard uncle Venu into the well. They understood that the well needed human flesh. So they ask Aarumugam, a police officer, for dead bodies. He also gave them some dead bodies.

At the same time, his father fractures his leg and an ox hits the plant of Tulasi in front of their house. Considering all the inauspicious occurrences, Karthik's mother believes that her family is being punished for not being able to fulfil a vow made to Lord Krishna, a few years ago. Therefore, Karthik takes her to Dwarka where his uncle Sadananda, an ardent devotee of Lord Krishna, lives. One night, Karthik crosses paths with a mortally wounded Ranganath Rao, who tries to tell something to him. When Karthik leaves to fetch an auto rikshaw for taking him to hospital and returns, he fails to find Rao. The following day, Karthik's mother goes missing and he searches for her with his uncle. He is arrested by the Police, who accuse him of murder and ask him what Rao had told him. When Karthik tells them that he was not able to interpret his words, the Police refuse to believe him. A girl, Mugdha, revealed to be Rao's granddaughter rescues Karthik from Police custody. A mysterious man attacks Karthik but stops when he sees the idol of Lord Krishna.\nKarthik, Mugdha and Sadananda visit a sage to find about the man and learns that he belongs to the clan of Abheeras, an exiled community who resorted to dacoity but worshipped Lord Krishna. They wouldn't let the people, who tries to hinder with Krishna's belongings, live. Karthik finds his mother and determined to solve the mystery; he advises her to be safe at a 11-days-long Pravachan. They visit Rao's office in Bet Dwarka and read a letter, written by him. Rao had found that the anklet was hidden by Uddhava, who left behind clues to reach it, as the right person is destined to get that. For centuries, several people had tried to find the anklet but to no avail. Pallava King Suryavarman reached the closest and told the penultimate clue to Ptolemy, who hid the object with clue in Krishna Thatakam, which Rao was trying to utter when he met Karthik. Santanu, a professor in search of the anklet, kills Rao with evil intentions and was the one, responsible behind Karthik's arrest. Karthik finds a peacock-shaped object in Krishna Thatakam and Mugdha decodes the Sanskrit inscription written on it, that leads them to Govardhan Hill. The trio hire Suleman to take them to Govardhana Hill, Mathura without being caught by Police. Upon arriving there, they are apprehended by villagers, who are greedy for the prize money announced by Santanu for Karthik and Mugdha. They manage to convince the villagers of their objectives and climbs the hill to find an entrance, that they open using the peacock-shaped object and retrieve a telescope from it.\nNext morning, Mugdha escapes with the telescope leaving Karthik, Sadananda and Suleman. Santanu apprehends the trio and leaves them in the desert to die but Mugdha arrives and rescues them, revealing that she had gone to her friend for finding about a person, who would help them in solving the mystery. Together, the foursome leave to Himachal Pradesh for meeting a blind philosopher Dr. Dhanvantari, who explains that Rao and Santanu were a part of secret society, that believed that the ancient India is far more advanced in technology than the modern world. When Santanu proposed to use the anklet for selfish reasons, Rao objected. The fate let Rao choose Karthik to carry his aim forward. Dhanvantari also explains that Krishna should be considered as a human rather than God, who was an extraordinary engineer for building his palace in midst of sea, a kinetic engineer for controlling Sudarshana Chakra, a doctor for knowing all the Ayurvedic treatment methods, a musician for being talented in playing flute, that helped as a music therapy and much more.\nWhile returning, they are surrounded by the Police and therefore, Karthik travels on the truck through a frozen river, that begins to break. They manage to escape being drowned but are ambushed by an Abheera, who is forced to practice peace for 24 hours due to Krishna Paksha. Karthik observes the constellations on a hill, the next clue led to through the telescope, they found and finds the final location. They reach the final location but Abheera attacks to kill them. However, Karthik fights back and joins the telescope and peacock-shaped object forming the structure of flute, that he places in the hand of Lord Krishna's idol situated at the place. Therefore, the entry to the underground hallway filled with snakes, which protect the anklet is opened. Karthik uses his abilities to communicate with the snake to reach the anklet and wins nationwide fame.

Pushkar Nath Pandit, a teacher, fears for the safety of his son Karan, who has been accused by the militants of being an Indian spy. Pushkar requests his friend Brahma Dutt, a civil servant, for Karan's protection. Brahma travels with Pushkar to Kashmir and witnesses the violence against Kashmiri Pandits. He takes up the issue with the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), who suspends Brahma.\nMilitant commander Farooq Malik Bitta, also a former student of Pushkar, breaches Pushkar Nath's house. Karan hides in a rice container but is found and shot by Bitta. Pushkar and his daughter-in-law Sharda plead for their lives. Bitta compels Sharda to eat rice soaked in Karan's blood in exchange for their lives. After Bitta and his gang leave the house, Pushkar begs his doctor friend Mahesh Kumar to bring an ambulance and save Karan's life. However, the hospital gets taken over by militants, who forbid the hospital staff from treating non-Muslims. Subsequently, Karan succumbs to injuries from the gunshots.\nTo ensure their safety, Pushkar and his family are taken by their journalist friend Vishnu Ram to Kaul, a Hindu poet who maintains a cordial relationship with Muslims. Kaul takes in many Pandits into his home but a group of militants arrives to pick Kaul and his son up under the guise of offering protection. The rest of the Pandits leave the place but are later shocked to find corpses of Kaul and his son hanging from trees.\nThe refugee Pandits from the Kashmir valley settle in Jammu and live on meagre ration and in poor conditions. Brahma is appointed as an advisor to the new Governor of J&K. At his request, the Home Minister visits the Jammu camps where Pushkar demands the removal of Article 370 and the resettlement of Kashmiri Pandits. Brahma manages to get Sharda a government job in Nadimarg in Kashmir, and the family moves there.\nOne day a group of militants headed by Bitta dress up as members of the Indian Army and arrive at Nadimarg. They start rounding up the Pandits living there. Sharda resists when the militants get hold of her elder son Shiva. Angry Farooq strips her and saws her body in half. He lines up Shiva and the remaining Pandits and shoots them into a mass grave. Pushkar is spared to spread the word about what happened.\n2020\nIn the present day, Sharda's younger son Krishna is brought up by Pushkar. He believes that his parents had died in an accident. A student of ANU, Krishna is under the influence of professor Radhika Menon who is a supporter of Kashmiri separatism. Pushkar's friends Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, and police officer Hari Narain, who had served in Kashmir when Karan was killed, recall the events of Kashmir from their memory that Brahma calls a \"genocide\".\nKrishna contests the ANU's student election. Following the advice of professor Radhika Menon, he holds the Government of India responsible for the issue of Kashmir, much to the anger of Pushkar. Later, when Pushkar dies, Krishna travels to his ancestral home in Kashmir to scatter the ashes per Pushkar's last wish. Menon asks Krishna to record some footage in Kashmir to expose the government's supposed atrocities. With the help of one of Menon's contacts, Krishna meets Bitta and accuses him of being responsible for the situation of the Pandits. But Bitta declares himself to be a new-age Gandhi who is leading a non-violent democratic movement. Bitta claims that it was the Indian Army, who killed Krishna's mother and brother. When Krishna questions Brahma about this claim, Brahma hands him files of newspaper cuttings (collected by Pushkar), reporting that militants, disguised as Indian Army soldiers, had killed them.\nKrishna returns to Delhi and gives his scheduled speech for the university presidential elections to a roaring crowd at the ANU campus. He elaborates on the history of Kashmir and the plight of his family and other Kashmiri Hindu victims that he had discovered from his visit.

They fought amongst themselves destroying the planet forcing the goddess to restrain Chathan to the mountains and Gari Devan under the land, before returning to her abode. Human beings then start worshipping them, knowing that they are very powerful and can be used for the betterment of mankind.\nThe movie then shifts to a village, where the conservative landlord Thuppan undervalues people from low-caste and was known to be very cruel. Chokkan was a young orphan, who unbeknownst to everyone often met Chathan and gave him food in exchange for gems. Thuppan's generous wife Nangakutty was fond of Chokkan and often conversed with him. One day, while Chokkan was conversing with Nangakutty, he forgets the mangoes that he fetched and Nangakutty, unbeknownst to anyone, eats the mangoes which was considered a sin by the landlord as he considers them outcasts. Later, while Nangakutty was serving food to Thuppan, he notices the smell of mangoes coming from Nangakutty and realizes she ate mangoes from the forest.

The sacrifice of Thuppan's son and Gari Devan's protection for the family only lasts for twelve generations and it was Dhruvan's turn as the lord of the twelfth generation to sacrifice his child which is why the women were not happy over Kumari's pregnancy. Terrified, Kumari expresses to Lakshmi that Dhruvan would never do such a thing but Lakshmi tells her that the family's men would go to any extent to uphold their power and traditions.

Kokila's mother believes this claim and gives a complaint to Naatrayan.\nDSP Muthukaruppan starts investigating and finds that Eeshwaran's uncle wanted him to take care of managing the farmlands owned by him. After seeing his diligence, he wants his daughter Kokila to get married to Eeshwaran so that relationships are maintained. Both Eeshwaran and Kokila loved each other, then got married, living a seemingly happy life. But Priya and Kokila were not on good terms with each other due to possessiveness on Eeshwaran. During Kokila's pregnancy, this fight reaches a point where Kokila's parents came to mediate it with Eeshwaran and suggest that shifting Priya to Coimbatore would be helpful for her studies and resolve this issue. Eeshwaran has already suggested this to Priya, but she is not willing to move out the house as from a young age, she wanted to marry Eeshwaran. However, she was heartbroken when he married Kokila and states her only happiness is him and to let her stay at his house. \nUnderstanding the situation, Kokila's parents try to take Kokila with them for a few days for her peace of mind. With no choice, Eeshwaran takes Priya to a lodge and stays there, then met with Kokila's parents about the issue. It is also revealed that Kokila accidentally killed her child since she had problems with her breast milk secretion and someone suggested to Kokila that eating apple seed paste will help her. But by mistake, she fed it to her baby, who died. Kokila was depressed, and during an argument with her husband, he slapped her, causing a head injury. Priya took her to the hospital without Eeshwaran's knowledge, and those are the medical records she burned at the start since it might make Eeshwaran look suspicious.\nMeanwhile, Naatrayan is enraged by the verdict. He gets drunk and kidnaps Priya, still believing she is the murderer. Later, he tries to hang her and explains that he can convince the village that she committed suicide due to the guilt of killing Kokila. A fight ensues between Naatrayan and Eeshwaran, and it is revealed that Naatrayan is also at blame for Kokila's suicide. Kokila pushed her childhood friend Chitra from a bridge into a river below accidentally over a small fight. Naatrayan tells to cover it up and hide it from everyone. As Kokila's child dies on the same day Chitra died, she believes it is God's punishment and the guilt was part of the reason why she died. \nA few months later, Muthu meets Eeshwaran and asks who suggested to use apple seed paste in the first place. When Chitra was pushed, Naatrayan's friend witnessed this too and blackmailed Naatrayan for money to keep his mouth shut. Recently, in a small argument, Naatrayan blackmails his friend, who decides to tell the truth to Muthu, Chitra's brother. Enraged, he decides to kill Kokila, but unexpectedly, her child died. Eeshwaran states he did not take revenge against Muthu as his mother already lost a child and he has a family, but he mentions that Muthu will definitely get his karma. Later, it is revealed that the girl who met with the car accident at the start was Muthu's daughter.

As a boy in 1977, Laal has an IQ of 75 and is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine. He lives in Karoli, Punjab, with his mother, who runs a farm and encourages him to live beyond his disabilities. He meets a girl named Rupa D'Souza on his first day at school, and the two become best friends. One day, a group of bullies starts pelting stones at Laal. When he runs to escape them, his leg braces come off, and he realizes that he is a fast runner. Rupa's father is arrested by the police as he beat her mother to death. When Rupa's mother dies, she is sent to live with her grandmother, who used to work at Laal\u2019s house. Laal was happy because now he and Rupa could always be together. When the 1984 anti-Sikh riots break out, Laal and his mother go to stay at his aunt's place to be safe. There, Laal meets a young Shah Rukh Khan and teaches him dance steps and poses which he would later go on to use in his films.   \nTo save Laal from rioters, Laal's mother cuts off his long hair and removes his turban, to hide his identity as a Sikh. Laal\u2019s mother sends him and Rupa to Hindu College in Delhi. There, Laal witnesses L.K. Advani's Ram Rath Yatra. Laal takes part in track and field, and wins many prizes, whereas Rupa starts taking part in modeling competitions, as she dreams of becoming a model in Mumbai and becoming rich. Sometime later, Laal joins the army, where he meets Balaraju Bodi aka Bala, who wants to start an undergarment business. They both decide to start an undergarment-manufacturing company together, once they leave the army. Rupa goes to Mumbai to pursue her dreams. \nIn 1999, the Kargil War breaks out between India and Pakistan. Laal and Bala were in the same battalion. Rupa had told Laal to start running as soon as his life was in danger. When the Pakistani soldiers had an advantage, he runs, but realizes that Bala is left behind. He goes back, but every time he goes back, he finds another soldier who is injured and asks for help. He also saves a Pakistani commander, not knowing he was the enemy. He could not save Bala, leaving him heartbroken, but is awarded a medal by the Indian Government for saving five soldiers.\nRupa never responded to any letters that Laal sent her. She had become the mistress of a gangster who took advantage of her and lied to her about fulfilling her dreams (parallels are made to the controversial relationship of the infamous gangster Abu Salem and Monica Bedi). Laal goes to meet her and sees the gangster slap her; Laal responds angrily by beating him up. Laal says that he loves Rupa, but she tells him that they have no future together and that he should forget her. Laal suddenly sees Mohammed Paaji, the Pakistani commander he had saved during the war. He had escaped from the hospital before anyone could know his true identity and has been living alone, and using a wheelchair, ever since. The two strike a friendship and Mohammed loves him for his purity and innocence, also feeling guilty of his violent acts of terrorism. \nLaal finally starts the undergarment business, but doesn't know how to market his product. Then, Mohammed Paaji joins the team. Mohammed gives the idea that if the brand is named after a girl, then maybe their sales would increase. Laal knew only one girl, so he renames his company Rupa (a reference to the knitwear company of the same name). The sales start to grow, and soon the company was selling innerwear to all of India, making Laal and Mohammed successful entrepreneurs. Mohammed invests money in Bombay Stock Exchange what Laal thinks is \"some kind of cowshed\" and they become even richer. After a while, Mohammed returns to his country and opens a school for children. Laal gives half his earnings to Bala's family for having inspired the undergarment business venture. Laal's mother also passes away from cancer, leaving him alone. \nLaal dedicates his time to tending to the land his mother left him. Rupa comes back to stay with him. She reciprocates his feelings and the two make love. Sometime later, the police come and arrest Rupa, as she had links with the underworld, and take her away, without Laal knowing. She is sent to prison for six months. Laal is heartbroken and decides to go running \"for no particular reason\". He goes on a cross-country marathon for over four years. People think that he might be running for some great purpose, and the media start covering his journey. His run covers almost every inch of the country. After years of running, he suddenly stops. Many people had started running along with him, thinking that he was running for some great purpose. They ask him why he stopped, expecting a philosophical answer. Laal says that he is tired and that he just wants to go back home.  \nOn reaching home, Laal wears a turban again after many years. He is pleasantly surprised to know that Rupa had written him a lot of letters. He tells his fellow passengers on the train that Rupa had served her sentence and is now living in Chandigarh, and he is going to meet her.

Blaming himself for stranding the crew, Buzz volunteers as the test pilot for the hyperspace fuel crystal they will need to develop to return home. One year later, the crew has constructed a new colony to conduct repairs.\nBuzz's disastrous first test flight is compounded by the effects of time dilation: for the four minutes he spent in flight, four years have passed on T'Kani Prime. Alisha shares that she is now engaged to a scientist named Kiko. She gifts Buzz Sox, an AI robot therapist with the shape and behaviors of a cat. Buzz decides to conduct further tests with alternate fuel mixtures, with Alisha's reluctant approval. After many failed tests, each taking place during years of time on the colony, Buzz discovers that Alisha has died of old age, leaving behind a recording where she wishes Buzz goodbye and introduces him to her granddaughter Izzy. Her successor, Commander Cal Burnside, informs Buzz that the colony has given up attempting to regain lightspeed capability and has decided to live on the planet permanently, relying on a laser shield to protect them. Sox reveals that after six decades of work he found a stable formula for the fuel.

Zurg reveals himself to be an older version of Buzz from the original timeline, which split upon Buzz's return to the planet after the successful hyperspace test: without the robot army to detain them, soldiers from the colony attempted to arrest Buzz under Burnside's orders, forcing the original Buzz to flee into space.

They are a perfect couple, made for each other, and are ready to take their relationship to the next level i.e. marriage, but Pradeep hesitates a bit due to Nikitha's strict father. But Venu eventually finds out about his daughter's relationship with Pradeep and invites Pradeep over to his house, ostensibly to discuss about the marriage. However, during their meeting, Venu toys around with Pradeep and then proposes a strange deal with him; he should exchange his mobile phone with that of Nikitha's for a day, along with the respective mobile's screen lock. After the end of the period, if they still feel that they are in love, Venu will not object to their union, else they must go their separate ways. Both Pradeep and Nikitha agree to this decision half-heartedly and exchange their phones, but Pradeep deletes his WhatsApp messages before doing so.\nPradeep then returns home to manage Divya's upcoming marriage to Dr. Yogi, a dentist, which is to take place in four days time. On the goading of his friends, Pradeep goes through Nikitha's mobile phone, where he sees a WhatsApp conversation with Revi, Nikitha's boy best friend, who has a one-sided love for her. Pradeep is upset that Nikitha has a strong relationship with Revi, despite knowing about his one-sided love, and do many activities together. He further finds out that Nikitha is still friends with her ex-boyfriend Mamakutty and had gone on a night drive with him to Puducherry a few days earlier without his knowledge. He confronts Nikitha on both Revi and Mamakutty, leaving her in tears, and driving a wedge into their hitherto perfect relationship. The next day, Pradeep proposes to Venu that both he and Nikitha keep each other's phones until Divya's marriage is over, to know more about Nikitha's relationships, to which Venu agrees readily.

The same account was used to perversely message Nikitha as well as her younger sister Shwetha (though Pradeep did not send the messages). Pradeep realises this and meets Nikitha at a restaurant to try and convince her to hand over his phone for an OTP to remove the account from his phone. But Revi, who has accompanied Nikitha, discovers the account and exposes Pradeep. This leads to a big fight between Nikitha and Pradeep, which ends with them breaking up. Further, Pradeep beats up Revi for interfering in their relationship, only to be stopped by the restaurant staff.

Saraswathi consoles him and tells him that trust in relationship is all that is needed, which he realises when he finds the tree he had struggled to grow in his childhood.

Arjun explains his problems to God.\nArjun, after marriage, continues to treat Anu as a friend and things are smooth until he starts working in Anu's father's toilet manufacturing factory as a quality control checker. Arjun hates this job, but gets used to it and is unable to see Anu as anything more than a friend and is totally bored by the monotony of his life. One day, he meets Meera, his school senior and childhood crush, who now works as an assistant film director. They strike up a friendship, with Meera encouraging Arjun to explore his passion for acting and requesting him to audition for Yogaraj Bhat's upcoming film. The audition goes very well, with Arjun impressing the director with his performance. Later at a pub, Meera tells Arjun about her failed film-making attempts and a past break-up. Arjun consoles Meera and hugs her, but this is noticed by Anu, who is already sad at Arjun not reciprocating her feelings and assumes they are having an extramarital affair. Anu and Arjun have a nasty quarrel, which ends with Arjun asking for divorce.\nBack in the present, Arjun blames God for his current situation. So God gives Arjun a second chance to rectify the mistake with a golden ticket with three conditions - The ticket should stay with Arjun always, he should tell nobody about this ticket, and if at all he tells anyone about the ticket, he will die. Accepting the conditions, Arjun grabs the ticket and time travels to the night where he accepted Anu's marriage proposal.\nThis time, Arjun rejects Anu's proposal. Therefore, Anu decides to marry the groom chosen by her father. Meanwhile, Arjun decides to pursue Meera, feeling that she is the right person for him. They strike a friendship, with Arjun removing all barriers which caused Meera's film-making attempts to fail in the original timeline. Arjun also decides to pursue acting as a career and Anu manages to convince his parents on the same. Meera soon starts to reciprocate Arjun's interest for her. Arjun also gets a chance to perform in audition for a film to be directed by Gautham Menon, and is selected for final audition to be held a month later. He goes to tell Anu's father about this news and gets into a deep conversation with him. Anu's father tells Arjun that he hails from a very backward village in Tirunelveli and his mother had died 50 years ago by snake bite, due to lack of toilets. He then left village as a teenager, with the mission of eradicating open defecation in his area. That led to him creating his latrine company and achieving his goal of bringing toilets to his native village. This revelation makes Arjun realise his mistake of ridiculing their business.\nAnu learns that Arjun likes Meera and there is fair chance that Meera might reciprocate his love too. So Anu offers to help Arjun to propose Meera, asking him to make a video for Meera's upcoming birthday with wishes from Meera's family/friends and propose her at the end of the video. As a result, they go on a bike ride to Kerala, which is Meera's home state. By this time, through various instances, Arjun had started to realise how sweet and loving Anu is, and how supportive Anu's father was. During the trip, Arjun realises that he really loves Anu and that his interest towards Meera is just an infatuation. While on the Kerala trip, Arjun and Anu come across Meera's ex-boyfriend, who broke up with Meera to focus on his boxing career, however, he has also not gotten over her. Arjun decides to reunite Meera and Krishna instead and modifies the video accordingly. Meera reconciles with Krishna on her birthday after watching the video.\nArjun attends Anu's wedding with a heavy heart. Unable to express his feelings for Anu, Arjun walks out of the church with Shetty. At this juncture, they see Anu running out of the church without getting married. They meet her in their usual hangout pub, where she reveals her love for Arjun and also adds that she knew his feelings for her, hence she cancelled the wedding at the last minute. But Arjun again refuses to marry her as he does not want to hurt her again. When confronted by Anu and Mani, he blurts out about the second chance and the golden ticket. Immediately the ticket flies away from Arjun and in a bid to catch it, he gets hit by a lorry, killing him.\nArjun finds himself with God once again and pleads for one final chance; this time God states that no more final chances will be given to him and sends him away, asking him to take care of his own problems. Then Arjun realises that he is back in reality; on the day his divorce hearing is taking place. He rushes back to the court, where Anu is ready to give consent to the divorce. This time, Arjun refuses divorce and confesses his love to Anu. Anu accepts Arjun's love and reunites with him. It is revealed that God has given Arjun yet another chance and blesses him to go and live happily with Anu.", "tmdb_id": 921748}, "70435479": {"title": "Lullaby (2022 film)", "plot": "After giving birth Amaia returns to her parents' home as her partner is away for some time.", "tmdb_id": 835504}, "67692204": {"title": "Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile (film)", "plot": "In New York City, a charismatic magician named Hector P.

When questioned by the Indian Army Officials on why he did it and that the area belongs to Pakistan, he replies \"It is ours\". Young Sandeep grows up with his sister, Sandhya, and his parents K. Unnikrishnan and Dhanalakshmi, in Yelahanka, Bangalore. As a child, he was very curious about the world around him. When Unnikrishnan took him to see a Navy ceremony with military airplanes flying in the sky Sandeep developed an early fascination with the life of a soldier. In his later years as a secondary school student, Sandeep falls in love with his classmate, Isha. Sandeep applied to join the Indian Navy without telling his parents, much to the fury of Unnikrishnan. However, the Navy rejected Sandeep's application, causing Sandeep to ultimately join the army. As the years progressed, Sandeep rises  ranks to become an NSG training officer.\nIn 2008, Sandeep is well established in his career as a training officer for the 51 Special Action Group of the NSG and is married to Isha, but their marriage is in trouble. Sandeep asks for leave to try and save his marriage. On the same day as Sandeep's leave though, Pakistani terrorists arrive in Mumbai by boat and they proceed to orchestrate deadly attacks in the city. Desperately crowds start heading to the Taj Hotel for safety but the terrorists also enter the hotel and start shooting at staff and guests spontaneously. The local police are called to the scene but they are ill-equipped to deal with the threat. Upon discovering the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, Sandeep requests Commander Shera to allow him to participate in the NSG mission to neutralize the terrorist threat. They leave for Mumbai and commence the military counterterrorism operation: Operation Black Tornado, but the NSG encounters numerous obstacles and problems upon arriving at the scene. They lack surveillance cameras to discover the number of people inside the building.\nThe terrorists have installed deadly booby traps and trip wires with bombs throughout the premises. Several hotel staff and guests end up crowded together in a locked room, all bound and gagged on the floor. To make matters worse there is an intrusive media circus swarming outside the hotel reporting the NSG's known operations and movements, information which the terrorists use. Meanwhile, a guest named Pramoda Reddy, who is trapped on the fifth floor, manages to keep herself hidden from the gunmen. She ultimately takes responsibility to rescue British tourist's young daughter, named Shirley. Sandeep talks to Isha over the phone. She is applying for divorce and scolds Sandeep for not being there with her when she had a miscarriage, but she is horrified when she discovers that Sandeep is at the Taj Hotel. As the NSG rescue more hostages (several of whom remain tied up inside a locked banquet hall) and starts closing in on the remaining terrorists, Pramoda calls the downstairs lobby using a walkie-talkie from one of the dead security guards.\nSandeep ultimately decides to go to the 5th floor to save them, saying that he would never be able to forgive himself if he did not save her. His colleagues subsequently use tear gas and Sandeep races up to the 5th floor. He ultimately rescues Pramoda and Shirley and heroically kills some of the terrorists. However, when his CO asks him whether he needs reinforcement or not, he refuses. His last words are \"Do not come up, I will handle them.\" But as fate would have it, he is killed in action, laying down his life for his country. Major Sandeep's parents watch in horror as the news coverage shows that Sandeep was killed in action. They had thought that since Sandeep was a training officer he was not involved in the rescue mission at the Taj Hotel. After his death, there is a large military funeral and a crowd of well-wishers gather to mourn Sandeep's passing. Isha is devastated at Sandeep's death and discovers that he never signed the divorce papers. Later, a 10-year commemoration ceremony in 2018 honoring the lives taken during the attack is held at the Taj Hotel. During the commemorations, Pramoda is reunited with Shirley whose life she had saved.

They meet with an accident due to a falling tree amidst heavy rain, that renders an eye of Nargis to be damaged. Meanwhile, the woman performs Black magic on the brothers and takes assistance from another person to engage in human sacrifice.\nIn 1999, Hyderabad, Mir and Nargis arrive at a building with a group of men, holding a divine Chaadar (blanket) and a dagger. They find few of their acquaintances under control of Black magic, behaving insanely. The next morning, Police find the corpse of the woman tied to the tree, brutally stabbed to death.\nIn 2022, Neelam and her daughter Nazia are tenants in an apartment behind the building, where the woman was murdered and the sole confidant of them is their neighbour Gopi, who is employed in a software company and constantly tries to woo his colleague Mini. Neelam has separated from her abusive husband Abdul several years ago but still pays him not to be involved in their lives while Mir is seen following Nazia and Abdul. Mini and Gopi arrange for a date in Gopi's home but they are interrupted by Neelam, who seeks Gopi's help as Nazia has been behaving weirdly. As Gopi rushes to check on her, Mini leaves disappointed. Horrified by Nazia's strange conduct, Gopi suspects that she is possessed by a ghost and next morning, both of them take Nazia to a psychiartist, who concludes that Nazia's mental condition is quite normal. Neelam and Gopi meet Alauddin, assistant of a popular exorcist Rizwan Baba and Alauddin gives them a Ta'wiz to be tied on Nazia's hand as that would create a positive impact on Nazia's mental state, declaring that her behaviour during that night cannot mean her being really possessed.\nNazia's teacher taunts her for scoring the least score in examinations and marks that Ta'wiz cannot help her study. Agitated, Nazia throws the Ta'wiz allowing the supernatural entity to conquer her mind while Mir visits her at her college, touches her hand and sees several terrifying visions, that causes him to vomit blood and meet with an accident subsequently after leaving the collage. Yuvraj, the son of Neelam and Gopi's landlord finds himself thrown into panic when he spots Nazia eating garbage and conducting herself ghostly. Broken by her daughter's condition, Neelam takes her to a hospital with Gopi's help and the latter brings Alauddin to tie another Ta'wiz for Nazia. However, Nazia turns unmanageable, speaks badly and displays excessive strength trying to resist Alauddin from tying the Ta'wiz but he manages to do so. When he touches Nazia's bracelet, he visualizes horrific events like Mir did and declares that he cannot desist what is haunting Nazia; he insists to meet Rizwan for finding a solution. Doctors suggest that Nazia undergo Electroconvulsive therapy but Neelam opposes the idea and takes her daughter to Rizwan.\nRizwan suggests that a ritual should be performed on Nazia and that would need a man related by blood to her, revealing to Neelam and Gopi that a spirit is trying to possess Nazia. Neelam seeks Abdul but he demands money for attending to their needs. Rizwan visits Nazia and Neelam at their apartment and suspects that something is amiss in the building behind the apartment due to which tours around the place and spots a spirit of the mysterious woman. From Neelam, Rizwan perceives that tenants often use the path through the building due to road blockage. Upon being asked by Rizwan, Gopi inquires land dealers to learn that a woman, Masooda Bi was murdered in that building in 1991 by her husband Khaja and the latter was not found. Mir, Khaja's elder brother arrived seeking the property but left when the Police tried to implicate him in the case. Masooda's corpse, which was buried was also taken away and has not been found. Rizwan informs Neelam that the bracelet, Nazia wears is of the ghost which caused it to impose its control on her. She apparently found the bracelet in the building where Masooda was murdered.  However, as it is dangerous to remove the bracelet now, Rizwan suggests to let it be until the right time comes. Gopi ignores a trip to Goa with Mini for succouring Neelam and Nazia straining his relationship with her while Nazia, under the control of spirit stabs Gopi leaving him terrorized. Upon being compelled by his concerned friend, Gopi refuses to help Neelam, making her all alone. However, Gopi soon realizes his mistake and decides to help them nevertheless what happens. He meets Abdul but the latter demands 50,000 INR for attending the ritual and also accuses Gopi of having an affair with Neelam causing the former to physically assault him.\nGopi later travels to Chittoor for finding further details about Mir and Masooda. Perceiving that Mir died due to an accident recently, he proceeds and meets Nargis who initially denies any help but when he requests them by telling about Nazia, she accepts. Gopi finds a portrait of woman he had seen in Abdul's home in Mir's house too and realizes that the portrait is of Mir's wife and Gopi realizes that Abdul is Mir's son and Nazia: his granddaughter which is unaware to both of them. Nargis narrates that Mir lived with his wife, a very young son, aged father and three loving younger brothers: Khaja, Fardeen and Faizal; all of them lived prosperously by engaging themselves in cultivating sugarcane and trading with horses. The family had adopted an orphaned Nargis, considering her as their own. Fardeen went to Hyderabad for graduating in a university but returned after getting married to Masooda, which was a great disappointment to Mir and Nargis who suspected Masooda of harbouring ill-intentions. Mir soon realized that Masooda was performing Black Magic to attain evil powers and sacrificed humans for it. While he was perplexfully thinking on how to inform this to his family, he perceived that an extra-marital affair was brewing between Masooda and Khaja. Mir tried to warn Khaja but the latter was completely under control of Masooda and refused to listen to him. It took less time for the family and village to discover Masooda's acts which inflicted deadly diseases on the villagers. Fardeen tried to help Faizal escape but they were captured by Masooda, who sacrificed them with Khaja's assistance and desisted Mir and Nargis from interrupting by causing an accident. When they came, it was too late and Masooda and Khaja were nowhere.\nMir swore vengeance on Masooda for disrupting the peace of her family, ignoring his job and family in the process causing his wife and child to abandon him. It took him 10 years to learn what Masooda intended and where she was. Taking a Chaadar and dagger to resist and end her, Mir and Nargis headed to Hyderabad but could not find Khaja in the building. They, however managed to tie Masooda to the tree after a scuffle during which her bracelet falls off her hand but she continued to harm the people, who had accompanied Mir and Nargis using her incantations. Enraged, Mir stabbed Masooda to death. Khaja dug Masooda's grave and took her corpse intending to revive her using the Black Magic he learnt from her but it backfired killing him. Before dying, he informed Mir about the location of Masooda's corpse. Mir buried it in the forest and hid the Chaadar and dagger in the bungalow, where Masooda performed Black Magic.\nPresently, Gopi retrieves the Chaadar and dagger and goes to Rizwan with Nargis. The day of ritual arrives. In Chittoor, Gopi and Neelam have to put the Chaadar on Masooda's corpse by finding it at 2 AM which would weaken her powers and Alauddin would remove the bracelet freeing Nazia from Masooda's control. However, things do not go as planned as Masooda haunts Gopi and Neelam. Nazia frees herself from the shackles and goes on killing one of Rizwan's henchmen and Abdul. She tries to murder Nargis but Alauddin rescues her and they goto in a veranda, locking the door of entry to it. The Chaadar flies off due to wind and clings to a tree due to which Gopi climbs the tree to retrieve it. A tree falls off trapping Neelam's leg but she asks Gopi to let go of her and put the Chaadar on Masooda's corpse. Nazia enters the veranda and tries to murder Nargis after injuring Alauddin. Masooda's spirit attacks Gopi, who amasses great strength and courage to stab the spirit using the dagger and immediately puts the Chaadar on Masooda's corpse weakening its control on Nazia and Nargis removes the bracelet freeing her. The problems come to an end and Rizwan appreciates Gopi and Neelam for their courage.\nGopi narrates the whole story to Mini, who convinced of it reconciles with him but they couple are horrified by Masooda, who begins to haunt them.", "tmdb_id": 1047902}, "71434017": {"title": "Masoom Sawaal", "plot": "The story of the film revolves around the superstitions and regulations imposed on women during their menstrual cycle.", "imdb_id": "tt14986282"}, "63292350": {"title": "Master (2022 film)", "plot": "Gail Bishop becomes the newly-appointed and first Black master of Ancaster, an elite university in New England.

Failing to locate the stone, Kevin, Stuart and Bob leave for San Francisco to rescue Gru, while Otto leaves in pursuit of a biker whom he realizes has the stone as a necklace.

The plan is to deploy a group of new super missiles, called the Cosmic Strike Hammers, to shatter the asteroid and then use the moon to shield Earth from its fragments. Eight years after their launch, the Cosmic Strike Hammers successfully shatter \"\u03c0\"; but one of the missiles was thrown off course by a solar storm, leaving some of the asteroid fragments heading towards the UNMS moon station. The facility is hastily evacuated, and in the chaos Yue is accidentally left behind. Arriving too late to board the last evacuation rocket, he witnesses one major fragment striking Earth, seemingly wiping out all of humanity.\nConsidering himself the only human being left, Yue spends his time living out his unrequited crush on Ma Lanxing, his base commander, not suspecting that some UNMS operators, including Lanxing herself, have been watching him through the station's video surveillance feed. A portion of humanity has survived the disaster in pre-built underground bunkers, but Earth's situation is rendered desperate by a global dust cloud blocking off the Sun's radiation. UNMS chairman Sun Guangyang urges to establish a public livestream link to the station in order to portray Yue as a role model and thus raise hope among the surviving population. Because the audio links to the station have been severed, it is decided to add overdubbing and outside narration.\nYue discovers that he has company in the form of a temperamental red kangaroo named \"King Kong Roo\", left behind by the UNMS research division. Thus, the UNMS' first attempts to portray Yue as a survivalist go comically wrong as the two begin fighting over the station's food stores. During a brief lull, Yue notices some static sounds which leads him to believe that some people on Earth are still alive. He decides to reach some equipment left over from an 18th, abandoned Apollo mission to reach the UNMS space station in the moon's orbit and use an escape capsule to return to Earth. Yue begins repairing the lunar lander, but to initiate liftoff, he needs the first Strike Hammer prototype, which is stored in another station at Lacus Perseverantiae. \nYue and Kong begin a journey on a solar-powered rover to obtain the prototype, and after several mishaps on the way, they make it back to the station. Yue discovers the static sounds were caused by Kong's accidental meddling, making him believe that he has apparently been living on false hopes. Despairing, he abandons his efforts, but Lanxing calls upon humanity's survivors to send him a combined light signal, thus telling him that he is not alone.\nWith his confidence renewed, Yue establishes full audio-visual contact with Earth's UNMS headquarters, who help him in coordinating his repair efforts. In a private moment, Yue confesses to Lanxing that she was the sole reason for him to be hired on the UNMS mission, and a deeply touched Lanxing apologizes for leaving him behind. Yue finally completes the liftoff module and reaches the lunar space station, but just then the UNMS learns that another major fragment of \"\u03c0\", designated \"\u03c0+\", is on a collision course with Earth, threatening to completely annihilate all life on the planet. Overhearing the news, Yue volunteers to guide his lander towards \"\u03c0+\" so that the Strike Hammer's warhead can destroy it, but on his way there he hits leftover debris from \"\u03c0\", which disables the missile's engine. Knowing he is humanity's last hope, he heroically sacrifices himself by personally directing the warhead using his spacesuit's thrusters, destroying \"\u03c0+\".\nOver ten years later, after the dust around the globe has cleared away naturally, human civilization has rebuilt itself and even started advancing beyond its pre-impact levels.

Brian, the only witness to the swarm, returns the crippled shuttle to Earth, but his story is dismissed and he is fired from NASA.\nTen years later, conspiracy theorist K.C. Houseman, who believes that the Moon is an artificial megastructure, secretly uses a research telescope. He discovers that the Moon's orbit is veering closer to Earth, and tries to share his findings with the disgraced Brian.

Jo is now NASA's deputy director, launching a spacecraft on an SLS Block 1 rocket to investigate the abnormality. The same alien swarm attacks, killing all three lunar astronauts after they drop a probe into a kilometers-deep artificial shaft that has opened up on the Moon's surface.\nAs the lunar orbit deteriorates, the Moon falls closer and closer to the Earth, causing seismic and gravitational disturbances. Jo meets former NASA official Holdenfield, who reveals that Brian was discredited due to a NASA coverup dating back to Apollo 11; during the first moon landing, a two-minute radio blackout was meant to conceal evidence of pulsating lights on the surface. Apollo 12 also revealed that the Moon is hollow, and a military EMP device created to kill the swarm was abandoned for budgetary reasons.\nWith help from her ex-husband General Doug Davidson, Air Force Chief of Staff, Jo requisitions the EMP and rescues retired Space Shuttle Endeavour from a museum to serve the new mission: to correct the Moon's orbit and destroy the swarm.

The Dyson sphere's AI operating system explains to Brian that billions of years ago, humanity's technologically advanced ancestors were eradicated by a rogue AI; they built the Moon as an Interstellar ark to create and seed life on Earth, but the swarm \u2014 one of the malicious AIs \u2014 discovered the Moon and is siphoning energy from its power source, destabilizing its orbit.\nMeanwhile, Brian's son Sonny, Jo's son Jimmy, and his caretaker Michelle try to reach Doug's military bunker in the Colorado mountains, finding Brian's ex-wife and Sonny's mother Brenda, her husband Tom, and their step-family. Escaping disasters caused by the Moon's proximity and fighting off other survivors, the group finds safety in a mountain tunnel. When his youngest daughter runs out of oxygen, an injured Tom gives her his own, suffocating to death as the Moon strips away the local atmosphere. The president orders a nuclear strike on the approaching Moon, but Doug refuses to comply, with debris collapsing the bunker shortly thereafter, presumably killing Doug and everyone inside.\nAs the swarm only attacks organic life in the presence of electronic activity, K.C. lures the swarm away from their spacecraft with their lunar module, sacrificing himself to detonate the EMP. Jo and Brian return to Earth, reuniting with their families, and the Moon's power is restored, returning to its regular orbit, but now shed of its rocky exterior.

His fellow pupils describe him as looking older than them and having a deeper voice. One expresses surprise that he has the same enrolment name as Bruce Lee's recently deceased son, Brandon. A former teacher says they understood he had been in a car crash and this was why his skin looked older. His strange accent was explained by his having lived in Canada. A black pupil describes experiencing racism and violence at school but 'Brandon' was friends with him and helped him with homework.\n'Brandon' favoured 80s music but his 'peers' thought this was due to his interest in music history. In class he was incredibly knowledgeable - he doesn't try to play down what he knows to fit in. In the present MacKinnon says his IQ was described as being 158 when he was aged eight. We are not told why he is attending school as a 30 year old. MacKinnon's deception is not revealed until around halfway through the film, at the point in the story at which MacKinnon's peers discover it, effectively positioning the audience in their point of view. The film also withholds any contemporary photographs or footage of MacKinnon before this point.McLeod interviewed some of MacKinnon's classmates and teachers, often in pairs, and they, along with MacKinnon himself, embodied by Alan Cumming, provide much of the film's narration. Interviews were conducted on sets designed to resemble the classrooms of Bearsden (the actual schoolhouse having been demolished years earlier).The story is also told via cartoon recreations voiced by professional voice actors, including the Scottish actresses Clare Grogan and Lulu. The visual style of these cartoon sequences has been compared by a number of commentators to the animated sitcom Daria, which aired on MTV between 1997 and 2002. These cartoons sequences are scored with contemporary pop music.There is a discussion of the school production of South Pacific, where he played Lieutenant Cable, ironically shown singing \"Younger Than Springtime\".  He was a good singer with an appropriate accent which is why he was cast. He shared a kiss with his 16-year-old co-star. Several contributors describe his reluctance to kiss her in rehearsals and say it was like a 'peck' and another says 'no tongues!' The girl kissed, now an adult, demonstrates a close-lipped brief kiss and laughs about it. The musical is seen to be very successful and 'Brandon's' social cachet increases. He also drives a car.\nFriends go to 'Brandon's' home and meet his grandmother. His mother (an opera singer) is already dead when a call comes to school to tell him that his father has now died. He gains sympathy. Later he takes his exams and gets A's and accepts a place at medical school. His teachers advise him to wait a year as he is still 'young' for university but he ignores them and goes to University of Dundee School of Medicine. However, he drops out and five friends come round to ask why. He says his gran has died so he is taking time out. Later, Jemma invites him on a group holiday with Cheryl and Nicola. 'Brandon' ends up in a fight and is arrested - the police find he has two passports. This is the official story of how MacKinnon was found out.\nHis former head teacher invites MacKinnon in and confronts him with the 1975 report card for Brian MacKinnon which also shows top grades. From here the story makes the six o'clock news. About half the teachers there had taught him in the 70s. The explanation for MacKinnon's deception was that, at that time, a person could not study medicine over the age of thirty, so he had returned to school to get into medical school again. He had been expelled after his first acceptance after becoming ill and failing his first year exams, he says.\nIt is then revealed that his 'grandmother' was alive but was actually his mother. It is also revealed that the fight on holiday, the police, and the two passports were a rumour not what happened. Apparently, he told the girls he was 32 and asked them to keep it a secret. Nicola says the holiday continued but it seemed bizarre that he had wanted to go on holiday with them. She thinks she gets his real life story - and what happened in the 70s during his first time at school.\nNear the end video footage of the school play is shown. None of the participants have seen it before. They note that 'Brandon's' singing is poor. The kiss is shown and it lasts several seconds and then has a second kiss. All the participants are shocked and the girl who was kissed (now an adult) is visibly uncomfortable.\nAnother question raised is whether MacKinnon's gran/mum knew what was going on. Initially, former pupils think no, as for the two to conspire seemed sinister. However, they acknowledge that she had allowed herself to be called gran, and a teacher also realises that she had called the school as his gran to say 'Brandon's' father had died. (This was to get him out of a Physics test). So, she knew.\nThe film concludes by saying that MacKinnon continues to apply for a place at medical school and cuts a sad figure in town. The former pupils are shown in their real-life adult jobs, or with their children, looking happy and engaged with the future rather than the past. It is suggested that MacKinnon may have decided to try again and may have undergone cosmetic surgery to alter his appearance.", "tmdb_id": 913867}, "65349261": {"title": "My Policeman (film)", "plot": "Retirees Marion and Tom live in the English seaside town of Peacehaven.

One tick remains and attaches to the nape of her neck. \nEight months later, Christine is debilitated by a mysterious illness that has crippled her work and family life. After returning home from a failed pitch to her designer firm, Tykie Couture, Christine is startled by a spoon falling to the floor at the same time a woman named Diana (Chai Fonacier), who claims to be the caregiver that Christine has hired but seemingly forgot about - arrives at her door.  Christine's husband, Felix, and daughter, Bobs, are both distrustful of Diana, a stranger now suddenly living with their family. Bobs demands that  Diana call her by her full name, Roberta, as they are not friends. Meanwhile, Christine and Felix argue about Diana, which she overhears from the vents in her room. \nDiana unpacks her suitcase, revealing a collection of relics and folk magic ingredients. She uses a matchbox to summon and capture the tick that bit Christine, then assembles an altar in her bedroom fireplace. Diana uses the fireplace ashes in a ritual to commune with the unseen spirit of a child. \nWith Christine's condition worsening, Diana volunteers to make dinner for the family, cooking a Visayan dish called humba, sprinkling into it a concoction of herbs previously shown at her altar. During dinner Christine gets sudden pains in her arms after reaching for a glass, and Diana comes to her aid, insisting she can \"make it go away\". Diana cures Christine's pain by hovering her hands over the painful area, then tickling her until the pain is gone.\nFeeling better after the treatment, Christine drives Bobs to school with Diana in the car with them to learn the way. However, Christine experiences sudden amnesia and forgets the route; Diana then suggests that they all walk instead, and asks Bobs to lead the way. As Christine laments over her illness, Diana offers to get rid of it for her, explaining that she posesses some therapeutic power that could help cure Christine. \nDiana recounts the story of when she was a little girl. One night during a rainstorm, an old woman, who was very sick, stopped by her house to seek shelter. While Diana's parents were preparing some food and medicine to soothe the visitor's condition, it occurred to her that the old woman was an Ongo, and her power needed transfer to another upon her death. As Diana approached her, a black featherless chick exited the woman's mouth and entered Diana's. Since then, Diana inherited supernatural therapeutic powers that enabled her to heal all types of illnesses; however, while she was often called to heal people in her Filipino community, her ability also drove friends and acquaintances away because they regarded her as a witch. \nRegardless of her skepticism, Christine begins allowing Diana to treat her; the results prove to be successful as Christine becomes healthier and livelier each day. When Christine discovers her medications are missing she initially confronts Diana about it, but becomes confused when Diana tells her that she is suffering from memory loss again, and it was Christine herself who disposed of the drugs.\nAlthough things have improved tremendously, Felix remains dubious of Diana's method and motives. Late one night, he makes a decision to speak directly with Diana in her room and order her to stay away from his wife because her illness is psychosomatic from past guilt. Diana, however, refuses and she suggests that Felix leave her bedroom, adding ominously that he should be careful with the stairs.

Diana reveals that she isn't curing Christine, but rather forcing her to face her judgement with a hex.

Leena grows fond of Allen after they both start bonding over their painting skills and tries to separate him from Tricia.\nWhile Tricia and Allen attend a charity gala hosted by Tricia, Donnan arrives at the house and steals a vinyl record from Esther's room which has Leena's fingerprints on it. He takes it back to his house, unaware that Leena has followed him, and analyzes the fingerprints to find it is not a match. Leena attacks Donnan before Tricia arrives, having followed Leena. Surprisingly, Tricia shoots him dead. Tricia reveals that she knows Leena is not Esther, who died four years earlier during an altercation with Tricia's son Gunnar, which Tricia covered up without Allen's knowledge. Leena reveals her true identity to Tricia, and the two then dispose of Donnan's body in a cellar hatch where Esther was buried and frame his disappearance as a vacation trip by forging an email to the police station.\nKnowing that it would be too suspicious if \"Esther\" were to disappear again, Tricia agrees to continue Leena's act for Allen's sake, and Leena and Tricia remain on guard with each other. Tricia eventually attempts to poison Leena during dinner, but Leena refuses to eat the food and excuses herself. Leena feeds the food to the rat that lives in her room and later finds the rodent dead from ingesting the poisoned meal. Leena retaliates by making a green smoothie mixed with the rodent's carcass for Tricia. Allen reveals he is going into the city to meet about a potential art gallery. At the train station, Leena attempts to kill Tricia and Gunnar by pushing them in front of a train, but her attempt is accidentally interrupted by a passing commuter. With Allen away, Leena tries fleeing by stealing Tricia's car, but she is soon found by a police officer.\nThat night, Leena is brought back to the Albright house and Tricia and Gunnar finally decide to kill Leena. Tricia tries to stage a suicide, but Leena fights back and flees before Gunnar throws her down the stairs. Distracted by a phone call from Allen, who is returning home, Tricia and Gunnar search for Leena when she disappears. Leena shoots Gunnar with a crossbow, then stabs him to death with his fencing sword.

Unable to save both of them, Allen chooses to help \"Esther\", causing Tricia to lose her grip and fall to her death. Allen then checks Leena's face, which causes her fake teeth to fall out. Realizing she is not Esther, Leena tries to defend herself saying \"she did it for them\" and that she \"loves Allen\", only for Allen to call her a \"monster\". Enraged, she pushes him off the roof to his death.

Also, marks on Fry's neck and fingers suggest that he did not hang himself, but was murdered.\nLandor secretly enlists the help of Edgar Allan Poe, another cadet at the academy, who has expressed an interest in the case. Poe and Landor deduce from the writing on the note fragment that it was summoning Fry to a secret meeting. After a cow and a sheep are found in the area, butchered and with their hearts removed, it is deduced that the murder could be linked to black magic rituals.\nAnother cadet, Ballinger, goes missing and is later found hanged, with both his heart and his genitals removed. A third cadet, Stoddard, who was a colleague of the two victims, then disappears, and it is presumed by Landor that this man had reason to believe he was next in line to be killed.\nLandor and Poe begin to suspect the family of Dr. Daniel Marquis, who was first brought into the investigation to perform the autopsy on Fry. Particular suspicion is placed on his son Artemus and his daughter Lea (who suffers from random seizures). While visiting Dr. Marquis's house, Landor finds an old officer's uniform; a man impersonating an officer had been involved in the mutilation of Fry's body. Landor confronts Dr. Marquis, who admits that he had resorted to black magic to cure Lea of her seizures, and initially she appeared to improve.\nPoe is enchanted by Lea and volunteers to do whatever she wants. However, he is drugged and wakes to find that Artemus and Lea are about to cut out his heart, in accordance with the ritual to cure Lea. Landor manages to arrive in time to rescue Poe, but the building catches fire and Lea and Artemus die.\nThinking that the case is now solved, the military thanks Landor for his service. However, after recovering from his near-death experience, Poe confronts Landor with his realization that the handwriting on the note fragment found in Fry's hand matches that of Landor. Threading together all the information that he has gathered, it becomes apparent that Landor was in fact the killer of the cadets. \nTwo years previously, Landor's daughter Mattie was raped by Fry, Ballinger, and Stoddard after attending her first ball. Traumatized by the experience, she later killed herself by jumping off a cliff. Landor did not disclose this to anyone, but pretended that she had run away.\nDistraught, Landor set out to avenge his daughter. He left the note for Fry, luring him to a lonely spot before hanging him. However, a patrol happened to walk by, so Landor was forced to leave the body there. Lea and Artemus later stole the heart for their ritual. After killing Ballinger, Landor mutilated his corpse to make it appear that the cadet had been murdered by the same \"madman\" who had desecrated Fry's body. \nPoe tells Landor he has two notes with handwriting samples that can link Landor directly to the murders, but before leaving, Poe burns them. Landor is later seen standing at the cliff where his daughter leapt to her death. He lets her hair ribbon float away in the wind, saying \"Rest, my love\".", "tmdb_id": 800815}, "69190772": {"title": "Palmira (film)", "plot": "The film is set in May, 2016.

At the village, one of their tribe's hunters has been taken by a mountain lion. Taabe says Naru can come on the search party, but only to help track the cougar and provide medical treatment if they find the hunter alive. They retrieve the wounded hunter and depart, though Taabe stays behind to find and kill the mountain lion. Finding large unusual tracks and a meticulously skinned rattlesnake, Naru circles back with Paake and finds Taabe. Together the three set a trap for the mountain lion but it kills Paake.\nNaru faces off with the big cat on the branch of a tree but, after being distracted by the strange sounds and lights of the Predator in the distance, falls and strikes her head. She wakes up in her family home, having been carried back by Taabe. He later returns to the village carrying the dead mountain lion, earning him the title of War Chief. Convinced of a greater threat they've never seen before, Naru departs with Sarii. She comes across a herd of skinned bison left to rot on the plains; baffled by the wasteful slaughter, she says a prayer for their spirits. Eventually, she stumbles into a mud-filled bog pit, which nearly swallows her before she escapes. Naru and Sarii are later attacked by a grizzly bear. As they flee for their lives, the bear is killed by the Predator, giving Naru time to escape before running into a group of Comanche sent to find her. The Predator ambushes and kills the men in combat, while Naru is caught in a foothold trap; the Predator leaves as it no longer sees her as a threat.\nFrench voyageurs, responsible for slaughtering the bison, come to check their trap, find Naru, and cage her. Their interpreter, Raphael Adolini, questions Naru about the Predator, whom the Frenchmen have encountered before.

Naru rescues Sarii from the camp and stumbles across a dying Raphael, who teaches her how to use his flintlock pistol in exchange for medical treatment for his severed leg. Naru gives him herbs that reduce his body heat to stanch the bleeding. When the Predator arrives, Raphael plays dead, and Naru realizes that, due to his reduced heat, the creature cannot see him. After it accidentally steps on Raphael, he screams, and the Predator kills him.\nTaabe arrives on horseback to rescue Naru. Together they weaken the Predator, but it kills Taabe. Naru flees and finds the surviving lead Frenchman. She knocks him out, severs one of his legs, and gives him an unloaded gun before eating the herbs to hide her body heat, baiting the Predator to kill the voyageur. She uses Raphael's pistol to ambush the creature, knocking off its mask, which she has previously seen to hold the targeting system for the Predator's spear gun. She steals the device and flees into the woods. Naru uses the Frenchman's severed leg to lure the Predator into the area with the mud-filled bog pit, where she has positioned the creature's mask so that it targets the pit. Without the mask, the Predator is less effective, so Naru injures it significantly before dragging it into the bog. As the Predator rises from the pit, it fires the spear gun at Naru and misses; the projectile homes in on the Predator, killing it.

He initially rejects the offer, not having studied the bridge himself, but after being promised a promotion, he submits a report stating that \"Ramayana is an epic fiction, not history\" and questions the existence of Rama. Thus, he is met with complete hostility. In court, the government is humiliated by the report, submitted as an affidavit, as it questions the existence of Rama, and the public is furious. The consequences lead to Aryan getting suspended temporarily. And the hostility later led to Aryan's son's bullying in school and Aryan first hand witnesses the hostility shown by the bully's parents. \nMeanwhile, Aryan also gets an offer from a rich businessman, Indrakant, who wants the Rama Setu demolished for good. He tries to persuade Aryan to join an archaeological exploration and research for the Rama Setu. He rejects it, fearing more hostility from the public, but after remembering the incident with his son, he decides to prove the \"truth\". Aryan hence, accepts the mission and meets fellow scientists, Dr. Sandra Rebello and Dr. Gabrielle, who are assigned to work with him.

This is not enough for Aryan, so he decides to bring another floating rock from the Rama Setu and uses carbon dating to find its age. He also visits deep underwater and finds the coral reefs. This starts to prove that Rama Setu is indeed man-made, about 7000 years ago, and has a possibility of being built by Rama. He reports this to Indrakant, who appreciates Aryan's impartiality towards the mission. However, Indrakant only wants the proof that Rama Setu is older than Rama and hence it is not built by him, so that they can demolish the structure and save money and fuel for their project.

P. J. Abdul Kalam, one of his team members from a major injury during an experiment. In 1969, he is accepted into Princeton University in the US.\nNambi successfully completes his MSE program in chemical rocket propulsion under professor Luigi Crocco who recommends him for the NASA fellowship. However, after a brief stint at NASA with Barry Amaldev, he is offered a generous paycheck and other allowances. He rejects it and returns to India so that he may make use of his talents at ISRO. Subsequently, he also manages to get 400 million pounds of equipment from Scotland for free. However, after the suspicious death of Vikram Sarabhai, he did not have adequate support from ISRO or funds from the Indian government to continue his research.\nAt this point, Nambi strikes a deal with the French who need skilled scientists to help them build their own liquid fuel engine. He then moves to France with his colleagues, hoping to learn from France's advanced technology so that they may recreate it back in India. Unbeknownst to the French, Nambi and his 52 colleagues have learnt French before their journey but pretend to not understand them. After being kept out of their major discussions, Nambi's team tries to find a way to gain access to these meetings and test data. It is then that they discover that the French engine is faulty. Nambi uses this opportunity to gain access to the required data in exchange for fixing the engine. The team then returns to India and start working on building their own engine on liquid fuels. However, due to lack of resources, it takes 8 more years to complete. They test the engine at the same testing facility in France - it goes above the 135 pressure mark, and goes all the way to 180. Successful in his plans, Nambi returns to India after naming the engine VIKAS after Vikram Sarabhai, his mentor.\nNambi's focus is now on cryogenic engines which he believes will make India competent to participate in the world satellite market. Knowing ISRO's limitations in terms of time and resources, Nambi decides to purchase these engines from some other country. He strikes a deal with Russia (then USSR) after informing them that he knows about their cryogenic missiles, told to him by his Russian friend in Princeton. He requests 4 of them to be imported to India. After the Russians agree, the Americans find out about this deal and try their best to break it. While USSR is on the brink of collapse, Nambi and his colleagues manage to expedite the transfer process and sneak out a couple of engines from under the Americans' nose with the help of the Russians. \nBack in India, Nambi is arrested out of the blue while news of his treason spreads like wildfire. He is taken to a guest house in Trivandrum where he is beaten and tortured in an attempt to make him confess to his alleged crimes. He also recognizes that the officials are trying to make him repeat their sentences and that there is a recording device in the room to capture it. However, Nambi holds his ground and denies all charges. It was alleged that Nambi met Mariam, a Maldivian woman, in a hotel in Chennai and after being caught in her trap, he was forced to sell India's rocketry secrets to Pakistan. After being hospitalized due to his injuries, Nambi is met by CBI official P. M. Nair, who thoroughly investigates the matter. Nair brings Mariam and her friend, along with a few others into the room. Mariam and her friend reveal that the Kerala police officer in charge of the investigation, Gopal, tortured and threatened them and made them falsely incriminate Nambi, whom they have never met before. They also apologize to Nambi for ruining his reputation and causing pain to him and his family. Nair also figures out that all the accused in this case were members of ISRO's cryogenic wing, and concludes that it was a huge ploy by some powerful parties to hinder India's progress in the cryogenic sector. \nMonths later, Nambi receives bail and returns to his house to find his family members traumatized by the way they were treated by others. Nambi's wife Meena is in need of psychiatric help and the rest of his family are still shunned by the society.

Spencer explains that she optioned The Mousetrap's film rights to Woolf, but he would be contractually unable to produce the adaptation until the show had closed.\nAt a pub, Stoppard bonds with Stalker and reveals that his unfaithful wife left him after having a child with another man. Driving a drunken Stoppard home, Stalker finds news articles and a picture of his ex-wife, fitting Mervyn's description of a \"homely woman with glasses\". Combined with Dennis' description, this leads Stalker to suspect Stoppard may be the killer, and she searches for his ex-wife in K\u00f6pernick's address book.\nStoppard and Stalker attend a performance of The Mousetrap, during which Mervyn, Woolf, Dennis, Gio and Stoppard leave the auditorium; Stalker soon follows after watching Stoppard retrieve his gloves. In the foyer, Mervyn is strangled to death by a gloved figure. Stalker spots Stoppard kneeling over the body and gives chase, knocking him unconscious with a snow shovel.\nStoppard awakens in a cell, and Stalker and Scott accuse him of carrying out the murders. Stalker has summoned Joyce, the mother of K\u00f6pernick's son, but she is not Stoppard's ex-wife, exonerating him. Stalker escorts Joyce and her son home, and Joyce mentions overhearing a man with a \"village idiot\" accent. Reading through Mervyn's research on The Mousetrap, Stoppard realises the identity of the killer and races to the suspect's apartment, where Stalker has already burst inside and found the necessary evidence: the killer is Dennis.  \nAttenborough, Sim, Woolf, Ann, Spencer and her elderly mother arrive at the home of Agatha Christie in Wallingford, Berkshire, having received invitations to dinner. The butler Fellowes is perplexed by their arrival, but Christie's husband, Max Mallowan, allows them inside. The group are held at gunpoint by Dennis, whom Spencer's mother recognises as Dennis Corrigan, an abused child whose brother's death inspired the plot of The Mousetrap. Dennis explains that he killed K\u00f6pernick and Mervyn in an attempt to stop the play and its adaptation, disgusted by the exploitation of his brother's tragedy for entertainment.\nHaving forged the invitations to lure everyone together, Dennis has captured Edana, mistaking her for Christie. Christie enters with tea, including a poisoned cup for Dennis which Fellowes inadvertently drinks instead. An armed Stoppard arrives and a shootout ensues; Sim distracts Dennis with a molotov cocktail, and Stalker nearly takes a bullet to save Stoppard, matching K\u00f6pernick's story pitch, before Agatha dispatches Dennis with a shovel. It is revealed that the bullet did, in fact, hit Stoppard, though the shot was not fatal.

When Afreen repudiates, Mehta asks her to pay a compensation of 10 lakhs INR within a month or else she will be sent to prison. Afreen undertakes an initiative to reconcile with her estranged grandfather Abu Tariq, former Brigadier of Pakistani Army and take money from him. Hence, she flies to Karachi, Pakistan only to learn that he died of illness a few days ago and she, herself is supposed to deliver a letter of Indian Army Lieutenant Ram, written in 1965 to Sita Mahalakshmi of Hyderabad, India which her grandfather could not deliver by means of post. According to Tariq's will, she would inherit his wealth only after the letter is delivered to Sita. Left with no choice, Afreen goes to Noor Jahan Palace, Hyderabad where the letter is intended but realizes that the palace was donated by its princess Noor Jahan for higher education of girls twenty years ago.\nAfreen reluctantly enlists the help of her Indian senior Balaji and meets Subramanyam, an accountant who worked at the palace for Nawab for about forty years and inquires about Sita but he doesn't remember anyone with that name employed in the palace. Afreen decides to chase the details about Ram believing that it could lead them to Sita and from a military's library, she collects details about Ram's regiment and meets his regiment-mate Vikas Varma in Anantapuram with Balaji. Vikas narrates to the duo that in 1965, the brainwashed teenagers established themselves as the natives of Kashmir and inadvertently, Ansari leaked their details through a spy to the Indian Army Major Selvan, who ordered Ram's superior Vishnu Sharma to assassinate them despite Ram's protests. After the teenagers, except for one were killed, Ansari triggered a religious riot in Kashmir by provoking Kashmiri Muslims against the Indian Army, accusing the latter of murdering the teenagers and suspecting them just because they were Muslims. Agitated Kashmiri Muslims boycotted the Indian Army and proceeded to burn Agarta, a place where Kashmiri Pandits lived. Ram managed to gather all the Hindus at a safe place along with his regiment mates and by exposing Ansari's conspiracy, cleared the misinterpretation of Muslims causing them to put off the fire and apologize. For their act, Ram and his companions were appreciated and a reporter Vijayalakshmi arrived at their base to interview them. \nPerceiving that Ram was an orphan with none to even write to him, Vijayalakshmi asked everyone on the radio to send their love for Ram, with herself writing a letter to him addressing him as her son. As a result, Ram began to receive several letters while one of them from Sita Mahalakshmi fascinated him. Sita claimed that she was married to Ram and recollected several incidents of their marriage, that never happened. However, there was no sender's address on the letter leaving Ram unaware of who she was and how she looked. While receiving letters regularly from her, Ram figured it out that she would board a train to Hyderabad from Delhi through few details in one of her letters and boarded the same train with Vikas. He eventually found her and recognized her using a riddle she posed for him in a letter, gave her the replies he had written to her letters and left her compartment not before telling her to call the landline of his friend Durjoy Sharma of Hyderabad, with whom he would be staying for next few days. Ram and Vikas unintentionally boarded a train to Madras and hence, it took them some time to reach Hyderabad, where Ram was broken to realize that Durjoy's landline was dead and felt disappointed thinking that he could not meet Sita again. However, she arrived at Durjoy's house searching for Ram asking him to forget her but he refused and she left without telling him who she was. \nNow, Vikas reveals to Afreen and Balaji that he could not meet Ram after that due to his personal problems and gives them Durjoy's address and Vishnu's contact. Afreen makes a phone call to Vishnu through an telephone booth at a bus station but is compelled to disconnect the call as the bus to Hyderabad is about to leave. Curious that someone wants to know about Ram, Vishnu mysteriously postpones his plans to search for Afreen. The latter meets Durjoy and learns what happened after Sita left. \nRam and Durjoy went for a magic show, which Sita said she wanted Ram to take her to in one of her letters. They successfully managed to find Sita and Ram conversed with her friend Rekha, who disclosed that Sita was the Bharatanatyam teacher to Princess Noor Jahan. Ram and Sita began to spend time with each other and Ram eventually learnt that he rescued Sita from riots in Agarta, that's when she had fallen in love with his benevolent nature. Ram dared to fool the accountant Subramanyam to get into the palace and meet Sita, whom he proposed but she left yet again as something interrupted her from accepting the proposal. Currently, Durjoy gives Afreen and Balaji a photo of Sita which Ram clicked from his camera which Afreen takes to Subramanyam for him to identify her but realizes through a portrait in the palace that Sita is in fact Princess Noor Jahan. \nAfreen and Balaji meet Rekha, who reveals that Noor was in love with Ram but her destiny prevented her from accepting him. As her family's assets in Oman were captured due to the financial crisis, her brother engineered a truce offering to get her married to the Prince of Oman. Rekha advised Noor to divulge about her identity to Ram and she intended to do it by accompanying him to his family, who wrote him letters. However, during those days, Noor felt attached to Ram and could not reveal her identity while left for Kashmir not before expecting Sita to go with him but she could not as the Prince of Oman accepted to marry her. Unbeknownst to them, a journalist Marthandam clicked their pictures and published them in the newspaper publicizing Noor Jahan's affair with a common man. When the Prince of Oman requested for an explanation from Noor through an ambassador, Noor's brother asked her to say that she had nothing to do with Ram but she imparted that she was in love with Ram and was ready to give her property up for him. She left for Kashmir despite receiving opposition from her brother and without passing on about her true identity, she spent a few days with Ram and got acquainted with his colleagues and superiors. Now, Rekha gives Noor's contact to Afreen and Balaji, who learn that she is in Kashmir and leave to meet her over there. Upon landing in Kashmir, Afreen is apprehended by Vishnu who tells her the rest of the story.\nSita and Ram engaged in an unexpected dinner with Vishnu and his wife Vaidehi when the survived Pakistani teenager attempted to murder Vishnu, who was rescued by Ram. Ram convinced the teenager of Ansari's intentions, got to know about his whereabouts and promised the teenager that he would protect his sister Waheeda from Ansari's clutches. Brigadier Y.K. Joshi and Major Selvan assigned Vishnu, Ram and few other officers on a covert mission to assassinate Ansari off the record and declared that the one who wouldn't return would be declared as deserted soldiers of the army. Bidding a tearful bye to Sita who wanted to tell him the truth once he returned, Ram departed for his mission and along with his team, managed to successfully kill Ansari in Pakistan. However, while trying to rescue Waheeda from fire, Ram and Vishnu were arrested by the then-Army General Abu Tariq, who was compassionate towards both of them and requested the Indian diplomat Rahul Varma to trade the Pakistani prisoners in India with Ram and Vishnu. However, the Pakistani Army only wanted to release one of the two and eventually, Vishnu was sent to India at Ram's behest. At present, Vishnu reveals to Afreen that post that incident, Pakistani army orchestrated attacks on Indian Army Bases in Kashmir killing 32 soldiers which made the army to presume that Ram was a traitor and Sita had to bear the humiliation for that misinterpretation. However, Vishnu expresses his trust in Ram and also discloses to Afreen that she is Waheeda, whom Ram tried to protect and because of whom he was separated from Sita. Afreen is devastated. \nMeanwhile, Balaji delivers the letter to Sita, who has been living her life with Ram's memories and through the letters, learns that the Pakistani Army put a condition to Ram and Vishnu that who would reveal the details about Indian Army bases in Kashmir would be released. When Ram refused to, Vishnu gave in to protect Vaidehi and his children from the terrorists. This was why he has been living his life in regret, stopped Afreen and does not want the letter to be delivered to Sita. Sita learns that Ram was executed in the prison through the letter and distraught, she also finds a newspaper clipping attached to it that was published by Marthandam revealing that Ram knew who Sita was but did not care about her religion; such was his love. Sita, through the letter exposes Vishnu causing an inquiry committee to be set up on him and goes to meet Afreen, to whom she reveals that Ram is dead. Afreen blames herself and hugs Sita. While Vishnu shoots himself with his service revolver out of disgrace, Sita receives a medal for Ram's patriotism from the President of India with Afreen restoring his reputation in the army.\nAfreen is revealed to have apologized to Mehta and also has 18 prisoners of India released from Pakistan's prison.", "tmdb_id": 894803}, "72790756": {"title": "Siya (film)", "plot": "The film is about a small town girl, Siya who fought for justice against all odds and start protest against the vicious system."}, "72365230": {"title": "Skinamarink", "plot": "In 1995, four-year-old Kevin injures himself in what his six-year-old sister Kaylee says is a sleepwalking incident.

Feeling betrayed, she angrily tells him off, saying that she had trusted him. Holly compares Rose's behavior to their abusive late mother who died of a drug overdose, which Rose witnessed as a child. An enraged Rose responds that Holly knows nothing of what happened.\nRose's hallucinations intensify. Joel discovers that nearly all the witnesses died within a week of seeing the previous suicide, thus finding out himself Rose is cursed. The exception was Robert Talley, who instead murdered someone else. Rose and Joel visit him in jail, where he claims that the entity feeds on trauma, and the only way to escape it is to kill someone in front of a witness to traumatize them, passing the entity to them. Rose angrily rejects the option and leaves.\nShe is confronted at home by the entity in Madeline's form, where it gleefully warns her that she is running out of time. She impulsively drives to her hospital with a knife, planning to murder Carl in front of someone to pass the entity to them. But she decides she can't go through with it. Morgan notices her with the knife, but she speeds away, prompting him to alert the police.\nRose drives to her abandoned family home, realizing that she cannot pass on the entity if she remains alone. Rose confronts the entity in the form of her mother, and it's revealed that as a child, Rose found her mother as she was dying from a drug overdose, but decided not to get help. The entity attacks Rose, who has a hallucination.\nSoon Joel pulls up, having tracked Rose's phone. The entity rips off its own skin to reveal its true form \u2013 a skinless humanoid creature whose body is made from the previous victims that it consumed, with multiple sets of malformed jaws, nesting within an enormous, smiling mouth. The sight of the entity's true form is so frighteningly traumatic to Rose that it causes her to have a nervous breakdown and she falls into a trauma-induced paralysis. Having succeeded at finally breaking Rose's mind, the entity proceeds to feed on her culminated trauma by forcing itself inside her body through her mouth and merges with her psyche. Joel breaks down the front door only to see Rose set herself on fire with a smile, passing the curse onto him.", "tmdb_id": 882598}, "65798434": {"title": "Sneakerella", "plot": "In Queens, teenage El works in his late mother's shoe store \"Laces\", now run by his stepfather Trey, who overworks El instead of his stepbrothers Zelly and Stacy.

Rear Admiral Chester \"Hammer\" Cain plans to cancel Maverick's hypersonic \"Darkstar\" scramjet program in favor of funding drones. To save the program, Maverick unilaterally changes the target speed for that day's test from Mach 9 to the final contract specification of Mach 10. However, the prototype is destroyed when he cannot resist pushing beyond Mach 10. Iceman again saves Maverick's career by assigning him to the Top Gun school at NAS North Island for his next assignment but as Maverick is leaving, Cain tells him that the era of crewed fighter aircraft will soon be over.\nThe Navy has been tasked with destroying an unsanctioned uranium enrichment plant, located in an underground bunker at the end of a canyon, before it becomes operational. It is heavily defended by surface-to-air missile (SAM) batteries, GPS jammers, and fifth-generation Su-57 fighters as well as older F-14 Tomcats. Maverick devises a plan employing two pairs of F/A-18E/F Super Hornets armed with laser-guided bombs, but instead of participating in the strike, he is to train an elite group of Top Gun graduates assembled by Air Boss Vice Admiral Beau \"Cyclone\" Simpson.\nMaverick dogfights his skeptical students and effortlessly defeats them, winning their respect.

Rooster, unaware of the promise, angrily and deeply resents Maverick for dropping his Naval Academy application\u2014impeding his military career\u2014and blames him for his father's death. Maverick is reluctant to further interfere with Rooster's career, but the alternative is to send him on the extremely dangerous mission. He tells his doubts to Iceman, who has terminal throat cancer. Iceman, just before dying, advises that \"It's time to let go\" and reassures him that both the Navy and Rooster need Maverick.\nAfter Iceman dies, Cyclone removes Maverick as instructor following a training incident in which an F/A-18F is lost. Cyclone relaxes the mission parameters, so they are easier to execute but make escape much more difficult. During Cyclone's announcement, Maverick makes an unauthorized flight through the course with his preferred parameters, proving that it can be done.

Leigh (Alexxis Lemire) and Jordan (Abby Quinn), singer and songwriter, respectively, together constitute the Nashville band \u201cTorn Hearts.\u201d On the rise, they are looking for a break on the tour of a famed country singer, Caleb Crawford (Shiloh Fernandez), who, after Jordan hooks up with him for a night, tells her that the tour is \u201call-guys.\u201d With this chance gone, Jordan talks Leigh into approaching their idol, Harper Dutch (Katey Sagal), of the Dutch Sisters, whose address Jordan got from Caleb, and recording a song with her.\nAfter reaching the old and worn-out Dutch manor, Leigh and Jordan receive an odd welcome from Harper Dutch. Her sister Hope Dutch (the other half of their band, the Dutch Sisters), was murdered when they were young and famous, after which Harper left singing. While Leigh and Jordan have a motive of their own, Harper, too, has a motive of her own, one that isn\u2019t as virtuous. There\u2019s booze, there\u2019s bad blood. In the second half of the film, we see how Harper is able to spark a fight between Leigh and Jordan by poking at their difference of opinions. It is interesting and bizarre to see how two long-time friends, no less than sisters, also have so much to tell about each other. This is not to say that Harper was successful in executing her plan, but is rather proof that Leigh and Jordan accepted their criticisms of each other, compromised for one another, and chose to stay together because they both loved the same thing, music, and knew that they were better off together. Furthermore, Leigh even admitted to Harper that she \u201cpicked\u201d Jordan after \u201cfour or five\u201d girls. This is where Harper connects with her and not Jordan, as she says towards the end when both the girls are pointing guns at her. Just like Leigh knew that she wouldn\u2019t have achieved whatever she had without Jordan, Harper, too, knew that without Hope, success wouldn\u2019t have come to her. Then, finally, at the end of the film, it is Jordan who shoots and kills Harper, but by then, Harper has already been able to plant the \u201cstory\u201d seed inside Leigh\u2019s head. Leigh\u2019s shooting of Jordan only ascertains the fact that Leigh\u2019s want for fame was much more than her love for Jordan. This was pretty much the case with Harper too, who wanted fame and found it in the \u201cstory\u201d that made the news after the death of Hope Dutch, which is a traditional trend. Whenever a popular singer passes away, his or her songs reclaim the top spots on the charts. With Jordan dead, Leigh, too, would have a tragic story to tell the world that would make more people listen to their songs and thus make her popular. But this doesn\u2019t happen.  Before Leigh can leave the Dutch manor, a fatally wounded Jordan shoots Leigh, and they both die. Perhaps the end is befitting for the \u201cTorn Hearts\u201d duo as they both lose their lives at each other\u2019s hands, just like they were earning fame together.

Desperate for answers, the Norwegian government recruits a diverse array of scientists, including Nora, who is now a paleontologist on her first major find. While the collected scientists initially believe that the eruption was caused by the miners hitting a pocket of Methane, only Nora and the prime minister\u2019s advisor, Andreas Isaksan, point out that the region is surrounded by large impressions that appear to be footprints. The prime minister permits them to investigate the possibility further with Norwegian military soldier, Captain Kris Holm, when a second incident miles away tears apart the home of an elderly couple near Lesja.\nNora begins to believe that a Troll may be responsible and the three seek assistance from Tobias, who has since lost his professorship for his belief in the existence of a real basis for mythical creatures.

When Nora's father got too close to the truth, Sinding had him discredited and committed to a mental health hospital. The Royal palace was built on top of the Troll King's palace after the Christians massacred his family and left him for dead inside a cavern in the Dovre mountains.

Only the scientists of the citadels know the details of this process.\nVesper is a 13-year old girl who lives in a house in the forest with her father Darius who is paralyzed. Darius can only communicate by using a drone that looks like a floating robot head. He uses the drone to accompany Vesper in her daily routine while his real body stays in bed. A year ago Vesper\u2019s mother left to be part of a group of people called The Pilgrims. They are scavengers and drag the junk they collect. Vesper\u2019s uncle Jonas lives not far away. He manages a sort of orphanage that he uses to extract blood from the children and sell it to the citadel. Jonas also owns beings called Jugs, artificial humans made with the sole purpose of being a slave-work force.\nOne day a citadel ship crashes nearby and Vesper finds a young woman survivor, Camellia. Vesper takes her home and heals her wounds. Camellia promises to take Vesper and her father to the citadel if they can find the other passenger of the ship, a man named Elias. However, when Vesper goes to check she finds that Jonas is also there. Jonas kills Elias and suspects that there was another passenger on the ship.\nVesper tries to communicate with the citadel so that they can come and pick up Camellia but the only transmitter is with Jonas. When Vesper reveals to Camellia that Elias is dead, the woman mourns him deeply. Vesper realizes that Camellia isn\u2019t human, she is a very advanced Jug, one who looks exactly like a human and has emotions. Elias is her creator, but making a sentient Jug is a crime, and so he and Camellia needed to escape.\nVesper uses the seeds stolen from her uncle Jonas' farm for an experiment involving samples from the synthetic Camellia. Camellia plays a tune from a musical instrument that causes the \u201clocked\u201d bacteria in the seeds to unlock. Vesper assumes she found a way to \u201cunlock\u201d the Citadel seeds and make them fertile so they will never starve again. \nJonas comes to the house and finds out about Camellia. Vesper and Camellia manage to overpower him. Vesper makes a deal: If he leaves them alone he can have the seeds and enough food. Jonas goes back to his place and calls the citadel, revealing to them about Camellia. Soldiers from the citadel arrive and kill Jonas before going to Vesper\u2019s house.\nCamellia and Vesper run while Darius stays behind and holds off the soldiers by blowing up the house\u2019s reactor. Camellia leaves Vesper unconscious and allows the soldiers to take her. Before that, she tells Vesper that she has the seeds and that she can change the world with them.\nDeeply saddened, Vesper buries the altered seeds, believing there\u2019s no use for them in a world without her loved ones. But when a group of Jonas\u2019 kids find her, Vesper changes her mind. Vesper and the children journey to a makeshift tower built by the Pilgrims.

Amar leads the investigation by digging into Karnan's life, as his murder seems out of place, since Karnan was a common man and the other two were higher officials in the Narcotics division.\nAmar learns about Karnan's recent addictions to alcohol, drugs and prostitutes, while at the same time being very protective of his infant foster grandson. While investigating, Amar acknowledged about two missing containers of drugs being hunted by Sandhanam, who runs a much bigger drug syndicate than Adaikalam, named Vetti Vagaiyara. The two containers had to be delivered to his cold-blooded smuggler boss 'Rolex', whose identity is unknown. If the drugs are delivered, Rolex will help Sandhanam form his own government; if not, Sandhanam and his family will be killed.

In one encounter, the squad kills some of Vedha's henchmen, framing an unarmed criminal killed by Vikram to avoid further inquiry. As the unit plans another encounter, Vedha enters the police station and voluntarily surrenders. When Vikram interrogates Vedha, he offers to narrate a story to him. The first act relates about Vedha becoming a dreaded gangster, who warns his younger brother Shatak, who is a mathematical genius, to stay away from crime, but Shatak is forced by a rival gangster, Babloo to carry drugs. When Shatak and his friend Chanda are caught by the police, Shatak confesses and Babloo is arrested.\nOn his boss Shiv Prasad's orders, Babloo assaults Shatak, leaving a permanent scar on his hand. Vedha asks Vikram if he should kill Babloo or Shiv Prasad. Vikram replies that Shiv Prasad was the real culprit, to which Vedha implies that he killed Shiv Prasad. Vedha's lawyer, who turns out to be Vikram's wife Priya, intervenes and bails him out. Vikram realises that the unarmed criminal framed by them for avoiding inquiry was actually Shatak, based on the mark in his hand. Worried that Vedha might try to kill Abbas, Vikram rushes to save Abbas, but finds him and Chanda shot dead. The IG dismisses it as a botched encounter. Priya refuses to divulge Vedha's whereabouts to Vikram. Enraged by this, Vikram raids Vedha's tenements and manages to capture him.

Chanda returns and reveals that she stole the money to start a new life, but came back because she loves Shatak. Vedha returns the money to Pandey, who orders him to kill Chanda. Vedha asks Vikram if he should respect Pandey and carry out the order or disobey him and support Shatak and Chanda, thus inciting a gang war. Vikram replies that he should support Shatak to which Vedha agrees. Realizing Shatak's innocence causes Vikram to stumble momentarily, at which point Vedha attacks and subdues him, telling him to investigate Shatak's and Abbas's deaths.\nVikram begins his investigation with Abbas's informant, who led them to Shatak's hideout, but finds that the informant has been killed.

One of them goes on to read a story about a Brahmarakshas in a village called Kamarottu, who was known to kidnap and kill children, fearing whom children would not venture outside after it was dark. The story goes on to show a kid being kidnapped by an eerie figure in eerie circumstances.\nThe next day, we are introduced to the villagers. In the village of Kamarottu, which is situated in Karnataka, Janardhan Gambira is a short-tempered landlord who lives with his wife Santha \"Shaku\" and his brother Eknath. Janardhan's friend's son, Vishwanath Ballal, arrives at the village with his wife and two children, Aparna \"Panna\" and Mohanchandra \"Munna\". Vishwanath tells Janardhan that Panna is engaged to one Rakesh and that he wants to arrange the marriage in their ancestral Kamarottu house, but Janardhan refuses, as the house is haunted by the brahmarakshasa. This is due to his son, Sanjeev \"Sanju\", having stolen jewels from the village's temple, 28 years ago. We are shown that Sanju, who had been gone from the village for 28 years, had sent a telegram to his ailing mother that he would come to see her soon. That same night, Sanju arrives at the village, from London. He meets Panna at Kamarottu house entrance, and they both accidentally find the beheaded corpse of a cop named Suresh Krishna, in the house well.\nAfter this incident, Inspector Vikrant Rona accompanied by his little daughter Guddi, arrives at the village to investigate, where an attempt is made to kill him, but Vikrant manages to escape. Upon taking charge, Vikrant reaches the Kamarottu house, where after inspecting the well, he finds the dead cop's purse with a \u20b91 note in it. Vikrant heads to the forest to find the culprit, where another attempt is made to kill him, but he manages to defeat the attackers, who escape. Vikrant tries to capture them, but finds a child hanging at a tree, and a watch, belonging to Suresh Krishna. After inspecting the corpse, Vikrant finds a parchment, which has: Gara Gara Gara Gaggara Jarba, Pira Nalkuri Netthara Parba written on it and weird make-up on the face of the corpse. Vikrant learns that 14 children were also previously killed in the same manner. He learns that almost all of them were students at the local school in the village, which is being run by P.E. teacher, Lawrence Pinto. He visits the school and conducts primary enquiry. Vikrant is informed of a local smuggler Moosa Kunni by the PE Teacher, and Vikrant secures his whereabouts from Rakkamma, a local liquor shop owner.\nFascinated by the recent turn of events, Panna decides to investigate the murders as well. This leads to her finding an old lady in the haunted ancestral house and Suresh Krishna's head in a box. Panna inquires about the old lady named Deyyu, where she finds out that she is Nittoni's mother. Nittoni was the caretaker of the village's temple, who was framed by Janardhan and Vishwanath, for stealing the temple jewelry (which was done by Sanju), due to which Nittoni, along with his wife and children: Madhava, Raghava and his younger daughter committed suicide out of shame, leaving Deyyu insane. Vikrant learns that the place where the child was hung, is owned by the smuggler, Moose Kunni. He brings him in for interrogation, but to no avail. While roaming in the forest, Panna and Munna find a devil-like figure, with a finger wound, keeping his hands near a fire. She complains to Vikrant about this, but finds a similar finger wound on his hand, which makes her suspect that Vikrant is the devil and that he might be connected to Nittoni's family. When she along with Sanju reaches Vikrant's house that evening, they see Vikrant dressed in a costume with the same weird make-up on his face. Vikrant arrives at Moose Kunni's factory and thrashes the workers, along with hanging and killing Moose Kunni. Vikrant meets Sanju and Panna, who ask Vikrant about being the devil and his appearance at his house, where he tells that he assumed the getup of the devil in order to flush out the real devil out. Later, Vikrant reveals a bigger fact about Sanju, leaving everyone shocked. At night, another attempt is made to kill Vikrant which fails again. Vikrant deduces that Eknath and Moose Kunni (who was actually killed by Eknath) are the mastermind behind Suresh Krishna's murder (based on the clue mentioned by the latter, on the \u20b91 note), as they were involved in smuggling. With the help of Panna, Vikrant learns that the dead children's fathers are actually the classmates of Madhava and Raghava, the children of Nittoni. These classmates are shown to have bullied and humiliated Madhava and Raghava for their caste identity and poor status, and also attacked them on the night of village attack on Nittoni. Panna also shares that as per the account of an old villageman, the same encrypted writing found on the corpses of children were found near the dead bodies of Nittoni's family as well. Another sentence vowing to finish the lives of those who killed Nittoni's family was also found in that note, according to the old villager.\nVikrant and Panna also find out that only 4 dead bodies were found at the time of Nittoni family's death and deduce that Madhava is still alive and may be responsible for the killings. After meeting Lawrence Pinto on another occasion, Vikrant sees a Shiva tattoo on his chest and deduces there is something suspicious there. He goes to Pinto's house to interrogate him, but Pinto makes an escape through a way the local driver tells Vikrant leads to the abandoned temple where Nittoni was the caretaker. In the Kamarottu house, Panna and Munna discusses amongst themselves that since the children of all classmates of Madhava were killed, now Panna, and Munna, and Sanju would be the killer's next target as their fathers also took part in persecuting Nittoni's family before knowing the truth that Sanju stole the jewels. Panna and Munna are suddenly terrorised by Deyyu, and are abducted by an unknown man. Vikrant reaches the abandoned temple, where he chances upon the names and belongings of all dead children. It is revealed that Vikrant's daughter was also one among the victims (the girl who is shown to be kidnapped in the beginning) and her presence with him shown all throughout the movie was only his post-traumatic hallucination. The kidnapping and murder incident had also left Vikrant's wife in coma and he had actually come to Kamarottu to investigate these murders. Vikrant is shown to have been one among Madhava's classmates, and though he had never actively bullied Madhava and Raghava, he had not tried to protect them from other bullies either. For this very reason, he has suffered personal loss of his wife and daughter Geethanjali \"Guddi\" in the hands of Madhava, who is on a mission to exact vengeance on the people directly/indirectly responsible for ill-treating his family.\nVikrant's deduction that Madhava is none other than Lawrence Pinto is right. Madhava knocks out Vikrant and takes him to an underground tunnel, where Panna, Munna are about to be hung. Here it is revealed that the his wife was attacked and daughter killed while they were visiting through the village for a marriage.\nUpon gaining consciousness, Vikrant also deduces that Madhava's younger brother Raghava is also alive. Then Sanju arrives, and it is revealed, to everybody's astonishment, that he is actually Raghava. Raghava has been masquerading as Sanju, and Raghava had caught and killed the real Sanju for stealing the jewelry of the temple, on the very same night of the death of his parents and sister. An enraged Vikrant fights with both Raghava and Madhava, which leads to Madhava and Deyyu getting killed. Raghava fights with Vikrant, with Vikrant gaining the upper hand. He kills and throws Raghava into a waterfall, thus avenging his personal loss.

Driving home on a stormy night, Kat is frightened by a two-headed worm in her candy apple, leading her father to veer off a bridge; only Kat survives after her mother sacrifices her life to save her. Meanwhile, in the underworld, demon brothers Wendell and Wild spend their days putting rejuvenating hair cream on their balding father, Buffalo Belzer, while dreaming of making an amusement park, the Dream Fair, for departed souls to challenge Belzer's \"Scream Fair\". Wild continuously steals the hair cream by eating it for its hallucinogenic effect, much to Wendell's annoyance, but Wild manages to change Wendell's mind by force-feeding him the cream. The cream causes the brothers to have a vision of Kat.\nFive years later, Kat is an embittered, punk rock-loving thirteen year old juvenile delinquent who blames herself for her parents' deaths. Kat is enrolled in Rust Bank's all-girls Catholic school, headed by Father Bests. A trio of preppy classmates attempt to befriend Kat. The group is led by Siobhan Klaxon, whose parents Lane and Irmgard's private prison company Klaxon \"Klax\" Korp has taken over the town. Kat unintentionally endears herself to Siobhan by saving her from a falling brick, which she anticipated through premonition, surprising herself. Later, she meets Ra\u00fal Cocolotl, a trans boy who was once friends with Siobhan and the one who accidentally broke the brick that nearly landed on Siobhan. Ra\u00fal's mother, Marianna, is convinced the Klaxons are the reason the brewery burned down and caused it to kill all of its workers. During a class taught by Sister Helley, Kat receives a marking on her hand resembling a skull when she approached Helley's desk, which Helley tells her she must hide and tell no one. The mark alerts Wendell and Wild from a possessed stuffed-bear called Bearzebub, who marks her from Helley's desk, identifying Kat as their \"hell maiden\", and they appear to her in a dream and make an empty promise to revive her parents, although demons can not resurrect the dead, if she summons them to the world of the living.\nKat steals Bearzebub from Helley's desk needed to summon Wendell and Wild. Helley, once a hell maiden herself, works with the school's janitor and secret demon hunter, Manberg \"the Merciless\", who hunts demons and keeps them in jars. Father Bests is revealed to be in league with the Klaxons, who kill him as the last witness to their factory fire. After his funeral, Kat recruits Ra\u00fal as her witness to summon the demon brothers, who brought their father's hair cream with them after they discovered that it can bring dead organisms back to life. However, by the taking the wrong way, the brothers appear in another part of the cemetery, and Kat believes she has been stood up.\nWendell and Wild test the cream on Bests, who comes back to life and convinces the Klaxons to pay the brothers to revive the deceased members of the town council. This will give the Klaxons the votes they need to demolish the town and expand their prisons, but, fearing they could resurrect anyone else in the cemetery, where the other witnesses of the brewery arson, the burned brew workers, are too, the Klaxons tell Wendell and Wild that if they revive Kat's parents or any dead people, including the witnesses, in the cemetery, they won't pay for their fair or for the school. Bests returns to school, and Kat confronts the brothers, who make her vow to serve them forever in exchange for her parents' resurrection but it is just a ruse to make sure that they won\u2019t resurrect anyone in the cemetery. Forced to dig up the council members, whom Wendell and Wild revive, Ra\u00fal steals the cream and revives Delroy and Wilma himself. Reunited with her parents, Kat helps Ra\u00fal escape the brothers. \nAfter the zombie council approves the Klaxons' plans and pay Bests, Wendell, and Wild with a bag full of money, Siobhan discovers her parents' lies about the conditions of their prisons. Helley and Manberg make Kat undergo a ritual called soul binding, confronting her memories and severing her allegiance with Wendell and Wild, resulting in her accepting the fact that her parents' death was not her fault. The soul binding ritual further gives her the control of her precognitive powers, which Helley reveals are a consequence of her status as a hell maiden. After learning of their resurrection, Bests, Wendell, and Wild kidnap Delroy and Wilma and take them to the cemetery to kill them until Kat, Ra\u00fal, Helley, and Manberg stop them, where Siobhan, who followed her pet pygmy goat Gabby Goat to the cemetery, reveals that her parents paid Bests, Wendell, and Wild worthless company money. Buffalo Belzer appears, having discovered Wendell and Wild's deception, but a mural painted by Ra\u00fal as his art project, depicting his mother Marianna, as a mighty Mayan warrior, defending and protecting a baby Ra\u00fal against a two-headed dragon (representing the Klaxons) painted part-by-part on every house's roof in Rust Bank, convinces him to make up with his sons. Manberg releases his collection of jarred demons after learning they are Belzer's children in exchange for Kat and the others. Belzer apologizes to Wendell and Wild, approving their plans for a new fair. Bests dies again, and Belzer explains that the cream's effects are only temporary, and reveals the strands of hair Wendell and Wild have been planting on his head would have fallen off anyway.\nKat says it's too late to save Rust Bank, but Sister Helley tells her she can change the future since she knows what happens in it. Recalling that Ra\u00fal said there needs to be a witness to prove the Klaxons are guilty, Kat tells him to use the very last bit of cream to revive some dead brew workers. The group fends off the bulldozers conducted by the zombie council to demolish the town while Ra\u00fal revives three dead factory workers to testify to the Klaxons' crimes, resulting in their arrest. The cream's effect begin to wear off on Delroy and Wilma, but before they die, Kat uses her precognition to give them a glimpse of the future where Rust Bank is revived, and Wendell and Wild offer them VIP passes to their afterlife fair.

The child's terrified mother says that if Maria spares the girl's life, she will give her up once the girl is 16. Maria agrees, but robs the girl of her voice before leaving. The mother hides the child, Nevena, in a cave, and raises her there with no knowledge of the outside world.\nOn Nevena's 16th birthday, Maria arrives in the form of an eagle; the mother chases the bird out of sight, where Maria kills her and takes her form. She tells Nevena to follow her. Outside the cave, Maria kills a donkey, scratches Nevena's chest and spits the donkey's blood onto her before burning her wound with fire; this transforms Nevena into a witch, giving her retractible black talons on her fingers and palm. Maria then pulls Nevena's mother's guts from a hole in her chest, causing her to resume her previous, burned form.\nNevena, not understanding what has happened, believes the witch is still her mother. Maria kills a shepherd who takes a liking to Nevena, warning her that humans will hurt her, and tries to teach her to catch and kill rabbits and fish, whose blood witches consume for power. But Nevena would rather play with the creatures, and Maria, disgusted, mocks her for her delight. Angered, Nevena throws a stone at Maria, who abandons her to fend for herself. Nevena follows her for a little while until she sees Maria kill and assume the form of a wolf, putting its entrails into a cavity in her chest, before disappearing into the forest.\nNevena comes across a village, where she sees a young woman, Bosilka, giving birth to a baby. Attracted by its cries, Nevena finds the baby in a crib in the barn. Bosilka attacks her, and Nevena, shocked, accidentally kills her. Copying Maria, Nevena puts Bosilka's entrails into her chest and assumes her appearance; the spell also causes Bosilka's body to disappear.\nNevena, who is still mute, assumes Bosilka's life. Her family believe that she has gone mad, but Nevena slowly learns how to live as a human: how to cook and wash, how to communicate non-verbally, and the differences in how men and women treat her. All the while, Maria watches from afar.\nOne night, Boslika\u2019s abusive husband tries to have sex with her. The unfamiliarity of the process, along with the rough nature of her husband, causes her to panic and kill him. She removes Bosilka's entrails from her chest cavity, reverts to her old self and flees.\nOn the road once more, she assumes the shape of a dog and comes across a group of men. She follows them to their village, then assumes her naked human form and lures one of them away. The man, Boris, attempts to seduce her and they begin to have sex, but she kills him and assumes his shape. Now a male, Nevena returns to the village, where he learns to plow the fields and thresh, but still acts in a confused and childlike way. His peculiar behaviour attracts the attention of the women of the village, who believe he is possessed. They attempt an exorcism, which they believe is successful, but say that the Wolf-Eateress that bewitched him will one day come back and spirit him away. Again, Maria appears to him and warns that growing close to normal humans won\u2019t end well.\nBut Nevena persists, and enjoys his life in the village, even having a pleasurable sexual experience with a local woman. That changes when he discovers the body of a dying girl, Biliana, who has fallen from a cliff. Crying for the first time, Nevena sheds her male form and assumes that of the little girl, leaving only Boris's bloodstained clothes behind.

One day she happened across a witch and begged her for a husband and child. The witch scratched her chest and spat blood in her face - the first two steps of creating a witch - before walking away. Later, Maria was approached by a man who offers his son's hand in marriage. She accepted, but upon arriving in his home discovered that the son was dying of disease. She was tied up and forced to have sex with him, because his mother didn't want him to die without having spread his seed.\nMaria fell sick and attempted to drink a cow's blood to give her strength but was discovered and burned as a witch. The fire completed the witch's spell and transformed Maria into a witch herself - but only after her body had been left horribly burned and scarred.\nFor Nevena, many years pass, and she decides to marry the boy from her youth. As they grow closer, she reveals her witch's talons, but he is not afraid. They make love, and she becomes pregnant, but tragedy strikes when her husband is killed by a boar - implied to be Maria in disguise. The moment she gives birth to a baby girl, Nevena shuts herself away, afraid that Maria will take her newborn child, but the women of the village promise to protect it.\nHowever, one chilly morning she discovers her midwife has been killed, and that Maria has seized her baby. The witch ridicules the child and Nevena before cutting its throat with her talon. Without stopping to think, Nevena kills a goat, takes a mouthful of its blood and performs the Wolf-Eateress spell on the dying infant, turning it into a witch and saving its life.
