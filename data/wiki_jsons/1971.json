He buries her in his flat block's communal garden, and whilst digging the grave he accidentally uncovers Ruth Fuerst, one of his previous victims.\nIn 1949, Tim and Beryl Evans move into 10 Rillington Place, west London, with their infant daughter Geraldine. Beryl is pregnant again and attempts an abortion by taking some pills. When she informs Tim, they have a violent argument, which Christie breaks up. Soon after, Christie offers to help Beryl terminate the pregnancy. He pretends to read a medical textbook one day in an effort to convince Tim of his expertise. Tim is essentially illiterate and cannot tell that Christie is lying. The Evanses agree to let Christie perform the procedure.\nChristie occupies his wife, Ethel, by sending her to his place of work with some paperwork. He grabs his killing tools, makes a cup of tea, and heads upstairs to Beryl. He is interrupted by a couple of builders who arrive to renovate the outbuilding. He lets them in, and when he sees they are well-occupied, he pours a new cup of tea and heads back upstairs. Beryl has a violent reaction to the gas, and Christie punches her in the face to knock her out. He then strangles and sexually assaults her.\nWhen Tim returns, Christie tells him that Beryl died of complications from the procedure. Tim wants to go to the police, but Christie convinces him that he will be seen as an accessory before the fact. Christie suggests that Tim leave town that night, while Christie disposes of Beryl's body. He promises that he will place the baby in the care of a childless couple from East Acton. Tim reluctantly agrees, and leaves the house in the middle of the night. Christie then strangles Geraldine with a tie.\nTim hides out with his aunt and uncle in Merthyr Tydfil, pretending that he is in town on business. He claims that Beryl and the baby are visiting her family in Brighton. Tim's relatives send a letter to Beryl's father, who sends a telegram in response to say that he has not seen Beryl in months. When confronted by his relatives, Tim pretends Beryl had run away with a rich man and then visits the local police station. He confesses to disposing of Beryl's body in the sewer after the botched abortion. Three London police officers lift the manhole, but do not find Beryl's body. A search of 10 Rillington Place eventually uncovers the bodies of Beryl and the baby in the washroom, where Christie hid them.\nWhen Tim is brought back to London, he is charged with the murders of his wife and daughter. In shock, and despondent over the news, he confesses to both crimes, though he is guilty of neither. During his trial, Christie is a key witness. Tim's defence shreds Christie's credibility by revealing that he has a history of theft and violence. Nevertheless, Tim is found guilty and hanged.\nTwo years after the trial, Ethel begins to fear her husband, and informs Christie she will move out to stay with relatives. When he begs her not to leave him, Ethel implies that he should be in prison. Christie murders her that night and hides her body under the floorboards in their front room.

If the organism threatens to escape, the Wildfire facility includes an automatic nuclear self-destruct mechanism to incinerate all infectious agents.

The story is about Chellappan a fiercely dedicated Communist and an employee at Chacko's business, where he has become a respected leader among the working class by organising pickets and strikes. He, however, neglects his family, abusing his wife Bhavani and their two children, a boy named Kuttappan (to whom Chellappan is indifferent), and a younger girl named Kumari (on whom he dotes). Chellappan is depicted as a man of weak moral fiber (he is shown to have a weakness for numerous other women). Moreover, he is highly suspicious of his wife Bhavani, who is still rather comely and of clean habits. He often accuses her of infidelity (the reason behind his indifference towards his son, as he believes that he's not his son's biological father), and often wonders whether his wife having an affair with his friend Gopalan, another day-labourer. Due to this suspicion he constantly fights with and physically abuses his wife.\nLife is depicted as a daily fight against hunger and hardship. One day, Chellappan is fired from his job by Chacko. A belligerent Chellappan happens to meet Chacko on a bylane and accosts him. A nervous Chacko escapes somehow and complains to the police of a possible threat to his life by Chellappan. The police come looking for Chellappan, but he has vanished underground, leaving behind his wife and children to fend for themselves. In order to support her family, bhavani joins the ranks of day labourers. Gopalan befriends her and offers her sympathy and a shoulder to cry on. After a while, despite her conscience, they soon enter into a relationship. Bhavani sells her house to a local businessman, who promises to get her another small parcel of land elsewhere where she can construct her own house. The children miss their father, especially the little daughter Kumari.\nThe local chapter of the Communist Party has now arranged temporary hiding for Chellappan with a family of humble working-class people, also Communist sympathisers, under a false alias 'Prabhakaran'. To them, he is an honoured, but mysterious guest, a minor celebrity. They shower him with honest warmth and affection; especially their grown-up daughter Parvathy, who harbours in her heart a desire for matrimonial union. Prabhakaran reads those subtle signals and tries to seduce her, but she does not succumb. He feels ashamed and realises he has been neglecting his wife and children, and travels back to his village incognito. There he learns that his wife has sold their old home and is now openly residing with Gopalan. Moreover, she is pregnant. Chellappan is remorseful, and starts blaming himself for the change of events. Without a word, he goes back to Ernakulam, but now he has changed significantly; he is deeply philosophical, and truly alone.\nWandering around the town, he notices some agitation outside the gates of a factory, organised by the local chapter of the Communist Party, agitating against the factory owner, whom they accuse for the disappearance of one Paulose, whose beautiful daughter was coveted by the mill owner. Soon some hired goons arrive, agents of the factory owner, and there is a scuffle. Chellappan joins the fight against the goons and inflicts injuries on the goons. The police arrive and briefly arrest Chellappan. However, the local Communist organisers are not impressed by this newcomer and remark darkly against him. However, his bravery is noticed by Hamza who runs a small ramshackle tea stall just outside the main gates of the factory. The goons have long terrorised Hamza and often take his stuff for free. Hamza the shopkeeper, now emboldened, shows scant respect to the factory-owner's goons, who then demolish his shack at night. The next morning Hamza rushes to see the ruins of his kiosk and vows revenge against the mill owner (a scene where Mammootty, is also present, as a young, clean-shaven, dhoti-clad bystander).\nNews reaches his hosts that his guest was none other than Chellappan and that 'Prabhakaran' was just an alias, and that he is married with two children. Parvathy gets disconsolate, and pines for Chellappan. After his release he comes back to his hosts where he has now become a real Communist celebrity and is greeted with simple pomp. That night, after everyone has gone to sleep, she goes to him and offers herself without reserve. But Chellappan is now a different person: he refuses and leaves the place.\nChellappan comes back to his village and visits his estranged wife at her new home. He learns from his son that his daughter has died of jaundice. Bhavani, now with baby in arm, meets him, and asks him to show love to his very own son Kuttappam. Chellappan now looks at his son with love, and blesses him tenderly, telling him to study, work hard and become a great man. He then departs, silently, without looking back.\nSoon arrives that Chellappan has been arrested for the murder of the factory owner, and that Chellappan has given a full confession to the Police to that effect. Chellappan goes to trial, where he openly accepts blame for the crime. Consequently, he is found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. As he is taken away to jail in a vehicle, the scene shows his ex-wife Bhavani, disconsolately running behind the van, crying, restrained by Gopalan: a very poignant scene.

While watching a program, Raffles blows a raspberry at shows he hates and claps his hands at shows he likes.\nPost smuggles the chimpanzee into the UBC building when various programs are being previewed for executives and watches as the chimpanzee gives his vote from the projection room.  The first program that receives Raffles's approval is a movie named Devil Dan.  Post tells the programming executives that Devil Dan will draw large audiences.  The executives disagree and choose not to program the movie.  To prove he's got a sure-fire way of choosing hits, Post sneaks into UBC's broadcast center to switch the reels.

Post successfully masks the chimpanzee's abilities as his own and rises to vice president of UBC, now the top-rated area network.

Jennifer becomes disenchanted with him when she finds out he sold her pet for money without her consent and breaks off their relationship. She also does not believe her chimpanzee should be released into the wild.\nMeanwhile, executives from every studio and camera crews crowd a cargo plane soaring over the jungle, as they prepare to parachute the chimpanzee into an unexplored section of the Amazon; but before arriving at the intended disembarkation point, the stubborn chimpanzee, not wanting to be sent into the wild, pulls a lever opening an emergency hatch which sucks all the executives out of the plane, causing them to parachute into the jungle instead.

John Cotton (Barry Robins) leads this bunch of \"misfits\" who are all, to varying degrees, emotionally or psychologically disturbed.  Cotton's group, composed of rejects and outcasts from the other cabins, is known as the \"Bedwetters\" and the boys are constantly demeaned and ridiculed, which inevitably crushes what little self-esteem they might otherwise have possessed in the first place.\nCotton, through trial and tribulation, becomes the leader of this tight-knit group, and he sets out to mold his followers into a unit that commands respect rather than derision. His is obviously a formidable task in view of the fragile psychological state of the small group, which includes two warring dysfunctional brothers who are known as \"Lally 1\" and \"Lally 2\". Lally 1 reacts to threats against his emotional security by throwing violent temper tantrums, often directed at his younger brother Lally 2, who in the face of these attacks plunges himself into a fantasy world that is filled with tiny creatures he calls \"Ooms\", and seeks solace in the scorched foam rubber pillow he always carries.\nLawrence Teft III (Billy Mumy) is shown in the film as quiet and sullen, but whenever he is confronted with authority, he turns rebellious. Before he came to camp, one of Teft's favorite adventures had been stealing cars, but because of the \"connections\" of his father, Lawrence Teft Jr., he was never arrested for any of his offenses. Hoping that he will learn some self-discipline which will make him worthy of attending Exeter or Dartmouth, his parents enroll him in the camp.\nCotton's group also includes Sammy Shecker, an overweight, paranoid Jewish boy, whose father is a successful comedian who trades upon the Jewish stereotype. Sometimes to the annoyance of the other boys, Sammy mimics his father's routines, he compulsively bites his nails, and he is loud, nervous, and obnoxious. The designation \"Bedwetters\" applies especially well to Gerald Goodenow, the sixth member of the group, who often wets the bed at night \u2013 a behavior that had resulted in his having been ejected from two cabins before Cotton takes him in tow. Bedwetting, however, seems to be the least of Gerald's problems, as he suffers from a phobic reaction to school, which results in several unsuccessful sessions with a psychiatrist. Goodenow is also handicapped by a heavy-handed stepfather who is determined to make a man out of him, by physical force if necessary.\nKramer and his screenwriter Mac Benoff decided to compromise Swarthout's time sequence by having the entire film set in the present with flashbacks into the past of all the boys, to explicate their presence at the camp. Whereas Swarthout's novel \u2013 thematically powerful though it is \u2013 is episodic and difficult for some sixth-graders to follow, the Kramer film flows almost faultlessly to its tragic conclusion. The plight of the American buffalo and any other endangered species is at the center of the film's focus. Almost predictably, the dysfunctional group, under Cotton's guidance, set out to free a large herd of the bison after they witness their perverted macho camp counselor, \"Wheaties\", shooting the animals in a festive (and deeply disturbing) western lottery, which is given validation as a proper method to thin out the large numbers by eliminating the \"weak\" or \"sick\" buffalo. The buffalo are not the only targets of this destructive urge, as the Bedwetters \u2013 similarly \u2013 have also been \"tamed\", \"penned\" and crushed in spirit. As a result of their parents' neglect or abuse, they have all been reduced to psychological misfits. Ridiculed and rejected by the other boys in the camp, they are forced to cling even more strongly to their deviant behavior. The boys' pilgrimage to free the buffalo is also an allegorical search for their own freedom.Cotton perceives that success will free the boys of psychological crutches and allow each to stand alone in defense of self. Cotton sacrifices his life not only for the buffalo but for the boys he has led to this one miraculous triumph. The implication at the end of the film is that the remaining boys are no longer \"dings\" or \"weirdos\", as they have all gained a sense of pride in their abilities and have saved themselves, as well as the buffalo, from extinction. The title of the film (and novel) exemplifies the dual yet unified nature of the theme. Both beasts and children need to be free to roam, to develop and to discover, but the freedom that is given to the buffalo at the film's conclusion is worthless because their very natures have been altered by man. Outside the fence of the preserve, the tame buffalo will never find wild plains and grasslands on which to roam and their natural habitat, along with their natural spirit, has been destroyed.

The former Confederate soldiers have become a roving band of homicidal highway robbers, and their ultimate goal is to re-form a squadron led by Cain and renew attacks upon Union targets.\nThe men find Cain and tell him of their plans, but when Cain refuses to join them, tells them that the \"Old South\" is dead, and derides their unrealistic plan to attack the north, they become enraged, attack him, and tie him up. Ameson, the leader of the group, rapes Angie while Cain watches helplessly. Billy-Joe, the most deranged and volatile of the men, attempts to rape her afterwards, but she fights him off.

Sandy (Art Garfunkel) is gentle and passive, while Jonathan Fuerst (Jack Nicholson) is tough and aggressive. Sandy idolizes women, while Jonathan objectifies them. Jonathan frequently uses the term \"ballbuster\" to describe women as emasculating teases whose main pleasure is to deny pleasure to men; he extends this term to mean women who want to get married instead of accepting that men mostly want unattached sex. Since each man's perspective on womanhood is extreme and self-serving, neither is able to sustain a relationship with a woman.\nThe film has three parts. Part I occurs when Sandy and Jonathan are college roommates. Part II follows the men several years after college. In the final part, the men have become middle-aged.\nIn the beginning, Sandy and Jonathan are discussing women, and what kind appeals to each. Sandy wants a woman who is intellectual. Jonathan is more interested in a woman's physical attributes.\nSandy shyly meets Susan (Candice Bergen) at an on-campus event and they begin dating. Although they enjoy each other's company, Susan is reluctant to enter into a physical relationship. Unbeknownst to Sandy, she is also pursued by Jonathan, who feels a physical attraction for her. They have sex. Jonathan tries to persuade Susan not to have sex with Sandy, but after some delays, Susan is also having sex with Sandy. Part I ends with Susan and Jonathan breaking up.\nPart II finds Sandy married to Susan, while Jonathan is still searching for his \"perfect woman.\" Jonathan now defines perfection by a woman's bust size and figure. Jonathan begins a relationship with Bobbie (Ann-Margret), a beautiful woman who fulfills all of his physical requirements. However, Jonathan constantly berates Bobbie for being shallow. Jonathan finds that this purely physical relationship is no more satisfying than his previous relationship with Susan. Bobbie leaves her job at Jonathan's suggestion. She then becomes depressed, spending long hours doing nothing but sleeping in the apartment she shares with Jonathan. The relationship deteriorates. Jonathan berates Bobbie for not cleaning up the apartment while he is out working all day at a nine-to-five job. He claims that he doesn't understand why breakups always have to end with \"poison.\"\nSandy's relationship with Susan is faring no better. Sandy is dissatisfied and bored with the physical part of their relationship, even though he and Susan \"do all the right things.\" He relates how they are \"patient with each other\" and concludes with a statement that perhaps sex is not \"meant to be enjoyable with the person you love.\"\nSandy and Susan end their relationship. Sandy begins dating Cindy (Cynthia O'Neal). Sandy, Cindy, Jonathan, and Bobbie find themselves together at Jonathan's apartment, where Sandy complains privately to Jonathan that Cindy gets so busy handing out instructions in bed that it's like a close-order drill. Jonathan suggests to Sandy that they trade partners, to \"liven things up a bit.\" Sandy goes to the bedroom looking for Bobbie. Cindy dances with Jonathan and reprimands him for attempting to bed her with Sandy nearby, but indicates she is open to seeing him on his own, saying he should contact her at a more appropriate time. In the meantime, upset by an earlier fight with Jonathan about her desire to get married, Bobbie has attempted suicide. She is found by Sandy, who calls the hospital to have her taken to intensive care.\nPart III opens with now-middle-aged Jonathan presenting a slideshow entitled \"Ballbusters on Parade\" to Sandy (also middle-aged) and Sandy's 18-year-old girlfriend, Jennifer (Carol Kane). The slideshow consists of pictures of Jonathan's various loves throughout his life. He skips awkwardly over a slide of Susan, but not before Sandy notices. He also shows an image of Bobbie, saying they are divorced and had one child together, and he is paying her alimony. Jennifer leaves in tears. Sandy idolizes his new lover, explaining that \"she knows worlds which I cannot begin to touch yet.\" Jonathan believes his friend is deluding himself.\nTime passes. Jonathan remains successful, but is alone. A prostitute (Rita Moreno) is with him, and they go through a ritual dialogue about male/female relationships which is apparently a script written by Jonathan. At the end, the prostitute recites a monologue (again scripted by Jonathan) praising his power and \"perfection,\" which apparently has become the only way Jonathan can now get an erection.", "tmdb_id": 36492}, "584261": {"title": "Carry On at Your Convenience", "plot": "In bathroom ceramics factory W.C.

He urges the economically depressed community of Eagle Rock, Iowa, to go for the prize.\nThe town council has been trying to woo back the military ever since it closed a base a few years earlier, hoping its return would help the local cash flow.

The booze bone's connected to the smoke bone.\" The Reverend looks defeated but comes up with the idea of Edgar leaving town for a thirty-day vacation, which Edgar immediately departs on.\nAt midnight, the challenge begins. For the next thirty days, no smoking is permitted, with Eagle Rock being the only city in America that got all of its smokers to pledge.\nOnce the no smoking ban begins, Reverend Brooks gets extremely frustrated with not being able to smoke. His only relief is having frequent sex with his wife Natalie.

The company needs just one person to fail. Among the weakest: the elderly Doctor Proctor, who must always have a cigarette before surgery, and the anxiety-ridden wife of the mayor, Mrs. Wappler, who counts the small gherkin pickles she eats as the hours pass. However, a group of 29 non-smoking residents, all members of the ultra-conservative Christopher Mott Society have been asked by Brooks to police all traffic entering Eagle Rock to ensure no tobacco products enter.\nThe attention of the nation's leading newscasters at the time turns the small community's efforts into a matter of highly publicized failure or success. Soon the community is invaded by buxom \"massage therapists,\" beer vendors, souvenir shops and more. Rev. Brooks appears on a Time magazine cover, which leads him to another epiphany: if he can save the town, he will be a hero.\nMerwin is told by Valiant's board members to undermine the town's efforts at all costs, doing whatever he must to get someone to smoke before the thirty days are up.\nWith a few minutes left to midnight, Merwin pulls out all the stops to make sure that someone smokes. He fixes it so that the town clock chimes midnight before it is midnight and has helicopters dropping cigarettes into the anxious crowd. Dr. Proctor frantically and desperately leaps into the crowd trying to smoke a cigarette. Reverend Brooks goes into the crowd to find and stop him. Merwin has a cigarette lighter shaped like a gun and is trying to get to Dr. Proctor. Odie Turman, an elderly conservative lady, has a real gun and is lurking about in the crowd.

From the newly conquered French coastline, a Wehrmacht colonel looks out over the English Channel with powerful binoculars. Surveying the white cliffs of Dover, he spies Godfrey emerging from a lavatory. Godfrey joins the rest of his platoon, who are defiantly waving the Union Flag. The colonel fumes contemptuously, \"How can the stupid British ever hope to win?!\"\nOne morning, George Mainwaring, the manager of the Walmington-on-Sea branch of Martins Bank, and his chief clerk, Arthur Wilson, listen to Anthony Eden making a radio broadcast about forming the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV). At the local police station chaos ensues because there is nobody to organise the enrolment of the men. Characteristically, Mainwaring takes charge and after commandeering the local church hall he registers the assembled volunteers, with weapons being inspected.\nThe local platoon is eventually formed with Mainwaring in command as captain, Wilson as his sergeant and Jack Jones as the lance-corporal, plus Frazer, Godfrey, Pike and Walker as privates. With no weapons or training, the platoon is initially forced to improvise, using devices invented and assembled by Jones. These invariably backfire or malfunction with disastrous consequences. The chaos includes an anti-aircraft rocket launcher blowing up a farmer's barn and a one-man tank made from a cast iron bathtub rolling into the river with Private Joe Walker still inside. The platoon secures uniforms and, eventually, weapons. Following the evacuation from Dunkirk, the LDV is renamed the Home Guard.\nThe platoon is ordered to take part in a war games/training weekend, but Lance-Corporal Jones's van, recently converted to gas under Mainwaring's orders, breaks down after Jones accidentally pushes his bayonet through the roof of the van into the gas bag on the roof. They are towed by a steam roller. Out of control, the roller destroys the platoon's tents, as well as other equipment, angering Major-General Fullard who is in charge of the weekend exercises, and who is already cross with Mainwaring for previously refusing to cash his cheque at the bank, still under the impression that Mainwaring is a bank clerk.\nAfter a night sleeping without tents the platoon, bar Wilson, oversleep and miss breakfast despite being detailed to hold a pontoon bridge during the day's exercise. The bridge has been sabotaged by the Royal Marines and the results are comically chaotic, with Jones atop on a drifting white horse. Captain Mainwaring is summoned by the major-general and told that due to the platoon's poor showing he will recommend Mainwaring be replaced.\nWhile the platoon are walking back to Walmington, a Luftwaffe reconnaissance aircraft is shot down and its three-man crew parachutes to safety. That night, they enter Walmington Church Hall, where a meeting is taking place to raise money to fund half of a Spitfire, the other half being funded by another nearby town. They hold all present as hostages, including the mayor and vicar, and demand a boat back to France. Mainwaring and his men reach home and discover what has happened. By this point Fullard, the Navy, the Marines and the police have begun to arrive.\nThe Home Guard platoon infiltrate the building though the church crypt. Dressed in choir surplices, they enter the church hall singing All Things Bright and Beautiful, with their own extemporised second verse. Mainwaring takes a revolver concealed under a collection plate and confronts the Luftwaffe leader, who aims his Luger pistol at him. Both officers agree they will shoot at the count of three, with Mainwaring warning the Germans that if he dies, 7 men will take his place. The platoon then draws their rifles from beneath their white robes. The German intruders reluctantly surrender, with Fullard left stunned at the sight of the victorious Home Guard. Mainwaring and his men become the pride of the town. Wilson reveals that the German officer's gun was empty. Smiling, Mainwaring replies, \"So was mine\".\nIn the final scenes, Mainwaring and the Home Guard look towards France from the cliffs.

While awaiting dinner in the hotel's lobby, he notices a group of young Poles and their governess mother, and becomes spellbound by the handsome boy Tadzio, whose casual dress and demeanor distinguishes him from his modest sisters.

He tells the others he couldn't find it and they know he is lying. They shut the door on him enclosing him in certain death. He screams out to no avail. Later, another group of robbers enter with the exact same plan of stealing the jewels from the tomb. Andreuccio hears this and lays in wait.

She accidentally puts his underpants on her head mistaking it for her veil and rushes out of the door. The Mother Superior begins scolding the nun but she points out the underpants and the nuns all realize the Mother Superior is guilty of the same sin. From that day forth, the nuns all get lovers.\nWhile this story is being told, Ser Ciappelletto is picking pockets of men caught up in the story. He gives some money to a male child in exchange for sexual intercourse and the scene ends.\nMasetto da Lamporecchio:\nIn the second episode (based on Third day, First tale), a young man, Masetto da Lamporecchio, is encouraged by a gardener to seek work at a local convent filled with many beautiful women. The young man gets the idea to pretended to be deaf and dumb to get inside as the abbess doesn't want handsome young men in the convent but will take exception for a deaf mute who she sees as non-threatening. He gets the job and while tending the garden two nuns decide to use him for sex because he can not rat on them. The other sisters watch this and get the idea to join in.

Peronella devises a scheme to explain her lover in the pot and tells Giannello that she already has a buyer and that he is inspecting the pot. She tells him she sold it for seven denarii which is more than Giannello had sold it to his buyer. The husband accepts this and tells his buyer to leave as the pot is already sold. Giannello goes to the pot room where the hidden lover pops out and yells at him that the inside of the pot is dirty. The wife tells the husband to clean it before selling it. Giannello enters the pot and while he is inside the pot, his wife and her lover loudly and passionately have intercourse next to it. The wife points around at different spots of the jar and tells her husband to scrape them all good until he finds the \"right spot\".

The husband however remains oblivious to this and laughs to himself.\nSer Ciappelletto of Prato:\nIn the fourth episode (based on First day, first tale), which begins in Prato, Ser Ciappelletto, a Neapolitan merchant, is sent to make a deal in Germany by his employer.

That night, Ciappelletto has an ominous dream that he is being paraded around while wrapped in a burial shroud while around him friars and monks play volleyball with human skulls. He reaches Germany where he meets up with the two men. They happily sing the Neapolitan song Fenesta ca Lucive together and drink wine but Ciappelletto falls down in a faint. God has punished him with a serious illness that forces him to his death bed. The two men are outraged because if they turn him out they will be seen as bad hosts but if his crimes are revealed in confession they will certainly draw negative attention. Ciappelletto devises a plan to confess and calls a monk to tell him several lies and half-truths that make him seem very pure, while pretending to cringe over venial sins. He tells the monk that he has never slept with a woman (leaving out that he is homosexual) which the monk sees as a very holy and righteous act as he is very handsome. He recalls to the monk that he once cursed his mother for spilling milk and has been tormented by that memory ever since. He also says he is ashamed of spitting in church once. The monk is amazed because he believes Ciappelleto is the most holy man he has ever given confession to. Ciappelleto dies and due to these lies, the people consider him a holy man. After his death, Ciappelletto is revered as a saint. The monk delivers a eulogy to \"Saint Ciappelletto\" and urges everyone in attendance to take heed and remember his holy actions. He says they should all aim to live as he did. After the eulogy, many poor, disabled and sick people enter the room where Saint Ciappelletto is kept and touch his body in praise.

She tells her mother that the inside of the house is much too warm for her and that she wants to stay outside so she may hear the nightingale sing in the morning. Her parents set up a makeshift bed for her outside where she awaits for Ricciardo. He scales the wall of her house and makes love to her in the makeshift bed. The next morning the girl's father goes outside to find the two lovers sleeping naked, while she is holding his genitals. He runs inside to get his wife telling her that their daughter \"caught the nightingale in her hands!\" The mother rushes outside to see what the commotion is about and is about to scream when she sees the naked pair. The father covers her mouth and explains that the boy is a good match, as his marriage would earn a significant amount of money through dowry and it would improve their social standing. The father wakes the pair up and tells Ricciardo that the only way he will leave the house alive is if he marries his daughter. Ricciardo agrees and everyone is happy.

Don Gianni, using his cunning, tells Pietro and Gemmata that Gemmata can be turned into horse and then back into a human, so she can be used to sow the fields of her husband's farm. Don Gianni can make this happen only with a special spell. The spell is a ruse: the doctor has imagined a ritual to enable him to have sex with the woman, in full view of her husband. Don Gianni strips Gemmata naked in front of Pietro and grabs her breasts, hair, back and bottom, and describes how each part will appear when she is a mare. At the last part he is about to stick his penis into her and calls it her \"tail\". Pietro screams that he doesn't want a tail. Don Gianni turns around and tells Pietro that his screaming ruined it so now she can't turn into a horse.\nHeaven and Hell:\nThe eighth episode (based on Seventh day, tenth tale) involves two characters from Naples named Meuccio and Tingoccio who agree to tell each other about Heaven or Hell when they die.

After being fired by the Queen (Karin Schubert) over allegations he illegitimately fathered a child with a royal handmaid, Salluste plots to get his revenge by compromising the Queen by getting a nobleman to seduce her, which would anger the King (Alberto de Mendoza). When Don C\u00e9sar (Gabriele Tinti), Salluste's noble relative, declines to help him, Salluste hires his valet, Blaze (Yves Montand), who he introduces as Don C\u00e9sar; he sells the real C\u00e9sar into slavery in the Barbary Coast. Though the Queen is willing to enter a relationship with \"C\u00e9sar\", Salluste's plans are unintentionally obstructed by Dona Juana (Alice Sapritch), an old duanna who is infatuated with Blaze, much to his chagrin.\nBlaze takes Salluste's former position as finance minister. However, unlike Salluste, Blaze is generous and institutes many reforms: he gives almost all of Salluste's riches to the peasants, and heavily taxes the rich instead of the poor. This makes Blaze the target of ire among the nobles, who attempt to assassinate him. Salluste learns of a plot to poison Blaze's cake at his birthday celebration in a villa and warns Blaze; the two fight their way out, evading their pursuers by trapping them in a bullfighting ring. However, upon escaping, Salluste captures Blaze. Meanwhile, in the Barbary Coast, the real C\u00e9sar is working as a slave for a Bedouin chief, pushing a wheel alongside other slaves to water the chief's potted plant. Using the Bedouins' prayers as a distraction, C\u00e9sar escapes and travels back to Spain, where he watches Salluste take Blaze captive.\nAfter using an uncooperative parrot to relay an invitation to the Queen (and also unintentionally Dona Juana), Salluste imprisons Blaze in his villa, where he explains his new plan: he will bring the Queen to the room, knock both of them out, leave them in bed together, and call the King to investigate. C\u00e9sar locates the villa and confronts Blaze, and the two work together to thwart Salluste. Dona Juana arrives and attempts to seduce Blaze, but she drinks a laced cup of wine and falls unconscious. When the Queen arrives, Salluste knocks her out with chloroform. After encountering several issues involving the occupants of the bed, Salluste manages to get Blaze and the Queen in bed together.\nThe King and his guards arrive, having been called over by Salluste earlier. However, when Salluste leads the King into the bedroom, he is shocked to find that Blaze is in bed with Dona Juana; Blaze secretly helped C\u00e9sar escape with the Queen, and the two of them fall in love.\nThe King, angered at Salluste, orders his guards to capture him. However, he offers Blaze a choice: marry Dona Juana and remain free, or join Salluste in captivity. Blaze chooses the latter, and the two are sentenced to slavery in the Barbary Coast, under the same Bedouin chief from before. Though Salluste and Blaze are apparently content with their life as slaves, Blaze sees Dona Juana in the distance and realizes she has followed him to the Barbary Coast.

Many years later, he tells the story to a reporter who wishes to write an article about it and take pictures of his castle. However, the Baron opposes any photographs being taken. Despite his protests, the young woman goes up to visit the castle and takes pictures but is killed when a dry thunderstorm suddenly rolls in while she is in close proximity to it. Her body is taken back to the town, where it is discovered she has a burn in the shape of a cloven hoof on her arm, which is confirmed as the Mark of the Devil.\nSometime later, a group of tourists become stranded when the bridge they have to cross has been destroyed in a flood. They meet Satan in the guise of a strange-looking man who recommends that they take the ferry boat, but they arrive too late to catch the last ferry of the day.

Hans, the butler, greets them and shows them to their rooms, giving them a briefing of the history of three of the rooms, one of which bears the same cloven hoof mark on the floor tiles in front of the fireplace. After the guests have been accommodated to their rooms, Hans goes down to a laboratory basement and informs the Baron who is practicing alchemy. Over dinner, the Baron explains his family's history to his guests. His ancestor made a pact and sold his soul to the Devil in exchange for his services. Satan demanded that the eldest daughter of each generation become a succubus. When asked if he ever had a daughter, he shakes his head no.\nA young woman named Lisa M\u00fcller also comes to stay at the castle and proceeds to seduce each tourist according to their own personal weaknesses, then kills them, using their own sin against them. Each tourist is a representative of one of the Seven Deadly Sins. Matt Ducard represents Gluttony and dies by choking to death while gorging on food and wine. Nancy dies representing Greed by drowning in a hidden treasure hoard of powdered gold. Howard, representing Envy, is killed when he is guillotined, and Corrine, embodying Lust, is murdered when she is trapped inside an iron maiden while they are in the middle of an adulterous tryst. Short-tempered old Mr. Mason represents Wrath and dies when he is thrown out of a window and is impaled on an iron fence below. Regine dies as Sloth when a snake kills her in her sleep.

Some scenes in the description are omitted from other versions.In 17th-century France, Cardinal Richelieu is influencing Louis XIII in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from rising up. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its Governor not to damage the town.\nMeanwhile, in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier, a dissolute, proud and popular priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Jean Mignon, another priest in the town; Grandier is, however, unaware that the neurotic, hunchbacked Sister Jeanne des Anges, the abbess of the local Ursuline convent, is sexually obsessed with him. Sister Jeanne asks for Grandier to become the convent's new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeleine De Brou, but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, who becomes jealous. When Madeleine returns a book by Ursuline foundress Angela Merici that Sister Jeanne had earlier lent her, the abbess attacks her and accuses her of being a \"fornicator\" and \"sacrilegious\".\nBaron Jean de Laubardemont arrives with orders to demolish the city, overriding Grandier's orders to stop. Grandier summons the town's soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be their new confessor. She informs him of Grandier's marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her, which Mignon relays to Laubardemont. In the process, the information is pared down to just the claim that Grandier has bewitched the convent and dealt with the Devil. With Grandier away from Loudon, Laubardemont and Mignon decide to find evidence against him.\nLaubardemont summons inquisitor Father Pierre Barre, a \"professional witch-hunter,\" whose interrogations involve depraved acts of \"exorcism\", including the forced administration of enemas to his victims. Sister Jeanne claims that Grandier has bewitched her, and the other nuns do the same. A public exorcism erupts in a church, in which the nuns remove their clothes and enter a state of \"religious\" frenzy. Duke Henri de Cond\u00e9 (actually King Louis in disguise) arrives, claiming to be carrying a holy relic which can exorcise the \"devils\" possessing the nuns. Father Barre then proceeds to use the relic in \"exorcising\" the nuns, who then act as though they have been cured - until Cond\u00e9/Louis reveals the case allegedly containing the relic to be empty. The possessions and the exorcisms then continue unabated, descending into a massive orgy in which the nuns remove the crucifix from above the high altar and masturbate with it.\nDuring the chaos, Grandier and Madeleine return. Grandier denies bewitching the nuns and condemns Sister Jeanne, but he and Madeleine are arrested nonetheless. The nuns are returned to the convent, where Sister Jeanne attempts to hang herself, but is cut down before she dies. After being given a show trial, Grandier is shaven and tortured. The judges sentence Grandier to death by burning at the stake. Laubardemont has also obtained permission to destroy the city's fortifications. Despite pressure to confess to the charges, Grandier refuses, and is taken to be burnt at the stake. His executioner promises to strangle him rather than let him suffer death by fire, but Barre starts the fire himself, and Mignon, visibly panic-stricken about the possibility of Grandier's innocence, pulls the noose tight before it can be used to strangle Grandier. As Grandier burns, Laubardemont orders for explosive charges to be set off and the city walls are blown up, causing the revelling townspeople to flee.\nAfter the execution, Barre leaves Loudun to continue his witch-hunting activities elsewhere in the Vienne region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Laubardemont informs Sister Jeanne that Mignon has been put away in an asylum for claiming that Grandier was innocent, and that \"with no signed confession to prove otherwise, everyone has the same opinion\". He gives her Grandier's charred femur and leaves. Sister Jeanne kisses and masturbates with the bone.

The bank is closed and evacuated while Joe uses duplicate keys to empty the criminals' three safe deposit boxes into Dawn's large-size deposit box.

Despite the fact that Kessel insists on burning through the wall to rescue Joe instead of waiting for the time lock to open, Joe succeeds in the heist and is hailed as a hero for \"preventing\" the robbery of the gold bar.\nThe next day, the three criminals, one by one, discover that their boxes are empty, and thus they cannot complete their illegal schemes, nor do they dare to go to the police to report the thefts, since they would then risk revealing their own dishonest pasts.

Among them is Wenlie, who needs to raise money to pay for an operation for his sick mother, despite the objections of his girlfriend, Yulan.\nFan Ko, meanwhile, is nosing around at Lumpini stadium, and thinks that a fighter named Miller may be his brother after he sees a large plywood cutout of the boxer and notices the anchor-and-bird tattoo. He asks a bystander, an old fighter-turned-alcoholic, what the man's name is. \"People call him 'dead man',\" the old drunk says, because he's the next to face Cannon.\nWhen Miller faces Cannon, Fan Ko tries in vain to stop the fight, and Miller is pummeled \u2013 another fighter killed in the ring.

Fan Ko is watching the fight and sees the tattoo on Wenlie's arm \u2013 it's a ship's anchor with a swallow underneath. Wenlie is Fan Ko's brother. The fight against Cannon is a tough one, but Wenlie is a strong fighter and he comes back from a savage beating to win. Fan Ko runs up to the ringside and tells Wenlie that they are brothers.\nMiller's brother Misao kills Cannon after the match, incurring the wrath of the villains. They storm Wenlie's place when he is not at home and kidnap Misao. When the brothers are ambushed, the two brothers are formidable and beat down the thugs and the main stooge. He tells them that they have kidnapped Misao, so the two brothers go to fetch him.\nAt the house, Misao is beaten and killed, and the two  brothers face off against a large group of weapon wielding henchmen. Fan Ko takes on the goons while Wenlie faces Qiang-ren. When a henchman cuts Wenlie's arm, Fan Ke disembowels the man with his skills and the henchmen run off.

Rescuing a drunken farmer, Mr Parker (John Mills) who has fallen and cut his head, she discovers his hat is stuffed with cash, and inveigles him to hire her as a housekeeper by voluntarily cleaning his filthy, chicken-ridden house. Her motivation is partly to escape her tyrannical father (Bernard Lee) and mother, who treat her as a skivvy and unpaid child-minder and verbally abuse her.\nParker's sexual interest in Dulcima deepens after she arrives for work in a revealing outfit. A widower, he invites her to become his live-in housekeeper. Dulcima accepts but keeps him at arm's length by creating a fictitious boyfriend, 'Albert', inspired by a male model she has seen in a magazine.\nShowing off, Parker introduces Dulcima to his crooked dealings at the local livestock auction. As her employment continues he neglects to pay her. She however keeps a careful tally of money he owes her. The relationship becomes one of mutual deceit as well as mutual convenience.\nParker tries to spy on Dulcima as she bathes, and later invites her to join him for a beer in the parlour, but she excuses herself. Now knowing that he has a lot of cash stowed away, she begins to coquettishly encourage his increasingly lustful interest, from time to time reminding him he owes her wages, but he always deflects the demand.\nDulcima meets Ashby, a young gamekeeper who resembles 'Albert' her fantasy boyfriend (both are played by Stuart Wilson). When Parker spots Ashby rounding up pheasants which have strayed onto his farm he fears that 'Albert' is spying on him and Dulcima. She plays on this jealousy and paranoia.\nTo try to get Parker to pay her what she is owed she pretends to be packing to leave. Panicked at this prospect, Parker offers to pay, and she claims \u00a340 rather than the \u00a320 or so she is really entitled to. Parker agrees but tries to trick her with only \u00a315. This payment is explicitly linked with her letting him sleep with her (she later takes the \u00a325 shortfall from his secret cash tin). Thereafter there are several dialogue references to sexual favours as 'little extras' that must be paid for\u2212.

They are clearly interested in each other.\nParker decides to ask Dulcima to marry him but having met Ashby she asks for time to consider. In attempts to persuade her Parker buys a TV set so that they will have something to do on winters evenings when they are married, and 'reveals' the hoard of cash she already knows about.\nIn town, we see Parker untypically cheerful and benevolent at the market while Dulcima spots Ashby there and purposely gets the same bus home as he does. That evening, Parker has bought himself a new suit and a wedding dress for Dulcima but, distracted, she doesn't unbox it, instead telling Parker she is going out to visit her family. Suspicious, he follows her and sees her meet Ashby in a field, kiss him and head off toward his house (Parker still thinks this is \"Albert\"). Ashby and Dulcima go dancing. Parker gets drunk and becomes violent and abusive when she returns. She says she will leave in the morning and locks herself in her room. Parker smashes the living room furniture, including the new TV, and tears up the unwanted wedding dress, then remorsefully pleads forgiveness through her locked bedroom door. She remains silent.\nIn the final scene Dulcima next morning sees Ashby come into the farmyard through her bedroom window.

The film opens with Knievel (Hamilton) at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. Knievel is speaking directly to the camera describing his upcoming daredevil motorcycle jump:\n\nLadies and gentlemen, you have no idea how good it makes me feel to be here today. It is truly an honor to risk my life for you. An honor. Before I jump this motorcycle over these 19 cars \u2014 and I want you to know there's not a Volkswagen or a Datsun in the row \u2014 before I sail cleanly over that last truck, I want to tell you that last night a kid came up to me and he said, \"Mr Knievel, are you crazy? That jump you're going to make is impossible, but I already have my tickets because I want to see you splatter.\" That's right, that's what he said. And I told that boy last night that nothing is impossible. Now they told Columbus to sail across the ocean was impossible. They told the settlers to live in a wild land was impossible. They told the Wright Brothers to fly was impossible. And they probably told Neil Armstrong a walk on the moon was impossible. They tell Evel Knievel to jump a motorcycle across the Grand Canyon is impossible, and they say that every day. A Roman General in the time of Caesar had the motto: \"If it is possible, it is done. If it is impossible, it will be done.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, is what I live by.\nFollowing his introduction, the story follows a flashback narrative through Knievel's life.\nThe film ends with Knievel successfully completing the February 1971 jump at the Ontario Motor Speedway (129 feet) and riding off onto a dirt road which leads to the edge of the Grand Canyon (at the time of production, Evel Knievel was hyping a jump over the Grand Canyon, a jump which never got beyond the early planning stage).", "tmdb_id": 139324}, "34328420": {"title": "Face-Off (1971 film)", "plot": "Hockey player Billy Duke joins the Toronto Maple Leafs, and must adapt to the big league game with assistance from his room-mate, George Armstrong.

The failing grade kept him from graduating from high school, causing Raymond's life to begin a downward spiral for which he blames the teacher, Miss Mary Bloomquist.\nAs Raymond stalks Mary on the eve of her retirement, the authorities are trying to find him, but they have no idea where he is going. In spite of the visions in his head and having been diagnosed as a \u201cparanoiac\u201d, Raymond does not seem especially threatening, presenting a calm (if somewhat distracted) demeanor marked by a notably polite manner. His first attempt at achieving his goal of retaking and passing the test is sidetracked by Miss Bloomquist\u2019s mistaking him for a helper answering her want ad. Raymond spends time packing Mary\u2019s belongings in her classroom and tying up boxes, only to miss his opportunity when Mary\u2019s coworkers burst in to take her to a surprise retirement party.\nRaymond then goes to Mary\u2019s home, but his attempt to break in is interrupted by children playing hide-and-seek. He spends the night in a boarding house, and returns to the school the next day, which is also the last day of the school year. As Raymond waits for the school to empty, he discovers that there is a man with Mary, and hides in a nearby classroom.\nThe man is Mary\u2019s former lover, a married teacher with whom she broke up 10 years previously. He transferred to another school, but returned in the current school year to become the new English department head. He believes that Mary is taking early retirement because his return is too painful for her, but she straightens him out by revealing that it is her disillusionment with her abilities as a teacher that is the reason she\u2019s moving to England. Somewhat crestfallen, he leaves.\nMeanwhile, the detective searching for Raymond has returned to the hospital, and\u2014with the help of Raymond\u2019s doctor\u2014gains a valuable clue to Raymond\u2019s whereabouts. The detective spends hours going through newspapers in the hospital library in search of the one from which Raymond tore out an article.\nRaymond's reappearance takes Mary by surprise. He says because she overpaid him, he has come back to finish. What he has come back to finish becomes clear when he takes Mary hostage until dark, when he forces her to give him the same test he took 10 years earlier. This time, he answers the last two questions that he did not complete the first time, but fails again, spurring him to attack Mary with murderous intent.\nAs he approaches her with a garrote fashioned from twine, he trips over a box in the aisle and falls, allowing Mary to escape the classroom. As he searches for her in the darkened school, Raymond\u2019s shouted, disconnected ramblings about \u201cwelfare money\u201d and being called stupid, combined with the information he shared earlier about his troubled life, give Mary an inspiration. She uses a commanding \u201cteacher voice\u201d to tell him to sit down and behave in her classroom. Just then, Raymond finds the light switch, illuminating the auditorium they are in.

There is also a doctor and his wife, Riccardo and Sofia Bini. Sofia, being crippled, seems to not be having the best time. The party also includes Helene, who was at one point romantically involved with Andrea, but could not continue due to his drinking problem. All of them seem to have a ride home, except for John who prefers to walk. Whilst walking, he is attacked and nearly killed by an unseen assailant in the tunnel. A nearby couple by the names of Walter Auer and Giulia Soavi come to John\u2019s aid. It is implied that Walter catches a glimpse of the attacker but does not go to the police immediately.\nAndrea wakes up the next morning to his new girlfriend, Lu, informing him that the telephone has been ringing off the hook. When he finally answers, he hears about John\u2019s attack, as he is a reporter. Andrea wants to get information out of John about his attacker but is stopped due to the hospital\u2019s strict visiting rules. He learns about the two witnesses and visits Giulia, who wants nothing to do with the case and threatens to call her father. After this, Andrea returns home to find that Lu has gone out.\nNot being able to get information from John Lubbock himself, Andrea pays his former lover Helene a visit. She tells him everything she knows about John, including his apparent attraction towards Isabel, which could lead to a motive for his attack. John is then shown to be escorted by Dr. Richard Bini a week after his attack. After a while, Richard checks in on Sofia at home, though he cannot stay, due to his work. As Sofia lies in bed, a record of sorts starts blasting outside her room. She crawls over to her wheelchair to investigate the noise. After finding that it has been moved away from its original place, she crawls over to the top of the stairs where she is grabbed from behind by a gloved assailant. She is strangled and thrown down the stairs.\nThinking John\u2019s attack and Sofia\u2019s murder might be connected, Andrea attempts to recall who could have known John was walking home that night. He states Helene, Edouard, Isabel, and Richard were the only ones he could remember. A detective informs Andrea that Richard does in fact have an alibi for when his wife was killed. He was visiting a friend, who just so happens to be Edouard. It is confirmed that the two cases are connected when they realize that a glove was found at both the John Lubbock crime scene and Sofia Bini\u2019s. However, at Sofia\u2019s, the glove seemed to be missing one of the spots a finger would go. They suspect that this could mean that there are four more victims on the way.\nAndrea talks to Richard about the case. He claims that they had received a suspicious phone call prior to Sofia\u2019s death, though he could not tell if it was a man or a woman. Andre gets suspicious of Richard when he later follows him. He finds him paying a large sum of cash to Walter, the witness of the John Lubbock attack. He then starts following Walter and witnesses him get in a car with Lu, his very own girlfriend. Outraged, he confronts her later that night. He learns that Walter is her brother and not in fact a lover. The next day, he finds Walter racing, as he is a professional racer. Walter keeps quiet about who he saw attack John in the tunnel and later is shown calling Richard.\nAndrea finally pays John a visit. He is back at work, finishing a day of teaching his class. Though he is well enough to return to work, he still must wear a neck brace. Right as they begin talking, they are interrupted by Edouard, who teaches at the same school as John. Whilst Andrea gives John a ride home, he learns that he too had gotten a mysterious phone call, but unlike Sofia\u2019s, he claims that there seemed to be nobody on the other end. That night while doing some work, Andrea receives a threatening call from who he presumes is the killer. The voice on the other end warns Andrea to stop pushing to solve the case.\nThe next day, Andrea is fired from his job. He confides in Helene, who decides to give him a chance to fix their relationship. Meanwhile, Andrea\u2019s former boss is walking on a path through the forest where he encounters the killer. He is pursued by the knife wielding killer, but ultimately has a heart attack and dies. A funeral is held for Sofia the following day. In attendance is all the suspects, including Richard. Andrea also encounters John, still healing from his attack. Also in attendance is Edouard and his lover Isabel. Andrea later learns that his former boss who had previously fired him, had been killed the previous night. This casts suspicion upon himself as he has no alibi. He also was acquainted with the two that were killed and John, who of course survived his ordeal.\nRichard, who is still Andrea\u2019s prime suspect, attends a private get together with his friend Edouard. Here, Andrea learns that they are together to watch the young couple, Walter and Giulia, have sexual intercourse, which is illegal as they are both technically minors. This makes Andrea realize this was why Richard was previously paying Walter money. Instead of going to the police, he decides to eventually use this to get information from Walter about who he witnessed attack John. That same night, Andrea decides to talk to Edouard\u2019s soon to be wife, Isabel. He goes to her apartment and finds that she had been killed in her very own bathroom. The usual glove, now with only two fingers remaining, is left floating in the bathtub with her.\nAfter being informed about Isabel\u2019s death, John gives in his notice at the school and decides to move back to Australia. He explains he has no more reason to live in Italy now with Isabel dead. Nothing has come from his stay besides being viciously attacked which left him still wearing a neck brace and finding out Isabel was going to marry his friend Edouard. Before getting information out of Walter, he attempts to try and get the truth out of Giulia once more but finds that she is not home. This is because she is prostituting herself at a nearby lake. After meeting with one of her \u201ccustomers\u201d, her throat is slit by the killer.\nAfter not being able to find Giulia, he decides it is not worth the trouble and goes ahead and confronts Walter. It is here revealed that John\u2019s attacker was Giulia\u2019s father, who attacked John after mistaking him for Walter himself. The only problem is that John\u2019s attack couldn\u2019t have been done by the same person that\u2019s been killing everyone as every murder has been on a Tuesday, which is when Giulia\u2018s father allegedly goes up North for his occupation. Gaining next to nothing from this, he confronts Richard, who claims to have not been soliciting the two minors. Nervous that the police may be onto them for their involvement in the prostitution of the two, he calls Edouard in a panic.\nThe following week, Helene is driven to the airport to meet with her lawyer to discuss details of the divorce she had with her ex-husband, Charles, who is also the father of their child, Tony.   She will not be back until later that night however so Tony will be at home alone. This is a cause for concern Andrea realizes as it is Tuesday, which means another murder is likely to happen in their circle. Andrea rushes over to Helene\u2019s house to find Tony being strangled by the killer, now shown to be wearing a mask. Andrea saves Tony and chases after the killer. The chase comes to a brief end once the two find themselves at an area of construction. This does not stop Andrea however from having a struggle with the killer on the second story of the construction site. The struggle ends when Andrea throws the killer over the railing. He is unmasked and revealed to be John Lubbock, who committed the murders to cover up his real motive, which was jealousy over Edouard marrying Isabel. However, in a surprising twist, John is not in love with Isabel, but rather his friend Edouard. He killed Isabel so he could be with Edouard and killed the others to make it look like the work of a psychopath who was the same person who allegedly attacked him in the tunnel.

The next scene is of Marthe, standing at a bridge, at the brink of suicide. Jacques is walking by and stops her. He urges her back onto the street, indicating a police car stopped nearby. They sit by the bridge and chat about their lives. The scene cuts to flashbacks.\nMarthe is a young woman who lives with her mother in a flat. To make ends meet, her mother rents a spare bedroom to male boarders, the most recent of which is a graduate student. In one scene during the flashback, Marthe stands nude in front of her mirror, either scrutinizing or admiring her body. While doing this, she hears the boarder knocking on her wall. She ignores him at that point, but eventually Marthe and the boarder become lovers, without her mother knowing. Sadly, immediately after their affair begins the boarder has to move to the United States to study at an American university for a year. The lovers promise to be faithful to one another and reunite at the end of the year. At the present time, Marthe has learned that her lover returned to Paris several days ago and has made no attempt to contact her, leading to her despair and suicide attempt.\nJacques' story is also told in flashbacks at this time. He is a young artist who lives alone in a desolate little flat that doubles as his studio. In the present time, Jacques comforts Marthe and advises her to write to her lover. Marthe says she will, but she asks if Jacques might take the letter for her to friends of her lover and return with his response the following night. When Jacques wonders how the letter could be procured so quickly, Marthe pulls her letter, addressed and ready, out of her pocket.\nDuring the daytime scenes of the movie, Jacques works on his paintings. Part of his artistic process involves recording himself on a tape recorder telling the story of meeting Marthe and loving Marthe. He also records himself repeating Marthe's name. While he paints, he plays his recordings. He also listens to the recordings while delivering Marthe's messages and, in one scene, while riding a bus, scaring two middle-aged women.\nJacques' canvases are large, around 6 ft by 4 ft. He paints with them flat on the floor, crouching over them. He uses broad strokes and primary colors. Jacques acts as messenger between Marthe and her lover. The lover never writes back to Marthe, and she is devastated. But by the fourth night, she professes her love for Jacques, who loves her as well. They kiss, and he buys her a red scarf.\nMarthe and Jacques are walking down the street, arm-in-arm, when they run into Marthe's former lover. Marthe runs to her lover and kisses him. Then she runs back to Jacques and kisses him. Finally, she returns to her former lover, and they walk off together, leaving Jacques alone.

In New York City, detectives Jimmy \"Popeye\" Doyle and Buddy \"Cloudy\" Russo go out for drinks at the Copacabana. Popeye notices Salvatore \"Sal\" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld. Popeye learns that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive within two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.\nDevereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase while Weinstock urges patience, knowing they are being investigated. Charnier realizes he is being observed. He \"makes\" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway shuttle at Grand Central Station. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York City, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned. Soon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye shouts to a policeman on the train to stop Nicoli and then commandeers a car.

A battered Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye. After a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, he and his team tear the car apart piece by piece, searching for the drugs, but seemingly come up empty handed. Then, Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight; they realize that the contraband must still be in the car. Finally, they remove the rocker panels and discover the hidden packages of heroin. The police reassemble and return the car to Devereaux, who delivers it to Charnier.\nCharnier drives to an old factory on Wards Island to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France.

After meeting with the police once again, Troshkin gets some money and new clothes, and also asks the police to free his gang from prison sentence for being helpful.\nArriving in Moscow, the gang settles in an old house, prepared for demolition. While Troshkin, Crosseyes and Sad Sack travel around Moscow to find any clues, Vasiliy Alibabaevich keeps their home. Later, Sad Sack steals Troshkin's money, which forces him to take some more from his own apartment, again making it look like a robbery to his accomplices. Then Alibabayevich accidentally sets fire to the gang's house, after which Troshkin, having arranged with Professor Maltsev, moves with the gang to Maltsev's country house. Professor's daughter, Lyudmila, comes to visit them, thinking they're archeologists, after Maltsev himself told her so.\nGradually, Troshkin outlines the circle of communication of the real Docent. One of the former accomplices declares to him that he has quit the life of crime, and throws Troshkin down the staircase. Another accomplice, Prokhorov the checkroom attendant, arranges a meeting at the square near the Bolshoi Theater. Prokhorov sends his accomplice Mityai to Troshkin, whom he does not recognize. Mityai becomes convinced that the man is not the real Docent, and Prokhorov decides not to go to the meeting. Both are convinced that Troshkin is an undercover agent. Prokhorov quits his job and hides in Mityai's apartment.\nPolice officers inform Troshkin that the real Docent has broken free from the prison and will probably soon try to track down his henchmen, so the operation must be immediately curtailed. Troshkin asks for a permission to stay with the gang to celebrate the New Year: being in such company for a long time, he made a decision to awaken the criminals' conscience and make them rethink their lives, even if he had to do it without dropping the crime boss masquerade. At Maltsev's country house, during a chime of the New Year's Eve, Troshkin makes a speech completely atypical for a bandit, but the gang are not at all surprised: they consider his speech to be simply a ruse for another crime and recall Docent's past atrocities.\nMeanwhile, the real Docent comes to Mityai's place, where he meets Prokhorov. Both assume that he's the same fake Docent they've encountered earlier. Docent asks them to give him a hideout. Under this pretext, Mityai and Prokhorov lure him to the roof of an apartment building under construction, where Mityai tries to stab Docent, but he kills Mityai by pushing him off the roof. Prokhorov then whimpers in fear and agrees to help Docent out.\nBack at the country house, Troshkin gives the gang presents, and also hands Sad Sack a letter from his relatives, which Troshkin received during a meeting with the police. The criminals are getting more and more annoyed at the concept of Docent bossing them around, threatening them with violence and, as they see it, only prolonging their potential prison sentences with crime schemes. Sad Sack, having read the letter and not having stood the torments of conscience, tries to hang himself, yet is saved promptly. After the ambulance leaves, the criminals are afraid that the ambulance doctor would give them out to the police, but Troshkin lies to them that he has killed the doctor to leave no witnesses. This makes the last straw for Alibabayevich and the other criminals, and they decide to subdue \"Docent\" and voluntarily surrender to justice.\nTroshkin, feeling unhappy with his masquerade, finally tries to reveal himself to the gang, but they quickly bound and gag him. Crosseyes swears to cut ties with the crime world after he's released from prison, and recalls how, before the arrest, Docent made him to dive into an ice-hole at the lake for some reason. Immediately, Sad Sack realises that the stolen helmet is hidden in the lake, and the trio sets off to the local boat station, where the real Docent finds them, armed with a knife. He orders Crosseyes to retrieve the helmet from an ice-hole, then takes it and leaves, forcing the gang to take care of the naked Crosseyes. At the same time, Professor Maltsev's daughter arrives at the country house to visit the so-called archeologists once again. Troshkin takes her car, rushes to the boat station and comes face to face with his criminal doppelganger. After a short fight, Crosseyes, Sad Sack and Vasiliy Alibabayevich knock out Docent and then Troshkin with an oar, and decide to turn them both in to the police, believing that two Docents will reduce their prison sentences much more than one.\nThe police take both Docents away, and Professor Maltsev finally gets his precious helmet back. Then the police cars leave, while Crosseyes, Sad Sack and Vasiliy Alibabayevich are left standing there, not having a clue why the police have not taken them away as well. At that time, one of the cars stops and Troshkin comes out, this time without the toupee. Seeing this, the trio runs away in shock down the road (thinking that he has been \"shaved clean\" for prison and projecting that the same fate awaits them) while Troshkin chases after them to say goodbye.", "tmdb_id": 20871}, "175668": {"title": "Get Carter", "plot": "Newcastle-born gangster Jack Carter has lived in London for years in the employ of organised crime bosses Gerald and Sid Fletcher.

His bosses warn him not to stir up trouble, as they are friendly with the Newcastle mob. Unsatisfied with the official explanation, Jack investigates for himself. At the funeral, Jack meets his teenaged niece Doreen, and Frank's evasive mistress, Margaret.\nJack goes to Newcastle Racecourse, seeking his old acquaintance Albert Swift for information about his brother's death, but Swift evades him. Jack encounters another old associate, Eric Paice, who refuses to tell Jack who is employing him as a chauffeur. Tailing Eric leads him to the country house of crime boss Cyril Kinnear. Jack confronts Kinnear but learns little from him; he also meets a glamorous drunken woman, Glenda. As Jack leaves, Eric warns him against damaging relations between Kinnear and the Fletchers. Back in town, Jack is threatened by henchmen who want him to leave town, but he fights them off, capturing and interrogating one to find out who wants him gone. He is told the name \"Brumby\".\nJack knows Cliff Brumby as a businessman with controlling interests in local seaside amusement arcades.

Forcing Glenda into the boot of her own car, Jack drives off to find Albert.\nJack tracks down Albert, who confesses he told Brumby that Doreen was Frank's daughter. Brumby showed Frank the film to incite him to call the police on Kinnear so Eric and two of his men arranged Frank's death. Having extracted this information, Jack fatally stabs Albert. Jack is attacked by the London gangsters and Eric, who has informed Fletcher of Jack and Anna's affair. In the ensuing shootout, Jack shoots Peter dead. As Eric and Con escape, they push the sports car into the river, unaware that Glenda is in the boot. Returning to the car park, Jack finds and beats Brumby before throwing him to his death. He then posts the film to the Scotland Yard vice squad.\nJack abducts Margaret.

In 1971, having lived about twenty-five years Down Under, one of those immigrants, middle-aged Amedeo Battipaglia, a lineman in the remote New South Wales settlement bearing the (fictional) name of Bun Bun Ga, several kilometers from the outback city of Broken Hill, is about to meet Carmela, his prospective bride from Rome, with whom he has been corresponding.  Each of them misrepresented facts to the other \u2014 Carmela, a very attractive Calabrian woman in her early thirties, is a semiliterate prostitute seeking an opportunity to get away from her abusive pimp, with the letters to Amedeo ghostwritten by her friend Rosalba, while Amedeo, feeling inadequate about his ordinary appearance, sent Carmela a photograph, taken about ten years earlier, of himself between two Italian immigrant friends, Giuseppe Bartoni and Bampo.  The arrow in the photo, however, is over Giuseppe because, when Amedeo visited his tall, handsome friend for advice, Giuseppe erased the arrow over Amedeo's head and pencilled it over his own head.\nIn Rome, getting a ride to the airport on the back of a friend's motorcycle, with her pimp in pursuit, Carmela arrives at the boarding gate, meets Rosalba who hands her the travel documents, has a final across-the-gate shouting match with her pimp, and takes a seat in Qantas first class next to a turbaned passenger perusing Life (issue of 19 February 1971).  A stewardess points out that her ticket is for tourist class with special discount for immigrants.  Meanwhile, Amedeo drives his substandard auto nearly 1600 kilometers to Brisbane Airport, where Carmela's flight, filled with other Italian mail-order brides (as well as those from neighboring Yugoslavia) will land.  Sitting at the airport lounge with numerous Italian men awaiting their future wives, they pass around outdated photographs that the women had sent to their prospective mates and speculate whether their appearances had changed.  Still uncertain of recognizing Carmela from the black-and-white photo of her as a young peasant girl, he examines and questions a few of the newly arrived women and then is hit with realization as she slowly comes into view on the down escalator.  Becoming disconcerted by her beauty, he retreats to the airport's bar where, sharing a drink with a balding Italian who sent a photo of himself with a full head of hair, he expresses his own self-doubts.  Convinced that she will reject him, he returns to the arrivals area, introduces himself as Giuseppe and hands her a note, purportedly written by Amedeo, explaining that he is ill with the flu and requesting that Giuseppe, a trusted friend, provide an escort to her new home.\nUnable to decide how to resolve this situation, Amedeo tells Carmela that driving to Giuseppe's home in Broken Hill would take three days, but as the trip starts, they are seen riding not southwest of Brisbane, but thousands of kilometers off-course in the city of Cairns, a gateway to the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland's tropical far north.  The brightly colored lush greenery provides a picturesque background for an eventful multi-day journey down the coast of eastern Australia, with one of the stops at Barrier Reef's Dunk Island, a popular tourist vacation spot, which provides the opportunity for the rental of a rowboat and, as Amedeo rows, Carmela strips to her underwear and dives into the warm water, revealing her skill as an expert swimmer, speedily maneuvering amidst brilliantly colored fish and corals, while Amedeo sits in the boat, peering downward with concern.  As the long trip to Broken Hill continues, they become better acquainted and she learns of his hardships as an immigrant and also finds out, since it happens in front of her, that, due to a years-earlier bout of malaria, he is subject to occasional epileptic-like convulsions which leave him unable to function for a few hours.  Further along, they stop for a visit to the nursing home where Bampo is a long-term patient, having become unresponsive as a result of malarial damage to his brain and nervous system.\nAs Amedeo's small auto, unable to withstand the long journey, breaks down, they push and pull into a town and try to sell it in an Italian-speaking neighborhood, but run into some hostile local Italians who force Carmela into their car and drive away with her while Amedeo hangs on to their door handle, as the car veers off into a ditch and flips on its side.  Shaken but unhurt, they go off to board a train, but when he has another malarial attack during a station stop and she rushes off the train to get help, it pulls out, leaving her behind.  Seeing no other recourse, she decides to briefly take up her former profession in order to earn enough for continuing the journey.   Now on her own, she takes a later train and, as it stops at the small town of Menindee, she sees Amedeo waiting at the station.  Reunited, they continue to Broken Hill, which is a little over a hundred kilometers further.  Upon arrival, Carmela meets Giuseppe, whom Amedeo, still pretending to be Giuseppe, introduces as her betrothed, Amedeo.  After a few pleasantries, Giuseppe who, as it turns out, is himself a pimp, leaves after driving Carmela to the back entrance of what he describes as her new apartment, but which quickly reveals itself as a prostitute's walk-up house situated in the city's red light district amidst numerous other such dwellings, each with its own resident \"working girl\" sitting on the porch.  Amedeo finds out where Giuseppe has taken Carmela, goes to the red light neighborhood and approaches her porch, hoping to offer an explanation, but she goes inside to get her switchblade and attacks him, inflicting a stab wound in his shoulder.\nEventually, Carmela and Amedeo, with his arm in a sling, are on a train, as he is still trying to convince her of his honorable intentions by offering to pay for her trip back to Italy but she begins to cry that she was a prostitute there and, upon returning, would be beaten by her pimp.  Dismayed and outraged, he jumps up and exclaims (in Italian) to all the passengers that she has cheated and deceived him, but when she tells him that he was equally untruthful, he says that he forgives her and she slaps him, retorting that no one needs his forgiveness.  At this point, the train is slowing to a stop and, upon spotting from the window the remoteness of the outback, she refuses to disembark at the tiny Bun Bun Ga railway shack \"in the middle of the desert\".  As she is cajoled and then forcibly pulled off the train by Amedeo and two of his Italian friends who regularly travel this route, the spectacle is witnessed, several meters further, by the group of local English-speaking residents, brandishing a \"WELCOME CARMELA\" sign, who had come to meet the train.  As Amedeo and Carmela approach, a little girl among the greeters slips a 45\" record into a portable player which starts to emit Wagner's \"Bridal Chorus\", while one of the men takes out a sheet of paper and reads a speech, which Amedeo interprets for Carmela into Italian: \"Dear Carmela, this is a historical day for Bun Bun Ga.  Carmela, you come from the noble and ancient country that is Italy.  The country of Julius Caesar, the country of Michelangelo, of Galileo, the country of Guglielmo Marconi, the country of Caruso, of Bartali, and Pope Giovanni.

Their father reminds them, however, that since it has been such a long time since they heard it last, there might be a little more to the story than they remember.

He runs back to a clearing where he gathers all the other forest animals and proceeds to convince them, by his decidedly skewered viewpoint, that Goldilocks does not belong in the forest. The easily swayed animals agree to assist Bobcat.\nSubsequently, the Bobcat leads an angry mob of forest animals over to the Bears' house and demands that Papa Bear himself turn Goldilocks over to them. Of course, Papa Bear holds his ground, telling the crowd sternly: \"Now, I love this forest just as much as anybody. I'll be the first to protect it when it needs it. But this forest does NOT need protecting from a little girl who came to our house because she was lost and tired and hungry\". The Bobcat is seen blowing a raspberry to his friend and tells him they will not be mollified so easily.\nPapa Bear continues attempting to calm the crowd down and allow them to see through the Bobcat's unfounded fears, but Goldilocks sees the melee, worries that their next move will be to chase, capture, and hurt her, and tries to run away. Looking over her shoulder to make sure she is not being chased by the mob, she trips on an unseen log, and knocks herself cold. Baby Bear sees the accident and runs to get his father. Walking over to the site of the accident, followed timidly by the now somber crowd, and nobody knowing yet if Goldilocks is going to be alright or not, Papa Bear chastises the group for their reckless behavior, especially the Bobcat.\nThe animals realize they have been duped and then turn on the Bobcat, who stomps off in annoyance, unrepentant and angry at not being appreciated for \"ridding the forest of this scourge\".\nTime passes and, fortunately, Goldilocks comes around, with only a bump on the head to show for her trouble. The animals cheer at her recovery and invite her and her family each in their own way to come and enjoy the forest anytime they want.\nThe Bears find the path upon which Goldilocks got herself lost in the first place, and they, along with all the other animals, escort her safely out of the forest.\nBack to live action again on the same log on which they started their imaginary journey, the trio pick up their fish and supplies and head back to camp.

Jane secretly uses the missing candles to form a wax voodoo doll, which she uses to leave John bedridden.\nHe reveals to Ann that Jane's mother was a witch, and that Jane is as well; the reason for his parenting methods were to stop Jane from harming anybody. When Jane begins to attack John via the doll once again, he instructs Ann to find the doll and take it from Jane to stop her from killing him.

Stoker clarifies that he warned Henderson not take it, not believing it would be \"right for his personality\", but states that he gave in once Henderson insisted. He then tells his final story.\nThe Cloak (Unknown May 1939) \nTemperamental veteran horror film actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) moves into the house while starring in a vampire film being shot nearby. Henderson, a great fan of the horror genre, is angry over the lack of realism in the film, particularly over the cloak worn by his character (who happens to be a vampire). He decides to purchase a more accurate cloak, and to that end stops at an antique shop run by the enigmatic Theo von Hartmann (Geoffrey Bayldon). Von Hartmann offers him a black cloak after listening to Henderson's demands, and Henderson purchases it. Before he leaves, von Hartmann tells him to use the cloak for its intended purpose.\nWhile in his makeup room, Henderson finds that when he wears the cloak, he has no reflection. Later that day, while shooting a scene where he sucks the blood from his costar and girlfriend Carla (Ingrid Pitt), Paul begins genuinely trying to suck her blood even after the scene ends. A horrified Carla demands he stay away from her. At midnight, the witching hour, Paul puts on the cloak again as a test. He grows fangs and begins to fly, much to his horror.\nPaul reads in the newspaper that von Hartmann's shop has burned down and von Hartmann's corpse has been found inside; the corpse was identified as being several hundred years old. Paul realises that von Hartmann was a vampire, and that he gave Henderson the cloak so that he could pass his powers on to Henderson, allowing him to die. Henderson apologizes to Carla and invites her over to his home; he explains to her his predicament, but she is skeptical and demands he prove it by putting on the cloak. Henderson is reluctant, as it is midnight, but he ultimately complies. Paul is relieved to find that nothing happens, but he quickly realises that the cloak had been swapped out for a prop. Carla dons the cloak and reveals she is actually a vampire sent to turn Henderson into another vampire, as most vampires admire his portrayal of their kind. Carla flies towards a screaming Henderson and begins to turn him into a vampire.\nFramework part 5\nHolloway refuses to believe Stoker and goes to the house, despite it being nearly midnight and the house having no electricity.  He explores the house by candlelight, eventually breaking into a locked basement where he finds and kills Henderson, now a fully transformed vampire. He is himself then killed by Carla.\nThe next morning Stoker walks up to the house and breaks the fourth wall by talking to the audience \u2014 asking if they understand the secret of the house: That it reflects the personality of whoever is living in it and treats them accordingly.

They are frightened at the mention of Dracula's name, and because Jonathan plans to go to the castle by night. A woman in the carriage gives him a crucifix. The coach only takes Jonathan so far, then Dracula's carriage picks him up. The Count himself, in disguise, drives the carriage. On their way to the castle, wolves chase the carriage. The Count sends them away. At the castle, the bearded and robust Count greets Jonathan. Dracula helps Jonathan with his bags and shows him to his room, making excuses for his servants' absence. Jonathan enjoys a supper in which the Count does not join him. Jonathan and Dracula discuss the sale of Carfax, the old London estate that the Count wants to buy. Dracula tells Jonathan he must stay at the castle for a while to help the Count perfect his English.\nJonathan cuts himself shaving, and in his shaving mirror, he notices that the Count has no reflection. The sight of the blood excites the Count, but the crucifix repulses him. Dracula takes Harker's mirror and tosses it out of the window. Jonathan soon realizes that he is alone at the castle with Dracula and that Dracula is not human. He wanders around the castle, falls asleep in one room, and is attacked by three vampire women - who refer to each other as Marquess, Countess, and Madame. Dracula stops their attack and gives the women a baby to feed on. The next evening Dracula tells Jonathan to write false letters home, in which he is to say that he already has left Transylvania. A woman comes to the castle, pleading for the return of her child, but wolves kill her. That night Jonathan sees Dracula climb head-first down the castle's wall. Getting desperate to find the key to the castle's front door and escape,  Jonathan climbs out of his window and down an outer wall. He sees Romani loading coffins to the carriage in the yard.  Jonathan soon finds a vault where the three vampire women repose in coffins, each in a deathlike trance. He finds the Count, also in a coffin in a similar state. Jonathan searches Dracula for the key. Unable to find it, he tries to kill the Count with a shovel but fails. Jonathan makes a desperate leap to escape.\nBack in London, Jonathan celebrates being home from the hospital. He is among his friends- Arthur Holmwood and Lucy, Dr. John Seward, and Harker's wife, Mina. Jonathan is suffering from amnesia and has no recollection of what happened to him while he was abroad, and does not want to remember since he only knows that it was something unpleasant. Mina says that she hid his journal from him, so that he would not get upset by the memories. Lucy, meanwhile, is disappointed that he can't remember; she was looking forward to hearing what he had to say about the Carpathians since she shows interest in going there herself someday. She says she would like to borrow Jonathan's journal, and Lucy seems so impatient to do so she becomes agitated and passes out. Arthur reveals that Lucy suffers from a mysterious illness that left her pale and weak for three weeks. She also has two tiny wounds on her throat. Lucy's illness baffles Dr. Seward, so he sends for Professor Van Helsing to come from Holland to have a look at her. Van Helsing places garlic in Lucy's room and prescribes her garlic cream and peppermint tea. But Lucy removes the garlic, and Dracula enters her room. Lucy's mother, who was with her at that moment, dies of a heart attack. Lucy quickly fades away despite blood transfusion and beckons Arthur on her deathbed. Her teeth appear longer and sharper. Shortly afterward, Lucy dies and is buried. At Lucy's funeral, Mina suddenly turns around and then begins to walk towards something or somebody as if in a trance. Jonathan stops her and then sees the Count and recognizes him, but the Count vanishes. When Van Helsing asks him what's wrong, Jonathan says that he knows what's happened to him in the Carpathians and who is guilty of Lucy's death. Three nights after she was buried, Arthur is grieving in her room when he hears and sees Lucy calling to him outside. But Arthur understands that she is not Lucy anymore and repels her with garlic. Lucy leaves but wickedly promises Arthur that she will still get him, as he is still her groom. Van Helsing and others gather to discuss what they are to do now. Arthur tells them that Lucy came to him. Van Helsing shows them the newspaper, describing how three children have been kidnapped or wounded in the neck in the past few days after being kissed by a woman in white. While all the men are deeply concerned by this news, Mina is smiling strangely. Van Helsing tells them that they need to open the coffin of Lucy and cut her head off. Arthur is horrified and appalled, but Harker supports Professor. Van Helsing asks Jonathan to give him his journal, but when Harker asks his wife what she has done with it, Mina says she doesn't know what he is talking about. Jonathan finds the journal hidden among Mina's things, decides that she is tired and should go to bed.\nMina briefly touches her throat with her hand. Van Helsing leads Seward, Holmwood, and Harker to the graveyard by night. Inside the tomb, they find that Lucy's coffin is empty. Soon Lucy returns to the tomb carrying the child, which she drops when Van Helsing and others confront her. Lucy sweetly calls Arthur to come with her but retreats from Van Helsing's crucifix and returns to her tomb. Professor seals it, and they wait till daybreak. Then they re-enter Lucy's tomb, and Arthur stakes Lucy, while Van Helsing reads a prayer. A peaceful expression appears on Lucy's face, and Professor allows Arthur to kiss her.\nVan Helsing and other men discuss what they know about their enemy, Dracula. Van Helsing has written to Budapest University and from the answer knows that Count Dracula is Voivode Dracula, who became famous in battles against the Turks. He also talks about the vampire's strengths and weaknesses, including the need to rest on his home soil and how Dracula wants to increase his undead empire by moving to London. They suddenly hear the laughter in the next room, run there, and find unconscious Mina on the floor. On her neck, they discover two wounds. The men go to Carfax, a place Harker sold to Dracula in London, and sterilize the boxes with communion wafers. However, two boxes are missing. Dracula confronts them there; Jonathan swings at him with his knife, but it only slashes the Count's coat, and gold coins spill out. Jonathan realizes that they left Mina at home completely alone.\nMeanwhile, Dracula enters Mina's room, drinks her blood, then slashes his chest and makes her drink his blood, saying that now she belongs to him and if he tells her to come, she will go to him. The men burst in but are too late. Van Helsing tries to break Dracula's hold and presses a wafer to Mina's forehead, but it burns her. Professor understands that now they have to rely on Mina's psychic link to Dracula to learn where he is. They find out that Dracula is on the ship and is heading back to Transylvania. The heroes go by train to win time. When they reach Dracula's castle, Mina becomes excited, behaves as if she is at home, runs from Jonathan across the castle's halls, laughing wantonly and igniting the lights in the castle by the mere swish of her hand. The heroes spend the night in the castle, putting garlic wreaths as barriers in the room. Three vampire women appear, but they cannot enter the room. They call out to Mina, call her their sister, and promise to teach her lovely things, teach her to drink blood, promise to give her all those men who are with her now. Mina wants to go to them, but Arthur stops her. The next morning Van Helsing and Dr. Seward stake the three vampire women, and they crumble into dust.\nAfter Dracula's wagon arrives, the Romani run away upon finding he is in the coffin-shaped box they have delivered. The men try to attack Dracula, but he gets away from them, telling Harker that Mina is his and coming with him. Mina runs off again, and Jonathan once more has to go chase her down. Dracula intercepts her with open arms, but Jonathan throws a dagger that pierces his heart. Dracula turns into dust, while the mark disappears from Mina's forehead.

Ebenezer is having none of it, however, so he first tries to murder him, then has him kidnapped by sea captain Hoseason, with whom he has \"a venture for trade in the West Indies\". David is shipped off to be sold as a slave in the Carolinas. He strikes up a friendship with Alan Breck, escaping from Charles Edward Stuart's defeat at Culloden. Breck is in a coble which is run down in the fog by Hoseason's ship and once aboard, asks Hoseason to take him to France. When Hoseason refuses, Breck offers him 60 guineas to put him down on Loch Linnhe.\nOn discovering that Breck has a money belt full of Jacobite gold, Hoseason and his crew try to kill Breck, but he is forewarned by David and the two kill half a dozen of the crew before the others retreat. Hoseason offers terms to end the fighting, but the ship runs aground. Only Breck and Balfour appear to survive and they manage to get to land. They set out for Edinburgh, dodging the ruthless Redcoats. Numerous adventures follow as they meet up with Breck's family, friends and foes alike. These include Breck's cousin, James Stewart, and his daughter Catriona, with whom David falls in love. Breck hopes to incite another rebellion for Scottish independence but James Stewart and his clan would have none of it. James felt that the Battle of Culloden was terrible and unnecessary. He also reasoned with Breck that the Redcoats could never be defeated in the future as they had better tactics and cannon. Later on, a Scottish Captain of a Redcoat patrol is killed in a skirmish with the Stewart Clan on a farm. Subsequently Breck, David and Catriona quickly flee the scene, but the seriously injured James, being assumed dead, is abandoned and then captured. He gets the blame for the killing and is imprisoned in the Castle. Later on, David and Catriona part with Breck and meet up with a lawyer to defend James. They are allowed to visit James in the Castle. They explain to the lawyer that James Stewart is innocent of the killing although they do not know who killed the Captain. It is pointed out, however, that Dave is risking his life by giving evidence to the fact. They are visited by the Lord Advocate and his daughter who explain to them that a New Scotland is in the making as part of the Union with England, so therefore rebellions by the Highland Clans in the future are not necessary. The Lord Advocate tells them both that he is a highlander too but would wish Alan Breck to be captured and killed. Unbeknownst to the Lord Advocate, Breck, hiding in a large cupboard, was listening in to their conversation in anger and still wished to carry out a future rebellion. Finally Catriona meets Alan out in the Scottish countryside and pleads with him to reconsider rebelling against England, as Scotland is no longer interested in fighting. Alan Breck is then left to himself, viewing the countryside and has memories of the people being killed in the futile Battle of Culloden. He feels guilty for the young men he sent out to their deaths. He finally realizes that a New Scotland does not need him. It turns out that it was he that killed the Captain.

She is distraught at his crash, which stirs up emotions from Piero's passing she had been seeking to put in the past.  Delaney consoles her and rescues her from a horde of reporters. After he puts her in a waiting car, a journalist asks Delaney whether his and Aurac's accident can be compared to the one with Belgetti in the previous year's race. Delaney merely stares him down.\nPorsche driver Johann Ritter senses that his wife, Anna, would like for him to quit racing. He suggests it, thinking she will be overjoyed. She demurs and says she would like it only if he likes it. He chides her a bit about not being entirely honest. Later the decision is taken out of his hands when team manager David Townsend replaces him for not being quick enough on the track. Anna tries to comfort him, reminding him that he was planning to quit anyway.\nLisa goes to Delaney's trailer to talk with him. After his brush with death she is even more drawn to him and despairs that he may meet the same fate as her husband, but Delaney finds the thrill too addictive to quit. Townsend enters and asks him to take over driving Ritter's car. After a moment's unspoken communion with Lisa, he follows Townsend who tells him \"Michael, I want you to drive flat out. I want Porsche to win Le Mans.\"\nIn the closing minutes of the race the two Porsches and their rival Ferraris vie for the win, with Delaney in the #21 car and teammate Larry Wilson in #22. The Ferrari leading the race retires due to a flat tire, leaving Wilson in the lead and only Delaney's archrival, Stahler, to contend with. The faster pair quickly catches Wilson. Delaney passes Stahler for second place.\nSlower traffic in his lane forces Delaney to brake, allowing Stahler to overtake on the left. Delaney drafts the German, then both move alongside Wilson. Delaney then takes actions that seem intended to guarantee a 1\u20132 Porsche win rather than going for first himself. Rather than try to pass Wilson, then possibly Stahler, Delaney switches to the right lane and drafts Wilson allowing both to pull up with Stahler. Then for good measure he bumps Stahler twice. When Stahler tries to pass again Delaney steers toward him, looking likely to bump Stahler again and send him into the guard rail, forcing him to throttle back and brake to avoid that outcome thus ensuring the desired 1\u20132 win for Porsche.", "tmdb_id": 5920}, "27669486": {"title": "The Legend of Frenchie King", "plot": "In Bougival Junction, Texas in 1888 the Francophone town is led by Marie Sarrazin.

When Emily offers to move on, Jessica invites her to dine with them and stay the night.\nThe following day, Jessica, seeing how attracted Woody is to Emily, asks Duncan to invite her to stay indefinitely. Jessica begins hearing voices and sees a mysterious young blonde woman (Gretchen Corbett) looking at her from a distance before disappearing.

Jessica finds the story fascinating, but Duncan, afraid that hearing about such things will upset his wife, cuts Dorker short. Later, as Jessica prepares to make a headstone rubbing on Abigail Bishop's grave, she notices the blonde woman beckoning her to follow.

Her husband Frank (Jean Sorel) is a lawyer working for Brighton's practice. They all live together in a large apartment with Joan (Ely Galleani), Frank's teenage daughter from a previous marriage. Carol has been visiting a psychoanalyst because of a string of disturbing dreams she's been having featuring her decadent neighbor, Julia Durer (Anita Strindberg). Julia's frequent, late-night parties infuriate and yet excite Carol, evoking images of wild sex-and-drug orgies.\nDuring a meeting between Edmund and Frank, they talk about their recent court cases in which Edmund asks Frank if he has been unfaithful to Carol, which Frank denies. Then a phone call is made by an anonymous woman who claims to Edmund that she has damaging information about his family. But unknown to everyone, Frank is indeed having an affair with his personal secretary Deborah (Silvia Monti) whom he meets after work at her country house for some romantic tryst.\nCarol's dreams continue which become more complicated during scenes that appear to be dreams or hallucinations. Describing her latest one to her psychoanalyst, they depict a lesbian encounter between the two women, culminating in Carol grisly stabbing the seductive Julia to death. In an enigmatic coda to the dream sequence, Carol sees two kaftan-clad hippies who have apparently witnessed the whole thing without intervening.\nThe following day, it's revealed that Julia Durer has indeed been murdered. Inspector Corvin (Stanley Baker) from Scotland Yard arrives to take charge of the investigation. The room and condition of the dead body are identical to their depiction in the dream sequence. To make matters even more incriminating, there is a discarded fur coat near the body. Learning of the murder, Carol insists that she see the scene of the crime and when she enters Julia's apartment and sees the body, she faints.\nAfter weeding out a false and self-serving confession from a delirious regular at the Durer parties, Corvin focuses on Carol Hammond. Meanwhile, Carol, during a shopping excursion with her step-daughter Joan, see the two hippies from her dream sequence. Following them to an abandoned theater where other hippies hang out, Joan asks them if they know Carol or have ever seen her before. The hippy man and woman claim they had not. As the evidence against Carol mounts, the police surreptitiously obtain her fingerprints, which match those found on the murder weapon, and Carol is soon arrested and charged with murdering Julia. However, Corvin begins to wonder if she is the killer, as she had described the murder to her psychoanalyst in detail before it actually took place. Could it be that someone has read her dream diary that she kept and modeled the killing on dream images she described in order to frame her for something she fantasized about? Corvin also wonders who the two hippies are that she claims to have witnessed her crime without intervening.\nAs Carol is awaiting trial in the grounds of a maximum security sanitorium, she sees one of the hippies break in and chase her through the grounds. Carol flees into the building and in trying to hide she enters a room containing a hideous experiment: four live dogs, clamped in an upright position, whimper helplessly, their abdomens sliced open and pinned with surgical clamps exposing their glistening innards and still beating hearts. Carol faints in horror. When she comes around, there is no trace of the threatening man. The sanitorium director thinks that Carol's ramblings about the intruder, and the disemboweled dogs, must have been another one of her elaborate hallucinations.\nMeanwhile, Carol's father swings into overdrive with her case and manages to elaborate a suspicion that appeals to the police. Edmund Brighton discovers Frank's affair with Deborah and that Julia Durer had been blackmailing him for money as not to expose his extramarital affair. Brighton's argument is enough to get Carol released on bail, but Frank remains free and desperately tries to prove his innocence.\nWhile relaxing at Brighton's country estate, Carol is contacted by the hippy woman and agrees to meet with them at a secret rendezvous, at the Alexandra Palace in North London. Once there, Carol is attacked by the hippy man in the cellar and chased through the building where she gets attacked by bats in the attic and gets brutally stabbed as the hippy catches up to her on the rooftop. But Carol is rescued by the police, forcing the hippy man to flee. Another red herring emerges when Joan meets with the hippy woman concerning her stepmother's wellbeing and agreeing to meet. The next day, Joan is found murdered in a field with her throat cut. Inspector Corvin meets with Carol recovering at her father's estate to ask about the hippie couple and of the blackmail that Julia Durer may have been planning for Frank. Corvin finally tracks down and arrests the hippie couple, Hubert and Jenny, whom he takes to the scene of the crime to interrogate them about the Durer murder. Although Hubert admits to have stalked Carol and murdered Joan, they protest their innocence claiming not to remember anything about that night except for recalling \"a lizard in a woman's skin\". Then a phone call comes informing the police that Brighton has been found dead at his estate, the victim of a suicide, and leaving behind a note confessing to the murder of Julia Durer which seems to wrap up the case.\nA few days later, Carol is at her father's grave when Corvin arrives to offer his condolences to her. When Corvin asks Carol about the phone call that her father got from Julia Durer which Carol admits that she knew about, he asks how did she know that Julia Durer phoned Mr. Brighton on the day before she was murdered since he never told anybody about it. Too late to realize her slip, Corvin deduces Carol's guilt as she was with Julia Durer during that day the phone call was made. As it turns out, Carol Hammond really did kill Julia Durer after she threatened to go public with their lesbian relationship which they've been having for several months. Carol did break into Julia's apartment and stabbed her to death, only to realize that two hippies saw her, which made her panic and leave the scene of the crime. Carol had felt certain that the two hippies would describe her to the police. The murderous, but sane, Carol entered the event in her dream diary immediately afterwards so by combining details of the murder with images from the recurring nightmares for which she had sought treatment, she hoped to avoid a murder sentence and get off with guilt by temporary insanity that the dream diary would provide plausible evidence in court of a split personality. But Carol did not realize that both hippies were high on LSD and unable to register the significance of what they saw that night.

At their camp, nobles arrive and inform Macbeth he has been named the Thane of Cawdor, with Macbeth simultaneously awed and frightened at the prospect of usurping Duncan, in further fulfilment of the prophecy. He writes a letter to Lady Macbeth, who is delighted at the news. However, she fears her husband has too much good nature, and vows to be cruel for him.

We learn about Panda's past, in which her mother repeatedly assures her that she will be famous while her father repeatedly abandons them for affair after affair. To escape her unhappy home life, young Panda immerses herself in Hollywood movies, often imitating movie stars such as Rita Hayworth. By the time she is nineteen, Panda tries to attract her father's attention by displeasing him, and to that end moves in with a married, Chinese boyfriend. When her father learns of this, he dies of a heart attack, and at the funeral, his many lovers hysterically blame Panda for his demise. Her next boyfriend ends up leaving her for another man.

After his mother convinces him that love requires purity, and lust must be violently purged, Gig begins to treat women cruelly and eventually tries to join the seminary, but is soon caught in a tryst with a maid. Gig briefly joins the military, where he embraces an enemy soldier in joy upon learning that the man is not dead.

There, he enjoys the food but then readies to leave, promising to return later to have sex after the party he's going to.

After she collapses on her bed, he returns silently and asks what they should do next.\nGig reluctantly agrees to Panda's suggestion that they move in together, hoping to break his pattern of abusiveness. Gig finds he is able to really open up to Panda and he playfully helps Panda to overcome her inability to achieve orgasm. On New Year's Eve, Panda's mother appears, reminding Panda that she is late for her night club comeback. Ignoring her mother's disapproval of Gig, Panda rushes to prepare for her act and insists that Gig join them. He is appalled, however, by her act, a painfully amateurish song-and-dance number in which she asks the audience to create a new identity for her.

However, Panda tells him that some of their comments about her (particularly her physical features) were accurate. This causes Gig to fly into a rage, because she's agreeing with his parents after all the nasty things they said, so he begins to berate her as well, eventually breaking up with her and forcing her to get out of the car.

As in neighbouring England, the Protestant faith has been embraced by many nobles of Scotland; in addition, the Catholic Mary has to deal with her half-brother James Stewart, Lord Moray's (Patrick McGoohan) ambitions for rule. He suggests that Mary enjoy herself in Scotland, and pass the time with dancing and feasting. Moray wants to rule Scotland while the lovely but inexperienced Mary becomes a figurehead.\nFearing that Mary has ambitions for England's throne, Elizabeth I of England (Glenda Jackson) decides to weaken her claim by sending her favourite, the ambitious Robert Dudley (Daniel Massey), to woo and marry Mary. She promises that Mary will become her heir if she agrees to the marriage. Sly Elizabeth also sends the younger, dashing but weak and spoiled Lord Darnley (Timothy Dalton) from a powerful Catholic family. Tempted by the handsome Darnley, Mary impulsively chooses him for marriage. Lord Moray, a Protestant, opposes the marriage, but Mary ignores him. She exiles Moray to strengthen her own authority. Elizabeth is satisfied that reckless, passionate Mary's romantic misadventures will keep her busy in Scotland and give shrewd, practical Elizabeth less to worry about.\nSoon after the wedding, Darnley throws a childish temper tantrum, complaining that he has no real power and is merely Mary's king consort. A disillusioned Mary soon banishes Darnley from her bed and frequently consults with the gentle, soft-spoken Italian courtier David Riccio (Ian Holm).

Mary gives birth to a son, James, who is expected to succeed both Mary and the unmarried, childless Elizabeth.\nThe peace is short-lived. The weak, selfish Darnley still wants power, though by now he is hideously scarred and already dying of syphilis (the pox). Mary pities him, but finds herself falling in love with the rough but loyal Bothwell. With Moray's help, they arrange for Darnley to be killed in a gunpowder explosion at his manor; Darnley escapes before the blast but is strangled. Bothwell marries Mary, and their few brief nights together are blissful. But Moray rejoins the Scottish lords and leads a rebellion against them. He forces Mary to abdicate, and she and her husband are driven into exile, Mary to England and Bothwell to Denmark. Mary's young son James is to be crowned king of Scotland (although Moray will effectively rule) and raised as a Protestant.\nIn England, Mary begs Elizabeth for money and an army to regain her throne. Instead Elizabeth takes her prisoner, keeping her locked away in luxurious captivity in a remote castle. Elizabeth's closest advisor, Sir William Cecil (Trevor Howard), is anxious to get rid of Mary, but Elizabeth fears to set a precedent by putting an anointed monarch to death. She also fears that Mary's death might spark a rebellion by her Catholic subjects and cause problems with powerful France and Spain. As a result, Mary is doomed to an open-ended captivity.

He is berated by his mother (\"The good die young, and people like you come back\", she says after hearing about the death of the young friend Hans had taken to the army with him).\nHans works as a fruit peddler, calling out his products and diligently making his rounds through the residential streets. Short and stocky, he is married to the slim and taller Irmgard, who helps him with his work. They have a small daughter, Renate. One day Hans sells fruit to an attractive married woman in an apartment building. She asks him to deliver the pears in person and invites him in, but he refuses, saying \"some other time.\" The woman is the great love of Hans's life since his youth. When the suspicious Irmgard questions why it took so long, he escapes her incessant complaints by abandoning his cart and going into a nearby bar. Soon, the sad ritual of his empty existence emerges: arguing with his wife, drinking excessively, lamenting lost personal and professional opportunities. While in the bar, Hans gets sentimental about his golden days as a policeman. In a flashback, he recalls how one day he brought a prostitute to the police station to take a statement, but she lured him into having oral sex. Caught by his superior, this incident got him fired.\nIrmgard appears at the bar to fetch him, but a drunk Hans says he will come home when he wants to. When his wife does not leave fast enough, he throws a chair at her. Finally Hans comes home intoxicated. Irmgard calls him a pig and he beats her up in front of their little daughter. The next morning, Irmgard has disappeared and Hans is desperate.\nIrmgard, fleeing with Renate, finds support with Hans' family. His contemptuous bourgeois mother has always disdained Hans, as she favors her obedient married daughter Heidi and tolerates her outspoken college student daughter Anna. When Hans once dreamed of being a mechanic, his mother demanded that he keep on studying and forbid him from taking a job that would get his hands dirty. Irmgard complains to her in-laws that Hans attacked her the night before. Heidi and her husband agree with the mother that Hans has always been good for nothing. Anna is the lone relative sympathetic to him, saying his family has always despised him and never gave him a proper chance. When Hans arrives, he tries to reconcile with his wife, but Irmgard retreats to a corner of the living room screaming in terror while the brother-in-law stands in front of her. The two men struggle while Irmgard phones a lawyer, saying she wants a divorce. When she puts down the receiver, Hans begins to sing his favorite tune: \"Buona, buona notte, you can't have everything you want.\" Then he has a heart attack.\nWhile Hans is recuperating in a hospital bed, his wife lets herself be picked up by a man in the street and takes him home to bed. But her little daughter catches them having sex, after which Irmgard sobs incessantly. At the hospital, Hans and his wife reconcile; she promises to stay with him. Once he is back home and as they are about to have sex, Irmgard explains that sometimes she finds him funny because he is much shorter than she is and that she only grew interested in him in the first place because he was so comical.\nAfter his heart attack, Hans can neither work nor drink, so Irmgard takes a larger role in the business. No longer able to push the cart around, Hans hires a hard-working and honest assistant, Anzell. He is the same man with whom, unknown to Hans, Irmgard had the brief affair during his hospitalization. Fearing exposure of her indiscretion, she manipulates Anzell into overpricing the produce and afterwards sharing the extra earnings with her. He agrees, but Irmgard knows he will be found out because her husband spies on Anzell when he goes through the courtyards. It happens as planned and Anzell is fired in disgrace, but Hans knows of Irmgard's infidelity.\nWhile dining with a friend, Hans is reunited with Harry, a close friend from his years in the Foreign Legion who now waits tables, and immediately offers him a job.

Though Harry's professionalism and dedication bring Hans' business profitability and success, they also render Hans obsolete in his own life, leading him further into isolation and despair.\nIn his depression, Hans revisits the great love of his life. In his youth, he courted her with an armful of red roses, but she turned him down because her parents did not want her to marry a fruit peddler. Though married to someone else, she undresses for casual sex, but he leaves. When Hans visits Anna, his favorite sister, she is busy with her studies and has no time for him.\nThe doctor says large quantities of alcohol would be fatal for Hans because of his bad heart, and in the end, Hans deliberately goes to his regular bar.

The two fly to London where Nicole goes on a shopping spree and is taken by Matthews to his countryside getaway in a remote part of the country. The locals are shown to be quite unfriendly and conservative and the wily Dr. Matthews attempts to pass off his new lover as his wife. He explains that all his money comes from his real wife Vanessa. Despite her feelings for Matthews, Nicole quickly becomes unnerved by the new location including Dr. Matthews handyman, a sinister local named Hallory (Luciano Rossi), who has a false hand. Its revealed someone is spying on Dr. Matthews house from nearby and specifically targeting Nicole. Dr. Matthews has to leave for work but upon his return he takes Nicole to a nearby tavern where they meet Captain Lenny (George Riguad) about a new boat. Nicole overhears the local clergyman talking on the phone with a voice changer and is frightened and demands to be taken home. Matthews drops Nicole off but tells her he has to leave again for London. That night the person with the telescope continues to spy on Nicole and a woman in black is seen entering the house and offering large amounts of money to Nicole. \nThe next day Matthews returns but finds Nicole missing. Hallory claims to have never seen Nicole leave and Captain Lenny tells Dr. Matthews the whole village believes Nicole ran away with another man. Dr. Matthews travels to London to perform an eye surgery on an elderly man named Smith who is blind. Following the operation, a mysterious woman appears in the dark and shoots Matthews in his shoulder, wounding him nonfatally. The police immediately launch an investigation and the hardnosed Inspector Baxter focuses on the small details including the drugged Dr. Matthews asking for \"Nicole\" post-surgery even though his wife is named Vanessa. Both Vanessa and Smith deny knowing anyone named Nicole. Upon the police traveling to the fishing village, its shown that Nicole's body has been fished out of the water by local fisherman Phillips. A drunken Michel appears and is questioned by the suspicious police who think he had something to do with his girlfriends death. Inspector Baxter takes Michel's passport but lets him go. Michel sees Captain Lenny hanging around nearby and questions him about what happened. In London, Baxter questions Dr. Matthews who firmly denies it was Nicole who shot at him. Michel shows up at Vanessa Matthews house and threatens her with violence unless she tells him why she was seen in the village the night Nicole died. \nBaxter hauls Michel in for questioning and he admits that Captain Lenny told him he saw a mysterious woman in the village. The Inspector takes Michel and Vanessa to sit-down with Captain Lenny who is unsure if Vanessa was the woman after all. Following this they go to Dr. Matthews cottage where the gate is easily opened by Vanessa, revealing she has been there before. Forced to confess. Mrs. Matthews tells Baxter that she paid off Nicole to leave Dr. Matthews and return to Paris. Later that night after Matthews has gone to bed, the same masked man who threatened Nicole shows up and sneaks into the house and brutally murders Vanessa. The police show up and are forced to sedate the distraught Dr. Matthews. Inspector Baxter visits the coroner\u2019s office and after realizing that bodies kept on ice can alter the time of death becomes convinced that bricks of ice were used on Nicole\u2019s body. This theory is confirmed by a visit to the other side of the cottage where a rope and anchor with room for a body and ice bricks is found in the water. Inspector Baxter and Bergson are leaving when they hear a shot from nearby. It came from the home of Captain Lenny, who had pulled a gun on Michel. The police arrive while Michel escapes using the Inspector\u2019s car. Baxter questions Captain Lenny after seeing large amounts of money, it transpires that the captain was the one spying nightly on Nicole. He admits he saw a man but due to the rain he could not see his face. The money given to Nicole by Vanessa was stolen by the greedy Captain. Baxter arrests Captain Lenny and returns to London. \nMichel soon phones the police and tells them to focus on the blind man Smith. Smith is hauled in for questioning and it all comes out that he was blinded in the diamond heist when Ernest Rochard accidentally turned the blowtorch towards his face. Smith reveals the final piece of information needed to solve the mystery: He and Rochard both agreed Nicole would keep the diamonds. Baxter, Bergson, Dr. Matthews, and Smith travel back to the cottage where a fight has broken out between the transvestite Hallory, dressed in the clothes of Nicole, and a furious Michel. Just as Hallory is about to kill Michel, the others arrive. Bergson discovers the blue contact lenses on Michel, seemingly confirming that he was the mysterious masked villain. Michel attempts to escape but gets knocked out with a judo chop from Inspector Baxter. Smith discovers the diamonds where they were hidden. \nThe case is seemingly closed as the men go to leave when the fisherman Phillips appears and mentions that he gave a bunch of ice to Dr. Matthews. Realizing the truth, the police confront Dr. Matthews. It turns out that Matthews and Rochard were partners and that Robert planned the heist and then double-crossed Rochard for the diamonds. Vanessa had told this to Nicole when she had visited her at the cottage, thus leading to Dr. Matthews having to eliminate both Nicole and his wife (who was the one who shot at him). It also is revealed that the blue contact lenses were planted in Michel\u2019s apartment by Dr. Matthews as part of a frame-up. The movie ends with Inspector Baxter and Bergson seeing Michel off at the airport.", "tmdb_id": 77029}, "25277019": {"title": "Mosagallaku Mosagadu (1971 film)", "plot": "Amaraveedu dynasty was attacked by Britishers at the time of the Bobbili war in South India.

It would also reduce their pay and prevent Jack from conducting amorous flings with women on the company's time.

When he learns of this, Azzarini is outraged: he severs ties with Tersilli and hires Cremona as his own assistant.\nAfter attending a party at Tersilli's house, where they realized the extent of his wealth, the clinic staff march into Tersilli's office and demand better working conditions, pay raises and actual employment contracts. When Tersilli refuses, the staff resign and most patients consequently walk out of the clinic. Faced with having to operate on a renal colic to one of the last remaining patients, Tersilli, who lacks any surgical skills, begs his wife to intercede with Azzarini, since he has been suspecting an affair between them. Tersilli's former team, led by Azzarini, arrive at the last minute and save the day, but charge a hefty fee and leave immediately afterwards.\nAlone and on the brink of closure, Tersilli is convinced by his mother that real profit comes from \"healing the healthy\".

If he fails, both Kuroda and the ambassador will have to commit harakiri for losing their honor by allowing the tachi to be stolen and leaving the dead samurai unavenged. Link reluctantly agrees, but he realizes that Kuroda will kill Gauche immediately, which Link does not want; he knows Gauche will hide the stolen money somewhere. Once they set off in pursuit of the gang, Link repeatedly attempts to elude Kuroda, only to be thwarted by the irrepressible samurai.\nGauche and four gang members soon bury the money, and then Gauche kills them so only he knows the hiding place. Gauche pays off others, who go their own way, and the remaining gang stay with him. While tracking Gauche's gang, Kuroda reveals that the links to his Samurai values are disappearing and that his countrymen no longer seem to value their ancient culture. Convinced that Japan is changing forever and that its samurai spirit will soon be gone, Kuroda explains that the only way to honor his ancestors and his own way of life is to bring back the tachi sword. The two approach a ranch that has been taken over by some of the gang members; they attack, kill, and steal the gang's horses. Link, now armed with pistols and rifles taken from the gang, can no longer be threatened into doing Kuroda's bidding. He rides away from Kuroda, but has a change of heart and returns, having grown to respect the strict bushido code by which Kuroda lives. He warns Kuroda, however, that he will kill him if he tries to kill Gauche before Link learns where the money is hidden.\nContinuing the pursuit, Link decides the best way to get to Gauche is through his lover, Cristina. The duo travel to a familiar brothel in the town of San Lucas where she has a room; after he arrives, Link seals her inside the room so she can't escape. The next morning, four of Gauche's men arrive to fetch Christina. Link and Kuroda kill three of them, and the fourth is sent back to Gauche with the message: the duo has abducted Cristina and will give her to Gauche in exchange for the stolen sword and Link's share of the train robbery spoils. The exchange is to take place at an abandoned mission a day's ride away.\nLink and Kuroda, on the way to the exchange, have a nonviolent confrontation that compels Kuroda to agree to not kill Gauche until Link has obtained the needed information. In trying to escape from the duo, Christina rides into the path of a band of Comanche warriors, stabbing and killing the one who assaults her. In retribution, the leader has her bound and her neck tied with wet rawhide, which will slowly strangle her to death as the sun dries out the rawhide strip. Link and Kuroda attack the Comanches, killing many and driving the rest away.\nArriving at the mission, Link and Kuroda are ambushed by Gauche and his men. Gauche, who has the tachi sword with him, tells one of his men to shoot Link, disregarding Cristina's appeal not to do so. Just then, Comanches attack, which forces the ex-partners, Kuroda, Cristina, and Gauche's men to fight on the same side. They successfully repel the attacks, first from inside the mission, then, after it is burned down, in the surrounding cane fields. When the last attack ends and the Comanches are dead or have fled, only Link, Kuroda, Cristina, and Gauche are still alive.\nGauche immediately faces off against Link, who has run out of bullets. Kuroda closes in behind Gauche and prepares to kill him, but hesitates because his oath to Link. Gauche turns and shoots Kuroda, mortally wounding him; Link seizes the opportunity to grab a rifle. Gauche is confident that Link will leave him alive to learn where the money is hidden. Link, however, having decided that the dying samurai's honor is more important than the money, kills him, and promises the dying Kuroda that he will return the tachi to the ambassador. After Kuroda dies and is buried, Link rejects Cristina's offer to join her to track down the money.

One of the orphans, Tommy, wanders into the nearby cemetery where he faintly hears a voice ordering, \"Rise, rise, it is time.\" Tommy dismisses it, but vampire women rise from their graves. Tommy tries to escape the cemetery but runs into the waiting Count Yorga.\nYorga goes to the orphanage during the costume party. He bites one of the pretty guests, Mitzi, outside the event room before going inside and introducing himself to those present. He becomes infatuated with Cynthia. When a weakened Mitzi stumbles into the room, Yorga leaves as the others attend to her. That night, he returns to his manor and a makeshift throne room overlooking several coffins, greeted by Brudda, Yorga's hulking, disfigured valet, and the female vampires from the cemetery. Yorga sends the undead women to Cynthia's house, using mind-control to get Cynthia's family (along with Tommy, who was sleeping over) into the living room before his brides break in and attack them. The family is quickly overrun. Cynthia's mother, father and sister, Ellen, are fed upon by the undead horde. Tommy is untouched, revealing he is under Yorga's power. Cynthia herself is subdued, but unharmed and carried by the brides to Yorga's residence where she awakens. Due to Yorga's hypnotic suggestions, she has no memory of the attack. Yorga tells Cynthia that there was a car accident and she was left in his care by her family.  He tries to charm the young woman into willingly becoming his bride, though he is warned by his live-in witch that Cynthia will bring his end if he does not kill her or turn her into a vampire soon.\nThe next morning, Jennifer, the Nelsons' mute maid, finds the massacre scene along with Tommy and calls the police. However, as she does, Bruhda silently arrives drags away the corpses of Cynthia's mother and father to a quicksand pit on Yorga's property, disposing of the physical evidence. By the time the police arrive, all of the evidence has been cleared away. Tommy claims that nothing has happened. Despite the confusion, David Baldwin, Cynthia's fianc\u00e9, is suspicious about the Nelsons' disappearance. Meanwhile, memories of the attack on her family slowly start to resurface in Cynthia's mind as she stays within Yorga's manor. Jennifer, suspicious about Tommy's involvement with the Nelsons' disappearance and his visits to Yorga's mansion, loses her patience and slaps Tommy who stares at her in a vengeful manner. Meanwhile, Yorga goes to claim Mitzi, killing her boyfriend near their boat house before feeding on her once more, draining her completely and adding her to his vampiric harem.\nHours later, Ellen's fianc\u00e9 Jason is lured to Yorga's mansion by Tommy, on the claim that he found Ellen. Once at the mansion, Tommy disappears, while Jason is reunited with Ellen who has clearly been made into a vampire by Yorga. As she mocks him for \"not loving her anymore\" and soon starts laughing cruelly at him when he sense something wrong, her fellow brides attack Jason from behind. Jason breaks free, only to run into Count Yorga, who chases Jason down a hall and strangles him. Bruddah tosses Jason's body into the throne/coffin room for the brides, including Ellen and newly vampiric Mitzi, to feed upon.\nThat evening, Reverend Thomas phones Jennifer, but it is revealed she lies dead on her bed with a large knife sticking out of her chest. From her window, Tommy can be seen walking away from the house. After Thomas learns of Jennifer's death, David is sure he is correct about the Count's true nature and manages to convince Reverend Thomas and investigating police detectives Lt. Madden and Sgt. O'Connor to join him in a rescue-mission at Yorga's mansion. Reverend Thomas is sent to distract Yorga while Baldwin, Madden and O'Connor sneak in to search the manor, armed with sticks they can cross and hold up to ward off the vampires.  Meanwhile, the pastor falls for Yorga's charms and reveals the others' suspicions that he is a vampire, alerting Yorga of danger.  Thomas is tricked into walking into the quicksand pit and promptly sinks to his death. Yorga returns to the manor, awakens his brides and unleashes them through the household as he psychically calls Cynthia to him.\nBaldwin splits from the detectives to expand the room-by-room search, and upon opening one door discovers Jason's corpse, covered in bloody bite marks with an IV draining remaining blood from his neck into a glass-bottle on the floor beneath him. Later, Baldwin finally finds the half-mind-controlled Cynthia and attempts to escape; however, he is nearly beaten by Brudda. Falling into a suit of armor,  Baldwin grabs a metal mace and knocks Brudda out with a violent blow to the face.\nMeanwhile, Madden and O'Connor come across Yorga's vampire brides. When the women don't respond to their question and continue tho silently advance on them. the detectives attempt to shoot them point blank, but their bullets prove ineffective as the undead women continue to give chase. In the midst of their escape, they encounter Brudda and managed to shoot him to death. Eventually O'Connor is separated in the brides' throne/coffin room by a shutter and immediately attacked from behind and bitten by the witch (also a vampire) as Madden helplessly listens to O'Connor's death-screams. Madden tries to find a way to him, but he gets lured in by a voice from the shadows (thinking it is Baldwin) and then killed by Tommy who stabs him in the same way he murdered Jennifer.\nBaldwin and Cynthia are the only ones left alive, with Yorga supernaturally mocking Baldwin throughout the estate. Yorga seals their exit routes while his brides slowly close in on the two. They duck into a darkened hallway, but when Baldwin turns on the lights, he finds himself confronted by all the brides (including Ellen and Mitzi) with Yorga behind them who calls Cynthia over to his side. Yorga takes her away, preparing to turn her into his new bride while leaving his army of brides to finish off Baldwin. He is about to take her when he hears Baldwin scream his name, who seemingly has escaped the brides. Yorga takes Cynthia and flees to the upper balcony of the estate as Baldwin (who grabs an iron battle-axe from a wall) chases the two. Yorga and Baldwin fight with Baldwin surprisingly seeming stronger than before, however, Yorga gains the advantage. Just as he is about to kill Baldwin via choking, Cynthia's memories of the brides killing her family resurface, causing her to realize Yorga was responsible for their deaths. She strikes Yorga in the chest with Baldwin's battle-axe. With Yorga stunned by the action, Baldwin uses the moment to throw Yorga off the balcony, and he lay motionless on the pavement below, dead.\nCynthia hugs Baldwin, believing the ordeal over. However, she notices something wrong and pulls away. To her horror, she sees that Baldwin's skin has turned pale and bite marks are on his face, revealing that he has transformed into a vampire (having apparently not escaped from the brides unscathed). Cynthia tries to run from him, but Baldwin pulls her back and promptly bites her.\nThe last shot of the movie is Tommy playing with his ball in front of the orphanage accompanied by a haunting rendition of the song the children sang at the beginning of the film. Though Yorga is dead, his evil lives on as those who know of him are either dead or turned into vampires and will carry out his curse. The film ends with the ominous implication that Cynthia has joined them, Baldwin now their new leader and the surviving vampires are resting within the manor, where they will proceed to spread the vampirisim to the unwitting orphanage and soon to the rest of the town.", "tmdb_id": 28855}, "11467786": {"title": "Return of Sabata", "plot": "Sabata, a former Confederate army officer and steely eyed, quick-drawing, impossibly accurate gunman with a trick gun, is working for a travelling circus as a stunt marksman.

The trial soon creates a heated debate about the issue of pornography vs. free speech. The young defense lawyer, Mike Barrett (Wayne Maunder), must also solve the mystery of the novel's true author.\nIn examining the history of the book, the defense attorney discovered it was written by J.J. Jadway, an American expatriate living in Europe.  The book was originally published in English by a publisher in France, and eventually picked up by various tawdry publishing companies in the United States, most of whom tried to emphasize the more lurid and salacious aspects of the book. Its content was considered so sexually explicit that it was banned as obscene in over 30 countries. Apparently. J.J. Jadway was so despondent over the treatment of his book that he committed suicide; one of his friends found him and reported it.\nAs the trial takes place, the prosecutor finds ordinary members of the public who find the book grossly offensive (one of whom admits on cross-examination by the defense that she cannot even repeat out loud one of the words used in the book to describe what the female protagonist was doing in bed with her lover), and the defense finds professionals in academia and the media who attest to the book's value as literature. The prosecution then puts the young man who committed the rape on the stand to say the book drove him to it.\nThe attorney defending the book is contacted by Constance Cumberland (Yvonne De Carlo), a member of a local decency society who decides to testify in court about the young man who committed the rape and other things surrounding the book. She had spoken with the young man, and his motivation for the rape was not the book, but his own fears over his sexuality.\nConstance also admits that she knew J.J. Jadway, the book's author, that he did not die of a heart attack in Europe in the 1950s as was reported, and that she knew that the book's content was not intended to be pornographic but rather an examination of a woman's sexuality.\nWhen she is asked how she could know this, Constance responds with a bombshell, \"Because I am J.J. Jadway, and I wrote The Seven Minutes.\" She had asked a friend to publicize the fake suicide of J.J. Jadway in order to discourage investigation into the book's author because, more than 20 years ago, it would have been bad for her if it were discovered she was the author, but she should not hide any longer. She proceeds to explain that the man with whom the female protagonist of the novel was having sex, as the book showed, had had problems with impotence, and had become able to experience intercourse because of her. Her feeling of what this man reawakened in her, having not taken a lover for many years, makes her realize she wants to be with him \u2013 all of this occurring inside her head during her experience of the seven minutes of intercourse.\nThe jury finds the book not obscene.

The attorney who won the case chastises him, pointing out that it is ridiculous to try to restrict what adults choose to read in their homes when no harm has been shown (as it was in this case, since the book was simply a scapegoat used to explain away the case of alleged rape by the young man.)\nA note at the end of the movie states that for a woman during a session of lovemaking, the average length of time from initial arousal to orgasm is about seven minutes.", "tmdb_id": 5745}, "47550910": {"title": "Seven Murders for Scotland Yard", "plot": "Paul Naschy plays Bruno Doriani, an ex-acrobat living in London who limps badly as a result of an accident he suffered years before on the trapeze.

Rodrigo rejects all these claims and censures him by saying that this wouldn't be the attitude of St. Francis Xavier.\nThe interpreter takes Rodrigo back to his prison, and he is hung upside down in a pit with a small incision at the back of his ear for the blood to drip slowly. After a short time in a lot of pain, he is taken back to the prison, where he meets Sawano again. When Rodrigo asks about the snoring sound he hears, Sawano says it's not snoring but the whimpering of three Christian believers who have been hung upside down for the past six hours. Sawano says he was in the same cell where Rodrigo is now and was hung for two days and there were five men who were hung in the pit, and he can still hear their voices. Sawano tells the real reason he renounced his faith was not because of the torture, but the absence of God in others' suffering. Rodrigo replies those who are in suffering will receive eternal happiness for their pain. Sawano tells him not to deceive himself, and says if Rodrigo renounces his faith now for the sake of love as Christ would do, those men hung in the pits will be freed and receive immediate care.\nThe interpreter comes with a fumi-e and encourages Rodrigo to step on it, as it's a mere formality. Sawano supports him by relating it to be a supreme act of love that Christ would have done for his fellow men and chants silently. Rodrigo steps on the fumi-e and a rooster crows twice (reminiscent of Saint Peter's denial). Later, a complacent Rodrigo is shown helping Nagasaki magistrates to identify forbidden Christian objects. Rodrigo is asked to comment on a cup and he says it's not a chalice because the stem would have been longer. The magistrates are impressed with it and give him Kiku as his wife; from that day forward, he is given her dead husband's name Sanemon Okada as Ferreira was given the title of Lord Sawano.

Mr. Hume talks with the clinic director Dr. Francis Clay and his associate, Dr. Austin, about the possibility of Cheryl being cured. Dr. Clay tells Mr. Hume that Cheryl's suicidal urges may relapse once she is released, but Hume thinks that his wife only needs some more rest at the clinic.\nMeanwhile, Helen is a nurse who is tending to resident Mara, who tells Nurse Helen that she seems to be improving with her treatment. Another patient is Anne, who is a diagnosed nymphomaniac. Anne attempts to follow the gardener to seduce him, but she is called back to her room by Dr. Austin, who counsels her about her \"impulsive\" and \"excessive\" sexual desires. Anne is visited by her brother, Peter, and wants them to return to the 'affectionate' ways they together had as children, and clearly has sexual feelings for him. Peter says they must resist this now they are adults.\nLater that evening, as the attendants and patents sit in a room to mingle and play cards and board games, Anne sneaks out the front door and runs to the greenhouse.

A chauffeur enters the building and drinks all of the drinks left over from the get-together.

Dr. Clay and Cheryl talk of their potential relationship, and he leaves to \"do the rounds.\"\nWhile Nurse Helen enters Mara's room and clearly attempts to seduce her while Mara is taking a bath, the killer walks into Anne's room while she sleeps, shuts her window, and takes off his hood.

The historical background is the period of the decay of the Greek Polis and of the democracy of Athens: the opening scene shows the demolition of the city walls by the Spartans, now victors of the Peloponnesian War, with the subsequent establishment of the Government of the Thirty Tyrants (404 BC).\nThe city is in turmoil for the defeat and humiliation suffered, as well as for the organization of military counter-moves for the liberation (which will lead to the fall of the Thirty the year following the establishment of the Regime). In this context it is introduced the character of Socrates, now seventy years old and engaged every day in his philosophical research with a large following of young people.\nDuring the film many excerpts from some of Plato's famous Dialogues are presented, including Hippias major, Euthyphron, Republic, Crito, Socrates' Apology and Phaedo. There are also some explicit quotations, by a detractor of Socrates, of The Clouds, the comedy of Aristophanes in which the philosopher is described as a scoundrel, expert in sophisms and rhetoric, able to always make the unjust cause just.\nThese references contribute to outline the thought and philosophy of Socrates: the awareness of one's ignorance as a necessary prerequisite for the search for truth; the Socratic method that uses dialogue as a means for philosophical investigation; irony and maieutics as moments of the dialogue itself; the importance of virtue in achieving happiness; contempt for money, power and other material values; the opposition to the Sophists and their abuse of rhetoric as an instrument to flaunt a false wisdom; the criticism of the validity of the writings.\nIn the background is the reconstruction of his family and economic situation: the philosopher lives in poverty with his three children and his wife, Xanthippe, a shrewish woman with hysterical attitudes, continually critical of her husband. who does not provide for the maintenance of the family and the house, intent only on his philosophical investigation which she considered a useless waste of time.\nThe aforementioned historical and political events, however, determine the decay of democracy in Athens even after the expulsion of the Thirty Tyrants. The Athenians, upset by the events, are less and less democratic, mentally open and tolerant with those who show themselves critical in comparisons of official culture and traditional values. Socrates pays the highest price for this climate of tension and insecurity, as he is unjustly accused and condemned for having, according to the accuser Meletus, corrupted the youth with his \"teachings\" and despised the gods and the traditional religion of Athens.\nThe defense of Socrates, presented as in the \"Apology\" written by Plato, is clear, linear and calm, but it is not enough to avoid capital punishment in the form of suicide. He himself rejects any other type of sentence (such as prison, exile or the payment of a fine), provocatively proposing, as a just \"punishment\", to be hosted at the Prytaneion as a worthy citizen, and accepting the verdict of his judges. He also refuses the possibility offered to him by his friends to escape from prison before the execution of the sentence, faithful to his philosophical convictions whose pillars are justice and unconditional respect for the laws.\nThe film ends with the suicide of the philosopher, who is forced to drink a poison obtained from hemlock and who, until his last breath, does not stop reasoning and talking with his friends about life, death and the immortality of the soul.", "tmdb_id": 74778}, "62994244": {"title": "A Soldier Came Back from the Front", "plot": "The film tells about the soldier Nikolay, who returns from the front and learns that his wife is no longer alive.

Jean begins stalking Julie, and she grows increasingly anxious. Meanwhile, a series of violent murders of women are occurring in Vienna.\nAt a high society party, Julie's friend Carol introduces her Australian cousin George. George and Carol's wealthy uncle has just died, and they are his only heirs. George flirts with Julie, who is unhappy in her marriage to the neglectful Neil. After a lunch date, George and Julie begin an affair. Julie receives a call from a blackmailer who threatens to tell Neil about the affair. Julie suspects Jean is the blackmailer, and Carol insists on meeting the blackmailer in Julie's place. Carol goes to meet the unknown individual in a forested park, where she is attacked and slashed to death by someone wielding a straight razor. \nWhen Julie learns about Carol's murder, she urges the police to investigate Jean, whom she suspects is the razor killer given his sadomasochistic tendencies. Jean has an airtight alibi. Julie is then attacked in the parking garage by a figure with a straight razor, and barely escapes with her life. Terrified, Julie accepts George's invitation to leave the city (and her husband) for Spain.\nBack in Vienna, the razor killer dies at the hands of an intended victim. Julie is ecstatic when she reads that the killer is dead and that he was a stranger to her. However, someone continues to stalk Julie in Spain, causing her to have a nervous breakdown. When George goes to get a doctor, Julie is ambushed and knocked out by Jean. Jean stages the scene to look like Julie committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. When George returns with the doctor, she is almost dead.\nAt the police station later, George learns that Julie has in fact died, and they consider her death a suicide. George drives to a remote location where he meets Jean. George hired Jean to murder Julie and stage it as a suicide. Jean demands his money, but instead George shoots him and arranges the scene as a suicide.\nGeorge then meets with Neil, Julie's husband. As they drive, their conversation reveals that they have conspired to murder Carol and Julie and stage it as the work of the razor killer. Carol's death makes George the sole inheritor of his uncle's fortune, while Julie's death means a huge insurance payment for Neil. To avoid police suspicion given these clear motives, Neil killed Carol (while George had a perfect alibi), and George tried to kill Julie in the parking garage (while Neil had a perfect alibi). After the razor killer died, it no longer made sense for George to kill Julie with a razor, so he instead hired Jean to stage Julie's murder as suicide while both George and Neil had alibis.\nThe police appear, and George and Neil, trying to evade them, drive off a cliff to their deaths. It is revealed that Julie is not dead, but was saved by the doctor. The police faked her death to trick George and Neil into meeting; they were suspicious after Carol's autopsy revealed that her murder, though committed with a razor, did not fit the razor killer's modus operandi.

Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie Venner, along with his friends Norman Scutt, Chris Cawsey, and Phil Riddaway, immediately resent the fact that an apparently meek outsider has married one of their own. Scutt, a former convict, confides in Cawsey his jealousy of Venner's past relationship with Amy. David meets Venner's uncle, Tom Hedden, a violent drunkard whose teenage daughter Janice flirts with Henry Niles, a mentally deficient man despised by the entire town.\nThe Sumners have taken an isolated farmhouse, Trenchers Farm, that once belonged to Amy's father. They hire Scutt and Cawsey to re-roof its garage, and when impatient with lack of progress add Venner and his cousin Bobby to the workforce. Tensions in their marriage soon become apparent. Amy criticizes David's condescension towards her and his escape from a volatile, politicized university campus in America, suggesting that cowardice was his true reason for leaving. He withdraws deeper into his studies, ignoring both the hostility of the locals and Amy's dissatisfaction. His aloofness results in Amy's attention-gathering pranks and provocative demeanor towards the workmen, particularly Venner. David also struggles to be accepted by the educated locals, as shown in conversations with the vicar Reverend Barney Hood and his wife, and the local magistrate, Major John Scott.\nWhen David finds their cat hanging dead in their bedroom, Amy believes that Cawsey or Scutt is responsible. She presses David to confront the workmen, but he is too intimidated. The men invite David to go hunting; they take him to the moors and leave him there with the promise of driving birds towards him. With David away from home, Venner goes to Trenchers Farm and pressures Amy sexually; after a time she submits. While they are still together, Scutt enters silently, motions Venner to move away at gunpoint and rapes Amy, with Venner holding her down.

They take the injured Henry to their home and phone the pub to report the accident. The locals, who in the meantime have learned that Janice was last seen with Henry, are thereby alerted to his whereabouts. Soon, Hedden, Scutt, Venner, Cawsey and Riddaway are drunkenly pounding on the Sumners' door. Deducing their intention to lynch Henry, David refuses to let them take him, despite Amy's pleas.

Raucher recalls the summer he spent on Nantucket island in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then-15-year-old \"Hermie\" and his friends \u2013 jock Oscy and introverted nerd Benjie \u2013 spent playing on the beach. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach, and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind.\nThey continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie sees her outside the local market struggling with grocery bags that she subsequently drops and comes to her aid and offers to carry the bags home for her, which she gladly accepts, and in this way gets to meet her.\nMeanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to an illustrated sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, \"giving\" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with dental braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night. Initially, the two girls who were with Hermie and Oscy say they will not go in without Benjie's would-be date, but she tells them to go without her, then leaves herself. While they are waiting in the ticket line for the movie, the young war bride appears and greets Hermie and asks him if he can help her move some boxes the next day. The remainder of the evening is devoted to attempting to \"put the moves\" on Miriam and Aggie while they watch the film. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.\nThe next morning, Hermie helps the bride move boxes into her attic, her bare thigh at one point passing by his face on a ladder, and she thanks him by giving him a kiss on the forehead. Later, in preparation for a marshmallow roast on the beach with Aggie and Miriam, Hermie goes to the local drugstore, and in an amusingly embarrassing sequence, builds up the nerve to ask the druggist (Lou Frizzell) for condoms (or \"rubbers,\" as they were known in the '40s). That night, Hermie roasts marshmallows with Aggie while Oscy succeeds in having sex with Miriam between the dunes. He is so successful, he sneaks over to Hermie and Aggie to ask for more condoms. Confused as to what is happening, Aggie follows Oscy back, where she sees him having sex with Miriam and runs home, upset.\nThe next day, Hermie comes across the bride sitting outside her house, writing to her husband. Hermie offers to keep her company that night, and she says she looks forward to seeing him, revealing her name is Dorothy. An elated Hermie goes home and puts on a suit, dress shirt, and dress shoes, and heads back to Dorothy's house, running into Oscy on the way; Oscy relates that Miriam's appendix burst, and she has been rushed to the mainland. Hermie, convinced he is at the brink of adulthood because of his relationship with Dorothy, brushes Oscy off.\nHe heads to her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers a bottle of whiskey, a record player spinning at the end of a record, several cigarette butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out of her bedroom, crying, and Hermie tells her, \"I'm sorry.\" She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say \"Good night, Hermie.\" He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.\nAt dawn, Hermie meets Oscy and the two share a moment of reconciliation, with Oscy informing Hermie that Miriam will recover. Oscy, in an uncharacteristic act of sensitivity, lets Hermie be by himself, departing with the words, \"Sometimes life is one big pain in the ass.\"\nTrying to sort out what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island in the night, and an envelope is in the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there is much to do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.\nIn one of the final scenes, Hermie, suddenly approaching adulthood, is seen looking at Dorothy's old house and the ocean from a distance before he runs to catch up with his friends. The adult Raucher sadly recounts that he has never seen Dorothy again, nor has he learned what became of her.\nRaucher's narration continues with the notion that kids were different back then, and it took longer for them to figure out how they feel. The audience learns Hermie has rejoined his friends with a rundown of the summer's statistics: they raided the Coast Guard station four times, saw five movies, and had nine days of rain.

As an adult, Sweetback performs in the whorehouse sex show.\nOne night, two white LAPD officers come in to speak to Sweetback's boss, Beetle. A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect. The police suggest arresting Sweetback to appease their superiors, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence. Beetle agrees, and they arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers also arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu after some trouble. They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu, and beat him. In response, Sweetback fashions his handcuffs into brass knuckles and beats the officers, putting them into comas.\nSweetback returns to the whorehouse for help, but Beetle refuses out of fear of being arrested himself. As Sweetback leaves, he is arrested and beaten by order of the police chief, seeking information about Mu-Mu's whereabouts, but escapes when a black revolutionary throws a molotov cocktail at the police car transporting him to the station for more severe interrogation. He next visits an old girlfriend, who similarly refuses him aid but cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex. Sweetback then asks his priest for help, but he refuses for fear of the police shutting down the church's drug rehab center.\nPolice officers interrogate Beetle, seeking to discover Sweetback's whereabouts, rendering him deaf by firing a gun against each ear. Sweetback meets up with Mu-Mu and black gangsters drive them through South Central Los Angeles to the outskirts.

The police badly beat up a black man sleeping with a white woman, believing him to be probably one of the fugitives, and that he deserves a beating in any case. Later, Beetle, now in a wheelchair following the police brutality, is brought to the morgue to identify a body believed to be Sweetback and smiles when he sees it is someone else.

Michal wanders through the occupied city, witnessing existence and the surroundings in it become more nightmarish under occupation. He meets an acquaintance, Marian, whom he asks to get more rations from, but Marian replies that there is nobody Michal needs them for. Michal then talks about the possibility of miracles, and Marian responds by saying that he is behaving like a \"wild wind\". Michal tells Marian that he has been blessed with a family now. They go on talking about experimental infections with lice going on when they witness a German officer at a market kick a man and shoot him with his Luger pistol and walk away. Marian kneels at the body and asks where meaning, law and God has gone in the \"void and medieval darkness\" that \"life has become\", saying that \"a cry must burst out of this country's soul\".  Upset that the fascist culture of cruelty is now the rule, he humbly agrees to give Michal more rations. Michal gets a job in the typhus center's lice-feeding labs, where he is approved as a guinea pig, the job Marian briefly mentioned earlier. Registered as a patient he gets his first injection and an illegal vaccine, and he also obtains the vaccine, saying it's for his wife and child. He sees a nurse who tells him this is the best job, that the patient before him died and he can take his place. Back in the apartments where the woman with her baby live, he see nuns praying for a dying man, asking one of them if there is some meaning which he is unable to grasp.  She responds by just mentioning how the old people die of hunger and cold, but as Michal tells her he now has a better rations card and can bring them food she tells him not to and to keep it for himself. Before leaving he again asks the nun if she can't see any likeness between the woman and his wife. She says it's just Michal who sees something which isn't there and leaves. He delivers the vaccines and food to the mother. They talk about what her husband did before the war and Michal says that he too had a wife and child before, and when getting to hold the baby he becomes emotionally upset.

He reveals he wears a mask because he is \"afraid to look at his own face\". It is revealed the man's name is Mr. Rosencranc when they say farewell. Michal reads pages that the man marked for him in the book about \"a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet\", \"a dragon appearing to devour her child\", and \"a war above in which Micha\u0142 and his angels fight the dragon, which was cast out, and the woman was given wings so she could fly to wilderness\". The mysterious man walks through a graveyard outside, takes off his mask and meets an old lady to whom he shows some documents, probably to travel. But as they leave, men from the SD or Gestapo appear and drag the old lady away while they shoot the man. Michal runs out and talks to a woman who looks like his wife. Later, talking with his father, the conversation becomes surreal as his father says he has never heard of \"that man\" before, and Michal says he \"later only saw him once, from a window\", and then a brutal roundup of people on the streets by SS and Wehrmacht is seen through a window, and a man tearing up a paper from his pocket before all are herded into trucks.  Michal runs to the woman with a baby and says he saw a \"him\" being taken away and she says Michal now must provide for her and the child. Michal is then again shown talking to his father who tells him \"there is nothing to save, the world has vanished\" and that he must \"fathom the new laws that govern the decay\" and adjust himself to them, and that that's why Michal has \"acted correctly but cruel\", to which Michal says he can redeem anything he did, \"even the presence of our children in this world\". At the lab he sees his wife again but when he blinks it turns out it was a random nurse. He and other patients have a heated discussion on authors like Nietzsche, Spengler, Proust and Balzac when a memory from \"when all the professors was taken away\" is mentioned, and Michal imagines the same nurse as his wife again.\nAfter having delivered rations to the mother again, the toy horse appears in the dark corner but without the boy on it this time. Instead the boy appears before him at the job at the hospital, telling him \"there is no you and me anymore\". The same day he goes on a nightly mission for a friend and sees a man get shot. Next day, Michal sees the man who he earlier saw through the window in the roundup, now free. The free man then lies down next to the woman with a baby, crying, as she wakes up and sees him. They are shortly afterwards shot through a window by someone. Michal enters the hospital's labs and through his microscope he picks apart lice that have fed on his blood during the lice-feeding typhus experiments. After meeting with the resistance members, he is with the woman he helped with the childbirth, when the boy again appears from the darkness in the corner of the room and walks into another room where there is also a man and a woman. In the next sequence Michal and the woman whom he helped give birth are seen again, now naked in a bed, when his wife appears out of the same darkness and walks up to them. Michal says to the vision of his wife: \"I have been finding you again\", and she replies: \"yes, in other people who aren\u2019t us\", and he lies back down next to the other woman as the wife also says: \"I, who am leaving you, feel reconciled with you now\". As Michal look over the bed he sees a crack in the floor and under it the corpse of an old woman in a coffin surrounded by candles lies facing up straight towards him.\nAnother roundup of people takes place and the nun he talked to earlier willingly enters one of the Germans' trucks of prisoners. After leaving for a planned mission, Michal is pulled away in the last second by a woman who says that it's a trap, and they watch the other resistance members dragged out from a house by the Germans, and arrested, beaten, shot, etc., on the street. Michal goes to his father's place and there sees a painting on the wall resembling the boy from the shadows.

After the loss of her husband, Kathyayani did not take to a widow's garb as her mother-in-law wished because her father-in-law thought it would be too much for the young woman to bear. Shrothri, a scholar in Indian philosophy and the shastras, is occasionally visited by priests and professors for his opinion on an intricate problem in the scriptures. In one such event, Sadashiva Rao, a college lecturer in Mysore, visits Shrothri to discuss some matters of Indian philosophy. Listening to the two men talk, Kathyayani's thoughts turn to college. Despite a little protest from Bhagirathamma, Shrothri encourages his daughter-in-law to pursue her BA degree, which Nanjunda had been studying for before he had drowned in the nearby Kapila river. At the university, she meets the brother of Sadashiva Rao, Raja Rao, professor of Shakespearean drama and organiser of the Dramatics Club, with whom she falls in love.\nSimultaneously, Sadashiva Rao embarks on a massive five-volume project that would detail the cultural history of India from the days of the Indus Valley Civilisation to present times. With an initial grant from Shrothri of Rs. 1,000 and funding from the Maharaja of Mysore, Sadashiva Rao embarks on a tour of India to visit various libraries, monuments, and archives to conduct his research. During his visit to Ajanta, he meets with a Sinhalese couple and their daughter, Karunaratne, a historian of Buddhism from Cambridge. Rao is enchanted by the woman's sharp mind and dedication to her research, and invites her to continue her studies at his university. Ratne takes Rao up on his offer as she has some admiration for his work, and over the course of her doctoral degree and work with him as his research assistant, falls in love with him.\nSadashiva Rao, already married to Nagalakshmi, is concerned that society will see his interaction with Ratne, which by now had become quite informal, as improper. He is also frustrated with his wife for not being able to take part in his intellectual life, which was all that mattered to him. Rao offers to marry Ratne despite his earlier marriage and live in a bigamous relationship. Ratne is hesitant at first, but only for a short while. She agrees, and the two get married. Needless to say, Nagalakshmi, a dutiful and loving wife, is devastated. Around the same time,  Rao's younger brother, Raja Rao marries Kathyayani. The widow wrestles with the notion of remarriage, especially as she is aware of the dishonour it will bring to the Shrothri family, but ultimately gives in to the material pleasures of a married life. Unable to face her dharmic father-in-law, she writes him a letter and departs from the house with just the clothes on her back. The Shrothri family is shocked, even more so as Kathyayani has abandoned even her four-year-old son for Raja Rao, but Shrothri goads them back to some level of equanimity after the catastrophe.\nAs the years pass, Nagalakshmi, despondent, finds peace in religion, and the old Shrothris continue the burden of domestic life, denied the pleasures of retirement, first by the death of their son and then by the abandonment by their daughter-in-law. Kathyayani, after the initial enjoyment of marital bliss, suffers three miscarriages and wonders if her fate might not be in some way a divine judgement on her actions. Similarly, Rao falls sick as he churns out volume after volume of his magnum opus. Ratne, who had framed her marriage to Rao in intellectual terms, loses both her parents to old age and begins to feel the pangs of motherhood. Unfortunately for her, Rao is quite weak, and any time spent on her pregnancy and maternity leave might mean that their five-volume project may remain incomplete.\nOne day, Kathyayani suddenly comes across her son in her English class \u2013 after her bachelor's, she had studied for an MA and become a teacher along with her new husband. Unable to restrain herself, she invites him home and inquires about his family. When he tells her that both his parents are dead, Kathyayani feels his rejection more keenly than had the boy hurled insults at her or demanded an explanation from her. Her health deteriorates due to her mental anguish, much to the worry of her doting husband. Rao also hovers near death as the strain of his work wears him down, as does the guilt of abandoning his first wife, Nagalakshmi.\nIn the meanwhile, sadness once again descends upon the Shrothri house with the passing of Bhagirathamma. Battered by fate, Shrothri barely manages to hold on to his mental calm. He decides that it is time he took sanyasa and begins to put his affairs in order. He arranges for his grandson to be married to the daughter of a  respected Sanskrit teacher in town, and bequeaths two acres of land to Lakshmi, who had served the Shrothri family from her father's days. In the midst of sorting out his papers, Shrothri finds an old letter addressed to his father, cursing the man for cheating his brother out of his share of the ancestral property. Shocked, the old man investigates the accusation. As an old tale of greed, jealousy, and other human weaknesses unfolds, Shrothri is aghast to find that his father was not Nanjunda Shrothri, but some priest who had been chased off after impregnating his mother. This had been arranged so that Nanjunda Shrothri Sr. would have an heir to whom he could pass the ancestral property to, without having it pass to his brother. Shrinivasa Shrothri decides to track down his uncle's descendants, but when any fail to turn up, he gives away all his property and wealth to needy people in the village. His grandson, Shrinivasa Shrothri Jr., is supportive of the decision, as he too would not like to taint himself with ill-gotten wealth.\nIn the closing act, Sadashiva Rao, racked with guilt, returns to live with both his wives under one roof. Within a day of his having made his peace, he passes away. He had just finished his five-volume work. Ratne, when she raises the topic of Rao's research with his son (from his first wife), Prithvi, informs her that he doesn't care for history or philosophy and that he is a science student. Shrothri leaves for his sanyas, but decides to visit his daughter-in-law to see her one last time \u2013 he hadn't seen her since she left around 20 years ago. As he enters the Rao house, Kathyayani, no longer her radiant, beautiful, self but a pale emaciated shell, is in her final moments. Shrothri sends for her son, his grandson, and is shocked to find out that the young man knew of his mother but had rejected her \u2013 he had hoped that the junior Shrothri would have been raised better. While they await the grandson's arrival, the old man is surprised to find out that Nagalakshmi's aunt was his wronged uncle's daughter. Shrothri Jr., or Cheeni as his mother called him so many years ago, enters, and as he tries to pour some water down his mother's throat, she too passes away. Ratne has made preparations to return home to Ceylon, and Shrinivasa Shrothri finally leaves for his sanyas, telling his grandson that his first duty now was to perform the death rituals for his mother.", "tmdb_id": 334870}, "1358857": {"title": "Vanishing Point (1971 film)", "plot": "Car delivery driver Kowalski arrives in Denver, Colorado, on a late Friday night with a black Imperial.

After leaving the party in embarrassment, he notices a rat in his backyard and tosses it pieces of his birthday cake.\nHis mother tells him to eliminate the rats. Willard uses food and a plank bridge to lure them into a pit in the backyard, then begins filling the pit with water to drown them. However, moved by the rats' piteous squeals as they realize their plight, he replaces the plank, allowing them to get to safety. He later begins playing with a rat he names Queenie. A white rat, which Willard names Socrates, becomes his best companion. Other rats emerge, including a bigger black specimen whom he names Ben.\nAt work, Willard is tasked with an overwhelming number of accounts by his boss Al Martin, who usurped the business from Willard's father. Willard asks Al for a raise, having not received one since his father's death despite working after hours and weekends. Al refuses and pressures Willard to sell him his house. Willard sneaks into a party that Al is hosting, opens a rat-filled suitcase, and urges them to get the food.

Going home one evening, he passes Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, where a tinker tells him that nobody ever goes in or comes out. Charlie's bedridden Grandpa Joe reveals that Wonka had shut down the factory because rival confectioners were sending in spies to steal his recipes; production resumed three years later, but the gates remained locked, and the original workers never returned to their jobs to prevent more sabotage, leaving their replacements a mystery.\nWonka announces that he has hidden five Golden Tickets in chocolate Wonka Bars. Finders of the tickets will receive a factory tour and a lifetime supply of chocolate. The first four tickets are found by a gluttonous German boy Augustus Gloop; the spoiled English girl Veruca Salt with a wealthy father; and from the United States, a constantly gum-chewing girl Violet Beauregarde, and the television-obsessed boy Mike Teevee. As each winner is announced on television, a sinister-looking man appears and whispers to them.\nA news report reveals the fifth ticket was found by a millionaire in Paraguay, causing Charlie to lose hope. The next day, Charlie is on his way home from school when he finds money in a gutter and uses it to buy and eat candy; with the change, he buys a regular Wonka Bar for Grandpa Joe. Walking home, Charlie overhears that the millionaire forged the fifth ticket. Charlie opens his Wonka Bar, discovering the final ticket. Rushing back, he encounters the sinister figure who spoke to the other winners. Introducing himself as Slugworth, one of Wonka's competitors, he offers a reward for a sample of Wonka's latest creation: the Everlasting Gobstopper.\nReturning home with the Golden Ticket, Charlie chooses Grandpa Joe as his chaperone, who excitedly jumps out of bed for the first time in twenty years. The next day, Wonka greets the ticket winners at the front gates of the factory and leads them inside, where each signs a contract before the tour. The factory includes the Chocolate Room, a whimsical indoor park with a river of chocolate and other sweets. The visitors meet Wonka's workforce: little people known as Oompa-Loompas.\nDuring the tour, each child's character flaws cause them to give in to temptation, resulting in their unusual elimination: Augustus gets sucked up a pipe after falling into the chocolate river; Violet bloats into a giant human blueberry; Veruca falls down a garbage chute; and Mike is shrunk to the size of a chocolate bar. The Oompa Loompas sing a song of morality after each disposal. On the tour, Charlie and Joe enter the Fizzy Lifting Drinks room and sample the beverages against Wonka's orders. The drink makes them float up and have a near-fatal encounter with the ceiling exhaust fan, but burping allows them to escape and descend to the ground.\nAt the end of the tour, Wonka assures Charlie and Grandpa Joe that the other children will be fine before he hastily retreats to his office without awarding them the promised lifetime supply of chocolate. When they follow him in to ask about this, Wonka informs them that they had violated the contract when they stole the Fizzy Lifting Drinks, thereby forfeiting their prize. Ashamed of his actions, Charlie decides to return the Everlasting Gobstopper to Wonka instead of giving it to Slugworth. All of a sudden, Wonka joyously declares Charlie the winner, and reveals that Slugworth is actually his employee, Mr. Wilkinson. The offer to buy the Gobstopper was a morality test for the ticket winners, and only Charlie passed. The trio enters the Wonkavator, a multi-directional glass elevator, that flies out of the factory.
