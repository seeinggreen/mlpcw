About thirty years later, a random meeting takes place between them, indeed, a clash: one in a hurry because he's late for an interview with the supervisor of the thesis at the university, the other one while he runs away from the police who's chase him by smuggling.\nDestiny brings them together, and a series of elements leads them to realize the swap that has seen them protagonists from infants. From that moment, the awareness of being one instead of the other triggers a series of misunderstandings that seems to never end. When they finally go back to La Monica, who reveals everything to him, a new twist takes over, since while Daniele tries to reveal to his mother that he's not actually his son, the existence of a third father, the biological one of Tommaso, Tommaso \"Mimmo\" Barresi, who had been sentenced to a long sentence for murder.\nAs they are investigating, the only clue that Tommaso and Daniele discover on Barresi is a postcard that arrived a few weeks earlier from a mysterious Calabrian country, San Giovanni in Calice. The two therefore leave for the region together with Eleonora, who in the meantime had fallen in love with Daniele; This, before Tommaso reveals the truth. Once to a Franciscan convent, here they make the knowledge of Friar Antonio, from whom they come to know that Barresi died a couple of years earlier. Disappointed, the three return to Palermo where the love at first sight between Tommaso and Marcella, while Eleonora and Daniele learn to love each other as brother and sister, waiting for the propitious time to reveal the truth to their parents who, although they do not suspect anything even though having in the meantime known better following the vicissitudes of their children.\nIn reality, the friar encountered in San Giovanni in Calice is Mimmo Barresi, prey to remorse for his old life, who, after confronting his superior, leaves the convent determined to take on his paternal responsibilities towards his son.", "tmdb_plot": "6th January 1975, in an infant nursery in Palermo (Italy), for a mysterious reason, a male nurse exchanges the labels of baby number 7 and 8.

However, the entry of Franco's Nationalist troops into the city is eminent. Fearing the bloody repression that was coming, many Republicans are fleeing the country while others are unable or unwilling to do so.\nJulia, a streetcar attendant, and her friend Adelina, a Red Cross worker, are also active sympathizers of the Spanish Republic. While spending an evening in a nightclub watching musicians perform, one of the last bombings of the city takes place. In those dire circumstances they befriend Blanca, whose husband Enrique is the musicians' band leader.\nThe triumph of the Nationalist troops marks a dark turning point in the lives of those who sympathized with the Republic. Canepa, one of the musicians in Enrique's band, is a Republican militant. Fearing for his life, he decides to leave the country. Blanca, Enrique's wife, gives him some money to help him on his way. Meanwhile, Julia strikes up a relationship with dapper young nationalist soldier Perico.\nIt is rumoured that there was a plot to assassinate Franco on his victorious entry into the capital, and the nationalists are seeking revenge. Although the girls have nothing to do with it, they have been targeted for their propagandistic leftist activities. The first to be arrested is Julia, who, before too long, is being sadistically tortured by the orders of Fontenla, the cold-hearted officer in charge of the interrogations.

Canepa commits suicide while under arrest. Teo has better luck and is eventually released on the condition that he has to secretly help to identify and capture his friends, sympathisers of the Republic.

They are facing a personal end because they know that no one is hiring new people over 50. Komann forges a risky plan with which he could secure the future for himself and his friends. He puts everything on one card and asks his boss Sebastian Berg for a conversation, one that could change his life - in any direction - a conversation of 15 minutes.\nBerg offers Komann a severance payment, which he refuses because he is apparently the only one who is to be lavishly rewarded. He wants to stand up for the employees and demands severance payments for all those who are to be laid off, as many are over 50 and no longer have a chance to get a new job. Berg leaves that cold. During the conversation, Komann said that he knew that the company had a secret bank account in Switzerland and that a lot of money had been stashed away. With the knowledge he wants to put his young boss under pressure and threatens to go public. Berg does not agree to this because he believes that Komann has no evidence. Komann tells his boss that this was only used by the management to open the account. Thus, the board is above suspicion and Berg is the bogeyman. Komann claims that he and his employees have already cleared the secret account. Berg doesn't think so. He has a notebook with the TAN numbers on his desk so that he can carry out transactions. Komann says that he can't memorize anything either, whereupon Berg believes that Komann secretly stole the notebook and photocopied it. In fact, Komann pulls copies out of his jacket pocket. Since the TAN numbers are only valid once, Berg does not worry and secretly calls the security service via live mail. When Komann leaves the office, Berg has him arrested by the security guard.\nBerg now calls the bank in Zurich to see if there have been any transactions in the last 24 hours. The alleged employee on the phone says no. Berg then goes into the anteroom, where Komann is in handcuffs, and says with a grin that he almost had him. Komann thinks that the attempt was worth it. Berg sees Komann as a traitor. He had abused the trust when he was caught stealing confidential documents. He gambled everything away and no one would hire him anymore. At Berg's instructions, the security guard reaches into Komann's jacket pocket and pulls out the alleged copy of the TAN numbers, which, to Berg's horror, turns out to be a menu card. In the presence of the security guard, however, he pretends that this is really a copy of the TAN numbers and alleges that Komann is spying. In addition, by the time Komann unpacks, all evidence would have been removed. Berg cuts his severance payment because traitors would get nothing.\nThen he has Komann taken away by the security service. This should hand him over to the police. Berg goes back to the office. As soon as he is sitting at his desk, he receives a live mail sent by his secretary in the anteroom. A video opens, recorded by the surveillance camera in the anteroom. The entire conversation was recorded. The video also shows that Berg did not speak to the bank in Zurich, but first to the secretary, who disguise her voice, and then to a Jaffcorp employee who also spoke in a Swiss accent. The conversation was deliberately diverted by the secretary.\nShortly afterwards, Berg received a voice mail from Komann; the whole thing was planned by the employees in order to get to the transaction number that Berg gave on the phone. The employee who posed as a Swiss banker on the phone wrote down this transaction number and called the bank in Switzerland to complete a transaction. Now the employees have the money. Berg then calls the security guard and has Komann released. Komann explains on the voice mail that Berg will get the money back, minus a reasonable compensation for the employees. Only then would they keep the secret. He assures him that he will have a long and prosperous future at Jaffcorp and that he will find a way to discreetly balance everything. Berg is angry and kicks over the chair in his office on which Komann was just sitting.

They are admitted to District One, a safe zone on the Isle of Dogs, guarded by the US Army. Sergeant Doyle, a Delta Force sniper and his friend, Chief Flynn, a helicopter pilot, are amongst the troops guarding the district.

Don makes an unauthorized visit to Alice in her isolation cell, begging her to forgive him. She accepts his apology and tells him she loves him, prompting him to kiss her, unaware she is an infected.

Aunt Ling revealed that she had been on hiatus from her Getai career for 20 years, before visiting the temple to seek the Goddess. After Ling was wrapped in the Goddess' robe for abusing, the sisters begged the Goddess for talents to perform on stage. The Goddess granted them the voices of the legendary Pearl Sisters along with a magical feather each, with conditions to respect the spirits, getai and people alike, and refrain from speaking vulgarities and having relationships with men.\nAfter their debut performance, Big Papaya's mother banished her from the house, having discovered that she was performing at getai even though she was forbidden to. Big Papaya subsequently moved in with Aunt Ling, Guan Yin and Little Papaya. After seeing Chen performing in a wheelchair, the Papaya Sisters started raising funds for Chen's medical fees. The following day, Aunt Ling's friends were reading the newspaper at the Hawker centre. Wang hid the newspaper from Aunt Ling but Aunt Ling demanded to see it: the headline mentioned Chen won the second prize in the 4-Digits lottery before he died last night.\nBig Papaya was still depressed since her banishment from her house, and kissed Guan Yin, even though the Goddess had forbidden it. On the fifteenth day, the whole household enjoyed a feast and prayed to the spirits. They performed a song while sharing the fa gao. Small Papaya was later revealed to be taking steroids (administrated by a doctor) to keep her strength going, but kept this from the rest of the family. In Guan Yin's car, Guan Yin gave a miniature paper flower to Small Papaya and she drew her favourite crescent moon on his palm with the flower in the middle. He clasped her hands but she drew away. \nLater, the Sisters were trying new costumes. Small Papaya's dress was very loose and Aunt Ling asked Guan Yin to retake her measurements. Big Papaya and Guan Yin discovered the plaster on Small Papaya's arm from the steroid injection. She asked them to keep her condition from Aunt Ling.\nAnother getai duo who ironically speak Mandarin poorly (the Durian Sisters) is introduced. They were intensely jealous of the Papaya Sisters and criticized the performances in the car, but their manager (Steve Lee) comforted them with a strategy to sabotage the Papaya Sisters' future performances, by reaching the stage first and preventing the sisters from performing. After a number of chases between the Sisters to Xian Yi stage, a performance stage featuring Wang Lei, the Papaya Sisters accused the Durian Sisters of cutting the queue. This led to a fight only stopped by their respective managers. Aunt Ling confronted the Durian Sisters' manager and was backed by the stage manager. The Durian Sisters left the site, warning that they would do whatever it took to perform at the Getai.\nThe following day, Aunt Ling and the Papaya Sisters visited another temple to curse the Durian Sisters through villain hitting. Big Papaya returned home to give her parents money as appreciation, but was rejected by her mother who silently threw the money back at her note by note. Big Papaya's mother did not appreciate her getai career despite her singing talent; Big Papaya's father told her not to worry, before proceeding to persuade her mother, revealing that her mother herself used to be a Getai singer.\nAt the next Getai performance, the Durian Sisters reached the stage first and attacked the Papaya Sisters with shurikens, accompanied by booing from the audience. Deciding that the Sisters had had enough of chasing and argument, the Durian Sisters issued a challenge to see which duo was the better performer. The challenge would be held on the 30th night at Li Xing stage, with the losing duo permanently retiring from Getai. After the Durian Sisters left the stage, Small Papaya fainted and was admitted to the hospital, and the newspaper reported on the Sisters' feud on the front page.\nAunt Ling, Big Papaya and Guan Yin visited Small Papaya in the hospital. Guan Yin decided to sell his pet chicken to raise funds to pay off medical bills. After Small Papaya was discharged, the Papaya Sisters rehearsed tirelessly for the competition while the Durian Sisters campaigned for public support. Meanwhile Karen spied on the Durian Sisters' set list. The Papaya Sisters visited the Goddess of Getai again for blessings. The Goddess blessed them, and noted the limitation of her power, and how their actions and karma would affect their overall performance. Aunt Ling then talked to the Goddess and it was revealed they were in love with the same man Ah Long, Guan Yin's father, 20 years ago.\nOn the 30th night, Lin Li hosted the Li Xing stage and the duel, with the results solely decided by the audience. After the Durian Sisters opened with their first performance, Lin noticed the Papaya Sisters were nowhere to be seen. Lim is about to disqualify the Papaya Sisters, but they arrived in the nick of time and began their first performance.\nIn the second performance, the Durian Sisters revealed that they had kidnapped Karen, forcing her to support their performance. Midway through, while the Durian Sisters attack the Papaya Sisters with lasers shot from their bras, the Papaya Sisters and their entourage fought back with their respective weapons, before performing their second song.\nAfter the third song by the Papaya Sisters, the audience gave an ovation to them. The Durian Sisters appeared to concede defeat before shooting a spirit arrow at the Papaya Sisters. The Papaya Sisters were severely wounded and lay on the ground. As they sing of their relationship, everyone including the Durian Sisters is touched by their sisterly love. Small Papaya was warded in the hospital one last time.\nDistraught, Big Papaya begged the Goddess of Getai to save Small Papaya but to no avail. The Sisters embraced each other and sang together for the last time before Small Papaya dies.\nGuan Yin narrated that his mother Aunt Ling never laughed since Small Papaya died. Three years later, Big Papaya is still singing getai, now alone but with her mother and the spirit of Small Papaya supporting amongst the audience. Guan Yin ended his narration by mentioning that he looks forward to every seventh month, as that is the only time all three of them can be reunited.\nDuring the credits, Guan Yin looked through the photos that he took, finding a feather.

Major Suraj Singh of 18th Rajputana Rifles, Captain Kabir, Captain Jacob and Subedar Ahmed discuss the camp's good facilities. They have been moved into the camp out of several Pakistani jails.

His reasons are that perhaps they will finally be repatriated and that a failed attempt could result in all of them being killed. Pakistani Colonel Shakoor arrives at the Chaklala camp; he informs Colonel Puri and Major Singh that all the POWs will be repatriated.

The mob enforcer often has flashbacks of this scene throughout the film. Later in life, the mob enforcer joins Fingers' gang and becomes one of his favorites due mostly to his ability. He, however, cannot see the future of Trista, a somewhat morose up-and-coming pop singer/dancer.\nThe mob enforcer is assigned to look after Fingers' visiting nephew Tony. He has a vision of Tony climbing a fence and falling back. To avoid trouble, he leaves Tony in a club while working (collecting protection money). Unfortunately, one of the girls that Tony is with, high on drugs, staggers into the next room. When Tony follows her, they struggle over a gun, and an older mobster gets shot.

Trista's manager is deeply indebted to Fingers, and embezzles Trista's money to pay Fingers, but that is not enough, so he assigns Trista's contract to Fingers. Trista, incensed, escapes from Fingers and meets Pleasure. Fingers, naturally, has already ordered his team to find her. Pleasure, sympathetic to her, helps Trista by letting her stay with him, knowing that his house is the only place Fingers wouldn't search for her. They become lovers, but soon Fingers finds out about her location, and kills Pleasure, causing Trista even more sorrow. Her blood type is Kp(a-b-), which she reveals when a TV interviewer (Jon Bernthal) asks her what is special about her.

Her bodyguards, thinking he is a crazed fan, grab him while Trista is accidentally knocked down, hits her head and ends up in the hospital. When she awakens, Fingers informs her that she will have to abort the baby that she has just become aware that she is carrying. In her sorrow that the baby, the one thing she has left of the man she loved will be lost, she sneaks out of her room and goes to the roof to jump off and commit suicide. Dr. Love, by circumstance, sees her and races up in time to see her step off the ledge. Dr. Love grabs the bed sheet that she had wrapped around her like a cape and catches her. He tells her she will have to come up and grab his hand for him to be able to pull her up. After she does this, the movie flashes to Gina, saved, awakening from her coma.

Wes and Alison immediately had a great connection that developed further as they shared various joys and laughter of their lives. They even ended up visiting a bar to enjoy a night of dancing. There are also scenes from the previous summer when they both took a road trip across the Utah desert and share a great time depicted in a quiet serene backdrop with no signs of mundane life and worries. With each truly enjoying the others company, they stay in a hotel in separate beds where Alison finally confesses to Wes that she is very happy and wants things to stay as they are so they do not lose what has developed. Understanding Wes's dilemma too, she apologizes for being unable to offer anything more than friendship due to her relationship with Kai.

The conversations between Wes and his guardian angel further help Wes to understand himself, and to realize the deeper meanings of life and the cosmic connections between eternity with Alison.

Deunan demands an explanation and is given the tour of the new Bioroid production facility. During the tour, Hitomi, a bioroid that Deunan has befriended, is mentioned to now be a minister of political affairs. Tereus is actually a Bioroid; a prototype for a whole new production line of Bioroids to be soldiers without negative emotions to impact their judgment in fighting. As his physical and mental strength was found to be most desirable in E-SWAT, Briareos' DNA was used mostly in Tereus' design. Reluctantly, Deunan is partnered up with Tereus to evaluate his performance. Deunan notices that many Olympus citizens are wearing Connexus; a device on their ears which projects holographic data over the eyes.\nDeunan, Lance and Hitomi visit Briareos, still recovering in hospital. Here, Lance states that out of the last five terrorist incidents, four of them have been by groups composed solely of cyborgs, with transmitted signals from surrounding locations, thus suggesting that digitally vulnerable cyborgs are actually being manipulated to perform these acts. Because many of these cyborgs consist of parts made by Poseidon, a multinational industrial conglomerate, an emissary is sent to Prime Minister Athena. The emissary denies Poseidon blame, but Olympus still boycotts them, which Poseidon finds undesirable as other world powers may follow suit.\nMeanwhile, Hitomi hosts a birthday party, in which Deunan is happy to find Briareos attending now that he's fully recovered. Briareos meets Tereus for the first time \u2014 which makes him uncomfortable \u2014 but the two accept each other. Briareos also accepts Deunan's new partnership with Tereus and has found another partner, which upsets Deunan. She storms off, but is eventually joined by Tereus, who displays many of Briareos' personality traits, which causes further confusion for Deunan.\nThe next day, Athena and an assemblage of world leaders discuss making a global security network by merging all the satellites worldwide to prevent terrorist attacks. ESWAT and the Olympus police forces set up barricades around the conference hall. ESWAT personnel detect the broadcast of an unknown signal. Soon, a variety of vehicles and non-cybernetic humans begin to assault the conference, much to the confusion of ESWAT and the regular police. Even more strangely, at the same time, Aeacus kills an engineer on board an ESWAT transport, declaring, \"We will all be one. I am Halcon\" and destroys it to escape wearing his Land-Mate. Briareos rushes to the explosion, and initially tries to stop Aeacus but ends up killing him. As Deunan and Tereus arrive, Tereus uncovers the mysterious signal coming from robotic doves. Simultaneously, the unknown signal disappears, and the attackers collapse. A funeral is held sometime later for Aeacus.\nAt the same time all the satellites are joined, Briareos is nearly run down by an unmanned vehicle. He stops it but suddenly goes berserk and hacks into a public terminal, crashing the main satellite control, forcing Olympus to switch to a backup. Briareos is hospitalized, with the unknown signal ruled out as the cause of his outburst. Briareos gets suspicious of his cyborg doctor, Richard Kestner, who operated on him after his accident. He has Hitomi look up Kestner's files, learning that he once worked with Poseidon's Halcon Laboratories \u2014 but all records of his project are mysteriously erased. Briaereos escapes and locates Kestner, who confesses that he is part of a plan to \"unify\" humanity by erasing individuality, to which he attributes the source of human conflict. He reveals that he secretly injected Briareos with nanites designed to take control of his body when his adrenaline is heated. Kestner commits suicide before the police arrive, making them think that Briareos killed him. Briareos escapes, but is cornered by Tereus. Deunan arrives with an antidote designed to suppress the nanites.\nThe virus Kestner placed in the backup network takes control of the satellites and, through these satellites, all people linked to the Connexus, compelling them to riot against Olympus. Believing that Poseidon knows something about all this, Briareos, Tereus and Deunan track down a Poseidon convoy to learn about Halcon. As they discover, Halcon was once the leading scientific laboratory until they started mind control experiments. Poseidon stopped the project by killing lead researcher Elizabeth Xander in an \"accident\". Poseidon assists the ESWAT officers in infiltrating the fortress where the Halcon signal is transmitting. Once they are in the control center, they discover that Xander was resurrected as a cyborg to control all those linked to the Connexus.

They proceed to loudly sing some of their own bizarre theater rules as a death metal song before finishing on a guitar solo.\nThe film starts properly in Egypt in a purposely indeterminable time, where Master Shake, a milkshake, Frylock, a box of french fries, and Meatwad, a ball of ground meat, break free from within the Sphinx and are attacked by an oversized poodle who kills Frylock before Shake defeats it. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet \"Time Lincoln\", who revives Frylock. When the Central Intelligence Agency break into his house, Time Lincoln helps the Aqua Teens escape in a wooden rocket ship. Time Lincoln is shot, changing history and resulting in the Confederate States of America's winning the American Civil War, with the CIA agents being made slaves to a Black Kentucky Colonel as punishment for their crimes against the South. All this, however, is just an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad. Meanwhile, a slice of watermelon named Walter Melon observes events of the Aqua Teens from his watermelon spaceship, including a backyard concert performed by Meatwad and his dolls.\nWhen Shake plans to use his new exercise machine; the Insanoflex, Frylock notices that it is not assembled properly, and the instructions cannot be found. After searching for them online, he finds a message warning not to assemble the machine. Frylock calls the website's listed phone number, which is revealed to be that of Emory and Oglethorpe, the Plutonians. Before bothering answering the phone, they discover the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future on board with them. The Ghost explains to the two aliens the story of the Insanoflex: the machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super-being, who will attract all the women on Earth, leading to massive inbreeding and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost travels to the past (not before traveling forward to The Bahamas first) and steals a screw that holds the machine together. The Plutonians, now determined to get the machine, point out to him that the screw could easily be replaced: someone can buy another screw or shove a pencil into the screw hole.\nBack on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the Insanoflex with a pencil in the screw hole, but he discovers the circuit board is missing. The trio visit their short-tempered, foul-mouthed, sarcastic neighbor Carl Brutananadilewski, from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After Carl refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the Insanoflex's box. Dr. Weird, whose abandoned asylum has been purchased and turned into a condominium, is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test the machine. The Insanoflex straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays techno music and heads for downtown Philadelphia, all while Carl's strapped-in form is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine.\nThe Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find that the Insanoflex can be destroyed using music. After a failed encounter with MC Pee Pants (reincarnated as a fly) The Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play his music. Shake poorly plays his original song \"Nude Love\" on acoustic guitar, forcing the Insanoflex to commit suicide. Carl (now bulging with so much muscle) leaves with his newly found date, a bodybuilder named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly hatched machines from destroying the city.\nAfter a pointless time travel, the Aqua Teens travel back to Dr. Weird's condo to confront him, where Frylock begins to tell the origin story of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a chicken nugget named Chicken Bittle. In the flashback, Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose: to crash a jet into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock diverted the jet and set a course to Africa, where they would try to solve world hunger. Upon entering Africa, Bittle was eaten by a lion and the presence of the Aqua Teens scare a tribe of natives. After realizing they couldn't be much help, they returned to the United States and rented a house in New Jersey, where they would start their new lives as regular civilians. Shake and Meatwad do not recall their missions, due to the fact that they've been playing with their Game Boy to pay any attention.\nMeanwhile, Carl and Linda recline in her room, where she reveals \"herself\" to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr. Weird shows Frylock a teddy bear filled with razor blades. Shake tries to take the teddy bear, but he loses his hand. Dr. Weird then reveals that the blue diamond on Frylock's back hides a VCR, in which a videotape with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Frylock also admits that he is a transsexual lesbian trapped in a man's body. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship. Meatwad mentions he saw the ship earlier. Shake calls him a liar and shoots him with a shotgun. Shake gets concerned when Meatwad does not reform like always. Walter tells his partner, Neil Peart, the drummer of the rock band Rush, to play the \"Drum Solo Of Life\" to bring Meatwad back to life. Meanwhile, Shake tries to pick up the teddy bear for the second time, losing his other hand. Melon explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the other characters, including the Insanoflex. His plan was that they would kill each other and Walter would inherit their real estate in order to create the \"Insano-Gym\". The others inform Walter that they rent and do not own property, proving Walter's plan pointless. Walter storms off. The Teens see their alleged mother standing before them, revealed to be a burrito. Shake suddenly jumps out the window upon hearing this news, Meatwad hugs her, and Frylock states, \"That's neat\".

Jesse sends Charley, Wood, and Dick away, but insists that Bob stay for his help in moving furniture to a new home in St. Joseph, Missouri. Bob becomes more admiring of Jesse before being sent away. He stays at the farmhouse of his widowed sister, Martha Bolton, where he rejoins his brother Charley, Hite, and Liddil.\nLiddil reveals to Bob that he is in collusion with another member of the James gang, Jim Cummins, to capture Jesse for a substantial bounty. Meanwhile, Jesse visits another gang member, Ed Miller, who gives away information on Cummins' plot. Jesse kills Miller, then departs with Liddil to hunt down Cummins. Unable to locate him, Jesse viciously beats Albert Ford, a young cousin of Bob and Charley who had hosted him. Later, Liddil stays with Hite at Hite's father's house, where he has sex with Hite's young stepmother. Upon learning of this, Hite tracks Liddil down to Bolton's and holds him at gunpoint, but Bob intervenes, fatally shooting Hite. They dump his body in the woods to conceal the murder from Jesse.\nJesse appears at the Boltons' for dinner, where the Fords deny having seen Liddil recently. At dinner, Jesse mocks Bob for his idolization of him, leading Bob to become less enchanted with and more resentful of Jesse, especially after hearing of what was done to his cousin. Jesse and Charley travel to St. Joseph where Jesse learns of Hite's disappearance, about which Charley denies knowing anything. Meanwhile, Bob goes to Kansas City Police Commissioner Henry Craig, saying he knows Jesse's whereabouts. To prove his allegiance with the James Gang, Bob assists Craig and Sheriff James Timberlake with the arrest of Dick Liddil. Following Liddil's confession to participation in numerous gang robberies, Bob brokers a deal with the Governor of Missouri, Thomas T. Crittenden. He is given ten days to capture or kill Jesse and is promised a substantial bounty and full pardon for Hite's murder.\nCharley persuades Jesse to take Bob into the gang; the brothers return to St. Joseph. Introduced as cousins to Jesse's wife and two children, they stay with the family. Jesse wants to revive his gang by committing robberies with the Fords, beginning with the Platte City bank. During their stay, Jesse becomes increasingly suspicious of the brothers, not allowing them to be alone together. However, as the stay passes uneventfully, he later gives Bob a new nickel-plated gun as a token of apology. On the morning of April 3, 1882, as Jesse and the Ford brothers prepare to depart for the robbery, Jesse learns of Liddil's arrest from a newspaper. He suddenly removes his gun belt and climbs a chair to clean a dusty picture. Bob shoots Jesse in the back of the head with the gun given to him before fleeing with Charley. They send a telegram to the governor to announce Jesse's death, for which they were to receive $10,000. However, they never receive more than $500 each.\nThe Fords try to capitalize on the shooting, starring in a theater show in Manhattan which sees them re-enacting Jesse's murder, but people soon gradually become hostile towards the pair, hailing Jesse as a legend and calling Bob a \"coward.\" The shows are eventually stopped after Bob loses his temper and beats an audience member for mocking him. Guilt-stricken, Charley writes numerous letters to Zee James asking for her forgiveness but never mails any of them. He commits suicide in May 1884. Bob tries to move on with his life, becoming increasingly regretful of his past actions. On June 8, 1892, Bob is murdered by Edward O'Kelley at his saloon in Creede, Colorado.

Angered by the death of his political commissar, Gu attempts to execute the CNAF soldiers who surrendered. As a result, he is thrown in jail for three days by his superior, Colonel Liu Zeshui. In jail, he befriends Wang Jincun, an enlisted man and former schoolteacher who has been jailed for cowardice. Upon being released, Gu and his 46 surviving men are sent to defend a coal mine on the bank of the Wen River, which is near Tai'an, Shandong. They are ordered not to retreat until they hear a bugle call for assembly. With Liu's permission, Wang, being the most educated man in the company, becomes the 9th Company's new political commissar. Almost immediately after fortifying their position, the 9th Company comes under heavy attack by CNAF forces. Having fended off a wave of enemy infantry and supporting armour and subsequently destroying two enemy tanks, only a handful of PLA soldiers are still alive. At this point, some of the soldiers claim to hear the supposed bugle call in the distance. Gu, who was temporarily deafened by an explosion, is reluctant to believe them and commands that they fight to the death. The entire 9th Company is killed except Gu, who is knocked unconscious by an CNAF tank shell.\nPLA forces eventually recapture the area later and find Gu, unconscious and heavily wounded, while wearing an CNAF uniform he stole while trapped behind enemy lines. At a military hospital, Gu tries to explain that he was a captain in the PLA and that, after being knocked unconscious, he awoke, put on the enemy's uniform in order to steal food nearby, and then bombed an enemy fuel depot before falling unconscious again. However, the PLA went through a reorganisation while Gu was in a coma and hardly anyone remembers the existence of the 139th Regiment, whose members nearly all perished, so Gu is unable to confirm the verification of his identity. He is scorned by the other patients in the hospital who regarded him as a deserter. Later, when Communist China enters the Korean War, Gu volunteers to fight there as an enlisted man in the People's Volunteer Army (PVA). During an artillery-spotting mission, in which the team disguised themselves as soldiers of the Republic of Korea Army's 6th Infantry Division, Gu risks his life to save his unit commander, Lieutenant Zhao Erdou, after the latter accidentally steps on an anti-personnel landmine. While Zhao proceeds with his assigned task, Gu, still holding down the landmine, manages to escape but loses his right eye in the ensuing blast. The two of them become close friends. Later, Zhao supports Gu's attempts to have his contributions and those of his former 9th Company recognised.\nGu returns to the Wen River battlefield and tries to locate the mine where the battle was fought. He is disappointed to see that the mine has been re-opened and in operation and that the old entrance has been buried underneath piles of coal. He also encounters Wang's widow and convinces her to marry Zhao. As time passes, Zhao manages to discover the location of the tomb of Colonel Liu Zeshui, the 139th Regiment's commander. Gu visits the tomb and finds that the curator is Liu's assistant and bodyguard, who survived the war but lost one of his arms. The curator confirms that the bugle call was never sounded because the 9th Company was deliberately sacrificed to buy time for the rest of the regiment before fighting the CNAF forces. Gu flies into a rage and fights with the curator but later manages to calm down.\nGu starts camping at the mine and attempts to dig out his men's bodies with a shovel, despite protests from the miners. After a month of digging, a living official from Gu's parent unit is found and verified the deeds of the 139th Regiment, specifically the 9th Company. The PLA sends an official notice to the local government to honour the 9th Company. However, Gu remains inconsolable because he cannot find the remaining bodies. At this point, he experiences a flashback which reveals that, as enemy forces closed in, he and Wang buried the bodies of the others deep inside the mine. While Gu went out to continue fighting, a mortally wounded Wang blew up the entrance to prevent the enemy from capturing the bodies, killing himself in the process.\nYears later, the remains of the other soldiers are found during an excavation for an irrigation project. The PLA erects a monument near the site and conducts a military funeral with full honours for the fallen men of the 9th Company. Gu finally finds peace. The ending titles say that Gu died in 1987 at the age of 71.

In one draft of the note, he pens his true, unfiltered feelings of attraction for Cecilia in very explicit language.  Although he never intends for Cecilia (or anyone else) to see this version of the note, he mistakenly places it (instead of the second more formal note he drafts) in an envelope which he asks Briony to deliver to Cecilia.

Shivam is given the responsibility of one of these hotels, which he bears capably and well, making it much more successful than Malik's other hotels. Malik holds Shivam in the highest esteem due to Shivam's loyalty, reliability, and business acumen, and treats him like an adored son whom he entrusts with almost everything - more so than his biological son Ronnie. This is the cause of much jealousy on Ronnie's part against Shivam, but due to Malik's outspoken support for Shivam, Ronnie does not dare to openly oppose him. Shivam has a very close childhood friend, Kabir, who assists him with everything. Meanwhile, Malik's brother Rajan and Rajan's spoilt son Munna nurture a grudge against Shivam because of Shivam's repeated conflicts with Munna.\nOne day, Malik asks Shivam to keep an eye on his young mistress Reema, whom he suspects of having an affair with someone else, while he is away on a brief business trip. Reema is a young Pakistani girl, devout Muslim, and victim of sex trafficking, whom Malik had \"bought\" in the Bangkok flesh market. If Reema is found cheating on Malik, then Shivam has to inform him immediately.\nIn Shivam's interactions with Reema, he recalls his lost love, Aliyah, in a series of flashbacks. Aliyah was a devout Muslim whom Shivam had met by chance in the marketplace one day. The duo eventually fell in love, but when her father saw them together, he wrathfully confronted them, reprimanding Aliyah physically. He also exposed Shivam's gangster background to a shocked Aliyah, leading to Shivam's instantly offering her father his gun, saying that he was willing to let go of everything, start anew, and legitimately provide for Aliyah if he is allowed to be with her. Aliyah's father recovers from his initial surprise quickly and shoots at Shivam with the gun, who ducks to avoid the bullet. The bullet hits Aliyah instead, killing her and temporarily driving Shivam over the edge. A feeling of guilt and sorrow at Aliyah having died because he tried to save his own life remains with Shivam hereafter.

Shivam is reminded of Aliyah's religious mannerisms, which bear a strong resemblance to Reema's, and is unable to shoot her, leaving her alive. Malik tries to reach Shivam, who severs contact with the former, leading to Malik finding out about his disobedience.\nShivam plans to quickly run away from Hong Kong back to India with Kabir, who is extremely unwilling to do so. Eventually, he betrays Shivam to Malik, whose regard for Kabir goes up. Malik has Shivam captured and orders Ronnie to torture Shivam until he agrees to kill Reema when Shivam refuses to do so even after Malik offers him a second chance. Malik is now genuinely hurt and sorrowful at what he perceives as Shivam's betrayal, and he hands over Shivam's responsibilities in the business to Kabir. Malik makes up the old feud with Rajan and Munna and merges their gangs and businesses, with Malik demanding that Shivam be brought before him alive so that Malik can kill him personally. This occurs in Kabir's presence, who is bitterly penitent to the point of not wishing to live any more over his betrayal of Shivam.\nShivam manages to escape Ronnie and seeks refuge in the monastery of a monk whom he had once set free from certain death. He recovers from his injuries, and reminded of Aliyah and her belief in freedom, decides to not continue running all his life to save his own skin, but to \"fulfill someone else's dreams\" - namely, unite Bilal and Reema and send them to Pakistan. He manages to save Bilal from Malik's henchmen, led by Kabir, whom Shivam still trusts and regards as his best friend, who tearfully reiterates that he is ready to die for Shivam, as he always was. Kabir takes Bilal to the monastery, where arrangements are made to ship Bilal and Reema to Lahore.\nShivam tracks Reema, kills Rajan, and refuses to divulge where she is. He tricks Munna into revealing Malik's plans regarding Reema, which are to sell her to the person who \"enjoys\" her the most.

Shivam finds Reema and Malik, who is madly enraged at Shivam's standing against him, when he had cared for Shivam so much, deriding Shivam's new belief in God and freedom.

To raise the necessary funds, he enlists the aid of his brother, Hank, a divorced father who needs money to pay child support and tuition. Hank has been having an affair with Andy's wife, Gina.\nHank is well-meaning but easily dominated by Andy, a ruthless schemer. Andy, in turn, resents his younger and more attractive brother, whom their parents favored. Andy plans to rob their parents' jewelry store, to which Hank reluctantly agrees. Andy argues that he cannot go himself because he has been seen in the neighborhood recently. They assume that only Doris, an elderly employee, will be there, necessitating only a toy gun, and ensuring that insurance will make it a victimless crime. Andy plans to fence the jewelry via a New York City dealer his father knows, and expects to net about $120,000 from the robbery.\nWithout consulting Andy, Hank hires Bobby Lasorda, an acquaintance who is an experienced thief, to help him. Bobby reveals a real gun and commits the robbery himself while Hank waits in the car. The brothers' mother Nanette happens to be filling in for Doris, and while Bobby is distracted, Nanette grabs a hidden pistol and shoots him; he shoots her back, mortally wounding her, before she kills him with a second shot. She dies a week later in the hospital. Unsatisfied with the police investigation, her husband Charles becomes obsessed with finding information about the crime.

At Nanette's wake, Andy and Charles have a complex and emotional exchange. Charles states he loves Andy despite their long-standing differences. Andy, who feels like an outsider, questions his biological heritage, and Charles slaps him. Andy and Gina immediately leave. On their drive home, Andy has an emotional breakdown over his relationship with his father. At home, Gina tells Andy his boss has been trying to contact him.

Andy, preoccupied with his problems, hardly reacts when Gina announces she is leaving him or even when she reveals her affair with Hank, and instead he gives her money for her departure when she asks for some.\nCharles, searching for information about the robbery, visits the same fence Andy contacted. After an acrimonious exchange indicating a longstanding, mutual dislike, the jeweler reveals that Andy recently came looking to fence some jewels. Charles immediately goes looking for Andy. Andy decides to resolve Hank's blackmail situation by robbing a heroin dealer whom he frequents and then escaping abroad.\nAt the dealer's apartment, Andy and Hank overpower and rob the dealer. Hank is shocked when Andy kills the dealer and a client who happened to be present. The brothers meet Dex to pay him off, but Andy impulsively kills him to prevent continued blackmail. Andy appears ready to kill Chris, but Hank objects after hearing Chris' baby crying in another room. Andy turns the gun on Hank, revealing that he knows about Hank and Gina's relationship. Hank begs Andy to kill him. As Andy pauses, Chris shoots Andy in the back with Dex's gun. Horrified, she orders Hank to leave, and he guiltily leaves some of the money behind for her before fleeing.\nAfter leaving the fence, Charles tails Andy. He follows Andy from his apartment tower, watches as he goes to Hank's apartment, then follows his sons to their meeting with Chris; Charles sees Hank fleeing the apartment and calls out to him, but Hank continues running, and escapes.

Upon arriving, Beowulf becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife Queen Wealtheow.\nThe men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out while Beowulf strips naked and relaxes so that when the beast attacks, they can have a fair and equal fight. During the fight, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has hypersensitive hearing and ruptures the creature's eardrum. Grendel shrinks in size and manages to escape only after Beowulf severs his arm, mortally wounding him. In thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which commemorates Hrothgar's victory over the mighty dragon Fafnir.\nIn his cave, Grendel's mother swears revenge over his corpse. She travels to Heorot and slaughters Beowulf's men in the night. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf that Grendel's mother is the last of the Water Demons. Hrothgar's adviser, Unferth, offers Beowulf his sword Hrunting to slay Grendel's mother. Beowulf and Wiglaf then travel to the demon's cave, where Beowulf enters alone and encounters the demon, who takes the form of a beautiful, gold-covered naked woman. He tries to kill her with Hrunting but fails due to her magic. Instead, she seduces him with promises to make him king in exchange for the drinking horn and a son to replace Grendel, which Beowulf agrees to when they both kiss.\nAfterwards, Beowulf returns to Heorot with Grendel's head and announces he has killed his mother the demon. He recounts embellished stories of a fight, claiming he left the sword impaled in the body of Grendel's mother and lost the golden drinking horn in the battle. Hrothgar speaks to Beowulf privately, and asks if he truly killed Grendel's mother. Despite Beowulf's boasting and calling Grendel's mother a 'hag', Hrothgar is not fooled and indirectly reveals he had been seduced by the demon, and Grendel was the result of their tryst. Hrothgar says all that matters is that Grendel is dead and the curse of Grendel's mother is no longer his to bear. Beowulf then realizes that the curse has now been passed on to him after his affair with the demon. Hrothgar declares Beowulf to be king upon his death and he then commits suicide by jumping from the castle parapet onto the beach below. Grendel's mother appears as a gold light in the surf, and drags Hrothgar's corpse into the sea as the crowd kneels to the newly-crowned King Beowulf, fulfilling their bargain.\nFifty years later, the elderly Beowulf is the estranged husband of Wealtheow, who has converted to Christianity. Beowulf has a mistress, Ursula, but his tryst with Grendel's mother has left him sterile to both his wife and mistress. On the anniversary of Beowulf's victory against Grendel, Unferth returns the golden drinking horn, which his slave had found on the moors. That night, a nearby village is destroyed by a dragon, which then transforms into a golden figure, who orders Unferth to give a message to King Beowulf, the dragon's father: the sins of the father have returned to him (referencing the Faustian bargain curse cycle, which Wealtheow knows about). Afterwards, Beowulf privately confesses to Wealtheow about his affair with Grendel's mother and they reconcile.\nBeowulf and Wiglaf go to the cave once again, and Beowulf enters alone. When Grendel's mother appears, Beowulf throws her the golden horn, but she refuses it and the dragon attacks Beowulf's castle, threatening Wealtheow and Ursula.

Beowulf is mortally wounded in the struggle, but manages to kill the dragon by ripping its heart out, and he and the creature tumble to the rocky beach below the castle. The dragon transforms into its golden humanoid form, before being washed out to sea. Before he dies, Beowulf tries to tell Wiglaf the truth about his affair with Grendel's mother and acknowledge his son, but Wiglaf insists on keeping his legacy intact.\nAs the new king, Wiglaf gives Beowulf a Norse funeral.

As soon as he arrives, a mysterious figure tries to kill Nandhini by knocking her unconscious and imprisoning her in a room, and is saved by Aditya and Siddharth. Aditya's unconventional nature leads the household to think of him as a fool. An attempt to kill Siddharth is made by poisoning his tea, which is foiled by Aditya. One night, Aditya hears the sound of a Ghungroo and the voice of someone singing in Bengali from Manjulika's room. Posing as Raja Vibhuti Narayan, he converses with Manjulika, who vows revenge on the next Durgashtami.\nDuring the engagement of Nandhini to poet Sharad Pradhan, Sharad mysteriously disappears along with Avni. Siddharth and Aditya find Avni being sexually harassed by Sharad. Settling the confusions, Aditya reveals that Avni has dissociative identity disorder and associates herself with Manjulika. Aditya started suspecting her after she showed a little too much enthusiasm in Manjulika's room, and visited Avni's hometown to gather information about her. She associates Siddharth with Raja Vibhuti Narayan and Sharad with Shashidhar, for he resides in the same house Shashidhar used to live in.\nMeanwhile, Badri brings renowned exorcist Yagyaprakash Bharti to solve the problems in the palace. To everyone's surprise, Aditya and Yagyaprakash are longtime friends, and they deeply discuss the matter, in which Aditya intends to cure Avni by using an unconventional method of psychiatry. Siddharth believes Aditya after he provokes Avni, who transitions to Manjulika. Aditya explains that DID is a lifelong condition, but Avni might be cured if they satisfy Manjulika's purpose for existing: killing Raja Vibhuti Narayan.\nOn Durgashtami, Aditya puts a pair of ghungroo on Avni's legs and sees her assume Manjulika's identity, dressed as her and dancing in the courtroom. Sharad appears in front of Avni, who sees him as Shashidhar and dances to Manjulika and Shashidhar's song. Sharad lures Avni to Yagyaprakash, who makes Manjulika promise to leave if she gets the opportunity to kill the Raja and gives her a sword. She sees Siddharth as Raja Vibhuti Narayan and tries to kill him before Yagyaprakash blows smoke and ash on her, and Aditya opens a trapdoor to let Siddharth escape and trick Manjulika into thinking she is killing the King, whereas she is slaying a dummy. Avni gets cured after the orchestrated murder, thinking Manjulika has taken her revenge.\nThe family members, now pleased with Aditya, thank him for his help.

Darren immediately fires Jimmy's coach Darren Goddard over this. While standing on the awards podium after both skaters tie for gold, the two start arguing which then escalates into a fight and ends with the World Games mascot being accidentally set on fire. As a result, Commissioner Ebbers of the National Figure Skating Association, despite their best defenses (Jimmy profusely and genuinely apologizing for his role, Chazz merely defending himself by picking up a sports magazine that declared, as did he, that \"Chazz Michael Michaels IS ice skating\"), strips both men of their medals and bans them from competitive skating for life.

The only attempt of the maneuver was in North Korea, and resulted in the man decapitating the woman with his skate blade. Goddard is convinced that the move only failed because it should have been two men performing it. \nKatie attends Chazz's sex addicts meeting, pretending to be a member, and then invites Chazz to her room and tries to seduce him.

They are soon interrupted by a bloody survivor from the original research team, who Hamilton and Chenne quickly shelter and care for. The man dies shortly afterward, and Hamilton tells Chenne that the creatures let him go as a warning.\nDuring the night, Sydney visits the outhouse, only to be dragged away into the jungle. The next morning, Hamilton tells the team that Sydney came to him scared and homesick and wanted to go home, so Hamilton has Chenne take her out of the jungle, leaving everyone suspicious. However, Chenne drags Sydney through the brush in another part of the jungle and eventually leaves her battered and beaten. Sydney eventually stumbles into an unseen creature that tears the right side of her face off.\nThe team continues to follow Hamilton and Chenne, who appear to be tracking something with a GPS reader. Unknown to the students, Hamilton is tracking each of them by a hidden chipset in their bracelets. At the moment, he is tracking Sydney's bracelet. The team eventually demands more information about their expedition, and Hamilton comes mostly clean. The students remain unaware that they are being tracked but resolve to steal the AK-47 in Hamilton's possession and maintain control of the situation to themselves. Seth begins leaving a trail through the jungle by tying off pieces of cloth to trees.\nOn their third night, while the students begin to fashion their plan for the following day, a foul-smelling rain begins pouring down on their tents. Just as they recognize the smell as urine, Josh is yanked out of his tent and dragged up into the trees. Panic sets in as the team scatters and begins following his screams through the jungle. As Greg attempts to save Josh, Chenne accidentally shoots him, but then proceeds to tie him to a tree as bait. She camps out nearby with her gun, but one of the monsters sneaks up on Chenne and kills her before mauling Greg.\nHamilton runs across Seth during the chaos and knocks him unconscious after listening to his complaints. Hamilton locates the two remaining students, Dani and Amy, and continues his venture, ordering Dani to document everything with her video camera. Believing themselves to be the only survivors, both girls have little choice other than to follow the professor in hopes of being rescued. The professor successfully tracks Sydney's bracelet and finds it still attached to her severed arm, dangling from a tree. Hamilton examines an apparent rigging done to the tree, only to spring a trap that results in several bamboo shoots impaling him through the back. He delivers a final address to the girls before he dies.\nJust as they turn to run, Seth appears, to their delight. They run back to their campsite, only to find it cleared of their tents and equipment. Completely panicked, they keep running while the monster seems to be following close by in the brush and in the trees. Dani is soon pulled up into the trees and killed, leaving only Seth and Amy standing. They run further still and reach a cave, where they see Seth\u2019s entire cloth trail assembled and attached to the opening. They go into the cave and use the night vision from Dani's video camera to move around. At least one of the creatures follows them into the cave, grabs Seth, and kills him.\nAmy sheds light on one of the monsters for the first time, revealing it to be a large Gorilla-like ape with a bloody set of fangs.

Richie and his Russian accomplices, brothers Peter and Yuri, recover the cross; but their elevator becomes stuck on the uncompleted 13th floor. Believing the police have stopped the elevator, the thieves take their fellow passengers hostage to negotiate an escape. They agree to send one hostage down; but, when the elevator doors open on the ground floor, the hostage has mysteriously been beheaded.\nThe remaining hostages quickly divide into two groups: a Christian group consisting of Sonya, Helena and Katerina, who are later joined by Yuri, and another group consisting of nerdy Dmitry, beautiful Anna, and incompetent security guard Boris.\nIn the confusion, the Christian group seizes firearms and takes control, shooting Peter. Katerina is sent to stand guard over Richie and the remainder of the hostages, while Sonya takes Yuri to a chamber where he is to sacrificed by a wild man in armor named Alex. Yuri escapes, but he is impaled by one of Alex's traps, complete with disco music and lighting. In his rage, Alex kills Katerina, allowing Richie and the hostages to escape. They discover Alex's lair, where he has been watching everyone using security cameras. A photo reveals that Alex is the twin brother of Sonya, and they both believe themselves to be descendants of Ivan the Terrible. The group splits when Richie and Anna decide to chase after Alex, while Boris and Dmitry prefer to rig the room with various traps they have constructed and wait for Alex to come to them.\nRichie and Anna manage to drive off Alex, though Richie is wounded and Anna loses part of her ear. Instead Alex confronts Boris and Dmitry, and starts chasing them through the building when their traps fail to deploy.

When he presents the serum to Deaver, Leech explains that as the serum works, the patient will develop a ravenous hunger that must be treated with a special formula to avoid side effects. Deaver has his henchmen, including his top deputy Krendal (Wendy Anderson), brutally beat Leech; after Krendal shoots the doctor several times, Deaver orders his men to inject Leech with the serum and lock him in a tunnel system overnight, to see if the serum indeed works and regenerates him. As he does not have access to the accompanying formula, Leech's hunger quickly drives him to eat a rat and later a dog.

Stoker's niece, Sam (Amber Cull), is with the team for the first time. As they explore the hospital, they reach the tunnels beneath the building, which are coincidentally where Leech is trapped. Having now fully mutated into a giant, rat-like monster, Leech begins stalking and killing the workers. As their numbers dwindle, they too become trapped in the maze of tunnels and are forced to not only deal with the monster, but Deaver's men and Krendal, who Deaver has sent into the tunnels. Krendal is later revealed to be a double agent working for the government, whose mission is to acquire Leech's serum so it can be weaponized by the military.\nWhen Stoker's remaining group encounters Krendal, she initially tries to capture and dispose of them, but she is forced to work together with them to survive when the monster attacks again. Stoker's friend, Otis (Martin Roach), manages to find equipment to use to fight the creature. Meanwhile, the monster manages to reach Deaver in his limousine and, remembering Deaver's betrayal of Leech, exacts revenge by decapitating Deaver. Down in the tunnels, Stoker, Sam and Krendal set timed explosives, intending to destroy the area to kill the creature. In order to buy Stoker and Sam time to escape, Krendal confronts the monster and is killed when it tears her jaw off. Otis returns with a large saw, and the group manage to finally kill the monster by cutting into its chest.

It quickly becomes apparent, however, that the reason why they survived is that they too have become infected with Leech's serum, due to the monster's blood splashing into their wounds as they killed it.

The investigation results in no charge against Wilson.\nA friend and romantic interest, Joanne Herring, encourages Charlie to do more to help the Afghan people, and persuades him to visit the Pakistani leadership. The Pakistanis complain about the inadequate support of the U.S. to oppose the Soviet Union, and they insist that Wilson visit a major Pakistan-based Afghan refugee camp. The Congressman is deeply moved by their misery and determination to fight, but is frustrated by the regional CIA personnel's insistence on a low key approach against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Wilson returns home to lead an effort to substantially increase funding to the mujahideen.\nAs part of this effort, Charlie befriends maverick CIA operative Gust Avrakotos and his understaffed Afghanistan group to find a better strategy, especially including a means to counter the Soviets' formidable Mil Mi-24 Hind helicopter gunship. This group was composed in part of members of the CIA's Special Activities Division, including a young paramilitary officer named Michael Vickers. As a result, Charlie's deft political bargaining for the necessary funding and Avrakotos' careful planning using those resources, such as supplying the guerrillas with FIM-92 Stinger missile launchers, turns the Soviet occupation into a deadly quagmire with their heavy fighting vehicles being destroyed at a crippling rate. Charlie enlists the support of Israel and Egypt for Soviet weapons and consumables, and Pakistan for distribution of arms.

He heads to a dinner party being held by Roger (Tom Beard) and Belinda (Rachel Blake), where Roger makes it clear that he's unhappy in his marriage and wants to be able to \"play the field again\".\nAlfie leaves the night club alone and finds Will's ring in his pocket along with a note containing his phone number. Terry is at the home of the guy he met at the club (Johnny Harris). It is not a usual hook-up; instead of getting naked, they are awkwardly talking in the living room. The guy mentions that his mother has recently died, and Terry claims his mother is also dead, having been run over by a mail van. The guy then makes a pass at Terry who jumps away, making an excuse about wanting the music turned up.  As the guy goes to turn the music up, Terry suddenly and brutally smashes him over the head with an ashtray.  As the guy begs for mercy, Terry repeatedly kicks him, forces cigarette butts in his mouth, verbally abuses him, and urinates on him.\nTheo's parents arrive at the dinner party and he is left home alone. He goes to his bedroom window, where he can see across into Tim's flat. Seeing Tim appear shirtless by the window in just his boxers, Theo proceeds to kneel beside the window, light a cigarette, drop his shorts and masturbate while looking at Tim.\nBack in the public toilets, Julian is still there, spying through a glory hole in one of the cubicles. He attracts a guy in the neighbouring cubicle, whom he proceeds to suck off. The other guy abruptly enters Julian's cubicle and roughly fucks him. Alfie enters the toilets and hears the sound of the two men having sex as he tries to urinate. The guy leaves and Alfie briefly sees Julian with his trousers down inside the cubicle, before he shuts the door. Alfie is then approached by two guys, who chase him out of the toilets and onto Clapham Common. Julian arrives at the dinner party, where Robin recognises him as the guy he saw in the toilets.\nMeanwhile, Theo heads over to Tim's flat to return his pen. He tries desperately to enter against Tim's wishes, getting his foot hurt in the process as he tries to hold the door open. Eventually, as others are heard entering the flats, Tim suddenly pulls Theo inside. Once inside, Theo continually makes up reasons to stay, wanting to chat about history and asking for glasses of water. Theo notices that Tim's kitchen has been damaged by a fire, and he tries to bond with Tim over a mutual dislike of others who live in the neighbourhood. It is clear that both are sexually interested in each other, but Tim doesn't want to get involved with someone underage who should be \"home for your mum and dad\" and continues to try to get rid of him.\nAt the dinner party, Robin makes several comments intended to remind Julian of the fact that he saw him earlier, leading to him making an angry outburst at the dinner table. Terry is out on Clapham Common where he meets a guy (Tim Woodward) sitting on a bench and sits next to him. The guy is clearly terrified of him, shaking when he offers him a match to light his cigarette. Terry engages him in small talk, with the underlying motive of working out whether the guy is gay or not. They are interrupted by cries from Alfie in the bushes and the guy escapes. Terry finds Alfie badly beaten up, but instead of helping him, he takes Will's ring and puts it on his own finger abandoning Alfie to his sad fate.\nThe dinner party is disturbed by an ambulance arriving, someone else having found Alfie's heavily bruised body on Clapham Common. Belinda is clearly distressed by this, running outside to see what has happened. Meanwhile, Will and Gavin are sitting on a bench, presumably in another part of Clapham Common given the title of the film (but actually miles away in the park on Primrose Hill in north London), with Will having fallen asleep on Gavin's shoulder. Gavin cuddles up to Will and looks out over London. Terry returns home to his nan who is asleep in bed, while the dinner party discussion turns to gay men and sex in public places. The conversation clearly makes Robin uncomfortable, as Marion rants on about a perceived tendency to \"push it [homosexuality] in your face\". Belinda, clearly still upset by the beating that has occurred outside, breaks up the argument, making the point that \"no one deserves to be treated like that\", regardless of whether he was a straight man walking through the park or \"sniffing around and fucking like a dog in the bushes\".\nBack in Tim's flat, Theo confesses to him how he watches him at night and masturbates over his sight. Theo gets upset when Tim laughs at this admission, but they then bond as Tim reassures him that \"people are...scared of being different\" and \"you'll be happy enough\". He admits to watching Theo too, and, although he continues to protest, Theo seduces him and they passionately kiss. Theo is the one in control of the situation; he undresses Tim, gives him a blowjob and then penetrates him on the floor. It is even implied that he is rather well sexually experienced, as Tim asks the young teen \"Where'd you learn this?\".\nThis scene is intercut with scenes of the dinner party, where Theo's parents discuss a neighbour who they believe is a paedophile. When it is mentioned that the neighbour was recently petrol-bombed, it becomes clear that they are actually discussing Tim. Following this discussion, Natasha (Phoebe Nicholls) demands to go home to \"see how my baby is\". Returning home, she finds Theo missing from his room and catches sight of him, now dressed again, in Tim's flat. She heads over there, chased by her husband and eventually finds the flat. Theo is notably calm, maintaining the excuse that he came over to give Tim back his pen. Natasha clearly doesn't believe him saying \"I can smell it\" and threatens Tim before leaving not to \"lay eyes on my son\".\nThe next morning, we find that Alfie has died as a result of his injuries. Robin repeatedly insists, both on leaving the dinner party the night before and again the next morning, that Julian should report anything he saw in the toilets to the police. He refuses, and, as far as we know, does nothing. Terry meets another guy in the park with the apparent intention of again trying to teach gay men a lesson, but he is instead the one being taught as he is lured in the woods and beaten up by Merv (Ross O'Hennessey), a much larger guy, who wants to \"teach a lesson\" to Terry, suspecting Terry of being a gay man. Terry is treated in hospital by Gavin, who discovers the ring on his finger and asks Will about it. The latter claims to have taken the ring to the jeweller's. Will then turns on the television and discovers that Alfie has been murdered.\nWe again see Theo watching and wanking to the sight of Tim in his flat. Their eyes meet and Theo stands up, appearing fully naked before Tim. In response, Tim closes the curtains. At Danny's music lesson, his teacher observes kids taunting him through the window. She asks him about it, but he claims that nothing's bothering him. He is chased again on the way home, and the closing scene shows his violin lying smashed in the rain-soaked entrance to the tunnel.", "tmdb_plot": "Set in the Clapham district of south London, England, the film is inspired by true events.

Anders encourages the class to continually beat up Joosep, and harass him in other ways as well, such as fully undressing him and then pushing him in the girls' changing room. However classmate Kaspar Kordes decides to go into a matter of loyalty by going against Anders and the others' entertainment of harassing Joosep by defending him, such as giving him a spare pair of shoes when Paul had torn them, which does not sit well with the whole class and so Kaspar becomes separated from the whole group the class had formed. Kaspar's love interest Thea becomes distant to him and this begins to worry him but continues to defend Joosep.\nJoosep's teacher Laine becomes aware of Joosep receiving harassment and sends Paul to the headmistresses office and so he frames Kaspar of the whole harassment where they believe in him due to being unaware of his true actions, which leads to the school contacting Joosep's parents. Joosep's Father Margus a militarist fascinated with guns and insists on Joosep being a \"real man\" encounters him about the accusation of Kaspar bullying him and so Joosep dismissively reveals that is the whole class which angers Margus and tells Joosep to fight the ringleader of the crowd as he believes it is the only way to stop and scare somebody from bullying him. The next day when Anders and his four friends go to attack Joosep, the restrained Kaspar breaks free and attempts to hit Anders with a chair, which Anders manages to dodge. Anders then claims that Kaspar has \"gone crazy\".\nAnders asks Kaspar to meet him in the school playground after class. Upon meeting up with an expected fight, Kaspar tells Anders that he will accept the fact that he will not be a \"normal guy\", where then Paul, Toomas, Tiit and Olav appear with a restrained Joosep and lock Kaspar in a burned down shed where they force him to watch as they take turns to hit Joosep, to the point where he can't breathe anymore. Before leaving off Anders tells Kaspar that if he continues to defend Joosep then it will only earn Joosep worser beatings. Joosep goes to Kaspar's apartment complex where they meet up and he informs Kaspar that he wishes for him to stop defending him, a concerned Kaspar asks what Joosep will do and suggests that he could shoot them by referencing a God's law, Joosep believes that it will be best if he simply let's it go on until he has completely finished school so he will never see them again and be free.\nThea becomes saddened and angered when the class starts believing that in a homophobic atmosphere Joosep and Kaspar are ridiculed for supposedly having gay feelings for each other and so she is having love interests in Kaspar. Kaspar becomes stressed by this and tries to talk Thea down about it but she starts believing that Kaspar cares more about Joosep then her and leaves him, meanwhile Joosep is being beaten in class.\nWhen returning home, Joosep's Mother Liina discovers heavy bruises on his chest as well as a cut on his chin, she then becomes heavily worried that he had been fighting and demands to know what is happening but he refuses to tell and Margus supports him on the claim. Liina informs the school administration and at last the class as a whole is rightly blamed. When Laine confronts the class about the claim, Joosep runs home fearing the worst and angered, upon entering his home crying only to encounter Margus who learns that Liina called the school, tries to encourage his son to fight back and demonstrates a fighting technique by giving the boy an additional punch.\nOut of revenge, the class assembles on a beach, calling both Kaspar and Joosep there by writing emails to them showing each other as fake sender. Once there, they make Thea confess to Kaspar that she is no longer with him in front of the whole crowd which sets him off and beats Anders to the ground only to have a knife pulled on him, they all then force Kaspar to fellate Joosep at knife point and photograph the sexual act without showing the knife. Kaspar throws up afterwards and the class walks away, leaving the two at the beach alone.\nThe boys decide to avenge themselves. Joosep steals Margus's two pistols, a bolt-action rifle and ammunition from his gun safe whilst asleep, and the two proceed to school the next morning. As they proceed, students and teachers notice the guns in their hands, when a teacher encounters them about it they simply walk past and Joosep tells her to call the police. Before entering the cafeteria to shoot their bullies, Kerli, a gothic girl from the class who also witnessed the incident at the beach, decides to let the two have their revenge and goes past them. They begin the massacre on the students responsible for their torment. Joosep shoots Tiit at close range and then shoots Olav in the head. Joosep then shoots and kills Thea's best friend Riina. To their regret, Kaspar accidentally shoots an eighth grade female student from another class while trying to shoot Anders. Toomas tries to grab the gun from Joosep but ends up getting shot in the abdomen, then Anders and Paul manage to restrain him and take his rifle, however Kaspar saves Joosep by shooting Paul in the head, just before Anders could reach the exit and escape he is shot in the shoulder. Kaspar attempts to shoot him with an empty pistol, but Joosep runs over and executes Anders himself. Joosep then goes over to finish off Thea but Kaspar stops him and decides to spare her.

Later, she discovers tattooed numerals on his arm, revealing him as a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps.\nThe film then flashes back to Berlin in 1936, where the man, Salomon Sorowitsch, is revealed as a successful forger of currency and passports. Caught by the police, he is imprisoned, first in a labour camp, then in Mauthausen concentration camp near Linz. In an effort to secure himself protection and meagre comforts at the camp, he turns his forging skills to portraiture, attracting the attention of the guards, who commission him to paint them and their families in exchange for extra food rations.\nSorowitsch's talents bring him wider attention, and he is transferred out of the concentration camp. Brought in front of the police officer who arrested him in Berlin, he finds himself put together with other prisoners with artistic or printing talents and begins working in a special section of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp devoted to forgery. The counterfeiters are kept in relatively humane conditions, with comfortable bunks, a washroom and adequate food, although their guards continue to subject them to brutality and insults. His fellow prisoners have a range of backgrounds from Jewish bank managers to political agitators, and while some are content to work for the Nazis to avoid the extermination camps, others see their efforts as supporting the German war effort.\nAt first, self-preservation appears to guide Sorowitsch, but his motives for forging for the Nazis are complicated by his growing concern for his fellow prisoners, his awareness of their role in the wider war against the Nazis, and his professional pride in counterfeiting the US dollar, a currency he was previously unable to forge.\nSorowitsch juggles the Nazi demands for progress, his co-counterfeiters' determination to sabotage the operation, and his loyalties to his fellow prisoners. The prisoners successfully counterfeit the British pound but intentionally delay the forgery of the US dollar. Gradually, the inmates discern slivers of evidence that the war has turned decidedly against the Nazis. One day the camp guards suddenly announce that the printing machines are to be dismantled and shipped away, which leads the counterfeiters to fear that they will finally be killed. Before anything happens to them, the German guards flee the camp in advance of the Red Army. Starving prisoners from other parts of the camp, armed with confiscated weapons, take over and break into the compound where the counterfeiters had been held in relative luxury. Until the insurrectionists see the well-fed printers' prison tattoos, they believe them to be SS officers and threaten to shoot them. The counterfeiters then must account for their forging actions to the half-dead prisoners.\nThe film then returns to post-war Monte Carlo, where Sorowitsch, apparently disgusted by the life he is now leading on the currency that he forged for the Nazis, intentionally gambles it all away.

A new neighboring resort owned by the Konsong brothers constantly harasses Jack. They want to get Jack shut down because they have buildings on the land and want to steal the rest. The Konsong brothers set animal welfare, bill collectors, and tax collectors on the farm. As animal welfare investigator Evelyn Namwong refuses to shut down the farm, having found only minor violations, she is fired. After the beast eats two teenagers, the Konsongs send goons to break in and release three of the farm's crocodiles. Jack's crocodiles are blamed, and he gets orders to shut down until further notice.\nThe beast that killed the teens reappears and eats a young boy near the docks. Its filmed by a tourist nearby and identified as a 20-foot saltwater crocodile. Being much, much larger and of a different species than Jack's, his farm's name is cleared, and he is able to reopen. With the beast continuing to snack on the local population, Jack and Evelyn run into Hawkins, a man who has been hunting it for months to get revenge for its many victims. They join forces to find and kill the beast. While they are talking, they hear gunfire and two hunters claiming to have killed the beast, which is actually one of Jack's escaped crocs. They quickly rush over, only to see the real beast kill one of the hunters.\nWhile they hunt the beast, the Konsongs send someone to kill Allison, who paid his taxes and other bills to help him out. The goon tries to run her down but misses. He leaves behind his cell phone, which links him back to Andy Konsong. Andy heads home to warn his brother that their plot has been uncovered, only to find pieces of him floating in a bloodied pool. The beast was in the pool when he was swimming and killed him. Panicked, Andy calls 911 but then gets sick to his stomach. While throwing up in the pool, the beast emerges and kills him.\nAllison and Theo follow in a small boat when Evelyn, Jack, Hawkins and the crocodile farm manager go looking for the beast's pit. The beast appears and snatches Allison, much to Theo's horror. Jack and the rest of the team continue searching for the pit underwater while Hawkins and Theo go to search on land. They find the pit and, to their relief, Allison, who is unconscious but still alive. She wakes up to see the beast with its jaws right in front of her head, but it leaves when it hears Jack calling for her. It comes up behind Jack, gets a hold of his foot, and drags him underwater. As it goes down, Hawkins and Theo shoot at it, with Hawkins managing to shoot it in the brain. It dies with Jack's foot still firmly clamped in its mouth and him underwater. Stuck too high to get down to help, Hawkins advises Allison to cut off Jack's leg since they can't get the beast's mouth open.

The thugs mistake Genji for their target and a brawl ensues on the school field. Meanwhile, Serizawa is visiting his best friend Tatsukawa Tokio (Kenta Kiritani), who has just been discharged from a hospital. Upon returning to the school, Serizawa witnesses Genji defeat the last of the yakuza.\nThat night, Genji goes to a nightclub he frequents and meets R&B singer Aizawa Ruka (Meisa Kuroki). He then goes to see his father, yakuza boss Takiya Hideo (Goro Kishitani), to whom he proclaims his ambition to conquer Suzuran, a feat which Hideo himself had attempted in his youth, but failed. Genji makes Hideo promise to acknowledge him as his successor should he succeed. The next day, Genji challenges Serizawa to a fight, but is halted by Tokio. He tells Genji that if he really wants to make an impression he should begin by defeating Rindaman, a legendary fighter at the school. After Rindaman refuses his challenge, Genji encounters Katagiri Ken (Kyosuke Yabe), one of the yakuza who'd come to the school the previous day. He attacks Genji in retaliation for getting his gang arrested, but is taken down with a single punch. Humbled, Ken goes with Genji to the club where they discuss the latter's plans for Suzuran.\nFollowing advice from Ken, Genji begins building his army, called \"Genji Perfect Seiha\" (a.k.a. \"GPS\"). Anticipating the brewing conflict, Serizawa also begins recruiting factions for his own cause. Genji succeeds in rallying several strong members, including Tamura Ch\u016bta, Makise Takashi, and Izaki Shun. Serizawa is alarmed by Genji's rapid rise to power, but chooses not to take action. One of Serizawa's lieutenants, Tokaji Y\u016bji, is not so ambivalent and begins covertly attacking members of the GPS, severely beating Ch\u016bta and putting Izaki in the hospital. The provocations cause tensions between the two armies to rise drastically, but Genji is prevented from acting by Makise. One night, Tokio and Serizawa visit the nightclub and encounter Genji. As Tokio runs interference between the opposing leaders, he suffers a seizure and is rushed to a hospital, where he learns that he has a cerebral aneurysm which requires surgery. Despite initial hesitation about the procedure's 30% success rate, Tokio agrees to the operation.\nTokaji approaches Band\u014d Hideto, leader of \"The Front of Armament\" biker gang, with a plan to kidnap Ruka and further aggravate Genji. Elsewhere, yakuza boss Yazaki J\u014dji orders Ken to kill Genji, disregarding the fact that doing so will incite a war between the yakuza organizations. The task proves to be too much for Ken, who has grown fond of Genji and begins lamenting his decision to become a yakuza in the first place. He decides to inform Takiya Hideo of the plot to kill his son. Genji gets a call from Ruka, who tells him that she is being held hostage by men with skulls on their jackets, and that her captors mentioned the name \"Band\u014d\". Surmising that her captors are The Armament, Genji gathers the GPS and proceeds to the biker gang's headquarters. A fight ensues, but Genji soon realizes that the men they are fighting are missing their trademark skull patches. Band\u014d demands an end to fight, revealing that he'd ordered the skulls be removed after part of The Armament aligned with Tokaji. After locating Tokaji and saving Ruka, Genji decides it's finally time for war against Serizawa. They decide to fight at 5:00pm the following day, at the same time that Tokio will undergo his operation, with Serizawa believing it will allow him to fight alongside Tokio.\nThe next day, as the battle begins, the tide seems to be in Serizawa's favor, but after Band\u014d's faction of The Armament arrives and joins the GPS, the odds are evened out. The fighting continues until only Serizawa and Genji are left standing. Meanwhile, Ken is taken to the harbor to be executed for disobeying the order to kill Genji. Yazaki gives Ken his coat as a parting gift before shooting him in the back. He falls into the water and begins to sink. Genji and Serizawa fight well into the night, and though injured and exhausted, Genji eventually gains the upper hand and triumphs. Clinging to consciousness, Serizawa receives a call from the hospital informing him that Tokio's operation was a success. Back at the docks, Ken suddenly recovers and swims to the surface. He discovers that the coat Yazaki had given to him was bulletproof, and that his \"execution\" was a ploy to allow him to leave the organization and live a different life.\nSeveral days later, Genji again challenges Rindaman, the final obstacle on his path to ruling Suzuran.

To save the run-down site, Charlie and Phil buy a partnership from the younger man who ran it when they were children, after the older partner and the original counselor run off on vacation save for bus driver Dale, after spending 30 years running the camp without a vacation.\nThey run into misadventures along the way when Lance Warner, Charlie's childhood rival, who now runs the luxurious rival camp Canola and has a son named Bobby J (although he denies it), is eager to buy Driftwood just so that he can tear it down. He challenges Driftwood to the upcoming Camp Olympiad, but Charlie refuses, saying he wants nothing more to do with it after losing to Lance when they were kids. The first day of camp turns out to be a disaster involving a skunk caused by Max and a bathroom explosion when Phil dropped a match in the bathroom while doing his business when the light in the bathroom went out.\nAs a result, most of the parents pull their kids from the camp and request refunds, but Charlie and Phil have already spent all the money on repairs, leaving Driftwood with only 7 campers instead of the original 35, and in need of help to improve their financial situation.

Charlie starts to regret his decision to call Buck when his son runs off to the woods after Lance and some of his fellow campmates tease him about his father's over-protectiveness because his grandpa Buck told him that he became 'tough' when he ran off to the woods.

Seeing all the kids discouraged, Charlie goes to find Buck and bring him back, resolving all his problems with his dad in the process. When they return, the kids report that they found out that Camp Canola has cheated in the Olympiad; this is especially possible when it's revealed that Lance won the 1977 Olympiad. Buck formulates a plan to win against Canola by outsmarting them. After outmatching the Canola dweebs through to the finals, Driftwood is all set for the baton relay: with Mullet Head doing the climbing course and Max doing the sprint - against Bobby J. of Canola. However, Mullet Head injures his ankle from falling in the three-legged race (or so it appears) so Charlie lets Ben do the climbing course instead, as Ben also knows how to climb by instinct, but he falls. However, his campmates encourage him to keep going and Becca even shows everyone that Lance greased the wall, corroborating the truth that Lance cheated in every game in the Olympiad to everyone including Charlie, and had in fact been doing so for years. Therefore, Ben uses the tree next to the wall with enough time left to hit the bell, thus finally giving Driftwood the win for a change and proving himself to his father.\nLance reprimands his son for costing their camp the entire competition; insulted and fed up with Lance constantly denying being his father, Bobby J turns against Lance by talking back and angrily kicking him, making Lance stumble backward into the wall's supports and causing the wall to collapse on top of a trophy case, smashing them instantly and subsequently causing Lance to break down crying. With Driftwood's victory in the bag, all of the parents who pulled their kids from Driftwood and even those who sent their kids to Canola originally, tell Charlie and Phil that Driftwood might set the best example for their kids after all and request permission to send their kids there, thus saving it from foreclosure.

While initially suspicious and hostile, Houdini's protective manager, Mr.  Sugarman (Timothy Spall), eventually tells Mary and Benji the truth: Houdini, busy doing a show, was unable to visit his mother on her deathbed, and is racked with guilt.\nMary, wearing Houdini's mother's wedding dress, performs the heavily-publicized act surrounded by a crowd of reporters. When she has a crisis of conscience and attempts to leave, Benji begins seizing on the ground. She utters the words of the Kaddish, addresses Houdini as \"Ehrich\" (his real given name), and asks (in a mix of German and German-accented English) where he is. Houdini says, \"I'm here, Mama,\" and begins crying next to Benji. (Whether her fit is genuine or staged is not specified.) When a note written to confirm the veracity of the experiment is shown to be blank, Houdini reveals to the press the \"eternal shame\" he feels because he wasn't able to reach his mother before she died. Thus, he was unable to comfort her in her moment of death, and doesn't know her final words.\nThe McGarvies are awarded the $10,000. Mary becomes disgruntled, feeling Houdini does not love her as she believed. However, he visits the small cottage Mary and Benji share and confirms his feelings for her. They make love and spend the night together before Houdini leaves for a performance in Montreal.\nFollowing Houdini's arrival in Canada, a \"Red-Haired Prankster\" abruptly punches him in the stomach, fatally rupturing his appendix. After calling for a doctor, Sugarman privately reveals that he told Mary and Benji the truth about Houdini's mother, hoping that the staged seance would provide him with closure; Houdini replies, \"I know.\"\nAt a movie theater in Scotland, Benji weeps while viewing newsreel footage about Houdini's death, in which he faces the camera and appears to bid goodbye. In a voiceover, Benji states that, \"Houdini changed our lives.

Making this connection to a human being changes the specific nature of a Harvester, which allowed the old man (and now Ian) to kill the members of their kind.

The night nears and Willard tells everyone to go to sleep to have a fresh start tomorrow. In private, he confesses to Nick that the book he wants to write isn't actually about Nick, but about the chair. He admits to believing that Nick's \"hallucinations\" were actually real events.

The film opens as Bauby wakes from his three-week coma in a hospital in Berck-sur-Mer, France. After an initial rather over-optimistic analysis from one doctor, a neurologist explains that he has locked-in syndrome, an extremely rare condition in which the patient is almost completely physically paralyzed, but remains mentally normal. At first, the viewer primarily hears Bauby's \"thoughts\" (he thinks that he is speaking but no one hears him), which are inaccessible to the other characters (who are seen through his one functioning eye).\nA speech therapist and physical therapist try to help Bauby become as functional as possible. Bauby cannot speak, but he develops a system of communication with his speech and language therapist by blinking his left eye as she reads a list of letters to laboriously spell out his messages, letter by letter.\nGradually, the film's restricted point of view broadens out, and the viewer begins to see Bauby from \"outside\", in addition to experiencing incidents from his past, including a visit to Lourdes. He also fantasizes, imagining beaches, mountains, the Empress Eug\u00e9nie and an erotic feast with one of his transcriptionists. It is revealed that Bauby had been editor of the popular French fashion magazine Elle, and that he had a deal to write a book (which was originally going to be based on The Count of Monte Cristo but from a female perspective). He decides that he will still write a book, using his slow and exhausting communication technique. A woman from the publishing house with which Bauby had the original book contract is brought in to take dictation.\nThe new book explains what it is like to now be him, trapped in his body, which he sees as being within an old-fashioned deep-sea diving suit with a brass helmet, which is called a scaphandre in French, as in the original title. Others around see his spirit, still alive, as a \"Butterfly\".\nThe story of Bauby's writing is juxtaposed with his recollections and regrets until his stroke.  We see his three children, their mother (whom he never married), his mistress, his friends, and his father. He encounters people from his past whose lives bear similarities to his own \"entrapment\": a friend who was kidnapped in Beirut and held in solitary confinement for four years, and his own 92-year-old father, who is confined to his own apartment, because he is too frail to descend four flights of stairs.\nBauby eventually completes his memoir and hears the critics' responses.

He then asks Doraemon for his what-if-telephone-booth gadget which allows both to go to a parallel world where magic is ordinary to all.\nHowever, Doraemon tells that magic is just a superstition and there is no way such world could be created. At the same time when they re-enter their room, a life-sized statue of Doraemon fell down from the sky, which surprise them both. As they fix the problem, Gian and Suneo call them, finding another statue of Nobita out on the field. Doraemon and Nobita are confused and choose to leave these statues in their backyard. In the night, the family is surprised when the statues appear inside of the house, in another position. Doraemon and Nobita do not have time to find out the truth, so they simply put the statues in Doraemon's magic pocket. At midnight, Doraemon suddenly gets a stomachache and rushes to the 22nd century to check, where his pain stops and he denies to have a scan through to detect the problem. He returns to the 21st century, where Nobita tells him that they can use the \"What if\" Telephone Booth to materialize a Magic World. This allows them both to go to a parallel world where magic is ordinary to all. There, they find out that a demonic planet is approaching and threatens the lives of everyone ovelled with magic, Nobita discovers that they still cannot use magic, since magic, just like science, is something they need to learn. He is bored again, and wants to return to the normal world. But, because Gian and Suneo tease him on his disability of riding a broom, he is motivated and starts magic training. While learning magic, Nobita and Doraemon find out that using a certain form of magic lifts up Shizuka's skirt. They keep on doing so to catch a glimpse of her underwear, which results in her getting angry. When they finish training, the group see a falling object coming down to Earth. They fly there to examine the crash site, where they meet Miyoko, who is a high-class magic user and knows of a demonic planet that will destroy Earth very soon. He also reveals the secret of Miyoko's mom, who had struck a deal with the Demon King to save Miyoko from a deadly disease. The only way to save Earth, according to Professor Mangetsu, is noted in the tome of magic, written by Nirnaeth, a man who borrowed powers from the Moon, and hidden somewhere on Earth.\nSatisfied of what he has achieved, Nobita wishes to go back to the normal world. But as they arrive home, they find the Booth has been dumped by their mom and is broken. The two get into a quarrel. Later, an earthquake occurs and as the news is telecast, Doraemon and Nobita head to Miyoko's home, where they save Miyoko from being killed by a dragon.

Eventually, she decides leaves alone as she does not want to endanger her friends.\nAs natural disasters occur more and more, Doraemon's group decide to help Miyoko to find the tome to defeat the demons. While finding the tome, Nobita again accidentally lifts Shizuka's skirt up in front of everyone, to reveal her underwear by using magic. This results in him getting pushed, and hitting in a hidden button which reveals the tome. However, when they find the tome, Miyoko attacks at Gian to get the tome, and removes her disguise and shows herself as Medusa, a demoness under control of the Demon King. She cannot reach the tome under protection of the anti-demon power source, so she has takes advantage of Doraemon's group to help her take the secret paper. She forms a glacier, trying to kill the group by locking them in the ice. But, the group escapes. They find that the tome was actually divided into two halves, which provides them a chance to save Earth. At the same time, they find Miyoko in the appearance of a mouse, whose curse is lifted under the light of the moon. As Doraemon is afraid of mice, the group casts a different spell to turn Miyoko into a cat, as their power cannot lift the curse. United, they then go to the Magic Planet to defeat the Demon King and rescue Miyoko's father.\nThe group manages to break into the Demon Castle, armed with silver arrows to kill the Demon King by shooting the arrows into his heart, and Moon Torch Light for defense. However, the arrows do not work and they are chased away. Only Nobita and Doraemon manage to escape while the rest are captured and locked inside the Castle. Doraemon realizes that they can undo everything by going back in time to stop the Nobita in the past from requesting to change the real world into the Magical world. But, they are changed in stone by Medusa, who follows them through the Space-Time Continuum.\nDoraemi, Doraemon's sister, discovers the statues of the future Doraemon and Nobita inside the pocket of the past Doraemon, and uses the Time Cape to bring them back to their normal forms.

But Nobita, who realizes that the world will still be threatened even when they go back to normal, decides to stay and finish the battle with the Demon King. They arrive on the Magic Planet again and rescue their friends, including Miyoko and Professor Mangetsu. They then head to the moon, where they believe Medusa is and trying to destroy the moon's guarding power. The Demon King, enraged by the actions of Doraemon's group, brings his whole army to invade Earth at once.\nAt the moon, Doraemon's group fails to stop Medusa from destroying the moon's power that protects the Earth. The energy flow flushes out so powerfully that it destroys the demonic form of Medusa, revealing that she is Miyoko's mother. Miyoko and Professor Mangetsu cry when they see the truth. Miyoko's mother tells that her soul has been taken away when she dealt with the Demon King, so she cannot exist for long in human form. She also reveals that there is a red moon on the Magic Planet, which is the Demon King's heart, explaining why the silver arrows did not kill the Demon King. She then disappears, while Miyoko and her father mourn. The group, on the flying carpet, then race to the approaching Magic Planet in order to destroy the heart of the Demon King. It is nearly impossible at first as the demon army is too many and the group is surrounded. Doraemon suddenly comes up with a brilliant idea and uses the Anywhere Door to go near the Demon king's heart. Nobita shoots an arrow that has been enlarged by the Enlarging Torch Light, and they destroy the heart, along with the Magic Planet and the whole demonic army.\nDuring the credits, when the final scene takes place, they return to Earth and rebuild Miyoko's home, with Miyoko bidding the group farewell.

On their way home, they find some girls sunbathing next to Hogg's Ravine while Cooter and the Duke cousins are standing together at a ledge overlooking a swimming hole. From high atop their rocky cliff, Bo purposefully shoves Luke in to try to impress the girls. Immediately thereafter, Bo learns from Cooter that most people who jump in end up either \"crippled, on life support, or brain damaged.\" Not seeing Luke surface after plunging into the water, Bo jumps in to save him. Instead, Cooter is seen dragging Luke onto shore, while underwater, Bo discovers an abandoned 1969 Dodge Charger and believes it would be the perfect car for them. They retrieve the car from the pond, already in the iconic orange color with the Rebel flag painted on the top. They clean, repair and repaint the car, and after adding their new engine, the General Lee is reborn.\nThe moonshine deliveries go well but before they raise enough money to pay off Hogg, the Boss declares Hazzard a dry county, and offers a $25,000 reward for anyone who uncovers an illegal moonshine operation. He will turn the Boar's Nest into an ice cream parlor.\nMeanwhile, Daisy applies for a job at the bar to help raise the money. Hughie, the Boar's Nest bartender, says she is not the type of girl who should work there, and refuses her but she is smitten. She undergoes a makeover to impress him, cutting her jeans into very short shorts, wearing a shirt tied to show her midriff and letting her hair down. The bar patrons are all stunned by how good she looks, and Hughie hires her immediately and agrees to take her on a date.\nJesse then holds a large party to raise funds for the farm, but Boss Hogg and Sheriff Rosco arrest Jesse for illegal moonshine sales and seize Jesse's assets. Daisy, Bo and Luke visit him in jail, and he tells them that Boss is as corrupt as anyone, and the best way to get Jesse off is to find evidence of this. Bo and Luke soon discover Hogg's plan. He wants to convince all the county commissioners in Georgia to ban alcohol, thus paving the way for a thriving ice cream business. More importantly, with all the ridgerunners in jail, Hogg will then be free to make a fortune selling his own illegal alcohol, turning the Boar's Nest into a speakeasy.\nBoss Hogg wants the Duke family still, which produces the best moonshine in the county. When Daisy finds out Hughie is Boss Hogg's nephew and only dated her to find out about the family secrets, she is devastated.\nThe Dukes kidnap Boss and ride off in the General Lee with the police following in pursuit. They threaten to drive into Hogg Ravine unless he tells them his plan. He is too scared not to tell, and his confession is broadcast over the radio thanks to Daisy's manipulation of Enos at the station. The Dukes then jump the ravine anyway (their first jump), and catch Hughie delivering illegal moonshine into Hazzard. The Dukes make Boss pay them the $25,000 reward, which they use to buy back the farm.\nFed up with Hogg, the citizens demand he reverse his dry county policy and free all the people he had arrested for selling moonshine. Just as it seems the 112-year-old candidate who always wanted to run for county commissioner will finally win, he dies, leaving Boss as the only candidate, and he is re-elected anyway. Hogg summarily pardons himself for his misdeeds, but is forced to release Jesse and the other moonshiners. As payback to Hughie for using her, Daisy kicks him into his jail cell before removing her shirt and leaving. Bo finally gets a driving instructor who passes him despite his wild driving, and Luke finally meets a girl who likes watching stuff blowing up.

She needs food and must lead her cubs to her hunting ground on the sea ice before it begins to break up. By April, the sun never sets, and by August all the sea ice has melted. The mother and cubs have retreated to dry land, but a male polar bear is trapped at sea and must seek out land by swimming. He reaches an island with a walrus colony but is too exhausted to make a successful kill. He dies from injuries sustained in a walrus attack.\nAfrican bush elephants are filmed from the air as they negotiate a dust storm in the Kalahari Desert. June is the dry season and they must follow ancient paths passed down through generations to reach watering holes. A mother and calf are separated from the herd in the storm but manage to reach shelter. The matriarch leads the herd to a temporary watering hole, but they must share it with hungry lions and scavenger white-backed vultures. The lions are shown attacking a solitary elephant at night, when their superior vision gives them the upper hand. The herd times its arrival at the Okavango Delta to coincide with seasonal floodwaters which transform the desert into a lush water world.\nA humpback whale mother and calf are filmed from the air and underwater at their breeding grounds in the shallow seas of the tropics. There is nothing here for the mother to eat, so she must guide her calf on a 4,000-mile (6,400 km) journey south to the rich feeding grounds near Antarctica, the longest migration of any marine mammal. En route, they navigate dangerous seas where great white sharks are filmed breaching as they hunt. Sea lions, and sailfish and dolphins combine to bait a shoal of small fish. By October they enter polar waters, and by December the Antarctic sun has melted the sea ice to form sheltered bays.

By happenstance Yamazaki encounters Yuko and Mami and finds their hair beautiful. He comes to Yuko's salon the next day with his hair extensions, which her co-workers are impressed with. That night, Kondo, one of Yuko's co-workers, is killed when the hair begins sprouting from her eyes, head, and mouth. It is revealed through a flashback that the dead girl's head was shaved by her kidnappers before her murder. Meanwhile, Yuko and Yuki refuse to return Mami to Kiyomi due to her abuse of the child. Kiyomi returns while they are away and drags Mami back to her boyfriend's home, taking some of the hair extensions with her. After Mami is locked in a closet, the extensions kill Kiyomi and her boyfriend. Mami escapes the hair by jumping out of the window, injuring herself.\nYuko later uses Mami as her model in a hairdressing workshop and attaches one of Yamazaki's hair extensions to her hair, and lets Mami keep the extensions as she goes back home. The workshop is then interrupted by detectives investigating Kondo's death. Yuko realizes that the hair extensions are the linking factor in the deaths and races home to save Mami. Yuki is strangled to death by the hair and Mami faints. Yuko arrives into the hair-filled apartment but is choked unconscious by the hair. Yamazaki arrives and commands the hair to spare Mami and Yuko. He takes them back to his hair-covered home. There, he discovers the detectives caught in the hair, who searched his house because of the deaths. He kills them as Yuko wakes up.\nYamazaki explains that he has learned that the girl's hair keeps growing to carry on her grudge against society. He wishes for Mami and Yuko to stay with him and the corpse forever. Yuko rejects him; Yamazaki, enraged, allows the hair to possess him; his tongue becomes hairy and his blood and limbs replaced by hair. In anger, he cuts some of Mami's hair, which begins to bleed. The blood and Yamazaki's smiling cause the corpse to associate him with the man who killed her and she suddenly sits up and slices him to pieces with strands of hair while Yuko and Mami escape. Her grudge satisfied, the hair disappears and the girl's body returns to normal, finally at peace.

To accept the invitation, each must solve a math puzzle. Upon receipt of the correct solution, each receives as an alias the name of a famous mathematician or philosopher; they are forbidden to reveal their true identities. Each is instructed to arrive at a specific place and time, alone and without a cell phone, to work on \"the greatest enigma\".\nAt the appointed time, four individuals converge at a riverbank: a serious young man using the alias Galois, an older man using Hilbert, a self-effacing young man using Pascal, and a stylish young woman using Oliva. At dusk, a car on the far side of the river flashes its headlights. In the car they find a PDA with GPS coordinates and travel instructions. These direct them to an abandoned warehouse, where a back room is set up as an elegant parlor stocked with books and a large dining table set for five.\nAn elderly man enters and introduces himself as Fermat. They socialize and discuss academia, mathematics, and puzzles. After dinner, Fermat receives a phone call about his daughter, whom he claims is in a coma at a nearby hospital. Mobile reception is poor, and Fermat is unclear about the meaning of the call. Insisting it might be dire news, he leaves hurriedly and forgets his coat. Fermat's wallet drops out of a pocket in the confusion. Pascal picks it up and notices a photo of a girl.\nThe PDA displays a math puzzle, with a time limit of one minute. Hilbert, Oliva, and Galois work on the problem but exceed the deadline. Pascal calls it an old clich\u00e9 and solves it easily. The walls contract when the deadline is exceeded. Pascal finds a sales order for four industrial presses. The group intuits that the presses are set to compress the room each time they fail to solve a puzzle by the time limit. The door has been blocked, and there is no escape. The PDA periodically displays new puzzles. As the occupants of the room work to solve the puzzles, it is revealed that Oliva and Galois have a romantic history, and that Oliva cheated on him with Hilbert.\nThey pile the furniture in the room to hold the moving walls, but the furniture is broken as the walls continue to contract. Pascal identifies the girl in the photo as someone that he severely injured with his car. He proposes that Fermat is trying to kill him in revenge, and that the others are collateral victims. When they discover an invitation addressed to Fermat with different instructions than theirs, they realize that Fermat was not their host after all, but another pawn of the true host; if this is a revenge plot, the person wanting revenge would want to see it happen. As there are no visible cameras or viewpoints, the person trying to kill them must be in the room with them.\nGalois, who previously gained press attention for allegedly proving Goldbach's conjecture, confesses that he lied to win back Oliva; the publicized sabotage of his presentation was staged to hide his failure. Hilbert reveals that he is the mastermind, that he has spent his entire professional life trying to prove Goldbach's conjecture and was insanely jealous that Galois beat him to the proof; he staged this \"convention\" to avenge himself. Fermat was a diversion who will be killed when undetectable poison gas is released in his car.\nHilbert announces that he has succeeded in proving Goldbach. He hands a folder to Galois. Galois admits that Hilbert's proof is brilliant. Frustrated by their impending doom, Galois becomes angry and strikes Hilbert, rendering him unconscious. Pascal realizes that the real Oliva, Galois, Fermat and Pascal each died at the same age as the current age of the guests using those names, but the real Hilbert died at 81, much older than the unconscious man before them. They conclude that Hilbert had an escape plan and did not intend to die with them. The three find a breakable wall panel and escape with Hilbert's proof.\nAs they return to their cars, Galois is conflicted about releasing Hilbert's solution: releasing it under Hilbert's name would let Hilbert \"win\", while releasing it under his own name would be unethical but would solve his professional problems.

Realizing that the dog is fast and active, Shane enters him in a firefighter's competition, where they are pitted against rival fire station Engine 26 Greenpoint.

A Square, attorney at law, struggles to instruct his son, A Hexagon, in the art of sight recognition. The lesson is interrupted by A Square's brother B, a clerk to President Circle, warning A to stay home during a meeting at the Senate of the Great Southern Republic of Flatland.\nThe Senate session has been called to discuss the increasing hostilities between the government and the Chromatist movement, led by Senator Chromatistes, an irregular dodecagon. The movement seeks legalization of the right of Flatlanders to color their sides as they see fit. Traditionally taboo, laws against it had been relaxed; this emboldened the Chromatists to demand legalization. The Great Southern Republic distinguishes itself from its enemy, the Northern Kingdom, by its stances on Chromatism and Irregulars along with a democratic government. Relaxing the laws has already been perceived as weakness by the Northern Kingdom who are massing on the borders.\nAgainst his brother's warning, A Square meets his new client, the first female charged as a Chromatist. On his way home he is caught in the melee leaving the Senate. President Circle's soldiers killed Senator Chromatistes and his supporters, sparking a riot across the city. A Square just gets home safely, then barricades his family against the chaos for the night.\nOnce asleep, A Square dreams of visiting a one-dimensional world, Lineland, and attempts to convince the realm's ignorant king of a second dimension, but fails to make him see outside of his eternally straight line. A Square awakens to learn that the deadly riots originated in the Senate meeting that B Square was attending. A visit to B Square's home confirms that he is missing. A Square scours the city, now under martial law, seeking B Square. At the marketplace, he meets a merchant selling a fascinating \"glow point\", and buys one for A Hexagon, who has been sulking since being disciplined for coloring one of his sides purple.\nThe family prepares for another anxious night, only to be terrified by the sudden appearance of A Sphere, CEO of Messiah, Inc. A Sphere declares that A Square is his apostle of the Three Dimensions and privately begins to explain things to him. A Square refuses to entertain the notion of three dimensions, resorting to violence with A Sphere. A Sphere decides the only way to convince A Square of the three dimensions is to show him.\nSuddenly and painfully, A Square is plucked out of his dimension and into Spaceland. After the initial shock, the reality of 3 dimensions becomes clear to A Square, along with the possibility of locating his brother from his newfound vantage point. Having business himself at the Great Hall, A Sphere brings A Square to look for his brother there. On their arrival, A Sphere expounds upon three dimensions to President Circle and the Priests, who anticipated this event. After rejecting A Sphere's message and attempting to kill him, the Flatland leaders execute all who have witnessed the event, except B Square, who is imprisoned for life on pain of death in exchange for his silence while his brother watches from high above Flatland.\nRealizing that time in Spaceland is short, at least for A Square, A Sphere brings him to Messiah, Inc. to finish his education on the gospel of Three Dimensions. Enthralled by the complex world of Spaceland, A Square posits further about 4 dimensions and so forth to A Sphere, who dismisses it as nonsense. Meanwhile, A Square's intrusion into Spaceland has become a national emergency, which prompts the Spaceland Senate to call to him to appear for a hearing, to explain this breach of protocol of bringing a Flatlander into their midst. They claim that it will be viewed as an act of, and provocation for, war by their enemies, the X-Axis.\nDuring the hearing, A Square also learns that the X-Axis considers the Great Senate as weak, because they have allowed the continued existence of his own world, Flatland, which they view as an abomination. As the debate rages, an ailing A Square tries to explain his theory of multiple dimensions to an unsympathetic crowd. Air-raid sirens wail as A Square collapses from the overwhelming effects of gravity on his two-dimensional body and chaos ensues.\nA Sphere manages to send his dying apostle back on his way to Flatland via a mailing tube before bombs destroy both Messiah, Inc. and A Sphere himself, but A Square's journey back is halted by A Sphere's hovercraft, who attempts to crush A Square to avenge A Sphere's death. However, an X-Axis ship crashes into and destroys the hovercraft, and A Square ends up plunging in freefall toward Flatland and through its surface into unknown regions below, where he experiences a revelation on dimensionality and infinity.\nA Square finds himself in his own bed on the eve of the year 3000 and his family informs him that the government has issued orders for the arrest of anyone proclaiming the gospel of three dimensions. Undeterred, A Square hurries to see his brother in Flatland jail to discuss their new shared knowledge of the third dimension.

They also discuss how a citizen's shape affects their job, with triangles performing menial labor and circles ruling Flatland in the priest class. They witness a cruel incident where a Circle Priest arrests a slightly irregular octagon child, prompting Hex to yet again wonder what happened to her pentagonal parents.

Finally, Arthur is whisked back to his living room. He hears a voice booming out and sees a point grow to a circle and then back to a point.

They stop at Area 33H and Arthur realizes that the symbols show a progression from point to line to square to cube, and that the constantly changing shape in the center is actually a cube, halfway through the plane of Flatland and spinning along all three axes. Arthur asks Spherius to show him the fourth dimension and the fifth dimension, but Spherius says there couldn't possibly be a higher dimension. He tells Arthur to spread the word of the third dimension and drops Arthur back into bed.

Munna lets Payal stay at their place, where she falls in love with him.\nAfter Lucky and Bob receive an advance from J.D. for recruiting their latest fighter Dang, they spend the money to buy soccer shoes for Lucky's handicapped brother Sunny. While they are shopping for shoes, Bob's car gets stolen by Munna and his friend Abdul. Bob is heartbroken on knowing his car got stolen, and coincidentally goes to Munna's garage to buy a second-hand car. Munna and Bob get into an argument when Bob realises he just bought his own stolen car from the garage. Bob sends Dang to fight against Munna to settle the score, but Munna thrashes Dang, which meant he could not participate in J.D.'s fight. Lucky, Bob, and an injured Dang visit J.D., where a furious J.D. orders Lucky to bring Munna to the scheduled fight, since he was able to beat up a dangerous fighter like Dang all by himself. Lucky visits Munna and convinces him to participate in the fight.\nRocky lands in Dubai with the diamond secured. With time on his hands to spare and a weakness for the latest weapons and gambling, he decides to visit Moscow Chikna. Moscow Chikna offers to give Rocky a high-tech gun if he can go place a bet at J.D.'s bookie counter from where he got banned. Rocky agrees, but visits Lalwaani before going to place the bet. When Lalwaani gets to know that Rocky has a guaranteed tip about the fight, he asks Rocky to place some of his money in the fight too.\nLater, Moscow Chikna corners Chobey and Tina in Chobey's shop and asks him to call Raja. When Raja arrives, Moscow Chikna tells the three of them that he'll forgive Chobey's debt if they can kidnap Rocky and get his briefcase from the betting counter in Jumeirah. The three of them hire Puttu Pilot, an incompetent driver who lent money to Chobey, to help them in the kidnapping. While Puttu is parking the car after reaching the betting counter, he knocks into Rocky's car, which leaves Rocky unconscious. Upon hearing that Rocky had gone to gamble, an angry Choksi immediately arrives in Dubai. Choksi and Lalwaani go to the betting counter to stop Rocky from going overboard.\nAt the fight, J.D. is impressed by Munna's fighting. He asks Lucky to tell Munna to deliberately lose in the third round. But Lucky could not inform Munna on time, which meant Munna also won the third round, leading to a huge loss for J.D. Outside the fighting arena, Chobey, Raja, and Tina mistake Choksi to be Rocky and knock him out. They fear the threat of Moscow Chikna when they realise they could not find Rocky and his briefcase. In desperation, Raja decides to loot the betting counters with which they will pay off Moscow Chikna instead. A sophisticated security system secured the counters from Raja and Chobey while recording their faces with cameras in the room. After unsuccessfully looting the betting counter, Raja encounters a now-conscious Rocky outside the counter and knocks him out.\nJ.D. coerces Lucky to bring Munna for the next fight in three days. After Lucky completed a few tasks set by Munna, he got Munna to agree to participate in the next fight. Meanwhile, J.D. is immediately informed about the attempted theft by Chobey and Raja at his counter. He decides to find them and make them pay for it.\nChobey, Raja, Tina, and Puttu take Rocky to Chobey's shop, and after looking through his briefcase find the diamond. Raja decides to negotiate a deal with Moscow Chikna at Chobey's shop in exchange for the diamond. Moscow Chikna is not impressed at all and shoots Rocky dead in a fit of anger to scare Raja. Raja reluctantly hands over the diamond. The new problem for Chobey and gang is to dispose of Rocky's dead body from the shop. They get Santa  and Banta to clear the body. Before they could do so, J.D. reaches the shop where he decides to forgive Chobey and Raja for the attempted theft if they can steal the diamond from Moscow Chikna for him.\nChoksi and Lalwaani contact the detective Gunmaster G9 to help them locate Rocky and the diamond. G9 quickly figures out he is at Chobey's junk shop where Choksi finds a dead Rocky. G9 threatens Chobey and gang into disclosing to them that the diamond is with Moscow Chikna. G9 knocks out Moscow Chikna in his hideout and gets the diamond for Choksi. Raja plans for Tina, Choksi, Puttu, and himself to go to Moscow Chikna's place in disguise and steal the diamond while G9 and Moscow Chikna fight. They are successful, and escape unhurt even as G9 shot Moscow Chikna dead in front of them. Afterwards at Chobey's junk shop, Munna and Raja get into a fight as Raja did not want to act like Rahul anymore.\nAs a punishment for avoiding his calls and winning in the previous fight, J.D.'s goons trash Lucky's game parlour and burn down Munna's house respectively. To save the colony from further damage, Munna agrees to fight for J.D. even as Lucky asked him not to.\nG9 tracks down Chobey via Puttu's keychain and holds them at gunpoint asking for the diamond. As Raja is about to hand it over, Chobey's dog Hajmola swallows the diamond whole. While shooting at the dog, a rebound bullet from G9's gun hits Choksi and kills him.\nWhen J.D.'s goon finds Chobey and Raja chasing the dog, Chobey misleads the goon by saying the diamond is at India Colony, while hoping Munna there can save them from J.D. At India Colony, the goon finds Payal who had escaped from their hands. J.D. instructed him to burn down the colony and kill Payal in the process. Raja takes it upon himself to save the colony from J.D.'s men.\nAt the fight, Munna won the first two rounds. Raja calls Lucky to tell him the colony is safe and to instruct Munna to go for the win in the third round as well. After Munna's win, Lucky beats up J.D. and throws him in the sea, where he eventually died as he didn't know how to swim.\nIn the end, Raja & Tina and Munna & Payal get married and live together with Lajwanti. Chobey gets the diamond out of Hajmola and gets rich by selling it off. He gives Lucky and Puttu their share while Lucky gives all the winnings of the fight to Munna.\nThe end credits have a special appearance from Mike Tyson.", "tmdb_plot": "A bunch of misfits and gangsters embarks on a journey to find a lost and stolen diamond.", "tmdb_id": "156288", "wiki_id": "5949974"}, {"title": "Footskating 101", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "In order to save his grandmother, his town, and his own skin, Vince, a poor miner's son, takes part in a skateboarding competition without a skateboard.

Crawford confesses he shot his wife. Recognizing the victim, and being subtly goaded by Crawford, Nunally becomes enraged and assaults him.\nNow in jail awaiting trial, Crawford engages in a battle of wits with rising star deputy district attorney William \"Willy\" Beachum, who considers the case an open-and-shut matter and agrees to go to trial immediately. Beachum is preparing to change over from criminal law to a corporate attorneyship at well-known law firm Wooton Sims, and flirts with his future boss, Nikki Gardner.\nAt the trial, Crawford acts as his own attorney, thereby matching himself, an untrained defendant, against a star prosecutor. Crawford informs the court that the arresting officer (Nunally) was having an affair with his wife, assaulted him during his arrest, and was present during his interrogation. Crawford's confession is therefore ruled inadmissible as evidence, being, as the judge puts it,  fruit of the poisonous tree. Beachum discovers that Crawford's handgun could not have been used in the shooting because it does not match shell casings at the crime scene and in fact has never been fired. This baffles police, since CCTV surveillance was in use during the shooting and until Crawford's arrest, during which time he did not leave the house.\nNunally comes up with a scheme to plant false evidence to implicate Crawford, which Beachum rejects.

Realizing that Crawford's plan is to dispose of the only eyewitness to the crime, Beachum obtains a court order to keep Jennifer on life support. He arrives at the hospital, but is unable to prevent staff turning off her life support.\nA mix-up of cell phones causes Beachum to realize that Nunally and Crawford both used the same type of gun, a .45 caliber Glock 21.

African American student Grant Rice, frustrated about losing an arcade game, demands a refund from the store owner. As Grant storms out, Paco, as retaliation for losing a fight against him earlier during a massive brawl at school, attempts to kill him, but misses and accidentally kills Sindy's boyfriend while Grant flees the scene and is later arrested for the homicide. As a witness, Eva must testify in court; she intends to guard \"her own\" in her testimony.\nThe next day at school, Erin examines a racist drawing by one of her Latin American students and utilizes it to teach the class about the Holocaust, which everyone, except for White student Ben Samuels, has no knowledge of. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys composition books for them to use as diaries, in which they write about their experiences of being evicted, being abused, and seeing their loved ones die.\nDetermined to reform her students, Erin takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and activities, and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband, Scott. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus. Erin invites several Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the Museum of Tolerance. The students start to realize that being rivals against each other, just based on color, should not be a reason to prohibit their friendships with one another. Meanwhile, her unique training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell.\nThe following school year comes and Erin teaches her class (now sophomores) again, making it the second year that she is their teacher. On the first day, Erin makes her class propose a \"Toast for Change\", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and what they wish to change about themselves. Later on, the class makes enough money to have Miep Gies come to the United States and tell her story of her helping Anne Frank, her family, and the Van Pels hide from the Nazis; she then also persuades the students that they are heroes and that they \"within their own small ways, [can] turn on a small light in a dark room.\"\nThese two events inspire Eva to tell the truth, breaking free of the demands of her father to always protect her own. At Grant's trial, she shocks the courtroom by revealing that Paco actually killed Sindy's boyfriend at the scene; Grant is spared while Paco is convicted, Sindy later forgives Eva. Afterward, Eva is attacked and threatened by her gang members, but is ultimately spared because of her father as she moves in with her aunt for safety.\nMeanwhile, Erin asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it The Freedom Writers Diary. Her husband divorces her, since he feels like Erin is devoting too much of her time to her students and not enough time for their marriage. Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. After being encouraged by her father, a former civil rights activist, Erin fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids during their junior and senior years, much to their elation. The film ends with a note that Erin successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate and attend college\u2014for many, the first in their families to do so.", "tmdb_plot": "A young teacher inspires her class of at-risk students to learn tolerance, apply themselves, and pursue education beyond high school.", "tmdb_id": "1646", "wiki_id": "7764212"}, {"title": "FreeLance", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Elliot Guilespie (Bob Kunkel) is a smalltown twentysomething with aspirations of stardom in television news as his alter-ego, Lance Windchaser.

Each side has sent seven warriors: archangels (Arcs) from Heaven, fallen angels (Fallen) from Hell. They must assume human form to enter purgatory. Hell has attained control, transforming purgatory into a dark, seedy city. The last of the seven archangels, Gabriel (Andy Whitfield), endeavors to discover what has become of his comrades and to restore the Light.\nUpon Gabriel entering purgatory, four of the seven Fallen\u2014Sammael (Dwaine Stevenson) who is the Fallen's leader, Asmodeus (Michael Piccirilli), Balan (Brendan Clearkin), and Baliel\u2014gather, and Sammael kills an insubordinate Baliel, so reducing the Fallen's number from seven to six. Meanwhile, Gabriel visits the archangel Michael's apartment, finding it abandoned. He finds a note from Michael in the apartment, saying how hard it is to stay pure in purgatory. While walking through the city, Gabriel receives a vision about the whereabouts of his comrade Uriel (Harry Pavlidis). However, Sammael senses Gabriel's presence and sends the Fallen Molloch (Goran D. Kleut) to kill him. Gabriel fights and kills Molloch, then proceeds to the city's outskirts. He finds a dishevelled and alcoholic Uriel hiding in a rundown bus. He explains that the Archangels all assumed human form and became subject to human desires and feelings which weakened them. Cut off from their power, the Archangels were eventually worn down and fell prey to the Fallen who thrived and became stronger the longer they stayed in purgatory. He reveals to Gabriel that this is what eventually led to the downfall of the Arcs sent before him. Uriel warns Gabriel that if they die in purgatory, their own souls will die too, they completely vanish. To encourage and remind Uriel of his identity, Gabriel mortally wounds Uriel, convincing Uriel to heal himself. Though surely aware of Gabriel's presence, Sammael commands the Fallen to wait before taking any action against Gabriel, even though they could defeat Gabriel; Sammael threatens the Fallen if they do anything to Gabriel. Uriel then explains to Gabriel that the Fallen can sense Archangels when they use their powers, and teaches Gabriel to conceal his bright blue angel eyes. Uriel also explains that due to the nature of the evil and darkness that controls purgatory that Gabriel will be cut off from the \"source\". He also reluctantly tells Gabriel what happened to some of the other five Archangels: Remiel was killed before Uriel arrived; the whereabouts of Ithuriel (Matt Hylton Todd), Raphael (Jack Campbell), and Michael are uncertain, but Raphael is most likely hiding in the East Side of the city and it is thought that Sammael has killed Michael; and Amitiel (Samantha Noble), who now calls herself Jade, was defeated by Sammael, stripped of her wings, and forced to work as a prostitute. Hearing this, Gabriel goes off into the city to search for Amitiel.\nGabriel travels back to the city, and finds the brothel where Amitiel works. He also encounters Asmodeus, the Fallen who runs the brothel. Gabriel rescues Amitiel and kills the Fallen Balan who tries to rape her. He then heals her of the drugs she has been taking to dull the pain of her job. As Gabriel's use of power makes his presence known in purgatory, the Fallen grow weary and impatient of waiting. Amitiel takes Gabriel to the soup kitchen where the Archangel Ithuriel hides. Initially angry at Ithuriel for abandoning his mission of seeking out and destroying the Fallen, Gabriel eventually shows him compassion and understanding. Ithuriel takes Gabriel to the abandoned tunnels beneath the soup kitchen where the gravely wounded Raphael dwells. Gabriel heals Raphael, expending much of his strength. After rebuking Gabriel, Raphael explains that Sammael draws his immense power from the other Fallen. Gabriel proposes to take out the remaining Fallen one by one, before finally facing Sammael. Raphael is unconvinced, as Sammael has already killed the stronger angel Michael.\nGabriel fights and kills the Fallen Ahriman (Kevin Copeland), then returns to Michael's apartment where he sketches a picture of Amitiel. At the same time Gabriel begins his campaign against the Fallen, the Fallen Lilith (Erika Heynatz) kills Uriel, Asmodeus kills Ithuriel, and Sammael kills Raphael. Driven mad by anger, Gabriel's eyes turn bright brown, the colour of the Fallen. He returns to the brothel seeking revenge against Asmodeus, randomly killing anyone he finds behind a hotel room door. He eventually finds Asmodeus and discovers him with his nigh unconscious female sex slave, whom he's been forcibly surgically altering to make her facially identical to himself so as to satisfy his narcissism. Asmodeus uses Gabriel's shock and sympathy toward the girl to his advantage and assaults him. Gabriel gains the advantage in the fight, viciously scars Asmodeus, thus enraging him, and then kills him. Gabriel halts his own imminent fall when he heals and restores the captive young woman and returns her to her original appearance. Shocked by his near fall, Gabriel returns to Amitiel. Amitiel comforts Gabriel and they strip naked before having sex. Gabriel then travels to a nightclub and kills Lilith, injecting her with several full vials of Ahriman's drugs. Gabriel searches for Sammael and is soon attacked and knocked out by the last Fallen Angel. Upon recovering, he chases Sammael to the nightclub's rooftop.\nSammael refuses to fight Gabriel, instead asking him to listen to what he has to say. He explains how he despises being an angel, a being created entirely to serve others. He sees purgatory as a chance to take control of his own destiny and lets Gabriel know that it was him all along keeping Gabriel protected and alive in a city amongst all the Fallen, and asks Gabriel to join him. Refusing his offer, Gabriel unwittingly realises that \"Sammael\" is actually the Archangel Michael, his closest friend (who had actually killed the real Sammael and assumed his identity). Though Michael was the one responsible for the deaths of the other Archangels, the real Sammael was the one to force Jade to give up her wings. The two Archangels fight, but because Gabriel has used up so much of his strength helping the other Archangels, even with Michael similarly growing weaker, Gabriel proves to be no match for Michael who severely beats him down and ultimately impales Gabriel's chest with a metal pipe. Gabriel admits that during his time as a human he has felt rage and anger, but he has also experienced things that Michael hasn't. An impaled Gabriel embraces Michael, which drives the metal pipe through Michael's chest also, and tells Michael that he forgives him. Both Archangels collapse. Before dying, Michael uses what remains of his strength to save Gabriel's life, healing his wound. Light returns to purgatory.\nKneeling in front of Michael's dead body, Gabriel shouts up at God asking \"Is It This That You Wanted? Is It This You Wanted?!\" The healed Gabriel moves to the edge of the rooftop, and muses that he needs to understand why all this happened. He outstretches his arms, and lets himself fall.

At the eve of Lockland's destruction, the desperate Locklander king turns to his chief sorcerer Armand (Larry Drake) for help after his castle is besieged and his som and crown prince got killed in the ensuing struggle against the counsel of Amelia (Amber Benson), the prince's brother. With aid of a portion of the king's blood as well as his own, Armand brings a stone statue of a gryphon, a flying beast that is the totem of Lockland, to life against the invaders. As Amelia feared, shortly after the invading army has been dealt with, Armand wasted no time to turn against his king and the rest of the Locklanders in a coup with the gryphon on his side.

That same night, Armand sends his two magic-wielding brides, Daphne and Kyra, to seduce one of the Locklander soldiers into stealing the haft piece from Amelia and Seth. When Seth and Amelia find it gone the next morning, they decide to send messengers to their respective parents to muster the combined armies of Lockland and Delphi. Amelia and her remaining knights attack Armand's lair, while Seth and his retainer David enter a magically-warded labyrinth to retrieve the blade.\nThe two kings call a truce and their armies prepare for a massed assault, while the gryphon prepares to destroy them. Queen Cassandra of Delphi bids her husband farewell and rides into the deserted stronghold of the enemy. Once Seth retrieves the blade, he rushes to the sorcerer's lair to confront him, but finds his path blocked by the sorcerer's brides. Cassandra tells her son to leave the sorceresses to her and go to dispatch the gryphon, sacrificing herself in a magical strike against them. Meanwhile, Armand has captured Amelia and killed the Locklander knight champion, and demands that she become his bride.

The two talk about 47's life as a professional hitman, raised and trained by a clandestine group known simply as the Organization.\nThree months prior, 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is completing a hit on a Nigerian warlord named Bwana Ovie, force-feeding a captured soldier with plastic explosives and using him as a human bomb to kill Ovie. In a subsequent change of plans, 47 is told by his Organization handler, Diana Burnwood, that he is to kill his next target, Russian President Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), publicly instead of privately. Agent 47 completes his mission by shooting the man in the head, but before he can leave Russia, he is contacted by his superiors.

Nika persuades 47 to let Whittier go free, and Whittier is forced to leave Russia by FSB officer Yuri Marklov (Robert Knepper), who is overseeing the manhunt, for interfering. 47 contacts his associate, CIA officer Carlton Smith, to offer him a deal: 47 will kill Udre Belicoff (Mikhail's brother and a wealthy arms dealer and human trafficker) in exchange for a favour. Smith informs 47 that Udre had been planning something with a German gunrunner named Price.\n47 and Nika travel to Istanbul, where 47 abducts Price, poses as him to meet Udre at a club, and kills him, forcing Belicoff's double to attend Udre's public funeral. 47 kidnaps Marklov and forces him to order his own agents to disrupt the funeral and create a distraction while 47, disguised as a soldier, deals with the imposter's bodyguards and kills him before Whittier arrives with backup from Interpol to take him into custody.

Paulette lives alone, dedicated to her animals, in particular her cats, and her garden. Her worst fear is of dying far from her home and garden. However, when she takes a fall she is sent to hospital who then advise that she recovers in a nursing-home, much to her dismay.\nMeanwhile, Camille, an artist and cleaning lady, lives a lonely and anorexic life in a small attic in Paris. One day she meets the shy postcard salesman Philibert, who is in temporary custody of a grand apartment in her building. This belonged to his recently deceased aristocratic forebear, and is filled with heirlooms. Philibert has arranged his life to have as little contact with the outer world as possible. Instead he lets his lodger, Franck - who works as a low-ranked cook in a big restaurant - take care of his shopping and other such things. Philibert and Franck are complete opposites; Philibert is a gentleman, with classical interests and preoccupations, who stutters when anxious. Franck is constantly busy; brash, gruff, confrontational and confident. He works long hours at the restaurant, and habitually spends his only day off going to visit his grandmother Paulette, who raised him.\nCamille reaches out to Philibert on impulse, inviting him to 'picnic' in her attic. They hit it off, but in apparent denial of her sexual potency, Camille then has her hair cropped, \"mani\u00e8re de petit gar\u00e7on\".\nPhilibert's sexual orientation at this time in the movie is also not delineated.\nCamille becomes bedridden, severely ill with the flu. Although Philibert has had only the one social contact with her, and having no reason to know how unwell she is, he feels protective towards, and worried about her. He enters her attic despite not getting any reply, finds her in a desperately weakened state, and carries her down to his apartment. When she recovers, he assumes she will stay on. This development is very unwelcome to Franck, who is permanently stressed-out by his work and destresses by drinking, playing angry punk rock, and entertaining women. The only outlet for his humanity is his care and concern towards his grandmother. Many heated arguments pass between Camille and Franck, the latter annoyed at her presence and the former finding him rude and disrespectful. This reaches a crisis when, whilst drunkenly directing an erotic dance by his latest nana, he refuses to turn down the music. Camille storms out and throws his boom-box out of the window. She later rectifies the situation by buying him a replacement stereo. Franck attempts to explain his behaviour, but acknowledges he is difficult, and that he finds her presence an irritant.\nThe turning point comes when, determined to return to her tiny attic, Camille cannot find the key. Franck tells her that he has it in his pocket but refuses to give it back. He says it is he who should leave, asking that she stay with Philibert, who is decidedly happier and more eager to interact with others when she is around. He says he will definitely leave unless she stays.\nMeanwhile, Philibert has joined a comedy club with encouragement from a woman to whom he has recently taken a very strong liking. Initially, people laugh at his stutter, however he takes classes and discovers that it disappears when he performs. Philibert later gives a show for the public, demonstrating considerable comic talent, at the start of which he proposes to his girlfriend on stage.\nAfter a few months in respite care, Paulette is eager to return home, however she is too fragile to live alone. Camille, who has become close with the old woman, convinces Franck to let her live at Philibert's apartment, where she will quit her unsatisfactory job in order look after Paulette. Initially hesitant, Franck agrees and his grandmother moves in.\nAround the same time Franck and Camille, whose relationship turned a corner after the incident with the stereo, enter a period of flirting. However, when this evolves into a sexual relationship, Camille sets the rule of not falling in love. Franck is visibly upset and withdraws emotionally from Camille, as he has already fallen in love with her.\nPaulette later returns to her home for a week, with Camille resident to help out. However almost immediately she passes away, exactly as she wanted, in her beloved home. At the same time, Philibert's apartment is sold by his great-aunt and the trio break up. Camille, realising she is in love with Franck, tries to contact him, in spite of his remaining withdrawn.\nAfter she waits for him outside his restaurant, they go out for a drink where Franck reveals he is moving to England at the end of the week. Camille suggests that he should stay in France, and buy a restaurant where they had eaten for her birthday, so he could be his own boss. Franck, sick of her tiptoeing around the central issue, asks her why she doesn't just ask him to stay (implicitly, because she loves him) to which Camille replies that she's afraid.\nLater that week, Camille arrives just in time to say goodbye to Franck. Finally she is able to beg him to stay, but he replies that he has already left in his mind. Heartbroken, Camille walks out of the train station where she receives a call from Franck. He tells her he's worried that she is walking all alone, crying and lost. He pretends to be passing through customs, but in reality, unbeknownst to Camille, he has instead followed her. She denies his concerns and pretends to be OK. He shoulder-taps her and calls her bluff. The two kiss passionately, happy to be together again.\nThe film ends with Franck working at his restaurant, which is evidently highly popular. Franck's demeanour is entirely changed; he is no longer gruff and stressed, but personable and generous of himself. Camille, Philibert and his wife all work there as well. When Franck sees Camille admiring a baby, someone jokes about when it's her time to be a mother.

In parallel, he has managed to romance a local Muslim girl who is pregnant with his child. However, in the late stages of her pregnancy, she is killed by the Bosnian Serb forces when they overrun her village. Upon seeing the carnage, Simon vows revenge on the Bosnian Serb political leader Dragoslav Bogdanovi\u0107 \u2014known as \"The Fox\".\nReporting on the gruesome event later that day in a live remote link-up, Simon loses his composure at the network anchor Franklin Harris' suggestion that the Serb attack may have been a reaction to Muslim provocation attacks from inside the village. As a result of his on-air meltdown, Simon's journalistic career takes a tumble. While his professional prospects spiral downhill, those of his long-time camera man Duck go in the opposite direction. Duck gets a cushy job at the network, while Hunt is left following war after war, as a freelancer, in an attempt to get back on the US network television map.\nIn fall 2000, Duck, now a professional, travels to Sarajevo to a \"puff piece\" of the network anchor Franklin Harris covering the fifth anniversary of the Dayton Agreement, along with the fresh-out-of-Harvard young journalist, and son of the network vice-president, Benjamin. Duck runs into his old buddy Simon. Once a US network star reporter, Simon is, by this point, a desperate half-drunk cynic reduced to filing freelance reports for underfunded news outlets in places like Jamaica and Poland.\nAll the while, Simon's looking for a story big enough to propel him back to the realm of credibility. He tells Duck that, through a source, he has located Bogdanovi\u0107, who is now wanted for war crimes with a US$5 million bounty on his head, and that he'd be interested in trying to score an interview with the fugitive. The Fox is assumed to be in the village of \u010celebi\u0107i, in the Serbian entity of Bosnia, near the border with Montenegro, with various stories circulating about him, such as that he enjoys fox hunting (hence the nickname) and that the head of his security detail is a ruthless psychopath with a tattooed forehead.\nConvinced by Simon, Duck comes along to shoot the interview, with Benjamin in tow. On the way, Simon confesses his plan to capture the Fox to collect the bounty \u2014 something Duck and Benjamin consider insane even to think about. Along the way, the group is mistaken for a CIA hit squad by several groups, including the United Nations police force and the Serbs themselves; at one point, at the initiative of Benjamin, they claim to be CIA agents themselves, using a threat to avoid paying a fee for a tip. Still, Boris, the local area UN commander, puts them in touch with a woman claiming to have been romantically involved with the Fox's main bodyguard Sr\u0111an.\nSimon, Duck, and Benjamin are then captured by the Fox's guards and taken to a barn to be executed where axe-wielding Sr\u0111an \u2014 who has the phrase \"\u0443\u043c\u0440\u043e \u043f\u0440\u0435 \u0440\u043e\u0452\u0435\u045a\u0430\" (\"died before birth\") tattooed on his forehead in Cyrillic alphabet \u2014 is preparing to kill them through torture. At the last moment, a team of CIA assassins, tipped off by Boris, storms the barn and frees the journalists, but Fox escapes. It quickly becomes evident to the journalists that, even in the international community, there are people who do not wish the Fox to be captured.\nThe CIA orders the journalists to board an airplane bound for the US, but they run away to carry out their plan to catch the Fox. They capture him while he is hunting in the woods without his guards. The journalists then release him, with his hands securely bound, in a village called Polje filled with the surviving family members of victims of his war crimes, where he is lynched by the vengeful mob.\nAs the film ends, before the closing credits, the screen goes to black and the following message is shown:\nIn theory, the official hunt for war criminals in Bosnia continues to this day...However, the two most wanted men \u2014 Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107 and Ratko Mladi\u0107, continue to elude the U.S, The United Nations, The European Union, NATO, The Hague and all in the civilized world who claim to be looking for them.

Experiencing an epiphany from the incident, Larry tries to increase his life insurance policy. He finds out that a lapse in the paperwork after his wife's death keeps him from naming his children as primary beneficiaries. The representative from the insurance company suggests that Larry find a new spouse so he can name that person as his beneficiary. However, there is no woman in Larry's life that he loves or trusts.\nInspired by a newspaper article about domestic partnerships, Larry asks Chuck to enter a civil union with him. Although Chuck declines at first, he is reminded of his debt to Larry and finally agrees, entering a domestic partnership and becoming Larry's primary beneficiary in the event of his death. To their dismay, however, investigators arrive to inquire about their abrupt partnership, suspecting fraud (it is also pointed out this was not the first time such a plan was attempted against the insurance company).

Terrien\u2019s determination to remain detached, professional and controlled despite the atrocities that occur around him, including the torture, abuse and summary execution of Algerian prisoners, quickly gains him the initial contempt of Sergeant Dougnac (Albert Dupontel) his combat-hardened and cynical platoon sergeant, who has come to the conclusion that the level of violence employed by the Fellaghas can only be countered by equally brutal measures applied by the French.\nThe blooding of the young Lieutenant and the way in which he reacts to his newfound knowledge and experience provides the dramatic arc of L\u2019Ennemi intime. Terrien\u2019s idealistic view of French involvement in Algeria is summed up during a conversation with Captain Berthaut (Marc Barb\u00e9), an intelligence officer, when Terrien argues that as metropolitan French citizens the Algerians should enjoy the same political rights as any other French citizen and states that \"You can\u2019t fight barbarism with barbarism\".  Berthaut, identified as a former member of the French Resistance who was tortured by the Gestapo, a veteran of the French Indochina War and an old comrade-in-arms of Dougnac, disagrees and later in the film, states that, \"At 110 volts the truth always comes out\". Berthaut is killed and mutilated during a Fellaghist ambush as he attempts to evacuate a wounded soldier out of the \u2018Forbidden Zone\u2019 by jeep. Later, French soldiers (Terrien among them) retaliate by massacring and burning an entire village. In view of such atrocities, Terrien slowly begins to change his view.\nDougnac, identified within the film as a veteran of French Indochina, is a complicated character who is not averse to resorting to torture and barbarism when it comes to dealing with insurgents yet is capable, professional and increasingly privately respectful of Terrien as an officer and as a man. Their professional differences and the harsh realities of operations in the field, however, drive the two men to breaking point with Dougnac finding release through alcohol and at least one instance of self-inflicted torture. Such are the pressures on Dougnac that he finally snaps and deserts the army.

During this investigation, Luddie calls Ben, worried about Yorish's behavior. Driscoll and Galeano also find that people who had brain-affecting illnesses, such as encephalitis or ADEM, are immune to the spore because their previous illnesses prevent the spore from \"latching on\" to the brain matter. Oliver is immune to the spore because of the ADEM he had as a young child. Carol decides to get her son, who might show a way to a cure, back from Tucker. Before she drives to Tucker's house, she joins Ben's team who is called to the house of the Belicecs, the Czech ambassador and his wife, in a case of emergency.

Courtney works with a more mainstream feminist organization and disagrees with the C(i)A's method of creating awareness through public art, which usually involves vandalism.\nThe group travels to take part in a gay marriage protest \u2013 instead of being for or against it, they argue that marriage is the wrong goal, as it is an institution rooted in sexism. Despite being warned by another member of the C(i)A, Meat, that Sadie uses people, Anna shares a night of passion with her while they stay in a hotel. At the rally the next day, the outspoken Shulamith ends up nearly coming to blows with a protester. The fight is caught by a local news crew and the group's message is misconstrued as violent and homophobic. Meat also reveals that their website \u2013 which they considered the center of their activism \u2013 has not received hits from anyone besides themselves.\nC(i)A attempts to have a meeting at Courtney's home, but personal conflicts come to a head. Anna believes Sadie is going to leave Courtney to be with her, but Sadie remains dependent on her partner. Meat and Shulamith announce that they're giving up on the group, Sadie stays behind with Courtney, and Aggie (a transgender man who's part of the C(i)A) comforts Anna, who is heartbroken over Sadie's rejection and the loss of the C(i)A. They end up partying together and having a one-night stand. In the morning, Aggie has prepared breakfast and procured a flower for Anna, who only considers him a friend. Sadie arrives to talk about what happened the night before. Anna tries to explain that her night with Aggie meant nothing. He overhears and is deeply hurt. Sadie leaves and Anna finds herself truly alone.\nIn an attempt to fix things, Anna formulates a master plan to get C(i)A national attention. Meat and Shulamith like her idea, but insist she must make things right with Aggie. Anna apologizes, Aggie forgives her, and the four carry out the plan, without Sadie.\nAnna attends her sister's wedding, bringing joy to her family, but leaves early to execute her part of the plan \u2013 sneaking into the studio of a popular talk show with Aggie and Meat. Courtney is appearing on the show to argue about the appropriateness of a celebration over the (arbitrary) anniversary of the construction of the Washington Monument, which she feels is a distraction from real issues. When the host requests a live shot of the monument, the C(i)A feeds their footage in. With the expert help of one of Shulamith's lovers, Calvin (who was discharged from the military for being a lesbian under Don't Ask Don't Tell), and Meat's prowess with sculpture, a giant phallus has been erected atop the Washington Monument and is blown off with explosives. Back at the studio, Aggie pulls the fire alarm and the group escapes.\nIn the getaway car waiting for Anna, she is surprised to see Sadie, who has finally broken it off with Courtney. Sadie apologizes for her behavior, and the two agree to just be friends, but then kiss. Through text in the epilogue, it is revealed that Shulamith and Calvin volunteered to take the fall for the explosion, and received a reduced sentence because no one was hurt. Aggie started hormone therapy, started a new feminist group for men and got a girlfriend. Meat's sculpture appearing on TV launched her art career. Courtney took the talk show host, Marcy, out to dinner after fleeing the building together. Marcy subsequently left her husband to move in with Courtney.

As a child, Jack Brooks witnesses his sister, mother and father attacked and killed by a forest troll during a camping trip, with Jack forced to run and hide to avoid the same fate. This leaves now-adult Jack with an extremely short fuse and uncontrolled anger issues that frustrate his psychotherapist and alienates Jack's impatient and irritable girlfriend Eve with whom he attends night school taught by Professor Crowley. Jack is constantly late to class and only attends the end of a lesson where Crowley demonstrates a chemical reaction of Sodium metal in water, which causes a small explosion with just a tiny piece cut off of a larger block.\nWorking as a plumber, Jack is propositioned by Professor Crowley to help him clear an obstruction in the pipes of his newly purchased home, which fails to yield results and injures Jack, but also unearths something buried in the backyard of the house. Jack leaves to order a replacement part, while Professor Crowley becomes possessed by some unknown force and spends the night digging in the backyard with his bare hands. Upon awakening in the morning with no memory of the night's events, Crowley gives in to morbid curiosity and uses a shovel to dig up a large box found to contain human bones and what looks like an intact heart.\nJack encounters and old man, Howard, working at the hardware store while ordering the spare part, who warns him of the dangers of that old 'cursed' house, asking Jack to return the next day when the part will arrive and promising to reveal the story behind his cryptic warning. Meanwhile Professor Crowley discovers the heart to still be beating, only to have it force its way into his  mouth and down his throat. Awakening after the shock, he hungrily devours the meat in his refrigerator and shows up to class disheveled, dismissing the class after incoherently attempting to communicate, vomiting, and declaring himself to be starving. Returning home, he runs out of meat and instead kills and eats his pet dog.\nJack returns to the hardware store and Howard tells him the story of his childhood living in Crowley's house decades ago with his uncle Emmet, a collector of antiquities and how the heart had come into his possession, a trophy from a legendary battle against a real-life monster. Like Crowley, Emmet succumbed to its possession and consumed the heart, slowly turning him into a savage lunatic who, after eating his dog, bites off young Howard's hand and forcing the boy to shoot him in self-defense. Burying his uncle, but remarking that he could hear the heart still beating, he warns Jack that no good will come of going near the house. Jack, despite his own experience with monsters, ignores him and goes to class for the night.\nAfter Jack flirts with another classmate, and becomes jealous of the attention another student is giving Eve, Jack and Eve are about to end their relationship just before class when Professor Crowley, more swollen and disheveled than ever, finally fully transforms into a monster, with tentacles bursting from his back and capturing almost every classmate of theirs, while Jack and Eve help an injured classmate out of the classroom and barricade themselves in a different one down the hall. Crowley, now monstrously enlarged and deformed, turns several of their classmates into troll-like monster thralls by injecting them with a flood of black liquid via a proboscis-like tongue that emerges from his mouth, and dispatches them to hunt down the escapees, as his primary body is immobile.\nJack and Eve fail to save their injured classmate and a janitor when the monstrous minions, who are superhumanly strong, attack them. Using the monsters' feeding upon the victims as a distraction to escape the school, the two flee in Jack's van, but after the radio plays the song his parents had been dancing to on the fateful night of their deaths, Jack realizes he cannot run away again, having felt helpless as a child and not being able to forgive himself for being powerless to do anything to save his family, seeing this as his chance to do something about the monsters that have haunted him all his life. Kicking the uncooperative Eve out of the van, he returns to the school armed with his plumbing tools.\nTaking out two of the monsters without injury, Jack is bitten by a third but defeats it, collecting a fire axe from an emergency box on the wall along the way to confronting Crowley in the classroom, after defeating a final minion. Unable to get close enough to attack due to Crowley's tentacles, Jack grabs the container with the entire block of Sodium metal from Crowley's lesson days before and throws it into Crowley's mouth, blowing Crowley's head off.

He discovers the gunman's clothes buried beneath the area where the body was found, and they show evidence of a gunshot wound. Later, Jesse questions the security guard; based on the body's wounds, he was thought to have accidentally shot Rebecca during the robbery. The guard repeats that he shot the robber, not the clerk.\nMeanwhile, Luther awakens suddenly from his coma. After effects include his having acquired \"cop-ly intuition\". Jesse is troubled by loose ends in the Lewis case, particularly the small amount of money the bank claimed as stolen. He talks to Hasty Hathaway, knowing his background in money laundering, and asks if the $24,000 claimed stolen was the actual bank losses. Hasty reveals that the amount was closer to $2 million, but much was hidden in a money laundering scheme by Boston mobster Gino Fish. Hasty tells Gino that Jesse is on the case. Interested in getting his money back, Gino has Terrance Genest follow Jesse.\nJesse also investigates the case of eighteen-year-old Cathleen Holton, who alleges she was raped by the older Harrison Pendleton, on board his yacht.

Under questioning, Leeann says her earnings from working in real estate has funded her mother's hospice care. They have more talks and appear attracted to each other. Meanwhile, Luther's cop-ly intuition leads him to get a background check on Leeann; he learns her landlady reported her missing on the day of the robbery, and she worked as a waitress.

She admits to being Rebecca and says that she discovered a money laundering operation at the bank, with large amounts of money unaccounted for. She and her sister planned to steal this illegal money, with her sister posing as a male bank robber who would take her hostage. But, the guard shot Leeann. By the time the sisters reached the site where they planned to drop the disguise and escape, Leeann died.

Two years later, her mother suffered a stroke the day after the body of Leeann was discovered. Rebecca moved back to Massachusetts to care for her mother, while posing as Leeann. Jesse leaves her to care for her mother.\nBack in Boston, Jesse tells Gino that the woman who stole his money from the bank used most of it taking care of her sick mother.

Years roll by, and Prabhakar grows into a young man who develops an interest in Tamil, his favourite teacher's subject.\nAfter completing 12th grade, Prabhakar hears about the death of his beloved teacher Poobal, in an accident and travels to have one last look at him. There he sees Anandhi, his childhood sweetheart, whose father has also died in the same accident, in an argument with another family for having one look at her father's body. Prabhakar enters into a fistfight and ensures that justice is done. This incident nurtures the love between Prabhakar and Anandhi. They meet regularly thence. Prabhakar joins college where his preference for taking up Tamil is ridiculed by his roommate and a few others. Anandhi's mother does not object to her daughter's love for Prabhakar as she sees him as a source of financial support. At one point, she sells his motorcycle for her expenses. Prabhakar does not mind it. After a few years, Anandhi and her mother are forced to relocate to Anandhi's uncle's house in north India due to monetary difficulties. Prabhakar initially loses contact with her but traces her back to her uncle's home.\nSomehow, Anandhi finds Prabhakar and they share a poignant moment in her uncle's home where Prabhakar asks about her health, to which Anandhi asks about the time of his departure. Prabhakar buys some clothes for her and leaves her promising that he will keep in touch. After a few mail communications, Prabhakar again loses contact with her.\nMeanwhile, Prabhakar gets a job as a Tamil teacher and starts living in a lodge. He manages with a meager salary and loses focus in his personal life.

It is after this incident that the encounter with a police inspector happens where they arrest Prabhakar for smoking in public. Prabhakar is released and he tries to commit suicide, albeit unsuccessfully. The police again get hold of him and try to book him on false charges.

In September 1939, following the Soviet invasion of Eastern Poland, he is taken prisoner by the Red Army, which separates the officers from the enlisted men, who are allowed to return home, while the officers are held. His wife Anna (Maja Ostaszewska) and daughter Weronika, nicknamed \"Nika\" (Wiktoria G\u0105siewska), find him shortly before he is deported to the USSR. Presented with an opportunity to escape, he refuses on the basis of his oath of loyalty to the Polish military.\nHelped by a sympathetic Soviet officer, Anna manages to return to the family's home in Krakow with her daughter. There, the Germans carry out Sonderaktion Krakau, shutting down Jagiellonian University and deporting professors to concentration camps. Andrzej's father is one of the professors deported; later, his wife gets a message that he died in a camp in 1941.\nIn a prisoner of war camp, Andrzej is detained for a while and continues to keep a diary. He carefully records the names of all his fellow officers who are removed from the camp, and the dates on which they are taken. During the winter, Andrzej is clearly suffering in the low temperature, and his colleague Jerzy (Andrzej Chyra) lends him an extra sweater. As it happens, the sweater has Jerzy's name written on it. Finally, Andrzej's is taken from the camp, while Jerzy is left behind.\nIn 1943, the population of Krakow is informed by the German occupation authorities about the Katyn massacre. Capitalizing on the Soviet crime, Nazi propaganda publishes lists with the names of the victims exhumed in mass graves behind the advancing German troops. Andrzej's name is not on the list, giving his wife and daughter hope.\nAfter the war, Jerzy, who has survived, has enlisted in the People's Army of Poland (LWP), which is under the complete control of the pro-Soviet Polish United Worker's Party. He feels personal loyalty to his friends, loves his country, and has sympathy for those who have suffered. He visits Anna and her daughter to tell them that Andrzej is dead. Apparently, when the list of the names of the victims was compiled, Andrzej was misidentified as Jerzy on the basis of the name in the sweater that Jerzy had lent to Andrzej; it was Andrzej who was killed, not Jerzy. Despondent that he is now forced to acknowledge a lie and to serve those who killed his comrades in Katyn, Jerzy commits suicide.\nEvidence of Soviet responsibility for the Katyn massacre is carefully concealed by the authorities. However, a few daring people working with the effects of the victims eventually deliver Andrzej's diary to his widow Anna. The diary clearly shows the date in 1940 when he must have been killed from the absence of entries on subsequent days. The date of the massacre is crucial for assigning responsibility: if it happened in 1940, the USSR controlled the territory, while by mid-1941 the Germans took control over it.\nThe film ends with a re-enactment of parts of the massacre, as several of the principal characters are executed along with other soldiers.\nThe film includes excerpts from German newsreels presenting the Katyn massacre as a Soviet crime, and excerpts from Soviet newsreels presenting the massacre as a German crime.", "tmdb_plot": "On September 1st, 1939, Nazi Germany invades Poland, unleashing World War II.

The somewhat shy Justin has a crush on Jennifer, who is giving her a Garbage Pail Kid card in exchange for her Smurfette figurine. His rival, obnoxious rich kid Kip Unger, shows up and gives her an expensive necklace. Justin and the Funky Fresh Boyz start the show, with his parents, Marty and Sylvia cheering for him. In an effort to impress Jen and win the contest, Justin uses a dangerous and untested headspin maneuver, which results in him flipping off the stage and falling into a coma.\nTwenty years later, Justin is still comatose. Dr. Cameron Frye tells Marty and Sylvia that at this point, there is little sign that Justin will recover, and they decide to pull the plug. As his parents say goodbye and leave, however, a janitor rolls by with a radio playing the same song from the 1986 talent competition, \"Rockit\" by Herbie Hancock. It jars Justin's brain to function, waking him. As a result, Justin now finds himself suddenly 31 years old, going on 32. In addition, his parents were bankrupt from overdue life support payments. Jen, who has become a girls' dance instructor, is engaged to Kip. Kip is now an obnoxious promoter, and is set to host a breakdance contest broadcast on national television, with a grand prize of $100,000.

Leavitt is tied up inside a complex.\nWhile Sykes and Haytham watch the entrance to the complex, al-Ghazi, Fleury, and Mayes follow a blood trail and kill many gunmen inside. Mayes, separated from the others, finds Leavitt and his attackers, preparing an execution video of Leavitt. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. Fleury then realizes there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment. After they enter, Mayes comforts a girl in the apartment and offers her candy. In return, the girl offers Mayes a marble, similar to those embedded in the bodies of some bombing victims. Al-Ghazi sees the grandfather, reaches out with his hand, and offers to help him stand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the same fingers as Abu Hamza al-Masri in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his suspicion that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and shoots al-Ghazi in the neck, then he starts to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham kills him. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandchild hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.\nAt al-Ghazi's house, Fleury and Haytham meet his family. Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend, mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie wherein he comforted Special Agent Manner's son. Fleury and his team return to the United States, where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace for their outstanding work. Leavitt asked Fleury and Mayes what he had whispered to her to calm her down earlier in the film. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own son what his grandfather whispered to him as he was dying. The grandson tells his mother, \"Don't fear them, my child. We are going to kill them all,\" a similar line to what Fleury had whispered to Mayes.", "tmdb_plot": "A team of U.S. government agents is sent to investigate the bombing of an American facility in the Middle East.", "tmdb_id": "4349", "wiki_id": "5875034"}, {"title": "Kings", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "In the mid-1970s a group of young men leave the Connemara Gaeltacht, bound for London and filled with ambition for a better life.

Amir's best friend Hassan is the son of Baba's longtime servant, Ali. Amir participates in kite fighting, and Hassan serves as Amir's spool-holder and \"kite runner\". Hassan has a preternatural ability to predict where loose kites will land as well as deadly aim with his slingshot, and on Hassan's birthday, Amir gifts Hassan a slingshot made in the United States.\nAmir enters the citywide kite-fighting contest, where he breaks his father's record of 14 \"kills\", and Hassan sprints off to \"run\" for the last defeated kite. After some time, Amir goes to look for Hassan, and finds him trapped in a dead end by Assef and his gang. Assef demands Amir's kite as a payment for letting Hassan go but Hassan refuses, asserting that the kite rightfully belongs to Amir. Assef then beats and rapes Hassan in retaliation. Amir watches unseen, unable to help Hassan and too afraid to intervene. He is wracked with guilt over the next few weeks and avoids Hassan, who privately teaches himself to read and write. Ali and Baba question Amir on Hassan's strange behavior, but Amir feigns ignorance. Amir asks his father if he has ever considered replacing Ali and Hassan, in response to which Baba angrily rebukes Amir.\nBaba then throws a party for Amir's 11th birthday, but Amir, still upset by what happened to Hassan, cannot enjoy it. The next day, Amir plants his new wristwatch, a birthday present from his father, under Hassan's pillow, and tells everyone that Hassan stole it. Hassan is confronted by Baba, and instead of professing innocence, he takes the blame. Although Hassan is quickly forgiven, Ali tells Baba that he and his son can no longer work for him and are leaving immediately, much to Baba's distress.\nIn June 1979, the Soviet Union militarily intervenes. Baba leaves his house in the care of Rahim and flees to Pakistan with his son and other refugees across the border on an oil truck. Amir is frightened by their circumstances. Baba comforts Amir by having him recite poems.\nIn Fremont, California in 1988, Baba runs a service station and operates a stall at a weekly flea market.

One day, at the flea market, Baba introduces him to General Taheri, a Pashtun who is a former officer in the Afghan army. Amir meets Taheri's daughter, Soraya, whom he finds attractive. Later, Amir gives Soraya a copy of one of his stories, but the General confiscates it.\nSoon after, Baba is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. Amir asks his father to ask General Taheri\u2019s for Amir to marry Soraya and Taheri gives his consent, but on a chaperoned stroll, Soraya tells Amir that when the Taheris  lived in Virginia, she had run away with a Pashtun man and lived with him until her father came to retrieve her. Soon after, the Taheris moved to California to escape the gossip about this. Amir is shocked by Soraya\u2019s revelation, but still pledges his love, and they marry. Baba dies soon afterward.\nThe story then returns to the phone call in 2000: Rahim persuades Amir to visit him in Pakistan, offering him an opportunity to make amends. In Peshawar, Rahim, who is dying, tells Amir that he had asked Hassan to return, which he did-with his wife and his son Sohrab. Later, Rahim had fled to Pakistan and had left the home to Hassan and his family. Meanwhile, after the civil war, the Taliban had taken power. When the Taliban demanded that Hassan vacate the home, and Hassan refused, the Taliban had murdered him and his wife and Sohrab had been taken to an orphanage. After telling Amir of these events, Rahim urges Amir to return to Kabul to find Sohrab and give him a letter written by Hassan, who had taught himself to read and write. Amir declines until Rahim reveals that Amir and Hassan are biological half-brothers: Amir's father had had an affair with Ali's wife and had fathered Hassan.\nAmir travels to a Kabul orphanage to seek Sohrab but learns that he had been taken away by a Taliban official. Amir arranges to get an appointment at the Taliban official's house, where he is surprised to find that the official's assistant is actually Assef, who recognizes Amir immediately. Assef introduces Sohrab as his dance boy and begins to beat Amir as payback for having let Sohrab leave. In the confusion, Sohrab pulls out the same slingshot that Amir had given to Hassan long ago and shoots Assef in the eye. Sohrab and an injured Amir then flee to Peshawar, where they find that Rahim has died, leaving behind a letter for Amir.\nBack in San Francisco, Amir introduces Sohrab to Soraya, and the couple welcomes Sohrab into their home.

On the day before Romulus' coronation, Odoacer, commander of the barbarian Goths allied with Rome, demands a third of Italy from Orestes, but is rebuffed.

Vortgyn confronts Igraine outside the village and makes her tell the village to surrender Romulus, killing the village blacksmith's family in a show of force. When Igraine tells the villagers of what has happened, Aurelius confesses that Romulus is the Roman emperor. The blacksmith demands revenge for his family, and Aurelius and his men decide to lead an army to Hadrian's Wall to face Vortgyn's armies in a final battle.\nBefore leaving the village, Igraine gives Romulus a suit of Roman armour which belonged to her brother, which he has since outgrown. At Hadrian's Wall, Aurelius, wielding Caesar's sword, leads his men and a group of Celtic warriors against Vortgyn's forces.

A narrator starts the plot  off with a story about an abandoned house in Puebla, which is haunted by a malevolent force known as \u201cLa Nahuala.\u201d 52 years ago, it was the home of the affluent Villavicencio family, who were holding a feast for family and friends for the Day of the Dead. Unbeknownst to them, they were being haunted by a malignant nahuatl who wanted to become all powerful. It killed and possessed the cook's body, turning the woman into La Nahuala, a witchly host, and initiated a ritual to take over. La Nahuala ends up killing the Villavicencio family by poisoning their soups and murders the rest of the household.-Among those killed are the Villavicencio\u2019s young daughter Teodora and Teodora\u2019s servant Xochitl as ritual sacrifices, but before La Nahuala could finish her final victim she was \"stopped.\u201d However, her soul and the souls of all the people she killed are trapped in the abandoned house - and it is said she still awaits for a child to come near the manor at night so she can finally complete the ritual.\nThe story ends as it is revealed to have been told by a mischievous boy named Nando San Juan, who told the story to his nervous and cowardly younger brother Leo San Juan, whom he enjoys teasing. Just as Nando scares Leo, the two boys are herded to mass by their grandmother and their nanny. Leo (who serves as altar boy) can't stop thinking of the legend of La Nahuala during the service and his trembling causes a series of accidents that disturb mass and humiliate Friar Godofredo, the Franciscan monk who officiates mass. Despite the mess, Friar Godofredo only gently reprimands Leo and soothes his fears by assuring him that La Nahuala is dead. Friar Godofredo then shows him his hot air balloon, promising to take Leo on a ride once the balloon is ready to fly.\nDuring the festivities, Leo is shunned by two children in front of the seemingly kindly Santos' candy stand for his stuttering and for peeing when he's afraid (a fact Nando has been spreading). Santos assures Leo that the Villavicencio house isn't haunted - he says Leo should confront his fears by going into the house, and gifts him with a golden medallion: the Medallion of Miquitzli, which he claims keeps fear at bay. Before the two part, Santos gives Leo a brief show of the fireworks he has just acquired. Back at home, Leo's good mood is ruined when his nanny Dionisia gives him a large order of bread to be delivered to a Se\u00f1or Machorro (later revealed to be Santos) at number ten Nahuala street, the very street where the abandoned Villavicencio house stands. Leo makes it to the front of the abandoned house, where Nando unexpectedly jumps out and frightens him; the shock makes Leo pee himself and drop the bread. Adding insult to injury, Nando steals the medallion of Miquitzli from Leo and dodges into the Villavicencio house, pretending to be caught by La Nahuala to further humiliate Leo. As Leo sadly walks away, the medallion begins to glow, and Leo turns in time to see a ghostly hand burst from the house and drag a screaming Nando inside.\nLeo goes to Friar Godofredo for help. The elderly friar reveals to him the real story of La Nahuala: 52 years ago, a young Friar Godofredo and a Nahua shaman joined forces to hunt the nahuatl when they caught wind of the appearance of La Nahuala in the Villavicencio house. The two men led a mob to the house, where La Nahuala prepared to consume the souls of Teodora, Xochitl, and Teodora's friend, To\u00f1ita San Juan, who is revealed to be Leo and Nando's own grandmother. The party arrived too late to save Xochitl and Teodora, but To\u00f1ita resisted, ripping the medallion of Miquitzli from La Nahuala's neck and upsetting the ritual as Friar Godofredo and the shaman fought the witch. Although the ritual's failure stopped La Nahuala from gaining immortality and power, her spirit took over the house, leaving the friar and the shaman no choice but to seal the house and evacuate To\u00f1ita and the cook's young son, the only two survivors. Friar Godofredo warns that he must destroy the medallion before the night is over or La Nahuala will come back to life, prompting Leo to run back into the Villavicencio house. Friar Godofredo tries to run after him and is overcome by exhaustion. When he runs into Santos and attempts to enlist his help, the candymaker instead knocks Fray Godofredo unconscious.\nInside the house, Leo runs into various frightening sights including two living sugar skulls, finally running into the ghost of Xochitl. The girl offers him her help, explaining that La Nahuala will enslave the dead and feed on the souls of all the living in Puebla if she can conclude the ritual (apparently using Nando's soul as a replacement). The house itself seems resolved to kill Leo with living knives, lava-spewing pots and other apparitions. They also run into trouble from the cursed skeletons of the Villavicencios and their guests, who are starved and want to eat Leo. After escaping them, they run into the ghost of Teodora: though friendly to Xochitl, she is stuck up and spoiled. Leo has to trick her into opening the door to the next area of the house by convincing Teodora that her hairbrush is on the other side of a locked door she initially refuses to open.\nElsewhere, Santos threatens Fray Godofredo. He reveals that he is aware of the medallion's power and orchestrated the night's events, as he was the young boy that was rescued from the Villavicencio house 52 years before: the son of the cook La Nahuala possessed. He is resentful of Friar Godofredo for sealing his mother away and manipulated Leo into entering in hopes of finally being with his mother again. Before he can hurt him, however, Friar Godofredo escapes. At the San Juan Bakery, To\u00f1ita finds her grandsons missing and rushes to the abandoned house with Dionisia when she concludes it must be La Nahuala's doing.\nBack at the abandoned house, the approach of midnight increases La Nahuala's powers. She makes Teodora and Xochitl succumb to her influence and confronts Leo, letting him choose between staying and leaving. She releases nightmarish apparitions on him when he insists he will stay to rescue his brother. The chase leads Leo to the house's library, where he meets a dragon alebrije and the Don Quijote-like ghost Don Andr\u00e9s. The Alebrije (who presents himself as the Library Alebrije) reveals that La Nahuala can take any shape she wishes and puts Leo through a series of tests to make sure he isn't the evil spirit. When the boy passes all three, Alebrije concludes that Leo is not La Nahuala, but rather a boy singled out by destiny. Alebrije then shows Leo a vision of a warrior using a black skull to destroy something (referred to as 'the evil') inside the medallion to destroy the spirit.\nLeo runs into the house's chapel, where he is captured by La Nahuala. She reveals that it was Leo's soul she wanted for the ritual, and had used Nando as bait. Though his grandmother, and then Friar Godofredo, attempt to stop them, Santos knocks the old woman unconscious and fiercely battles Fray Godofredo to allow La Nahuala to complete the ritual. After La Nahuala's spell rebounds on them by way of Friar Godofredo using the skull of Tezcatlipoca's mirror, Santos begs his mother for help with his wounds. To his horror, La Nahuala finally reveals she isn't Santos's mother, but that she consumed his mother's soul and has chosen to look like her to keep Santos in her service. Betrayed and regretful, Santos sacrifices himself to allow Leo to escape. With Nando's help, and under directions from a dying Friar Godofredo, Leo uses the black skull of Tezcatlipoca to confuse La Nahuala, then hurls the skull on the evil that emerges from the medallion of Miquitzli. Once it's destroyed, a defeated Nahuala turns to stone.\nBefore he passes on, Friar Godofredo bequeaths Leo his crucifix and declares himself at peace in the knowledge that Leo remains to defend Puebla. Freed from La Nahuala's influence, Teodora and Xochitl also move on (but not before kissing Leo's cheek in gratitude). A regretful Santos is collected by the spirit of his real mother, who forgives him for his trespasses. Santos rejuvenates into a ten year old boy as he ascends to heaven hand in hand with his mother. Before the night ends, Leo gently ridicules Nando for peeing himself in terror after the two sugar skulls (who reveal themselves to be on Leo's side) sneak up on him.\nA year later on the feast of the Day of the Dead, the San Juan Bakery is visited by a crowd of spirits: Santos, the Villavicencio family, Xochitl, Teodora, Don Andr\u00e9s and even Fray Godofredo. The ghostly friar also relays a message to Leo: he must travel to Xochimilco, which is besieged by La Llorona.

Tong buys Mew a present, deciding to give it to Mew piece by piece in a game similar to a treasure hunt. One by one, Mew finds all of the pieces except for the last one which is hidden in a tree that is cut down just as Mew is about to retrieve it. Tong is disappointed at their misfortune, but Mew remains grateful for Tong's efforts and gift.\nTong's parents are unable to contact Tang in Chiang Mai, and go there to look for her. Tong, devastated that his sister is missing, cries and Mew tries to comfort him. Tong's parents are unable to find Tang, and believing she is dead, the family decides to move to Bangkok. Six years later, Tong's father Korn is a severe alcoholic, due to his guilt for losing his daughter. Tong has a pretty\u2014but uptight\u2014girlfriend, Donut. Tong and Mew are reunited during their senior year of high school at Siam Square. The musically talented Mew is the lead singer of a boy band called August. The meeting stirs up old feelings that Mew has harbored since boyhood. The manager of Mew's band, Aod, says they must write a song about love in order to sell more records. He assigns them a new assistant manager, June, who coincidentally looks identical to Tong's missing sister. When Tong eventually meets her, he and his mother, Sunee, devise to a plan to hire June to pretend she is Tang, in hopes that it will pull Korn out of his alcoholic depression. Mew is also the object of an unrequited crush from a neighbour girl, Ying, but he is more interested in his boyhood friend Tong, who has become his inspiration for writing the new love song.\nAs part of the deception with \"Tang\", a backyard party is held in honor of her return, and Mew's band provides the entertainment. Singing the new love song for the first time in public, Mew's eyes lock intensely with Tong's. After the party, the two boys share a prolonged kiss. Unseen, Sunee accidentally witnesses their kiss. The next day, she firmly commands Mew to stay away from her son. Mew is heartbroken and loses his musical inspiration, so he quits the band. Korn's alcoholism leads to a liver condition which sends him to a hospital. June questions the effectiveness of the \"Tang\" ruse, noting that Korn has not reduced his alcohol consumption and she leaves. After she leaves, Korn starts eating more and begins taking his liver medication.\nAt Christmas time, as Tong and his mother are decorating their Christmas tree, she accepts his sexuality by allowing him to choose a male ornament over a female one. Tong goes to Siam Square for a date with Donut. Mew has rejoined the band, and they are playing nearby. Tong abandons Donut and rushes to see Mew sing and is guided there by Ying, who has accepted the fact that Mew loves Tong. After the performance, Tong gives Mew his Christmas gift, the missing nose from the wooden doll that Tong gave him when they were children. Tong then tells Mew, \"I can't be your boyfriend, but that doesn't mean I don't love you.\"", "tmdb_plot": "Two young boys are best friends living quiet family lives in Bangkok.

Karl tries a trick where he is buried in sand for a day.\nUpon learning that Harry has not told Linda of what happened to his wife, Karl informs her. Harry panics when he discovers that her hotel room is vacant, believing she has returned to London. He conquers his fear of flying to immediately fly back to London, only to discover as soon as he gets there that she has merely switched rooms and forgotten to inform him. Managing to return to Jersey in time to compete by telling Linda to make one of the judges delay the act, both Harry and Karl make it through to the final; Linda claims that she is okay with hearing about what happened to Carol, but tensions between both begin to grow as she struggles to trust him. The night of the finale, Harry is heartbroken to learn that Linda has apparently slept with another magician, the sleazy and unethical Tony White; although Linda confirms it, she is lying in an attempt to force Harry to open up about his feelings, which he is still unable to do. Karl, meanwhile, finally prepares to consummate his relationship with Dani, but admits that he is not a true psychic after she thinks he is contacting her dead father, and betrayed, she shuns him.\nThat night, Karl and Harry have a confrontation backstage, in which Karl accuses Harry of murdering Carol; Harry angrily rejects the accusation and challenges that Karl merely finds it easier to believe that rather than accept the guilt of betraying his best friend. On stage, Karl begins to pioneer his psychic act, but the stooge he has hired in the crowd which he had chosen with a fake random ball toss, accidentally trips and concusses himself on the stage. Upon hearing the sad story of another selected audience member, he decides that he cannot perpetuate the fraud, admitting to the audience that he is not able to contact the dead. As a result, Dani forgives him. Harry, as 'The Black Widower', starts his guillotine act, but at the moment of truth Linda's nerve fails her and she flees the stage. Although Harry\u2019s act would appear to be ruined when he asks if anybody else wants to try, Karl steps forward and announces that he will face the guillotine instead. Karl allows himself to be locked in the guillotine, explaining that Carol was frequently unfaithful and forced him to have sex with her (but was unable to achieve an erection when Harry had caught them). Harry appears to decapitate Karl \u2013 although it is merely an illusion, and Karl appears unharmed, the trick having worked perfectly. Harry wins the competition, and in his acceptance speech both forgives Karl and admits that he loves Linda, who joins him on stage and the two kiss.

His colleagues show up to give him an impromptu farewell party: Harry, a biologist; Edith, an art history professor and devout Christian; Dan, an anthropologist; Sandy, a historian who is in (unrequited) love with John; Art, an archaeologist; and his younger student Linda.\nAs John's colleagues press him to explain the reason for his departure, he picks up from a reference to Magdalenian cultures by Dan and slowly, and somewhat reluctantly, reveals that he was born in the Paleolithic period. He states that he has lived for more than 14 millennia, and that he relocates every ten years to keep others from realizing that he does not age. He begins his tale under the guise of a possible science-fiction story, but eventually stops speaking in hypotheticals and begins answering questions from a first-person perspective. His colleagues refuse to believe his story but accept it as a working hypothesis in order to glean his true intentions. John relates he was a Sumerian for 2000 years, later a Babylonian, and eventually went east to become a disciple of the Buddha. He claims to have had a chance to sail with Columbus (admitting that at the time he still believed the earth was flat) and to have befriended Van Gogh (one of whose original paintings he apparently owns, a gift from the artist himself).\nIn the course of the conversation, each guest questions John's story based on knowledge from their own academic specialty. Harry struggles with how biology could allow for the possibility of a human being living for so long. Art, arguably the most skeptical of the group, questions prehistory. He exclaims that John's answers, although correct, could have come from any textbook; John rejoins that, like any human, his memory is imperfect and he only sees events from his own narrow, hence not omniscient, perspective. Dr. Will Gruber, a psychiatry professor who arrives at Art's request later that afternoon, questions if John feels guilt for outliving everyone he has ever known and loved. He then threatens John with a gun (later revealed to have been unloaded) before temporarily leaving.  John then learns from Harry that Will's wife had died the previous day after a long illness.  John chases after Will, expresses his condolences and John rejoins the group.\nThe discussion veers to religion, and John mentions that he does not follow any. Even though he does not necessarily believe in an omnipotent God, he does not discount the possibility of such a being's existence. Pressed by the group, John reluctantly reveals that in trying to take the Buddha's teachings to the west, into the eastern Roman Empire, he became the inspiration for the Jesus story. After this revelation, emotions in the room run high. Edith (the representative \"true believer\" of the group) begins crying. Will, who has returned after saying he drove around and didn\u2019t know where else to go, demands that John end his tale and give the group a sense of closure by admitting it was all a hoax. He threatens to have John involuntarily committed for psychiatric evaluation should he refuse to do so. John appears to ruminate over his response before finally \"confessing\" to everyone that his story was a prank.\nJohn's friends leave the party with various reactions: Edith is relieved; Harry indicates an open mind; Art never wants to see John again; Will still believes John needs professional help; Sandy and Linda clearly believe John; Dan is heavily implied to believe John. After everyone else but Will and Sandy have left, Will overhears John and Sandy's conversation, which suggests the story could be true after all. John mentions some of the pseudonyms he has used over the years, and Will realizes one was his father's name. He asks John questions that only a very close acquaintance could answer. When John answers them correctly, Will has an emotional breakdown, suffers a heart attack, and dies in John\u2019s arms.

One night while in his viewing tower at the port's rail terminus, Maloin witnesses a fight on the dockside. One of the shady combatants is knocked into the water along with the briefcase he carries; when the other flees the dark quayside, Maloin makes a clandestine descent from the tower and retrieves the briefcase, which he finds full of sodden English banknotes. Maloin conceals the money and tells no-one of what he has seen. The next morning, he visits a tavern where he plays chess with the barkeep (Gyula Pauer). On his way home, he stops by the butcher's where his daughter works, and finds to his indignation that they have her washing the floor. Later, from the window of his apartment, he notices Brown (J\u00e1nos Derzsi) watching him from below. At dinner, Maloin is increasingly irascible, addressing Henriette brusquely and arguing with Cam\u00e9lia.

Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the \u00a355,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that the money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door.

He brings her to the tavern for a drink, where he overhears the barkeep telling another patron the story of Brown's meeting with the inspector, revealing that Morrison had called the local police when Brown absconded. Though Henriette refuses her drink, Maloin buys her an expensive mink stole. They return home to the consternation of Cam\u00e9lia, who cannot comprehend why Maloin has ruined Henriette's chances of a job and spent what little savings the family had on the extravagant stole. During Maloin's shift the next night he is visited by Morrison, who questions him as to the previous night's events as the body of the drowned man is retrieved from the quayside below.\nThe next day at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under suspicion for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell anyone, and leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily.

In the morning, his mother, Rose, finds him sleepwalking in the woods in front of their house. A cast taken at the next victim's scene points to a tiger as the hermit's killer, so Sheriff Barnes holds a press conference to warn the public. The Bengal tiger revisits Roy's home that night.\nA tabloid paper offers a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing hunters and reporters to inundate the town. The sheriff forbids anyone from going into the woods and hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman, he sees Roy in the woods.

The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay out before taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.\nSix National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser, as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham, an experienced big game hunter and tracker from England. Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance and that he will start his hunt for the tiger when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the tiger, it kills one, Timmons, silently. Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt, the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate, and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position to headquarters. She finds that the tiger attacked the two guardsmen, with one killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt blowing the patrol car horn, she runs back to the car, but the tiger has already killed him.\nMeanwhile, Roy encounters Graham in the woods. When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the tiger, Graham tells him that he must because it cannot choose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people.

The narrator is Satyaveer Singh Randhawa, a down-on-his-luck public works engineer. He compares Lakhot \u2013 dry, desolate and despondent \u2013 to the general downturn in his own life. As he returns to his irritable and nagging wife Nimmi and their young son, we learn that Satyaveer has just been implicated in a small bribery scandal at work. Nimmi broods over how she wishes she had married a richer fellow. Satyaveer, an aspiring writer whose only novel Manorama sank without a trace, laments about how he had once wished to be famous but is now resigned to a banal and unremarkable existence.\nThey have an unusual visitor that night. A well dressed, affluent woman presents herself as Mrs. P. P. Rathore, the wife of the Irrigation Minister (and former Maharaja) P. P. Rathore (Kulbhushan Kharbanda). She says she is a big fan of Satyaveer's novel. Captivated by the ingenuity of the detective Raghu, the principal character of the novel, she hopes to secure Satyaveer's assistance in applying the same ingenuity to procure photographic evidence of her husband's affair. She pays him an advance and leaves.\nSatyaveer accepts the job in spite of Nimmi's reproach. He stealthily stakes out Rathore's manor. He spots another woman visiting Rathore. Rathore rebukes the woman and turns her away. Satyaveer snaps a few pictures of this exchange and hands over the roll to Mrs. Rathore. He also confides in his brother-in-law and best friend, the loutish but generally well-meaning local cop Brij Mohan. Brij finds this all very fishy and advises Satyaveer to take Nimmi on a short vacation.\nStrange events happen to Satyaveer. He finds out that the woman who hired him is not Mrs. Rathore; the real Mrs. Late one evening, as Satyaveer returns home after drinks with Brij, he spots the same woman running for her life from people who are out to kill her. She earnestly urges him to remember her real name, Manorama, and that she is 32 years old. The next day's papers report that Manorama committed suicide in connection with her protests against a canal being built through Lakhot. The canal project is sponsored by Rathore.\nHe decides to investigate further. He finds out that Manorama was connected with a local children's home and lived with a roommate, Sheetal. The roommate is confused and scared. She refuses to talk with Satyaveer. Satyaveer is later set upon by thugs; they turn out to be the same men who chased Manorama on the night of her death, and they want to find out what she told him that night. Satyaveer tells them what was told to him after getting his two fingers broken and his motorbike is stolen. Satyaveer later uncovers that Manorama's death was an accident; she was hit by a truck as she fled her pursuers.\nSheetal calls him. She is still scared but somehow warms to him and asks if she can stay with him for a few days. Seeing as Nimmi has returned to Rohtak (her parents\u2019 house) for Diwali, Satyaveer agrees. Sheetal moves in for a little while. Around this time, Satyaveer attends a rally function with Rathore in attendance. He follows Rathore and discovers that Rathore receives regular medication from a doctor for an unknown ailment. He also spots the woman who visited him on the night Satyaveer took the photos.\nHe follows the woman and makes contact with her. She lives with the doctor Anil Poddar. She turns out to be Sameera Rathore, the illegitimate daughter of Rathore. She was trying to get Rathore to accept her as a daughter. Satyaveer begins piecing the parts together. However, when Satyaveer visits the doctor, he finds that the doctor and Sameera have both been brutally murdered. There he and Sheetal discuss what to do next and they almost kiss but his wife calls him and he takes her call immediately remembering his marriage. He runs to the children's home where he discovers that Sheetal has actually been dead for around 8\u201310 days.\nArriving home, he finds that the woman masquerading as Sheetal is neither surprised nor scared. She blames him for the act she had to up (as Sheetal), and she directs him to meet Rathore. Rathore demands the photos. Satyaveer turns over the photos he had taken. Not surprisingly, Rathore is not the least bit interested in photos of him having an argument with his biological daughter. It turns out that Neetu (the girl pretending to be Sheetal) is a concubine for Rathore. Rathore now openly threatens him and asks that he hand over those photos. Satyaveer returns home. He scans one of the photos he had taken and suddenly finds a clue in it. This clue leads him to what Manorama had said to him on the night she died. The clue was that Manorama from his book died at page 32. He uses the clues to land up in the room of a small hotel in town, where he discovers a shocking set of photos in a packet cached behind the light switchboard.\nSatyaveer returns to confront Rathore. He presents the shocking evidence he has found. Rathore was a pedophile. The children's home was his steady supply of (orphaned) children. The real Sheetal and Manorama, who worked at the orphanage, had realized his wicked activities. They were about to blow his cover and hence he had them silenced. Rathore calmly informs Satyaveer that Satyaveer, smart though he may be, is still a small-town man that may easily be dispensed with. He then has Neetu harass him sexually which makes Satyaveer come out of disgust and he sees the goons dismantling his scooter. Satyaveer then comes back and reveals another fact. The doctor, Anil Potdar and Manorama were siblings. Also, though the doctor knew that Rathore had lung cancer, he kept concealing the fact from him and kept giving him placebos merely to suppress the symptoms of cancer. The doctor and Manorama merely wanted to keep him alive long enough for him to accept Sameera as his daughter and heir. Then, on Rathore's eventual death, the estate would come to Sameera and thus also to the doctor and Manorama. It was now too late since cancer had reached an advanced stage and Rathore had precious little time left to live. Hearing this Rathore's wife laughs with great relief.\nAs Satyaveer is walking out, one of the goons, who is asthmatic, starts choking on a peanut, but he continues walking by carefree.

While taking the scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen.

Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of his robotic bowler hat named Doris, steals the scanner.\nWilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis demands proof that Wilbur is telling the truth. Wilbur does so by taking them in a second time machine to the year 2037, which is highly advanced technologically. When they arrive, Lewis realizes he can simply use the time machine to meet his mother; the resulting argument makes them crash. Wilbur asks Lewis to fix the time machine, and Lewis agrees on the condition that Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage.

Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum.\nUnfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son, Paul. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest, Father Milesi (Tommaso Banfi) gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \"Mater Lachrymarum\". Michael is observed by a pair of witches while leaving the hospital.\nBack in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder and violence engulfs the city. Sarah continues her own research only to be summoned by Michael to his apartment. The witches have kidnapped his young son and won't return the boy to him unless he stops his investigation. Sarah begs him to call the police (who are tailing Sarah, ever since the murder at the museum) but Michael refuses to and instead opts to visit a local priest who is a trained exorcist. This goes badly for Michael; the two witches see him and he is soon captured and murdered, along with his son, whose body is cannibalized by the rapidly expanding coven. However, before he is killed, Michael calls Sarah and begs for her to come and help him. As she makes her way through a crowded train station, Sarah is spotted by a gang of witches who, like so many other witches, have arrived in Rome in order to pledge their loyalty to Mater Lachrymarum. Pursued by the witches and the police, the disembodied voice from before instructs Sarah on how to magically make herself invisible. She uses this to avoid a police detective, though she is forced to kill a witch, Katerina, who catches and corners her on the train.\nAt the priest's home, Sarah meets Marta, a fellow white witch and friend of Sarah's deceased mother. Realizing that Sarah's mother is the voice guiding her, Marta reveals details to Sarah about her parents. Her mother was a powerful white witch who dared to challenge and severely wound Mater Suspiriorum, the eldest and wisest of the Three Mothers. In response to this, Suspiriorum caused the fatal car crash that killed Sarah's parents. Though Mater Suspiriorum and her sister Mater Tenebrarum are now dead, their sibling Mater Lachrymarum has emerged from the shadows to bring about the second age of magic, with the fall of Rome as her coming-out party. They talk to the priest, only for him to be killed by one of his patients before he can give the two a copy of a book that would explain Mater Lachrymarum's backstory.\nEscaping back to the city, Sarah goes to her own home but finds Mater Lachrymarum's goons waiting for her. She heads to Marta's house, but once again Mater Lachrymarum's minions strike and Marta and her lesbian lover are murdered. Fleeing, Sarah spots Michael, who takes her back to his apartment. Unfortunately, Sarah soon realizes that Michael is dead and that Mater Lachrymarum is animating his body in an attempt to kill her. As she burns her lover's still-animate body, the ghost of her mother intervenes one final time to grab Michael and banish him (and possibly herself) to Hell.\nSarah locates a powerful alchemist, whom Marta mentioned as her only hope to learn how to fight Mater Lachrymarum. After being briefly paralyzed by the alchemist (so that he could perform a test on her to see if she was a white witch or an evil witch), the alchemist gives Sarah the only help he has in locating Mater Lachrymarum's dwelling. Sarah is given a copy of \"The Three Mothers\" to read, and from this (and from following a group of witches) Sarah finds Mater Lachrymarum's lair; a now run-down and disrepaired mansion. At this point, she is joined by Detective Enzo Marki, one of the police officers hunting her, and the two go into the catacombs to find Mater Lachrymarum. However, the two become separated, and Enzo is tortured alongside the alchemist and his assistant, who dies after his arm is chopped off by one of Mater Lachrymarum's minions. Sarah is caught and brought before Mater Lachrymarum, who offers Sarah up to her cannibal followers. Sarah, having healed Enzo's wounds, uses a spear to pull the cloak off Mater Lachrymarum and tosses it into a nearby fire. This causes the mansion to collapse as a pillar falls and impales Mater Lachrymarum. With the Mother's followers crushed as the cave collapses, Sarah and Enzo laugh in horror and shock upon reaching the surface, as they realize that the threat of the Three Mothers has been defeated once and for all.", "tmdb_plot": "An ancient urn is found in a cemetery outside Rome.

The art students, in costume, include Paul (a gothic vampire), Macon (a werewolf), Sky (a zombie cheerleader), Lexi (Pris from Blade Runner), and Bill (a Baseball Fury from The Warriors).  They intend to commit a murder as a piece of artwork to impress Alexander, their wealthy and sinister patron, in the hopes that they will receive a large arts grant from him. Chris has brought along a loaf of pumpkin raisin bread, which Sky starts to eat. She then reveals that she is allergic to non-organic raisins, falls over, hits her head and dies. The group hides the body out of embarrassment\nAlexander arrives to the Murder Party with a friend, Zycho (who is unknown to the group), and his dog, Hellhammer, who is claimed to be part dingo. Alexander reveals that Zycho is his drug dealer. Each member of the Murder Party then gives their input on how they will commit the murder. Drugs and alcohol fuel the group as they decide to wait for the witching hour, at which time they will all stab Chris in unison. While Macon leaves to pick up some pizza, Alexander has sex with Lexi and then later with Paul. Macon arrives back to see the two having sex and begins binge drinking and ends up covering himself in alcohol in the process. He later accidentally sets himself on fire which only Chris notices. Paul, a photography artist, begins taking pictures of Chris and is frustrated that no one will assist him.\nAs the group grow bored, they decide to play truth or dare using Sodium Pentothal (\"truth serum\") and divulge their most inner secrets. All eventually take a shot from the same needle, except for Alexander, who injects his shot into a slice of pizza. Each reveals mostly trivial truths about their lives and attempt to force Alexander to confirm that he indeed does have grant money to give. Bill, who has mostly kept to himself, discovers that the group make fun of him and plan on kicking him out, but only because his work is so much better than theirs. Macon confesses his long time love for Lexi and recounts a story of when they were in high school and ate a popsicle together on a water tower. Macon shows he kept the leftover popsicle stick as a token but is rebuffed by Lexi. Alexander sends Zycho out to get him some crank.\nFrustrated with not having anyone to assist in his photographs, Paul calls his professional assistant to aid him. The group is not happy as the assistant is not aware of the murder party. An argument breaks out and Paul injects Alexander with a dose of truth serum. The group ask him about the grant again and discover Alexander is actually a fraud: He is a fry cook who plans on killing the group, stealing their art and selling it as he assumes it will be worth more. Lexi discovers Macon on fire and she and the assistant extinguish him. Zycho returns with a bag of crank and Alexander immediately tells Zycho to kill everyone. Paul is shot in the head but doesn't realize and seems to only be annoyed that someone interrupted his shot. The assistant is also shot in the head and Zycho attacks Lexi. Macon, badly burned yet still alive, gets his chainsaw and uses it to attack Zycho; brutally killing him and passing out shortly afterward.\nLexi immediately begins to untie Chris, but Bill, who has now completely snapped, decides everyone has to die and kills Lexi with an axe.

Bruce meets Jeff, who kidnaps Campbell and takes him to Gold Lick in hopes that his hero can save the town from Guan Di.

Maddin decides that the only possible escape would be to \"film my way out\", thus motivating the creation of the \"docu-fantasia\" already underway.\nMaddin then describes Winnipeg in general terms, introducing it to the viewer, noting primarily its location at the junction of the Red and Assiniboine rivers, a place known as \"the Forks\". Maddin equates this Y-like junction to a woman's groin and associates it with his mother. Maddin also notes the apocryphal aboriginal myth of a secret \"Forks beneath the Forks\", an underground river system below the aboveground river system \u2013the superimposition of these two sets of rivers has imbued the site and Winnipeg itself with magical/magnetic/sexual energy. Maddin also notes that Winnipeg is the geographical centre of North America, and thus these secret rivers are \"the Heart of the Heart\" of the continent and of Canada. Maddin regales the viewer with one of the film's many suspect historical \"facts\" about Winnipeg: \"the Canadian Pacific Railway used to sponsor an annual treasure hunt [that] required our citizens to wander our city in a day-long combing of the streets and neighbourhoods. First prize was a one-way ticket on the next train out of town.\" No winners in a hundred years could bring themselves to leave the city after coming to know the city so closely over the course of the treasure hunt. Maddin then posits an alternative explanation for Winnipeggers never leaving Winnipeg: sleepiness. He notes that Winnipeg is the sleepwalking capital of the world, with ten times the normal rate of sleepwalking, and that everyone in Winnipeg carries around the keys to their former homes in case they return while asleep. Winnipeg by-laws require that sleepwalkers be allowed to sleep in their old homes by the new tenants.\nMaddin rents his own childhood home at 800 Ellice Avenue for a month, hiring actors to play his family (including Ann Savage as his mother) in order to recreate scenes from his childhood memories, excluding his father and himself. The \"family\" gathers to watch the television show LedgeMan, a fictional drama in which \"the same oversensitive man takes something said the wrong way, climbs out on a window ledge, and threatens to jump.\" His mother, in the next window, convinces him to live. Maddin's mother is noted as the star of the show. The film recounts the conditions of the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike, a real-world event with international significance, before returning to the family re-enactments, including Mother's suspicion of Janet Maddin, who hit a deer on the highway but is accused of covering up a sexual encounter. Maddin announces that this, like \"everything that happens in [Winnipeg] is a euphemism.\" The film then recounts the city's history of Spiritualism, including a visit by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1923. The film next examines Winnipeg architectural landmarks, including the Eaton's building and the Winnipeg Arena, both of which are demolished (while the arena is being destroyed, Maddin becomes the last person to urinate in its washroom). Maddin imagines the arena's salvation by the \"Black Tuesdays\", a fictional team of hockey heroes \"in their 70s, 80s, 90s and beyond\", then re-enacts a family scene where Mother is harassed to cook a meal.\nThe film recounts a racetrack fire that drove horses to perish in the Red River \u2013 the horse heads reappear, ghostly, each winter, frozen in the ice. Further Winnipeg landmarks, including the Golden Boy statue atop the provincial legislative building, the Paddle Wheel restaurant, the Hudson's Bay department store, and the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame, make appearances in distorted versions of themselves, as does the Sherbrook Pool. The film then recalls If Day (an actual historical event when a faked Nazi invasion of the city was mounted during World War II to promote the sale of war bonds), and a buffalo stampede set off by the mating of two gay bison. Time is now running out for Guy Maddin, who fears he will never leave Winnipeg, since the family re-enactments have failed to free him fully. To accomplish this feat of leaving, Maddin imagines a pinup girl for the 1919 strike's newsletter The Citizen: dreaming up this \"Citizen Girl\" allows Maddin to leave Winnipeg in her capable hands, guilt-free. The final family re-enactment then involves Maddin's brother Cameron, who in real life committed suicide, rationalizing this death calmly in a discussion with Maddin's \"Mother\".", "tmdb_plot": "The geographical dead center of North America and the beloved birthplace of Guy Maddin, Winnipeg, is the frosty and mysterious star of Maddin\u2019s film.

The police even trace his associate \"Napoleon\" who is actually Alex Thambidurai.

When the investigators fail to solve the mystery, the case is finally turned over to \nDIG Sharafuddeen Taramasi IPS, a Tamil Nadu cadre IPS officer and an encounter specialist from the Railway Anti-Criminal Task Force (RACT).\nRACT discovers that the three murders are not inter-connected, rather it was sheer coincidence that they all happened the same night. The passengers in the compartment during the inaugural journey apart from the three victims were an actress Priya Rose, her mother Rajamma  and father, four doctors returning from a medical conference, a Tamil Novelist Seetharaman, Palakkad Railway SP Alexander, Madhavan Master, his wife and their mentally unstable son Balachandran \"Balu\". TTR Muthuraj  and attender Sundareshan are also present.\nAs the train reaches Madukarai station, Balu is spotted with a blade in hand apparently after stabbing Nadiya who goes unconscious. Simultaneously Shreya goes missing only to be found dead later near Salem, and Thulasimani is found dead hanging on the roof of her coupe which was locked from the inside. The coach is removed from the train for investigation and SI Mayilvahanam  questions all of the passengers having no answer to either of the cases.\nUpon questioning Muthuraj, he reveals to Sharafuddeen about meeting an additional passenger that night, who is identified as Lakkidi Manikandan, a killer in disguise of a police constable. After severe questioning Mani admits killing Shreya, the reporter. She was behind Alexander IPS, who was highly indulged in smuggling. Shreya followed him into the train and into the compartment, to make a hot story about the goods he carried on board. However, Alexender overhears Shreya's mobile conversations, which makes him suspicious and discovers her identity card from her bag. He arranged Mani to kill her, and when the train reached near Salem, Shreya is thrown away from the moving train, which kills her.\nAfter getting Seetharaman's statement, Sharafuddeen questions Balu who was spotted first near a seemingly-dead Nadiya. It was Dr. Mathangi, one of the doctors in the compartment who spotted Balu with a surgical blade in hand and thereby informed all her co-passengers. Madhavan master spots that Nadiya is still alive and asks everyone to take her to the hospital. In the present-day Balu undergoes treatment at a mental asylum and in his subconscious mind, reveals to Sharafuddeen that he came out of his coupe that night to meet Priya who was his crush during college days, but sees a stabbed and injured Nadiya instead with the blade used to stab her left behind. As Balu took the blade in hand for checking, Mathangi sees him thereby leading to the rest of the events.\nWith the help of Mayilvahanam, Sharafuddeen apprehends Priya and her mother Rajamma who are indulged in smuggling of gold. The latter reveals that she had borrowed a surgical blade from the doctors to slice mangoes. When it is revealed that the same blade was used to stab Nadiya, Rajamma reveals that they have no connection with the murder. She also tells that during the journey, Priya inadvertently ran into Madhavan who is angry at her as well as her mother who are responsible for Balu's mental problems. And while looking for Madhavan, Rajamma spots someone entering Thulasimani's coupe but couldn't identify the person. However in an identification parade arranged by Sharafuddeen, Rajamma reveals that it was attender Sundareshan who entered the coupe that night. Upon being questioned, Sundaran reveals that he is the murderer. Since the reasons given by him are unconvincing, Sharafuddeen attempts to torture him that forces Sundaran to reveal the truth - he committed the murder of Thulasimani on the orders of his boss, the division manager Vijayabhanu. Vijaybhanu was the husband of Thulasi's sister and fell madly in love with Thulasi. He approached her numerous times but was rejected by Thulsi. She threatened to disclose the approaches of Vijayabhanu to everyone and also secretly married her boyfriend Makarand from Mangaluru, which provoked Vijayabhanu to kill her before she reached home.\nHowever the most complicated case was that of Nadiya. She appeared to be brutally assaulted with teeth marks on her body and nerves to her brains being cut. Sharafuddeen goes behind Nadiya and finds that she along with her identical twin sister Nadira were orphans, and their father was Zakriya Mether, a goon and arms dealer, who was killed by a special team led by Sharafuddeen while he was posted in the'Q' Branch of Tamil Nadu Police years ago. The sisters were raised by eminent dancer Janaki Iyer at her academy in Kanjikode. Nadira grew up to be a professional dancer, while Nadiya became an acclaimed shooter, holding a grudge against Sharaufuddeen for killing her father before her eyes. Their foster mother Janaki died, leaving all her properties to the twins, which was now managed by Aadilakshmi, their manager and her brother Lakshman. Nadira's marriage was fixed with internationally acclaimed musician Zia Musafir, son of Janaki's discipline and loyalist Ustad Ghulam Musafir. Ustad isn't happy with the investigation, and especially with the chief officer Sharafuddeen due to several reasons. While doctors confirmed that chances of Nadiya recovering from her coma are very less, Ustad even asks Nadira to sign consent paper for mercy killing of her sister, which she refuses.\nSharafuddeen and team reach their academy and question Aadilakshmi and Lakshman. When Nadira arrives, Sharafuddeen reveals in front of her that Aadilakshmi was always after Janaki Iyer's family wealth which is now entitled primarily to Nadiya, as Janaki Iyer had made Nadiya the heir to the majority her property, including her art academy and Nadira the heir to her art and dance legacy. Sharafuddeen also reveals that the train made a technical stop for two and a half hours at Coimbatore station. The reason why Nadiya didn't travel to her academy which is just 35 minutes from Coimbatore station is unclear. While in her room, someone attacks Nadira from behind, and she runs away after biting hard on the attacker's hand. Sharafuddeen warns Nadira that even her life is at risk now. He also speculates that the Ustaad might have planned to kill Nadiya, leaving Nadira as her sole beneficiary and heir, which would then give him access to Nadiya\u2019s inheritance post Nadira\u2019s marriage to his son. \nWhile the investigation continues, they discovered that Nadiya had called the Academy's phone number hours before being attacked. Connecting pieces, they find out that someone had used the Academy's official car and entered into Coimbatore station car park area. Upon following the evidences and tracing the path travelled by the car, the team reaches a pond in a rural area. Upon searching the pond thoroughly, they retrieve Nadiya's gun, ID proofs and other belongings. Sharafuddeen concludes that Lakshman attacked Nadiya, which Nadira opposes while talking to Sharafuddeen in private. Sharafudeen says that, if not Aadi Lakshmi's brother it has to be Zia Musafir who might have done this, by taking a break from his world tour, as he was not reportedly in Bahamas on the day Nadiya was stabbed and was in India as per Emigration records. Nadira refuses all claims and defends Zia. Sharafudden decides to take all the suspects and witnesses to Chennai to conduct a scientific Narco-analysis test along with Nadiya who is in a state of coma, by taking the same train.\nDuring the journey, seeing Nadira standing close to the door, Sharafuddeen confronts her. During the chat, Sharafuddeen reveals that amidst that engagement night, the academy's car was taken out and also reveals that it was Nadira who was in it. When Nadira disagrees with this, Sharafuddeen plays an audio evidence from Lakshman who spotted her that night. Finally Sharafuddeen reveals that she is indeed the one who stabbed her twin sister, which Nadira finally agrees. She says that she wanted to prevent Nadiya from selling the academy which was in her ownership.\nHowever, Sharafuddeen reveals one more shocking truth to the astonishment of 'Nadira' - that the one standing in front of him is Nadiya and not Nadira, thereby implying that the other girl unconsciously bound to a hospital bed is the real Nadira. Despite initially objecting to Sharafuddeen's claim, Nadiya's identity is revealed due to her characteristic trait of getting a nosebleed whenever she is angry or upset. Sharafuddeen says that right upon retrieving the real Nadiya's gun, passport and other belongings, the blood group specification in her passport deceived Nadiya's fake identity because Nadira's blood samples from the crime spot were of a different group. It is also revealed that it was Sudarshan, Sharafuddeen's assistant and right hand man who attacked Nadiya in the dark earlier, for the purpose of getting a teeth bite sample from her which matched the bite marks on Nadira's lips. Finally, Sharafuddeen says that he concluded the real killer's identity when Nadiya got a nosebleed upon hearing bad comments about Zia (which Sharafuddeen made purposefully).\nThe truth was that Nadiya - the shooter was deep in love with Zia, though he had affection only towards her identical twin sister Nadira - the dancer. Ustad and Janaki Iyer fixed the marriage without the consent of Nadiya and she was provoked to mad anger when Nadira boasted about Zia's love to her. She gets angry and decides to kill Nadira, by asking her to pick her up at Coimbatore Station. When Nadira arrived, Nadiya assaulted her and stabs behind her head to let her bleed to death. To appear as assault, she even creates teeth-bites on Nadira's body and carefully switches her dress with Nadira's. She swapped her identity as Nadira, making the real Nadira collapse into a coma state.\nSoon after her confession to Sharafuddeen, she jumps out of the moving train and hits hard on to a railway signal thereby killing herself, which makes it the real night of Nadiya\u2019s death.

Walter starts reading the book and notices striking similarities between himself and the main character, a detective named \"Fingerling\". Fingerling is obsessed with the 23 enigma, the idea that all incidents and events are directly connected to the number 23. Walter too becomes obsessed with the number and attempts to uncover the mystery of the book's author, but he can't find any information. Walter's son, Robin, is interested in the enigma too, but Agatha dismisses it as superstition.\nIn the book, Fingerling then discovers that his lover, Fabrizia, is having an affair, and he stabs her to death. The police arrest her lover because he found her body and picked up the murder weapon, assuming it was a type of sexual roleplay. Fingerling then prepares to commit suicide by jumping from a hotel balcony, and the book ends abruptly. Walter later learns of a murder victim named Laura Tollins, whose body was never found, and whose murder is similar to the death of Fabrizia in the book. Walter believes that the man who was sent to prison for her murder, Kyle Flinch, wrote the book. Walter visits Flinch in prison, but he denies killing Laura or writing the book.\nRobin discovers an address hidden in the book and they hope that it will lead them to the book's true author. When Walter confronts the man, Dr. Leary, he commits suicide by cutting his own throat. Before dying, Leary tells Agatha to go to a now-abandoned mental institution that he used to work at. At the institute, Agatha discovers a box that has Walter's name on it. Walter discovers a code in the book that tells the reader the location of Laura Tollins' body. Walter and Robin find the skeleton, but when they return with the police, the skeleton is missing. After seeing Agatha washing mud off her hands, she admits that she moved the skeleton. Walter angrily accuses her of being Topsy Kretts. However, Agatha tells Walter that he was really the one who wrote the book. \nAgatha shows Walter the box from the institute that has his name on it. Inside, Walter sees the sources he used to write the book, and he begins having flashes of repressed memories. In room 23 of the hotel in the book, Walter finds the missing final chapter of the book scribbled under the wallpaper. Long ago, he was obsessed with the 23 enigma because it drove his father to suicide. He was also involved with Laura Tollins, but she left him for Flinch, resulting in him stabbing her to death. After Flinch is sent to prison for the murder, Walter wrote the book in the room as an elaborate suicide note, changing the details of his confession into a deranged fantasy. Walter then jumped off the balcony, but he survived. The resulting brain damage left him with amnesia, and he was sent to the institute to recover, and met Agatha after being released. Dr. Leary, one of Walter's doctors, read the book and became obsessed with the number, eventually publishing the book under the name Topsy Kretts.\nAgatha arrives, and she tells Walter that he has changed, which is why she hid the skeleton. Convinced that he will kill again, Walter attempts to commit suicide by running into the path of a bus. However, Walter does not go through with it, not wanting his son to lose a father like he did, and Walter finally exclaims that 23 is just a number. Walter turns himself in to the police for the murder of Laura Tollins, and while awaiting sentencing, his lawyer tells him that the judge will go easy on him because he confessed.

Ocean offers Bank a chance to set things right, given his long history in Las Vegas and the fact that he \"shook Sinatra's hand\", but Bank refuses and completes construction of the hotel, renamed \"The Bank\". To avenge Tishkoff, Ocean gathers his crew and plans to ruin Bank on the opening night of the hotel.\nThe crew's plan has two objectives:\n\nPrevent The Bank from winning the prestigious Five Diamond Award, which all of his previous hotels have won. Saul Bloom acts as the anonymous Five Diamond reviewer, while the real one is treated horribly.\nRig all of the casino's games to pay out millions in winnings; Bank's casino has to make $500 million in the first quarter in order to stay open, otherwise he would have to cede control of the casino to the gaming board.While they can implement various rigging mechanisms into the casino, Danny and his crew would be stopped by the Greco, a state-of-the-art computer system that monitors the gamblers' biometric responses and detects cheating.\nTo disrupt the Greco, they plan to use a magnetron disguised as a cell phone as a gift to Bank. They also obtain the drilling machine used to bore the Channel Tunnel to simulate an earthquake under the casino, ensuring evacuation of the premises. Their plan on opening night is to have Bank inadvertently disrupt the Greco by using his new phone, initiate their rigged machines as well as dealers on their payroll, and then simulate the earthquake to force the evacuation so players leave with their winnings.\nShortly before opening night, the drill breaks down. The team is forced to ask Terry Benedict, their previous target, for funds to buy a replacement. He offers the funds for a portion of the take as he dislikes Bank, and demands they steal Bank's private diamond collection in celebration of his Five Diamond Awards. \nThe jewels are secured in a case at the top of the casino.

Secretly, Benedict contracts master thief Fran\u00e7ois \"The Night Fox\" Toulour to intercept the diamonds.\nOcean institutes the final part of the plan by having FBI agents on his payroll arrive at the hotel and arrest Livingston Dell on suspicion of rigging the card-shuffling machines, allowing them to be replaced with actual rigged ones. Another FBI agent arrests Linus for switching the diamonds with fakes. The agent takes Linus away and he turns out to be his father Robert, whom Ocean enlisted. \nTrying to evacuate from the roof, they are intercepted by Toulour. He takes the diamonds and parachutes off the roof after tricking Linus with an unloaded pistol. However, Ocean anticipated this and never had Linus make the switch. Linus and his father escape in a helicopter piloted by Basher, tearing the case of diamonds off the roof.\nThe earthquake is triggered and the players evacuate with millions of dollars in winnings. Ocean tells Bank he is the mastermind behind everything and that they did it for Reuben. He reminds him that he cannot get revenge, since Danny knows all of Bank's associates and they prefer him over Bank. He cannot go to the police either due to Bank's illegal activities. \nWith their share of the winnings, Ocean's crew buy property on the Strip for Reuben to build his own casino.

The two drive off in a fury in an effort to escape.\nRemembering a relative from early on in her childhood, Kerra plots a course for Leeds, Utah, a small LDS rich community in the southern part of the state.  Arriving at their aunt and uncle's house, the two concoct a story indicating that they are traveling across the country to meet up with their mother who had recently acquired a new place of employment.  With the stolen car having problems, the pair is unable to travel any further until it is fixed, and are offered a place to stay until repairs are completed.\nShortly after their arrival, Kerra is confronted by her cousins with stories from her early childhood days.  These stories recall \"strange noises\" in the woods behind their house and dealings with an \"imaginary\" being whom Kerra had termed to be \"Kid Donni.\"  One night after the siblings arrival, an earthquake shakes the area with the epicenter believed to be near the property of their Aunt Corrine and Uncle Drew.\nFollowing the quake, Kerra is reunited with her \"imaginary\" childhood friend Kiddoni, who is in reality a noted being from the Book of Mormon.  The earthquake is revealed to have caused a \"rift\" in time - allowing Kerra contact with the ancient Nephite peoples and their adversaries, and allowing Kiddoni and his people to cross the time gap into the modern world.\nAs the story progresses, the time portal gap expands and eventually allows the Nephite and  Gadianton armies to exit the past near the  Whitman's home.  Brock on the other hand is unaware of this time rift and eventually finds himself captured by the Gadianton armies.  It is at this time that he comes into contact with a scraggly-bearded individual from \"modern\" times named Chris.\nMeanwhile, during their escape from California, Brock had been given a bag by a former gang-member to take out of the area, which is later revealed to be a bag full of illegal drugs.  Upon realizing who was in possession of the bag, the gang leader decides to make a trip to the small Utah community to recover the bag.\nNear the end of the story the two worlds clash as the rift in time grows very large.  The Gadianton army crosses the time border into the present day in an effort to find food for their armies.  Through sheer coincidence Chris and Brock reunite with Kerra near the Whitman home, where it is revealed that Chris is the siblings father, who had disappeared during a hunting trip many years earlier.  A major Nephite-Gadianton battle eventually ensues near the Whitman home while the trio of family retreats into hiding.  Shortly thereafter, another quake hits the area and the division between the time periods is restored.  Kerra is heartbroken at not getting to say goodbye to her Nephite friend, but both families are happy that they were kept safe and that father and children were reunited again.", "tmdb_plot": "Two teens from L.A. make their way to Utah to hide with distant Mormon relatives from their troubled pasts.

Prabhu purchases a Bajaj Pulsar bike with the money. \nWhile his family initially berate him for buying the bike, he soon secures a job at a bank due to his bike, earning their respect. He forms an interminable attachment with his bike since it became his streak of luck, from getting a job to Hema eventually reciprocating his feelings. The bike eventually saves his life from a freak incident and gets lost during an outing with Hema, subjecting Prabhu to unfathomable anguish as he searches for his bike with his friends.

Later that night, Prabhu confesses to his family that his bike was stolen. His family is very upset, but Prabhu's father assures them that the bike will be found in no time, having developed a feeling of respect for Prabhu after he had become responsible by going for a job. The next morning, Ravi visits Prabhu's locality and threatens him to withdraw the complaint against the culprit. When Prabhu refuses, Ravi pushes Prabhu's father during the argument, which prompts Prabhu to hit Ravi. \nRavi's accomplices arrive at the scene, and Prabhu manages to fight them all, leaving Ravi beaten and embarrassed among the public.

Prabhu, along with Kumar, meets Selvam at his own residence in Kasimedu. Ravi is not home at that time. Prabhu tells the truth to Selvam, but the latter refuses to believe that Ravi and his men stole his bike. After hearing from his close ally Out, Selvam believes Prabhu, apologizing and promises Prabhu that he will do whatever he can to get his bike back, but it was too late for Prabhu's father, who receives the attack from Ravi's men. He was admitted in a hospital, and Prabhu breaks down after knowing that his father may never walk again after his right leg is paralysed by the attack. \nSelvam, Ravi, and their men visit Prabhu to condole and apologize for what happened this time. Prabhu turns down the apology, and again, an immediate fight is about to break between Prabhu and Ravi before Selvam separates them both, blaming Ravi for the ordeal caused.

Although he wants to stay away, Prabhu invariably gets dragged into rubbing shoulders, caused by Ravi's antics, who now targets his family to seek revenge. Prabhu's bike is caught by the NCB and they nab him, suspecting him of drug smuggling in his bike. They release him after Prabhu tells them that his bike was stolen and shows them his FIR copy, but he does not tell them about Ravi or Selvam. \nPrabhu learns that his bike was stolen by Selvam's men to escape from a murder scene, but it was Ravi who smuggled drugs in his bike's petrol tank.

Ravi accuses Selvam of being a non-caring brother, and Out intervenes and warns Ravi to mind his language. Surprisingly, Selvam himself comes in support of his brother to lash out at Out. \nOut separates briefly from Selvam after this conflict. The next day, Selvam and Ravi get attacked by unknown gangsters when they are traveling in their car outside the city. Selvam asks his brother to stay inside the car and handles the killers on his own. He gets brutally injured only to find out that he has been stabbed by his own brother Ravi.

The beating of the teen sparked outrage and further divided the historically segregated city of Halifax. Upon his release from prison, he is surprised by a hero's  'welcome home' party at his brother Keith Rose's (Greg Bryk) house and other members of the White community in Halifax. While at the party Donnie is confronted by the victim's father George Carvery (Danny Glover) who is holding a gun contemplating shooting Donnie to avenge the assault of his son. After a tense, heated exchange between George and Keith who is wielding a baseball bat, Donnie tells George \"Just do what you came here to do\". After contemplating for a few moments George returns to his car and drives back to his mostly African Nova Scotian North End Halifax- area home. At this time, we get the first glance at his family, his wife Ruth Carvery (Tonya Williams) and his mentally and physically challenged son Charles (K. C. Collins). The condition of Charles has an obvious strain on their marriage, as just the sight of Charles condition forces them to come to grips that he will never again lead a 'normal life'.\nThe release of Donnie from prison is much to the chagrin of members of the Black community in Halifax. Ossie Parris (Flex Alexander) a famous boxing champion challenges Donnie to a fight in the hopes of seeking retribution for the vicious attack that left Charles disabled, offer him $20,000 to participate in the prize fight. Knowing that Ossie will use the opportunity to murder Donnie in the ring, George offers to train Donnie in order from keeping him from being killed.

A fight at the club's entrance ensues with gunfire breaking out and a car being lit on fire (the scene is to resemble the Halifax race riot in 1991 in which over 150 Black and White clashed outside a downtown Halifax bar, after Black men were continually being denied entry in local bar establishments due to their race). Looking for further retribution Keith's crew burned down the Black community church. Members of Ossie's crew then kidnap and savagely beat Keith to death, leaving him at the same location where the beating of Charles took place years earlier. Donnie then goes to the Halifax Black Baptist Church during Sunday congregation to kill the culprits, but then leaves the church, instead deciding to turn in the suspects. Days before the fight Donnie and George meet at the same place where both their loved ones suffered brutal attacks, and they share a deep moment that put the film in perspective. George explains that he has a resenting hate in heart from all his years of struggle, and tells Donnie that he has the same hate in his heart and he must let it go. It is then that it was revealed that it was, in fact Keith that brutally beat Charles, and that he only confessed because he was a minor and would have served less time than his brother.\nOn fight night Donnie enters the ring to a chorus of boos from the crowd. The fight goes back and forth between both fighters landing decisive blows. With George and his family in attendance, Charles suffers an 'episode' and climbs in the ring, causing an already agitated crowd to throw chairs and enter the ring themselves.

Although Linda says she did. Linda throws Dr. Roth's number into the garbage. Suddenly, she realizes her days are unfolding out of order. She creates a calendar of events from what she remembers, and records Tuesday as the current day. Before Jim goes to bed she begs him not to go on the business trip.  She tells him, \"If tomorrow is Wednesday, please, wake me up before you leave. Promise me.\"  He does.\nLinda wakes up and sees that it's now Friday morning and her mom is there. She updates the calendar she had made.  She goes to see Claire who is visibly upset and tells Linda Jim was going to cheat on her.  Linda confides in her friend about what happened with Jim and Claire, and suggests he didn't do it, but it would be very damaging if he had. She visits their safe deposit box at the bank and finds the insurance policy.  The agent lets her know the finances should be in order, and he informs Linda that Jim came in two days earlier and tripled his insurance benefits.  She visits their priest, then visits the funeral home, telling the person she already knows who she is.  Linda returns home to her mother and daughters.  She tells her she made funeral arrangements already for Saturday. Linda asks her mom if she \"lets\" Jim die, is it the same as killing him? Her mother replies \"Jim is already dead\".\nNext day, Linda awakens and suggests Jim spend some time with the girls. Linda goes to the church and visits with their priest. He says its been a long time since he saw her. She tells him she is scared. The priest talks about other cases where people in history have had such premonitions.  He explains she needs to have faith and fight for it.  Linda drives out to mile marker 220 where Jim's accident was to see what may have happened. Jim and the girls return home to Linda. After dinner the girls go to say goodnight to their dad and Linda insists he tells them he loves them.  Linda pleads with Jim outside in the rain about their relationship and tells him they're running out of time. Lightning strikes a power line, and kills the crow which she found dead a different day. Later that night, she tells him she had a dream which he was going to die. He says it was only a dream. They spend the night together.\nLinda wakes up in her bed on Wednesday and reads a note from Jim saying he has taken the kids to school and he will be back tomorrow. She searches for Jim, and calls him but gets voicemail.  She goes out to look for him.  Jim is seen at the bank with the insurance agent. Linda shows up to the school and sees her kids are there already. Jim calls Claire who is at the hotel where they planned to meet and he tells her he can't go forward seeing her.  Next he calls the house and leaves the message from the beginning of the film. As Jim nears the site of the accident, Linda reaches him by cell phone and the two have a reconciliation after she tells him she knows about Claire. Linda tells Jim to turn the car around to avert the accident. This instead causes the accident with a fuel tanker truck, as Jim's car stalls in the middle of the road when performing the turn. The tanker jackknifes and crushes the car's roof while dragging it to within an inch of the mile marker. Both vehicles explode on impact and Jim burns to death.\nThe film's final scene is set a few months later. Linda recalls the priest's words about faith.

When the woman digs her shovel into what she believes is another grave, an unseen creature attacks and violently drags her into the river. The UN soldiers accompanying her fire into the water, but only her mangled corpse floats to the surface - before being devoured.\nIn a New York City newsroom, television journalist Tim Manfrey (Dominic Purcell) is assigned by his boss, Roger Sharpe (Patrick Lyster), to travel to Burundi with Aviva Masters (Brooke Langton), a reporter who deals with animal stories and has become interested in Gustave, a gigantic, fierce crocodile known to have killed hundreds of people in Africa over the years. With the killing of the anthropologist, Gustave is suddenly a story of interest to the world. Tim doesn't want to go, knowing that Burundi is a war zone, but he has little choice because one of his stories turns out to have been based on falsified evidence. Tim and Aviva are accompanied to Burundi by Tim's cameraman and friend, Steven Johnson (Orlando Jones), and herpetologist Matt Collins (Gideon Emery), who are intent on capturing Gustave alive.\nAt the airport in Bujumbura they are met by a government official Hahutu Mkwesa who goes by Harry (Dumisani Mbebe), who tries to delay their departure by warning them of unrest in the bush, caused by a dangerous warlord who has nicknamed himself \"Little Gustave.\" Tim manages to overrule Harry by faking a call to Roger, and the team departs the next day being accompanied by two soldiers. When the party reaches the village where the last attack occurred they meet their guide, a licensed hunter named Jacob (J\u00fcrgen Prochnow), and are blessed by the local shaman; the friendly villagers assemble a steel cage in order to capture Gustave and take the cage to a nearby swamp. The first attempt to capture Gustave, by placing a goat as bait, fails, but Matt manages to shoot a tracking dart into it.\nThe next day, Steven happens upon the shaman and his family being executed by men working for Little Gustave and films it. While the others debate airing the footage, \"Jojo\" (Gabriel Malema), a teenage villager who helped set up the cage, uses himself as live bait to capture Gustave. The beast arrives and tries to devour him, but disappears, as Tim, Matt, and Steven race to rescue him. Meanwhile, Aviva catches one of the soldier escorts stealing money from a tent. The soldier knocks her down and attempts to rape her, but Gustave arrives and kills him. Aviva escapes unharmed and catches up with the others. The remaining guard relays over his radio that the Americans videotaped the shaman's execution. Just as the group realizes that the soldiers work for Little Gustave, the remaining guard, believing Jacob videotaped the evidence, wounds him; Jojo intervenes, and shoots him. While Jacob's wound is being treated, Gustave attacks the group. Jacob recalls the story of how his wife, Ona, was killed by Gustave, and that he swore revenge. Jacob produces a grenade and detonates it as Gustave grabs him in his jaws and devours him, but the grenade fails to kill the crocodile.\nThe next day, a helicopter arrives to airlift the survivors, but a truck arrives with two of Little Gustave's men, who fire a rocket at the helicopter. The group ducks, except for Matt, who runs after the helicopter to stop it from flying away. Matt is rammed by the truck and shot to death by the younger of the two militia members, a teenager performing what is clearly his first execution. When the driver of the truck notices the rest of the group, Tim yells for them to split up. In the ensuing chase, both of Little Gustave's men are killed: when the truck crashes into the river, the teenager is thrown out and dies on impact, while the driver is shot by Aviva when he tries to strangle Tim.\nSteven stumbles upon Gustave and struggles to escape. While Aviva stays with the injured Jojo, Tim goes to look for Steven, but finds only his camera. As they are waiting for help, Tim remarks to Aviva that he now understands the shaman's earlier words that \"we make our own monsters.\" Matt had earlier told the group that crocodiles frequently feed on carrion, and there is no limit to how large they can grow, given enough sustenance; it is the bodies from the civil war, floating in the river, that have given Gustave a taste for human flesh, and allowed him to reach such a gargantuan size as the years go by.\nHarry arrives in a Range Rover, but Tim realizes that he is actually Little Gustave upon discovering the shaman's necklace in his possession. Little Gustave wants the video evidence of the shaman\u2019s execution. Tim attempts to trick Harry by giving him the GPS tracker linked to the dart on Gustave, saying it will locate the computer with the video. Harry forces Tim and Aviva to lead them to the \"computer.\" While Harry holds Aviva at gunpoint, Tim and one of Harry's men follow the tracking signal to Gustave's lair, where the crocodile is sleeping. Tim finds Steven's mutilated body, and a combat knife in the scattered human remains, and stabs the guard. At the same moment, Aviva splatters Harry with Matt's container of crocodile pheromones and runs. Gustave wakes up and smells the scent of the pheromones, ignoring Tim and Aviva in favor of devouring Harry.\nTim, Jojo and Aviva climb into the Range Rover, but Gustave attacks through the rear window. Tim stabs the crocodile in the mouth with a machete. Gustave roars in defeat as the others manage to escape. Weeks later, Tim, Aviva, Jojo, and Wiley receive medical treatment and fly back home to America, watching leftover footage of Steven on his camera.

Tom Canty (Dylan Sprouse) watches it on TV and imitates Eddie (he mimics him by saying his catchphrase \"Oh yeah!\"), when his grandpa, 'Pop' (Ed Lauter), calls him to get ready for school. At school, the principal asks what his ambition is in life, and Tom replies that he wants to be Eddie Tudor. The principal then advises him to join the acting classes (which Pop doesn't allow him to do). He has lived with Pop since his parents died a couple of years earlier. From a young age, Tom has wanted to become an actor, partly inspired by the stories of fame and appeal of acting conveyed to him by his neighbour and best friend, Miles (Vincent Spano). Miles is a former actor who has known Tom since quitting showbiz and moving to the area when Tom was a little. He often tells Tom about his life as a star, although not revealing much as to how he lost his fame. Now 14, the same age as Eddie Tudor whom he looks exactly like, he wishes that he really is Eddie and gets frustrated with his Pop's persistent pushing for Tom to forget about the acting, and telling him to do 'real work', like helping him with his business, when Tom is not at school. He says he only pushes Tom because he cares about him. Miles, however, supports Tom's acting ambition, but warns him that it is a tough business to get into and survive in.\nMeanwhile, Eddie Tudor is frustrated with his life and being told what to do all the time. He doesn\u2019t seem so interested in acting and can\u2019t understand why his single mom (Dedee Pfeiffer) pushes him so hard to stick at it. He longs for some freedom and to be able to be a normal kid. Not appreciating what he has, he constantly goofs off on set and unknown to him, he is about to be dropped from the production that they have recently started filming in Palm Beach, where Tom lives. When Tom hears about the production, he visits the lot where it is taking place, in the hope of meeting his idol, Eddie Tudor, and getting into the acting business. During a break from shooting, Tom (who sneaked onto the set and hid under a trailer) meets Eddie for the first time. Eddie, pleased to see another kid on set to hang out with, invites him into his trailer and the two talk and play Eddie's Xbox. Tom is thrilled to meet Eddie and see inside his trailer and be on a film set, also to play the Xbox, since Tom doesn\u2019t have one at his Pop's house. Eddie says that his mom doesn\u2019t care how much he plays the Xbox in his spare time, because she is so busy. Tom tells Eddie how lucky he is, in comparison to him, but he's a friend of the former actor, Milles. Eddie doesn\u2019t seem impressed by this, though, having never heard of Milles or other actors that Tom speaks about. Tom notices that Eddie doesn\u2019t seem to appear that interested in acting, choosing to concentrate mainly on his Xbox that he's playing. Tom then spots Eddie's suit which he wears on screen in the 'Spy Teen' films and asks Eddie if he can try it on. Eddie, still engrossed in the game, replies \"Sure, whatever\". Eddie takes notice however, when he sees Tom in his suit and hairstyle, and realises that he and Tom are identical in appearance. He then puts on Tom's clothes and changes his appearance, and they are stunned to see how much they look alike. The Assistant Director of the film Eddie's shooting then comes into the trailer and, realising that he now has a chance for a bit of freedom away from filming, Eddie (who now looks exactly like Tom) says \"Well, Eddie, it was great to meet you, but I best get going\", leaving a startled Tom in his place, who will now have to act just like Eddie.\nThe real Eddie meets Pop, who picked him up from the sidewalk that he was walking along. Thinking that he is Tom, Pop drives him home in his pick-up, lecturing him about why he should have come straight home from school. Eddie sees Tom's home and his bedroom, which has posters of Spy Teen and 'Miami Squad', which Milles starred in, on the wall. The next day he and Pop go to work (Pop runs a landscaping business and Tom sometimes helps him) where Eddie tells him that he's not Tom and explains what happened, realising that he's not having much fun or freedom planting trees with Pop, and a frustrated Pop starts thinking that 'Tom' has gone mad. Meanwhile, the real Tom realises that fame isn\u2019t everything it's portrayed to be as he has to cope with being ordered about by Eddie Tudor's mother and his agent and packing loads of filming and appearances into his day. At first, he faints with the shock of so quickly becoming Eddie and acting in a big movie, as he had for so long dreamed about. He is then accused of faking the faint by Eddie's agent and given a row by her and Eddie's mom for creating a fuss when they relocate to Miami, who dismiss his behavior as Eddie's usual playing-up and don\u2019t listen to him when he tries to explain that he is just a normal kid who switched places with Eddie for a laugh, and that they are leaving Eddie behind in Palm Beach, as well as Tom's own life. He asks if they can go back, but is refused, so Tom adjusts to his sudden new life as Eddie and enjoys it and acts well as Eddie and the character that Eddie must play, but he misses Pop and Miles. Tom Canty proves to be a 'better Eddie than Eddie', according to Elizabeth (Kay Panabaker), the cute co-star of Eddie Tudor in the production they are shooting together. She gets along with Tom much better than Eddie, which is why she realises that the boy she is now working with can't be Eddie and demands to know who he is. Tom explains all to Elizabeth and the two become close as they keep up the pretense in front of everyone around them, including Eddie's mom and Jerry (his agent), whilst they figure out what to do. Elizabeth suggests that Tom phone home, so he does, explaining all and knowing that he will be in trouble if his pop believes him.\nAs the days pass by, both Tom and Eddie try to tell people that they are not who everyone thinks they are. All Tom can now do is hope that his Pop comes to pick him up, whilst Eddie, upon realising that the production has moved to Miami, decides to get to the film set himself. He hotwires his boat (which was left in Palm Beach) after Miles takes the key from him and throws it into the water to stop who he thinks is Tom from running away from home. After he doesn\u2019t get very far in the boat, Eddie has to be bailed out by Milles from the police station, and driven home to Pop who starts on Miles for interfering. Miles says he just cares about Tom and doesn\u2019t want to see him going off the rails, but warns Pop that's what will happen if he keeps pushing him. Whilst they are arguing, Eddie jumps into Milles' car and drives off in it. Pop and Milles follow him in Pop's truck, losing track of him when he stops at a roadside service station to buy a veggie burger meal. At the film set in Miami, Milles and Pop bluff their way in by saying that they are extras. They also ask if there has been a kid pretending to be Eddie Tudor trying to sneak in yet, to which the security guard replies, \"No sir, not yet\". Later, Eddie arrives and the guard says to him, \"You must be pretending to be Eddie Tudor\" and lets him in. Once on the set, he spots Tom and confronts him, yelling \"You're dead, punk!\" and they have a brawl with Eddie ranting \"You took my identity!\", Tom responds with \"It wasn\u2019t my fault-They switched location!\". Eventually, all calms down and everyone finds out who is who and what has happened. Eddie tells his mom that he now realises that she only pushes him because she cares, to which she says \"That's right\", and she also reunites with Miles, whom she used to date before Eddie was born, while he was still in the business-before he went off on his own, which he tells her was because he didn\u2019t like the person he had become, not because he disliked her or acting. She understands and reveals to him that Eddie is his son.(Earlier in the movie when Miles thinks he is speaking with Tom he says \"I'm not your Dad, but I care about you a lot......I\u2019ve known you since you were a little kid and I've always thought you were cute, Tom\".)(it is never mentioned to Eddie that Miles is his father).\nThe movie ends with Eddie and Miles getting to know each other for real, as father and son, and, Miles and Eddie's mom hinting to each other about getting back together. All remain friends with Tom and he is taken on by Jerry to have his own acting career, starting with a production of Mark Twain's Prince and the Pauper with Eddie. \"We were going to use twins, but I think Tom and Eddie would be great\" said Jerry. \"They sure fooled all of us\". Pop asks Tom if that is definitely what he would like to do and after hearing the excited reply finally gives his approval and blessing to Tom. Milles tells Eddie that he is a lot younger than he was when he first started acting and says that the most important thing he learned was to be gracious and treat people with respect. He asks if Eddie can do that, to which he replies, \"I will now!\" and he does, just insulting Elizabeth jokingly at the filming of Prince and the Pauper, which she does back. They film with Tom, whilst Milles is now trying his hand at directing, with Eddie's mom producing and Jerry (Sally Kellerman) and Pop looking on. The end credits then begin, whilst the final shot shows of Eddie and Tom chilling together and with Miles barbecuing in a garden and everyone looks happy as Milles plays football with Tom, and his lookalike that he's known for much less time but who is really his son, Eddie, proud that the boys are following in his footsteps as actors and knows that they will not make the mistakes that he did after everything that they learned in their fun adventure: A Modern Twain Story: The Prince and the Pauper.", "tmdb_plot": "A modern day telling of the Mark Twain classic, The Prince and the Pauper.", "tmdb_id": "58831", "wiki_id": "8775362"}, {"title": "Project Makeover", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Na Jung-ju is a 30-year-old woman whose life is going nowhere, and she blames her misery on a failed high school romance with Jo Ha-ni, who has since become a famous singer.

One day, Andrea finds a dirty boy hiding out in their truck. Her father pities the boy and takes him in as his own son.\nAs the years go by and the children get older, Andrea and the boy, Daniel (Richard Gutierrez), grow very fond of each other while Jason becomes jealous of Daniel because of how much attention he has gotten from his family. One day Jason and Daniel get into a fight when their parents are not home and Jason beats him up and tells him that he will be sleeping outside that night. Andrea goes out to comfort Daniel and the two imply that they love each other. The two play together and pretend to get married: Andrea is the bride, Daniel the groom and the De Vera's daughter, Monique (Rhian Ramos), is the bridesmaid. Monique complains that she is always the bridesmaid and now she wants to have her turn at marrying Daniel. One day, Andrea's parents have news that they are moving into the hacienda behind the De Vera mansion and Jason, disappointed that he will not actually be living in the big house, runs away swearing to one day get rid of Daniel for good.\nNow Andrea and Daniel are in their early twenties. Andrea's parents get into a car accident and die. Jason secretly comes back for his parents' funeral and afterwards, he shows up at the hacienda and tells Daniel and Andrea that he is the head of the household and kicks Daniel out. The De Vera's children, Antonio (aka Anton, (TJ Trinidad) and Monique, come back from studying abroad and their mother throws them a welcome home party. After hearing that Monique has returned, Andrea and Daniel go to check it out even though they were not invited. Andrea had a scheme to get a glimpse of the party but she was unable to see anything when she was bitten by one of the guard dogs.

Shocked, he tries again to talk to her but she tries to avoid him. He finally gets her attention and interrogates her about her being at Anton's house instead of meeting with him. She does not answer until she is questioned about the wound under her lip, the one given to her by Jason the previous night. She says that she tripped and hurt herself. She tells Daniel not to worry about anything; everything's gonna be all right.

Monique tells him that she was invited and now she is inviting him so the two go to Andrea's party together. Once there, Andrea notices that Daniel is attending. She thinks nothing of it and the party continues. Anton then holds a box out in front of her and opens it, revealing a necklace with a diamond pendant. Daniel sees that Andrea is still wearing the locket that he gave her and he is surprised when she has to take it off just to try on Anton's necklace. Then Anton gets down on one knee and asks Andrea if she loves him. Despite her heart telling her the contrary, she sadly looks up at Daniel and says yes. Daniel is shocked to hear this. Anton then asks her to marry him and before she can answer, Daniel has already fled from the party. Andrea says she will think about it and runs off to find Daniel and explain things to him. She searches everywhere but once she gets to his house, she finds no one and concludes that he took all his savings and ran away.\nAndrea marries Anton according to her brother's wishes and Daniel becomes successful by being an underground mixed martial artist-brawler. Three years have passed since Andrea's party and one day Daniel decides to return to his hometown. Anton, Andrea and Monique patiently wait for a friend of Anton's, someone whom he has made business with. The man arrives on a yacht and he turns out to be Daniel. Everybody is surprised at this, especially Andrea. Daniel tries to win over Monique's heart again in attempts to make Andrea jealous. Andrea at this point is not jealous at all; in fact, she is still so shocked by Daniel's presence that she faints. She is revived and that night; Daniel comes by Andrea and Anton's house to speak to her. The two meet in the backyard and it is revealed that their feelings for each other have not changed one bit. Daniel tells her to meet him later at the lighthouse and Andrea goes back into the house to prepare for the \"meeting\" and looks for the locket that Daniel gave her three years back. Anton goes up to their room and the couple sleeps together. Then when Andrea is sure that Anton has fallen asleep, she goes to the lighthouse to meet with Daniel and the two make love.\nWhen Andrea comes home from the lighthouse, she is shocked to see that Anton has awakened and that he knows where she has been and with whom. He shows her that he also knows about the locket, which she forgot to wear when she went to meet with Daniel, and he throws it to the ground. He then approaches Andrea and pulls at her hair asking her questions. At this time Monique walks into this scene of the fight and asks what is going on. Anton says that Andrea is making a fool out of him, and pretending to love him when she really loves someone else. Then Andrea tells Anton to let her go because Daniel is waiting for her at the lighthouse but Anton tells her to let him wait forever and takes her to their bedroom. Monique notices Andrea's locket on the floor. She picks it up and looks at the pictures; it has now become clear to her as to what this was all about. Then she goes to the lighthouse to meet Daniel instead of Andrea and she deceives him, telling him that Andrea sent her to tell him that she does not love him any more and that she has changed her mind and loves Anton. She gives Daniel back the locket.\nThe next night Andrea, Anton, Monique and Daniel have dinner together on the beach. There, Daniel declares that the yacht that he arrived in a few days ago now belongs to Monique. Also, just like Anton did when he proposed to Andrea, Daniel proposes to Monique with a necklace. Shocked and surprised, Monique accepts and Andrea is crushed. Daniel and Anton go off to talk for a while and they make a deal: Anton will let Daniel marry his sister only if once they marry, they will move somewhere far away to settle. Daniel agrees. Meanwhile, Andrea tells Monique not to marry Daniel because she will be truly heartbroken, that he only wants to marry her to make Andrea jealous. Monique does not believe her and leaves. When Andrea and Anton go to bed, Andrea begs Anton not to let his sister and Daniel marry because it will shatter her heart. In the middle of the night, Andrea wakes up, and she can be seen in the bathroom clutching her stomach and seems to be in massive pain. The next morning she is still asleep, and Anton is watching her. She starts muttering words in her sleep, as if she was talking to Daniel, saying such things as \"Daniel, don't go, don't leave me.\" Anton checks on her, feels her forehead and calls the doctor.\nAfter the examination, the doctor concludes that Andrea has a fever and that she has to take a special medicine to get rid of the infection that is causing it. The doctor explains that he cannot give Andrea antibiotics because it could harm the baby. Anton does not know anything about a baby and the doctor states that Andrea is, in fact, pregnant, but she has an ectopic pregnancy. If Andrea is not treated soon she could have a hemorrhage or severe internal bleeding. As Anton is infertile, the only explanation for her pregnancy is Daniel. As soon as the doctor leaves, Anton locks Andrea and himself in the bedroom and he starts to beat her. The maid and Monique overhear Anton and Andrea from the outside of the door and when they hear that Daniel got Andrea pregnant, Monique cries, heartbroken after hearing the news. She then runs to Daniel's house and tells him what she has just found out. Anton keeps on hitting Andrea despite the screaming and pleading for him to stop. Then she falls to the ground, and blood can be seen on her white dress. Anton stops just as Daniel kicks down the door and runs to Andrea's side. He carries her out of the house.\nDaniel takes Andrea to the beach, where they talk. The two profess their undying love for each other and promise that they will live in each other's memories. After the promise is made, Andrea dies.\nThe movie is brought back to the grandfather from the beginning of the movie. His grandchildren ask if Andrea is still alive and he answers \"Yes. She is still alive right here, in my heart.\" A montage shows Andrea and Daniel playing together on the beach. At the end it shows a clip of him on the sand, his hand held out, holding the same locket with Daniel and Andrea's picture in it.

However, Simon, the man of the house, says that they are wrong and that they are a really poor family who have never had much money. A furious Benjamin holds Simon at gunpoint, while one of his henchmen begins taking measurements of all the family member's necks, he realizes that the only person who has the \"desired\" measurements is Simon's wife, Ofelia.

As a  train approaches, Davey tries in vain to drag her out of the car, himself jumping clear just in time. Two train crewmen, Tom Stark and Otis Higgs, seeing the car on the tracks ahead, argue about whether an emergency stop will derail the train or not. However, the train hits and kills the boy's mother. Subsequently, the railroad company calls for an internal inquiry and suspends the two drivers pending an informal inquiry.\nDavey has spent the first night after the incident with an empathetic social worker, Renee. However, she places the boy with a cold-hearted, disciplinarian foster mother who immediately declares to the boy that she would have preferred a girl.   Later on, after being confined to his room for insulting the foster mother while she berated him in the kitchen, he escapes by shattering first a picture frame on the wall, and then used the shattered glass to cut out the screen in the open window.

The police are then able to determine that the killer is male and has an AB blood type. Kyung-Yoon's personal life is also given priority, with his girlfriend asking to break up with him, saying that he loves someone else and called their name when drunk.\nShortly after the first grisly murder, a second murder occurs. The victims seem to be unrelated, but the modus operandi seems the same. When the police delve deeper into the victims' background, they discover that the two victims were stationed at the same military base many years ago. A month prior to their discharge, they were transferred to another base along with a third man named Jong Ha. The police now believe Jong Ha could be the next victim or the killer.

The rats live in an elderly woman's attic outside Paris, but when the woman discovers the rats, they're forced to evacuate, and Remy is separated from the others. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he explores until he finds himself on the roof of Gusteau's restaurant.\nRemy notices the restaurant's new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he ruined, and jumps in to fix Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and the new owner of the restaurant. Skinner confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when the soup is accidentally served and proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef, convinces Skinner to retain Linguini and uphold Gusteau's motto, \"Anyone can cook\". After demanding that Linguini replicate the soup, Skinner spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill him. Once they're alone, Linguini discovers that Remy can understand him, and he convinces Remy to help him cook.\nRemy controls Linguini's movements like a marionette by pulling on his hair while hiding under his toque.

Later, Remy finds \u00c9mile and reunites with the clan. After Remy tells Django that he intends to stay at the restaurant, Django shows him a group of exterminated rats in an attempt to convince him that humans are dangerous, but Remy ignores his warnings and leaves.\nMeanwhile, Skinner discovers through a letter from Linguini's late mother that Linguini is Gusteau's illegitimate son, and the rightful owner of the restaurant. Skinner is shocked and enraged about this revelation, as Gusteau's will stated that he would inherit ownership of the restaurant, only if no biological heir appeared two years prior to the latter's death. After his lawyer verifies that Linguini is Gusteau's heir, Skinner hides the evidence in an envelope, but Remy finds it and runs away, showing the documents to Linguini, who then forces Skinner out. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular, and Linguini's life improves as he develops a romantic relationship with Colette. Food critic Anton Ego, whose previous negative review of the restaurant indirectly led to Gusteau's death, announces to Linguini that he will dine at the restaurant. After Linguini takes credit for Remy's cooking at a press conference, he and Remy have a falling out. As revenge, Remy leads his clan to raid the restaurant's pantries for food. Linguini arrives to apologize, but upon discovering the raid, he furiously kicks Remy and the other rats out.\nThe next day, Remy is captured by Skinner but promptly freed by Django and \u00c9mile.

Meanwhile, Helen (Yvette Nicole Brown) is getting married to Buzz Baxter and, with many of her family members staying in her apartment, her grandmother Lula comes to stay at the Parker-Nichols home for a week, forcing Drake and Josh (Josh Peck) to share their room with Megan (Miranda Cosgrove) due to Lula staying in her's instead of the guest room (since Walter has a train set in the guest room as mentioned in \"The Great Dohney\"). In retaliation for this, Megan redecorates her brothers' room in a girly style, confines them to a single mattress in a corner with only a lamp and a football accompanying it, threatens to accuse them of vandalizing their neighbors' gazebo if they complain about this to their parents, and invites her friends to hang out with her in the room. To save money for her upcoming honeymoon, Helen makes a deal with Craig and Eric to videotape her wedding.\nHelen then promotes the Premiere's latest employee and Josh's ex-girlfriend, Mindy Crenshaw (Allison Scagliotti), as its new assistant manager for fixing a corn dog rotisserie that Josh was unable to fix. Josh is distraught over not getting the position and accuses Mindy of constantly trying to do better than him, which she denies. While at the recording studio for Drake's song, Josh is given a contract from Krim to sign that he fails to read, as the company's served prawns distract him, and he inadvertently signs the creative rights to Drake's song away. An auto-tuned \"bubblegum pop\" remix of the song that Drake is not pleased with is soon developed by Krim. Learning about the contract and Josh's involvement in it, a furious Drake bitterly fires him as his manager for his blundering and attempts to get revenge on Krim as well as acting cold to Josh. While criticizing Josh for always playing by the rules, Drake tells him that, \"when people play dirty, sometimes you have to play dirty back\". \nAttempting to fix his mistake, Josh returns to Spin City Records. After being told Daka Shoes will not use the song's original version on the Super Bowl commercial and will use the Krim auto-tuned remix instead, Josh decides to take Drake's words to heart and switches the remix with the original as it is being picked up. The plan succeeds and the original version of the song plays on the commercial, much to the delight of Drake, who finally forgives his brother, but it comes with a price. Right after the commercial airs, Josh receives a call from Krim, who informs him that his switching of the songs has violated the contract and Spin City plans to sue the duo for $50,000,000 with the possibility of a prison sentence.\nWhile at work as Drake gets a call, Mindy panics as Crazy Steve has gone insane, having been mistakenly scheduled on a Monday, which, according to Helen, is \"his bad day\". Josh manages to calm him down by singing \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\" and telling him to have some milk, for which a hesitant Helen finally appreciates his good work. In spite of how Josh managed to handle this situation better than her, Mindy then confesses to Josh that she did not take the assistant manager job because she needed extra money or to do better than him at all; she did it because she wanted to spend more time with him, having always regretted breaking up with him. Drake and Josh then go to Spin City Records for a stern talking-to with Krim about switching the remix with the original CD, but as they are prepared to face the consequences, company president Nick Mateo says that Drake's song has become a number one hit and extremely popular with 30,000 emails and phone calls from fans wishing to buy it, and dozens of downloads of it crashing their website's server. The charges against the duo are dropped, much to their delight, and an outraged Krim is fired by Mateo for his actions into messing Drake's song and tricking Josh into it.\nAt Helen's wedding, Craig mistakenly plugs his equipment into a faulty plug after Eric tells him to, which causes a fire that sets the Premiere ablaze.

Salazar, based in Camp \"The Oven\" Carolina, near Samarra, Iraq, is using his camcorder to record an amateur documentary, Tell Me No Lies, about his deployment in Samarra, to present to a film school of choice as part of admission. Meanwhile, a French documentary crew is shooting a documentary called Barrage while they are embedded with Salazar's platoon.\nThe French documentary crew films the soldiers performing their routine duties as they man a random checkpoint as part of their deployment in Iraq, to help curtail insurgent activity. The soldiers spend their days searching cars at the checkpoint. One day, the French documentary videotapes an incident in which Private First Class Reno Flake (Patrick Carroll), while manning a Humvee-mounted M2 machine gun, fires on a speeding car that tries to rush through the checkpoint. A pregnant female passenger in the car is shot and is rushed to the hospital by her brother, and later dies. It is later revealed that the brother, the driver of the car, was simply trying to get his pregnant sister to the hospital, as she was in labor, and misinterpreted the soldiers' commands to stop, believing that they were telling him that he was clear to proceed.\nBack at Camp Carolina, Salazar, camcorder in hand, asks Flake how he felt about killing a pregnant woman, and he replies that he felt \"nothing\", and that it was like \"gutting catfish\". When Specialist Lawyer McCoy (Rob Devaney), a married, college-educated soldier, is disgusted by this response, Salazar and McCoy press the issue further, and Flake offers a sarcastic, facetious apology to Salazar's camcorder, enjoying the limelight, which further inflames the situation. Sergeant Jim Vazquez (Mike Figueroa) defuses the situation before it gets out of hand, stating that, under the rules of engagement, Flake's actions were proper.\nWhile on a foot patrol, one of the more experienced soldiers, Master Sergeant Sweet, is killed after stepping on an improvised explosive device. Flake and his friend SPC B.B. Rush (Daniel Stewart Sherman) are enraged by Sweet's death and wish to take revenge by attacking some Iraqis. During a poker game, Flake and Rush announce their plan to go to the house of an Iraqi family they had searched previously, with the goal of raping a 15-year-old girl who is one of the family members. Despite objections from Blix and McCoy, Flake and Rush carry out their plan, with Salazar and McCoy accompanying them; the former to videotape the incident and the latter in the hopes of stopping them.\nMcCoy tries to stop the duo, but he is ordered out of the house at gunpoint. Flake and Rush rape the girl as Salazar films the events using a hidden helmet-mounted video camera. Afterwards, the girl and her entire family are killed and the girl is burned. McCoy tries to tell Blix about the rape, when Rush confronts the two and threatens McCoy at knife-point, demanding he not report the rape. Afterwards, McCoy is deeply disturbed by the rape and murders, and he tells his father about the incident via webchat. His father, citing the Abu Ghraib incident, urges him not to report the incident, fearing the publicity generated would disparage the U.S. internationally. Regardless, McCoy ignores his father's objections and reports the rape, going to the Criminal Investigation Division (CID) to make them aware of the crimes and they subsequently interview him. Salazar too is disturbed by the scenes he recorded, and he meets with an Army psychologist to discuss his deteriorating mental state.\nWhile busy making a video for his mother during a foot patrol, a preoccupied Salazar is kidnapped by insurgents at knife-point and driven away in a van. Rush notices Salazar missing and his camera, which was left behind during the kidnapping. Later, Salazar is beheaded alive by the insurgents and a video of his murder uploaded onto the internet. Before beheading him, the insurgents claim that his beheading was retribution for Farah's rape. Salazar's decapitated corpse is discovered by a Bedouin man and subsequently retrieved by U.S. soldiers. The Army alleges the rape and murder were perpetrated by insurgents, but a relative rejects the claim, stating that they are of the same sect as the supposed insurgents. After the story makes the news, Flake and Rush are arrested and interrogated by the CID and the duo conceitedly admit to the rapes in rambling racist rants.\nIn October 2006, after returning home from Iraq, McCoy is at a bar with his wife when he is asked by his civilian friends to tell them a \"war story\".

When Infamous' driver fakes an ankle injury, Natasha becomes Infamous' driver in exchange for $300,000 and a recording contract.

As they approach the finish line, Natasha is several car lengths ahead of Jason, but he quickly zips past her by engaging the onboard nitrous system.

Infamous and Cheng are eliminated from the race after their cars (an SLR and a Porsche Carrera GT, respectively) are involved in separate crashes. During the race, Natasha (driving Michael's Enzo) receives a phone call from Carlo notifying her that he has rescued her mother.

Kernan eventually learns that Champ was once a famous former heavyweight boxing contender, Bob Satterfield.\n\nDuring an interview with a magazine publisher named Whitley, Kernan informs him that he has an influential story about Satterfield. At the same time, Champ is reluctant to cooperate for any biographical piece. In order to gain Champ's confidence for the chronicle, Kernan recruits an associate at the newspaper, Polly, to assist him in retrieving information about his past.\nThe magazine ultimately publishes Kernan's article. It wins acclaim from readers and journalists alike. The story even draws the attention of a TV personality from Showtime, Flak, who boldly suggests it should be nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. But the intense publicity brings Kernan into contact with elderly folk who knew Satterfield personally, and are adamant that he's deceased. Kernan later learns that Champ is in fact a lesser known boxing contender, Tommy Kincaid, whom Satterfield once defeated in the ring. He makes a conscious choice and decides to inform his editors about the profile error. However, before he can do so, he learns that he and the newspaper are being sued by Satterfield's son, Robert.

Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.\nWill returns to The Great Hall and learns the form each sign will take. Will reveals the first sign within Gwen's pendant. As the sign-seeker, Will travels through time to find the next four signs. The Rider enlists a mysterious figure to help him get the signs from Will. When Will's brother invites Maggie to their home, she reveals some of her powers to Will. Will reveals his affections for her, saying he felt an instant connection with her. He tells her he has been thinking of her constantly. The Rider also tricks Will's older brother Max, using his magic to partially control him. The spell over Max is finally broken when Will uses his great strength to give Max a concussion. By the fifth day, The Dark that The Rider commands has now gained tremendous power and begins to attack the village with a terrible blizzard. Will locates the fifth sign but without the sixth sign, the Dark continues to rise. Maggie is revealed to be the mysterious witch helping the Rider in exchange for eternal youth. She is betrayed by him (for failing to get any of the signs) when she fails to get the fifth sign and ages rapidly, disintegrating into a flood of water while trying to steal them from Will. The Old Ones and Will seek sanctuary in the Great Hall, where the Rider cannot enter unless invited. However, The Rider's final trick (impersonating the voices of Will's mother and father, as well as Gwen) gains him access to The Great Hall. The Rider reveals that he has trapped Tom, whom The Rider mistook for The Seeker and kidnapped, within a glass sphere (and apparently took care of all of these years). He sends Will into an evil dark cloud. As he enters, Will solves the riddle of the sixth sign: he himself is the sixth sign. With all six signs identified The Rider cannot touch nor harm Will. Using his power over the dark, Will banishes both The Rider \u2013 imprisoning the evil figure within one of his own glass spheres \u2013 and The Dark. The sphere disappears into the murky water.

In a small period of time, he is able to charm Georgia, saying that her name represents Liam's \"favorite Confederate state.\"  The two sleep together, but Liam weeps after his father calls him while the two are having sex, ostensibly because Liam, while able to have sex with the woman he chose, feels pangs of emptiness from not being connected to his folk, and instead, being lured into the image of success represented by women such as Georgia.\nAfter having sex with Georgia, Liam picks Adelaide up to take her to school. Liam is obviously conflicted as he connects with Adelaide on an intellectual level, but cannot get past the difference in their age. Liam then gets a call from his father in New York, informing him that Liam's grandmother has died and has left Liam a small house in Shanghai.  Liam travels to Shanghai, promising to call Adelaide daily while he is there.  Upon arrival, he is greeted by his cousin who speaks English and who has found an older couple to buy Liam's house for him. After spending a night out on the town with his cousin and a call girl named Amy (with whom he did not have sex), as well as an awkward late night call from Adelaide at his hotel, Liam goes to meet the buyers of his house. After seeing the view of Shanghai from the house, and being told that the house would sell for five hundred thousand yuan and not five hundred thousand U.S. dollars, Liam chooses not to sell the house. While at a bar, he meets Micki Yang (Kelly Hu). Micki is initially resistant to the charms of Liam, but the two slowly tour Shanghai doing things Liam has never done.  Micki is still somewhat skeptical about Liam, since Liam is, in a sense, foreign in his home country and has never visited and knows little about his home-land. After spending the night together, Liam decides to move into his grandmother's house in Shanghai.\nLiam returns to L.A. and tells his friends of his plan. After a tearful goodbye with Adelaide, he returns to Shanghai and tries to live as a Chinese person. Unfortunately, Liam is picked up by Micki's gangster boyfriend, of whom Liam was not aware, after he finds out about Liam and Micki's relationship. Pointing out Liam's up-bringing in the U.S., Micki's boyfriend dumps Liam from a limousine in the pouring rain in downtown Shanghai. Liam is reminded of his semiforeign status as he wanders the streets unable to communicate with the people or find his way home. Liam later asks Micki about her boyfriend, and she responds that she is only with him because her family is destitute - her mother raised her and her numerous young siblings alone, and it would greatly aid her family to have access to such money. She also mentions that Liam cannot possibly understand the options one has when one is living a life of abject poverty.\nAfter Micki tells Liam to go back to Los Angeles, he again almost sells the house to the elderly couple, but has another change of heart and decides to leave the house to Micki, who will be able to use the house to abide in with her family and thus will not be forced to remain with her boyfriend because of financial issues.  He returns to the U.S. to reconcile with Adelaide, but she rebukes him as she is leaving for France to attend art school. With a mixed-message good-bye, she goes to France and Liam reconciles with his father, getting a job at Starbucks and successfully auditioning for an advertisement for a genital herpes treatment. Adelaide later returns to the U.S. and Liam is prepared to meet her upon her arrival to the airport from France. However, as he prepares to walk up to give her some flowers, he sees Adelaide kissing a Caucasian man as they part. Liam walks out of the airport and disposes of the flowers in frustration of himself. As he prepares to leave, however, Adelaide accosts him. When he asks about the man in the airport, she informs Liam that the man was her instructor and that \"he's as gay as a pineapple.\" They agree to restart their relationship on a more solid footing (if for no other reason because she is now of legal age), and he explains that he's \"daffy about her.\" She tells him \"anything is possible, that's the beauty of living\".

As more thugs, led by a ruthless man named Hertz, arrive, the woman goes into labor and Smith delivers her baby boy during a shootout. Pursued by Hertz, the woman is shot dead; Smith narrowly escapes with the newborn. Leaving the baby in a park, Smith hopes someone will adopt the child, but a passing woman is killed with a shot from Hertz's sniper rifle. Realizing that Hertz is trying to kill the baby, Smith saves him and tries unsuccessfully to leave him with a prostitute named Donna Quintano. \nHertz soon arrives at the brothel and tortures Donna for information; Smith returns and kills Hertz's henchmen. After a brief confrontation, Smith shoots Hertz and leaves with Donna and the baby. Having secretly worn a bulletproof vest, however, Hertz is alive albeit wounded. Taking Donna to his hideout, Smith realizes that the baby (whom he names Oliver) stops crying when he hears heavy metal music; he concludes that Oliver's mother lived near a heavy metal club. Pursued by Hertz, Smith shoots his way out of the hideout, and he and Donna head to a nearby club.

Smith brings Donna and Oliver to a war museum and hides them in a M24 Chaffee tank for safekeeping. Smith infiltrates the Hammerson factory and hears Hertz and Hammerson saying that they do not want the next president to repeal the right to bear arms. He also notices that Hammerson owns a German Shepherd dog named Duchess. Smith booby-traps the facility with an array of firearms, allowing him to kill the thugs and escape. During a shootout, Hertz reveals that he had conducted an investigation about Smith's identity and it turned out Smith is a former Army Ranger whose wife and kid were killed in a shootout in a burger joint. Smith sees an article about Senator Rutledge, a Democratic presidential candidate who favors stricter gun laws. Smith deduces that Rutledge has cancer and requires a bone-marrow transplant. \nDue to which, Rutledge had impregnated the woman with his sperm (and why Hertz and Hammerson want Oliver dead). If the infants die, the senator will not receive a transplant and would be unable to run for president. Smith tells Donna to leave town and contacts one of Rutledge's henchmen to request an appointment.

At the office of a private military company in Langley, Virginia, US Army Colonel Isaac Johnson and his associates, Payne and Dobbler, review Swagger's file. Johnson approaches Swagger and requests him to use his skills and expertise to thwart a possible attempt on the President's life that intelligence sources have uncovered.\nSwagger helps them determine where and how the attempt will likely be made, in Philadelphia. On the day, Swagger accompanies Johnson and his men to a room overlooking the site. However, the situation turns out to be a setup: the shot is fired according to Swagger's plan, killing the President\u2019s guest, the Ethiopian Archbishop Desmond Mutumbo. Swagger is shot by a Philadelphia police officer on Johnson's payroll, and one of his rifles and ammunition are left at the scene to frame him for the assassination. Swagger narrowly escapes, incapacitating rookie FBI Agent Nick Memphis and stealing his bureau vehicle.\nSwagger manages to stay alive long enough to track down Fenn's widow Sarah, who treats his wounds. After recovering, Swagger goes after Johnson and his associates after learning that they killed his pet dog. Agent Memphis, who had been skeptical of Swagger's guilt from the beginning after doing a deep dive on Swagger's background and the circumstances surrounding the shooting, is abducted by Johnson\u2019s men and tortured for information. Swagger kills them, frees Memphis and asks for his help.\nThe duo drive to Tennessee where they meet with a firearms expert named Mr. Rate, who tells them that it is possible for a bullet to be fired from one rifle but made to look like it came from another, through a technique called paper patching, in this case a round Swagger fired from his rifle at a can of stew a week before the assassination. Dobbler informs Johnson of Swagger's annual correspondence with Sarah, arranging for her kidnapping by Payne to be used as leverage.\nRate deduces that the Bosnian-Ukrainian sniper Mikhaylo Sczerbiak, using the alias Michael Sandor, is the only working sniper capable of the shot. Swagger and Memphis eliminate the contractors guarding Sczerbiak's rural Virginia home. Sczerbiak informs Swagger that Johnson works for U.S. Senator Charles Meachum, who leads a conglomerate exploiting economic assets in developing countries. Sczerbiak confessed that he assassinated the Archbishop in order to prevent him from speaking about the atrocities committed in Ethiopia by the organization, such as wiping out an entire village so an oil pipeline could be laid. Swagger discovers that he covered the retreat of the contractors who carried out the massacre. After revealing Sarah's abduction, Sczerbiak commits suicide.\nSwagger arranges a meet with Johnson and Meachum in Montana, while also tipping off the FBI. The two arrive with Payne holding Sarah at gunpoint. Memphis acts as a decoy to draw fire from Johnson's snipers, allowing Swagger to eliminate them and free Sarah, who shoots and kills Payne. Swagger confronts Meachum, replaying the recording of Sczerbiak's confession about the massacre. However, after Meachum further alludes to how big the corruption is, Swagger burns the recording, realizing it will only get him killed.\nThe FBI arrive and take Swagger into custody. Later, he is allowed a private meeting with Attorney General Russert, Johnson, and personnel from the FBI, including Memphis. Swagger's rifle, left at the assassination, is brought in.

To further prove Swagger's innocence, Memphis displays photos of the massacre as evidence. Though all of the evidence proves Swagger's innocence for good, Russert is unable to charge Meachum and Johnson for their crimes as they are perpetrated outside of American jurisdiction.\nSympathizing with Swagger while having him released, Russert privately intimates to Swagger that extrajudicial means may be necessary to clean up the corruption.

TVN reporter Meeta Matu (Dia Mirza) reports that some 3000 rounds of ammunition were discharged by a large police squad at a previously peaceful residential area.\nThe film moves to the office of former chief justice turned private prosecutor Dhingra (Amitabh Bachchan), who interviews the three leading members of the Bombay Encounter Squad: Additional Commissioner of Police Shamsher S. Khan (referring to A. A. Khan, played by Sanjay Dutt), Inspector Kaviraj Patil (Sunil Shetty) and Constable Javed Sheikh (Arbaaz Khan). The main film timeline is the extended interview of the three officers by Dhingra; as the officers answer Dhingra's questions, the film flashes back to show the incidents.\nDhingra asks about the Encounter Squad. Khan explains that he hand-picked 27 of Bombay police's best-enlisted men and officers. He borrowed the concept from the LAPD SWAT team to help combat crime. The film flashes back to show Khan selecting his men and putting them through intensive physical and mental training to be \"fast, efficient and deadly.\" Dhingra is hardly impressed: he points out that if Khan \"shoots to kill,\" he is no different from the gangsters he seeks to destroy.\nDhingra asks why Khan felt he had to do this. Khan explains that following Operation Blue Star in 1984, several Sikh terrorists fled to Bombay and began establishing a base in the city. They engaged in violence, extortion, and other subversive tactics to grow their operations. The film flashes back to show Sub-Inspector Mhatre (Abhishek Bachchan), a very brave officer and disciple of Khan, pursuing and subsequently getting shot down by a group of Sikh terrorists. Khan is deeply frustrated when the Bombay police, mired in internal bureaucracy and corruption, fail to act. He obtains clearance from police commissioner Krishnamurthy (played by the real A. A. Khan) and sets out after the militants. Khan asks Meeta (Diya Mirza) to cover the incident so as to deter future terrorists. True to Khan's words, he successfully \"encounters\" (it indicates summarily gunning down criminals; extrajudicial killings is the term accepted internationally) the terrorists who shot PSI Mhatre. (As per A. A. Khan, the encounter with Khalistani extremists was more dangerous and tough than the Lokhandwala Complex shootout.)\nThe film segues into the life of Maya (referring to Bombay gangster Mahindra Dolas though the film never mentions Dolas specifically; played by Vivek Oberoi). Maya is the second-in-command of the \"big boss\" in Dubai (a clear reference to Dawood Ibrahim though the film does not mention his name) and runs his criminal activities in Bombay. Maya recruits Bhua (referring to Dilip Buwa, played by Tusshar Kapoor) after successfully hatching a plot to eliminate Bhua's old gang led by Ashok Joshi. At this point, Maya and Bhua are at the top of Bombay's underworld, reporting directly to the big boss in Dubai.\nThings heat up when Khan recognizes, through his network of spies and informers, that Maya is responsible for several criminal and possibly terrorist activities. Around this time, Maya's ambitions, fuelled by his mother's (Amrita Singh) insistence, grow to the point where he wishes to assert his independence from Dubai and take over Bombay himself.\nKhan's ATS now focuses on eliminating Maya and Bhua, and begins a dangerous cat-and-mouse game where neither side shows any overt aggression but tries to disable the adversary by tactical maneuver. With the help of information provided by the informers, Kaviraj and Javed together kill Aslam Kasai who happens to be Maya's gang member. In order to force the gangsterd out of their hiding, Khan launches \"visits\" to the criminals' families to try to \"persuade\" them to counsel the criminals to surrender. In turn, Maya and his men return the \"visit\" by approaching the cops in social situations. Maya visits Khan at a restaurant where Khan is having dinner with his family. Maya quietly tells Khan that this is between his men and them and he should leave the families out of it. Khan retorts by saying that he did this to give him an opportunity to come clean but then it appears that any resolution hangs off the barrel of a gun.\nMaya's rage intensifies when he gets thrown out by prominent city builder Wadhwani (based on real-life builder and politician Gopal Rajwani, owner of the building that the movie was set in). Maya had demanded 4  million protection money; Wadhwani claimed to deal directly with Dubai. Maya kidnaps Wadhwani's sniveling, overweight kid. When Wadhwani complains, the big boss asks Maya to cut it out and return the child immediately. Maya quietly informs the boss that he has upped his demands and that he wants to reign supreme in Bombay.\nThe film also explores the personal lives of the protagonists. Khan's wife Rohini, (played by Neha Dhupia) is unable to bear the constant neglect of his family life. She files for divorce. Patil's divorce is nearly upon him, too. In the enemy camp, Buwa has shacked up with a bar dancer Tanu (Aarti Chhabria), and is unable to spend any quality time with her. Fellow criminals Fatim a.k.a. Fatoo  (Rohit Roy); who's estranged from his parents and RC (Shabbir Ahluwalia); the character is plagued by ghost-like visions of an innocent family he gunned down) have similar troubles. The only members who are out of any personal trouble are gang leader Maya and a gang members named Doubling (Aditya Lakhia).\nIt all comes to a head in November 1991. The five criminals, including Maya and Buwa, secure themselves while holding Wadhwani's kid, in a flat at Swati building in Lokhandwala. Khan is tipped off of the location by an informant. (In Dhingra's questioning, Khan allegedly also received a call from the big boss in Dubai. Khan vehemently denies this.) Khan assembles a large squad of cops and lays siege to the location. He announces over the bullhorn that residents are advised to stay indoors and bolt their windows.\nA long and devastating gun battle begins. The criminals launch rocket-propelled grenades from their flat and try to escape. But they are overwhelmed by police fire, and all five criminals are eventually slain. The battle lays waste to the building: Film shots show the staircases, hallways, and several civilian flats completely pulverized by gunfire. Reporter Meeta Matu covers the action live.\nUp to this point, Dhingra has been negative and denigrating of Khan and his efforts with the ATS. He cites press reports and civilian complaints that condemn Khan (and the ATS) of unilateral and unwarranted excessive force in a residential locality. Charges are brought against Khan and the ATS. But when Dhingra rises to defend them as their appointed counsel, he, in a surprising twist, presents an unconventional argument as a defence.\nThe film ends with Khan and the ATS being acquitted.", "tmdb_plot": "On a calm summer day in 1991, in the bustling Lokhandwala Complex, five criminals including Maya and Dilip were counting 70 lakhs in flat no. 32 B, when 286 policemen, headed by ACP Khan, took strategic positions around their building.

A highly influential political leader and industrialist, Adiseshan, who runs profit-making educational institutions and hospitals sees Sivaji as his deadly competitor.\nIn the process of establishing the Sivaji Foundation, Sivaji is forced to pay bribes to several government officials and ministers to get basic approvals and sanctions done, and is eventually forced to mortgage his property and sell his belongings when the bribes demanded become very high. Sivaji is dragged by the State Government (under political influence of Adiseshan) to court when he starts sabotaging the Sivaji Foundation through his political influence, but at the court, he is forced to admit that he paid numerous bribes. The judge declares the verdict in favour of Adiseshan and shuts down Sivaji Foundation. Meanwhile, Sivaji falls in love with Tamizhselvi, a demure and traditional girl.

Sivaji, reduced to utter poverty, decides to play the game his own way. With the help of his uncle Arivu, he acquires evidence of \u20b92 billion worth of illegal earnings in Adiseshan's possession and uses the documents to blackmail Adiseshan into giving him half the money. Adhiseshan traps Sivaji with 50 goons, but Sivaji trashes them and leaves with both money and documents. Using the amount, he further obtains details on people who have illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth. He then transfers the money to New York, where he gives it to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by hawala forgery. They then deposit the money as donations to the Sivaji Foundation, making the money usable and legitimate.\nSivaji informs the Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders (including Adiseshan) and gets them arrested on the same day. He blackmails the minister and legally reopens the foundation and soon is able to provide free, good quality education, infrastructure, services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu.

It is implied that the man masturbates after the corpse has been sufficiently mutilated. Next, someone browses and clicks on the link for \"Snuff Fantasy\". Images of animals and people (mostly women) being tortured and killed clutter the screen, followed by a real life video of a pig being stabbed in the throat, squealing and bleeding out. A critic asks \"Until what point are you willing to watch? In other words, what do you want to watch?\" A wrists-bound-behind-her-back, tightly cleave-gagged, barefoot and crying woman in her bra and panties (Victim 102) is shown in a bathroom. She manages to force the gag out of her mouth, gets up and moves the shower's curtain. She then screams at what she sees.\nThe film now goes back one week (in black and white footage), and shows a female journalist (aka Victim 102, portrayed by Yamila Greco) doing her morning routines and watching a newscast about a recently captured serial killer of sex workers. This inspires the journalist to write about violence itself. The reporter accesses the pornographic and shock websites frequented by the killer (being greatly disturbed by their content) and interviews a film critic and author (Eduardo Poli), who discusses topics such as misogyny, fetishes, new media, morality, pornography, snuff, and the value of human life. Intercut with the reporter's research are scenes of her and two other women (a pregnant sex worker and a porn star) being filmed as they are tortured by a masked man (portrayed by Rodrigo Bianco) who labels his captives 100, 101, and 102.\nThe pregnant woman (Victim 100, portrayed by Andrea Alfonso) is the first to be brutalized. All the while, Victims' 101 and 102 are screaming and moaning through their tightly gagged mouths. Accompanying their gagged moaning is an industrial music score by El Hemisferio Derecho. Victim 100 is beaten, several of her fingers are cut off and a bag is pulled over her head, which is stomped and kicked repeatedly. The masked killer gropes Victim 100, stomps her stomach, bites one of her nipples off, mutilates her genitals with a chef knife, and proceeds to cut her open with the knife. Before moving on, the masked killer then removes the gag of Victim 102 and orally rapes her with the same chef knife while also masturbating. He then reapplies her gag and drags Victim 100 to the bathroom. With the killer now out of sight, Victim 102 flings from the trash-laden floor a shard of glass, held by her toes, to her hands bound behind her to start cutting the rope that binds her wrists to the back of the chair. Coming out of the bathroom, the killer now goes to work on the porn star (Victim 101, portrayed by Silvia Paz). He beats her with a hammer, rips one of her eyes out, asphyxiates her with a bag, knocks her front teeth out with a chisel, and urinates on and rapes her.\nWhile the masked killer is taking Victim 101 apart with a hacksaw, the journalist is desperately trying to free her bare feet from the legs of the chair with her still-bound-behind her-hands. A flashback reveals that she was taken when she found hidden photographs depicting the film critic engaging in necrophilia. (The film critic and the masked killer are discovered to be partners in their sick fantasies.) Now freed from the chair, the still wrists bound-behind-her and gagged journalist escapes from the masked killer to the bathroom and manages to lock the door. Now... returning to the bathroom sequence from the beginning of the film, it is shown that the journalist discovered Victim 100 in the shower. The woman is still alive; something the masked killer rectifies when he breaks into the room, and at first bludgeons Victim 102 with a hammer (temporarily stunning her) but then bludgeons Victim 100 to death. The masked killer then drags the journalist out of the room with a hook impaling her belly, and as he prepares to kill her, she breaks the ropes binding her hands with another shard of glass on the floor, grabs a cellphone, and runs off.\nThe cellphone will not work, so the journalist tries to find a way out as the masked killer searches for her, machete in hand. The journalist squeezes out a barred window, and is chased into the woods by the masked killer, who catches her.

He believes it is a single organism with a hive mind, comparing it to an ant colony that had attacked when the building of the CGCC threatened its habitat, but this organism can reproduce at alarming rates.\nBack at the hotel, Deadmarsh views the vlog that Mikaela was recording and saw a slime-covered creature crawl out of her bathtub as she's smashing the mirrors. He and Tony go into the sewers to look for Reggie and Hank. Symes is livid that all the guests of CGCC are evacuating themselves but begins hallucinating when he comes into contact with the slime. He follows Deadmarsh and Tony into the sewers and tries attacking them, but Tony shoots him. Tony and Deadmarsh are slimed by this point, and Tony hallucinates that Symes returns to life. Deadmarsh finds his body as Connolly, Middleton, and Khali enter the sewer and find him. Together, they find Reggie and Hank's bodies and discover the slime is starting to seal up all exits. Deadmarsh sacrifices himself so the others can escape, setting aflame the methane leaking out from the sewer walls after the others are behind a sealed metal door. They come across the creature's heart, including its mouth, and Connolly falls into it. Middleton saves Khali as she is about to fall in, and she uses her grandmother's necklace to calm the creature by reciting the Ojibwe prayer. They escape, and Middleton reconnects with Khali at the ambulance and confesses his hallucination was that Khali fell into the creature and died.

Will is forbidden from watching films or television and is made to leave his classroom when the teacher puts on a documentary. In the corridor, he meets Lee Carter, the 12-year-old worst-behaved boy in school, thrown out of another class for bad behaviour. They accidentally break a fish bowl in the corridor; Lee volunteers to take the blame, pretending that the punishment is torture, in exchange for Will's watch, which belonged to his dead father. Moreover, Lee demands that Will performs the stunts in a film Lee is making with home video equipment owned by his 16-year-old bullying older brother, Lawrence, which Lawrence uses in his video bootlegging enterprise. He intends to enter the Screen Test Young Film-Makers' Competition.\nWill accepts, after accidentally seeing the film First Blood at Lee's house while hiding from Lawrence. He becomes very enthusiastic, and plays several dangerous action scenes, culminating in the two boys becoming 'blood brothers' after Lee saves Will from drowning. Lee finds Will's sketch book, full of colourful and glorious ideas, and starts to incorporate some of them into his film script. The two become best friends, but Will has to keep it secret from his family and the increasingly interfering Brother Joshua of the Brethren, who clearly has designs on his mother.\nFrench exchange students arrive and one of them, Didier Revol, becomes very popular. After finding Will's sketch book, he asks Will if he and his acolytes can play in the film, and Will agrees. Didier reveals that he has always wanted to be an actor. This mushrooms into the whole school being part of the production, and Will being included with the cool sixth-formers. Lee does not like this, as he is no longer in control, and finally quits after a fight with Will during filming of the last sequence, which takes place at a disused power station. After Will becomes trapped when part of the unstable structure collapses due to Didier's carelessness, and the entire school/crew run away, even Didier, Lee returns to rescue his friend, but uses the excuse that he has come to collect his brother's camera. He too gets hurt, and has to go to hospital. Lawrence visits him, but is angry about the fact that the camera is broken.\nWill's mother, from whom he has struggled to hide his activities, finally realises that her son must be allowed to be himself and her family leaves the Brethren. The film is never submitted to the competition as they miss the deadline. The French students leave, and while Didier was popular and worshipped in Britain, his own school-mates mock him, and he is actually lonely and isolated.

At the hospital, Miranda silently transforms into an alien form and seduces and kills several people. When Tom arrives the following morning, he finds bodies everywhere. Tom locates Miranda, injects her with human hormones and begins driving her to Mexico.\nOn the way, Miranda wakes up, asking for the cause of her illness. Tom tells Miranda that she is the result of an experiment that combined human and alien DNA, conducted with his friend Forbes McGuire while they were in college. Tom has been injecting her with human hormones since her childhood to suppress her alien DNA. Her parents were a fiction created by Tom to help build Miranda's normal life. Tom explains he and Forbes parted ways because of differences of opinion over their creation.\nIn Mexico, Tom and Miranda locate Forbes, who lives with his recent experiment named Azura, another human and alien DNA hybrid who serves as his assistant and lover. Forbes supports his experiment by creating half-alien facsimiles of dead pets and relatives for his paying clients. Forbes checks Miranda's condition and finds that she will die in days; her changes to alien form are her body's way of fighting back as her human form has a weaker immune system. The only way to deny death is injecting fresh human DNA into Miranda. Miranda won't allow that to happen when she realizes it will result in the human sacrifice. Miranda becomes unconscious, and Tom goes searching for a \"donor\" and is mugged. Azura incapacitates the mugger and the two bring her back to Forbes' lab, where they succeed in extending Miranda's life.\nHowever, Miranda starts acting odd, joking about having sex with Azura. Tom checks her blood as she invites him to get drunk and have sex in their hotel room; he tells her to rest, believing she is delirious from the procedure. She leaves in a huff.

The dead agent's finger luckily falls on the keyboard, and the message is sent to Mi5.\nOn 22 September, in London, Sandeep Arora aka Sandy (Zayed Khan) arrives from India to convince his angry girlfriend Sanjana (Tanushree Dutta) to return with him to India so that they can get married. From the airport, he boards a taxi and starts interacting with the driver, who is a Pakistani, named Iqbal Qureshi, and tells the latter, his reason to come to London. In the same city, Siddharth Verma \"Sid\", who is a chef in a restaurant, lives with his wife, Richa Verma, who is a Science teacher, and their son Bobby Verma (Taseen Chowdhary). Sandy then arrives at the hotel where his girlfriend, Sanjana is staying and finds her in order to convince her to forget the past and marry him, but Sanjana is very angry about Sandy's childishness and says that marriage is not a child's play, but Sandy keeps on trying so that she forgives him.\nSid then reaches the restaurant he works in but enters a secret office with a hidden back door inside the restaurant, and it is then revealed that he is actually a secret agent of MI5. Afterward, his junior co-agent Pam informs him that their boss James, the head of Mi-5, has asked for him and also states that, James has something big for him and can send him on a big mission. Sid soon meets James, who briefs him about the email that contains the code which was sent by the agent from Kuala Lumpur and also informed him that the email came with a red signal alert, an S.O.S. channel which means an imminent danger to them and can lead to a terrorist attack and orders Sid to crack the code immediately. On the other hand, at Sid's house, Richa returns from her work while talking on the phone and soon finds out that her telephone connection and outside camera connections are disabled and also finds a man standing near her window. It is the same man who the gangsters called in Kuala Lumpur named Kabir Khan who is there to kidnap Richa and eventually succeeds and takes her to an unknown location and holds her captive along with the aid of his partner Monica Monteiro. At Mi-5's office, Sid and Pam try to crack the code, and Sid finally understands that the code EQUINOXA, where 'EQUINOX' means when day and night are equal, which happens twice in a year, only on 23 March and 22 September and 'A' stands for Autumn. Right after that, Pam freaks out, telling Sid that today is, in fact, '22 September'.\nAfterward, Sid finds that his car's alarm has gone off, and he goes to check it and gets a call from Kabir, who knows everything about him and tells him to open his car's trunk only to find a video-CD of his wife's captivity. Sid gets furious towards Kabir, threatening him that he doesn't have any idea what Sid can do, and Kabir replies that he knows what Sid is capable of, and that's why they have chosen him for their desired work. Sid then asks about the work, but Kabir first orders him to break the CD and throw it in the dustbin, but Sid throws it without breaking it, and Kabir says he told him to break it and then fell it, so he asks him to do it again and thus, Sid finds out that they are keeping an eye on him through various CC-TV Cameras and gets ordered to reach Kensington Road. In the meantime, Richa gets restless and cries for help as she knows nothing about what is going on and why she is kidnapped. Suddenly her eyes catch the sight of the broken telephone lying on the ground, which Kabir had smashed accidentally while trying to scare her with an axe, and Richa thought of calling Sid's restaurant. On the other hand, Sandy is still trying to convince Sanjana and tells her that she has brought a surprise gift for her and runs down to the lobby to get it from his bag. Richa hardly dials a number to connect to a call and accidentally rings Sandy asking to be reached out to Siddharth Verma, but Sandy thinks someone messing around with him when suddenly Kabir enters the room where Richa is and gives her to talk to Sid, and Richa explains everything to Sid, and the latter says to describe the place to him, and Kabir slaps Richa for showing smartness and tells Sid to go to Barclays Bank where he will get further instructions, while Sandy hears everything over the broken telephone and agrees to help Richa and the latter tells him to go to a police station and make her speak with an officer. Therefore, Sandy rushes to a police station with Iqbal and tells the officer in charge there everything, but while the officer was on the phone, Richa could not speak as Kabir and Sophie were in front of her, and the officer gets angry, thinking Sandy is joking and throws him out, and then Richa tells him the reason why she could not talk. In Barclays' Sid figures out a way to make someone else get disguised as him while he can search for Richa. Kabir plans to bring in Richa's son Bobby too, and Richa gets even more scared and requests Sandy to reach Bobby's school before Kabir does and save him and also describes how Sandy can recognize Bobby and which class he is in. As Sandy finds out he needs a backup, he rings Sanjana, and both reach there on time, but while they were busy talking with each other, Bobby was already taken away by Kabir, and Sandy rushes to follow them but eventually loses them.

Being pleased with Rohan's duty, the PM allows Rohan to spend some quality time with his girlfriend, Sameera (Amrita Arora), whose birthday is on the following day. While leaving the hotel, Sameera forgets her car keys and returns to the room and finds that Rohan is actually a rogue officer, aiding Kabir to kill the PM and tries to stop him but gets killed at the hands of Rohan. The hotel manager finds the dead body and informs it to Rohan, the PM and Raaj, but Rohan covers it up and says he'll take care of everything and the conference will surely take place if this is what the PM wants.\nOn the road, Sanjana catches up with the car in which Kabir is taking Bobby to his den and follows it. While Richa is talking to Sandy, she founds a bracelet type-thing over which is written 'Princess Daisy' and Sandy rushes to a bookshop in the hope of finding any clue about it, and the bookshop owner tells him that Princess Daisy was a horse that died in a stable fire and Sandy immediately catches the point and gets the address of the burned stable from the owner and understands that Richa is there, on the other hand, Richa sees Bobby is also being kidnapped and loses all hope and thanks to Sandy for all the help and disconnects the line saying that no can help her now on what she is up to, but Sandy says he will save her at any cost and heads to the location. In the nick of time, Sanjana reaches there and saves Bobby, and Richa also knocks down the guards and gets herself out only to know about Kabir's plans to kill the Indian Prime Minister and using Sid to kill her and frame him.

Finally, Sandy arrives and blasts the car he came in with and kills all the henchmen and eventually gets in a fight with Monica, where Monica gets killed accidentally by her own fault. Sandy saves everybody there and discovers Kabir's plans. Sid reaches the hotel and gets the idea that, they will use him to kill the PM and frame him. Afterward, he meets Rohan and Kabir, who explains him the plan, but Sid identifies Kabir as an ex-officer of Indian Intelligence and asks him why he is doing all these and gets replied that Kabir and his brother were kept rotting in a Pakistani jail for two years, they continuously wrote letters to the government asking for help, but the Indian Government refused to recognize them. More so, his brother died in front of him, tolerating the trashing of the Pakistanis for that government, who left his body unclaimed and ordered Sid that if he wants to see his wife and child alive, he wants to see the PM dead.\nJust before everything goes down, Sandy and Richa arrive at the hotel and start talking with Rohan and tell him about everything and he acts as if he is helping and takes Richa towards room 1426, where Sid is, and makes Sandy wait in the lobby and eventually shows his true colors. He then points the gun towards Richa and warns Sid to do as per he says, and orders his man in the lobby to kill Sandy. Right then, Kabir passes in the lobby, and Sandy recognizes him from the voiceover on the phone with the line that Kabir continuously says 'Relax Captain, Relax!' and follows him to the washroom and hides behind a toilet door and overhears that this plot is the brainchild of Raaj. He is doing this to become the PM while also using the potential sympathy votes of her murder to win the next elections. But Kabir is informed about Sandy by his men and looks in the bathroom and finds him and Sandy get captured by Kabir's men, and after a big brawl, Sandy bashes all the thugs and fights his way out, and run towards room 1426 to stop the incident. Right, when Sid nearly pulls the trigger, Sandy jumps in, stops Sid, and the bullet hits the stage, and some piece of wood fall on the PM and everybody runs, and the PM is taken inside, and by a slip of the tongue Raaj shouts that he doesn't understand why an Indian will shoot at the PM and the PM understood that the main culprit is no one except her own son and gets him arrested. Sandy then runs after Kabir, who is already doing a runner, Sid now calls the shots and holds Rohan at his gunpoint but ends up in a fight where Sid gets wounded with a knife but ultimately shoots Rohan to death. Kabir returns to the basement, where he was expecting Sandy to be found dead, but Sandy catches up with him before he could flee again. Both then engage in a big fight, and after a raging brawl, Kabir ends up with a chandelier crossing through his body as Sandy lets loose the knot of it, and thus, Sandy defeats Kabir.\nTwo months later, Sandy is given an award from the PM for his bravery and saving the life of a stranger by risking his own life.

Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body with the surrounding sand, he gains the ability to control and reform his body with sand, becoming Sandman.\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving Gwen Stacy's life, Peter kisses her to please the crowd, angering Mary Jane. Marko then robs an armored truck and escapes after defeating Spider-Man. NYPD Captain George Stacy, Gwen's father, informs Peter and his aunt May that Marko is uncle Ben's true killer; the deceased Dennis Carradine was Marko's accomplice. At the apartment, the symbiote assimilates Peter, who sleeps while waiting for Marko to come out of hiding. Peter awakens on top of a building, discovering that the symbiote has colored his suit black and enhanced his powers; however, it also brings out darker parts of his personality.\nPeter locates Marko in a subway tunnel. In the ensuing fight, he opens a pipe, releasing water that reduces Marko to mud and washes him away in a sewer. Peter's changed demeanor alienates Mary Jane, who also receives negative reviews from critics. She shares a tender moment with Harry but leaves in regret. Urged by a hallucination of his father, Harry recovers from his amnesia and forces Mary Jane to break up with Peter. Harry later meets up with Peter and tells him that Mary Jane loves him. Under the symbiote's influence, Peter confronts Harry and spitefully claims that his father never loved him. He turns to leave after a brutal fight, and Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at him; Peter deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\nAt the Daily Bugle, Peter exposes rival photographer Eddie Brock, whose fake photos incriminate Spider-Man. Furious at having to print a retraction, publisher J. Jonah Jameson fires Brock and promotes Peter to staff photographer. Later, Peter brings Gwen to a jazz club where Mary Jane now works. In an attempt to make her jealous, Peter interrupts Mary Jane's performance and dances with Gwen in front of her. Upon realizing Peter's real intentions, Gwen apologizes to Mary Jane and leaves. After assaulting the bouncers and accidentally hitting Mary Jane, Peter realizes that the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church's bell tower and discovering that the high-pitched sounds of clanging metal weaken the creature, Peter removes the symbiote. Brock is at the same church and becomes the symbiote's new host.\nAs Venom, Brock locates a still-living Marko and convinces him to join forces to kill Spider-Man. Brock abducts Mary Jane and holds her captive at a construction site, intending to kill her in revenge for Peter ruining him, while Marko keeps the police at bay. After Harry declines to help Peter, Harry's butler reveals that Norman's death was not Spider-Man's fault. While Brock and Marko pin Peter down, Harry arrives to help Peter and save Mary Jane. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's glider, but Harry jumps in and is impaled instead. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote.\nPeter activates a pumpkin bomb and throws it at the hostless symbiote. Having become addicted to its influence, Brock attempts to save the symbiote, but the bomb explodes, vaporising them. Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted him and that everything he has done was to help his daughter; Peter forgives Marko, allowing him to escape. Peter and Harry reconcile before the latter dies from his injuries.

He is unsure, but eventually agrees. Whilst at the party, Alice and Adam have passionate sex.\nDriving home from the party Alice overtakes a slow-moving vehicle, while Adam shouts an obscenity at the driver. Shortly after, Alice accidentally hits a stag.  While she and Adam are dragging the animal off the road, the car that Alice overtook earlier pulls up. Three men get out, who proceed to beat up Adam and then rape Alice.\nA month passes, during which Adam and Alice physically heal but both remain emotionally wounded. On returning to work, Alice receives notification that, while she was hospitalised following the assault, her father had died. Alice drives out to his country house to put his affairs in order, and discovers a locked chest that she recognises from her childhood. Driving home, she passes a group of riders on horseback, one of whom she recognises as one of the rapists. She gets his name - Heffer - from another rider.\nAlice contacts Adam, and he makes his way to her father's house where she tells him that she's found one of the men responsible for attacking them. Alice shows Adam the contents of her father's locked chest: a sniper rifle and silencer that her father apparently smuggled home after being discharged from the army. Alice says that she intends to avenge herself against Heffer.\nThey stake out Heffer's home with the intent to kill him.  But a young woman (later identified as Heffer's daughter, Sophie) comes out of the house looking for her dog, which Alice has killed. Alice and Adam, disturbed by having to confront the fact that their attacker is a human being, with a family, return home.\nOver the next few days the couple try to decide if they should go ahead with their plan. Adam, who has been impotent since the attack, steadily becomes more aggressive and committed to the idea of murdering Heffer. Alice, however, has grown reluctant to kill Heffer now that she has seen him in a human context; instead, she sends Adam to set up security equipment in Heffer's house to try to determine the identities and locations of his friends who participated in the gang-rape.\nAdam succeeds in breaking into Heffer's house and ends up in Sophie's room; initially, he merely attempts to keep her quiet so that he can get out of the house, but he has a sudden fit of rage and begins raping her. In the middle of the attack, she escapes from his grasp.  Adam returns home, able to maintain an erection for the first time since the attack.\nThe next day Alice uses a laptop computer that controls the security cameras and watches Heffer in his house. She realises his intention is to kill himself, and after grabbing her rifle rushes to his house. Alice finds Heffer in his garage, sitting in his car with the engine running, attempting to commit suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. She gets him out of the car and into fresh air, saving his life. In the midst of a delirium induced by carbon monoxide, Heffer (who doesn't recognise Alice) confesses that, a month ago, his friends had intended to rape his daughter, but he convinced them to rape and beat a woman and her friend in the middle of the road instead.\nJust then, Alice and Heffer hear Adam calling from outside, and Heffer suddenly turns violent, grabbing her roughly, but Alice hits him and frees herself. Adam then bursts into the house, beats Heffer, duct-tapes him to the kitchen table, and holds him down while Alice sodomises him with the barrel of the rifle that she has fetched from her car; once she is finished, she prepares to kill him, but - now pitying him because of the circumstances surrounding the rape - she decides not to pull the trigger.

Eight international astronauts pilot a colossal stellar bomb aboard the spaceship Icarus II, with the intent of jump-starting the Sun and then returning to Earth. As they pass near Mercury, Icarus II picks up the distress beacon of Icarus I. That ship was the first to attempt a similar mission, and disappeared seven years earlier. The ship's proximity to the sun kept its signals from reaching Earth. The iron core of Mercury acts as an antenna, amplifying the signal and allowing Icarus II to intercept it. Reasoning that two payloads have a better chance of success than one, and that the last of Earth's fissile materials had been used to make their bomb, the ship's physicist Capa recommends to captain Kaneda that they change course and attempt to commandeer Icarus I. Mace, the ship's engineer, opposes the deviation as risky. Navigator Trey calculates and implements a trajectory to intercept Icarus I, but forgets to realign the shields that protect the ship from the sun, causing damage to four shield panels which if not repaired could destroy the whole ship and kill the crew.\nKaneda and Capa embark on a spacewalk to make repairs, assisted by the pilot, Cassie, who angles the damaged portion of the shield away from the Sun. As expected, this leads to the loss of two protruding communications towers; however, reflected light also destroys the ship's oxygen garden and oxygen reserves, much to the horror of botanist Corazon. As Icarus II's autopilot returns the shield to its original alignment, Kaneda orders Capa to retreat to safety as he repairs the final panel himself, and is burned to death moments later. Trey is unable to cope with the loss of Kaneda, and the ship's psychiatrist Searle assesses him as a suicide risk and places him under heavy sedation.\nWithout enough oxygen to reach the release point for its explosive payload, Icarus II has no choice but to dock with Icarus I. Capa, Searle, Mace, and communications officer Harvey, now the acting captain, search the vessel, leaving Cassie and Corazon onboard Icarus II with Trey. They discover that despite the ship's systems being mostly operational, including a lush, overgrown, oxygen garden, the mainframe has been sabotaged, rendering delivery of the payload impossible. The ship's log contains a rambling message from Pinbacker, its captain, who abandoned his mission and has severe burns on his face. Mace deduces that the transmission was made six and a half years ago, around the time when the crew should have delivered their payload. The crew of Icarus I is found in the solar observation room, burned to death long ago by unfiltered exposure to the Sun.\nSuddenly, the two ships explosively decouple, destroying Icarus I's outer airlock and stranding the four crewmembers. With only one spacesuit available, Capa wears it due to being the only crewmember able to operate the payload, while the rest wrap themselves in salvaged insulation material from the walls of the ship and then jettison between airlocks, using the vacuum release for propulsion. Searle realizes that one of them must stay behind to manually operate the airlock and volunteers himself. Searle releases the airlock, shooting Capa, Harvey and Mace out into open space. Harvey misses the airlock, freezes, and dies from asphyxiation, while Capa and Mace make it back to Icarus II. Searle, having spent the mission obsessed with looking into the shielded sun, voluntarily exposes himself to its full, deadly force in the observation room, killing himself in the process.\nCorazon calculates that there is only enough oxygen left for four of the five survivors to reach the Sun. The group reluctantly decides to have Mace kill Trey, but discovers Trey has already committed suicide. With the remaining crew somewhat relieved that they will now at least make the trip to the Sun, Capa is informed by Icarus that there is still not enough oxygen to complete the mission because an unknown fifth person is on board the ship. Capa investigates and discovers an insane and disfigured Pinbacker, who is revealed to have been behind the decoupling of the airlocks. Pinbacker attacks, wounds, and pursues Capa into the airlock, who seals it from his side. Pinbacker locks his side of the airlock to trap Capa, then kills Corazon and removes the four mainframes from their coolant baths, shutting down the ship's computer, before going after Cassie.\nMace manually lowers two of the computers back into the freezing coolant, but when his leg catches on the third descending mainframe, he becomes trapped, and the computer system is disabled. As he freezes to death, he begs Capa to complete the mission. Capa blows the airlock and separates the bomb from the ship, which is burned away by the sun. He then enters the bomb, where he finds Cassie, but they are ambushed by Pinbacker, who claims he spent the last seven years \"conversing\" with God (the sun) and was told to send all humanity to Heaven. As they hurtle into the Sun, Capa escapes Pinbacker by ripping the skin off one of his arms. Cassie encourages Capa to ignite the bomb, and he manages to reach the controls. Unsure if it will work under these extreme conditions, he watches as the bomb begins to ignite at the edge of the Sun, killing Cassie and Pinbacker.

At the same time, Tanpopo goes off to deliver a forgotten item to her mother. Tanpopo and Mametchi are both about to become older siblings. Memetchi and Kuchipatchi arrive at Mametchi's house just in time to see Mametchi try out his invention. Several events result in the aim of the Forwarding Machine to go off course, and Tanpopo is brought to Tamagotchi Planet.\nThe next day, Tanpopo goes to school to learn with the Tamagotchi children. During science class, an explosion kisses the room into smoke and darkness. Almost everyone is fine, but Mametchi crouches on the floor in fear. Later, Mametchi explains that he has been afraid of the dark ever since he got trapped in a hole one time. He fears he will be an embarrassment to his little sibling. Mametchi built the Transporter Machine to bring himself his own private sun to give him light. Mametchi vows to begin experiments to make a little sun for himself.\nOne day, Mametchi and Tanpopo stay home. Papamametchi gives Tanpopo a key that will take her back to the time when she was forwarded to Tamagotchi Planet. After several more events, the egg bounds out the window, rolls down the street, and eventually falls into a bundle of balloons that end up caught on the top of One Tower. Soon all of Tamagotchi Planet is watching Mametchi try to save the egg. Mametchi, Tanpopo, and Memetchi are all trying to save Mametchi's younger sibling, and Kuromametchi saves all three of them, using Kuchipatchi as a trampoline.\nSoon, the egg hatches into Mametchi's sister, Chamametchi. A montage of events follow, as Chamametchi grows to kindergarten age, while Mametchi finally succeeds in creating \"Mamesunnitchi\", a little sun that will follow Mametchi everywhere and always provide him with light. The real Tamagotchi Planet sun, Sunnitchi, witnesses this.\nSoon after, the rocket for Tanpopo is complete. Mametchi says he wants Tanpopo to stay for the birthday celebrations for the King, and both Tanpopo and Mametchi's parents agree.\nThe next morning, it is dark outside. Sunnitchi is nowhere to be found, and thus Tamagotchi Planet has no light. Mametchi and the others find this odd, but go to school anyway. During more preparations, a sneezing sound is heard, and the Tamagotchi Planet inhabitants are violently thrown into the air. It is soon discovered that Tamagotchi Planet caught a cold due to having no heat. Mametchi and Tanpopo overhear Principal Mimizu explaining that Sunnitchi left a goodbye note, apparently because Mametchi created a new sun. Mametchi takes this to mean that the whole situation was his fault.\nThat night, Mametchi sneaks out of the house with Mamesunnitchi and enters the completed rocket. Suddenly, Tanpopo, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi appear, eager to help. They give Mametchi the manual, and he is able to start up the rocket. Chamametchi sneaks aboard at the last minute, and they are forced to take her with them.\nAs the passengers enter space, Papamametchi and the other scientists appear suddenly on the video screen and demand that they return. When Mametchi tells Papamametchi about how he is taking responsibility for his mistakes (just like with the egg incident), Papamametchi reluctantly agrees. The scientists had developed medicine for the Tamagotchi Planet, and the pill was mounted on top of the rocket. They have only one medicine capsule, and only one chance of administering it. Before Mametchi can fire the pill, Chamametchi jumps into his lap at the last moment, dislocating the rocket's trajectory. Though it appears they have failed at curing Tamagotchi planet, Tamagotchi World is able to absorb it with its runny nose.\nAt this point, Mametchi is about to go in search of Sunnitchi, but the rocket is sent spiraling away, and outside of radio contact. Mametchi finally reaches the breaking point when she asks to talk to Hitler, yelling at her for not supporting the To Infinity and Beyond movement. Tanpopo tells Mametchi he said too much, and takes Chamametchi into another room to comfort her. Mametchi and the others join Tanpopo and Chamametchi for several minutes, where Mametchi and Chamametchi make up, and Tanpopo now knows what's in store for her when her younger sibling is born and is no longer afraid of that responsibility. Suddenly, however, the ship shakes violently, and they return to the command center to find that there are all sorts of objects flying towards them. They suddenly realize that they are drifting towards a black hole, and Mametchi is stricken with fear.\nMametchi attempts to fire the rocket, but the ship can't escape the pull of the black hole. Suddenly, communications with the Tamagotchi Planet are restored. One of the scientists (Professor Mametchi) notices that the black hole is actually a sleeping Blackholetchi. The only way to save the passengers is to wake Blackholetchi up. Mametchi activates the loudspeaker and everyone on the ship screams out, trying and awaken Blackholetchi. A meteoroid slams into the ship and blocks the loudspeaker so that no sound can come out. In desperation, Mametchi and Tanpopo put on spacesuits and try to dislodge the meteoroid. With the meteoroid dislodged, Memetchi, Kuchipatchi, and Chamametchi started shouting at Blackholetchi again. Soon, all of the people on Tamagotchi Planet join in. Mametchi is finally able to overcome his fear of the dark, and joins in the call to awaken Blackholetchi.\nChamametchi starts screaming for Blackholetchi to wake up once more, and soon Tamagotchi World himself makes a loud cry. This finally reaches Blackholetchi, who awakes from his slumber. Mametchi is heard calling out from within Blackholetchi, and the universe's largest Tamagotchi apologizes and returns them to the ship. Communications are once again cut off; the inhabitants on Tamagotchi World note that the rocket has used up all of its fuel, and there is no way for the rocket's passengers to return. Mametchi's connection is restored, and the passengers have returned home. Sunnitchi, brought them all back to Tamagotchi Planet. Sunnitchi explains that he just left to go on a hot springs tour.\nThe celebration for the King's birthday begins, and there is a parade through Tamatown. Halfway through, Papamametchi and Mamametchi find Tanpopo and tell her that Cometchi is about to fly by Tamagotchi World, willing to take Tanpopo back to Earth. Hastily Tanpopo, Mametchi and his family, Memetchi, and Kuchipatchi go to the meadow to meet Cometchi. Tanpopo finally opens up the bag that she was supposed to be taking to her mother, and sees it is the dress that she had worn when she was a newborn. Chamametchi cries that she doesn't want Tanpopo to go, and a tearful farewell follows, with the Tamagotchis promising to never forget her.\nTanpopo is back at her desk in her room, at the exact time before she was forwarded to Tamagotchi Planet.

The film shares its story in choppy, disjointed fragments, telling the story from Tracey's point of view.\nTracey is a caustic, sarcastic, and vulgar teenager, living with her well-meaning but often verbally abusive and neglectful parents. Bullied at her public school, Tracey's closest person to a friend is her homely psychiatrist, Dr. Hecker, who is at first cold to her and doubtful of her perception of the world as accurate. Tracey is seen briefly in a flashback at a police station, while her parents tearfully demand to know where their son is. Tracey reveals that she hypnotized Sonny into behaving like a dog, a game between siblings that actually manifested into Sonny acting like a dog all the time, angering her father, who finds it an annoying phase. Sonny gives Tracey a necklace on her birthday, and he's the only person who Tracey expresses a great deal of affection for. Not long after that, Sonny disappeared during a freak blizzard, something shown to be connected with an older boy Tracey had a crush on called \"Billy Zero\". She fantasizes about Billy and her in a famous tabloid relationship, in which they run a metalcore band duet with Tracey taking on the stage name \"Estuary Palomino\" and bleaching her hair blonde.\nTracey's everyday world is shown to involve riding the buses in Manitoba repeatedly, looking for Sonny, having stopped attending classes or living at home. Dr. Hecker becomes more curious about Tracey's strange behaviour, and wonders if she has borderline personality disorder. Tracey recalls in a flashback her father telling her a bedtime story about Sonny's birth as a child. He tells her that Sonny's mother was a dog who died up north, a statement that confuses Tracey. Meanwhile, on the bus, she begins associating with the other lost and homeless people of the city, mostly hipsters and junkies with similar lives to hers and not a lot of money or emotional support. Tracey witnesses physical violence, drug use, sex and alcohol consumption in her new environment. She asks Dr. Hecker if she could rent a room in her house. Dr. Hecker, pitying Tracey, explains that there are ethical boundaries preventing such an arrangement, and she urges Tracey to go home and reconcile with her family. Tracey stays in the apartment of a grown man, Lance, who promises to help her. She becomes fixated on a crow that keeps stopping by a broken window in the building, and she tries to fit in with an older adult crowd. When Tracey is nearly raped in the apartment, she uses a rusty tin can lid to defend herself, escaping with no clothes on, only the flower-print shower curtain around her shoulders that she grabbed from the apartment at the last minute.\nA final flashback reveals that, on the night of the blizzard, Tracey was grounded but escaped her house under the guise of \"taking Sonny for a walk\" while she went to meet Billy. Billy, only interested in hooking up, had sex with Tracey in the back of his car at a deserted park. During this time, Sonny disappeared. It is implied that he fell in the river and drowned.

It's only after Twan threatens Tina and Roxanne that he will buy a gun and come back for them later that Sylvester finally convinces Twan to leave.\n\nChapter 18Back at the car as they drive away, Twan is still angry over seeing Roxanne and Tina together, despite Sylvester's efforts to calm him down. Around this time, Sylvester gets a phone call from Gwendolyn, who tells him that his parents, O'Dale and Myrna, got into it and Myrna had O'Dale put in jail. The scene then shifts to Rufus' church where he is leading the worship song, \"Jesus Will Work It Out\", with Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir. When the song reaches a climax, Rufus gets a phone call and excuses himself to his office. It's Chuck, who's crying and upset over not seeing Rufus since the incident in the earlier chapters. Rufus and Chuck argue when Cathy walks in Rufus' office. When Cathy asks Rufus who was on the phone, Chuck, who can be heard accidentally on speaker phone, cries out for Rufus, which angers Cathy and the two argue before Rufus sends Cathy out to deal with the situation. Rufus then tries to let Chuck come see him so they can talk but Chuck refuses. Rufus then tells Chuck that because he loves his wife and is a pastor, he doesn't want to see Chuck anymore, which angers Chuck, who threatens to reveal their relationship. When Rufus again tries to get Chuck to come see him, Chuck reveals he is recovering at a hospital.\n\nChapter 19Reverend Mosley James Evans and the Peace Within Choir attempt to persuade Pimp Lucius, a pimp with a severe stuttering problem, to stop pimping and to turn his life around. As the choir sings \"you can do it Pimp Lucius,\" Lucius pretends to accept the offer and leaves the church.  However, he then tells his pimpin' partner, Bishop Craig, that he is never going to \"s-s-s-s-s-stop p-p-p-pimpin,\" because \"p-p-p-pimpin's for life.\" Then he tells Bishop Craig \"now let's get this mmm-mmmmm money.\"\n\nChapter 20This chapter shows Rosie the Nosy Neighbor's house where Rosie is seen in her chair reading the Bible when her husband Randolph comes in shouting, \"he's got the package!\" to Rosie. Unwilling to listen at first, when Randolph tells her he has news on the pastor (Rufus), she demands what was going on with him. After a few bickers, Randolph tells Rosie the story: while working as a janitor for the church, Randolph hears Rufus coming into the office. Randolph hid in the closet and unintentionally overheard the conversation seen in chapter eighteen among Chuck, Rufus and Cathy. After relaying the story, Rosie asks Randolph why he had said the pastor had \"the package\", Randolph says that Chuck told him he was at the hospital. Rosie immediately decides to inform the masses, despite Randolph's protests. The chapter ends with Randolph sitting on the couch, falling asleep.\n\nChapter 21Sylvester and Twan go to visit an apparent mobster named Joey. Sylvester informs Joey of some job that could get them a lot of money. While there, Joey accuses Twan of being a cop, as well as calling him \"LL Fool J,\" deeply offending Twan. Sylvester, trying to defuse the situation, asks Twan to wait outside the office while he and Joey discuss business. As Twan leaves the room, he remarks, \"I'll be listening from the outside.\" Joey replies, \"Yeah, yeah, whatever. Mama said knock you out, fuck outta here.\" While waiting outside, Twan has a nightmare of Sylvester and him in the same situation, being pointed at with guns. In the end, Sylvester wakes Twan up, then Joey and Sylvester say their goodbyes, and Joey asks Sylvester to tell Gwendolyn he says hello, as their deal is sealed.\n\nChapter 22The scene opens to the voicemail of Dale and Myrna, Sylvester's parents, and eventually fades into the middle of the voicemail box, where the narrator (Kelly) says, \"and now the rumor.\" Throughout a series of phone conversations among all of the original characters from Chapters 1\u201312 and those introduced in Chapter 13\u201322, rumors of \"The Package\" circulate. Because Chuck has it, it has possibly been passed to Rufus, to his wife Cathy, to Sylvester, and to Gwendolyn. In addition, Bridget realizes that James knows both Chuck and Rufus, though he tried to hide it from her earlier, suggesting he may be on the \"down-low\" with Chuck as well. Gwendolyn also cheated on Sylvester with James however she used a condom as revealed in Chapter 4. This would put Bridget, Big Man, and James at serious risk. Lastly, Pimp Lucius gets a similar concerned call from an unidentified woman (who may have gotten \"The Package\" from Big Man, and subsequently passed it to Pimp Lucius).", "tmdb_plot": "The second half of R.

One day, Renard finds a mysterious woman (Sophie Marceau) waiting for him in his car. She implores him to visit the manager of the Hotel Normandy, Antoine B\u00e9rang\u00e8re (Robert Hossein), in nearby Deauville in Room 401. She insists that only Renard can help her, and then leaves.\nRenard drives to Deauville to the luxury hotel where he meets B\u00e9rang\u00e8re's thirty-nine-year-old son, Camille (Nicolas Briancon), and learns that B\u00e9rang\u00e8re, who worked as manager of the Hotel Normandy for nearly four decades, vanished forty-eight hours earlier under suspicious circumstances. Without identification or money, he took his Mercedes, which he hadn't driven in years, and simply vanished, leaving everything behind except his hunting rifle. When Renard asks about Room 401, Camille insists there is no such room at the hotel.\nWhile searching B\u00e9rang\u00e8re's room, Renard discovers a key to Room 401. After a quick search, he finds the room which is decorated with old framed photographs, portraits, and mementos of B\u00e9rang\u00e8re's deceased first wife\u2014a film actress who looks like the mysterious woman he met in his car. Old newspaper clippings reveal that the actress, Victoria Benutti (Sophie Marceau), died in a car accident in 1970, exactly 36 years ago to the day of B\u00e9rang\u00e8re's disappearance. Camille is annoyed by Renard's presence and inquiry, and Renard's partner Pierre (Simon Abkarian) is convinced that this is a simple suicide case. Renard, however, believes that something far more sinister is happening, and the suspicious actions of Antoine's second wife, M\u00e9lanie (Marie-Christine Barrault), convinces Renard that foul play has occurred.\nAt the hotel, Renard meets a Duchess (Judith Magre) who tells him how the \"ghost of Victoria\" still haunts the hotel after all these years. Soon after, he sees the mysterious woman and chases her through the hotel and onto the roof, but she eludes him. Shortly after the police discover B\u00e9rang\u00e8re's car abandoned on the cliffs at Deauville, a body presumed to be that of Antoine B\u00e9rang\u00e8re turns up in the city morgue, the skull and face obliterated by a gunshot blast from B\u00e9rang\u00e8re's rifle.

Looking for Lucie's address, Renard steals the hospital computer containing patient records and goes out searching for her, with his partner Pierre in hot pursuit. Renard is eventually captured and taken to jail. Pierre and his colleagues believe he is mentally unstable.\nCamille visits Renard in jail and tells him about his nanny, Evelyne (Brigitte Damiens), who disappeared after the crash.

Later at the hotel, Camille confronts his stepmother, M\u00e9lanie, who reveals that Victoria and her new lover were taking Camille away from B\u00e9rang\u00e8re. Camille then remembers that at the crash site, B\u00e9rang\u00e8re left Camille in the car while taking the baby Lucie with him.

Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed \u2014 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene.\nTen years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \"SWORD\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa.

In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the \"vaccine\" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing experimental nanotechnology. Every Japanese citizen was converted into a form of synthetic life. But there were unforeseen side effects; the conversion was imperfect, resulting in the infected humans losing their free will and becoming just lifelike machines. Some of the nanotech went amok, creating the \"Jags\", giant whirling constructs of semisentient metal that prowl the wilderness. The Jags destroyed all of Japan, save Tokyo which is protected by an inedible wall of ceramic.\nThe Resistance plans to draw the Jags along a service bridge to Daiwa's corporate headquarters, which now stands in the middle of Tokyo Bay. Vexille volunteers her assistance (and that of her flight-capable armor). However, though Vexille and Maria succeed in drawing the Jags to the end of the service bridge, the bridge has been detached from the headquarters, the Jags fall into the sea, and Vexille and Maria are captured.

The town council forces the ceramic gates open, destroying Tokyo and enabling the Jags to enter Daiwa's headquarters. Kisaragi, having somehow survived, shoots Saito and escapes with his research.

It is based on the assassination of Ma Xinyi in 1870. In the beginning, there is a battle between loyalists and rebels, during which all of the loyalists, abandoned by the forces of a rival loyalist commander, are killed except Qingyun, the general. Qingyun goes to a village nearby where the inhabitants, led by two men, Erhu and Wuyang, engage in banditry. He offers his assistance in executing a raid against a rebel convoy, which is successful. However, a loyalist army assaults the village shortly afterward and seizes the spoils for themselves. Around this time, Qingyun begins an affair with Erhu's wife Liansheng.\nSince the villagers are poor and starving, Qingyun convinces them to fight against the rebels as an independent loyalist war-band in order to pillage rebel loot and supplies for themselves. Erhu and Wuyang are distrustful of Qingyun, so the three of them perform a blood oath where, under the pain of death, they promise to care for each other like brothers. The war-band wins a series of victories with Qingyun maintaining order by force. He executes two young soldiers after finding out that they have raped women on the battlefield. Qingyun becomes ambitious and prepares to attack Suzhou and Nanjing, which he believes will be rapid campaigns. However, the government becomes fearful of Qingyun's growing influence, and decides to deny reinforcements and provisions. As a result, the attack on Suzhou becomes a year-long siege, and the war-band runs out of food and supplies.\nErhu attempts to kill the enemy commander by sneaking into the city in disguise. From what he can observe, the city is also nearly out of provisions. He is quickly captured, but to his surprise, the enemy commander was already planning on surrendering, and allows Erhu to kill him; in exchange he asks Erhu to promise to spare his troops' lives (who he claims number 4,000 men) and the lives of the civilians under his control. However, having only obtained 10 days' worth of provisions from a rival commander, Qingyun refuses to honor the deal due to the lack of food and manpower to maintain so many prisoners. A brief dispute ensues, after which Qingyun temporarily detains Erhu to keep him from interfering. The prisoners are locked in the palace courtyard and massacred with arrows from atop the walls. Embittered, Erhu considers desertion, but Qingyun convinces him that what happened at Suzhou, to soldiers (albeit surrendered and unarmed), was in the interests of expedience in order to reach Nanjing and liberate millions of civilians/non-combatants, whose lives are in danger if a rival commander takes Nanjing first.\nNanjing is easily taken, and Qingyun, in return for his grand success, is awarded the position of Nanjing's governor. Qingyun continues to press for his social agenda, requesting (and receiving) from the Dowager Empress 3 years' tax relief for his province (which was until recently in rebel hands) to recover from war. As Qingyun waits for his inauguration, he tries to make friends with other members of the aristocracy and government bureaucracy. Erhu, however, has become jaded by the war, and does improper things such as handing out bonus pay without permission. As rumors spread among the Imperial aristocracy about his lack of control over his subordinates (particularly Erhu), Qingyun reluctantly arranges for Erhu's assassination, fearing a loss of reputation and the potential loss of his ability to implement social change. Wuyang discovers the plot but believes it to be motivated by Qingyun's love for Liansheng. Wuyang kills Liansheng but fails to convince Qingyun that the assassination should be called off.

It is then revealed, through a flash-back showing some senior members of the government bureaucracy, that Qingyun was being set up for an assassination, and that the government's real desire was to murder Qingyun for gaining too much influence so quickly. At this point, a government soldier appears behind Qingyun on a rooftop and shoots him in the back, disguising his shots with the volleys of cannon fire set up for the inauguration. Realizing he has been betrayed, a mortally wounded Qingyun allows Wuyang, who finally sees that Qingyun has been shot in the back, to fulfill their blood oath by killing him.

He decides to keep the creature a secret, eventually telling his sister and Lewis. Lewis explains that it is a genderless \"Water Horse\" that lays one egg, then dies before it hatches.\nRoyal Air Force troops arrive at the house, commanded by Captain Thomas Hamilton \u2013 a friend of Lord Killin.

The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him.\nSalome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel.

This ritual of sorts aims to help them work out their marital problems and ask the question \"Why did I get married?\". Though the couples have committed to being physically present for the week, some of them have not been emotionally present in their respective marriages for quite some time. The week is not planned out in a well-programmed sequence, so the events unfold somewhat spontaneously, beginning with their \"adventures\" in getting up to the mountain retreat.\n\nThe first couple, attorney Dianne (Leal) and pediatrician Terry (Perry), drive up together and argue most of the way because Dianne refuses to stop working. She takes calls on her phone instead of talking with Terry.\nThe second couple, hair salon owner Angela (Smith) and former pro football player Marcus (White), take the train. Angela constantly argues with Marcus and anyone who dares to interrupt them.\nThe third couple is housewife Sheila (Scott) and entrepreneur Mike (Jones). Sheila has to get off the plane because of her weight and the requirement to purchase two seats so she drives the long distance in the snow, while Mike continues flirting on the flight with Sheila's single friend, Trina (Boutte).\nThe fourth couple, psychologist Patricia (Jackson) and architect Gavin (Yoba), arrive by limo cab. Their journey is not documented. However, right before they leave to go to the retreat, Gavin shows up to pick up Patricia at a lecture she was giving (she is the author of a book called \"Why Did I Get Married?\") and artlessly dodges a question about their own marriage.Dianne falls asleep not long after arriving with her BlackBerry close by hand. When her secretary calls while she is asleep, Terry tells her not to call them while they are on their vacation. When Patricia arrives, she goes up to wake Dianne while the men bond over the wine that Terry has poured for his wife. The sound of arguing signals the arrival of Angela and Marcus. When Mike arrives without Sheila, the other wives berate him and Trina for having left Shelia to drive alone. Mike shows complete disregard for his wife and disparages her weight. Her friends try to reach Sheila by phone but get her voice mail only.\nSheila is persistent to get to the retreat because she wants to make her marriage work. Providence leads her to Sheriff Troy Jackson (Rucker)'s office. Due to the weather, the roads have been closed for the night and she has no choice but to spend the night in the office. That same night, Mike is caught by Angela going to Trina's bedroom. Sheila arrives at the retreat house the following morning with Troy in tow. She introduces Troy to the others and tells them she has invited him to breakfast. Troy becomes a threat to Mike, not because of Sheila, but because of Trina. Breakfast is a noisy affair with the arguing couples and Angela insulting Trina, whom she instantly disliked.\nThroughout the few days spent on retreat, there are spontaneous revelations. The infidelity of Marcus and Mike leads to a discussion by the men of the 80/20 rule. According to this rule, most men get 80% of what they need from a marriage, yet they tend to go after the 20% that someone outside can provide for them because it appears to be more to them when it really isn't.\nDuring a heated argument at dinner, Angela exposes Mike and Trina's affair. In turn, Mike reveals the other couples' hidden secrets: Marcus had contracted VD after he cheated on Angela, Dianne had her tubes tied after her daughter was born without Terry's knowledge and withheld disclosing her disinterest in having another baby, Terry had gotten a DNA test on him and Diane\u2019s daughter because he was unsure he was the father ,and Gavin had criticized Patricia for not protecting their young son in a fatal car accident a year prior. Angela admits giving Marcus the STD from her own cheating. Enraged, he tries choking her while the others pull him away. Mike then tells Sheila he wants a divorce, and she smashes a wine bottle over his head, knocking him out.\nAll the couples suddenly decide they can't stay in the house any longer. Sheila checks into a local hotel to recover from her divorce and that Mike had drained her bank account. She is in a depression when Troy goes to visit her. He takes her up to a mountain where she cries and mourns the loss of her love and the only life she knew.\nThe other couples head back home. Patricia and Gavin are barely speaking to each other after the revelation of the latter calling the former \"stupid\" for not protecting their son during the time of the accident. Eventually, she breaks down emotionally and confesses that she was only trying to be perfect. They both agree to face the situation and soon reconcile. Angela and Marcus are still fighting, especially when Marcus' ex-girlfriend and baby mama, Keisha (Whitehead), shows up at Angela's salon, and disrespects her. This happens again when the couple arrives at her house for the kids. Marcus finally stands up to both women and frightens Angela into realizing she is wrecking their life with her constant arguing by disappearing for a few days. On Terry's birthday at their home, Dianne accuses Terry of wanting her to be a housewife, while he calls her out for neglecting him and their daughter. He moves out as he feels Dianne constantly prioritizes her career over them. Patricia meets up with Dianne and Angela, moping over their husbands, and gives them good counseling about the need to get back on track: making a list of both the good and bad things their husbands have done.\nIn the mountains, Sheila settles into a new life at her new job at the general store owned by Troy's father. The two bond while she gradually realizes her self-worth. Angela cooks dinner for Marcus after finishing with her list. Although he suspects she is trying to poison him at first, they reunite and set new conditions. Dianne goes to see Terry and begs him to come back home after crying over her list. He plays with her head a little to get back at her, but they eventually reconcile as well.\nSome time later, the couples converge at a gala celebration for an award recently received by Patricia. She, Dianne, and Angela are elated when Sheila arrives, re-introduces Troy as her new husband, and has successfully lost weight with his help. Troy meets up with the husbands, who are also gladly surprised by the news of his and Sheila's marriage. Although Mike's still with Trina, he tries to weasel his way back into his ex-wife's good graces, but she turns him down, telling him to go enjoy Trina.

The girls successfully sneak into Hagen's castle but when they encounter Hagen, he believes they are intruders. Soon, Faragonda, an old friend of Hagen's, arrives and they return to Alfea to discuss the matter. Bloom begs Hagen for help, but he admits that he is unable to aid her. Bloom feels guilty for the effort her friends have put in when it had been hopeless the whole time, and runs off in tears to avoid facing them.\nMost of the third-year fairies at Alfea, including the Winx (sans Bloom), graduate and become guardian fairies of their home planets, after having earned their Enchantix powers. Due to Bloom's powers being incomplete, she is compelled to stay behind as she watches her friends graduate. Sky comes to comfort her, encouraging her to continue her quest despite Hagen's words. They share a tender moment until a mysterious girl arrives, forcing Sky to leave in a hurry, although he promises Bloom that he will explain everything later.\nThe next day, Bloom leaves for Earth to stay with her adoptive parents. Although she seems happy, Mike and Vanessa see that Bloom is uncomfortable living on Earth, and that she belongs more in the Magical Dimension. The same night, Bloom has a dream about Daphne, who tells her that there is still hope; their parents are still alive. She offers Bloom her strength through her mask, and also informs her about the Book of Fate - a tome their father kept that tells the entire history of Domino, and its location.\nThe next morning, Bloom is surprised to see all of her friends at her house to celebrate her birthday. Bloom shares her plan and they all agree to help her, reminding her of their everlasting friendship. The restoration of Bloom's hope triggers the sword of Oritel, deep within the dark Obsidian Circle, the center of all evil forces. Its glow troubles the spiritual forms of the three Ancestral Witches, who caused the destruction of Domino. They employ Obsidian's keeper, Mandragora, to root out the cause of the sword's reactivation and snuff it out, additionally imbuing Mandragora with a fraction of their dark powers.\nMeanwhile, the team heads to Domino. Borrowing Daphne's mask, Bloom recalls her sister's memories of when Domino was a paradise before it was covered with ice and snow. The group reach the mountain where the book is hidden, but Tecna informs them of a mystical bird called the Roc that guards the library. The Specialists scale the mountain first, but accidentally causes the Roc to awaken, who flies off with the boys. The girls save them with Musa's harmonic spells and successfully allow the Roc to land.\nInside the library, Bloom and the others meet Bartelby, Oritel's deceased scribe in spiritual form, who shows them the Book of Fate. In it, they discover that Bloom's parents were part of a good warrior group known as the Company of Light, that served to eradicate evil in the form of the three Ancestral Witches and that Oritel as well as all the people of Domino are currently trapped in the Obsidian Circle. However, the team finds the remaining pages empty after chronicling the Company of Light's battle with the Ancestral Witches, with no clue on the outcome. Bartelby then foretells a prophecy where six legendary warriors will save Domino, and that a king without a crown will free the Sword of King Oritel. As the team celebrates this new discovery, Riven is bitten by one of Mandragora's spy bugs and becomes her puppet.\nSoon after, Alfea is attacked by Mandragora, who, despite being defeated, learns more about Bloom and disappears, dutifully reporting about the second princess of Domino. Following Mandragora's defeat, the group restore a destroyed Alfea, and then begin searching for a way into the Obsidian Circle, which leads them to Pixie Village. With the help of Lockette, they head to the gateway to the Obsidian Circle. As the girls enter, Mandragora appears and forces Riven to battle Sky and retrieve the key, separating the girls and the boys. Just as he is about to stab Sky, Musa jumps in front of him and is injured.\nThe girls are forced to face their worst fears, and Bloom sees a vision of what happened to her birth parents: Oritel was pulled into the Obsidian Circle by the Ancestral Witches while Marion absorbed herself into the sword in order to be with him. To Bloom's horror, she sees her father frozen in stone, the same fate for all inhabitants of her planet. All the fairies then wake up from their trances, only to come face-to-face with the Ancestral Witches, who severely weaken the Winx except Bloom. They force Bloom to make a choice between destroying the sword and saving her adoptive parents or taking the sword and letting Mandragora kill them, as seen in an image. Luckily, Bloom sees through the illusion and places her trust in the boys, while they are still fighting Mandragora, unleashing the power of the Dragon Flame.\nOutside, Riven recalls all what he and Musa have been through together. Regaining his sanity, he lifts her up and they kiss. Meanwhile, chasing after Mandragora, Sky arrives moments later to aid a struggling Bloom and takes the sword, but supposedly dies, as only a king can wield the sword.\nEventually Bloom's Dragon Flame also succumbs under the darkness of the Obsidian Circle and is ready to give up when Daphne reminds her that she is not alone. She puts on the mask, and Daphne joins with her to destroy the Ancestral Witches. However, Mandragora returns and the Ancestral Witches use her body as a host and begin to strangle Bloom to death, but Sky reawakens and stabs Mandragora with Oritel's sword, allowing Bloom to use the power of the Dragon Flame on Mandragora, destroying both her and the entire Obsidian Circle, and freeing everyone. Sky explains that he is now the king of Eraklyon, and his coronation was the night he left Bloom at Alfea. With Domino restored to its former glory, Oritel is freed from stone, placing Marion back in human form; Bloom's Enchantix power is complete, and she is finally reunited with her birth parents.\nAt a party afterwards, Oritel and Marion promise Bloom that they will never leave her again. Mike and Vanessa are also there and are greeted by a hug from Bloom. Oritel begins the traditional father-daughter dance, but lets Bloom dance with Sky, who proposes to her. She delightfully accepts, and as they kiss, Bartelby appears by the Book of Fate, telling the audience that the prophecy has been fulfilled; Bloom is now a guardian fairy and there is a new Company of Light - the Winx.\nIn the final scene, it is revealed the Ancestral Witches have not been destroyed.

When the settlers arrive, they find the colony abandoned by the previous occupants, except for one body. They find a corpse hanging from a rope inside a small building, with the door bolted from the inside. John White, the English governor sent with the settlers, dismisses this as an intimidation tactic by the Spanish. White is forced to return to England to gather supplies, and names his son-in-law Ananias Dare (Adrian Paul) interim governor, backed with the strong arm of George Howe (Rhett Giles). That evening, Ananias's pregnant wife Eleanor (Frida Farrell) is sleeping, when suddenly, she has a gruesome dream that her nightgown is covered in blood, with her baby taken from her womb. She runs out into the middle of the town square, and finds a ghost with her baby. She wakes up deeply shaken, and warns Ananias that it might be better for them to return to England. He dismisses this, but settlers begin dying in the woods one by one. Eleanor mysteriously gives birth prematurely, but the baby girl, whom they name Virginia, is thankfully born safely. Crops won't grow on the island's soil, and there are no animals in the forest. More settlers begin dying, and it soon becomes apparent that there is a supernatural presence on the island.\nEleanor continues to get disturbing dreams, and eventually the dreams reveal that the island was the location of a brutal execution of an innocent woman and a few other men by Vikings. Long before, a ship of Viking warriors suffered misfortune and blamed it on one of the women and a few of the men traveling on the ship with them. They took them to the island and tortured them to death, and because of this the souls of the evil Viking men and the other men and the single woman are still trapped on the island in a state between life and death. Ananias must work with Manteo, a local Croatan Indian chief, and his tribe to find a way to send the evil wraiths out of this world and into hell where they belong.\nThinking that the Indians were behind the killings of the settlers, one of the colonists leads an attack on the Indian village, only to be repelled and most of the men killed; for ruining the English's chances of gaining the Indians' trust, he is put in the stocks. Later that night, the wraiths suck out his soul and begin an attack on the colonists; they are fought back, but many colonists are killed. It is soon revealed that these wraiths feed on the souls of the living and are trying to kill Virginia because they require an innocent soul to pass on to the afterlife; it is also learned that their weaknesses are fire and water (water being a symbol of life).

The wraiths arrive at night and due to a colonist panicking, they begin attacking them. In time, only Eleanor, Ananias, Virginia, and Howe are the only survivors. Unfortunately, Eleanor attacks one of the wraiths in an attempt to save Ananias but is quickly killed. After a few minutes, Howe and Ananias are mortally wounded, with the latter luring the wraiths onto the raft with baby Virginia. As they close in on Ananias and Virginia, Howe launches a fire arrow onto the raft, setting it aflame; as the wraiths cannot cross water, they are forced to suffer.

At the time of the movie, Alex has recently stopped taking her medication without telling her parents, which will cause her masculine features to begin to develop more.\nAlex's parents moved with her from Argentina to a village by the sea in Uruguay, to avoid the society's discriminatory views and strict gender expectations. They wanted to help shelter her from bullying she was experiencing. Her father, N\u00e9stor Kraken, is a marine biologist who has written a book on sexuality and makes a living treating wounded animals found by fishermen. Her mother, Suli, invites friends from Argentina: a surgeon, his wife and teenage son \u00c1lvaro. The purpose, unknown to N\u00e9stor and Alex, is to discuss the possibilities of sex reassignment surgery, with Suli quietly hoping that Alex will decide to be female and go through with a surgery in the beginning.\nThe introduction of the relationship between Alex and \u00c1lvaro further complicates the drama of the movie. When Alex asks \u00c1lvaro directly if he would like to have sex, she is initially denied, but \u00c1lvaro later follows her from the beach and she seduces him.

However, \u00c1lvaro begins to question himself because he enjoyed the sexual experience with Alex even though Alex was performing anal sex on him. He is exploring his own gender and sexual identity within the confines of his parents' expectations, which contrasts with Alex's character who receives her parents' support about her situation.\nAt the same time, Alex is questioning her own decisions about her identity and is confronted with frustration at her own body and the limitations placed on her by society. After her father walks in on the sexual experience between his daughter and Alvaro, he realizes his child is now old enough to make her own decision about her life and her sexual identity, and seeks advice from a transgender man that he had read about in newspapers years before. The man expresses his appreciation that Alex's parents chose not to make the decision for her at birth by \"castrating\" her, and allowed her to make her own decision now. Alex's father is comforted by this conversation and returns to Alex recognizing that she is older now and must make her own decision.\nLater in the movie, three boys from the village sexually assault Alex by forcibly pulling down her pants to see her genitals.

Through role reversal, they find satisfaction, and a new understanding and appreciation for each other.\nThe third archetype is labeled The Exes.

Feeling that his fruitless search for the origin of human language has condemned him to a solitary, wasted life, Dominic is intent on committing suicide after this one last journey. However, he is abruptly yet non-lethally struck by lightning while crossing the street. In hospital, Professor Stanciulescu informs Dominic that, much to both their surprises, the lightning appears to have regenerated him into a much younger man. Soon after, while residing at the Professor's home, Dominic also discovers that he possesses strange, psychic capacities.\nAs Romania is invaded by Nazi Germany, Doktor Josef Rudolf begins to show an interest in Stanciulescu's miracle patient. Since Dominic's budding powers have blurred his perception of reality, he is bamboozled into mistaking a Nazi spy known only as the Woman in Room Six for an erotic fantasy. They spend their nights together, and she discovers that he has developed a talent for speaking in tongues. Meanwhile, invisible to human eyes, an alternate persona presents itself to Dominic as his \"Other\" from outside space and time. When Dominic asks for proof, the \"Other\" obliges by bringing him two roses out of nowhere. Unbeknownst to Dominic, Stanciulescu has witnessed the event and overhears his friend ask himself, \"Where do you want me to put the third rose?\" Understanding the Nazis' designs, Stanciulescu persuades Dominic to escape from Romania.\nLiving like a spy, Dominic eventually winds up in Switzerland towards the end of World War II. There he is confronted by Doktor Rudolf at gunpoint in an alleyway. Rudolf argues that Dominic's existence supports the Nazis' ideal of the superman, and that the coming nuclear conflicts can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the \"Other\" confirms this to be the case. However, in refusing to cooperate, Dominic manifests telekinetic powers which manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. Subsequently, Dominic returns to a normal existence and resumes his linguistic research. Having realised that the lightning strike has partially lent him the capacities and knowledge of future humanity, he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered long after the nuclear apocalypse.\nMany years later, Dominic encounters a woman named Veronica while hiking in the Alps. The \"Other\" reveals her to be the reincarnation of Laura. When the mountains are hit by a violent thunderstorm, Dominic rushes to her rescue and finds her chanting in Sanskrit, which he greets her with to gain her trust. During her stay in hospital, Veronica now identifies herself as \"Rupini\", one of the first disciples of the Buddha. Suspecting she may now be afflicted with a condition similar to his own, Dominic calls the Roman College of Oriental Studies for aid. Its representatives inform him that Rupini's last act in life was to retire into a cave for meditation on enlightenment. Since the cave's location is unknown, the scholars, led by Professor Giuseppe Tucci, agree to fund an expedition to find it in India. They hope that Veronica's past self will guide them. The venture proves a success when a local Boddhisatva recognises \"Rupini\" and directs her to the place of meditation. Following this discovery, Veronica becomes herself again and falls for Dominic.\nThe couple elope to Malta, where for a time, they live happily together. Dominic eventually tells Veronica in her sleep that he has always loved her. This causes Veronica to writhe in bed as if possessed. She begins chanting in a language which he does not understand. The \"Other\" explains that she is speaking in the ancient Egyptian language, having travelled further back along the path of her past selves. For the next two weeks, Dominic learns how to control this state in Veronica. He leads her to regress ever further in time and to speak previously unknown tongues. However, Veronica's health begins to decline from exhaustion. Dominic declares that he cannot continue these sessions, or even remain close to Veronica. His proximity to her is accelerating her age.
