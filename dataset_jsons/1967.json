El Chuncho Mu\u00f1os, a gun runner loyal to the revolutionary leader General El\u00edas, leads his gang in an assault on the train. Lieutenant Alvaro Ferreira commanding the rurales of the escort attempts to save the officer, but upon being fatally wounded by Chuncho, he is forced to order the train to run the captain over and escape the bandits. Bill Tate, an American passenger on the train, kills the engineer and stops the train again, allowing Chuncho and his gang to kill the remaining rurales and take their weapons. Posing as a former prisoner of the army, Tate joins the gang, and is quickly befriended by Chuncho, who nicknames him \"Ni\u00f1o\".\nAfter several heists, the gang travels to the town of San Miguel, where Chuncho meets with his old friend Raimundo to overthrow the weakhearted town boss, Don Felipe. Rosaria, Felipe's spirited wife, attempts to defend him; when Chuncho's men assault her, Tate angrily berates them for their behaviour. Chuncho shoots Guapo, a gang member, for attempting to kill Tate. Don Felipe is made to drive Chuncho and his gang back to San Miguel, and he is eventually executed.\nChuncho prepares to stay in San Miguel, drilling the villagers in the hopes of becoming a General himself; Tate convinces much of the gang to leave San Miguel so they can sell their weapons to El\u00edas. Eventually missing his bandit lifestyle, Chuncho leaves San Miguel under the care of El Santo, his priestly half-brother, on the pretext of recovering a gold-plated Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun from his former gang. After killing one of them, Picaro, Chuncho resumes leadership of the others, hoping to sell the weapons to El\u00edas before returning to San Miguel.\nEl\u00edas' emissary arrives, but is pursued by army troops. Tate and Chuncho use the machine gun to decimate the troops, but nearly all of Chuncho's remaining gang is killed in the firefight. Unseen by the others, Tate also kills the emissary. Adelita, Chuncho's last surviving loyal gang member, abandons the pair after her lover, Pepito, is killed in the battle. During the ride to El\u00edas' camp, Tate falls victim to a malaria attack. While getting quinine pills for Tate, Chuncho finds a golden bullet among his possessions; Tate later claims that the bullet is a good luck charm.\nChuncho and Tate arrive at El\u00edas' camp the next morning, where they encounter several starving revolutionaries. Chuncho sells the guns and is paid five thousand pesos, before learning from El\u00edas that the people of San Miguel were massacred by the army. Realising his irresponsibility, Chuncho allows himself to be taken away to be executed by Santo, one of the sole survivors of the attack. Meanwhile, Tate, from a high vantage point, shoots El\u00edas and kills Santo before Chuncho's sentence can be carried out. Tate escapes as El\u00edas' doctors pronounce his death: shot in the head with a golden bullet.\nWeeks later, Chuncho, now an impoverished beggar, tracks Tate to a hotel in Ciudad Juarez and tries to shoot him. Tate, insisting that he has been waiting for him, gives him a half-share of the reward he received from the Mexican Government for assassinating El\u00edas: 100,000 pesos in gold. Chuncho, astonished by Tate's apparent loyalty and friendship, visits a barber, a tailor and a brothel.\nThe next morning the pair prepare to leave for a new life in the United States. However, when Chuncho watches as Tate cuts through a line to buy their train tickets, he begins to reconsider their relationship and his responsibilities. Learning that he had been further manipulated by Tate through his pretending to be an army prisoner, Chuncho suddenly declares that, although they are friends, he must kill him. Tate asks why, to which Chuncho replies \"\u00bfQui\u00e9n sabe?\" before shooting him.

Having infiltrated the camp, Asterix hears Phonus plotting with his Decurion Marcus Sourpuss to overthrow Caesar. Asterix locates Getafix and forms a plan to free him. He seemingly surrenders and convinces the Romans that he and Getafix will co-operate at the prospect of being tortured; Getafix is then escorted by legionnaires as he collects the required ingredients for the potion in the forest.

The entire legion is soon at the mercy of Getafix as their hair and beards grow out of control, rendering them practically helpless.

After her arrest, her subsequent release, and her firing from Femina, Patricia is hired by Cutter, but she states she will not divulge any of Femina's other secrets as part of this employment. However, this selling of secrets was a scheme devised by Sir Jason for Patricia to steal a secret formula for a new water-repellent hairspray from Cutter, the formula invented by Dr Stuart Clancy (Ray Walston), May Fortune's head chemist.\nPatricia is wooed by Cutter's right-hand man, Christopher White (Richard Harris), who drugs her with truth serum to get her to divulge Femina's other secrets to him. Patricia, however, was aware of what Christopher was trying to do; she only pretended to be drugged and passed along false information.\nWhile she cannot get the formula from Cutter or Clancy, Patricia learns that the formula can be obtained through analysis of a lock of hair from the one person known to have used the hairspray, Clancy's secretary, Su Ling (Irene Tsu). As Patricia goes to work trying to cut off a lock of Su Ling's hair, Christopher spots her. Patricia is unable to get a lock of hair, but Christopher tells her that he too is truly working for Sir Jason, and has the proof to back up his claim.\nLater, Christopher is seen setting up surveillance, which includes speaking to Cutter via hidden microphone, Cutter stating that it will be good to see an undercover agent of Sir Jason's caught red-handed trying to steal his formula. Patricia sees what Christopher is doing, although she is assured by Sir Jason that Christopher indeed does work for him and not Cutter. Patricia still does not trust Christopher. She does whatever she can to thwart the surveillance that Christopher has set up, much to Christopher's and Cutter's chagrin.\nAt a date with one of his regulars named Miranda (Lisa Seagram) \u2013 a May Fortune model who Patricia earlier seemed to recognize \u2013 Christopher learns that Patricia Foster is not the real name of the woman whom May Fortune has just hired.\nAt The Times newspaper archives, Christopher is looking through old clippings of a story concerning a man named Robert Fowler being murdered in the Swiss Alps while skiing.\nAt Su's apartment, Patricia finds her unconscious on the floor, seemingly drugged. She takes a small sample of a black powder lying on the coffee table, which she believes was used to drug Su and which she later gives to Sir Jason to have analyzed for her. Patricia finds a bottle of the hairspray, which she takes with her. Christopher catches her, blackmailing her that he will tell Sir Jason that her real name is Felippa Fowler. Dr Clancy arrives, but Patricia and Christopher manage to escape him and the police without being seen.\nAt a later rendezvous, Patricia admits to Christopher that her real name is indeed Felippa Fowler, and that her father \u2013 the man featured in the news clipping \u2013 was murdered in Switzerland while on the trail of a narcotics ring. Before his death, he had divulged that the head of the narcotics ring was discovered to be a woman, most probably the person who killed him. Although finding her father's killer is her main objective, Patricia is still devoted to Sir Jason, to whom she plans to give the bottle of hairspray. Purposely breaking the bottle upon hearing this news \u2013 but noticing that the bottle is an expensive Swiss one not used by Cutter \u2013 Christopher in turn tells Patricia that Clancy has Swiss connections \u2013 that he is married to a Swiss woman still living in Switzerland.\nPatricia goes to Switzerland and finds a woman named Madame Piasco (Lilia Skala) \u2013 Clancy's mother-in-law \u2013 who is the actual cosmetics expert who had long ago come up with the formula for herself to protect her hair for skiing. She gives a bottle to Patricia for free, as Madame Piasco states that May Fortune now has the distribution rights and it will soon be on the market in America.\nPatricia goes skiing on the same hill where her father was killed, and comes under fire from a masked skier. She is rescued by Christopher, who arrives in a helicopter in the nick of time. Patricia believes it is Clancy who tried to kill her, while Christopher thinks it could not be him. He seems unconcerned about the news about the hairspray or Clancy's mother-in-law, which makes Patricia realize that neither Christopher nor Sir Jason was ever after the hairspray. Christopher tells her the story: Clancy used to be the chief cosmetics chemist for Sir Jason, but was an utter failure at it, and Sir Jason's true goal was to discover and hire the true chemical mastermind behind Clancy, whose identity he still does not know. Regardless, Patricia plans to give the hairspray solely to Sir Jason, which was her agreed mission. Christopher and Patricia profess their love for each other, but Christopher requests one more job from her concerning Sir Jason.\nOut in the middle of a snowy mountaintop, Christopher has secretly placed a microphone on Patricia and secretly films her while she goes to speak to Clancy off in the distance. She offers Clancy a job with Femina as head chemist, with an illegal under-the-table bonus. Clancy declines as he says that Cutter already knows about Madame Piasco, and if Cutter does not care, he is happy where he is. Cut to Cutter's office where he is watching the film that Christopher took of Clancy's and Patricia's encounter. He tells Christopher that this footage, which he plans to broadcast, will ruin Sir Jason forever. But Cutter is angry that Christopher has not kept Patricia under confinement for her illegal role in the matter; he in return states that they can nab Patricia as she leaves Sir Jason's.\nPatricia is visiting with Sir Jason, who tells her that he was able to convince Madame Piasco to come and work for him, which Patricia finds incredible. Sir Jason also tells her about the analysis of the black powder, which contains a powerful narcotic. Patricia in turn tells him that she already had the powder analyzed herself, and this analysis conducted by Sir Jason was a test purely to see if he would tell the truth or a lie, the latter of which would implicate him in her father's murder. Sir Jason also tells her that Christopher had her encounter with Clancy filmed, that Cutter plans to broadcast it to the world to ruin him, and that the Paris police after being shown the film, are now after her for bribery. He states that Christopher's motivation is purely financial, as he collects from both sides. Patricia is heartbroken about this news concerning Christopher.\nAs the police are ready to arrest Patricia outside Sir Jason's apartment, Christopher snatches her away. He admits that he works for Interpol. Later, Patricia is able to tell Christopher's Interpol colleagues that the narcotics were smuggled as May Fortune face powder, which was perfectly harmless until incinerated, but then turned into a powerful hallucinogen. None of them believes that Cutter is smart enough to be the head of the narcotics ring.\nDonning a microphone to Interpol while searching through Cutter's Paris office, Patricia tries to tell the cleaning lady who enters the office she need not clean here. The cleaning lady is revealed to be Clancy in disguise, with a gun \u2013 he being the mysterious woman killer. As Patricia and Clancy move through the building, they scuffle, a gunshot is heard; Clancy is shot, and tumbles over the railing to his death several stories below.

A black student named Omar (Omar Blondin Diop), \"Comrade X\", also makes a brief appearance. The two main characters, V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume Meister (the latter named after the titular hero of Goethe's famous 1795 bildungsroman Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship), discuss the issue of revolutionary violence and the necessity of political assassination to achieve revolutionary goals. As an advocate of terrorism as a means of bringing about the revolution, V\u00e9ronique roughly corresponds to the character of Pyotr Stepanovich Verkhovensky in The Possessed. V\u00e9ronique and Guillaume are engaged in a personal relationship, with V\u00e9ronique as the more committed, dominant partner.\nYvonne is a girl from the country who occasionally works as a prostitute for extra money to purchase consumer goods (much like Juliette Janson, the principal character in Godard's previous film, Two or Three Things I Know About Her).  Yvonne does most of the housecleaning in the apartment and, together with Guillaume, she acts out satirical political skits protesting American imperialism in general, and U.S. President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam policy in particular.\nHenri is eventually expelled from the group for his apparent backsliding Soviet revisionism, comically suggested by his defense of the 1954 Nicholas Ray movie Johnny Guitar. In this sense he loosely corresponds to the character of Ivan Shatov in The Possessed, a student who is marked for assassination because he has abandoned the tenets of leftist radicalism.\nKirilov is the only character in the film who actually takes his name from a character in Dostoyevsky's novel; in The Possessed, Kirillov is a suicidal Russian engineer who has been driven to nihilism and insanity by the failure of his philosophical quest. True to his literary namesake, Godard's Kirilov also descends into madness and ultimately commits suicide.\nWhen Guillaume complains that he cannot listen to music and work at the same time, V\u00e9ronique uses a facetious declaration of \"unlove\" to teach him (and the audience) the Maoist lesson of \"struggle on two fronts\". V\u00e9ronique then leaves the apartment alone and sets off for a mission to kill the Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Sholokhov, during his official diplomatic visit to France.\nOn the train ride en route to the planned assassination, V\u00e9ronique engages in a discussion with the political philosopher, Francis Jeanson (Jeanson was actually Anne Wiazemsky's philosophy professor at the Paris X University Nanterre during 1966\u201367; a few years earlier, he had once been a communist and the head of a network which supported the Algerian national liberation movement. This led to his highly publicized arrest and trial by the French government in September 1960.)In the scene on the train, Jeanson argues against the use of violence as a means to shut down the French universities.  However this does not dissuade V\u00e9ronique (for her dialogue in this scene, Godard fed Anne Wiazemsky her lines through an earpiece). The appearance of Francis Jeanson in the film seems to correspond to the character of Stepan Trofimovich Verkhovensky (Pyotr's father and Stavrogin's surrogate father) in The Possessed. Indeed, much like Stepan Trofimovich, Jeanson is an intellectual and philosopher who serves as a kind of father-figure/mentor to V\u00e9ronique \u2014 and his early example as a supporter of terrorism makes him responsible for influencing much of the destruction which is to follow.\nEventually the train arrives at its destination, and V\u00e9ronique sets off to the hotel where the Soviet Minister of Culture is staying. She at first mistakenly reverses the digits of the room number and ends up killing the wrong man, then returns and carries out the assassination upon realizing her mistake. The return of the original owners of the apartment where the cell has been living causes them to leave.

Nishanath is a middle-aged ex-judge and a rich merchant. He needs Byomkesh for a special reason. He is searching for the details of an old Bengali movie song ('Bhalobasar tumi ki jano') and the actress who sang it, Sunayana, as he thinks that she is hiding somewhere inside his huge nursery, Golap Colony, under a fake identity. Nishanath as a judge hanged at least twenty people, but after his retirement, due to lingering moral regrets, he has sheltered a few homeless people, who have either long criminal records or other qualities that make them social outcasts. Byomkesh listens to everything and accepts the case. Sen pays him the advance and requests that he visit his nursery.\nByomkesh meets a Bengali movie expert, Ramen Mullick, and learns about the movie producer's son Murari. He learns that while Murari was making love with Sunayana, he was murdered in his own room. 20,000 rupees and many gold ornaments were stolen from Murari's room. Suspecting Sunayana's role in Murari's murder, a court issued an arrest warrant against her, but she disappeared and her whereabouts are unknown. Ramen gives the details about the actress and also about the film and promises to assist Byomkesh.\nThe next day, Byomkesh and Ajit visit Sen's bungalow and nursery in the 24 Parganas district to meet the residents whom Sen has sheltered. Byomkesh comes disguised as a Japanese horticulturist named Okakura, while Ajit appears as his Indian assistant. Sen shows them the entire nursery including dairy, poultry and an orchid house. He introduces all the residents and Byomkesh photographs everyone. Within a few days, Sen makes another phone call to Byomkesh requesting him to visit again, but the conversation remains unfinished as Mr Sen is bludgeoned to death with a blunt weapon. Byomkesh and Ajit are visited the next day by a police inspector who wants their help on the murder Sen, not knowing of Byomkesh's pre-existing relations with Sen. Byomkesh and Ajit return to the colony and interrogate everyone concerned with Sen's nursery. After a thorough investigation, Byomkesh realises that the case will not prove easy to solve, as there are several motives and people behind Sen's death. After a few days, another murder occurred inside the Golap Colony: this time the victim is Panu, a deaf-mute and one of the suspects who witnessed Sen's murder. Panu's killer used the same weapon and method as was used to kill Sen.\nByomkesh again reaches the spot, examines everything and decides to record the interrogations with his voice recorder. He interrogates all the suspects: Bijoy (Mr Sen's nephew), Rasiklal, Muskil Mian, Brajo Das (employees of Sen), Nepal Gupta (a professor) and Dr. Das (a physician and sitarist), and all the women, including Mrs Damayanti (Sen's widow), Mukul (Nepal's daughter) Nazar bibi (Muskil's wife) and Banalakshimi \u2013 one among the list of suspects. Byomkesh takes an old photograph of Sunayana and tries to match it with all the women under suspicion, but he is unable to make a match.\nShortly after the latest round of interrogations, Brajo comes to Byomkesh's house and confesses about his lord's personal life. He says that Damayanti Sen was not Sen's legal wife but a live-in partner. Many years ago, Sen sentences Damayanti's husband Lal Singh to death for a criminal case. But Lal is not hanged, but rather imprisoned for 14 years because of the concession given from a high court. Lal later kills a person to steal his car. He takes parts of the car and throws them through Sen's bungalow window every fortnight to threaten him. Lal often visits Damayanti secretly for money. But Byomkesh's investigation reveals many other possibilities too. He finds a tape of Dr. Das playing his sitar in the doctor's room; this tape was played in the background during the murder of Sen (the tape was heard by Byomkesh through the phone). Byomkesh also finds that Bijoy abandoned Mukul for Banalaxmi. Byomkesh knows that Sen would not have agreed to the relationship of Bijoy with Banalaxmi, so there is a chance that Bijoy murdered Sen in order to marry Banalaxmi and inherit Sen's wealth.\nIn his room, Byomkesh notices a plastic flower, which triggers a new line of thinking in him. He quickly takes the photo of Sunayana and compares it with the four women's photos and goes for a detailed analysis. He calls everyone and finally reveals Dr. Das as the person behind the murder of Sen and Panu. Dr. Das earlier said that he was playing sitar in his room when the murder was happening. But this statement was disproven when Byomkesh found the tape that was playing in Dr. Das's room during the murder; the argument that he was in his room playing his sitar was Das's alibi. Byomkesh shows them the stolen jewellery and contract papers of 'Sunayana' which Das was hiding for a long time. Banalakshmi, the employee of this nursery, is revealed as the actress Sunayana and the wife of Dr Das. She declares that she underwent plastic surgery to change her face (which Byomkesh realized while contemplating the plastic flower).

Held prisoner in the commander's office, in a fort that has been almost totally destroyed, is the Arapaho Indian war chief, Hanu (Marco Lopez). He says very little. Within the fort's ruins have been found a single grave and a Colt pistol once owned by a gunman Hanu describes as a \"quiet, lonely man...\" At this point the action of the movie commences.\nA wandering gunman, Chuka (Rod Taylor), rides into an Arapaho camp. It is winter and everyone in the camp is starving, so he gives them some food. Shortly afterwards Chuka crosses paths with a stagecoach taking Mexican passengers Senora Veronica Kleitz (Luciana Paluzzi) and her niece Senorita Helena Chavez (Victoria Vetri) through the territory.  Chuka and Kleitz look hard at each other. Suddenly mounted Arapaho warriors, led by Hanu, surround the coach. Everyone connected to the stagecoach expects to be killed, but Hanu recognizes Chuka and the braves simply ride on.\nChuka accompanies the coach to a nearby U.S. Army fort. The outpost's commander, Colonel Stuart Valois (John Mills), is worried the Arapahos may have ambushed his overdue patrol and refuses to allow the civilians to leave. He sends out his scout Lou Trent (James Whitmore) to reconnoiter, but the horse returns without the rider.\nEverybody in the fort has a past they would rather forget. Before he became a hired gunman, Chuka was in love with Kleitz, but because he was only a lowly hired hand on her wealthy father's ranch, he was run off. She dutifully married a man selected by her father from their own social class. The soldiers are the dregs of the army. Valois was cashiered from the British Army for suspected cowardice, including being drunk when his command was attacked. His second-in-command, Major Benson (Louis Hayward), is a card cheat, and also (though Valois does not know it) keeps an Arapaho mistress hidden within the fort. Lieutenant Daly was acquitted of a charge of treason. Most of these revelations are told during dinner by Colonel Valois, to humiliate the men involved. Only Sergeant Otto Hansbach (Ernest Borgnine) is a first-rate soldier. When the coach arrived at the fort he had been overseeing the flogging of a soldier, Spivey (Michael Cole), for desertion. Hansbach takes an immediate dislike to Chuka.\nThe fort is constantly being infiltrated by Arapaho warriors, which would be more successful if not for Chuka's instincts and shooting skills. Recognizing that he is no match for Chuka with a gun, Hansbach challenges Chuka to a fight over the latter's threateningly defiant refusal to obey Valois's order to work for the fort as a scout. A brutal fist fight follows, which ends in a draw.\nChaka is paid $200 to sneak out and scout the enemy for Valois; in the process, he rescues Trent. On his return he tries to renew the relationship with Kleitz, who is now a widow, but she tells him it is too late. He offers to take the two women to safety, but by the time Kleitz asks him to flee with her niece, the fort is under threat of imminent attack. Chuka tells her in any case he would only have tried to flee if she rather than her niece would have gone with him.\nHaving seen the size of Hanu's force and the tactics the Arapaho are practicing, Chuka urges Valois to abandon the fort and leave the food and supplies inside, which is all Hanu wants. Valois will not consider it, even though his force is hopelessly outnumbered. Before the Arapahos attack he suppresses an attempted mutiny of his soldiers, shooting the ringleader Spivey in the process. Chuka guesses, and Valois confirms, it was the first time he has killed a man. (During the contentious dinner Valois had attempted to provoke Chuka by asking him how many men he had killed.) As they await the attack, Senora Kleitz goes to Chuka and they have an intimate encounter. Later, over coffee, Hansbach and Chuka talk in a friendly manner, and Hansbach explains his absolute loyalty to his commander. When Hansbach was a young soldier under Valois's command in the Sudan, he blundered and was captured by the enemy.

When the walls of the fort are breached, Senora Kleitz and Valois are killed. Kleitz dies in Chuka's arms. Enraged, he shoots wildly at the Arapaho overrunning the walls. Valois, with his last words, laments that he was struck down too soon to learn if he is indeed a coward. Hansbach is fatally shot, as he slumps to his death he sees his fallen commander. With all the soldiers dead, and he himself seriously wounded, Chuka hides with Helena Chavez while the victorious Arapahos take the fort's supplies and leave. As Hanu rides through the burning fort on a final inspection, Chuka takes aim at him with his pistol. Hanu sees the two of them in their hiding spot. Chuka recoils and puts his pistol to Helena's head, ready to kill her to keep her from being taken by the attackers. Expressionless, Hanu slowly follows his braves into the night.

Concasseur and his men rough up and imprison Jones.\nBrown has been bequeathed a hotel in the capital from his late British mother, but has been unable to sell it in his trip to New York City. Brown also has an ongoing affair with Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), the German-born wife of the Uruguayan ambassador to Haiti, Pineda (Peter Ustinov). When Martha and Brown have an argument, Brown goes to Mere Catherine's brothel where he discovers that not only has Jones been released, but he's a guest of Captain Concasseur and is enjoying the hospitality of Brown's favourite prostitute, Marie Therese (Cicely Tyson).\nJones has gained the favour of the new regime, who are keen to receive a supply of arms. They have paid a down payment, and Jones claims the weapons are impounded in a warehouse in Miami, but the weapons may be imaginary and a confidence trick by Jones. The government will not allow Jones to leave the island until they are sure the weapons exist.\nMr. Smith, a former \"Vegetarian Party\" candidate for the Presidency of the United States against Harry S. Truman, is given a tour of the new capital, an empty shambles called Duvalierville. He and Mrs. Smith follow a local procession that they believe is a religious ceremony but turns out to be an audience for executions by firing squad.

Taking him to a rebel rendezvous in the place of Dr. Magiot, Brown suspects that Jones has become involved with Martha Pineda.

He is sentenced to two years on a chain gang in a prison camp run by a stern warden known as the Captain, along with Walking Boss Godfrey, a taciturn rifleman nicknamed \"the man with no eyes\" because he always wears mirrored sunglasses. Carr, the floorwalker, tells the new prisoners the rules. Even minor violations are punished by \"a night in the box\", a small wooden booth in the prison yard with limited air and very little room to move.\nLuke refuses to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' leader, Dragline (George Kennedy). When the two have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Luke is severely outmatched by his larger opponent but refuses to acquiesce. Eventually, Dragline refuses to continue the fight, but Luke's tenacity earns the prisoners' respect and draws the guards' attention. He later wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing. Luke says, \"sometimes, nothing can be a real cool hand\", prompting Dragline to nickname him \"Cool Hand Luke\".\n\nAfter a visit from his sick mother, Arletta, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. He continually confronts the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence prove both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. Luke's struggle for supremacy peaks when he leads a work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a day. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the-moment bet that he can eat 50 hard-boiled eggs in an hour.\nOne day, Luke picks up a rattlesnake from the grassy ditch and holds it up for Godfrey to shoot with his rifle, killing it. Luke tosses the dead snake to the boss as a joke before he hands him his walking cane. Luke tells Godfrey, \"Man, you sure can shoot.\" Dragline advises Luke to be more careful with the \"man with no eyes\". A rainstorm ends the day's work prematurely. Before he joins the other prisoners in the truck, Luke shouts to God, testing Him. That evening, Luke receives notice that his mother has died.\nThe Captain anticipates that Luke might attempt to escape to attend his mother's funeral and has him locked in the box. After being released, Luke is told to forget about his mother now that her burial is completed, but he becomes determined to escape. Under cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he makes his initial escape attempt. He is recaptured by local police and returned to the chain gang, but one of the bloodhounds sent after him dies of heat and overexertion. The Captain has Luke fitted with leg irons and delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, saying, \"What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he gets it. And I don't like it any more than you men.\"\nA short time later, Luke escapes again by deceiving the guards while taking a break to urinate and removes his shackles with an axe at a nearby house. He spreads curry powder and chili powder across the ground to keep the guard dogs from following his scent, causing them to sneeze. While free, Luke mails Dragline a magazine that includes a photograph of himself with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured, beaten, returned to the prison camp, and fitted with two sets of leg irons. The Captain warns Luke that he will be killed on the spot if he ever attempts to escape again.\nLuke becomes annoyed by the other prisoners fawning over the magazine photo and says he faked it. At first, the other prisoners are angry, but when Luke returns after a long stay in the box and is punished by being forced to eat a massive serving of rice, the others help him finish it.\nAs further punishment for his escape, he is forced to repeatedly dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, and is then beaten. The prisoners observe his persecution, singing spirituals. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from the windows of the bunkhouse, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and pleading with the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Boss Paul warns Luke that he will be killed if he runs away again, which Luke tearfully promises not to do. The prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke, and one tears up Luke's photograph with the women.\n\nWorking on the chain gang again, seemingly broken, Luke stops working to give water to a prisoner. Watched by the disappointed prisoners, he runs to one of the trucks to fetch Godfrey's rifle for him. After Godfrey shoots a snapping turtle, Luke retrieves it from a slough for him, complimenting him on his shot. Luke is ordered to take the turtle to the truck to dress but steals the truck and the other trucks' keys. In the excitement of the moment, Dragline jumps in the truck and joins Luke in his escape. After abandoning the truck, Luke tells Dragline that they should part ways. Dragline reluctantly agrees and leaves. Luke enters a church, where he talks to God, whom Luke blames for sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Moments later, police cars arrive. Dragline tells Luke that the police and bosses have found them but promised not to hurt Luke if he surrenders peacefully.\nInstead, Luke opens a window door, facing the police, and mocks the Captain by repeating his earlier speech: \"What we've got here is a failure to communicate\". Godfrey shoots him in the neck. Dragline carries Luke outside and surrenders, but charges at Godfrey and strangles him until he is subdued by the guards. While Luke is loaded into the Captain's car, Dragline tearfully implores him to live.\nAgainst the local police's protests, the Captain decides to take Luke to the distant prison infirmary instead of the local hospital, ensuring Luke will not survive the trip. As the car drives away, a semi-conscious Luke weakly smiles while the tires crush Godfrey's sunglasses. After Luke's implied death, Dragline and the other prisoners fondly reminisce about him.\nSome time later, the prison crew works near a rural intersection close to where Luke was shot, with Dragline now wearing leg irons, and a new Walking Boss supervising.

He sends a symbolic message to Domitian: a caged mouse, frog, bird, a knife and a quiver of arrows. The message is misinterpreted by the Romans as a sign of Dacian submission to Rome (the animals signifying the land, waters and air, all being handed over with the weapons). Severus is deputed to travel to the Dacian capital to receive Decebalus' surrender. When he gets there, Decebalus reveals to him the truth about his father Attius.

According to ancestral custom, the bravest young warrior must be sacrificed to the Dacian god Zalmoxis to win his favour. Since the king's son Cotyso won a contest of athletic and martial skill, he has been given the honour of being sent to Zalmoxis. Cotyso accepts that he must die and is sacrificed by being thrown onto spears.

Back at the camp, Severus argues violently with Fuscus. Fuscus says he intends to overthrow Domitian, offering Severus the position of governor of Dacia, but the latter refuses.

Dolittle, a former medical doctor, lives with an extended menagerie, including a chimpanzee named Chee-Chee, a dog named Jip, and a talking blue-and-yellow macaw named Polynesia (the uncredited voice of Ginny Tyler). Dolittle claims that he can talk to animals. In a flashback, he explains that he kept so many animals in his home that they created havoc with his human patients, who took their medical needs elsewhere. His sister, Sarah, who served as his housekeeper, demanded that he dispose of the animals or she would leave; he chose the animals. Polynesia taught him that different animal species can talk to each other, prompting Dolittle to study animal languages so that he could become an animal doctor. He is planning his latest expedition to search for the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail.\nWhile treating a horse for nearsightedness, Dolittle is accused by the horse's owner, General Bellowes (Peter Bull), of stealing the animal. A fox that was under Dolittle's care flees from Bellowes's hounds into a nearby barn. The hounds pursue it but are chased out by a group of skunks. The doctor explains to Bellowes that each fox travels with a skunk for protection. Bellowes's niece, Emma Fairfax (Samantha Eggar), offended by his lack of human empathy, chides Dolittle for his rudeness to her uncle. Dolittle expresses his contempt for her and other humans who hunt animals, and she storms off. Matthew falls in love with her at first sight.\nAn American Indian friend of Dolittle's sends him a rare Pushmi-pullyu, a creature that looks like a llama with a head on each end of its body, so that Dolittle can earn money for his expedition. Dolittle takes the creature to a nearby circus, run by Albert Blossom (Richard Attenborough), where the Pushmi-Pullyu becomes the star attraction. The doctor befriends a circus seal named Sophie who longs to return to her husband at the North Pole. Dolittle smuggles her out of the circus, disguises her in women's clothing to convey her to the coast, and then throws her into the ocean. Fishermen mistake the seal for a woman and have Doctor Dolittle arrested on a charge of murder.\nGeneral Bellowes is the magistrate in his case, but Dolittle proves he can converse with animals by talking with Bellowes's dog and revealing details that only Bellowes and the dog could know. Although Dolittle is acquitted on the murder charge, the vindictive judge sentences him to a lunatic asylum.\nDolittle's animal friends engineer his escape, and he, Matthew, Tommy, Polynesia, Chee-Chee and Jip set sail in search of the Great Pink Sea Snail. Emma, by this time fascinated by Dolittle, stows away, seeking adventure. They randomly choose their destination: Sea-Star Island, a floating island currently in the Atlantic Ocean. The ship is torn apart during a storm.\nEveryone washes ashore on Sea-Star Island, where Emma and Dolittle admit they have grown to like each other. The party is met by the island's natives, whom they mistake for hostile savages. The populace are in fact highly educated and cultured from reading books that have washed ashore from innumerable shipwrecks. Their leader is William Shakespeare the Tenth (Geoffrey Holder); his name reflects the tribe's tradition of naming children after favorite authors. William explains that they are wary of strangers coming to the island, and that the tropical island is currently endangered because it is drifting north into colder waters and all the animals on the island have caught colds. Mistrust leads the islanders to blame the doctor and his party. Dolittle persuades a whale to push the island south, but this causes a balancing rock to drop into a volcano, fulfilling a prophecy that dooms Dolittle and party to die \"the death of 10,000 screams\". The push by the whale also causes the island to rejoin the unknown mainland, fulfilling another prophecy that dictates that the doctor and his friends be heralded as heroes and they are freed.\nWhile treating the animals on the island, Dolittle receives a surprise patient \u2013 the Great Pink Sea Snail, which has also caught a severe cold. Dolittle discovers that the snail's shell is watertight and can carry passengers. Dolittle sends Matthew, Tommy, Emma, Polynesia, Chee-Chee, and Jip back to England with the snail.

When Slater accuses Wheatley of becoming soft and complacent and Wheatley responds that Slater\u2019s only real love was for his work, Slater punches him in the face.\nInvestigating further, Slater tracks down the young lady who took the same cable car as did his son on the day he was killed. She is Gina (Britt Ekland), a ski-lover working for a rich local woman who throws extravagant ski parties. At one of those parties Slater talks to Gina. She tells him there were two other men in the cable car, but is only able to give a cursory description of one of them. It is not much to go on, but when, shortly afterward, that man asks her to dance, she chases after Slater to tell him. The man has left, but Slater and Wheatley trace him to a farm on the outskirts of town. While Wheatley waits at the end of a long driveway, Slater enters the farmhouse. The Russian intelligence officer\u2019s two henchmen (one of whom is the man from the party) confront him, and a fight ensues during which a gun goes off.\nWheatley, hearing the shot, starts to drive away from the scene. He quickly changes his mind and returns to the farmhouse. He arrives just in time to pick up Slater, running out of the farmhouse, and together they drive off. Slater returns to the party and has a confrontation with Gina in her bedroom. He attacks her, but she fights back and claws at his face. Wheatley enters the room and talks Slater out of any further violence.\nWhile Slater has been investigating, his superior officer had been growing increasingly agitated. He had contacted the nearest CIA agent and told him to track Slater down and put him on the next plane to Washington. The agent arrives in town.\nAfter the confrontation with Gina, Slater goes back alone to the farmhouse. There, the plot as revealed in the film\u2019s title is confirmed. The Slater who ran out of the farmhouse is a lookalike double whose resemblance to Slater has been perfected with plastic surgery. The Russian plan is to replace Slater with the double, who has spent years learning to imitate Slater\u2019s voice, speech pattern and attitudes. The plan requires the CIA braintrust to believe that the murder of Slater\u2019s son was indeed part of a plot to lure Slater in and then kill him. Everything that followed, including the slow revelation of information that fueled Slater\u2019s investigation, his conversations and fights with Wheatley and Gina, and even his having to be rescued and forcibly sent back to Washington, were all part of the plot to ensure that no-one would ever suspect Slater has been replaced by a lookalike double.\nAll this is revealed to Slater in the farmhouse, while he is handcuffed and immobile, by the Russian intelligence officer and the double. Slater mocks the plan, saying the double will never be able to imitate him convincingly. The Russian intelligence officer counters that any other differences between the double\u2019s mannerisms and Slater\u2019s will be attributed to Slater being in mourning for his son\u2019s death, plus the subsequent intrigue. The double reconnects with Wheatley, who has been joined by the agent sent to make sure Slater flies home immediately, and the Russian plan seems about to succeed.\nOne of the last pieces of the plan calls for the real Dan Slater to be killed and his body secretly disposed of. Slater, handcuffed and gagged but fully conscious and with his legs unrestrained, is put in a car that is to drive him out of town, never to be seen again. However the car gets held up by a raucous group of slow-moving partiers on their way to a nighttime ski run. When the driver steps out to shout at the partiers to move aside, Slater escapes. He eludes the immediate pursuit and search for him, but the Russian intelligence officer spots him dashing into the middle of the group of ski revelers on their way to the cable car station. Slater, with the three Russian agents following closely, go up the mountain in the cable car. Slater has not yet ripped off his gag, and does not do anything to reveal himself to the partiers.\nMeanwhile Wheatley has had doubts about Slater\u2019s violent attack of Gina, and visits her. The two of them chat and then seek out the double (still thinking he is Slater) who is waiting with the CIA agent to take the next train out of town. When Wheatley mentions he has some doubts about Slater\u2019s attackers, the double, knowing the real Slater would have done so, insists on going with Wheatley to check on the loose ends.\nWheatley, the double and the agent make their way to an otherwise unmanned cable car station halfway up the mountain. There, for several minutes already, the real Slater has been hiding from the Russian pursuers. They have heard him but don\u2019t know exactly where he is, and do not turn on any lights that would help them in their search. It sets the stage for the final confrontation between Slater and the double, with Wheatley, the only armed man among them, having to choose who the real Dan Slater is based on what they say.", "tmdb_plot": "In a complex piece of espionage the Russian secret service attempts to kidnap a high ranking officer in the CIA and replace him with a double of its own.", "tmdb_id": "105056", "wiki_id": "24160862"}, {"title": "Japanese Summer: Double Suicide", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Nejiko is a sex-obsessed girl.

Nirmala discovers that her mother (Leela Chitnis) has mortgaged their house to pay for her education, so she gets a job as nurse to a wealthy blind woman (Mumtaz Begum). This woman has a son Ranjit (Rehman) who is also very attracted to Nirmala. She knows it, but does her best to keep him at arm's length. Then Ashok gets a job out of town. When he tells Nirmala, he gives her a bracelet and promises to come back for her soon. But after a party at her employer's home\u2014against her better judgment\u2014she accepts a ride with Ranjit and he rapes her. The bracelet from Ashok is lost and she is left on the cold ground. When she finds out that she is pregnant, her mother takes her out of town, where she gives birth to a still-born child. Meanwhile, Ashok's father has arranged his marriage with the daughter of a colleague. Ashok's friend Bansi (Johnny Walker) sabotages the marriage when the girl comes to visit (in a very funny scene) by insinuating that Ashok is an inveterate gambler. This enrages his father, and when Ashok says that he has promised another girl he would marry her, his father retorts that he has promised his friend. At his response, Ashok's father gets up and leaves without another word. When Nirmala and her mother return home, Nirmala gets a letter from two of her school friends. They are working in Mussoorie at a school, and think Nirmala can get a job teaching there too. She goes there and gets the job at the school. Her friends ask where she has been, and tell her that Ashok went to her house looking for her several times. Ashok is living in a camp in Mussoorie, working as an engineer. The girls and Bansi conspire to reunite them. Ashok is overjoyed to see Nirmala, but of course she has changed. He asks her to marry him; she refuses at first, then says that she will give him her answer in a week and throws herself into his arms, weeping. After some thought, she writes him a letter explaining all that has happened in the past year, leaves it at his camp, and goes home to her mother. Her mother scolds her for telling him everything, but she says that she couldn't live with him in a lie. When he shows up at her door on Sunday, and says that she owes him an answer, Nirmala thinks that he has read her letter and forgiven her, and she agrees happily to marry him. Bansi disguises himself as an astrologer and goes to Ashok's parents, hoping to trick them into agreeing to come for his wedding. The ruse fails, however, and Ashok's father refuses. Ashok and Nirmala get married and go to stay in a hotel on their wedding night.\nAs the newlyweds are about to go to bed, the hotel proprietor knocks on the door and hands Ashok a letter from Bansi. It's about their new house and Nirmala wants to read it; but it also contains her letter, which Bansi found under the carpet when he was packing up the camp. Nirmala is horrified, but gives the letter to Ashok. He reads it and walks away from her, stunned. When she follows him and pleads innocence, he agrees that she is innocent but that she is no longer the same Nirmala he worshipped and alienated his father for; he asks her why she didn't leave the job as soon as she suspected Ranjit's intentions. She leaves and goes home to her mother, hoping that he will come and get her\u2014but he doesn't. Back at Ashok's, Bansi confronts him. As weeks pass into months, Nirmala decides to leave her mother's since the neighbors are all gossiping about her prolonged stay. She goes to Nainital, where she gets a job as a governess to a man with seven children. She enjoys the children and her new employer is good to her, but she still longs for Ashok. Her new employer's brother-in-law and niece arrive for a visit, and Nirmala soon realizes that they are Ashok's father and sister. Ashok's sister Sudha befriends Nirmala, not knowing that she is her bhabhi. Then one day as Nirmala is out walking, she hears a holy man over the loudspeakers outside a mosque. His words move her, and she goes in to meet him and get his blessing. It's Ranjit! She flees, but he follows her home and tells her that he is reformed; that after his mother died (she understood very well what kind of man he was) he wandered the world for a bit, and found God, and repented for all his sins. Nirmala tells him bitterly that she doesn't believe him and tells him to leave. A few days later he shows up again. He has transformed himself again from a guru to Ranjit. He tells her that after seeing her, he could not get her out of his mind, and that she is right\u2014his sins are too great for him to be a man of God. He wants to live with her and take care of her. She angrily rejects him, but he keeps visiting. Back at his home again, Ashok's father has become very ill, and calls for Ashok to come see him. At the house, Ashok sees a photograph of Nirmala, which his sister had brought with her from Nainital as a memento of their friendship. He tells her that Nirmala is his wife and explains why they are not together. His sister and father convince him to go get her and bring her home. He sets off for Nainital to find Nirmala. Sudha telegrams Nirmala about this, delightedly she awaits for him. But Ashok leaves without meeting Nirmala. Nirmala hears Ashok going and comes out of the house and finds Ranjit, who had whisked Ashok away by telling him a lie that Nirmala is now happily living with him as he obsessively loves her. Nirmala, when she is about to leave to stop Ashok, she is stopped by Ranjit, who says that she belongs to him forever, not Ashok, enraged Nirmala stabs Ranjit to death for ruining her life and separating her from Ashok. As she leaves to stop Ashok, her neighbour witnesses the murder. Nirmala stops Ashok and tells him the truth about Ranjit and confesses her crime. Ashok accepts Nirmala and realises his mistake for not trusting her. He then realises that the police are after Nirmala, and ensures her that he will take the blame on himself, but Nirmala refuses by saying that crime cannot go unpunished, and she will surrender to police in the morning and asks Ashok to spend one last night with her together before police separate them.

Confronted by the Clan Lord Abe Masayori for trespassing in his lands of Oshi, Nariatsu kills him in a fit of pique and rides home. The Oshi fief retainers appeal to the Sh\u014dgun's Council of Elders for justice.

He tells Peterson, \"I sell chewing gum... confections...\nMagda spots Mitchell, sings to him, kisses him in front of Peterson and leads him to her dressing room where she asks him to help her change outfits. She then locks the room and goes out to perform another song, \"Five Golden Dragons\". When she finishes, the emcee introduces \"one of Japan's most popular singing stars, Miss Yukari Ito\", who performs a song in Japanese.\nMeanwhile, in his office, Sanders struggles to remember a quote which Chiao finishes for him and adds that it is from \"Henry Five\". Sanders then adds, \"Act 2, scene 1\". Trapped in Magda's room, Mitchell discovers a secret passage to Peterson's office and escapes with Peterson's briefcase, but is intercepted by Chiao and his men and brought to Sanders' office. Exiting, he sees Ingrid outside and they leave together as Sanders closes the door and quotes Macbeth, act 4, scene 3.\nOne by one, four of the Dragons arrive in Hong Kong. When the second Dragon arrives, it is Chiao who provides the quote which Sanders recognizes as Othello. The Dragons are members of a secret society, each with a key to a cabinet. Each member wears a golden dragon head. When this scene is first used one of the dragons is revealed as Christopher Lee. The earlier scenes only have four dragons. Learning that Ingrid has been kidnapped, Mitchell argues with Sanders about rescuing her and storms out as Sanders, alone, quotes Othello, act 3, scene 2. Having captured Ah Sing and Ingrid, Gert menaces her, but Ah Sing manages to free himself and strangles Gert.\nThe climax of the film results from the arrival of Mitchell, disguised as the fifth dragon but, owing to a double-cross by Magda, Peterson switches places with Mitchell and, while still wearing his mask, is fatally shot by the gun concealed inside the cabinet he opens, thus inadvertently saving Mitchell's life. Immediately thereafter, Sanders and Chiao arrive in the Dragons' meeting room and arrest them as well as Magda.\nWhen asked by Sanders about his plans, Mitchell replies, \"Well, uh... I... I think that's... uh... more or less up to Ingrid... right? As Sanders and Chiao watch a plane take off from the airport, Sanders quotes, \"That is the true beginning of our end\" from Midsummer Night's Dream, act 4, scene 1.", "tmdb_plot": "While travelling through Hong Kong, Bob Mitchell accidentally stumbles into the middle of criminal negotiations between a mean gang, the Five Golden Dragons and the local mobsters.", "tmdb_id": "76131", "wiki_id": "19890808"}, {"title": "The Flim-Flam Man", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Mordecai C.

One of Lewis's more multifaceted productions, The Girl, the Body, and the Pill follows the subject through multiple perspectives. We see a liberal high school teacher (Pamela Rhea) advocating for sex education as a means of promoting proper hygiene among her rapidly developing adolescent students. Her efforts to promote planned parenthood meet with fierce opposition from the schoolboard as well as the parents of several of the students. Actually, one parent in particular, the hyperprotective puritanical father (Bill Rogers) of a virginal daughter whose boyfriend wants to go all the way, is the loudest voice to oppose such education. The film additionally follows the exploits of the school's most promiscuous student, Randy (Nancy Lee Noble), and that of her considerably more promiscuous single mother (Valedia Hill).\nAs part of her co-ed hygiene curriculum, Pamela has begun recently to encroach the subject of sex, despite lack of official backing from the schoolboard. Soon, the school principal expresses disapproval of this curriculum, forcing Pamela to continue to conduct the classes in her own home. The daughter of the chief opponent to this hygienic education meanwhile struggles with balancing her love of her boyfriend with maintaining her prudence. A lustful group of teenage boys, one of whom is currently engaging in relations with Randy, discuss their collective attraction to Pamela. Upon further investigation, Pamela becomes outraged that the local pharmacies refuse to dispense birth control to teenage girls out of principle. Randy, meanwhile, is in danger of running out of her contraceptive pills, prompting her to steal them from her mother and replace them with saccharine tablets. Lucky for her, as Randy's \"boyfriend\" decides to share his good fortune among his group of oversexed teenage male friends one night in the back seat of his car, in spite of Randy's resistance.\nWhile all this goes on, Rogers, who clearly states his dissatisfaction in his own marriage and frustration over the fact that their daughter was an unplanned pregnancy, sets out to gather support for his cause from some of the other parents. Of course, who does he contact first but Randy's mom. It doesn't take long before he hypocritically succumbs to the temptation of the truck-stop vixen, and carries on an affair. Confident in the effectiveness of her birth control, Valenia thinks nothing of protection during this triste until, lo and behold, she becomes pregnant.

There they encounter a gnome called Jasper, who has \"a terrible problem\". They also are introduced to Jasper's 943-year-old grandfather Knobby who, like D.J., is passionate and short-tempered. Jasper's \"terrible problem\" is that Knobby is suffering from a sickness called \"fading\", or becoming semi-transparent. D.J. diagnoses this as Knobby losing the will to live. The reason for this \"fading\" is that Knobby fears that he and Jasper are the last two of their Gnome kind, and Knobby wants Jasper to find a bride before Knobby dies. Knobby harbors immense hatred for humans because of the human's logging damage to the forests and the livelihood of gnomes. D.J. Mulrooney is startled when Knobby exclaims that the worst loggers were \"Mulrooney's Marauders\", but the gnomes agree to go along with the trio and seek other gnomes.

When Cat emerges from the house the gang follows Bill's orders \u2013 Cat is allowed to leave. There is a funeral, though a burned body cannot be identified. After the funeral the men find that the loot of the gang is missing, and Bud says that Cat must have stolen it. On several occasions Cat is attacked by gang members and kills them, while Bud disappears.\nThis is told in flashbacks during the film. The story as shown begins with a train running into a town, filled with dead bodies. This train has been robbed and its passengers massacred, but one survivor identifies Bill San Antonio, though Bill had been supposed to be dead, shot by Cat in a duel. Cat is told this by Hutch, an old acquaintance who is now an insurance agent. Cat remembers that the gun he used in the duel was handed to him by Bud. He sneaks away at night with Hutch's horse and leaves it further on. Cat searches \u2013 followed at a distance by Hutch \u2013 and eventually finds the hideout of Bill's new gang. When sneaking into the house Cat is caught, but saved by Hutch. Using Hutch's considerable strength, they remove the box with the gold taken from the train, and hide it down in the ground by some cliffs. Then the two fall out, because Cat wants more than the percentage offered by the insurance company. As shots may draw the attention of the gang, they fight it out without weapons. Cat swings in a tree and kicks Hutch several times until Hutch finally knocks Cat out cold. Still dizzy, Hutch looks up to find that Bill and his men have arrived.\nThe two are tortured by what Bill knows that they can't stand, Cat by water and Hutch by fire, but they won\u2019t tell where the gold is. When Bill and most of the gang temporarily leave (to meet his secret partner), Cat suggests to Bud (who has been recently whipped by Bill for being too conspicuous in the nearby village and also blamed for the surviving witness at the train massacre) that he can lead him to the gold. After Cat digs up the box of gold, Bud is about to shoot him but Cat throws a knife lying by the box and kills Bud.\nWhen Bill returns he sends his gang to search for Cat. Bill and two bandits find Cat in a cantina in the nearby Mexican village. After his two companions have been shot by Cat, Bill \u2013 held at gunpoint \u2013 suggests that they share the money, and forget Hutch.

Then Hutch shoots the men when they break in through the door.\nAt the place of the gold, Cat intends to reproduce his first duel with Bill, but with dynamite instead of fire. While the fuse burns away, they move into position to draw, but are interrupted by Hutch, who is holding a rifle and tells them to drop their guns. He asks about the gold.

Hotel manager Peter McDermott involves himself in the proposals from three potential buyers of the property. He also takes a romantic interest in Jeanne Rochefort, the beautiful French mistress of one of the bidders, and deals with a wide range of routine problems, including a faulty elevator.\nJeanne is the mistress of Curtis O'Keefe, who intends to renovate and \"modernize\" the hotel, with conveyor belts carrying luggage automatically around the building as if it were some sort of modern airport terminal, and even presenting the customer's bill on a conveyor belt. While this is O'Keefe's vision for a hotel of the future, his immediate plans for the St. Gregory are different: He would remove the fountain in the center of the lobby and replace it with a circular news stand and bookstore; he would remove the comfortable lobby seating, forcing guests to go to a restaurant or lounge and spend money to sit; he would change the mezzanine promenade with rows of little shops; and he would chop up the great suites into smaller guest rooms.\nAmong the guests at the hotel are the Duke and Duchess of Lanbourne, a wealthy couple hiding out after fleeing from an accident in their car. A hotel detective, Dupere, attempts to blackmail the Duke and Duchess. The Duchess responds by asking Dupere to drive the car from the accident to Washington D.C. for $25,000 ($203,000 today), but he gets caught outside of the city.\nKeycase, a professional thief, is working the hotel using a range of techniques and some female accomplices.

However, Trent tells the assistant manager filling in for McDermott (McDermott having been offered a sexual liaison with Jeanne at his French Quarter apartment) not to allow them accommodation. The Adamses are denied their room, the couple then disappear only to be followed by a man with a camera.

After tracking them down to another hotel, McDermott offers the couple their room back, but when he goes to pick them up, they have already left the hotel.  After contacting the NAACP, they inform McDermott that they had not had anything planned (yet) for the St. Gregory in terms of pushing to allow blacks to check into the hotel. The couple then winds up in a Washington newspaper, damaging both O'Keefe's deal and the alternate deal with the union, leaving only the option of selling the hotel to a buyer who plans to destroy it and build an office tower.\nO'Keefe makes a final offer on the hotel and asks Trent, who brings McDermott along, to hear it. During the meeting, McDermott gets a call revealing that \"Dr.\" Elmo Adams is not a doctor after all and actually works as an employee for an O'Keefe Hotel in Philadelphia.  McDermott also reveals that O'Keefe offered him $20,000 ($163,000 today) to convince Trent to take the deal, and implies that Rochefort slept with him so that he wouldn't be at the hotel to properly handle the arrival of the black guests. Hotel owner Trent decides to reject the unscrupulous O'Keefe's offer and sell the St. Gregory to the man who will demolish it.\nKeycase's luck changes when he blithely talks himself out of one tough spot in the suite of the Duke and Duchess by grabbing an ordinary-looking attach\u00e9 case.

The two criminals break into the home in the middle of the night but are unable to find any safe, as Herbert uses checks for his personal business and his farm operations. In order to leave no witnesses to their robbery attempt, Smith and Hickock kill Herbert by cutting his throat, and proceed to murder his wife, Bonnie, and their two teenage children, Nancy, 16, and Kenyon, 14, with a shotgun. Their bodies are discovered the next day, and a Finney County sheriff's and Kansas Bureau of Investigation (KBI) investigation is immediately launched, headed by detective Alvin Dewey.\nBased on a tip by a former cell mate of Hickock, the two men become the primary suspects for the Clutter murders.

Chief Lloyd C. Cramden joins President Trent for a game of golf. Their game is interrupted by a small group, two women disguised as boys and an actor disguised as an old man, all from the Fabulous Face organization. Substituting the presidential golf ball with a small gas bomb, they succeed in temporarily immobilizing the presidential party and replacing the president with the now-undisguised actor, who has been surgically altered to look exactly like him. The Fabulous Face organization plans to gain control of the world and run it entirely by a group of women led by an influential female triumvirate in fashions, cosmetics and mass communications. Cramden has inadvertently stumbled upon this world-domination plot. The women want to establish a matriarchy, and the first step in their plan is to gain control of a US space facility in the Virgin Islands. Elisabeth has established the spa there as a cover. The women establish their headquarters near the rocket base to brainwash their male-oriented sisters by planting tape recorders in their hair dryers.\nPuzzled by an apparent three-minute time discrepancy\u2014revealed by a perusal of a stopwatch that was active during the switch\u2014Cramden visits the former super agent Derek Flint at his New York City home. Greeted by Flints' three female live-in companions in the living room of Flint's spacious Manhattan apartment, Cramden is informed that Flint is experimenting with the creation of a dolphin language dictionary. Flint tells Cramden these undersea mammals are intelligent creatures and that they use sounds or sonics to communicate, a notion that had been only relatively recently reinforced by scientific experimentation at the time the film was produced. Flint then shows Cramden a sonic device of his own invention that is integrated into a cigarette lighter (and that, amongst many other uses mentioned\u201482 are claimed for the gadget\u2014is later revealed to serve as a belt buckle), first moving and then shattering a white cue ball on the pool table. Cramden requests that Flint investigate the \"lost\" three minutes recorded by the stopwatch. Flint agrees to take up the matter after his return from a survival exercise in the Mojave Desert. During their meeting, Lisa Norton, an operative of Fabulous Face, is meeting with Flint's three live-in girl friends, where she tricks the girls into accepting a free visit to the Fabulous Face Spa in the Virgin Islands. That evening Cramden encounters Norton, whom Fabulous Face has re-tasked to deal with his unexpected interference with their plans, at an Italian restaurant. Disguised as a southern schoolteacher visiting the city, she drugs him using cigarettes treated with a soporific substance and stages a compromising scene with a prostitute at a hotel; the scene is then photographed and published under the auspices of General Carter, who is working with Fabulous Face. With Cramden framed as a libertine, the \"imposter\" President publicly suspends the disgraced spy chief from active duty.\nRecalled from his exercise, Derek Flint hypnotizes Cramden with his watch, which incorporates lights specifically designed for such a purpose, and learns the details of the encounter with Lisa. Tests of trimmings from Cramden's mustache (secured through the use of the ubiquitous, multi-talented cigarette lighter) reveal traces of \"euphoric acid\", a drug that when mixed with alcohol leaves the subject mildly sedated and aroused. Investigating further, Flint breaks into Z.O.W.I.E. headquarters and discovers that the two astronauts on the recently launched space platform are, in fact, Russian female cosmonauts. Flint is interrupted by General Carter and a force of turncoat guards who, after a struggle, believe they have killed Flint when he apparently falls into a document incinerator.\nHaving actually escaped his supposed demise, Flint travels to the Soviet Union to investigate the cosmonaut connection. Dancing in the Bolshoi ballet, he makes contact with ballerina Natasha, unaware that she is a Fabulous Face operative until she attempts to drug him with soporific cigarettes, as Lisa Norton had done to Lloyd Cramden in New York. Flint manages to foil Natasha's designs, but his subsequent interrogation of her is interrupted by the KGB, who arrive at her apartment intending to bring Flint to the Soviet Premier. Flint escapes their clutches and leads the KGB agents in a chase across the roof, tricking one agent to looking over the ledge by imitating a pigeon (making cooing noises), then reaching up from his precarious perch beneath the building's eaves and pulling the man to his death. Flint, hopping atop roof again, evades the other agent and manages to propel a grappling hook, shot from his multi-purposed cigarette lighter, onto another nearby roof and, walking along the line he's secured at his end, crosses over and escapes into a lower vent hatch. Flint next sneaks into the Kremlin, where he overhears the Premier bluffing the (fake) U.S. President; conversational clues point Flint to the Fabulous Face spa in the Virgin Islands.\nCramden has also traveled to the Fabulous Face Spa to investigate further but he is captured and imprisoned with the real President. The Fabulous Face staff, in anticipation of Flint coming to the spa, have imprisoned his girl friends in cryogenic freezing chambers. Flint boards an Aeroflot flight for Cuba disguised as a bearded Cuban Revolutionary. An amusing scene ensues on the Russian airliner which pokes tongue-in-cheek fun at the idea of how an airline would be run in the Caribbean \"socialist paradise\". Distracting the other passengers, he ties up the pilots, parachutes out over the Virgin Islands, and swims to the Fabulous Face complex (with minor help from a wild dolphin). There, he is intercepted by Lisa Norton, who brings him before the Fabulous Face leadership, a group of female business executives who explain their plan to brainwash women (through the use of subliminal messages transmitted by salon hairdryers, as revealed in the film's opening scenes) into overthrowing the male-dominated political order. As Flint attempts to talk the women out of their plan, he is interrupted by General Carter, who is dissatisfied with his subordinate role in the women's plot and plans to take power himself with the aid of the fake president. After a fight, Flint is captured by Carter's men and placed, along with Cramden, the captive U. S. President, and the Fabulous Face leadership with their lead staff, into cryogenic suspension. Derek Flint escapes his freezing chamber, where he has been imprisoned with the lovely Miss Norton, with the sonic wave amplifier device he demonstrated to Cramden in his New York apartment. Subsequently, Flint decides to join sides with the women in stopping Carter's plan to atomically arm the space station. Flint, Cramden, the real President Trent, and the women of Fabulous Face travel to the nearby base where the launch is scheduled to take place. Once they arrive, the women execute \"Operation Smooch\", using their beauty and sexual allure to distract, seduce, and subdue the male guards. After the women thereby succeed in taking over the control room, Carter (who is on board the rocket) threatens to activate the atomic warheads under his control unless he is allowed to proceed with the launch. Flint manages to board the capsule just before it takes off; once in orbit he and Carter fight in zero gravity, causing the spacecraft to tumble. After overpowering Carter, Flint escapes the capsule, which is then destroyed with a nuclear missile launched from the surface.

Gillespie rescues him and tells him to leave town to save himself, but Tibbs is convinced he can solve the case.\nTibbs asks Wood to re-trace his patrol car route during the night of the murder; Gillespie joins them. After questioning why Wood partially detours from his patrol route, Tibbs finds that Wood enjoys passing by the house of 16-year-old Delores Purdy, with its bright lights and unobscured windows, to watch her undress. Gillespie discovers that Wood made a sizable deposit to his bank account the day after the murder. He arrests Wood, despite Tibbs's protests that he is not the murderer. Tibbs tells Gillespie that the murder was committed at the site of the planned factory, which clears Wood because he could not have driven both his and Colbert's cars back into town.  Also, while being interrogated Wood provides a credible account of where the money for his large deposit could have come from.\nDelores' brother Mr. Purdy, a hostile local, brings her to the police station and files statutory rape charges against Wood for getting her pregnant.

He vows to resign if he fails to catch the criminal by January 26.\nMeanwhile, the Commissioner's son Vinay is hired by prominent jeweller Vishambhar Nath, who values his skill with jewels highly. In the course of his work, Vinay grows close to Vishambhar's daughter Anjali. At a party hosted by Anjali, Vishambhar's childhood friend Arjun and Arjun's sister, Shalini, mistake Vinay to be Shalini's fianc\u00e9, Amar.

He believes that the man he had left in-charge was Vinay, although the real Vinay was with Anjali. The police believe the impersonator was Amar. A small-time thief gets caught at the shop, and divulges information about Amar's associate, Helen. Vinay agrees to help the police by impersonating Amar, and goes to meet Helen.

The gang's real leader is revealed to be Arjun, who is the jewel thief. No person named Amar ever existed; the identity was created to baffle the police and deflect any attention away from Arjun.

Locky follows Paquet's advice.\nDr. Robert Richardson mets the MacDonald family: Black, the father, Aggie, his sister, and Belinda, who is a deaf-mute young woman. Her appearance is unkempt, almost wild. The family raises farm animals and grind local wheat into flour at their small mill. The doctor realizes that, although she cannot hear or speak, Belinda is very intelligent. Her father, her aunt, and the whole town call Belinda \"dummy\" and care little about her. Dr. Richardson befriends Belinda and teaches her sign language. She also learns to read, mathematics, how to read lips, and her appearance improves. Belinda's father and aunt realize she is a kind, loving young woman, and the family's relationship changes. Over time, the doctor's affection for her grows.\nMeanwhile, Locky has noticed Belinda's beauty. One night when there is a dance in the town and he knows she is alone at home, he leaves the party surreptitiously, goes to Belinda's house, tries to seduce her and when she resist his advances, he rapes her.\nWhen Dr. Richardson comes back from his trip, she finds her sad and unkempt; her family doesn't know why. Dr. Richardson brings her to a colleague who specializes in hearing, who tells him her deafness is irreversible but not hereditary; the baby she is expecting most probably will have a normal hearing.\nBack in the town, the MacDonalds are saddened and angered, but it comes to Dr. Richardson explaining to Belinda what is happening to her.

Stella, who is about to marry Locky, leaves the doctor's  service in anger, revealing him that the town's people believe he abused the poor dummy.\nBelinda gives birth at home to a healthy baby boy, whom she names Johnny. Dr. Richardson tells Black that he is willing to marry Belinda, as he has grown into loving her. After Black agrees, Dr. Richardson proposes to her, and they kiss. He asks Belinda whether she understand what \"marriage\" means: she does.\nBoycotted by the locals, the doctor goes away in search of a new home and a job position.

While Black is at the mill, he approaches at baby Johnny and talks lovingly at him, saying that he'll grow up to be as tall as his papa. Black hears that, realizes what Locky has done, and attacks him. In the fight, Locky kills Black. Then he makes things look as if an accident happened and flees.\nLocky bribes Pacquet so in his capacity of member of the town's council the shopkeeper talks the town's people into signing a document that declares Belinda unfit to care for the child and award him to Locky and Stella. With that power, they go to take Johnny. Locky makes Stella to enter alone. She realizes that Belinda is a smart and competent mother, who will never give up her baby. Stella retreats and tells Locky that they have no right to take Johnny away. Locky tells his wife that he has the right because he is the father. When he goes to retrieve the boy, Locky pushes Belinda aside easily, but before he can unlock the door of the room where the baby is, Belinda kills him with her father's shotgun.\nBelinda is arrested and goes on trial for murder.

At the start of the film, Shurik is making his way along a mountain road in the Caucasus on a donkey. He comes upon a truck driver named Edik whose truck refuses to start. The donkey gets stubborn and neither man is able to get his respective mode of transportation going.\n\nSuddenly, a young woman named Nina (Natalya Varley) comes walking down the road. The donkey immediately begins to move after her and the truck starts working again. Nina is \"a higher education student, an athlete, a member of the Komsomol, and last but not least \u2014 a beauty\". Her uncle, Comrade Dzhabrail (Frunzik Mkrtchyan), works as a chauffeur for tovarishch (comrade) Saakhov (Vladimir Etush), who is the director of the regional agricultural cooperative and the wealthiest and most powerful man in town. Saakhov likes Nina and invites her to take part in a ribbon-cutting ceremony for a new civil registry. Shurik shows up to the ribbon-cutting completely drunk because the locals refused to tell him local toasts unless he drank to each of them. He ends up becoming disorderly and the militsiya carts him off.\nMeanwhile, Saakhov decides to marry Nina and strikes a deal with Dzhabrail to purchase the bride in return for 20 head of sheep and an imported Finnish Rosenlew refrigerator. Rather than asking for Nina's agreement (which her uncle realizes would be impossible to get), they decide to kidnap her instead. The trio of the Coward, the Fool, and the Pro, hired to do the job, find it difficult to get Nina alone because she has started to spend a lot of time with Shurik. At this point, Saakhov has the idea to unwittingly get Shurik in on it by telling him that the kidnapping of the bride is a local custom. Dzhabrail meets with Shurik in a restaurant and tells him this story, lying to him that Nina has already agreed to marry Saakhov and that she wants to be kidnapped in order to comply with tradition. Shurik is devastated, because he is in love with Nina, but thinking that this is what she wants, he agrees to help.\nNina has gone camping and spends a night in a sleeping bag. Shurik bids her an emotional good-bye; misunderstanding him, she shrugs and also says good-bye. Shurik then zips her up in her sleeping bag and signals to the Coward, the Fool, and the Pro, who run over to grab the helpless Nina and transport her to Saakhov's dacha. Soon after, Shurik learns that the kidnapping was real and that the story about it being a custom was a lie. Shurik immediately runs to the militsiya, but Saakhov (who Shurik does not realize is involved) is waiting for him outside. Saakhov explains to Shurik that if he says anything, the militsiya will arrest him as a co-conspirator and suggests they go straight to the local prosecutor instead. Shurik agrees, but Saakhov tricks him by leading him to a house where there is a party going on and getting him to drink, then calling doctors from the local psychiatric clinic and having Shurik committed.\nMeanwhile, at Saakhov's dacha, the trio of kidnappers lock Nina in a room and try to cheer her up by bringing food and singing songs. Nina pretends to be interested, but then when the kidnappers are distracted, she tries to run away. She is stopped by her uncle and forced to return to her room, where she is locked up. Saakhov arrives with a bottle of wine and goes in to speak with Nina, but runs out moments later covered from head to toe in the wine. Deciding to give Nina some time to \"think about it\", Dzhabrail and Saakhov drive away from the dacha, leaving the trio of kidnappers in charge of Nina.\nAt the hospital, Shurik finally realizes that Saakhov is the one behind the kidnapping. Shurik escapes from the psychiatric ward and happens to run into Edik, the truck driver he had met at the beginning of the film. Together, they drive toward Saakhov's dacha. When they arrive, they have changed into doctors' uniforms and convince the Coward, the Fool, and the Pro that they are doing emergency vaccinations against a dangerous plague that is affecting the area. Under this guise, they inject the trio with sedatives. While Edik is performing the injections, Shurik goes up to Nina's room. Still thinking that he was in on the kidnapping, she hits him over the head with a fruit plate, runs out of the room, jumps out of a first-floor window, and steals one of the trucks.\n\nA car chase ensues in which the kidnappers chase Nina while Shurik and Edik chase the kidnappers. The kidnappers catch up with Nina, commandeer her vehicle, and tie her up, but at that moment the sedative begins to take effect and they all fall asleep. Shurik catches up with the truck right before it veers off the road and stops it. He begins to untie Nina, but she attacks him, still thinking that he is in league with the kidnappers. To reveal his feelings for her, Shurik kisses Nina before he finishes untying her.\nThe action moves to Saakhov's apartment at night. He is alone. Suddenly, Nina, Shurik, and Edik appear, holding weapons, dressed in masks, and calling themselves the enforcers of the \"law of the mountains\". Saakhov does not recognize them and, scared to death, jumps out of the window. Edik shoots him with his shotgun, which turns out to be loaded with nothing more than salt. He hits him in the rump and, when Saakhov is brought up on charges in court the next day, he is unable to sit.

Frankenstein explains that Flanken is his nephew and successor in the monster business. This displeases Francesca who covets the role for herself. Francesca even asks why there was not an invitation for \"It\". Boris replies that \"It\" was not invited since \"It\" can be a crushing bore, explaining that \"It\" even crushed the island's wild boars in his bare hands the last time \"It\" was invited.\nBoris has his zombie butler Yetch (Swift impersonating Peter Lorre), Chef Mafia Machiavelli, and the zombie bellhops and servants make preparations for the upcoming party while having some zombies patrol the Isle of Evil to make sure that \"It\" does not show up uninvited.

Displeased that the monsters tried to steal the secret of total destruction for themselves and attempted to kill Felix as well as having to put up with \"It\", Boris sacrifices his life by dropping the vial containing the formula destroying the Isle of Evil and everything on it.\nThe destruction is witnessed offshore by Felix and Francesca.

The target turns out to be Frenzel, and it is clear that Slattery and Hartmann are in cahoots.\nLaker flies to Copenhagen and meets Anna, a British agent, who has booked a hotel room overlooking Frenzel's suite. He picks up a sniper's rifle that is to be used in the assassination but, when he returns to the hotel, Anna calls the police and Laker is arrested. Jackson, another British agent, eventually arranges his release and Laker, still carrying a case with the gun inside, goes in search Frenzel. However, Frenzel's plans have been changed and he does not arrive in Copenhagen.\nIt becomes apparent that the whole Copenhagen episode has been a ruse designed to increase Laker's stress levels, and to make him increasingly desperate. As a final measure he is sent a telegram saying that his son, who in reality is having a nice holiday with Hartmann, has been killed. As Slattery had anticipated, Laker now returns to Leipzig determined to kill the man responsible - Hartmann. He is able to take his rifle on the plane as hand luggage.\nLaker contacts Ruth, another British agent, who agrees to help him to kill Hartmann. Slattery gives Ruth details of Frenzel's anticipated movements, pretending they are Hartmann's. The Russians, for reasons best known to themselves, transport Frenzel to the airport along a disused motorway where he is extremely vulnerable to an ambush. The distraught Laker kills Frenzel as planned, and is then driven away by Slattery and Hartmann, who reveal that his son is alive after all..", "tmdb_plot": "Sam Laker is an American industrialist, working in Britain, who has just been awarded an international award for industrial design.

The Callums moved to Fara so that Jeff could escape Angela's amorous advances, although as far as Frankie knows, it was only to escape the tedium of life on the mainland.\nNot helping matters is the fact that despite it being the middle of winter, Fara is experiencing a stifling and inexplicable heat wave, with temperatures rising rapidly. It has become so hot that cars stall, beer bottles shatter, televisions explode, and telephones have ceased to work.\nInto this tense situation comes Godfrey Hanson, a mysterious scientist from the mainland, who rents a room at The Swan. Hanson spends his time exploring the island, setting up motion-sensitive cameras and taking soil samples. The locals, including the Callums, find this suspicious, especially since quite a lot more is happening on Fara than just the heat and Hanson's snooping.\nA tramp is burned to death in a cave by something emitting a high-pitched whirring sound. Later, a farmer claims his sheep are all dead. Hanson examines the dead sheep and finds their corpses are badly burned, whilst Swan regular Bob Hayward is attacked by something on the road while driving into the village. He crashes after being blinded by a bright light, which also creates enough heat to ignite the car's petrol tank. Meanwhile, pub regular Tinker, losing his mind because of the heat, attempts to attack Angela whilst she's working, but when she hits him over the head with an ashtray, he flees and ends up burned to death as well. Jeff finally confronts Hanson and demands answers from him. According to the scientist, Fara is the site of an invasion by extraterrestrials, whose extremely high temperature burns any living creature that gets too close to them.\nJeff and Hanson resolve to stop the aliens with the help of local physician Dr. Stone, but when Stone tries to get to Fara's meteorological station so he can alert the mainland of the invasion, he is waylaid by the aliens and killed. Hanson tries next, but witnesses the death of Stella Hayward, Bob's wife, and realises the aliens are attracted to light.

He and Foster will set fire to bales of hay in a field, attracting the aliens, and then lob dynamite into the field, hopefully destroying them, whilst the others signal for help with flare pistols.\nThis plan quickly fails, and Foster and then Hanson are both killed.

His evidence soon points to the killer being one of three German generals: General von Seidlitz-Gabler; General Kahlenberge, his chief of staff; or General Tanz, a highly decorated officer and a favorite of Adolf Hitler. Grau's investigation is cut short by his sudden promotion and transfer to Paris at the instigation of these officers.\nThe case in Warsaw remains closed until all three officers meet in Paris in July 1944. Paris is then a hotbed of intrigue, with senior Wehrmacht officers plotting to assassinate Hitler and overthrow the Nazi government. Kahlenberge is deeply involved in the plot, while von Seidlitz-Gabler is aware of its existence but is sitting on the fence, awaiting the outcome, whilst having various extramarital affairs. Tanz is unaware of the plot and remains totally loyal to Hitler; at some point during the War prior, he transferred to the SS, and is a Waffen-SS General (SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer), in command of the SS-Panzer Division Nibelungen (a fictitious stand-in for the 12th SS Panzer Division).\nOn the night of 19 July 1944, Tanz orders his driver, Kurt Hartmann, to procure a French prostitute; Tanz butchers her so as to implicate Hartmann, but offers Hartmann the chance to desert, which he accepts. When Grau, who is now a Lieutenant Colonel, learns of the murder, committed in the same manner as the first, he resumes his investigation and concludes that Tanz is the killer. However, his timing is unfortunate, because the very next day is the 20 July assassination attempt. While Grau is accusing Tanz face to face, word arrives that Hitler has survived, so Tanz kills Grau and labels him as one of the plot conspirators to cover his tracks.\nJumping to 1965, the murder of a prostitute in Hamburg draws the attention of Interpol Inspector Morand, who owes a debt of gratitude to Grau for not revealing his connection to the French Resistance during the war. Almost certain there is a connection to Grau's 1942 case, Morand reopens the cold case, soon finding a link to the 1944 murder as well. \nMorand begins to tie up the loose ends. He finds no criminal activity from Kahlenberge or Seidlitz-Gabler. However, Morand finds a potential witness when Seidlitz-Galber mentions that he rarely sees his daughter, Ulrike, who lives in a farm near Munich. Morand confronts Tanz, recently released after serving 20 years as a war criminal, at a reunion dinner for Tanz's former panzer division.

The leopard attacks him and he shoots it dead, whereupon David is ambushed and captured by a primitive tribe. They accuse him of disturbing the spirit of the white rhinoceros and take him to their leader's temple. As the high priest makes his decision, David notices a large, ancient stone statue of a white rhino and realises this is what the tribe worship. Interested, David reaches out to touch it. Just as he is about to be killed for his trespassing and disturbing the spirits, David touches the statue and there is a flash of lightning that opens a giant crack in the cave wall.

Angered, Kari orders her guards to throw David into a windowless cell. Coming to his senses, David finds the same woman he encountered earlier, revealing her name as Saria.

In return, one of the fair-haired women must be taken as a thanksgiving for protection.\nDavid is moved to where the other men are, in a cave and now living in fear of Kari. At mealtime, an elder tells David of how it all began; their ancestors moved into the area and hunted the white rhino to extinction. This done, they erected a false image to convince others that they still existed. In doing so, they offended their gods, and the legend of the white rhino was born. The elder explains they were sent a tribe of \"dark people\", who came to this land seeking protection and enslaved them. The only protection Saria's people had was the lie that the white rhino protected them, until a slave girl escaped and told them of the lie. As a result, the men were enslaved and the slave girl was made their queen, Kari. The tribe will only become bonded by the spirit again when the false idol is destroyed.\nAs time passes, a \"Devil\" chooses Saria as the next bride of the white rhino. David urges the men to join forces with the fair-haired women against the dark people. Escaping, the men disrupt the ceremony as the rhino-masked \"Devil\" is about to take Saria. David jumps the \"Devil\" and unmasks him as an African man. David frees Saria as more rhino-masked \"Devils\" emerge from the jungle, but the men and allied women pursue them, unaware they do not know the jungle as well as they do. A battle breaks out between the two tribes in the jungle. Kari sets out through the battle to kill David. Suddenly, there is an almighty roar and both tribes see a white rhino. Despite Kari telling the tribes it is their god, the beast charges and impales the false idol, Kari. The creature begins to drive out the \"Devils\" and disappears into the jungle.\nDavid takes Kari's white rhino brooch and offers it to Saria, who then refuses it, saying that the \"Devils\" will not be returning.

When Daffy recovers, Speedy runs up behind him and shouts out loud, causing Daffy to run away and in turn causing the snare to catapult him back into the ground.\nAfter this, Daffy uses a wind-up doll mouse filled with explosives to try and blow up Speedy. Unfortunately the doll decides that it prefers Daffy to Speedy, resulting in Daffy being blown up instead. Daffy's next strategy is \"Plan X\" - disguising himself as a giant enchilada and delivering himself to Speedy's mouse hole. The mice become suspicious when they see Daffy's tail feathers sticking out of the enchilada however, and decide to fill it with Tabasco sauce.

Palaeontologist Dr Matthew Roney identifies the skull as a five-million-year-old apeman, more ancient than previous finds. One of Roney's assistants uncovers part of a metallic object nearby. Believing it to be an unexploded bomb from the London blitz, they call in an army bomb disposal team.\nMeanwhile, Professor Bernard Quatermass learns that his plans for the colonisation of the Moon are to be taken over by the military, with plans to establish ballistic missile bases in space. He gives a cold reception to Colonel Breen, who has been assigned to Quatermass's British Experimental Rocket Group. When the bomb disposal team call for Breen's assistance, Quatermass accompanies him to the site. Breen concludes the buried object is a V-weapon, but Quatermass disagrees. When another skull is found within a chamber of the \"bomb\", Quatermass and Roney realise that the object itself must also be five million years old. Noting the object's imperviousness to heat, Quatermass suspects it is of alien origin, but Roney is certain the apemen were terrestrial.\nRoney's assistant, Barbara Judd, goes to the site with Quatermass. She becomes intrigued by the name of the area, recalling that \"Hob\" is an old name for the Devil. A local policeman tells them the legend that the bombed-out house opposite the station is haunted. All three go there to investigate. The policeman is so spooked that he has to leave. A member of the bomb disposal team witnesses a spectral apparition of Roney's apeman appearing through the wall of the object. Quatermass and Barbara find historical accounts of hauntings and other spectral appearances going back many centuries, coinciding with disturbances of the ground around Hobbs End.\nAn attempt to open a sealed chamber in the object using a Borazon drill fails. A few moments later, however, a small hole is seen, though the drill operator, Sladden, is certain he is not responsible for it. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests they came from Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between their appearance and images of the Devil, while Quatermass believes the spaceship is the source of the spectral images and disturbances.\nQuatermass and Roney reveal their findings to the press, attracting the ire of a government minister who has not sanctioned their statements. Quatermass theorises that the occupants of the spaceship came from a dying Mars. Unable to survive on Earth, they sought to preserve some part of their race by creating a colony by proxy, by significantly enhancing the intelligence of and imparting Martian faculties to the indigenous primitive hominids. Quatermass theorizes the highly advanced alien insectoids used medical and surgical techniques that were far more advanced than even those on present-day Earth. The descendants of these apemen evolved into humans, retaining the vestiges of Martian influence buried in their subconscious. A disbelieving Breen thinks the \"alien craft\" is Nazi propaganda designed to sow fear among Londoners. The minister believes Breen and decides to unveil the spaceship at a press conference.\nWhilst dismantling his drill, Sladden is overcome by a powerful psychic force, and haphazardly runs away. His mind unleashes powerful telekinetic energy displays, disrupting people and property. He finally comes to rest in a church, where Judd and Quatermass find him. Sladden tells Quatermass he saw a vision of hordes of insect creatures under an alien sky. He also relates that he saw himself as one of them and that he felt that he had to desperately run away in fear of his life. Quatermass returns to Hobbs End, bringing a machine Roney has been working on, which taps into the primeval psyche. While trying to replicate the circumstances under which Sladden was affected, he notices that Barbara has fallen under the spaceship's influence. Using Roney's machine, he records her thoughts. Quatermass presents the recording to the minister and other officials. It shows hordes of Martians engaged in what he interprets as a genocidal race purge, to cleanse the Martian hives of all mutations. The minister and Breen dismiss the recording.\nDisaster strikes when a power line is dropped within the craft, giving it a massive jolt of electrical energy. The effect and range of the spaceship's influence on those Londoners susceptible to it increases; they go on a rampage, attacking all those perceived as different, with powerful, deadly telekinetic displays of energy. Breen is drawn towards the spaceship and killed by the intense, roasting energy emanating from it. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that a small portion of the population are immune. The psychic energy intensifies, ripping up streets and buildings, while a spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, itself resembling the image of the Devil of legend. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises that the Martian energy can be discharged into the earth. While Quatermass prevents Barbara stopping him, Roney climbs a building crane and swings it into the spectral image. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney. The image and its effects on London disappear. Quatermass and Judd stand amidst the devastation of London, slowly recovering from the personal upheaval the alien energy has wreaked on them.", "tmdb_plot": "An ancient Martian spaceship is unearthed in London, and proves to have powerful psychic effects on the people around.", "tmdb_id": "26912", "wiki_id": "871066"}, {"title": "Raat Aur Din", "genres": ["Thriller", "Mystery"], "wiki_plot": "Once, during a late night a woman named Varuna goes to a club and dances with an unknown club man named Dilip.

The base is run by Louis Strago, who in conjunction with former Nazi Dr. von Kronen is planning to detonate atomic bombs in the Atlantic Ocean.  The bombs will cause the Gulf Stream to divert, wreaking havoc in Europe and the United States and warming Greenland sufficiently for it to become a strategic new home for THRUSH (\"THRUSHland\").\nThe agents are split up after an encounter with THRUSH, with Solo having to hide overnight in the house of Pia Monteri. When Pia's grandmother learns of this, she considers it a disgrace to her family's reputation (despite Solo's insistence that nothing inappropriate happened) and insists at the end of a shotgun that Solo marry Pia.  Solo manages to escape, but Pia and her grandmother enlist the aid of Pia's uncles to find him and return him for marriage.  Her uncles are the Stilleto brothers, Prohibition era gangsters in the U.S. who miss the \"good old days\". Solo barely escapes the wedding.\nIn one scene, 'Fingers' Stiletto smashes what appears to be a grapefruit half into the face of his wife, played by Joan Blondell. Blondell then breaks the 'fourth wall' by turning and staring straight into the camera with a look of exasperation. This is likely an homage to a similar scene between James Cagney and Mae Clark from 1931's 'The Public Enemy', in which Blondell also starred. Later in the film, Miss Diketon (Janet Leigh) comes to the rescue of Ilya Kuryakin (David McCallum) by stabbing one of the THRUSH thugs in the back with a large dagger, perhaps a tongue-in-cheek nod to her notorious role as a stabbing victim in 'Psycho' just a few years earlier.Kuryakin and, ultimately, Pia, are captured by Strago and taken to his island base from which the bombs will be launched. Tortured by Miss Diketon (who truly loves her work), Kuryakin is to be executed at a party held for Strago's immediate superior in THRUSH, Mr. Thaler.  U.N.C.L.E. learns of the plot thanks to Solo's efforts and sends an assault force to bomb the island, killing everyone on it.  With Mr. Waverly's reluctant approval, Solo attempts a rescue of Kuryakin and Pia before the bombers attack.  Strago's defenses prove too much, however, and Solo finds himself allied with the Stilleto brothers - who have come to the island as well in search of Pia.  Miss Diketon betrays Strago due to his dismissal of her over a minor error, and with her help U.N.C.L.E. and the Stilletos are able to stop the missile launch.  Strago, Thaler, and von Kronen are killed in the process.   Diketon also dies in the fight, enjoying both the physical pain she is feeling and the fact that she saw Strago's plan fail.

Moran gives the order to have Patsy Lolordo, a crony and personal friend of Capone's who is also the representative of the Sicilian Mafia in Chicago, eliminated in order to replace him with an envoy more sympathetic to Moran. Moran's assassination plan sees him conspire with low-level mafiosi Joe Aiello to kill Lolordo and replace him with Aiello.

The pupils, led by Bert Denham and Pamela Dare (who later develops a strong crush on Thackeray), behave badly: their antics range from vandalism to distasteful pranks. Thackeray retains a calm demeanour, but loses his temper when he discovers something being burned in the classroom stove, which turns out to be a girl's sanitary towel. He orders the boys out of the classroom, then reprimands all the girls, either for being responsible or passively observing, for what he says is their \"slutty behaviour\". Thackeray is angry with himself for allowing his pupils to incense him. Changing his approach, he informs the class that they will no longer study from textbooks. Until the end of term, he will treat them as adults and expects them to behave as such. He declares that they will address him as 'Sir' or 'Mr. Thackeray'; the girls will be addressed as 'Miss' and boys by their surnames. They are also allowed to discuss any issue they wish. He gradually wins over the class, except for Denham who continually baits him.\nThackeray arranges a class outing to the Victoria and Albert Museum and the Natural History Museum in South Kensington which goes well. The trip is represented by a series of still photographs as Lulu sings \"To Sir with Love\".\nHe loses some support when he defuses a potentially violent situation between his student Potter and the gym teacher, Mr. Bell. He demands that Potter apologise directly to Bell, even if he believes Bell was wrong. The group later refuses to invite Thackeray to the class dance. When mixed-race student Seales' white English mother dies, the class takes up a collection for a wreath but refuse to accept Thackeray's donation. The students decline to deliver the wreath in person to Seales' house, fearing neighbourhood gossip for visiting a \"coloured\" person's house.\nThe headmaster tells Thackeray that the \"adult approach\" has failed, and future outings are cancelled. Thackeray is to take over the boys' gym classes until the headmaster can find a replacement. Meanwhile, Thackeray receives an engineering job offer in the post.\nPamela Dare's mother asks for Thackeray to talk to her daughter about her behaviour at home, but this annoys Pamela, whom Thackeray believes is infatuated with him.

The British approve a plan to destroy German fuel bunkers at Tobruk in an attempt to cripple Rommel's attack.\nThe author of the plan, Canadian-born Major Donald Craig (Rock Hudson) of the Long Range Desert Group (LRDG) had been captured by Vichy French forces and is held prisoner, along with captured Italian Army soldiers, on a ship in the port of the French city of Algiers. As his expertise is considered essential to the success of the raid, Craig is rescued by Captain Kurt Bergman (George Peppard) of the Special Identification Group (SIG) and some of his men, German Jews serving with the British. They then join up with commandos of the Long Range Desert Group, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel John Harker (Nigel Green), at Kufra in southeastern Libya.\nColonel Harker explains they have eight days to get to Tobruk and destroy the fuel depot and German fortress artillery pieces protecting the harbour, before a scheduled amphibious landing and a bombing raid on the city by the Royal Air Force (RAF). They are to drive there through enemy territory posing as prisoners of war escorted by the SIG pretending to be guards. Once they reach Tobruk they would then link up with a full British naval and RAF assault on the city and their primary objective, Rommel's underground fuel bunkers.\nCraig is highly skeptical of the operation, claiming that \"Staff has a genius for sitting on its brains and coming up with perfect hindsight\", stating that \"When I submitted the plan we could have blown up the fuel bunkers with a handful of men. How in hell are we supposed to get through their defenses now?\" While warning Craig not to let personal differences of opinion interfere with the operation, Colonel Harker also reveals that he was the genius with perfect hindsight who convinced Staff to approve Craig's original plan which would now be \"maximum effort, land, sea and air\".\nOn the way, they encounter a patrol of Italian tanks, which stops a short distance from where they are resting in a gully. Later that night, Sergeant Major Jack Tyne (Jack Watson) spots a tank column approaching from the opposite direction. After Bergman and three of his men kill the Italian sentries, Colonel Harker, surmising that the approaching column \"must be German -- the Italians are too fond of comfort to travel this late\", tricks the two units into attacking each other by firing mortars, first at the Germans and then the Italians, enabling the raiders to sneak away.\nTo avoid detection the next day, Craig safely guides them through a German mine field, before they are attacked by a British Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter. They manage to shoot it down, but eight men are killed and one troop transport truck, their auxiliary fuel supply, and both of their radios are destroyed. The fighting attracts Tuareg tribesmen, who are friendly with the Germans. Craig, who speaks their language, exchanges some guns and ammunition for two prisoners.\nThe prisoners turn out to be British traitors Henry Portman (Liam Redmond), who has an Irish accent, and his daughter Cheryl (Heidy Hunt), who were shot down while flying from Benghazi to Cairo. They have papers signed by the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem (Mohammad Amin al-Husayni) and German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring: an agreement for \"a group of important\" Egyptian army officers to rise up against the British in a \"holy war.\" The belief of the Germans is with Egypt conquered other Muslim, former Ottoman Empire states such as Turkey will then side with the Axis; Cheryl Portman states that the \"Turks, alone, could put four million men into the war against the Soviet Union.\"\nThat night, the Portmans are told by a mysterious SIG member about the British masquerade and where to find a gun and a map to an underground telephone cable nearby where they can contact German command in Tobruk and alert them to the British column and upcoming attack. When they reach the telephone, however, they are spotted by an Italian patrol. Henry Portman fires at the patrol and is killed, while his daughter is seriously wounded.\nHarker sends Bergman and Sergeant Krug (Leo Gordon) after the Portmans where they retrieve Cheryl from the Italians. When Krug asks how they knew about the telephone, Bergman replies, \"Very simple. One among us is the enemy\". Harker has Bergman and his men disarmed and then gives Bergman two hours to identify his traitor. The traitor kills Cheryl Portman so she cannot reveal his identity. Lieutenant Max Mohnfeld (Guy Stockwell), Bergman's second in command, appears from the tunnel the Portmans used to escape. He states the traitor is down the shaft. They find Corporal Bruckner (Robert Wolders), one of Bergman's closest friends for ten years, stabbed to death. Cheryl Portman had died from cyanide, and Bruckner's suicide tablet is missing.

The wealthy and successful architect Mark Wallace and his wife Joanna drive their 1965 Mercedes 230SL past a wedding on the way to Lydd Airport, where they take a British United Air Ferries flight to France. Upon arriving in France, they begin a drive to Saint-Tropez to meet with Mark's longtime client, Maurice Dalbret. As they make their way to the south of France, the unhappy couple reflect on four previous trips they made along the same route. The film jumps between their present and past trips to show how their relationship has broken down over time.\nThe first trip takes place in 1954 when Mark and Joanna catch sight of each other on a ferry from England to Dieppe. Mark is a young architect on a photography trip, while Joanna is travelling with her choir to a festival in Menton. When the ferry arrives in Dieppe, Mark becomes alarmed thinking he has lost his passport, but Joanna finds it in the top of his backpack. On the road to Abbeville, Mark and Joanna cross paths again after the choir's Volkswagen Microbus runs off the road and he stops to help them. Mark travels with the girls to Abbeville, and after everyone but Joanna and him catches chickenpox, the two go on alone together southwards. Mark tries repeatedly to ditch Joanna, but she stays with him. She finally tells Mark she loves him, and they spend the night together. Eventually they arrive at the Mediterranean where they stay in cheap hotels and spend their days at the beach. At the end of their week together, Mark asks Joanna to marry him.\nThe second trip is in 1957 when the Wallaces have been married two years. On this trip, they travel with a family from Erie, Pennsylvania, in a 1957 Ford Country Squire. The family consists of Mark's former girlfriend from the University of Chicago, Cathy Seligman, her husband Howard Maxwell-Manchester, and their daughter Ruthie. The relationship between the Wallaces and Maxwell-Manchesters is notably strained, in large part due to Ruthie's disagreeableness. After Ruthie says out loud in the car that Cathy called Joanna a \"suburban English nobody,\" Mark and Joanna leave the Maxwell-Manchesters and continue travelling by themselves.\nThe third trip takes place in June 1959, when the Wallaces travel for the first time on their own as a married couple, driving a rundown 1950 MG TD. This is the happiest of the couple's trips in France. Along the way, Joanna announces that she is pregnant. After the MG catches fire while driving, the Wallaces pull into a luxury hotel, the Domaine Saint-Just. They stay the night at the hotel and in the morning push the burnt-out car away. On the road, they are picked up in a Bentley S1 by a wealthy couple that was also staying at the Domaine. The couple, Maurice and Fran\u00e7oise Dalbret, mention that they need an architect, and after learning that this is Mark's profession, ask if he would help them. The Wallaces stay at the Dalbret villa in Ramatuelle, where Maurice gives him the details of the project and introduces him to his Greek partner Nikos Palamos. At the end of the trip Dalbret hires Mark to work for him.\nSometime after the birth of the Wallaces' daughter, Mark travels alone to France in a red 1961 Triumph Herald. During the trip he spends a night in a hotel with a woman named Simone. This sequence includes a voiceover of Mark reading a letter to Joanna, in which he lies about his activities and claims disingenuously to miss her.\nIn 1963, Mark and Joanna travel in the Triumph, now with their daughter Caroline, to see the project Mark is working on for Dalbret and Palamos. The Wallaces fight continually during the trip. When they arrive at the Dalbret property, Joanna meets Fran\u00e7oise's brother, David, and begins an affair with him. After she and David spend the night together Mark confronts them, and Joanna confesses she is in love with David. David later gives her the choice to leave Mark and come with him, however, she elects to return to Mark.\nOn their present trip in 1966, the Wallaces stay at or pass through many of the same locations from previous trips. During the drive, they discuss their failing marriage and the possibility of a divorce. When they stop for the night in a hotel, Mark is engrossed in work and pays little attention to Joanna. They arrive finally at the house Mark designed for the Comte and Comtesse de Florac on the fictional Cap Val\u00e9ry. There is a party at the house and the guests include David and his fianc\u00e9e Sylvia, and Maurice. During the party, Mark receives a phone call from the potential client Hal Van Benius, who says that he has hired Mark for a job that will require him to be in the United States for two years. Mark and Joanna sneak out of the party and take a slow drive through the forest. While they drive, they admit to one another that despite their frequent unhappiness and past unfaithfulness, they love one another and could never be apart.\nIn the final scene, the couple is crossing the Franco\u2013Italian border on the way to meet Van Benius in Rome.

After the funeral rites, Khoma is told of a huntsman who fell in love with the young girl, and how when she came into the stable and asked his help to get on her horse, he said he would like it more if she rode on his back, then took her on his back and ran off with her, reminding Khoma of his encounter (the men telling the tale suspect the girl was a witch). He is taken to the chapel where the girl's body lies and is locked in for the night.\nAs soon as Khoma walks in, several cats scurry across the floor at his feet. He lights every candle in the chapel for comfort, then begins to recite the prayers for the girl's soul. He pauses to sniff tobacco, and when he sneezes, the girl opens her eyes and climbs out of the coffin, blindly searching for him (apparently, she can hear but cannot see). He quickly draws a sacred circle of chalk around himself, and this acts as a barrier\u2014the night passes with Khoma praying fervently and the girl trying to get to him. When the rooster crows in the morning, the girl returns to her coffin and all the candles blow out.\nThe men of the rich man's estate, who escort Khoma to and from the chapel, surround him and asked what happened that night, to which he replies, \"Nothing much. Just some noises.\"\nKhoma gets drunk to strengthen himself for the second night. This time, a flurry of birds fly out from the coffin, startling him into running for the door, which is shut by one of the rich man's men. Khoma returns to the prayer podium and is frightened by a bird flying out his prayer book. He draws the sacred circle again and begins the prayers. The whole covered coffin rises into the air and bangs against the protection of the sacred circle, causing a panicked Khoma to cry out to God to protect him. The cover falls off the coffin, and the girl sits up and again starts reaching blindly to him, but once more, she cannot see him or get to him. The coffin continues to fly around the room as the girl reaches blindly for Khoma and calls his name. As the rooster crows, the coffin returns to its place and the girl lies down, but her voice is heard placing a curse on Khoma, to turn his hair white and render him blind\u2014however, his hair actually turns grey and he retains his sight. The rich man's men have to help him off the floor and out of the chapel, placing a hat on his head. When they return to the farm, Khoma demands music and begins dancing as a young boy plays on his flute. He removes his hat, and all the servants can see his hair is grey. He asks to speak to their master, saying he will explain what happened and that he doesn't want to pray in the chapel any more.\nKhoma meets with the rich man, trying to explain what happened in the chapel and begging to be allowed to leave, but the rich man threatens him with a thousand lashes if he refuse\u2014and a thousand pieces of gold if he succeeds. In spite of this, Khoma tries to escape, but makes a wrong turn and winds up in the hands of the rich man's men, and is returned to the farm.\nHe returns to the chapel a third time, drunk, but still remembers to draw the sacred circle before beginning the prayers. The girl sits up on the coffin and begins to curse him, causing him to have visions of walking skeletons and grasping, ghostly hands. She summons various hideous, demonic figures to torment him, but they cannot get past the sacred circle either. She finally calls on Viy, a name which causes all the demons to tremble in fear. A large monster emerges, and orders his huge eyelids to be moved from his eyes. Khoma realizes he cannot look this demon in the eye or he is lost. Viy is able to see Khoma, which allows the other demons to pounce on him and beat him, but when the rooster crows once more, the demons all flee away, leaving Khoma motionless on the floor. The girl turns back into the old woman and lies down in the coffin, which instantly falls apart. The Rector enters the chapel to this scene, and races off to tell the others.\nThe last scene shows Khoma's two friends from the start of the movie back at the seminary, painting some walls. One offers to drink to Khoma's memory, while the other doubts that Khoma is really dead.\nThe movie follows the original tale in a somewhat loose fashion, but manages to retain the majority of the images and action.", "tmdb_plot": "A young priest is ordered to preside over the wake of a witch in the church of a remote village.

Wes Fletcher, an elderly wagon driver employed by Pierce to transport dry goods, becomes Jackson's informant. The third member Jackson recruits for his team is Lomax, a gunslinger and safecracker, who earlier shot Jackson as part of Pierce's plot.\nThe fourth team member is Levi Walking Bear, a Kiowa translator, whom Jackson and Lomax rescue from a gang of Mexican bandits.

When the team first meets to discuss their plan, Fletcher brings his teenage \"wife\" Kate along, and flies into a jealous rage when Hyatt gives her some coffee.\nJackson and Levi negotiate with the Kiowas; because Pierce is deliberately starving the tribe off of their land, they agree to help. Meanwhile, Lomax rides into town and is approached in a saloon by Pierce, who offers him $12,000 to kill Jackson. An inebriated Hyatt enters, and comes dangerously close to revealing the plan. Lomax knocks him unconscious and hands him over to the Sheriff for the night, then accepts Pierce's offer, but asks for time to do the job.\nIn the morning, Jackson sends Hyatt to Fletcher's farm. Hyatt finds Kate alone, and she reveals that her impoverished parents had traded her to Fletcher. Fletcher returns and threatens Hyatt with a knife, but Jackson arrives in time to defuse the situation. Hyatt says he wants to use nitroglycerin for his part of the heist, so he, Jackson, and Lomax sneak onto Jackson's old ranch to steal some from Pierce.

Also unwilling to be of help to Valens is the doctor's nurse, Liz Thayer, who knew Ruston only as a humanitarian who made many trips to Mexico to unselfishly aid people in need. Even the elderly lady whom Dr. Ruston often came to visit, Alice Willows, speaks only with devotion to the doctor, who was very kind to her beloved dog.

Since the gang's next target is unknown, Dorn recruits Rod as an uncover agent to discover their plans. In order to make sure the gang believes that Rod is genuinely interested in joining their gang, the police set Rod up in auto race in which another undercover officer runs him off the track forcing him to crash his car.
