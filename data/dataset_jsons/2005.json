When her new stepfather becomes the Commandant of a military school, George Washington Military Academy, Kelly and her mom move upstate. Kelly has to enroll at the school, since it is the only school in the area, leaving behind her art school and her best friend Amanda (Sarah Gadon). On her first day at military school, she befriends Carla (Andrea Lewis), a girl who has been there for a long time and shows her the ropes. Kelly, at first, has trouble fitting in and obeying the orders of the officers above her, especially Cadet Captain Jennifer Stone (Christy Carlson Romano), who has a crush on Cadet Major Brad Rigby (Shawn Ashmore). Kelly feels drawn to Brad instantly, and competes with Captain Stone for his attention. Captain Stone does not treat Kelly well, verbally abusing her by calling her \"maggot\" and destroying her personal belongings. After taking a long time to complete the obstacle course, Captain Stone has Kelly take the course again. After getting all dirty from the course and finishing it, Kelly heads to the dance, but accidentally stumbles and ruins Captain Stone's dress at the dance, much to her anger. Her stepfather talks to Kelly in his office about the incident and what the teachers are saying about her. At home, Kelly is ready to tell her mom about her feelings and opinions of the new school, but before she could even start, her mother reveals to her that Kelly is going to have a half-sibling (implying that her mother and her stepfather are going to have a baby together). Seeing that her mom needs her support, she vows to help her stepfather learn how to take care of a child and make him \"ready\" to be a dad. To get back at Captain Stone for destroying one of her blankets, Kelly decides to paint Stone's hair in the middle of the night as payback, in the same pattern as a blanket that Stone ruined.\nThe next day, Captain Stone gives Kelly a citation, so she is forced to appear in Cadet Court. In Cadet Court, she is found guilty of many infractions. She is sentenced by her stepfather to take care of and shine the uniforms of the drill team, which she had, earlier in the film, referred to as a team of robots. However, she gradually takes a liking to them and decides to try out for the team, seeing that they need some inspiration. With the help of another friend of hers, Gloria (Aimee Garcia), she practices enough and makes the team.\nAfter Kelly was following some moves that Captain Stone was practicing, Cadet Major Rigby made the suggestion that they could incorporate the moves into a routine for regionals. Kelly asks Captain Stone if they could work on a routine together for regionals, and Captain Stone agrees to discuss it with her. Kelly's team makes it to the regionals, which will be held at a different school. Kelly's dad surprises her by revealing that he will be working a job nearby, and can make it to the regionals to see her perform. The day of the competition, however, he does not show up and Kelly begins to worry. Her stepfather notices that she is distressed and asks her to explain the situation to him. Kelly tells him that she has received a phone call from her father that was cut off, which she finds strange. She refers to her cell phone as her and her father's \"lifeline\", and says that he would only call if it was an absolute emergency. Seeing that Kelly needs help, he excuses her from the competition and goes with her to the location her father said he would be. They find him on a cliff, as he has fallen down. Kelly doesn't want to leave him alone, so she uses her new training to rappel down the cliffside and stay by her father. Joe calls for help, and a rescue team arrives to bring him and Kelly back up. After her stepfather hugs her instead of saluting her, Kelly realizes that Joe has become more fatherly, she tells both of her dads that she is proud to be their daughter.\nKelly runs back to the competition to find that they are down by five points. The only chance they have of winning is a special routine that Kelly and Stone had been practicing. They perform it, and receive excellent marks from the reviewing board. George Washington places second, the best they have ever done, by one point. Stone tells Kelly that if she hadn't joined the team, they never would have made it that far. Kelly, overjoyed to hear Stone praise her for once,  gives her a hug, which she is surprised by, but returns anyway. Kelly vows that they will win next year as long as she and Stone keep practicing their routine, but Stone reveals that she's moving to Europe because her father, who is in the Army, has been transferred there. Stone tells Kelly that she'd like for Kelly to one day become a platoon leader and have to deal with a \"maggot\" just like her.

The only way to escape the world is by activating the Ark, an ancient giant robot capable of supporting a human city as well as traveling through space.\nJames Woods plays Jallak, the military general of the reigning civilization, the Storrians, who captured the Ark from the Ceveans. But they are unable to get the Ark to work in order to save their people. The Ceveans, having been enslaved and with only the wasteland to roam free are constantly attacked and brutalised by the Storrians. A leader of their resistance movement is a young resistance fighter named Rogan. Rogan is arrested during a resistance uprising, but manages to escape. He bumps into the general's adopted daughter Amarinth, whom the general had secretly rescued from a Cevean hibernation pod cluster where they had hidden their children for safety. They then meet again during a civilian protest rally and she offers to help hide him and tend to his wounds. Rogan goes with her back to her apartment and meets her pet JuJu, but then vanishes when he discovers she's the Storrian general's daughter.\nBaramanda, the Empress's manipulative right-hand man, arrives unexpectedly to take Amarinth into custody after discovering the truth of her lineage. Rogan helps her escape from Baramanda and takes her to the resistance base within the slave quarters of the Ark. There she meets with an elderly man who explains Amarinth's birthright with the help of JuJu, who turns out to have originally belonged to him. Unknown to Rogan, and to Amarinth herself, she turns out to be the daughter of the Cevean priestess who originally built the Ark, Amiel, who had disappeared 100 years earlier. \nAmiel helped construct not just the Ark the Storrians hold, but another known as The Ark of York. The plans for the Arks passed down from the Gods (another alien race). It took all her strength to create them, causing her to fall into a deep sleep and not awaken again. Before entering her eternal hibernation, she placed her very young daughter into the hidden hibernation pod. Then her body was secretly hidden by her people until discovered by the Storrians.\nThey find Amiel's molecular structure enables her body to generate a pulsing electronic field throughout her bloodstream. Not only does this make her body perfectly preserved despite how long she had been inactive, it is the reason the Arks will not work: she and Amarinth are descendants of the gods themselves and only they have the ability to pilot the Arks. A cell of her dead blood can supply power to an entire building, but it becomes apparent that no matter how much energy Amiel's body retains, since she is dead it's not enough to move the ark.\nBoth civilizations scramble to use Amiel's daughter, Amarinth, to activate their Ark and leave the other civilization behind to die. However, Amarinth, who has ties to both civilizations, wishes to try to find a way to use her power to save everyone. She is opposed by the lifeforce-stealing wraith Baramanda, who wishes to steal the power of the Ark for his own selfish purposes.\nAmarinth after going to the Ark of York, refuses to pilot it and leave the Storrians behind. Despite her lineage as a Cevean, she was raised as a Storrian. When she finds out her father, Jallak, had been arrested for high treason and was to be executed for hiding her, she demands that Rogan and the others help her rescue him if they want her help. They agree and return to save him.\nAfter freeing Jallak, Baramunda tries to drain Amarith's blood but is stopped by Amiel who awakens momentarily to stop him. All escape but Jallak remains behind to save his people, as the Ark starts to fall apart. Rogan takes Amarinth back to The Ark of York as Baramanda merges with the core of the other Ark and awakens it. Amarinth discovers that, just as her mother Amiel died in constructing the Arks, so she would perish to pilot one. Rogan and Amarinth kiss for the first and final time as she merges with the core of York just as The Ark comes stomping up to it. The Arks clash in a giant battle with the earth breaking down beneath their feet. Amarinth grabs the city plate off of SidArk as Jallak and his friend set the self-destruct mechanism. They perish in the explosion as the planet begins to crumble.\nRogan narrates at the end as it shows The Ark of York kneeling with the SidArk city plate on another planet flourishing with vegetation. He states that no one knew both civilizations would make it and neither does anyone think it would work out, living together, sharing the planet. He continues saying that it was hard to imagine that their old world, which was now no more, might have looked like this before the war. So the Storrians and Ceveans are going to try to coexist, to preserve this planet and Amarinth's sacrifice. It's difficult at times, and Rogan wishes that Amarinth was there to bridge the gap between the two civilizations.

He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.\nBob summons Tommy, alone, for a meeting.

Wright nurses Sullivan and discovers his rash, where Abers recognizes it as meningitis and the group realizes that if the Germans don't kill them, the disease will.\nDays later, U-428 prepares to attack an American destroyer, the fictional USS Logan (based on the real USS Logan. Travers and his group break free of their bonds. They are able to fire one of the German sub's torpedoes off course, away from the Logan. When the torpedo detonates the Logan is alerted to the U-boat's presence. The Logan then attacks U-429 with depth charges. The explosions allows CO Sullivan's group to break free as well. Sullivan protects his crew by fighting off a German guard, but he succumbs to his illness in the process.\nMeanwhile, the meningitis spreads and kills two thirds of the German crew, including Romano of the American crew. Later on, Travers has a hallucination of Rachel, who reminds him of his promise to come home.\nWith no other choice, U-429's CO Jonas decides to have Travers' men work with his remaining crew in order to save them all. They plan to sail to the US coast and be taken into custody. As both crews reluctantly work together, Jonas explains to Travers that he saved Travers' men in defiance of the standing protocol of capturing only the captain and COB of an enemy ship. He says he personally saved all of them because he's grown tired of the war and he felt strong for himself by saving lives instead of taking them.\nJonas says if they come across either enemy, they must guarantee that their men will go home. During their travel to the US coast, Klause (Heger), the U-429's quartermaster, becomes disillusioned with Jonas working with the Americans and orchestrates a mutiny, along with two other crew members, Lieutenant Bauer and the U-429's radio operator Christophe. Abers and Wright subdue Christophe, who makes a distress call to other U-boats, and engineer Hans (Thorsen) knocks out Bauer to save Ox. Klause unsuccessfully attempts to use the last bow torpedo to blow up the boat and with his knife fatally stabs Jonas in the back. Travers reacts by using a hoist chain to break Klause's neck, killing him quickly. With his dying breath, Jonas gives command of the boat to Cremer.\nThe U-429 crew again encounters the Logan and tries to make contact with the destroyer, but they're attacked by U-1221, another U-boat that responded to the distress call. U-1221 fires several torpedoes in an attempt to sink the U-429, while the Logan is once again put on the alert. Enduring heavy damage as they evade every torpedo attack, two German crew members try to convince Cremer to fight back, but he refuses to fire on his own countrymen.\nAbers and Travers convince Cremer to fight, only for him to reveal that they only have one torpedo left in the stern. After passing on top of the enemy submarine to align the stern tubes with it, the crew uses the last torpedo to destroy the U-1221, but it doesn't detonate. U-1221 fires another torpedo U-429 but it doesn't cause any serious damage. Before the torpedo explodes, the Logan locates the U-1221 with its sonar and fires its guns into the water, destroying the U-boat.\nWhen Travers makes contact with the Logan, Captain Samuel Littleton (Ellis) orders Travers to take the Enigma. Travers falsifies that they're sinking and disconnects with the Logan, keeping his promise to Cremer to never let the U-429 be captured. The crew floods the boat and are rescued by the Logan.\nReturning home, Travers argues with Kentz about the Germans saving their lives. Kentz says the Germans are still the enemy, but he'll do his best to have them taken care of. Travers and Rachel are reunited and they go visit Cremer in a POW compound, where Rachel thanks Cremer for saving her husband's life. Travers gives him cigarettes and tells Cremer that it's good to see him as Travers leaves and Cremer watches on.", "tmdb_plot": "At the height of Hitler's infamous U-boat war, the crew of the U.S.S.

After dressing her in a uniform matching theirs and brushing and braiding her hair, the girls all exchange hair ribbons: each girl gets the ribbons passed down from the girl a year above her, and the colour marks their age and year in the school. Iris, the new youngest \"red ribbon\", unfortunately excites the ire of seven-year-old Selma, the former red ribbon and now orange ribbon, who complains about the absence of the former violet-ribbon Natashka\u2014the oldest who had been her friend. The new violet ribbon, twelve-year-old Bianca, takes Iris under her wing. At first Iris is homesick, and wants to be reunited with her brother, but Bianca matter-of-factly tells her there is no possibility of that: there are no boys allowed in the school. All of the girls in the school go swimming in the lake, and Iris quickly befriends Laura, the red-ribbon of another house. That night, much to Iris's dismay, Bianca leaves on an authorized mysterious errand that she cannot discuss. The next day, Iris has a routine day at the school \u2013 dance lessons, classroom time with animals, and recreation. The classes at the school are run by two pretty young women: Mademoiselle Edith, who walks with a cane and teaches lessons, and Mademoiselle Eva, who teaches dance. Each house is cared for by an elderly serving woman; the girls whisper that all of the employees are girls who tried to escape the walled school in their youth, and were pressed into permanent service as punishment.\nOne night, Iris follows Bianca on her secret errand, but she loses track of the older girl once she reaches the main building. She explores, but only stumbles across more she does not understand: a shadowy man preparing an injection for a shadowy girl (possibly Bianca.) She flees, and is lost in the woods for the night. After a period of smouldering animosity, Selma makes overtures to befriend Iris, but then beats her with a switch (stem) when Iris asks about Bianca's nightly departures. Selma also uses her fingertip, touching Iris's wound, to gingerly taste Iris's blood. As time passes, Laura, unlike Iris, is morose and unable to adapt to life at the school. With Iris's help \u2013 and a pledge of secrecy \u2013 she steals a rowboat in an attempt to escape, but drowns when the boat starts to leak and the weather turns sour. A distressed Iris tells Bianca what Laura has done. The school holds a funeral, where Laura's coffin is burned on a pyre.\nAs winter arrives, the focus shifts to the ten-year-old Alice, the fifth-year blue ribbon, who is hungry to leave the school and see the world outside. She has placed her hopes on winning the annual inspection of the blue ribbons, where the mysterious headmistress arrives from afar and, after watching them dance, chooses one girl from the class to leave the school early with her for an unknown reason. Though Edith cautions that she shouldn't get her hopes up, Alice has been anticipating this moment \u2013 and her own winning of the honour of leaving. Though the competition is close, another girl is chosen instead. Hysterical, Alice collapses at the headmistress's feet. She convalesces, but isn't the same as before: she doesn't speak, and aimlessly and perpetually stares into space. Finally, she runs out into the woods surrounding the school buildings, and climbs over the stone wall that surrounds the school. As we see her flee into the snowy woods beyond, camouflaged by her white uniform, we hear the sound of distant gunshots and barking dogs. Later, as Eva looks pensively out a window, Edith informs her that Alice cannot be found; she then informs the other girls that Alice has been very bad, and will not be seen or spoken of again.\nAfter Alice's escape (and possible death), the focus turns to Bianca. The violet ribbons are told about the bodily changes that they will soon experience, and Bianca grows pensive. For the first time, she brings Nadja, the black-ribbon girl a year her junior, along on her nighttime trip. Together, they go to the main school building, and enter a secret passage behind the grandfather clock. There, the girls get into butterfly costumes, and prepare: each night they put on a dance recital for a mysterious audience. The next night, Nadja falters, but a man in the audience calls out to Bianca, telling her she is the most beautiful, and throws her a rose. After the show, Bianca and another girl explore the empty theater. They find an abandoned men's theatre glove, and encounter one of the servants counting the performance's receipts\u2014this, the girls are informed, is how the school makes its money. Bianca keeps the rose and the glove as a treasure, and fantasizes about the glove's touch, but ultimately casts them both into the water of the lake. Iris and Bianca spend the morning together on what Bianca explains will be her last day at the school. After a formal, tearful goodbye, she passes off her duties to Nadja. Bianca and the other violet ribbons put their ribbons in a box, and accompany Eva and Edith further down the hallway behind the clock than they've ever been before. There, they board a subway train, and leave the school. Eva smokes a cigarette. Back at the house, a new girl emerges from her coffin, to be greeted by Iris, Selma, and the others. The train arrives at a grand, modern plaza, and Eva and Edith leave the girls. Bianca and the other girls immediately begin playing in the fountains nearby. A group of nearby teenage boys lose their ball in the fountain, and one wades in after it. Though he is obscured by the fountain's display, he fascinates Bianca.

He had Bose flown on to Berlin in a special courier aircraft at the beginning of April where he was to receive a more favorable hearing from Joachim von Ribbentrop and the Foreign Ministry officials at the Wilhelmstrasse.\nIn Germany, Bose is attached to the Special Bureau for India under Adam von Trott zu Solz which was responsible for broadcasting on the German-sponsored Azad Hind Radio. Bose initiates the Free India Center in Berlin, and created the Indian Legion (consisting of some 4500 soldiers) out of Indian prisoners of war who had previously fought for the British in North Africa prior to their capture by Axis forces. The Indian Legion is attached to the Wehrmacht, and later transferred to the Waffen SS.\nIts members swore the following allegiance to Hitler and Bose: \"I swear by God this holy oath that I will obey the leader of the German race and state, Adolf Hitler, as the commander of the German armed forces in the fight for India, whose leader is Subhas Chandra Bose\". This oath clearly abrogates control of the Indian legion to the German armed forces whilst stating Bose's overall leadership of India. He was also, however, prepared to envisage an invasion of India via the USSR by Nazi troops, spearheaded by the Azad Hind Legion; many question his judgment here, as it seems unlikely that the Germans could have been easily persuaded to leave after such an invasion, which might also have resulted in an Axis victory in the War.\nIn all, 3,000 Indian prisoners of war sign up for the Free India Legion. But instead of being delighted, Bose was worried. An admirer of Russia, he was devastated when Hitler's tanks rolled across the Soviet border. Matters were worsened by the fact that the now-retreating German army would be in no position to offer him help in driving the British from India. When he meets Hitler in May 1942, his suspicions were confirmed, and he comes to believe that the Nazi leader was more interested in using his men to win propaganda victories than military ones. So, in February 1943, Bose turned his back on his legionnaires and slipped secretly away aboard a submarine bound for Japan. This leaves the men he had recruited leaderless and demoralized in Germany.\nBose lives in Berlin from 1941 until 1943. During his earlier visit to Germany in 1934, he had met Emilie Schenkl, the daughter of an Austrian veterinarian whom he marries in 1937. Their daughter is Anita Bose Pfaff. In 1943, after being disillusioned that Germany could be of any help in gaining India's independence, he leaves for Japan. He travels with the German submarine U-180 around the Cape of Good Hope to the southeast of Madagascar, where he is transferred to the I-29 for the rest of the journey to Imperial Japan, The INA's first commitment was in the Japanese thrust towards Eastern Indian frontiers of Manipur. INA's special forces, the Bahadur Group, are extensively involved in operations behind enemy lines both during the diversionary attacks in Arakan, as well as the Japanese thrust towards Imphal and Kohima, along with the Burmese National Army led by Ba Maw and Aung San.\nHowever, the Japanese Navy remains in essential control of the island's administration. On the Indian mainland, an Indian Tricolor, modeled after that of the Indian National Congress, was raised for the first time in the town in Moirang, in Manipur, in north-eastern India. The towns of Kohima and Imphal were placed under siege by divisions of the Japanese, Burmese National Army and the Gandhi and Nehru Brigades of INA during the attempted invasion of India, also known as Operation U-GO. However, Commonwealth forces held both positions and then counter-attack, in the process inflicting serious losses on the besieging forces, which were then forced to retreat back into Burma.\nWhen the Japanese were defeated at the battles of Kohima and Imphal, the Provisional Government's aim of establishing a base in mainland India was lost forever. The INA was forced to pull back, along with the retreating Japanese army, and fought in key battles against the British Indian Army in its Burma campaign, notable in Meiktilla, Mandalay, Pegu, Nyangyu and Mount Popa. However, with the fall of Rangoon, Bose's government ceases to be an effective political entity. A large proportion of the INA troops surrenders under Lt Col Loganathan. The remaining troops retreated with Bose towards Malaya or made for Thailand. Japan's surrender at the end of the war also leads to the eventual surrender of the Indian National Army, when the troops of the British Indian Army were repatriated to India. On 17 August 1945, Bose leaves from Saigon to Tourane, French Indo-China in the Mitsubishi Ki-21 twin-engine heavy bomber. Subsequently, on 23 August 1945, Reuters announces the death of Bose and General Tsunamasa Shidei of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Japanese-occupied Manchuria.

Jack waits for the arrival of the money in Brooklyn, where he lands among a community who make their living off the Hawkesbury River. Amongst these is eight-generation oyster farmer Brownie and his elderly father Mumbles, who Jack applies to for a job as cover while he waits for the money\u2019s arrival. Jack meets Pearl, a cleaning lady with an inclination for expensive shoes. Brownie frequently argues with Mumbles, who believes his advice on oyster farming to be crucial to Brownie\u2019s business. Brownie\u2019s oysters continually spawn prematurely and lack quality, and have done since the departure of Brownie\u2019s estranged wife Trish.

Trish says it was because Brownie did not let her help with his business and, oddly, refused to buy her a bathtub. Mumbles reveals to Jack that Slug is actually Pearl\u2019s father.

Pearl jokes that her co-worker suspects Jack of robbing the fish markets and mailing the money to himself, which he dismisses adamantly. Jack meets and fishes with Skippy, a Vietnam veteran who warns Jack not to sneak around where he is not wanted. Mumbles believes Slug is dumping wastewater in the river to sabotage Brownie\u2019s harvest and confronts him, but Slug denies the accusation.

The boy wanders through the station to the holding cells, tasting the blood of the local drunk named Harvey. As the boy is restrained, Laura notices that at some point, he covered the faces of several specific people in photographs with his bloodied fingertips.\nUnder pressure and riddled with guilt over the unsolved disappearances, Sheriff Jack Shepherd assumes the bloody boy to be behind it all and sets out into the woods to investigate where he came from. Tracking the boy's bloody footprints, Jack is horrified as the path leads to the same location that he last saw family friend Amy Underhill.\nA year earlier, Amy was abducted and Jack found her chained to a tree in the woods. Believing that the culprit was still nearby, Jack freed Amy and left her for just a moment... only to find her gone when he returned. Making contact with dripping blood, Jack relives this moment and experiences the deaths of each person that went missing at the hands of a hooded individual, with him and the bloody boy both convulsing and puking as a result.\nElsewhere, Vet Darby Owens says goodbye to family friend Helen Reedy. Over a year earlier, Helen\u2019s husband and daughter were killed in an accident during construction of the town dam.

The drug dealer had been killed by Stuart and his former partner to keep him quiet about their dealings, and said partner had recently been killed by a naked man covered in blood. Russell explains that all over the world, the dead are rising up and seeking revenge on those that killed them.

In horror, Jack realizes that the dining room is populated not by people, but the disfigured bodies of the missing victims, including Amy and Darby.\nWhen Helen\u2019s husband and daughter were killed in the Shallow Valley dam accident, she was driven mad and plotted a twisted revenge on those who built the dam. Helen stalked the spouses and children of those involved and one by one, whenever they were alone, would sedate them with an injection and drag them out into the woods. Helen would strip her victims naked and chain them to a tree, slicing parts of their bodies open once they had regained consciousness. Once they were drained of their blood, Helen would stitch her victims closed, dress their bodies, and take them back to her home to further disfigure them in her dining room.\nDistracted by Laura and Albert's sudden arrival, Helen rushes outside and opens fire.

Stas however falls asleep during guard duty and is beaten up by Khokhol, Afanasiy and Kurbashi. The next day, Gioconda is instructed to find matches. He encounters an old Afghan man, who, despite the language barrier, leads him to his village. Fearing an ambush, Gioconda arrives in the village and enters the house of the man. Upon seeing an old man, he starts saying \"haram.\" He is eventually given matches by a kid living there in return for food. As he leaves the village, he encounters members of the company led by Captain Bystrov (Aleksei Kravchenko), who were ready to storm the village.\nA couple days later, a convoy arrives to the base, but is ambushed by the mujahideen, resulting in many casualties and several vehicles destroyed. During the shootout, an injured Ryaba suffers from a mental breakdown and is shot in the head as he yells for the fighting to stop. Captain Bystrov is also killed in action during the fire fight. Meanwhile, Khokhol, Lyutyi, and Vorobey attack the underground positions of the mujahideen, but are forced to return upon learning that their enemies are already in the village. The company then attempts to clear out the village, which appears to be empty. Stas sees a young boy and decides to spare him, but as soon as he turns around he is shot in the back by the boy and dies shortly thereafter. The company is forced to leave as the village is shelled by BM-21 Grad rocket launchers, while the company lament the death of Stas.\nLater, Afanasiy leads some men of the company to steal food cans from a passing army convoy. The soldiers then tell each other their plans for the future after they are discharged from duty in Afghanistan. That night, the company celebrates New Year's Eve by drinking to their fallen comrades while listening to Mikhail Gorbachev's speech on the radio. Pinochet then arrives in the company's base to reunite with his friends: he got into trouble with his unit and was thus reassigned to the 9th company. Welcoming him, the company then celebrate by dancing to some Soviet pop Music.\nThe next morning, while the entire company is asleep, Gioconda goes outside of the base to draw the landscape. While he is drawing, a large group of Mujahideen arrives and he is shot in the head while trying to warn the others of the upcoming assault. Reacting to the surprise attack, 9th Company fires back but are shelled by mortars. As he tries to ask for reinforcements by radio, Patefon is killed by a mortar shell resulting in disruptions in the communication network. The company is able to return to the trenches and engage the mujahideen, Khokhol orders some of the men to shell the enemy positions with mortars but Khokhol's position is hit by a rocket that kills two of his men, preventing further shelling of enemy lines. Soon, the mujahideen break the line and hand-to-hand combat ensues. Another round of shelling begins and a rocket kills Khokhol while Kurbashi is killed by a bullet. Vorobey is hit on his knees while fighting and is unable to make his way to the lines of his comrades, Chugun uses his machine gun to attack the mujahideen in the hopes of covering him but is killed shortly afterwards. Injured and being approached by mujahideen fighters, Vorobey detonates a grenade on himself. This leads Lyutyi to fearlessly charge the approaching mujahideen lines with Samylin's machine gun along with the company. They briefly gain the upper hand and are able to push the fighters back in their positions.\nStranded with low ammunition and no means of communications, the company takes stock of the situation: only seven of them survived, all officers are dead, and they're running low on ammunition. Lyutyi, along with Afanasiy, leads the last men of the company in defense of the hill. They encounter the last fighters and fearlessly fight them till the last man when Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships arrive and kill the remaining Afghan fighters. During the fight, Afanasiy is shot in the chest while the last of the company are killed.\nLyutyi is the only one from the company who remains alive. Speechless and crippled, he tells the Colonel (Andrey Krasko) that the convoy now may pass as the 9th company has fulfilled their duty and mission. The colonel says that there will be no convoy as the Soviets are already withdrawing from Afghanistan and wonders why they haven't heard the orders on the radio. Upon realizing what happened to the 9th Company, the colonel comforts him. Lyutyi passes through the dead bodies of the entire company and removes the talisman from his neck as he kneels to the ground and cries.\nLater on February 15, 1989, a column of BTR-70 is seen leaving Afghanistan. Lyutyi is on one of the vehicles along with other soldiers departing Afghanistan. He narrates that two years later the country they have been fighting for, the Soviet Union, had ceased to exist and that wearing its medals had become unfashionable. He also speaks of the fate of Senior Praporschik Dygalo, who after being reassigned to Tula to train recruits, will die a year later from a stroke on a night march, and of Snow White, who along with her mother with other Russian families, will remain in Fergana Valley, Uzbekistan until disappearing without a trace. He also says that years later the veterans like him in the conflict will be scattered ruthlessly by their new lives.

The Battle of Crete would become the largest German airborne operation of World War II, known as \"Operation Mercury,\" (German: Luftlandeschlacht um Kreta, also Unternehmen Merkur, Greek: \u039c\u03ac\u03c7\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03c1\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2).\nThe Germans had expected to control the island within a few days; after all, in less than seven weeks they had defeated France and occupied Paris for eight days before an armistice was signed. What the Germans had not anticipated was the unrelenting opposition from the men, women, and children of Crete, who would fight alongside British and Dominion forces, ultimately embroiling Nazi Germany in one of its most costly campaigns of the war. Collaborating with a handful of British Special Operations Executive commandos like Patrick Leigh Fermor, William Stanley Moss (both featured in the film) and John Pendlebury, the Cretan resistance would prove to become the most dauntingly potent civilian resistance movement Nazi Germany would encounter throughout the war.

She has to remain there until they are sure that she can resume a normal life. The military attache, Commander Shakti, wants her lobotomized. Jean breaks into another wing of the hospital to find her friends and discovers that one part of the hospital is reserved for mutants, the insane and the lobotomized. She sees a woman having her skull drilled. Jean is then captured by Shakti and given electric shock therapy until she is unconscious. When Jean wakes up, Shakti interrogates her and then sends her to an execution room. Jean lobotomizes the nurse instead and disguises the nurse as herself by covering her with gore. She wanders around the basement, looking for a way out through the vents, until she finds an empty storage room. Jean explores the area, eventually uncovering her things in a box labeled with her name. She also finds her video camera with the tape missing, but still with its memory stick.

Many locals are angry about this, especially Manu Tuiama, a local surfer, and his best friend, Little Jim. A few days before the contest, the demons of the evil Wiki-Tiki spirit attack the village and kidnap Manu's girlfriend, Snookie.

The mother goes to her desk and picks up a binder full of old letters, with a note from someone who claims to be an ancestor. The letters appear written in 19th-century script.\nThe story goes back to the early 19th-century to show the Bell Witch's story. John Bell is taken to church court and found guilty of theft of a woman's land. The church releases him with the verdict that his loss of honor is sufficient punishment. The offended party, Kate Batts, is infamous in the village due to claims of witchcraft.\nStrange events begin to occur and John believes that Batts cursed him. Betsy starts to look very sick and the haunting worsens. Her young teacher, Richard Powell, notices the change in Betsy's behavior. The Bell family tells him they fear that the cause is paranormal. Powell attempts to prove that this is impossible because spirits don't exist. It is implied that Richard is in love with Betsy.\nRichard stays in the Bell home to observe Betsy's behavior. His theory is proven wrong when he witnesses Betsy dangling in the air, as if someone is holding her up by her hair. Betsy is sexually assaulted by the spirit.

Lapham, who plays himself as editor of Harper's Magazine. Lapham opens the film with the question of whether or not America has a \"ruling class,\" a circle of wealthy and powerful families that run the banks, businesses, and government, essentially controlling everything in America.\nTo answer this question, Lapham devises a fictional scenario following the post-graduation paths of two young Yale graduates, themselves from opposite economic beginnings. The paths they take gradually clue them, and the audience, into the reality posed by the question.\nCaton Burwell plays \"Jack Bellami,\" a recent Yale graduate who comes from a rich family. Unlike his family or his friends, Jack seems unsure of what he wants to do with his life and wonders how he could make a difference in the world. Jack ultimately decides to become a banker, working at Goldman Sachs. He chooses the job after coming to the conclusion that the banking industry controls the world and that it would be easier and more effective to become a part of the system in order to change it from within.\nPaul Cantagallo plays \"Mike Vanzetti,\" another recent Yale graduate who is best friends with Jack Bellami. Unlike his friend, Mike is from a middle-class background, meaning he isn't wealthy like his friend Jack. Mike wants to change the world from outside the system. He decides to become a writer and goes headfirst into the character, renting a studio apartment and getting a job as a waiter. He refuses to \"sell out\" by way of writing for a major newspaper or by \"pandering to the masses\" by writing \"lowest-common-denominator\" material.\nMike's story takes center stage in the second half of the film, after Jack's decision to join Goldman and his subsequent success there. A run-in with Mike leads Jack to offer him a job at the company, an offer Mike initially rejects. As his student-loan bills start piling up, however, Mike begins to resent his lack of money and low-paying job, as well as the inability of his writing to enact change. Mike's girlfriend, Taylor, invites him to a wealthy friend's party, at which she encourages him to continue his work. A short time after the party, Lapham invites Mike to take a trip to a \"space that used to be called, in another age of man, Mexico.\" This land was Texas. In Texas, Lapham shows Mike how the powerful control the government, and how money, in the end, trumps any effort by the non-wealthy to alter society.\nUltimately, Mike decides to abandon his writerly dream and takes up Jack's job offer. During a visit to Taylor's mansion home, Mike plays a game of tennis with his girlfriend and they discuss his decision. Taylor is horrified with his new defeatist attitude. Mike lectures his girlfriend on his new worldview: that money is all that matters, and that, as society goes to hell, wealth is one's only defense against the routine abuses and corruption of the ruling class.\nThe film then splits with two endings. The first shows Mike during his first day as a banker, zooming in on him at an initiation program: His panic and displeasure are evident as he immediately regrets what he has done.\nThe second ending (which an on-screen graphic claims was filmed after test audiences reacted poorly to the first ending) has Mike sidetracked when he agrees to watch a stage show. It is being rehearsed by the lead singer of \"THE WHATS?\" and a group of children. The song they play discusses the themes of the film.

Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed vigilante who murders corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers in it and kills them using punishments described in one of the ancient Hindu scriptures Garuda Puranam. \nAmbi is secretly in love with his neighbour Nandini, a medical student and an aspiring Carnatic singer, but never expresses his feelings due to fear of rejection. When he does get the courage to do so during the annual Tyagaraja Aradhana with the help of his friend, Sub-inspector Chari, she rejects him as she cannot bear his overbearing nature and constant complaining and nitpicking. Distraught, Ambi attempts suicide, almost drowning himself before having second thoughts. Subsequently, he develops another personality named Remo, a metrosexual fashion model.

Ta's mother died when he was young, and his father remarried Ta's teacher, Miss Panor. Kim was his girlfriend (but is now dating Por, who is a nerd). The tomboyish Tair and stylish Noot might be lovers (though this is never made clear), and Ko is their fun-loving friend.\nDuring their last year at school, Miss Panor seduces Por (though this is not known to his friends). Por subsequently discovers he's not the only one in her bed. In addition to being married to Ta's father, Miss Panor is also having an affair with the sports coach. Fuelled by jealousy, Por suggests filming Panor and the coach to 'prove her infidelity' to Ta's father. The friends, save for Kim, do so, and broadcast it to the entire school. The coach soon discovers it was them and holds the group at gunpoint while he sexually abuses them.\nSeeking revenge, the students approach a shaman who agrees to curse the coach. A few days later, Por goes back to the shaman and asks him to curse Miss Panor, too. The coach dies in which numerous fish hooks appear from his body while his family\u2019s healer attempted to heal the wounds he received during his catfish fishing trip. Miss Panor, who is embarrassed at her sexual exploits being revealed, is found stabbing herself repeatedly in the legs. She subsequently becomes a recluse, returning home to her cottage on the river, away from the city.\nIn the present, the six friends gather together after Ta's father commits suicide in order to head to the remote village and pay their respects to Miss Panor. Upon arrival at Panor's cottage on the river, Noot's cell phone rings; her uncle wants her to return because her father is in the hospital, so she makes her goodbyes and heads back to the city. Miss Panor is a polite hostess (if a little distant), and Ta's great-grandmother seems harmless enough, though he warns everyone that she is a bit senile. As the group stays at the cottage, Kim experiences some strange occurrences around it such as, the door moving on its own, a white figure appearing underwater, and witnessing Ta's great-grandmother devouring a cat.\nMiss Panor retires to a secret hut in the jungle, where she has several corpses gathered round, all of them sitting at desks, like students. Each corpse has a photo attached to it, indicating which former student it represents.\nAt dinner that night, as the friends eat the soup Panor has made for them, each student spits out something: Ko spits up a fingernail, Por spits up a piece of tongue with a piercing on it, Kim spits up an eye contact lens and Tair an eyeball. The group realizes that the meat, which is actually dismembered body parts added in the soup is, in fact, Noot. They search the cottage for Miss Panor. Kim finds a video camera with a tape that shows Miss Panor killing and cannibalizing the shaman who cursed her, and then rushing towards the camera with a tree branch raised and bringing it down on whoever is holding the camera.\nTair begins to have hallucinations of corpses shambling around everywhere. The group flees the house and sees a light outside. They call to the boat for help, but it drives past them. The driver takes a fatal fall from the boat after seeing Miss Panor coming towards him from the other side, which sinks. Kim tumbles into the water and has a vision of Panor and Ta's father. In the vision, Panor is shown torturing Ta's father by ripping off his toenails, on the premise that if she hobbles him, he can't leave her. When Panor leaves the room, Ta's father shoots himself in the head. Kim relates this to the others, and they find the gun. In the same room, there are also some jars filled with pickled mangoes. In one of these jars, the group finds Ta's dead father.\nThe group runs to the house's dusty old shrine to hide and pray. Tair has a laughing fit and is temporarily possessed by Miss Panor. Ko threatens Tair with the gun, but suddenly starts to writhe and flail as dozens of geckos claw their way out of his body, killing him.\nThe youths now decide to split up: Por and Ta go off into the jungle to find Panor, leaving Kim and Tair sitting outside the shrine, with Tair (now free of possession) still seeing visions of corpses. She panics and runs off, and Kim follows into the dense jungle. The boys hear Kim fall down. They run to find her, but are separated. Ta finds Kim and wrenches a piece of metal from her leg. Alone, Por has creepy visions of Panor. Ta leaves Kim to look for Por. Tair bursts from the jungle, cowering away from her visions. After seeing Kim as a walking corpse and in hysterics, Tair rips out her own eyes.\nPor finds Kim, who appears to him as Miss Panor, taunting him about their love affair. Firing the gun at Kim, but Ta rescues her just in time. Por runs off into the jungle and discovers Panor chanting in her secret hut. Por flees, but a vision of Panor appears before him, hamstrings him, and starts pulling out his teeth; Por crawls away and confesses that he had a love spell placed on Panor causing her to seduce him, became jealous when he found out she was also sleeping with the coach and took part in filming them and then placing a pain-inducing curse on Panor as punishment. Suddenly, his vision clears and he sees Kim and Ta. Kim is repulsed by Por's confession; she and Ta leave Por in the jungle.\nMiss Panor arrives, ties up Por, and takes him to her secret hut. She stabs him in the neck with a syringe full of a paralytic agent, then pours boiling water down his throat and slowly burns every inch of his skin with a blowtorch.\nIn the jungle, Ta is carrying Kim on his back. She begs him to continue without her, but he refuses. The two of them come across a small shrine, on which is hanging Noot's bag. Her cell phone rings: it's her uncle, wondering where she is.\nIn the secret jungle hut, Miss Panor is performing CPR on fatally burned Por in order to inflict more torture on him. Meanwhile, police officers converge outside the hut. As Miss Panor starts to use a power drill on Por's head, the officers break in and shoot her.\nKim is rushed to a hospital. She recovers, and Ta comes to visit her. As they chat, the TV in Kim's room broadcasts a news show, which reports that the five students who visited Miss Panor are dead. Also discovered in the secret hut was Ta's charred corpse.\nIn horror, Kim turns to see that Ta is actually a badly burned, walking corpse. He never went with them to visit Miss Panor; he was already dead by then. As he pets Kim's hand, Ta explains: the video of Panor eating the shaman was taken by Ta's father, who had threatened divorce after witnessing the tape of her and the coach. For this, Panor tortured him and he killed himself. Panor locked Ta's great-grandmother in a closet and left her to starve. It was Ta's great-grandmother who had told Panor that in order to break the spells placed on her she had to kill the shaman that was paid to perform them and eat his flesh. She also warned Panor that it could drive her insane (it does). It also becomes clear that the coach had also placed a love spell on Panor to instigate their affair just like Por did. Miss Panor was the victim of all these spells. Her attempt to free herself and seek revenge led her into insanity. She tortured Ta in all the ways that will be experienced by his friends. Ta's vengeful spirit had lured the group there so they could feel the pain that he went through. He only saved Kim from being killed because he still loves her.\nA flashback of their days in school returned. Kim and a classmate had a crush on Ta. Kim makes a bet with her classmate that if Ta doesn't court Kim within a week, she will \"offer\" Ta to her.

Sadhu confirms that Malli only plans the escape, and that Nandu is the one Prasad is looking for, leaving Prasad to realize that Nandu is masquerading as Pardhu.

She describes the preacher as a turtle, always sticking his head into his shell, and never wanting to come out into the real world. This is most likely because of how sad he is about her mother, whom he is still in love with.\nOne of the people Opal meets is Miss Franny Block, a kind and somewhat eccentric elder librarian, who tells her many great stories, including one involving a bear who invaded the library. She also meets Gloria Dump, a blind African-American recovering alcoholic with a \"mistake tree\" with beer bottles hanging from it in her backyard.

A Religious Studies professor at UC Berkeley, Saul wrote his graduate thesis on the Kabbalah.  Because he was a devout Jew, his wife Miriam converted to Judaism when they married, and he nurtured his son Aaron as a traditional studious Jew like himself.  When daughter Eliza wins her class spelling bee, they embark on a course of Kabbalah study to help her win.  The film follows the family and the spiritual quests upon which they journey, in large part because of Saul: Miriam's attempt to make herself whole, Aaron's religious uncertainty, and Eliza's desire to be closer to her father.\nMiriam lives a secret life throughout her entire marriage to Saul, trying to fulfill the religious idea she learned from him, tikkun olam, or \"repairing the world\" and \"reuniting its shards.\" In momentary flashbacks by Miriam, we glimpse a scene of a crashed car with shattered glass, apparently the basis of an underlying hurt she has been suffering since childhood, perhaps the death of her parents. The beautiful life she had before the accident, symbolized by the kaleidoscope she always carried as a child, through which she was presented with its beautiful view of the world, is suddenly shattered when the accident occurred. Thereafter, seeking to restore the broken shards, Miriam compulsively creates beautiful light gathering objects (sometimes stealing them) and storing them in a secret warehouse.\nSaul's son, Aaron, grows unsure of the Judaism foisted on him by his father, and in trying to find a faith he personally believes in, he becomes a Hare Krishna after meeting a woman named Chali in the park. For Eliza, her experience begins with a desire to be as close to her father as Aaron is; the two would often have discussions about Judaism and play music together.  Saul's graduate thesis on Kabbalah writer Abraham Abulafia (who believed that careful analysis of words could lead to contact with God) brings Saul and Eliza closer together when Saul learns Eliza has won the district spelling bee.\nUpon learning of her success, Saul takes control of Eliza's life, coaching her in the Kabbalistic teachings he knows so well. Eliza enjoys the renewed attention of her father and pursues the competition for her father's involvement.  This comes at the expense of Aaron, who receives less time with Saul, even as he falls deeper into  religious questioning. At the center of the film, Eliza becomes Saul's newest religious project. Eliza continues to do well at spelling bees, utilizing her spiritual gift, as Abraham Abulafia described: visions appear to her and help her spell words no matter how difficult.\nSaul's obsession with his daughter's gift and the opportunities it presents to him consume him to the point that he is callously ignorant of the collapse of his family around him \u2014 his son's interest in Hinduism, which soon comes between him and his father, and his wife's psychological problems suddenly thrust upon him \u2014 it seems that the entire family is now \"broken,\" like a microcosm of the world; but can it be fixed, can the broken shards be restored?

Her body convulsing epileptically on the floor, Eliza apparently makes that mystical connection, providing her the healing power of God. In the final scene, Eliza, on the verge of winning the national spelling bee, and now empowered with the ability to heal her family, deliberately misspells the word origami, thereby losing the competition.

In the days leading to the competition, Brice makes new friends thanks to his party animal skills, and clashes with the local champion, Igor. Marius meanwhile, who has stolen a surf board for Brice to compete with, is caught by the behatted saleswoman, Jeanne, who blackmails him into working on her boat.

In a vision, the Bodhi character from Point Break tells him that \"dreaming your life is not the same as living your dream\".

After Jake leaves, Martha asks Rose if he is the father of her child, and Rose angrily tells her to mind her own business.\nThe next morning the police arrive at Rose's house after neighbors hear her child crying and call them. They find Rose dead of apparent strangulation, with no sign of forced entry. A detective questions both Jake and Kyle, who each claim to know nothing about the murder. Meanwhile, Martha pawns jewelry (which she says she inherited from family members) and spends the money on fishing equipment and a trip to the beauty parlor. She then takes the fishing equipment to Kyle's house and gives it to him as a gift; he tells her of Rose's murder and, apparently surprised by the news, she says she knows nothing. She is later questioned by a detective and maintains her innocence, even when he tells her that the fingerprints found on Rose's neck match her own. Martha is arrested for Rose's murder.\nKyle visits Martha in prison. Martha pleads with Kyle to help her, swearing she did not murder Rose and doesn't know what happened, though she mentions a headache and Rose's rudeness. Kyle is skeptical of her story. Later, in her jail cell, Martha sees a bright light, followed by a vision of Rose's dead body and herself standing over Rose.

She brings the dog home and names it \"Zochor\" (Spot). Her father is worried, knowing that wolves live in caves and may follow its scent and kill their livestock.\nThe father departs for town on his motorbike, to sell the pelts of the sheep killed by wolves.  He instructs his wife to get rid of the dog before he is home. Nansal is sent out to graze the herd, but she is distracted and gets lost. The mother is distraught when the herd comes back without Nansal and goes out looking for her.\nMeanwhile, Nansal finds refuge in the yurt of an elderly woman. The old lady feeds Nansal and gives her shelter while a storm passes. It is here that Nansal hears the story of the Cave of the Yellow Dog. In this story, a yellow dog is trapped in a cave with no exit by a man to cure his daughter's illness.\nThe mother finds Nansal soon after and takes her home. Zochor is still with the family when the father returns home. He is upset but still gives gifts to his wife and children nonetheless, including a plastic ladle and a flashlight (torch). The father tries to sell Zochor to some wolf hunters, but Nansal tells them she found him in a cave and the deal falls through.\nIt is time for the family to move on. They pack up all of their belongings and the yurt and load them onto carts to be pulled by their cattle. The three children are put onto the wagons, with Nansal watching her younger brother. Zochor is tied to a stake so he cannot follow them. Nansal is distracted by Zochor and does not watch her brother. Her brother escapes.\nThe family travels several miles until they realize that their son is not with them. The father turns back immediately and rushes back on his horse. Meanwhile, their son is stumbling slowly towards a flock of vultures. He ventures near a stream, while moving further and further from Zochor. When the son is right next to the flock, Zochor breaks free and scares them away.  This is witnessed by the father who, in gratitude for protecting his son from harm, accepts Zochor into the family.\nIn the final scene, the family's wagons travel down the road, with Zochor in the wagon with Nansal and a truck driving down the road blaring reminders to vote in the upcoming elections.", "tmdb_plot": "The little nomad girl, Nansal, finds a baby dog in the Mongolian veld, who becomes her best friend - against all rejections of her parents.

On her way home, Mi-ju hallucinates seeing a student tell her that because of her, her own music is for nothing, and promises revenge. Shaken, Mi-ju drives home and nearly avoids getting into an accident with a truck. At home, she receives a disturbing message on her cell phone.\nMi-ju's eldest daughter, the autistic Yoon-jin, as well as her husband Jun-ki, her sister-in-law Kyeong-ran, and her youngest daughter Yoon-hye throw Mi-ju a birthday party on her birthday, but even this is not bereft of the oddities that have been plaguing her recently; everyone but Yoon-jin  appears mute and emotionless. Yoon-jin sings \"Happy Birthday\" to Mi-ju and Kyeong-ran gives her an album as a present. The next day, Mi-ju buys a cello for Yoon-jin after Yoon-jin looks at one longingly. Yoon-hye asks Yoon-jin if she can try the cello, but the normally calm Yoon-jin bites her little sister.\nAs Mi-ju watches the sleeping Yoon-jin to ensure she does not get up and hurt her sister again, her face suddenly becomes ghastly. Kyeong-ran is quietly murdered by what seems to be a ghost, but nobody in the family notices or hears. Yoon-jin gets out of bed and sees Kyeong-ran's body strangled and dangling at her window. Mi-ju, meanwhile, tells Jun-ki the true story of her friend Tae-yeon's death: Kim Tae-yeon was a plain girl who struggled to play the cello as good as her friend Mi-ju, and eventually became very jealous of her, but pretended to be happy for Mi-ju as she became known for being very talented and neglected Tae-yeon. The two were in a car accident and Tae-yeon was killed while Mi-ju was simply injured.\nMi-ju later sees Yoon-jin causing Yoon-hye to fall to her death from the balcony. Mi-ju is afraid of Yoon-jin getting in trouble for her crime, and after ensuring Yoon-jin does not hurt anyone else, she hides Yoon-hye's body in the basement and lies to Jun-ki that Yoon-hye went to camp. Jun-ki discovers the body and accuses Mi-ju of killing their daughter. In the ensuing struggle, Mi-ju pushes her husband, only to find he has been stabbed by a sharp pipe and is dead. She then sees a ghost behind him that has killed him and whispers Tae-yeon's name.\nA flashback reveals that Mi-ju's truthful variation of the story was not even true. In fact, the student Mi-ju saw at the beginning was not a hallucination but the ghost of Tae-yeon, and in fact Tae-yeon was actually the more talented cello player, and it was really Mi-ju who became jealous of her and pretended to be happy for her. After Tae-yeon publicly being chosen over her, Mi-ju purposely swerves while driving them home and crashes the car, harming them both, but also causing Tae-yeon to fall towards a cliff, barely hanging on. Mi-ju grabs her hand and tauntingly acts as if she is going to help her friend, but ultimately lets Tae-yeon fall to her death.\nIn the present, Mi-ju tries to stab Tae-yeon's ghost to stop her from going to Yoon-jin.

Senthil's mother Kasthuri wanted Senthil to marry Priya, the daughter of his father's cousin Kandaswamy, to reunite the two branches of the family after 30 years of separation because Senthil's father chose to marry Kasthuri instead of Kandaswamy's sister, Akhilandeshwari, who is also his cousin. Saravanan learns that Senthil had bought the Vettaiyapuram mansion, despite attempts by the local village elders to dissuade them, and moves in with them. Akhilandeshwari is jealous of Saravanan and plots to kill him with the help of her assistant Oomaiyan.\nWhen the family visits their ancestral temple, the chief priest reveals the reason everyone fears the mansion. Around 150 years ago, a king named Vettaiyan travelled to Vizianagaram in Andhra Pradesh, where he met and fell in love with a dancer named Chandramukhi. However, she did not reciprocate his feelings as she was already in love with another dancer named Gunasekaran. As a result, Vettaiyan took her back to his palace by force. Unknown to him, Chandramukhi made Gunasekaran stay in a house opposite and met him secretly. When Vettaiyan discovered this, he beheaded Gunasekaran on Durgashtami and burnt Chandramukhi alive. As a result, Chandramukhi's ghost tried to take revenge on Vettaiyan, who with the help of various priests and sorcerers from all over the country, tamed the ghost by locking it in an urn, which is kept at the shelf up in a room located in the palace's south-west corner which is guarded by a king cobra. Vettaiyan too died after a few days. Priya is in love with Vishwanathan, a dance professor who reciprocates her feelings. Their love is supported by Saravanan, who requests Kandaswamy to arrange their marriage.\nAfter hearing Chandramukhi's story, Ganga, who thinks that the story was fabricated to keep thieves from stealing treasures in the room, wishes to go there. Saravanan receives an email to attend a patient and assures Senthil to call him if anything happens before leaving. Ganga gets the duplicate room key from the gardener's granddaughter Durga and opens the door to the room. Subsequently, strange things begin to happen in the household: a ghost frightens the people in the house, things inexplicably break, and Ganga's sari catches fire. Suspicion turns towards Durga. Senthil immediately calls Saravanan to solve the case. As soon as Saravanan returns, a mysterious being tries to kill Priya. Saravanan also investigates other incidents such as the attempts to kill Senthil are made with poisoning his coffee and by pushing a glass fish tank to fall on his head. Also another mysterious happening is the sound of someone singing and dancing coming from Chandramukhi's room during the night.\nGanga mysteriously disappears during Priya and Viswanathan's engagement. Saravanan notices her absence and searches for her, but is attacked by Oomaiyan\u2014who has been sent by Akhilandeshwari. Saravanan subdues Oomaiyan and with Senthil's help finds Ganga, who is supposedly being sexually harassed by Viswanathan. Saravanan reveals to Senthil and Viswanathan that Ganga suffers from split personality disorder, following the death of her parents. He also reveals that she heard stories from her grandmother, which worsened her disorder. Ganga's mischievous behaviour made her enter into Chandramukhi's room and Chandramukhi possessed her after the urn fell down and broke while she was cleaning the room. Saravanan tells them that Ganga who turned into Chandramukhi tried to kill Priya and Senthil, as they are the only obstacles and that the former was Viswanathan's fiancee and the latter was Ganga's husband. She framed Viswanathan for sexual harassment, as she thinks that Viswanathan is her lover Gunasekaran since he stays at the same place Gunasekaran did. By framing Vishwanathan and also framing Durga via possession, Chandramukhi planned to stop the engagement. The only way to stop Chandramukhi is to make her believe she killed Vettaiyan on Durgashtami since Saravanan impersonated Vettaiyan and disrupted one of the pujas conducted by the exorcist Ramachandra Acharya by conversing with Chandramukhi to know its wish. Before carrying out his plan, Saravanan asks Senthil to trigger Ganga to see for himself whether she turns into Chandramukhi or not. When Senthil does so, she turns into Chandramukhi, which shocks him. A worried Senthil shouts at Ganga, turning her back to normal.\nAkhilandeshwari overhears Saravanan's idea of self-sacrifice and apologises to him. On Durgashtami, in the dance hall, the family and Ramachandra Acharya allow Chandramukhi to burn Saravanan alive. Ramachandra Acharya then blows smoke and ash on Ganga's face when she is given a torch to burn Saravanan. Senthil then opens a trapdoor to let Saravanan escape, and an effigy of Vettaiyan gets burnt instead. Convinced that Vettaiyan is dead, Chandramukhi leaves Ganga's body, curing her.

After a fellow police officer, Callo, testifies against them, Conners is suspended, and York is fired. In reality, York tried to shoot Curtis, but accidentally killed the hostage. Curtis in turn fired back, and Conners killed him in self-defense.\nSome time later, Lorenz and four other criminals take hostages in a bank. Lorenz has only one demand, to negotiate with Conners. Conners is reinstated but put under the surveillance of a new partner, the recently-graduated Shane Dekker. Conners is given control of the negotiations, and after a bank teller is shot, he orders a SWAT unit to cut the building's power and go in. During an explosion, the criminals flee during the ensuing panic and chaos.\nDekker and Conners learn more about each other at a local diner, slowly building a friendship, but Dekker disapproves of Conners' \"cowboy cop\" methods. Dekker explains that during negotiations, Lorenz was making many cryptic references to chaos theory. As they leave to examine new evidence, Conners puts a ten dollar bill on the table for his share of the bill. Dekker swaps the ten for a twenty of his own. A TV camera caught a shot of one of the criminals, who is arrested together with his girlfriend at her home, where banknotes are found with a scent used to mark evidence collected by the police. The banknote serial numbers did not come from that day's robbery, but had been placed in police storage and signed out two weeks earlier by Callo. He is found shot dead in his home, together with incriminating evidence linking him to the heist.\nWhen reviewing video footage from the bank, Dekker notices one corner of the bank is deliberately shielded from view. In that corner, they find the bank regional manager's computer. Fingerprints on the keyboard reveal the identity of a hacker that Conners himself had arrested, but whose conviction was overturned after the shooting on the bridge. Conners and Dekker want to question the hacker, but he is shot dead by Lorenz, and a gunfight ensues, during which Lorenz manages to escape. Dekker questions the hospitalized bank robber identified in the news footage and finally breaks him when he casually explains the impact of a massive overdose of morphine while slowly injecting something into the suspect's drip. An amazed Conners watches and later calls him a hypocrite. Dekker responds by explaining he only injected more saline solution.\nThe suspect reveals Lorenz is Scott Curtis, the brother of John shot earlier, and Conners leads a stakeout at an address where all the gang are to meet that night; Scott's house. Forced to go before Scott arrives, a shootout results in both suspects' deaths, and a bomb blows up the building while Conners is inside. Dekker is devastated but realizes that Callo's signature requesting material from the evidence storage was forged by the evidence custody officer, who reveals that Scott is actually York. In a flashback, York stands on the bridge and fires the first shot, killing the hostage in the opening sequence. Tracking Lorenz/York's mobile phone, Dekker surprises York at a diner, and York takes a woman hostage in a reversal of the standoff on the bridge. Dekker chases and eventually kills York.\nWhen Dekker pays for his coffee at the diner, he discovers the banknote Conners used to pay for lunch with is also scented, which means Conners was also involved in taking the money from police evidence. Dekker finds a copy of James Gleick's Chaos: Making a New Science in Conners' house, showing he had faked an earlier ignorance of the mathematics.

Constantine tells Angela that he committed suicide as a teenager because he was traumatized by seeing supernatural creatures and, though he was revived, when he dies he is condemned to Hell.\nAt the morgue, Constantine's friend Father Hennesy discovers a symbol on Isabel's wrist but is killed by the half-breed demon Balthazar. Constantine and Angela discover Hennesy carved the symbol into his hand for them to find. Angela also finds a clue hidden in Isabel's hospital room concerning a chapter of Hell's bible. Before being killed by Balthazar, Constantine's ally Beeman tells the pair the symbol represents the antichrist Mammon, Lucifer's son, and the chapter prophesies him usurping his father and conquering the Earth, using a powerful psychic and divine assistance; the psychic, Isabel, killed herself to stop Mammon. Angela reveals she possessed powers like Isabel's but repressed them to avoid being deemed insane like her sister. Constantine helps Angela reawaken her powers by inducing a near-death experience, and she uses them to find Balthazar.\nConstantine interrogates Balthazar and learns that the blood of Christ on the spear tip is Mammon's divine assistance, and Angela has been chosen as his new host. An unseen entity destroys Balthazar and abducts Angela who becomes possessed by Mammon. With the help of witch doctor Papa Midnite, Constantine induces visions to locate Angela at the psychiatric hospital. Alongside his driver and apprentice, Chas Kramer, Constantine arms himself and assaults the building, battling through hordes of demons to Angela. Constantine and Chas seemingly exorcise Mammon from her, but Chas is killed by the unseen force, revealed to be Gabriel. Resentful at God's favoritism for humanity and forgiveness for even the most wicked, Gabriel intends to unleash Hell on Earth so that those who survive will become truly \"worthy\" of His love. Gabriel tosses Constantine away and prepares to pierce Angela with the spear tip to unleash Mammon.\nDesperate, Constantine commits suicide by slitting his wrists, knowing that Lucifer will personally come to collect him. Time pauses and Constantine convinces Lucifer to intervene and stop Mammon. Gabriel ineffectually attempts to smite Lucifer, revealing God has abandoned them, and Lucifer burns away Gabriel's wings before banishing Mammon to Hell. Lucifer offers to restore Constantine to life for his assistance, but he instead asks that Isabel be sent to Heaven. Lucifer releases Isabel, but Constantine begins ascending to Heaven for his selfless sacrifice. Infuriated, Lucifer restores Constantine to life and removes his cancer, believing that, in time, he will prove he belongs in Hell.

Cecilia sneaks to the roof and finds a Hello Kitty backpack near the building's water tower; the manager, Cory Murray, explains that no one has claimed it. Cecilia initially dislikes the apartment but decides she wants to live there. Dahlia makes an offer the same day.\nShortly after they move in, the bedroom ceiling begins to leak dark water. Dahlia finds the apartment above flooded from every faucet. She finds a family portrait of the former tenants, the Rimsky family: a mother, father, and a girl who is Cecilia's age. Dahlia complains to Murray and the superintendent Veeck about the water, but Veeck insists that he is not a plumber and blames teenage vandals. The ceiling, shoddily patched by Veeck, leaks again. Dahlia is intimidated by teenagers in the apartment, and sees the face of a screaming girl in a washing machine. This isn't helped by a recurring nightmare she has, seeing the girl's mother warning her not to tell the police what she's done to her own daughter or else she will harm Cecilia.\nCecilia's teacher is troubled by Cecilia's \"imaginary friend\" named Natasha.

Dahlia feels some form of relief knowing that Kyle will keep her safe.\nThat night, Dahlia follows footsteps to the roof and sees that water is spilling from the water tower. Inside she finds Natasha's body and calls the police, horrified. Veeck is arrested for negligence as he was aware of her body. This was why he refused to fix the complex's plumbing problems, and he is taken away. Veeck kept claiming that Natasha's parents paid him money to keep quiet about their willful abandonment of their daughter and lie for them that she was with either of them. Dahlia and Platzer discover that Natasha's parents had cruelly abandoned her. In turn, they also conclude that Natasha was left to fend for herself. She fell into the water tower and drowned, leaving her as a vengeful ghost who is jealous of Cecilia because she has Dahlia as her mother.\nDahlia agrees to move closer to Kyle so that shared custody will be easier. As she packs, a girl in a hooded bathrobe who resembles Cecilia asks her to read to her. When Dahlia hears Cecilia playing in the bathtub, she realizes that the girl is Natasha. Natasha begs Dahlia not to leave but Dahlia rushes into the bathroom to save Cecilia. Natasha locks Cecilia in the shower compartment and holds her underwater.

Ebrill is the long-dead daughter of a local shepherd who also served as the town's pastor fifty years prior.  When Ebrill, who was a sickly child, died, her father gave her to the ocean, sending her to Annwyn.  He then convinced his followers to throw themselves into the ocean, claiming that it was the way to Paradise, while he privately hoped that their sacrifice would return Ebrill to him from Annwyn.  Ebrill did come back, but, something came back with her.  Her father tried to draw the evil out of her, through trepanning and locking her in her room.  Dafydd was one of the followers who did not throw himself off the cliff, though both his parents did.

The professor says: \"Start-up capital is how everything begins - it makes it possible to start a business and multiply the initial investment many times over. The key question is how to get start-up capital...\" By way of example, she begins to tell a story that supposedly took place a decade earlier during the socio-economic tumult in the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nThe movie flashes to Nizhniy Novgorod in the mid-1990s, to an interrogation scene that takes place in a morgue. The torturer continuously asks the gagged prisoner to talk, but it is unclear what the torturer desires to know. Before the torturer can start the interrogation, three masked men enter and threaten the torturer at gunpoint. A gunfight ensues and one of the masked men is killed as well as the prisoner and the torturer has been shot in the stomach. One of the masked men takes of his disguise and it is revealed that he is a police officer named Stepan. The following events make it clear that he is a crooked officer. He asks the torturer what information someone called \"Mikhailovich\" wanted from the prisoner and when the torturer gives him a finger, Stepan shoots the man in the head and then shoots his own partner. The officer takes a piece of paper from the torturers pocket and seems excited by what he reads on it.\nThe movie then introduces the audience to three new gangsters. Standing around and smoking cigarettes, the trio discusses their current lack of \"jobs\" due to one of them, Bala, being unprofessional and turning the \"operation\" into a bloodbath with 5 murders, thus throwing a shadow over their group. The two Russian looking men in this group, its leader Koron and one of his henchmen, Bala, consistently make their black partner, Baklazhan (\"Eggplant\"), the butt of their jokes\u2014even though he was born in Russia, the other two seemingly refuse to accept he is a Russian and insist on calling him the Ethiopian. The trio get a phone call from the crooked cop, Stepan, who offers them a \"job\". They decide to meet at the zoo tomorrow to discuss the details.\nThe movie jumps to the protagonists, Semen (nicknaming himself \"Simon\") and Sergei, who are two young hoodlums working for Sergei Mikhailovich, a local mob boss. Throughout the entire film, Sergei is seen carrying around a leather folder, which he seemingly instinctively holds before him in moments of danger when he can't use his gun. Sergei Mikhailovich wears a magenta sports coat and uses a cell phone with an extendable antenna, a symbol of prosperity at that time. Upon learning that a chemist nicknamed \"Doctor\" has established a makeshift drug lab in the neighborhood, Sergei Mikhailovich sends Simon and Sergei to persuade Doctor to start paying him protection money. Sergei appears to be the smarter of the two hoods, doing all the talking. Simon is more taciturn: a ruthless killer with spring-loaded guns hidden in the wide sleeves of his trench coat. After Sergei explains why they are there, Doctor scoffs at them and before they can do anything, two of Doctor's associates appear. In the ensuing shoot-out, Sergei and Simon kill both the Doctor and his associates, but decide to take the fresh-made drugs in a box with them to soften Mikhailovich's fury on failing their task.\nSergei's plan works: although furious, Mikhailovich decides to give the duo another chance to make good. He tells Sergei and Simon to drive to the house of an attorney and exchange a suitcase full of money for a suitcase full of heroin. The two drive to a bar restaurant to relax and discuss the job. Unknown to the duo, a crooked cop named Stepan who learnt about this deal from the first scene. He hires Koron and his two associates, Bala and Baklazhan to intercept Sergei and Simon, promising them part of the money in the suitcase. The gangsters, wearing masks, hold up Sergei and Simon after the exchange took place and take the suitcase from them at gunpoint (strictly following Stepan's instructions and thinking that the suitcase is full of money).\nSergei suspects their fate is grim, especially when he learns Mikhailovich burned his hired architect in the new-built faulty fireplace earlier this day, but instead Sergei Mikhailovich, learning of the state of affairs and quickly rooting out the rat while they were on the way, orders them to find Stepan, discover where the drugs were taken, and then kill him. The duo drive to Stepan's apartment, meet him at the way home, come with him to his apartment, bind him, and begin to brutally torture him. Before long, Stepan tells them where to find the three gangsters who held them up. After that, Simon kills Stepan.\nUsing the information extracted from Stepan, Sergei and Simon drive to Koron's apartment, but find that Baklazhan is the only person there. Koron had left earlier to try to find Stepan and clear things about suitcase contents, while Bala stepped out to buy some cigarettes. Sergei and Simon overpower and tie up Baklazhan. He swears that he has no idea who they are or what they are talking about. Sergei begins to search the apartment for the heroin, while Simon loads up vinyl record he found into a player. Sergei finds a bag filled with guns (also, a portable missile launcher and some grenades, bought by Baklazhan as per Koron's order to \"get some silenced guns and something heavier\", meaning an assault rifle) and three robber's masks in the closet. Still, Baklazhan denies everything even under torture with broken limb and clearly in constant pain. A neighbor bothered by the loud music comes calling and attempts to threaten Simon, ending being locked in a tight closed and receiving two bullets.\nSoon, a group of gangsters led by a criminal named Mozg (The Brain) show up at the apartment. They were a second group that Stepan hired to deal with the Koron's trio and get him the suitcase for free (since Mozg's payment was information about Koron's location and a chance for a payback for something in their past). The duo shoots them, wounding Mozg and killing the rest. Mozg, tied up for interrogation, begins to threaten them and Sergei kills him with a sudden shot to the temple. Soon after, Koron and Bala return to the apartment. Sergei and Simon tie them up and, under the smallest pressure with a threat of torture and a promise of a \"chance\", Koron gives up the location of the heroin suitcase, hidden in the oven. Baklazhan raises his eyes upwards in disapproval and despair.\nThen comes the \"chance\" Sergei promised: a round of Russian Roulette for each of the trio, which he calls \"Zhmurki\" (\"blind man's buff\"\u2014thus, the title of the film), motivating naming of the game with a wordplay on \"Zhmur\", a dead person (this word itself originates from the verb \"Zazhmurit'sa\", \"shut the eyes\", which in crime jargon stands for \"going stiff\"). He \"demonstrates\" the game principle by loading a bullet and then pulling the trigger while aiming at each of his prisoner's legs, which ends in Baklazhan getting the bullet to a hip. One by one they are led to the kitchen to play. Koron ends up killing himself after asking the duo to just let him go. Bala goes into a verbal rage, accusing Sergei of cowardice and demanding he plays, too. Sergei agrees, but he puts his folder between his temple and the gun and quickly pressing the trigger. After that Bala, clearly in fear, pushes the trigger on himself, resulting in another shot. Then Simon asks to \"just kill the negr\" (note that \"negr\" in Russian culture isn't same as \"nigger\" and doesn't carry any negative tone to it) because \"he doesn't like them\" and Sergei approves. Meanwhile, Baklazhan, despite his multiple wounds, has freed himself from the ropes and has gotten a hold of a gun. Since he can't move, he holds an ambush position at the table he was tortured next to and shoots Sergei as the duo returns from the kitchen, wounding him in the stomach. Simon quickly reacts and kills Baklazhan.\nThe following series of events is an excellent example of black humor within this film. As Sergei lays bleeding on the couch approaching death and lamenting it was the only time he forgot his folder, Simon is lazily and slowly searching through his phonebook and eventually calls a friend who is a medical student (since they can't go to a hospital with a gunshot wound and several pounds of heroin). The friend, clad in punk attire and a colored mohawk, comes over and, after spending an ample amount of time chatting with Simon, takes a hit of cocaine, and pulls out a medical textbook. As his operation begins, it is clear that he has never done this sort of procedure before as he is forced to use the textbook as a guide. While his friend is operating, Simon opens Sergei's leather folder and discovers a thick metal plate inside. When Sergei gets some air and attempts to sit, Simon suggests they move out, \"because who knows who'll come next and he's almost out of bullets\".\nAfter the bloodbath at Koron's apartment, Sergei and Simon decide that they could do much better for themselves in Moscow and there was little upside to continuing to work for Sergei Mikhailovich. Deciding to act on an offer from a former colleague from earlier in the movie, Simon and Sergei get out of town taking the heroin with them using it as their \"start-up capital\".\nThe film then flashes forward to 2005.

He meets up with Father Francis, and Major Granville, the British military officer overseeing the dig. Making their way to Derati with Chuma, Merrin's translator and guide, Merrin introduces Francis to Rachel, a doctor and Emekwi, an enthusiastic convert who provides accommodation for the two men. As they tour the dig site, Merrin and Francis notice the church is in perfect condition, as though it had been deliberately buried immediately after its construction was completed.\nOn the site, Merrin meets a disabled young outcast named Cheche. Although dissuaded by Chuma, Merrin brings the boy to Rachel for medical treatment. Once the door is uncovered, Merrin, Francis, and Chuma go inside the church. A hidden passageway leads them to a crypt containing a demonic idol\u2014an ancient sanctuary where human sacrifice was performed. Merrin deduces that the church was expressly built to seal this underground temple. On their way back, they are confronted by local elders, who demand Merrin stop digging.\nFrancis contacts Granville to send a detachment to guard the dig against potential robbers, despite Merrin's objections. Two British soldiers attempting to loot some precious stones from the church are then found dead the next day (one without his head; the other crucified to the altar head downward). Despite the Christian symbolism used in the murders and the testimony of local warrior Jomo that the two men were affected by a strange madness, Granville, blaming the Turkana, goes to town in an uncharacteristic fit of rage demanding the purported culprits be given up, shooting a young woman in cold blood when the locals protest. Determined to stop the 'Christian evil' from spreading, Jomo breaks into the mission school and slaughters the students, including one of Emekwi's sons before he is shot on the spot by British soldiers.\nFrancis has a disturbing realization that Cheche's unusual recovery is not a divinely wrought miracle as he had first thought and considers baptizing him to save his soul; the boy accepts on the condition that it be held at the church. Meanwhile, a shaken and guilt-ridden Granville commits suicide by shooting himself in the mouth. The Turkana elders demand that the church be reburied and Francis\u2014who they hold responsible for the spread of the 'Christian evil' and the arrival of the British troops\u2014and Cheche be handed over to them to be killed but are turned down. Francis, assisted by Rachel, baptizes Cheche at the church, but the demon inside the boy attacks them. Realizing an exorcism is in order, Francis leaves quickly to fetch his copy of the Roman Ritual. An earthquake erupts and seals the entrance to the church.\nThe next morning, Merrin and the British find Francis tied to a tree naked, shot with arrows. The dying Francis reveals to Merrin that Cheche is possessed and begs him to perform an exorcism. Another earthquake shifts the rocks, unblocking the church entrance just enough to allow Merrin to go inside. At the underground temple, Merrin finds Rachel\u2014who runs away under a trance\u2014and the possessed Cheche. After donning Francis' vestments, Merrin returns to the church to begin the exorcism. The demon offers Merrin a chance to rewrite his past, at which Merrin (in a hallucination) finds himself back in 1944 Holland: when he refuses to cooperate, Kessel instead has Merrin and all the villagers killed for his defiance.\nWhen Merrin comes back to his senses, the demon mocks the futility of his attempt to change what happened. An aurora appears in the sky as the evil spirit's influence causes the entranced Rachel to attempt to kill herself, Emekwi to violently beat his wife, and the Turkana to charge into battle against the British. The exorcism eventually succeeds and the demon leaves Cheche's body, causing him to regress to his former condition.\nWith the demon exorcised, life in Derati returns to normal and the British detachment leaves.

The man behind the plan is one Jamwaal, a hardened criminal who is feared by political figures and the law alike. Siddhant starts an unofficial investigation against Jamwaal. A goon named Altaf is arrested in connection to the case after the ATC defuses a bomb threat at a building.\nLater, a woman is shot dead at her own home by an unknown assailant. Siddhant gets a tip from Neha, an undercover officer stationed by him in Canada, that an aide of Jamwaal named Himmat Mehendi has been arrested by the Canadian police. Siddhant sends his brother Shashank Dheer (Abhishek Bachchan) and his energetic partner, Aditya Singh (Zayed Khan), to apprehend Himmat, take him to a safe location pointed out by Neha, and extract information from him about Jamwaal and his plan. After attending his sister Anu's (Diya Mirza) engagement, Shashank and Aditya head to Canada on the same day. At the same time, Anu and her fianc\u00e9 are kidnapped in lieu of Altaaf's release. Siddhant then realises that there is a terrorist informer in the ATC itself.\nMeanwhile, in Canada, Aditya and Shashank are caught unawares when Aditya realises that the car they are travelling in has a bomb. He asks Shashank to drive fast as reducing the speed would detonate the bomb. A local police officer named Dan (Sunil Shetty) is meeting his estranged wife Priya (Raima Sen), trying to convince her to return to him after an incident that killed their baby while she was still pregnant. He sees them driving at top speed. He goes on to pursue them, much to Priya's anguish, resulting in a high speed car chase. Aditya and Shashank are able to escape and finally jump off the car as it travels a bridge, slows down, and explode. They then meet Neha, who reveals that she had planted the bomb in their car (having asked them by phone to get into it in the first place), calling it a test. The two go to her house and later manage to kidnap Himmat, who initially claims to them that he is \"JD\". Dan happens upon them again and now follows them to another bridge, where he pulls them over and roughly interrogates them, all the while refusing to believe who they really are. However, a hit squad appears on the bridge and attacks them. One of their bullets hits Dan on the shoulder while Aditya and Shashank react quickly enough to save his life and kill the men. Later, in custody, Himmat breaks down and tells them that everybody working for Jamwaal is a pawn who is expendable at any point. It is here that an initially skeptical Dan teams up with Aditya and Shashank in return for them saving his life, and the trio move to his house.\nWhen Himmat claims that he does not know anything else, the team realizes that Himmat believes Jamwaal will save him, which is why he is not revealing sensitive information. They then stage an attempt on Himmat's life, and a scared Himmat informs them that the only people who pose any real danger to Jamwaal are Asif and Irfan, his friends turned foes, who betrayed him in order to foil his plan for 10 May. Himmat tells them that he knows where Asif might be. This leads the team to a disco, Asif's supposed hideout, where they question him alongside Himmat. Asif merely gives them Irfan's whereabouts and commits suicide. They then confront Irfan, believing him to be Jamwaal, and after killing his goons, kill him too. In India, Siddhant prepares a trap to rescue Anu. Anu's fianc\u00e9 dies in blast, but Anu is saved, and the mole, Roy, is detained and commits suicide instead of suffering the indignity of going to prison, but not before revealing the codeword for the entire operation, \"JEET\". An enraged Siddhant learns from Altaf that the latter had been hired by Jamwaal to kill Asif and Irfan in Canada before the 10th. Siddhant decides to go to Canada, while his colleague and love interest, Aditi (Shilpa Shetty), decides to use Altaf as a bait to track down people in league with Jamwaal. As a result, many high-profile individuals and politicians are exposed.\nBack in Canada, Himmat is set free. Shashank decides to propose to Neha and goes to her house along with Dan and Aditya. However, they find the house suspiciously empty and dark. Suddenly, they hear the footsteps of an intruder and confront him. They are shocked to find that the intruder is Siddhant, who tells them that Neha had been murdered a long time back. Now, it is revealed that the woman who was shot to death earlier was the real Neha. Siddhant explains that Jamwaal had Neha killed and replaced a fake Neha, since he had prior information to Aditya and Shashank's arrival in Canada (because of Roy). The day Altaf was arrested, Jamwaal suffered an accident and was arrested in a DUI. The real Neha, who had been following them at that point, only knew the real Himmat Mehendi, who had been with Jamwaal at the time and who had been killed by Irfan shortly after that event. It was his body which was found in Priya's car when she was about to divorce Dan. Furthermore, Jamwaal had wanted to kill his former friends while they were trying to kill him too (Asif having sent the hit squad on the bridge). But Altaf, his hired goon, was arrested by ATC. When he was kidnapped by the group while being assumed to be Himmat Mehendi, he kept the misunderstanding going and conned Aditya, Shashank, and Dan to do what he wanted Altaf to do, thus making his coast clear. This leads to one shocking reality : the person that the group had assumed to be Himmat Mehendi was the real Jamwaal.\nStill clueless about Jamwaal's plan, the quartet, once again, focuses on \"JEET\". Siddhant figures that every letter in the word has something to do with its position in the English alphabet. J is 10, the date of the attack; E is 5, denoting the month of May; E denotes the time, 5 o' clock, and T is 20, which is still unknown. The group later receives information that a football match is supposed to take place at a nearby stadium on that date, and the Prime Minister of India has been invited there as the Chief Guest, to be felicitated by the 20-25 thousand people present.\nRealizing that this stadium will be bombed on the fateful day at 5 o'clock, the quartet turns up at the stadium and splits up. Early in the piece,  Siddhant is captured by the stadium guards, who were in on the plan. Aditya finds the bomb on a car whose registration number ends with the number 20 (thus explaining T in JEET), the timer having also been set at 20 minutes. He drives the car outside the stadium while Shashank finds another bomb of the same size and takes it to a nearby flying club, where he runs into the fake Neha, who confesses that she has fallen in love with him. They load the bombs into a small plane, with Shashank deciding to dispose of the bomb off in a deserted area, away from city limits. Dan enters the stadium by another route, only to end up being taken hostage along with his estranged wife and some school children she is escorting. Dan somehow rescues his wife and the children, while Siddhant manages to escape and kill some goons despite being temporarily blinded. As both heads to different directions to find Jamwaal, the latter is informed by his men that both the bombs have been taken away and that the mission has failed.  Jamwaal tries to escape from the building, only to run into Siddhant. As Siddhant doesn't appear to know him, Jamwaal nearly succeeds in escaping by pretending to be someone else, but Siddhant calls him on his bluff.\nHere, Shashank realizes that he has too little time to dispose off the second bomb safely, and decides to crash the plane along with himself and the fake Neha, much to the group's anguish. He bids an emotional farewell to the others on radio and then crashes the plane into a nearby lake. Meanwhile, Aditya is in trouble too, because he is running out of time and does not know where to dispose of the bomb. Siddhant is distraught by the turn of events. Dan calls for help, with which he succeeds in rescuing Aditya just moments before the jeep explodes in a valley. Jamwaal tries to escape, but is tracked down and shot dead by Siddhant in an elevator.\nThe film ends as Shashank's ashes are immersed in the river while Siddhant laments that while everything had returned to normal after those 7 days, it had come at the great expense of his brother's life.", "tmdb_plot": "Siddhant Dheer lives a wealthy lifestyle with his brother, Shashank, and sister, Anu.

During the trial, the statements of the witnesses are visualized via flashbacks. Prosecutor Ethan Thomas interrogates several doctors and neurologists to establish a medical cause for Emily's death, particularly epilepsy and schizophrenia. Emily had dropped out of her college studies after being consistently struck by delusions and muscle spasms at 3 a.m. She returned to her parents' home and was treated with epilepsy and psychosis medications. Moore was consulted when her condition failed to improve, and his assessment and observations led him to the conclusion that Emily was being possessed by a demon.

Graham Cartwright, a medical doctor who attended the exorcism, gives Bruner a cassette tape on which the exorcism was recorded, and Moore presents the recording as evidence.

Although momentarily shocked by the suggestion, Brewster ultimately accepts it, and Moore is free to go. Bruner is offered a partnership in her firm, but declines.

Their religious, mentally unbalanced mother, Eleanor, attempts to ignore David's behavior; their withdrawn and ill father is about to be placed in a nursing home. When Jimmy shyly announces at the family dinner table that his piano teacher plans to include him in an upcoming recital, David belittles and beats him, ordering him to give up his \"sissy\" piano and work at the garage, earn money and be a real man. Jimmy finds temporary escape from his family dysfunction by visiting a traveling carnival that stops in Wamego each summer. He forms a platonic friendship with the premiere sideshow attraction, Sandra, an aging but still glamorous lounge singer. Sandra is virtually a captive of the sadistic carnival owner, Frank, who abuses her emotionally and physically. While Jimmy dreams of running away to play piano for the carnival, Sandra has the opposite dream \u2014 to escape the carnival and live a normal life.\nSandra had a past relationship with David, but when he approaches her again, she makes it clear that she is no longer interested in him and tells him that she won't let him \"hurt her\" again. David goes home and takes out his frustrations on Jimmy, in a scene where sexual abuse is strongly implied but not shown. It is later revealed that David got Sandra pregnant the previous summer, and when the pathologically jealous Frank found out, he cruelly terminated her pregnancy and mutilated her genitals to make her unattractive to other men. Unwilling to take no for an answer, David confronts Sandra at her trailer, and discovers Jimmy hiding there. David flies into a rage, rapes Jimmy in front of Sandra, and storms out. Sandra consoles Jimmy, who goes home. The next day, the carnival leaves town, its departure coinciding with David's disappearance, which the female police chief, Edith \"Ed\" Carlisle, begins to investigate. It begins to appear that a murder, presumably of David, took place at his family's home.\nMeanwhile, the carnival is losing money and Frank's treatment of Sandra is becoming worse, including sending his gang of brutal henchmen to menace her sexually. She resolves to leave and the other carnival freaks bid her goodbye. Jimmy arrives planning to join the carnival, but Sandra, knowing that the carnival is also a dysfunctional environment and not the escape of which Jimmy dreams, sends him home.

Sweet's men attack the brothers; Jack is shot during the attack and subsequent gunfight, and dies shortly after. Bobby and Angel manage to fend off and kill the gunmen. Bobby finds one of the gunmen still alive and questions him about who sent them, confirming it was Sweet.\nLieutenant Green arrives and informs them that Evelyn filed a police report regarding Victor Sweet and his involvement in Jeremiah's affairs, and his partner, Detective Fowler, passed that report on to Sweet. Green warns them to stay out of the matter and let him handle Fowler, and then they will work together on Sweet. Later at a bar, Green asks Fowler about Fowler seeing Evelyn a week before she was killed and asks him, \"Why didn't you tell me that? Don't you think that that's relevant to a murder investigation?\" Fowler simply responds, \"I didn't tell you because it wasn't relevant at all\". Fowler then lies and says the police report that Evelyn filed was given to another department to handle, though Green already knows that Fowler gave the report to Sweet. Realizing that Fowler is a crooked cop, Green attacks Fowler with a pool stick and orders Fowler to hand in his badge. After they walk out of the bar, Fowler shoots and kills Green and calls into dispatch claiming two Black assailants had fired upon Green.\nThe remaining brothers devise a plan to buy Victor Sweet off with the $400,000 from their mother's life insurance. Arriving at Fowler's, Angel subdues him. Jeremiah goes to meet Sweet while Angel's girlfriend, Sofi, heads to the police station, where she tells them that Angel is planning to kill a police officer. Hearing the sirens in the distance, Fowler believes they are coming for Angel, until Angel opens his jacket revealing a wire. Angel claims the whole conversation was taped, including Fowler's admission that he killed Green. The police arrive at Fowler's in full force, at which point Fowler gets the upper hand on Angel. With his gun pointed at Angel's head, Fowler tells the officers outside to back off, and despite telling him they are there to rescue him, Fowler opens fire on the officers, who kill him.\nMeanwhile, at frozen-over Lake St. Clair, Jeremiah meets with Sweet, who reveals that he intends to kill him. Then Jeremiah reveals that the $400,000 is to pay off Sweet's henchmen, who are already embittered towards him because of his blatant mistreatment of them, in exchange for killing Sweet. Sweet angrily demands to know who will be the one to kill him, just as Bobby shows up. Bobby and Sweet brawl, during which Bobby uses his hockey playing skills to get the upper hand, knocking Sweet unconscious. His former henchmen seal his fate, dropping him into a hole carved in the ice.\nThe three brothers, taken into police custody, are beaten in an attempt to make them confess to the murder of Sweet but give up nothing.

Another child, Simon, suffers a broken leg and is rushed to the X-ray department. No one knows how his leg broke but as Simon lies on the X-ray table, his femur inexplicably suffers a second fracture.\nSusan leaves the hospital on sick leave and Amy Nicholls replaces her. Amy bonds with Maggie as both are orphans. Maggie explains to Amy that there is a girl called Charlotte who lives in the abandoned ward upstairs. Roy, the operations manager, explains to Amy that Charlotte is an urban legend that has been seen by several children over the past two decades. Simon later tells Amy that Charlotte is the one who broke his leg. Amy visits Susan to ask why she left but learns that Susan died in an accident. She meets two local psychics, who explain that Charlotte can only be seen by those who are close to death.\nBack at Mercy Falls, the children watch Sleeping Beauty and Maggie says that true love's kiss has special power.

Later, Roy is killed by Charlotte after she causes him to have a  major nose bleed then violently forces him backward through a window.\nAmy goes up to the second floor through a hidden trapdoor. She finds an old photograph of a girl in a wheelchair with a nurse and a film-reel which shows the girl on a medical treatment for osteogenesis imperfecta or \"brittle bone disease\". The photograph is labelled, \"Charlotte and Mandy, 1959.\" Charlotte begins to appear in front of a metal door shown as a grey tall figure with braces on her legs. Maggie saves Amy, dropping her favorite blanket, \"Mr. Sleepy\" in the process. Amy and Dr. Robert view the film and Robert explains the disease Charlotte suffered from was a sickness that causes the patient's bones to be susceptible to fractures. Doctors had built metal, orthotic braces for Charlotte to wear, in the hopes of strengthening her bones. Amy now believes Charlotte is the angry ghost of the little girl who is hurting the children. She searches the records but no child called Charlotte existed.\nAmy finally learns why the upstairs ward is closed. The nurse caring for the little girl had become obsessed with her. When the treatments began to work and the child improved, she started purposely breaking the girl's bones and eventually murdered the child. She then put on the child's metal,  orthotic braces and leapt down an elevator shaft, to her death. Robert shows Amy a file he found which proves that \"Mandy\" is the child's name and \"Charlotte\" is in fact, the obsessed nurse. Amy realizes Charlotte wants the children.\nThe hospital starts falling apart because of Charlotte's rage as the staff desperately try to evacuate the children, assisted by additional staff from St. James's. As help arrives, Amy realises that everything is suddenly calm, and Mrs. Folder says that Maggie is missing. Amy realises that Maggie went to get her 'Mr Sleepy' and runs to the abandoned ward. Weak and exhausted, Maggie is in Mandy's old room. Despite Charlotte's presence, Amy determinedly picks up Maggie and tries to reach the trapdoor but Charlotte causes the floor to destabilise and Amy's leg is impaled by a piece of metal, causing major bleeding. As the two escape the second floor by jumping through the trapdoor, Maggie succumbs to her illness and stops breathing. Despite Amy's desperate attempts, the little girl dies in her arms. Amy then also collapses from blood loss.\nRobert futilely tries to revive her with a defibrillator but Amy's heart stops beating.

This will increase their desirability rating, their value as sexual commodities, and therefore also their credit rating.  Because of its direct relation to one's credit rating and buying power, insurance policies covering a person's sexual desirability are available.\nTo give himself an alibi during an action he planned for the counter-revolution, Jack attempts to hook up with his co-worker Cecile (Sabrina Lloyd) but loses heart, leading the insurance company to investigate why this happened.

During one of her competitions, she is discovered by a famous Russian skating coach, Natasha Goberman. However, Natasha coaches at an expensive boarding school and Katelin's parents cannot afford to send her there. To help Katelin with the expenses, Natasha convinces the girls hockey team coach to give the last hockey scholarship to Katelin so she can train at the boarding school. Katelin is overjoyed and excited to be taught by Natasha but quickly learns that juggling hockey practice, skate club practice, and her homework is much harder than she imagined. A student assistant coach for the hockey team named Spencer constantly ridicules her, and her fellow skaters in the figure skating club are just as rude. Katelin is also forced to hide all of her precious figure-skating-related belongings, as the hockey coach warns her that the girls on the hockey team despise \"twirl girls\". However, Katelin does find some consolation in her roommate, Hollywood Henderson, a fellow hockey player. She finds out that Katelin is a figure skater, but promises not to tell anyone.\nKatelin faces several obstacles in her new life. Pamela, a figure skater jealous of Katelin's skill and Natasha's obvious liking towards her, locks her in the janitor's closet during a party and sets a trap for her to end up having a can of purple paint dumped on her. Due to this, Katelin loses a private training session with one of her idols, Kristi Yamaguchi, to Pamela, causing Natasha to feel great disappointment towards Katelin. Her teammates on the hockey team turn on her after their first game, when Katelin did not block for the team captain and caused her to be tackled by the opposing team. Katelin works hard to improve, but is overpowered and feels like quitting.\nKatelin begins flunking her schoolwork as well. Combined with the hostility of the hockey team, the stress gets to her and she gets on a bus home. When she arrives at her house, she finds that her parents have packed up all of her things in boxes. Feeling unwanted, Katelin grabs a box of her ice skating things and runs out of the house. As she sits on a bench and rummages through her belongings, she finds that her mother was a \"twirl girl\" as well when she sees a picture of her mother on the ice and prizes from various competitions in the box. After talking with her mother, Katelin decides that she's not going to quit no matter how hard things may seem, and she goes back to school.\nA great change occurs in Katelin. She pushes herself harder now to do her best in everything, including hockey. She is the first to arrive for practice and she improves greatly. Katelin spends a lot of time studying and her grades improve drastically. She spends hours practicing both hockey and figure skating alone.  Spencer, who overheard a conversation between Natasha and the hockey coach, knows that Katelin is a figure skater and admires her even more for it due to her drastic improvement. In their first game of the season, Katelin's practice pays off when she helps her team win. With Katelin, the girls hockey team is suddenly on a winning streak. She starts to teach the hockey team about balancing with ballet, and uses her brother's ice hockey tactics to improve their team's performance, bringing the team to the finals for the first time in seven years.\nLater on, when the coach announces the date of the finals, Katelin realizes that it is also the same day as the Senior Nationals, an event that scouts for potential Olympic figure skaters. She is extremely confused and has no idea what she should do. Spencer, Hollywood, and Natasha all push her to go to the Nationals, as Hollywood insists that Katelin won't be able to skate in the Olympics if she doesn't go to the competition. However, Katelin still feels conflicted, as she feels that she will be letting down her teammates on the hockey team. In the end, Katelin shows up at the hockey game, much to Spencer's disbelief. They lose the finals by one goal, but the team is far from disappointed, saying that they were happy to have made it into the finals and that they will have another chance next season.\nSpencer gathers all of Katelin's figure skating equipment and takes her to the Senior Nationals, but her suitcase falls open in front of the hockey team before they can make it out and they see all of her stuffed animals and dresses. Katelin runs away in embarrassment. In the car, Spencer gives her the dress. \"It's perfect,\" Katelin exclaims before kissing Spencer on the cheek. While getting ready, Katelin realizes that one of her skates is missing, and that it must have fallen out when she was running in a hurry. She tells Natasha that she will skate in her hockey skates instead, but that fails when she falls right in the beginning of her skating routine. However, the entire hockey team arrives with her missing skate. Natasha tries to get the judges to let her restart, but when they refuse, the hockey team starts a chant of \"Let her skate!\", which soon echoes throughout the entire stadium. The judges relent and allow Katelin another chance to perform. She does a wonderful job on her routine. The hockey team rushes forward at the end of her performance and hoists her onto her shoulders. Spencer gives her a large bouquet of flowers.

To afford travel to England, Santiago saves his earnings, which is later used by Hernan to buy a truck for the business, being dismissive of Santiago's chances at becoming a professional. Santiago's grandmother, Mercedes, secretly hands him money and urges him to depart for England before Hernan can find out.\nArriving in Newcastle, Santiago stays with Glen and begins his trial. In muddy conditions, Santiago struggles under pressure from Hughie McGowan, a teammate, during a training match. Although unimpressed, Erik Dornhelm, the club's manager, acquiesces to Glen's request that Santiago's trial last for a month. During a medical, Santiago lies about his asthma to club nurse, Roz Harmison, fearing it will damage his chances of being signed; he is then given a one-month contract.\nDespite facing some bullying by Hughie, Santiago becomes friends with Jamie Drew, another player on trial. Santiago soon adapts to English conditions and a reserve match is scheduled at the end of his trial to determine his signing on a full-time basis. Before the match, Santiago tries to use his inhaler but Hughie destroys it, leading to an asthma flare-up. After another disappointing performance, Newcastle let Santiago go.\nOn his way to the airport, Santiago's taxi picks up Gavin Harris, an indisciplined, struggling yet talented player who recently joined Newcastle.

Edward R. Murrow, along with his news team, producer Fred Friendly and reporter Joseph Wershba, learn of U.S. Air Force officer Milo Radulovich, who is being forcibly discharged because of family members being known Communists and his refusal to denounce them.\nInterest is piqued when it is found that the compilation of charges at Radulovich's hearing was in a sealed envelope and nobody saw them. Murrow presents the story to CBS News' director, Sig Mickelson, who warns Murrow that the story will bring serious accusations and repercussions to CBS and their sponsors, some of whom have government contracts. He reluctantly allows the story to air, which gains positive responses from the public. Murrow also tries to ease the worries of his colleague, Don Hollenbeck, who is struggling with both the strain of his recent divorce and attacks from newspaper writer Jack O'Brian, who is accusing him of being biased in his news reporting and being a \"pinko\".\nWhile covering a story in Washington DC, Wershba is given an envelope suggesting that Murrow has previously interacted with the Soviets and used to be on their payroll. CBS's Chief Executive, William Paley, brings this up with Murrow. He warns Murrow that if any members of his staff are associated with Communism in any way, however remotely, they would have to recuse themselves from Murrow's next story. They were planning to make a direct attack on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his crusade against Communist infiltration in the U.S. government, which some denounce as a witch hunt. Friendly and Murrow gather their staff together, and when one of the team members voluntarily excuses himself because his ex-wife had attended Communist meetings before they even met, Murrow concludes that this kind of fear is what McCarthy wants. The team stays together and presents the story, which becomes highly praised by the public and the press, with the exception of Jack O'Brian, who continues to attack both Murrow and especially Hollenbeck on their supposed support of Communism. Hollenbeck pleads with Murrow to go after O'Brian, but Murrow reluctantly tells him that he cannot attack O'Brian while he is busy going after McCarthy.\nAs the team turns their focus to a filmed hearing of Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon communication worker accused of being a Communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an FBI infiltrator of the American Communist Party, they receive the news that Milo Radulovich is being reinstated by the Air Force, citing no direct evidence supporting any connections with Communism. McCarthy then asks for the opportunity to speak for himself on Murrow's show, which Murrow allows. McCarthy openly accuses Murrow of being a Communist, citing several pieces of evidence that seem to support it. Murrow broadcasts a rebuttal the following week, easily disproving McCarthy's accusations and pointing out that McCarthy didn't do anything to defend himself other than accuse anyone who opposes him as being either a Communist or a Communist sympathizer.\nA few days later, the news arrives that the U.S. Senate is investigating McCarthy, which means the imminent end of his crusade. As the team celebrates, Friendly and Murrow learn that Hollenbeck has died by suicide. Paley then tells Murrow and Friendly that their news program's airtime is going to be severely cut, citing the high costs of the show's production, along with Murrow's attacks on controversial topics. Also, Joe Wershba and his wife Shirley, who have been concealing their marriage due to CBS forbidding co-workers from being married, are approached by Mickelson, who tells them that everyone knows of their marriage and that he will allow one of them to resign to save face, which Joe agrees to do.\nThe film is framed by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the Radio and Television News Directors Association at \"A Salute to Edward R. Murrow\" on October 25, 1958, in which he harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only \"wires and lights in a box\".", "tmdb_plot": "The story of journalist Edward R.

It opens at a crematorium in Kobe, Japan, where a family is paying their respects to Hisako Sawano (Seita and Setsuko's aunt), who has just passed away at the age of 95. The funeral director comments how a person who lived through the Meiji, Taish\u014d, Sh\u014dwa, and Heisei periods has finally gone to rest. After the funeral, Natsu (Seita's and Setsuko's cousin), Hisako's eldest of four children who is now a grandmother herself, sorts through her mother's belongings with her teenage granddaughter, Keiko. Keiko unexpectedly finds the metal fruit-drop tin and asks why it is important. Natsu begins to tell her about the family's struggle to survive during the Second World War, and the emotional scars that it left.\nJust prior to Seita's death in September 1945, someone informed Hisako and Natsu that he was still alive, though with no sign of his sister Setsuko and living near the central railway station in Kobe. Hisako and Natsu go to the station in hope of finding Seita, but cannot. Natsu asks a janitor if he saw \"a third-year middle-school student, Seita Yokokawa, from Kobe 1st Middle School\", wearing a school cap and with his little sister. This triggers another janitor's memory and he recalls that the previous night, the two of them had found a dead boy matching Seita's description in a corner of the station. While carrying his corpse to be cremated, a metal fruit-drop tin fell from his clothes and thinking it rubbish, the janitor tossed it into a field.\nHisako locates the tin; while Natsu looks on, she opens it and tips two small bits of white bone into her palm \u2013 Setsuko's. Hisako falls silent, while Natsu, who understands what happened to her cousins, blames her mother for causing their deaths and walks away, crying. After she leaves, Hisako notices two small, glowing fireflies under the tin. While watching them fly away, Hisako tearfully whispers a soft thanks, knowing she has been forgiven.\nIt is the 18th year of Sh\u014dwa \u2013 1943. Seita's father, a Captain in the Imperial Navy, privately reveals to him that the war is going badly for Japan, telling him that he must now look after his mother and sister as he will soon be deployed, and that he is willing to die in the Emperor's service. Seita gives his father his assurance, and his father promises that Japan will win the war despite the current situation. Meanwhile, Seita's uncle, Genzo Sawano, a carpenter, has been drafted into the army shortly after his family has relocated to Kobe. Hisako and Natsu are worried about his departure, but try to be optimistic for Hana, Yuki, and Teiz\u014d.\nAfter the departure of both husbands, Hisako and Kyoko bump into each other. The families spend the day together and Hisako gives Setsuko a tin with candy fruits. Hisako and Kyoko agree to try to help each other out while both their husbands are away.\nAs time progresses, an ever-increasing number of people are forced to deal with bombing raids and worsening shortages of food. On the day of the Kobe city firebombings, Seita is burying food in his yard. Kyoko leaves to go to the bomb shelter as Seita and Setsuko soon follow. Both Seita and Setsuko are caught in the middle of the bombing but escape unharmed, though Setsuko loses one of her sandals. After the bombings, they go to a school where doctors are giving medical attention to those hurt. As they arrive at the school, Hisako meets both of them outside and says that Kyoko was injured. He goes to see her while Hisako watches Setsuko. Inside, Seita finds his mother wrapped in bandages, the doctor says one of the bombs got into the shelter and went off. She dies soon after.\nHisako takes Setsuko home with her while Seita stays for the evening. He is given an urn with his mother's ashes in it. He returns to Hisako's house where he says that he will now be responsible for taking care of Setsuko, even though Hisako thinks he should go to school and she will watch Setsuko. Seita writes his father and tells him about the death of his mother and that he and Setsuko and staying with their aunt. He gives Setsuko their mother's jade ring, which Setsuko treasures, and wears on a necklace.\nAs food rations are dropping, Hisako starts to worry about how she will feed her children, nephew and niece. She then sells her kimono for money and is chastised for taking in two other children and how they do not help in a time of war. As she is walking home, Hisako learns that her husband was killed in action in a banzai charge. As she and her children grieve over his death, Seita assures Hisako that she should feel happy since his death has meaning; Hisako does not take this lightly. At night, Teiz\u014d begins suffering from asthma; Setsuko starts crying and refusing to go to sleep. Hisako then leaves to try to find a doctor.\nThe next day as they are eating, Seita and Setsuko are only served soup with no rice; they continue to get served very little while Hisako's children get plenty. During another bombing, Seita and Setsuko take refuge in an abandoned bomb shelter. Seeing the explosion from a distance, it reminds them of a fireworks show they saw some years ago. Hisako gets on to Seita about leaving on his own during the bombing and how he should start to help by letting Hisako sell his mother's jade ring for rice; Seita is hesitant at first but gives in, which angers Setsuko. Hisako agrees to give them rice that night for dinner.\nHisako continues to feed Seita and Setsuko very little, even making them start to provide for their own water. Natsu chastises her mother for how she is treating them but Hisako ignores her. Seita and Setsuko eventually leave and go to live in the bomb shelter. While their cousins protest, Hisako remains silent.\nWhile at the shelter, Seita entertains Setsuko by catching and releasing fireflies inside. The following morning when she buries them, Setsuko tells Seita that she knows their mother was killed. Seita assures Setsuko that Japan will win the war and their father will return to them.\nMeanwhile, Hisako's brother-in-law, Yoshie, gives her some money and leaves her home. Seita and Setsuko begin to starve and Seita resorts to stealing food from a farmer; Natsu witnesses this and is shocked; when the farmer catches Seita and asks if she knows him, Natsu makes no comment and Seita leaves in shock with Setsuko. Setsuko becomes ill and when she is taken to the hospital, the doctor does very little to help.\nDuring another bombing, Seita breaks into a shop and steals food but is caught, beaten up by the store owner, taken to the police. After the bombing, Hisako comes to get Seita and is warned that if he does it again, she will be held responsible. As they are walking, Seita tries to explain his actions but Hisako tells him that she cannot feed them properly. Seita then runs away in anger back to the shelter where he breaks down into tears and Setsuko comforts him.\nThe following morning, Setsuko is trying to eat marbles, thinking they are fruit drops. Seita decides use the remaining money he has to buy her food. Meanwhile, an announcement is made by the emperor about the unconditional surrender of Japan, which Hisako and her children hear over the radio; Hana, Yuki, and Teiz\u014d are relieved the war is over while Natsu is shocked that they lost and Hisako simply goes to cook breakfast. Seita hears the news on the streets from a group of returning soldiers. He also learns that the imperial fleet was wiped out as well, meaning his father has died. Seita breaks down in grief, whereupon he is found by Yoshie. Yoshie tries to talk to Seita but he runs off. Yoshie later meets with Hisako and explains he plans to return to Tokyo. He also reveals his encounter with Seita, which Natsu overhears.\nSeita returns to the shop, where the owners initially throw him out but he begs them to sell him food. Seita returns to the shelter to cook some food, only to find out that Setsuko has died, much to his devastation. Meanwhile, Natsu and Hisako go to find Seita and Setsuko now that the war is over. They locate the bomb shelter and are shocked to see how Seita and Setsuko had been living. Natsu and Hisako continue searching for the siblings but are unsuccessful. Meanwhile, Seita takes Setsuko's body to the top of a hill, where he cremates her in a straw casket. During the cremation, fireflies arrive in the night. Seita then takes some of his sister's bones and places them in the fruit-drop tin. After this, he goes to the railway station in Kobe, and dies.\nFollowing this flashback, both Natsu and Hisako leave the station. Natsu goes to the bridge where her family saw fireflies the first time. She feels guilty and unable to live with happened to Seita and Setsuko. Hisako slaps her, warning Natsu that the real war has begun and dying means losing before embracing her daughter as she cries. Later, Hisako and her children moved back to Tokyo and a law was passed in Japan to protect orphans affected by war. Hisako never again mentioned the war until her death.\nIn the present day, Natsu and Keiko are on the same bridge she was on years ago. Natsu reflects on how the war changed everyone as she and Keiko discuss its impact on their family history. As Keiko watches on, Natsu takes out Setsuko's remains and throws them into the river.

At a local festival, he is chosen to be that year's Kirin Rider, referring to the legendary Chinese chimera, the Qilin: a protector of all things good. He soon discovers that his new title is quite literal, as a nefarious spirit named Yasunori Kat\u014d appears. Kat\u014d - a demon whose mystical powers are born of his rage at the annihilation of Japan's local tribes - desires vengeance against the modern Japanese for their actions against the y\u014dkai. To carry out his revenge, Kat\u014d allies himself with a y\u014dkai named Agi, summoning a fiery spirit called Yomotsumono: a creature composed of the resentment carried by the multitudinous things mankind has discarded. Kat\u014d feeds yokai into Yomotsumono's flames, fusing them with the numerous discarded tools and items to form kikai. These kikai - under Kat\u014d's control - capture other y\u014dkai to build their numbers while killing humans. One such yokai, a sunekosuri escapes and befriends Tadashi who attempts to obtain the Daitenguken from the mountain as a right of passage for the role of Kirin Rider.\nScared by the tales told of the mountain, Tadashi falters upon his arrival at the mountain and tries to flee. However, tricked by the sea spirit Sh\u014dj\u014d, who picked Tadashi out, he manages to overcome a test to prove his worth. Accompanied by Sh\u014dj\u014d, Kawahime, and Kawatar\u014d, Tadashi makes his way to the Daitengu who gives him the sword before being taken away by the kikai. In spite of Tadashi's attempts, the sword is broken as Agi takes the sunekosuri as her captive before the boy is knocked unconscious.\nWhen Tadashi comes to his senses, he finds himself among y\u014dkai as they discuss how to fix the sword; they ultimately decide to request the aid of the blacksmith Ippondatara. Upon learning that Ippondatara was also captured, General Nurarihyon and his group leave. Kawataro restrains an ittan-momen, praising the bumbling Azukiarai, unaware that he only remained behind due to his foot getting numb.\nWhen Kat\u014d's industrial fortress takes flight towards Tokyo, Tadashi and company pursue it. They arrive shortly after the fortress ingests Tokyo's Shinjuku Capital Building, finding Ippondatara who reforges the sword. Ippondatara refuses to talk about how he escaped, ashamed that the sunekosuri took his place in becoming a kikai. Donning new attire, Tadashi and company go into battle. They are greatly outnumbered until they receive unlikely aid from thousands of y\u014dkai who believe they are coming to a party; their festival brawl with the kikai allows Tadashi and Kawahime to enter the fortress safely, followed by a y\u014dkai-obsessed reporter named Sata whom Kawahime saved in the past.\nTadashi is forced to slay the kikai that the sunekosuri became, restoring it to its original form yet leaving it gravely injured. In a rage, Tadashi battles Agi before she is called back by Kat\u014d to begin the final phase by joining with Yomotsumono. Despite Tadashi's attempts, Kat\u014d outmatches him.

Amateur golf in that era was a sport only for the wealthy, and Ouimet came from an Irish and French-Canadian immigrant family that was part of the working class. Ouimet watches an exhibition by legendary Jersey golf pro Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) as a 7-year-old boy, and becomes very interested in golf. He begins as a caddie at The Country Club, a posh enclave located across the street from his home in suburban Brookline, Massachusetts, while making friends with the other caddies. He works on his own golf game at every chance, and gradually accumulates his own set of clubs. Francis practices putting at night in his room. He wins the Massachusetts Schoolboy Championship.\nOne day, a Club member, Mr. Hastings (Justin Ashforth), asks Ouimet to play with him over The Country Club course, where caddies have almost no access of their own, and he shoots a fine round of 81 despite a 9 on one hole. His talent, composure, and good manners earn admirers and interest. With the help of Mr. Hastings and the Club Caddiemaster, Francis gets a chance to play in an upcoming tournament, the U.S. Amateur, the local qualifying for which is to be held at the very same Country Club course. However, his father Arthur (Elias Koteas) tells his son to quit golf and get a \"real job\". Ouimet needs $50 for the entry fee, and so agrees to get a real job and never play golf again if he could not qualify; his father lends him the money. On the 18th, Francis faces a three-foot putt that would secure him a spot in the championship, but he looks over and his father is watching. Ouimet is distracted, misses and falls one stroke short of qualifying for the championship proper.\nWith much jeer from the rich folk, Ouimet, now 20, fulfills his promise to his dad and works at a sporting goods shop, while continuing to live at home. After some time with his golf forgotten, Ouimet is still at the bottom of the working class. But one day, the president of the United States Golf Association enters the store and personally invites him to play in the upcoming U.S. Open. After some maneuvering and consideration from his employer, Ouimet secures entry. His father informs Ouimet that he must find his own place to live after the tournament and Ouimet agrees to this arrangement. However, his mother has been supportive of his golf from the start. She admonishes Ouimet's father for not recognizing Ouimet's talent and that he now has a chance to demonstrate it in an important tournament.\nOuimet competes in the 1913 U.S. Open that takes place at The Country Club. The favorites are British champions Vardon and Ted Ray (Stephen Marcus), who are accompanied by the snobbish Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth), and the reigning U.S. Open champion, John McDermott. Northcliffe looks to see that either Vardon or Ray wins the Open, to affirm British dominance over the Americans in golf, and also to prove that only gentlemen were able champions. Ouimet competes with his 10-year old friend, Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter), who skips school to caddie for Ouimet. After the first two rounds, Vardon and Ray have a seemingly comfortable lead, with McDermott unable to keep up. After some initial struggles, Ouimet rallies back and ends up tying with Vardon and Ray at the end of the fourth round, meaning that the three of them would compete in an 18-hole playoff to determine the champion. The night before, Northcliffe mocks Ouimet's social status to Vardon, who came from humble beginnings himself, and Vardon finally tells Northcliffe that he is going to try to win only for his own pride, not Britain's and that if Ouimet wins, it will be because of his own skill, not his background.\nThe playoff round commences, with all three competitors keeping it close until the final holes, where Ray fades out, and Ouimet ahead of Vardon by a stroke going into the final hole. Vardon finishes with a par, giving Ouimet the chance to clinch the win with a par himself. Seeing him become nervous before the final putt, Eddie calms him down, and Ouimet is able to make the putt and win the U.S. Open. As the crowd carries him and Eddie on their shoulders, they start to hand him money. Ouimet refuses it all, only accepting one bill from his now proud father. In the clubhouse, Vardon privately congratulates Ouimet and suggests that they should play a friendly round together in the future. Ouimet and Eddie then walk home, carrying the U.S. Open trophy.\nA series of texts shows that Harry Vardon went on to win his sixth British Open Championship the following year, also Francis won two amateur championships and became a businessman and Eddie went on to become a multi-millionaire.", "tmdb_plot": "A biopic of 20-year-old Francis Ouimet who defeated his golfing idol and 1900 US Open Champion, Harry Vardon.", "tmdb_id": "15487", "wiki_id": "1959014"}, {"title": "Green Chair", "genres": ["Romance", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Kim Mun-hee is a 32-year-old divorced woman.

The only apparent military duty is to unload and reload a supply plane every couple of months. The base has been commanded for many years by the near-insane Lt. Col. L. G.

One Christmas Eve morning, Eubie's boss, Norbert, assigns him to checking the naughty and nice lists. However, while checking the lists, Eubie discovers that every child in the town of Bluesville is naughty. So, he decides to go to Bluesville and spread Christmas cheer.\nBluesville is a dark miserable town at the bottom of a very deep valley, completely surrounded by tall dark cliffs. There, the townspeople feel the warmth of the sun only once a day. They never smile, they don't know how to tell a joke properly, most of them work at the What Factory, where all the world's question marks are made, and at the Bluesville school, recess only lasts one minute. Eubie tries to brighten everyone's spirits, but his overly good mood frightens them.\nEubie talks to the mayor about what is wrong with Bluesville and if there's anything about Bluesville that makes him feel proud. The mayor replies that Bluesville is the world's largest manufacturer of un-burnable coal, which children enjoy throwing at people and at each other. The mayor then makes a deal with Eubie. If he can find another use for the coal, he'll put a Christmas tree up in the town square.\nEubie's first plan on getting the kids to help him make Bluesville a happier place is having them gather on a busy street and start a pie fight, but that only makes all the people angry. To search for more help, Molly (Mae Whitman), a naughty 10-year-old girl, takes Eubie to downtown Bluesville, the most miserable part of Bluesville, for a meeting of a group called S.L.O.B. (Smile League Of Bluesville), which only has one member of its group. While there, Molly and Eubie meets up with Curtis (Candi Milo), who is there because he brought along his foreign friend, Oreg, who doesn't speak English, but is happy to be there. Molly soon decides that Eubie's plans are hopeless, and tells him to just take all his big ideas home. At the mention of that, Eubie gets another idea, and is about to implement it when the lights in the room go off and Eubie is taken back to the North Pole.\nIn his bid to get Bluesville off the naughty list, Eubie violated several rules in one day. As punishment, Santa had Eubie turn in his magic hat, which, at the North Pole, meant his Christmas happiness and powers were taken away. When Gilda (Carol Kane) hears this, she motivates Eubie to go back to Bluesville to finish his job and gives him her hat to restore his powers and happiness. He then returns to Bluesville and explains his plan to the children. That night, they give the mayor of Bluesville a bottle of anti-snore medicine in his sleep, while Eubie spends the night polishing all the cliffs surrounding Bluesville with a jar of super-duper un-burnable coal polish. While he is doing this, Derek notices Gilda doesn't have her hat on, he soon figures out what is going on and, trying to follow the North Pole rules, he notifies one of the higher-ups.\nAfter polishing the cliffs, Eubie is taken back to the North Pole again where he and Gilda are put on punishment and are sentenced to clean up the toy factory, with both their hats taken away. Derek, now alone at the Christmas party, is sad and mad with himself for betraying his friends, and confesses to what he did to Eubie and Gilda. They forgive him, but it only makes him feel worse about himself, considering what he did to them. While wondering what he can do to make it up to them, they have him do the one thing Eubie intended to do to finish making Bluesville a happier place.\nWhen the sun shines over Bluesville again, it reflects off the polished coal, lighting up the town and making everyone happy.

As adults, their lives have had many parallels: They both have successful careers (Erica is an author and teacher and Heather is a doctor) and both are happily married and loving mothers to seven-year-old children.\nErica's daughter Sarah and Heather's son David grow up sharing an equally close bond, but David is struck by a car and dies. Erica anguishes over how she might be able to explain to Sarah that David is dead, but the bond between the two children seems to extend past the grave, as Sarah reveals that David has already told her he is gone. At school, Sarah hurts a boy from her class when he makes a negative comment about David. When her parents pick her up, Sarah nervously tells them that she doesn't want them to drive over Creek Bridge. Later, they find out there was an accident on that bridge and Sarah had drawn a picture of it because David had told her to. That day, Sarah's nanny, Rosie, notices that the girl has a strange bruise on the back of her neck.\nErica and her husband Edgar decide that Erica and Sarah should go stay at the family's country house to help Sarah forget about David. In the city, Heather is still in grief so she decides to drive out to the country house to join her sister. Rosie finds out that Sarah is still in contact with David and gives her a friendship bracelet to protect her. Rosie tells Erica she thinks the bruises may be from David's spirit looking to cross back over, holding onto the neck of a living person, which she refers to as 'hanting.' During the night, Erica, Heather and Rosie run to Sarah's room at her screams and see that her wrist is swollen and bloody, as if someone was trying to rip the bracelet off. Rosie is apprehensive as she senses that David might be a danger to Sarah. The twins however disregard her warnings and decide it would be best to have Rosie leave because of her beliefs, wary they might be impacting Sarah. As Heather drops off Rosie the next morning, Rosie begs her to at least place the talisman bracelet she'd made before under Sarah's pillow or bed, in order to help protect Sarah. Heather agrees, yet the moment Rosie leaves she chucks it out of the car window. Rosie, unawares of her action, yet feels a chill. Heather and Sarah start building a dollhouse as a memorial for David but don't tell Erica that is its purpose. Erica surprisingly finds out she is 12 weeks pregnant, after Sarah mysteriously mentions her having a baby, and is put on bed rest. She again says David told her. Erica starts getting jealous because Sarah spends a lot of time with Heather building the dollhouse, but eventually calms down when she sees how beautiful it is; she apologizes to both for being so neurotic. Later, Edgar shows Erica a house he put an offer on. The strange thing is that it's an exact replica of the dollhouse. They move in, although Erica does so reluctantly as she cannot explain how the dollhouse can be an almost exact replica of the house, or how Sarah could've known.\nThree months later, Sarah is still acting strangely: she never has an appetite, is always tired and doesn't make any friends at the new school. Concerned, Erica takes her to the psychologist, who notices the bruises on her neck and wants to call social services, thinking Erica might be hurting her own daughter. However, Heather (a colleague) talks her out of it. When Heather mentions it to Erica, the latter freaks out and tells her sister to leave; accusing her that Heather believes Erica's baby might be David's reincarnation. Outside, as she leaves Heather sees Sarah holding a sign to the window saying \"HE'S MAD\". When Erica asks Sarah if she knows how she got the bruises or what is wrong, Sarah shows Erica the toy figure on her shelf that had belonged to David (it had fallen on the street, which was why he ran back and got struck by the car that killed him). Erica, surprised to find it there, throws it in the bin to which Sarah says \"You shouldn't have done that!\". Erica looks up 'Hanting', reading that the host's life force is drained by the Hant and the host then slips into a coma and dies. Erica rushes to the school for Sarah but finds out that Heather impersonated her and picked Sarah up earlier. Erica eventually finds Sarah and Heather with another colleague of Heather's who is a hypnotist. They are talking to Sarah, but calling her David, who is repeatedly shouting \"I want to be born now, I want to be born NOW!\". Sarah suddenly attacks Erica, lunge/pounce/flying at her neck, screaming \"You are not my mother. You bitch!\". Once they manage to pry Sarah off her, and the hypnotist calls Sarah back into her body, Heather explains that she only wanted to talk to David (and that Erica would do the same in her shoes) but Erica punches her and storms out with Sarah.\nErica calls Rosie back after seeing the increasing strong bruises on Sarah's neck and now back. Rosie explains that David is hanging on to Sarah, buying time while waiting for Erica's baby to be born so that he can take its body and be reborn. They get rid of everything that belonged to David. Erica finds the dollhouse down in the basement and Rosie says that it is no wonder David has been so strong; he had been given an invite and a place/home of his own to live in, that the dollhouse was a \"spirit-house\". Erica burns down the dollhouse and Sarah throws the last picture she has of David into the flames, finally accepting the death of her friend. That night, Erica realizes they hadn't burned everything of David's; the toy she had thrown away is still in Sarah's room. She and Edgar hurry to Sarah and find her on the top story window ledge. Sarah says that David tells her it won't hurt, then jumps off the roof crashing to the floor below. She is rushed to hospital and the doctor explains that she suffered severe head trauma and is in a coma. Erica senses her sisters distress and visits them at the hospital. She decides that they should give David what he wants in order to save Sarah. Heather injects Erica with a medication that will induce the birth of the baby. Erica gives birth to a baby girl, much to everyone's surprise. But then starts having more contractions; after an emergency C-section, Erica has a healthy second baby \u2013 a boy. At the same moment the boy starts to cry, Sarah opens her eyes, showing that David has let go of her. Heather takes the boy in her arms and looks at him lovingly.\nOne year later, at their Halloween party, the family seems to be happy and Sarah is in good health. Erica has finally published her new book about twin studies. A red devils mask creeps up to baby boy Jack's crib \u2013 as the mask is removed, the audience sees it's Sarah. She says: \"Hello David.

Later that night, Toby's gang goes to a party at Eric's house, and Allison's relationship with Toby as well as her other friends Emily and Sam is further revealed. At the end of the party, Allison performs a blowjob on her boyfriend.\nThe next day, Allison meets with her father, Stuart, at work to discuss family problems, the awkward conversation revealing the virtually non-existent relationship Allison has with her parents. Afterwards, she and her friends drive downtown into East LA, intent on buying marijuana, eventually encountering Mexican drug dealer Hector and his crew. Toby and Hector make a deal, but Toby believes that Hector did not sell him enough for what he paid, and attempts to confront Hector, who pulls a gun on him, humiliating him in front of his friends. Allison persuades Hector to leave Toby alone.\nThe next night, Allison and her girlfriends return to the location of the drug deal. There, she and her friends once again meet up with Hector and his crew, who invite them to a party at his house.

His guided tour abruptly ends when the police arrive in force, ostensibly on a drug bust. Allison winds up being arrested with the other present gang members, but \u2013 save for an argument with her parents and Toby \u2013 is let off the hook. The experience only serves to increase Allison's fascination with the inner-city lifestyle. The night after her release, Allison and Emily agree to head downtown the next evening to hang out with Hector's crew.\nThe two meet up with Hector and his gang at a motel, and a night of partying and drinking results in Allison and Emily asking Hector if they can join his crew. Hector informs them of their initiation; to join the gang, the two must roll a dice; the number they roll corresponds to the number of gang members they must have sex with.\nAllison rolls a one, Emily rolls a three. Hector and Allison pair off, but Allison has second thoughts and refuses to have sex with him, and is thrown out of the room by the gang when she tries to get Emily to leave with her. Emily eagerly engages in sex with Hector, but as she does so, one of Hector's fellow gang members anally rapes her. When Allison storms the room and screams at the men to stop, they flee the room, leaving the two distraught women.\nThe next day, Allison returns to the motel and confronts Hector over the previous night, but he responds by saying he didn't do anything wrong; that he only did what she and Emily had asked him to do. At that moment, a woman shows up at the door, surprising Allison, much to the amusement of Hector, who mocks Allison for thinking he had feelings for her, and calling her a poser who only knows how to play games and nothing about the realities of gang life.\nThe same day Emily is shown at a police station accusing Hector and his crew of gang rape. Allison is brought in for questioning, but claims to know nothing about a rape. Hector is subsequently arrested, and members of his crew vow to seek out and silence Allison and Emily, but wind up getting lost in Bel-Air. Meanwhile, Toby and his gang are shown posing with guns in front of Eric and his video camera, making clear on their intent to seek revenge on Hector's crew.

The warhead was secretly jointly-designed, but international pressure has forced North and South Korea to hand over the device and close the facility.  North Korean officer Major Kang Min-gil (Kim Seung-woo), displeased with the conciliation of the Koreas, steals the warhead with the help of several of his loyal soldiers. The leaders of both sides dispatch a South Korean special forces platoon under the leadership of Major Park Jung-woo (Hwang Jung-min).\nThe platoon intercepts the rebellious Kang and his squad by boat and begin a firefight. However, in the middle of the conflict, a comet travels dangerously close to Earth - and this causes a \"time rift\" linking the present with other points in the comet's 433-year cycle of close approaches to the Earth. Three modern Korean men from each side (and one female scientist, Dr. Kim Su-yeon (Gong Hyo-jin), kidnapped along with the warhead) unintentionally find themselves time traveling back from 2005 to 1572, and wind up in the middle of a skirmish between Joseon-era Koreans and Jurchen invaders.  After some confusion, a grenade blast routs the Jurchens, and the soldiers immediately wind up with the nickname \"Heavenly Soldiers\" due to their 'magical' abilities.\nThe modern Koreans also meet with a regional foreigner who turns out to be none other than the young version of Yi Sun-sin (Park Joong-hoon), the legendary admiral who later becomes instrumental in the defeat of the later Japanese invasion. However, this \"General\" Yi acts like nothing like either of the modern Korean histories illustrate him: he is a petty thief and ginseng smuggler who just failed his military Gwageo exam, and seeing no future for himself, has turned to crime in order to survive. Yi also stole and hid the group's small arms shortly after their arrival. Unfortunately, a little peasant girl caught him burying the weapons and later retrieves one of the handguns, whereupon she is caught by two Jurchen spies sent to look for the \"Heavenly Soldiers\".\nWith nothing better to do other than try to fix history, Major Park attempts to train Yi in the military skills he was so known for, while Major Kang and his men search the area for the nuclear device, which has gone missing during their transit. Not understanding their motivations, Yi is highly resistant to the modern Koreans' attempt to change his lowly lifestyle until he ends up captured by the Jurchens, who are aware of his association with the \"Heavenly Soldiers\" and attempt to make him lead them to the Koreans by killing the peasant girl. The North Koreans stumble upon Yi and free him, and also find the warhead in the tent of one of the war leaders. However, Kang is forced to kill the son of a war leader sleeping in the same tent, and in retaliation the Jurchens initiate movement to violently root out the modern Koreans.\nWith the warhead back in their possession, and the timing and location of the comet's overhead passing accurately calculated by Dr. Kim, the \"Heavenly Soldiers\" prepare to leave the past as it currently stands. Yi, incensed by the barbarians' cruelty, returns to the modern Koreans with their weapons and the elders of the girl's village, who plead with the \"Heavenly Soldiers\" to help them, and the modern Koreans relent. When Majors Park and Kang debate over the strategy that would work best for the villagers, Yi, beginning to find his legendary tactical competence, successfully argues for a combination of ambushes and a last stand.\nThat night, before the arrival of the Jurchens, the modern Koreans prepare to leave the past, as the comet would unexpectedly perigee later the next day. When Park advises Yi to save his life as well, Yi protests but is knocked out and carried off. Kang, who knows he will be hunted down as soon as he returns to the present, elects to go back to the village to help defend it from the Jurchens; the other modern Koreans stay behind for their own reasons as well.

Soon the white settlers realize that they are not alone: a group of descendants of runaway slaves live in the area, in a settlement\u2014generally known as a quilombo\u2014they call \"The Island\" because it is the only permanently fertile spot in a sea of sand where it rains only during the rainy season. Due to the madness of Vasco, Maria seeks to bribe the black settlers to take her and her daughter away, but they, while taking her money (it is basically useless in the local barter economy), do no such thing.\nHowever, soon enough Vasco's workers abandon the farm. Vasco, enraged over this betrayal, dies when he accidentally buries himself under a heap of construction material for the half-finished house.

Although Keller is suspicious of Silvia's backstory, the two grow close, in part because of their shared grief, and Keller ends up protecting her from attacks on her person.\nPhilippe calls Silvia to meet and informs her of Xola's death, but, unable to bear her grief, lies and says he doesn't know what happened to Simon. Silvia attempts to obtain information by way of Kuman-Kuman, an exiled Matoban minister living in New York, only to almost be killed in a bus bombing perpetrated by Gabonese national Jean Gamba, Nils Lud's right-hand man, and part of the opening scene's coterie.\nPhilippe is later found dead in his hotel room, and Silvia finds out that her brother was killed along with Ajene Xola. She narrowly avoids an assassination attempt by Gamba (whom Keller kills) and leaves a voicemail on Keller's phone saying she's going back home. Keller takes this to mean she's returning to Matobo, and dispatches an agent to intercept her at John F. Kennedy International Airport.\nThe purported assassin is discovered and shot to death while Zuwanie is in the middle of his address to the General Assembly, and security personnel rush Zuwanie to a safe room for his protection. Silvia, anticipating this, has been hiding in the safe room, and confronts Zuwanie and intends to kill him herself. Keller determines that the assassination plot is a false flag operation created by Zuwanie to gain credibility that his rivals are terrorists and to deter potential supporters of his removal. Keller realizes that Silvia returning home means going to the UN, and rushes to the safe room, just in time to prevent her from murdering Zuwanie. Zuwanie is indicted, and Silvia reconciles with Keller before leaving for Matobo.", "tmdb_plot": "After Silvia Broome, an interpreter at United Nations headquarters, overhears plans of an assassination, an American Secret Service agent is sent to investigate.", "tmdb_id": "179", "wiki_id": "1643419"}, {"title": "Into a Dream", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "The movie focuses on the misadventures of low-profile theater troupe actor Mutsugoro Suzuki who begins a surreal journey back to his hometown, marked by his quest to find the person responsible for infecting him with a sexually transmitted disease.

While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie, and her alcoholic mother in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman.\nThe scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman's gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution.\nStarks is placed in the care of Dr. Thomas Becker, a psychiatrist, and his staff. In December 1992, Starks is forced to undergo an unauthorized treatment designed by Becker: he is injected with experimental drugs, bound in a straitjacket and then placed inside a morgue drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie at a roadside diner where she works. He suspects this happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. She does not recognise him but seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and confronts her. Jackie, frightened, tells him that Jack Starks died on New Year's Day in 1993, and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning Jackie's trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life.\nEarly on 1 January 1993, knowing that his time is quickly running out, Starks is briefly taken out of the hospital by Dr. Beth Lorenson, who he has finally convinced of his time travel experiences and his knowledge of future events. She drives Starks to the childhood home of Jackie and her mother, where he gives the mother a letter he has written, which outlines Jackie's bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a lit cigarette in her hand and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks experiences a flashback to the head wound he suffered in Iraq, simultaneously slipping on the ice and hits his head. Bleeding profusely, he convinces two of the more sympathetic doctors to put him into the jacket one last time.\nStarks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter to Jackie's mother has made all the difference.

Claiming that he joined the military because he \"got lost on the way to college\", Swofford finds his time at Camp Pendleton difficult, and struggles to make friends. While Swofford feigns illness to avoid his responsibilities, a \"lifer\", Staff Sergeant Sykes, takes note of his potential and offers Swofford an opportunity to attend his Scout Sniper course.\nAfter gruelling training, the Scout Sniper course is left with eight candidates, among them Swofford, now a sniper, and Swofford's roommate Corporal Alan Troy who becomes his spotter. When Kuwait is invaded by Iraq, Swofford's unit is deployed to the Arabian Peninsula as a part of \"Operation Desert Shield\" in the Gulf War (1990\u20131991). Eager for combat, the Marines find themselves bored with remedial training, constant drills, and a routine monotony that feeds their boredom, and prompts them to talk about the unfaithful girlfriends and wives waiting for them at home. They even erect a bulletin board featuring photographs and brief notes telling what perfidies the women had committed (known in military slang as a \"Jodie Wall\").\nSwofford obtains unauthorized alcohol and organizes an impromptu Christmas party, arranging for Fergus to cover his watch so he can celebrate. Fergus accidentally sets fire to a tent while cooking some sausages and ignites a crate of flares, waking the whole camp and enraging Staff Sergeant Sykes, who demotes Swofford from lance corporal to private and puts him on \"shit-burning\" detail. The punishments, combined with the heat, the boredom, and Swofford's suspicions of his girlfriend's infidelity, give Swofford a mental breakdown, to the point where he threatens Fergus with a rifle, then orders Fergus to shoot him instead.\nLater, Operation Desert Storm begins and the Marines are sent to the Saudi Arabian\u2013Kuwait border. Swofford learns from Sykes that Troy concealed his criminal record when enlisting and will be discharged when the unit returns home. Troy becomes distant from his friends. Knowing that Troy will not be allowed to reenlist, the Marines attack him with a red-hot USMC branding iron, marking him as one of their own. Following an accidental air attack from friendly forces, the Marines advance through the desert, facing no enemies on the ground. The Marines march through the infamous \"Highway of Death\" (on the northbound road leading back to Iraq from capital Kuwait City), strewn with the burnt vehicles and charred bodies of retreating Iraqi soldiers, the aftermath of a bombing campaign. The Marines later catch sight of distant burning Kuwaiti oil wells, ignited only moments before by retreating Iraqis, and they attempt to dig sleeping holes as a rain of crude oil falls from the sky. Before they can finish, Sykes orders the squad to move upwind.\nNear the end of the war, Swofford and Troy are finally given a sniping mission. Lieutenant Colonel Kazinski, their battalion commander, orders them to kill at least one of two high-ranking Iraqi Republican Guard officers at a nearby airfield. At the last second before Swofford takes the shot, Major Lincoln interrupts them to call in an air strike. Troy desperately pleads to make a kill, but is denied and overruled as the airplanes destroy the Iraqi airfield, much to his and Swofford's disappointment. The war ends without Swofford ever firing his rifle. During a monologue, Swofford realizes that all of his training and effort to achieve the elite status as a marine sniper is meaningless in modern warfare.\nAfter returning home the Marines parade through a town in a jovial celebration of victory. Swofford returns home to his family and girlfriend but discovers she has a new boyfriend. Fowler is seen with a prostitute in a bar, now as a Corporal, Kruger in a corporate boardroom, Escobar as a supermarket employee, Cortez as a father of three children, and Sykes continuing his service as a first sergeant in the Iraq War.

Following Sprink's lead Audebert, Horstmayer, and Gordon meet in no-man's-land and agree on a cease-fire for the evening.\nThe various soldiers meet and wish each other \"Joyeux No\u00ebl\", \"Frohe Weihnachten\", and \"Merry Christmas\". They exchange chocolate, champagne, and photographs of loved ones. Horstmayer gives Audebert back his wallet containing a photograph of his wife, which was lost in the attack a few days prior, and they connect over pre-war memories. Father Palmer celebrates a brief Mass for the soldiers (in Latin as was the practice in the Catholic Church at that time), and the soldiers retire deeply moved. However, Jonathan remains totally unmoved by the events around him, choosing to grieve for his brother. The following morning, the Lieutenants agree to extend the truce to allow each side to bury their dead, followed by cordial fraternisation for the rest of the day. As their soldiers play football, Audebert and Horstmayer sympathise, speaking in French of their memories of Paris and Lens, and their families. Horstmayer offers to take a letter to Lens for Audebert's wife. The next day, as the German forces shell the Allied position, Horstmayer offers to shelter the French and British soldiers in his trench, an offer Audebert and Gordon return to protect the Germans from their own retaliatory bombing. Before parting, aware that the truce has now truly ended, Audebert and Horstmayer lament that they cannot be friends, and hope that they both survive the war. As Audebert compliments Horstmayer on his French, the German reveals that his wife is French.\nPrior to the bombing, Horstmayer learns that Anna and Sprink left without the German superior's assent to entertain fellow front soldiers and informs both that Sprink is going to be arrested for disobedience. As the Germans regain their trenches, Anna and Sprink remain behind and ask Audebert to take them as captives, in order to avoid separation. Letters that they hand over to him from the German soldiers (who had been hoping Anna would deliver them when she returned to Berlin), as well as letters from soldiers all across the front, are intercepted by military authorities, revealing that the truce had occurred.\nFather Palmer is being sent back to his own parish and his battalion is disbanded as a mark of shame. Despite emphasising the humanity and goodwill of the truce, he is rebuked by the bishop, who then preaches an anti-German sermon to new recruits, in which he describes the Germans as inhumane and commands the recruits to kill every one of them. Father Palmer overhears the sermon and removes his cross as he leaves.\nBack in the trenches, the British are ordered by a furious major (who is angered by the truce) to shoot a German soldier who is entering no-man's-land and crossing towards French lines. All of the soldiers deliberately miss in response, except the bitter Jonathan, who shoots the targeted German soldier. Audebert, hearing the familiar alarm clock ringing outside, rushes out and discovers that the soldier is a disguised Ponchel, his batman. With his dying words, Ponchel reveals he gained help from the German soldiers, visited his mother, and had coffee with her. He also informs Audebert that he has a young son named Henri.\nAudebert is punished by being sent to Verdun, and he receives a dressing down from his father, a general. In a culminating rant, young Audebert upbraids his father, expressing no remorse at the fraternisation at the front, and his disgust for civilians and superiors who talk of sacrifice but know nothing of the struggle in the trenches. He also informs the general about his new grandson Henri. Moved by this revelation, the general then recommends they \"both try and survive this war for him\".\nHorstmayer and his troops, who are confined in a train, are informed by the German Crown Prince that they are to be shipped to the Eastern Front, without permission to see their families as they pass through Germany. He then stomps on J\u00f6rg's harmonica and says that Horstmayer does not deserve his Iron Cross.

After they reach their destination the next morning, the duo halt at a petrol pump in Chembur situated on the Mumbai-Pune Highway. While there, Abhijeet and Harshavardhan get their car tyres filled with air by a mechanic named Prabhudeva a.k.a. Tambi (Samir Choughule), and also jokingly converse with a dance artist named Saraswatibai Jagaonkar (Nirmiti Sawant) whose dance troupe has halted at the petrol pump as well for their bus repair work. \nWhile Harshavardhan is getting petrol filled in their car by the petrol pump employee named Pandurang Kute, Abhijeet decides to go to buy snacks from a store located in the vicinity. The irritated store owner named Sawant (Girish Joshi) is woken up from his sleep by Abhijeet, who manages to persuade him to let him buy snacks from the store. While buying snacks, Abhijeet quickly shoplifts a music CD to teach Sawant a lesson for his rude behaviour. The duo depart the petrol pump. \nSoon after, Abhijeet and Harshavardhan are apprehended by the Mumbai police at a nearby checkpoint for unknown reasons. They initially believe that they have been arrested for shoplifting the CD from Sawant's store and confess their crime before the police. After being taken to the police station, the duo are shocked to learn that they have been accused of robbing Pandurang Kute and stabbing him fatally with a gupti (a weapon which looks like a swordstick) inside the petrol pump premises. \nBeing lost in a strange city with no contacts, Abhijeet helplessly contacts his ingenuous mother named Shaku (Amita Khopkar) from the police station in his village to explain their position and asks her to somehow free them from this matter. Shaku informs Abhijeet that his uncle named Advocate Keshav Kunthalgirikar (Makarand Anaspure) is an inexperienced but dubiously credentialed lawyer in their family. Keshav, who has been communicated by Shaku, arrives in Mumbai and visits Abhijeet and Harshavardhan in prison, advising them to be truthful about their involvement in the murder. \nBeing totally new to the practice of law, Keshav embarrasses himself before the prosecution counsel named Advocate Phadnavis (Sachin Khedekar) and the judge named Prabhune (Mohan Agashe) in the first hearing of the trial. Due to his disrespect and failure to follow court etiquette, Prabhune punishes him for contempt of court and sentences Keshav to imprisonment for two days. In prison, Keshav meets a serial gambler named Bhai (Sanjay Mone) and his gang who make fun of him and bully him.\nHowever, Keshav's girlfriend named Neha (Sharvari Jamenis) comes to visit him in Mumbai and bails him out. In the next hearing, Keshav argues that the only evidence against Abhijeet and Harshavardhan is circumstantial, which Phadnavis counters by arguing that the available evidence is strong enough to convict them. Later, it is shown that Harshavardhan's father named Suryakant Ghodke (Arun Nalawade), who is a renowned politician, learns about the duo's arrest and decides to arrange for a more experienced lawyer rather than the novice Keshav.\nA public defender named Advocate G.B. Godbole (Pushkar Shrotri) is arranged by Suryakant, but he stutters and stammers constantly and has great difficulty in forming cohesive sentences, leading to a lot of amusement in the court. Suryakant is, however, tremendously impressed with the novice Keshav's advocacy skills and decides to retain him, thus firing Godbole. In the following hearing, the prosecution examines Saraswatibai and Tambi as they both were witnesses at the petrol pump where the murder took place. \nNevertheless, Keshav's cross-examination with Tambi and Saraswatibai establishes that the possibility of another red-coloured Scorpio car being present at the petrol pump during the time of the murder cannot be ruled out, thus creating reasonable doubt. Further, the prosecution examines Sawant who is still irritated about the fact that Abhijeet disturbed his sleep and vociferously states that the murderer could have not been anyone else but the accused Abhijeet and Harshavardhan. \nHowever, Keshav cross-examines Sawant and comes to a conclusion that his attention was diverted from the petrol pump around the time of the murder, and thus he cannot deny another red-coloured Scorpio car having switched places with the one of Abhijeet and Harshavardhan. In the next hearing, the prosecution examines the investigating officer named Inspector P.J. Ambildhake (Ganesh Yadav), where Keshav even discusses the probability of the police manipulating evidence to trap Abhijeet and Harshavardhan, which further weakens the prosecution case. \nAt the end of the hearing, Phadnavis, seemingly impressed with the novice Keshav's advocacy skills, invites him to his farmhouse for a drink that night. During their meeting, Phadnavis carefully teases Keshav around his law school days, his graduation, and his initial days as a lawyer, which Keshav hesitantly answers. He then gets into a debate with Phadnavis about how law and advocacy is more important than just earning money and manipulating the legal system to win cases. This irks Phadnavis who has a record of not losing a single case and angrily orders Keshav to leave, swearing that he will destroy his case in the next hearing.\nIn the final hearing, Keshav concludes his arguments and has seemingly succeeded in convincing Prabhune of Abhijeet and Harshavardhan's innocence. However, Phadnavis twists the tale and asks for permission from Prabhune to examine \"Keshav\" as a witness, much to everyone's puzzlement. Phadnavis asks Keshav under oath about his shaky professional history and eventually, it is revealed that Keshav never passed the bar or obtained a license to practice law. On this ground, Phadnavis applies for a re-trial of the case before Prabhune with a qualified lawyer to represent Abhijeet and Harshavardhan.\nKeshav admits his mistake before Prabhune. He then goes on to make an emotional speech about how the law was meant to uphold justice and serve the needy and instead, laments that it has become a tool for people like Phadnavis to exploit technical loopholes in the procedure to strongarm cases in their favour, at the expense of the poor and needy who end up with nothing in their hands. As regards the case, Keshav creates more reasonable doubt by explaining that the angle of the wounds found on Pandurang Kute's body strongly indicates that the murderer should have been a left-hander and points out that both Abhijeet and Harshavardhan are right-handers.\nActing upon Saraswatibai's information, the police find out after some investigation that some criminals with a red-coloured Scorpio car in Pune were arrested for a bank robbery few days ago, and that they are presumably related to Pandurang Kute's murder as well. Prabhune, on the basis of reasonable doubt, announces a verdict of not guilty to Abhijeet and Harshavardhan, much to the relief of them and Keshav. However, given that Keshav has committed a crime by practicing law without a license, Prabhune orders a trial against him for cheating and contempt of court.\nIn the end, Abhijeet and Harshavardhan profusely thank Keshav and apologise to him for what everything cost him.

Making peace with his father, they merge their businesses, realizing there is more to life than winning.\nThe film ends with an adapted version of the \"He's Got Balls\" commercial originally produced by Buck.

Charlie is intrigued when he sees that drag queens' high heels snap easily, and wishes to create high heels that can support a greater range of foot sizes and body types. Back in Northampton, while in the process of laying off workers, one employee, Lauren, gives Charlie the idea of looking for a niche market product to save the business. Charlie then recruits Lauren to assist him in designing a high-heeled boot for drag performers.\nWhen their initial designs are met with scorn by Lola, Charlie and Lauren bring her on as a consultant. The road is initially bumpy: many of the male employees are uncomfortable with Lola's presence and the new direction, and Charlie's relationship with his fianc\u00e9e, Nicola, begins to deteriorate as she encourages him to sell the factory building to a developer. Although things improve when Lola tones down her personality and starts making friends, matters take a turn for the worse when Charlie is invited to showcase the new boots in Milan; the strain he puts on his employees causes most of them, including Lola, to walk out.\nCharlie's fianc\u00e9e arrives at the factory, furious that he took out a second mortgage on their house to save the company. Nicola insists that he sell the company, but Charlie is determined to save it and the jobs of his employees. The argument (which ends with Nicola leaving Charlie) is broadcast on the factory's PA system, which is overheard by Lauren and Lola's bitterest opponent at the factory, Don, a chauvinistic male worker. Don turns over a new leaf after Lola had graciously allowed him to win an arm wrestling match, and rallies the factory workers to make the boots in time for Charlie and Lauren to get to Milan. When Charlie catches Nicola with another man, he angrily takes out his frustrations on Lola, causing Lola to quit. After arriving in Milan with no one to model the boots, Charlie is forced to go onstage and model the boots himself. After he trips and ultimately falls flat on his face, Lola and her posse of drag queens arrive, put on a spectacular runway show, and save the day.\nIn the film's denouement, Lola headlines her own show and sings a song in honour of the \"kinky boots factory\" of Northampton.

Tanvi has treated a female patient who wears no. 36; her process of doing so has always been caring and gentle, rebelling against Khurana's inhumane ways of dealing with mentally ill patients. As she gets discharged, Tanvi doesn't get acknowledged for her efforts, which devastate her and since then, she has become embittered and vows to never come close to any patient, especially no. 36.\nA young man, Anand Rai Singhania , is brought to the mental sanatorium by a court order. His elder brother requests the doctors to admit him immediately. However, they insist on evaluating his mental condition before taking any decision. On being asked a few questions, Anand Rai Singhania does not show any signs of insanity, and the doctors conclude that there is nothing wrong with him. Just then, Anand spots a housefly on the table. He tries to capture it but it evades him. While Anand's brother insists with the doctors, Anand suddenly becomes very violent, picking up a club and using it to hit everything the fly lands on. This convinces the doctors that he is indeed insane, and they finally admit him.\nAnand tries to make friends with other patients in the sanatorium. Sunil develops a caring bond with Anand, as it is revealed that Sunil was made a doctor by Anand's father. Anand makes a commotion almost every day and acts childish which upsets Tanvi and she demands that Anand is thrown out from the asylum.\nSunil finds Anand's diary and gives it to Tanvi, who finds out about Anand's sad past after reading his diary. Anand was a musician in college who was deeply in love with Maya, a young, vivacious nun in Romania. Maya, who was apprised of his feelings, however, did not reciprocate her love towards Anand, leaving him conflicted. To get her to respond, Anand threatened to commit suicide on the rooftop of the church by pretending to set fire on himself one day, resulting in Maya attempting to stop him and therefore ending up confessing her love towards him. Anand was delighted with the turn of events and having been contented with his lady love, planned to marry her. Maya turned out to be roguish and enjoyed her time with Anand, which she eventually got used to by throwing a series of pranks on Anand, such as pretending to have trouble riding a horse and nearly getting in an accident, only to later reveal that she can perfectly ride a horse after Anand got worried or when she was insisted by Anand to drive a car and she revealed she can't drive and rushing it across a populated street and nearly crashing it into the road when he persisted her to try, only to reveal later that she knew how to drive perfectly and was simply messing with him. Anand plotted to get back at her playfully and pranked her back by throwing her into a swimming pool, to which she heavily resisted, and warned Anand explaining that she cannot swim but Anand refused to believe her thinking it's just another one of her elaborate pranks and left her in the water, but it turned out she wasn't lying and indeed couldn't swim. As a result, Anand came back to see that Maya had drowned; his life was completely shattered. He became traumatized, blaming himself for Maya's death.\nAfter finding out this secret, Tanvi feels guilty for her treatment towards Anand and apologizes to him. They become good friends, spend time together, and she and Sunil work together to cure Anand and make him remember his past. This works, and Anand completely gets over the trauma of Maya's death and is finally cured. He decides to leave the asylum but stays when Tanvi expresses her love to him.

But fate plays a part in the story; Tanvi has already fallen in love with Anand but is engaged to Karan, under her father, Khurana's approval.\nWhen Khurana finds out about Tanvi and Anand, he is livid as he sees this as a doctor-patient relationship, not a genuine relationship from a father's point of view. He demands Tanvi to leave him but she refuses to back down. When Karan finds out, he tells Tanvi to go with Anand. Sunil tries to make Khurana see that mental asylum patients should be treated with love, care, and affection, but Khurana stubbornly believes that patients should be treated with oppression and brutality. Anand rebels against the strict hospital regime and Khurana's disapproval of Tanvi and Anand, but he refuses to back down. This makes Anand explode into a violent rage against Khurana, which results in Khurana lobotomizing him. Seeing no way out, Sunil and Tanvi arrive at the asylum to smuggle Anand out so that he and Tanvi can run away together, but it is too late when Sunil finds out about Anand's lobotomy.

However, she became an inspirational model for prisoner reform during her incarceration, and her apparent spiritual transformation earned her an early release. Free, she is now intent on revenge.\nGeum-ja quickly shows that her \"kind-hearted\" behavior in prison was a cover to earn favor and further her revenge plans. She visits the other paroled inmates, calling in favors that include food, shelter, and weapons.

The detective on her case was aware of her innocence, but helped her fake crime-scene details to ensure her confession looked credible. As a young high school student, Geum-ja had become pregnant and, afraid to go home to her parents, turned to Mr. Baek (Choi Min-sik), a teacher from her school, for help. Mr. Baek expected Geum-ja to provide sex and assist in his kidnapping racket in return. He used her to lure 5-year-old Won-mo to him, with the intent of ransoming the child, but murdered the boy. He then kidnapped Geum-ja's infant daughter and threatened to murder the baby if Geum-ja did not take the blame.

These \"treesweets\" are viewed as a delicacy by the dinosaurs of the valley and everyone wants their fair share of it. However, because of the tastiness of the tree sweets, and due to the fact that there seems to only be one such tree in the entire valley, there is hardly enough for every dinosaur. Because of this, none of them may eat the treesweets until the day when they reach the \"peak of their tastiness.\" Littlefoot and his friends Ducky, Petrie and Spike wait to eat the first treesweets of the season. Ducky is about to take one, but Littlefoot quickly tells her to stop, reminding them that they may not take any treesweets until \"Nibbling Day\". This, however, does not stop Petrie from flying to the tree's crown to attempt to take a treesweet, until Cera's father, emerges and states clearly how every dinosaur in the valley has waited all year to taste the treesweets. As Cera appears before them, she boastfully reminds the group that she is the one who is supposed to eat the first treesweet, having been the one who found the treesweet-tree in the first place, although it was Littlefoot who first found it. Cera also teases Littlefoot for being too little to reach the treesweets, offending him.\nMeanwhile, Mr. Threehorn is visited by an old friend, a pink female threehorn named Tria. Topps, whom Tria calls Topsy, promises Tria the first treesweet of the season, and Cera becomes jealous. Cera refuses to make friends with Tria and dismisses her. In addition, Cera becomes violent toward her friends when they make any references involving Tria or her father's nickname. Littlefoot wanders off by himself and sulks about how \"little\" he is. When he returns to the treesweet tree, he climbs the cliff next to it and tries to prove that he can reach the treesweets himself. As he does, he accidentally slips off the cliff, falls right through the tree, and knocks down every single treesweet. Realizing the trouble that he is now in, poor Littlefoot faints in dismay. When he wakes up, he finds himself surrounded by several miniature longnecks (known by their group as tinysauruses). They have eaten all the treesweets and quickly run away once the shocked Littlefoot starts screaming in fear.\nUpon noticing that every treesweet is gone, the other dinosaurs suspect that Littlefoot is responsible. Afraid to admit that he made the treesweets fall off the tree under Topps' threat of being banished from the valley, Littlefoot makes a parish truth and blames nearly everything that had happened on the tinysauruses. At first, everyone laughs at him in disbelief, but when they find teeth-marks on an eaten treesweet that are too small for Littlefoot to have made, he is believed and everyone begins to look for the tinysauruses, thinking of them as pests and preparing to drive them out of the valley. As Littlefoot and Cera search the valley, Littlefoot falls down a pothole in the ground where the tinysauruses are hiding. At first, Littlefoot is afraid of them and flees deeper into the cave, but he soon finds them to be nice and befriends them. Upon hearing how difficult it is for the tinysauruses to find food, Littlefoot promises to help bring them as much food as he can every night.\nLittlefoot's friends find him while he is bringing food to the tinysauruses. They also fall in the pothole, and upon meeting the tiny dinosaurs agree not to tell the adults. Even Cera, who is still angry with her father, promises to keep it a secret, mainly because she finds out she can relate to them more than they would have imagined. Many of the tinysauruses, including Lizzie, in the colony feel that their leader, Big Daddy, bosses them around too much, though he is only looking out for them. To Big Daddy, the larger dinosaurs of the Great Valley only seem to think that \"because they're bigger, it makes them seem more important,\" and he does not trust the other dinosaurs. By morning, Cera finally decides to be friends with Tria.\nWhen sneaking off to see the tinysauruses the following night, Littlefoot and his friends are discovered by Topps. When he tries to ask them where they are going this time of night, Cera angrily throws the question back at him. He tells the children that he is on guard duty it is the tinysauruses which they have to worry about, then warns them to not let him catch them out late at night again, and sends them home. Afterwards, he meets up with Tria and they spot two of the tinysauruses, Lizzie and Skitter. A chase ensues that ends when Topps and Tria, who tries to stop Topps, finds the tinysaurus colony. Topps gathers the other adults to let them know that he has found the little creatures. As the grown-ups prepare to block the caverns, Littlefoot, realizing what he must do, stops them and admits the full truth that he unintentionally caused the treesweets to fall from the tree first. However, just as he is finished admitting his accident with the adults softly forgiving him and finally leaving the little creatures alone, the tinysauruses' cave collapses, seemingly trapping them inside.\nThe tinysauruses escape into the Mysterious Beyond, where they encounter a pair of Utahraptors who chase them back into the Great Valley. Upon hearing that Littlefoot initially blamed everything on the tinysauruses, Littlefoot's friends become upset and do not want to talk with him. Angry at his friends' rejection, Littlefoot leaves and decides to set things right on his own. Meanwhile, Cera apologizes to Tria about her father being hard on her when she tried to stop him from hunting the little creatures down. After a tragic mistake, Petrie, Ducky, and Spike feel remorseful for what they have done and begin to sob over the loss of their friend. With Cera's help, they all try to find Littlefoot and apologize for being hard on him; but they mistake the sharpteeth for Littlefoot, and the two carnivores chase them through the Great Valley. Just as Ducky is about to be eaten, Littlefoot shows up and saves her, Topps and Tria also appear. When all seems lost, the tinysauruses come to the children's aid and fight the carnivores. The grown-ups of the valley eventually reach the group and drive the sharpteeth back into the Mysterious Beyond through the same hole, which they cover up with a large boulder to prevent them from coming back.\nAfter everything is sorted out and friendships are repaired, the tinysauruses become residents of the valley.

One such sanctuary is concentrated within the triangular peninsula of downtown Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, which contains a feudal-like government. Bordered on two sides by rivers and barricaded on the third with an electrified fence guarded by a militia, the city has become a haven in which its citizens live in relative security. Outside the city's barriers is a no-man's-land of barren countryside and dilapidated suburban towns long deserted by living humans but overrun with legions of the dead. The rich and powerful live in a luxury high-rise called Fiddler's Green, while the rest of the population subsists in squalor. All forms of commerce within this protected zone are controlled by Paul Kaufman, the city's ruthless plutocratic ruler. He has sponsored Dead Reckoning, an armored personnel vehicle that can travel through the zombie-infested areas with ease.\nRiley Denbo is the designer and commander of Dead Reckoning. Unlike Kaufman, Riley is respected for his work in protecting the citizens, as well as providing them with food and medical supplies that the citizens can no longer safely acquire themselves. Using Dead Reckoning, Riley and his crew venture into areas overrun with zombies to scavenge for necessary supplies. They also retrieve luxury items such as designer clothing and top shelf brands of liquor as these things offer a powerful means of barter within Kaufman's oppressive oligarchic regime. On one mission, they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior. This is especially seen in one such zombie, \"Big Daddy\", formerly a gas station attendant. During the mission, rookie Mike is bitten by a zombie and commits suicide before he turns.\nAfter the mission, Riley retires from commanding Dead Reckoning. Grown weary of a hard-scrabble life in a post-apocalyptic city, he plans to leave the urban sanctuary for the open road to Canada once repairs on his car are finished. Back in the city, he visits Chihuahua's bar. There, he sees a prostitute named Slack being forced into a cage with some zombies to entertain guests. Riley and Charlie save Slack; Charlie kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos. Riley, Charlie and Slack are arrested. Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution, for helping a resistance leader named Mulligan to instigate rebellion among the poor.\nMeanwhile, Cholo DeMora, Dead Reckoning's second in command, is denied an apartment in Fiddler's Green despite his dirty service to Kaufman in disposing his political enemies. In retaliation, Cholo takes over Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green with it if Kaufman does not comply with his request of a $5,000,000 ransom. Kaufman approaches Riley and tasks him, as well as Charlie and Slack, to retrieve Dead Reckoning. They are supervised by Manolete, Motown, and Pillsbury.\nOn the way, Manolete is bitten and then killed by Slack. After catching up with Dead Reckoning, Riley approaches the vehicle alone. Charlie, Slack, and Pillsbury follow him after subduing Motown and leaving her behind. Realizing Riley is working for Kaufman, Cholo holds both Riley and Charlie at gunpoint. As he prepares to fire Dead Reckoning's missiles at Fiddler's Green, Riley uses a small device and deactivates Dead Reckoning's weapons systems; he then destroys the device. Motown, who had regained consciousness, opens fire and nearly kills both Riley and Cholo (who is maimed by one of the gunshots). She is bitten by a zombie and killed by Slack. Riley convinces Cholo to allow him to escape North and to join him, but the latter decides to return to Fiddler's Green to deal with Kaufman; his partner Foxy accompanies him. While en route, Cholo is bitten by a zombie and leaves to kill Kaufman by himself as a zombie.

The local police are convinced it is an open-and-shut case because Kelvin's driver's license was found in the glovebox, the plates on the car match Kelvin's, and Kelvin's sister, Isold, lives on the far side of the tunnel.\nHowever, Holt is suspicious because while the body is conveniently unidentifiable, the license is undamaged and Isold, the sole beneficiary of the $1 million policy, is skittish and was not expecting her brother's visit. Isold's husband \"Fred\" McBride (Jeremy Renner), is unexpectedly cheerful and vaguely threatening, convincing Holt there's more to this case. As he investigates the case Holt uncovers leading clues: Frederick McBride is actually dead and buried in a field outside the abandoned McBride home, and the supposedly dead Kelvin has a record as a con man. The most convincing evidence is photos of Kelvin from his criminal record and high school, showing him looking like \"Fred.\" Holt eventually confirms that the charred body pulled from the car wreck is not Kelvin's, that Isold's \"husband\" is actually her brother Kelvin. A flashback reveals that the couple from the convertible seen at the opening of the movie was Isold and Kelvin, wrecking their car\u2014and Kelvin's leg\u2014for insurance money.\nWhen Isold figures out that her brother has murdered an innocent drifter she is horrified, but Kelvin convinces her to participate in this final con and hold hostage his son Thor, whom Isold has been helping to raise since the boy's mother left. When Isold visits the insurance office to collect on Kelvin's policy, Holt\u2014in an echo of the movie's opening scene\u2014informs her that he cannot award her the full $1 million she expects, only the blue book value of his car ($1500).  She leaves angrily. When Holt tells Isold she's lucky he hasn't exposed her as an accessory to murder, she tells him that her brother has taken Thor. Moved and concerned, Holt puts a one-day hold on her check (ensuring that she'll return to the bank the next day) and changes the name of the insured on the policy from \"Kelvin Anderson\" to \"Frederick McBride.\"\nThe next day Isold cashes her check and opens a safety deposit box, in which she puts a childhood picture of her and her brother. She returns to the motel where Kelvin is staying with Thor, and tries to convince him that she has left the rest of the money in the safety deposit box, so that she can leave with Thor. Kelvin doesn't buy it, and gets in his car with Thor\u2014only to find he's held at gunpoint by Holt, in the backseat. Holt tells Isold to leave with the boy and \"Fred\" speeds off, buckling his seatbelt (a sign he intends to crash the car). Kelvin crashes the car, killing both men, and Isold is awarded the full benefits of the tampered life insurance policy.\nThe film ends with Abe walking on a beach meant to suggest heaven, that is identical to the beach featured in the insurance company's commercial shown earlier in the film, as the credits roll.", "tmdb_plot": "Insurance investigator Abraham Holt travels to a tiny town in rural Minnesota to look into a particularly unusual insurance claim stemming from a horrific car accident.

The locusts are contained in an independent glass room, sealed off from the lab by an inner and outer door. Willy refuses to go into the locusts, so Gina does it herself, carrying a ficus tree as food, telling Willy to seal the outer door behind her. Willy asks her if she will put on the protective suit provided but she laughs, stating they are \"grasshoppers, not tarantulas\". Gina unlocks the inner door using the keypad and enters the glass room carrying the ficus tree, without the protective suit. Almost straight away, the locusts begin to swarm upon her, rather than the tree. Gina escapes with the help of Willy, both shaken by what they have witnessed.\nIn Georgetown, Washington D.C., Maddy Rierdon (Lucy Lawless) and her boyfriend Dan Dryer (Dylan Neal) are having a romantic morning together, but it is interrupted by Maddy's phone ringing. Maddy answers to discover it is her assistant, Vivian (Esperanza Catubig), who is ringing, telling her that a lab at the VIA has been red flagged by the Government Accountability Office (GAO). When Vivian tries to investigate using her security contacts, she finds the information is classified, so Maddy requests to meet her outside the VIA in 15 minutes, much to the irritation of Dan, who has taken time from work to spend time with Maddy, who promises they will talk when she returns shortly. Maddy meets with Vivian outside, and discovers the lab in question is being overseen by Dr. Peter Axelrod (John Heard), a former professor to Maddy; she goes inside to meet him. It is revealed Maddy is now Peter's boss at the USDA.\nPeter takes her to Lab C-12, the same lab Gina and Willy fled from the night before. Peter goes into the glass room containing the locusts, and extracts a single insect for himself and Maddy to take a look at, instructing her to put on a gas mask at the same time. Peter puts the insect into a sealed cage, and squirts it with DDT, a pesticide. The insect is only briefly immobilised by the DDT but recovers in mere seconds to continue flying round the cage, shocking Maddy. Peter reveals that they are his creation. They are not just Australian plague locusts, but a hybrid, crossed with the desert locust. Peter further reveals they are resistant to all known pesticides, not just DDT, that they reproduce ten times faster than normal locusts and they live longer. Maddy, horrified, proclaims it a bioweapon and orders the locusts exterminated, reluctantly firing Peter. Scientists with protective suits and flame throwers exterminate all the locusts, save for a handful, which one of the scientists puts into a tube labelled \"biohazard\". Whilst the exterminator clears up, he accidentally drops the jar in the sink, causing several of them to escape down the drain. The exterminator flees before his mistake can be discovered, but as he does so, the escaped locusts can be seen flying away from the building. Maddy returns to Dan several hours later than she said, but Dan has had enough, packing her a suitcase, telling her they are over. Maddy leaves to go on her next mission.\nMeanwhile, at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, the same exterminator brings the remaining insects in a sealed metal case to a waiting officer, who delivers them on a military plane bound for Beale Air Force Base in California. When the case is offloaded onto an army truck, the officer handling it is attacked by an unknown insect, causing him to drop the case on the runway. When the army truck goes around to retrieve it, they accidentally run it over, destroying the box and releasing the remaining four insects into the air.\nOne month later, Maddy discovers she is pregnant and tries to call Dan to talk to him, but he is showing some international delegates around the United Nations Experimental Farm in Virginia, and she is unable to tell him before he is forced to end the call. Meanwhile, a couple camping by the American River in California wake up to discover their tent is saturated with a swarm of sleeping locusts, and they flee. A few hours later, the same swarm descends on the Napa Valley as a large black cloud, causing famers to flee. Coincidentally, Maddy, on the road in California with the USDA Voracious Insect Mobile Research Lab, sees the same swarm flying overhead. She begins to track them.\nIn Leesburg, Virginia, Peter, his wife Terry (Caroline McKinley) and their daughter Sofia (Jenna Hildebrand) are having breakfast. Terry leaves for work, and Peter accompanies Sofia to the bus stop on her way to school, then follows the bus in his car on his way to the gym, before the bus turns off the road to travel towards the school. Peter and Sofia wave to each other. As Peter is heading towards the gym, he hears the buzzes of insects, but cannot see them, so stops by a nearby cornfield, where the swarm of insects suddenly take off into the sky. Peter realises with horror they are his hybrid locusts, and they are heading in the direction of the school bus. The locusts swarm the school bus, attacking the children and knocking them unconscious. Peter drags the unconscious Sofia back to his car, and heads to hospital. Back in Napa Valley, Maddy and her team are on the scene of the earlier swarm's attack on the farm, revealing the locusts have stripped every single bush and tree down to the bark.\nIn Washington D.C., Dan is at his computer at the United Nations Field Office when he the computer beeps with an alert that reads \"locust infestation advisory\". Dan calls Maddy to ask her about it, but she reveals she issued it. They begin to reconcile over their earlier argument but Maddy is called away by the Secretary of Agriculture before they can finish, who asks her what is going on. In the hospital, Sofia is revealed to be comatose, looked after by Peter and Terry. Maddy calls the United States Weather Service in Oklahoma for an update on weather patterns to try to predict the two swarms' next movement. The USWS predicts the Virginia swarm will head towards the city of Pittsburgh in the coming hours but mentions they gave the same information to Peter. Maddy asks Vivian to try to get Peter on the line, a grim expression on her face.\nMeanwhile, in Visalia, California, some 200 miles south east of Napa, a citrus festival is being held, attended by many families. Peter calls Maddy as the latter passes a sign for the festival, revealing they are his locusts that are swarming. Peter tries to help Maddy but she refuses, wanting him as far from the locusts as possible. Maddy realises as she passes the sign for the festival that's where they will strike next. Maddy and her team begin to evacuate the festival in advance of the locusts, but Vivian reveals the swarm is just minutes away, and both the festival and the team are attacked by the swarm. A dropped video camera records the event.\nIn Pittsburgh, a hot dog retailer sets up his stand ready for lunch in the city centre, sunlight glinting on the tall glass buildings of the city. True to the USWS's predictions, the swarm begins to reach the city, their huge black cloud noticed by the workers in the city's many tall buildings. Pandemonium erupts in the streets, as the locusts are shown to be swarming in the streets and entering the office buildings via the air vents. At Pittsburgh International Airport, Air Traffic Control are overseeing the take off of a cargo plane, watched by Peter. Peter tries to get Ruby (Mikki Val), the lead air traffic controller, not to launch planes to the north east, as the locusts are heading from that direction. Ruby does not take him seriously, and the cargo plane runs into the swarm, overloading the engines, causing them to fail. The plane crashes in a fiery explosion just yards from the end of the runway in full view of Ruby, who realises her mistake too late.\nBack at the hospital, Peter and Terry see the news, which broadcasts the video captured earlier at the festival by the dropped camera. Peter explains to Terry that they are his locusts, angering Terry. Before they can talk further, FBI agents arrive and escort Peter to federal custody. Meanwhile, at the Department for Homeland Security, a meeting takes place between Maddy, her boss Secretary Morales (Mike Gomez), General Miller (Gregory Alan Williams), Senator Clauson (Margaret Lawhon), Director Rusk (Mark Costello), and Lorelei Wentworth (Natalija Nogulich) to determine the course of action required. Maddy's former boyfriend Dan is also in attendance as a crop expert. General Miller is not convinced they are a threat, but changes his mind when he sees the evidence, warning Secretary Morales privately he may not have his job much longer and proposing the military use weapons against them. Dan recommends bringing in the harvest early across the country to try and starve the locusts. During the meeting, Director Rusk receives a call stating the eastern swarm of locusts have now turned carnivorous. At Maddy's request, Vivian locates Peter, who is being held at Fort Douglas, a bioweapons facility.\nThe FBI reveal to Peter they plan to dump extremely toxic VX gas, a nerve agent, on the locusts to kill them; Peter is uneasy. Maddy pleads with General Miller to help her speak to Peter, he relents and they travel to Fort Douglas to meet him, where Peter reveals to Maddy about the VX nerve gas. Maddy is furious, likening it to a nuclear bomb, but she reluctantly boards a helicopter with General Miller and Peter for a test run over the eastern swarm in Ohio, Miller promising Maddy it will only be used on rural areas with little to no population. Maddy questions its legality, but Miller retorts that it has been authorised by the President. Whilst they board the helicopter, Maddy discreetly makes a call to the news, informing them of the VX nerve gas test run. However, when they are airborne, the USWS informs the group the swarm over Ohio they would be targeting has moved towards southern Indiana and Miller continues to press ahead with the plans. Maddy and Peter are horrified, as southern Indiana is more populated than Ohio, pleading with Miller to turn around, but Miller coldly replies he never said there would not be fatalities. Maddy, desperate, begins using a spanner to smash the VX container on board the helicopter, forcing Miller to turn around before the gas is released, which would cause all on board to die. The helicopter is ordered to turn around regardless when the national news breaks stories of the VX gas being used, as the mission relied on secrecy. Miller is furious.\nMaddy calls Dan, asking him to check on her grandfather, Lyle (Mike Farrell), whose farm is in Indiana and thus right in the path of the locusts. Dan leaves immediately for Indiana. Lyle begins gathering the cattle and moving them indoors in advance of the swarm, helped by Maddy and Peter, who arrive in a military vehicle, and by Dan who arrives just as the swarm approaches. They take shelter in a metal grain silo just in time, but as they do so, Maddy notices the electric fly trap on the outside has killed a few locusts. This gives Maddy the idea to use the generator inside the silo to send an electric current to the outside of the grain silo, hopefully killing them. The only problem is the generator has no fuel, the only fuel available is on the other side of the farm. Peter volunteers to go and get it, given that he created them, and covers himself with a sheet to try and protect himself. The swarm attack him immediately and though he makes it back inside, he is covered in bites and blood, revealing the swarm are indeed carnivorous. Lyle loads up the generator and Dan attaches the cables to the metal shell of the silo, sending a powerful current through it. The part of the swarm that attacked the grain silo are killed, but Peter has lost too much blood, and dies. Armed with the knowledge on how to kill them, Dan and Maddy race back to Washington D.C. before the VX gas is used again.\nAt the Department for Homeland Security, the debate continues on how to deal with them, those in the meeting reluctantly agreeing to Miller's plan to use the toxic VX gas on both swarms as there is no alternative. Maddy and Dan enter the debate and try to convince the others they know how to kill them without killing the human population too - they can use electricity. Miller does not believe it can work, calling it \"fantasy\" and Secretary Morales, Maddy's boss, angrily tells them to sit down, but the quiet Lorelei Wentworth defends Dan and Maddy, revealing she is the Secretary for the Department of Energy, and that it may indeed be possible to create a massive electric current to kill the swarms, as both swarms are approaching the Continental Power Grids. If the United States switches off their electricity, she can re-route the unused power through the grids, causing a massive electrical current and expanding the electrical field beyond the wires. This persuades Senator Clauson to support the electricity plan, especially as it means not dumping a nerve agent on her people. Director Rusk gives the go ahead for the plan to increase the electricity current through the power lines, but General Miller is skeptical, and warns he will act when the plan does not work.\nDan is concerned that the locust swarms will not be attracted to the current, but Maddy has a flashback - the locusts are attracted to bright light, hence why they attacked the glass office buildings in Pittsburgh and the metal grain silo, both of which reflected sunlight. Maddy calls the USWS again, who agree to launch weather balloons near the power lines in an attempt to attract them. At dawn the next day, power is switched off throughout the United States and rerouted to the two power lines, one each in western and eastern America. Meanwhile, preparations continue in Utah for a launch of VX gas should the electricity plan fail. Maddy and Dan arrive at one of the two sites, and instruct the Air Force to move the weather balloons closer to the power lines, otherwise they will not work. Maddy and Dan reconcile, but just as they are about to kiss, the swarm arrives and they retreat to their car for safety. Wentworth activates the power grid, and the swarms fly into the massively amplified power cables. The cables burst into flames with the amount of current, exploding the transformers, but the plan works, the locust swarms are killed by the electricity. Those in the Department of Homeland Security meeting celebrate, but Secretary Morales reverses the situation on General Miller, warning him he might not have a job much longer for wanting to gas the American people.\nOne year later, Maddy and Dan have a child together. Maddy receives a call about her next work, but consults with Dan before she accepts, as she finally accepts family time is more important than her job.", "tmdb_plot": "Dr. Maddy Rierdon, an investigator for the Department of Agriculture, is the only person who can protect America from a deadly breed of bioengineered locusts.", "tmdb_id": "90831", "wiki_id": "69186945"}, {"title": "Locusts: The 8th Plague", "genres": ["Drama", "Horror"], "wiki_plot": "The film starts in a genetics laboratory 15 miles outside Prairie, Idaho. Inside the laboratory, Gary Wolf (David Keith) and Russ Snow (Jeff Fahey) have made a completely new species of locust that is genetically engineered to eat insects that destroy crops.

One of the main vents jams midway through the process and Gary sends one of the Silogen workers into the tunnel system. The worker finds that the vent is stuck in the open position and after scanning the holding pen, the locusts attack the worker and he is killed within a few seconds. The locusts then escape from the Silogen Research Facility through the open vent.\nMeanwhile, on a small farm near Prairie, Colt Dunton (Dan Cortese) is producing a new kind of organic pesticide which he introduces to his friends, Hank Odem and his wife Agatha. Colt leaves the farm to check his pesticide and Hank starts his husker blade to harvest the corn. The blade suddenly jams, Hank gets out to investigate and discovers the remains of a bull that has been almost completely eaten. He radios Agatha and tells her about the bull. Agatha hears something in the corn and discovers the remains of her son, Mike. Grief-stricken, she starts to panic. Hank heads towards his combine and discovers that it is covered in locusts which attack and kill him. Agatha runs through the field and is also attacked and killed by the locusts. Colt arrives on the scene and finds the dead body of a locust. He runs to the medical hospital where his girlfriend, Vicky (Julie Benz), works as a veterinarian. Vicky and Colt then hear reports of cows and farm animals dying in the same way as the bull on Hank's farm. Vicky and Colt examine the remains of a dead cow and find a locust in it.\nMeanwhile in Prairie, a family having a picnic is attacked by the locusts and their son is the only survivor. A State Trooper (Atanas Srebrev) takes him to a hospital. Colt examines a dead locust that was on the car that the Trooper used to bring in the child and discovers that it is a juvenile. Vicky tries to tell him that the locusts were all drones but the examination proves that the locusts are breeding.\nColt, Vicky, USDA Agent Greg Ballard (Kirk Woller) and a group of exterminators find the locusts' nest and spray pesticides in an attempt to kill the larvae and locusts. This irritates the locusts and they attack the group. Colt, Vicky and Greg are the only survivors. This leads Colt to wonder why they were not attacked. Back at the headquarters of the USDA, Greg decides that the only option they have is to spray the locusts with UD-66, the most dangerous chemical weapon on the planet. Vicky tells Greg to issue the order despite Colt telling her that if they spray it, plants will not grow back for 10 years.\nMeanwhile, the swarm of locusts attacks an amusement park off the major highway. Many people at the amusement park are eaten alive by the locusts. Back at the laboratory, Colt (who had taken sample larvae from the nest) examines the locust larva to try to figure out why they did not attack Vicky and him; he then tries on some live adult locusts and discovers that chemical pesticides attract them. Greg then gathers a large amount of livestock in a field and the locusts arrive. He orders a helicopter to drop the pesticide which had been changed to UD-45. Despite Colt trying to get to the field to tell Greg and Vicky what he has discovered, the helicopter drops the pesticide and the pilots are attacked by the swarm, destroying the helicopter. Colt then decides to use the organic pesticide he developed on the locust swarm which has now attacked the town of Prairie and during the attack Gary who was trying to flee is killed by the locusts. Colt flies a plane over the city and drops the pesticide and the swarm of locusts dies instantly. But before they can celebrate, two larger swarms appear over the city and this time, Vicky's father, Russ, decides to lure the locusts into the crop dome using the pheromone lure. The pheromone works and the locusts fly into the crop dome. Russ then sacrifices his life by going into the dome and programming it to self-destruct.

His probation is revoked and he is sentenced to three years in prison as a result.\nUsing his influence and contacts, Texas warden Rudolph Hazen, an avid football fan, manages to have Crewe transferred into his prison as he wishes to use him as a coach for his personal football team composed of his prison guards to boost his reputation for future elections as State Governor. Using a week in a hot box to coerce him, Crewe recommends that the guards, led by head guard Captain Knauer, play a tune-up game, a game between the guards and a team that they easily slaughter to boost morale. Hazen tasks Crewe with forming a team composed of the prison inmates, believing that he will be unable to unite the unruly prisoners, thus not only achieving his goals, but also exerting his power over the inmates.\nCrewe befriends inmate Caretaker, who helps organize tryouts but finds a mostly inept roster due to Crewe's legacy. Seeing the team forming attracts former college football star Nate Scarborough, who decides to help coach the team by gathering several intimidating inmates, most of whom join in order to exact revenge against the abusive guards, bolstering his defense. Caretaker implores Crewe to seek out assistance from the black inmates to gain some much needed offensive strength and speed. Crewe challenges their leader, Deacon Moss, to a one-on-one basketball game but refuses to call any fouls on Deacon, despite them being blatant. Deacon wins and refuses to offer help, but Earl Megget is impressed by Crewe's resilience and joins as his running back.\nAs the team gains strength, Hazen and the guards hinder Crewe's team in several ways, such as taunting Megget into attacking a guard by verbally harassing him at the library with ethnic slurs; Megget, however, does not retaliate. Deacon and the other black inmates witness this and decide to join Crewe's team to exact revenge. Meanwhile, inmate Unger spies on the activities of the inmates for the guards and is implored to use his \"talents\" to weaken their team. Unger rigs an incendiary explosive into the radio in Crewe's cell, which Caretaker accidentally sets off and is sealed within Crewe's cell by Unger, preventing anyone from rescuing him.\nOn game day, the inmates are revitalized in the wake of Caretaker's murder when they find he used his connections to his cousin at Reebok to supply the inmates with quality uniforms and gear as well as giving them the team name Mean Machine. Crewe deals with some difficulty getting the inmates to focus on winning the game during opening play, stating that a loss to them would be a far bigger mark of shame to the guards than any physical brutality they could inflict on them. Though the guards take an early lead, even having the referees call bogus penalties on them (which Crewe quickly amends by firing the football into the referee's crotch), by the end of the first half, the Mean Machines tie the game.\nHazen corners Crewe during halftime, during which he reveals that Unger killed Caretaker and allegedly says that Crewe was his accomplice, along with Knauer allegedly witnessing the plan to kill Caretaker. Crewe initially dismisses the allegations, but Hazen threatens to increase his prison sentence to 25 years unless Crewe purposely throws the game and gives the guards a two-touchdown lead. Reluctantly, Crewe agrees. Hazen then orders Knauer to \"inflict as much damage as possible\" on the inmates once they get the lead. During the opening of the second half, Crewe deliberately throws the game and abandons his teammates despite their efforts to catch up in scoring. After earning a two touchdown lead on the Mean Machines, the Guards begin to brutally injure the inmates, spurring Crewe to re-enter the field. The inmates initially refuse to help him, allowing him to be sacked twice, but on 4th down and long, Crewe completes a 1st down on his own. Crewe confesses that he had threw the game that got him cut from the NFL, citing he owed debts to \u201cworse people\u201d. Informing the team of Hazen's threats, he declares that he would rather stay with the inmates than betray Caretaker's memory. The Mean Machines rally behind Crewe once more and with a decisive two-point conversion, they win the game by a one-point margin.\nKnauer, having newfound respect for Crewe, congratulates him for the win and informs Crewe that he is aware that he had nothing to do with Caretaker's murder and would defend him. Hazen admonishes Knauer for losing a fixed game and notices that Crewe is heading towards the exit. Eagerly implying Crewe is trying to escape, Hazen orders that Crewe be shot. Knauer hesitates and at the last moment realizes, and scornfully informs Hazen, that Crewe is only picking up the game football. Crewe returns it to Hazen, telling him to \"stick it in [his] trophy case\". Deacon and Battle then dump Gatorade on Hazen, while Crewe and Scarbrough go to get information on where Unger is so that psychotic inmate Switowski can deal with him.", "tmdb_plot": "Pro quarter-back, Paul Crewe and former college champion and coach, Nate Scarboro are doing time in the same prison.

The incident inspires him to go into the arms trade. Yuri muses that the constant need for weapons is similar to the human need for food and drink, thus he can make a fortune. After successfully completing his first sale of an Uzi sub machine gun to a local mobster, Yuri convinces his younger brother Vitaly to become his partner.\nThe two brothers get their first big break during the 1982 Lebanon War, where they sell weapons to both Israeli and Lebanese troops despite witnessing the same weapons being used to commit war crimes and other atrocities. As Yuri begins to prosper by exploiting his growing network of business connections, he comes to the attention of Interpol, in particular an idealistic agent named Jack Valentine, with whom he crosses paths on multiple occasions. Valentine represents a unique threat to Yuri because he is after glory, not money, and thus cannot be bought off.\nVitaly becomes addicted to cocaine after a Colombian drug lord forces the brothers to accept several kilos of cocaine to pay for an arms sale of numerous Glock 17 pistols. Yuri quietly checks Vitaly into a drug rehabilitation clinic and continues his business alone.

However, his uncle is killed in a car bombing attack planted by Yuri's rival, arms dealer Simeon Weisz. Yuri then expands his business to Africa, where he begins a business relationship with Andre Baptiste Sr., a ruthless dictator engaged in a brutal civil war in Liberia.\nDuring one flight into Africa in 2001, Yuri's plane is intercepted by Valentine and forced to land. Yuri escapes arrest by landing in a remote area and giving away all of his cargo to the locals.

Yuri gives in and shoots Simeon dead.\nValentine then tells Ava her husband is an arms dealer, prompting her to confront him. To please his wife, Yuri tries to legitimize his business in trading timbers, but soon becomes frustrated with the difficulties and lower earnings of honest work. When Baptiste visits him in person and offers him the largest payday of his career, a stash of valuable blood diamonds, Yuri goes back to crime.\nYuri picks up Vitaly to assist him with a major deal in Sierra Leone, where a militia force allied with Baptiste is visibly preparing to destroy a refugee camp. Unable to stomach his guilt, Vitaly pleads with Yuri to abandon the deal, but his brother refuses knowing that Baptiste's men will kill them for refusing to hand over the guns. Vitaly then steals a pair of grenades and uses them to destroy a truck full of weapons, accidentally killing Baptiste's son. He is gunned down by the militia, and while Yuri is spared for his relationship with Baptiste Sr., he only receives half of the diamonds he was promised because half of the shipment is destroyed. He then watches helplessly as the militia massacres the refugees.\nYuri ships his brother's remains back to the United States. He pays a doctor to forge a phony death certificate and remove the bullets from Vitaly's body, but one bullet remains, and Yuri is apprehended by federal agents.

Grace and her father travel in convoy with a number of gunmen through rural Alabama where they stop briefly outside a plantation called Manderlay. As the gangsters converse, a black woman emerges from Manderlay's front gates complaining that someone is about to be whipped for stealing a bottle of wine.\nGrace enters the plantation and learns that within it, slavery persists, roughly 70 years after the American Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation. Grace is appalled and insists on staying at the plantation with a small contingent of gunmen and her father's lawyer, Joseph, in order to guarantee the slaves' safe transition to freedom. Shortly after Grace's father and the remaining gangsters depart, Mam, the master of the house, dies, but not before asking Grace to burn a notebook containing \"Mam's Law,\" an exhaustive code of conduct for the entire plantation and all its inhabitants, free and slave.

In order to guarantee that the former slaves will not continue to be exploited as sharecroppers, Grace orders Joseph to draw up contracts for all Manderlay's inhabitants, institutionalizing a form of cooperative living in which the white family works as slaves and the blacks collectively own the plantation and its crops. Throughout this process, Grace lectures all those present about the notions of freedom and democracy, using rhetoric entirely in keeping with the ideology of racial equality which most contemporary Americans had yet to embrace.\nHowever, as the film progresses, Grace fails to embed these principles in Manderlay's community in a form she considers satisfactory. Furthermore, her suggestions for improving the conditions of the community backfire on several occasions, such as using the surrounding trees for timber, which leaves the crops vulnerable to dust storms.

Three years later during the New year's Eve at a ball at the Governor General's palace in Calcutta, Pandey angers Captain Hewson (Ben Nealon) when he attempts to stop him from severely beating an Indian servant for inadvertently touching Emily Kent, the daughter of Mr. Graham Kent, an influential British businessman. Gordon witnesses the assault but does not stop it leading to tension with Pandey. However he apologizes to Pandey during a wrestling match and a friendship is formed between them transcending rank, colour and race. \nThe company then introduces a new weapon in January 1857 for its troops: the Enfield rifled musket. Rumours spread among the sepoys that the paper cartridges holding the powder and ball for the rifle are greased with either pig fat or beef tallow; the process of loading the rifle requires the soldier to bite down on the cartridge, and the soldiers believe that this would cause them to consume pork or beef \u2014 acts abhorrent to Muslim and Hindu soldiers for religious reasons. A low-caste labourer named Nainsukh teases Pandey, a Brahmin, that he has lost his caste by using such a gun, but Pandey dismisses Nainsukh's taunts. The sepoys, led by Pandey, express their concerns to General Hearsey (Jeremy Clyde), but he reassures them that no such cartridge exists. The sepoys remain concerned when they are asked to test-fire the new rifle at musketry drill, but Gordon, after talking to Hearsey, reiterates that no such cartridge exists and asks a sepoy to test-fire the rifle. Pandey volunteers, and his fellow sepoys chastise him afterward. However, demonstrating his trust in Gordon, he states his belief that the rumours are untrue.\nMeanwhile, Gordon stops a Sati ceremony from occurring and rescues a widow, Jwala (Ameesha Patel). He arranges for her to be treated, and the two gradually become closer, eventually having an affair. Also, Pandey further earns Captain Hewson's ire by stopping him from trying to rape a tawaif named Heera (Rani Mukerji), who was sold to a brothel run by Lal Bibi (Kirron Kher). He suffers a serious beating from Hewson and three other officers the next day, but Gordon intervenes and saves Pandey. Pandey meets Heera at the brothel afterwards, and they begin to fall in love with each other. Some time later, Nainsukh takes Pandey and some other sepoys to see the factory, owned by Mr. Kent, where the cartridge grease is made; indeed, the grease turns out to be pig fat and beef tallow. Pandey, believing Gordon lied to him, returns Gordon's pistol and ends their friendship.\nHearing of the 34th Regiment's refusal to use the rifles, the 19th Regiment at Berhampore also refuses to use them in a parade at the ground on 12 February 1857, and mutiny brews among the sepoys. Gordon unsuccessfully attempts to dissuade Pandey and the mutineers from rebelling, and is likewise unsuccessful at convincing Major General George Anson (Christopher Adamson), the Commander-in-Chief, India, to abandon using the cartridges. The mutineers, meanwhile, meet with Tatya Tope (Deepraj Rana) and his messenger Azimullah (Shahbaz Khan) and they all agree to unite under the leadership of the elderly Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar (Habib Tanvir) and rise in rebellion. Anson decides to send the Queen's Regiment from Rangoon to intercept and subdue the rebels; it is scheduled to arrive in Berhampore on 1 April. Heera informs Pandey of this plan, having spent the previous night with Hewson. The rebels revise their timetable to march on 30 March, but the wife of one of the rebels, angry at her husband after an argument in which he tells her of the impending revolt, informs her British employer woman of the plans. As the employer woman is having an affair with Hewson at the time, he overhears the conversation and later tortures the rebel into revealing the date of the march.\nOn 29 March, the mutineers are informed of the Rangoon Regiment's arrival. Pandey attempts to rally them into fending off the attack, and when the officers, including Gordon, inquire as to what they are doing, the rebels turn on them. With the regiment's arrival, the mutineers want to throw down their weapons; Pandey, however, fires at the opposing forces, killing two and injuring four, then attempts to shoot himself when the regiment surrounds him. Captured alive, he is court-martialed, and Gordon testifies on his behalf, passionately defending his actions and warning of bloody rebellion if he is hanged. Despite Gordon's warning, the court-martial imposes a death sentence on Pandey. The night before Pandey's execution, Heera visits him in his jail cell and has him place sindoor on her forehead, marking their marriage.\nThe next day (on 8 April), in front of Gordon, the British officers, his fellow sepoys, and the townspeople, Pandey is hanged. Inspired by his execution, the spectators break out in revolt.

All of those questioned express their disapproval. One of them comments the absurdity of the situation: had the gay right-wing and neo-Nazis lived in the era they admire, they would have been exterminated.\nFour gay men in present-day Germany who are, or have been, engaged in right-wing political parties are interviewed: Andre, a skinhead; Bela Ewald Althans, a former prominent neo-Nazi leader; Alexander Schlesinger, who is involved in right wing politics and J\u00f6rg Fischer, a right wing theorist.\nAndre is a skinhead who defines violence as to have the courage to defend himself and as part of the expression of the warrior within. Openly gay, he is tolerated by his fellow skinheads but admits that he is in constant threat. Eventually, he moves away from the skinheads movement to conservative politics.\nBela Ewald Althans, who now works in advertising, was in the early 1990s one of Germany most prominent neo-Nazi, an Adolf Hitler admirer and Holocaust denier. In 1994, he was arrested and spent 21 months in jail for denying the Holocaust in front of astonished tourists during a visit to Auschwitz concentration camp while he was filmed in Profesion: Neonazi (Beruf Neonazi), a documentary about him. Althans is now involved in the gay community, but he does not regret his past. He tells that he did not become gay from one day to the other, but evolved in his feelings and attractions until he discovered his true self.\nAlexander Schlesinger, who came from East Germany, is a member of a political party representing extreme right-wing views. Schlesinger claims that being gay does not make a person better: a gay can be racist. About what he finds appealing, he comments: \"We gay men are drawn toward a masculine ideal. I can't stand a screaming queen\".\nFor nine years, J\u00f6rg Fischer was an active member of the extreme right-wing parties NPD and DVU. During that time he had a relationship with another male party member. Although they had sex many times a week for four years, they never talked about sex or mentioned the word gay. Fischer left those organizations in 1991, rejecting their anti-immigrant and anti-gay policies. He found a different romantic male partner and now works in social issues.\nThe testimonies of the four men are intertwined with interviews by historians, journalists and intellectuals who have followed the links between fascism and homosexuality through recent German history. The life of famed neo-Nazi Michael Kuhnen is recounted. Considered the F\u00fchrer by his followers, he kept his homosexuality secret until 1981 when Johannes Bugner, a young gay neo-Nazi, was stabbed to death in Hamburg for his sexual orientation. Kuhnen disengaged himself from the killers, considering Bugner a martyr of the movement and came out as gay in his booklet National Socialism and homosexuality, writing that gay men make better fighters, because, having no family, they are closer to their comrades. Kuhnen, ostracized by his former supporters, died of AIDS in 1991.\nThere have always been extreme right-wing homosexuals, the documentary explains, even in Nazi Germany. Rudolf Hess had no interest in women, wrote love letters and poems to men in his youth and married only on Hitler's advise. Ernst R\u00f6hm, co-founder of the Sturmabteilung (SA, \"Storm Battalion\"), the Nazi Party militia, was a close friend of Hitler beginning in 1919, and was the only one allowed to address Hitler by his first name, Adolph. Hitler knew about R\u00f6hm's homosexuality and particular weakness for young soldiers but turned a blind eye as he counted on R\u00f6hm's violent trooper paramilitary Brownshirts during his ascending to power. During the purge of the Nazi party known as Night of the Long Knives (1934) Hitler had R\u00f6hm arrested and killed shortly after in prison. Edmund Heines, R\u00f6hm's deputy in the SA, was another gay Nazi leader. He set up his own special concentration camp near Breslau so he could torture and kill victims for pleasure. Theories on Hitler's own sexuality are also briefly examined. Lothar Machtan in his book Hitler's Secret: The double life of a dictator (Hitlers Geheimnis: Das Doppelleben eines Diktators) questions Hitler's sexuality.\nDuring the Nazi regime between 5 and 15 thousand gay men were killed in concentration camps.

Whether a result of being a mother or from an organic or drug-induced biochemical imbalance, Generosa becomes increasingly paranoid accusing Ted of, among other indiscretions, adultery.  Her erratic behavior tears the marriage apart, thereby unleashing a very contentious divorce procedure with Generosa demanding custody of the twins, ownership of their house in the Hamptons and, if possible, all of Ted's wealth. She even resorts to lying to the children about Ted in an attempt to turn them against him.\nUnable to come to an agreement, Generosa and the twins stay at a hotel where she meets her contractor Daniel \"Danny\" Pelosi (Shawn Christian), and the two start a relationship, with him pushing her to hold out for money from Ted. When Ted is murdered, she inherits all of Ted's estate; three months thereafter, she and Danny get married. She holds back the truth about Ted's death from her children by telling them that Ted committed suicide by drinking alcohol, along with swallowing pills. They eventually come under police suspicion. Generosa learns that she's dying from breast cancer.\nDanny wants custody of the kids, but Generosa rejects the idea because he'd been partying and spending her money carelessly. She changes her will, leaving Danny with only $2,000,000, $1,000,000 to her housekeeper and nanny, Kaye, and the remainder of her wealth to her children. Kaye also receives custody of the children and soon, she sends Greg away to a private school, while his sister remains behind. Some time after Generosa's death, Danny is arrested for Ted's murder.

Along the journey, a Korean warrior (seemingly her fianc\u00e9) attempts to seize her back, but Meng Yi saves her. Meng Yi protects Ok-Soo through their journey back, while Ok-Soo tends to his wounds. In the process, she begins to develop feelings for him but Meng Yi, while apparently harboring similar feelings for her, steps back, reminding her of her purpose of becoming a concubine in the interests of her people and successfully completes his mission. The Qin emperor becomes critically ill later and sends Meng Yi to find the elixir of immortality, the only thing that can save his life. Before leaving, Meng Yi discreetly confesses his feelings to Ok-Soo, stating \"my heart belongs to you forever,\" and Ok-Soo vows to await his return. The guards escorting the elixir are ambushed by rebels on the orders of the treacherous prince and chancellor. Meng Yi hands over the elixir to his deputy, Nangong Yan, before dying in the ensuing battle. Although Nangong Yan manages to bring the elixir to the emperor, the prince and chancellor trick Nangong Yan and Ok-soo to test the validity of the elixir and force them to consume the elixir, condemning them to imprisonment in the Qin emperor's mausoleum for eternity.\nIn the present day, Jack, an archaeologist (also Chan), is Meng Yi's reincarnation, and he often dreams about his past life. One day, his friend William invites him on a quest to find a rare material that can create a field of zero gravity. They travel to a floating tomb of a Dasar prince in India, where Jack discovers a painting of the princess he has been seeing in his dreams. Jack also learns that during a mission to the Qin Empire, the Dasar prince brought treasures and women as gifts. In return, the Qin emperor offered him one of his concubines and asked him to choose, but refused when the prince chose his favourite, Ok-soo. Instead, the Qin emperor gave him a painting of Ok-soo and the Qin Star Gem. William removes a strange black rock from a feline statue, and accidentally collapses the zero gravity field holding up the tomb, resulting in its destruction. William manages to escape, but Jack leaps off a cliff and falls into a river. He loses consciousness and drifts along with the current until he is saved by Samantha, an Indian peasant girl. Samantha brings Jack to see her uncle, a Kalaripayattu (Indian martial art form) guru, who tells Jack to take the sword he found and fight with one of his students. During the fight, Jack has a recollection of a duel he had with the Dasar prince in his past life, and briefly recovers his fighting skills from his life as Meng Yi. Samantha's uncle enlightens Jack about his past and future, and Jack succeeds in returning home safely, and he delivers the sword to the National Museum of China as a national treasure. His action angered Professor Koo, the leader of the syndicate that has been funding Jack and William's treasure hunt.\nAfter extensive research, Jack and William conclude that the anti-gravity material is a fragment of a meteorite that fell to Earth during the Qin dynasty. They find the location of the Qin emperor's mausoleum, concealed behind a waterfall. The massive tomb contains the strongest fragment of the meteorite, powerful enough to make the tomb a floating palace. Jack meets Ok-soo and Nangong Yan alive inside the tomb, and they mistake him for Meng Yi. Professor Koo and his men enter and attempt to seize the immortality elixir, leading to an aerial fight between both parties. William accidentally breaks the balance of the field after removing a piece of the meteorite and causes the tomb to collapse on itself, and dies from drowning in mercury. While Jack is escaping from the collapsing tomb, he asks Ok-soo to come with him, but she refuses after realizing he is not Meng Yi and says she will wait for the real Meng Yi forever, believing he still lives.

It is implied that the 54 were members of the organization acting out their roles. Back in Toyokawa, Yuka, who was also a member of Haikyo.com, wonders if her sister was involved in the mass suicide. She writes a story speculating how her father would react if she were to disappear as well, and deliberately leaves clues before running off to Tokyo to join I.C. Corp.\nTetsuzo attempts to put on a brave face after Yuka's disappearance, but his wife Taeko's mental condition deteriorates rapidly and she eventually commits suicide. Meanwhile, Tetsuzo, a reporter, gathers clues regarding his daughters' disappearances and discovers Yuka's story. He is crushed to find that his daughter could predict his actions and behaviour so accurately while he was completely unaware of his daughters' feelings. His investigations reveal Haikyo.com and taking a cue from sensationalist media tabloids, he concludes that his daughters are part of a cult called the \"Suicide Club\".\nTetsuzo contacts a member of I.C. Corp, who refutes the existence of a \"suicide club\" and instead expounds on a concept of social roles that forms the basis of his organisation. Tetsuzo gets an old friend of his, Ikeda (Shirou Namiki) to pose as a client for I.C. Corp and rent Kumiko as his wife, and Noriko and Yuka as his daughters (who go by the aliases Mitsuko and Yoko respectively). Tetsuzo finds a house in Tokyo resembling his own and moves all the furniture from the old house to the new one so that it will resemble it exactly. Mitsuko and Yoko are unsettled when they arrive at the house, but they fall back into their roles when prompted by Kumiko. Ikeda sends Kumiko away on an errand and Tetsuzo reveals himself. The girls, however, treat him as a stranger and insist that they are Mitsuko and Yoko, not Noriko and Yuka.\nAs the session falls apart, thugs from the organisation arrive on site to beat up Tetsuzo, who attacks them with a knife and kills all of them in the living room. Kumiko arrives from her errand shortly thereafter, playing out her role as if nothing is wrong, but then imploring Tetsuzo to kill her and run away with Noriko and Yuka. Her insistence gravely disturbs Noriko and Yuka, before Yuka interrupts the heated conversation and asks to 'extend the session'.\nFinally, Tetsuzo, Kumiko, Mitsuko and Yuka dine together as a happy family and Tetsuzo begins acting as if Kumiko is his wife, calling her Taeko. Yuka does not sleep that night and leaves the home at the crack of dawn, shedding her role and name.

During the process of making a documentary titled The Curse, Kobayashi disappeared after his house burnt down and his wife Keiko was found dead in the ruins. The aforementioned documentary begins to play, shown mostly through the recordings of Kobayashi's cameraman Miyajima.\nA year and a half earlier, Kobayashi investigates a woman named Junko Ishii and her son after her neighbor hears the sound of crying babies coming from her house. Ishii soon moves away, and Kobayashi and Miyajima return to her former residence to find dead pigeons on the property. Ishii's neighbor and her daughter die in a mysterious car crash. Around the same time, Kana Yano, a girl who exhibits strong psychic abilities on a variety television program, disappears. Speaking to her parents, Kobayashi learns a man named Mitsuo Hori visited Kana. Hori, an eccentric psychic, claims that Kana was taken by \"ectoplasmic worms.\" Hori's obscure directions lead Kobayashi and Miyajima to observe a man named Osawa, who takes pigeons into his home in a nearby apartment block. Osawa is later reported missing.\nAfter filming at a shrine, actress Marika Matsumoto finds herself fashioning yarn and wires into interconnected loops in her sleep. Kobayashi sets up a camera to record her one night and captures a voice saying the word \"Kagutaba.\" Kobayashi visits local historian, Tanimura, who tells him that Kagutaba is the name of a demon. The residents of a village called Shimokage once summoned Kagutaba, but imprisoned it for disobeying their commands. An annual ritual was performed to appease Kagutaba until the village was demolished in 1978 to make way for a dam. The final ritual, which was filmed, was performed by a priest and his daughter. At the end of the ritual, the daughter became hysterical; Tanimura says that she was believed to have become possessed by Kagutaba. Kobayashi discovers that the daughter is Junko Ishii. He learns that Ishii worked at a nursing school where she helped perform illegal abortions and stole the fetuses.\nMarika reveals that her neighbor Midori committed suicide by hanging. Midori, along with six other people including Osawa, hanged themselves in a park using nooses similar in fashion to Marika's loops. After Marika experiences strange behaviors, she goes with Kobayashi, Miyajima, and Hori to the Shimokage dam to perform the ritual to appease Kagutaba, hoping that doing so will free her from the demon's influence. After Kobayashi and Marika perform the ritual, Hori becomes agitated and runs into a nearby forest, and Kobayashi follows him. Marika flees from Miyajima, but exhibits signs of possession. She flees into the forest, pursued by Miyajima. Meanwhile, Kobayashi and Hori find the villagers' dogs slaughtered near a secluded shrine in the woods. Kobayashi's camera captures an apparition of Kana under a torii, surrounded by writhing fetuses. Marika abruptly recovers.\nAfter delivering Marika and Hori to a hospital, Kobayashi and Miyajima break into Ishii's current home. Inside, they find that she has hanged herself, Kana is dead, and Ishii's young son is alive; a newspaper article then reveals that the boy is not Ishii's son. Kobayashi adopts the boy. Kobayashi returns to Tanimura, who shows him a scroll depicting how Kagutaba was first summoned, wherein baby monkeys were fed to a medium. Ishii tried replicating this by feeding the stolen fetuses to Kana. Marika recovers, and Hori is placed in a mental institution. He escapes and is found dead a day later.\nAfter Kobayashi's disappearance, his video camera is discovered in a package. The tape inside shows the events that led to the destruction of Kobayashi's house: a crazed Hori arrives at the house, revealing the boy to be Kagutaba, incapacitates Kobayashi, and bludgeons the child with a rock.

While working a job washing hair, Josey reconnects with an old acquaintance, Glory Dodge, who works at the local iron mine and suggests Josey do the same, as a job there pays six times more than what Josey's making now. When Josey takes the job, her relationship with Hank becomes strained. Hank also works at the mine and believes women shouldn't be working there, so Josey and her children move in with Glory and her husband, Kyle.\nJosey quickly befriends several other female workers at the mine and soon realizes the women are constant targets for sexual harassment and humiliation by most of their male co-workers, who, like Hank, believe the women are taking jobs more appropriate for men. Josey in particular is targeted by Bobby Sharp, her ex-boyfriend from high school. Josey tries to talk to her supervisor, Arlen Pavich, about the problem, but he refuses to take her concerns seriously. The women experience additional harassment and even abuse in retaliation, and Bobby spreads rumors that Josey attempted to seduce him, leading his wife to publicly berate and humiliate Josey at Sammy's hockey game. Sammy begins to resent the way the townspeople treat them and comes to believe the gossip about his mother's alleged promiscuity.\nJosey takes her concerns to the mine's owner, Don Pearson, but despite his previous assurances that he is there to help, she arrives to find that he has invited Pavich to the meeting, along with several other executives and offers to accept her resignation immediately. She refuses, and after Pearson implies he believes the rumors about her promiscuity, leaves devastated. Later, after being sexually assaulted by Bobby at work, she resigns and asks Bill White, a lawyer friend of Kyle and Glory, to help her file a lawsuit against the company. Bill advises her to recruit other women to form a class action lawsuit, which would be the first of its kind.

He and Alice then reconcile. In court, the mining company's attorney attempts to hold Josey's sexual history against her, based on Bobby's testimony that Sammy is the result of a consensual sexual relationship between Josey and her high school teacher, Paul Lattavansky. Josey then reveals that after school one day, where she and Bobby had been serving detention together after being caught kissing, she was raped by Lattavansky, which led to her becoming pregnant with Sammy.

Local terrorists stage an attack on an upscale shopping mall in Riyadh which (after intervention by Saudi special forces) kills about 300 Americans associated with multinational oil companies. This attack leads the U.S. to send troops to Saudi Arabia. In the meantime, the oil crisis escalates when two large tankers collide in the narrow Houston Ship Channel, shutting down the Channel.\nOnce winter sets in, gas lines take a back seat to critical shortages of heating oil during a bitterly cold winter, with thousands dying in the cold. Some good news comes after the Houston Ship Channel is reopened, but on Christmas Day, the same Saudi terrorists blow up sections of the mammoth Ras Tanura refinery complex, killing 142 U.S. soldiers who were protecting the Saudi oil infrastructure; among the casualties is the eldest son of the convenience store owners. Oil prices reach $153 per barrel, and gas prices top $8 per gallon.\nMeanwhile, with a government budget crisis due to military and economic pressures, farm spending is cut dramatically, leading to a subplot in which the social and political effects of this are explored. A well-renowned agricultural leader organizes a 750,000-farmer march on Washington, leading to clashes with police and the leader being taken into custody.\nIn the spring, the U.S. makes a deal with Russia to send 8 million barrels (1,300,000 m3) of oil by tanker, but the oil companies involved subsequently make a deal with China, which, equally hungry for oil and with greater financial reserves, outbids the U.S. This leaves America in a state of chaos, as well leading to soul-searching on whether China has now become the world's economic superpower. The country considers fast-tracking development of alternative energy sources, but there is little that can be done in the short-term to alter an economy structurally dependent on cheap foreign oil. Later, the U.S. government, showing unexpected diplomatic skill, resurrects the Russian oil deal by agreeing to a $16 billion long-term investment in its oil industry, and the China-bound tankers change course to the United States.\nThe crisis finally eases a year after Hurricane Julia, with Port Fourchon back at 80-percent capacity, the strategic petroleum reserve being replenished and tensions in Saudi Arabia stabilized. Oil prices drop from their highs at the height of the crisis to $73 per barrel, and gas prices nearing the $4 per gallon mark and dropping. However, the country has been through a stress as great as the Stock Market Crash of 1929, and now knowing that relying on OPEC for most of its foreign oil imports makes the United States vulnerable, Americans will never take cheap oil for granted again.", "tmdb_plot": "Documentary-style footage reveals the aftermath of disastrous events that disrupt the flow of oil to the United States.", "tmdb_id": "78370", "wiki_id": "2002708"}, {"title": "Oliver Twist", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Family"], "wiki_plot": "Nine-year-old orphaned Oliver Twist is taken to the workhouse by the beadle Mr. Bumble.

While travelling from her home to her in laws' home, which is too far away, the party stops in the middle of the trip to rest at a dharamshala (spiritual dwelling), where a ghost sees Lachchi, and falls in love with her. Later that night, it is revealed that Kishan, who is a dutiful son, will honor his father's wish to start a new, far-away business on a predetermined auspicious date, which happens to be the very next day. Kishan turns away from his wife at night, to finish his bookkeeping, and in the early morning hours sets off on a business trip that is to last five years. Lachchi is devastated; Gajrobai, her husband's sister-in-law, consoles her, empathizing on the grounds that Gajrobai's husband Sunderlal has also disappeared. The next day, the ghost appears in Bhanwarlal's house, having taken Kishan's shape and voice because of his own attachment to Lachchi.\nDespite of pretending to be Kishan in front of everyone else in the house, the ghost reveals his true identity to Lachchi at night.  Lachchi is thus presented with a dilemma between the representation of all of her desires in the form of the ghost who has taken the form of her real husband. She takes this newfound, sensual, magical, social, self-confident version of Kishan as hers. As Kishan, the ghost befriends all of the real Kishan's family and keeps Bhanwarlal happy by providing him with magical, possibly illusory, gold coins. His only blunder is in his treatment of the messenger Bhoja, who is perplexed by the idea that Kishan has sent a letter from his business trip only to receive it himself in his own house and offended when the ghost (who appears as Kishan) does not offer him a drink of water. Lachchi and the ghost lives blissfully together for four years, during which he also keeps her in-laws happy and solves many problems of the family and the village. Lachchi then, becomes pregnant with the ghost's child, and the real Kishan returns to see if the rumours about his wife's pregnancy are true. He returns to find the ghost in his (Kishan's) own form at the same time that Lachchi goes into early labor. Lachchi gives birth to a daughter, Lunima. Kishan's family is unable to determine which of the doppelgangers is the real Kishan (the ghost refusing to confess). They decide to visit the king so that he can arbitrate. In the meantime, Sundarlal also returns home and apologizes to Gajrobai for his sudden disappearance for so long and reunites with his family.\nOn the way to the king they meet an old shepherd, Gadariya who helps them out. He gives three tests in front of the real Kishan. He says the one who can pick up hot coals will prove himself as Bhanwalal's real son, the one who can gather the sheep in time will prove himself as the real husband of the bride, and the one who can enter his water-bottle will prove himself as the real lover of the bride. Kishan tries his best to perform the first two, which the ghost does not even bother to try. When the shepherd says 'the real lover of the bride', the ghost performs the third, impossible feat and enters the water bottle, simply to prove his love for Lachchi.  Thus, the real Kishan is found out. The shepherd quickly closes his bottle so the ghost cannot come out of it. Following this revelation, the real Kishan throws away the bottle in the middle of the desert, and everyone returns home. Lachchi is devastated over the loss of the ghost. \nIn the very end, it is revealed that the ghost has escaped the bottle and taken control of Kishan's body to live with her. While Lachchi tries to confess to her husband that the ghost had not actually fooled her, the ghost exposes his identity to Lachchi by reminding her of the name they were originally going to give their daughter.

Catherine is also a mathematician and was once a promising student at Northwestern University, but she struggles with living in her father's shadow and balancing her demanding studies with caring for her father, as well as the fear that she may have inherited his mental illness. At home, Robert clings to sanity by constantly bombarding Catherine with complex mathematical problems.\nIn the opening scene Robert startles Catherine while she watches TV in the middle of the night. He gives her a bottle of champagne for her birthday, and they chat for a while about the nature of insanity, ending with the revelation that Robert died last week and his funeral is tomorrow.\nAwakened from this dream, Catherine realizes that Hal, a former graduate student of Robert's, is still upstairs, reading through Robert's books. Robert filled many notebooks with meaningless notes. Hal believes that Robert's genius may have withstood his illness, and clues to that genius might lie among the gibberish of his notebooks. When Hal comments on the vast amount of work Robert did, a suspicious Catherine searches Hal's backpack. Though Catherine finds nothing in Hal's bag, a notebook falls out of his coat. He explains that he wanted to give the notebook as a birthday present because it \"had something written in it about her, not math, her\". Hal is forced to leave, giving the notebook as intended, when Catherine calls the police.\nThe next day, for the funeral, Catherine's sister Claire arrives in town. A huge contrast to the unkempt Catherine, Claire is an overly put together, neurotic New Yorker. Relations between the sisters are tense, and Catherine cannot stand her sister's constant harping on matters of appearance. Catherine is also upset that Claire didn't care for her father as much as Catherine did in his final years.\nAt the funeral, Catherine expresses her frustration with the many people there. She interrupts the string quartet with an impromptu speech, berating everyone for not being there for her father while he was alive. She describes his descent into insanity, and that at one time he would borrow piles of books believing that aliens were sending him messages encoded in their Dewey Decimal codes. She ends by saying she is glad her father is dead and walks out of the church mid-funeral.\nClaire decides to sell Robert's house back to the university and wants Catherine to come with her to New York; Catherine is upset that she will be forced to leave the house. It becomes evident that Claire suspects that Catherine may be struggling with mental illness, as their father had. A wake held at the house the night after the funeral is attended by many academic mathematicians. Hal appears and chats up Catherine. Softening up to Hal, Catherine sleeps with him.\nIn flashbacks, Robert is shown suddenly invigorated, believing he has seen the beginnings of a new mathematical proof that will prove his triumph over mental illness. In the present, Catherine gives Hal a key to Robert's desk and tells him to check the locked drawer for a notebook, which itself contains a lengthy but apparently very important proof. He is very excited and shows the discovery to Catherine and Claire. He asks Catherine how long she knew about this and why she did not tell him about it. She tells him that she wrote it. Catherine claims the work is hers and not her father's despite evidence to the contrary. Neither Hal nor Claire believe Catherine. Hal believes the mathematics of the proof are beyond Catherine, while Claire simply suspects that Catherine is suffering the onset of mental illness. Catherine says she can't describe the proof without the notebook because it \"is not a muffin recipe\". Hal decides to take it to the math department the next day to verify the proof's accuracy.\nHe returns as Claire and Catherine are leaving, with news that the math department believes the proof to be valid. Hal tells Claire that he doesn't think that her father wrote the proof because it employs newer mathematics and wants Catherine to explain it to him sometime. Catherine remains stung by his earlier lack of trust, and the sisters leave for the airport. Hal sprints after the car and throws the book through the window and onto Catherine's lap.\nAt the airport, Catherine has another flashback.

When he keels over from a heart attack, now it's up to a grad student, Allison (Kari W\u00fchrer), to keep it from the forces of darkness.\nIn the streets of Bucharest, a young girl named Maria loses her ball into the busy street. Suddenly, Lucifer (reprised by John Light) appears to her and tells her she should go get it. Almost trancelike, she wanders into the street and as a result is run over by a vehicle. Allison witnesses the whole thing and runs to the little girl's side. The girl tells Allison she has a message for her, but she cannot give it to her yet.\nOn her way down, Allison brushed into Dylan (Jason Scott Lee) who was standing at the entrance to her apartment building. He is sitting in a dark room assembling and loading his gun. A mysterious figure named Stark (Tony Todd) behind him discusses \"the job\" he was hired to do: to kill Allison. Dylan tries to take the noble route and shoots himself in the head rather than take another life. Not to be discouraged, Stark brings Dylan back to life on the spot and tells him that the brief taste of hell he just tasted should convince him to work for Stark.\nDylan breaks into Allison's house and holds her at gunpoint, and tells her that he was hired to do a job, but something is telling him that she is different. She was meant to live. He wants to know why she should live. She responds by saying that she has been entrusted with a responsibility, but she will not say what it is. Torn between doing the right thing and doing his job, Dylan kidnaps Allison and takes her with him. Stark breaks into the apartment a short time later; he tears the place apart and finds the Lexicon, but is only a decoy, a set of magazine articles bound together in the Lexicon's cover.\nDylan takes Allison to his \"friend\" Gabriella's house to get her a wig, some perfume, and some iron pills. The iron pills change the taste of her blood and the perfume changes her smell. Angels hunt by smell and taste (according to the first The Prophecy film). As they are escaping from a group of angels, Dylan explains the angel hierarchy - Cherubim and Seraphim are the most dangerous. He then sends her on her way and goes back to fight a hopeless battle to buy her time. The perfume and iron pills do the trick; Allison is able to escape. Stark's thrones capture Dylan and bring him before Stark. Stark claims to Dylan that Allison is going to start genocide the likes of which the world has never seen, so Dylan should have killed her when he had the chance.\nAllison goes to the only \"person\" she can \u2013 Lucifer.  He explains that the Lexicon is going to name the Antichrist in a matter of hours. The angels in Heaven do not want that kind of information falling into the hands of the wrong people. However, there are laws in Heaven against killing people, hence the hired assassin. For Heaven however, Allison turned their hired gun before he could finish the job. He then tells her that he will not get involved in this one, despite the fact that he already had.\nWhen Allison comes out of his rickety old mansion, there are two angels waiting to take her. She races across the field until she comes upon a funeral procession for the young girl Maria, who Lucifer sent to her death in the opening. The angels lose track of her in the crowd. The procession ends at an old church, which is safe ground for Allison. Meanwhile, Stark continues to torture Dylan because he still needs him, especially since Allison trusts Dylan now. Stark tells Dylan to get her out of the church, and they will take care of the rest.\nBack inside the church, Allison hears the voice of the little girl calling to her: she says that she feels so cold, and tells her that the \"bad angels\" do not want humans in Heaven. They are trying to keep them out, so she cannot let them have the book, no matter what. Dylan shows up at the church and stays with Allison through the night; he asks her if she is sure that she is on the right side in this war. Allison claims that \"you have to take some things on faith\". Dylan takes a look outside and sees dozens of angels waiting for them; worried, he feels that they must get out of there soon or else there will be hundreds by the morning. Thus, he tells Allison to wait for his signal and then run directly to his car. When she gets there, though, he has locked her out; the double-cross is complete.\nThe angels capture Allison and bring her before Stark; he tells her that he is against the whole messy idea of Armageddon. If they can find the name of the Antichrist, they can kill the child before the apocalypse and save humanity. Allison claims she's not keen on the idea of going over God's head, and she doesn't think he is either or she'd already be dead. Stark promises to kill her if he has to; however, he lets her leave for now.\nAs Allison leaves, she runs into Lucifer in the park; he helps her reason through what has happened. Stark and a few of the other seraphim aren't happy with the idea of Armageddon. After all, it means Heaven will be flooded with humans, beloved by God above even the seraphim themselves. Lucifer however likes the idea of Armageddon because it will mean that a billion new corrupt souls will appear on his doorstep.\nShe leaves to check on the Lexicon's hiding place, but she's attacked by a homeless man. A voice whispers to her that it is time to fight back; that is just what she does - she fights off the homeless man and snaps his neck. Stark and Dylan have already figured out where she has hidden it as Dylan remembered that she used to take a walk through the same park every day. Stark says she would have gone that way to check on the Lexicon, and thus they head to an abandoned house that Stark theorizes contains the Lexicon.\nAllison sees them heading for the house and breaks in through the cellar. The Lexicon has finished its task of writing the name of the Antichrist\u2014Mykael Paun, and he shall bear four distinct marks on his face. Allison grabs the book and climbs the stairs to the top of the building. Stark is in hot pursuit; he catches up to her on the roof, cornering her and claims that the child is there in Bucharest. He then asks her if she wonders why she was chosen and how she's been able to keep the Lexicon from creatures more powerful than her. He states that she is a \"nephalim\", a half-breed between an angel named \"Simon\" (a character from the first film) and a human, bred specifically to protect the Lexicon; therefore Allison is nothing more than a tool.\nDylan, who is feeling the effects of death more than ever, staggers to the roof; he is caught between them. Allison tells him to accept God's will on faith, but Stark is telling him to complete his task so he can be done with this miserable existence. Dylan is torn; he goes back and forth between them before shooting Allison repeatedly in the chest. Nevertheless, there was method in his madness; as Allison falls over the precipice, the pages of the Lexicon scatter everywhere.

Pride challenges Stripes to a racing match at a secret racetrack in the woods called the Blue Moon Races; he accepts, but loses the race.\nThe following day, Tucker, having secretly watched Stripes, approaches him and suggests that he gets proper training first. Stripes, in need of a rider, chooses 16-year-old Channing and convinces a new farm animal, a pelican named Goose (Joe Pantoliano), to sabotage Channing's motorcycle and Old Blue, Nolan's old pickup truck, so that Channing can ride him to her workplace at Turfway Park. The plan works, and Channing, with Nolan's reluctant approval, rides Stripes to Turfway Park. There, Channing is antagonized by her boss, Clara Dalrymple (Wendie Malick), for bringing Stripes to the racetrack, while Stripes meets a pair of horse-fly brothers, Buzz and Scuzz (Steve Harvey and David Spade).\nAs night approaches, Channing, remembering her first ride on horseback with her mother, Carolyn, completes a lap around the track with Stripes. They are approached by Woodzie (M. Emmet Walsh), a racetrack gambler and old friend of the family, who encourages Channing to sign her and Stripes up for a tryout race tomorrow. She does, despite Nolan's disapproval stemming from his wife's death in a racing accident six years ago, which discouraged him to continue training horses ever since, but Stripes has a major meltdown after being easily scared by the horse-gate like all the other horses the next morning at the tryouts. Once he calms down, he begins running, but then gets hit in the face by flying dirt while racing, causing Channing to fall off. Though she is uninjured, Nolan chastises and blames her. However, when Dalrymple mocks her riding skills, Nolan defends his daughter. In response, Dalrymple sarcastically signs Stripes up to compete in the Kentucky Open competition.\nMeanwhile, Stripes realizes he is a zebra after being told off by Sir Trenton, which severely discourages him. Despite Channing's pleas and Woodzie's encouragement, Nolan refuses to let her race Stripes. Realizing this, the farm animals lure Nolan into the farm to show him a table holding his past accomplishments, and he changes his mind. Meanwhile, due to Stripes' misbehavior during training, Franny reveals to Stripes that Tucker helped Nolan train the racehorse champions including Sir Trenton without getting any thanks, which encourages him to begin training.\nRefusing to allow Stripes to race, Sir Trenton and several thoroughbreds ambush Stripes and Sandy at a creek as they are talking and making up for their previous argument one night, kidnapping Sandy and threatening to hurt her if he races. The next day, after rescuing Stripes, Tucker, Franny, and Goose agree to rescue Sandy. With a little help from Buzz and Scuzz, the rescue is successful, and they get back in time for Stripes to go to the race.\nAt the race, Nolan bets Dalrymple that if Stripes wins, then he gets Sandy, and if he loses, then he will come back to work for her. During the race, Ruffshodd, and even his jockey, try to stop Stripes from winning until Scuzz gets them disqualified by biting Ruffshodd's rear-end. Later, Stripes begins to wear out until he finally remembers what Tucker taught him, \"Don't look back. Leave it all on the track,\" which boosts his confidence. Stripes wins the race and earns respect from the other racehorses, including Pride. In the end, they all pose together in a group photo, which is later shown with the other previous Walsh wins.", "tmdb_plot": "Shattered illusions are hard to repair -- especially for a good-hearted zebra named Stripes who's spent his life on a Kentucky farm amidst the sorely mistaken notion that he's a debonair thoroughbred.

Ted reflects on the better days of his life, when his mother (a former alcoholic) and sisters accepted him. He is shown placing a collect call to his mother, ultimately having the charges denied by his mother. Ted blames his homelessness and lack of family support on their prejudice against him for being homeless and an undesirable childhood. Ted describes his mother as a \"bar whore\" who often brought strange men home from the bar on the weekends and that at the age of 12, he was given his first beer by his mother at one of her many social gatherings.\nHis ability to \"do as he pleases\" by not having to answer to any authority figures, keeps him on the streets. Ted informs the filmmakers that he takes a lot of pride in his bicycle and is shown washing it at a car wash, although it has been over three months since he had a \"real\" shower. Through his recycling, Ted has befriended an 18-year-old Latino male named Michael (Mike), who works at the recycling plant.\nThe film shows Ted doing his daily dumpster-dive, collecting cans for the day's food, cigarettes and beer, when he finds a briefcase amongst the rubbish. Ted stops to brush it off and opens it up slowly and finds that it is stuffed with cash.  A note atop the money reads \"What would a homeless person do if he were given $100,000?\" Shocked and in tears, Ted comes to the realization that he is the recipient of a significant amount of money.\nTed almost immediately buys a new bicycle, rents a motel room and takes his buddy Mike to an amusement park. The word gets out among the homeless community and Ted, who once couldn't find a girlfriend due to his poor dental hygiene, now enjoys female companionship in his motel room. As soon as Ted notifies his mother and sisters of his attainment of wealth, they begin to take his calls and his mother invites him to stay with her until he finds his own residence. The family is shown discussing how they are concerned for Ted's welfare.\nA week after finding the money, and having spent over $2,000, Ted is still in the motel and is asked to speak with an advocate for the homeless. The counselor asks Ted what he thinks about having the money, to which Ted replies that he really hasn't thought about it much and that he has too much time on his hands now since he no longer has to recycle. Ted makes plans to leave for Sacramento to stay with his mother, but before leaving, he buys Mike a car and promises to fly his lady friend to Sacramento once he gets there and settled, exclaiming as he gets into the van to leave for the airport \"bang 'em and leave 'em\", referring to his recent activities with the woman.\nThe following weeks find Ted frequenting at the local bar, his spending averaging $10,000 a week. He then purchases a $35,000 Dodge Ram and another truck for one of his recently acquired girlfriends, rents an apartment and buys furniture. The filmmakers then request that he meet with a financial planner. Ted meets with him, but firmly announces to him that he has no intentions of working and does not wish to plan ahead as he is only concerned with today. Ted states his belief that the financial planner is only after his money and rips up his card.\nHis sisters repeatedly try to convince Ted to seek employment, although he still believes he is \"set for life\". By this time, Ted has become resentful to the film producers for giving him the money. The film then ends telling the viewer that, six months after finding the money, Ted refuses to disclose his latest bank balance; however, his sisters fear that it is less than $5,000.\nOn a December 1, 2006 airing of The Oprah Winfrey Show entitled: \"Are You Ready For a Windfall?\", Ted and filmmaker Wayne Powers were on the program to promote the documentary and speak on their account of the experiment. When asked by Oprah how much of the $100,000 he still had, Ted replied \"none.\" Ted also mentioned that he is homeless again, and content with his current circumstances.\nAs of July 2007, Ted was back in Pasadena and working for the same recycling plant shown in the film.", "tmdb_plot": "A documentary that explores what happens when a homeless man is given one hundred thousand dollars and the free will to do with it whatever his wishes.", "tmdb_id": "19524", "wiki_id": "6209126"}, {"title": "Revolver", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller", "Crime", "Mystery"], "wiki_plot": "Note: There are two different versions of Revolver. This plot synopsis is for Ritchie's preferred Directors Cut.\nIn an unidentified city, cockney gangster and gambler Jake Green (Jason Statham) is released from prison after a seven year stretch in solitary confinement for an unspecified crime. Because of this, Jake developed claustrophobia: he becomes incredibly anxious in tight spaces and despises riding in elevators.\nTwo years later, Jake and his brother Billy (Andrew Howard) travel to a casino owned by Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), a gang boss involved in illegal gambling all over the city. Macha is responsible for ordering Green to commit the crime that resulted in his prison sentence. Though Billy is reluctant, the brothers have arrived to collect the debt that Green believes the gangster owes them. Macha promptly calls them up to a private area of his casino where a high rollers' game is taking place. Jake bets a fortune on a chip toss with one of the table's players, and loses. Manipulating Macha into a sense of false security, he makes the same bet with him, but this time, he wins. Humiliated, Macha orders his right-hand man, Paul (Terrence Maynard) to have Jake murdered.\nAs Jake and his brothers leave the casino, a man (Vincent Pastore) hands Jake a card and tells him that he can help him. Jake's phobia forces him to take the stairs. In the stairwell, Jake looks at the card and collapses, falling down the stairs. The card is revealed to read \"Take the Elevator\". Jake is rushed to the hospital. The doctors report that they don't know why he fainted, but inform him they will have the results in a few days. Later Jake arrives home, without Billy, where Macha's assassin Sorter (Mark Strong) is waiting for him.\nOn his doorstep there is another card, which reads \"Pick This Up\". As Jake bends to retrieve the card bullets fly over his back. As the shooting continues, the same mysterious individual, a loan shark named Zach, arrives and rescues Jake, who is the only person to survive the hit. Zach introduces Jake to his partner, Avi (Andr\u00e9 Benjamin). They offer him a deal: they will take all of his money and he will do what they say, no questions asked. In exchange, they will protect Jake from Macha. In the course of their proposal, they show Jake his medical file, which they have mysteriously obtained. It indicates that the blackout occurred due to a rare blood disease which will cause his death within three days. Jake suspects he is being conned and leaves.\nLater, at a visit to his doctor, he is given the same prognosis and said to have three days to live. Jake returns to Avi and Zach's poolhall with a satchel of money and agrees to their terms. The mysterious men reveal that his money will be used to fund their money lending enterprise, then question Jake about his time in prison. Jake explains that he was given a choice to either spend 14 years in the general prison population or 7 years in solitary confinement, of which he chose the latter.\nDuring his stint in solitary confinement, Jake learns of a specific strategy (referred to as \"The Formula\") that is supposed to let its user win every game. The Formula itself was discovered by two unnamed men who inhabited adjacent cells on either side of Jake's own. They are referred to as a chess expert and a con man. During the first five years of his seven-year sentence, the three men communicate their thoughts on confidence tricks and chess moves via messages hidden inside library books, such as The Mathematics of Quantum Mechanics.\nThe chess expert and the con man plan to leave their cells simultaneously, and promise to take Jake with them. But when they disappear from their cells, they leave Jake behind to serve the remaining two years of his sentence. When Jake is released, he finds that all of his possessions and money have been taken by the two men with whom he had shared everything. Disheartened, he uses The Formula, to go about winning at various casinos. Jake garnered a reputation that led many gambling houses to fear his freakishly good 'luck', and is blacklisted by many casinos. The Formula applies to any game, and is often exemplified by Jake's apparent mastery of chess.\nMeanwhile, Macha brokers a cocaine deal with Lily Walker (Francesca Annis), the advisor of unseen crime kingpin Sam Gold, who is supposedly the \"ultimate figure\" that all other underworld members aspire to be. Walker warns Macha that Sam Gold is not someone to be delayed and emphasizes that he \"hates publicity\". Jake accompanies Avi and Zach as they perform a heist of a vault full of the cocaine from Macha's casino. Desperate that he is now indebted to Gold, Macha sends Paul to appeal to his rival, Triad kingpin Lord John (Tom Wu) to sell him replacement cocaine at a heavily inflated price. Lord John insultingly declines making a deal with his enemy. With Jake, Zach and Avi then rob John for millions of dollars; Framing Macha for the theft.\nFurious, Lord John sends a hitwoman dressed as a waitress to kill Macha at his restaurant. Sorter shoots the assassin, but only wounds her. Then he travels outside and kills her getaway driver as he attempts to flee in a car. Inside, Macha struggles with the hitwoman, during which she shoots his finger off. In a rage, Macha empties his bodyguard's pistol into the assassin. In retaliation, Macha has Sorter kill Lord John, then sends Paul and his henchmen to interrogate members of John's triad to find the location of the stolen cocaine. The Chinese gangsters deny any involvement, and implicate Jake even when Paul tortures them to death.\nZach and Avi have Jake donate all the money he has given them so far to a child's charity in Macha's name. Macha takes the credit, believing it will improve his reputation. However, he is later visited by Walker, who claims that Gold is furious at Macha's newfound publicity and his constant delaying of the deal. Macha pleads for more time to settle business but Walker simply leaves with a cryptic threat.\nThree days after Jake found out about his terminal diagnoses, he awakes to a call from Avi, who tells him he is \"free\" of his disease.  Jake returns to his physician, who reveals that the original diagnosis was incorrect; Jake suffers from a rare blood disease, but it is treatable and not terminal. The doctor apologizes profusely for the mistake. Meanwhile, Macha, now believing Jake is the one conspiring against him, doubles down on the contract against him. His henchmen track him down to a house inhabited by Avi and Zach, but he evades them. In the chase, one of the hitmen falls on his shotgun and dies. The gangsters misinterpret this accident, and believe that Jake killed him.\nJake meets Avi and Zach on a rooftop, where it is revealed that they were Jake's \"neighbors\" during his years of incarceration. They reveal that Sam Gold is an ultimately powerless cipher, whose power is granted only by those who invest in him. He represents ego and is the personification of greed. Avi attempts to get Jake to understand the nature of the ego and to challenge his own lifelong investment in it. The men explain to Jake that by stripping him of the physical embodiment of ego (his money) they have freed him from Gold's \"game\" - It is heavily implied that \"Avi\" and \"Zach\" are merely figments of Jake's imagination.\nElsewhere, to settle a debt with Macha, Jake's brother Billy is betrayed by his bodyguard, who lets Sorter and Paul into Billy's home. Paul tortures Billy, threatens to kidnap Billy's daughter and set him on fire in order to find out where Jake is. The violent acts unsettle Sorter, and allow him to find his conscience. Against his better judgement, he rejects his ego by killing Paul and all his companions to rescue the girl.\n(Note: In the theatrical release, Sorter is killed and the girl is taken.)\nThat night, an armed Jake breaks into the penthouse where Macha is sleeping. Surprisingly, he kneels before the bed and asks a half naked Macha for forgiveness. Jake leaves in the elevator, which gets stuck at the 13th floor. Macha retrieves his own handgun, and rushes down the stairs to meet Jake on the ground floor. While waiting in the elevator, Jake has a conversation in his mind in which he rejects his ego. By doing this, Jake steps off the proverbial chess board by making a conscious effort to reverse everything his ego tells him to do. This is seen to be the truest and most fundamental application of the Formula.\nAs the doors open on Jake and he is about to leave the building, Macha holds him at gunpoint, but a calm Jake refuses to fear him. He leaves Macha a crying, pathetic mess, weeping in the foyer of his penthouse - Jake has rejected the ego, where as Macha has been seen to be consumed by it, resulting in his humiliation.\n(Note: This is where the Director's Cut ends.)\nIn the theatrical release of the film, Jake finds out about the niece's kidnapping and decides to return the crime bosses money to save her. When he arrives, Macha points a gun on Jake's niece, but Jake shows no fear. A humiliated Macha remarks that Jake can't kill him if he is already dead.

Using the same conditions as before, a second team under Mori's and Kanzaki's leadership is to be sent into the past and recover Matoba's unit; Kashima is to act as an observer and liaison to Matoba. Kashima refuses to participate, but then Linuma Shichibei (Kazuki Kitamura), the samurai who had appeared after Matoba's unit had been sent back in time, seeks him out and asks him what he is actually living for when he is not interested in saving the world. This challenge rekindles Kashima's interest, and he agrees to come along.\nAs the recovery team arrives, they rescue a youth by the name of Tosuke (Akiyoshi Nakao), but also come under attack by both samurai and modern weapons, and, with some help from Shichibei (whose lord, Sait\u014d D\u014dsan, had allied himself with the attackers) they are quickly captured. The survivors are brought to nearby Mount Anmo, where a castle has been erected which bears somewhat improvised, but clearly anachronistic features like an oil refinery. Soon, they meet the leader of the army, Oda Nobunaga \u2013 who is actually Matoba, who has grown resentful of his own time period and intends to write Japan's history anew. Matoba has established himself as a warlord and assumed Nobunaga's identity after having killed him during one of his first battles. Now, using a battery from the magnetic shield as a kit-bashed nuclear device, he plans to make Mount Fuji erupt, thereby eradicating the Kansai region and establishing himself as supreme Sh\u014dgun. He approaches Kashima with the offer to participate, but the latter firmly refuses.\nIn the meantime, Shichibei learns that his lord has wed his daughter, N\u014dhime (for whom the young samurai seems to feel more than respectful reverence) to the warlord and that the new arrivals are to be executed. While Shichibei is wracked with self-doubt about the fate of his benefactors, his own experiences in the future and the duty to his lord, Tosuke manages to sneak inside the fortress, where he comes in contact with N\u014dhime. When she learns of his resolve, she encourages Shichibei to follow his own heart and secretly prepares to free the prisoners.\nThe next morning, Kashima is to fight Shichibei for the freedom of himself and his men, but before a deadly blow can be struck, Shichibei tries to convince his lord to turn away from Matoba. Just as Sait\u014d D\u014dsan orders Shichibei\u2019s death, Tosuke uses a commandeered APC to provide the soldiers a route of escape and their weapons. They manage to snatch the majority of their equipment, but Major Mori is killed covering Kashima\u2019s and Kanzaki\u2019s escape, and Kanzaki herself is recaptured. With just about 21 hours left to return to their own time period, the surviving JSDF soldiers nevertheless decide to return to Anmo to stop Matoba. In the course of their planning, Kashima learns that Tosuke is actually Toyotomi Hideyoshi \u2013 a name which gives him hope for the future again. Soon, Shichibei returns to plead to his lord one final time and finally succeeds by appealing to a father\u2019s love for his daughter, while Tosuke is sent to the emperor for an official authorization to declare Nobunaga a traitor.\nThe next morning, Sait\u014d D\u014dsan returns to Anmo with fake news that Kashima and the remaining soldiers are headed for Kyoto to ask the emperor for assistance. Taking the bait, Matoba has the majority of his forces move out. As soon as this is done, Kashima and a group of his men, assisted by D\u014dsan\u2019s samurai, conduct acts of sabotage and attack the castle guards. Kashima fights his way to Matoba, who is just about to launch the bomb, and finally manages to kill him, but the bomb is still set to explode.\nAs the oil refinery is destroyed, the explosion triggers an earthquake which destroys the castle. Kashima and Kanzaki are \u2013 along with the bomb \u2013 evacuated by helicopter and quickly brought to the point of entry, where Kashima hopes that the electromagnetic effects created by the time shift will cause the timer to stop.

The lovers slash her throat in the ensuing struggle. Mortally wounded, Raina stumbles into a pool of water, floating helplessly.\nSeventeen months pass, and four friends decide to rent out the long-abandoned beach house together, completely unaware of its dark history. The four are couples, and are secretly cheating on each other.

Through both stories, it can be surmised that, immediately following the accident, Matt told Nichola to flee to Mexico, promising to come rescue her once the entire problem was resolved. When the police arrived, however, Matt told them that Nichola had inflicted the wound on Raina, and that she had stolen quite a good deal of property. Thus, Nichola was stranded in Mexico and had taken the entire rap for the accident. Angry, she sneaks back over the border to seek revenge.\nMeanwhile, Kirsten realizes that she has been acting quite strangely, and feels a strange connection to Raina. Murry explains that this is not demonic possession, as it may appear, but Raina is merely making Kirsten feel what she feels. This leads to several instances of Kirsten acting quite strangely. For example, when Nichola tries to explain to the couple her side of the story, an enraged Kirsten blows up on her, and the two scuffle. Also, she has a vision of killing her ex-boyfriend Oliver, as he long ago allegedly cheated on her. This connection is vital to the storyline, as it compels Kirsten and Oliver to solve this problem, not retreat from it.\nKirsten and Oliver learn that Raina did not actually die, but is in a coma in a nearby hospital.

Disoriented, she staggers for the beach house for the final confrontation. In a heated finale, Matt attacks Kirsten, who is saved by Oliver, and Raina is finally able to confront Matt.

She assumes it is not serious and runs after the driver, but all she finds is a watch strangely identical to that of No-young's. When she gets home, she knocks at No-young's door and confronts him about his watch. No-young shrugs it off and is playful; however, once he gets inside his apartment, he takes off his shirt, revealing a bullet wound to the camera. Jae-in does not know of this, but she suspects that No-young is also undercover as a spy.\nJae-in increasingly becomes more suspicious of No-young, although she is still head-over-heels about him. One day she challenges him to a Judo match during a physical education class at school. During the match, they vocally argue, although none of their classmates or the teacher seems to notice; by the end of the match, they both know of each other's real position as undercover agents. Jae-in thereafter confesses to Seung-hee that she is not really a schoolgirl, which in turn gets Seung-hee very upset.\nJae-in then receives news: her beloved uncle has been stabbed by an unknown person. She sobs, overcome with grief at the loss of her only family. The camera then shows her with Seung-hee in a car with a fellow policeman. The policeman betrays Jae-in and Seung-hee and leads them to the site where Cha Young-jae has been captured and is meeting with a rival gang leader. No-young arrives, and Jae-in teams up with him to fight off everyone. Jae-in goes to capture the rival gang leader; however, as she is handcuffing him, a gun is put to her head. She turns to see the undercover teacher, who was supposed to be on her side. He reveals to her that he was the one who stabbed her uncle, and she becomes overcome with rage. Meanwhile, No-young is wounded and running out of energy; as an undercover spy, he cannot reveal himself, for he would get caught. He slips away quietly as Jae-in punches the undercover teacher again and again. A police officer finally handcuffs the undercover teacher and leads him away. Cha Young-jae is sent off to an emergency room in an ambulance with Seung-hee, and Jae-in receives news that her uncle will get better.\nThe movie then cuts to a scene where Jae-in is undercover once again. It has been some time since the Cha Young-jae case, although the movie does not specifically say how long. This time, Jae-in is undercover as a singing nun. She bolts after a criminal down alleys and streets; finally, when she catches up with the criminal, she realizes he has already been knocked out by someone. She looks around and discovers No-young.

The aging matron of the house, Violet Devereaux, needs help looking after her husband Benjamin, who was mostly paralyzed by an apparent stroke. At the insistence of the family's estate lawyer, Luke Marshall, Caroline accepts the position.\nAfter Ben attempts to escape his room during a storm, Caroline investigates the house's attic, where Violet said Ben suffered his stroke; she uses a skeleton key which Violet gave her. She discovers a secret room filled with ritual paraphernalia. Caroline confronts Violet, who reveals that the room used to belong to two African American servants who were employed at the house 90 years before. The servants, Mama Cecile and Papa Justify, were renowned hoodoo practitioners; they were lynched after conducting a ritual with the owners' two children, from whom Violet and Ben later bought the house. Violet tells Caroline that they keep no mirrors in the house because they see reflections of Cecile and Justify in them. Caroline borrows a phonograph record from the attic: Conjure of Sacrifice, a recording of Papa Justify reciting a hoodoo ritual.\nCaroline surmises that Ben's stroke was caused by hoodoo, but believes that his paralytic state is a nocebo effect induced by his own belief, rather than something supernatural. Taking advice from her friend Jill, Caroline visits a hidden hoodoo shop in a nearby laundromat, where a hoodoo woman gives her tools and instructions to cure Ben. After she conducts the ritual, Ben regains some ability to move and speak and he begs Caroline to get him away from Violet.\nCaroline tells Luke she is suspicious of Violet, but he remains skeptical. They travel to a gas station that Caroline previously noted was lined with brick dust, which she was told is a hoodoo defense; supposedly, no one who means one harm can pass a line of brick dust. She asks one of the proprietors, a blind woman, about the Conjure of Sacrifice, which she learns is a spell wherein the caster steals the remaining years of life from the victim. Increasingly convinced of hoodoo's authenticity, Caroline fears that Violet will soon cast the spell on Ben.\nCaroline discovers that Violet is unable to pass a line of brick dust laid across one of the house's doorways, confirming her suspicions. She incapacitates Violet and attempts to escape the house with Ben, but the front gate is chained shut. Caroline hides Ben on the property and enters Luke's office for help. Luke, revealed to be Violet's accomplice, brings Caroline back to the house. Caroline escapes, gets into a fight with Violet, and violently pushes her down the stairs, breaking her legs in the process. With strategic use of brick dust, Caroline flees to the attic, calls 9-1-1 and Jill for help, and casts what she believes is a protective spell. Violet, having caught up with her, reveals she actually trapped herself inside a protective circle. Violet pushes a full-length mirror at Caroline, which reflects the original owner's daughter, then Violet, and lastly Mama Cecile. A recording of the Conjure of Sacrifice plays, and the two switch bodies.\nViolet (revealed to be Mama Cecile, who had been occupying Violet's body through the Conjure) wakes up in Caroline's body, and force-feeds Caroline (now in Violet's body) a potion that induces a stroke-like paralytic state like Ben's. Luke (actually Papa Justify) arrives upstairs, revealing that Mama Cecile and Papa Justify have been conducting the Conjure of Sacrifice on new people since their supposed deaths; they had swapped places with the two children just before the lynching. Because hoodoo is supposedly only effective on those who believe in it, Cecile and Justify had to wait for Caroline to come to believe in hoodoo through her own investigation.\nEmergency services arrive the next morning and take Caroline and Ben away, trapped in the paralyzed dying bodies; when Jill arrives, \"Luke\" tells her that the Devereauxes left the house to Caroline, ensuring that Cecile and Justify will continue to occupy the house.", "tmdb_plot": "A hospice nurse working at a spooky New Orleans plantation home finds herself entangled in a mystery involving the house's dark past.", "tmdb_id": "9913", "wiki_id": "2096043"}, {"title": "Sky Fighters", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure"], "wiki_plot": "At the Farnborough Airshow, a rogue group hijacks a Mirage 2000-10 after killing its pilot.

When Neuman mentions Loki's imprisonment at his father Odin's hands, a stranger becomes furious and transforms, revealing himself to be Loki. The tourists panic and flee, but Neuman stays to argue with Loki, who takes the mask in the display case, only to realize it is a replica. In anger, he removes Neuman's face and puts it in the case, disposes of the arriving authorities, and storms out of the museum.\nIn Fringe City, the real mask is found in a river by a dog named Otis, who belongs to Tim Avery. An aspiring animator, Tim is reluctant to accept parenthood with his wife, Tonya. On a tropical island, Loki is relaxing until Odin orders him to resume the search for the mask, believing it has caused too much chaos for mankind. Loki asks his father for help, but Odin says that he has to take responsibility for his actions. Tim puts on the mask for his studio's Halloween party, and becomes a green-faced party animal who can magically alter his surroundings. When the party turns out to be a bore, Tim uses his newfound powers to perform a remix of \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\", invigorating the event and giving Tim's boss, Daniel Moss, the inspiration for a new cartoon.\nThat night, Tim returns to his house and has sex with Tonya, while still wearing the mask. A baby is conceived, and is born with the same powers as the mask, which alerts Odin. Possessing a store clerk, Odin informs Loki and tells him that if he finds the child, he will find the mask. Months later, Tonya goes on a business trip, leaving Tim with their son Alvey. Tim, now promoted, desperately tries to work on his cartoon at home, but is continuously disrupted by Alvey. To get some peace and quiet, Tim lets Alvey watch various cartoons on television, which inspire Alvey to torment his father using his powers. Otis, who has been feeling neglected by Tim, accidentally dons the mask, gains its power, and tries to get rid of Alvey, but his attempts are foiled by the craftier infant.\nLeaving a trail of mayhem in his wake, Loki finds Alvey and confronts Tim for the mask, but Alvey uses his powers to protect his father. Odin, possessing Tim's body, scolds Loki's destructive approach and strips him of his powers. Tim is later fired after failing to impress Moss during a pitch but reconciles and bonds with Alvey. Loki, determined to please his father, sneaks into the Avery household and completes a summoning ritual and appeals to Odin to restore his powers. Odin agrees, but only for a limited time, stating this is his last chance.\nLoki kidnaps Alvey in exchange for the mask. Tonya returns home and goes with Tim and Otis, to whom Tim had apologized for his negligence, to make the exchange.

They have mimeographed more than they can distribute through the mail. Hans proposes distributing the extras at university the next day; despite Willi arguing that the risks are unacceptable, Hans says that he will take full responsibility, and Sophie volunteers to assist. The next day, at the main building of Munich University where classes are in session, Hans and Sophie set about putting down stacks of leaflets near the doors of lecture rooms. With only minutes left until the period ends, Sophie runs to the top floor, where she impulsively pushes a stack of leaflets over the edge of the balustrade. A janitor who saw Sophie scatter the leaflets detains the pair until the Gestapo arrive to arrest them.\nThe siblings are taken to the Munich Stadelheim Prison, where Sophie is interrogated by Gestapo investigator Robert Mohr. Claiming initially to be apolitical, she presents an alibi: she and her brother had nothing to do with the fliers. She noticed them in the hall and pushed a stack off the railing as a prank, and she had an empty suitcase because she was going to visit her parents in Ulm and planned to bring back some clothes. She is dismissed, but as her release form is about to be approved, the order comes not to let her go, as the Gestapo has found incontrovertible evidence that Sophie and Hans were indeed responsible for the distribution of anti-Nazi leaflets. She is placed in a prison cell with fellow dissident Else Gebel, a Communist sympathiser.\nSophie concedes her part, controverting her brother's claim he acted alone. However, determined to protect the others, she steadfastly maintains that the production and distribution of thousands of copies of leaflets in cities throughout the region were entirely the work of the siblings. Mohr, having learned that her father was an imprisoned as a dissident, admonishes her to support the laws that preserve order in a society that has funded her welfare and education. Scholl counters that before 1933 the laws protected freedom of speech and denounces atrocities committed by the Nazis, including against the mentally deficient, that she saw working as a nurse for the regime. Mohr dismisses some of her accusations, such as the extermination of the Jews, as wartime propaganda and tacitly approves of others, such as the euthanasia program, remarking that \"the new Europe can only be National Socialist\".\nSophie and her brother, as well as a married friend with three young children, Christoph Probst, are charged with treason, troop demoralization and abetting the enemy. In the subsequent show trial, Probst is the first to be examined by President of the People's Court Roland Freisler, whose prosecutorial zeal makes the nominal prosecutor and defense attorneys superfluous. Freisler contemptuously dismisses Probst's appeals to spare his life so that his children can have a father. Hans maintains his composure in the face of Freisler's increasingly impatient questioning. Declining to answer only what he is asked, he highlights German war crimes on the Eastern Front as immoral and proclaims that the defeat of the Nazi state by the Allies have been made all but certain; all Hitler can do is prolong the war. In her own examination, Sophie dismisses the suggestion that she was led by her brother, and declares that many people agree with what she and her group have said and written, but dare not express it. Freisler pronounces the three defendants guilty and calls on each to make a brief final statement. Sophie warns that \"where we stand today, you [Freisler] will stand soon.\" All three are routinely sentenced to death.\nSophie, having been told of the general 99 day delay between conviction and execution, learns that she is to be executed the same day. She breaks down briefly, but regains composure and authors a final statement and receives the blessing of the prison chaplain, who subtly offers his moral support for her silence in face of interrogation. After a visit by her parents, who also express approval of what she has done, Mohr arrives and sadly watches Sophie taken away to death row. Soon after, she is led into a cell where Christoph and Hans await, and they share a final cigarette. Probst remarks, sincerely, that their actions were not in vain. As Sophie is led into a courtyard by the executioners, she remarks, \"The sun is still shining\". Grace is refused, and she is the first to be beheaded in the guillotine, the blade falling as the picture goes black and Hans' and Christoph's executions follow.

In the special car where under high security travels the minister of the tsarist government \u2013 Adjutant-General Khrapov \u2013 a man appears who introduces himself as state councilor Erast Fandorin, an official for special assignments to the Moscow governor-general responsible for Khrapov's security in Moscow. The arriving person presents his documents and because he matches the verbal portrait of Fandorin with which the guards are familiar, he is let in to see the general. Soon the general is found dead in the compartment and on the handle of a bloody blade there is a mark \"BG\" \u2013 the sign of the elusive terrorist \"Combat Group\" which wreaks terror in both capitals. The terrorist who impersonated Fandorin \u2013 head of the \"BG\" nicknamed Green \u2013 successfully disappears from the scene of the crime and settles in Moscow with three accomplices, Rakhmet, Emelya and Snegir, where the local revolutionary, Needle, helps them.

Fandorin, famous for his deductive method, starts an investigation and the first clue comes from the terrorists themselves: from the circumstances of the case it is clear that the killers knew who provides the security of the general and had a description of Fandorin. Fandorin was appointed responsible for Khrapov's visit only the day before, and this was only known to the St. Petersburg Police Department and three employees of the Moscow gendarmerie. Obviously it was only this narrow circle of people who could have leaked the information.\nFandorin investigates and manages to detain one of the members of the group, Rakhmet, who was quickly removed from the investigation by the celebrated investigator, General Prince Pozharsky, who came specially from Petersburg with a nominal command. In the meantime, BG continues to operate, this time replenishing the party cash desk: the treasury coach has been robbed, security has been broken, and a huge amount of money has been stolen. Fandorin decides to find out who is passing information to BG by giving all suspects different information and checking how the terrorists react. The completely unexpected reaction of BG forces Fandorin to suspect even his own beloved for a moment, but he still finds the correct, albeit incredible, answer to his question.

Now, after the provoked retirement of Dolgorutsky, the Moscow Governor-General will become the Grand Duke Simeon, the patron of Pozharsky, and Pozharsky himself will rise to the rank of a Moscow Chief Policeman. Fandorin can not openly speak out against Pozharsky: they just would not believe him. Pozharsky suggests that Fandorin become an ally, or simply \"step aside and remain silent\". Fandorin chooses the latter, because unlike Pozharsky, he knows that Green had already guessed about the betrayal of his assistant, Julie Renard, through whom Pozharsky slipped the group information about the objects of the terrorist attacks, and Green forced Julie to make an appointment with Pozharsky. As a result, Pozharsky goes on the call of Julie to destroy Green and gain the laurels of the sole winner of the Combat Group, and Fandorin merely tells him in a whisper: \"Evil devours itself.\" And thus it indeed happens: Pozharsky kills Green and Julie, but he himself also dies with Needle who sabotaged him and herself, before death to whom he refers by real name \u2013 Countess Dobrinskaya.\nThe new governor-general offers Fandorin the post of chief policeman and his patronage.

This sparks controversy over a machine's inability to make moral decisions versus humans' struggle to overcome ego.\nThe team is training EDI in air combat maneuvers when it is unexpectedly reassigned to kill the heads of three terrorist cells at a conference in downtown Rangoon. EDI calculates that mission success can be achieved only through a vertical strike, which could cause a human pilot to black out. Command orders EDI to attack but Gannon ignores the order, successfully carrying out the strike himself.\nAs the team returns to the Lincoln, EDI is hit by lightning, which reprograms its neural patterns. Though EDI is discovered to be learning exponentially, developing a rudimentary ethical code and an ego, Cummings refuses to take it offline. During a mission to destroy stolen nuclear warheads in Tajikistan, Wade realizes that the nuclear debris will cause significant collateral damage.  The human pilots abort, but EDI defies orders and destroys the warheads, causing extensive radioactive fallout and civilian casualties as anticipated.\nCummings orders the unit return to base but EDI refuses. Gannon orders that EDI be shot down. In the ensuing dogfight, Purcell crashes when a missile he fires at EDI explodes on a mountain, blinding him. Wade's plane is damaged by debris from the same explosion, which triggers her plane's auto-destruct, forcing her to eject over North Korea. Gannon must alone stop EDI from executing a twenty-year-old war scenario called \"Caviar Sweep\" that requires attacking Russia.\nGannon chases EDI into Russian territory where they defeat several Russian Su-37s over Lake Baikal. Both planes are damaged so Gannon calls a truce with EDI in order to keep both of them from falling into enemy hands and to be able to rescue Wade from North Korea. Cummings instructs Gannon to make an emergency landing with EDI in Alaska. Accountable for ignoring EDI's behavior and facing court-martial, Cummings seeks to eliminate witnesses by leaving Wade stranded in North Korea \u2013 where she is being pursued by the Korean People's Army as she heads to the Korean Demilitarized Zone \u2013 and by ordering Gannon eliminated in Alaska, where EDI's data will also be erased.\nGannon's Talon crash lands at the Alaska base. Suspecting Cummings' treachery, he narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by a doctor, who tries to inject him with a supposed tetanus serum. As the pair struggle, the doctor is injected with the substance and dies. Meanwhile, when Orbit places EDI into an interface, the AI expresses regret for its transgressions. Orbit realizes that EDI has developed sentience, and he is unwilling to erase EDI's memory. Gannon uses EDI's weapons systems to decimate the armed personnel, allowing Orbit to safely flee, then flies off to North Korea in EDI's plane, contacting the Lincoln's skipper, Captain Dick Marshfield, to inform him about Cummings' deceit. Marshfield confronts Cummings, who dies of suicide while leaving a voicemail message to his financial contact, Ray.\nGannon finds the injured and embattled Wade nearing the border. He and EDI land and he runs to her aid. Out of ammunition and taking damage from a Mi-8 helicopter, EDI sacrifices itself by ramming the helicopter, destroying both. This allows Gannon and Wade to cross on foot into South Korea, where they are rescued.\nAfter attending Purcell's funeral, Gannon awkwardly expresses his feelings of love to Wade.\nIn a post-credits scene, in the debris-strewn border between North and South Korea, EDI's \"brain\" is seen turning back on.", "tmdb_plot": "Deeply ensconced in a top-secret military program, three pilots struggle to bring an artificial intelligence program under control ... before it initiates the next world war.", "tmdb_id": "10048", "wiki_id": "2010744"}, {"title": "Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story", "genres": ["Action", "Adventure", "Animation", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "The film opens with the premiere of the film, with celebrities such as Drew Barrymore and her date the Kool-Aid Man, the Greased-Up Deaf Guy, the Evil Monkey, David Bowie, and the Griffin family attending.

Immediately afterward, a man armed with a one-handed sledgehammer and a number of long spikes is engaged in hand-to-hand combat with a zombie, which he ultimately kills by overpowering it and driving a spike into its head with his hammer.  His name is revealed to be \"Matool\". He then sees another zombie approaching him, which appears to annoy him more than frighten him.  He is also shown being extremely protective of his glasses, since zombies have overrun the world and he might find it difficult to acquire another pair.\nAs the opening credits roll, short clips are shown of Matool running around the deserted streets of Albuquerque, New Mexico, while Nathan is driving his pickup on those same streets, showing that the city is devoid of human life.\nAfterward, a young woman is shown trapped in her car by a group of ravenous zombies outside, while her male companion is pulled down and devoured.  Matool hears this and utters \"Fuck yeah!\" while rushing off to her rescue.  Though she is obviously reluctant, she allows herself to be saved, but Matool is forced to resort to carrying her, as she is overcome by panic.  They take refuge in a rundown, abandoned house, which is already occupied by a middle-aged man and two young boys.  The older man, Mr. Rainville, seems not to be bothered much by what is happening outside, and neither does one of his young friends, but the other boy does not speak at all or show any kind of emotion.  After some amusing introductions, Matool inquires as to the identity of the man who was just killed, and the young woman replies that it was her brother, much to Matool's joy, but she is incensed by his subtle advances, and still believes that they can save her now-dead brother.  Rainville continues to do nothing but sit and watch as all this happens, though he does not hesitate to jump in with a witty comment about he's \"not going to fuck you either\" to Matool, mocking his attempts to get the young lady in bed.  The woman then loses it and tries to leave to save her brother, but is pulled down and devoured by several zombies while Matool has no choice but to run.  Rainville and one of the boys are eaten alive, but the quiet one simply hides, showing no emotion whatsoever.\nAs Matool runs, Nathan hits him with the door of his truck.  Matool later wakes up bound in the back of Nathan's truck as they arrive at Nathan's house in the mountains near the city. Also in the truck is the quiet boy who Rainville had taken in (though the purposes for which he did so are implied to be carnal in nature).  After being taken inside, he is cut loose, welcomed, allowed to bathe, and is bluntly informed that Nathan and Dexy have an alternative lifestyle, which involves Nathan watching while other men engage in sexual activity with Dexy.  Matool is intrigued by this and goes along with the idea, but their first time, Dexy's sister Sassy smacks his bare rear with a ruler, surprising Matool, who is even more surprised when he sees that this new woman has a mutated human face on her side, the result of some kind of conjoined twins situation (the face appears to be self-aware, and is named Dottie).  Matool apologizes for freaking out, seeing that Sassy is very sensitive.\nAfter a few days, during which Matool gets used to his new surroundings, and after a few fights with zombies lurking outside, Nathan and Matool become fast friends, and Matool is shown a shed behind the house where Nathan keeps a naked female zombie that he likes to \"look at\", prompting Matool to remark \"Yeah, she'd be pretty fucking hot if she weren't decomposing.\"\nShortly thereafter, a small group of soldiers arrive in the rain.  Two are carrying a third, who is badly injured.  Their leader is Mandel, the other is Vega, and the wounded man is Sepulveda, who talk their way inside.  A flashback reveals that they were part of a larger unit surviving on the roads after the zombies overran civilization until a zombie attack (including what they call 'hyperzombies, which can move faster than normal zombies) cost them two soldiers (one, a male, was eaten alive and another, a female, was dragged screaming under their truck), and wounded Sepulveda.  Mandel becomes acquainted with Matool who tells him that the house is well-supplied, has power from an electrical generator, a well, as well as \"more\".  Sepulveda is placed in an unoccupied bedroom where Mandel and Vega take turns watching him, knowing that death and reanimation are inevitable.  Also, Vega becomes acquainted with Sassy, who later admits to Mandel and Matool that the face on her side is \"disturbingly sexy\" (prompting Matool to call him \"disturbingly weird\").\nLater, Mandel and Vega begin having sex with Dexy while Nathan watches, causing him obvious frustration, leading him to, while the others are having breakfast, sneak back to his shed and have rough sex with his chained female zombie.  A flashback reveals that the female zombie was one of two survivors who had arrived sometime earlier (the other being a male), who, after seeing Dexy's attraction to them both, shot the man and strangled the woman, keeping her for sexual purposes.\nAs the days pass, Vega and Sassy begin a relationship, while Sepulveda continues to die in agony, while Mandel resists Matool's suggestion that he be put down right away.  Nathan and Matool continue to fight and destroy zombies (Nathan with a Beretta pistol, Matool with his trademark hammer and spikes) as they show up at the house.\nThings inevitably fall apart, however, as the quiet boy who has not yet said a word begins feeling an attraction towards Dexy, and takes Nathan's keys and frees his female zombie, leaving it contained in the shed.  Meanwhile, Sepulveda wakes up and sees Sassy for the first time, as well as her conjoined twin, freaking out at how disgusting it is, causing Sassy to lose it and kill him with a pair of scissors.  Mandel, who was watching Sepulveda, instinctively shoots Sassy, killing her.  Nathan goes out to the shed for a tryst, but is killed and devoured by his zombie companion.  Meanwhile, Matool, Mandel, and Vega take Sassy and Sepulveda's bodies out before they reanimate as zombies, while attempting to reassure Dexy that it was \"an accident\".  Matool smashes Sassy's head with a cinder block over Vega's objections who is then attacked and killed by a reanimated Sepulveda.\nAs more zombies begin to gather at the house, Matool demands that Mandel go back into the house to get his MP5 submachine gun, but he can't, as the boy has locked them out.  Mandel then kills the Sepulveda zombie with his knife.  Then they head to the shed to find Nathan.  They open the door and see him being devoured by his female zombie and proceed to lock her back in.  As more and more zombies arrive, Mandel punches Matool, claiming Dexy as his own, but Matool fights back.  As they fight, they find themselves surrounded and are forced to run down the same road to escape.  Dexy, meanwhile, looks out the window as the zombies approach the door while the boy comes up to her, still not speaking or expressing any emotion.

The girl states that she has always been on the execution stand, if not for her, then for her mother.\nMitsuko is a twelve-year-old girl whose father is the sexually deviant principal of her school. After noticing that Mitsuko had seen her parents having sex, Gozo summons her to his office at school, has her climb into a cello case with a peephole, then has sex with her mother Sayuri without her knowing her daughter is watching. Shortly after, Gozo rapes Mitsuko, which is discovered by Sayuri. Afterward, Gozo has sex with Sayuri, with Mitsuko still watching in the cello case. Gozo then reveals to Sayuri that Mitsuko has been watching for a long time. He then coerces Sayuri into the cello case to watch him rape her daughter.\nMitsuko has issues separating her identity from her mother. Because she is forced to both have sex with Gozo and watch her mother having sex with him, she begins to disassociate and takes on the role of her mother. As a result of the infidelity, rape, and incest, Sayuri becomes abusive toward Mitsuko. During one violent encounter, Mitsuko knocks her down the stairs. Sayuri apologizes but ultimately dies from the fall. Alone with her incestuous father, Mitsuko takes on the identity of the 35-year-old Sayuri, going to school and having sex with her father as Sayuri would have. After another breakdown, Mitsuko attempts suicide by throwing herself off a ledge. She survives the fall and is reliant on a wheelchair. Gozo tells Mitsuko that she needs to keep their little secret.\nIt is then revealed that this tale is being written by a reclusive wheelchair-using writer, Taeko. She takes an interest in the new assistant, Y\u00fbji Tamiya, asking him to read the story, one of many exclusively about Mitsuko. She is protective over a red door in her studio, not allowing anyone to enter. She asks Y\u00fbji to take her on a walk and he takes her up to a hill in Aobadai. There, she dismisses him and wheels herself up a hill, only to stand, collapse it, and walk away with it in tow. When she returns home, she enters the red room and we find that it is completely filthy with a cello case at its center that she talks to. She adopts a disguise and goes out shopping, purposely driving away some girls gossiping about her while reading her books. Taeko's editor tells Y\u00fbji that Taeko is faking her paralysis, and asks him to spy on her so they can have a good scoop for their magazine. Y\u00fbji agrees.\nMeanwhile, Mitsuko is having trouble adjusting to life in a wheelchair. She is ignored by her classmates and Gozo neglects her in favor of having sex with various women he keeps around the house. In the present, inside Mitsuko's red room, she is sloppily eating spaghetti while writing her novel on top of the cello case. She forces food into the hole, before celebrating the completion of her novel.\nY\u00fbji is revealed to have a giant mural dedicated to Taeko. We see him at a body modification support group, where he reveals surgery he had to \"be a vase that compliments the flowers [that reflect his soul].\"\nMitsuko finds her mother's lost earring but one of Gozo's women takes it and swallows it to spite her, causing Mitsuko to have another breakdown. Due to this, Gozo ends up storing her in the cello case once again.\nTaeko celebrates finishing her novel by presenting it to Y\u00fbji, then taking a trip to the beach with him. While on the train ride, they spot someone with a cello case and she comments on it. Y\u00fbji reveals he was told that being raped was akin to being only a torso. He offers the suggestion to turn both Mitsuko and Gozo into torsos at the end of the novel. Taeko loves the idea.\nThe viewer is put into the point of view of Sayuri, bound and gagged inside the cello case that Taeko and Y\u00fbji spotted on the train earlier.\nTaeko wakes up in a hotel room with Y\u00fbji, unable to remember how she got there. When they go for a walk, Taeko spots a bathing suit and asks Y\u00fbji to buy it for her. While he's inside the shop, the man with the cello case from the train approaches her and she starts screaming. Y\u00fbji manages to get him to leave. Once again in the hotel room, Taeko asks Y\u00fbji to put the bathing suit on her, citing his infamous lack of libido as why she feels safe asking him to do this. Afterward, she is put to bed by Y\u00fbji and she dreams of the Strange Circus, with a nude, bloodied Sayuri laying in the center of the room.\nWhen she wakes up, she notices that she had a nosebleed. She finds Y\u00fbji asleep on the bed, and decides to get up and sneak into the bathroom to clean herself up. While she's doing that, Y\u00fbji wakes up and sneaks a page of her manuscript into her purse. He manages to get back into position, feigning sleep, right before she reenters the room. She climbs back into bed and wakes up Y\u00fbji, with both pretending to just wake up, and asks to be taken home.\nIn the red room, she \"serves dinner\" to the cello case. She receives a call from Y\u00fbji who tells her that a page of her manuscript is missing and he needs it tonight for the editor. She rushes out with the page, only for it to be revealed that Y\u00fbji has been waiting outside her studio. He enters the red room, finding the cello case, and addresses it with familiarity. Taeko, however, shows up in Aobadai, pulls out her wheelchair and makes her way to the hill. She receives a call from Y\u00fbji, who says he's with her \"pet\" and tells her to return to her childhood home. She returns to the red room to find the cello case empty.\nTaeko arrives at the house we saw Mitsuko grow up in, still toting her wheelchair with her in attempt to keep up the ruse. When Y\u00fbji appears, he dumps her out of the wheelchair, though she still acts like she is paralyzed. He challenges her memory and she deduces she was Mitsuko, despite never quite being sure. When he refers to her as \"Mother\" she can't quite understand what is going on. He helps her back into the wheelchair before taking her upstairs to Gozo's bedroom, where they find Gozo as nothing more than a bloody torso, though still very much alive, bound in chains. Y\u00fbji has set up a table for Taeko to write, but we realize that Taeko is not Mitsuko, but Sayuri, still alive.\nIn a recontextualization of the opening story, we learn that Sayuri accepted her treatment at the hands of Gozo by focusing on her transformation as desirable. Y\u00fbji reveals his body modification, intense scarification where his breasts used to be. It's then revealed that it was Mitsuko who was thrown down the stairs, not Sayuri. Mitsuko survived and was pulled out of her abusive household and put into foster care. She tried to return, only to find that Sayuri could not cope with how terrible of a person she was, and had escaped into the persona of Mitsuko, including going to school and having sex with Gozo, both dressed as and addressing herself as Mitsuko. Sayuri shoved Gozo down the stairs after coming face-to-face with his harem, leaving him broken. After she finished her first novel, she took the name Taeko and stole his wheelchair, storing him in the cello case he was so fond of using.\nAll this breaks modern day Taeko. Y\u00fbji appears to forgive Taeko, allowing her to become Sayuri again, only for Y\u00fbji to grab a chainsaw to turn her into a torso like Gozo.\nTaeko wakes up screaming in the hotel room with Y\u00fbji. Her screaming wakes up Y\u00fbji, but, when she asks for her wheelchair, he has no idea what she is talking about. She finally stands up in front of him, but he insists that she has never been paralyzed. When she questions that, she awakens on the bed next to Gozo, chained up, with Y\u00fbji standing over her with the chainsaw, laughing.\nWe end back at the Strange Circus. The MC presents Sayuri with her head in the guillotine. Everyone claps for her. The MC rips off their face to reveal it's Gozo leading the performance, and we see the various characters, including Taeko's editor, his brothers, teen Mitsuko, Gozo's lovers, and finally young Mitsuko and Y\u00fbji, who give her a standing ovation.

Her two best friends are Glory Lorraine (Amanda Walsh) a beautiful but somewhat bitchy girl obsessed with marriage, and Lisa MacDougall (Holly Lewis), an awkward, born-again, religious girl who is obsessed with sex.\nGlory babysits for Keith Clark (David Boreanaz) and his wife, who works the night shift four times a week. Keith is a 32-year-old husband and father, who loves to ride his motorcycle, gamble with friends and smoke pot. One afternoon, Keira talks to Gordon Gruber (Donnell MacKenzie), who is a bit slow, trying to get information from him about Keith, who has taken Gruber under his wing. Gruber tells Keira about the pot growing in Keith's backyard. That night, Keira and Lisa decide to take some of Keith's pot. While leaving, they hear what sounds like Keith and his wife having sex. Sex crazed Lisa decides to take a closer look. When Kiera joins her, the two discover that Keith isn't with his wife but with Glory! Later that night, Glory arrives at the bonfire. Keira and Lisa tell Glory about seeing her with Keith. Glory defends her actions, saying she loves Keith and he loves her.\nThe next day, while Keira works at the food stand, Glory tells her more about Keith and her relationship with him. Wheels begin to turn in Keira's head, and after debating with herself, she decides to go to Keith's. He thinks she wants to buy pot, but she tells him she will \"babysit\" too. She convinces him to let her in. He tells her he's married and she's half his age, but it is obvious both are attracted to each other. She leads Keith into the bedroom.\nThe next day, Lisa arrives at the stand to tell Keira that she's going to sleep with Keith Clark. Keira tells Lisa that she's supposed to be religious and wait until she's married and that she will hurt Glory, but according to Lisa, since she hasn't been baptized yet, it's okay. She is concerned that when she marries, her virgin husband will not be satisfying. Not heeding Keira's repeated warnings, Lisa continues with her plan. When she arrives at Keith's house, he is in the garden. During their awkward conversation, in which Lisa makes it clear that she wants to \"babysit\" too, Glory arrives and is angry at Lisa and hostile to the others. While Keith tends to his crying daughter, Glory yells at Lisa for what she is doing. Eventually, Keith agrees to allow Lisa to babysit that night.\nWhile babysitting, Lisa calls Keira to tell her she's at Keith's house. Keira begs her not to follow through with her plan, angering Lisa, who only wants Keira to come over and support. Keith arrives home and Lisa jumps him in an attempt to have sex, saying it's okay with Glory. Keith, obviously weirded out, eventually agrees to help Lisa lose her virginity. Keira and Glory arrive outside to watch through the bedroom window. While Keith and Lisa have awkward sex, outside, Keira admits to Glory that she also slept with Keith and Glory punches her, making her nose bleed. Glory is  furious and storms into the house and into the bedroom. An argument ensues between the girls and eventually all three leave.\nGlory later refuses to talk to her best friends. She goes to Keith's house to discuss matters, but Keith rebukes her. Heartbroken and professing again that she loves him, Glory joins her friends in Keira's bedroom where Keira tells them about her plan. Keira and Lisa decide that since all three girls want Keith, then they should share him. Keira explains that with Sue, Keith's wife, working four night shifts, each girl could have him for a night and they could all \"hang out\" on the fourth night. Keith initially balks at the proposal but Keira threatens him with the fact that if people somehow find out: he will be considered a \"pervert pothead who molests young girls\". Keith reluctantly agrees.\nThe nightly sessions take a toll on Keith, who cannot stay awake anymore. He has performance problems and is upset that he has not been intimate with his wife and has a responsibility to his family. Keith becomes upset when the girls nearly tip off his wife and is hostile to the girls, but Keira restates her threat. Later, the girls are frightened when Lenny (Paul Spence), a biker friend of Keith's, arrives and begins to beat up Keith. As later revealed, Keith and Lenny plotted the attack to scare the girls, but it backfires when the girls take the baby and run. Keith is startled when he finds Gruber in the basement. Gruber tells Keith he has seen what Keith has been doing and that he knows about Keith and Lenny's plan. Keith is not intimidated.\nWhen he realizes his daughter is missing, Keith freaks out and takes off to find her. At the dock, he grabs Lisa hard, screaming at her to tell him where his daughter is. Gruber attacks him from behind, knocking him out with a tire iron. Donny (Colin C. Berry) arrives at the scene and all five teens take Jasmine and the unconscious and bleeding Keith back home and debate whether to call 911. Keira hangs up the phone when Keith awakes but a colleague at the hospital tells Sue that there was a hang up call to 911 from her house. Sue leaves to investigate. Meanwhile, at the house, Glory again professes her love to Keith but he rejects her, saying she is crazy to think he would leave with her. She tells him that she's pregnant, which shocks everyone.\nThe teens disperse. Donny drives Glory, Gruber and Lisa home. As Glory sits crying, Donny holds her and comforts her. Keith's wife returns home, shocked at the mess and her husband's injury. Keith lies to her, telling her it was Lenny how injured him. She calls the police, which leads Lenny to punch him out. Lisa leaves for her religious boarding school where she still seems to be freaky. Donny and a pregnant Glory begin to date.

With names such as Mystique, Sateen Lips, Baby Blonde and Glitter Gal, the doll heads not only engage in long conversations with Jeliza-Rose, reflecting different aspects of the girl's psyche, but also act as her companions while she explores the barren Texas landscape.\nAfter her mother overdoses on Methadone, Jeliza-Rose and her father, Noah, flee to Noah's mother's home, a remote Texas farmhouse. Before they leave, however, Noah fears that with all the drugs in their house he will lose Jeliza-Rose and be sent to prison, so he attempts to set it alight, although Jeliza-Rose manages to stop him. They find the farmhouse abandoned, but they settle in anyway. Their first night there, Noah dies from a heroin overdose. For much of the rest of the film, Noah's corpse remains seated upright in a living room chair with sunglasses covering his eyes. As her father slowly begins to decompose, Jeliza-Rose doesn't readily acknowledge his death because she has grown accustomed to him being unconscious for long periods at a time. Instead, she retreats deeper and deeper into her own mind, exploring the tall grass around the farmhouse, relying on her doll heads for friendship as an unconscious way of keeping herself from feeling too lonely and afraid.\nDuring Jeliza-Rose's wanderings, she eventually encounters and befriends her neighbors, a mentally impaired young man called Dickens and his older sister Dell who is blind in one eye from a bee sting. At this point the story begins to unfold, revealing a past connection between Dell and Jeliza-Rose's deceased father. The eccentric neighbors take the girl under their wing, going so far as to preserve Noah's body via taxidermy (which Dell and Dickens did to their own dead mother). Amorous feelings, initiated mostly by the much younger Jeliza-Rose, begin to creep into the childlike relationship between her and Dickens, and it is revealed that the deeply troubled Dickens, a man-child who once drove a school bus in front of an oncoming train, keeps a stash of dynamite in his bedroom that he intends to use against the \"Monster Shark\" he believes is roaming the countryside. The Monster Shark is, in reality, the nightly passenger train that travels past the farmhouse where Jeliza-Rose and her dead father reside. It is also revealed that Dell and Noah were once \"kissers\", as Jeliza-Rose finds pictures of the two in the room Dell shares with her own taxidermied mother.\nAt the end of the film, following a violent confrontation between Dell, Dickens and Jeliza-Rose, a train wreck is caused by Dickens' dynamite, creating a scene of chaos near the farmhouse.  Wandering about the wreckage, and among the confusion of injured travelers, Jeliza-Rose is discovered by a woman who survived, and she assumes the little girl is also a victim of the train wreck.

While the corpses are studied, one student from the class of Physician/Doctor Maddy Rierdon (Lucy Lawless) gets chased in the forest by something that knocks him down and kills him. When he is found, his blood has been drained. Police suspect two of his friends of being the killers and put them under arrest. The case attracts Maddy's attention, as she wants to prove her students' innocence. She soon finds out that her dead student must have been killed by something that moves in a pack and is very fast.\nAt night, two more fishermen are attacked and killed while fishing on their boat. The next morning, police find the drained bodies and, with Maddy's presence at the scene, they are able to recognize some excreta of bats. They then change their opinion and started to believe that bats were the cause of these deaths. The police send out many agents to search around the city for signs of the vampire bats.\nAfter several negative events, including a teenage girl who gets bitten by a bat during sleep and acquires rabies, and a party on board a ship, which is attacked by the bats, Maddy begins to think that the bats have mutated somehow, which she reports to group of agents she is working with. She states that the bats could have been affected by some artificial environmental impacts. To verify her statement, she arrives at the river where the fishermen were killed to set a trap with the help of some of her students. They successfully capture some bats using nets, and Maddy realizes that this population of vampire bats has developed eight upper-jaw fangs instead of two, which makes them hungrier for blood and able to drink more blood every time they bite. They bring the other trapped bats back to the lab, where Maddy informs the police of this mutation. Suggestions are given as how to exterminate these killer bats, and one of them is to spray poisons over the captured bats and release them after sticking GPS locators onto their bodies, letting them fly back to their habitats; the bats will infect each other by licking and grooming. The plan works successfully, but it only kills a small group of them. The other groups remain unaffecteded. Meanwhile, one more student is killed in the pool by the bats. Maddy rushes to find a solution while learning that the bats' mutation is an indirect result of toxic waste that contaminated the local water source, creating mutations in the deer that the bats feed on, thus making the bats too mutants.\nMeanwhile another group of bats is found in a church (yet still not the whole population). Maddy's students accidentally find out that the bats are attracted to loudspeakers or anything that emits sounds similarly, as they mistake those sounds as reflected ultrasounds. They decide to set a trap in the underground basement of their school, intending to lure the bats in and heat them to death by sending in all the heat from the school's exhausts. As the plan commences, the bats are lured to the area by loudspeakers. A problem is encountered as Maddy is attacked in the underground by one of the policeman, who turns out to be an agent working for the company which has been contaminating the water sources and is therefore responsible for the bats' mutation. He tries to kill Maddy in order to eliminate witnesses of his company's work, but Maddy knocks him out instead and escapes when the bats fly into the underground; they devour the agent just before they get heated to death.\nThree months later, Maddy is married and sitting with her children in front of the house where they eliminated the first population of the vampire bats.

In the beginning, he is portrayed as rather arrogant looked upon as a lightweight by opponents (they mock his initials FDR as standing for feather duster).\nHis wife Eleanor discovers evidence of an affair and it is only the intervention of Roosevelt's domineering mother that prevents a divorce, however Eleanor is never able to forgive him and they only have a marriage of convenience.

However, Franklin finds a letter from George Foster Peabody, an old friend who invites Franklin to Meriweather Inn, a resort he owns in Warm Springs Georgia, claiming a crippled boy regained his ability to walk by swimming in the pool at his resort. Intrigued, Franklin heads to Warm Springs, Georgia with Eleanor in tow.\nThere he meets Tom Loyless and the Collier Brothers Roy and Pete who escort him to the Meriweather Inn. Tom initially offers the Roosevelts a two story cottage which Franklin rejects on the due to the fact his condition has given him a fear of fire and he can't get out of a building in time if it catches fire if he's upstairs.

Tom angrily tells Franklin off for his behavior by telling him \"This isn't your private spa! I have a business to run!\" Tom also calls Franklin out on the fact he looks at them with the same revulsion and pity as everyone else and his ignorance for not knowing what they went through to get to Warm Springs by stating  \"You don't want to be around them because that would make you one of them.\"\nFranklin discovers exactly what Tom means when he arrives at the train station.

Franklin protests this to the conductor who dismisses what he says out of both prejudice and ignorance.

He is found by villagers from the nearby mountain village of Dongmakgol, who nurse him back to health. Dongmakgol is cut off from the outside world \u2013 its inhabitants have no knowledge of modern technology and are blissfully unaware of the massive conflict raging across Korea. Smith hands a Korean-English primer to Teacher Kim (Jo Deok-hyeon), the village scholar, in an effort to communicate, but Mr Kim effectively gives up when Smith begins a barrage of complaints after being asked in English, \"How are you?\" as an introductory greeting.\nMeanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean soldiers is ambushed by a South Korean unit, and the ensuing skirmish leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving North Korean soldiers manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa (Jung Jae-young), Jang Young-hee (Im Ha-ryong), and Seo Taek-gi (Ryu Deok-hwan) are found by an absent-minded girl from Dongmakgol, named Yeo-il (Kang Hye-jung). She leads them to the village where, to the North Koreans' alarm, they find two South Korean soldiers, Pyo Hyun-chul (Shin Ha-kyun) and Moon Sang-sang (Seo Jae-kyung). The South Korean soldiers, both of whom had deserted their units and escaped into the mountains, had also been led to Dongmakgol by another villager.\nThe unexpected encounter triggers a Mexican standoff that lasts until the next day. Initially, the villagers are rounded up between the North and South Koreans, but having no idea what the fuss is about they slowly drift away to go about their own business (despite some of the soldiers' efforts to intimidate them into submission). The villagers, who are unfamiliar with the soldiers' weapons, continue to watch on the sidelines and wonder why the two sides are waving \"sticks\" and \"painted potatoes\" at each other (which are actually rifles and grenades, respectively). In fact, Yeo-il gleefully pulls out the pin from Taek-gi's grenade (mistaking it for a ring), sending the soldiers into further panic.\nThe confrontation ends only when Taek-gi, worn by fatigue, accidentally drops his now-armed grenade. While everyone else ducks for cover, Hyun-chul heroically throws himself onto the grenade, but it does not explode. Believing it to be a dud, he throws the grenade behind him in contempt, and it rolls into the village storehouse. It then explodes, incinerating the village's stockpile of corn for the winter. The remnants fall down from the sky, surrealistically, as popcorn.\nThe two groups of Korean soldiers are now forced to face the fact that their quarrel has condemned the village to starvation in the upcoming winter. They reluctantly agree to a truce and divert their efforts to making up for the damage they have caused. Together, the soldiers undertake work across the village, and help harvest potatoes in the fields.\nThey even work together to kill one of the wild boars troubling the village. The villagers then bury the boar, much to the annoyance of the soldiers (who wanted to eat it). Both the North and South Korean soldiers and Smith sneak out separately at night to dig up the boar and eat it, leading to an unplanned meal together. The mood is awkward at first, but the tension between the soldiers lessens as they share the meal with each other. However, even afterwards, members of both sides remain haunted by the memories of the terrible things they have experienced during the war.\nWhile this is happening, Allied commanders, having lost several other planes in the area, prepare a rescue team to recover Smith, who they mistakenly believe has been captured by enemy units and is being held at a hidden mountain base. The plan is to secure Smith and evacuate him from the area, with a bomber unit flying in after Smith's extraction to destroy the anti-aircraft guns they presume are located in the base.\nThe rescue team, led by their commander (David Joseph Anselmo), drops in by parachute at night.

The only survivor of the rescue team, the Korean translator, is hit over the head by Smith and is captured by the villagers.\nThrough the translator, the people in the village find out about the bombing plan. The North and South Korean soldiers realize that the village is in peril and that there is no time for Smith to make it back to his base to stop the bombing. They decide that the only possible way to save the village is to create a decoy \"enemy base\" away from the village, using equipment salvaged from another plane that went down nearby. They plan to engage the unit only far as is necessary to divert it and have it bomb the \"base\" instead of Dongmakgol, with the soldiers fleeing to safety.\nSmith is sent back along with the translator so that he can tell the Americans that there is nothing in the village to bomb, in case they decide to send more bombers.

In their New Jersey hotel suite, shortly after their arrival, the nude body of Miami college student Maureen O'Flaherty is found in a bathtub.\nMaureen, an aspiring journalist working for the summer as a waitress at the comedy team's Miami hotel (which is also owned by Sanmarco), had been researching an article for her school newspaper on the comedy team, and had interviewed them in Miami just before she disappeared. Police investigation in no way connects either Morris or Collins to Maureen's death, which is officially attributed to a drug overdose. Soon after her body is discovered, the two men's comedy partnership is dissolved, despite their enormous success and the closeness of their dependence on one another.\nMany unanswered questions remain for the investigators of Maureen's death; the most confusing aspect is how Maureen's body made it from Miami to New Jersey at the same time the comedians were traveling.\nFifteen years later, journalist Karen O'Connor, who as a young polio survivor first met the duo at the same telethon portrayed in the movie's opening sequence, accepts a job to ghostwrite Vince Collins' autobiography\u2014a deal from which Collins will earn $1 million, which he badly needs. Karen makes a promise to Mrs. O'Flaherty that she will find the truth of how her daughter Maureen died. The project is complicated by the fact that she keeps receiving anonymously sent chapters from a book that Lanny Morris himself has written.\nKaren, who has idolized the comedians ever since first meeting them, encounters Morris, accompanied by his faithful valet Reuben and manager Irv, by chance in the first-class section of a flight, where she shares a dinner table with them. Wishing to keep her identity secret, during the meal she introduces herself as \"Bonnie Trout,\" the name of the best friend with whom she has traded apartments. Morris and Karen hit it off and have sex in his hotel. He disappears the next morning, apparently without leaving her a note.\nUnder her own name, Karen begins to work on the Collins autobiography. Complications arise when Collins invites her to an all-day working session at his Los Angeles home and she learns that Morris will be joining them as well. Near panic ensues; she abruptly invents an excuse to leave, but meets Morris in the driveway, and her masquerade is revealed\u2014Morris discovers she has lied about who she is, and Collins discovers that the woman helping him write his memoirs is having or has had an affair with his ex-partner.\nCollins agrees to continue with the book, but creates a situation to blackmail Karen into staying away from the story of Maureen O'Flaherty, which is Karen's consuming interest. After plying Karen with wine and drugs, Collins manipulates her into having sex with a young aspiring singer named Alice. He photographs the two women in compromising positions. Karen is told that unless she tells the publisher that there is nothing odd or improper surrounding Maureen's death, he will make the pictures public.\nKaren discovers that Maureen had secretly recorded her interactions with Morris and Collins. Gradually, it becomes clear what really happened that night 15 years before: the three had engaged in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois, fueled by drugs and booze, and at some point Collins tried to have sex with Morris, who resisted violently. Collins retreated to his room, whereupon Maureen tried to blackmail Morris into paying to keep this information a secret. (In 1957, it would have finished Collins professionally if it had come out that he was bisexual.) Morris tried to bribe Maureen to stay quiet but she wanted more money than he was either willing or able to give. Collins passed out in his room, Morris in his, and Maureen fell asleep on the couch. In the morning, she was dead.\nFifteen years later, Karen has begun to uncover the story. She discovers more about Morris' \"fix-it man,\" Reuben. While both Morris and Collins were convinced the other murdered Maureen, they smuggled her body in a crate full of lobsters (a gift from Sanmarco) with Reuben's assistance, shipping it ahead of them to the New Jersey hotel. The tape recorder was on during the entire night, but the tape has been missing all these years.\nReuben offers to produce the tape. He asks Karen if her publishing company will pay him, say, $1 million for the tape. Karen puts two and two together and realizes that Reuben was blackmailing Collins, demanding $1 million to keep quiet about his bisexuality, proven on the tape, and perhaps his having murdered Maureen. (Collins was so drunk and drugged during that episode that he plainly does not remember what happened.) Reuben was demanding a million dollars for a murder he himself committed.\nIn the end, Collins is indeed destroyed, committing suicide. Morris is furious at Karen for all that she has set in motion, and Karen has the answer to her mystery.

The narrative then shifts to the present on 6 April 2005, where a woman, Makiko Uchida, is visiting the Yamato Museum in Kure, Hiroshima. She is looking for a boat to take her to the site where the Yamato sank, to honor the crew on the 60th anniversary of the ship's last battle. Katsumi Kamio, a survivor who is now a fisherman, agrees to take her after he discovers she was an adopted daughter of Petty Officer First Class Mamoru Uchida, a fellow crewman and close friend who he thought went down with the ship.\nAs Uchida, Kamio, and his teenage apprentice, Atsushi, travel to the site on his fishing boat, the narrative shifts between the present and Kamio's memories of his service as an air defense crewman aboard the warship during the Second World War.\nIn the spring of 1944, Kamio and other cadets, many of whom are only teenagers, are assigned to the Yamato and are subjected to harsh training and discipline at the hands of Petty Officers Uchida, Moriwaki, and Karaki, who served on the vessel since it was launched in 1941. In October 1944, the Yamato sails as part of a large Japanese fleet to engage American forces at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. During the battle, the Yamato sustains several hits, killing or injuring several crew. Yamato and the surviving ships return to Japan for repairs, while Uchida (who lost his left eye in the battle) is sent to a hospital to recover.\nIn March 1945, the crew hear rumors of a planned mission against the expected invasion of Okinawa and are given a few days of shore leave. During this time, Kamio returns home and learns that his mother died protecting his girlfriend, Taeko Nozaki, during an air raid on Kure. Taeko confesses her love for Kamio when he explains that he must go to Okinawa and gives him a special amulet for protection.\nUchida uses the shore leave to escape the hospital and rejoin the crew. Meanwhile, IJN representative Vice-Admiral Ry\u016bnosuke Kusaka arrives and briefs the admiral-in-charge of Yamato, Vice-Admiral Seiichi It\u014d, and the other senior officers, of the details of Operation Ten-Go. It will almost certainly be a suicide mission - and with no air cover, the entire Japanese force will be extremely vulnerable to Allied attacks, making it unlikely that they will even reach Okinawa. Fights break out among the crew as some believe the mission is futile, but an officer convinces them that the Yamato, as Japan's last operational battleship, must make every effort to defend the nation.\nOn the morning of April 7, the Yamato and its escorts assume battle stations after Task Force 58 detects it on the way to Okinawa and sends its strike planes to intercept. The crew opens fire with their anti-aircraft weapons as the planes appear. However, the sheer number of US aircraft overwhelm the defenses and the Yamato takes heavy damage from multiple bombs and torpedo hits. Kamio, Uchida, and Moriwaki continue to man a portside AA battery after strafing runs and bomb strikes kill much of the crew, including Karaki. After being told the ship is crippled and sinking, Admiral It\u014d and Captain K\u014dsaku Aruga give the order to abandon ship, although both choose to stay behind. Uchida and Moriwaki throw Kamio overboard despite his wish to stay with them to the end. The radioman attempts to call for support but water starts flooding the ship, which eventually capsizes and explodes after its aft magazine detonates.\nThe Yamato's remaining escorts start rescuing the survivors, but Kamio fails to save his friend Tetsuya Nishi despite promising his mother that he would look after him. Moriwaki ties Kamio to be hoisted aboard a rescue vessel and swims away to drown himself.\nThe film flashes forward to the present day; the old Kamio has a heart attack, but Makiko and Atsushi revive him. He also discusses what happened to him during the war's final months. He recounts that after the sinking, he went and told Nishi's mother that her son had died \"a hero's death.\" Kamio expresses his grief that, despite risking his life in battle, he was ultimately unable to protect anyone he loved - Taeko died of radiation poisoning after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, where she had been conscripted to work at a munitions plant. However, she was able to see him before she died and suggested Asukamaru as the name for his boat.\nThey arrive at the sinking coordinates the following day, where they hold a small ceremony. Makiko scatters Uchida's ashes and Kamio gives her a dagger that Uchida asked him to keep during the battle. The dagger was Uchida's most prized possession; Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto gave it to him when the Yamato was his flagship.

Attack of Mechavulcan", "genres": ["Animation", "Adventure", "Action"], "wiki_plot": "The movie begins with a mysterious figure, Dr. M2, rallying a group of robots that he calls Death Mechanics (which all look like gigantic robotic blue versions of Vulcan, a plastic box with wooden sticks for arms that Kiyomaro Takamine \"gifted\" to Gash). He orders one of the units, Death 18, to kidnap Kiyomaro.\nMeanwhile, Kiyomaro is rushing to get to the bus for Coast School, since he slept in late. He leaves Gash behind, who chases after Kiyomaro. During the chase, Vulcan, who Gash brought along with him, is partially broken. Stuck in a tree and unable to stop Kiyomaro, Gash asks him if he'll at least fix Vulcan, but Kiyomaro says that he'll \"make him a new one\". As Kiyomaro tries to chase the already-moving bus down, his friends spot him and try to tell the others to stop the bus. However, while they're not paying attention, Death 18 swoops down from the sky and abducts Kiyomaro, carrying him away and leaving his friends baffled. Once Kiyomaro arrives at Dr. M2's lab, he is contained inside an orange bubble. Dr. M2 then orders Death 18 to go down and distract Gash to keep him away from Kiyomaro by making Gash think that he's his friend.\nAs Gash walks home, he thinks about the previous versions, or \"generations\", of Vulcan that had been ruined in the past (leading up to the third that he currently had), and how they are all important friends of his. Screaming out that Kiyomaro's an idiot, Naomi, the local bully, believes that Gash was talking about her, so she starts pummeling him. However, Death 18 comes down from the sky and interrupts her. As he's about to harm Naomi, Gash realizes that he looks just like Vulcan, and tells him not to hurt Naomi. Naomi runs off and Death 18 fixes Gash's Vulcan. Gash thinks that Death 18 is another Vulcan that Kiyomaro built, and calls him \"Yondaime\", or \"Fourth Generation\". Gash and Vulcan then ride in Yondaime's giant mouth into town.\nIn Dr. M2's lab, the demon explains that Kiyomaro kun is to be his new partner, and that he can take Kiyomaro to the future demon world. Dr. M2 shows Kiyomaro the Death Mechanics, but Kiyomaro tells him that they're just rip-offs of Vulcan. To prove him wrong, Dr. M2 shows Kiyomaro a robotic model of Vulcan from the future that Kiyomaro will someday build; however, as a prototype, it's loaded up with bugs. Dr. M2 had realized that the best way to fix the Death Mechanics was to have Kiyomaro repair them. Kiyomaro asks Dr. M2 whether the battle to decide the next ruler of the Demon World is still going on, but Dr. M2 simply states that he isn't interested in that battle, leaving it vague. Dr. M2 offers again to bring Kiyomaro to the future, but he refuses. Dr. M2 tells him that the idiots of his time can't understand him, but Kiyomaro says that Gash changed his view of people around him.\nMeanwhile, after venturing into town, Gash and Yondaime go under a bridge and find graffiti. As the two start painting the walls themselves, Gash paints \"Yondaime\" in Kanji onto the robot's body. Gash's demon friends, Tio, Kanchome, and Umagon, then arrive under the bridge. While Kanchome is terrified by Yondaime, Gash explains that he is a present from Kiyomaro, so the five of them then play together in the park. As Dr. M2 opens the portal to the future to return with Kiyomaro, a dark cloud is created over the city. Citizens of Mochinoki Town are advised to leave, and there is mass panic. Gash says that they should all go to investigate, but Yondaime's programming makes him try to keep them all away. After much prodding from Gash, though, Yondaime realizes that he and Gash have become friends, and he changes his mind. The four demons get into Yondaime's mouth and, revealing that he can fly, Yondaime soars towards the cloud.\nUpon entering the dark cloud, they discover Dr. M2's giant floating castle. Infuriated that Death 18 disobeyed his orders, Dr. M2 tries to reprimand him, but the robot doesn't respond. Kiyomaro manages to break free from his prison and communicates with Gash using a giant monitor on the side of the castle. Dr. M2 summons all of the Death Mechanics to fight off Gash and the others, but Kiyomaro manages to get Gash to fire his Zakeru spell, blasting away the Death Mechanics' missiles. The attack also tears a hole in a part of the castle, though, leaving Kiyomaro to fall from the sky; however, Yondaime manages to catch him.\nKiyomaro gets ready to attack the army of Vulcans, but Gash, believing them all to be Vulcans and, therefore, all his friends, runs towards them to try to talk to them, while Yondaime keeps Kiyomaro restrained. The Vulcans don't respond to Gash's words, though, and all begin to pummel him. Tio, Kanchome, Umagon, and Yondaime all try to hold back the Vulcans from attacking him, but to no avail. As all of the Vulcans try to take Kiyomaro, Gash yells at them to stop. They all stop momentarily, but are immediately called back to the castle by Dr. M2. One of Dr. M2's lightning bolts hits Yondaime, reverting him to his original programming. Despite Gash's efforts, Yondaime flies off to join the others, who all fuse together with the castle to become one giant Vulcan.\nAs the giant Vulcan attacks the group, Megumi, Folgore, and Sunbeam all arrive in a car together to help fight it off. During the scuffle, Megumi casts Giga Ra Seushiru, causing the giant Vulcan's attack to reflect back at it, making it collapse. Gash asks again if they can stop attacking, saying that since they're all Vulcans, they're all his friends. Kiyomaro angrily snatches Gash's Vulcan from his hand, saying that it's just a toy made from chopsticks and a paper box that he scrapped together. Gash tearfully reminds Kiyomaro that Vulcan was the first friend that Kiyomaro ever made for him. Shaken by Gash's statement, Kiyomaro says that the only reason he wanted to go to Coast School was because his friends would be there. Kiyomaro had been alone, thinking that the world was boring and stupid, until Gash had come along and taught him the importance of friends. Kiyomaro comes to tears as he says that, although Gash made many friends for Kiyomaro, the only friend that he could give Gash was a toy made of paper box and chopsticks, yet Gash still cherishes it so much. Everyone agrees that, because Vulcan is Gash's friend, he is their friend as well, and will help protect all of the Vulcans. With newfound understanding and determination, Kiyomaro comes up with a plan to stop the Vulcans without destroying them.\nThe four demon and human pairs coordinate attacks and trick Dr. M2 into opening the power reactor on the front of the enormous Vulcan to attack; however, before he can, Gash and Kiyomaro jump in the way and fire Zakeruga at the reactor, destroying it. When the giant Vulcan collapses, Gash sees that Yondaime is all right, and he hugs him.\nSuddenly, the storm around them intensifies, and everyone realizes that if they don't seal the time-space hole, then the entire Earth will be destroyed. Kiyomaro grabs Dr. M2, asking him to fix it. Dr. M2 reveals that if the destroyed reactor is fixed, the hole will close, but there would need to be a large amount of power to reactive it. Gash states that they could provide the power to activate the reactor, and Dr. M2 realizes that everyone's combined power could repair it.\nAs Dr. M2 floats in the sky in the core of his castle, the four demons cast a series of spells to channel power into the reactor, ending with Kiyomaro casting Gash's most powerful spell, Baou Zakeruga, to guide it. However, their efforts are unsuccessful, and the temporarily closed gate opens once more. Yondaime then flies up, attaching himself to the reactor. Dr. M2 realizes that Gash could strike the reactor still active in Yondaime to get the main reactor working again, but Gash says that he could never shoot Yondaime. As Gash cries, Yondaime begins talking to him; however, the one sending the message through Yondaime it is in fact the Vulcan prototype, which is revealed to contain Kiyomaro's recorded voice. He says that they will always be friends, whether they are together or apart; he speaks not only as Yondaime, but also as the future Kiyomaro who no longer has Gash with him. Redetermined, Gash and Kiyomaro launch a gigantic Baou Zakeruga, which crashes through Yondaime and splits into three heads, starting up the reactor. As Dr. M2 sits in the castle, holding the prototype Vulcan in his lap, he quietly wonders to himself if the transmission element that Gash and Kiyomaro used to guide the reactor can guide even himself. The three Baou Zakerugas fly into the cloud, successfully closing the hole and leaving Dr. M2's fate unknown. The giant Vulcan then separates back into the smaller Vulcans, who fly away into the sky. Gash asks Kiyomaro if he can ever see Yondaime again, but Kiyomaro responds that he'll build him an even better Vulcan; an even better friend.", "tmdb_plot": "As Kiyomaro races to catch the bus to seaside camp, little does he know that Dr. M2, a demonic magic scientist from the future, has sent out a robot to kidnap him.

With few leads, the case goes unsolved and the emotional attachment causes heartache for Parish's family; wife Laura (Robin Tunney) and 12-year-old son (Rory Culkin).Six months later on July 4 \u2013 as Parish begins to lose hope \u2013 the Zodiac strikes again. This time he guns down a couple in a deserted parking lot. He's inches away as he pulls the trigger, but he never reveals his true identity. Just an hour after the shooting, the Vallejo Police Department receives an anonymous call, confessing to the murders that have just taken place. Days after the second murder, a letter is sent to Bay Area newspapers the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner, threatening that 12 more people will die unless the three papers print the encoded letter they've just received. The killer reveals that if they can decipher the note, his true identity will be revealed.\nIt becomes an obsession for Parish to solve the case. He spends all his time with the coded sheet, sketches of the killer and psychological reports, putting strain on his family. The ever-increasing publicity pushes him to the edge. When Parish receives more anonymous calls and ciphered letters (some suggesting the threatening chance that his next victim could be one of Parish's family), he thinks he's got his suspect. Disobeying orders by Chief Frank Perkins (Philip Baker Hall) he goes in search of the killer. When he storms into the suspect's house, his allegations are shattered because the man has no relation to the murders.\nThe police later hear of more killings, but the case doesn't get close to being resolved.
