The Soviet spacecraft Leonov will be ready a year before the American Discovery Two, but the Soviets need Americans to board the Discovery and reactivate the ship's sentient computer, HAL 9000, apparently responsible for the disaster. Upon learning that Discovery will crash into Jupiter's moon Io before the American mission can launch, Dr. Heywood Floyd, Discovery designer Walter Curnow, and HAL 9000's creator Dr. Chandra are permitted to join the Soviet mission.\nArriving at Jupiter, the crew detects organic molecules on Jupiter's icy moon Europa. A probe sent to investigate is destroyed by an energy burst, which the Soviets believe to be electrostatic build-up, but which Floyd suspects is a warning to stay away from Europa. Finding Discovery adrift in orbit over Io, Curnow reactivates the ship, and Chandra restarts HAL. Cosmonaut Max Brailovsky investigates the nearby giant Monolith at which Bowman disappeared while exploring, but the Monolith destroys his EVA pod with a burst of energy, killing him.\nOn Earth, Dave Bowman, now an incorporeal being, appears through his former wife's television to say goodbye, telling her that \"something wonderful\" is going to happen. He then visits his comatose mother in a nursing home. She briefly awakens in delight at her son's presence, before dying peacefully.\nChandra discovers the reasons for HAL's malfunction: the National Security Council ordered HAL to conceal information about the Monolith from the Discovery's crew and programmed him to complete the mission alone; this conflicted with HAL's programming of open, accurate processing of information, causing the computer equivalent of a paranoid mental breakdown. When Bowman and copilot Frank Poole discussed deactivating the malfunctioning computer, HAL judged that the human crew was endangering the mission, and terminated them. Although the NSC's order bears his signature, Floyd angrily denies having known of it.\nBack on Earth, the United States and the Soviet Union are on the brink of war. The Americans are ordered to leave the Leonov and move to the Discovery, with no further communication between the crews. Both ships plan to leave Jupiter in several weeks' time, but Bowman appears to Floyd, and says that everyone must leave within two days. Floyd confers with the skeptical Soviet captain, Tanya Kirbuk. The crews agree to cooperate for an emergency departure when the Monolith suddenly disappears, and a growing black spot appears in Jupiter's atmosphere. Neither ship has the fuel to reach Earth if they leave ahead of schedule, so the ships are docked together, and placed under the control of HAL 9000. Discovery's remaining fuel will be burned to propel the Leonov away from Jupiter; then Discovery will be undocked and left behind.\nHAL determines that the spot is a vast group of Monoliths, multiplying exponentially and altering Jupiter's density and chemical composition. He suggests canceling the launch in order to study the changes occurring to Jupiter. Floyd worries that HAL will prioritize his mission over the humans' survival, but Chandra admits to the computer that there is a danger, and that Discovery may be destroyed. HAL thanks Chandra for telling him the truth, and ensures the Leonov's escape. Before Discovery is destroyed, Bowman asks HAL to transmit a priority message, assuring him that they will soon be together. The Monoliths engulf Jupiter, which undergoes nuclear fusion, becoming a new star. HAL transmits this message to Earth:\n\nThe Leonov survives the shockwave from Jupiter's ignition, and returns home.

Banzai tests it by driving his Jet Car through a mountain. While in transit, he finds himself in another dimension. After exiting the mountain and returning to his normal dimension, he discovers an alien organism has attached itself to his car.\nDr. Emilio Lizardo, incarcerated at the Trenton Home for the Criminally Insane, sees a television news story of Banzai's successful test. In 1938, Drs. Lizardo and Hikita had built a prototype overthruster, but he tested it before it was ready and became stuck between dimensions. He was attacked by aliens until freed by his colleagues, emerging changed and violent. Understanding that Banzai has finally accessed the 8th dimension, Lizardo escapes the asylum and plots to steal the overthruster.\nBanzai and his band, \"The Hong Kong Cavaliers\", are performing at a nightclub when Banzai interrupts their musical intro to address a depressed woman in the audience, Penny Priddy. During a song he performs especially for her, she attempts suicide, which is mistaken for an assassination attempt on Banzai. After questioning her at the jail, he realizes she is his late wife, Peggy's, long-lost identical twin sister and bails her out.\nLater, during a press conference to discuss his Jet Car experience, the overthruster, and the specimen of alien/transdimensional life he obtained while traversing the 8th dimension, Banzai is called to the phone, where he receives an electrical shock. Simultaneously, strange men disrupt the event and kidnap Hikita. When Banzai returns, his electrical shock enables him to recognize them as humanoid aliens, and he gives chase. He rescues Hikita, and they manage to evade the aliens long enough for the Cavaliers to rescue them.\nBanzai and the Cavaliers return to the Banzai Institute, where they are met by John Parker, a messenger from John Emdall, the leader of the peaceful Black Lectroids of Planet 10. Parker delivers a recording from Emdall in which she explains that her people have been at war with the hostile Red Lectroids for years, managing to banish them to the 8th dimension. Lizardo's failed test of the overthruster in 1938 allowed the Red Lectroids' tyrannical leader, Lord John Whorfin, to take over Lizardo's mind and enable several dozen of his allies to escape. Because Banzai has now perfected the overthruster, Emdall fears Whorfin and his allies will try to acquire it to free the other Red Lectroids and tasks Banzai with stopping Whorfin; otherwise, the Black Lectroids will attack Russia from their orbiting ship, triggering a nuclear World War III that will annihilate the Red Lectroids on Earth as well as humankind.\nThe Cavaliers track the Red Lectroids to Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems in New Jersey.  They realize that Orson Welles's broadcast of The War of the Worlds described the Lectroids' arrival in 1938, though afterward the Lectroids forced him to state it was fictional. Yoyodyne has been building a spacecraft to cross over to the 8th dimension, disguised as a new United States Air Force bomber. While the Cavaliers are planning their response, Red Lectroids break into the Institute and kidnap Penny, unaware that they have also captured the overthruster, which she was carrying.\nAt Yoyodyne, Penny refuses to tell the Red Lectroids where the overthruster is, and they begin torturing her. Banzai enters Yoyodyne headquarters alone; the Cavaliers follow, reinforced by several groups of the Blue Blaze Irregulars, civilians recruited to assist the Cavaliers when necessary. Banzai saves Penny and fights off the Red Lectroids, though she is wounded and unconscious. While the Cavaliers tend to her, Banzai and Parker sneak into a pod on the Yoyodyne spacecraft. Lacking Banzai's overthruster, Whorfin insists they use his imperfect model, which fails to make the dimensional transition; instead, the Red Lectroid spaceship breaks through the Yoyodyne wall and takes off into the atmosphere.\nLord Whorfin ejects the pod containing Banzai and Parker from the craft, but they manage to activate it and use its weapon systems to destroy Whorfin and the other Red Lectroids. Banzai parachutes back to Earth while Parker returns to his people in orbit using the pod. With the situation resolved and war averted, Banzai finds Penny has died from her injuries.

Jake claims that Jessie assaulted him, stole money and fled. Terry is reluctant to take on the job, but needs the money and knows Wise is capable of blackmailing him.\nTerry gets in touch with Jessie's mother (Jane Greer), ostensibly to find out where Jessie can be found, but mainly to convince Mrs. Wyler and her business partner Ben Caxton (Richard Widmark) to reinstate him on the team. Mrs. Wyler makes clear that she has no interest in his football career. She's willing to pay him more than Jake would if he will find Jessie for her. Beyond that, she has no use for him. Hank Sully (Alex Karras), the team's trainer, strongly advises Terry to stay away from Jake and offers to help Terry get a coaching job. Terry is convinced his days as a player are not over and instead decides to work for Jake to tide him over until the next season, when he can try to continue his playing career.\nTerry finds Jessie living in Cozumel, Mexico. He makes multiple attempts to approach Jessie, but she rebuffs him, aware that he must have been sent by either Jake or her mother.

Sully is sent by Jake to investigate. He catches the lovers alone at the ruins of Chichen Itza. Wielding a gun, Sully demands that Terry turn over the girl and warns him she's \"no good.\" He, too, has been involved in corruption with Jake's sports syndicate. A struggle between the men ensues and Jessie fatally shoots Sully. She wants to flee, as the two will be unable to offer an explanation that will allow them to avoid jail. But when Terry refuses, insisting that the two cannot just run away from the matter, Jessie abandons him.\nAfter disposing of Sully's body, Terry returns to Los Angeles and finds to his astonishment that Jessie has returned to Jake. He is bitter toward her, but Jake maintains a hold over him with the point-shaving incident, as well as Sully's sudden disappearance. Jake invites Terry to his nightclub where he is sent to break into the office of Kirsch (Saul Rubinek), the team's corrupt lawyer, who is also involved in Jake's gambling operation. Terry's mission is to retrieve Kirsch's files, which implicate those involved.\nAfter leaving the nightclub with the keys he needs for the break-in,  Terry goes to Jake's house to see Jessie who didn't come to the show that night. After a desperate confrontation, she admits both her love for him and the hold Jake has over her knowing that she was directly involved in Sully's death. The next morning on the beach, Jake has a heartfelt talk with her, but Jessie is distant and asks him to let her go.\nTerry breaks into the office only to find Kirsch dead. A security guard has been hired to kill Kirsch and make it look like Terry committed the murder. Terry fights off the security guard, then hides Kirsch's body. He finds a local bar frequented by Kirsch's secretary, Edie (Swoosie Kurtz), where he tells her what has happened and that she, too, is in danger. Edie tells him about a secret box that contains the information to bring down the entire syndicate and local politicians.

What she doesn't know is that Caxton is actually Jake's boss at the syndicate.\nCaxton takes charge. He arranges to meet Terry at the site of a new construction project that he and Mrs. Wyler are backing. Terry is able to disarm Caxton's henchman Tommy (Dorian Harewood).

Salieri recounts how, even in his youth in the 1760s, he desired to be a composer, much to his father's chagrin. He prays to God that if He makes Salieri a famous composer, he will, in return, promise his faithfulness. Soon after, his father dies, which Salieri takes as a sign that God has accepted his vow. By 1774, Salieri has become court composer to Emperor Joseph II in Vienna. Seven years later, at a reception in honor of Mozart's patron, the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, Salieri is shocked to discover that the transcendentally talented Mozart is obscene and immature.

When Mozart is summoned to court to explain, he manages to convince the Emperor to allow his opera to premiere, despite Salieri and the advisers' attempts at sabotage. When Mozart is informed that his father has died, he writes Don Giovanni in his grief. Salieri recognizes the dead commander in the opera as symbolic of Mozart's father and concocts a scheme; he leads Mozart to believe that his father has risen to commission a Requiem.

Meanwhile, Mozart's friend Emanuel Schikaneder invites him to write an opera for his theatre.

She even ill-treats all her caretakers, which leads to hatefulness towards her by almost all other orphanage workers and orphan children, except Mother Superior, who heads the orphanage and is always kind to everyone regardless of their age. Lalitha arrives at the orphanage as a babysitter. She is assigned to take care of Rosy by Mother Superior. She, unlike any other caretakers, takes care of Rosy despite her rudeness and shows extra care for her like a real mother herself, which even surprises Mother Superior as the older caretakers gave up and sidelined when it came to taking care of Rosy, owing to her arrogance.\nIt is informed that actor Rajinikanth would one day visit the orphanage as a guest to entertain children on a special occasion under the permission of Mother Superior, who sought to bring change to everyone in the orphanage.

While this infuriates everyone around, Rajinikanth imbibes ignominy caused by Rosy's behaviour since her is a child, and still continues being calm and positive.

The FBI, knowing that Cooper took credit for somebody else's work, forces him to act as bait for Jeff in a set-up operation. The set-up nearly fails - Jeff is killed during a gun battle, and Cooper himself is shot. Realizing his mortality while being put on an ambulance, Cooper confesses to Clair (Shaver), an attractive co-worker, that he stole the DYP. This triggers an angry response from Clair and also from his wife Laura (Capshaw) who, arriving on the scene, realizes that Cooper has been cheating on her. Surviving the bullet, Cooper receives even worse news from a co-worker: the DYP-gyro he claimed credit for will not work, because it will cause overheating in the WAM, another critical component, crippling the tank's fire control and, in a combat situation, dooming the tank.\nThe film reaches its climax in a sequence weaving between 1982 when a more conscientious Cooper, having recovered, confronts his employers about the flaws in the DYP, while in 1984, Landry attempts to fire the main gun while under attack by an Iraqi gunship. As had been predicted, the DYP causes failure in the WAM, suggesting that Wylie's protest was ignored.\nInstead, the camera cuts to the innards and shows that the DYP has been redesigned according to an idea that Cooper had in 1982 while fixing one of his son's toys.

Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but he lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary.\nBirdy concedes to Al's wishes of pursuing another venture. After they purchase and restore a 1953 Ford automobile, Al's father registers the vehicle. Al drives Birdy to an Atlantic City boardwalk, but they are arrested the next day after Mr. Columbato reports the car stolen. After bailing the boys out of jail, Mr. Columbato sells the vehicle. Birdy later confronts him, claiming that the car was not his to sell. On principle , Birdy refuses a sum of money offered to him.\nBirdy builds a new aviary in his bedroom and purchases two canaries. He names the female Perta and the male Alfonso (after his friend). Upon returning to school, Birdy encounters a classmate, Doris Robinson, and Al encourages him to ask her out on a date. At the prom, Birdy dances unenthusiastically with Doris, leaving her confused and humiliated. Afterwards, Doris drives him to a secluded spot, where Birdy lightly rejects her sexual advances. Birdy returns home to his bedroom and lies down naked in the aviary. In a semi-conscious state, he expresses that he wants to die and be born again as a bird. He then imagines himself flying like a bird around his room, throughout the house and outside in the neighborhood.\nUpon graduation, Al enlists and Birdy is drafted into the United States Army. During the Vietnam War, Birdy is placed in a mental hospital after being missing in action for a month. A flashback reveals that he was the sole survivor of a helicopter crash. Al is hospitalized in the same facility. His face is heavily bandaged for injuries that he sustained from an exploding bomb. Major Weiss, a military doctor, informs Al that, although Birdy's injuries are relatively minor, Birdy has not spoken since he was found. Al speaks to Birdy at length, but Al grows increasingly frustrated by his lack of response. He is then elated when Birdy smiles at a joke he makes. Weiss dismisses the response as dissociative behavior.\nAl suspects Birdy of feigning insanity to hide from the world, and he expresses to Birdy that he too wishes to hide due to his own injuries. Birdy unexpectedly responds by telling Al that he is \"full of shit\". Al alerts Weiss to Birdy's response, but when the doctor arrives, Birdy remains silent. Not seeing any progress, Weiss orders Al to leave, but Al pushes the doctor aside. After Weiss flees, two orderlies are sent in to subdue Al, who fights them and takes Birdy to the roof of the hospital. Birdy rushes to the ledge, raises his arms and jumps off the side of the roof as if he were about to fly. Thinking Birdy has plunged to severe injury, Al runs over to the ledge but finds Birdy on another level of the roof, perfectly fine.

A severe storm closes in and makes heading back down the river dangerous, forcing Lockhart and the students to have to stay the night in Crenshaw's cabin.\nBelieving Lockhart to be a medical doctor, Crenshaw enlists his help in tending to an animal he has caught. To Lockhart's amazement, it is the adolescent creature. Lockhart determines that the adult creature has been more hostile in the area recently due to the capture of its child, who is now near death. Lockhart commandeers Crenshaw's gun and ammo and returns the adolescent creature to the adult when it attacks the cabin in the night, knocking down the front door. With its young in its arms, the creature leaves the cabin without further incident.  The following morning, Crenshaw agrees with Lockhart's assessment that the creatures should be left alone.

The attempt to round Cape Horn fails due to harsh weather, and the ship is obliged to take the longer eastern route. Finally arriving in Tahiti in October 1788, Bligh finds that due to the delays, the wind is against them for a quick return journey and they must stay on the island for four months longer than planned.\nDuring their stay in Tahiti, ship discipline becomes problematic. Many of the crew develop a taste for the easy pleasures that island life offers, especially the native women, making the relationship with their Captain tense. Bligh, at the same time, subjects the crew to pressure, eventually reaching breaking point when some members become intent on staying on the island. When the ship leaves Tahiti, Fletcher is forced to leave his native wife, Mauatua, behind.\nThe resumption of naval discipline on the return voyage turns Bligh into a tyrant not willing to tolerate any disobedience whatsoever, creating an atmosphere of tension and violence. Bligh insists that the ship is dirty and orders the crew to clean up several times a day. Many of the men, including Christian, are singled out for tongue-lashings by Bligh.\nPlaying on Christian's resentment against Bligh's treatment of both him and the men, the more militant members of the crew finally persuade Christian to take control of the ship. Bligh is roused from his bed and arrested, along with those considered loyal to him, and they are forced into a ship's boat, minimally supplied, and cast adrift. The film follows both the efforts of Fletcher Christian to get his men beyond the reach of British punishment and the epic voyage of Bligh to get his loyalists safely to the Dutch East Indies in a longboat.\nBligh, through courage and excellent seamanship, and a return of his good character and leadership qualities, successfully manages to reach civilisation after a very harrowing journey without navigational charts or firearms. One man, however, is killed by natives as the crew stop for supplies on a hostile island. Bligh is portrayed as a man who, on the one hand takes his sense of discipline and command too far, exceeding the limits of the ship's company, but whose character ultimately successfully protects his loyal non-mutineers and guides their overcrowded boat to safety.\nThe mutineers sail back to Tahiti to collect their wives, girlfriends and native friends. King Tynah, however, is concerned that their presence on the island could incite King George to declare war against Tahiti and his people. Realising the folly of staying, the mutineers gather supplies and sail away to try to find a safe refuge. Christian pleads with Tynah to allow Mauatua to decide her own destiny. Tynah concedes, and Mauatua chooses the uncertainty of a life with Christian over remaining with her father.\nThe search for a safe haven is long and seemingly impossible, as they realise that any pursuing Royal Navy vessels will search all known islands and coastlines to find them. At this point, those who remained on board the Bounty are so frustrated that they are ready to rebel against Christian to turn the ship back towards Tahiti. After Christian forces the crew to continue on, they eventually find Pitcairn Island, a place which Christian realises is not marked on British maps of the region.\nAs the crew of the Bounty burn the ship to keep it from being found (as well as to motivate the crew to tough it out on the island), the judgment of Bligh's court-martial is read: Bligh is found not to have been responsible for the loss of the Bounty, and is commended for the voyage of the open boat.

The underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures. To protect this secret, Wilson plans to seal the sewers, open up some gas lines and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s and any witnesses of their existence, despite the inherent danger to the city.

Adolfo, who despises his mother for having had an adulterous affair decades earlier, treats her with unveiled contempt. Camila, a baby when her grandmother arrives, later also initially rejects her grandmother. When Ana asks Camila whether she enjoys love stories, the girl responds that she doesn't know any.\nIn 1847, Camila (Sus\u00fa Pecoraro) is a Buenos Aires socialite. Having been raised on her grandmother's stories about her affair with former Colonial Viceroy Santiago de Liniers and their surviving love letters, Camila secretly reads French romance novels and books by political refugees like Esteban Echeverr\u00eda. She is courted by Ignacio, a wealthy man with whom she is not in love. Her fellow socialites, who see marriage as a business arrangement, urge her to not let Ignacio get away. In reply, Camila bursts into tears as she describes her longing to marry for love and for a husband she could feel proud. Her socialite friends are stunned.\nMeanwhile, Adolfo has come to enthusiastically support the far-right single party state led by Caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, whom Adolfo praises for restoring order after the Argentine civil wars of the 1810s and 1820s. Camila, however, is horrified by the state terrorism which Rosas routinely uses against real and imagined opposition. She openly expresses these views, which always enrages her father, who constantly reprimands her for doing things that are \"not for women.\" One day, during confession, she meets a Jesuit priest, Father Ladislao Guti\u00e9rrez (Imanol Arias). Camila immediately develops a crush on him, but after hearing Fr. Ladislao furiously denounce Rosas' death squads from the pulpit as she wishes she could, she falls deeply in love. Fr. Ladislao first rebukes Camila when she comes on to him and feels deeply ashamed that he returns her feelings. He attempts to do penance with a whip before sinking into a life-threatening fever.\nDuring the funeral of her grandmother, Camila learns that Fr. Ladislao is ill and rushes to his bedside. To her shock, she finds him caressing a handkerchief which she had given him, ostensibly as a gift to the poor but really as a token of love. She also kisses him on the lips, and he did not resist it. Upon his recovery, Fr. Ladislao finally surrenders to Camila's advances. For a time, they conduct a discreet affair, but Fr. Ladislao is visibly troubled by the hypocrisy of his public priesthood and his private violation of his vows.\nAbandoning everything, Fr. Ladislao and Camila elope to Corrientes Province, where they pose as a married couple. Fr. Ladislao works as a school teacher and swiftly gains the admiration and gratitude of the village. Camila and Ladislao live in a small house on the side of a road. At one moment, a religious procession passes by the house and seems to cast a shadow over the couple. Later, Camila is ecstatically happy and tells Ladislao how proud she is to be his \"wife.\" However, Ladislao remains torn between his love for Camila and a deep longing for his abandoned priesthood. During an Easter fiesta, Ladislao is recognized by Father Miguel Gannon, a Buenos Aires priest who angrily greets him with the words, \"God does not forget his chosen. Do you hear me, Father Ladislao Guti\u00e9rrez?\" With his troubled conscience brought to a crisis, Fr. Ladislao runs to the village church and screams at the Eucharist in the tabernacle \"Why can't You leave me in peace!\" Meanwhile, Father Gannon notifies the village's police commandante.\nThe latter, feeling grateful to Ladislao for teaching his children to read, warns Camila that he will do nothing until morning. He urges her and Ladislao to immediately flee across the Brazilian border. Deeply grateful, Camila frantically searches for Fr. Ladislao to tell him the news. When she finds him kneeling in prayer before the altar of the church, she bursts into tears, knowing that he has made his peace with God.\nThe next morning, Fr. Ladislao returns to Camila to say goodbye. Although he says that he still loves her, Fr. Ladislao explains that he must return to Buenos Aires, do penance, and continue his priestly ministry. Visibly ashamed, he apologizes to Camila for what he has done to her. Saddened but unremorseful, she responds, \"I knew what I was doing.\" To both their horror, the \"Commandante\" and his men arrive and arrest them both.\nMeanwhile, Camila's father, Adolfo O'Gorman, is infuriated by how the family name has been dragged through the mud by Camila's actions. Despite the pleas of Ignacio and the rest of the family, he writes to Rosas and demands the death penalty for his daughter. With the Church Hierarchy and his political allies demanding retribution, and his exiled opponents exploiting the scandal, for political gain, Rosas issues a decree that both Camila and Fr. Ladislao are to be shot without trial.\nIn a military prison, Camila and Fr. Ladislao are forbidden to see each other. While imprisoned, Camila learns that she is carrying Fr. Ladislao's child. Heartbroken, she calls out from her cell, \"Ladislao! We are going to have a baby! We are going to have a baby!\" Despite the fact that the Law of Argentina forbids the execution of pregnant women, Rosas refuses to delay Camila's death sentence. After begging the prison chaplain to save her unborn child, the chaplain gives Camila glass of holy water to drink and thus baptizes her unborn child. Fr. Ladislao sends her a final letter affirming his love for her and saying that, because they could not be together on earth, they will be reunited in heaven before the throne of God.\nOn August 18, 1848, Camila and Fr. Ladislao are tied to chairs, blindfolded, and carried before a firing squad in the prison courtyard side by side. The soldiers gun down Fr. Ladislao without hesitation, but they initially balk at killing a pregnant woman. When the Commandante threatens to shoot them if they refuse to obey God's will (as interpreted by Rosas), they open fire, riddle Camila's stomach with bullets, and place both bodies into the same coffin.

Both sign an agreement on this and Gandhi leaves on 19 April.\nRam Mohan Rao throws the agreement into a trash bin and forgets this incident, but determined Gandhi starts planning for his 50 lakhs. He wins his first Rs.100, through gambling and explains to Lakshmi, the difference between law and justice and that he won those Rs.100 lawfully. Meanwhile, Ram Mohan Rao tries to make marriage arrangements for his daughter Harika, but Gandhi learns of the incident by the information he received from Harika, Gandhi interrupts and spoils the marriage arrangement explaining that he had bet for a duration of five years with Ram Mohan Rao in which if he succeeds he would marry Harika. While Gandhi is leaving, Ram Mohan Rao sends goons to kill Gandhi, but Gandhi bashes all goons and tells them to inform Ram Mohan Rao that not only he is intelligent but also has the physical power to beat up such goons.\nGandhi slowly progresses and buys a new house and moves in with Lakshmi, who now, is his secretary, Lakshmi gives Gandhi a letter which he must read only after completion of challenge duration of five years regardless of his success or failure in the challenge. Lakshmi's ill-charactered brother Hanumantha Rao enters their house with his wife Priyamvada, pretending to be homeless. Despite Lakshmi's warning, Gandhi lets them stay.\nHanumantha Rao tries every possible trick to defame Gandhi and separate him from Lakshmi and Harika but fails. Also, Priyamvada tries to seduce Gandhi and realizes her mistake through him, at that moment Priyamvada reveals out that her husband Hanumantha Rao is the one who is leaking Gandhi's business secrets to Ram Mohan Rao. Gandhi plans to start a paper mill to compete with Ram Mohan Rao, and accidentally meets a young man named Vidyarthi.\nGandhi learns that Vidyarthi worked for Ram Mohan Rao in the past and uses his experience and talent to promote his business. During his rise, Harika supports him by saving him from going bankrupt and starts adoring him. Hanumantha Rao manages to create problems in Gandhi's paper mill and Lakshmi revolts seeing Gandhi adamant about making money rather than bothering about his workers' welfare. Since the problems in paper mill don't seem to come to an end, Gandhi opts for another plan which is launching a new scooter into the market. Gandhi gets an immense response from the public for his new scooter launch and gets a lot of money in advance booking in the form of cash, cheques and Demand Drafts.\nOn the last day of the bet, Gandhi is left with Rs.500 short of 50 lakhs and the ward boy, who is influenced by Gandhi's personality and thinking, brings about changes within himself and returns Rs.500. Jubilant, Gandhi tries to reach Ram Mohan Rao but realizes that he is leaving the country with his daughter. On his way to the airport, Gandhi is attacked by Hanumanth Rao and goons. Gandhi bashes them up and reaches Ram Mohan Rao to declare his victory.\nWhen Ram Mohan Rao tries to shoot Gandhi, Gandhi saves himself with the suitcase in his hand, which has all the cash in it. He throws away all the money, during which the letter given by Lakshmi to him falls down at the feet of Harika, he explains to Ram Mohan Rao that there is nothing impossible for a man who has self-confidence and there are few things in this world that money can't buy, like love and self-confidence. Gandhi says that Ram Mohan Rao is so arrogant that when they agreed to the challenge he did not consider his daughter's opinion before agreeing to get his daughter married to Gandhi if Gandhi succeeds. Ram Mohan Rao didn't even mention what Gandhi must give or do if Gandhi fails in the challenge. Meanwhile, Harika reads the letter (which has good wishes to Gandhi from Lakshmi for him to succeed in every matter of his life and expressing her love for him) and hands over it to Gandhi, before he leaves.

Protagonist Bert Waters (George Kennedy), Estelle's husband and Jennie's father, is late because he's spending time with his \"girlfriend\" Maggie Jones (Barbara Eden), whom he plans to marry after divorcing Estelle.\nOnce Bert does arrive, Alonzo refuses to talk to him, having no patience for lateness. Bert is, however, able to introduce Jennie to Mason Foresight (James Horan), Duke of Chalfont; and give Jennie pictures that show Paul asleep next to two attractive twins. Jennie vows not to speak to Paul ever again to Estelle's chagrin and Bert's joy.\nAlonzo dies shortly afterward and is buried in a Boxcar. By the time his will and testament are read, Jennie has become engaged the Duke. The will leaves $100,000 and a full pension for Woodrow; $5,000,000 for Jennie; and his property and company to Estelle.\nFor Bert, the will sets the condition that he must prove he can be on time by restoring and conducting the Historic Chattanooga Choo Choo locomotive (Sierra Railway 28) and full consist (two heavy 1900s compartment, one diner, and one club Pullman cars) from Pennsylvania Station in New York, to Chattanooga Station, adhering to its historic time table. He must arrive in exactly 24 hours to secure the $1,000,000 Alonzo has left him.\nOn his way to tell Maggie, he runs into a biker gang who make fun of his love for lavender. He has his body guard, Hashimoto (Professor Tanaka), destroy their Harley-Davidson chopper.\nBert turns the ride into a boisterous publicity stunt for his new football team, coached by Newt Newton (Joe Namath), which Bert has founded and risked all his capital in, under the assumption he can secure the winning bid for the city's future football stadium over Sam Cartwright (Clu Gulager), Paul's father. The spectacle will end with a grand wedding for Jennie and the Duke at the Railway Museum.\nThe departure doesn't quite go as planned, as Sam and Paul Cartwright have bought tickets to come along, Estelle is left behind in a phone booth which Jennie finds unforgivable, Maggie sneaks onto the train and starts falling for Newt while insisting she knows the Duke from somewhere, and Hashimoto forgets Bert's luggage in the run-in with the Cartwrights. Sam discovers how Bert can be so sure of winning: he has bribed an inside man to remove the Cartwright bid and bring it along on the train.\nNorman (John Steadman), the train's Fireman and Pee Wee (Paul Brinegar), the Train's Engineer, discover they're a little rusty, and have trouble communicating on account of Norman having gone half-deaf since they last drove the train, and Pee Wee having gone half-blind. This causes the train to lose 15 minutes off the time table, so Bert instructs Woodrow to order them to skip Philadelphia, an optional stop. Unfortunately, Estelle was hoping to get on at Philadelphia; and Sam, who has recovered his bid, was hoping to get off.\nMeanwhile, Paul gets the chance to talk to Jennie and she starts to suspect the pictures may be faked. The twins from the picture are on the train, as they are part of the cheer-leading squad of the football team.\nFootball player Jim-Bob (Curtis Taylor, uncredited) pranks Bert with laxative, which makes him toss his pants out the window. With no luggage, he is forced to deliver his whistle-stop press conference in Washington, D.C. station in a skirt. Bert has Hashimoto restrain Sam so he cannot get off and cuts the press conference short, putting them back on schedule. Estelle manages to get on and Bert rushes to hide Maggie in Jim-Bob's compartment so Estelle won't see her. There, Maggie discovers Jim-Bob has drilled a peephole to see into the cheerleaders' compartment.\nThe next morning sees the railroad deliver Bert's luggage using an adapted Ford Model T, but most of it falls, leaving him only with the pants. Maggie shows the peephole to the cheerleaders, and she has an idea to get even. Using her mascara applicator, she spreads super glue on Jim-Bob's side of the hole. Then they intentionally talk loudly so he knows they're there and will start watching, and pretending they don't know about the peephole, Maggie directs them through a striptease. Jim-Bob's eyelid gets glued to the wall, which makes him pull the emergency brake, putting them behind schedule again.\nMaggie also finds where Sam is being kept and tells Paul, who radios for an ultralight plane to land on the train so Sam can deliver his bid in time, and helps convince Hashimoto to let Newt take Sam's place. So the plane can get enough lift, Sam uses Woodrow's radio to order more speed from the locomotive, which eventually puts the train ahead of schedule.\nBert goes check on Hashimoto and \"Sam\" and, finding Maggie, tells her Newt is \"just a washed-up ball-player\" which makes both of them leave him. Estelle walks in on the argument and, spotting Maggie, declares she, too, is leaving Bert.\nMaggie remembers where she knows the Duke from: he's a con artist from Memphis called Bob Shoemaker. The football team proceeds to force him to confess in front of Jennie and some Trainspotters, which finally makes her and Paul get back together.\nAs everyone celebrates that they're arriving early, the train encounters a road block by the biker gang, who are using Bert's car to demand a replacement Harley. Bert dispatches the football team to disperse them. These antics, however result in their arrival at Chattanooga two minutes late. Bert tries to haggle by setting his watch back, but the executor is absolute: he gets nothing.\nThe large party that was waiting to receive him, leaves. Sam informs him that Bert has lost the bid. The wedding preparations are used to marry Jennie to Paul and Maggie to Newt.

At age nine, their trait of feeling pain from the other's injuries becomes apparent (it becomes the film's predominant running gag); they accidentally burn down their house while playing with this power, and they decide to split up.\nAt age 30, they reunite: Louis (now Lu\u00eds) wound up in Mexico working low-end jobs (though he claims to be a wealthy businessman) and Lucien, who stayed in France, has grown resentful of the royals' harsh treatment of peasants in the country, particularly that of the queen's regent, the sadistic (in more ways than one) Fuckaire, who usurped the king after his disappearance. The cowardly Lu\u00eds is reluctant to help his brother's revolutionary plans, but both find themselves drawn to two of the queen's daughters (played by Cheech and Chong's real-life wives). The crux of Lucien's scheme is to disguise themselves respectively as a gay Spaniard hairdresser and Nostradamus, who are prepared to visit the queen with the Marquis du Hickey. Despite a setback in which they are temporarily imprisoned because Lucien would rather fight outnumbered than flee from danger as Lu\u00eds wanted, Lucien manages to escape. At Lu\u00eds's execution, Lucien and the peasants storm the festivities, Lu\u00eds is freed and Fuckaire is deposed. As Lu\u00eds prepares for the dual wedding between the brothers and princesses, he suddenly fears for their future, and Lucien sweeps in to rescue him as they both leave the princesses at the altar, resolved to cross the globe and start a revolution in America.\nAfter their saga concludes, Los Guys resume playing in an outdoor cafe, covering Chuck Berry's \"Nadine,\" to an indifferent audience.\nMuch of the film's humor comes from anachronisms: The Corsican Brothers is set in the 1840s (in the film it is portrayed closer to 18th-century, pre-revolution France), but Nostradamus, who lived and died three centuries prior, makes an appearance, and Lu\u00eds is said to have spent time in a modern-day Mexico.", "tmdb_plot": "Two brothers who can feel each others' pain and pleasure mess up the French revolution.", "tmdb_id": "14774", "wiki_id": "7324665"}, {"title": "Children of the Corn", "genres": ["Horror", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "The film is set in the fictional town of Gatlin, Nebraska, an agricultural community surrounded by huge cornfields.

Isaac and his subordinate Malachai lead the children in a revolution, murdering all of the adults in town as human sacrifices. Children Job and his sister Sarah are uninvolved in the sacrifices, having not attended the meetings in the cornfield with the other children.

Elsewhere, a young boy named Joseph tries to flee Gatlin, but is attacked in the corn; he stumbles out into the road and Burt accidentally runs over him. However, Burt discovers that his throat was cut beforehand. Burt and Vicky place Joseph's body and his suitcase in their trunk and search for a phone to call for help. They find Diehl, an elderly mechanic and the last adult in Gatlin, but he refuses them service, as he has agreed to supply the children with fuel in exchange for his life. However, Malachai breaks the pact and murders him against Isaac's wishes after Diehl tries to steer the couple away from Gatlin.\nVicky and Burt explore the abandoned town and find Sarah alone in a house. While Vicky stays with her, Burt searches the town. Malachai and his followers appear, capture Vicky, and take her to the cornfield, where they place her on a cross to be sacrificed.

Malachai takes over, tired of Isaac's preaching, and orders Isaac to be sacrificed instead of Vicky. Isaac warns Malachai that sacrificing him will break their pact with He Who Walks Behind the Rows and the children will be severely punished.

As he leaves for the exchange, Scrooge encounters young Tim - Bob's crippled son - waiting across from his office. After mistaking Tim for a beggar, Scrooge declares that the boy will have a long and cold wait for his father. At the exchange, Scrooge charges three other businessmen 5% extra for corn (because they failed to meet his demands yesterday), much to their chagrin. Scrooge then declines giving a donation to charity workers Poole and Hacking.\nLater that night at his home, Scrooge encounters the ghost of his late business partner Jacob Marley -- who warns him to repent his miserly ways, lest he be condemned to the same afterlife as that of Marley's: carrying heavy chains forged from his own greed. Marley informs Scrooge that three spirits will visit him that night.\nAt 1 A.M., the Ghost of Christmas Past takes Scrooge back in time to his unhappy childhood and early adulthood. They examine Scrooge's tenure as a student, abandoned at boarding school by his grim father Silas...who wanted nothing to do with Ebenezer, since the boy's mother died giving birth to him. Silas got Ebenezer an apprenticeship with Fezziwig; the boy was missed by his loving elder sister, Fan, who died just a few years after welcoming Fred. Ebenezer's moneylending business thrived, but his preoccupation with financial security cost him his engagement to Belle...who later welcomed a large, happy family with another man. She feels Scrooge's loneliness, upon hearing that Marley is deathly ill. The flustered Scrooge suddenly finds himself back in his bedroom.\nAt 2 A.M., the Ghost of Christmas Present, shows Scrooge the joys and wonder of Christmas Day. They visit the Cratchit residence, and find Bob's family surprisingly content with their small dinner. Scrooge takes pity on Tim, whom the spirit explains will not survive another year. The ghost mocks Scrooge's change of heart, and quotes Ebenezer's earlier callous comments about the poor. Scrooge is taken to Fred's house for the Christmas party which Scrooge declined to attend. Fred continues to pursue a relationship with Scrooge for the sake of his late mother, Fan, with whom Scrooge shared great fondness; Ebenezer is touched by this. The spirit takes Scrooge to a desolate street where homeless families, desperate and eager for work, are camped...disproving Scrooge's belief about the poor being shiftless. The ghost shows Ebenezer two hideous children named Ignorance and Want, warning Scrooge to beware of them before he disappears.\nThe Ghost of Christmas Future brings Scrooge to the exchange, where three businessmen discuss the death of an unnamed colleague...whose funeral they would attend only if lunch is provided.

Some fortunate few are raised by the surviving adults, including Lee (John Stockwell), who is taken in and raised by Albert (James Earl Jones) on his remote farm. Fifteen years later, Lee sets out for the nearby ruins of Los Angeles in the hopes of joining the Clippers, a famous motorcycle gang. Lee follows a convoy of trucks into a fenced off building, where he is noticed by Bolo (Norbert Weisser), who is overseeing operations. When workers begin to converge on Lee he flees on his motorcycle.\nAfter defending himself against and fleeing from a hostile group of bikers known as the DAs, Lee makes his way into Clippers territory and meets their leader Mick (Darrell Larson) and his second in command Whitey (John Diehl).  When Lee asks to join the gang, he is rebuffed. Mick sends Yogi (Rae Dawn Chong) along to escort Lee safely to the city limits.  The two are chased by the DAs when they discover one of the bikers who attacked Lee earlier has died from his injuries. Lee and Yogi manage to evade the DAs and head back to Clippers territory. Whitey and Mick debate turning him over to Ray (Danny De La Paz), the leader of the DAs, to preserve the \"no guns, no killing\" truce that exists between the two gangs, but Sammy (Don Keith Opper) offers a suggestion. When Ray arrives, Whitey proposes a test of combat between Lee and the DAs' best combatant to decide if he lives; Ray agrees.  After he leaves Ray heads to the factory where he reports to Bolo, who tells him he will be sending one of his employees with him to the competition.\nThe next day the two gangs arrive for the competition. Before the fight begins Ray presents Wickings (Kim Cattrall), who introduces herself and Bolo as representatives of the Sunya Corporation, brought to L.A. at the behest of the Federal government. Wickings attempts to convince Mick to have the Clippers help with Sunya's efforts to restore the city, but Mick turns her down. The gangs proceed with the competition, pitting Lee against a female DA. Though initially surprised by the woman's fierceness, Lee ultimately defeats her without killing her as the Clippers leave victorious, Lee now officially a member of the gang.\nBack at the Sunya factory, Wickings unsuccessfully tries to convince Bolo and his boss Carver (Robby Benson) that the Clippers can be brought around. Bolo leaves the office to meet Ray, where he scolds the gang leader for failing to bring the Clippers on board, then gives him a gun. This is observed from the rafters by Whitey, but as he attempts to leave he nearly falls and is noticed.  Bolo's men give chase and ultimately capture him, and Bolo executes him in front of Ray. Wickings leaves the office in time to see Bolo standing over Whitey's body. The next day she files an electronic report with the government accusing Bolo and Carver of violating company directives, specifically in using armed force to recruit workers, but receives a reply that the two have been authorized to use any and all measures they deem necessary. After being confronted by Bolo, Wickings returns to her quarters where she obtains a schematic of the facility's sewer system and uses it to escape.\nAs the Clippers prepare to have a funeral for Whitey, Bolo makes plans to ambush the group during the ceremony. Ray begs Bolo for one last chance to convince Mick; Bolo agrees, but readies his men anyway. At the funeral Ray attempts to reason with Mick, but instead starts a brawl between the DAs and Clippers. The brawl is cut short when Bolo and his men open fire on the Clippers, killing many and rounding up others to be used as slave labor. Mick is wounded, but he, Lee, Yogi, Frankie (Pamela Ludwig), Sammie, Ramos (Tony Plana) and a few others escape. Mick leaves for one last meeting with Ray, who tries to convince Mick to leave town as soon as he can. Bolo and a group of men arrive at the meeting and take custody of Mick, tipped off to its location by Ernie.  Bolo tasks Ray with bringing Ernie back to the Sunya factory; Ray gives him a ride, but kills him along the way for his betrayal of his former friend. Bolo tortures Mick to reveal the location of the remaining Clippers, but before he can get the information the group arrives, rescues Mick and flees the city for Albert's farm.\nThe group spends time at Albert's farm recuperating, during which time Lee and Wickings become romantically involved. Lee and Mick form a plan to retake the city from Sunya. The group fix up their bikes, and head to the city, accompanied by Albert in his restored 1950s Cadillac. Wickings and Lee infiltrate the Sunya factory using the sewers, overpower the guard overseeing the captured Clippers' training, and frees the group, leading them back to their impounded motorcycles. The reformed Clippers head back for Sunya to finish the job, only to be stopped by the DAs. Rather than fighting them though, Ray allows them to proceed, and he and the rest of the DAs join the Clippers in their assault on the Sunya factory.\nAt Sunya, Wickings and Sammy disable the power, allowing the unified gang to attack in the confusion. Bolo arrives soon after, holding the two at gunpoint and turning the power back on. This allows a Sunya vehicle with a mounted machine gun to open fire on the gangs. The advantage is short-lived: assisted by Frankie, Albert takes out the vehicle using an explosive-laden remote controlled model plane. Sammy and Wickings make their escape while Bolo is stunned by the explosion, and Albert crashes a second explosive plane into Bolo, killing him. With most of Sunya's personnel fleeing or dead, Lee, Wickings, Mick and Yogi head for the main building to confront Carver. They find him, but Carver is unimpressed, calmly stating that even if he is killed, someone just like him or worse will be sent in his place. Before anyone else can act Ray drives into the office on his motorcycle, simply responding with, \"no\", before he crushes Carver between his desk and the wall, killing him.\nIn the aftermath, the Clippers and DAs unite, becoming the Clippers Corporation.

Along the way, Jack helps Davey evade the pursuers. However, Davey's sense of morality and concern for his friend Kim (whom the spies have kidnapped to try and blackmail Davey into handing over the cartridge) collide with Jack's harsh methods. Davey is cornered by the spies along the River Walk. During the fight, Jack urges Davey to lure two of the spies into the \"Crossfire Gambit\", causing one to kill the other. Jack convinces Davey to pick up the gun of a dead spy, but rather than shoot Rice, Davey panics and runs away down a dead-end path. Rice arrives and corners Davey, taunting him. When Davey proves unwilling to shoot first, Jack tries to get Rice's attention. Standing in front of a blank wall (and holding his Agent-X bulletproof beret in front of him for protection), Jack dares Rice to shoot him. Davey looks to Jack, warning him not to do anything, and Rice instinctively turns and fires at the wall, thinking \"Jack\" is a hidden ally.

The week before, a global banking crisis, caused by several South American countries defaulting on their loans, led to turmoil in Southwest Asia. Before the unrest spread to Saudi Arabia, Soviet-backed militants led a coup in Oman when the Omani economy collapsed. Shortly after, a new report shows the banking crisis may soon begin to ease.\nDuring this time, Waldorf's Pentagon insider boyfriend is providing off-the-record insight into the White House's response to all these events, and suggests that there may be too many critical events going on at once for the President and his advisers to handle effectively.\nThe following day, it is revealed that a large military operation was launched to keep the peace in Saudi Arabia, with many American soldiers, ships, and planes being sent at King Fahd's request. This move is heavily criticized - in the US and abroad. The United Kingdom, America's closest ally, refuses to take part in the operation as do many other of America's allies. However, the attitude of the American representatives is clear that they can perform the peacekeeping mission alone, citing the success of the British in the past in containing the Soviets' previous provocation in the area.\nIn response to this move, which the Soviet Union sees as provocative, the Soviet-backed puppet government in Oman imposes a $10,000 toll for every oil tanker passing through the Strait of Hormuz into the Persian Gulf. The Soviet government claims it will remove the toll if the Americans withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia. The captains of the tankers refuse to pay the toll, effectively creating an economic blockade in which no oil can be transported through the Persian Gulf.\nA breaking news alert on the fifth day of the Middle East crisis reveals that a short battle took place between American warplanes and unidentified enemy warplanes, presumed to be from Iran or Kuwait, in which an American reconnaissance plane was shot down over the Persian Gulf before two of the five attacking planes were shot down. The attacking aircraft were presumably aiming for an oil refinery in Ras Tanura in retaliation for Saudi Arabia's request for American troops.\nMeanwhile, Waldorf brings a story to CVN: her boyfriend had provided her with satellite photos that suggests that Soviet forces have disappeared from their border with the Middle East, possibly as a covert invitation to mutually withdraw from the area \u2014 an invitation that could have been ignored in the flood of information the multiple global crises have created (\"The signal-to-noise ratio in there [The White House] is horrendous.\"). However, Tobin reluctantly insists that Waldorf have more than one source for the story.\nOn day six of the crisis, an American aircraft carrier, the USS Nimitz and its battle group, armed with both nuclear and conventional weapons, are sent by the U.S. President to the Persian Gulf to ensure the free passage of oil tankers in the region; the President also activates Selective Service, drafting thousands of soldiers in anticipation of a larger conflict. The Soviet Union quickly responds to this action by sending submarines to the Persian Gulf. CVN sends Michael Boyle to the Nimitz to cover the deployment. The Soviets publicly criticize the United States for failing to accept their offers of conciliation and mutual withdrawal from the area, implying that Waldorf's information was correct and that the US may have given up an opportunity for a peaceful solution.\nOn day eight of the crisis, in response to the growing urgency of the situation, CVN begins to broadcast 24 hours a day. Shortly after a State Department briefing, the Defense Secretary dies, perhaps of a heart attack brought on by the stresses of crisis management.\nOn day nine, the crisis deepens when an Omani gunboat attacks and apparently destroys an unarmed Dutch vessel which tried to go through the Strait of Hormuz. The CVN broadcast also notes the presence of Soviet attack submarines near the site of the attack. At this point, people begin to evacuate cities, overseas air travel is suspended by the FAA and Civil Aeronautics Board, many American schools begin closing, the Strategic Air Command redeploys B-52 bombers throughout the nation's airports, and people are urged to stay off their phones. By nightfall, an evacuation of the White House is ordered, and the US begins shutting down its nuclear power plants nationwide, an act noted not to have happened since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Later, Waldorf is met by her boyfriend at the news studio, offering to take her along in the evacuation\u2014the President has delegated tactical nuclear launch authority to the Nimitz battle group commander after the destruction of the Dutch vessel, and the chances of a nuclear exchange in the Gulf have increased significantly. Waldorf chooses to remain in Washington to continue her work.\nA night battle then erupts between Omani gunboats and the U.S. Navy in the Strait of Hormuz, with an Omani gunboat firing on and disabling a warship before being destroyed by the other American vessels. Despite the gravity of the situation, Tobin discusses his optimistic viewpoint of the situation with correspondent Eric Sevareid, believing that \"[r]easonable people, once they've looked the Devil in the face, aren't going to shake hands with him.\"\nShortly after the Omani gunboat exchanges fire with the American ship, a Soviet submarine slips through the perimeter of American picket ships and is tracked on a course towards the Nimitz, which attempts to defend itself by deploying depth charges in an effort to sink the sub. When these fail to stop the submarine, a large explosion erupts from the water, suggesting that a nuclear depth bomb was used to destroy it. Boyle evacuates into the carrier's island, confronting an officer to find out who provided authorization for the nuclear attack, but cannot get a clear answer. Shortly thereafter, a nuclear weapon detonates inside the battle group, causing an unknown level of damage, though the Nimitz remains afloat. Shortly thereafter, Boyle and the Nimitz lose contact with CVN, as high levels of atmospheric radiation interfere with the broadcast.\nAt this point, the White House is completely evacuated, with the President, Joint Chiefs of Staff, and other White House officials evacuated onto the National Emergency Airborne Command Post plane with the Strategic Air Command's airborne command center Looking Glass in accompaniment, and the Emergency Broadcast System is activated.\nIn the moments before CVN's broadcast is transferred over to the Emergency Broadcast System, Tobin reiterates his optimism, discussing the opinions of a deceased colleague who was considered an expert in nuclear war scenarios. His colleague held the belief that a nuclear exchange would someday take place, but when the two superpowers were confronted with the horror of the situation, they would choose peace over war. As a now-bewildered Tobin prepares to turn things over to the EBS, it is obvious that he is shaken by the events that have occurred, and is almost mournfully fearful over the inescapable realization that there may very well be no future at all for the Earth or humankind.", "tmdb_plot": "A fictional confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union over the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the Persian Gulf.

The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it is not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back.\nTheir conversation is heard by \"Boardwalk\", a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake does not inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop.\nThe opportunity comes very soon, as Garvey announces that he's leaving the shop because of a planned visit to his old mother. The group then puts their plan into action (albeit with many troubles along the way), eventually finding out that the big vault which is supposed to be full of goods is empty, because Garvey was not keeping anything inside it for years.

He and his wife, who serves as his assistant, work together to treat patients with as little pain as possible. Dr. De Soto uses different chairs, depending on the size of the animal, or simply has the patient sit on the floor, using a stepladder or with Mrs. De Soto guiding her husband with a system of pulleys for treating extra-large animals. They refuse to treat any animal who likes to eat mice.\nOne day, a well-dressed fox with a toothache drops by and begs for treatment. Dr. De Soto feels pity for the fox and Mrs. De Soto suggests they risk it, so they admit the fox as a patient. They give the fox some anesthetic and proceed to treat the bad tooth. However, while under anesthesia, the fox unknowingly exclaims how he loves to eat mice (including with a dry, white wine). The De Sotos remove the bad tooth, and tell the fox to come back the next day to get a false tooth. On his way home, the fox notes that it is crass to try to eat the creature that had just relieved him of much pain, but still doesn't dismiss the idea. Later that night, Dr. and Mrs. De Soto, as she prepares the new tooth of gold, debate whether to readmit the fox. Dr. De Soto feels it was foolish to trust a fox, but Mrs. De Soto says she thinks the fox was reacting to the anesthetic in his comments. In the end Dr. De Soto vows, as his father taught him, to finish the job he started, but they formulate a plan to protect themselves.\nThe next day, the fox returns; he is much happier, out of pain, and anxiously awaits the installation of his new tooth. Dr. De Soto puts in the new tooth, but by now the fox has decided to give in to temptation and eat them. Dr. De Soto then introduces a new formula the couple created recently, and claiming that one application will prevent toothaches forever asks the fox if he'd like to be the first to try it, who, hating pain, readily agrees. The dentist takes his time and paints each tooth with the formula, then has the patient clench his jaws shut for a full minute. The fox is surprised to find that his mouth has been glued shut, as this is what the secret formula really is, but Dr. De Soto states that he \"should have mentioned\" that the formula needs time to permeate the dentin and as a result, the fox will not be able to open his mouth for a day or two. Stunned, the deceived patient can only reply with 'frank oo berry mush' and in a daze, leave with as much dignity as possible.\nThe book ends with the De Sotos triumphant at having \"outfoxed the fox\", and they take the rest of the day off.\nThe plot of the book bears many similarities to a fable by Aesop regarding a wolf and a crane; in both stories, a predator has trouble with their mouth or throat, and requires the aid of another animal to place themselves inside the jaws of the beast.

One day, when Nobita takes out the trash, he finds a stone statue that looks exactly like Doraemon, and takes it home, confusing Doraemon as well. Doraemon eventually got curious and want to know more about magic, and did some research about it with Dekisugi. It seems like magic was real in history, but because it's seen to be the 'power of the devil', they were targeted and became extinct. Later, Nobita finds another stone statue, this one looks like him. He wonders if the statues are actually themselves from another time or world, so they decide to leave it alone. However, at midnight during a storm, the statues somehow enters the house, and appears in a different pose. \nNobita requests Doraemon to give him the Moshimo-box and wishes for the world to become a place where the use of magic is possible. Witchcraft replaces science and technology and everyone makes use of it on their daily lives. However, neither Nobita nor Doraemon can use them, finding it much harder to do than they imagine. This causes Nobita to do poorly in school where magic was taught. Back home, Doraemon encourages Nobita to learn magic, but when Shizuka arrives, he accidentally lifts her skirt using magic, when suddenly an earthquake happened. According to Shizuka, frequent earthquakes are related to a hypothesis of a doctor of magic, Professor Mangetsu (\u6e80\u6708\u5148\u751f), that \"the demon world is approaching\". Wanting to meet this professor to learn more about this world, Nobita, Doraemon, and Shizuka went to search for him using a flying broom, while Doraemon uses a Bamboo copter, something that's considered foreign in this world.\nThey search the hill behind the school, where they spot Suneo and Gian bullying a monkey, but it turns out it can use magic, burning their brooms and causing them to fall. The group helps them to get into a house, which is guarded by a living statue and a tree. It's Professor Mangetsu house, who helps them with his assistant, a girl named Miyoko. Professor Mangetsu also tells the group about his research, where he suspects that the demons of the demon world are currently planning to invade the earth, and if nothing is done, humankind will be destroyed by demons with unimaginable magical power, with the earthquakes and huge typhoons that are approaching the world are the precursors. Realizing how dangerous this world is, Nobita and Doraemon planned to return the world to normal, but found out that the Moshimo-box was thrown away by Nobita's mother. Worse, the news reveals that a typhoon is coming towards Japan. After discussing that night, Nobita and Doraemon decides they must solve the problem in this world. They went to professor Mangetsu's house, but the house seem to disappear overnight. They did find a cat nearby that seem to be interested in them, so they take it home.\nWithout professor Mangetsu, Nobita does his own research about this world by asking his teacher about the devil. He learns that the Devil seem to come from another world called the Underworld according to professor Mangetsu. Meanwhile back at home, the cat is somehow able to do Nobita's homework, completing it without trouble. That night, the sky is covered with thick clouds, but the cat wakes both Nobita and Doraemon. When the moon briefly shines onto the cat, it transforms into Miyoko. She reveals that she and professor Mangetsu were attacked by demons, and she was cursed into a cat, with the spell disappearing only when she's under the moonlight. Nobita and Doraemon takes Miyoko over the clouds with the Bamboo copter, and she begs both of them to save the world from the devil in the demon world, much to their surprise, but then Miyoko uses a crystal ball to reveal the 'five heroes who will defeat the demon king', they see Nobita, Doraemon, Shizuka, Suneo, and Gian.\nThe next day, the typhoon had got worse, and school is suspended. It seems natural disasters got worse and worse around the world. This convinces Nobita and Doraemon to try to defeat the devil to save the world. Worried about Miyoko, the two went through the typhoon and finds her near where professor Mangetsu's house, hiding from a demon and the monkey from earlier. Using the Translate Cake, Doraemon and Nobita can understand Miyoko even when she's a cat, who explains that she can draw a six angle star barrier that makes them unable to be found by demons. However, when Shizuka was spotted by the demon, the group has to fight to safe her. Miyoko fares well at first, until the monkey disarms her sword. Doraemon eventually uses the Reverse Cloak to deflect the demon's spell back, destroying it and the monkey. After the fight, Gian and Suneo also joins the group after being informed about the situation earlier.\nMiyoko grabs a book that contains information of the devil's world, while Doraemon uses a wizard hat with a star pattern as they use a flying carpet to reach the devil's world from space. After experiencing more oddities of the magic world like being able to breathe in space, the carpet having a lower floor room, and seeing rabbits on the moon, the group gets close to the devil's world, but the flying carpet got pulled into it's layer of black flame. They made it through, but they had to abandon the flying carpet with the Bamboo copter as it got burned. They landed on an arctic landscape, and despite Miyoko able to conjure fire, she's not powerful enough to maintain it. When the group got stranded in a freezing blizzard, Nobita fell asleep, but his mumblings reminds Doraemon to use the Abekobe Cream to warm them up through the storm.\nNext, they came across the sea, where Miyoko's book say there's mermaids that lures everyone with their voice to be eaten by a monsterous whale. Doraemon gives the group ear cover, but the mermaid's voices went through it. Just as the group seem to succumb to it, the annoyed Gian starts to sing loudly, scaring the mermaids away and returning the group back into their senses. Afterwards they got into a large open plains where it's said one cannot leave once they enter it, and houses some demonic animals that can attack and devour them. The group initially uses a tree as their reference, but they realize the trees are moving, making them go in a circle. Doraemon then uses the Light-The-Way Beam to guide them through the right way.\nFinally, they got into a forest, where they hide from a beast using Miyoko's barrier, Doraemon's Pebble Hat, and a rocket to guide them, but the Bamboo copters ran out of batteries, making the group walk to the Devil's castle. Using Doraemon's Pebble Hat once again, the group encounters the Devil himself. Miyoko tells everyone to throw golden darts at the \"Devil's heart\" to defeat it, but to their surprise, it didn't work. Overpowered by the devil and his demons, Miyoko gives Nobita one of the scrolls containing the information of the devil's world before she, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo got captured, with only Nobita and Doraemon escaping. Though initially depressed, Doraemon got an idea of using the Time Machine to stop their past selves from using the Moshimo-box to bring the magic world into reality. However, the devil knows their plan, and sends Demaon the demon to stop them. Despite Nobita able to use the broom to fly, the two eventually got petrified into stone statues, which their past selves find in the beginning of the story.\nHowever, they're saved by the sudden appearance of Dorami, who detects the danger with one of her gadgets. She gives her Moshimo-box so Nobita can restore the world back to normal, but they realize that Miyoko and their friends are still captured, and it will stay that way because of the parallel universe. When they use the time machine to return to the devil's world, Nobita takes out the scroll that Miyoko gave her, and realizes that the Devil's heart is not in his body, but it turns out to be a star in the underworld space. They managed to rescue the others along with professor Mangetsu before the demons cook them, and through luck, avoids capture because a demon mistook the stars on Doraemon's hat as a symbol of high rank. They return to the burnt Magic Carpet, restore it with the Time Cloth, and made their way back to space to find the Devil's heart and destroy it. \nDuring their search, they're chased by the devil and his army of demons. They turn stars into giant fireballs that attacks the group, but with Miyoko's curse lifted, she's able to send them away with a spell. When more stars starts attacking them, Professor Mangetsu steers the carpets to dodge them, and even with everyone using Doraemon and Dorami's weapon gadgets, they barely manage to hang on, with Suneo almost falling at one point. Finally, they managed to spot the Devil's heart, and when Gian throws the golden dart at it, both the heart and the devil himself turns aflame, and got destroyed.\nWith the world saved, the group rebuilds professor Mangetsu's house, and Nobita says farewell to Miyoko before turning the word back to normal with the Moshimo-box. As Nobita takes a walk, he heard his friends talking the events of the devil's world as a dream or a fantasy, and when Nobita tried to cast a spell, Shizuka's skirt got lifted like how he did when he was learning spell, but dismissed it, thinking it's just the wind that caused it.", "tmdb_plot": "Nobita requests of Doraemon the Moshimo-box and wishes for the world to become a place where the use of magic is possible.

The skeleton is accompanied by a wallet, containing the driver's license of a Michael J. Curtis from San Antonio, and a slip of paper with two phone numbers on it.

It results in media attention, and her parents, Albert and Lucy Brodsky, are both brought out of their respective self-absorbed lives and made to testify in court about their personal lives.\nAt a truck stop in Indiana on the night of January 20th, 1973, film professor Albert Brodsky is hitchhiking across the country, where he gets picked up by Lucy van Patten, a woman who has ambitions of writing books, particularly for children, but her fianc\u00e9 \"Bink\", a gruff Navy man, represses her, and she is depressed about being relegated to the life of a military wife. Through getting to know Albert, Lucy loosens her inhibitions, breaks off her engagement to Bink, and marries Albert shortly afterwards.\nThe couple move to California, where Albert attaches himself to a prominent Hollywood producer, who entrusts him to film a romantic script the producer has kept shelved for a long time. When Albert suffers from writer's block about the romance, Lucy aids him with her writing skills. The film becomes a box-office hit and he is nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director, but cracks are forming in Albert and Lucy's marriage, particularly since Albert was slow to credit Lucy for the screenplay and he is frequently traveling to places such as Cannes, France, while leaving his daughter in the care of Lucy, or more often Maria, their Mexican maid. Casey is becoming more fluent in Spanish as a result of spending more time with Maria than her own parents. When Albert sees a young woman named Blake Chandler working at a hot dog stand, he takes her home and casts her in his next film, which becomes a moderate success. When Lucy sees signs that Albert is interested in Blake for more than just acting, she divorces him, further troubling Casey. Albert ensures that Lucy gets custody of Casey, while he lives in a Hollywood mansion with Blake.\nA turning point occurs when Lucy, angered both at Albert's procrastination in paying child support and at the sight of a sloppy, overweight woman in a supermarket buying the same comfort food as she is, hurries home and channels her anger into writing a tell-all novel. Meanwhile, Albert's producers are warning him not to attempt his musical remake of Gone with the Wind, which he is calling Atlanta, but Albert ignores their advice, and his budget for the picture skyrockets, mainly because of his own perfectionist attitude and Blake's mediocre singing voice, along with her diva-like behavior on set. Atlanta becomes an embarrassing box-office bomb, costing Albert any assignments in Hollywood and causing Blake to desert him. Meanwhile, Lucy's novel becomes a runaway success, allowing her to buy and move into Albert's former mansion, and she begins to morph into a diva.\nIn a final confrontation following a one night stand, Albert and Lucy quarrel in front of Casey about her custody, which degenerates into a literal tug of war, with each parent pulling on one of Casey's arms, ignoring her pained protests. That is the final straw for Casey, who then decides to divorce both her parents.\nIn the courtroom, Casey gives testimony that just because two parents no longer love each other, that does not give them the right to ignore their children. Both Albert and Lucy break down in tears. Maria is given legal custody of Casey.\nMonths later Casey is still living with Maria and her family. Albert seems to be doing better now, getting modest but regular work directing TV commercials and sitcoms, and is being considered to direct a B movie, and Lucy has returned to her more down-to-earth personality.

This is mainly in the context of the press investigating his prosecution for tax evasion. A suspicious sum of $10,000 was apparently paid to Owens in a political campaign. However, whether or not he paid tax his intentions are clearly honorable: buying his parents a $6,000 house and buying his coach a new car.\nOwens is spotted at high school but no scholarship exists for athletics. It is organized to get him into college (and thereby the college athletic team) by giving his father a caretaker job at the Ohio State University. Owens starts breaking all records immediately. However, he constantly has to combat segregation laws.\nAt the 1936 Summer Olympics in Nazi Germany, all the athletes love him as he offers them free advice as to how to enhance his performance. Despite Nazi indoctrination, even the German athletes like him as he laughs off the bigotry.\nOwens debunks the myth that Adolf Hitler snubbed him, as Hitler only shook hands on the first day, so all winners thereafter were \"snubbed\".\nOn the long jump, the German umpires claim to foul jumps. On the third and final jump, his German competitor advices him to jump on a mark a foot before the white line. This he does and still breaks the record causing the whole crowd to stand.\nThe film plays little mention of the winning 100m run. More issue is made of the 200m but in particular, the relay: Coach Lawson Robertson enters the locker room and tells the all white but somewhat Jewish relay team (including Marty Glickman and Sam Stoller) that they are being replaced by Owens, Ralph Metcalfe and Mack Robinson. The Americans win by 15 yards in a world record performance and they ask Metcalfe to take the gold medal for the team.\nIn the long jump (the main focus of the plot here), Owens and his German friend Luz Long, vie jump for jump each increasing slightly with each jump. Long jumps 25' 9.5\" on his third and last jump. Owens jumps 26' 5.5\" - a superhuman feat which stood for 25 years. Long takes his hand and holds it high.\nOwens takes four golds home. Long takes the silver. We are told that Long later joined the army in the Second World War and was killed by American troops.\nIn the tax evasion story, Owens tells his family he has been found guilty and faces 4 years in prison.\nHe comes into continual confrontation with Avery Brundage, who effectively removes him from the team going to Stockholm and wants to maintain a clean reputation to all athletes.\nAbe Saperstein explains how Owens inspired the creation of the Harlem Globetrotters.\nOwens gets several ticker tape parades, but his various product endorsements come to nothing. The only project which comes to fruition is his very brief appearance in the film Charlie Chan at the Olympics. He spends some time on the road with Bill Robinson in his Mr. Bojangles show. His wife encourages him to go back to college and aim at coaching athletics. He does this and is named Assistant Trainer at Ohio State University. The university officials debate that they perhaps exploited Owens and despite his academic shortfalls, they should let him graduate. Instead, they expel him.\nIn August 1951, Jesse arrives at the same Berlin stadium where he found fame to play with the Harlem Globetrotters in front of 75,000 - the largest basketball crowd ever - who have mainly come to see Owens.\nHowever, he remains popular on the lecture circuit, as a truly inspirational man. Two thirds of his talks are free, to youth groups and the like. His wife scolds him for money to numerous individuals who ask him for help.\nHe meets with Jimmy Hoffa to try to get more black truck drivers and cab drivers in Chicago. He is very hesitant about this but speaks to Hoffa's men in a speech. The authorities get wind of this. The Governor asks him to resign as secretary of the Illinois Youth Commission.\nIn the run up to the 1968 Olympics, a committee ask Avery Brundage to be fired for racism. Brundage only takes no action: banning South Africa from the Games. Only two black men took part in the Olympics but Tommie Smith won gold. He gave the black power salute on the podium and Jesse Owens is sent to talk to the team afterwards. He says they are racist in their own right and disgraced their country. The black community dislike his links to the white world (as they see it) and start to label him as an Uncle Tom.\nOwens explains to his wife and daughters how the world is very different then (in the 1960s) than how it was in the 1930s. He explains he was grateful for whatever happened as his expectations were low.\nFinally, Owens explains to the reporter that he wanted the government to get mad with him. Keep your head down and keep out of trouble: a black man living in a white world. He does not wish to be controversial, but looking at his tax return, his emotions rose and he said \"screw them\".\nOwens sits alone in a courtroom before the others arrive. He asks his lawyer not to appeal any prison sentence. At the trial, the prosecution asks for 4 years in prison. His defense asks that his charity be brought into account. The judge outlines the purpose of tax. The judge sees the evasion as willful.\nHowever, he wants to look at \"the credit side\" of his life. He has helped many good causes and helped the community. He calls Owens a \"humanitarian\", and fines him $3,000. Owens thanks the judge, and the audience starts to clap.\nIn the final scene, while leaving court with his wife, he notices a crook breaking into his car. He races after him and catches him. The thief says \"Oh my god, you're Jesse Owens.\" He takes the crook for a walk and talks about taking a new path.\nHe is given an honorary doctorate by Ohio State University.

To discourage the kid from a life of crime, the owner tells a story by way of a flashback.\nIn 1910, Johnny Kelly is a poor but honest newsboy in New York City. Johnny's mother, Ma Kelly, needs an operation that his family cannot afford. Since Johnny's criminal father was executed, Ma has supported her sons by doing other people's laundry. Johnny's younger brother, Tommy, is fascinated by the law. Johnny gets into a street fight with a boy named Danny Vermin, which attracts the notice of local crime boss Jocko Dundee, who offers Johnny a job. Seeing no honest way to earn the money for his mother's operation, Johnny agrees, even though it would break his mother's heart. He helps rob a rival nightclub belonging to Roman Moronie, a malapropist of swear words. Moronie claims he never forgets a \"fargin'\" face. When Jocko asks Johnny for his name, he replies Johnny Dangerously.\nYears pass. With Ma Kelly's continuing medical problems, Johnny decides to work for Dundee full-time. Everyone knows that Kelly is really Johnny Dangerously, except for Ma and Tommy, who think he owns a nightclub. Similarly, the gang knows nothing of Johnny's mother and brother. One day, Johnny comes to Dundee's headquarters to find he has taken on two new gang members: Danny Vermin, and his sidekick Dutch. Danny has become a \"total scumbag\" who uses opera audiences as shooting galleries. As the two gangs continue to war, Johnny falls for Lil Sheridan, a young showgirl new to the big city. Eventually, Johnny becomes the boss of the Dundee gang and negotiates a truce with Moronie.\nEventually, Tommy graduates from law school, unknowingly funded by Johnny's illicit earnings. He goes to work for the District Attorney's office, under D.A. Burr, who is on Johnny's payroll. Burr tries to sidetrack Tommy, who has become a major public figure after hearings look into Moronie's activities. Meanwhile, Burr and Vermin conspire to kill Tommy by cutting the brakes on his car. Tommy is badly injured, but survives. Johnny has Burr killed in revenge, which leaves Tommy as the new District Attorney. Vermin discovers that Dangerously is the D.A.'s brother, and Tommy overhears Vermin chortling about it. Tommy confronts Johnny, who agrees to turn over the evidence against himself to the Crime Commissioner. However, as Johnny enters the Commissioner's office, he finds him dead, and Vermin knocks him out and frames Johnny for the murder.\nJohnny is arrested, but insists he was framed. He realizes that his lucky cigarette case is missing, and that whoever actually has it is the guilty party. Nonetheless, Johnny is found guilty, sentenced to the electric chair and sent to Death Row. But when Vermin congratulates Tommy, he drops Johnny's cigarette case. Pocketing the case, Tommy realizes Johnny really is innocent, and that Vermin is the actual perpetrator. Johnny arrives on Death Row, where he receives rock star treatment from the starstruck warden. Johnny hears word that Tommy is in danger and plots an escape\u2014with the rather strange request to the warden to move up his execution to that very night. As he is taken to the chair, Johnny assembles what looks like a tommy gun from parts handed to him by inmates. He escapes in a laundry truck driven by Lil Sheridan. Johnny, by way of a wild car chase (involving peeling off several layers of shelf paper on the truck), arrives at a movie theatre where Vermin and Dutch are behind the screen, planning to kill Tommy. Johnny runs to the front row, sees Vermin's gun barrel, jumps in front of Tommy and shoots through the screen. He wounds Vermin, and both learn that Johnny's cigarette case\u2014on Tommy's person at the time\u2014took Vermin's bullet. Vermin is arrested as the governor pardons Johnny.\nThe story returns to 1935. The young shoplifter is starstruck. Johnny wraps up his story and sends the boy off with a kitten and the lesson \"crime doesn't pay.\" When the boy leaves, Johnny changes into a tuxedo and heads off in a limo with Lil, looking at the camera and admitting: \"Well, it paid a little!\"", "tmdb_plot": "An honest, goodhearted man is forced to turn to a life of crime to finance his neurotic mother's skyrocketing medical bills.", "tmdb_id": "16806", "wiki_id": "2093425"}, {"title": "Joy of Sex", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Leslie Hindenberg has just entered her senior year of high school.

Starfighter is, in fact, an elaborate recruiting tool, designed as a test to find those \"with the gift\" (Centauri is actually criticized in one scene for placing the game on Earth, as humans were not considered capable of becoming Starfighters).

Eventually it is decided that one brother must join the Jacobites, but the other must remain loyal to the government so that, no matters who wins, the family's future will be safe. There is historical truth here, as many Irish and Scottish families did exactly this during the Jacobite years. In fact, exiled Jacobites living in France often received money from their relatives and friends in Great Britain and Ireland.\nFor the sake of the family, it would be best that James, the Master of Ballantrae, as the eldest son, stays loyal to the government; and his younger brother joins the rebels but The Master will not have it, as he craves adventure. He insists in tossing a coin and he wins ... that is, he wins the right to join the losing side. The Jacobites are defeated in the Battle of Culloden, and James is reported dead. In fact, he survives the battle and flees to England, where he teams up with another survivor, Irishman Francis Burke. They make it to the coast, where they are captured by pirates ... but James' charm and cunning soon allow him to get the upper hand and he becomes their co-leader, alongside their skipper, Captain Teach (not to be confused with the real Blackbeard of that name).\nBack home, brother Henry is held in contempt by his tenants and by James' sweetheart, their cousin Alison Graeme, who feel he should have joined the Jacobites.

Disappointingly to the company, the drilling rig produces no oil. Baldwin is then picked up from work by an airplane flown by his wife Claudia (Jaclyn Smith). On the way home, Claudia tells Michael that she wants to move the kids back to Los Angeles where they can live in a more civilized environment. Michael argues that he cannot just walk away from the exploration since it was his idea. Upon arriving home, Michael and Claudia must deal with their three children arguing with each other about the existence of Santa Claus. To make matters worse for Michael, Murdock, portrayed as the stereotyped insensitive corporate boss, threatens to terminate his employment if the exploration does not produce results.\nThe next day, Michael returns to his office, where he is met by Santa Claus\u2019s chief elf Ed (Paul Williams). Ed informs Baldwin that their dynamiting is causing damage to North Pole City, the home of Santa Claus and his elves.  He explains that while their activities at \"Site A\", their primary drilling area, are causing extensive damage, any blasts at their secondary site, known as \"Site B\", would destroy North Pole City due to the greater proximity of the dynamite blasts.  Assuming that Ed was just hired to pull off a practical joke, Baldwin bursts into uncontrollable laughter. The next day, Ed arrives at the Baldwins\u2019 house in a modified World War II-era snowcat, explaining that he intends to take Michael and his family to North Pole City to prove that Santa Claus is real and reveal the damage that is being done. Michael cannot go since he has a meeting at work, but Claudia and the kids agree to go along, continuing to assume that it's just a practical joke.\nEd then takes them to North Pole City. They meet Santa (Art Carney) and Mrs. Claus (June Lockhart). Santa shows them his secrets, including a device that slows time down so he can make all his deliveries in one night and anti-radar devices that protect North Pole City from being sighted. Santa then shows Claudia how North Pole City has sustained damage because of the dynamiting at \"Site A\" and how the city is right next to \"Site B,\" where the company may also begin to dynamite. He warns them that one blast at Site B would mean the end of the city and, therefore, Christmas as they know it. He then says that the main oil field is actually at Site A and that they will find it if they keep dynamiting there.\nUpon returning home, Claudia tells Michael and Murdock what Santa said about where the oil is. Murdock believes that Claudia and the kids were given a hallucinogenic drug by Gaylord, the corrupt head of a rival oil company, to keep them dynamiting in the wrong place. Murdock orders that Site B be dynamited on Christmas Eve so they can get to the oil before Gaylord does.\nThe kids eavesdrop on this meeting and decide to sneak out of the house in the middle of the night and take a snowmobile to warn Santa. The youngest Child, C. B., is left behind to tell the parents where the older two went. When C. B. tells Claudia, the latter takes off in her plane to look for them. She sights snowmobile tracks and follows them into an ice fog. Santa, with his sleigh and reindeer, goes into the fog to rescue them and takes them back to North Pole City. The ice fog keeps Claudia and the kids trapped inside North Pole City, so they must remain there until the fog lifts.\nMeanwhile, Michael requests that Murdock postpone the dynamiting until Claudia and the kids are found. Murdock denies the request. However, despite Murdock's orders, Michael continues to dynamite at Site A, believing that the oil field is located there regardless.  On Christmas Eve, as the dynamite crew is out at Site B counting down to the time to dynamite, C.B. receives a call at home from a crew member informing him that a gigantic oil field has been discovered on Site A. C.B. rushes out of the house to catch up with his father, who just left for work, and give him the news. He then convinces his father that the dynamiting at Site B should be canceled since the oil has been found. Michael rushes to his office and radios the man in the hut near Site B to terminate the countdown. The man then leaves the hut, jumps on a snowmobile and rides out to the site, arriving just in time to stop the dynamiting.\nThat night, Santa drops Claudia and the children off at home while making his deliveries and the family is reunited. Murdock then arrives at the door to confront Michael on his refusing to dynamite at Site B. Michael informs him that oil had been found at Site A.

He also occasionally attends public rallies at Victory Square where the citizens are shown propaganda films of the current war situation as well as contradictory and false news stories about Oceania's war effort to unite the civilized world under Big Brother's rule. While his co-worker and neighbor, Parsons, seems content to follow the state's laws, Winston, haunted by painful childhood memories and restless carnal desires, keeps a secret diary of his private thoughts, thus creating evidence of his thoughtcrime. However, he tries to do it undercover of the telescreens, to maintain his safety.\nHis life greatly changes when he is accosted by fellow Inner Party worker Julia, a mysterious, bold-looking, sensual, and free-spirited young woman who works as a print machine mechanic in the Ministry of Truth, and they begin an illicit affair.

They enter a wayang theater, where the proprietors slip into a hidden opium den within the building and warn Noodles. He is apathetic, drugged and grasping a newspaper featuring the demise of bootleggers Patrick Goldberg, Philip Stein and Maximilian Bercovicz. He recalls observing police removing their corpses, Max's burned beyond recognition. Noodles evades capture and leaves the city alone and penniless.\nIn 1918, David \"Noodles\" Aaronson and his friends \"Patsy\" Goldberg, \"Cockeye\" Stein and Dominic struggle as street kids in Manhattan's Lower East Side, committing petty crimes for local boss Bugsy. Max foils one of their robberies but has the booty stolen from him by a corrupt police officer, Whitey. Later, they blackmail the officer, catching him having sex with Peggy, a prostitute, and the five youngsters start a gang with the same level of police protection as Bugsy. Max and Noodles become best friends.\nThe group rises through the ranks after implementing Noodles' idea to hide bootleg liquor. They stash half their earnings in a railway station locker, giving the key to \"Fat Moe\", a friend not directly involved in their activities. Noodles is in love with Moe's sister, Deborah, who dreams of becoming a dancer and actress. Bugsy, now a rival, eventually ambushes the boys and shoots Dominic, who dies in Noodles' arms. In a fit of rage, Noodles kills Bugsy and injures a police officer, and is sentenced to prison.\nNoodles is released in 1930 and rejoins his friends, now prosperous bootleggers during Prohibition. His first job with them is a diamond heist using a jewelry employee and occasional prostitute named Carol as their informant. During the robbery, Carol goads Noodles into hitting her, after which he rapes her; she later goes on to become Max's moll. That the job had been commissioned by a Syndicate figure to eliminate the competition sits badly with Noodles who, unlike Max, dislikes hierarchy and lacks political ambition. The gang provides protection for Teamsters' union boss Jimmy O'Donnell, but Noodles later rejects Max's plan to deepen those ties.\nSeeking to form a genuine intimacy with Deborah, Noodles takes her on a lavish date, where she reveals her plans to pursue a career in Hollywood. On their drive back, a frustrated Noodles rapes her in the limousine. He is later met with Deborah's aloofness when he watches her board the train to California.\nThe gang's success ends with the 1933 repeal of Prohibition. Max suggests a New York Federal Reserve Bank heist, which Noodles and Carol deem a suicide mission. Carol convinces Noodles to inform the police about a lesser offense, hoping brief incarceration will cool off Max's ambition. After Noodles calls the police, Max knocks him out during a seemingly impromptu argument. This leads to the events shown in the prologue: upon regaining consciousness and learning that Max, Patsy, and Cockeye have been killed by the police, a guilt-ridden Noodles hides in the opium den. He saves Moe but finds out that his new girlfriend Eve has been murdered and the railway locker money has disappeared. With his gang killed and himself hunted by Syndicate thugs, Noodles settles in Buffalo under an alias.\nIn 1968, Noodles is belatedly informed that the Beth Israel Cemetery is being redeveloped, and asked to rebury any loved ones. Upon inquiry, the rabbi who had sent the letter informs him that the bodies of his three dead friends have since been relocated to Riverdale. Realizing that someone has deduced his identity, Noodles returns to Manhattan and stays with Moe. Inside the Riverdale mausoleum, Noodles finds a key to the railway locker. The caption on the commemorative plaque falsely states that the mausoleum was erected by Noodles himself.\nThe locker reveals a suitcase full of money, and a note stating this is a downpayment on his next job. Noodles watches news of an assassination attempt on controversial U.S. Secretary of Commerce Christopher Bailey. The report shows Jimmy O'Donnell, still a Teamsters boss, distancing himself from the Bailey corruption scandal. Noodles finds Carol in a retirement home run by the Bailey Foundation. She tells him that Max manipulated them into tipping him off to the police and opened fire first, wishing to die young rather than in an insane asylum like his father.\nAfter spotting her in the retirement home's dedication photo, Noodles tracks down Deborah, still an actress. He tells her about his invitation to a party at Bailey's mansion. Deborah admits to being Bailey's lover and begs Noodles to leave before he is confronted with hurtful revelations. Ignoring Deborah's advice, Noodles sees Bailey's son just outside, who evidently looks like a younger Max.\nAt the party, Noodles meets Bailey, who reveals he is actually Max and that he faked his death with the help of the police and Syndicate, stole the gang's money and reinvented himself as a self-made, Teamsters-connected politician. He confirms that he made Deborah his mistress years earlier. Faced with ruin and the specter of a Teamster assassination, Max reveals the job he has for Noodles is to kill him. Noodles, obstinately referring to him by his Bailey identity, refuses, explaining that in his eyes, Max died with the gang.

At one dinner, she is introduced to Nawaf Al Kabeer, who thanks Sunny on behalf of the Emir, and presents a car to her, as a thank-you gift from the Emir. She returns it, having researched that as a government employee, she is unable to accept gifts.

Before an angry Sunny can respond, a violent coup d'\u00e9tat takes place in the Emir's country of Otah, and the two are forced to flee.\nBack in the US, the government denies knowledge of the trade and the public is now questioning whether Sunny knew all along of the plan. She must also face a Congressional inquiry to find out the truth. Ransome quits his job in disgust at what was done to Sunny.\nAt the inquiry, Sunny cuts the proceedings short by accepting blame, having taken an important job without fully understanding the political affairs of her country. But she reminds everyone that leaders have a responsibility toward the people. She warns the political powers in the room that, from now on, she will watch all of them \"like a hawk.\"\nTwo years later, Sunny has married Ransome and they have a baby.

Larry does a good deed for Elliott by convincing him that the Parisian aristocrats have not forgotten about him.

He walks outside to question them and they open fire, killing the teacher and several students. Pandemonium follows as students flee amid heavy gunfire. Jed Eckert, who had dropped his brother Matt off at the high school, returns to pick up him and several of their friends, narrowly escaping the chaos.\nIn downtown Calumet, Cuban, Nicaraguan, and Soviet troops begin imposing order after a hasty occupation. Cuban Colonel Ernesto Bella instructs the KGB to go to the local sporting goods stores and obtain the records of the store's gun sales, the ATF Form 4473, to determine who owns firearms in Calumet and in the surrounding rural area.\nBrothers Jed and Matt Eckert, along with their friends Robert Morris, Danny, Daryl Bates, and Arturo \"Aardvark\" Mondragon, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at a gas station general store owned by Robert's father.

The Masons ask Jed and Matt to take care of their granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin attacking the occupation forces, calling themselves \"Wolverines\" after the school mascot. The Soviets respond with reprisals, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack. The fathers of Jed, Matt, and Aardvark are killed in one of these executions.

He informs them of the current state of the war: several American cities, including Washington D.C., were destroyed by nuclear strikes, Strategic Air Command was crippled by Cuban saboteurs, and paratroopers were dropped from airliners to seize key positions in preparation for the main assaults via Mexico and Alaska. Most of the southern United States and Northwestern Canada are occupied by the Soviets, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet advances along the Rockies and the Mississippi, and the lines have now stabilized. America's only foreign allies\u2014China and the United Kingdom\u2014remain active against the Soviets, but are militarily crippled.\nTanner assists the Wolverines in organizing raids. This draws the attention of Soviet General Bratchenko, who orders further reprisals against the civilian population. The Wolverines' actions, and the reprisals lead to the high command on both sides of the war to know the name \"Wolverines\", and the Soviet generals publicly state that the area \"may not be pacified for much longer\". Soon after, visiting the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in the crossfire of a tank battle. Daryl is caught by the Soviets after being turned in by his father. After torturing him, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a tracking device, and release him to rejoin the guerrillas. A Spetsnaz unit is sent into the mountains carrying portable radio triangulation equipment, but are ambushed by the Wolverines.

Jed and Matt attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape. The plan works, but both Jed and Matt are mortally wounded.

Since they are more dangerous than the average machine, they are handled by a division of the police trained in robotics. The \"runaway\" squad, however, is treated as an easy and unexciting assignment, and often ridiculed.\nSgt. Jack R. Ramsay is a veteran police officer who joined the runaway squad after an incident in which his fear of heights allowed a criminal to escape, which subsequently resulted in a family's death at the hands of that escaped criminal.

Investigating a household robot that murdered a family with a kitchen knife and handgun, Jack discovers strange integrated circuits, which not only override a robot's safety features but also direct it to attack humans. These circuits are not hacked chips, but created from a series of master templates, enabling them to be mass-produced.\nDespite being unable to learn anything from uncooperative informants who end up dead, Ramsay refuses to give up and soon discovers the perpetrator is sociopathic genius Dr. Charles Luther. Luther, while working for a defense contractor, developed a program that allows a robot to thermographically identify a human from amidst cover and to even differentiate between humans. Seeing the profit potential, he killed his fellow researchers and tried to sell the technology on the black market. A failed attempt to arrest Luther\u2014complicated by Ramsay having to remove an explosive shell from Thompson's arm\u2014results in the recovery of another of Luther's weapons, a smart bullet: a miniature heat seeking missile capable of locking onto a human target's unique heat signature, pursuing them wherever they run, even around corners.\nWhile investigating another of Luther's partners, Ramsay and Thompson find Jackie Rogers, who was once Luther's lover. She double-crossed him and stole the circuit templates, intending to sell them herself. She is scared because she believes Luther will stop at nothing to kill her.

Before making the exchange, Jackie gives some of the templates to Ramsay, for insurance that Luther won't kill her. But Luther kills her anyway, after discovering the templates missing.

Once Ramsay discovers his information has been hacked, he races home to find his household robot damaged and his son Bobby missing. Luther calls to confirm he kidnapped Bobby and wants to exchange him for the missing templates.\nRamsay agrees to meet Luther at an unfinished skyscraper. Luther gets the templates while in exchange Ramsay sends his son down in an elevator whereupon Luther informs him that a legion of \"assassin\" robots\u2014small, spider-like robots which kill by injecting their victims with acid\u2014are waiting to kill the first person exiting the elevator.

The experiment is considered as an epochal event and is broadcast on television. The hibernation is scheduled to last for 3 years.\nInstead of being awakened 3 years later in 1994 as planned, they wake up in the year 2044, in a post-nuclear world. Both are 86 years old, but haven't aged a day outwardly. They are being taken care of by women, which they enjoy at the beginning, especially Max, who becomes attracted to Lamia Reno. After explicitly asking to meet professor Kuppelweiser, they are informed by Lamia and Dr. Berna that he \"doesn't exist\". They explain that there was a war long ago, that all males have long been extinct, and that it is actually the 8th of March 2044 (Women's Day).The men are under constant surveillance after this. Lamia informs them their society reproduces without males through parthenogenesis. During a briefing, Max kisses Lamia, for which she knocks him down and threatens both men with euthanasia if there is another attempt at sexual assault. However, the kiss causes Lamia's drug-inhibited passions to resurface, making her both confused and fascinated. Due to her internal feelings she goes on a search for the oldest living woman to find out anything she can about the men before the war. She finds 74-year old Julia Novack, who fondly remembers her fianc\u00e9 and tells Lamia that the old world with two sexes should be restored. She also guesses that Lamia fell in love with one of the men.\nAfter several days, Max and Albert are permitted to go out to meet with Her Excellency, the supreme ruler of women. Waiting for her in the bio-sanctuary, they spot a tree with two tiny apples and eat them, having had enough of synthetic food. At the meeting they ask what womankind did to mankind. The women reply the extinction of men is not their fault, but Kuppelweiser's, who, during the war, invented an agent - the so-called M bomb - which was supposed to temporarily paralyze male genes, but, due to an oversight, instead destroyed male genes permanently. Max offers a proposal: he and Albert will serve as reproducers to restore the male population. However, the women do not wish the old order to return; Her Excellency gestures to the \"sacred apple tree\" and says it was planted by Arch Mother, and from which, when once in paradise, a male took an apple and seduced a woman with it, by which act paradise was lost to all forever. After noticing the missing sacred apples, Her Excellency becomes desperate and enraged and demands the men be taken back to their previous confinement and not be released anywhere.\nOnce again confined, the men grow distressed and plan to escape by damaging the electric power grid. They succeed, but are caught during a course organized by the special section on how to interact with men, should they ever return to the world, and are locked up again. The women provide them with their last chance: to submit themselves for \"naturalization\" - undergoing a sex reassignment surgery. When they refuse, the ceiling above the room opens, showing a huge assembly of women, who are to determine their fate. Albert and Max now face a humiliating trial, while the women blame males for oppression, virtually all evil and vices, and praise their new society. They engage in historical revisionism by claiming that the greatest scientists - such as Copernicus, Einstein and Pincus (one of the pioneers of parthenogenesis) - were, in fact, women. When Max and Albert are taken away, the assembly votes on whether the men should undergo forced 'naturalization' (proposed by group \"Archeo\") or be 'liquidated' (proposed by group \"Genetix\"). Naturalization is passed by a margin of only one vote. In the meantime, the men escape again. Wandering through what Albert calls \"a nightmarish skyscraper\", they encounter other women, who have never seen a man, and therefore view Max and Albert as their \"sisters\", provoking humorous encounters. After that the men discover a boot lying on the floor, with a bottle of Jabol (a cheap wine popular in Poland in the late 20th century) and a sheet of newspaper from 1993 with stories from the beginning of the world war. They are cornered by the security team and escape down a waste chute. They discover the nest of \"decadency\" - one of the anarchist, \"hippie\" women's groups, who do not wish to be part of the oppressive regime, playing loud music, and some engaging in lesbian relations. They mistake Max and Albert for government spies and, in the meantime, the pursuing regime forces attack, and subsequent chaos provides the men with an opportunity to escape. During their escape, the men stumble upon Lamia, who provides them with a way to see the outside - a periscope - and reveals that they live deep underground in expanded old mines. The periscope shows a dark, rocky landscape above ground, and sensors indicate high levels of \"Kuppelweiser radiation\", a side effect of the M bomb. However, it transpires that Lamia is loyal to \"Archeo\" group and her \"help\" was a ruse to capture the men and force them into surgery. Lamia is congratulated by Tekla and Emma Dax (members of \"Genetix\") for her ingenious plan, but they also inform her that their section will now be in charge of the males, which devastates Lamia.\nIn the hands of Tekla, the fate of the males is to be different. Their organs will be extracted for transplantation, and their remains will be tested for possible use as a food source, due to a growing protein shortage. The chief surgeon, Dr Yanda, an old lady, is revealed to be Max's daughter, who now delights in taking revenge for his abandonment of his wife and child in favor of hibernation for his own profit. Lamia sabotages the surgery and helps the men escape as revenge for Tekla and Dax taking the men and her research. Shortly after escaping, Albert passes out in the lift from the anaesthetic given to him in theatre, and dreams that he's in 1994, when process of hibernation has successfully finished. In the periscope room Lamia threatens the guards by telling them that she will blast the whole block if they do not give her the code activating a capsule reaching the surface, while Max and Albert find and change into protective suits. The guards claim that only Her Excellency knows the password required; enraged, Max shouts \"kurwa ma\u0107!\" (a common strong Polish profanity, lit. \"[your] mother's a whore\"), and to the surprise of all present, the capsule is activated. Lamia changes into another protective suit and joins the men. While they explore the barren surface, Max suddenly bumps against an invisible barrier and is unable to go further. He takes a knife and cuts the fabric of the barrier, revealing a dazzling light. They all go through the hole and find themselves on a beach, with the periscope area being surrounded by a small, circular tent-like structure with the barren landscape panorama painted on the inside of the canvas. They explore their surroundings and reach a forest, but the suits are running out of oxygen. Suddenly Max shouts with joy and throws away his suit, pointing skyward to a flying stork and declares \"if it can live, it means we can live too\". After removing the suits, they come across a cosy villa full of fresh food. While eating in the garden, they are found by Emma, who has been following them and, armed with a harpoon, demands their surrender, but she faints due to the lack of oxygen. Albert removes her helmet and performs CPR on her. He carries her inside the villa and starts to remove her suit. When she regains consciousness, Emma begins to fight with Albert; during their struggle, they accidentally turn on the TV and see an official government broadcast of events, stating that Lamia and Emma are dead and including an interview with \"naturalized\" Max and Albert, who claim to be feeling very well and thankful.

Captain Richard Davenport, a Black officer from the Judge Advocate General's Corps, is sent to investigate, against the wishes of commanding officer Colonel Nivens. Most assume Waters was killed by the local Ku Klux Klan, but others are doubtful.\nNivens gives Davenport three days to conduct his investigation. Even Captain Taylor, the only White officer in favor of a full investigation, is uncooperative and patronizing, fearing a Black officer will have little success. While some Black soldiers are proud to see one of their own wearing captain's bars, others are distrustful and evasive.\nDavenport learns that Waters' company was officially part of the 221st Chemical Smoke Generator Battalion.  Though eager to serve their country, they are assigned menial jobs in deference to their white counterparts. Most are former players from the Negro baseball league, grouped as a unit to play ball with Waters as manager. Their success against white soldiers gives them a good deal of popularity, with talk of an exhibition game against the New York Yankees.\nJames Wilkie, a fellow sergeant Waters demoted for being drunk on duty, initially describes Waters as a strict disciplinarian, but also a fair, good-natured NCO who got on well with the men, especially the jovial and well-liked C.J. Memphis. Davenport uncovers Waters' true tyrannical nature and his disgust with fellow Black soldiers, particularly those from the rural South.\nPrivate Peterson reveals he stood up to Waters when he berated the men after a winning game. Waters challenged Peterson to a fight and beat him badly. Interviewing other soldiers, Davenport learns that Waters charged C.J. with the murder of a white MP, after a search conducted by Wilkie turned up a recently discharged pistol under C.J.'s bunk. Waters provoked C.J. into striking him, whereupon the weapons charge was dismissed and C.J. was charged with striking a superior officer.\nWhen C.J.'s best friend Corporal Cobb visits him in jail, C.J. is suffering from intense claustrophobia and tells Cobb of a visit from Waters, who admitted it was a set-up Waters had done to others. Davenport learns from Cobb that C.J., awaiting trial, hanged himself. In protest, the platoon deliberately lost the season's last game, and Waters was shaken by the suicide. Taylor disbanded the team, and the players were assigned to the 221st.\nDavenport learns that white officers Captain Wilcox and Lieutenant Byrd had an altercation with Waters shortly before his death. Both officers admit to assaulting Waters when he confronted them in a drunken tirade, but deny killing him as they had not been issued .45 ammunition. Though Taylor is convinced Wilcox and Byrd are lying, Davenport releases them.\nPrivates Peterson and Smalls go AWOL, and Davenport forces Wilkie to admit he planted the gun under C.J.'s bunk on Waters' orders. Waters had divulged his internalized racism to Wilkie, revealing that during World War I, he helped lynch a Black soldier who acted as an Uncle Tom to French civilians. Davenport asks why Waters did not target Peterson because of their fight, and Wilkie explains that Waters liked and respected Peterson, because Peterson stood up for himself. Davenport has Wilkie arrested just as an impromptu celebration begins, as the platoon is to be shipped out to join the fight overseas.\nRealizing Peterson and Smalls were on guard duty the night of Waters' murder, and thus had been issued .45 ammunition for their pistols, Davenport interrogates Smalls, found by the MPs. Smalls confesses Peterson killed Sergeant Waters, as revenge for C.J.'s death. Captured and brought to the interrogation room, Peterson confesses to the murder, saying \"I didn't kill much.

They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable \"protomatter\" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours.

Recognizing the device's potential as a weapon, he takes his cloaked ship to the Genesis planet, destroys the Grissom, and searches the planet for survivors.\nSpock's father, Sarek (Mark Lenard), confronts Kirk about his son's death.

The probe is intercepted by an alien planet, which then sends a small scout vessel to establish first contact with Earth. Instead of greeting the alien craft, the U.S. government shoots it down. Crashing in Chequamegon Bay, Wisconsin, the lone alien occupant, looking like a floating ball of glowing energy, finds the home of recently widowed Jenny Hayden. The alien uses a lock of hair from her deceased husband, Scott, to clone a body for himself as Jenny watches in terror. The alien \"Starman\" has seven small silver spheres with him which provide energy to perform miraculous feats. He uses the first to send a message to his people stating that Earth is hostile and his spacecraft has been destroyed. He arranges to rendezvous with them in three days' time. He then uses the second sphere to create a holographic map of the United States, coercing Jenny into taking him to the rendezvous in Arizona.\nInitially hostile to and frightened of him, Jenny attempts to escape. Having a very basic understanding of the English language from the Voyager 2 disk, the Starman learns to communicate with Jenny and assures her that he means no harm. He explains that if he does not reach the rendezvous point, Arizona's Barringer Crater, in three days, he will die. Sympathetic but still wary, Jenny teaches him how to drive a car and use credit cards, so he can continue the journey alone. When he resurrects a dead deer, she is deeply moved and decides to stay with him. The authorities pursue the pair across the country. A police officer shoots and critically wounds Jenny. To escape, the Starman crashes their car into a gas tanker and uses another sphere to protect them from the explosion. They take refuge in a mobile home that is being towed. He uses another silver sphere to heal Jenny. After being assured that Jenny will recover, he proceeds to hitchhike toward Arizona without her, but Jenny manages to catch up to him while he and his driver are stopped at a roadblock. Reunited, they hitchhike together, resuming their journey towards the crater.\nLater, while stowing away on a railroad boxcar, they have sex. The Starman tells Jenny, \"I gave you a baby tonight.\" Jenny explains that she is infertile and cannot have children, but he assures her that she is pregnant. He explains that Scott is the posthumous father, as Starman used Scott's DNA to clone himself. As a child also of Starman, their son will possess all the Starman's knowledge and will grow up to be a teacher. Starman offers to stop the pregnancy if she wishes, but Jenny joyfully embraces him, accepting the gift. They accidentally travel too far on the train and arrive in Las Vegas. Jenny loses her wallet. The Starman uses one of their last quarters in a slot machine, which he manipulates to win the $500,000 jackpot. They buy a new car to complete their journey to Arizona.\nNational Security Agency director George Fox learns that the Starman's flight trajectory, prior to being shot down, was to the Barringer Crater and arranges to have the Army capture the Starman, dead or alive. SETI scientist Mark Shermin, another government official involved in the case, criticizes Fox's heavy-handed approach and reminds him that the Starman was invited to Earth. Appalled to learn that Fox is planning to vivisect the alien, Shermin then resolves to help the Starman escape rather than let Fox capture him.\nJenny and the slowly dying Starman reach the crater as Army helicopters pursue them.

Willie makes it clear that he does not want Eva there. When Eva arrives, he orders her to speak English rather than Hungarian, as Willie strongly identifies as \"American.\" He grudgingly begins to enjoy her company. He becomes protective, discouraging her from going out alone, or beyond certain streets. At one point, Eva takes the initiative to clean the apartment, which is fairly dirty. When she finds his vacuum cleaner, Willie playfully tries to persuade her that an American expression for vacuuming is \"choking the alligator\", but Eva doesn't believe him.\nDespite his growing fondness for Eva, Willie refuses to take her on his trips to the racetrack with Eddie, his good-natured friend and hustling accomplice. Eddie fruitlessly tries to persuade him to bring Eva along. Willie and Eva watch football in the afternoon and late-night sci-fi movies.

None of the knights volunteer, leading the king to shame them for their lack of courage, and accept the challenge himself. Finally, Gawain, a young squire, accepts the challenge in lieu of the king, and is swiftly knighted. Gawain beheads the knight, but the body of the decapitated knight picks up his head and returns it to his neck. Gawain kneels for the knight to strike him, but the Green Knight refuses due to his youth. Promising to return in one year to claim his side of the bargain, the Green Knight gives Gawain a chance to solve a riddle to save his life, which consists of four lines:\n\n Where life is emptiness, gladness.\n Where life is darkness, fire.\n Where life is golden, sorrow.\n Where life is lost, wisdom.With King Arthur's blessing, Gawain leaves with Humphrey, a squire, in search of the answer to the Green Knight's riddle. Morgan le Fay instructs Gawain to blow a horn near the seashore, and to go to the lost city of Lyonesse. Upon blowing the horn, a knight in black armor reveals himself to be the guardian of Lyonesse, and challenges Gawain to a duel. Despite the guardian knight's dishonorable conduct in the duel, Gawain wins, and the guardian, dying, asks to be brought home to Lyonesse. Gawain rides to Lyonesse with the guardian, and Humphrey gets separated from Gawain. Upon entering Lyonesse, the guardian knight, on his deathbed, accuses Gawain of murdering him. Pursued by the city guard, Gawain escapes with the help of Linet, a beautiful maiden who gives him her ring, which makes him invisible. Gawain falls in love with Linet, and attempts to escape the city with her, but he manages to leave the city while she is captured. While held by the guards, Linet quickly gives her ring to Gawain. Abruptly appearing in an empty field, he is told by the Green Knight that the game he accepted as a challenge has rules, rules of which have been broken by meeting Linet at the wrong time, and taking her ring. Encountering a group of monks, Gawain asks Vosper, a friar and former thief, for help with the green knight's riddle; Vosper tells Gawain to see the sage at the rock of wisdom.\nGawain agrees to follow the rules of the game, and is transported to Lyonesse by the sage, only to find the city decrepit, the denizens old and covered in cobwebs, frozen in time. Gawain carries the frozen Linet to a small house outside of the city, and revives her and restores her youth using her ring. Gawain encounters Humphrey, but while away from the house, Linet is kidnapped by the lustful prince Oswald and the army of his father, the warmongering Baron Fortinbras. Seeking to save Linet, Gawain and Humphrey sneak into the Baron's castle by blending in with a group of prisoners being transported to the castle. Gawain rallies the prisoners to help escape the castle and rescue Linet, but while the rescue mission is underway, Sir Bertilak, a rival of Baron Fortinbras, arrives and threatens Fortinbras with war if certain demands are not met. While the prisoners escape, the rescue fails when a fire breaks out in Linet's prison, leading Gawain to believe she's dead.

Several years earlier, his older son had been killed in an Army training accident, and his relationship with his only surviving son, Billy (played by Howell), is strained. Zack's no-nonsense, unpretentious style of leadership quickly earns him a reputation on-post as a tough but fair NCO, well-regarded for his compassion and integrity.\nZack owns a vintage Sherman tank from World War II that he has restored with his younger son's help, and he drives it for parades and other public events. While visiting an off-base bar, he meets a young woman named Sarah (Jenilee Harrison) and the two of them strike up a conversation over drinks. During their conversation, the local deputy sheriff, Euclid Baker (James Cromwell) sees them together and orders Sarah to get back to work, insulting her and slapping her in the process.

His plan is to escape to neighboring Tennessee, where they can get a fair hearing regarding extradition.

Hubik (Sandy Ward). The general points out that Carey had already retired from the Army, so he has broken no military law. Buelton then demands that Hubik order the post's personnel and tanks to pursue Carey, and that if refused, he will call the governor of Georgia. Hubik again declines, this time citing the Posse Comitatus Act, which states that the Department of Defense is prevented from interfering in domestic law enforcement outside the military reservation without approval from his superiors or the President of the United States. (As a running joke for the remainder of the film, an ignorant Buelton misinterprets the act's name as a dismissive insult of himself as a \"pussy Communist\".)\nThrough a long series of chases and evasion through rural Georgia, while being aided by relatives of people jailed by Buelton and who died while incarcerated, the tank and its crew quickly become folk heroes. Despite Sheriff Buelton insisting they are criminals, the nation rallies behind them as a sort of modern-day Robin Hood.

Using a vintage antitank weapon, Buelton manages to immobilize the tank within a mud flat, forcing Billy to consider surrender. However, a motorcycle gang intervenes and attaches a wire rope to the tank, and the assembled crowd works to pull the Sherman out of the trap. Buelton goes as far as to order his posse to fire at the crowd, prompting a large line of Tennessee state troopers to draw their weapons in response, threatening to \"turn this into another 'Little Big Horn'\". Buelton and his men then race into the mud flat and begin pulling on their end against the crowd. Reaching a stalemate, Hubik takes charge and has a bulldozer brought over to help free the tank. Celebrating his apparent victory, Buelton climbs onto the tank and orders its occupants to surrender, but instead, Zack instructs Billy to rotate the tank's turret, which knocks him off and face down into the mud.

The show features gladiatorial fights to the death on motorcycles and has made a hero of Drake, the unbeaten champion. Cortez is all the more bitter because he discovered Drake in the first place. WBS's current answer to the American show is 'The Danger Game,' a simulation game showing the hallucinations of a contestant experiencing the approach of violent death. Fear, panic, and screaming at the incredibly realistic simulations increase the intensity further. Unfortunately for the station, even this spectacle fails to compete against the American show.\nCortez and his two female assistants, Sybil and Sarah, receive a video message from the mysterious station boss, Sam, demanding that they recreate the formula of the gladiatorial contest and set them back to where they began: in the Coliseum. Sam orders the WBS station, a flying saucer controlled by a computer system called Junior, to fly over there and initiate training of the future contestants who will be chosen from the Death Rows around the world. Meanwhile, Drake has been imprisoned for the murder of three men who killed his wife Susan after they broke into his house, and he (conveniently for WBS) is now under the sentence of death for taking the law into his own hands.\nDrake is brought to the training compound, and a detector strip is seared into his wrist. There, he has to contend with the sadistic Chief of the Praetorian Guard, Raven, and the hostility of the other future contestants. Abdul is an African-American Muslim extremist; Akira is a notorious Japanese serial killer; Kirk is a German-born robber/killer; and Tango is a Latin American terrorist. Drake also meets an old friend from his WBS days, a deformed employee with a fiber-optic eye called Monk, who offers Drake some reassurance.\nThe next day, Drake is strapped into a 'hate stimulator' device, designed to measure the point when man can be provoked into murder. Despite the machine's best efforts, which creates holographic images of his wife's killers taunting him, Drake does not crack. Cortez's assistant, Sarah, is perturbed by this and becomes attracted to the prisoner. Drake soon earns the respect of the other prisoners after facing off in a battle of wits with the vicious Raven, who is impotent to harm the prisoners because of the upcoming TV show. Sarah meets and befriends Drake and shows him videotape evidence she has discovered that proves he was set up for his wife's murder merely to get him on the show. A strangely powerful microprocessor smuggled in by Monk facilities an escape attempt. When it fails, footage of Drake and the other prisoners in their escape attempt turns up immediately on the TV news. Raven is given limited access to torture the prisoners with electric shocks. But the harrowing experience bonds the principle gladiators even more. Meanwhile, Cortez is becoming more enraged by Sarah's investigation of Drake.\nThe following evening, Sarah visits Professor Towman (Cosimo Cinieri), the inventor of Junior, the WBS computer system, looking for a way to gain access to the restricted files. The professor has become a mystic and talks about his invention's soul. Professor Towman gives Sarah a pass-chip to access the computer when an unseen assailant suddenly murders him. But before Sarah can try to capture Sybil, she too is shot and killed by an unseen assailant.\nMeanwhile, the WBS Gladiator Contest commences, with each contesting racing around the modified arena in modified motorcycle carts fighting in a chariot-like run. Many contestants are killed, including Tango. Suddenly, Sarah interrupts the games by riding into the stadium on a motorcycle. She has discovered from the computer chip that Junior will trigger the bracelet devices of all the surviving gladiators to kill them all 20 minutes after the show ends. Revealing this information to Drake and the rest of the men, they mount an attack on the control tower, killing all the guards, including Raven. But most of the gladiators, including Akira, are killed in the assault. Drake, Sarah, Abdul, and Kirk break into the central control room and discover that Cortez is found to have plotted the death of the survivors to discredit Sam and take over as station head.

He reaches a small village where he is assigned to live with a poor as well as illiterate family with the task of recording local folk songs for use in the propagandized communist cause. The father in the family, an old widower, dislikes Gu's re-telling of social reforms about women receiving education and choosing who they will marry on their own terms within the communist domain in the province's south, but Cuiqiao, his hard-working daughter, happily listens to his tales and is joyful when her younger brother, Hanhan, becomes friends with Gu. Gu learns the hardships of peasant life and especially that of Cuiqiao. The story then focuses on the girl, who at only age 14, is told that she must marry a significantly older man in only a few months' time as her wedding dowry was used to pay for her mother's funeral and brother's engagement. She is even more miserable when Gu informs them that he must return to Yan'an. The next morning, Hanhan accompanies Gu as he leaves and they part ways. However, Cuiqiao is waiting for Gu along the way and she pleads to go along with him. Gu does not know of her forced marriage so he convinces her to go back as she cannot follow without his army's permission, but he will come back for her one day.

Cuiqiao informs Hanhan that she wants to run away to join the army and she tells him to take care of their father and give Gu some hand-sewn insoles whenever he comes back. At night, she tries to cross the turbulent Yellow River while singing a song taught by Gu Qing, but whether she makes it across remains unclear.\nFast forward to another summer, Gu returns as he once promised Cuiqiao. But there is no one in the peasant family's home, so he goes into their village and sees countless peasants led by Cuiqiao's father praying and dancing for rain because the land has dried up and peoples' crops have died: \"Dragon King of the Sea, let the good rains fall.

Since her family's disappearance on a search expedition, she has lived alone on her farm in a small valley spared from radiation poisoning. A year after the war, a stranger in a radiation-proof suit approaches her valley. Afraid he might be dangerous, Ann hides in a cave and does not warn the man when he mistakenly bathes in a radioactive stream. When he falls ill, her fear of being alone forever leads her to reveal herself to help him. She discovers that the stranger is John Loomis, a chemist who helped design a prototype radiation-proof \"safe-suit\" at an underground lab near Ithaca, New York. Ann moves him into her house and fantasizes about eventually marrying him.\nLoomis becomes delirious, with traumatic flashbacks to the underground lab. He talks of how he shot his coworker, Edward, who tried to take the safe-suit to find his family. Though troubled by this revelation, Ann nurses him through his illness and keeps secret her knowledge of Edward's death. As Loomis recovers, Ann is taken aback when he forbids her to touch the safe-suit and begins giving her orders on farming and managing resources. His explanation that they have to plan \"as if this valley is the whole world and we are starting a colony,\" makes her uneasy. Her uneasiness increases when she asks if he was ever married, and he grabs her hand roughly, rebuking her when she accidentally hits him while trying to regain her balance. One night soon afterwards, she awakes to hear Loomis in her room. When he attempts to rape her, she flees to the cave again.\nLater, Ann approaches Loomis and proposes sharing the valley and farm work but living apart. He professes surprise when she tells him she won't live with him anymore and asks why, as if he has no idea. Ann remembers that he acted the same after he had grabbed her hand, \"as if nothing had happened, or as if he had forgotten it,\" She refuses to justify her choice to him, to tell him where she is living, or to come back to live with him. Loomis answers that he has no choice but to accept her proposal, though he hopes she will reconsider and \"act more like an adult and less like a schoolgirl\". Though the arrangement is \"unnatural and uneasy,\" and Ann worries about surviving winter, she sticks by her decision and wishes Loomis had never come.  Loomis locks the store, cutting off her supplies. When she approaches him for the key, Loomis shoots her in the ankle. Ann flees, realizing that he had not shot to kill, only to lame her to make her easy to capture. Loomis uses her dog, Faro, to track her to the cave, where he burns her belongings, though Ann escapes. Ann's ankle wound becomes infected. As she recovers, she has feverish dreams of another valley where children wait for her to teach them. Ann comes to believe the dreams may be true and Loomis is insane, so she plans to steal the safe-suit and find her dream valley. Moreover, she decides to kill Faro to prevent Loomis from tracking her, though she is later unable to do so. However, Faro is fatally poisoned swimming across the dead creek to her.\nAnn finally acts on her plan. She lures Loomis from the house with a note offering to talk if he meets her unarmed, then steals the safe-suit and waits for Loomis to arrive. When he does, she reveals her knowledge of Edward's murder, which shocks Loomis enough to stop him from shooting her. He begs her not to leave him alone.

While celebrating his birthday, the Prince becomes unhappy when he discovers his older brother, Richard, is not dead as everyone thought but rather being held for ransom in Austria. As Richard is the rightful King of England, this creates a problem for Prince John. However, Gisbourne openly suggests that they tax the Saxon peasants to raise the ransom, while secretly confiding in the Prince that the King will most likely die of pneumonia before the year is out and that they will keep the money.\nThe birthday revels are interrupted by Robin Hood (George Segal), disguised in drag and reciting an offensive poem.

Jones, in his 50s, lost his left hand while working as a fireman during The Blitz. Jones is a widower when he meets the young Anna-Luise Fischer in a local restaurant. Jones is surprised to learn that Anna-Luise is the daughter of Dr Fischer, who has become rich after inventing a perfumed toothpaste and whose dinner parties are famous (or infamous) around Geneva. After a brief courtship, the two are married.\nAnna-Luise is estranged from her father, the Fischer of the book's title. Jones goes to see Fischer to inform him that he and Anna-Luise are married, but Fischer is indifferent to the information. Later, however, he invites Jones to one of his dinner parties; Anna-Luise warns Jones not to go, saying that these parties are nothing more than an opportunity for her father to humiliate the rich sycophants (whom she calls \u201cthe Toads,\u201d her malapropism for \u201ctoadies\u201d) in his coterie. Jones goes anyway when Anna-Luise relents, saying that one dinner party can\u2019t corrupt him.\nAt the party, Fischer and his guests explain some of the rules: If a guest follows all the rules, he or she receives a present (or prize) at the end of the meal. The presents are usually tailored to each guest and are worth a substantial amount of money. However, the rules include complete submission to the humiliations of Fischer, which always include barbed verbal taunts that focus on each guest\u2019s failings or insecurities.\nAt this particular party, the dinner consists solely of porridge. One guest asks for sugar, but Fischer only provides salt. Fischer explains to Jones that the guests must eat the porridge to receive their presents, and that this is all part of his experiment to see how far the rich will go to debase themselves for more riches. The guests all eat the porridge except for Jones, who earns himself the enmity of the Toads by abstaining. Jones doesn\u2019t receive another invitation for some time.\nAnna-Luise fills Jones in on the dissolution of her parents\u2019 marriage. Her mother had developed a friendship with an employee of Mr Kips, one of the Toads, based on their mutual love of Mozart. When Fischer found out, he paid Kips\u2019 firm fifty thousand francs to fire the man, and then hounded his wife until she \"willed herself\" to die. Jones and Anna-Luise encounter the man, Steiner, in a local record shop, and Anna-Luise's resemblance to her mother (Anna) gives Steiner a heart attack.\nMeanwhile, he and Anna-Luise discuss having children, but she says she would prefer to wait until after the skiing season is over because she wouldn\u2019t want to ski while pregnant. The two go on a skiing trip, and while Jones (who doesn\u2019t ski) waits in the lodge, Anna-Luise collides with a tree after swerving to avoid a young boy who had sprained his ankle while skiing a course that was too tough for him. She suffers a severe head injury and bleeds enough to stain the front of her white sweater red. She later dies at the hospital, leaving Jones broken and lonesome. He attempts suicide by drinking whiskey laced with aspirin, but it only leaves him drowsy.\nThe next day he responds to an invitation to visit Fischer in his office. Fischer offers to give Jones the money held in trust for Anna-Luise, but Jones refuses it. Fischer is surprised, and asks Jones to attend his next dinner party with the Toads, which he promises will be the last.\nThis party, the \"Bomb Party\" of the novel's alternative title, fills the longest chapter of the book. The party is held outside sometime around New Year's Day, where enormous bonfires keep the guests warm around Fischer's lawn. The meal is exquisite. Following dinner, Dr. Fischer explains the rules for that night's experiment. He has hidden six crackers in a bran tub. Inside five of them are cheques for two million francs apiece, with the name left blank. Inside the sixth is a small bomb. The guests are expected to draw crackers and open them one by one.\nOne of the Toads, a stooped man named Kips, says that gambling is immoral and refuses to take part, leaving the party instead, and leaving Jones to consider that it is only Kips and himself who take the Doctor's threat of a bomb in the last cracker seriously; the other Toads seem to be disbelieving, especially Mrs Montgomery, who passes off Fischer's bomb threat as playful, untrue banter. The other Toads begin to take the crackers; a hack actor named Deane, immediately goes into a role from one of his movies as a soldier volunteering for a dangerous mission, rambling dialogue to himself while he stands near the bucket. Two other Toads, the widow Montgomery and the accountant Belmont, rush up and draw their crackers, realising that the odds favour the earlier selectors. Both draw crackers with cheques inside. Deane finally snaps out of his delusion long enough to draw a cracker, and when he finds a cheque inside, he passes out from either shock or inebriation.\nThis leaves just Jones and the retired military officer, the Divisionnaire. The Divisionnaire takes a cracker but won\u2019t open it. Jones, still considering suicide as a way to avoid his lonely future, takes a cracker, opens it, and finds a cheque. The Divisionnaire remains paralysed by fear, so Jones roots around for the last cracker (which would have gone to Kips) and opens it as well, finding the last cheque, meaning that the Divisionnaire must hold the bomb. While Fischer torments the Divisionnaire for his cowardice, Jones offers to buy the Divisionnaire's cracker for two million francs. Over Fischer's objections, Jones takes the fatal cracker and runs off into the snow, where he opens the cracker to find nothing. Steiner suddenly wanders up to Jones, saying he came to confront Fischer and to spit in his face. Fischer arrives and after a brief conversation about whether he has achieved his goals with his experiment, says that it is \"time to sleep\" but heads away from the house. A few moments later, Jones and Steiner hear a crack, and rush off to find Fischer, who has shot himself with a revolver.\nThe novel ends with Jones saying that he is no longer considering suicide and has even struck up a small friendship with Steiner where the two meet for coffee and mourn their lost loves. Jones says he rarely sees any of the Toads and avoids Geneva for the most part; he did once see Mrs. Montgomery, who called him \u201cMr Smith,\u201d allowing Jones to pretend he didn\u2019t hear her and walk away.", "tmdb_plot": "Dr. Fischer has an unusual hobby \u2014 to expose human greed.
