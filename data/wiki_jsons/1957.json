When the stagecoach driver manages to overpower one of the robbers, Wade calmly shoots both men dead. On the way to Mexico, the robbers stop at a saloon in Bisbee for drinks. Evans alerts the town marshal of the robbery and the murders. A posse is assembled and Wade instructs his men to ride across the border to safety until he can rejoin them, while the posse heads back toward the stage. The posse meets up with Dan and the stagecoach company's owner, Mr. Butterfield, who accompany the lawmen as they head to the saloon. Charlie Prince, Wade's second in charge, returns to Bisbee to see what is holding up Wade just before the posse arrives back in town. Evans distracts Wade, allowing the marshal to come up behind Wade and arrest him. Prince is shot in the hand, but escapes on his horse to retrieve the rest of the gang.\nThe marshal requests two volunteers to escort Wade to Contention City to catch a train, the 3:10 to Yuma, where he can be held for trial. Butterfield offers to pay any volunteer $200, and Dan and a drunkard posse member named Alex Potter volunteer their services. The marshal has a man pretending to be Wade placed on a stagecoach leaving town that evening, hoping to mislead Wade's men and buy Dan and Potter some time. Wade is taken to Dan's ranch, where Alice Evans, his wife, learns of her husband's decision. Wade is subsequently moved to Contention City, where Dan and Potter meet Butterfield in a hotel room to wait for the train. Wade tries to bribe Dan into letting him go; Dan's refusal to do so impresses the outlaw.\nThe slain stagecoach driver's brother, Bob Moons, arrives and barges into the hotel room seeking revenge. Dan wrestles his gun away, but it goes off. Prince, having secretly tracked the party to Contention, hears the gunshot and alerts Wade's gang. The local sheriff is out of town, so Butterfield hires five local men to provide security while Wade is taken to the rail station. As the gang surrounds the hotel the locals run off, once again leaving only Dan, Alex, and Butterfield. Alex saves Dan from getting shot by an outlaw on the roof, but Prince shoots Alex in the back and has the men hang him from the hotel chandelier. Butterfield is horrified and offers to give Dan his money, planning to release Wade. Alice arrives and tries to change her husband's mind, but he is committed to see Wade brought to justice. Dan takes Wade out a back door, skillfully moving him across town as the outlaws fire at them.\nThe outlaws finally catch up to Dan as the train starts to leave. Prince shouts for Wade to drop down so he can shoot Dan. Instead, Wade tells Dan to jump into the passing car, and they leap to safety together. The gang runs after the train, but Dan shoots Prince dead and the rest give up pursuit. Wade explains that he owed Dan a favor for saving his life earlier, and he claims that he has broken out of the Yuma jail before, meaning Dan will be able to claim his reward honestly.

The judge instructs the Jury that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty; if found guilty, the defendant will receive a mandatory death sentence via the electric chair. The verdict must be unanimous.\nAt first, the case seems clear. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window, through the windows of a passing elevated train. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father, and the father's body hitting the ground; then, as he ran to his door, saw the defendant running down the stairs. The boy has a violent past; he had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type that was found, wiped of fingerprints, at the murder scene, but claimed he lost it.\nIn a preliminary vote, all jurors vote \"guilty\" except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He says he cannot vote \"guilty\" because reasonable doubt exists. With his first few arguments seemingly failing to convince any of the other jurors, Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one \"not guilty\" vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote; he respects Juror 8's motives, and agrees that there should be more discussion.\nJuror 8 argues that the noise of the passing train would have obscured everything the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, followed by Juror 11. Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. After looking at a diagram of the witness's apartment and conducting an experiment, the jurors determine that it is impossible the disabled witness could have made it to the door in time. Juror 3, infuriated, argues with and tries to attack Juror 8. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.\nJuror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi based on the boy's inability to recall specific details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory to make a point. Jurors 2 and 5 point out the unlikelihood the boy made a stab wound angled downwards, as he was shorter than his father. Juror 7 changes his vote out of impatience rather than conviction, angering Juror 11. After another vote, Jurors 12 and 1 also change sides, leaving only three \"guilty\" votes.\nJuror 10 begins a bigoted rant, causing Juror 4 to forbid him to speak for the remainder of the deliberation. When Juror 4 is pressed as to why he still maintains a guilty vote, he declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts to a guilty vote.\nAfter watching Juror 4 remove his glasses and rub the impressions they made on his nose, Juror 9 realizes that the first witness was constantly rubbing similar impressions on her own nose, indicating that she also was a habitual glasses wearer. He observes she also always dressed up in clothes befitting a younger woman, hence not wearing the glasses in court. Juror 8 remarks that the witness, who was trying to sleep when she saw the killing through her bedroom window, would not have had glasses on or the time to put them on, making her story questionable.

McIntosh discovers that the missing spaceship, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder, has been located. As McIntosh flies to the site, Pepe, a little boy, finds and opens a translucent cylinder marked \u201cUSAF\u201d on the beach. It contains a gelatinous mass egg, which he presents to Dr. Leonardo, a zoologist studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's granddaughter Marisa, a third-year medical student, is summoned to take care of the injured spacemen. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds his crewmate, Dr. Sharman, in the last throes of the fatal disease that killed his other eight crewmen.\nAfter Marisa returns to the trailer shared with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the egg, and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size. McIntosh arrives, accompanied by scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with two representatives of the Italian government, informing them the spaceship has returned from Venus.

When Pepe tells them that he sold the mass to Dr. Leonardo, McIntosh and Calder pursue him.\nThat night, Leonardo discovers that the creature has grown to human size. Soon after, it breaks out of the cage and heads to a nearby farm, terrorizing the animals. The creature eats sulfur and rips open several bags it discovers in a barn. While feeding, the creature is attacked by the farmer's dog, and the creature maims the dog, alerting the farmer. Calder and the others reach the barn, trapping the creature inside. Calder explains that the creature is not dangerous unless provoked. However, he provokes it by trying to prod the creature with a pole into a cage-like cart, and the creature injures the farmer after he stabs the creature with a pitchfork. After the creature breaks out of the barn and disappears into the countryside, the police commissioner insists that it must be destroyed.\nAfter the Italian government grants Calder permission to capture the creature alive, he devises a plan to ensnare it in an electric net dropped from a helicopter. The Italian police conduct their own pursuit, shooting at it with flamethrowers. Gunfire has little effect on the creature, as it has no heart or lungs. Aware that sulfur is the creature's food of choice, Calder uses bags of sulfur as bait, luring the creature to a secluded site and subduing it with an electric jolt from the net. Later, at the American Embassy in Rome, McIntosh briefs the press corps and allows three reporters to view the creature, which has been placed in the Rome zoo. There, Calder explains that the creature is being sedated with a continuous electric shock so it can be studied. Marisa, who is aiding her uncle, begins flirting with Calder. Suddenly, electrical equipment shorts out and the creature awakens.\n\nThe creature, now gargantuan in size, battles a zoo elephant and sends the panicked patrons scurrying. Taking their fight to the streets of Rome, the two beasts destroy cars and damage buildings. The creature maims the elephant and continues its rampage. Calder rams the creature with his car and tracks the creature to the River Tiber, where it submerges. Soldiers lob grenades into the river, and the creature surfaces, destroying the Ponte Sant'Angelo. It destroys part of the Temple of Saturn, killing a few soldiers, and heads for the Colosseum. As the creature disappears into the ruins, Calder charges after it with a group of bazooka-carrying soldiers, driving it to the top of the structure. Calder scores a direct bazooka hit.

Needing a new world to inhabit within the next 35 days, yet prohibited by their moral code from killing intelligent life, The Alien provides each of the five with sets of three capsules in a clear, round, hand-held case. Each set is capable of destroying all human life within a 3,000-mile diameter; their expectation is that humanity will use all the capsules, obliterating itself, leaving the Earth for the aliens to populate. The capsules' containers can only be opened by the thought waves of the person to whom they were given. Once out in the open, they can be used by anyone, but only during the next 27 days, after which the capsules become inert.

After two Communist agents nearly succeed in killing Bechner, and an innocent man who looked like Clark is killed by a mob, Clark and Eve reveal themselves and are taken into government custody.\nThrough the application of sodium pentothal to Godofsky, the Soviets discover the Alien's plan and gain access to his capsules. Their resulting announcement fuels global anxiety, prompting the other three remaining to cooperate with authorities. Confronted with an ultimatum for all U.S. military forces to withdraw throughout the world, one of Bechner's capsules is tested to verify the Soviet threat. A dying volunteer is left on a raft in the ocean, just within the 3,000 mile limit, while the U.S. Navy destroyer that delivered him sits safely outside that limit. Aboard, an emotionally wrought Bechner has to be convinced to open his case, but he is unable to use the capsules. The Admiral takes them and reads the coordinates out loud; the subject is instantly vaporized. Now convinced of the capsules' power, the U.S. military begins withdrawing its forces worldwide in compliance with the Soviet blackmail.\nAboard ship, Bechner, Clark, and Eve discuss that the Soviets must use the capsules at the last minute to avoid retaliation.

Carter tells her that he plans to visit H.L. Denham, the lawyer handling Gloria's divorce.\nDenham tells Carter that he will phone Gloria and ask to contact Carter at his hotel. As Carter waits for the elevator, Deke and a henchman named Dave accost him and take his briefcase. When the elevator doors open, the operator turns out to be Nora Ballard and, when the two thugs lead Carter towards their car, Ballard runs out after them on the pretense of recognizing Carter as old acquaintance and calls out to a police officer asking for a lunch recommendation. The officer approaches and the thugs turn for a hasty retreat to their car while Bill retrieves his briefcase by pulling from under Deke's arm. As Ballard and Carter start walking, she informs him that Denham is actually Lamarr's attorney and that the obvious place to find Gloria would be at Lamarr's casino.\nAt the casino, a drunk named James T. James from Omaha approaches their table, drinks from Carter's glass and collapses. Ballard tells Carter that the Mickey Finn was intended for him and, as Lamarr enters with Gloria, follows her to the ladies lounge where she introduces herself as Nora Wellington, one of the staff writers for women's fashion magazine Today's Star and flatters Gloria into engaging in a revealing conversation. In the meantime, as Carter puts coins into a slot machine, he is approached by Lamarr who knows all about the reason for his presence and tells Conrad Hertz, the headwaiter, to show Carter out.\nBallard follows him outside and tells him that Gloria is staying under an assumed name at the Half Moon Lodge. At the lodge, however, before Carter can explain his mission to Gloria, Lamarr walks in and tells Gloria that J.B. Del Monte offered him a bribe not to marry her and that he said no. As Gloria watches, he tells Carter and Ballard to get out but, the following morning, having been instructed by Lamarr, Gloria phones Carter at his and Ballard's two-room hotel accommodation and offers to pick him up in her car for a drive and conversation. Ballard comes out of the shower and objects, but Carter leaves and discovers that Gloria is driving him to a deserted spot outside of Reno where Deke and Pete are waiting for him. She then drives off while Deke and Pete proceed to assault Carter, tearing his jacket, discovering J.B.'s hundred thousand dollars, taking the jacket with the money and driving away.\nAs Carter walks dejectedly along the highway, Ballard drives up, offers him a seat in her car and reveals that she replaced the hundred thousand dollars with \"Michigan bankrolls\" of hundred dollar bills fronting one dollar bills for a total of one thousand. At their hotel, Lamarr is waiting and tells Carter that he intends to marry Gloria unless Carter loses J.B.'s money gambling at the casino. As Bill gambles away Gloria's father's money, Nora tells her about the scheme and Gloria goes to the casino and insists that Bill win back all the lost money. In his office, refusing to pay, Lamarr reaches for a gun, but Ballard uses judo to subdue him and collect the winnings.\nAs Carter, Ballard and Gloria drive away from the casino, headwaiter Hertz revives Lamarr who gets into a car with Deke and Pete and orders Deke to drive after Carter's car. Ballard advises Carter to turn onto an airport-bound difficult side road where Deke loses control and plunges the pursuing car into a shallow pond. At the airport, Gloria runs to catch her flight, leaving behind her father's money. Carter is told by a police officer that he is due a speeding ticket and Ballard informs him that she will protect the money and him.

Amaravathi, the beautiful princess and Ambikapathy, the handsome and talented son of Kambar, fall in love. Ambikapathy is a bold, assertive and supremely self-confident youth, who even at that age, exhibits poetic skills equal to that of his illustrious father. Ottakoothar is doubly dismayed when he hears of this affair, for he had planned to bring about the marriage of Amaravathi with his stooge, Prince Kulasekharan of Vengi. With a brilliant, cunning mind at work, Ottakoothar sets about poisoning the King's mind against Ambikapathi and contrives to bring about various situations wherein Ambikapathi might fall to disgrace. Luck seems to be on Ambikapathi's side as he comes unscathed through these traps.\nHowever, when Kamban discovers his son's love for the princess and realizes the gruesome retribution that would undoubtedly follow, he pleads with Ambikapathi to give up his love.

The King is shaken by this clinching evidence of the love affair, and is determined to put it to an end. However, wishing to avoid any unwanted publicity and not willing to take any drastic measures, at the suggestion of Kamban, the King orders Ambikapathi to go to the distant Pushpaga Theevu, apparently to propagate the greatness of Tamil.

But Amaravathi intervenes, claiming equal responsibility for whatever may have been the crime that Ambikapathi is said to have committed. In the ensuing argument, the King condemns Ambikapathi as sham poet who could write only verses that cater to man's baser instincts. Ambikapathy is outraged at this slur on his poetic capabilities. The upshot is that if Ambikapathi could sing 100 devotional songs in succession, the King promises him Amaravathi's hand in marriage. If he failed in this challenge, he would be executed forthwith. Amaravathi visits Ambikapathi in prison that night and urges caution. Ambikapathi laughs away her fears, assuring her that he is wholly confident of his own capabilities. A relieved Amaravathi says that she would be counting the songs, and would appear before him at the end of the ordeal.\nThe court assembles next day at the vasantha madapam, and in the august presence of the King, ministers and scholars, Ambikapathy commences his soiree with a short invocation to Saraswathi, the Goddess of learning. Amaravathi mistakenly counts this as one of the hundred songs, and so at the end of the 99th song, she appears happily in front of Ambikapathi to signal his victory. Overjoyed at sighting his beloved, and thinking that he has completed the hundred songs, Ambikapathy bursts into a verse in praise of Amaravathi's appearance. Rising with grim satisfaction, Ottakoothar points out that only 99 devotional songs had been sung, and hence Ambikapathy has lost the challenge.

Captain Jimmy Leith, a Welshman, is an amateur volunteer with extensive knowledge of the area who knows a local guide and speaks fluent Arabic as well. It is decided that both officers will go, with Major Brand in command. The men see Brand as a disciplinarian - \"the only thing he's slept with is the rule book\".\nMajor Brand's wife Jane is a Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) Flight Officer who enlisted to be near her husband. When Brand invites Leith to drinks with his wife, he picks up the fact that the two had had an affair before she married Brand. Leith had walked out on her without explanation.\nThe unit parachutes behind enemy lines with the mission of attacking a German headquarters and bringing back secret plans from a safe to be opened by Wilkins, an experienced safecracker.  Dressed as local civilians, Brand's hand shakes with fright when he has to knife a German sentry; the deed is done by Leith.\nThe mission is completed with the British suffering only one death and one man wounded. The patrol ambushes a German detachment, capturing Oberst Lutze, who Brand knows was responsible for the secret information. Possibly in the hope of getting rid of Leith, Brand leaves him alone with two seriously wounded men, one British, one German. Leith decides to put them out of their pain. He shoots the German, who pleads for his life. The Briton encourages Leith to act quickly and get it over with. Leith puts his pistol to the soldier's head and fires but there are no bullets left. Rather than reloading, Leith picks the man up and sets out to carry him to safety. The man cries out in agony and curses Leith's failure, but dies before Leith puts him down again. Leith, whose Arab friend has joined him, then catches up with the rest of the unit.\nThe patrol is supposed to escape on camels but they discover the men left with them have been murdered and the camels taken. During the long march back across the desert, Brand's animosity towards Leith grows, not only due to the affair with his wife but to Brand's fear that Leith will reveal him as a coward to headquarters and destroy his career. While the group are resting, Brand sees a scorpion climb up the leg of Leith's trousers but does not warn him in time. When Leith is stung, Brand refrains from shooting him as his orders permit and lets him die in pain during a sandstorm. The men believe he killed him.\nA patrol eventually picks up the group and takes them back to HQ. Brand's wife is distraught to learn of Leith's death and when Brand is immediately awarded the Distinguished Service Order, instead of congratulating him, she walks off disconsolate.

Eddie then visits his mother (Argentina Brunetti) to ask her where Johnny is, but she proclaims that even though she once took a bullet to protect Kubik's life, she no longer trusts the man, in large part because Gino had told her not to. Indeed, she tells Eddie as he is leaving not to trust anybody. When Eddie tells her that Johnny's life is in danger, she laments, kneeling to pray in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary she has sitting on a shelf, but refuses to tell Eddie anything. Finally, as Eddie is walking out the door, she relents and reveals, with great trepidation, that Johnny last wrote her from El Camino, California.\nEddie has to take two planes to El Camino, where he finds Johnny and his pregnant wife, Norah (Kathryn Grant) hiding out on a friend's farm. Johnny says he's left the syndicate because he wants his son to grow up to be clean and not know a life of crime. Norah, pregnant, is distraught at the prospect of Johnny being dragged back into the syndicate and collapses; she needs a doctor and one is called. Johnny tells Eddie to leave.\nEddie returns to his hotel where Mike Lamotta (Harry Bellaver), a local crime boss, is waiting in Eddie's room. There, Eddie realizes that Kubik has used him to locate Johnny and all along has intended that Johnny be killed. Lamotta orders Eddie to call Johnny and tell him to meet the mobsters waiting outside the house where he's staying. Instead, after Johnny joyously tells Eddie that he's a new father, Eddie urges Johnny to go to the cops; he is immediately knocked out by Lamotta's assistant, Gonzales (Rudy Bond). To save his wife and newborn son, Johnny goes outside, where he is killed.\nAs Eddie and Gonzales fly back to Florida, Eddie learns that Gino had attempted to flee the country and was also killed. While in a bathroom during their stopover in Phoenix,  Eddie knocks Gonzales out. He takes Gonzales' pistol and calls Alice, telling her to leave their house in Florida and meet him in New York at a special place only they know about. Eddie then manages to elude Kubik's minions by hitching a ride to New York in a truck transporting new cars.\nHe goes to Peter Malaks and informs him that both his brothers have been murdered and that he intends to testify against the syndicate. Malaks, now convinced of Eddie's sincerity, agrees to meet him the next day at a bank where Eddie will give him money to care for his now-widowed sister and their new nephew.\nThe next day, Eddie goes to the bank (where an informant there recognizes him and rats him out to Kubik via phone), gets a pile of cash from his safe-deposit box, and puts some in three envelopes\u2014one for Malaks, one for Alice so she can get safely out of the country, and one for his mother. He meets Malaks and Alice outside in a cab and gives each their envelopes. He sends the weeping Alice to the airport with Malaks. When Eddie goes to say goodbye to his mother and give her her envelope, Kubik is there and holds him at gunpoint. Eddie pulls out the gun he took from Gonzales in Phoenix and kills both Kubik and his accomplice, but is wounded himself.\nIn a newspaper headline shot, we discover that Eddie, apparently recovered from his wound, has testified against the syndicate and that it has been successfully prosecuted and destroyed. The final scene shows Eddie driving with Alice up to the children's home where they apparently are meeting with the administrators to finalize the adoption of their new child.", "tmdb_id": 35017}, "29472852": {"title": "The Buckskin Lady", "plot": "Drunken Doc Medley (Henry Hull) and his daughter Angie (Patricia Medina) support themselves by Angie's gambling skills as her father steers travelers to her card table.

The drier quarters that he decides to move into is a condemned building nearby. Staying inside a hole, he is pleasantly surprised by the building.\nHowever, after complimenting the place, police sirens begin to go off, as Rocky and Mugsy escape from the cops and run quickly up to the exact floor that Bugs is staying at. The two criminals look out of the window to see if the police had gone; They had. In Rocky's words, they both 'gave them the slip'. Mugsy congratulates the boss for being smart. He then turns on the radio, by Rocky's command. The station that they listen to had breaking news, explaining that Rocky and Mugsy had both commited an unknown robbery. Before hearing where they were last seen, Rocky tells Mugsy to turn off the radio.\nBoth of the criminals look at the priceless jewelry stolen in the briefcase. Before Mugsy can touch the '14-karat', saying that they got 'some haul', Rocky agrees but gently hits Mugsy's hand with a gun.\nAfter hearing the word 'karat', Bugs assumes that there is carrots somewhere in the building, so emerges from the hole. Bugs hears Rocky telling Mugsy that they should both 'get some shudeye', getting ready to pull yet another robbery the next day. Bugs talks briefly to the audience saying that somebody should teach them that crime doesn't pay; That someone is him.\nAs both of them fall asleep, Bugs puts a telephone beside Rocky's ear. As Bugs begins talking to Rocky, his cigarette flips up. Bugs explains to Rocky that he trusted Mugsy with the briefcase, ending by saying \"Don't make me laugh.\" Rocky opens his eyes, and looks around but shrugs his shoulders and goes back to sleep. Bugs, once again, tells Rocky that Mugsy is getting ideas to keep the briefcase for himself. Now wide awake, Rocky slaps Mugsy a few times, teaching Mugsy to 'get good ideas'. Mugsy is confused.\nAfter going back to sleep, Bugs then gives Mugsy, still asleep, an axe before going back into the hole. Bugs once again tells Rocky, also asleep, on a telephone that \"they don't call Mugsy the 'Detroit Butcher' for nothing.\" and suggests that Mugsy could kill Rocky any minute so he can take all the jewellery. Once again waking up, Rocky is shocked to see Mugsy sleeping with an axe in his hand. Mugsy is barely close to Rocky chopping his head in half, as he wakes just before Rocky can do it. Rocky only chopped a part of the couch Mugsy was sleeping on. Rocky then explains that Mugsy's devious scheme didn't work. Mugsy's hat then falls in half, revealing his yellow hair. Mugsy soon describes Rocky as 'a million laughs', and chuckles.\nBoth Rocky and Mugsy try to go asleep again (with Mugsy worrying sick that Rocky is going to get him again) but Bugs, above the floor, unscrews the bolts on a huge light, where Rocky is sleeping underneath it. However, before accomplishing another trick, Mugsy wakes up and sees the rabbit unscrewing the light. He grabs a ladder and attempts to screw them back in. Unfortunately for him, the light fell before he could screw in a single bolt. Rocky commands Mugsy to go down and kicks him multiple times in the backside.\nBugs checks if Rocky is asleep (which he is) and replaces his cigarette with a stick of dynamite and tip-toes over to Mugsy. In a Rocky-ish voice, Bugs tells Mugsy to \"give me a light\". Mugsy, being relieved that Rocky isn't mad at him, lights the dynamite. It explodes and Mugsy is sad that Rocky's mad at him again. Rocky punches and kicks Mugsy, ties him up and throws him out of the room, into the hallway. Rocky then shouts at him to go to sleep and hits Mugsy on the head with a baseball bat.\nBugs saws a circle around Rocky's chair, but he soon wakes up and realises what is currently happening. He and the chair both fall down and smash into un-coming things. Emerging from the hole, Rocky shoots his gun, believing that somebody is there. Bugs opens a floorboard to the corrider and gives Mugsy the saw. Rocky opens the door and is fuming when he sees Mugsy with the saw in his hand. He then says \"I don't know how ya's done it but I KNOW YA'S DONE IT!!\" and smacks Mugsy, leavin' cracks in the walls. \nAfter Rocky re-enters the room, Bugs, this time, ties Mugsy on a pair of roller-skates, as Rocky points his gun outside the door. Underneath, Bugs uses a magnet to control Mugsy's movement on the ground. Mugsy runs into the door, with roller-skates on, as Rocky is stunned. Mugsy shrugs his shoulders, as Rocky tells him to take them off. Unfortunately for him, Mugsy ramages into Rocky and smacks into the wall. Rocky punches Mugsy across the room but Mugsy, once again, smacks Rocky into the wall. This continues happening until the police hear the commotion in the condemned building and surround the place.\nRocky and Mugsy are then both taken away by the cops. As Mugsy tries to say what had happened, Rocky punches him and kicks him on the ground.

Gladden is dispatched to case the spiritualist's estate. Posing as a devotee of the group's work, she is invited by Sister Sara to stay for lunch and dinner.\nGladden reports back to Harbin about where to find Sister Sara's safe. The safest time to rob it is when Sister Sara is absorbed in the evening television newscast. Parked near the mansion, Harbin enters through a window, quickly finding the safe while Sister Sara watches the news downstairs.\nAs Harbin works on the safe with a muted drill, he is signalled that he is needed outside. Two officers in a police car have approached the thieves' car while Harbin's two cohorts hide nearby. Harbin tells the policemen that he has had car trouble and will wait there until morning when he can get help. Apparently convinced by his story, the policemen drive back to their station. Harbin hurries back to the safe, succeeds in opening it and taking the necklace.\nSister Sara is shocked to discover the burglary while getting ready for bed. In the meantime, Harbin and the two others change their car's license plates and make their getaway. They are followed, however, by another car. At their hideout, Blaylock and Dohmer are eager to fence the necklace and get their share of the money, but Harbin says that they have to wait until news of the robbery dies down and to increase the return they might get from a fence. At police headquarters, one of the officers that talked to Harbin makes a police artist create a sketch of the suspected robber.\nAt the gang's hideaway, tensions build within the group. Gladden is especially out of place and unhappy, with Dohmer clearly lusting after her. Blaylock wants to leave the country quickly and achieve his dream of a quiet life in Central America. Harbin seems anxious and unable to act and tells Blaylock about his and Gladden's past and the responsibility he feels for her. After a violent altercation with Dohmer, Harbin sends her off to Atlantic City to wait for him.\nWhen Gladden takes the train to Atlantic City, she is followed by a man whose face we cannot see. The same man later approaches her on the beach, and the two strike up a relationship but his face is still not revealed to the camera. In Philadelphia, Harbin meets a woman named Della who tells him about her own hard life and invites him to her apartment. Having fallen asleep, Harbin awakens to find her gone from the apartment. Stepping outside, he sees her with another man, apparently the same faceless man who has been getting close to Gladden, and hears the two conspiring about getting the necklace. He then quickly steals away.\nRealizing that Gladden is in danger, Harbin drives toward Atlantic City with Blaylock and Dohmer, but a toll booth operator recognizes him from the police sketch and calls the authorities. A bit later, the gang's car is stopped by an officer for a routine traffic violation. Panicking, Dohmer shoots the policeman, who fires back and kills him. Harbin and Blaylock abandon the car with Dohmer's body near Atlantic City, where they take refuge in a deserted shack. Knowing that the man he heard with Della has been pretending to be Gladden's boyfriend, Harbin calls her hotel room and tells her to send the boyfriend away so that he can see her. When the man comes downstairs to the lobby, his face is finally revealed and Harbin realizes that he is Charlie, one of the officers who questioned him on the night of the burglary.\nIn Gladden's room, Harbin hides the necklace under her pillow after the two quarrel. When Harbin goes back to the shack, Gladden finds the jewels and hides them in her own small musical jewel box. Charlie, meanwhile, has called Della and told her to come to Atlantic City. At the shack, Charlie has killed Blaylock and confronts Harbin, offering to spare him and even give him a cut of the money he'll get if Harbin gives him the necklace. Once Della arrives, Harbin reveals that he hid the jewels in Gladden's room, and Charlie heads out, leaving Della to hold a gun on Harbin. Harbin, though, walks out, hoping that Della will not be able to shoot him, which she does not.\nHarbin is able to call Gladden at her room just before Charlie can arrive.

As Howard was previously picked up by German Abwehr counter-intelligence, Ranson soon realizes that their assignment is to feed misinformation to the Germans about the location of the D-Day landings; they are to make it look like it will be in the occupied Netherlands. Howard tells him the rest of the unit must not know the truth.\nOne night, while on a date with Rolande Hertog, the unit's radio operator, Ranson becomes concerned and returns to the offices. He is shot at and wounds an intruder. He leaves the unconscious man with Hertog to search further but the man's accomplice gets away. Hertog kills the captive, claiming he tried to grab her gun. A romance quickly develops between Ranson and Hertog the same night. When Ranson gets back to the office, Howard criticises his actions; MI5 had tipped him off that the Germans were planning to search his offices, so he made it easy for them to get the planted misinformation, until Ranson intervened. Further, he suspects that Hertog is a German agent; Jan Guldt, their liaison with the Dutch underground, had been sent back to The Netherlands, only to be captured immediately. Ranson does not believe it.\nHoward sends Piet van Wijt to The Netherlands, supposedly to evaluate the effects of a bombing raid, but actually to test Hertog. They do not hear from van Wijt again. Meanwhile, Howard receives news that the Germans are redeploying troops into the country.\nHoward orders Ranson to keep seeing Hertog so she will not become suspicious but Ranson is an unconvincing actor. Now suspicious, Hertog goes to her sector commander, Hauptman Hans Faber, who is posing as a dentist. Faber is not fully convinced by her claim that it is all a fraud but needs to make sure. He arranges for the young son of Dr Mulder, Howard's psychological warfare expert, to be kidnapped. Mulder is forced to reveal the supposed invasion location to save his boy's life. However, he later confides to Hertog that he does not believe that the Netherlands is the place. The two men who were sent behind enemy lines were not given poisonous cyanide capsules to avoid capture. If they had, they could have taken them; then they could \"count five and die\". She tells Muller to go home, that she will alert Ranson. Instead, she tries once more to persuade Faber to change his mind but without success.\nHoward and Ranson speak to Mulder and realise the situation. They manage to capture Faber and free Mulder's son although Martins gets away and Faber bites his cyanide capsule.

A 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, stirs. The personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls. Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. Joe sends his pilots out to investigate when a radar blip is sighted, but their target disappears.\nAn Air Force plane is attacked by the mantis. Joe searches the wreckage and, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long spur in the snow. He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense (CONAD) in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object. When they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. After examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and narrows it down to a gigantic praying mantis.\nIn the Arctic, the mantis attacks an Inuit village. Ned is sent to Red Eagle One to investigate further. Museum magazine editor Marge Blaine gets permission to accompany him as his photographer. All the men at the base, including Joe, are smitten by Marge.\nThat night, Marge and Joe join Ned in his office and discuss the mantis. The mantis attacks the building. Although the full unit opens fire on the mantis with automatic rifles and a flame-thrower, it is unscathed and moves away only after aircraft encircle it. Hours later, the base remains on red alert. The mantis attacks a boat off the Canadian coast, which means that it is flying at a speed of 200 miles an hour. Ford calls a press conference to announce the mantis's existence and ask the Ground Observer Corps to track its whereabouts.\nOver the next few days, Ned, Marge, and Joe track the bug's progress with the help of military and civilian observers. One night, Joe drives Marge home, stopping briefly for a kiss. They are distracted by reports of numerous unexplained wrecks in the area. A woman leaving a bus sees the mantis, and all emergency personnel are put on alert. The mantis is sighted in Washington, D.C.\nJoe is one of the pilots who attempt to drive the mantis toward the sea, but a dense fog throws him off course, and he flies directly into it. As the wounded mantis drops to the ground and crawls into the Manhattan Tunnel, Joe safely parachutes to the ground. Ford leads a team that seals off the tunnel, filling it with smoke to provide cover for Joe and his special unit, who enter the tunnel armed with rifles and three chemical bombs. They shoot at the mantis, but it lumbers on, forcing them backward. Joe throws a bomb in its face, and it collapses, dead.\nFord, Ned, Joe, and Marge enter the tunnel to examine the bug.

Blinded by hate, Bart has only one thing in mind: to seek revenge from Tate Kimbrough whom he believes had once immorally seduced and then abandoned his wife Mary, which finally led to her committing suicide. At least this is the story Allison believes. More probably his wife at that time had fallen out of love with him and intended to leave him, being genuinely attracted to the womanizing Tate, who later spurned her and renounced their relationship. Tate has taken political and economic control of the little town of Sundown. The citizens don't appreciate him but yield to his influence probably out of fear and material interest.\nThe very day that Bart shows up in the town, Tate is preparing to get married to Lucy Summerton, the \"finest and prettiest young lady\" in Sundown, according to the barber in whose shop Bart finds an opportunity to get a shave. He intends to stop the ceremony from taking place by objecting to the wedding after the priest's traditional question. Tate has no real romantic interest in Lucy; the marriage is probably part of a scheme that will fortify his influence in the town. To the disapproval of Lucy's father, Tate spends time with Ruby James with whom he is probably sentimentally involved but also a little rough-mannered. She is supposed to leave town after the ceremony but she insists on attending the wedding in the church despite Tate's disapproval. She even has the nerve to sit on the front pew with the town's doctor, John Storrow, secretly also in love with Lucy and having a great moral and humane influence in the town, helping everybody out as well as making various hints at a possible opposition to Kimbrough's greedy control of the local community. Bart does not hesitate to show his animosity concerning the local boss and even goes as far as creating tension between him and the sheriff Swede Hansen, refusing to have his drinks paid in honor of Tate Kimbrough's wedding. After succeeding in spoiling the whole ceremony and in staying unscratched in a shootout, Bart & Sam find refuge in the local livery stable. The bride refuses to go on with the ceremony until the situation is cleared.\nThe doctor and Morley Chase, a local opposing ranch owner, show a certain understanding of Bart's predicament. Doctor Storrow is coming to the livery stable to take care of Spanish, one of Kimbrough's wounded hired guns. He tells about his strong resentment concerning Tate's bad influence in the town since he came to take it over. Anxious and in a hurry to get rid of this unexpected opponent, Tate decides to pretend to propose Bart a deal: he wants to make him believe that if he leaves the livery stable, he will let him ride away out of town unharmed. Mr. Summerton, the bride's father, is trying to talk Bart into accepting the deal. He even suggests adding an interesting amount of money to convince the man. The deceptive proposal is rejected and Tate's bride persists in refusing to resume the wedding ceremony. She thinks everything over and ends up reconsidering her relationship with Tate whose affairs with Ruby and also previously Mary make her feel uncomfortable. Lucy goes to the livery stable and makes Bart realize that maybe his deceased wife was not so faithful and trustworthy as he might have imagined, trying thus to reduce Bart's obsession with killing Tate. Bart violently throws her out but starts thinking. Sam tries to confirm Lucy's point of view but gets his head knocked off by an infuriated Bart. Sam is allowed to have lunch at the local restaurant since the possibility to leave unharmed is also valid for him. Unfortunately Spanish shoots him in the back when he announces he wants to ride out of town. This outrageous killing contributes to the people's change of heart concerning Tate and the opposition to the local boss is growing. Storrow addresses the people's consciences at the saloon and stirs up further the emotions. Morley Chase and his men take sides with Storrow and Bart and therefore disarm some of Kimbrough's men. The local boss loses his effective power.\nNevertheless, they give the sheriff back his gun so that the situation amounts to a showdown between Sheriff Hanson and Bart Allison. The latter is faster on the draw and shoots Kimbrough's sheriff down. Yet unluckily, he injures himself on the palm of his hand. While bandaging Bart's hand, Storrow tries to talk him out of a showdown with Tate Kimbrough who thinks he can win back his power if he shoots the disturber. On her side, Ruby is trying to make Tate renounce and leave town but the man doesn't let her convince him. He shows certain anxiety but his courage makes him go down and face Bart.\nTate gets out into the street to meet Bart but to everyone's surprise, Ruby shoots him in the arm with a Winchester to wound him and save his life, forcing him to abandon the confrontation. Bart wants him to take his gun and resume the fight but Ruby tries to explain to him his hate is not worth it since he \"never had a wife\". Storrow confirms her point saying he has learned it from Sam. Ruby and the injured Tate withdraw and Bart lets it happen, finally accepting the bitter truth after three years. Ruby and a beaten but living Kimbrough leave the town in a buggy. Bart drowns his blues in drinks and rejects the townpeople's friendly attitude, once more refusing to have his drinks paid.

They flee Milan to hide out on a lake on the Italian-Swiss border (Lake Lugano or Lake Maggiore). Fearing arrest by the police, Catherine persuades Frederick to flee to Switzerland by rowboat; after some adventures, they land successfully in Switzerland.

The car pulls up before a large Gothic mansion; the dreamer enters and walks to where a painting of the same house hangs above the mantelpiece; the camera zooms in on the door in the painting. The dreamer, Oliver Branwell, awakes with a start.\nBranwell is an insurance investigator with a London firm of adjusters, Anderson & Son. Though it is Christmas Eve, he is sent north to Lowis Manor to probe a recent fire. Mr. Tracey Moreton lives there with his mother and wife Sarah. He introduces Branwell to them and to a neighbour, his cousin Clive. Branwell and the wife exchange glances but do not reveal that they had been lovers five years earlier in Hong Kong. Branwell reviews the fire damage and discovers, among several scorched paintings, one resembling the picture in the dream (an old and valuable distant view of the manor, by Bonnington) which is apparently irreparable.\nThe insurance company pays out on the damage and the painting. Months later, in a new case, Charles Highbury, known as \"The Singing Miner,\" makes an insurance claim for loss of his voice. He has a black eye, given to him by his wife upon discovering him having an affair with a Mrs. Vere Litchen. Branwell visits Litchen, to see she possesses a painting resembling the apparently destroyed work. Later, he confirms that the manor house is indeed the one in the landscape and he enquires about its provenance. The investigation points to Sarah having sold the painting and making a false insurance claim.\nBranwell educates himself on how to spot fake paintings and, believing the occupants to be away, breaks into the manor one night to inspect the authenticity of the paintings. Finding Moreton's dead body downstairs, where it had fallen from a first floor balcony, and, nearby, a distinctive smoking cigarette, he becomes aware a fire has been started in the cellar. He tries to extinguish it, but is unsuccessful. After calling the fire brigade, pretending to be Tracey Moreton, he escapes. The fire destroys the house and any remaining paintings (which Branwell now knows to be fakes). He invents an injury to pass handling of the case to his boss and keeps silent about what he knows for Sarah's sake. In due course, the insurance company settles a \u00a330,000 claim on Sarah Moreton.\nTime passes. Sarah visits Branwell, but he is convinced she is implicated. After a misunderstanding, a relieved Branwell realises Sarah is innocent of the arson and goes to show her photo to Mrs. Litchen's rich fianc\u00e9, Croft, who confirms Sarah is not the woman who sold him the painting. He apologises to Sarah and they agree to return the payout. He proposes, and they marry in haste before departing on a honeymoon to France.\nIn France, Sarah is horrified to receive a ring in the post that Tracey Moreton always wore and the couple immediately cut short their honeymoon. In London, she and Branwell are blackmailed for half the payout through an agent representing an individual who clearly knows of the insurance scam. The police are becoming suspicious and question Branwell.\nThe Branwells follow the agent to the premises of an Ambrosine, the forger of the paintings, and discover she was the painting's seller and is in league with Clive Fisher. Arriving, Fisher confesses to the blackmail but denies Moreton's murder and any connection to the ring. Back in their hotel room, the couple discover that Sarah's poodle has been kidnapped. Sarah later finds a cigarette butt left by the kidnapper that Branwell had hidden. Sarah recognises the brand and goes to Lowis Manor, pursued by Branwell, who finds Sarah with Tracey's mother, Mrs. Moreton. The old lady acknowledges she had suspected her son was intent on destroying the manor as an insurance fraud and had been in the house when her son died. They had argued and, in a fit of rage, Tracey had fallen from the balcony to his death. Mrs. Moreton had kidnapped the poodle and sent the ring to pressure the Branwells into staying silent and thereby preserving her dead son's reputation.

Moments later, plastic surgeon Dr. Petrov leads Stalin into the operating room and transforms his face so that he is unrecognizable. After his handlers announce publicly that Stalin has died, they secret him away to a hideout, where Greta Grisenko serves as his nurse. Meanwhile, Greta's twin sister Lili continues searching for her, as she has been ever since Russian troops invaded their home country of Lithuania and took Greta, against her will, to Moscow. Earlier, Lili had engaged private investigator Steve Anderson, an American living in Berlin, to find Greta, and now locates him there and asks why he has failed to contact her with information about her sister. Steve has discovered that Greta is working in Moscow and, despising Communists, refuses to work with Lili until she convinces him that her sister is an innocent victim of the Russians.\nSteve takes Lili to the home of Mischa Rimilkin, a one-armed espionage agent who reveals that Greta has been working for Petrov. Upon receiving assurance from the U.S. Army that Lili is not a spy, the men divulge to her that Dasha, now confined to a mental hospital, claims that Stalin has been surgically altered and is living clandestinely with Greta.\nThe next day, Lili once again pleads with Steve to help her locate Greta, but Steve protests that the job is too dangerous. He is won over, however, by Lili's clever idea to force Stalin into action by announcing over the radio that he is alive. As they have hoped, Stalin hears the broadcast and orders his henchman, Igor Smetka, to kill Steve.\nMischa then brings Steve and Lili to Abensburg, West Germany, where Stalin's son Jacob has been living in secret since the Allies captured him during World War II. On the train, Steve and Mischa note the suspicious presence of a nun wearing combat boots, and once in Abensburg, Mischa follows the nun into a church. At the same time, Steve and Lili visit Jacob, who hates his father and, after conceding that he may be alive, warns them that they are in grave danger.\nThat night, Mischa and Steve vie for Lili's attention, and although Steve eventually wins a kiss, he then insults her, prompting her to slap him. From Lili's hotel room window, Steve spots the nun approaching and races downstairs, where he finds that Mischa has been knocked out. Steve overpowers the nun and removes the disguise, revealing his old cohort, Russian Tata Brun. Tata explains that he has been ordered to kill Steve in return for permission to see his exiled family, and the two agree to part without violence.\nIn the next few days, Mischa, Steve and Lili study old films of Stalin to become familiar with his mannerisms. Before one screening, Steve spots Igor and, suspecting impending danger, orders Lili to return to the hotel. Although Steve and Mischa wait in the screening room for an attack, none comes. Soon after, Tata arrives with a cab driver who announces that Lili has been abducted by Igor. Steve notifies the police and agrees to act as bait to attract Stalin's men. Surrounded by undercover agents, Steve and Mischa walk the streets near the screening room, and as planned, they are attacked. With Tata's help, they capture one of the assailants, whom Tata recognizes as one of the Communist agents who tortured him. Tata now returns the favor, torturing the man into confessing that Stalin is in the Greek mountains.\nAfter the agent dies from his injuries, Steve and Mischa travel to the mountains, and there learn from bistro owner Count Molda that a nearby monastery was taken over years earlier by a mysterious group. Curious, Steve and Mischa sneak into the monastery at night, but are immediately captured by the waiting Molda, who introduces them to three other men and their women companions.

A lawyer, who is also a municipal councilor acting as mayor, has the defect of considering himself a skilled speaker, and from this the commendatore tries to profit by offering him to give the inauguration speech of the villa in the presence of many authorities and television. However, he sets a condition: the lawyer will get the job, if he declares in public that he wants to prevent the disfigurement of the landscape. The deputy mayor is willing to accept, also because in the meantime his democratic ideas have suffered a severe blow with the escape from the house of his son, who got engaged to the daughter of the municipal sweeper. This engagement was initially forbidden by the girl's father himself, with rude ways that also included repeated slaps to his own daughter. When the same garbage man, through misunderstandings, comes to talk with the mayor about the engagement between the two young people, the mayor, Vittorio de Sica, indisputably prohibits this possibility, first making a picture of the time necessary for the boys to grow, arriving at the Landing on the Moon, which foresees for 1970, then with the threat of immediate dismissal of the garbage man himself. Meanwhile, the old people, tired of waiting, begin the construction of the kindergarten. At this point the lawyer makes a solemn promise in front of the cameras, and then gives the son permission to marry.

Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate.\nIn Libreville, equatorial Africa, the territorial agent makes plans for them to travel to meet Dr. Lorentz. Once the safari is ready, Mahri, an Arab, leads Brady and Morgan on the four-hundred mile trek to Lorentz's hospital. The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell. Later, Arobi arrives with the news that Lorentz has been killed by a monster living in the cauldron of a volcano and gives Brady a giant stinger that he removed from the doctor's shoulder. After Brady analyzes the stinger, he confirms that it belongs to a giant, deadly wasp. Although Brady advises Lorna to stay at the hospital, she insists on accompanying him, Morgan, Mahri and Arobi to Green Hell.\nWhen the native bearers learn of the destination, they desert, and although Lorna is able to shame several local villagers into helping, they, too, run off when the group comes upon a deserted native village littered with dead bodies. After Brady expresses his concern that the insects may be multiplying rapidly and could eventually overrun all of Africa, he states that they must destroy the queen and her immediate colony. Brady then explains to Mahri that he has brought small grenade-like bombs, filled with a special explosive, to use against the monsters. As they move closer to the base of the volcano, which shows signs of an imminent eruption, they hear a very loud, buzzing sound.\nWhen Brady looks down from a ridge above the volcano, he finds the queen wasp and several gigantic workers. The four men toss grenades into the bowl, but the explosions only serve to anger the wasps. Lorna and the men are pursued by one of the wasps, the size of a large building, but hide in a cave that it cannot enter. The group escapes through another entrance and, just as they emerge, the volcano erupts, spewing massive lava flows that destroy all the wasps in the conflagration. Morgan then notes that nature has a way of destroying its mistakes.", "tmdb_id": 52455}, "9595500": {"title": "The Monster That Challenged the World", "plot": "In the Salton Sea, an underwater earthquake causes a crevice to open, releasing prehistoric giant mollusks.

Then, a  mysterious forest fire flares up, burning more rapidly than normal and emanating from the ground, and Shiraishi rushes out to investigate and disappears during the confusion.\nThe next day, Atsumi is at the local observatory, where he meets with his mentor, head astronomer, Tanjiro Adachi. He hands the doctor a report written by Shiraishi that concerns a newly discovered asteroid that Shiraishi theorized was once a planet between Mars and Jupiter. He has named it Mysteroid. However, Adachi does not believe in his radical theory and also points out that the report is not complete.\nMeanwhile, the village in which the festival was held is completely wiped out by a massive earthquake. While investigating the area, Atsumi and a group of police officers stumble upon a giant robot, Moguera, which bursts from the side of a hill. It emits rays which decimate the investigation team; only Atsumi and the lead policeman survive. The robot then advances to a town near Koyama Bridge that night, and is met by heavy resistance from Japan's self-defense force. However, the conventional artillery has no effect on the war machine, and the automaton continues its rampage until it tries to cross the Koyama Bridge, which is detonated, sending the machine crashing down to the ground below and destroying it.\nAt the National Diet Building, Atsumi briefs officials on what has been learned about the robot. The remains of the giant machine reveal that it was manufactured out of an unknown chemical compound. Shortly afterwards, astronomers witness activity in outer space around the moon. They alert the world to this discovery, and not long after, the aliens emerge, their gigantic dome breaking through Earth's crust near Mount Fuji.\nAs a combined military and scientific entourage observes the dome, a voice calls out to request five scientists, including Dr. Adachi, who is among the observers, to come to the dome for a conference. The men agree to this meeting and are formally ushered into the dome, where the Mysterians, a scientifically advanced humanoid alien race, list their demands from the people of Earth: a two-mile-radius strip of land and the right to marry women of Earth. The reason for this is that 100,000 years ago their planet\u2014Mysteroid, once the fifth planet from the sun\u2014was destroyed by a nuclear war. Some Mysterians were able to escape to Mars before their planet was rendered unhabitable. However, owing to the nuclear war, strontium-90 has left 80 percent of the aliens' population deformed and crippled. The proposed interbreeding with women on Earth would produce healthier offspring and keep their race alive. The latter part of their demands is downplayed, as they admit to already taking three women captive and reveal two others that they are interested in, one of which is Etsuko.\nJapan quickly dismisses this request and begins the mobilization of its armed forces around Mount Fuji. It is also discovered that the missing Shiraishi has sided with the advance race because of their technological achievements. Japan wastes no time, though, and quickly launches a full-scale attack against the Mysterians' dome. However, the modern weaponry is no match for their technology, and Japan's forces are easily fought back. Distraught by this setback, Japan sends their plea to other nations that they join to remove the threat of the Mysterians from Earth. The nations around the world answer the plea and in no time issue another raid against the Mysterians' dome, this time utilizing the newly developed Alpha and Beta class airships. Sadly, this attack meets failure as well.\nThe Mysterians then increase their demand, asking for a 75-mile-radius plot of land, as the Earth continues to develop a new method of attack. Earth's efforts in this matter pay off as a Markalite FAHP (Flying Atomic Heat Projector), a gigantic lens that can reflect the Mysterians\u2019 weaponry, is designed. Meanwhile, the Mysterians kidnap Etsuko and Hiroko, causing Atsumi to search for, and locate, a cave entrance to a tunnel under the Mysterians' dome.\nIn the meantime, the Markalite FAHP's are deployed by large Markalite GYRO rockets, and the final battle against the Mysterians' base of operations commences. Atsumi enters the dome and finds the women, alive and unharmed, in an unguarded room. Taking them back to the tunnel, Atsumi finds Shiraishi, who admits the Mysterians duped him and have no good intentions, and then returns to the dome and sacrifices himself in a final attack on the base from the inside while the Markalite FAHP's assault the base from above ground. In the midst of the battle, a second Moguera is deployed from the dome, but is disabled after it attempts to emerge from the ground underneath one of the FAHPs, which falls on top of it. The dome collapses and then explodes as Adachi and the women reach safety in the hills above the Mysterians' occupied land.

The next day, unknown to Ruth, Nate ingratiates himself with Jeff by showing him how to shoot his Colt 44. Later, Ruth reluctantly agrees that Nate can stay a few more days. Soon, Jeff is calling Nate \"Paw,\" but runs into trouble at school when another boy, Ben Jorgenson, says that Jeff's father is a murderer. Jeff tells Ben to get his father's gun and meet him later. Instead, Ben brings his father, who beats Jeff, who is wearing Nate's gun. Nate, Elec and Ruth arrive soon after and, after Nate slugs Jorgenson, Ruth blames Nate for involving Jeff with guns and swears she will kill him if he returns again. Later, when Ruth comes to town to obtain some medicine for Jeff, Nate tells her that he is leaving and intends to take Jeff with him. Soon after, two former associates of Nate, Bill Somerson and Ed Wyatt, rob the Plainsville bank and kill the manager. Ruth, the sole witness to the robbery, lies to Elec that Nate was the perpetrator in order to prevent him from taking Jeff. Nate is arrested and when Jeff visits him in jail, Nate, believing now that his son is better off without him, lets Jeff believe that he is guilty. Outwitting a deputy, Nate escapes from jail and rides away. Ten years pass and Jeff is still living with Ruth and is now working as a security agent for the stagecoach line, but is embittered by the town's ostracism of him. Jeff is courting two young women, the prim Amy Wentworth and the more adventurous Lila Costain, who runs a ranch she inherited from her father. When Jeff assists Elec and a posse in foiling a stagecoach robbery, they shoot three of the robbers, including Ed Wyatt. As he dies, Wyatt recognizes Jeff as Nate's son and tells him and Elec that he and Somerson committed the bank robbery, not Nate. After Jeff confronts Ruth, she admits that she lied to prevent Nate from taking him away because she wanted Jeff to grow up to be happy and decent. Jeff then leaves Ruth's house and decides to find Nate. Although Lila tries to dissuade Jeff and asks him to stay with her, he is obsessed with joining his father, who has continued his criminal career, in exacting revenge against the townspeople. Somerson contacts Jeff with a proposal that they and two others set up a payroll robbery based upon Jeff's knowledge of the stage line's operations. Later, Nate visits Ruth and reveals that he never told Jeff that she had lied because he wanted the boy to stay with her. While Nate is at the house, Jeff enters with Lila and Nate informs him that he has heard about the intended robbery and forbids him to participate. In the ensuing fistfight, Jeff beats up Nate and rides off. Nate then begs Elec to help him prevent the robbery. When Nate and Elec thwart the holdup, Somerson and another gunman take Jeff hostage, blaming him for Nate and Elec's intervention, and flee on the stage. Nate rides after them and, as Jeff and Somerson struggle inside the coach for possession of a gun, Nate shoots the outlaw driver. Nate then jumps on board, taking over the reins of the runaway stage, but is attacked by Somerson who has knocked out Jeff. Somerson overpowers Nate and brings the stage to a halt, intending to shoot Elec and the others who are following. Nate prevents Somerson from shooting by hurling a knife into his body, but is in turn mortally wounded by the outlaw. Later, as Nate dies in Ruth's house, Jeff tells him that he intends to change his ways and Ruth agrees to help Jeff once more. Lila then comforts Jeff for the loss of his father.", "tmdb_id": 189254}, "31209195": {"title": "Padatha Painkili", "plot": "Vendor Kutty, a wealthy villager, is jealous and scheming to marry his daughter Lucy to the richest bachelor of the town.

Mireau initially refuses, citing the impossibility of success, but when Broulard mentions a potential promotion, Mireau quickly convinces himself the attack will succeed.\nMireau proceeds to walk through the trenches, asking several soldiers, \"Ready to kill more Germans?\" He throws a private out of the regiment for showing signs of shell shock. Mireau leaves the detailed planning of the attack to Colonel Dax of the 701st regiment, despite Dax's protests that the only result of the attack will be to weaken the French Army with heavy losses for no benefit.\nPrior to the attack, a drunken lieutenant named Roget, leading a night-time scouting mission, sends one of his two men ahead. Overcome by fear while waiting for the man's return, Roget lobs a grenade and retreats. Corporal Paris, the other soldier on the mission, finds the body of the scout, who has been killed by the grenade, and confronts Roget. Roget denies any wrongdoing and falsifies his report to Colonel Dax.\nThe next morning, the attack on the Anthill is a failure.

None of the men reach the German trenches, and B Company refuses to leave their own trench after seeing the first wave sustain heavy casualties. Mireau, enraged, orders his artillery to open fire on them to force them onto the battlefield. The artillery commander refuses to fire without written confirmation of the order. Meanwhile, Dax returns to the trenches and tries to rally B Company to join the battle, but as he climbs out of the trench, the body of a dead French soldier knocks him down.\nAt a meeting with Broulard and Dax, to deflect blame for the attack's failure, Mireau decides to court-martial 100 of the soldiers for cowardice. Broulard wants Mireau to reduce the number and counters with a dozen soldiers; Mireau scoffs at the low number and Broulard angrily tells him to make a decision and be done with it, so Mireau arrives at three, one from each company.

The trial, however, is a farce. There is no formal written indictment, a court stenographer is not present, and the court refuses to admit evidence that would support acquittal. In his closing statement, Dax denounces the proceedings: \"Gentlemen of the court, to find these men guilty would be a crime to haunt each of you till the day you die.\" Nonetheless, the three are sentenced to death.\nThe night before the execution, Dax confronts Broulard at a ball, with sworn statements by witnesses attesting to Mireau's order to shell his own trenches, in an attempt to blackmail the General Staff into sparing the three men.

The narrator opens with the words, \"After the day's work and worries are done, what is more fun for a man than to come home to a quiet house with happy children and a loving spouse?\" At that point, two noisy children, a boy and a girl, run into the bedroom where their father is in bed reading a thick book entitled \"Relax Relax Relax!\". Their mother, the \"relaxed wife\" of the title, tell them to be quiet. As they leave the girl says \"goodnight mother, goodnight father\", while the father scowls. The narrator, who recites most of his text in rhyming couplets, then states, \"some attempts at relaxing prove quite taxing \u2014 no joking \u2014 the effort may be most provoking\".\nThe wife offers the husband hot tea, but he gulps it instead of sipping it and has to run to the bathroom to spit it out. The wife takes the book away from him and looks for another title among the following books on the bedroom shelf, \"Living with Tension\", \"Living Without Tension\", \"Relax 24 Hours a Day\", \"Relax 365 Days a Year\" and the last one, \"How to Relax\" which she hands to him and goes to lie down on one of the bedroom's two beds, separated by a nightstand, on which she keeps her reading glasses and her own book, titled \"Wife Killer\" and, as the shocked husband glares at the cover, he sees the illustration of a man's hand holding a bloody knife over a woman's body.\nAs the narrator's soothing voice is heard reading from How to Relax, the audience sees stylized depictions of the husband's stress-filled life as he runs weaving in and out of gates similar to those used by Olympic skiers, arrives at his desk, which is piled high with papers, and starts answering a ringing phone, with a speeded-up voice at the other end continually badgering him. The signs placed around him state \"THINK\", \"SMILE\", \"WORK\" and \"PLAN AHEAD\", while the narrator explains, \"although the feverish male is sure nobody else can have his troubles, we know his wife doesn't pass her days just blowing bubbles\". The wife is then shown negotiating those same stylized gates, carrying a large basket filled with laundry, while the two noisy and boisterous children run and shout.\nReturning to the husband reading How to Relax, the narrator compares tension to a mosquito that continually buzzes, but never alights so that it can be swatted. The husband contorts his face, waiting to complete the swat, as the narrator asks if the wait would make him \"worried, anxious, fearful, tense, irritated, exhausted\", which is what tension does to him. As he dozes off to the narrator's soporific voice, his wife lifts the book from his lap and he jolts awake. She then reads to him, \"true relaxation comes from conquering both nervous and physical tensions by calming both mind and muscles\u2026\" He imagines himself back at his work desk with his head having a pressure cooker valve sticking out of it and boiling over at top with the three-level lettering \u2014 \"world's worries / other folk's problems / my affairs\". A competing pressure valve then appears on top of his head with three different levels \u2014 \"perfect / my very best / good work\".\nThe wife is shown at the ironing board next to an overflowing wicker laundry basket of clothes, needing to be ironed. She relaxes by shaking her hands to relieve tension, then rolling her shoulders and neck muscles. As she continues, the husband gets up and begins shadow boxing, but receives a knockout blow from an invisible opponent and stretches out on the carpeted bedroom floor, while the wife continues to read the book's helpful advice regarding muscle relaxation.\nAt that point, the narrator again takes over, explaining, \"as for everything else, the Greeks had a word for this mental and physical state of bliss \u2014 Ataraxia was the term they chose to use for the opposite of anxiety, fatigue and blues. Ataraxia means peace of mind and that \u2014 even more than money \u2014 is what most of us want to find\". Laboratory beakers are shown while the narrator tells us that \"today, medical science recognizes that some folks aren't helped by relaxing exercises. In cases of difficult tension and nervous apprehension, doctors are now prescribing an Ataraxic medicine. It makes those who fear they're about to quit, feel like they're ready to begin \u2014 bidding their darkened spirits goodbye \u2014 with the calming peace of a cloudless sky. Of all the states throughout this nation, the happiest by far is the state of relaxation\u2026\"\nThe husband dreams that he is again at his desk, but is now able to neutralize newspaper banner headlines of bad news, with other banner headlines proclaiming counterbalancing good news. Also, when he stops chasing elusive dollar bills attached to fishhooks, the money-laden fishhooks come within easy reach. Now that he is relaxed, good healthy sleep will no longer be elusive. The wife finishes reading, becomes drowsy, kisses her sleeping husband and lays down in her own separate bed.

In the dream he tells Joan that her case was retried and her sentence annulled. He recalls how she entered his life as a simple, seventeen-year-old peasant girl; how she heard the voices of Saints Catherine and Margaret telling her that she would lead the French army against the English at the siege of Orl\u00e9ans and be responsible for having the Dauphin crowned king at Reims cathedral. When Joan arrives at the Dauphin's palace at Chinon she discovers that he is a childish weakling with no interest in fighting. After being tested by the members of the court, who conclude that she is mad, Joan imbues the Dauphin with her belief and fervor and he gives her command of the army.\nShortly thereafter, Joan witnesses the coronation of Charles. Although her military triumphs have made her popular with the masses, her voices, beliefs, self-confidence and apparent supernatural powers have given her fearful enemies in high places.

When Joan challenges Charles to retake Paris from the English, he tells her he would rather sign a treaty than fight. All refuse Joan's plea to march on Paris, and the archbishop warns her that if she defies her spiritual directors, the church will disown her. Nevertheless, Joan puts her faith in God and appeals to the common people to march on Paris. She is captured and handed over to the English. To assure that Joan will never again become a threat to England, the English commander hands her over to the Catholic Church to be tried for heresy. Joan spends four months in a cell and is visited frequently by the Inquisitor (Felix Aylmer). The English become impatient with the delay in her prosecution and press for the trial to begin. Joan holds to her faith, as always, refusing to deny that the church is wiser than she or her voices.\nIn a moment of panic when she learns she is to be burned at the stake, and worn down by the constant pressures applied by the Inquisitor, Joan signs a document of recantation in which she confesses that she pretended to hear revelations from God and the saints in the belief that this will result in her freedom to return to her life as a peasant girl. When she learns that the sentence of the Inquisition is her perpetual, solitary imprisonment, Joan destroys the document, refusing to face a life away from nature, the life that opened her spirit to hear God and the saints. She now believes that God wants her to come to him through the ordeal of being burned at the stake. After Joan is excommunicated, the English commander, weary of the Church's endless and delaying rituals, decides that Joan can be executed long before the Vatican learns about it, and so orders his soldiers to drag her to the square to be burned. The Inquisitor chooses to look the other way and let the English burn her. Those who witness Joan's death are stricken with remorse.

Upon revealing to him the chess tactic that will save his life, the knight discovers that it is actually Death with whom he has been speaking.

Both in their early twenties, Henry's son Peter and black worker Kimani are close friends, having been raised together as brothers since the death of Henry's wife. One day, when Kimani asks to use a rifle during a lion hunt, Peter's brother-in-law, Jeff Newton, slaps the black man and reminds him that he cannot have the gun nor can he continue his friendship with Peter. A humiliated Kimani disappears from the camp, but, after being injured when his foot is caught in a trap, is rescued by Peter, who carries him home on his back. Kimani suggests that they must assume the roles of master and serf, but Peter refuses to change their relationship. Back at the black settlement, Kimani's father Karanja orders the murder of one of the tribe's newborns, which was born feet first, a condition the tribe believes to be a curse. After Karanja is arrested and sentenced to jail, Henry argues with the Crown consul that if the whites continue to take away the tribal elders' authority, the tribe children will begin to disrespect their own way of life and, he warns, disrespect the colonial Christian God. When Henry, Peter and Kimani visit the elderly man in jail, Karanja gives Henry his sacred stone. Karanja then encourages Kimani to assume his position as headman at the farm, but Kimani refuses to spend his life working as a white man's slave. One night, moved by moral outrage at the injustices against his father, Kimani attends a secret meeting of the Mau Mau, a group of black men planning an insurrection. He is asked by leader Njogu to prove his fidelity by stealing rifles. After one of the Mau Mau kills a black houseboy during the robbery, Kimani, troubled by their methods of achieving freedom, threatens to leave. Njogu tells Kimani he must remain with them because the police will now connect him to the crime.\nYears later, in 1952, Peter, who now leads safaris to supplement the farm's dwindling income, welcomes Holly Keith, his betrothed, home after her years of studying abroad. As Kenya becomes increasingly tension-filled, Henry and other white settlers question the workers' wives about the sudden disappearance of many of their mates, but the frightened women do not respond. Meanwhile, Kimani submits to a Mau Mau oath in which he receives seven gashes to the arm, drinks sheep's blood and swears to drive the Europeans from Kenya no matter what the cost. When Kimani comments that Njogu has not taken the oath himself, the leader claims he is too old to change his faith in his gods who forbid him to perform many of the oath's tenets. Kimani then asks permission from Njogu to marry his daughter Wanjiru, who is carrying Kimani's child. The leader refuses to perform the Christian ceremony. Later, while Peter and Holly are celebrating their wedding night camping on the safari, the Mau Mau pillage the McKenzie farmhouse and murder Jeff and his two children. Kimani, torn between respect for the McKenzies and allegiance to Mau Mau, cannot follow through with killing Jeff's wife Elizabeth, and leaves her wounded. After a state of emergency is declared by the ruling British, Peter and neighbor Joe Matson track down a Mau Mau camp and bomb it with a grenade. The Mau Mau surrender and are forced into an internment camp where they are tortured for information. Peter subsequently returns home exhausted and unable to express his feelings to Holly because of moral torment he suffers from the events. Holly begs him to leave the country, but Peter will not leave his land. When Henry and Peter return to the camp, they find Joe cruelly torturing Njogu for information. Henry, knowing that killing Njogu will only make him a martyr, produces Naranja's sacred stone and asks Njogu if his gods would ask him to make the Mau Mau kill innocent children. Njogu, fearing that the wrath of his god symbolized in a violent thunderstorm passing above, admits that if his gods cannot accept Mau Mau, then the Mau Mau cannot lead his people. He then names Kimani, now a Mau Mau general, as the leader of the attack on the McKenzie home. As ruling British capture many Mau Mau followers, Peter and black worker Lathela search for Kimani. One night at the McKenzie home, Holly is forced to bravely fight when the Mau Mau attack again. Henry then sends Holly and Elizabeth, who is pregnant with Jeff's child, to Nairobi for protection.\nMeanwhile, Peter and Lathela find Kimani and his followers in the jungle. Speaking to Kimani alone, Peter asks him to surrender. Kimani, who has never abandoned his doubts about the Mau Mau methods, agrees to meet at a hidden spring to discuss the terms of an agreement. Kimani then explains to his followers that they must negotiate with the whites, telling them \"it is your own hatred that you see in others.\" In Nairobi, Peter joins Holly at the hospital where Elizabeth's child is born. When he suggests to Holly that they leave the country for a while, she tells him she loves Africa and wants to return home. Later, Peter discovers that Joe has already left for the spring with many armed men. He races to the spring to prevent any conflict, but when Kimani and the remaining Mau Mau arrive, Joe and his men shoot at the men, women and children. Kimani escapes with his infant son into the jungle, where Peter finds him in a cave and explains that they were both betrayed. When his old friend flees with a rifle, Peter pushes Kimani, causing the gun to slip from his hand. Setting the child down, Kimani threatens Peter with a large knife, but Peter grabs it and, holding to Kimani's throat, begs him to surrender to enable them both to start over again. Kimani insists he must kill Peter and, while grabbing for a gun, slides into a Mau Mau pit trap, where bamboo spikes pierce him.

His friend Frank Mahoney guards his hotel-room door from reporters. Unable to sleep, Lindbergh reminisces about his time as an airmail pilot.\nIn a flashback sequence, Lindbergh lands his old de Havilland biplane at a small airfield to refuel on the way to Chicago. Despite bad weather, he takes off, unaware that heavy snow has closed the Chicago landing field. Lindbergh is forced to bail out in a storm after running out of fuel. Recovering mail from his crashed DH-4, he continues to Chicago by train. A suspender salesman tells him that two airmen just died competing for the Orteig Prize for the first nonstop flight from New York City to Paris. Lindbergh calls Columbia Aircraft Corporation in New York from a small diner at the Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field. Quoted a price of $15,000 ($230,000 today) for a Bellanca high-wing monoplane, Lindbergh lobbies St. Louis financiers with a plan to fly the Atlantic in 40 hours in a stripped-down, single-engine aircraft. The backers are excited by Lindbergh's vision and dub the venture Spirit of St. Louis.\nWhen the Bellanca deal falls apart because Columbia insists on selecting the pilot, Lindbergh approaches Ryan Airlines, a small manufacturer in San Diego, California. Frank Mahoney, the company's owner and president, promises to build a suitable monoplane in just 90 days. With Ryan's chief engineer Donald Hall, a design takes shape. To decrease weight, Lindbergh refuses to install a radio or other heavy equipment, even a parachute, and plans to navigate by \"dead reckoning\". With no autopilot function available, Lindbergh will not be able to sleep during the flight. With the deadline pressing, Ryan workers agree to work around the clock, completing the monoplane in just 62 days.\nLindbergh flies The Spirit of St. Louis to New York, stopping at Lambert Field (St. Louis Lambert International Airport) on the way to show the aircraft to his investors. He prepares for the flight at Roosevelt Field, ensuring that 450 gallons of fuel is on board for the long flight. In the cramped cockpit, which does not allow direct forward view, the magnetic compass must fit above his head; a young woman offers her compact mirror, which is attached with chewing gum so that Lindbergh can read the compass. Mahoney secretly slips a Saint Christopher medal into a bag of sandwiches on board.\nAs the weather clears, The Spirit of St. Louis trundles down the muddy runway and barely clears electric lines and treetops. An American newspaper's headline reads: \"Lindy Is Off!\" Every hour, Lindbergh switches fuel tanks to keep the airplane's weight balanced. As he flies over Cape Cod, Lindbergh realizes that he has not slept in 28 hours. He recalls past times when he had slept on railroad tracks, short bunk beds, and under a windmill. When he begins to doze, he is awakened by a fly. Over Nova Scotia, he sees a motorcyclist below, remembering his own Harley-Davidson motorcycle that he had once traded as partial payment for his first aircraft, a World War I war-surplus Curtiss Jenny.\nOver the seemingly endless Atlantic, Lindbergh remembers barnstorming across the Midwest in a flying circus. After 18 hours, ice forms on the wings and engine, and the aircraft begins losing altitude. Lindbergh changes course and the ice breaks off in the warmer air; the engine, which had stopped, is restarted. Back on course, his compasses begin malfunctioning, forcing him to navigate by the stars. By dawn, he falls asleep, and the monoplane slowly descends in a wide spiral toward the ocean. Sunlight reflecting off the compact's mirror finally awakens him in time to regain flight control.\nSeeing a seagull, Lindbergh realizes that he is close to land. He tries without success to hail a fisherman below. Sighting land, he determines that he has reached Dingle Bay, Ireland. Pulling out a sandwich from a paper bag, Lindbergh discovers the hidden Saint Christopher medal and hangs it on the instrument panel. Crossing the English Channel and the coast of France, Lindbergh follows the Seine up to Paris as darkness falls.\nFinally seeing the city lights ahead of him, Lindbergh approaches Le Bourget Airfield in the dark, becoming disoriented by panning spotlights aimed into the sky. He glimpses strange movements and lights below, in reality huge crowds of people and traffic in and around Le Bourget. Confused by this chaos, Lindbergh begins his landing approach, quickly becoming panicked. As he goes lower, he whispers \"Oh, God, help me!\"\nLanding safely and bringing The Spirit of St. Louis to a full stop, Lindbergh is rushed by hordes of people while sitting in the plane. As flash powder ignites and photos are taken, Lindbergh is carried triumphantly on people's shoulders toward a hangar.

Popeye suddenly spies an old sailing ship on the horizon, which also thrills Olive who cannot wait to go home and watch television again. Popeye then twirls his pipe around and, using it like an outboard motor, propels the raft towards the ship. The raft hits the ship and breaks apart, catapulting Popeye and Olive aboard. The camera then pulls over to the ship's figurehead, which also reveals the ship is called \"Sea Witch,\" which has been adrift at sea since 1678.\nUnbeknownst to the couple, as they search the ship for the crew, the ship does have a crew, but of ghosts with English accents (voiced by Mercer, Jackson Beck, Sid Raymond and Gilbert Mack).  Upon hearing voices outside their quarters, the ghosts wake up and spot the boarders. Despite concluding that the ship is deserted, Popeye determines that the ship is still seaworthy enough to return to land. Having heard this, the ghosts become alarmed, as they like the peace and quiet of being adrift at sea. The captain of the ghost crew agrees that they must get rid of the boarders in order to keep their peaceful life at sea intact.\nSoon afterwards, as Popeye starts to sail the ship in the direction towards land, two ghosts appear behind Olive (resting in the anchor rope) and toss the anchor overboard (to stop the ship in place), which unravels the rope and sends Olive flying and spinning. Olive then flies towards Popeye and, with her spinning legs, knocks him through the ship's wheel, much to the amusement of the ghosts. Olive manages to pull the wheel off Popeye, but gets stuck in the wheel herself, generating more laughter from the ghosts.\nLater, while Olive repairs the wheel, Popeye starts pulling up the anchor, which gets the ship moving again, but one ghost paints grease on the last few yards of the rope and another ghost tangles some of the anchor rope around Popeye's leg. As soon as the anchor is almost aboard, the greased part of the rope slips through Popeye's hands and the anchor stops the ship again and pulls Popeye overboard into the water. While Popeye struggles underwater trying to free himself from the rope, Olive tries to pull the anchor back up, but isn't strong enough. The ghosts (now invisible) blindfold Olive and force her to the plank. Back underwater, Popeye manages to grab a swordfish and use its snout to cut the rope, allowing him to swim back to the surface and back on to the ship, which has now started moving again.\nAt this point, the ghosts (still invisible and holding a sword) force Olive to walk the length of the plank while Olive cries out for Popeye. The sword disappears just as Popeye sees Olive almost about to walk off the edge of the plank. He picks it up and redirects it so that Olive ends up landing face first into a bucket of water. Olive cries out that she's drowning, but Popeye reassures her she's all right and goes to steer the ship. Just as soon as Olive spits out some water, she suddenly feels herself being carried along the deck. The moment Olive begins to state her suspicions about the ship, two ghosts (carrying her) appear, holding her by her arms.\nOlive then freaks out and manages to escape the ghosts' grip, running past Popeye while screaming \"Ghosts!,\" and immediately dives overboard, but Popeye catches her just in time and pulls her back aboard. Popeye tries to assure her that ghosts aren't real, but a ghost cuts loose a sail above them and the sail falls onto Popeye. Seeing Popeye covered by the sail, Olive shrieks (thinking Popeye is a ghost), grabs a quartermaster's baton, and starts clubbing Popeye with it, but Popeye's shouts make her realize her mistake.\nSeeing that all their haunting isn't working, the ghosts run towards Popeye and Olive while wielding swords and shouting out what they intend to do with them. Olive flees to another part of the ship while Popeye runs into the ship's galley. While inside, he sees a jar of \"ye king's spinach\" and runs back out to face the attacking ghosts. Popeye immediately consumes the spinach and becomes invisible. Popeye then appears in ghost form and punches all the ghosts so hard that they become solid. The now solid ghosts then crash into a wall, which allows Olive to sew them together into a new sail.\nWith the ship now ghost free, Popeye and Olive sail off into the sunset back for civilization and sing Popeye's song as the short ends - and the cartoon series with it."}, "14204820": {"title": "Steal Wool", "plot": "Like all Ralph Wolf and Sam Sheepdog shorts, this one revolves around Ralph Wolf trying to steal the sheep which Sam Sheepdog is guarding.

Ralph's first plan is to sneak under a sheep and carry it off, wearing it as a disguise. When Ralph is caught by Sam, he attempts to push the sheep away and act innocent, but Sam punches him in the nose, turning his nose into an accordion.\n2. As in all three earlier episodes, Ralph devises a plan that involves tunneling under the field and digging very small holes through the surface. This time, he creates the hole a safe distance away and surveys the area with a periscope. After spotting a sheep, he attempts to capture it with a lasso, but accidentally snags Sam, who punches him in the head. This time, Ralph walks away with his entire body turned into an accordion.\n3. Ralph's third plan is to build a simple suspension bridge out of firecrackers and lure Sam to the other side. When Sam passes, Ralph grabs a sheep, lights the firecrackers, and runs across the bridge, ensuring that Sam has no way to return. However, Sam uses his uncanny ability to appear at the other end of the bridge, where he prompts Ralph to hand over the sheep. Ralph begins running toward the burning end of the bridge (which is now floating in midair, against the law of gravity, but not the laws of cartoon physics) and extinguishes the firecracker. However, Sam has lit the other end of the bridge, and Ralph's bridge disappears beneath him.\n4. Ralph then attempts to place a makeshift teeter totter under Sam and jump on the other end from a great height. However, because of Sam's weight, the board merely acts as a springboard, tossing Ralph into Sam's arms. Sam places Ralph on one end of the teeter totter and slams the other end down as hard as he can, sending Ralph flying through the air.\n5. Next, Ralph wheels a giant lit cannon up a hill behind Sam. As Ralph runs away, giddy, the cannon begins to roll down after him. As Ralph notices this, he runs as fast as he can, until he reaches the edge of a cliff, which has a very small cliff immediately below it. Ralph climbs onto the cliff and turtles. The cannon stops on the edge of the cliff, but has enough momentum to flip the cannon over so that it is pointing straight down at Ralph. Ralph, curious to see if he is safe, stands up, only to discover that he is inside the cannon just before it is about to fire.\n6. In Ralph's final attempt, he sneaks up behind Sam and attaches each end of a very large elastic band to rocks on either side of Sam to create an over-sized slingshot. As Ralph pulls the band back, the rocks loosen and fire past him, anchoring themselves into opposing sides of a chasm, and slinging Ralph through the chasm. On the other side of the chasm, Ralph grabs hold of a tree and holds on for dear life, but the elasticity of the rubber band slings the two rocks into Ralph, sending Ralph, the two rocks, and a piece of the tree flying, while the rubber band is still wrapped around the rest of the tree. Ralph manages to free himself from the two rocks and the piece of tree, only to run into a cliff face and be crushed by the items.  As Ralph crawls out from under the wreck, the rest of the tree slings into Ralph.\nFinally, the time clock whistle blows and Ralph and Sam walk home. Ralph has two black eyes, an arm in a sling, and is stumbling around from the damage that he sustained from the items that hit him. Sam reassuringly suggests that Ralph has been working too hard, that he take the next day off and that Sam can handle both jobs. \"Gee, th-thanks, Sam\", Ralph says, staggering back into his house. \"You're a....pal.\"", "tmdb_id": 100355}, "21581927": {"title": "The Steel Bayonet", "plot": "Tunisia 1943\nAs the North African Campaign draws to a close, and the German and Italian forces are being pushed back on Tunis, a company of British Infantry are tasked with holding a small Arab farm against an expected last-ditch counter-attack; the farm's water tower will be used as an observation point by a few Royal Artillery spotters.

Falco is losing money and clients, and knows this crucial back-scratch could save his career. Sidney hopes to plant a rumor in a rival column that Dallas is a marijuana-smoking Communist, enough to get him fired from the jazz club where his combo plays.

Instead, the columnist chooses exposure over his journalistic integrity - which even his wife praises as his first decent act in years. Falco then bribes a second columnist with a sexual favor to be provided by a cigarette girl he has a friendly relationship with, misleading her into waiting for him in his bedroom only to arrive with the columnist - a new low, even for Falco.

Alec passionately kisses Honor, adding a new dimension. The conversation also alludes to Alec's relationship with Jenny. Honor leaves to allow father and son a final embrace, and more confessions are made.\nGraham visits a pub with Stanford and gathers some more clues before getting very drunk.\nGoing to a theatre, he finds Stanford's alibi of spending the night with an actress was not actually true.

Conway receives his test subjects through an associate, Dr. Loren Wright (Roy Gordon), who delivers patients seeking treatment for lesser conditions. After this, they are then taken into the operating room for Conway's illicit surgery.\nWright delivers his newest find, Grace Thomas (Allison Hayes), who is seeking treatment for depression. When Conway balks at Wright for bringing him a patient with living relatives, he confides in Conway that he plans to throw Grace's purse and bags into the bay, to fool family and the authorities into believing she had committed suicide. He then asks Conway for a demonstration of his experimental progress; Conway takes him down into the basement, where he introduces him to Harry Jedrow (Harry Fleer), his latest victim. Jedrow is clearly alive, but severely disfigured and in a vegetative state; this concerns Wright, who reveals that Jedrow's sister is currently seeking him out. Conway is furious, since none of his patients were supposed to have ties of any kind.\nThat night, Lobo (who famously delivers the line \"Time for go to bed!\") discovers Frank Scott (Myron Healey) roaming around the grounds. Scott attempts to conceal his identity, but Conway quickly deduces that he is an escaped convict from his description in the newspapers, as well as a telltale tattoo on his wrist. Rather than turn Scott into the police, he offers him the chance to take part in his experiments. Knowing the odds are stacked against him, Scott accepts his offer.\nScott is introduced to Grace the following morning, along with the two other patients: Danny Green (Arthur Batanides), who is being treated for anger issues, and pretty young Natalie Andries (Sally Todd), whose treatment schedule for a nervous breakdown is nearing completion. After demanding Wright to make out a certificate of death for Harry Jedrow, Conway happily informs Natalie that one last treatment for her is all that's necessary. While the other patients sleep, Natalie is sedated, taken to the operating room, and given an artificial gland along with a high dosage of electricity. The procedure backfires, and she ends up a senile old woman. They hide her in a back room.\nLobo is ordered to bury Jedrow alive, but Frank Scott sneaks out to the burial site and opens the coffin. Jedrow rises out of it and escapes, and Lobo - not having been alerted - buries the casket. Sharon confronts Conway about his apparent affinity for Grace, and requests that she be made the next patient to be experimented upon. Meanwhile, Scott begins attempting to reveal to the other patients that Dr. Conway is carrying out horrific deeds to their friends. After a failed attempt to reveal Natalie's fate, he manages to show Grace and Danny what had happened to her, only to get caught by Dr. Conway and Sharon. They detain Scott and Danny and prepare Grace for surgery.\nDanny helps Scott escape by distracting Lobo, who fatally shoots him before being knocked unconscious. Scott confronts Dr. Conway with Lobo's gun and reveals that he is not a convicted murderer; he is actually Lt. Mark Houston, an undercover police officer sent to the psychiatrist's business to investigate it. Dr. Conway evades arrest, but is murdered by Jedrow.

Their slaves live at quiet peace with them but are not above being punished for their disobedience. One night, as the full moon appears, the sound of drums rises in the air. Yambao (Nin\u00f3n Sevilla), the granddaughter of a witch supposedly murdered 15 years ago named Caridad (Fedora Capdevila), has reappeared. The plantation slaves are superstitious and fear her, believing she will place curses on them as her grandmother supposedly did. Yambao's arrival coincides with a new outbreak of black vomit that had not occurred on the plantation for decades, and is now attributed to her using black magic. Though Yambao isn't really evil, Caridad constantly pressures her to take revenge on the plantation.\nJorge, who normally stays out of the traditions and customs of his slaves, discovers that they want to sacrifice Yambao and intervenes. Yambao swears eternal gratitude for the gesture but also starts to fall for him. Caridad sees this as an opportunity and weaves it into her plan for revenge. Yambao decides to perform a magic ritual of Santeria over Jorge to make him love her. Her magic spell coincides with Jorge contracting the disease and falling ill. The only medical doctors in the area are themselves ill and cannot come to treat Jorge's critical condition. Yambao offers to cure him in gratitude for saving her life and is permitted to try despite some initial protest from his slaves. The prolonged contact with Jorge cements Yambao's feelings for him and is reciprocated when he recovers, which leads her to believe her love spell worked.\nFor several weeks Jorge is infatuated with Yambao, forgetting his wife, his plantation and shirking all his duties. However, when Jorge is informed that his wife is about to give birth, he rushes to her side and clears all thoughts of lust and infidelity from his mind. Yambao, heartbroken and jealous, is advised by Caridad to kill Beatriz and her child to get back at Jorge. Yambao takes a dagger and rushes towards the plantation, eventually cornering Beatriz and her child. But before she can complete her crime, Caridad is discovered by the foreman of the plantation and swiftly killed with a machete. Yambao shudders momentarily as Caridad's evil influence fades away and then comes to her senses. Realizing what she was about to do, she flees in horror and promises not to cause any more harm. Caridad's body is then subject to a funeral ceremony with exotic rituals which Jorge attends. As the ceremony nears its climax, Yambao is possessed by Caridad's spirit and rushes over to Jorge in an attempt to stab him. Yambao, however, cannot bring herself to do it and instead runs to the edge of a nearby stone gorge and hurls herself into it.

Suddenly, without warning, People's Liberation Army (PLA) shore batteries open fire and, after a heavy engagement, Amethyst lies grounded in the mud and badly damaged. HMS Consort attempts to tow Amethyst off the mud bank, but is herself hit several times and has to depart. A further rescue attempt by HMS London in consort with HMS Black Swan also comes under heavy fire and has to be aborted.\nFifty-four of Amethyst's crew are dead, dying or seriously wounded, while others deteriorate from the tropical heat and the lack of essential medicines, including the ship's captain, who dies of his wounds. An attempt to evacuate the wounded is only partially successful - the officers of the Amethyst become aware that two seamen have been captured by the PLA and are being held at a nearby military hospital. Lieutenant-Commander John Kerans (Richard Todd), assistant naval attach\u00e9 in nearby Nanking, is ordered to go to the beleaguered ship and take command.\nKerans decides to risk steaming down the Yangtze at night without a pilot or suitable charts. Before they can leave, however, the local PLA commissar Colonel Peng (Akim Tamiroff) makes contact with the Amethyst and at a meeting between senior officers makes his position clear: either the British government releases an apology accepting all responsibility for the entire incident, or the Amethyst will remain his prisoner. Similarly, he will not allow the two wounded sailors to leave unless they give him statements declaring the British to have been the transgressors, which they refuse to do. Kerans dismisses his demands but is able to manipulate Peng into the release of the seamen; meanwhile, as talks progress he has the ship patched up and its engines restored. After some subtle alterations to the ship's outline to try to disguise her, Amethyst slips her cable and heads downriver in the dark following a local merchant ship, which Amethyst uses to show the way through the shoals and distract the PLA. When the shore batteries finally notice the frigate escaping downriver, the merchantman receives the brunt of the PLA artillery and catches fire, while Amethyst presses on at top speed.\nEncountering an obstruction in the river in the form of several sunken ships, and having no proper equipment for charting a safe course, Kerans uses both intuition and luck to slip through before then reaching the guns and searchlights of Woosung. After she is inevitably spotted, the Amethyst is forced into a lengthy fight with the PLA batteries as she flees with all guns blazing, heading for the mouth of the river just beyond. As day dawns, she finally reaches the open ocean, where she greets HMS Concord with the message \"Never - repeat never - has another ship been more welcome\". She also sends a signal to headquarters: \"Have rejoined the fleet south of Woosung ... No major damage...

From here, Road Runner speeds off, leaving the coyote to fall on the ground. Wile E. recovers quickly, kicks up some dust, and begins to chase Road. However, Road Runner leaves so much dust in the road that his pursuer cannot see where he is going. Eventually, except for his ears, Wile E. is completely enclosed in the dust. Road Runner pulls next to Wiley and beeps, alerting the coyote to his surroundings. Wile E.'s expression becomes foreboding, as both are apparently suspended in midair. As the dust clears, the coyote pokes his hands and feet through the bottom of the cloud, and then looks down to see nothing but air below him. The dust completely clears, showing that Road is perched on the edge of a cliff and the coyote on the wrong side of him. The poor coyote, once again, is subject to gravity. Determined not to let this happen again, Wile E. climbs up a very high escarpment and surveys his surroundings for Road Runner...who happens to have pulled up right behind him and now beeps such that the coyote falls back down. Dusting himself off, the coyote gets up and walks out onto the road until Road beeps a second time and sends his rival directly into a low-slung rock plateau.\n1. As he hasn't studied it enough, Wiley follows the instructions of The Art of Roadrunner-Trapping: 1. Dig hole in road; 2. Camouflage hole; 3. Wait patiently; and 4. Eat Roadrunner. However, he never gets past the first step, as the jackhammer he uses vibrates enough to pull the coyote into the hole. When the power cord stretches enough to pull the plug out, the coyote climbs out and finds himself vibrating sporadically. To \"punish\" the book, Wile E. walks over to it and prepares to tear it in half, but one of the vibrations does the job for him.\n2. Still trying to stop Road in his tracks, Wile E. builds a brick wall on the mountain roads and waits, with one last leftover vibration from the jackhammer incident. Soon, he hears Road braking in front of the wall. When his ears recover from the sonic assault and the dust cloud settles, he quizzically looks around the corner of the wall to see his own rear end. Wile E. makes random movements, which are imitated by his rear. After looking behind and ahead of him, Wile E. finally determines that this is a duplicate of himself and rolls dynamite under his \"doppelganger\"'s rear. The firework promptly explodes, and Wile laughs until he realizes it is his own tail on fire. He leaps directly into the air in pain and falls down to the ground.\n3. Wile E., knowing about the \"birds and the bees,\" leaves out bird seed for Road Runner while he prepares to release a jar of bumblebees from a distance. But when Wile pulls the lid off, instead of attacking the munching Road Runner next to them, the swarm flies 400 feet in the distance towards the coyote and repeatedly stings him.\n4. Wile E. now prepares a second bird-seed trap, this time hoping to squash the flightless bird with an anvil. Of course, when Wile walks onto the board to drop the anvil, it breaks under his weight and falls towards Road Runner, who simply steps to the side out of danger. The board halves fall on top of the resulting large hole to create a convenient bridge for Road Runner back to his lunch.\n5. Having had enough of the simple traps, Wile E. builds a long ramp and lights a bomb which should blow up Road Runner when it gets to the bottom. But as soon as he lights the fuse, the bomb goes off.\n6. Now, the coyote prepares a giant catapult in the road; however, the boulder is too heavy for the catapult to sling at the passing the bird and flattens its owner.\n7. Finally, Wile E. hopes to fire at Road Runner with a harpoon. The rope, however, is around one of the coyote's feet, and drags the coyote's rear over a cactus and under several rocks, then directly into open space. The coyote sees the pickle he is in and recovers in time to grab the very end of the rope. Unfortunately, the rope continues into a very thin pipe, then out onto the road and directly into a chicken race with a truck. Wile E. smashes directly through the truck, even, and then the spear finally impales a rock face, but this leads to the coyote being swung down into the path of a train and bumped all the way up to the edge of a precipice, ragged and exhausted while gasping for air and whimpering. Road Runner pulls up directly behind him, but instead of beeping, the bird shows a soft side by holding up a sign saying: \"I just don't have the heart.\" He dashes back the way he came, and the sign spins to \"'Bye!\"", "tmdb_id": 118498}}
