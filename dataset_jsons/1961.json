Once inside, Holly cannot find her keys, so she buzzes her landlord, Mr. Yunioshi, to let her in. Later, she is awakened by new neighbor Paul Varjak, who rings her doorbell to get into the building. The pair chat as she dresses to leave for her weekly visit to mobster Sally Tomato, who is currently incarcerated at Sing Sing. Tomato's lawyer pays her $100 a week to deliver \"the weather report\".\nAs she is leaving, Holly is introduced to Paul's \"decorator\", wealthy older woman Emily Eustace Failenson, whom Paul nicknames \"2E\". That night, when Holly goes out onto the fire escape to elude an over-eager date, she peeks into Paul's apartment and sees 2E leaving money and kissing him goodbye. Visiting Paul afterward, she learns he is a writer who has not had anything published since a book of vignettes five years before. Holly, in turn, explains she is trying to save money to support her brother Fred after he completes his Army service.

Paul tells her he will investigate and eventually confronts Holly's husband, Doc Golightly, who explains that Holly's real name is Lula Mae Barnes and that they were married when she was approaching 14. Now he wants to take her back to rural Texas. After Paul reunites Holly and Doc, she informs Paul that the marriage was annulled. At the Greyhound bus station, she tells Doc she will not return with him, and he leaves broken-hearted.\nAfter drinking at a club, Paul and Holly return to her apartment, where she drunkenly tells him that she plans to marry Trawler for his money.  A few days later, Paul learns that one of his short stories will be published. On the way to tell Holly, he sees a newspaper headline stating that Trawler has married someone else. Holly and Paul agree to spend the day together, taking turns doing things each has never done before.  At Tiffany's, Paul has the ring from Doc Golightly's box of Cracker Jack engraved as a present for Holly. After spending the night together, he awakens to find her gone.

They share a moment while Terry is showing her the antique Japanese artworks on display in the embassy, and after some reluctance, she agrees to allow him to call on her.\nThey begin dating and they quickly fall in love, even though Terry occasionally has fits of anti-Western sentiment. When Terry asks her to marry him, she agrees, much to the chagrin of Aunt Peggy (who was raised in the Jim Crow South), and who sees the relationship as unnatural, especially when there are \"nice clean young men\" available. The Japanese ambassador also calls on Gwen and attempts to dissuade her from accepting, claiming that it would hurt Terry's career by giving him an American bias, and states that even though the two countries are friendly, anything could happen between foreign countries. He seems to hint at possible aggression in the future, even though it is only 1935 and the Japanese have not yet resumed conflicts with China, keeping the countries of Gwen and Terry at an uneasy peace. They eventually marry despite the obstacles and, when Terry is recalled, travel to Japan by ship.\nAlmost immediately after disembarking and arriving in Tokyo, Terry begins to treat Gwen much differently, expecting her to behave according to the male-centric beliefs of contemporary Japan, such as being silent among men, entering doors after the men and virtually bending to every whim of Terry and her male relatives. They continually fight and make up, mostly because of Gwen's outspokenness among men and Terry's strict adherence to the local customs.\nAfter having a fight one night when a general says that Terry should be proud that he may have a son to die for the emperor, they make up and she reveals that she was so offended by the comment because she is pregnant. The baby daughter is named Mako.\nBy November 1941, Terry has been reassigned to the embassy in America. They have Thanksgiving dinner in Washington with Aunt Peggy, as World War II embroils the world around them and the U.S. is one of the few powers of the world still at peace. Terry speaks on the phone with his friend Haro. He mentions that Mako, now about five years old, has an apparent illness involving too many antibodies in her blood. He also mentions a possible upcoming invasion of Thailand by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nSensing that it may be the last chance for peace between the U.S. and the Empire of Japan, Terry attempts to go over the heads of his superiors and have a cable sent directly to President Roosevelt, alerting him to cable the Japanese emperor to seek to preserve the peace. However, the emperor is rapidly becoming the leader of Japan in name only because of a power struggle with the army leaders. Terry's effort is in vain, as December 7th comes and war is declared shortly after the Japanese attack.\nTerry calls Gwen after hearing of the attack and tells her to leave Washington for Tennessee with Mako, but the FBI enter and force her to hang up the phone. She decides to accompany Terry back to Japan, as he is due to be deported in an ambassador exchange. A riot nearly occurs as she leaves with the other Japanese families, because of anti-Japanese fervor sweeping the nation in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines and other European and American-held colonies and bases in the Pacific and Asia.\nIn Japan, a similar nationalist anti-American hatred is present among the citizens. Terry is less enthusiastic about the war, and attempts to be a mediator for peace, which is dangerous because of the prevailing sentiment and the secret police. Gwen is briefly accosted by a group of soldiers, who try to force her to walk on an American flag. She refuses, and an air raid begins, causing panic in the streets as bombs begin to destroy the area. She sees a crying child and, remembering her daughter, runs to the smoldering school to rescue Mako, who says that children had hit her and called her an American.\nLater, Terry reveals that he is under suspicion for being disloyal because he has an American wife, does not belong to any patriotic clubs, and speaks out against the war. Soldiers enter and search the house, and while they don't arrest him, it is clear that he and his family are going to have a rough time as long as they stay in Tokyo. They agree to stay at a friend's empty house outside of the city.\nAs they leave Tokyo, they run into Terry's cousin, Ishi, who has been one of the few people who has been kind to Gwen. Now a soldier, he informs them that he is captain in a kamikaze squadron, and will soon \"die for a descendent of the sun-god.\" While taking a train, Gwen sees captured American soldiers, possibly on a death march. They arrive at their new home and meet the young girl who lives there. Terry reveals that he is going back to Tokyo, and that he did not tell her earlier because she would not have gone to stay without him. He offers to arrange her passage back to the U.S., but she refuses, wanting to be close to her husband.\nAs the war continues, food shortages and widespread damage make it clear that things are going against Japan. As the years go on, Terry visits less and less, and Mako grows up not knowing any other existence other than one of perpetual war. Terry returns after months and they enjoy a night's sleep together. They awaken to a visit from a military police officer, who is looking for Terry. As the war continues to turn against them, they begin to suspect disloyalty from anyone critical of the government. Gwen manages to convince them that she has not seen Terry, and they leave. Terry reveals that he has brought a radio, and an American news station announces the end of the Battle of Iwo Jima, which will be used as a base to launch bombers against mainland Japan. Later on, the surrender of Nazi Germany, Japan's main ally, is also announced, and it is clear that the invasion of Japan is coming soon.\nTerry and Gwen have a fight one night because he gave away the last of their food. Gwen goes to the village to get her hair done to please her husband, and on her way home, she allows Mako to play in the village, but then a squadron of American bombers and fighters attack. The couple rush to find her, and amid the devastation of the village, they find Mako, alive and unhurt. However, her close friend has been hit and was killed instantly. At the burial, Gwen comments on Mako's jaded reaction, showing no tears or emotion for her friend, because of Japanese customs, as well as growing up during a war.\nOne night, Gwen visits Terry's old friend Hara, who has some power within the party, pleading for him to keep her husband safe. He introduces her to Tokyo Rose, a radio propaganda announcer who tries to lower the morale of enemy armies listening to her broadcasts. They agree to help Terry, but only if Gwen makes an anti-American speech on the radio, recognizing the propaganda value of an actual American denouncing her country. Gwen refuses, and learns that Ishi has been fatally injured and is in the hospital. She visits, and realizing that he is dying, she asks why he had sent his wife away. He reveals that it is because of tradition that he did not want his loved ones to see him die. She returns home in time to see Terry, who had been hiding in the hills to avoid arrest, return.\nThe next day, the entire village arrives at their house, as it is the only one with a radio, for the emperor's radio address. The emperor has never spoken in public before, so they realize he must have major news, possibly of a surrender. As the village listens to the emperor's voice for the first time, the speech starts:\n\nWe are fully aware of the innermost feelings of all of you, however, have resolved to pave the way for peace for all generations to come. By enduring the unendurable, and suffering what is insufferable, let the entire nation unite as one family, from generation to generation, and cultivate the ways of rectitude and nobility of spirit.\nWith the war over, Terry asks Gwen to return to her home of Johnson City, Tennessee to put Mako in an American school while she is young and can lose her prejudices against America, to \"become a bridge between the two nations.\" Gwen vehemently refuses to leave him. Later on, she finds Terry, who has been overworked, malnourished and ill for many months, standing over his parents' graves. She recalls a speech that he once gave her about visiting the graves of ancestors at times of marriage, birth, and death. She also recalls the conversation with Ishi at the hospital before his death when he said that he did not want his wife to see him die. She speaks to Terry's doctor and learns that he has, at most, months to live, and was trying to send his family away because, like his cousin, he didn't want them to see him die.\nDays later, after Gwen agrees to Terry's final wish for her and Mako to depart for America, he sees her and their daughter off at the dock. They kiss and embrace for the last time, and Gwen reassures Terry that they will be expecting him soon, knowing that she will never see him again.\nAs the ship departs, Terry walks down the dock, keeping pace with it until he can go no further.

Two of the emirs, al-Mu'tamin of Zaragoza and al-Kadir of Valencia, are captured. More interested in peace than in wreaking vengeance, Rodrigo escorts his prisoners to Vivar and releases them on condition that they never again attack lands belonging to King Ferdinand of Castile. The Emirs proclaim him \"El Cid\" (Castilian Spanish for the Arabic for milord: \"al-Sidi\") and swear allegiance to him.\nFor his act of mercy, Don Rodrigo is accused of treason by Count Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez. In court, the charge is supported by Chimene's father, Count Gormaz, the king's champion. Rodrigo's aged father, Don Diego, angrily calls Gormaz a liar. Gormaz strikes Don Diego, challenging him to a duel. At a private meeting Rodrigo begs Gormaz to ask the aged but proud Diego for forgiveness (for accusing Rodrigo of treason). Gormaz refuses, so Rodrigo fights the duel on Diego\u2019s behalf and kills his opponent. Chimene witnesses the death of Gormaz and swears to avenge him, renouncing her affection for Rodrigo.\nWhen the King of Aragon demands the city of Calahorra from Castile, Rodrigo becomes Ferdinand's champion, winning the city in single combat. In his new capacity he is sent on a mission to collect tribute from Moorish vassals to the Castilian crown. He asks that Chimene be given to him as his wife upon his return, so that he can provide for her. Chimene promises Count Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez she will marry him instead if he kills Rodrigo.

Sancho refuses to accept anything but an undivided kingdom as his birthright. After Alfonso instigates a knife fight, Sancho overpowers his brother and sends him to be imprisoned in Zamora. Rodrigo, who swore to protect all the king\u2019s children, single-handedly defeats Alfonso's guards and brings the Prince to Calahorra. Sancho arrives to demand Alfonso, but Urraca refuses to hand him over. Rodrigo cannot take a side in the conflict, because his oath was to serve them all equally.\nBen Yusuf arrives at Valencia, the fortified city guarding the beach where he plans to land his armada. To weaken his Spanish opponents he hires Dolfos, a warrior formerly trusted by Ferdinand, to assassinate Sancho and throw suspicion for the crime on Alfonso, who becomes the sole king. At Alfonso's coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Alfonso, genuinely innocent (although his ally Urraca was aware of the plot), is offended by the demand and banishes Rodrigo from Spain. Chimene discovers she still loves Rodrigo and voluntarily joins him in exile. Rodrigo makes his career as a soldier elsewhere in Spain, and he and Chimene have twin girls.\nYears later, Rodrigo, now known widely as \"El Cid\", is called back into the service of the king to protect Castile from Yusuf's North African army. However, Alfonso rejects an alliance with El Cid's Muslim friends, and rather than work directly with the king, El Cid allies himself with the emirs to besiege Valencia, where the cowardly al-Kadir has violated his oath of allegiance to Rodrigo and come out in support of Ben Yusuf.\nAfter being defeated by the Moors at the Battle of Sagrajas, Alfonso seizes Chimene and her children and puts them in prison.

Al-Kadir tries to intercede, but the Valencians kill him and open the gates to the besiegers.

Doctors inform him that they can probably remove the arrow and save his life, but he will be incapacitated for a long time after the surgery. Unwilling to abandon his army at this critical moment, Rodrigo obtains a promise from Chimene to leave the arrow and let him ride back into battle, dying or dead. A guilt-ridden King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness. Rodrigo grants it, and Alfonso promises to look after Rodrigo's children.\nRodrigo dies, and a rumor of his death spreads. His allies honor Rodrigo's final wish.

Her mother objects to the relationship, fearing Claudelle will end up in the same rut she is, being married to a poor farmer, resulting in a stormy marriage. Claudelle is forced to endure her parents' many arguments stemming from Jessie's unhappiness having to be married to Clyde, a poor but hard-working farmer.\nAt the same time, rich, middle-aged, portly landowner S.T.

She shares these feelings with her pastor Rev. Armstrong (Ford Rainey), leaving church one Sunday morning. A few days later, a despondent Claudelle waits for the mailman Mr. Gunstom (William Fawcett) on the porch of her house. Just then, Mr. Gunstom delivers a letter from Linn to an ecstatic Claudelle. Her joy is soon turned to sorrow as Linn tells Claudelle in his letter that, sometime back, he met a nice girl who's been very good to him and that he plans to marry her. Jessie hears Claudelle crying and tells her she's glad it happened and she should set her sights on S.T., as she feels having a rich husband brings true happiness. A crying Claudelle rejects this idea and locks herself in her room. When discussing Claudelle and Linn's breakup, Jessie tells Clyde how she wishes they hadn't married so she could be living better.\nClaudelle wakes up the next morning after a bad storm and decides to get revenge on Linn the best way she knows how by becoming the town bad girl and teasing all the local boys.

Finding out she is available again, S.T. tries everything to win Claudelle over. He asks Clyde to persuade Claudelle to marry him; but Clyde, not liking S.T.'s intentions towards his daughter, refuses to do so, telling S.T. that no young girl would marry a man their age. S.T. then buys Claudelle a pair of red shoes she has wanted for a long time and proposes to her when he gives them to her, but she laughs him off telling him he is too old and fat and sends him on his way.

At night, she cries in her sleep over memories of Linn and subconsciously realizes that being a bad girl is not going to help her cope with the pain. Nevertheless, she continues down her thorny path, accumulating many nice gifts, necklaces, perfume, etc., from all her male suitors. One night, at a local dance at a local dive, Claudelle meets a husky, rugged, aggressive drifter Rip Guyler (Robert Colbert), who instantly becomes infatuated with her, telling her he'll see her soon.\nOne night, S.T. shows up to take out Claudelle and sees what he thinks is her in the shadows coming to his car and it turns out to be Jessie, who, on a whim, is wearing Claudelle's white dress. S.T. is disappointed when Jessie tells him that Claudelle has stood him up again and gone out with Davy. S.T. tells Jessie how he thought she was Claudelle and how she reminds him of a young pretty girl wearing her white dress and asks her to go riding with him. Jessie, by this time, is completely indifferent to any feelings she had for her husband (who is sound asleep in the house), and she accepts S.T.'s offer. The two of them go riding down to the local make-out place by the lake where they are spotted by Claudelle and Davy, who laughs hysterically at them.

Claudelle quickly rushes home, locking herself in her room, refusing to talk to Clyde or Jessie. Back at Harley's store, Dennis takes an expensive watch from the display case, planning to give it to Claudelle as an engagement present. Harley tries to stop Dennis from doing this, and the two get into a heated argument over the watch. Harley, not wanting Dennis to find out about his sexual encounter with Claudelle, does everything he can to talk Dennis from going to see Claudelle, but Dennis ignores his dad and drives off, with Harley having a war-weary look on his face.\nDennis arrives at Claudelle's house with the watch he plans to give her as an engagement present. Clyde is in the house telling Jessie his shame over her fling with S.T. when he hears Dennis pull up. Clyde tells Dennis to leave; but, when Dennis tells Clyde his intentions on proposing to Claudelle, he agrees to let her come out to see Dennis. Thinking this may settle her down, Clyde tries to talk to Claudelle. Rip shows up in his big hot rod to take out Claudelle, and he and Dennis get into a bad fight. Clyde breaks up the fight and orders Rip to leave. While Clyde and Jessie help Dennis clean his wounds, bad girl Claudelle takes off with Rip.\nLate that night, when they return, Dennis surprises Rip by tossing a wrench through his windshield.

With his youth, Vito lacks the ability to cope with the destruction of his idealistic view of Iris, and an explosive, and even momentarily violent, argument ensues between the two.\nAfter a week, Iris reaches out to Vito, hoping to make up with him by inviting him to her apartment for dinner. But upon his arrival, she quickly realizes that his interest in her has waned. While he had been sincere in his declarations of love for her, those feelings of \"love\" were just as prone to be fleeting as with any typical 17-year-old inexperienced in romantic relationships. Although he is no longer angry with Iris over her occupation, the discovery and subsequent argument have been enough so that even as his temper cooled, so did his passion for the relationship.\nContinuing to be sincere in expressing his feelings for her, Vito acknowledges what Iris has sensed. He is truly sorry for the pain that it is causing her and tries his best to console her, telling her that he wishes the fight between them that changed his feelings had not happened. But beyond that, there is nothing else he can do. Lest Vito have any doubt, the devastated Iris assures him that her love for him was, and still is, genuine.

Doonan, an alcoholic, has fallen out of favor with the island's residents because he stumbled upon the island's carefully hidden secret: leprosy among the children of the islands.

After the Italian surrender on September 8, 1943, the Italian king abandons his army and flees south.

But his sidecar gets confiscated and the two are taken prisoner by the German forces, who immediately recognize the professor for his academic fame and a have him in a Gestapo list of wanted men, due to a publication opposing the Jews'persecution.\nThe couple manage to escape thanks to Bonaf\u00e8's ability to improvise an explosive formula, and taking advantage of confusion during an allied air raid. They don German uniforms to pass unnoticed during the commotion and get momentarily separated. Later they reunite and again, while Arcovazzi is stealing a Schwimmwagen in order to continue his mission of delivering Bonaf\u00e8 to fascist authorities in Rome, the professor tries in vain to desert him.\nThe following night the two men stop to sleep in a barn, and they meet again by chance the thieving girl. She is afraid but the trio eventually reconcile over the attempts to capture and cook a chicken for dinner.\nIn the morning the girl wakes up first and leaves with all of Arcovazzi's and Bonaf\u00e8's clothes and accessories, except for their Schwimmwagen. Depressed by the events but still faithful to his mission, Arcovazzi tries to continue. He attempts to ford a stream, trusting in the Schwimmwagen's amphibious qualities but, due to previous damage or his own ineptitude, the vehicle sinks.\nUpon eventually reaching a village on foot, Arcovazzi tries to ask for help at the local fascist party cell (\"Casa del Fascio\"). The place is however deserted, and the only people around are a couple of teenagers, armed and brain-washed by fascist propaganda. Arcovazzi is questioned to prove his knowledge of fascist lore, and kept at gun point until able to prove his trustworthiness. Only professor Bonaf\u00e8's help in answering the last question allows him to answer the last challenge and to avoid being shot. But even after gaining the teenagers' trust, there is no support to be had and Arcovazzi is only able to confiscating a tandem bicycle and a pistol, again to resume his struggle of delivering Bonaf\u00e8 as prisoner in Rome.\nAgain the duo has to stop when bursting a tire, in the neighborhood of the town of Rocca Sabina. Arcovazzi recognizes it as the home of (fictitious) nationalist poet Arcangelo Bardacci, whom he idolizes and whose writings (which he can quote verbatim) prompted him to become a fascist. Upon reaching the poet's house, he is told however that the poet had joined the Royal Italian Army in Albania and perished in the struggle. In reality Bardacci is alive and hiding in the house, biding his time hiding in the cellar until the regime he once endorsed finally collapses.\nArcovazzi is oblivious to the false tale and accepts hospitality in the poet's house, while Bonaf\u00e8 discovers the truth and is allowed to escape in exchange of a promise to assist with Bardacci's political rehabilitation in the future. Despite the head start, Arcovazzi however manages to catch once again his prisoner, and resumes the voyage towards Rome with his captive.\nFor a while the two can travel on a methane powered pullman, but during one of the frequent stops the professor escapes once again. By the time Arcovazzi manages to recapture him, the pullman is long gone and again they must walk, eventually reaching the outskirts of Rome in the dusk hours of early June, 1944.\nUnbeknown to them the Italian Capital has just been conquered by the Allies. As they walk, they see increasing signs of the mutated situation, with groups of GIs celebrating their victory, whom Arcovazzi mistakes for war prisoners. Upon meeting once again the young girl, he demands back his clothes but gladly accepts her \"even better\" mocking offer of a full fascist \"Federale\" uniform, anticipating his promotion for successful delivery of Bonaf\u00e8 as prisoner.\nDespite his new uniform, Arcovazzi is initially just mocked by the U.S. troops that they meet further on within the capital, contrary to fascist propaganda which maintained all allied soldiers were bloodthirsty brutes. He is still continuing his attempt to complete the mission in an increased state of confusion, when he is spotted instead by Italian resistance fighters of the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale that are also convening into the city. Together with other civilians, they attack Arcovazzi who is about to be lynched by the people. Only Bonaf\u00e8 saves his captor, pretending to shoot him but in reality throwing away his uniform and offering his jacket to allow him to hide his compromised political affiliation.

The pipe breaks and he falls to his death. He tells everyone not to call the police. A remorseful Joss confesses to Eliot that she has denounced him to the police. At her request, he gives her a grownup kiss. Then he disposes of Paul's body and disappears.\nWhile Renard is questioning the unco-operative children the next morning, their solicitor uncle, Mr Bullock (Maurice Denham), arrives.

The story is told in flashback as Michael recounts their friendship, when he first befriended Rachel by hurrying her away from a group of schoolboys who were verbally bullying her on the playground. They quickly become the best of friends. The young children decide to become \"blood brothers\" by pricking their fingers and rubbing the blood together. They set off for an adventure, hoping to go to London to visit the queen, but instead are picked up by a kindly elderly lady (Sybil Thorndike) who takes them to her home for tea, pretending that she is a princess and that her mansion is one of the queen's homes, but that the queen is currently away. Her amiable deception goes over perfectly, and the children have a great time visiting with her.\nMichael and Rachel are aware that they worship on different days and their religions are somewhat different, but they do not ponder the specifics. However, when a somewhat overbearing and destructively-outspoken classmate informs Michael that Rachel is Jewish and that \"the Jews killed Christ\", an outraged Michael rushes to Rachel at their clubhouse and angrily confronts her, \"Why did you kill Christ?\" Rachel is shocked and insistently denies it: \"I didn't kill him. I don't even know him\". Michael and Rachel conclude that God is angry at them for becoming friends, but they are not sure if He will forgive them. They decide to attend church with each other to see if God is mad at them, believing they will die if He does not want them to go to each other's church. Michael sneaks into the synagogue with Rachel the next Saturday and is somewhat puzzled and intimidated by the ceremony, but he stays and seems to like it as time goes on, especially after the kindly rabbi shows him a passage in the Torah that speaks of God's love shielding him from all fear. The next day, Rachel goes with Michael to his church, and while Rachel is initially somewhat unnerved by the services and statues, she too feels more comfortable after a while, especially as the Blessed Virgin's gentle expression appeals to her: \"It's all right, Mike. The lady likes me.\"\nHaving concluded it is acceptable to God that they remain friends, Michael and Rachel decide to take an inflatable raft on the  River Thames for their next adventure, a trip to Africa. All goes well at first as Michael paddles and the raft drifts leisurely and makes smooth ripples on the calm water, but then when the duo passes into a dangerous section of the river with a swifter flow and strong rapids, Michael loses control of the raft, and Rachel is knocked overboard. Due to the stronger current and the riverbank's dense underbrush in which Rachel has become entangled, Michael has great difficulty reaching her, but at last pulls her out of the river; however, she is limp and unresponsive. Fearing the worst, Michael frantically rushes to get help, and adults in the area call for an ambulance. The film then returns to the present moment, with Michael in his grief-stricken state, and telling the priest that he's killed Rachel. The priest comforts him and tells him that Rachel may be all right, and then accompanies him to Rachel's home to see how she is. They are met at the front door by Rachel's rabbi who is leaving, and he smilingly informs them that Rachel has pulled through after all and is recovering well, but that perhaps it would be better to wait till tomorrow to visit her. Michael, immensely relieved, rushes home happy that his little friend is still alive, and the priest and the rabbi --- who earlier in the film have been established as being good friends despite their differing religions (just as the Catholic boy Michael and Jewish girl Rachel had become close), and acknowledging that their respective religions actually hold more in common than they may have realized before --- speak warmly to each other before walking away in different directions.", "tmdb_plot": "Seven-year-olds Michael and Rachel are best friends who do everything together and who have vowed to remain friends \"forever and ever and can't be parted for never and never\".

Anand takes it personally and walks out. On the way back home he sees an Indian Army poster. Eager as he is to get a job, he quickly enrolls, much to the displeasure of his mother. Mita, not knowing what has happened between her father and Anand, visits his home and learns that Anand has left to serve in the Army. She tells his mother that, being her future daughter-in-law, she will stay with Anand's mother. Mita makes sure that Anand does not learn about her presence at his home and takes care of his mother.\nMeanwhile, Anand gets trained and is posted in a war zone. At his camp, Anand befriends Major Verma, a man who looks just like him (except that he has a moustache). With time, a bond develops between the two. The Major tells Anand about his personal life, his wife Ruma and his mother. As fate would have it, Major Verma goes missing in the war, and is presumed dead. A telegram is sent to his family saying that they are unable to trace him.\nOn the other hand, Anand is promoted for his heroic acts. He returns home to find Mita there and learns of his mother's death. Anand envisions what Verma's family must be going through in his absence. He decides to break the news of the Major's death personally and visits their home. Upon seeing him, the Major's mother mistakes him for her son and hugs him. Ruma too is overjoyed. Anand tells the family doctor of his true identity, but the doctor advises Anand against telling Ruma the truth since Ruma suffers from heart disease and cannot bear emotional stress. To keep Ruma happy and stress-free, Anand has no choice but to play the part of Major Verma, and starts spending more and more time at Verma's home. Mita grows unhappy about Anand's continuous absence from home. Once, when she sees him at a temple with Ruma, she concludes that he is having an affair and leaves him.\nAt the same time, Anand is not comfortable with being close to Ruma. This pains Ruma and she asks him why he is so distant from her, and when they would have a child. Anand replies that the war has changed him and he would never have a child with her. However, Ruma starts to think that Major Verma no longer loves her and is having an extra-marital affair.\nIt is now revealed that the Major is alive, though he has lost a leg. He reaches home and finds Anand in his place. He misjudges him and believes that he is taking sexual advantage of Ruma. Major Verma ambushes Anand on a secluded street and tries to kill him. A scuffle ensues, and the attempt to shoot Anand fails. Anand explains that he is merely playing his part to keep Verma's family happy and his wife healthy. To convince the Major, Anand tells him to come to the temple the next day. He also communicates the same to Mita.\nThe next day, Anand comes to the temple with Ruma. As Major Verma and Mita secretly listen on, Ruma again complains to Anand about the lack of physical intimacy between them. Anand then asks her whether she would leave her husband if he were to become handicapped. Ruma's answer is an emphatic no.\nAt this point, the real Major Verma reveals himself and Ruma hugs him. Mita too understands the situation and reconciles with Anand.

Now, coincidentally, Gauri looks exactly like Shankar Singh (also played by Uttam Kumar). This being the last hope, the fauji Sardar requests him to pretend to be the King for the coronation and until the real King can be found. Gauri agrees. The two set off for Jhind.\nThings aren't easy at the Palace in Jhind. Despite the great luxury of kingly life, Gauri is constantly threatened by Udit and his friend, the dashingly handsome but evil Mayurvahan (Soumitra Chatterjee). The coronation however takes place successfully; moreover, the pretend King becomes engaged to Rani Kasturi Bai (Arundhati Devi) on the occasion. In spite of the situation becoming more and more tense, with the life of the King at stake, a romance blooms between Kasturi Bai and Gauri.\nA secret agent reveals that the real King is hidden in a fortress owned by Udit, who will murder him as soon as he gets rid of Gauri. The fauji Sardar then reveals to Gauri in secret that Gauri deserves the throne as much as Shankar or Udit because they were all the sons of the then-Dewan of Jhind, Kali Shankar Roy. The then-king being issue less, adopted Shankar and Udit as sons.\nAfter a secret entry to the fortress where the King is being held prisoner, Gauri fights a battle with Mayurvahan, finally killing him as well as surprising and killing Udit. As he approaches his look-alike Shankar Singh, he has a momentary desire to kill the King and gain the kingdom for himself, he being as deserving by blood as Shankar Singh; but his humanity wins over and he approaches the King respectfully, addressing him as \"Your Highness\".

Haywood is particularly interested in learning how the defendant Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster) could have committed the atrocities he is accused of, including sentencing innocent people to death. \nErnst Janning's character is a composite of three different judges, loosely based on the life of Franz Schlegelberger. Janning, it is revealed, is a well-educated and internationally respected jurist and legal scholar. \nHaywood seeks to understand how the German people could have been deaf and blind to the Nazi regime's crimes. In doing so, he befriends the widow (Marlene Dietrich) of a German general who had been executed by the Allies. He talks with others Germans who have varying perspectives on the war. \nOther characters the judge meets are US Army Captain Harrison Byers (William Shatner), who is assigned to assist the American judges hearing the case, and Irene Hoffmann (Judy Garland), who is afraid to provide testimony that may bolster the prosecution's case against the judges.\nGerman defense attorney Hans Rolfe (Maximilian Schell) argues that the defendants were not the only ones to aid or ignore the Nazi regime. He claims the United States has committed acts just as bad or worse than the Nazis, such as US Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.'s support for the first eugenics practices (see Buck v. Bell); the German-Vatican Reichskonkordat of 1933, which the Nazi-dominated German government exploited as an implicit early foreign recognition of Nazi leadership; Joseph Stalin's part in the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939, which removed the last major obstacle to Germany's invasion and occupation of western Poland, initiating World War II; and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the final stage of the war in August 1945.Janning, meanwhile, testifies for the prosecution, admitting he is guilty of the alleged crime: condemning to death a Jewish man of \"blood defilement\" charges\u2014namely, that the man had intimate relations with a 16-year-old Gentile girl\u2014when he knew there was no evidence to support such a verdict. \nDuring his testimony, Janning explains that well-meaning people like himself supported  Adolf Hitler's anti-Semitic, racist policies out of patriotism while knowing it was wrong, and due to the effects of the post-World War I Treaty of Versailles. \nHaywood must weigh considerations of geopolitical expediency and ideals of justice. The trial is set against the background of the Berlin Blockade, and there is pressure to let the German defendants off lightly to gain German support in the growing Cold War against the Soviet Union.In the course of the movie, the reasons the three other defendants supported the Nazi regime becomes apparent: one was afraid, one was following orders, and one actually believed in Nazism.  All four defendants are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\nHaywood visits Janning in his cell. Janning affirms to Haywood that his verdict was a just one, but asks him to believe that, regarding the mass murder of innocents, he never knew that it would come to that.

The boy's grandfather comes to visit and tries to give the boy working tools for later in life, but the gifts are refused by the parents and fairies, who tell him that the boy is already promised happiness and will have no need to work.  They magically turn the grandfather into a sheet of paper and send him off to his apartment.  The grandfather, not liking the idea of his grandson having ready-made happiness, breaks out of his magical cage and decides to seek help.\nHe visits a friend of his; a scientist who works in a large laboratory with a collection of amazing inventions such as human-like robots, including one which can compose poetry.  He asks the scientist's robots what will become of a person who is born into ready-made happiness.  Most of them tell him that he will become disagreeable, lazy and arrogant, but the poetry-composing robot tells him that it would be terrible to take happiness away from a child. Unsure of what to do, the grandfather decides to visit the Land of Happiness and see for himself what it is like.  \nThe scientist synthesizes a copy of the magical red ball by using a few fragments that were left on the grandfather's hand after he held it while he was visiting his grandchild.

Coyote, standing on the road, pulls out an arrow-shaped sign saying \"Coyote\" and another saying \"Apetitius Giganticus\". The Road Runner speeds by with a Beep-beep and ruffles the coyote's fur. Wile flips the signs to read \"Road-Runner\" and \"Fastius Tasty-us\", and winds up his legs, followed by his body, and chases the Road Runner. When the Road Runner sees the Coyote chasing him, he taunts him and gears into superspeed (leaving a \"TOING!\" in his wake). This causes the road to roll up, a tunnel to turn inside-out, and a bridge to compress itself as he puts his would-be predator far behind. Wile E. stops short of the chasm from the latter, panting, and two light bulbs appearing in place of his eyes signal his new-found idea.\n1. Wile E. prepares himself to chase the Road Runner with his new roller skis, and skis off the plateau down the mountain and onto the road that the Road Runner is dashing over. As the camera cuts separately to Wile and the Road Runner, the bird turns across a U-turn at the end of a cliff, while Wile speeds off. When Wile E. realizes his mistake, he drops the ski poles, and soon slams into the side of another cliff. The Coyote looks up and down, trying to figure out how to escape, until he hears and sees the Road Runner at the top of the cliff. The skis provide a rather convenient \"spring\" for Wile E., who uses them to get closer and closer to grabbing the Road Runner. On his fourth jump, he is within millimeters of his opponent; but unfortunately, the downward force proves to be too much for a fifth, and the skis snap, causing him to succumb to gravity yet again.\n2. The Road Runner beeps at Wile E. from across the canyon, and the camera pans to the Coyote attempting to shoot himself over the canyon with a bow. Before he can fire, the very end of the cliff crumbles and the bow tips over the side. Wile E. flips himself over in the air, but this causes him to bounce up and get his head stuck inside the edge of the cliff.\n3. Wile E. lights a needle-nosed dart bomb and throws it at a target attached to a cactus, exploding all three items. He then gets in a hot air balloon with an artillery of dart bombs. Once Wile E. sees the Road Runner zipping over the road he lights the darts and releases them. The bombs circle in the air but the last one lands in the Coyote's balloon, blowing it up. He waves at the camera and falls toward the ground but stops himself by releasing a parachute. Unfortunately, another dart blows this up and Wile E. is left to wave at the camera with an AGAIN sign before resuming his plummet to the bottom. After the crash landing, a third dart follows him to the ground and explodes.\n4. The darts continue to plague Wile E. from this point onwards. Wile E. gives the Road Runner a snack while he awaits with a sledgehammer behind a turn. The Road Runner is heard approaching and the Coyote gets ready to strike, but another dart plants itself into the hammerhead and blows up the handle. The hammerhead lands on the Coyote's head, causing his eyes to register \"TILT\" like a pinball machine.\n5. The Coyote hurls a boomerang at the passing Road Runner but it misses, disappears behind a rock and comes back around with another dart attached. Wile E. starts to run from the boomerang which passes him when he isn't looking. Thinking he has outrun the bomb, Coyote stops but the boomerang also stops and hovers next to him. He turns and reacts with his eyes just before it detonates.\n6. Wile E. attempts a simple gun-in-the-woods trap which fails when once again another dart plugs the barrel and explodes. Adding insult to injury, yet another dart explodes under a huge boulder which flies through the air and flattens the Coyote.\n7. As the Road Runner traverses another road, the Coyote is shown at the top edge of a cliff, getting ready to drop an anvil. Another dart takes out a third of the cliff's edge and two more darts pepper the floating end. Wile E. jumps onto the \"secure\" main cliff, but the entire cliff falls down. The Coyote pulls himself on top of the anvil to avoid getting bonked on the head with it. The anvil smashes through the ground, followed by Wile E. and the floating end of the cliff with the two darts.

The men constantly bicker, often provoked by the bullying Corporal Johnstone or the forever mocking Bamforth. While Sergeant Mitchem and Corporal Johnstone are reconnoitering, Lance-Corporal Macleish (\"Mac\"), provoked,  beats up Bamforth. Tension rises as they fail to make radio contact with their base and pick up a Japanese broadcast, indicating that they are nearby. A Japanese scout appears: Johnstone grabs him and tells Taff to stab him. Taff cannot kill him in cold blood and, before Bamforth does, the returning Mitchem says they must take him back for interrogation.\nMitchem places Bamforth in charge of the prisoner, who Bamforth names Tojo. Bamforth realises Tojo is just another soldier, bonding over pictures of Tojo's family. Johnstone, enraged, tries to destroy the pictures but Bamforth, his frustrations boiling over, beats him up, risking a court martial. Mitchem sends Mac and Smudge to reconnoiter. They see a small patrol sending two soldiers to find Tojo. Knowing this endangers their patrol, Mac kills one but the other escapes. Mac and Smudge return to warn the patrol which tries to radio base to warn them, even though it may reveal their position. A taunting Japanese broadcast accelerates their decision to flee for their base.\nThey head for home. Mitchem now realises that the prisoner is a liability rather than as asset and Johnstone keeps offering to kill him. The group, temporararily blocked by a flash flood, take a break in the mine canyons and Bamforth is sent to keep watch. Johnstone spots Mac and Tojo enjoying a cigarette, and cruelly points out that the cigarettes are British, and Tojo must have stolen them from a British soldier he had killed. This affects the men who turn on Tojo. Johnstone sadistically rips up Tojo's cherished family photos and Mac searches and slaps him. Upon hearing the commotion, Bamforth returns and explains he gave Tojo the cigarettes. The men are ashamed and try to make amends by gathering and returning Tojo's possessions. Johnstone maliciously says that Tojo's cigarette case was made in Birmingham. As the men again grow hostile, Bamford responds that Tojo could have traded for it, forcing the youngest member (Whittaker) to admit that he does this.\nThe flood is receding and Mitchem asks Whittaker to make a last attempt to contact base before they leave. They plan to abandon the mules, blow up the special equipment and kill the prisoner Tojo. Bamforth is alone in protesting against killing Tojo and appeals for support from the other men without success. The radio responds to Whittaker's efforts but only a Japanese message can be heard. Tojo approaches him, trying in Japanese to explain the message. Panicking about the Japanese broadcast and ashamed from his unveiling as a looter, Whittaker mistakes Tojo's movements and shoots him dead with a machine gun. The radio crackles into life again and a Japanese accented English announces that the patrol is surrounded and demands their surrender. Whittaker's firing will have further alerted the Japanese.\nMitchem with Bamforth forms a rear guard to allow the others led by Johnstone to escape. The rear guard are soon defending against the main Japanese force. As the main group emerge, a Japanese sniper dispatches Taff and Mac. Although Whittaker is cut off, Johnstone tells Smudge they must return to Mitchem. As they flee, Smudge is also killed.\nMitchem is shocked to see the superficially injured Johnstone back alone but is shot by a sniper. As the Japanese close in, Johnstone implores Bamforth to surrender. Bamforth however shoots at the explosives. The explosion kills many attackers but also causes a rockfall, killing Bamforth.

The Catholic Church is reluctant to officially recognize this occurrence as a miracle, both fearing a loss of control in matters of faith, or a loss of face if the disappearance of the Eden bar would turn out to be a fabrication.\nMeanwhile, believers from all over the world pilgrimage to the former location of the bar. Soon the site becomes a fairground, with the towns people, profiteers and journalists trying to make a profit from the sudden influx of pilgrims and the miracle. This includes the sale of holy water, Malachia Stollen and miniature models of the Eden bar. A young woman, who was in the bar during the night the bar vanished, becomes a media star. Financial investors are buying the island where the Eden bar reappeared, and construct a casino that soon attracts crowds of people.\nFather Malachia is confronted with interview requests by journalists and by pilgrims beleaguering the church and hoping to meet him. As he has spent most of his life in the monastery, he feels helpless in the face of the excesses of modern society. He soon regrets that he asked God for a miracle. He travels to the island and prays for a second miracle that will end the frenzy, and is heard by God who returns the Eden bar to its original location.", "tmdb_plot": "\"Wunderbar\" takes on a new meaning in this routine satire by Bernhard Wicki about a bar that is miraculously transported by God Himself to a nearby, new location on an island.

Afterward, Roslyn's landlady Isabelle takes her to a cocktail lounge at Harrah's for drinks. At Harrah's they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord Langland, and his tow truck driver best friend, Guido. The friendly Guido tells Roslyn and Isabelle about his unfinished house in the country by Pyramid Lake. Later that day, the group drives out to the unfinished house Guido has built for his late wife. After drinking and dancing, Roslyn has had too much to drink, so Gaylord drives her home to Reno.\nEventually, Roslyn and Gaylord move into Guido's half-finished house and work on finishing it. One day, Gaylord tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his children, whom he has not seen for years. Later, he discovers rabbits have been eating the lettuce in the garden they have planted. Gay wants to kill the rabbits with his shotgun, an idea that Roslyn opposes.\nWhen Guido and Isabelle show up, Guido suggests that they round up wild mustangs to sell. They go to a local rodeo to hire a third man. They run into Perce Howland, a cowboy friend of Gaylord's, who wants to compete in the rodeo. Gaylord offers to pay the broke Perce's $10 entry fee if he will help round up mustangs the next day.\nAt the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap. Perce is thrown by a bucking horse, and Roslyn begs him to go to a hospital, and offers him money if he won't ride again, but he insists on riding a bull he had already signed up and paid to ride. He gets thrown again, sustaining a head injury.\n\nLater, he passes out in a back alley. When he regains consciousness, he sees Roslyn crying over him. He says that he never had anyone cry for him before and that he wished he had a friend to talk to. He tells her how his mother changed after his father died, giving his stepfather the ranch Perce's father wanted to leave to Perce. A drunken Gaylord then fetches Roslyn, telling her that he wants her to meet his kids, claiming he unexpectedly ran into them. When Gaylord discovers his children have already left the bar, he causes a public scene. It is unclear where the children were actually there.\nDuring the drive home, a drunken Guido recalls his wartime service as a bombardier, asks if Roslyn has left Gaylord and offers to take his place. Back at Guido's house, Guido attempts to finish the patio he started. Later, Gaylord asks Roslyn if a woman like her would ever want to have a child with him. She avoids the issue.\nThe next day, Gaylord, Guido and Perce go after the mustangs, with Roslyn reluctantly tagging along. Guido uses his biplane to flush out the horses from the mountains, and it turns out that there are only five of them, a stallion and four mares. Perce says that it is barely worth it to pursue so few horses.\nRoslyn becomes upset when she learns that they will be slaughtered for dog food. Gaylord tells Roslyn that he has always caught mustangs and that they used to be in immense herds, and that they made fine riding horses. But over time, he says, \"they changed it all around\" and now what was good is considered bad. He says that he catches the mustangs to preserve his freedom and prevent him from having to take a job for wages.\nAfter they catch the mustangs, Roslyn begs Gaylord to release the horses. He considers it, but when she offers to pay him $200, it angers him. Guido tells Roslyn that he would release them if she would leave Gaylord for him. She rebuffs him. Perce asks her if she wants him to set the horses free, but she declines because she thinks it would only start a fight. Perce frees the stallion anyway. After Gaylord chases down and subdues it by himself, he lets it go and says he just did not want anybody making up his mind for him. He pledges never to catch mustangs again, and says that what used to be good is now \"smeared in blood,\" and that roping mustangs is now like \"roping a dream.\" He says he has to \"find another way to be alive, if there is one.\"\nAs they are driving away in Gaylord's truck, Roslyn tells Gaylord that she will leave the next day.

Due to their fortitude, he has selected them to assist him in his efforts to make his achievements known to the world, especially since the Nautilus is incapacitated beyond repair and the volcano will soon erupt, destroying the island.\nWhen time runs out, the castaways discover that Nemo has invented an air-filled raising system which can refloat the pirate ship, the only readily seaworthy vessel on the island. Nemo teaches them to breathe underwater using his special \"shell\" air tanks, and they work to raise the ship, despite interference by a giant Ammonite.

These include a new business he started soon after the trial, using money that he claims to have made in the stock market; his own desperate desire for success; lying to his wife in order to secretly search for Clay; the suspicious new business with an unknown man, Morris Brooke, right after the trial; and Clay's claim, when Martha finds him, that he was an eyewitness to the crime and George was the murderer.\nGeorge and Martha repeatedly have conversations in which she vacillates between questioning him and insisting she believes in his innocence, and he alternates between insisting that she believe in him and telling her to make up her own mind. Tension is built by the repeated appearance of George's old-style shaving razor, his insistence that Martha join him at the edge of a cliff, references to his masculine virility and his warning that Martha's investigation could threaten his business.\nAt the conclusion, Clay tries to kill Martha after being seen sharpening George's razor.

Shaken by the sight of her dying friend, Lidia leaves saying she'll visit tomorrow. Giovanni stays behind and as he leaves his friend's room, a sick and uninhibited young woman attempts to seduce him, and he goes into her room and reciprocates. They are interrupted by the nurses. Outside the hospital, Giovanni sees his wife crying but does not comfort her. As they drive off, he tells her about his \"unpleasant\" encounter with the sick woman and is surprised when Lidia is not fooled and dismisses the incident as his responsibility. \nThey drive to a party celebrating Giovanni's new book, which has been well received. Giovanni signs books, while his wife looks on from a distance. After a while Lidia leaves. She wanders the streets of Milan, ending up in the neighborhood where she and Giovanni lived as newlyweds. She comes across a brutal street fight which she tries to stop and later she watches rockets being set off in a field. Back at the apartment, Giovanni finally hears from Lidia and he picks her up from the old neighborhood, which seems to have little sentimental value for him. She bathes, but he makes no move on her. Later they decide to go to a nightclub, where they watch a mesmerizing and seductive performance by a female dancer and engage in small talk. \"I no longer have inspirations, only recollections\", Giovanni tells his wife.

Later she sits at a table opposite an empty chair. Giovanni walks over and does not sit down and Lidia does not tell him about Tommaso's death. Giovanni sees Valentina and follows after her, leaving Lidia alone. Lidia walks to the band and appears to enjoy the music. A man named Roberto (Giorgio Negro), who had been following her, approaches, asks her to dance and she accepts. A sudden shower sends the guests running for cover and some jump in the pool like children. As Lidia is about to jump in from the diving board, Roberto stops her, takes her to his car and they drive off. She enjoys Roberto's company and their conversation but as he's about to kiss her, Lidia turns away from him, saying \"I'm sorry, I can't\".\nBack at the party, Giovanni searches through the crowd and finds Valentina alone, watching the rain. She tells him she's smart enough not to break up a marriage and instructs him to spend the rest of the evening with his wife.

After an attempt on the life of British high commander General Sir Lawrence MacKenzie-Smith (Danny Kaye) by German intelligence, all military camps in England are sealed off, resulting in leaves of absence being revoked. Ernie Williams (Kaye), a most reluctant American soldier, hypochondriac and talented mimic, and his fellow conscript Joseph Praeger (Jesse White) are thus left trapped in an Allied army camp in southeast England just before they can return to the States. In order to relieve his frustration, Ernie impersonates MacKenzie during dinner in the mess hall; a British officer entering the building falls for his disguise, sparking the idea in Praeger to use Ernie as a double to get them out of the camp. However, Praeger's unfamiliarity with cars causes them to be caught before they even get out of sight of the gate guards.\nThe incident and Ernie's remarkable resemblance to MacKenzie cause Allied military intelligence leaders Colonel Somerset (Wilfrid Hyde-White) and Colonel Houston (Gregory Walcott) to consider recruiting Ernie (under threat of court-martial) as the General's political decoy, in order to thwart the assassination plot. After Ernie is presented to MacKenzie in person, the General, after some initial reservations, agrees to the plan. MacKenzie's life is at stake because he is the leading strategist in the upcoming invasion of the European mainland; he is set to travel to Invasion Headquarters, adopting Ernie's identity as his disguise and vice versa in order to deceive German High Command. Only Sergeant Twickenham (Terence De Marney), MacKenzie's batman, is made privy to the situation, as he is to help Ernie maintain the deceit. However, the most vital detail \u2013 that Ernie will serve as a decoy target for German intelligence \u2013 is conveniently withheld from him.\nThe situation gradually begins to unravel when Lady Margaret (Dana Wynter), MacKenzie's wife, returns prematurely from a war bond tour in Canada to inform MacKenzie of her intention to divorce him, having tired of his neglect of her and his womanizing. As the result of Ernie's attempts to greet her with innocent marital affection, Lady Margaret quickly recognizes him as an impostor and is out of necessity made familiar with the situation. Taking pity on Ernie, she tells him more private details about MacKenzie which help complement his disguise. However, German intelligence continues its liquidation attempts, which result in Twickenham getting poisoned and a sniping attempt during a rallying speech to the troops, prompting Margaret to tell Ernie the entire truth. However, while trying to hand in his resignation from the project, Ernie and Margaret learn that the plane MacKenzie was travelling on was shot down by the Germans, with all hands lost, forcing Ernie to carry on the charade.\nAt a regimental party where Ernie is supposed to participate, the Secret Service intends to expose and apprehend a traitor who has been feeding information about MacKenzie to the Germans; one of his agents is revealed to be Captain Patterson (Allan Cuthbertson). During the party, Ernie is very nearly exposed as an impostor by his usual blunders and MacKenzie's aggressively domineering aunt, Lady Vivian (Margaret Rutherford). Acting upon Lady Margaret's advice, he pretends to be drunk and have a fight with his wife in order to have an excuse for leaving the party early. Afterwards, in private, Ernie and Margaret confess that they have developed feelings for each other, but then Ernie receives a message that the traitor was apparently caught and that he is ordered back to Headquarters. On his way there, he is kidnapped by Captain Patterson and Sergeant Bridget Stanhope (Diana Dors), MacKenzie's driver and mistress as well as Patterson's accomplice.\nErnie is flown to Berlin and interrogated about the Allied invasion plans, and his German captors refuse to believe his desperate attempts to explain that he is a mere decoy. Forced to go along with the game, he begins to blab about non-existent invasion plots, which the Germans readily take for the truth. Once left alone, Ernie acquires a list of German agents in Britain and facilitates his escape from German Headquarters. Chased through the streets of Berlin in the midst of a nocturnal bombing raid, he keeps changing disguises on the proverbial run, including a brief stint as Adolf Hitler and a subsequent cabaret act in a Berlin nightclub as \"Fr\u00e4ulein Lilli\" (in the style of Marlene Dietrich as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel, singing a mash-up of the various running gag catchphrases that have been in use throughout the film in a Germanicized English word salad, all to the tune of the 1934 song Cocktails for Two.)\nFinally, disguised as a pilot, Ernie boards a German bomber bound for England and manages to parachute out. Captured, he is brought to General Wiffingham (Rex Evans), a friend of MacKenzie's, but as he reads him the names on his list, Ernie discovers to his dismay that Wiffingham is the chief Nazi infiltrator within the British Secret Service. Somerset has in the meantime figured out Wiffingham's true allegiance on his own, and rescues Ernie before Wiffingham can have him silenced via summary execution by firing squad for espionage.

When another of its two-member crew Pegasus spacecraft mysteriously disappears, rumors begin circulating of space monsters and phantom planets. Captain Frank Chapman and his navigator Lt. Ray Makonnen are ordered to investigate.\nDuring the search, their spaceship suffers damage from a meteor shower, requiring that both men go outside to make repairs. A bullet-sized particle, however, pierces the air hose on Chapman's space suit, rendering him unconscious. Makonnen is able to repair the hose, but as he opens the airlock hatch, he is fatally struck by a similar particle. Makonnen's last act before being propelled into deep space is to push Chapman inside and close the airlock hatch. Chapman comes to and finds Makonnen gone and himself unable to communicate with the lunar base. He records a log entry about the preceding events, noting that he now must make a forced landing on an asteroid, that it is somehow pulling in his Pegasus spaceship.\nExiting his ship while still feeling the effects of the accident, Chapman collapses and sees tiny humanoids about six inches tall approaching. Once his helmet visor is opened, he can breathe but shrinks to their size due to the asteroid's atmosphere. He is taken underground.\nSesom, the aged and wise ruler of Rheton (the native name for the rocky and seemingly lifeless planetoid where Chapman has landed), explains that though his craft was brought down safely by their gravitational tractor beam, they had not been able to do same with the preceding Earth spaceships that came near, which were completely destroyed, along with their crews, when they crashed on Rheton's surface. He informs Chapman that he never can leave but will have all the rights of a citizen of Rheton. As he slept, Chapman's spaceship was sent into space to keep Rheton's existence a secret, and more importantly, their world's gravitational technology, which allows the Rhetonians to navigate their world through space.\nChapman meets two beautiful women: Sesom's smugly spoiled blond daughter Liara and the gentle but mute black-haired Zetha. Liara is more than willing to answer his many questions about Rheton. Sesom informs Chapman that he later may marry one of the women once he has become accustomed to living on Rheton.\nLiara, after following and engaging constantly with Chapman, declares her love for him, but Chapman, still eager to return to his own people, quietly rejects her. Herron, a young man who is in love with Liara, attempts to win her for himself by lying to Sesom, telling him Chapman is attempting to win over both women.\nStating that he believes this to be a crime against the people of Rheton, Herron requests a duel to the death. Chapman agrees, and the two engage in a form of combat where opponents must push each other onto gravity plates that cause immediate disintegration when touched. Just as Chapman is about to push Herron onto a plate, he lets Herron go, stating that he cannot kill someone for no reason.\nAs time goes on, Chapman and the mute Zetha become acquainted and eventually fall in love. Herron comes to Chapman late one night and offers to help him escape.\nAny plans for the future, however, are put on hold when Chapman discovers the reason for Rheton's erratic course through space: It is because the planetoid is being attacked by the Solarites, an alien race of \"fire people\" from an unidentified \"sun satellite\". They want to destroy Rheton with their flaming fighter craft so they can steal its secret of gravitational control.\nWith Chapman's help, Sesom and Herron destroy the enemy fleet using a gravity beam. During the battle, a giant 7-inch tall Solarite prisoner, captured during a previous raid, escapes when the gravity barrier holding him fails. Stalking corridors, the creature captures Zetha, who previously had been traumatized into silence by a childhood encounter with the savage species. After Sesom is attacked by this bug-eyed monster, Chapman and Herron attempt to rescue Zetha. Chapman defeats the Solarite by pushing it onto a gravity plate.\nWhile kidnapped, Zetha's muteness vanished when she saw Chapman about to be attacked by the creature, and she was able to scream, warning him. The return of her voice allows her to later confess her love for him. The two kiss, but Zetha knows that he must return to his home world. They are interrupted when a search party from Earth locates Chapman. In order to preserve the secret of his adopted people, Chapman crawls inside his spacesuit, and after once more being exposed to atmospheric gases from Earth, he returns to his normal size.

One of the other gangsters asks Kinta about being the fall guy, which Kinta reluctantly says he is willing to do.  Haruko gets an abortion, and the doctor charges Kinta extra knowing that the Yakuza have money.  A few days later, the body from the boat washes up on the wharf and is found by Kinta\u2019s father.

The boss calls for a celebration, where they drink, play games and cook one of the pigs.

Kinta and a few other gangsters agree to load the pigs on trucks that night and take the money for themselves.  Kinta goes to wait at the pig farm and finds Haruko, and the two agree to run away together after Kinta sells the pigs.  At night, Himori arrives before Kinta\u2019s friends and loads up the pigs on trucks of his own, also beating up Kinta and loading him onto a truck.  Kinta\u2019s friends arrive in time to see Himori leaving and follow them into the downtown.  Himori and Kinta's friends reach an agreement and decide once again to make Kinta the fall guy.  However, Kinta says no this time and uses a rifle he discovered earlier on the truck to ward off the other gangsters.  Tetsuji shows up, having discovered earlier that there was a medical mix-up and that he only has a mild ulcer, and Wang arrives, causing Tetsuji to run away, although he is in no danger because Wang discovered that he was paid in counterfeit money and would therefore not kill the boss.

After becoming progressively unbalanced, she locked herself into an iron maiden, and died after whispering the name \"Sebastian\" one day. Francis refuses to believe Nicholas's story.\nFrancis tells Catherine that Nicholas appears to feel \"definite guilt\" regarding Elizabeth's death. In response, Catherine talks about Nicholas's traumatic childhood. Their father was Sebastian Medina, a notorious agent of the Spanish Inquisition. When Nicholas was a small child, he explored the forbidden torture chamber when his father entered the room with his mother, Isabella, and Sebastian's brother, Bartolome. Hiding in a corner, Nicholas watched in horror as his father repeatedly hit Bartolome with a red-hot poker, screaming \"Adulterer!\" at him. After murdering Bartolome, Sebastian began torturing his wife slowly to death in front of Nicholas.\nDr. Leon later informs Catherine and Francis that Isabella was not tortured to death; instead, she was entombed behind a brick wall while still alive.

As Lohmann wanders through the church, Joe Como engages in a conversation with Mabuse saying he is really Nick Scappio, the representative of the Chicago Syndicate who is there to negotiate a shipment of a new drug into the United States. However, before the Chicago Syndicate will cooperate they demand to see proof of the power of the drug.\nFollowing his only lead, Lohmann goes to obtain further information from the blind witness who is run over and killed. Como and Lohmann pursue the murderer that turns out to be Alberto Sandro who has apparently escaped from the prison. Recapturing him, the prison authorities, who maintain an industrial laundry allowing trusted prisoners to deliver and pick up cleaning in the community, deny Sandro has left the prison. The warden insists Sandro is sedated in his cell. They discover that the person in Sandro's cell is a dead man with a wooden leg who the blind man had identified.\nDr. Mabuse's drug, invented by Maria's scientist father who is a prisoner in the same prison as Sandro, is a mind control device capable of turning a person into a zombie whose actions can be controlled by radio transmissions. Mabuse not only has an army of criminals who can come and go from the prison but can be commanded to do criminal acts that they will have no recollection of later on. In the meantime Lohmann's assistant gets the fingerprints of Como and transmits them to FBI headquarters who declare that the fingerprints of the man calling himself Como is not the real Agent Como. Como/Scappio is sent to the prison. He discovers Dr. Mabuse's display of the power of his drug to the Chicago Syndicate will come on Friday the 13th (the date of the film's premiere); when every prisoner will be injected with the mind control drug, armed with weapons and released in order to launch an armed assault to destroy a nearby nuclear power plant.", "tmdb_plot": "The supposedly dead and buried Mabuse returns to his criminal activities, as his longtime foe Police Inspector Lohmann, a dauntless girl reporter, and an American - who may be an FBI agent, or maybe a Chicago mobster - investigate a series of gruesome murders connected to a maximum security prison and involving a minister who has written a book called \"The Anatomy Of The Devil\".", "tmdb_id": "19129", "wiki_id": "42455702"}, {"title": "Return to Peyton Place", "genres": ["Drama", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "The film takes place some eight to ten years after the events of the original film.\nAllison MacKenzie receives a phone call from publisher Lewis Jackman, who shows interest in publishing her book, promising to turn her into a household name whose books are exclusively bestsellers. Allison is ecstatic after hearing the news. Her best friend Selena Cross, however, continues to receive a lot of criticism from the townspeople for her \"shameful\" past.\nAmong these criticizing her is Mrs. Roberta Carter, an old-fashioned, domineering woman who is unhappy that her son Ted has a close bond with Selena. Later that day, Mrs. Carter is visited by her son, who is in town while visiting from Boston. He surprises her with the shocking news of his having impulsively married a former Italian fashion model, Raffaella. Mrs. Carter looks down on the foreigner and contacts Selena with the couple's news, with the hope that Selena will drive the couple apart. Selena sees through Mrs. Carter's scheme and refuses, angrily leaving and getting herself involved in a car accident. At the accident scene, young ski instructor Nils Larsen helps Selena, and although she initially treats him coldly, she feels attracted to him.\nMeanwhile, Constance reluctantly allows her daughter to visit New York for a meeting with her publisher, Lewis. Allison is unhappy when she finds out that he wants to make changes to her book, but she finally agrees to cooperate. Constance calls the next morning and discovers that Allison and Lewis have been working together all night, so she immediately suspects the worst.\nBack in Peyton Place, Raffaella threatens to ban Ted's mother from their life, if she continues to treat her horribly. Raffaella and Ted go skiing later that day, and Ted is surprised to see Selena with Nils. Selena finally agreed to date him after bumping into him several more times following the accident.\nDuring the following weeks, Allison spends her time promoting her book, doing TV talk shows and radio show interviews. She is slowly turned into a celebrity, and she is continually with Lewis. She is angry after their time together to discover that he is married, but after she receives the first copy of her book, she kisses him. The book soon becomes a commercial success due to its scandalous contents.\nIn Peyton Place the book is heavily criticized by its townspeople. Constance is soon disappointed with Allison for allowing so many changes to be made during the book's editing process. Selena is disgusted by the way she is portrayed in the book. She loses her mind, as a result, and strikes Nils with a fireplace poker, having flashed back to her past trauma and confusing him with Lucas, her abuser.\nMeanwhile, Mike Rossi, principal of the local high school, husband of Constance and the only defender of Allison's book, risks being discharged by the head of the school board, Mrs. Carter, for refusing to remove Allison's book from the school library. At the Carter home, Ted confronts Raffaella about her quarrel with his mother. Realizing that Ted will never stand up to his mother, Raffaella reveals she is pregnant, before angrily leaving him. Determined, now, to terminate her pregnancy, she purposely causes a skiing accident to end it.\nWhen Allison finds out Mike has been fired, she decides to face the wrath of Peyton Place's residents. They are still incensed by their barely disguised fictional counterparts and her book's revelations of the town's many secrets. She is immediately confronted by her mother for having sold her decency and self-respect for success and money. Despite the quarrel with her mother, Allison decides to support Mike, who has taken his case of being fired directly to Peyton Place's town hall.\nAmong the people defending Mike are Lewis, Nils, and Ted. Nils points out that the bigoted townspeople have now driven away Selena, who is nowhere to be found, revealing  his hope to marry her if she ever returns to Peyton Place. Selena returns and blames the small-minded townspeople for making her feel ashamed, while thanking Allison for having written the truth about their hypocrisy. In the end Roberta is denounced and Mike is given back his job after Constance publicly points out that the older, bigoted townspeople have been manipulating the lives of their children for far too long.\nAfterwards, Allison, having emotionally matured and become an adult, breaks off her affair with Lewis, explaining that she does not want to ruin his marriage.

A shabbily dressed mass is clustered in front of the camera, and a pair of hands with a hammer and nails secures one board at a time, until the shot of people has been replaced with a shot of a wall.

Before they were chased out, the manager intervene to explain to the director on site, Ahmad Nisfu, the trio are applying for an audition as actors. The director ordered scripts to be written for the trio and prepares an audition. During their audition, they drive the director crazy by forgetting their scripts and improvising with their own lines. However, the studio boss likes their natural comedic talent and tells the director that the trio are to be signed on for an oncoming film. The three of them are themselves taken by surprise but are nonetheless pleased at the outcome.\nMost of the movie centre around their lives in a house shared with other tenants (they all each rent a room). During their first evening memorising scripts for their new movie, they encounter one disruption after another. First, it was the husband and wife dancing to loud music, then it's the neighbour with the motorcycle problems, then it's the fat drunk trumpeter who is practising his instrument a bit too loudly. After dealing with each problematic neighbour in their own unique way, they then settle down to memorise their lines.\nThe following day, filming begins on their new movie. Despite having learned their lines, they fumble through them and end up infuriating the director so much that he collapses. He is brought to the hospital where he is diagnosed with stress and released. The three bachelors are on hand to visit him with flowers in hand. Initially pleased with the visit, he collapses again when he sees them, the ones who made him collapse in the first place.\nBack at home, they are greeted by Salmah, their next door neighbour, and the object of Ramli's affections. They banter to and fro and then Salmah runs off from the room in tears whilst trying to tell Ramli something. When they meet later that night, Salmah tells Ramli that someone has come to ask for her hand in marriage. When she reveals the person, it is Sharif Dol, a bully from a neighbouring village, who has been harassing Salmah for some time. He then appears at the scene and starts taunting Ramli and Salmah. Ramli tells Salmah to go home whilst he deals with Shariff Dol and challenges him to a fight. Back at the room, both Sudin and Ajis wait for him back at their room with food on the table. Sudin is already hungry but it is their agreement that they always eat together, the three of them. Unwilling to wait for him any more, Sudin wants to go and look for Ramli and they leave their dinner to find Ramli all bruised and passed out at his usual meeting place with Salmah. After settling him down, Sudin brings out some of the dinner that he has brought with him and the three of them enjoy them together.\nThe next day, Salmah and her mother receives a visit from Shariff Dol and his mother. They begin discussing the terms of the wedding and Shariff Dol gives Salmah's mother some money to tide her over until the big day. Salmah keeps silent but shows her disapproval to Shariff Dol from across the room. Later on that day, Sudin and Ajis go on their separate adventures in the evening whilst Ramli and Salmah lament their love for each other. When both of them return, they tell Ramli about their evening whilst he looks on in silence. When asked, he tells them that he wants to marry but doesn't have the money to do so. Sudin then tells him he has the answer for it and produces a 'magic stone' he had purchased earlier in the evening by a roadside seller who assures him that with a little ritual, all his deepest wishes will be fulfilled.

Sudin fails in his attempts to acquire the financial resources Ramli needs for his intended wedding and in fury, Sudin throws the magic stone into the stream. The next scene is of Salmah and her adamant refusal to marry Shariff Dol. She then reveals to her mother that he has been the one harassing her for so long and she has no wish to marry him. Salmah's mother is similarly furious and returns him the money he had given to her. Shariff Dol takes the news in stride but promises revenge for the humiliation he has endured.\nLater on in the evening, Salmah informs Ramli that she has turned Shariff Dol's marriage proposal down once and for all. Ramli is pleased but Salmah wants to proceed with their marriage as they had intended to but Ramli admits to her that he has no finances to support their marriage and wedding. Salmah suggests using her savings instead and they gleefully leave for home together. When they arrive home, they find their house in flames and their neighbours running around in horror.

He is assigned a class of pupils in their last year before leaving school and finds himself in charge of a group of rebellious, badly-behaved teenagers from poor home backgrounds, with no interest in education, who register their defiance of authority by fighting, throwing classroom furniture around, whistling and laughing during bible readings and smoking in class. The school's headmaster Jenkins (Pleasence) is well-meaning but has long become despondent with the seemingly insurmountable challenges posed by his pupils and is resigned to merely serving out his time until retirement. His view that corporal punishment is the only way to maintain even some semblance of order in the classrooms (\"You'll never be able to handle them unless you're as tough as they are\") is anathema to Saunders, who states his intention to try all other methods of discipline rather than resort to physical violence.\nSaunders's teaching colleagues are all resistant to any change in the school's punishment policy, with their attitudes informed either by disillusion and the fear of otherwise losing control of their pupils completely, or in the case of Arthur Gregory (Keen) by a seeming relish for corporal punishment which borders on the sadistic. All share the view that it is useless to try to provide a meaningful education to children whom they have already written off as leaving school only to drift into dead-end jobs, and that the best they can hope to do is to maintain some degree of order in the classroom. Saunders sticks to his principles and starts to make some little headway with his class, although they are baffled by his refusal to rise to provocation and disobedience. He spots particular promise in one of the main trouble-makers, Fred Harkness (O'Sullivan), and tries to encourage the boy to explore his potential. The first time Saunders caned any pupils involved Harkness, though it is revealed in a later scene that it was not Harkness's fault: in fact, he was trying to prevent several other pupils from rioting. When Saunders offers him a handshake and an apology at the end of the scene, Harkness refuses and marches out of the room, all trust between them broken.\nMatters come to a head when as a prank the pupils lock Gregory in the school toilets overnight. The following morning Gregory seeks revenge on those he considers to be the ringleaders, singling Harkness out for punishment.

On board, they meet the ship's cook Clodion, and Paparanic's pet parrot Romulus. A businessman named Anton Karabine (Demetrios Myrat) arrives and says he is an old friend of the Captain's shipmate. He offers them a \"sentimental\" Priceline for the ship. And they give Captain Haddock fifteen days to think it over.  \nWhile touring Istanbul, there are several attempts on their lives, and determined to find out what is going on Haddock decides to keep the ship. One of the clauses of Paparanic's will was that on accepting the ship, they also fulfill its current obligations so after hiring 3 crewmen - Angorapoulos, Attila and Yefima, they set off for Athens to deliver the cargo. During the journey Tintin catches Angorapoulos (Marcel Bozzuffi) searching through the papers Tintin found. Tintin beats him up, and locks him in a room. But then later, they find that one of the lifeboats has gone, and Anorapoulos escaped.\nIn Athens, Tintin and Haddock go to the carpet seller Midas Papos (Dar\u00edo Moreno), who turns out to be another of Paparanic's old shipmates. Grief-stricken to learn of his friend's death, he is shot by a man through the window before he can relate any information. Caught holding the gun, Tintin and Haddock are arrested but released thanks to the arrival of the policemen Thomson and Thompson, and on Papos' word, who is alive and recovering in hospital.\nTintin finds an old newspaper article showing that in their youth, Paparanic, Papos, Karabine, plus two strangers, were adventurers who were involved in a coup in the Latin American republic of Tetaragua, and formed a short-lived government. The article includes a photo of the five men.\nTintin later spots Angorapoulos in a barber's shop and follows him to the local offices of Karexport, which is run by Karabine. Trailing him by car, Tintin, Snowy and Haddock follow him to a village in the countryside where Angorapoulous and some accomplices kidnap a musician at a wedding. Chasing them on a motorbike, the crooks' car is forced off the road, and the villains flee on foot. Saving the kidnap victim, Scoubidouvitch (Dimos Starenios), he is revealed as the fourth man in the photo. He suffers from \"memory loss\", but for 1000 drachmas reveals that a large amount of gold is involved, and suggests that Tintin and Haddock consult the fifth man in the photo, Alexandre (Charles Vanel) who now lives in a monastery in Meteora.\nTravelling there, they find the former adventurer is now Father Alexandre, as he has repented and become a monk. He reveals the rest of the Tetaragua story: when forced out, they'd taken a large quantity of gold from the central bank, and that Captain Paparanic had kept half while the others split the rest. Before departing, Father Alexandre gives Tintin and Haddock a bottle of wine which Paparanic gave him while visiting him last Christmas, and told him to drink only after his death. When Haddock accidentally breaks the bottle, the label is discovered to be a map to the location of Paparanic's gold.\nTintin and Haddock return to the Golden Fleece, where Professor Cuthbert Calculus has arrived to join them. Secretly, Yefima drains the fuel to prevent the ship from leaving port, but Tintin discovers him and throws him overboard in another bout of judo. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a special tablet called \"Super-Cuthbertoleum\" which, mixed with the remaining fuel, is more than enough to enable the ship to reach their destination, the island of Thassika.\nThe map includes an X just off the island's coast and, using his pendulum, Calculus locates the gold's location. Diving underwater, Tintin discovers a sea-chest filled with long, oddly shaped bars of gold. No sooner have the members of the Golden Fleece got the chest out of the water that they are held at gunpoint by Karabine, Angorapoulos, Yefima and their men who'd snuck aboard. Haddock gets caught up in a fishing net, Snowy gets tied up and Tintin is shot at and falls back into the water, left for dead. The companions are locked in a cabin, and explosives placed to blow up the ship.\nKarabine and his men take the chest back to their helicopter only to come under attack by the police, including Thomson and Thompson, led by Attila who is revealed to be an undercover police officer. Karabine gets aboard the helicopter, which suddenly takes off; Tintin has dispatched the pilot and is flying. Karabine pulls a gun, but Tintin disarms him. Beaten, the crook declares that no-one will get the gold, opens a hatch and lets the chest fall into the sea. \nThe rest of the gang surrender to the police.

Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old local Fr\u00e4ulein Karin Steinhof (Christine Kaufmann) has a quarrel with her 19-year-old boyfriend, Frank Borgmann (Gerhart Lippert), on the banks of the same river. She swims back to her starting point, lights up a cigarette and strips out of her wet bikini when she is confronted by Sergeant Chuck Snyder (Frank Sutton) and gang-raped by him, Corporal Birdwell Scott (Richard Jaeckel), Private Joey Haines (Mal Sondock), and Corporal Jim Larkin (Robert Blake). (A blatant production error can be seen in the film during the rape scene when a body double substitutes for Kaufmann; the \"victim\" has short, fluffy dry hair in contrast to Kaufmann's long, straight, wet hair.) Borgmann hears her screams for help and swims across the river to help her, but he is knocked out by Snyder. After three of the men start to leave the scene, the guilt-ridden Larkin lingers behind; he covers Steinhof with his shirt before he finally flees with the other three men.\nThe men are quickly apprehended. To appease the anger and outrage of the Germans, Major General Stafford, the division commanding general, orders that their court martial be held in public in the local high school gymnasium. The prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Pakenham (E. G. Marshall), seeks the death penalty. Major Steve Garrett (Kirk Douglas) is assigned to defend the accused rapists. After interviewing his clients, Garrett tries to plea bargain for long sentences at hard labor, but Pakenham feels he has a strong case. Garrett starts investigating, questioning the residents. He is followed by Inge Koerner (Barbara R\u00fctting), a hostile German reporter from what Garrett considers to be a scandal-seeking newspaper.\nAt the start of the trial, three of the men plead not guilty. Larkin tries to enter a plea of guilty but is overruled by Garrett. Garrett produces an army psychiatrist who had been treating Larkin before the incident. The witness testifies that Larkin is impotent for psychological reasons. Larkin violently denies it and has to be forcibly removed from the courtroom. After the first day, Garrett pleads with Karin's bank manager father, Karl Steinhof (Hans Nielsen), to withdraw her from the trial before it is too late, stating that he will have to break her down on the stand to save his clients. He advises Herr Steinhof to take his family and leave town, but Steinhof refuses.\nAs the lead defense counsel, Garrett has no choice but to show that Karin is not as innocent as she first appeared, nor is she well liked. He also destroys the credibility of Steinhof and Borgmann by catching them in pointless little lies. As Garrett continues his cross-examination of Karin, she eventually collapses under the strain. Her father withdraws her from the trial; this action ensures that the defendants cannot be executed. The four men are convicted of rape. Three are sentenced to long terms at hard labor, and Larkin is given a shorter sentence of six years. The damage has been done, however, and the townsfolk turn against Karin.\nThough Frank Borgmann attacks him with a whip, Garrett tells him to take Karin and leave town forever. The young man takes his advice, but to raise money, he forges his mother's signature on a check. Determined to keep her son under her control, she sends the police after the couple.

Seaview is designed and built by scientist and engineering genius Admiral Harriman Nelson (USN-Ret). Captain Lee Crane  is the submarine's Commanding Officer. One of the on-board observers is Dr. Susan Hiller, studying crew-related stress. The mission includes being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap. The polar ice suddenly begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size pieces sinking into the ocean around the submerged submarine (no explanation is given as to why the ice sinks). Surfacing, they discover the sky is on fire. After rescuing scientist Miguel Alvarez and his dog at Ice Floe Delta, Seaview receives a radio message from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the Bureau of Marine Exploration. He reports that a meteor shower has pierced the Van Allen radiation belt, causing it to catch on fire, resulting in a deadly increase in the global temperature. Nelson's on-board friend and scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emery, concurs it is possible.\nThe President summons Admiral Nelson to a UN Emergency Scientific meeting. Nelson and Commodore Emery have devised a plan to end the catastrophe. Seaview arrives in New York Harbor two days later. Nelson informs the UN that, according to their calculations, if the increasing temperature is not stopped, it will become irreversible and the Earth will die in about three weeks. The Admiral and the Commander propose extinguishing the fire by launching a nuclear missile at the burning belt from the Mariana Islands. A nuclear explosion should overwhelm and extinguish the flames, \"amputating\" the belt from the Earth. Seaview has the capability of firing the missile. The chief scientist and head delegate, Vienna's Emilio Zucco rejects the Admiral's plan as too risky. He believes the composition of the belt's gasses will cause the fire to soon burn itself out when reaching 173 degrees. Nelson disagrees with Zucco's theory, claiming that his estimated burn-out point is incorrect. Nelson and Emery's plan is rejected. The Admiral and the Commodore quickly leave the proceedings intending to get authorization directly from the President himself.\nThe Seaview races to reach the optimal firing position above the Pacific Ocean's Marianas trench in time for the needed angle of trajectory. Nelson and Crane attempt tapping the Rio-to-London telephone cable in an attempt to reach the President. During the cable tapping attempt, Crane and Alvarez battle a giant squid. They can only tap into the London cable, and Nelson learns there has been no contact with the U.S. for 35 hours.\nAn unsuccessful attempt on the Admiral's life indicates a saboteur is aboard. The rescued scientist, Miguel Alvarez, a religious zealot regarding the catastrophe, is the suspected saboteur. Dr. Hiller, who privately supports Dr Zucco's plan, is another suspect.\nOther obstacles present themselves. The Seaview's main generator is sabotaged by a crew member who lost his mind, forcing Nelson to order Crane to proceed while repairs are made despite the risk of proceeding without power for the sonar and radar. As a result, the sub narrowly escapes a minefield left over from World War II. The crew are near-mutiny, to the point that when the Seaview encounters a motor ship whose crew is dead, Captain Crane and the Admiral allow any crew members who wish to leave rather than continue the mission to leave the sub and sail the derelict home.\nCrane begins doubting the Admiral's tactics and reasoning.  A hostile, unidentified submarine pursues them, diving deep into the Mariana Trench, exceeding its crush depth; the sub implodes before it can destroy Seaview.\nThe saboteur has shut down the sub's power. Crane encounters Dr Hiller, the saboteur, atop the shark tank, as she exits the restricted nuclear reactor core. Her radiation detector badge has turned red, showing she has been exposed to a fatal dose. When asked why, she says to prevent the sub from reaching its target. Suddenly an explosion rocks the sub, throwing Dr. Hiller into the shark tank. She is killed by the sharks.\nSeaview reaches the Mariana Islands in time to carry out the Admiral's plan. He learns that temperatures are rising faster than projected, proving Zucco's theory is incorrect. Alvarez, believing it is God's will for the Earth to be destroyed, attempts to sabotage the mission by threatening to explode a bomb. The nuclear missile is launched toward the belt by Captain Crane, who launches the nuclear missile from outside the sub before Alvarez is aware.
