They travel to San Francisco and kill Henry Wong, a former associate. SFPD Inspector Jack Cates, accompanied by Detectives Algren and Van Zant, trace Ganz and Bear to a hotel, where they've checked in under aliases. Ganz and Bear ambush the officers. In the ensuing shootout, Ganz kills Algren and Van Zant, and escapes with Billy, taking Jack's service revolver.\nArmed with a replacement pistol, Jack tracks down Ganz's former partner-in-crime Reggie Hammond, who is in prison with six months to go on a three-year sentence for armed robbery. After a memorable first meeting in prison, Jack manages to get Reggie a 48-hour release in to his custody so that Reggie can help Jack find Ganz and Bear. Reggie leads Jack to an apartment where Ganz's last remaining associate Luther Kelly lives. When Jack looks around, Luther shoots at him and refuses to be interrogated, so Jack arrests Luther. \nThat night, Reggie leads Jack to Torchy's, a redneck hangout where Billy used to be a bartender. Reggie, on a challenge from Jack, shakes the bar down using Jack's badge, single-handedly bringing the crowd under his control. They get a lead on Billy's old girlfriend, but get nothing out of her, as the girlfriend says she threw Billy out. After tensions between the two men finally erupt into a fistfight that is stopped by a pair of patrol officers, Reggie finally confesses that he, Ganz, Bear, Luther and Wong had robbed a drug dealer of $500,000 some years earlier and that the money was (and remains) stashed in the trunk of Reggie's car in a downtown parking garage. Instead of splitting the cash, Ganz sold Reggie out, resulting in his incarceration. It was also the reason why Ganz and Billy took Luther's girlfriend Rosalie: they wanted Luther to get Reggie's money in exchange for her safe return.\nHowever, Luther goes and gets the car, and Jack and Reggie tail him to a Muni station where Ganz comes to get the money. Luther, however, recognizes Jack, and Ganz and Billy escape, while Reggie chases after Luther. Left with nothing, Jack ends up going back to the police station and waits for Reggie to call. Jack goes to a nightclub in the Fillmore District, to find Reggie, who has tracked Luther to a hotel across the street. Jack, humbled, apologizes for continuously berating and insulting Reggie. He lends Reggie some money to pay for a hotel room to have sex with a girl he's met, but as Reggie leaves the club with her, he sees Luther leave the hotel. Luther gets onto a stolen bus driven by Billy and hands over the money to Ganz, who shoots Luther and presumably Rosalie. Ganz spots Jack and Reggie following them, and a car chase/gunfight ensues, which ends when Billy forces Jack's Cadillac through the window of a Cadillac showroom.  At this point following a heated verbal thrashing from Jack's superior Haden, Jack and Reggie are ready to resign themselves to the fact that they failed to catch Ganz.\nAt a local bar, Jack wonders if Billy might go back to see his girl and use her place as a hideout. Jack and Reggie force their way inside and after a brief confrontation Reggie shoots Billy. Ganz escapes into a maze of alleyways, capturing Reggie. Jack approaches and shoots  Ganz in the shoulder, throwing Reggie off him. Ganz then charges at Jack but Jack shoots him repeatedly, killing him. Finally, Jack takes Reggie to go see the girl he had met earlier in Fillmore. Jack leaves the money in Reggie's car, but asks for a loan to buy a convertible when Reggie is released, to which Reggie agrees. Jack gives Reggie a stern warning about changing his ways once he's released, and Reggie agrees to do so, while half attempting to steal Jack's lighter.

On the train Jo meets young Simon Rosenblum (Ferrache), the grandson of aforementioned First Lieutenant Rosenblum and a Jew, and a beautiful reporter named Gaby Delcourt (Pisier), who is to interview Hitler. When his grandfather doesn't show up at the station, Simon asks Jo, whom he idolizes for his World War I days, to accompany him to his grandfather's bookstore. Arriving there, Jo gets into a fight with Gestapo agents who are demolishing the place, and subsequently he is asked by the whole Rosenblum family to hide them. Knowing no other place, he takes them to his team's hotel, which also happens to be Gaby's domicile.

On the way through the forest lurks Likho, a one-eyed evil and makes him fall but does not pursue him further. Baba Yaga's neighbor, the swamp Kikimora, soon arrives, and together they gaze in the magic dish and observe what is going on in the Tsarist kingdom. The good Tsar Makar suffers from the strict rules imposed on him; he would like to clean the floor or even drive the manure wagon, but the strict scribe Chumichka does not allow him that. At the meeting with the Council of the Tsar, the Tsar learns that the wise Vasilisa has sent him a magic ball as a gift, but Chumichka denies that such a gift has arrived. The magic ball is found in the scribe's hat, which causes him to be thrown out of town for theft. He vows to free Koschei the Immortal in revenge against the Tsar. The image of the magic dish turns red, because a three-headed dragon has awakened, thus cutting the connection. Mitya and Baba Yaga decide to tell the Tsar about the scribe's plan and travel to the Tsar kingdom on a magic stove - without any water supply, as Mitya accidentally filled goat's water into the drinking bottle, which turns every drinker into a goat.\nIn the meantime, the scribe frees Koschei who is trapped in jail, gives him twelve buckets of water through which he regains his strength, and then guides him back into jail. Koschei can win over all the servants of the Tsar by duplicitous speeches for himself and finally receives the Tsar's crown. Tsar Makar is captured and Baba Yaga who rushed to the scene is also thrown into prison. Mitya receives the magic ball from Makar, which should lead him directly to the wise Vasilisa, who should advice him. In the meantime, the greatest criminals of the tsarist empire, who are friends of Koschei, including Likho, Nightingale the Robber, and the three-headed dragon, arrive at the court.\nMitya arrives to the wise Vasilisa, who gives him a cap of invisibility, with the help of which he can enter the castle unrecognized and also free the prisoners. Vasilisa's Domovoy, house-spirit, meanwhile, makes his way to the beach, where the death of the allegedly immortal Koschei is supposed to be hidden: According to tradition, he is in a duck, which is in a bear, which in turn is in a box on a tree. Mitya can instigate strife between the guards of Koschei and free Baba Yaga in the castle, but is locked up in jail by the scribe Chumichka together with the Tsar. Both are to be thrown to the three-headed dragon for feeding, but the Tsar manages to administer goat water to the dragon, so that he becomes a three-headed goat. Baba Yaga meanwhile flies under the radar of the guards by using the cloak of invisibility and they all return to wise Vasilisa. Here, too, Domovoy has returned from his journey to the beach and cursing the inaccurate transmission about the death of Koschei. He was not hidden directly in the duck, but in a needle that was in the egg in the duck. Although the Domovoy could destroy the egg transformed as a hawk, the needle had fallen into a haystack and is untraceable. Mitya gets a pair of scissors and rides his bike to the haystack to catch the needle with his scissors ready. Between Koschei and his mischief and Vasilisa and her followers, there is a fight at a bridge that ends with Koschei fleeing. He is chased by Vasilisa's warriors, but proves to be too strong. Only when Mitya finds the needle with the help of the pair of scissors and extinguishes its glowing head does Koschei lose his strength and can be captured.\nMitya gives Baba Yaga the now normal needle.

After Daniel starts to notice Max's character is changing, Max eavesdrops on the doctor's report that Max's growing insubordinate behavior could lead to a revolt similar to an incident back on Earth known as the \"Munich Rebellion\", after which androids were outlawed. However, Daniel is illegally working on another android, Cassandra One, intended to be a superior machine and which has the form of a human female.\nMax receives a distress call from a ship that seeks repairs. Upon hearing the pilot's female voice, Max excitedly permits them to land, not realizing that the ship is a prison transport and that the pilot, Maggie, and her associates, Keller and Mendes, are all escaped fugitives. Once aboard the station, the convicts settle in, posing as the transport's crew (who had actually been killed during the prison break). Daniel becomes infuriated upon learning that Max allowed the ship to land and demands they leave immediately, but after meeting the attractive Maggie, Daniel invites her to have dinner.\nMaggie joins Daniel but the dinner goes wrong when a jealous Max pranks the doctor with some embarrassing mischief, such as metal shot in the wine bottle, and cutting the doctor's orchids.

He searches for him and finds him in a room of spare android parts. Mendes states there are enough parts to build an android of their own, but Keller attacks him from behind. The two struggle, but Keller is overpowered and Mendes kills him with a blow to the head.\nEventually Max arrives, suitcase in hand, at Maggie's quarters, but finds her dead. Max returns to Daniel's lab, where the doctor is already aware of the murder and has locked Mendes in the guest lounge. Daniel has Max sit in a chair and opens a panel on the back of his head to reprogram him for a new task, during which he tells Max that murder must be punished and Mendes is to blame.

Harlock is embarking on what is to be the magnum opus of his long career, the traversing of the Owen Stanley Mountains in New Guinea. His major obstacle is the phantom of the witch that haunts these mountains. In a last desperate attempt to cross the mountains, Harlock ditches all but ten minutes of fuel in order to gain altitude. He carries on to his fate, amidst the mocking laughter of the Owen Stanley Witch.\nNear the end of World War II, Phantom F. Harlock II is an Iron Cross-wearing German fighter pilot that flies a Messerschmitt Bf 109. During a major defeat for his side, he meets Tochiro Oyama, a Japanese exchange technician working in Germany. Tochiro's project is to design a new gun sight for use in fighter planes. Harlock's most treasured possession is the Revi C-12D gun sight which he calls his \"eye\". Both men believe the war to be wasteful and pointless and Tochiro especially hopes that the rockets being developed by Germany may one day lead to a more positive application, such as a trip to the moon. Tochiro wishes he could escape from the war and possibly go to neutral Switzerland where he might be able to fulfill his dream. Harlock offers to take him in his plane. Stowing Tochiro in the plane's fuselage, Harlock is able to fly to Switzerland, but only after surviving a fierce aerial dogfight which disables his plane and forces him to crash land just short of the Swiss border. Carrying an injured Tochiro across the river to sanctuary, Harlock departs, giving Tochiro his Revi C-12D, before crossing back into the warzone where Harlock expects to face the consequences of his actions. Although this Harlock's ultimate fate is unknown, Tochiro pledges friendship between their two bloodlines for all eternity.\nAt some time in the late 30th century (circa 2960s), a Solar Federation officer named Captain Harlock returns home in his battle cruiser Deathshadow to find that aliens from the Illumidus Empire have conquered Earth and enslaved humanity. However the remaining humans blame him and other warriors like him as they were not there to protect the planet when they needed it. Harlock, along with the Tokargans who are ashamed of their role in Earth's downfall, sets out to lead a resistance against the aliens and adopts the fighting strategy of ancient marauders. During the course of the struggle, Harlock meets a former Solar Federation engineer; a Japanese man who he's never met before but feels he knows. This man, Tochiro Oyama reveals his secret project, the dreams of all his ancestors. Hidden in a deep cavern under the occupation headquarters is a space battleship that he designed and built. This ship is called Arcadia, in honor of the eternal friendship forged between Phantom F. Harlock and Tochiro Oyama during another ancient war.\nHarlock also meets Emeraldas, an old friend, who immediately offers herself to the cause. The Tokargans, after witnessing the death of the last female of their race, sacrifice themselves to save the Arcadia from the life sucking flames of the Flame Stream Prominence (aka the Owen Stanley Witch of Space).

The movie opens in the mid sixties when the Naxalbari uprising is spreading across Bengal and oppressed farmers are being united by youths who believe in communism and a socialist republic.\nHari and his brother Bolai (Noni Ganguly) are Borgadars, land tillers who plough and harvest the crop on land owned by Jotdars. Bibhutibhushan Ganguly (Victor Banerjee) is the young jotdar who has just lost his father and now wishes to employ new laws on his Borgadars ensuring his greatest profit while the poor farmer languishes in poverty. His estate agent Karmakar (Rajen Tarafdar) does most of his dirty dealings on his behalf that include keeping the poor villagers scared and him in command. Hari's sister is about to get married and Hari asks Bibhutibhushan for a loan. Bibhutibhushan asks him to not register his Bargadari rights under the government office in exchange. Hari is naive and moulded under generations of servility and oppression to realise that his basic rights are being squandered, although his younger brother Bolai isn't happy remaining as mere servants to the landlord. Bolai protests on multiple occasions only to be reprimanded by his brother and Karmakar. Bolai and Panchi (Sreela Majumdar) love each other.\nOver time, as the communist movement gets stronger in the region, Hari Mandal is oppressed under whims and fancies of the Jotdar, that include making him a paid labourer on his own plot of land and sacking his brother from working with him. Bolai is disgusted with the village life and moves to the big city of Calcutta for work. Here, he joins a small-time racket of wagon breakers and eventually becomes a political goon for the city's electoral candidates. Panchi and her mother both move to Calcutta with help from strangers who offer them employment. While Kalidashi gets employed in a middle-class home as the cook and servant for a meager salary, her daughter is trapped with the bait of fancy clothes by a pimp employed by a middle aged Marwari businessman who makes her his mistress. Panchi also seems to enjoy her new life and the luxuries of cosmetics, silk sarees and a huge bed to sleep on. In a poignant scene, before bedding her for the first time, the businessman asks her whether she has ever slept on a bed before.\nHari fights his battles alone against the Jotdar and eventually registers a case against him in the district court with help from sympathetic village master (Pankaj Kapoor) and a lawyer who fights his case for free. Although the district magistrate (Jayant Kripalani) is sympathetic and just in his dealing to his cause, the Jotdar uses his muscle to beat up Hari, burn down his house and take away his bullocks thus leaving him helpless to fight.\nHari presses on and the case reaches the High Court where his case it is in favour of the Jotdar. Meanwhile, the first leftist communist government is established in Bengal and after years of court battle and a Panchayat election where Hari defeats Karmakar to become the village Panch, he receives his Bargadari certificate\u2014at the cost of a broken leg, a house, and a brother who is lost forever.\nHari comes to look for Bolai in the great metropolis of Calcutta and searches for him fruitlessly before going back to his village. He never gets to know what has happened of his people who came to Calcutta. The audience gets to know that Bolai gets life imprisonment for committing a political murder, Panchi is thrown out of her Sethji's flat when she gets pregnant and is forced to abort the baby and her health deteriorates, she goes into shock and becomes insane and is living on the streets, and Kalidashi dies while working in her master's house, presumably over a broken heart at her daughter's condition, having seen her both as a mistress and a vagabond on the road.

Early into his flight he is met by the outlaw Barbarosa, who, seconds later, kills a man who was following him, whom he seems to know. Barbarosa takes pity on Karl and shows him how to find water, make a fire, and catch an armadillo for his supper. He leaves and tells Karl to go home to Texas.\nKarl makes his way to a small pueblo and finds a grubby cantina. Barbarosa bursts in and robs everyone at gunpoint. Filling his sombrero with loot, Barbarosa instructs Karl to gather the rest, and steals away. Karl escapes, and Barbarosa and he ride together for the winter while Karl learns the life of an outlaw adventurer.\nKarl is being pursued by Floyd and Otto Pahmeyer, the brothers of the man he killed, sent by their vengeful father. Karl and Barbarosa easily get the drop on them. To Barbarosa's disgust, Karl leaves them alive and tells them to go home. They say they cannot, being more afraid of their father than the bandidos. They hike off to replace their guns and resume the chase.\nThe bandidos encounter a poor old couple with a burro, and Karl refuses to rob them. Barbarosa and Karl are then captured by the outlaw Angel Morales and his gang, and as Angel is debating what to do with them, the old couple, Angel's parents, arrive in camp and tell Angel that Barbarosa wanted to rob them, but Karl wanted to spare them. The enraged Angel shoots Barbarosa in the belly. He spares Karl's life for restraining Barbarosa from robbing his parents, but sets him to digging Barbarosa's grave. While digging Barbarosa's grave, it is discovered that he isn't really dead. Barbarosa scuttles off into the brush when no one is looking, and Karl quickly fills in the empty grave.\nAngel's gang capture the hapless Floyd and Otto, and Angel shoots them on a whim, again setting Karl to dig the graves. But in the morning, a stuporous Angel struggles awake to find himself buried to the neck in the desert sand, with the dead heads of Floyd and Otto surrounding him. Terrified, he screams fruitlessly for help and for the author of his demise, \"Barbaroooooosaaaaaaa!\"\nEven outlaws must have someplace to call home, it seems. Barbarosa has an ongoing love-hate relationship with the Zavala family. He brings his accumulated loot every few months when he visits his loyal wife, Josefina de Zavala, who lives at the hacienda of her father, Don Braulio Zavala. Intensely bitter, Don Braulio hates Barbarosa for crippling him and killing his son in a drunken fracas, and every few years he sends another young Zavala son, nephew, or cousin to kill Barbarosa; none has yet succeeded, and most have been themselves killed in the attempt. Don Braulio's tales, stylized and heavy with symbolism, spur the young Zavalas to their best efforts to be worthy of such an adversary, and the Zavalas have become rich and powerful thereby. The songs recounting Barbarosa's exploits become longer and more celebratory each year, and recent verses also recount the adventures of Barbarosa's new sidekick, the \"Gringo Child.\"  Yet the chorus between every verse exhorts \"all you men of courage to grease up your guns and knives . . . this is the part where they kill Barbarosa.\"\nBarbarosa and Josefina have a nubile daughter, Juanita, who decides she likes the Gringo Child and hides Karl from searchers in her bed. Interrupted by her parents, Karl is kicked into the plaza by the enraged Barbarosa; the ruckus raises Don Braulio and the household, who rush to the plaza, guns blazing. Barbarosa twirls his Appaloosa horse in the gate, whooping, displaying his horsemanship and courage, and the bandidos escape at a gallop amid a hail of bloodless gun play. And when Karl too shows some backbone, telling Barbarosa that he liked Juanita and intends to visit her again, Barbarosa smiles and says that's fine with him.\nIn the spring, Barbarosa and Karl decide to return to Texas. Climbing out of the Rio Grande canyon, Karl attempts to lend Barbarosa a hand up the final ledge. Karl is hampered by the saddlebags he is holding, so Barbarosa says \"Get rid of that!\" To which Karl flings the saddlebags (containing the loot) back over the cliff. Terminally disgusted, Barbarosa yells at him, \"I didn't say throw the MONEY down THERE!  I've BEEN down THERE!!!\". Karl makes the arduous climb back down the cliff. He disturbs a rattlesnake and falls into the river. When Karl struggles back to the canyon rim that evening he finds Barbarosa waiting beside a campfire. He dumps the saddlebags of money at Barbarosa's feet, but Barbarosa is still peeved: \"Bet you didn't bring an armadillo for my supper!\"  But Karl reveals his other hand from behind his back, tossing a dead armadillo into Barbarosa's lap. Both look at each other and laugh; Karl is learning, and starting to give as good as he gets.\nBarbarosa and Karl come to the Texas Hill Country and the German immigrant colony where Karl grew up, and ride into a stockmen's rendezvous. While enjoying eating barbecue and watching horse races, Karl mentions that horses are something he knows about and considers buying some broncos to take home to his father's farm. Suddenly a shot rings out \u2014 it is old Mr. Pahmeyer, still seeking to kill Karl for the death of his sons. In his rage, he misses. Karl covers him with his revolver and makes him stop trying to reload. \"Go home, Mr. Pahmeyer. Just go home!\" he orders, and Mr. Pahmeyer has no choice but to obey.\nKarl buys his horses, but Barbarosa declines to accompany him back to lawful living. \"To tell the truth, I'm worn out keeping you amused,\" he grumbles. The two part ways as friends.\nKarl drives his herd to the farm and finds the farm very run down, his mother dead, himself given up for dead, and his father, Emile and his sister Hilda, despondent. He cheers them up, telling them that he \"had a little luck down in Mexico -- me and another fellow.\"  Next morning Emile steps outside to inspect \"our horses.\"  \"OUR horses?\" jokes Karl. \"You'd best break a few before it's 'OUR horses'!\", and Hilda laughs with them. But their laughter turns to screams as Mr. Pahmeyer takes another potshot from the woods, again missing Karl but killing his father.\nKarl goes alone to the Pahmeyer farmhouse, calling Mr. Pahmeyer to come out and end the feud. Mr. Pahmeyer calls back that he is sorry about killing Emile, that he never intended to do that. Karl calls back that he knows that, and again offers to end the feud. But despite the cries of his wife, Mr. Pahmeyer calls, \"I don't think I can do it!\" and charges out the door with his gun. Howling, \"NOOOOO!\", Karl is forced to kill him.\nKarl and Barbarosa reunite after some time (Karl's beard and hair have grown out). During a brief split, Karl aids Barbarosa in evading Eduardo Zavala, the most recent young would-be killer sent out by Don Braulio. Without Barbarosa's knowledge, he disarms Eduardo and strips him of his guns, his horse, and his boots. \"WALK home! Git!\" he orders Eduardo.\nBut Eduardo is made of sterner stuff than his predecessors. He hones his silver crucifix down to a dagger point, wraps his feet in rawhide thongs, and stalks Barbarosa on foot. He leaps upon Barbarosa from ambush and stabs him in the belly, then flees to the south.\nAs Karl sits with his dying friend, they discuss Barbarosa's life and death. \"A man couldn't ask for better than what I had with the Zavalas,\" Barbarosa says. And then, \"The little bastard's going back to tell everyone Barbarosa's dead. Barbarosa can't die!\"  Karl realizes, \"He's afoot!\" and may be caught before he gets back to the Zavala hacienda.\nKarl cremates Barbarosa's body, and pursues Eduardo at the gallop. But Eduardo has learned, and knocks Karl out by hitting him with a branch. Taking Karl's horse, Eduardo makes it back to the hacienda and is greeted as a hero. A fiesta is planned in his honor.\nKarl sits beside a campfire, defeated, nursing his headache. There is a rustle in the brush, and out comes Barbarosa's Appaloosa, with Barbarosa's saddle and enormous sombrero. Karl perks up.\nThe fiesta at the Zavala hacienda is the most funereal party imaginable. Don Braulio, Josefina and Jaunita look lost and bereft. The rest of the clan dances while contemplating directionless life without a Barbarosa to fight. Out of the night gallops a red-bearded man in an enormous sombrero on an Appaloosa, whooping and twirling and shooting up the sky. As Eduardo is about to be presented a black wreath of honor, Karl aims and shoots the wreath just before it is placed on his head. The Zavalas shout, \"Barbarosa!  Barbarosa!

The group are made to run in public in nothing but their underwear and sneakers. Ronnie (Ricky Sandico) is made to drink beer laced with his batchmates' spit at a birthday party. A doctor, who is an AKO alum, attaches surgical equipment on Sid as a pain-tolerance experience. Sid's love interest, Mariel (Bing Pimentel), expresses concern for his safety, revealing that she lost her brother in a frat initiation rite two years before.\nThe physical and psychological pressures take its toll on neophytes Arni (Rod Leido) and Ronnie, both of whom decide to leave. When senior Vince discovers this, he has Ronnie tied to an electric chair for the rest of the batch to witness.

The regions around the oil producing Mesopotamia Basin are largely radioactive wastelands due to limited nuclear exchange; oil fields in Saudi Arabia and most of the Middle East burn out of control. Food riots have become common in many cities around the world which are now under martial law. Much of the American rural countryside has become lawless with the majority of remaining military and police trying to maintain order in the cities. Large groups of citizens are fleeing cities to the countryside to find food and any remaining fuel reserves. What little petroleum remains in these regions has become a precious commodity fought over by vicious warlords and mercenaries. A war party led by former U.S. Army Colonel Jacob Straker (James Wainwright), traveling in a large, heavily armed, armored truck, intercept two traders riding in a horse-drawn carriage with large amount of diesel fuel, killing one of the traders. The surviving trader takes the war party to the source, which is a hidden supply depot lost during the local government's collapse and thought to be radioactive. Straker orders his men to setup camp to use the supply depot as a base of operations.\nStraker's daughter Coraline \"Corlie\" (Annie McEnroe) refuses to execute the surviving trader. While Straker plans the camp's defense at night, she runs away and flees through the open desert. Corlie is saved from a squad of men sent to return her to the camp by Hunter (Michael Beck), an ex-soldier armed with a high-tech motorbike. Corlie lies about her past and claims she was a hostage taken after her family died. Needing further medical attention for a leg injury, Hunter takes Corlie to live in the walled city of Clearwater Farm, governed as a strict old-fashioned democracy, where she is quickly accepted by the community. However, she is soon discovered by her father's men who take over the Clearwater community to feed Straker's war party.  Corlie steals a horse and manages to escape back to Hunter's remote farm in the woods.\nThe mercenaries terrorize and pillage the community. Straker tortures the resident mechanic Rusty (John Ratzenberger) into giving him the location of Hunter's secret hideout. Straker moves to attack Hunter's farm and recapture Corlie. Hunter and Corlie escape on his motorbike and Straker, in a rage, plows through Hunter's residence with his armored truck. Hunter takes Corlie back to the Clearwater people and asks Rusty to build him an armored car to attack Straker's \"battletruck\".  While Rusty and Hunter and a few others are thus occupied, one of the residents turns traitor and knocks out Corlie, puts her in a horse-drawn wagon, and heads out to deliver her back to Straker. Hunter tries to stop him, but the traitor sets an ambush for him and wounds him with a crossbow.  Believing that he has killed Hunter, the traitor appears at Straker's headquarters with Corlie in the wagon.\nMeanwhile, Hunter regains consciousness and manages to limp back to Clearwater on his bike. While getting patched up there, Rusty finishes the armored car and shortly Hunter takes off in it, despite the fact that he is wounded.  He attacks Straker's headquarters, plowing through buildings and tents and eventually dropping a grenade into Straker's 50,000 liter diesel fuel supply, destroying the fuel. He then runs and Straker, now in a towering rage, takes off after him. In the process, he forces the driver to drive the truck at a higher speed, overheating the turbines. This stresses out the driver (who loves the truck) and leads to dissension between him and Straker. Hunter, meanwhile, gets some distance ahead, jumps out of the car and climbs to a high place overlooking the road and it is now revealed that the whole attack on Straker's headquarters was a ruse to lure the truck into an ambush. The Clearwater people are at a overlooking ridge waiting for Hunter with his motorcycle and a 66mm rocket launcher which Hunter had given them earlier in the film. Hunter fires a couple of armor-piercing rockets at the moving truck, but only one round hits which causes slight damage and a small fire, which causes more stress between Straker and the truck driver. The driver attempts to kill Straker, who he feels is uselessly destroying the truck. Straker kills the driver who slumps over the wheel and now the truck, throttle set to full, is more or less out of control.\nBack on the motorbike again, Hunter manages to jump onto the moving truck through a hole in the top that one of his rockets had made. A battle ensues, the truck still careening wildly back and forth while Corlie tries to control it with the dead body of the driver slumped over the wheel and Straker furiously shouting commands to everyone. Eventually, Hunter fights his way to the front, temporarily stuns Straker, grabs Corlie, and jumps with her from the back of the still-wildly out of control battletruck with Straker still in it and still screaming, making death threats, and bumbling about the smoking ruins of the interior of the truck before it falls off a cliff, crashes and explodes, killing him.\nHunter and Corlie end up back at Clearwater, where Corlie apparently settles for good as part of the community.

She soon entertains a guest, Akhtar Hussain, who turns out to be her love interest. He talks of an argument at his house with his father who had asked him to marry the daughter of an affluent cement factory owner. Akhtar claims that he refused the offer and had told his father that he will marry the woman of his choice. At being asked by Najma about when they would get married, Akhtar reveals that in order to marry against the wishes of the family it is necessary that he start earning his own living. He further assures the crestfallen Najma that one Shakir Khan, a middle-aged man working in the gulf area, who would soon be coming to their place, would help him with the money to set up some business. Najma is apprehensive of Shakir Khan's stay with her but Akhtar says that there is no other way as after all, the flat has been provided for by Shakir Khan himself. As the evening proceeds, it is revealed that Najma has received many letters from her home for the past six years however, she never reads them as she still hasn't forgiven her family for forcing her into selling herself in order to earn some money for the family. She had been willing to engage in some other work but her mother had insisted that the pride of the Nawaabs that they had once been would be tarnished if she becomes a working woman and so it would be better to sell the body instead as it is only for a night and can be accomplished secretly. As Akhtar spends the night at Najma's, she remembers how on one of his visits Akhtar had offered to take her with him with a hope of marrying her soon and she too had run away with him.\nThe next day Najma is visited by Salim, a renowned poet, who has been in love with her for the past six years; however, she hasn't accepted his love. The two share a friendly relationship and are very comfortable with each other. Salim once again reiterates that he often thinks about her and that though he couldn't marry her 6 years ago, he is quite capable of doing so today. Salim tells her that she is living a life of lies as Akhtar only visits her to spend the night and has no intention of marrying her.\nNajma and Akhtar receive Shakir Khan at the airport. The next morning Shakir questions Najma on the whereabouts of Akhtar, hinting at the promiscuous nature of their relationship and eyeing Najma the whole time. Najma reaffirms her love for Akhtar at which Shakir says that he always wanted to see her settled and would be happy to help Akhtar in his endeavours. He further expresses his intention to marry a woman  like her which leaves her a bit taken aback.\nShakir Khan asks Najma to throw a kind of party in the evening where he separately tells Akhtar of his wish to marry a woman as he misses the comfort of home and family. A flashback shows Shakir Khan having his own wife and children; however, it is apparent that he was abusive and so not welcome in his house. He wants Najma to find him a bride from her home city of Hyderabad. When Akhtar tells Najma of this she finds it revolting, however she agrees to find a beautiful bride for Shakir at the prospect of this deed helping her and Akhtar to set up their life as a couple.\nThe scene changes to Hyderabad where Sarju and Shabnam fall in love with each-other. Sarju asks Nasreen, who secretly loves Sarju, to help set up a meeting with Shabnam who happens to be her friend. Nasreen is heartbroken but in the face of reality she decides to keep her feelings to herself as both Sarju and Shabnam were much in love. Meanwhile, Najma buys the jewellery and other articles that will be necessary for the wedding, and the wedding party, including the common friend, Salim, departs for Hyderabad. While they travel in the train, a flashback reveals how Salim used to visit Najma at her home in Hyderabad and express his feelings but Najma refused him time and again saying that she is that golden bird for her family whose secret is unknown to him. She says that she cannot marry him and that it would be better that he forget her. She promises to acknowledge him as a friend should their paths ever cross again.\nBack in Hyderabad, Shabnam's mother has to let go of a good match for her eldest daughter as she cannot afford to fulfill the demands of the groom's side. Hajjan Bi, the matchmaker, chides Shabnam's mother as in this way they would never find a match; however, she leaves promising to tell her if a good match comes her way. Meanwhile, Najma, now in Hyderabad, sets out in search of a bride. She ends up at a place where the poor are literally showcasing their daughters, hoping to get their young girls, some of whom have barely reached puberty, married in order to receive some amount of money in return. Najma is horrified by this and questions her role in this whole wedding plan. Nonetheless, she decides to visit her family in Hyderabad and finds her mother get all sentimental to see her again. She also meets Sarju, her childhood friend whom she considers her younger brother. He tells her that he has found a girl he wishes to marry. Najma feels very happy and promises to help him get married and that too quite grandly. As she leaves, she comes across Nasreen and asks her if she has come to meet Sarju, to which she replies in the affirmative. Najma ends up thinking that Nasreen is the girl Sarju was talking about.\nAt a small gathering, consisting of the wedding party from Mumbai, Sarju, Nasreen and Shabnam, Shabnam sings a beautiful song at which Shakir Khan seems quite impressed. He later expresses his wish to marry Shabnam which shocks Najma as Shabnam is quite young and not yet 16. However, Akhtar persuades her to set up the wedding as even if she refuses to, the poor parents will be more than happy to get one of their daughters married to such a rich man. The bride's family accepts the offer but sets up their own demands asking for 5000 rupees for the family (to be used for the elder daughter's marriage) and 101 rupees as bakshish for the matchmaker, Hajjan Bi. With the wedding being set up, Salim is horrified at the whole thing and in a drunken state expresses his anger at how the girls are being sold off to the rich because of poverty. He equates the setting up of the wedding to the system where humans are auctioned. When Sarju gets to know of the wedding, he confronts Shabnam's parents asking them how they could do so knowing that he and Shabnam love each other and that he was working hard to earn a living with the intention of marrying her. He points out that they have auctioned her happiness and swears that he will either not let this wedding take place or destroy himself. On the other hand, Najma is not able to deal with the whole situation and constantly questions her role in it. Salim tells her that marriage is but a socially acceptable way of selling and buying humans and that she too has been a victim of a similar market. He tells her that as long as she is dependent on a man she will be just a toy, only when she stands on her own feet will she become her own person, with her separate identity. At that point, Sarju comes over to Najma and tells her that she had set up the love of his life with Shakir Khan. Najma feels terrible and tries to get the wedding cancelled but to no avail. She breaks down and apologizes for messing it up. Sarju takes matters into his own hands and pleads Shakir Khan to break off the wedding, relating all his troubles, but only gets thrashed by him in return with Akhtar and some of the others from the wedding party as mute spectators.\nShabnam is revolted by the relationship her family had set up but has no choice. She pleads not to get married but all her pleas fall on deaf ears. She goes to the mazaar and unties the thread which she had once tied with the wish to have Sarju as her husband. She points out that she had asked for life when she had tied this thread of wish at the mazaar but now only takes back the dead body of all her wishes. Sarju meets Shabnam for the last time with the help of Nasreen and the two feel sorrowful at the turn of events. Shabnam marries Shakir Khan. Salim decides to go back to Mumbai while Najma plans to stay put. She rejects Akhtar, who was quite elated as now it meant that Shakir Khan would surely help him set up a good life. Najma points out that if he could commit such a thing for money then he could perhaps also sell her off one day for his benefit. Akhtar breaks down and says that he will be destroyed without her, to which she replies that he has already destroyed himself by being a pawn in Shakir Khan's endeavours. On the wedding night, Shakir Khan finds his new bride dead on the bridal bed. Shabnam had committed suicide by poisoning herself. Sarju is heartbroken at the news. Najma feels guilty and catches the train to Mumbai through which Salim was leaving.

The poet Domitius approaches and tries to assassinate him with a dagger, but the attempt is thwarted by Ulmar, Caligula's bodyguard. Domitius ends up losing his tongue and having his tendons cut at Caligula's behest.\nRiding along the beach with Messala, Caligula encounters a group of Christians, among whom he spots Livia. He rapes the woman in the woods in front of her young lover Aetius, a consul's son. While being raped, Livia commits suicide with Caligula's dagger. The emperor orders Messala to kill Aetius on the spot. He spreads word that they were killed by fanatical Christians, and persecutes them. The senators, however, do not believe that the peaceful Christians were responsible and continue to plot against Caligula, discussing their options.\nIn his nightmares, Caligula is visited by the shades of Aetius and Livia. At Livia's funeral, held on a beach, Miriam Celsia, close friend and an Egyptian priestess of the god Anubis, speaks against a Christian burial - the idea being that Livia's God failed to defend her - and in favor of cremation according to Anubis, who speaks of vengeance. The Christians comply.\nLucretius presents sumptuous construction plans to Caligula and a group of senators. To finance the project, Caligula announces he will auction off all his belongings at a banquet with beautiful women and costly admission. He then feigns wine poisoning. One of the senators offers to give his life for his well-being, and Caligula stabs him with his sword. Again in his private rooms, the emperor makes fun of crippled Domitius using his sex slaves.\nIn a temple, Miriam sacrifices her virginity to Anubis in exchange for vengeance on Livia's murder. She is then approached by senator Cornelius who wants to aid her. Caligula's cavalry capture novice Vestal Virgins as the chief attraction of the banquet. In a swimming pool, they are deflowered by slaves approaching underwater with phalli. Other women, among them Miriam, apply for the orgy and are selected by a eunuch, who then trains them in the art of love. During the banquet (which involves jugglers, a bloody gladiatorial combat and the masturbation of a horse), Caligula falls in love with Miriam and his bodyguard Ulmar leads her to the imperial chambers where Miriam and Caligula have sex with each other. When Cornelius attempts to kill Caligula, Miriam unexpectedly saves the emperor's life, killing Cornelius.\nCaligula takes deadly revenge on the senators involved in the plot in a number of gruesome ways. In the meantime, Miriam has become passionately tied to Caligula, who announces he will marry her despite her slave status. She discovers Livia's amulet and becomes torn between vengeance and love. When Ulmar offers to help her escape, she refuses. She can no longer kill Caligula but has to know the truth about Livia's death and therefore administers him a hallucinogenic potion. In his ensuing vision, Caligula is approached and plagued in the beyond by the shades of the people he murdered. One is Miriam. As she approaches, he stabs her with a sword he found on the floor, shouting \"You're just a dream. But I'm still alive!\" When he realizes he is no longer dreaming and has actually stabbed her, he cries.\nRiding again on the beach with Messala, Caligula is approached by senators, praetorian guards and his uncle Claudius. Caligula announces the cancellation of his project for a new Rome and asks that they tell the gods he has woken from his dream. Ulmar, wearing the helmet from Caligula's initial dream, shoots arrows through Messala's neck and Caligula's heart. Dying, Caligula says, \"I'm still alive!

After a discussion with his wife, Uma, in which he had to use all his persuasive powers, Sinha decided to adopt Deepa as his daughter, on a trial basis, for one year and that was how all the fun began. The problems of adjustment that Deepa had to face in her new home were many. Sinha's wife Uma, and college-going daughter Rani were the hardest of all to win over. Because they could not tolerate Deepa's street language and common ways. But the kids in the family, Subash Pappu and Dolly, the old grandmother, and the family retainer Ramdeen became her friends at once because she was the underdog.\nDr. Vikram Sagar, the young handsome family physician started taking a personal interest in her, it looked as if things would turn out well after all. And then came Kishore, the jolly elder son of Sinha, who was studying Law at Pune, he stayed there in the hostel and came to Bombay for his holiday. He was so affectionate and warm to her, that she forgot all her hostility, and started becoming a part of the family. Dr. Vikram and Kishore groomed Deepa into a well-turned-out girl from a decent family and in the process, she and Vikram fell in love. And after a rather tempestuous passage, Vikram managed to get his mother's approval. All was rosy for Deepa when trouble came from an unexpected quarter. On Rakhi Day, both Deepa and Kishore remembered where they had met each other before. Four years back, Kishore was one of the groups of boys led by Sukhdev in the incident that was the turning point of Deepa's life. In acute shame and embarrassment, unable to face her and accept her as a sister, Kishore fled away back to Pune. Deepa was heartbroken. \nFurther, the blow came from her former mentor and gang leader, Shambhu Dada; Lately released from jail, he threatened to kill Judge Sinha and expose a scandal about Rani if Deepa did not hand over all the money of the safe to him. Since everybody in the house had gone out of town for a couple of days to attend a wedding, there was no one Deepa could turn to for advice, and in fear and desperation, she robbed her own home to appease Shambhu.  And when her father and mother returned, she brazened it out before them and became the Deepa of old, the inveterate thief who could not control her impulses, and had thus stolen the money and wasted it away. Shocked beyond belief that all his love and compassion could not reform Deepa, Sinha beat her mercilessly and sent her back to the remand home to complete her sentence. But Kishore and Vikram got wind of something fishy and went after the real culprits. Could they unearth the mystery? And rehabilitate Deepa in the eyes of Society?", "tmdb_id": 543943}, "63206802": {"title": "The Chosen One (1982 film)", "plot": "The film takes place during the Second World War.

The leader of the Mystics, the Master UrSu, raises a young Gelfling named Jen whose clan were slaughtered by the Skeksis.

The gang finds Paul's home address in his wallet and later breaks into his house. They gag and restrain Rosario, Paul's housekeeper, then they began taking turns raping her. When Paul arrives home with his daughter, he is beaten unconscious. Rosario tries to call the police, but Nirvana kills her with his crowbar. They kidnap Carol and take her to their hideout, where one of the gang members rapes her. Carol attempts to escape by running through a plate-glass window, falls onto an iron fence, and is fatally impaled. When the police arrive, Lieutenant Mankewicz asks for help identifying the muggers, but Paul refuses. After Carol's funeral, he takes his Beretta Model 84 handgun to a low-rent inner-city hotel as a base of operations. The next evening, he observes and follows Stomper into an abandoned building as a drug deal is about to be made. Paul shoots one of the dealers and orders the others out before he shoots Stomper twice. The following night, he hears screams from a couple being assaulted in a parking garage by four muggers, which includes Jiver, in a parking garage. Paul kills two rapists and wounds Jiver. Then Paul follows Jiver's blood trail into an abandoned warehouse and kills him.\nThe LAPD suspect that the murders are the work of a vigilante and ask the NYPD for guidance as they dealt with a vigilante spree years earlier. NYPD Detective Frank Ochoa suspects it may be Paul again and is sent to assist with the case. Ochoa understands that Paul, when caught, will reveal that he was released without being charged for killing the ten muggers in New York City. Ochoa meets with Mankewicz, who suspects that Ochoa is not telling him everything. Ochoa enters Geri's apartment and tells her about Paul's previous vigilante killing spree in New York City. After Paul returns to his house, Geri confronts him about Ochoa's revelation, but he denies it. Ochoa follows Paul to a local square, where Paul is tailing the three remaining gang members. He follows them to an abandoned park, where a major arms and drug deal is underway. A sniper scouts Paul and attempts to kill him, but Ochoa warns Paul and fatally shoots the sniper. Ochoa is mortally wounded by Nirvana, and Paul shoots Cutter in the head and another dealer and wounds Punkcut. The arms dealer tries to get away, but Paul shoots him and causes his car to drive off a cliff and explodes, but Nirvana escapes. Ochoa tells Paul to avenge him before he dies. Paul escapes, and Punkcut dies from his injuries after giving information about Nirvana to the police.\nPaul learns from one of Geri's colleagues that the police are preparing a tactical unit to capture Nirvana. He obtains a police scanner and, by monitoring police radio traffic, finds out when and where the arrest is going to take place. He drives to the location to kill him, but Nirvana, under the influence of PCP, slashes his arm and stabs a few officers while he tries to escape. Tried and found criminally insane, he is sent to a mental institution. Geri is writing a story about the case and capital punishment and takes Paul to the hospital to meet the doctor treating Nirvana. While there, Paul steals another doctor's white lab coat and identification card and uses it to enter the asylum and confront Nirvana. After repeatedly stabbing Paul with a shiv, Nirvana ends up plunging his arm into a high-voltage panel, which Paul turns on, fatally electrocuting him. Donald Kay, a sympathetic orderly at the hospital, recognizes Paul from the newspaper coverage of Carol's murder, and gives him three minutes to escape before he rings the alarm. Geri goes to Paul's house, where she finds out that he made a fake doctor's ID. Upon hearing a news report of Nirvana's death on the radio, she realizes that Paul really is the vigilante that Ochoa claimed him to be. She takes off her engagement ring and leaves him, with Paul arriving home moments later.\nA few months later, Paul speaks about a new architectural design. He is invited by his employer to a party to celebrate the new design. When Paul is asked if he is able to attend, he answers, \"What else would I be doing?\" The final scene shows Paul returning to the streets of Los Angeles at night and continuing his vigilante killing spree as the film finishes.", "tmdb_id": 14373}, "1059728": {"title": "Deathtrap (film)", "plot": "Famed playwright Sidney Bruhl debuts the latest in a series of Broadway flops and returns to his opulent Long Island home and his wife Myra. Although their financial situation is not dire, Sidney is starving for a hit. He receives a manuscript of a play called Deathtrap, written by one of his students, Clifford Anderson, that he considers to be near-perfection. Clifford recently attended one of Sidney's writing workshops and is now asking for input on his play. Sidney tells Myra that the best idea he has had lately is to murder Clifford and produce the play as his own. Myra realizes that's he's not just talking idly.\nSidney invites Clifford to their secluded home, decorated with weapons from his plays, to discuss Clifford's play. Clifford arrives by train. Over the course of an evening, Myra tries desperately to convince Sidney to work with Clifford as equal partners but to no avail. Sidney then attacks Clifford and strangles him with a chain. Sidney removes the body but still has to convince Myra to conspire with him. She reveals nothing when they receive an unexpected visit from the psychic Helga Ten Dorp, a minor celebrity staying with the Bruhls' neighbors. Helga senses pain and death in the house. Before she leaves, she warns Sidney about a man in boots who will attack him.\nAs Myra prepares for bed, she begins to come to terms with what Sidney has done. She heads downstairs for a drink but a sound spooks her and she flees back upstairs, suspecting an intruder. Sidney takes her back downstairs to prove that all is well and they return to the bedroom. The calm is broken when Clifford bursts through the bedroom window and beats Sidney with a log. Clifford chases Myra through the house until her weak heart gives out and she collapses and dies.\nSidney calmly descends the stairs, uninjured, and joins Clifford. They exchange a few words about what to do with Myra's body, then exchange a passionate kiss. The previous few hours are revealed to have been an elaborate ruse to kill Myra. Clifford moves in with Sidney and the two work together at a partner's desk. Sidney suffers from writer's block but Clifford busily types page after page of a new play that he suspiciously keeps under lock and key. While Clifford is out grocery shopping, Sidney tries to break into the drawer but fails to before Clifford returns home. He waits for Clifford to retrieve his play, then switches Clifford's manuscript with a fake.\nSidney is horrified to read that Clifford is using the true story of Myra's murder as the basis of a new play called Deathtrap. He angrily confronts Clifford, who boasts about the play's potential and insists he will write it with or without Sidney's approval. Clifford offers to share the credit with Sidney, who comes to believe that Clifford is a sociopath. Sidney plays along with the collaboration on Deathtrap while he plots a solution. A few days later, Helga stops by, ostensibly for candles in anticipation of a predicted thunderstorm. Almost immediately after meeting Clifford, she warns Sidney that Clifford is the man in boots.\nSidney asks Clifford to arm himself with an axe to demonstrate a bit of stage business, then produces a gun. He intends to shoot Clifford, claim it was in self-defense and dispose of the Deathtrap manuscript. But Sidney finds his gun to be empty. Clifford had anticipated some such scheme from him and has loaded the bullets into a different gun. Clifford now intends to use Sidney's attempted betrayal-and-axe scheme in the play. He secures Sidney to a chair with manacles and tells him he is going to pack up and leave. He warns Sidney to not try to stop the production of the play.\nHowever, Clifford is unaware the manacles are trick shackles, once the property of Harry Houdini. Sidney easily releases himself, grabs a crossbow and incapacitates Clifford with a single shot. Before Sidney can dispose of the body, the storm hits with full force and the house suffers a blackout. A flash of lightning illuminates the living room and a fleeting figure scurries through. It is Helga, thinking Sidney is in danger and coming to help.\nShe realizes that Sidney actually poses the threat and grabs a gun while Sidney finds a knife. Clifford regains consciousness and trips Helga. The gun goes flying and a struggle for it ensues. Clifford stumbles to his feet, grabs the axe and swings it at Sidney. In that moment, the scene transitions to a stage version of itself, with actors before a full house. The on-stage struggle culminates with \"Clifford\" stabbing \"Sidney\" and both dying, leaving \"Helga\" victorious.

Jennifer appears to Mary numerous times in secret, ultimately communicating her desire to kill the entire family, except for Mary, as an act of revenge.\nFollowing this revelation from Mary, the family members suffer an assortment of twisted fates: the appearance of Kevin's pet iguana in Grandma Bernice's bed causes the elderly woman to suffer a fatal heart attack; Kevin's attempt to retrieve a Frisbee from the roof results in a deadly fall; the radio Phillip listens to while bathing ends up electrocuting him. Laura barely escapes, injuring her arm.\nBased on the belief that she committed the murders, Mary is placed in a mental institution and soon experiences a flashback concerning Jennifer's fate. In the flashback, while riding home from their grandmother's house, Kevin convinces Mary to play a prank on Jennifer and they tie her shoelaces together. Aside from being jealous of their parents' favoritism toward their sister, Kevin and Mary are fed up with Jennifer's constant bullying. When a van collides with their car, everyone except Jennifer manages to escape. She screams for help as Mary runs to inform her father of Jennifer's plight, but Phillip is unable to rescue her before the car bursts into flames. Back in the present, Mary now claims that she is actually Jennifer; the deceased sister has possessed her living sister. Mary screams for Jennifer not to leave and that she \"loved her\".\nLater, as Laura sleeps in her bedroom, she is awakened by a sound at the foot of her bed.

While his teacher had allowed him to go, Nobita rushed to his house, fearing that his mother would scold him. On his way, he found a dog, dirty and hungry, after fighting with a dog the previous night. Nobita wanted to help it, but he couldn't. When his mom sent him to bring some things from the market, he had gone there, and while he returned, he spotted the dog again, and Nobita gave him a sausage that he had brought from the market. The dog tried to follow him, but Nobita chased the dog away, fearing his mother will scold him because of her dislike of pets. But when Nobita's mom lost her purse, the dog helped her in finding her purse. To repay the dog's help, she agrees to keep the dog as a pet. After Nobita and Doraemon cleaned the dog, they named him Peko.\nEarlier, Nobita and his friends talked about wanting to go on some adventure, and asked Doraemon for that. Doraemon launched a rocket to find unexplored areas on the planet by taking satellite pictures, mainly from Africa. They have left searching for it, knowing that it would be very difficult to handle too many pictures. However, Peko tinkered with the device while Nobita and Doraemon are away, and found a mysterious giant statue somewhere in Africa. After consulting with Dekisugi, he deduced that the area where the statue is was never explored because there's always a thick fog around it, something that doesn't effect Doraemon's satellite pictures. Excited that they might have found something no one has discovered, Nobita, Doraemon, and all of their friends, including Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo, planned to go on an expedition to find the statue.\nAfter the first day of the expedition, Gian got annoyed by the group's overreliance on Doraemon's gadgets, including Shizuka using the Anywhere Door to go home to use the restroom, or the group hindering several wild animals with them, and angrily went off. At night, however, he was visited by the mysterious statue in his bedroom, who tells him about hidden treasures before disappearing. Interested, Gian rejoins the group the next day, but tells Doraemon to leave any gadgets that they use the day before. When they are cruising on a crocodile infested river with a ship, Gian forgot to steer it when he was throwing coconuts at crocodiles, causing the ship to crash. With the Anywhere Door burned by people who mistakenly thought it was garbage, the group was almost swarmed by crocodiles, but they got rescued by a group of natives, who takes them to the village. The natives know about the mysterious statue, and told Doraemon that they have to go through a lion-infested savanna and a very deep gorge. This scares the group, but Gian claims that he will get the treasure on the statue, which angers the natives who believes doing so will curse their village. That night, when the group camps and laments on their situation without some of Doraemon's gadgets, Gian accused them of blaming him and angrily goes to bed, but when Peko visits him, he broke down crying.\nWhen the group reached the savanna, the mysterious statue appears again and drives the lions off. When they safely reached the bottom of the deep gorge and figured out the superstitions surrounding it, Peko, now fully trusting the group, reveals himself to be a prince of a kingdom of bipedal dogs with human intelligence. He told them that the evil minister Daburanda and his lackey Dr. Kos were planning to conquer the world, assassinates the king, and accidentally throw Peko, who's trapped in a coffin, into the underground river in the gorge, causing him to meet Nobita. Doraemon and his friends decided to help him. First, they searched for Burusasu, one of Peko's loyal bodyguards, but found out he's arrested by Daburanda's soldiers. After helping a young puppy named Chippo, they free Burusasu from a prison, but Daburanda and his army commander, Saberu, realize that Peko is back, and began a search for him and Doraemon's group. Daburanda also reveals that he has princess Spiana captive in his palace.\nWhile everyone is hiding from Daburanda's soldiers, Burusasu said there was a saying that, \"When the world will be covered by darkness, 10 travelers will come and move the statue's heart to save the palace.\". Doraemon thinks the travelers are him, Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo, but realizes there are only five of them. When Chippo is hungry, Doraemon uses the Anticipating Promise Machine to make everyone feel full, but they have to fulfill the promise the next day.\nThe next night, the group went to the statue, but was ambushed by Daburanda's soldiers. Burusasu faces the soldiers and lets Peko pass, but soon they got cornered by Dr. Kos and his aerial fleet. Peko was willing to hold the army back while the group escape, but Gian followed him, and soon the entire group does. Finally, they decided to get to the statue together, which is guarded by Daburanda, Saberu, and an army. When Nobita wonders about the old saying of ten travelers, Shizuka uses the Anticipating Promise Machine for help. Suddenly, the second group of Doraemon, Nobita, Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo appears, fully equipped with weapon gadgets, and fights Daburanda and his army while the main group enters the statue, followed by Saberu. When Nobita lags behind, Saberu catches up to him. Despite given the Denkomaru sword, Nobita takes a long time dueling the skilled Saberu before finally defeating him. The group fighting the army is also forced to retreat when Dr. Kos arrives with his aerial fleet.\nEventually, Peko and the rest of the group manage to reach the statue's heart, which is a mechanism to bring the statue 'alive' like a robot. Using it, Dr. Kos and the army were defeated, and Daburanda flees to the palace. He tried to bring princess Spiana with him, but Peko, using the statue, arrives in time and rescues her. Peko soon became the rightful ruler of the kingdom, and the other Doraemon gives the original Doraemon a new Anywhere Door to go home.\nWhen the group came back home, they realized that they still have to fulfill one last the promise made from the Anticipating Promise Machine. The episode ends when Nobita leads everyone to the Time Machine to go back in time and help their past selves fight Daburanda's army and enter the statue."}, "15945871": {"title": "The Dorm That Dripped Blood", "plot": "On a college campus, a young male coed is chased and killed by an unseen assailant.

After Paul grows suspicious, he follows Raoul and discovers he has been selling the victims' bodies to a dog food company, selling their expensive cars, and secretly keeping the money.\nRaoul tries to persuade Mary to run away with him after they have sex again. He nearly runs down Paul with a car, so Paul hires Doris the Dominatrix to use her costuming and role-playing skills to get rid of him. She poses as an immigration agent threatening Raoul, a Mexican immigrant, with deportation. She pretends to be a public health worker who diagnoses him with venereal disease. The pills she promises will cure him are actually saltpeter tablets which render him impotent. These schemes fail to deter Raoul's interest in Mary.\nThe Blands fear they will lose the property they wish to buy for the restaurant to another buyer. To quickly earn more cash, they attend a swingers party in search of victims. Mr. Leech, a bank lender who earlier refused to loan Mary money after she rejected his sexual advances, sees her at the party and propositions her. Mary kills him with a rattail comb and throws his body from a window. While Paul and Mary try to retrieve Mr. Leech's possessions, the party's host demands they join the nude guests in the hot tub or leave. Paul loses his temper and hurls an electric space heater into the hot tub, killing all of the partygoers and enabling him and Mary to take their money and sell their cars.\nA drunken Raoul breaks into the Blands' apartment and threatens to kill Paul for not sharing the money earned from the swingers' cars. He announces that he intends to wed Mary and tells her to kill Paul with the frying pan. Instead, Mary lures Raoul into the kitchen and murders him.\nMary confesses her affair with Raoul to Paul, who tells her that he already knows. The Blands suddenly remember that James, the real estate agent who is helping them buy the property for the restaurant, will arrive for dinner soon. With no meat in the house and no time to go grocery shopping, they cook Raoul and serve him for dinner, describing the dish as \"Spanish\".

It opens with him having a heart attack while directing a film. He is convinced to go to London for diagnosis and, subsequently, a heart bypass. The day before the operation, he spends time with his chauffeur. The film was daring for implying a homosexual attraction between the two men. Homoerotic tension was created by knowing glances that are exchanged between Yehia and the taxi driver.Once Yehia is put under anaesthetic, the action shifts to a surreal, dreamlike court case held within Yehia's own chest cavity (the roof-beams of the court-room, for example, are Yehia's ribs). Yehia's inner child is on trial: feeling unloved by the adult Yehia, this child is attempting to kill Yehia. The child's witness stand comprises clear plastic tubes into which he drops white crystals, symbolising Yehia's arteries and the cholesterol that is choking them. As different witnesses speak during the chaotic court scenes, the film presents different flashbacks to Yehia's life, starting with his unfair treatment by a bitter, Catholic primary-school teacher.\nThe flashbacks position Yehia at some key moments in Egyptian history: participating as a youth in riots against British forces in Egypt; starring in and directing a film which alludes to the 1958 Cairo Station; fruitlessly seeking Euro-American approval for his work at the Cannes Film Festival and in New York, but winning a prize at the inaugural Moscow International Film Festival; and making a film about the Battle of Algiers (1956\u201357), perhaps alluding to the 1966 movie The Battle of Algiers. The film portrays an ageing Yehia getting into trouble with censors, yet insisting on continuing to shoot his banned film, during which he has his heart attack.\nYehia's relationships with his mother, sister, and wife Amal are a key theme in both the flashbacks and the court scenes. Insofar as they have mistreated Yehia, the film suggests that these women's behaviours arises from their own experience of and participation in patriarchal oppression. Yehia's mother is forced to marry and have children young; in turn, she imposes the same strictures on her daughter; and Yehia himself refuses to allow his daughter to pursue a love-marriage just before his heart-attack. Amal is similarly confined by motherhood and Yehia's own infantility.\nThe film ends with Yehia's inner child being condemned to death and plunging into an artery with a knife to attempt to kill Yehia. The surgeon operating on Yehia succeeds in extracting the inner child, however, and Yehia is saved. On coming to from his anaesthetic, Yehia meets his inner child, makes peace with him, and the inner child merges back into Yehia.

Poirot agrees to meet Marshall at an exclusive Adriatic Sea island and confront her. The hotel is the former summer palace of the reigning King of Tyrania, now owned by Daphne Castle, who had received the palace \"for services rendered\".\nSir Horace's former mistress Arlena is an actress and is on holiday with her husband Kenneth.

Writer Rex Brewster has already spent the royalties advanced to him for a tell-all biography of Arlena, but she refuses to give him a release for the biography, angering him.

Sir Horace argued with Arlena about the diamond at Ladder Bay at 11:30, which was confirmed by his yacht crew and by Daphne. Arlena kept the diamond, promising an explanation that evening, and Poirot finds the fake jewel nearby in a grotto. Patrick left at 11:30 with Myra, seeing Sir Horace's yacht coming, and hearing the noon day cannon firing. Rex met Linda when entering Gull Cove at 12:00 and reports that a bottle flung from the top of a cliff nearly hit him. Odell was seen reading by Daphne and her staff. He claims low water pressure hindered his 12:15 wash before tennis, but nobody admits to bathing at that time.\nAssembling the suspects together, Poirot accuses Christine and Patrick of the crime: Christine knocked out Arlena and hid her in the nearby grotto, and Patrick strangled the helpless Arlena later. Christine posed as Arlena with makeup to simulate a suntan, Arlena's swimsuit and large red hat, to be purposely mis-identified by Patrick in Myra's presence. But Poirot had smelt Arlena's perfume in the grotto. Christine set Linda's watch twenty minutes fast, suggested she wear a swim cap to muffle the noon cannon, and corrected the watch afterwards. She tossed out the lotion bottle, almost hitting Rex, and washed off her tan, thus depriving the hotel's poor water system of pressure. Poirot suspects that Patrick switched Sir Horace's jewel with a copy and that Patrick and Christine killed Arlena to conceal the theft. The Redferns scoff at the detective's accusations, and point out that he has no real evidence.\nOn going to leave the hotel, Patrick pays by cheque, signing the \"R\" in \"Redfern\" in a distinctive way that Poirot recognises as being the same way \"Felix Ruber\", husband of the Yorkshire moor victim, signed his name.

That night, Senji offers herself to Sheng, who refuses to take advantage of her, though he agrees that she may play a song for him on her flute.

Hao uses a mysterious key his master gave to him to unlock them, and makes many unsuccessful attempts to put them on Mudou.  Finally, channeling his rage over the deaths of Senji, Sheng, and Zeng, he shackles Mudou's legs and pulls him down and while his 3 fellow martial arts students spear him, Hao tears Mudou in half. Hao himself is mortally wounded in the process.  As his fellow martial arts students enquire as to why he put himself in front of Muduo's spiked feet, he dies.

Summoning his three magical brothers, he proposes combining their powers to create a \"last realm of magic\" hidden from the rest of the world. The Blue Wizard Solarius, who commands the heavens  and seas, and the Golden Wizard Lo Tae Zhao, whose realm is light and air, agree to the proposal. However, the Red Wizard Ommadon, master of black magic and the forces of evil, resolves instead to infect mankind with fear and greed, causing humans to use their science to destroy themselves.\nSince the wizards are forbidden to fight among themselves, Carolinus proposes sending a group of heroes on a quest to steal Ommadon's crown, which is the source of his power. The party includes the knight Sir Orrin Neville-Smythe and Carolinus' young dragon companion Gorbash. Solarius gives them an enchanted shield which can deflect dark magic, and Lo Tae Zhao contributes a magic flute which lulls dragons to sleep. Requiring a leader, Carolinus consults the magical force of Antiquity, which directs him to look 1,000 years into the future to find a man of science descended from a legendary hero. In late 20th century Boston Carolinus locates Peter Dickinson, a former scientist turned board game designer who is obsessed with dragons. Carolinus brings Peter back through time and enlists him in the quest, and Peter becomes enamored of Carolinus' ward, Princess Melisande. Ommadon sends his dragon Bryagh to capture Peter, and an accident with one of Carolinus' spells while rescuing him causes Peter to merge with Gorbash, Peter's mind taking over the dragon's body.\nKnowing nothing about being a dragon, Peter is mentored by Carolinus' elder dragon companion, Smrgol. The dichotomy of magic and science is explored when Smrgol teaches Peter how dragons fly and breathe fire, abilities which Peter is able to explain with scientific principles. As the quest progresses, the heroes survive an attack by the monstrous Sand Murks and are joined by the talking wolf Aragh, the archer Danielle, and the elf Giles. As the party nears Ommadon's realm, Danielle and Sir Orrin are captured by an ogre. Peter is nearly killed attempting to rescue them but is saved by Smrgol, who defeats the ogre at the cost of his own life.

Ommadon casts a spell to induce hopelessness in the group, which Peter repels using Solarius' shield. Ommadon next sends numerous dragons to kill the heroes, but Giles plays Lo Tae Zhao's enchanted flute, lulling them and Peter to sleep. Bryagh remains awake and kills Giles, Aragh, and Danielle. Sir Orrin slays Bryagh, but dies from his wounds.\nWhen Ommadon appears on the battlefield, Peter manages to separate himself from Gorbash by recalling the principle of impenetrability. He is able to defeat Ommadon by countering the wizard's declarations of magic with explanations of science and logic, and denying the existence of magic. This destroys Ommadon, restores the other heroes to life, and allows the magical realm to take shape.

American scientist Burt Gains oversees the test under the aegis of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency with the target warhead being launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base as the international media covers it. After the Space Ranger module successfully destroys the warhead, the crew of the Space Voyager shuttle carrying the module returns to worldwide adulation. Gains looks at the successful test as a sign that nuclear war can be prevented but has reservations about its potential to inflame the nuclear arms race. His sister Laura and his best friend Wataru Mikumo soon find out that he was kidnapped by Soviet spies while heading off to work. A Soviet Alfa-class submarine is tasked to transport Burt to Vladivostok. Seeing the danger of Burt forced to replicate his Space Ranger work for the Soviets, US President Gibson orders the submarine to be sunk. After a failed earlier attempt by S-3 Vikings to attack the Alfa, a P-3 Orion from Midway Island sinks it with a nuclear torpedo. \nTension builds up between the US and the USSR in the wake of the sinking, with President Gibson attempting a peaceful solution with the Soviets, who promptly put their forces in Eastern Europe on high alert. Wataru is promoted to lead the Space Ranger research team as Laura is medically confined due to depression over her brother's death.\nOn Christmas Eve, the Soviets get the news that an elite Soviet Air Force pilot has defected, flying the USSR's most advanced strike aircraft, the 'Black Dragon', to a West German Air Force base in West Germany. Fearful of NATO acquiring Black Dragon's technology, the Soviets launch a Spetsnaz commando using an An-12 raid to kill the pilot and destroy the plane, leaving a wake of devastation in the process. NATO forces are then ordered to counterattack, leading to war. The Soviets and the Warsaw Pact forces go into battle. After days of fighting they easily blast their way across West Germany and the Low Countries, eventually capturing Paris.\nThe Soviets keep up the offensive, with attacks on Iran, Turkey, and the other parts of the Middle East to capture oil resources while launching airstrikes with Tu-22M2s on Japan due to Japan supporting NATO forces. China joins the war as well at first on the side of the Soviets and invades Taiwan, Hong Kong, and South Korea. However disagreements over which nation will control Japan and racial tensions lead to fighting between Soviet and PLA forces who then attack the USSR's Far East region. US forces invade Cuba and Nicaragua. Soviet First Deputy Premier Kutuzov convenes the Politburo on Premier Orlov's behalf and proposes a ceasefire to secure oil rights to the Middle East while plotting to arrest Defense Minister Bulgarin, who earlier pushed Orlov to go to war. However, Bulgarin appears and has the entire Politburo arrested by Soviet forces that are loyal to him.\nA Soviet Navy ballistic missile submarine receives orders to launch on the US, but comes under attack from the US Navy and sustains heavy damage. Waiting for a recall order from Premier Orlov himself, the submarine captain refuses to launch the missiles, but with the sub rapidly sinking, his executive officer kills him and completes the launch with his communications officer. Several US cities are destroyed in the attack and President Gibson authorizes a limited nuclear counterstrike. Bulgarin launches a second strike while one of his assistants kills Orlov as he tries to negotiate peace with Gibson over the hotline. The Soviet attack hits more US and allied cities, with casualties estimated at 20 million. Gibson learns that Vandenberg is still safe and authorizes the Space Ranger's deployment with Wataru sent up as well. Meanwhile, survivors in the war zones begin a peace movement together with deserting soldiers. When Bulgarin learns that the deserters include Soviet and Warsaw Pact troops, outraged that his forces are abandoning the Soviet cause he prepares to launch all remaining Soviet nuclear missiles, but Kutuzov reappears in a bid to force him to stop. Bulgarin is killed, but not before he presses the launch button with the override canceled.\nWord of the new strike inbound reaches Gibson and the Space Ranger forces, with four modules in orbit to stop the warheads. While the satellites destroy many MIRV warheads, three are destroyed by the Soviets' killer satellite network and one warhead severely damages the fourth and the Space Voyager shuttle. Wataru decides to head to the last remaining satellite and repair it ahead of another wave of MIRVs before his oxygen runs out. The module is repaired and Wataru shoots down seven MIRVs but is forced to maneuver the satellite to get close and shoot down the eighth bearing down on Los Angeles, but the blast shakes him loose from the module and out into space. Laura, who was evacuated to the US after being caught in the Soviet airstrikes on Japan, flies in another shuttle to save Wataru while Kutuzov orders the crew of a nearby Soviet space station to rescue him.

They never realized the fact that they belong two different castes, Rukmini from an orthodox Namboodhri Tharavadu and Aravindakshan from a low-caste Puliya household. But the same music was the cause of their separation too, because of their ego clash.\nThe movie takes us to a beautiful village in Kerala with a river and temple. We hear a melodious Thiagaraja's composition Sri Mahaganabathm Bajare. A belonging to a local Puliya community listens to the song with so much adulation and follows curiously where it is coming from and it took him to a palatial Namboodhri Tharavaadu. The boy is Aravindakshan and the singer is Narayana Namboodhiri Padu. As he is not allowed to enter the house, he is stopped at the gate. He soon was sent back. Fortunately Narayanan saw him again, this time he saw him deeply engrossed in the sound of nature. He decided to take him as his disciple as he found a musical genius in him.\nHe welcomed him to his house, gave him a nice dress and food and took him to the Kathakali performance. All the guests walked away saying he brought curse to the Namboodhiri family by bringing a lower-caste boy. Narayanan completely ignored their criticism and decided to teach him, saying music knows no caste. Aravindakshan began to learn from him. Narayanan was completely impressed by his talent and his daughter Sreedevi started admiring him secretly. She too learned Mohiniyattam and the house was filled with music.\nAfter many years of dedicated learning, Aravindakshan became a great singer, even surpassed his Guru. But unlike Narayanan he started performing in famous auditoriums and temples and became a well known figure. Ganapathi iyer and Vasukkutty became his constant accompanies. Ganapathi often mentions one Palghat Rukmini and Aravindakshan was curious to know about her. In fact he was a bit jealous of her even without seeing her. Ganapathi was supposed to play for her in Chithoor concert and people were so enthralled by her music. Even Rukmini heard people talking about Aravindakshan and she wants to meet him desperately.\nNarayanan Namboothiri was all in praise of Aravindakshan. He has given up all his properties and living in a small house with Sree Devi. Aravindakshan felt guilty and asked him whether he is responsible for his present state for which Namboodhiri answered it was his own decision. He quoted Saint Thiagaraja \"Nidhi saala Sugama, Rama Nee Paaduka seva Sugama\".\nRukmini finally had a chance to see him. She heard through Ganabathi that he is an expert in singing Ragamalika. Rukmini wanted to learn it, too. When he approached Narayanan ge refused immediately, saying Aravindakshan is the right choice and Rukmini decided to meet him. But her father is dead against the idea, as he felt it is below their prestige to learn from a lower-caste person. He even insulted Namboothiri saying he is only fit for teaching low caste students. Rukmini apologized on her father's behalf and left with a heavy heart.\nShe went to the temple where Aravindakshan is going to sing . She introduced herself to him and told her life's ambition to learn Ragamalika from him. Aravindakshan was so spellbound on seeing her and agreed immediately. They both were so involved in their passion and spent all their time singing and learning from each other. In that process, a mutual attraction develops. They both decided to get married. They even talk about having a baby who will neither be a Namboothiri nor a Nair or Pulaya but a child of music.\nNarayanan was so happy when he heard the news and gave his blessings, but Sreedevi was broken hearted . Narayanan consoled her asking her to swallow it like a bitter pill. He told her that Thirumeni family are only givers and not takers.\nThere was a storm in their smooth relationship all of a sudden. Rukmini's friend was commenting casually one day that Aravindakshan is a little proud about his musical talent and Rukmini too felt the same. When Sami iyer was criticizing Aravindakshan mixing two ragas in a concert, he got so furious saying such a thing can never happen and only Goddess Saraswathi can find fault with him and no one else. He asked to Rukmini's opinion about this for which she sang a composition of Saint Thiagaraja which states that even an emperor cannot feel superior to anyone. All started making fun of him including Ramaiar. Aravindakshan got so insulted and immediately walked away saying it is because he belongs to a lower caste they all joined together and make fun of him. Rukmini was completely shattered .\nNarayanan Namboothiri died suddenly of heart attack. Aravindakshan carried his body to the grave. Other Namboothiris cursed Narayanan for bringing insult to their community. Sreedevi was left alone . Aravindakshan was ready to marry her saying he never did anything in return for his Guru and this is the only out of gratitude he is doing. He told her that he has forgotten his relationship with Rukmini as a bad dream.\nGanabathi Iyer stopped accompanying Aravindakshan. Rukmini found out that his father is having an affair with another woman. She accused him saying even her mother had the same status and she was an accident. He was using her musical talent only to make money and left him leaving all her savings with him and never to look at her again. When she wanted to return to Aravindakshan she was shocked to see him with Sreedevi as husband and wife. She decided to leave her home. Ganapathi decided to be with her as a loyal servant.\nAfter few months they both had a chance to meet. This time in Guruvayur. Aravindakshan was supposed to be honored for getting Padmashree by a musical Saba. Only after arriving he realise it was after Rukmini's concert. He immediately walked away from the venue. Though Rukmini performed in the function, after that she completely broke down.\nYears passed by. Aravindakshan and Sreedevi have a son Anand who is musically very talented like his parents but his interest is in western music. He becomes a gifted guitar player. But his father opposes him playing a western instrument, calling him a rebel and not appreciating his talents. Once he was so angered that he broke his guitar. Anand left the house in a huff.\nGanapathi found him lying under the tree one day, and immediately recognized him as Aravindakshan's son. He took him to Rukmini. Without revealing his background he asked her to teach him, saying he is very interested in learning music. Rukmini was astonished by his music talent but soon found out he must be Aravindakshan's son. By the same time, Aravindakshan lost his voice and could not sing like before. He was frustrated and visiting all temples. Rukmini and Aravindakshan met once again in Mookambika temple. Rukmini told him he has not lost his voice but she has it with her. She took him to Anand. Father and son had a happy reunion.

His state funeral is shown, the procession attended by millions of people from all walks of life, with a radio reporter speaking eloquently about Gandhi's world-changing life and works.\nIn June 1893, the 23-year-old Gandhi is thrown off from a South African train for being an Indian sitting in a first-class compartment, despite his having a first-class ticket. Realising the laws are biased even against well-educated and successful Indians, he then decides to start a non-violent protest campaign for the rights of all Indians in South Africa, arguing that they are British subjects and entitled to the same rights and privileges as whites. After numerous arrests and unwelcome international attention, the government finally relents by recognising some rights for Indians.In 1915, as a result of his victory in South Africa, Gandhi is invited back to India, where he is now considered something of a national hero. He is urged to take up the fight for India's independence (Swaraj, Quit India) from the British Empire. Gandhi agrees, and mounts a non-violent non-cooperation campaign of unprecedented scale, coordinating millions of Indians nationwide. There are some setbacks, such as violence against the protesters or by the protesters themselves, Gandhi's occasional imprisonment, and the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar.\nNevertheless, the campaign generates great attention, and Britain faces intense public pressure. In 1930, Gandhi protests against the British-imposed salt tax via a highly symbolic Salt March. He also travels to London for a conference concerning Britain's possible departure from India; this, however, proves fruitless. Gandhi spends much of the Second World War in prison for not supporting the war. During a period under house arrest, his wife dies. After the war ends, India finally wins its independence. Indians celebrate this victory, but their troubles are far from over. The country is subsequently partitioned by religion. It is decided that the northwest area and the eastern part of India (current-day Bangladesh), both places where Muslims are in the majority, will become a new country called Pakistan. It is hoped that by permitting the Muslims to live in a separate country, violence will abate. Gandhi is opposed to the idea and is even willing to allow Muhammad Ali Jinnah to become the first Prime Minister of India, but the Partition of India is carried out nevertheless. Religious tensions between Hindus and Muslims erupt into nationwide violence. Repulsed by this sudden unrest, Gandhi declares a hunger strike, in which he will not eat until the fighting stops. The fighting does stop eventually.\nGandhi spends his last days trying to bring about peace between both nations. He, thereby, angers many dissidents on both sides, one of whom (Godse) is involved in a conspiracy to assassinate him. Gandhi is cremated and his ashes are scattered on the holy Ganga.

His employee, Lionel Switch, is the garage's goofy and bumbling auto mechanic who dreams of being a rock star. \"I can do it!\" Lionel often exclaims. After some modest character development and a collage-like dream sequence there is a tongue-in-cheek choreographed musical finale while nuclear war begins.\nAt the destroyed gas station-diner post nuclear holocaust, Booji Boy is the lone survivor, but after his cynical prose the opening credits are a return to present time prior to apocalypse. [Some edits of the film place this scene at the end, including the most recent Director's Cut.]\nAt the nuclear power plant nuclear garbage men (members of Devo) reveal that radioactive waste is routinely mishandled and dumped at the nearby town of Linear Valley. They sing a remake of \"Worried Man Blues\" while loading waste barrels on an old truck. Meanwhile, Lionel and his buddy Fred Kelly (Russ Tamblyn) ride bicycles to work. Fred states that Old Otto's recent death was by radiation poisoning. They remain unaware of the implications as Lionel laments it should have been himself that died because he has worked on \"almost every radiator in every car in town.\"\nEarly in the day at the diner Young Otto announces he must fire an employee for lack of money. He chooses waitress Kathryn, who has a tantrum and refuses to leave. She sits down weeping at a booth that has a picture on the wall of Old Otto and chooses on the juke box the song \"The End of the World\". Later, waitress Irene, overhears Young Otto's plans to fire everybody, destroy the buildings and collect on a fraud insurance claim. Irene demands to be included in the scheme and to seal the deal with a kiss.\nAlthough Lionel has a crush on the waitress Charlotte Goodnight, she has a crush on the milkman Earl Duke.

He flirts with her saying, \"Charlotte ...on my way over here this morning I thought about you and the earth moved.\" She replies, \"You felt it too!\" He also offers her a milk bath. While he is there a dining Arab sheik offers him wealth in return for his \"whiteness.\"\nA limousine stops at the gas station. After Lionel learns his rock star idol, Frankie Fontaine, is in the limousine he insists the vehicle will need work. After meeting rock star Frankie, who appears to lead an opulent, sequestered and drug influenced life-style, Lionel says to the wooden Indian in his shop, \"Now there's a real human being!\"\nLionel receives a bump on the head while working on Frankie's limousine and enters a dream. He becomes a rock star with a backup band of wooden Indians. Back stage he is given a milk bath by Irene. Lionel travels with his band (the wooden Indians) and crew (all people from his waking life) by trucks through the desert. The wooden Indians become missing.\nDuring \"Goin' Back\" (a song by Young) the entourage recreates in the desert near a Pueblo. Native Americans prepare a bonfire to burn the wooden Indians which had been missing. Soon Lionel is playing music and dancing around the bonfire which appears to have become the center of a Pow-wow. \"Goin' Back\" ends gazing into the bonfire of burning wooden Indians. \"Hey, Hey, My, My\" is a ten-minute studio jam performance of Devo and Young.\nLionel wakes from his dream surrounded by concerned friends much like Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz.

When she refuses, he chases her into the woods and brutally rapes her; her dogs break out of their pen and they attack and fatally maul Ida's rapist.\nThirty-six years later, in 1982, Waspy brothers Eric and Nick are borrowing their father's yacht to take their girlfriends, Sandy and Donna, on a weekend outing along with their sister, Carla, to St. Martin Island. At the outset of the trip. As the tensions rise between Nick and Eric, Donna and Sandy engage in girl-talk, and geeky Carla silently laments that she is the sole member of the cruise who came along without a significant other.\nThat night, fog settles in; Eric and Nick, hearing cries out on the water, discover and rescue a shipwrecked fisherman named Bert. Bert informs them that he wrecked offshore Dog Island, the home of lumber baroness Ida Parsons, who has used her family fortune to hole herself up on the island for the past thirty-five years; only making two annual voyages onto the mainland for necessary supplies, and never speaking to anyone during these trips. Recovering from the onset of hypothermia, Bert tells the quintet a campfire story about the savagery of the wild dogs which roam Ida's island, acting as her sentries.

The next morning, Sandy and Eric go off onto the island, hoping that Ida Parsons will help them get back to the mainland. Shortly after they leave the beach, Bert goes into shock, and Donna desperately tries to warm him. Seconds later, the same figure which killed Nick sneaks up behind Donna and Bert, fatally hurling Donna against a rock wall and decapitating Bert.\nAt the center of the island, Sandy and Eric discover Ida's fortified cabin, as well as the fact that all of Ida's dogs have died long ago, their mutilated skeletons lying in their pens. In Ida's boathouse, the duo discover Carla alive hiding under a tarp; she apparently washed up at another point on the beach and made it to the compound in the middle of the night.\nIn the course of exploring Ida's compound, Eric, Sandy and Carla discover a dust-covered nursery full of antique toys, and a cobweb-covered crib; they also discover Ida Parson's diary, which contains insane, rambling passages about giving birth to a sick child, which she intends to keep sinless by secluding him from all the evils of the outside world. As they continue exploring the house, Sandy comes across Ida's skeletal corpse in repose in her bedroom. The group decides to collect supplies and head back to the shore to collect the rest of their party so they can formulate an escape from the island in Ida's old rowboat. While exploring the basement, they discover the corpses of Nick and Donna and flee to the beach in a panic.\nEric and Sandy deduce that Ida Parson's 35-year-old mutant son was the one behind the murders, left insane by his life of solitude under the care of the imbalanced Ida. With nothing to do but learn from Ida and explore the wilderness, he has become immensely strong, a capable tracker and hunter, and is thoroughly convinced that all outsiders are a threat to him and his mother. With the death of Ida, he was left without any basis for reality and ended up eating the dogs to survive.\nEric and Sandy go back to the house and get the matches that Sandy dropped earlier.

Sandy manages to lure the man into Ida's boathouse, which she sets on fire; although severely burned in the blaze, he still manages to attack Sandy, chasing her up a hill where she yanks a sharp signpost from the ground and impales him.

This illusion was based on the creation of American history in films; what is seen on screen is usually what they want you to believe and not actually the truth.  Made during a time of heavy war propaganda, Hollywood created its own version of America and its freedoms.\nIllusions follows a young woman working at National Studios in Hollywood, very rare during that time. As the film progresses and we see this woman, Mignon Dupree, create the illusion of talent among white film stars while a young African American girl, Esther Jeeter, actually sings the part for the film. Dubbing of voices was not uncommon during those times but the use of dubbing voices using African American stars for a white performer and audience only shows the great divide between the races during that time.\nOver the course of the film Mignon talks a lot about the illusion of Hollywood and the different levels of society that it creates in film and in real life. It is hinted throughout the movie, like when Esther tells Mignon, \u201cOh don't worry....they can't tell like we can,\u201d that there is a secret that she is hiding. It is not until the final scene when the Lieutenant opens her mail to find a picture of Mignon's African American boyfriend that it is clear to the audience that she has been passing as a white woman and is actually an African American woman, just like the young girl Esther Jeeter that they use at their whim.\nDash's film hints on more illusions than just Miss Dupree's.  Not only has Mignon created her own illusion but she is also a direct participant in Hollywood's. Mignon not only works in a field of illusions, working on sound dubbing in Hollywood and directly contributing to the industry's absence of African Americans in film but also the absence of African American women in film and the work industry.  Mignon is given a certain amount of power in her office but was still below her male counterparts, like the Lieutenant.  When she is discovered to not be a white woman, she is placed at a lower standard and it is certain that she would be let go if anyone else had found out. Mignon has created not only opportunities as an African American but as a woman.\nDash has done the same in similar fashion by being one of the first African American women filmmakers to make it in the industry. Her work efforts have created illusions not only for the characters on screen but her audiences too.  She has introduced many themes such as gender, sexuality and race; that other filmmakers have not touched before.\nThe film ends with Miss Dupree thinking to herself that she will get just as far as the white men and women that surround her.

Exercises of the US Navy are held in the same area. The main element of the American exercises is training for the attack on the Soviet squadron from a multipurpose nuclear submarine. A special Hughes computer is capable of launching missiles at targets previously programmed into warheads, without human intervention. The computer provides full automation of the launching process of guided missiles. However, to start it is necessary to unlock the control panel in the cabin of the submarine commanded by Turner.\nThe crew of the air tanker under the command of Major Gennady Volk performs the usual task of aerial refueling of the reconnaissance aircraft in the exercise area. The commander of Northern Fleet aviation, Major General Pavlov, intends to select the most capable pilots for retraining for new aircraft. Curious about Volk, he replaces the co-pilot before departure. For some unknown reason, Volk nevertheless refuses re-training and further promotion, trying to advance the navigator of his crew, Sergei Skiba.\nThe Tu-16 refuels reconnaissance aircraft, and at this time meets the American anti-submarine aircraft P-3 Orion, which covers Turner's submarine. It turns out that its commander, Major Armstrong, and Volk are \u201cold acquaintances\u201d. Pilots communicate on the air.\nIn the meantime, a state of emergency occurs on the submarine - reactor specialist Alan detects a leak in the reactor's cooling circuit. Turner intends not to surface the submarine and orders Alan to fix the damage. However, the failure cannot be fixed, and the submarine is forced to surface. She is discovered by the Soviet forces, but the Americans claim that everything is in order.\nAlan, who received the strongest dose of radiation, understands that help can only be received from the Soviet military. Therefore, he sneaks into the cabin of the captain and removes the lock from the fire control system. Then he rushes into the radio room and, having pushed the signalman out, sends the SOS signal. But when Alan tries to escape from the submarine on a raft, Turner kills Alan.\nSoviet reconnaissance aircraft are tracking the SOS from the submarine and recording elevated levels of radiation. After a meeting, the commander of the Northern Fleet, Admiral Spirin, decides to send a Tu-16 aircraft to the submarine, carrying a boat and a group of repairmen. They are to be delivered to the target by the plane of Captain Gremyachkin - Volk's second pilot. However, halfway to the target, Gremyachkin's plane encounters a strong counter-flow of air. He does not have enough fuel to complete the task. Only Volk's plane can refuel it, but then he will have almost no fuel left. In the end, Spirin orders Volk to \"stand in a circle\" and wait for Gremyachkin's aircraft.\nMeanwhile, the commander of the American squadron, Admiral Rink, receives information that Soviet forces sent a rescuer to Turner's submarine. Americans can not allow the Soviet military to get on the submarine, but they have no legal basis to prevent this. A plane from the United States cannot fly because of the weather, and Turner is 8 hours flying time away from Greenland. Therefore, Rink makes a decision - to disrupt the rescuer's refueling.\nWhen Volk and Gremyachkin start docking, Armstrong's plane appears next to it. Orion takes up position in front of Soviet aircraft and tries to prevent them from docking by directing turbulent jets from the engines towards them. Armstrong is sure of impunity - in neutral airspace, Soviet aircraft will not fire at him. However, Volk gives the order to prepare for precautionary shooting, and the crews manage to dock and transfer fuel. Gremyachkin's aircraft safely flies off. Volk accelerates, and nearly stalls Armstrong himself.\nGremyachkin's plane reaches the target and drops the boat with repairmen. However, Turner refuses to let them on board and orders a sailor to give a warning burst of fire.\nMeanwhile, American sailors are trying to eliminate the malfunction, but a fire begins in the reactor compartment. The voltage drops in the computer's circuits, and the weapons officer orders to turn it off. This leads to a short circuit, and the computer issues a weapon system command to fire a missile salvo at Soviet ships, the target data having been entered during the exercise. The command to prevent the launch does not work, since Alan entered permission to launch from the captain's panel. Turner does not have time to turn on the lock again and the submarine launches two missiles at the Soviet squadron. Automatic reloading of weapons for a second salvo begins ...\nSoviet ships detect the incoming missiles. The SAMs on the flagship aircraft carrier Kiev destroy the missiles. Yak-38 aircraft take off from Kiev in order to sink the American nuclear submarine which fired the missiles. But Admiral Rink communicates with Spirin and convinces him to postpone the attack for 10 minutes explaining that the launch of the missiles is a consequence of a malfunction, the Americans themselves will sink the submarine after the crew leaves it. Spirin agrees with the words: \u201cIf in 10 minutes they do not sink the submarine, then we will\u201d.\nThe crew is evacuated from the submarine, which goes to the bottom. The missile cruiser Kirov (065th) is ordered to take on board Soviet specialists.\nMeanwhile, Major Volk's aircraft runs out of fuel, in glide mode, it is approaching the coast. Skiba finds a solution - land on an old German advance airfield from the Second World War. The crew manages to do this. The plane receives minor damage, and the crew get off with light injuries.\nAfter some time, the whole crew meets at the apartment of General Pavlov. During the evening, Pavlov\u2019s wife tells Volk's wife why he refuses to re-train on new aircraft: 8 years ago, Volk's missile carrier aircraft crashed on takeoff and caught fire. Skiba pulled Volk out of the burning plane, but was badly injured, almost missing a leg. After long-term treatment and effort from Volk, Skiba was allowed to fly, but only on auxiliary wing aircraft. However, Skiba himself this evening reports to General Pavlov about leaving to the reserve, freeing Volk from \"obligations\".

But their party is interrupted when Gary's parents return home and pandemonium ensues.\nA love triangle develops between Gary, Rick, and Karen, a beautiful new virginal student who Rick is determined to have sex with. Gary first sees her one night at an ice cream parlor, then in the school lunchroom, and asks David to find out where she lives. The next morning, in an attempt to get closer to her, he punctures her bike tires and invites her to ride to school with him. During and after the ride, he makes multiple attempts to woo her, much to her indifference. That evening, Gary attends a party at David's house and is devastated to find Karen in close company with Rick. He tries to entice her away from his friend but she treats him with blank disinterest. He becomes drunk and makes a fool of himself, falling about, then creates an embarrassing scene in front of his parents' dinner guests when he goes home.  \nOne day Gary delivers pizza to Carmela, a glamorous Latina woman whose sailor boyfriend is never home, and she tells him she wants more than just pizza. Being too afraid to follow up on it, he goes away and convinces his friends to go along with him. She promptly copulates with Rick and David, but her boyfriend Paco returns home just as Gary is about to have his turn, prompting them to flee.\nIn order to keep Rick and Karen apart, Gary and David persuade Rick to join them in patronizing a tart-tongued streetwalker known to work a busy highway corner in the neighborhood. Gary's encounter with her is awkward and unpleasant, causing him to vomit.  The next day at school, all three boys realize they've contracted crab lice from the prostitute, and after trying unsuccessfully to drown them in a public swimming pool, they have to bring their problem to an amused middle-aged pharmacist.  \nEventually, after Karen and Rick have sex, she becomes pregnant, and he callously dumps her.  Enraged Gary confronts Rick in the school library and a physical fight occurs, with Rick calling Gary jealous and Gary denouncing Rick as a lowlife.  Gary decides to help Karen pay for an abortion by selling most of his possessions and borrowing money from his boss. After the abortion, Gary and Karen spend the remainder of the weekend alone together in Gary's grandmother's house. While nursing her back to health, Gary tells Karen that he sincerely loves her. Karen appears to reciprocate and they both share a tender kiss. Karen invites Gary to her 18th birthday party the following week. Gary scrapes up a few more dollars and buys Karen a gold locket for her birthday.\nWhen Gary arrives at the party, his dreams of a lasting romance with Karen are shattered when he walks in on her making out with Rick again. Despite what Rick had put Karen through, and despite Gary's devotion and support, she's rejected Gary to reunite with the slick-talking ladies' man. Gary sadly leaves the party without saying a word to either of them, taking Karen's gift with him.

Marty meets with the movie's director Stanley Kline, and his personal assistant Susan Archer, where they reveal that all of them have received the same notes that Jana and Bret received. But when Marty takes his suspicions to the police, they think that Bret's disappearance is another publicity stunt. The next day, Marty gets a letter from Bret to meet him in a theater screening room. When Bernestein shows up, he also is murdered.\nWhile Jana attends more press conferences, Vinny goes to a nightclub where he attacks a stripper after seeing her as Jana.

The Unicorn journeys to find them.\nThe Unicorn is captured by the witch Mommy Fortuna and displayed in her Midnight Carnival. Most of the attractions are normal animals enhanced by illusions to appear as mythical beasts. Fortuna uses a spell to create another horn on the unicorn's head, as the carnival visitors cannot see her real form. Fortuna keeps the immortal harpy Celaeno captive as well, deeming the risk secondary to the deed's prestige. The unicorn is befriended by Schmendrick, an incompetent magician in the service of Mommy Fortuna. With the help of Schmendrick, the Unicorn escapes, in the process freeing Celaeno, who kills Fortuna. The Unicorn and Schmendrick gain a second traveling companion with Molly Grue, the careworn lover of Captain Cully (the disappointing reality behind the myth of Robin Hood).\nWhen the Unicorn nears the seaside castle of King Haggard, keeper of the Red Bull, she encounters the beast, a monstrous fire elemental. Before she can be captured, Schmendrick uses his unpredictable magic, transforming her into a woman. The Red Bull loses interest in her and departs, but the Unicorn is shocked by the sensation of mortality. Schmendrick promises to return her to normal after the quest is complete.\nSchmendrick, Molly Grue, and the now-human Unicorn proceed to the castle. Haggard is at first unwelcoming. Schmendrick introduces the Unicorn as Lady Amalthea, and requests that they become members of Haggard's court, only to be told that the only occupants of the castle are Haggard, his adopted son Prince L\u00edr and four ancient men-at-arms. Haggard consents to lodge the trio, replacing his more competent wizard, Mabruk, with Schmendrick, and setting Molly Grue to work in his scullery. Mabruk leaves after recognizing \"Amalthea\" for what she truly is, jeering that by allowing her into his castle Haggard has invited his doom. Due to her new human emotions, Amalthea begins forgetting her true self and falls in love with Prince L\u00edr, and considers abandoning her quest in favor of mortal love. Haggard confronts Amalthea, hinting at the location of the unicorns, yet from the waning magic in her eyes, has doubts regarding his suspicions that she is more than she seems.\nMolly finally learns the location of the Red Bull's lair from the castle's cat. Molly, Schmendrick, and Amalthea are joined by L\u00edr as they enter the bull's den, and are trapped there by Haggard. Schmendrick explains to L\u00edr what they are looking for and reveals Amalthea's true identity. L\u00edr declares that he loves her anyway. This makes Amalthea want to abandon the quest and marry L\u00edr, but L\u00edr dissuades her. The Red Bull appears, no longer deceived by Amalthea's human form, and chases after her. Schmendrick turns Amalthea back into the Unicorn, but she is unwilling to leave L\u00edr's side. The Bull begins driving her toward the ocean just as he had driven the other unicorns. L\u00edr tries defending her, but is killed by the Bull. Enraged, the Unicorn turns on the Bull and forces him into the sea. As the beast is engulfed by the water, the missing hundreds of unicorns emerge from the raging sea, carried on the incoming tides. With their release, Haggard's castle collapses into the sea, and Haggard, watching all from the battlements, falls to his death.\nOn the beach, the Unicorn magically revives L\u00edr before she leaves him.

The older woman produces a letter and asks the boy to give it to his mother. They came near the gate of the same mansion the older man visited 45 years later, and the grandmother leaves the boy there. The gate is locked but a woman greets the boy. He gives her the letter, saying it is for his mother, and she lets him in. His grandmother, who has continued to watch discreetly from a distance, leaves the area once she knows he has been admitted. The younger woman escorts the boy into the house. The older man, who appears to have traveled back in time to observe, watches them although they apparently can't see him.\nAfter they enter the house, another woman who appears to be serving as a business manager greets them. After being told about the letter for Anna, the boy's mother, the manager dispatches the first woman to find Anna. Meanwhile, many women in the house are hard at work preparing for what appears to be an important upcoming event, cleaning and arranging flowers. The boy is escorted off to a side room by the manager. She questions the boy who says that his grandmother left him there to stay with his mother. The grandmother is on her way back to Santa Catarina, Brazil. The manager seems shocked by the idea of the boy staying with his mother, but it isn't immediately clear why. Anna appears and embraces her son, commenting on how much more like a man he now is than he was the last time she saw him a year ago. The boy apparently usually lives with his grandmother, not Anna.\nThe boy waits in the foyer as preparations for the event continue. There are a large number of attractive women in the house, some of whom comment on or make flirtatious glances in the boy's direction. Meanwhile, Anna discusses the letter with the manager. In the letter, the grandmother--Anna's mother--has various complaints about Anna. The primary issue, though, seems to be that Anna generally provides full support for the Santa Catarina household. Anna's mother is angry that no money has been forthcoming for the last few months, a shortfall Anna attributes to having recently bought a house. As Anna and the manager continue to talk, it becomes increasingly apparent that the large mansion they are in may serve as some kind of brothel. The mansion is owned by someone named Dr. Osmar, and the women apparently make a lot of money off of Dr. Osmar and other wealthy men. Dr. Osmar is currently most attracted to Anna, although he was formerly interested in the manager. This is the reason why Anna is now wealthy enough to buy a house herself as well as support her mother's household in Santa Catarina.\nAs the activities in the house are illegal, it is dangerous to allow a twelve year old boy to stay there. But Anna has no local family to send him to. They can return the boy--with some money to appease Anna's mother--to Santa Catarina, but need a plan for what to do until after the upcoming event. Meanwhile, in the foyer, one of the women approaches the boy, makes eyes at him, and then returns to a group of women standing on the balcony. The boy looks very self conscious. The manager--now referred to as the brothel's madam--summons a woman named Therese and instructs her to create a makeshift bedroom for the boy in the attic. Anna then escorts the boy past the group of women on the balcony, who continue to snigger at the thought of a young boy staying there. Anna scolds them for this. Anna takes the boy to her room, which appears especially opulent. The boy seems to recognize there is something unusual about the house, but is too innocent so far to realize its true nature. Anna identifies the madam as Laura, saying only vaguely that the women help Laura with various things. They discuss the letter and the trip, where apparently Anna's mother was complaining about money. Anna's mother also had some unspecified complaints about the boy's behavior. Anna tells the boy to take a bath and change clothes.\nAfter the boy--Hugo--finishes his bath, Anna gives him a towel. He covers his private parts as he emerges from the bath, and Anna says it is now her turn. The same woman who had been previously eyeing Hugo approaches his room. She opens her robe to reveal full frontal nudity. Hugo's eyes widen but he soon closes the door. Hugo then spies on Anna as she is taking her bath, observing Anna nude. The scene switches back briefly to the older man reflecting back on the past. Anna then escorts Hugo to his space in the attic. They pass a young, topless, woman and the woman and Anna glare at each other. In the attic, Anna promises Hugo that eventually they will have their own house together, but that Hugo might have to return to his grandmother for a short time. This upsets Hugo. Someone--possibly Dr. Osmar--arrives and Anna leaves. Shortly after, Hugo observes the topless woman, Tamara, being instructed as to the role she must play for a new customer. She is to take on the role of an innocent virgin who speaks mostly German and is therefore not that communicative in Portuguese, the language the characters mostly speak in Brazil.\nAnna and Laura then talk on the patio with Dr. Osmar, who arrived earlier. Dr. Osmar is a major political figure preparing for the Brazilian election then scheduled for Jan 3, 1938. To win the election, however, he needs an alliance with another man who is coming to the brothel a little later as a client. The prospective ally likes to present a Puritan image. The plan appears to be to show the man a good time, but put him at risk of future blackmail so that he feels some pressure to agree to the alliance. The potential ally is to be offered the chance to sleep with Tamara, who is said to always sexually feel like a virgin even though she is not. That is why she will be able to get away with claiming to be a virgin. Dr. Osmar is offered the chance to sleep with Tamara first, with Laura mentioning that if she is wrong she can always get a refund from the brothel Tamara is on loan from. Tamara then arrives on the patio. She wants to work permanently in this brothel, but to do so would need to relocate her entire family, and she wants Dr. Osmar's help on this.\nAnna and Dr. Osmar then have sex for an extended period while Hugo watches--from his vantage point in the attic Hugo appears to be able to spy on activities in a number of rooms in the house. Witnessing Anna having sex, Hugo seems to realize for the first time the true nature of the house and his mother's line of work, and starts crying. After sex, Anna and Dr. Osmar listen to a radio broadcast about the growing fascist alliance of the time between Hitler and Mussolini, implying that Dr. Osmar is a would-be leader of a Brazilian fascist government that would ally with the Axis if given the chance. The woman who has previously shown interest in Hugo arrives in the attic, complaining that all the men who patronize the brothel are slimy characters and implying she wants the chance to have sex with someone more wholesome like Hugo. She undresses and Hugo starts fondling her breasts. After another woman approaches and starts crying, for unknown reasons, she retreats to the roof. Soon after she comes back, puts her robe back on, and leaves.\nDr. Osmar talks with Anna about his need to be increasingly discreet when it comes to any association with the brothel. There will be increasing focus on his activities until after the election. He has asked Laura not to send anyone from the brothel to his office. He talks about the great uncertainty of the times, but says he will still provide Anna with a house. This appears to create some dispute with Anna. She wants a house, but would prefer the small house that she is purchasing herself but that she will own outright to a rented mansion provided by Dr. Osmar.\nThe planned event then begins that evening. A live band has been hired to provide entertainment. A group of mostly well dressed men arrives at the party in two cars. Their apparent leader, a man wearing a tuxedo, is introduced to other guests as Dr. Benicio, the prospective political ally of Dr. Osmar. A group of women work on getting Tamara ready for her encounter with Dr. Benicio as Hugo continues to take in events from his upstairs vantage point. One of Dr. Osmar's associates receives a call suggesting a potential threat to his plans, but Dr. Osmar goes ahead with a speech announcing the political alliance and what it means for the future of Brazil. Tamara asks Hugo, who is watching her, to come over. She says that she is dressing the way she is due to her being a present for someone, presumably Dr. Benicio. Tamara also invites Hugo to fondle her bare breasts, which he does. Dr. Benicio expresses his appreciation for the invitation to the event, commenting that it is rare that he gets invited to such events--it is unclear as yet whether he realizes this is a brothel. Hugo continues to fondle Tamara until Anna arrives and angrily dispatches Hugo back to the attic. Anna tells Hugo that she has to work in this job for a little while longer because the world runs on money and she needs the money so they can have a good life. Anna instructs Hugo to get ready for bed, stay in the attic, and not talk to anyone.\nDr. Osmar continues to discuss the potential alliance with the other men. Soon a large crate wrapped up as a present is brought into the party and described as a present for Dr. Benicio. Someone--presumably Tamara--in a teddy bear costume emerges from the crate and gradually begins to undress. Hugo continues to watch from above. Hugo finds some kind of hidden crawlway or space with a way to descend to a lower level where he is able to more closely witness various prostitutes having sex with men. Tamara then retreats to a private room with Dr. Benicio. The resourceful Hugo finds his way into a crawlspace adjacent to their room to spy on them, but isn't entirely quiet, making some noise that attracts the attention of Dr. Benicio. Dr. Benicio investigates, putting his hand into the crawlspace, but is seemingly unable to touch or see Hugo. Still, he remains suspicious, perhaps thinking they are bugged, and asks Tamara what is going on. Tamara then feigns little knowledge of Portuguese, retreating into German. Dr. Benicio then openly voices his suspicions, mentioning a friend who was photographed having sex in order to blackmail him, and wondering if the same thing is happening to him. Tamara tries to reassure him that they only want to please him, but he pushes her away.\nDr. Osmar, in bed with Anna, expresses confidence that his plan will work. Meanwhile Hugo moves from spying on Tamara to spying on Anna, enjoying Anna's increasing physical arousal. Hugo returns to his attic and goes to bed, dreaming of sex with first one woman and then a group of about six women. He starts to masturbate while in bed to these images.\nThe next morning an associate of Dr. Osmar arrives at the house. In an angry and urgent mood, he demands to speak with Dr. Osmar, who is still in bed with Anna. Once Dr. Osmar is roused from sleep, he is told that some kind of coup, similar to 1932, has happened. Dr. Osmar tells Anna that the coup will likely lead to his needing to go to France in exile, but he expresses hope it could be a happy exile with Anna. He writes Anna a check and says they will talk more in the afternoon. Tamara gets dressed and leaves the room of Dr. Benicio who remains fully dressed. She goes up to the attic, undresses, and climbs into bed with Hugo. They start having engaging in foreplay. Dr. Osmar wakes Dr. Benicio and tells him about the coup, saying he must leave. As Tamara prepares to mount Hugo and have sex with him in the cowgirl position, Anna approaches. Tamara quickly gets out of bed and puts her robe back on. It is still obvious to Anna what has been going on, and she fights Tamara, slapping her several times. Dr. Osmar, Dr. Benicio, and the men who work for them then leave the house in a hurry.\nAnna tells Hugo that he will need to return to his grandmother, although Anna will send her mother more money. Anna says that staying in the brothel wouldn't be good for Hugo, but he has trouble understanding and starts to cry. Anna tries to comfort him, then removes her robe revealing her nude body to Hugo. Anna then allows her son Hugo to make love to her. A political figure, apparently newly empowered by the coup, arrives at the house and somewhat vaguely promises to continue to protect the brothel from the law. A car arrives to return Hugo to his grandmother's house in Santa Catarina. The scene shifts back to the present day, where it is revealed that the older man in the house is donating the house to charity.

While hitchhiking to her sister's home in San Francisco, she is picked up by two benevolent young men, Hank and Tom. In the backwoods, they pick up a Baptist preacher and his adult daughter, Sandra, who they drop off at a cemetery to visit the grave of the preacher's wife. Sandra says a prayer and heads back toward their house; her father remains, and is stabbed to death by a man with a machete. Later, Sandra finds her father's corpse on their doorstep, and is also murdered by the man with the machete.\nAt a local bar, Tom, Hank, and Nancy encounter racists who refuse to serve them because Hank is African-American. Short on money, they steal groceries from a small market and are chased by two local police officers. They lose the police by driving onto a dirt road into the woods. Upon stopping, they witness a man in the woods carrying a large object draped with a sheet. Not wanting to be caught by police, they ultimately decide to camp in the woods overnight.\nIn the morning, Nancy goes for a walk, and returns to the campsite to witness two police officers, Luke and Abraham, arresting Hank and Tom, accusing them of murdering a local woman. The police shoot Hank and Tom to death execution style, and then pursue Nancy, who flees into the woods. She comes across a farmhouse, and inside finds a teenage girl, Cynthia, playing cards. She asks for a phone, and is directed to another room; when she enters, she finds the man she, Tom, and Hank saw earlier (whom she comes to find is named Cyrus) dismembering two corpses. She is confronted by the two officers, who lock her in an animal cage next to another victim, Gwen. In conversation, Gwen recounts how Luke and Abraham murdered two police officers the night before and stole their uniforms. Luke, Abraham, and Cyrus return to the campsite and burn the bodies of Hank and Tom. Later, Luke goes upstairs and has a conversation with his dead mother, a decomposed corpse the family keeps in a bed.\nMeanwhile, Bert reports Nancy missing and begins searching for her himself. At the farmhouse, the family conduct a Black Mass at midnight and sacrifice Sharon, another local woman they have kidnapped, in the name of Satan. Observing the mass from a cage, Nancy prays to God as they slit Sharon's throat before feeding her blood to their dead mother, attempting to resurrect her. Luke and Abraham drive Sharon's body to a field the next morning and begin digging a shallow grave, an event witnessed by Bert, who stumbles upon the scene; he hears them discuss sacrificing Nancy and Gwen on Easter.\nAt their next Black Mass, Cynthia sacrifices Gwen, while Nancy quietly recites the Lord's Prayer. This time, Luke drinks Gwen's blood himself. After the mass, Luke prepares to bring Gwen's body outside, but is accosted by Bert, who clobbers him. Bert holds Abraham and Cyrus at gunpoint, and forces Abraham to retrieve Nancy. Just as Nancy is brought outside, Cynthia attacks Bert, stabbing him to death. As he collapses, his gun discharges, shooting and killing both Cyrus and Abraham. Nancy flees into a barn and is chased by Cynthia, but Nancy manages to overpower her and slash her throat with a sickle. Nancy proceeds to pour gasoline on Luke, who has regained consciousness, and lights him on fire.

To assist him, Deborah writes to Lord Ames, the richest man in England. Charles reluctantly calls at their enormous mansion. The place has so many rooms that Slatterthwaite, the longtime butler, constantly has trouble finding his way about. He does eventually manage to bring Charles to the Ameses. Lord Ames loathes missionaries (among other things), but Lady Ames is inclined to contribute, especially as she finds him attractive (and tells him so).

Carvalho interviews a former CIA chief who is severely handicapped after losing his arms and legs in Vietnam, but the wheelchair-using old man refuses to co-operate.\nThose sharing the podium with the slain Garrido could have killed him only by stabbing him in the back so they are discarded as possible suspects. Because the crime took place in a short period of time and in darkness, Carvalho's suspicions quickly narrow to five members of the Communist Party: Sep\u00falveda, Esparza Julv\u00e9, P\u00e9rez Montesa, Leverder and Ordo\u00f1ez. The detective questions them one by one. Ordo\u00f1ez, the eldest among them, is quickly discarded by both Fonseca and Carvalho and so is Leverder. While following Leverder to a public reading, Carvalho is seduced by a journalist. This is actually a trap and Carvalho is drugged and beaten by CIA agents who want to know what he has found out, but Carvalho still has no answers to give them. Released by his captors, Carvalho returns to his hotel's room. A central European female agent, working for the KGB, is waiting for him. She is also interested in finding the culprit through Carvalho, who flirts with her.\nSep\u00falveda has the theory that the killer found his way to Garrido in the darkness thanks to the smoke of his cigarette. However, Santos confirms that Garrido was not smoking when he was killed. Garrido's last photograph and the examination of the items he was carrying when he was killed leads Carvalho to the conclusion that it was an insignia of a harmonica he was wearing on his lapel that helped the killer find his target in the dark. Esparza Julv\u00e9, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of both Garrido and Santos, has been experiencing severe economic hardship, and while on a trip to Germany was contacted by CIA agents who hired him to kill the communist leader for money. Carvalho confirms the identity of the killer, forcing the handicapped man to reveal what he knows by filling his mouth with bullets and pushing his wheelchair out into the street among traffic. He whispers the name to Carvalho, after having swallowed the bullets out of fear.\nAll along, Carvalho has been flirting with Carmela. She invites him to her apartment while her husband and her son are away. As they begin to kiss, they are interrupted by the KGB agent, who presses Carvalho once again about his investigation. At that very moment Carmela's husband enters the apartment, stopping the questioning. Carvalho unmasks Esparza Julv\u00e9 as the killer. At a new meeting of the Central Committee, Esparza Julv\u00e9 is cast aside by the members of the Communist Party who are now aware of his culpability. Esparza Julv\u00e9 tries to leave the building, but he is killed at the door by those who had hired him to assassinate Garrido.

They purchase 1,255 square yards of taffeta (claiming it is for a camping club); G\u00fcnter sews the fabric together with a sewing machine in his attic and Peter experiments for months to construct a hot air balloon burner. Of course, they face setbacks: fires while trying to inflate the balloon, struggles to build a burner with sufficient power, extremely suspicious neighbors, and doubts about the plan's workability from G\u00fcnter's wife, Petra.\nEventually, Peter and G\u00fcnter then stop seeing each other, to avoid suspicion for when the Strelzyks escape.

Initially distraught over his failure, Peter is convinced by his sons to try again, as they did fly and no one was hurt, and now the Stasi will stop at nothing to find them.

What is that mirror in which the image remains captured, what is that mirror that conjures up new confrontations again and again? What are these phantoms, this stereotypes that are produced by film? In my earlier films I have tried to avoid these stereotypes. In this film, however, I have chosen for a linear structure. After two minutes the plot has become entirely clear. Then I show various situations, by using cinematic techniques, us applied by French avant-garde directors in the 1920s and 1930s. That is to say, I used slow-motion, different lenses and similar techniques. Notwithstanding the narrative structure, one can say that it deals with a dream, a nightmare. The film deals with the imaginary, a kind of fear. Maybe not a collective fear, but my personal fear, as someone born in a Latin-American country. This is a personal film, because it has to do with my memories\".", "tmdb_id": 126420}, "22803031": {"title": "Once Upon a Dog", "plot": "The day comes when an old watchdog becomes useless but the masters, being kind, decide not to drive him away.

Hurtado is taken by ambulance to a luxurious penthouse by his drivers Perfecto and Ever, accompanied by Florencia, a nurse and their friend. At the office, Dr. Hughes explains to Adolfo that his father suffers from a rare blood disease which is poisoning him and has given him a monstrous appearance (which would alter his sanity) as well as Thrombocytopenic purpura. The only treatment is the constant transfusion of blood while it is young and healthy men.\nThe next day, Perfecto goes to get the blood to the blood bank, leaving Adolfo, his boss, in the car, and when he hears the news of the murder, he finds the photos revealed by Perfecto. Adolfo steals them and leaves the envelope on the hood of the car. Perfecto, that night, he realizes that Adolfo stole the photos the moment Ever and Florencia ask him to see them. Adolfo, after confirming the responsibility of the three employees in the murder, calls them pretending to be payday, but at the time of paying them, Adolfo indirectly blackmails his three employees; they must get the blood for their father in exchange for not revealing the photos that incriminated them in the murder. Perfect, Ever and Florencia argue about the blackmail they are now victims of, but Florencia barely convinces them to make money. In the penthouse, Adolfo informs his father Roberto about the commitments of the sugar mill they own and talks to his grandchildren by video. That same night, the three employees (Perfecto, Florencia and Ever) kidnap a shoeshine boy from the street, take him to a farm where they draw his blood and steal his few belongings, in this they find an information card about the flea, and the three decide to nickname Roberto Hurtado 'the flea' for living off blood. So then the corpse is abandoned in an almost wooded area. Florencia then arrives at the penthouse to give Roberto the stolen blood, gives him the treatments, reads him the economic sections of the newspaper and plays him movies on Betamax.\nOne night, the three employees go to a bar where they witness a singer, and Perfecto, who is homosexual, is interested in a boy who is at the bar. Ever follows him to the bathroom where she indirectly invites him to snort cocaine and to a supposed party where there will be more cocaine. The three of them, accompanied by two homosexuals, go to the farm where they consume liquor, cigarettes and cocaine and Florencia dopes the two homosexuals, making them believe that she injects them with heroin. Both are raped by Perfecto, his blood drawn by Florencia, and like the shoeshine, the two dead homosexuals are abandoned in a field.\nDuring the Day of the Little Candles, Perfecto and Florencia are forced to look for more blood, because Roberto had vomited useless blood. Both try to kidnap a child by doping him with chloroform but he escapes. Then they try to kidnap a girl but when they see her gender, they abandon her on a street, then they kidnap a destitute child from whom they draw blood. One night Roberto sees ants in the coffee sugar, prophesying a strike at the mill. This prophecy turns out to be true when they call Adolfo to notify him of the strike; the cutters refuse to burn the excess cane. Roberto is unaware that his son Adolfo is doing business with a sugar smuggler named Poncho; the drivers of the sugar trucks would be unarmed, causing the smugglers of Poncho to steal the sugar to sell it to Venezuela. Panic reigns in Cali; the corpses are found. The population and the press speculate that they are victims of the 'Monster of the mangones', an alleged serial killer who rapes young men alone or with a gang, apparently wealthy and homosexual that traffics blood.\nDuring Christmas Eve, a small tremor occurs, and once again Ever and Perfecto must go for more blood for Roberto. They kidnap another child and it is difficult to bring him up to transfer the blood to Roberto who, being doped, manages to see a bit of the origin of the blood. Adolfo's business with the smugglers is ruined because a driver was armed confronting the smugglers disguised as police, resulting in the capture of them by the real police and the seizure of the merchandise, despite being insured. Adolfo finds out about this and Poncho orders him to take action or there would be problems. Without saying anything to his father, Adolfo asks him for money to fix the problem, citing threats to the family, but Roberto, also aware of the assault flatly refuses. Roberto immediately deduces that Adolfo is behind a sugar smuggling business but Adolfo refutes him by demanding that he take command of the business while his father ignores everything including the origin of the blood that keeps him alive. Hearing this, Roberto remembers the boy whose blood was drawn, so he suffers a seizure and vomits blood. While Adolfo changes labels from a useless blood and a usable one, he goes to his office and burns various documents including the photos of the murder, takes a suicide pistol and falls on his fish tank.\nRoberto dies after receiving the wrong blood and veiled the next day.

Rocky's lack of preparation is worsened by his anger over Mickey, preventing him from fully concentrating on the fight. The match begins with Rocky pounding Lang with several huge blows looking for an early knockout, but Lang quickly recovers and takes charge, dominating Rocky and finishing him off with a haymaker left hook in the second round, winning the world heavyweight championship. After the match, Rocky tells a dying Mickey that the match ended in a second round knockout without saying who the victor was. Mickey dies right after he says \"I love ya, kid\". Rocky, lapsing into severe depression, mourns over Mickey's death.\nStopping by Mickey's closed gym, the forlorn Rocky encounters his former rival, Apollo Creed, who witnessed the match as a guest analyst. Creed offers to help train Rocky for a rematch against Lang in exchange for a future favor, which Rocky accepts. Apollo then takes Rocky to the gym where he once trained, Tough Gym in Los Angeles. Apollo quickly becomes frustrated by Rocky's lack of effort, as he is still haunted by nightmares of Lang and unable to train without Mickey by his side. However, Rocky regains his focus after Adrian helps him come to terms with Mickey's death. Apollo and his manager, Tony \"Duke\" Evers, infuse Rocky's undisciplined brawling style with more of Apollo's trademark footwork, skill and speed, rebuilding him into an entirely new fighter.\nAfter months of training, the rematch takes place at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Apollo lends Rocky the American flag trunks that he wore during their first match. At the outset of the match, Rocky sprints from his corner, battering Lang with a level of skill and spirit that no one ever expected. Rocky completely dominates the first round, leaving Lang enraged and bewildered after the bell. Lang gains the upper hand in the second round, and Rocky adopts an entirely different strategy that angers and confuses Apollo by intentionally taking a beating from Lang, even getting knocked down twice, all the while taunting Lang that he cannot knock him out. By the third round, Lang, who is used to winning matches swiftly with knockouts in the early rounds, loses his temper and starts throwing punches wildly as Rocky taunts him, gradually running out of stamina. With Lang rattled and vulnerable, Rocky strikes back with a flurry of punches, culminating in a brutal knockout to reclaim the heavyweight championship.\nAfterwards, Rocky fulfills Apollo's favor \u2014 a third, private rematch with him at Mighty Mick's Gym. The film concludes without showing the result, but freezes into an oil painting of two boxers simultaneously throwing the first punch, showing two equally skilled athletes facing each other not as rivals, but as friends.", "tmdb_id": 1371}, "32450833": {"title": "Rooster (film)", "plot": "A physically small police psychologist (Paul Williams) and a physically large insurance detective (Pat McCormick) team up on an arson case.", "tmdb_id": 799821}, "59384650": {"title": "Routes of Exile: A Moroccan Jewish Odyssey", "plot": "Beginning in ancient Morocco, the film begins by describing the Berber Jews.

He falls in love with her, although she dislikes him due to his undisciplined behaviour and disgusting look. Along with Shani, Ravi tricks Indu into believing that he is his only one younger brother. He even grooms himself as a proper human and appears before her in his new form. Indu eventually reciprocates Ravi's feelings and the two get married. \nAfter their marriage, Indu is initially happy that only the three of them live in the remote farmhouse, away from loud noise and non-cleanliness,  which leaves Ravi frightened. After entering his house, she is shocked to learn that Ravi has five more brothers, all uncivilized and uncouth, but agrees to stay on their request. Shani and the brothers struggle to adjust with a new girl in their lives and so does Indu, who grooms them all too as proper humans and plans to civilize them. Few days later, the brothers meet six sisters at a beach and respectively fall in love with each one, and the feeling is mutual. The sisters are the caretakers of Seema Singh (Ranjeeta Kaur), a wealthy heiress who is unable to walk due to paraplegia. Her uncle Ranjit Singh (Amjad Khan) has devious plans of murdering her in order to gain the possession of her ancestral property. He gets a prisoner Babu Sharma (also Amitabh Bachchan) released from jail and hires him to kill Seema. \nMeanwhile, Ravi is saddened to see that the brothers are terribly missing their love interests, and are thus unable to concentrate on their work. In order to make them feel better, he unintentionally helps them break into the girls' house and kidnap them all with Seema. Indu is irked with Ravi and the brothers, but agrees to let the girls stay. Soon, Ranjit learns about Seema's visit to the farmhouse and invites Ravi to his house to help him collect some clothes and medicines for Seema. \nDuring their meeting, he is shocked to see that Ravi is an exact doppelganger of Babu. Taking advantage of this, Ranjit sends Babu to impersonate Ravi with an exchange of one lakh rupees in order to have him murder Seema. Ravi is captured and imprisoned at a remote island by Ranjit's henchmen. Undergoing a complete makeover, Babu transforms himself into Ravi whose car and other belongings are obtained by him as well. Babu then goes to live in Ravi's house where he is shocked to learn that Indu is pregnant with Ravi's child. However, he is quickly accepted by Indu and the brothers as no one suspects a thing. Meanwhile, Ranjit makes Ravi suffer a lot at the island and plans to frame him for Seema's murder. \nAt Ravi's house, Babu grabs an opportunity and is about to murder Seema with his dagger but due to the shock, she regains the control of her legs and is able to walk again. On seeing everyone's happiness, Babu is eventually overcome with guilt and falls in love with Seema. During the festival of Karva Chauth, he ends up revealing his true identity and Ranjit's intentions to the family, confessing his crime and subsequent reformation to them. Shanu forgives him as he did not cause any harm to their sister-in-law Indu, who is like a mother to them. Babu then promises Indu that whether he himself lives or not, her husband will surely remain alive. \nThe next day, Babu takes the brothers to the island and tries to trick Ranjit into releasing Ravi. Ranjit outsmarts him and captures him with all the brothers, beating up Ravi badly and knocking him out. However, the brothers motivate Ravi by repeating their motto to regain consciousness and fight against Ranjit. Ravi eventually succeeds in defeating Ranjit (presumably to death) and is reunited with his brothers. Babu then decides to leave which causes a heartbroken Seema to lose the control of her legs again as she had fallen in love with him as well. Using his dagger, Babu makes her stand up from her wheelchair and Ravi also reunites with Indu, while the brothers marry their girlfriends. The films ends with all the eight couples happily embracing each other.", "tmdb_id": 33145}, "6794558": {"title": "Savannah Smiles", "plot": "Six-year-old Savannah's father, a wealthy Salt Lake City businessman, is running for the United States Senate.

Inside the Shaolin Temple, the novice Jue Yuan (Jet Li) bows before the Abbot. He is about to be accepted as a monk. The Abbot tells Jue Yuan that he must vow to not commit murder. Jue Yuan is silent. The Abbot repeats the question, and Jue Yuan slowly raises his eyes, gazing intensely at him. The Abbot asks the question a third time.\nSeveral years previously, during the rebellions at the end of the Sui dynasty, the warlord Wang Shichong rules from Luoyang and has treacherously installed himself as Emperor of the East Capitol. He is overseeing the bolstering of his riverfront defenses against the rival warlords on the opposite bank, close to the Shaolin Temple. The work of the slaves is not fast enough for him, so he orders his prisoners, who are opposing rebels, to join the slaves. These rebels include an older kung fu master and his son, Jue Yuan.\nOne day, after defending another prisoner, Jue Yuan's father draws the attention of the Emperor, who attacks him and personally kills him. Jue Yuan attempts revenge, but the Emperor seriously injures him, forcing Jue Yuan to escape to the Shaolin Temple. The Sifu (Yu Hai) is teaching the monks kung fu when Jue Yuan arrives. The Abbot proclaims that it is their holy duty as Buddhist monks to provide aid. The Sifu and his pupils nurse Jue Yuan back to health. After he recovers, Jue Yuan joins the monks in carrying water from the river to the temple, which is kung fu conditioning. He struggles, but is helped by a beautiful shepherd girl named Bai Wu Xia (Ding Lan), who is skilled at kung fu.\nJue Yuan befriends the fun-loving Sifu and his equally mischievous students. Jue Yuan learns that the Sifu is Bai Wu Xia's father and that nine years previously they fled the Emperor's soldiers, reaching the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan declares that he will kill the Emperor, and he asks the Sifu to train him in Northern Shaolin kung fu. The Sifu tells him that Shaolin kung fu is for defense, not killing, and that Jue Yuan isn't a monk. Jue Yuan says that he wants to become a monk.\nJue Yuan's head is shaven, and the Abbot ordains him as a junior monk. Jue Yuan begins Northern Shaolin kung fu training. After a time, he has gained impressive fighting abilities, but while sparring, he pictures the Emperor and nearly kills his partner. He is banned from practicing kung fu and runs away from the Shaolin Temple. Jue Yuan attempts to assassinate the Emperor, but fails and is forced to flee. Ashamed, he returns to the Shaolin Temple. His Sifu allows him to resume his Northern Shaolin kung fu training. Jue Yuan trains for more than a year, and becomes highly adept at Northern Shaolin kung fu.\nOne day, Li Shimin (son of Li Yuan) who is pursued by the Emperor enters Shaolin. The Shaolin monks make a show of helping the Emperor hunt for Li Shimin so he can escape. Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia help Li Shimin, making their way past the Emperor's patrols in disguise. A forbidden romance builds between Jue Yuan and Bai Wu Xia. The escape fails. Bai Wu Xia and an injured Li Shimin flee on a raft down the river, while Jue Yuan sacrifices himself to protect them. His Sifu and a group of Shaolin warrior monks come to his aid, saving Jue Yuan's life, but the Sifu banishes him from Shaolin. The Emperor learns what the Shaolin monks did, and marches on the Shaolin Temple with his army to destroy it.\nThe Abbot orders the monks not to fight, even as the Emperor's army surrounds the Shaolin Temple. The Abbot pleads with the Emperor for mercy and accepts the blame. He is placed on a pyre, which is set aflame. The Emperor tells the monks that if they reveal the traitors' whereabouts, he'll spare the Temple and the Abbot. He then has his men kill several of the other top monks. The Sifu and the warrior monks reveal themselves. The battle begins, and many monks are killed.\nJue Yuan and Ba Wu Xia return to the Shaolin Temple. The Emperor's army takes the outer walls and outer grounds, and kills all the monks there. The surviving monks fall back within the inner walls. The Sifu is wounded. He entreats Jue Yuan to protect Shaolin and uphold justice, and dies. The Emperor receives word that Li Shimin and his army are approaching his own East Capital, and they abandon the siege of the Shaolin Temple and ride for the East Capital instead. Jue Yuan and the warrior monks ride after the Emperor, joining the battle at the ravaged East Capital, the very site where the Emperor killed Jue Yuan's father. Jue Yuan and the Emperor duel on the shore of the great river. Jue Yuan kills the Emperor, and the battle for the East Capital is won.\nLater, Jue Yuan has returned to Shaolin Temple, where the new Abbot asks him if he can obey the vow to not murder. Jue Yuan vows that he will not kill save to uphold righteousness, and the Abbot accepts this. Jue Yuan continues to swear his vows, but when he reaches the vow of celibacy, he is again conflicted. He opens his folded palms to look at a jade amulet, recalling how Bai Wu Xia gave it to him as a token of her love. He looks up to see Bai Wu Xia, who has sneaked into the side wing of the sanctum and is staring at him. He hesitates, then vows to remain celibate, and she leaves.

Afraid that the dreams are aggravated by stress and depression, and fearful that her newfound success may be slipping away, Kay's family and friends plan a vacation for her to a small island off the coast of Georgia.

Later, Dr. McCoy visits Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits due to his age, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command instead of growing old behind a desk.\nMeanwhile, the starship Reliant is on a mission to search for a lifeless planet to test the Genesis Device, a technology designed to reorganize dead matter into habitable worlds. Reliant's Captain Clark Terrell and first officer Commander Pavel Chekov beam down to evaluate a planet they believe to be Ceti Alpha VI; once there, they are captured by the genetically engineered tyrant Khan Noonien Singh explaining that they are on Ceti Alpha V. Fifteen years prior, Kirk exiled Khan and his fellow supermen to Ceti Alpha V after they attempted to take over his ship. The neighboring planet exploded, devastating the surface of Ceti Alpha V. Khan implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous eel larvae (which killed several of his followers, including his wife) that render them susceptible to mind control, and uses them to capture Reliant. Learning of the Genesis Device, Khan attacks space station Regula I where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. Carol Marcus, and their son, David.\nKirk assumes command of Enterprise after the ship, deployed on a training cruise, receives a distress call from Regula I. En route, Enterprise is ambushed and crippled by Reliant. Khan offers to spare Kirk's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis; Kirk instead stalls for time and, taking advantage of Khan's unfamiliarity with starship controls, remotely lowers Reliant's shields, enabling a counter-attack. Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs, while Enterprise limps to Regula I. Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive, along with the slaughtered members of Marcus' team. They soon find Carol and David hiding Genesis deep inside the nearby planetoid. Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk; Terrell resists the eel's influence and kills himself, while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body. Khan transports Genesis aboard the Reliant, intending to maroon Kirk on the lifeless planetoid, but is tricked by Kirk and Spock's coded arrangements for a rendezvous. Kirk directs Enterprise into the nearby Mutara Nebula; conditions inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making Enterprise and Reliant evenly matched. Spock notes that Khan's tactics indicate inexperience in three-dimensional combat, which Kirk exploits to disable Reliant.\nMortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, quoting Captain Ahab from the novel Moby Dick as he dies. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation and attempts to move out of range, they will not be able to escape the nebula in time without the ship's inoperable warp drive. Spock goes to restore warp power in the engine room, which is flooded with radiation. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, Spock incapacitates him with a Vulcan nerve pinch and performs a mind meld, telling him to \"remember\". Spock repairs the warp drive, and Enterprise jumps to warp, escaping the explosion, which forms a new planet. Before dying of radiation poisoning, Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice himself to save the Enterprise was a logical one. Kirk and the ship's crew host a space burial for Spock, whose photon torpedo casket lands on the new Genesis planet.", "tmdb_id": 154}, "5490080": {"title": "Starstruck (1982 film)", "plot": "Sydney teenager Jackie Mullens works as a barmaid in her mother's failing pub, but dreams of becoming a singing star.

Trying to get ready to go to work, he can barely get a turn to use the bathroom in a crowded apartment he shares with his family. Other members of the household are not without their frustrations either, meaning that nagging and shouting are a staple of their home life at any time of day.\nPanti\u0107's spouse Sida (Ru\u017eica Soki\u0107) is a crabby middle-aged housewife whose complaints cover a wide range: from being unhappy about having to penny-pinch when grocery shopping to what she sees as personal lack of nice memories to look back on before old age because her best years were spent tending after the house and the family. The oldest child, son Branko (Gojko Baleti\u0107), an eternal university student majoring in astronomy, has a gripe about not having enough money for books and kits, which in his opinion prevents him from finally graduating. The middle child, daughter Mira (Danica Maksimovi\u0107), has a law degree but can not find a job despite trying for years - she's also unhappy about lack of funds in the family because she thinks the ability to dress more attractively or to outright bribe would help her finally land a job. Finally, the youngest child Aca (Aleksandar Todorovi\u0107), who is 16, has problems with discipline in high school and wants his father to buy him new textbooks and also a motorbike. Panti\u0107's household also features his cranky mother (Rahela Ferari) and a sub-tenant Suzana (Jelica Sretenovi\u0107) who is assigned there by the state due to housing shortage and given a room that takes up 9.4 m2 of their apartment.\nAll the morning commotion at home leads to Panti\u0107 often being late for work where more frustration awaits. On this particular occasion, it's his crooked boss Sre\u0107ko \u0160oji\u0107 (Milan Gutovi\u0107) barging into his office, ripping up reports and demanding Panti\u0107 has them re-typed because they're not legible enough to read.

Unbeknownst to Douglas, the \"mummy\" is not the body of a dead Egyptian, but an extraterrestrial alien in suspended animation, being wrapped up and buried alive thousands of years before and covered with a dormant, green fungus.\nThe body is brought back to California and Douglas has it examined by Dr. Ken Melrose and X-rayed by student Peter Sharpe before a big press conference about the discovery. While reviewing the X-rays, Peter notices there are five crystals around the \"mummy's\" head. Peter steals the crystals and makes new X-rays to cover up his theft. He sells four of the crystals to students who are unaware of their origin. The second set of X-rays overdose the body with radiation. This causes the fungus to re-activate and the alien to awaken from suspended animation.\nAt the press conference the next day, one of the students touches the fungus on the sarcophagus, which eats away one of his fingers. The sarcophagus is then opened in front of the press to reveal that the mummy is gone. Ken and his colleague Dr. Hayworth attempt to identify the fungus and destroy it.\nAt first, everyone assumes that the mummy's disappearance is because of a fraternity prank. However, University President Wendell Rossmore wants to pin the \"theft\" on Douglas, so that he can give the Egyptian department's directorship to his flunkie, Dr. Bruce Serrano.\nMeanwhile, the \"mummy\" tracks down the students who have the stolen crystals. The crystals are crucial components of an intergalactic transportation device that will allow the alien to return to its home planet. The alien violently reclaims its crystals, and, when he brutally attacks a female student, Lt. Plummer is called in to investigate the crime. As more students turn up dead or injured, Plummer believes that he is on the trail of a serial killer.\nWhile Plummer conducts his investigation, Douglas translates the hieroglyphic text from the sarcophagus. He hopes it will reveal the identity of the mummy. The text reveals that Tutankhamun found the alien in a coma-like state. Thinking that the unconscious alien was a god, Tutankhamun and his attendants touched it and were killed by its infectious fungus. The king and the alien were then buried together in the king's tomb. Douglas, having figured out that the \"mummy\" is an alien, makes the connection between the alien and the crystals. He then traces the stolen crystals back to Peter, who admits to the theft and gives Douglas the one crystal he kept for himself.\nIn the end Douglas, Wendall, Bruce, two students, a security guard and the alien all end up in a boiler room where the alien has set up its transportation device. The alien activates the device by placing the last recovered crystal on it; his mummy wrappings disintegrate, revealing his true form. The security guard urged by Bruce shoots at the alien, but Douglas leaps in front of the alien to protect it. As Douglas lies injured the alien takes his hand, and the two disappear. A single crystal is left where the alien stood.

Traveling to the airport, he accidentally blows up his car trying to fix a pop-out lighter, but mistakenly believes it an assassination attempt, and disguises himself in a heavy cast on the flight, which causes complications in the air and on land. He then is led to an awkward introduction to the Scotland Yard detectives at Heathrow. Meanwhile, Dreyfus learns from Scotland Yard that Libyan terrorists have marked Clouseau for assassination, but permits him to continue. At the hotel, Clouseau has a miscommunication with the hotel clerk (Harold Berens) and gets knocked out a window several times, trying to get his message from Dreyfus.\nClouseau's flight disappears over the ocean en route to Lugash, and Marie Jouvet (Joanna Lumley), a television reporter covering the story, sets out to interview those who knew him best. Among the people she interviews are Dreyfus; Hercule Lajoy (Graham Stark); Cato Fong (Burt Kwouk); and former jewel thief Sir Charles Litton (David Niven) who is married to Clouseau's ex-wife Lady Simone (Capucine).\nAll of these interview scenes provides flashbacks to scenes of earlier Pink Panther films (The Pink Panther, A Shot in the Dark, The Return of the Pink Panther, The Pink Panther Strikes Again, and Revenge of the Pink Panther); but Jouvet also interviews Clouseau's father (Richard Mulligan), at his winery in the south of France, providing glimpses of Clouseau's childhood (wherein he is played by Lucca Mezzofanti), and his early career during college, nearly leading him to commit suicide after a girl of his dreams marries another person, especially in the French Resistance (in which he is played by Daniel Peacock) involving him failing to detonate a bridge full of crossing Nazis. Jouvet also questions Mafia don Bruno Langlois (Robert Loggia), a mafia boss antagonist who would appear in the next film and tries to file a complaint against Langlois with Chief Inspector Dreyfus; but Dreyfus refuses to press charges.\nThe film ends with Marie hoping that Clouseau might be alive somewhere, as she states: \"Did Inspector Clouseau really perish in the sea, as reported? Or for reasons as yet unknown, is he out there someplace, plotting his next move, waiting to reveal himself when the time is right? I am reluctant to believe that misfortune has really struck down such a great man.\" Clouseau (played by John Taylor, who doubled Sellers in The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu) is seen glancing over a seaside cliff, when a seagull flies over and defecates on the sleeve of his coat. The words \"Swine seagull!\" are heard in the distinctive exaggerated French accent of Clouseau.\nThe next shot shows the animated Pink Panther in trench coat and trilby hat, revealed to be in place of Clouseau watching the sunset; he turns around to face the camera and flashes his coat open, but his trench coat reveals a montage of funny clips of Peter Sellers from his five Pink Panther films as a tribute to him, while the end credits roll.", "tmdb_id": 9699}, "49103845": {"title": "The Train Has Stopped", "plot": "Late at night, a train accident happens.

Within ENCOM, programmer Alan Bradley and his girlfriend, engineer Lora Baines, discover that the MCP has closed off their access to projects. When Alan confronts the senior executive vice president, Ed Dillinger, Dillinger claims that the security measures are an effort to stop outside hacking attempts. However, when Dillinger privately questions the MCP through his computerized desk, he realizes the MCP has expanded into a powerful virtual intelligence and has become power-hungry, illegally appropriating personal, business, and government programs to increase its own capabilities. Dillinger rose to the top of ENCOM by stealing video games Flynn had created, presenting them to the company as his own. The MCP blackmails Dillinger with information about his plagiarizing Flynn's games if he does not comply with its directives.\nLora deduces that Flynn is the hacker, and she and Alan go to his arcade to warn him. Flynn reveals that he has been trying to locate evidence proving Dillinger's plagiarism, which launched Dillinger's rise in the company. Together, the three form a plan to break into ENCOM and unlock Alan's \"Tron\" program, a self-governing security measure designed to protect the system and counter the functions of the MCP. Once inside ENCOM, the three split up and Flynn comes into direct conflict with the MCP, communicating with his terminal. Before Flynn can get the information he needs to reveal Dillinger's acts, the MCP uses an experimental laser to digitize and upload Flynn into the ENCOM mainframe cyberspace, where programs are living entities appearing in the likeness of the human \"Users\" (programmers) who created them.\nFlynn learns that the MCP and its second-in-command, Sark, rule and coerce programs to renounce their belief in the Users. The MCP forces programs that resist to play in deadly games and begins putting Flynn in duels. Flynn meets other captured programs, Ram and Tron, between matches. Partnered, the three escape into the mainframe during a light cycle match (an arcade game Flynn wrote the program for and is skilled at), but Flynn and Ram become separated from Tron by an MCP pursuit party. While attempting to help Ram, who was wounded in the pursuit, Flynn learns that he can manipulate portions of the mainframe by accessing his programmer knowledge. Ram recognizes Flynn as a User and encourages him to find Tron and free the system before \"derezzing\" (dying). Using his new ability, Flynn partially rebuilds a Recognizer vehicle (a construct taken from another one of Flynn's games) and later disguises himself as one of Sark's soldiers.\nTron enlists help from Yori, a sympathetic program, and at an I/O tower receives information from Alan necessary to destroy the MCP. Flynn rejoins them, and the three board a hijacked solar sailer to reach the MCP's core. However, Sark's command ship destroys the sailer, capturing Flynn and Yori and presumably killing Tron. Sark leaves the command ship and orders its deresolution, but Flynn keeps it intact by again manipulating the mainframe, while Sark reaches the MCP's core on a shuttle carrying captured programs. While the MCP attempts to absorb captive programs, Tron, who turns out to have survived, confronts Sark and critically injures him, prompting the MCP to give him all its functions. Realizing that his ability to manipulate the mainframe might give Tron an opening, Flynn leaps into the beam of the MCP, distracting it. Seeing the break in the MCP's shield, Tron attacks through the gap and destroys the MCP and Sark, ending the MCP's control over the mainframe and allowing the captured programs to communicate with users again.\nFlynn reappears in the real world, rematerialized at his terminal.

Costello reveals that her superiors threatened her with termination unless she changed the original record from \"1\" to \"9,\" but before doing so, she made a photocopy, which she brought to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the original is presumed to be correct, but Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello testifies that the anesthesiologist later confessed that he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia, which is incorrect for someone who ate only one hour prior.

Nick tries to convince Eddie to join the vigilante group, but Eddie turns Nick down, preferring to let the courts handle Rico. Nick's lack of faith in the system is proven correct when Rico is set free after his right-hand man, Prago (Don Blakely), bribes both Judge Sinclair (Vincent Beck) and Eisenburg (Joe Spinell), Rico's attorney. Enraged, Eddie attacks the judge and is sentenced to 30 days in jail.\nWith Eddie in jail, the vigilante group tracks down the source of the drugs in their neighborhood. After roughing up a small-time drug dealer (Frank Pesce) and torturing his supplier, they are led to a high-ranking member of the New York mayor's office. Meanwhile, in prison, Eddie befriends an inmate named Rake (Woody Strode) who saves him from being gang raped in the showers. As soon as Eddie is released from jail, he joins the vigilante group so he can track down and kill Rico, Prago, and Judge Sinclair. Eddie, Nick, Burke and Ramon confront Rico in his seedy apartment, where Rico denies killing Eddie's son and insists it was Prago. An unmoved Eddie shoots him dead, but narrowly escapes death when Rico's girlfriend attempts to shoot him; she wounds Burke instead, and Nick kills her in self-defense. Upon hearing about Rico's death, Prago takes over command of the gang and mistakenly assumes that dirty cops killed Rico. The following night, Prago and the gang ambush a police car and kill both cops.\nVickie is released from the hospital, but refuses to come home to Eddie and she leaves him, unable to be in the very house where their son was killed. Eddie decides to move away, too, disgusted with himself over killing a man as well as in fear that the gang will track him down. Nick unsuccessfully attempts to persuade him to stay and fight. As Eddie leaves Brooklyn, he recognizes Prago and follows him on foot. Prago soon spots Eddie and they shoot at each other. Prago hijacks a car, and Eddie steals a car to follow him. The chase leads to a local dockyard mill where both cars crash. Eddie chases Prago on foot again, then confronts him on a storage tower. Sadistic and insane to the last, Prago admits to killing Scott, and then dares Eddie to kill him; Eddie responds by throwing Prago off the tower to his death without hesitating.  Later, Eddie plants a bomb in Judge Sinclair's car, then watches from a distance as it explodes and kills Sinclair.

Some of the drovers were unhappy at first because they believed that the bush is no place for a white woman. As such, they were both wary of her and made fun of her when both she and her husband arrived. However, Jeannie was determined to prove them wrong.\nWhile her husband was away with the other men herding the cattle, Jeannie begins making friends with the Aboriginal people. Her husband and the other white men treated the local people (and Chinese workers) as inferior to them, often regarding them as lazy, indifferent, as well as unreliable.

They are taken to the close quarter battle house and witness an SAS room entry assault. Colonel Hadley introduces them to the SAS man playing the hostage, Captain Peter Skellen, and informs them they will be with Skellen's troop, consisting of Baker, Dennis, and Williamson. During an exercise in the Brecon Beacons, Hadley and Major Steele discover Skellen's troop torturing Hagen and Freund. Skellen is dismissed from the Regiment. The torture and dismissal are a ruse to repaint Skellen as a disgraced former SAS operative, and Hagen and Freund as innocent victims in the scheme.\nSkellen's intelligence contact, Ryan, advises him to meet Frankie Leith and Rod Walker, the two people who lead the People's Lobby, the terrorist group believed to be planning the act of terrorism. Skellen tells his wife that he will be going away for a while on a mission. A foreign man, Andrey Malek, arranges with a city banker for the distribution of large sums of money to organisations including the People's Lobby. Skellen arranges to meet Leith at a bar frequented by People's Lobby members, and initiates a sexual relationship with her, to the annoyance of Walker and his underlings, Helga and Mac. Leith takes Skellen to the organisation's lair and introduces him to the group. Leith appreciates Skellen's SAS background, and offers him a job as security consultant to the People's Lobby; she also allows him to move in with her.\nTo strengthen Skellen's cover story, Hadley informs Hagen and Freund of Skellen's location; the wronged men attack Skellen at Leith's home and inflict a severe beating. As a result, Leith's few remaining doubts about Skellen dissipate, but Walker and his cronies still are not fully convinced. Helga observes Skellen meeting the same unknown individual (Ryan) in various locations. Their scrutiny intensifies when Walker and his associates witness Skellen's meeting with his wife and daughter. They use photos from their surveillance to convince Leith that Skellen is not all he seems. Walker orders Helga to kill Ryan, cutting Skellen's link to Hadley.

He orders police protection for Skellen's family.\nDespite his official advisory capacity, Skellen is denied details about the upcoming People's Lobby operation. On the day of the operation, Leith and Walker instruct Helga and Mac to take Skellen's family hostage. Helga and Mac overpower the policeman on guard duty outside the Skellen home, bundling him inside as an additional hostage with Skellen's wife and child. Leith uses this to blackmail Skellen into unconditional co-operation.\nThe terrorists and Skellen arrive at the US Ambassador's residence in a hijacked coach. Wearing stolen US Air Force uniforms, they gain entry to the secure compound and take hostages of the US Ambassador, the US Secretary of State, the Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Air Command (SAC), and the British Foreign Secretary, along with their wives and the residence staff. Hadley and his police counterpart, Commander Powell, arrive at the residence to receive the demands of the terrorists: unless a US nuclear missile is launched at Holy Loch naval base, all the hostages will be killed. Currie questions Leith's motivations, and Leith responds that her ultimate goal is the total disarmament of the whole world. This opens a debate about method and political philosophy that only antagonises the terrorists.\nMeanwhile, Dennis and three fellow SAS troopers arrive at Skellen's home. They set up in the attached house next door, using audio and video devices to covertly observe Helga, Mac, and their captives through the wall.\nSkellen manages to separate himself from the group by feigning a need for the toilet. He uses a shaving mirror to heliograph floodlights and signal Hadley via Morse code, telling him to attack at 10 a.m. while Skellen creates a diversion. Hadley cannot get permission for an SAS attack because the British Home Secretary insists that Powell resolve the situation through negotiation. As the tension mounts inside the residence, a mistake by one of the terrorists causes the death of the SAC C-in-C. This enables Powell and Hadley to get the permission for their assault.\nThe SAS operatives in the house adjoining Skellen's remove a large area of the bricks separating the attached houses. Meanwhile, Helga's temper at the Skellens' crying baby escalates into a fight with Skellen's wife. The operatives work fast to attach a charge to the exposed wall, cut the lights and blow the wall so two SAS soldiers can shoot through the gap, killing both Helga and Mac.\nAs the SAS mount an assault on the residence, the terrorists panic. Skellen overpowers and kills three terrorists. The SAS, deploying from helicopters, force open doors and enter through windows.

As a result, Walt is killed and Duncan loses an eye. Garp, through the aid of his mother, learns to forgive himself and his wife. The couple reconcile and have a baby daughter they name after Jenny.\nJenny receives death threats because of both her center and her book.

The book is very successful and well-regarded, but is highly critical of the Jamesians. Garp begins receiving death threats from them himself.\nDuring a political rally, Jenny is shot and killed by an anti-feminist fanatic. The women of Jenny's center hold a memorial for her, but forbid all men from attending. Garp, dressed as a woman, is infiltrated into the memorial by Muldoon. He is identified by Pooh, a Jamesian he knew when they both were in school. A commotion breaks out and Garp is in danger of being hurt, until a woman leads him out of the memorial to a taxi. The woman reveals herself to be Ellen James, and uses the gesture to thank Garp for his book about her. The Jamesians are further outraged that Garp attended the memorial.\nGarp returns to his old school as the wrestling coach.

At the critical point of the Cold War, two US Air Force airmen monitor their radar screens at a quiet and remote NORAD facility in Alaska. Suddenly, one of the radar operators notices an unidentified aircraft sneaking in on the leading edge of a weather front. He alerts his partner about the threat and begins to contact Elmendorf AFB. The other Airman retrieves a silenced MAC-10 from his desk and kills him. He then proceeds to shoot the remaining station personnel while they are sleeping in their bunks. Lighting a cigarette, the traitor notifies Elmendorf that the station will be out of commission for the next hour to repair a malfunctioning generator. It is learned later that the traitor was a deep cover KGB operative who had been in the Air Force for 15 years. The necessary blind spot has been created in the radar for the plane to continue undetected into Alaska.\nOut of the plane, the Soviets launch a secret incursion into Alaska. The Soviets have inserted a cold weather Spetsnaz assault force of approximately 35 to 40 KGB desant ski troops led by Soviet Colonel Alexander Vorashin (Jeroen Krabb\u00e9) into northern Alaska with a track-driven armored vehicle. Vorashin's orders are to seize control of a strategically-located pumping station along the Trans-Alaska Pipeline to threaten the placement of floating explosive devices in the stream of oil and to destroy substantial portions of the pipeline. The operation is being conducted in response to the US grain embargo of the Soviet Union, just as the 1980 grain embargo was in response to the 1979 Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan.  The governments of Canada, Australia, and Argentina have joined the US in the embargo, which has caused severe food shortages and domestic unrest inside the Soviet Union. A squad of 18 lightly-armed soldiers of the Alaska Army National Guard and Alaskan Scouts, which is on a training exercise, is discovered, ambushed, and killed by the Soviet invaders. At Fort Wainwright, Colonel Jake Caffey (David Soul), a combat veteran of the Vietnam War, is sent by his commanding officer to locate the soldiers, who are 24 hours late in reporting back from the training exercise. Caffey flies to the National Guard temporary patrol base to meet with the other half of the Guard company. Caffey goes out on a search mission and discovers one of the Alaskan Scouts still alive and learns of the Soviet incursion. Caffey then shadows the Soviet troops after notifying the Fort Wainwright commander, General Roberts. The general flies to the scene only to be seen by the Soviets. Caffey takes command of the Guardsmen when his senior officer General Roberts, who did not believe the news of the invading Soviet troops, is killed in Caffey's first firefight with the Soviets. Caffey notifies the Pentagon by radio of the situation.\nUpon learning of the situation, US President Thomas McKenna (Rock Hudson) orders Caffey's National Guard troops to be federalized and orders Caffey to do all that he can to stop the Soviet troops. McKenna orders a media blackout on the emergency but then orders US forces to be mobilized in response to the Soviet incursion under the pretext of unscheduled training exercises. McKenna fears that the US people will demand a declaration of war against the Russians for the attack. Fierce winter weather prevents US military units from bases and forts in southern Alaska from reinforcing Caffey's unit. Caffey deduces the Soviet assault unit's goal. He uses the two US Army helicopters at his disposal to move his unit to a new pumping station ahead of the Soviets.\nMeanwhile, Soviet Premier Gorny (Brian Keith) has learned that the Soviet military and KGB leadership have executed the plan without his permission. He is informed of the US mobilization and orders Soviet forces to a similar posture. In Alaska, Colonel Caffey realizes that his men have an inadequate supply of ammunition, grenades, and mines. Using combat tactics that he learned in Vietnam, Caffey sets up a defensive perimeter around the pumping station making use of surplus lengths of large-bore oil pipe to establish a position from which to ambush the enemy. The Soviet troops approach the pumping station, unaware of the American soldiers' presence until they trigger US land mines buried in the snow. The Soviets suffer casualties and fall back, but they continue to surround the buildings. McKenna and Gorny secretly meet in Iceland to negotiate an end to the crisis. They are unable to reach an agreement, and both return to their countries but promise each other that the talks will continue.\nThe US responds to the Soviets' continuing mobilizations, as officials recognize that they are consistent with a fictional contingency plan, \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0424\u043b\u0430\u0433, or \"Red Flag.\" McKenna orders all American ballistic missile submarines, surface warships, B-1s, and B-52s to deploy in readiness for war. He directs US bombers to fly continuous paths just outside Soviet airspace. Caffey and his soldiers continue to repel the Soviet attacks on the pumping station in Alaska, but his soldiers are running low on ammunition and supplies.  McKenna contacts Caffey by radio and asks him and his soldiers to hold out at all costs in the hope that the weather will break so that reinforcements can be sent to relieve them. McKenna obeys but hopes for a diplomatic solution. Gorny also hopes for a negotiated settlement to the crisis. However, hardline members of the Communist Party and the KGB, who remain incensed by the Soviet food shortage, suddenly launch a coup d'\u00e9tat. They use a car bomb to assassinate Gorny while he visits the school that is attended by his young son, Sasha.\nIn the meantime, the Soviet troops in Alaska launch a final assault on the pumping station. Soviet Colonel Vorashin, however, has become concerned about the rapidly-growing prospect of a nuclear war and requests a parley with Caffey. After an emotional conversation, Vorashin and Caffey agree to discontinue the fighting. However, at that moment, the Russian political officer, Major Nicolai Samaaretz, hurls a grenade, which presumably kills both men.\nThe situation collapses in bloodshed, with a sergeant of the Alaskan Scouts managing to send one final message that the last US position is being overrun. Receiving the news, McKenna calls the Soviet leadership and discovers that Gorny is unavailable to speak with him. The Soviet leadership claims that Gorny has been felled by severe intestinal flu and that their forces will withdraw to pre-crisis positions, but McKenna does not believe them and realizes that pro-war elements of the KGB are seizing control of the Soviet Union. Once the telephone conference ends, McKenna submits to the National Security Council his belief that Gorny has been killed and that total war is imminent. He is correct since at that moment, the coup leaders decide on an all-out nuclear strike, some of them mistakenly believing that US law requires the President to obtain congressional approval before an American nuclear attack. However, McKenna has already deduced the enemy strategy. Horrified and nearly in tears, he concludes that the situation is unrecoverable and so orders a full nuclear counterstrike on the Soviet Union.", "imdb_id": "tt0084919"}, "1312930": {"title": "Wrong Is Right", "plot": "In the near future, violence has become something of a national sport and television news has fallen to tabloid depths.

He is the director of his dramas and is a critically acclaimed director and often surfaces as the best ones in the state drama awards (in the story).\nThe movie starts with a scene that the troupe departs for a stage show during that night at a distant place. All are on board but wait for Kollappally, a popular and award-winning performer of the troupe. On that rainy evening, Kollappalli arrives late (unusually) and gives excuses to Vakkachan for being late, and the bus departs.\nOn the way, they pick up Rohini, who plays the lead female role in the drama, from her home. Vakkachan enquires about Ayyappan, the tabalist of the troupe, with whom Rohini lives. The gloomy faced Rohini says she doesn't know where he is and that he hasn't returned home since last night. Varunan, the comedian of the troupe, suggests going to the nearest arrack parlour where Ayyappan, a drunkard by nature, might be sleeping by booze over last night. However, the team could not find him there either and they proceed to the stage with anticipation that Ayyapan might be joining directly there.\nAs the drama starts, Ayyappan hasn't turned up yet, but Vakkachan takes the risk of starting the show without the tabalist. The drama goes well without him and the team proceeds to a hotel midway to the following day's show. In the morning, Chellapan sends another Tabalist named Janardhanan as a replacement for Ayyappan. After two consecutive shows, the troupe returns and drops Rohini first at her home and finds that Ayyappan hasn't returned to his home either. So, actress Rajamma decides to stay with Rohini for the time being.\nAfter a week, the troupe members realize that the \"missing\" of Ayyappan is mysterious and without any valid reason, despite his history of quarrelling and leaving the troupe in the past. Varunan advises Vakkachan to register a complaint at the local police station for the missing Ayyappan. The police file the case and put Jacob Eeraly a Circle Inspector in charge of the investigation.\nSoon, Jacob Eeraly starts an inquiry. He interrogates the troupe members one by one. Some are of the opinion that Ayyappan might have left the troupe or is with other women as he had taken the ornaments of Rohini the day before he went missing. Police are left clueless except that (1) Ayyappan son's presence in the scene, a potential reprisal to Ayyappan, just before the mysterious disappearance, (2) the verbal arguments between Balagopalan and Ayyappan in the arrack parlour on the night he went missing, and (3) the evidence that Ayyappan has sold Rohini's ornaments to a jewellery store owner the evening before he went missing. After a month when people begin to forget about Ayyappan, his body is recovered from a paddy field. The case now has turned into a homicide. Jacob Eerally identifies a keychain with some keys from the spot where the body was found, with \"J.K.\" on it. C.I. Jacob recognises that it must be the short name for Joseph Kollappally. He grabs Kollappally after a stage show and arrests him silently. Kollappaly confesses that he killed Ayyappan on the roadside when he met him that night, as a result of a quarrel and wrestling. He said he hid the body under the paddy field. Jacob Eeraly partially believes it, though some missing links such as the presence of a piece of broken glass that was used to stab the victim was found at Rohini's house instead of at the spot where Kollappally reported where he committed the crime.\nThe next day again the drama troupe waits for Kollappally not knowing that he was arrested. Police set a plot to identify the role of Rohini in the homicide. Kollappally was allowed to phone the troupe and give a message that he will come to the stage directly. The curtain raises and the show starts. Rohini appears nervous to find out where Kollappally was and why he is late. Kollappally tells her in secret at the back of the stage that he has been arrested by police for the murder of Ayyappan. Rohini's consciousness fades and she enters the stage in the middle of the drama and confesses to the audience with utter tension that it was not Kollappally, but she who committed the murder of Ayyappan. She explains to the police that Ayyappan took her ornaments, sold them and provoked Rohini that he will be capturing her sister also for pleasure and ruin her too as he did to her. This triggered her anger and she stabbed him to death. In desperation, Rohini had sought help from Kollappally, who always had empathy for her, for the tied-up life with Ayyappan against her will. Kollappaly helps her in hiding the body under the paddy field. While packing Ayyappan's body, a piece of the bottle was left behind in the house which Rohini throws out of the house and which was subsequently found by Jacob.

Barney drops the beaker containing the mice's feeding solution, producing a cloud of shimmery smoke that knocks him unconscious. Sometime later, he awakens and returns home, where his uptight mother chastises him for his tardiness and antisocial behavior. As she yells, Barney's bedroom door mysteriously slams shut.
