Kennedy International Airport; he possesses the ability to visualize constellations and patterns, and though he has a pilot's license, he has fear of flying. He had a recurring dream of a shooting occurring at Grand Central Terminal 30 years ago at 2:22 PM. While Dylan is at work, he begins hallucinating at 2:22pm, only able to break out from his fugue state just in time to prevent a collision between two planes. Following this, Dylan is suspended from work, pending a full board review.\nDylan begins to realize that the same things happen to him at the same time every day, and by 2:21 he somehow arrives at Grand Central Terminal, where - although not the same individuals - he always sees the same type of people: a businessman reading a newspaper, an older couple embracing, a party of school children, and a pregnant woman standing alone under the clock. At exactly 2:22 PM, an electrical malfunction causes the station glass to shatter.\nHe meets a woman named Sarah who works at an art gallery, has an ex-boyfriend named Jonas, and was a passenger on one of the planes which almost collided. Dylan and Sarah, who have the same birth-date and feel connected to each other, fall in love.\nOne evening Dylan attends Sarah's gallery to see an exhibition of Jonas's work, a holographic depiction of New York, which includes the interior of the Grand Central. Dylan is astonished that the holograph depicts the same events he saw in his recurring dream. He accuses Jonas of following him to create the hologram. Jonas doesn't understand Dylan's accusations, leading to a fight, ending with Sarah asking Dylan to leave.\nDylan learns through Sarah's colleague the story of a young woman, Evelyn Mills, who was killed by her lover at Grand Central Terminal. The lover also shot a policeman before he was shot and killed. Dylan finds a packet of old letters hidden in his apartment, which reveal that a man called Jake Redmond once lived in the apartment. The letters are love letters to Jake from Evelyn Mills.\nDylan tracks down Catherine, the sister of Evelyn Mills. She tells Dylan how Evelyn fell deeply in love with Jake, with whom he shared Sarah's birthday. A detective visited Evelyn to tell her that Jake was a criminal, but she refused to believe him. Catherine says that she thinks the detective, Noah Marks, was himself in love with Evelyn. Noah was the policeman who was killed by Jake at Grand Central Terminal, 30 years earlier. Catherine is wearing her dead sister's necklace, which Dylan notices is identical to the one Jonas made for Sarah.\nDylan believes the supernova which occurred on the day that Jake and Evelyn died 30 years ago (the same day Dylan and Sarah were born and what he saw  on the news before leaving for work at the airport earlier) created a \u201ccosmic cataclysm\u201d which means he and Sarah are destined to relive the fates of Jake and Evelyn. Dylan is convinced that if they stay together, he will kill Sarah the following day, the anniversary of the Grand Central murders. A distressed Sarah confides in Jonas, who persuades her to go away with him.\nOn his 30th birthday, after discovering that the same patterns he had experienced had occurred to Jake on the day he died, Dylan breaks into Jonas's studio, where he finds dozens of depictions of Sarah, revealing Jonas's obsession with her, including his empty gun case. Realizing that Jonas is planning to relive the Grand Central Terminal murders as Noah Marks, he rushes back to the terminal.\nMeanwhile, at Grand Central, Jonas goes to buy tickets while Sarah waits under the clock. She begins to see the same characters that Dylan described, and it dawns on her that she is the pregnant woman under the clock. When Jonas returns, she tells him she loves Dylan and cannot leave. In a jealous rage, Jonas calls her Evelyn, and Sarah realizes that they are reliving the same fateful day. Dylan arrives and Jonas pulls a gun, first aiming at Dylan but fires at Sarah. Dylan shields Sarah from the bullet, taking the hit himself and saving her life. Jonas is then shot and killed by the arriving police officers.\nIt transpires that Jake did not kill Evelyn (who was herself pregnant) but that the pair of them were shot by Noah Marks, who was in love with Evelyn.

They decide to go watch sharks from a diving cage with two local men. At the docks, Lisa is wary of the boat and its owner, Captain Taylor (Matthew Modine). Kate has had one lesson in diving, but Lisa has never dived. They lie to Taylor and tell him that they are both experienced divers. Unbeknownst to everyone, the winch supporting the cage is unsecured.\nTaylor sends Lisa and Kate down, with masks that allow them to talk to him on the surface and to each other.

The two sneak into the Mckenzies' house, armed and masked. Chip's apprehension of the mission is increased when he sees Liza kill the Mckenzies, who witnessed the two burglars in the house. During their heist, a young woman named Violet sees Chip with the Mckenzies' bodies and flees. Liza knocks Violet out cold and plans to sell her to her brother Dwayne, who will presumably torture and kill Violet.\nDisgusted by Liza's plan, Chip knocks out Liza when she goes to get Violet from the trunk of their car.

Liza regains consciousness and chases after Chip, getting him to pull over. She tells him that she forgives him as long as he stays with her, but then loses consciousness again on the side of the road.

With no other option, he decides to take Violet with him to flee with the money. Both are attracted to the other, as they bond over music and jokes in the car. On their trip, a police officer pulls them over, but Violet manages to talk their way out of the policeman inspecting the car further. Chip is impressed at her quick thinking, and the two further bond.\nThey take a stop at a gas station, where the clerk, Monica, sees Chip pull out a $100 bill from the envelope of the stolen money.

The two make love that night, seemingly safe.\nThe morning after, Chip wakes up to find his gun, money, and clothes stolen. Frantic, he is mad at himself for letting his guard down around Violet, who he assumes stole his possessions. He discovers her dead body in the bathtub of the room, horrified. Chip asks the man working at the hotel to use his phone to call Liza, since he thinks she is the one behind Violet's murder. The man working tells Chip a description of one of the people at his room the night before, which Chip connects to the gas station worker, Monica. Chip reluctantly incapacitates the man, finds some clothes from the lost-and-found, and steals his car. He goes to the gas station, where the employee working tells Chip where Monica is, with Chip reluctantly giving her cunnilingus in return.\nWhen Chip arrives at the house, it is revealed he has been set up, as the employee was a friend of Monica's. He is taken inside, where one of the men in the house holds him at gunpoint. Chip tries to escape, but is knocked unconscious. Monica explains how and why she robbed Chip and framed him for Violet's death, even though her plan has many faults in it.

A young Riku suddenly appears and claims he can fix the record. Immediately it's the present day and university student Aoi Hinata (Miwa) drops the book she's holding and jerks awake, disrupting the class. This is the summer before Aoi's study abroad to London. Apart from school, Aoi plays in a band with her friends, Naoya, Tetta and her childhood friend Riku (Kentaro Sakaguchi). Rina isn't in the band, but attends practices. Aoi and Riku appear to harbor some affection towards each other. Practice goes smoothly after that and Riku quickly announces that he has other things to do, to the confusion and bewilderment of his band members. The crew marvels if he's a perfect man and ask Aoi if Riku has any weaknesses. She can't think of a single one.\nIn preparation for their concert on Sunday, July 31, the crew put up flyers and paint signs. As Aoi and Rina paint, Aoi is dismayed by Riku's distantness, but maintains that she's content with staying friends with Riku throughout the summer. Riku nonchalantly pulls away the board they're painting, remarking it'll be dirty. Seconds later, a burst pipe showers water on all of the friends. Everyone except Riku are completely soaked. Once the band's all packed and ready, Naoya pulls Riku aside and tells him he plans to confess to Aoi at the shrines. While the crew is having sushi, Naoya's plan to confess to Aoi goes awry when he can't seem to invite her to the shrines, leading him to blurt out his confession in front of the crew. Aoi feels awkward because she has feelings for Riku and doesn't know what to say. Later on, she visits Riku's house to work on their song. While waiting for him, she explores his room and stumbles upon a record and record player in his closet. Riku appears suddenly and tells her not to touch the record, placing the record back carefully and hiding it from view, saying that some things shouldn't be seen. The pair work on their new song and become awkward with their feelings when comparing hands. Out of nowhere, Riku tells Aoi that if he ever disappear somewhere, she should be happy with Naoya. Aoi hurriedly gathers the pieces of their new song and tells him to forget it. The day of the concert arrives and Aoi still feels conflicted from yesterday's events. Unable to concentrate, the band performs terribly. Further upset by the concert, Aoi storms off. Crying and walking, she pulls out her handkerchief to wipe her tears, but lets a piece of the song lyrics fall out. As she chases the piece of paper into the street, she doesn't notice the truck hurdling towards her. The screen turns back.\nAoi wakes up in the same class as before, complete confused and disorientated. The day repeats like before, with brand practice and Riku one step ahead of everyone else. Aoi bursts out in frustration and tells her friends to stop pretending, to their confusion. Now knowing that Rina likes Naoya, Aoi fiercely affirms her friendship with Rina to the point of tears. Rina accepts her passion with confusion. When the same pipe bursts, Aoi darts over to Riku, who looks at her in shock and asks her why she moved. When she tells him that it's because the same thing happened a week ago, he laughs at her. Aoi thinks Riku is mocking her and storms off. Later on, the two sit in front of a sunset, where Riku reveals that he knows how Aoi died that day. He reveals his secret: he's been cheating with his record player of life, which gives him the ability to go back in time. Aoi doesn't believe him at first. He says he didn't either before guideing Aoi's hand to the needle and places it down on a groove and she wakes up once again in the same classroom as before, this time aware of the time rewind.\nAoi runs of out class to look for Riku, who tells her he told her so. She asks him what he means by cheating and he asks her if she remembers the first time he played guitar for her. On that day, it had been young Aoi's birthday. She had broken her late father's record and went to Riku's uncle's shop to ask if he could fix. When he says it's not possible, she leaves visibly deflated. Riku, eavesdropping the whole time, takes matters into his own hands and turns back time one day. From then on, he asks his uncle to teach guitar and keeps turning back time until he's able to play the song on the record for Aoi. After serenading her, he tells her not to cry and that he'll celebrate her birthday until she's 100. Another time, he time travels so that he has a month to prepare a chocolate record for Aoi with the song \"Happy Birthday\" on it. Aoi tells him that she always wondered why he was so calm and collected, but understands why now. Riku quietly remarks that it's because he wanted to look cool in front of her. Aoi asks if Riku likes her, but he avoids the question. Aoi hops on top of a bridge with Riku on the ground beside her. She reminds him that he had told her to be with Naoya and he jokes, asking if she was sure it wasn't a dream. After a moment of silence, Riku admits he's always liked Aoi from the moment they met. Aoi remarks that it's a waste they both confessed so late, seeing as she's studying abroad so soon. Riku helps Aoi down from the bridge and as the two hold each other, he asks if she wants to start over. The two run off and a montage begins of their relationship. The couple two go public with their newfound love in front of their friends at the annual summer festival, making fun new memories together as a couple.\nThe montage ends right around the holidays as Aoi is admiring the snow. Riku comes up behind her and surprises her with a necklace to celebrate their relationship. The happy couple embrace. Time fast forwards and Aoi is still on track to study abroad after summer. The day before the concert rolls around and Riku is visibly unsettled and concerned, while Aoi assumes he's upset about her leaving for London. At a concert, Aoi and Riku renew their commitment to each other and Aoi exclaims that they'll always be together. The day of the concert arrives and the band's performance is a smashing success. As the team banter, Riku quickly realizes that Aoi is gone. He frantically searches for her, until he sees the ambulance and her dead body. The screen cuts to black.\nAoi is sitting in class again, this time paying attention. Riku bursts in mid-lecture and hugs Aoi. Later, Riku skips band practice and is seen frantically asking a professor for help. Later that night, while the two are writing the new song, Aoi doesn't recognizes some of the lyrics and realizes that Riku has time skipped. She's hurt that Riku time travelled without her. After consistently skipping practice, Riku gets into a fight with the rest of the band members and walks away. Aoi is suspicious and pokes around his room. She goes to the professor she saw him talk to earlier and learns that he's been asking questions about time. When she opens his notebook, she realizes that he's relived the day of her death many, many times. Traumatized, Aoi takes a quiet walk back. Riku sits down with his uncle and reveals that no matter what he's done, he could never save Aoi. But, out of everything he's tried, only one thing seemed to change their fates: when he traded his life for hers. Aoi overhears their conversation and realizes the reason she could remember the one time she died was because Riku had sacrificed his life for hers. Riku's uncle remarks that on that day, Riku had died when he shouldn't have, which is why is time turned back. Rather than changing fate, Riku had simply dragged Aoi into the mess with him. Upset, Riku asks how he was so sure. His uncle replies that it's because he did exact same thing. Aoi can't focus the next day and runs out to the sea. Riku finds her and gently reminds her that they should finish their song.\nAs the two tiptoe around the issue, Aoi finally tells Riku that he can stop pretending now. She confronts him and asks how many times he's seen her die. Riku promises that she won't die and remarks that they have the ability to go back wherever they want, however many times they want. As Riku is about to time travel, Aoi remembers their vibrant summer together and takes the record of life and snaps it in half. Riku sees Aoi's decision as her giving up; Aoi doesn't want to see Riku suffer through her death over and over again. Even as Aoi emphasizes how she enjoyed their year together, Riku is resolute on fixing the record. While Aoi takes time to fully accept that her final day is approaching, Riku's uncle pauses by his door to tell his story: his wife had been diagnosed with cancer and had felt that her husband had been distant lately, fully unaware that he was time traveling. Riku's uncle reminds Riku that he cannot fix broken record and that time in the present is much more important. Moved, Riku apologizes to Naoya and Tetta for lashing out at them and begs them to learn Aoi's new song. He goes with Rina to beg the fireworks man for his help. Finally, he runs over to find Aoi. Aoi stands on top of a hill and muses her anxieties out loud. Riku draws her close and reassures that he will be there for her always and that he wants to spend his time living life with Aoi. With newfound determination, the couple run back to the festival and make it just in time. The band performs Aoi's new song and Riku finally sings a part of it. When the song ends, the fireworks that Aoi had mused about a long time ago go off and she admires how pretty they are. Tears brimming in her eyes, Aoi thanks Riku, saying that out of her 100 birthdays, this was the best one. The scene fades to black.\nFacing the ocean, the crew, dress in all-black, stand along the edge, an empty space indicating that Aoi has passed away. When Riku returns to the record shop, his uncle plays Aoi's last message to Riku on a record player. Aoi's voice jolts Riku to attention. She comforts Riku and encourages him to be strong and move forward, to live a vibrant life. She exclaims that this is his 100th birthday present and plays her last song to him, thanking him for loving her and for their precious memories. At the sound of her voice, Riku bursts in tears and breaks down. As Aoi's song continues to play in the background, Riku begins to move on with his life. He reorganizes his room, goes to class with his friends, jokes around with them, runs the record shop, and plays in the band with his friends. Sitting on the bench, he remembers his good times with Aoi and leaves with a smile.

The uncle declares this outside the hospital building, and Prosecutor Choi, after being fired, leaves evidence from the autopsy to Yoon Sang-sam, a reporter hoping to investigate the story despite a country-wide regulation against reporting on the death. Yoon's findings reveal to the public that Park Jong-chul died by asphyxiation, rather than the official police report of a cardiac arrest.\n\tWith the public aware that the student was killed by his interrogators, Commissioner Park chooses two detectives to take the full blame for the crime. He promises one patsy, the loyal detective Jo Han-kyung, that he will serve a reduced sentence for involuntary manslaughter rather than murder, but is unable to fulfill this promise, leading to a number of intense altercations between Jo and his colleagues when they visit him at the prison. Prison guard Han Byung-yong, who overhears some of these exchanges, is revealed to be in contact with high-ranking political activists, and attempts to convince his warden to disclose the records from the visits, which provide incriminating evidence of a cover-up.\n\tGuard Han's niece, Yeon-hee, is a college student who occasionally helps him deliver messages, but is otherwise disinterested in activism. Yeon-hee finds herself in the middle of a violent clash between protesters and police, and is saved from a violent policeman by a handsome student activist. The two reconnect on campus, and Yeon-hee attends the activist's club where footage of the Gwangju uprising is shown during a meeting, but she remains resistant to joining the cause. Meanwhile, the warden finally agrees to disclose the visitation records after witnessing Commissioner Park threatening Detective Jo and his family, and being violently beaten by Park's cronies when he protests. Han asks Yeon-hee to deliver the records to his contact, but she refuses. Han attempts to do so himself, but Commissioner Park's men locate his contact before he gets the chance, and one of Park's men recognizes Han. They later abduct Han, and torture him in the same interrogation room where Park Jong-chul was killed. Commissioner Park reveals details of his childhood in North Korea, in which he watched a radical communist murder his family, while torturing Han.\n\tRemorseful over her uncle's arrest, Yeon-hee independently delivers the information to Han's contact. The information finds its way to the Catholic Priests' Association for Justice, who make a public statement that Park Jong-chul was killed during interrogation by the two detectives arrested along with three others, and Commissioner Park had direct oversight and attempted to cover up the killing. A flashback to Jong-chul's death is shown, in which Detective Jo taunts him by claiming that if he dies in that room, nobody will care. Commissioner Park discovers that President Chun has personally approved to have him arrested and blamed entirely for Jong-chul's death. Han is released, and returns to his family. Later, Yeon-hee sees a picture in a newspaper of the handsome activist she met, severely wounded at a recent protest \u2014 he is revealed to be Lee Han-yeol, a real-life student protester who was shot in the head and killed by a police tear gas canister.

On his way, you see refugees outside running toward Exilium.  Upon arrival, the tank goes on as he gets situated.  His initial entry into the housing bunker is unsuccessful, as the door is jammed, so he climbs the sentry tower to communicate with the higher ups, where he hears that the former soldier occupying his post, VAX7, was evacuated for medical reasons and that everything is fine.  They instruct him how to get into the back entrance to the bunker, gives him the daily access code, and he goes off to settle in.  He opens the outer door, enters a long hallway, and eventually arrives in the residence, which is unkempt and mostly empty.  There are 6 bunks and a central table, and he puts away his food rations and cleans the space, finishing up by polishing a glass cup.\nHe then enters a monotonous cycle where he dreams of children bouncing against a warm blue background, is abruptly woken up by the daily alarm, telling him how many days left of his active service, exercise, showers, daily check-ins, and a single rationed cigarette.  There are constant audio messages outside asking surviving humans to go to Exilium for their protection from the Nonsuch, and that the soldiers' duties are to assist in this as much as possible.  Outpost Cerberus consists of a tower surrounded by a defensive circle made up of individual security rings, each centered around a monitoring camera.  As part of his duties, SUM1 goes outside to conduct maintenance on the security system, and as time progresses, he gets more and more curious as to why he's never seen the Nonsuch and what is actually going on.  The camera also focuses on many security domes housing cameras, revealing the heavy surveillance of the soldiers while the soldiers surveil their defense circle (DC).  Soon after settling in, there's a general broadcast that reports Outpost Lalops was suddenly attacked by Nonsuch and SUM1 sees and hears explosions and alien screams from his tower balcony.\nHe starts to get bored and lonely, especially since there are no other people around and his communications with his superiors is always abrupt and they're always telling him not to worry.  Eventually, he makes friends with the resident rat, calling him Doc, and sharing his food (and his own blood, sometimes) with him.  The loneliness starts descending into hallucinations and questioning of his mission, and though he reports what he sees and experiences, including finding a dog tag on a tree along with a dead bird, all his concerns are quickly dismissed by his commander, causing him to doubt even more.  As he explores the bunker more thoroughly, he finds a blood spot on the wall and starts suspecting now that VAX7 shot himself and wasn't evacuated at all.  He then decides to break into VAX7's still-locked locker, and tries to find what he can about what really is going on.  After breaking the lock, he finds a sketchbook and a radio.  Among the drawings is a sketch of Cerberus and the neighboring defense circle Gram, and piques his interest.  He goes out to try to make contact with Gram, but the perimeter of his DC activates a pain-inducing implant that keeps him from going on, along with audible commands to remain at his post.  He decides to back away a little and climb a tree, hoping to make contact by waving and yelling at Gram, but with no response.\nBack in the bunker, he gets so frustrated that he breaks the glass while polishing it, and cuts himself.  While he and doc clean up, he hears music from the radio in the locker, followed by the voice of a neighboring soldier KER4 calling for VAX7.  While he tries passing as VAX7, the sending soldier knows it's not him and asks what happened to VAX7, concluding communications by saying communication is unauthorized.  As SUM1 continues his deployment, his mental state deteriorates as he continues to investigate and strange \"coincidences\" occur, like while digging through outpost video history, a sudden power outage strikes and upon restoration, files he was looking at are gone.  He continues to doubt everything, particularly when the power outage at his outpost are minimized and he's told a MAC will be there eventually to fix things, but with no estimated date given the risk of Nonsuch.\nThe MAC finally arrives during a storm, and while he is grateful for someone to talk to, SUM1 is also highly suspicious of the newcomer, so he treats him coldly and they get to fisticuffs when the MAC swipes Doc into the wall.  He eventually pulls a gun to the MAC to shut off the internal camera and to help unlock the historical videos.  When the MAC gets stuck, as access requires 2 soldiers' daily codes, they fight again.  After losing the fight, the MAC tells SUM1 of his war stories long ago when he was a soldier fighting the Nonsuch, and SUM1 locks the MAC in the bunker as he gets a set of codes from KER4 over the radio.  After digging around in the videos, he finds out that VAX7 did go crazy after all, and SUM1 reports this back to KER4 where his conspiracy theories overflow, saying there's no Nonsuch to defend against and their mission to get humans into Exilium is a ploy to restrict their consumption of dwindling natural resources while rich and powerful people enjoy the remnants unrestricted.  After his rant, he asks KER4 for a meet, which the latter reluctantly accepts.\nCalming only slightly as he goes back to the bunker residence, he is set off again by the announcement that the Nonsuch have advanced and in his fury, kills Doc who was inside a canister he threw.  In mourning, he goes outside naked with a still-deteriorating mentality when he sees a monstrous figure whom he suspects is a Nonsuch.  Pulling a set of antlers out of a tree, he fatally stabs the monster, only to find it is VAX7 from a neck tattoo, further cementing his conspiracy theory.  He goes back to release the MAC, and tells him all about the conspiracy, including that he thinks the MAC is in on it and that the MAC's stories drove VAX7 mad.  With one final threat to the MAC's life, he asks how to deactivate the DC so he can leave his post and talk to KER4.  After getting the information, he sets the MAC free though the MAC's 4x4 computer is also destroyed.\nSUM1 approaches the DC perimeter, and while in pain, digs up the cable and cuts it, setting off alarms while he continues on to Gram.  Upon entering and climbing up, he finds the tower in disarray from an attack and KER4 nowhere to be found.  When he sees drips of blood, not his own, he finally realizes that the Nonsuch threat is real, and while looking out the broken windows, sees vehicles attacking all around in the twilight.  With his DC down and Gram already taken offline, the Nonsuch are able to advance and attack, and while the MAC returns to try to save SUM1, his vehicle is taken by a Nonsuch and is himself eaten or otherwise beheaded.  SUM1 flees and tries to enter his bunker but finds that the daily code isn't working as he smashed his wrist computer.  On the 3rd try, he is able to get in, and the automated system tells him to stay calm while evacuation is dispatched.  However, he quickly finds that the bunker is not able to withstand Nonsuch attack, and the film ends as a single Nonsuch breaches the bunker and looks for SUM1, who fires to unknown effect toward the alien's mouthparts.", "tmdb_plot": "An aggressive race of aliens took over Planet Earth and humanity's at its end, living in giant bunkers below ground.

The ship is monitored by Walter, an advanced android model that physically resembles David. When a solar flare damages the ship, Walter reanimates his 14 human crewmates, themselves couples, and future colonists. The ship's captain, Jake Branson, is burned alive when his stasis pod malfunctions. While repairing the ship, the crew picks up a transmission of a human voice from a nearby planet, which appears eminently more habitable than Origae-6. Despite the protests of Daniels, Branson's widow, that this new \"perfect\" planet is too good to be true, the new captain, Christopher Oram, decides they will investigate.\nWith pilot Tennessee maintaining Covenant in orbit, his wife Faris flies a lander to the planet's surface, where an expedition team tracks the transmission's signal to a crashed alien ship. Crewmembers Ledward and Hallett are infected by spores from fungus-like organisms. Oram's wife, Karine, helps the rapidly deteriorating Ledward back to the lander, where Faris quarantines both inside the med-bay. A small pale alien creature (neomorph) bursts from Ledward's back, killing him and mauls Karine to death. Faris attempts to kill the creature with a shotgun, but inadvertently triggers an explosion that kills her and destroys the lander. Nearby in the fields, another neomorph bursts from Hallett's mouth, killing him. The creatures attack the remaining crew, killing crew member Ankor. The remaining crew kills one neomorph before David, who survived the Prometheus mission, appears and scares off the other.\nDavid leads the crew to a temple in a city full of dead humanoids. He tells them that, upon his and fellow Prometheus survivor Elizabeth Shaw's arrival at the planet, their ship accidentally released a pathogen, which annihilated all fauna on the planet and Shaw perished when the ship crashed. Meanwhile, attempts to radio the Covenant are stymied by ion storms. When the remaining neomorph infiltrates the temple and kills crewmember Rosenthal, David tries to communicate with the creature, becoming incensed when Oram shoots it dead. Oram questions David, who reveals the aliens are a result of his releasing and experimenting with the pathogen to produce new lifeforms, before tricking Oram into being attacked by a facehugger. A new form of creature, the protomorph, later erupts from Oram's chest, killing him.\nAs the others search for Oram and Rosenthal, Walter finds Shaw's dissected corpse, used by David as material for his evolving creature designs. David states that humanity is a dying and unworthy species, and his designed creature is a \"perfect organism\" that will eradicate them. When Walter disagrees, David disables him and then threatens Daniels. Walter heals himself and engages David, allowing Daniels to escape.\nElsewhere, another facehugger attacks security chief Dan Lope. Crewmember Cole quickly cuts it off, leaving Lope with acid burns on his face. The now fully grown protomorph kills Cole, while Lope escapes and meets up with Daniels. Tennessee arrives in a lander to extract Daniels, Lope, and Walter, who says David has \"expired\". They kill the attacking protomorph and return to the Covenant.\nThe next morning, Daniels and Tennessee discover another protomorph has burst from Lope's chest, killing him, and is loose on the Covenant.

Paul Getty, who is at that time the world's richest private citizen, is kidnapped in Rome by the 'Ndrangheta, a Mafia-like organized crime group and secret society based in Calabria; a ransom of $17 million is demanded. His mother, Gail Harris, is unable to pay the ransom, as she rejected any alimony in exchange for full custody of her children when she divorced her husband, John Paul Getty Jr., in 1971 over his drug addiction. She travels to Getty's estate to beseech him to pay the ransom but, stating that it would encourage further kidnappings of his family members, he instead asks Fletcher Chace, a Getty Oil negotiator and former CIA operative, to investigate the case and secure Paul's release. The media picks up on the story, with many believing Gail to be rich herself and blaming her for the refusal to pay the ransom.\nPaul is kept hostage in a remote location in Italy. Initially, his captors, particularly Cinquanta, are tolerant with him because his quiet and submissive demeanor causes them few problems. However, things grow increasingly tense as weeks go by without the ransom being paid, far longer than the captors anticipated. Arguments arise over whether to move Paul to a new location as winter is approaching and their hideout is not suitable for cold conditions. One of the kidnappers accidentally shows his face to Paul, and he considers killing Paul so he cannot be identified, but one of the other kidnappers kills him first. His burned and disfigured body is recovered in the river; investigators erroneously identify the body as Paul's, but Gail examines the body and refutes this.\nUsing the new lead of the body, Chace is able to pinpoint the hideout where Paul is being held. A raid is conducted with several kidnappers being killed, but Paul is no longer there; he has been sold to a new 'ndrina, or crime family. The new captors are much less patient with Paul and negotiate more aggressively with the Getty family to receive their payment. The kidnappers cut off one of Paul's ears and mail it to a major newspaper, claiming that they will continue mutilating him until the ransom is paid.\nAfter repeated negotiations with Gail and Chace, and frustration from the captors at how long the process was taking, they lower the asking price to $4 million. Getty finally decides to contribute to the ransom, but only $1 million \u2013 this being the maximum amount that he can claim as tax-deductible. Moreover, he also will only do so if Gail signs a legal document waiving her parental access rights to Paul and her other children, giving them to Getty's son, her ex-husband. She reluctantly signs them. Intimidated by an exasperated Chace, Getty finally relents and agrees to pay the full ransom, also voiding the parental agreement with Gail. Gail and Chace take the money to Italy and follow specific instructions from the captors, leaving the money in a remote location and receiving orders to pick up Paul from a construction site. Based on Cinquanta's advice, Paul runs away from the site towards the town of Lauria, miles away. Meanwhile, the captors realize that Chace has broken his word and led the police to them; angry, they decide to find and kill Paul. Chace, Gail, and the captors arrive in Lauria to look for Paul.

Ja-hong blurts out that he only worked for money and was about to be punished when Gang-rim interjects, stating that the money was to support his brother and ailing mother and therefore acquitting him.\nOn the way to the Hell of Deceit, ghouls attack as the physics of Hell begins to morph. This change indicates that a member of Ja-hong's family had died and become a vengeful spirit. Gang-rim leaves the party to investigate as the rest proceeds. In the Hell of Deceit, Ja-hong is accused of writing fake letters to the family of those who had died, one of whom is Ji-yeon, the daughter of his fallen colleague. Gang-rim supernaturally links with Deok-choon from the living world to defend Ja-hong, stating that Ja-hong had also written fake letters to his mom to cheer her up, allowing her to focus on her health. And that the letters to Ji-Yeon, despite her actually understanding that her father was dead, helped her cope with her loss. The evidence is thrown out and the charges are dismissed.\nGang-rim determines that it is Ja-hong's brother Soo-hong who has become the vengeful spirit. He finds that Soo-hong has been accidentally killed while on guard duty by his partner Dong-yeon, and his death was covered up by their superior, Lieutenant Park. Gang-rim foils an attempt by Soo-hong to kill Dong-yeon and learns that the Soo-hong's grudge was not against Ja-hong but rather Dong-yeon and Lt Park. Dong-Yeon tips off Soo-hong's mother on the location of his body and attempts suicide. He is saved by Gang-Rim on Soo-hong's request after the latter agreed to cooperate.\nThe trio pass through the Hells of Injustice and Betrayal without trial. In the Hell of Violence, Ja-hong is tried for beating Soo-hong when they were younger while the latter was suffering from malnutrition. As Ja-hong was not forgiven, he is convicted and is about to be punished when Gang-Rim instructs Deok-choon to request for a combined trial at the next court, the Hell of Filial Impiety. The request is granted. Ja-hong reveals that, due to poverty, he intended to commit familicide but was discovered by Soo-hong. In a fit, he beat up Soo-hong and fled out of guilt, opting not to be a burden and dedicate his life to supporting them.\nGang-rim and Soo-hong arrive at the army base only to witness the mother's shabby treatment at the hands of Lt Park. Enraged, Soo-hong transforms back into a vengeful spirit and lashes out at the base by conjuring up a massive tornado, only stopping when he realizes how his actions are affecting Ja-hong in the afterlife.\nAt the Hell of Filial Impiety, Ja-hong is immediately judged by Yeomra to be guilty. He learns that on the night of his attempted murder-suicide, his mother was actually awake and had decided to allow it, knowing that she was a burden on her family. Soo-hong, with the help of Gang-rim and Won-maek, enters his mother's dream and learns that she had already forgiven Ja-hong for that night. Since sins that have been forgiven in the living world are not allowed to be judged in the afterlife, Ja-hong is allowed to reincarnate.\nAfterward, Gang-rim realizes that Yeomra had been meddling with his investigation of Soo-hong. He decides to confront Yeomra directly and chooses Soo-hong as the group's final soul before their own reincarnation.", "tmdb_plot": "Having died unexpectedly, firefighter Ja-hong is taken to the afterlife by 3 afterlife guardians.

Having secured an invitation to meet him face to face in Libya, Rapp prepares to take his vengeance on the man responsible for his girlfriend's death, but before he can kill the terrorist, the cell is suddenly ambushed by U.S. Special Forces. Upset over the perception that he has been denied his vengeance, Rapp repeatedly stabs the terrorist he was after, who is already dead from the ambush, before being dragged out by the U.S. forces. In a CIA facility Rapp undergoes 30 days of debriefing before being offered a chance by CIA Deputy Director Irene Kennedy to join a black operations unit code-named Orion. Its head, Stan Hurley, is a former United States Navy SEAL and a Cold War veteran who trains Rapp and the other potential recruits in asymmetric warfare.\nMeanwhile, word comes down through intelligence channels that weapons grade nuclear material has disappeared from a decommissioned Russian nuclear facility. The material in question appears to be heading to Iranian hardliners, who are upset with the Iranian government's nuclear deal with the U.S. While verifying the sale of the nuclear material in Poland the plutonium is intercepted by a third party, who eliminates the sellers before vanishing into the crowd. In Virginia, Hurley sees news reports about the incident in Poland and tentatively identifies the perpetrator as a former Navy SEAL and Orion operative believed to have been killed in action and now going by the code-name \"Ghost\". Hurley's team is sent into Turkey to intercept the buyer Ghost is working for.\nIn Istanbul, Hurley's team is identified, and the attempted intercept of the trigger device fails. Rapp pursues the seller to his apartment, and after killing the man, retrieves his laptop. The information leads the team to Rome, where Orion operatives identify a nuclear physicist needed to craft the nuclear material into a functional nuclear weapon. While in Rome, Rapp uncovers a co-worker, Annika, as a foreign agent for Iran. She explains that she is working for the mainstream Iranian faction which is attempting to stop the hardliners from acquiring nuclear material. During a meeting between Hurley and an Iranian contact, Ghost ambushes them, kills the contact and captures Hurley.\nAt the CIA safe house in Rome, Annika is being moved under guard by two Mossad agents when Rapp intercepts the car and frees her.

Rapp chases after Ghost's boat, while the Sixth Fleet, alerted to the impending nuclear attack through CIA channels, prepares for the attack.\nAboard Ghost's boat, Rapp kills Ghost and attempts to divert the boat away from the Sixth Fleet to shield the ships from the blast, before throwing the nuclear weapon into the sea and escaping aboard a Navy rescue helicopter sent by Irene to rescue Hurley. Seconds later the device detonates, creating a massive sink hole and subsequent tsunami that inundates the Sixth Fleet vessels, but the fleet survives the blast.\nIn the aftermath of the blast, Hurley is recovering from his injuries and notes that Rapp is on vacation in Dubai, while watching news reports indicating that the Iranian faction which tried to obtain the nuclear weapon will win the presidential election and is blaming the nuclear attack on the CIA.

Seal tells his wife, Lucy, he's still with TWA.\nIn the 1980s, Schafer asks Seal to start acting as a courier between the CIA and General Noriega in Panama. During a mission, the Medell\u00edn Cartel picks Seal up and asks him to fly cocaine on his return flights to the United States. Seal accepts and starts flying the cartel's cocaine to Louisiana, delivering the drugs via airdrop in the countryside instead of landing at an airport. The CIA turns a blind eye to the drug smuggling, but the DEA tracks Seal down. To avoid the authorities, Seal and his family must relocate to the remote town of Mena, Arkansas, and his wife comes to accept the wealth generated by his new life. The small town gradually becomes wealthy as the hub of U.S. cocaine trafficking.\nLater, Schafer asks Seal to run guns to the Nicaraguan Contras based in Honduras. Seal realizes that the Contras are not serious about the war and just want to get rich and he starts trading the guns to the cartel. The CIA sets up a Contra training base in Mena and Seal flies the Contras in, but many of them escape as soon as they arrive.\nSeal makes so much money he buries it in suitcases in the backyard.

As Barry chases after him, JB is killed in his car by a bomb placed by the Medell\u00edn Cartel, who had previously promised to \"take care\" of the JB problem.\nThe FBI soon catches wind of the sudden exuberance on the streets of Mena, not helped by JB's reckless spending, and eventually, the CIA shuts the program down and abandons Seal, who is arrested by the FBI, DEA, ATF and Arkansas State Police simultaneously. Seal escapes prosecution by making a deal with the White House, which wants evidence of the Sandinistas being drug traffickers. They ask Seal to get photos that tie the Medell\u00edn Cartel to the Nicaraguan Sandinistas. Seal manages to get the pictures, but the White House releases them as propaganda against the Sandinistas. Seal is prominently shown in the pictures, which leads to his indictment by the crusading state attorney general, and the cartel plotting revenge.\nSeal is convicted but sentenced to only 1,000 hours of community service. Moving from motel to motel making video recordings of his experiences, Seal fears an explosion anytime he starts his car. As his community service is performed at the same Salvation Army building every night, Seal cannot hide from the cartel and is shot dead by assassins.

Ten days later, Lorraine Broughton, a top-level MI6 spy, is brought in to be debriefed by MI6 executive Eric Gray and CIA agent Emmett Kurzfeld about her just-finished mission to Berlin. The plot jumps between the debriefing room and flashbacks to Lorraine's time in Berlin.\nThe day after Gascoigne's death, Lorraine is dispatched to recover The List and is told to keep an eye out for Satchel, a double agent for the KGB who has been a problem for MI6 for years. Arriving in Berlin, she is immediately ambushed by KGB agents speaking English and apparently posing as her own MI6 team, who attempt to deliver a message from their boss, Aleksander Bremovych. She is able to escape their grasp by crashing their car and is immediately picked up by her real MI6 contact, maverick MI6 station head David Percival, who should have been the one to pick her up initially. Percival is addicted to the Bohemian lifestyle he has been leading on both sides of the Berlin wall and resentful of Lorraine and the implied supervision from London she brings, and he seems unwilling to cooperate with her. Lorraine searches Gascoigne's apartment and discovers a picture of him and Percival. In the debriefing, she tells Gray and Kurzfeld that Percival had previously denied knowing Gascoigne and she suspects Percival was behind the West Berlin police ambushing her while she searched Gascoigne's apartment. When Lorraine visits a restaurant mentioned by the KGB agents she encounters Bremovych, but is \"saved\" by Delphine Lasalle, a novice French agent. Although Lorraine is initially suspicious of Lasalle, they eventually enter into a sexual relationship after a passionate kiss in a nightclub, where Lasalle tells Lorraine that she knows who she is and why she's in Berlin, and suggests that they should work together.\nPercival, having tailed Lorraine, surveils a watchmaker she visited. He spots Bakhtin entering the same shop. Bakhtin tells the watchmaker he has a watch full of secrets he will sell to the highest bidder. Kurzfeld meets with Lorraine in Berlin, handing her a newspaper containing a number which, when called, informs her Satchel has been compromised. Percival lures Bakhtin to an alley, kills him, and takes the wristwatch  from which he discovers who Satchel is. Lorraine, who does not know Percival has The List, finds out that the Stasi officer codenamed Spyglass, who gave The List to Gascoigne, also memorized the names on it. Lorraine and Percival make plans to escort him across the border to West Berlin. Percival meets with Bremovych, who suspects Percival has The List, but Percival offers only the second best thing\u2014the identity and operations details of Satchel \"to keep the balance\", also tipping him off about the plan to extricate Spyglass from East Berlin.

Amidst this chaos, the corporation Auxilisun develops the tri-fission reactor, a device that not only produces abundant nuclear energy through atomic fission, but also converts nuclear waste into additional clean energy. The tri-fission reactor renders all other forms of energy production obsolete, and Auxilisun power plants are built around the world, providing an inexhaustible supply of cheap energy for all.\nDecades later, on Christmas Day, Auxilisun technician Abby travels to Gibson Desert North, the flagship Auxilisun plant built over a nuclear waste storage facility deep within a radioactive \"red zone\", to restore a broken communications relay. She finds the plant poorly-maintained and seemingly deserted, with no sign of caretakers Dr. Zek and Robinson, but the latter appears brandishing a golf club and demands that she identify herself. He calms down when she complies, but when asked about Zek, he vaguely replies that the doctor is somewhere outside the plant conducting a survey.\nAs Abby attempts to repair the communications relay and Zek remains absent, she gradually discovers more serious problems affecting the plant's performance and becomes suspicious of the oddly-behaving Robinson, who displays a considerable ignorance of the workings of the machines he supposedly maintains. Abby eventually tracks Zek down in the red zone, but finds him unconscious. When she returns to the plant with Zek in tow, Robinson initially refuses them entry, but soon relents and explains he was following contamination protocol. Robinson also reveals that Zek had experienced a nervous breakdown on the night he left. With Zek moved to the medical bay to recover, a new crisis emerges: one of the plant's two main ventilation fans, ostensibly designed to function flawlessly for thousands of years, inexplicably fails, and volatile gases begin building up in the facility. Abby concludes that the fan had been sabotaged by a crazed Zek before her arrival, and handcuffs him to his bed.\nZek finally awakes, and despite treating Robinson with familiarity, he informs Abby that Robinson is an impostor. Days ago, the real Robinson had disappeared and Zek had gone out in search of him, but was knocked out by an unseen assailant, likely the impostor. Somehow, the false Robinson had made it past the red zone and was posing as Robinson for unknown reasons. Zek urges Abby to send a distress signal to Auxilisun HQ, but with comms still down, she has to venture back outside the plant and build a makeshift array while Robinson is occupied.\nThat night, as Abby tries to slip out of the plant with Zek to send the signal, Robinson catches them and angrily demands Zek tell Abby the truth about Gibson Desert North. Zek fends Robinson off and locks him and Abby in the medical bay. Robinson explains to Abby that Zek had rigged the entire plant into a bomb. As they search the plant separately for Zek, Abby discovers the real Robinson's body in a locker and realizes Zek had not lied. After Robinson incapacitates Zek, Abby turns against Robinson, but the latter overpowers her and amputates one of her fingers to unlock Deep Burial, the facility's nuclear waste repository. Abby confronts Zek with her findings that Gibson Desert North had been decaying for years despite Auxilisun's public assurances that the technology was failsafe, and that the red zone had expanded hundreds of miles into a town called Barrow Creek and was killing the residents. Zek confirms that Barrow Creek was being covered up to avoid a public relations disaster, as too much of the world was dependent on Auxilisun to allow its technology to be called into question. Disgusted, Abby leaves him to escape the plant on his own.\nAt Deep Burial, Abby corners Robinson, who unmasks himself as the sole survivor of Barrow Creek. Since he had already been fatally irradiated, he had walked through the red zone to Gibson Desert North to destroy it and avenge the death of his family. Robinson then ignites Deep Burial, setting off a catastrophic chain reaction.

While traveling through the Solar System, his spaceship is damaged by a meteor shower. The Russian Air Force mistakes his spaceship for a NATO military spacecraft and damages it by firing missiles into it, causing it to crash into several buildings in Moscow and kill hundreds of people.

Meanwhile, Yulia, Artyom, and his friends Khariton, Ruslan, and Piton sneak into the crash site to investigate the alien: after they beat him up and cause him to crash down a building, they retrieve his armor before an army patrol may find them. On another day, Yulia sneaks again to retrieve the alien, placing him with a nerdy classmate known as \"Google\" to help the alien recover. While examining his body, she notices a wristband forming on her right wrist, which manipulates water.\nThe alien, who introduces himself as \"Hekon\", was initially unsure about Earth and its people, but tells them that he is looking for a device known as \"Shilk\", that allows him to travel through space without destroying his body. Shilk, like the spaceship, appears to be attracting water. As he goes out to the streets to look for the device, the police mistake him for a drug addict and send him off to a police station to be interrogated.\nMeanwhile, Artyom and his friends drive in their car to inform Colonel Lebedev about the alien's armor that they had hidden in their garage. They stumble upon a crowd who are angry over rationed water, as the spaceship appears to absorb water in order to repair itself. Ruslan decides to provoke the crowd into becoming a disorderly riot. Artyom is hit by a policeman's baton as he tries to convince people to stop rioting, and is taken to the police station but he forgets to tell Colonel Lebedev about his discovery.\nIn order to get Shilk, Yulia goes to see her father, who interrupts his meeting with his officers when she informed him that she is pregnant with Hekon's child. She actually says this to distract him, so Hekon can disguise himself as a scientist and take Shilk from its container, and also because she was upset that he did not spend much time with her after her mother died.\nYulia confesses her true feelings for Hekon in a phone call to Artyom, while Artyom arrives with his friends to beat up the alien. Hekon fights back, and when one of Artyom's friends tries to shoot Hekon, Ruslan is shot by accident instead. Artyom and one of his friends flee before the police would arrest them. He reports this incident to gather many supporters and form a group to attack Hekon's spaceship, and avenge Ruslan's death, for which he blames the alien. In spite of his initial support, Piton sometimes expresses doubt on Artyom's goals.\nArtyom's group breaks through a police barricade, triggering several other robotic suits to come out and fight against the mob. Yulia and Hekon drive through the police barricade and the mob using an armored car to return him and Shilk back to their ship, while fending off against Artyom, who angrily rampages using Hekon's suit. Hekon defeats Artyom, but Artyom shoots him and Yulia with an AK-74. Saddened by this, Colonel Lebedev follows several walking suits as they carry Yulia and Hekon to the spaceship, where its machinery uses water to nurse Yulia's injuries. The spaceship's computer also responds to Lebedev's questions about Hekon's mission to observe the Earth, as its warlike civilizations and history had made it very unsafe for interstellar contact.

Bairavaa decides to take advantage of Kottai Veeran's love for his wife to get him on his side and make him approver against PK. He switches PK's asthma inhaler with nitrous oxide. PK, who inadvertently inhales the gas before going to Kottai Veeran's wife's funeral, begins to laugh uncontrollably, even during the funeral, causing Kottai Veeran to turn against him and accept Bairavaa's offer of becoming approver. In revenge for betraying him, PK confronts Kottai Veeran and hacks him to death. Bairavaa decides that is the only way to seek justice for Malar and Vaishali is to kill PK. He frames PK for plotting to assassinate the Prime Minister of India while he is on the way to the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant. The news spreads all across India, and soon it is ordered to shoot PK on sight. PK, realizing that he is cornered, tries to kill Bairavaa before he dies, but Bairavaa manages to subdue him and escape. He then disguises himself as a NSG commando, where he blends in with the real NSG commandos, who have arrived at the building and kills PK. The verdict is declared in favor of Bairavaa and Malar.

Ed comes out and subdues the man, admonishing Lefty for his mistake. Ed and Lefty immediately ride off and hang the man despite Lefty protesting the illegality of it, it is Ed's chosen method of exacting justice.\nShortly after arriving back at his ranch, Ed and his wife Laura prepare to move to Washington, Ed has recently been elected Senator. She has reservations about Ed's decision to leave Lefty in charge of the ranch, but Ed is sure of his loyalty. The next day, a ranch hand informs Ed and Lefty that three horses have been rustled and they ride off to check. When Ed and Lefty come to the spot, Ed is trying to bequeath his rifle to Lefty when he is suddenly shot in the head by an unknown sniper. Lefty survives and rides back to the ranch with Ed's body. Laura is distraught and blames Lefty for not protecting her husband and pays no mind when Lefty says he will avenge Ed. Lefty buries the rifle and rides off to begin his search.\nLater, Governor James Bierce and Marshal Tom Harrah arrive to console Laura. They, Ed and Lefty used to ride together. Hearing that Lefty has gone off to find the man, Tom decides to find him to prevent him getting himself into trouble. On the trail, Lefty is set upon by a gunman who turns out to be a young man named Jeremiah Perkins. The boy asks to accompany Lefty, who initially refuses, but takes him along when he considers the boy's situation.\nTom finds Lefty and Jeremiah. Lefty is excited for him to join the posse, but he refuses, claiming he is only there to bring Lefty in. Disappointed that Tom won't help their friend Ed, they tie him up. After hearing his name and claiming he is a western hero from a novel he has, Jeremiah inspires Tom to join their quest. At a juncture, Lefty leaves Tom and Jeremiah to chase a lead in which Tom has no faith, which leads Lefty directly to the killer's gang's hideout. The three regroup: Jeremiah will tend the horses, Lefty will go in back and Tom in front. Just as Tom is about to spring the trap, a man rides up who Tom recognizes as an employee of the governor's. A shootout ensues in which Jeremiah (who sneaked back) and the governor's man are shot, Tom kills several of the gang and Lefty apprehends the killer. Two of the gang escape.\nLefty tends to Jeremiah's wound, and as he begins to tell a heroic story about Edward, Jeremiah asks him to tell the story about how he got shot in his leg instead. At first hesitant and telling him it isn't that interesting, Lefty agrees. Lefty had pursued an outlaw when Edward was unavailable. They were ambushed on their stagecoach, and they ended up hiding in a box canyon outside of which the outlaws waited for them knowing they'd run out of food. Lefty couldn't wait any longer, and was shot as he also shot the outlaw, giving him his limp and the name \"Lefty\". Meanwhile, Tom interrogates the killer, named Frank Baines. They antagonize one another, with Tom noting that an employee of the governor's was sent to pay Frank, who killed Ed. Tom burns the money and gets drunk, leaving abruptly. Lefty and the injured Jeremiah are left to bring Frank in. Shortly after leaving, however, the escaped gang set upon them. Tom goes to see Jimmy and asks if he hired Frank to kill Ed. Though Jimmy denies it, he alludes to there being a difference of opinion between him and Ed, leaving Tom unconvinced.\nFinding out the money is gone, the gang handcuff and strip Frank, Lefty, and Jeremiah and search for the money. In the confusion, Frank is able to kill both men but his pistol misfires as he tries to kill Lefty. Jeremiah gets a rifle from a dead man and kills Frank. Realizing the bad shape Jeremiah is in, Lefty rides back to the ranch, where the ranch hands attempt to lynch him. Laura intervenes but they tie him up; she reads him a telegraph from Jimmy claiming Lefty killed Ed. Realizing no one believes him, Lefty escapes and digs up Ed's rifle he buried before managing to secure medical supplies after forcing one of the pursuing ranch hands at gunpoint. He nurses Jeremiah back to health and laments how wrong he was that Jimmy was their friend. He says he's never gotten a single thing right in his whole life. Jeremiah reminds him that Lefty saved his life. After trying to decide what to do now, they go to town to confront Jimmy.\nIn town, Jimmy is hosting a memorial for Ed. Laura asks Jimmy not to appoint the senatorial runner-up to Ed's position, but Jimmy again alludes to a railroad deal Ed did not support. Jeremiah enters the building to spy and Lefty goes to the saloon to enlist Tom's help. Though Tom initially refuses to help, after knocking Lefty out, he interrupts Jimmy's eulogy and accuses him of killing Ed. Soldiers apprehend him, but Lefty comes to and starts shooting. Jimmy takes Laura inside and Lefty and Tom shoot their way through town; Tom is mortally wounded. In the hotel, Lefty confronts Jimmy, who reveals everything: Ed opposed a contract Jimmy proposed between Congress and the railroad, so Jimmy had a rustler kill him so he could appoint a senator who would support his deal to Ed's seat. Laura hears everything and Lefty knocks him out. Lefty says he'll take him to the judge, but Laura insists on dealing with this \"Ed's way\" - with an immediate hanging.\nNot wanting Laura to be hanged herself for murdering the governor (since they lynch him without trial), Lefty hangs Jimmy himself.

Two of his friends, Genda (Vikram Thapa) and Gulab (Bhuvan Arora), assist him in orchestrating the robbery. In preparation for the heist, Champak disguises himself as a sadhu and his accomplices wear elephant and horse masks. The bandits successfully make it past the bank's security carrying weapons, thereafter taking over the entire bank at gunpoint. But the heist soon unravels rather haphazardly, resulting in the robbers seizing twenty-eight individuals inside the bank hostage.\nAmong the hostages inside the bank, consisting of seventeen men and eleven women, are bank staff and customers, including a nervous housewife, a sassy female bank teller, a hyperactive male chef, the rapper Baba Sehgal and Jugnu (Sahil Vaid) who is purporting to be a Faizabadi undercover police officer on duty.\nPowerless and defenseless, each hostage is soon tied up with his (or her) hands zip-tied behind his (or her) back. The robbers bundle the bound hostages into a back room and force the manager to open the vault. Champak continues composing stories to persuade the hostages about his white-collar class foundation to compensate for the fortune that has evaded him. In any case, things get off-track rapidly, making the bank robbers run into Amjad Khan (Vivek Oberoi) who is a heartless and tough CBI officer with a \u201cshoot first ask questions later\u201d attitude. The CBI officer threatens to use force against the bank robbers, giving them a one-hour deadline to surrender and not caring about the hostages\u2019 lives if the deadline expires.\nIn the midst of everything occurring inside the bank, there is a much larger plot unfolding as the Indian Minister of Home Affairs takes an interest in the bank robbery; there is a disk inside the bank with compromising information that threatens to destroy his political career. There is also the expected mad-media circus outside the bank led by crime reporter Gayatri Ganguly aka Gaga (Rhea Chakraborty) whose idol in the movie is Arnab Goswami.\nEventually, Champak and his accomplices decided to end the bank robbery and free the bank staff and customers, removing the zip-ties fastening their hands behind their backs and letting them all go. But just as the hostages are about to exit the bank, one of them, Jugnu reveals himself to be a ruthless bank robber who is secretly working for the Indian Home Minister to procure the compromising disc that threatens to expose him in a political scandal. In a transition of power from the old bank robbers to the new bank robbers, Jugnu and his fellow perpetrators hijack the bank at gunpoint, shooting and seriously wounding an elderly male hostage and taking the original bank robbers, Champak and his accomplices, as their own hostages in a new bank robbery. As the sands of power inside the bank shift from Champak to Jugnu, Jugnu forces the old bank robbers to assist him and his team with their own bank heist.\nIn the meantime, the twenty-seven remaining bank staff and customers are forced to transition from being Champak's hostages to becoming Jugnu's hostages. The ruthless new bank robbers force the hostages to kneel on the ground; each bank employee and customer is now compelled to keep his (or her) hands behind his (or her) head at all times.\nWhile all this chaos is unfolding, Amjad Khan discovers that Champak is no longer the real bank robber but his efforts to investigate the bank robbery are thwarted as the corrupt Minister for Home Affairs orders the investigation of the ongoing bank robbery transferred from the CBI to the local Mumbai police in an effort to help Jugnu.\nAt one point the CBI officer is invited to enter the bank to check that all the hostages are still alive and safe. The CBI officer enters the premises to discover the terrified bank staff and customers inside a back room, all compelled to sit on the floor with their hands behind their heads. During this time Jugnu instructs Champak to try and fool the CBI officer by pretending that he (i.e. Champak) is still the bank robber and that he (i.e. Jugnu) is still a hostage. At this point, Champak offers to let the CBI officer take the injured elderly male hostage for medical treatment. When the CBI officer leaves, Jugnu beats up Champak for letting one of the hostages go, much to the alarm and fright of the remaining hostages.\nEventually, Champak and his partners outwit Jugnu and his accomplices and help free all the captives inside the bank. In an act of chivalry, Champak and his team help free the female hostages first. But eventually, all the hostages are freed. The released bank workers and customers embrace Champak and his partners as their heroes for saving their lives. Jugnu is ultimately captured. The corrupt Minister for Home Affairs is exposed when the information on the disk inside the bank becomes public knowledge.\nAt the end, it is revealed that the three who freed the hostages were the actual bank robbers who robbed many banks and all the work done by them was a part to expose the home minister who killed his partner who was a journalist while he was gathering evidence against the home minister.

Despite the risk of losing his respect within the fraternity and after a small confrontation with the Lord Master, Toran gathers courage and reports of the hazing to Hernandez, who takes immediate action.

Eventually, a man emerges from the bathroom in a critically diseased condition. He drops to the floor but as the group gathers around to comfort him, he mutters, \"Don't touch me!\" before dying. It now becomes clear that the group is being quarantined due to the man's disease. Amparo, the shop owner acknowledges the man's last words before dying and keeps five people from the group at bay who made physical contact with the man, including Elena, Nacho, Trini, S\u00e1tur, and Israel believing them to be infected.

In her panic, she runs up the cellar stairs and slips and falls down on a crate of bottles and breaks several of the bottles. Nacho realizes the liquid from the bottle is not pooling on the cellar floor but instead has seeped down somewhere and when they remove several pieces of cardboard, they uncover the grate leading to the sewer. The grate is removed but the opening to the sewer is very small. So the group covers Israel with olive oil from oil bottles to help him slip through but despite all their attempts, Israel is not able to slip through the sewer opening, and instead he is now stuck there.\nThey then hear several gunshots coming upstairs from the bar and deduce the government has stormed in and shot Amparo, Andr\u00e9s and Sergio dead. They are scared and try to stay quiet so that no one realizes that they are in the cellar. The government then sets the bar on fire to disinfect it or perhaps hide all the evidence. The group start coughing as smoke begins to fill the cellar. The group all works together to pull Israel out of the sewer opening as they realize that they will run out of air if the fire in the bar continues and they need the air from the sewer to circulate in the cellar. Trini panics again and touches the door to cellar which is red hot, to push it open and burns her hands.\nThe group waits till the government is gone and heads upstairs to find the interior of the bar burnt down and taped up from the outside. Nacho finds Sergio's gun and even though it is still hot from the fire, he picks it up and hides it in his pants without telling the others.\nEventually, the group finds the diseased man's phone in the wreckage of the burnt bar and they are able to deduce from his text messages that the man has brought in what they conclude to be four doses of vaccine made for the man's disease that have supposedly infected the group.\nIsrael finds the vaccines in the bathroom, but when the rest of the group urges Israel to share them, he reminds them that the four vaccines are not enough for the five of them, meaning someone in the group will remain unvaccinated. Elena suggests they split the four doses equally amongst the five of them but Nacho says then the vaccine wouldn't be effective. Unwilling to take any chances, Israel deliberately takes out one of the doses, the group sees this and Nacho pulls out the gun and tells him to stop but Israel continues to inject himself with the vaccine. Furious, Nacho engages in a physical fight with Israel. However, Israel ultimately gets the upper hand in the fight, beats Nacho badly, and manages to get the gun off Nacho. Israel uses the gun to threaten the rest of the group.\nIn the ensuing fight, the rest of the vaccines end up falling down into the cellar. Trini runs down to pick it up and instead ends up dropping it through the sewer opening and down into the sewers.\nNow in order to get the vaccines, Elena strips down to her undergarments and is covered with oil. After much pushing and some injury and discomfort, she is able to slip through the sewer opening. She finds the vaccines container but refuses to send the vaccines back up to the group. She says that they will use the vaccines amongst themselves and not leave any for her if she sends it up. She says she will not use the vaccine herself yet but if the rest of the group wants the vaccine, they will have to come down to the sewer as she did.\nNacho grabs a huge metal pipe and the men all take turns in making the sewer opening larger. They cover themselves with oil and Nacho, Israel, Satur, and Trini barely manage to squeeze through the small opening to access the sewers. While they are all trying to come down to the sewer, Elena explores the sewer a bit and hides the vaccine in a safe location.\nOnce the whole group is down in the sewers, Nacho suddenly grabs Israel and attempts to fight and drown him underwater and also get the gun away from him. The two men are submerged for some time and the group suddenly hears two gunshots with flashes underwater. After some time it is Nacho who emerges from the sewer water, gasping for air and holding onto the gun.\nThe group is still left with the question of who is going to be left out to be vaccinated. Elena, Trini, and Satur fear Nacho as they think he killed Israel. Nacho also becomes aggressive towards them, threatening to shoot Satur if Elena does not hand over the vaccines. They are able to talk him down and Elena starts to lead the way to where she hid the vaccine. While walking on the way there, it is very dark and Satur slips and falls into the water. Instead of helping him up, Trini holds and forces his head underwater to drown him so that there is no more competition for the vaccine. Elena asks Nacho to shoot the gun so they can use the light to see what's going on. In the flash of the gunshot, they see Trini holding Satur underwater. Trini stops and tries to justify her actions. Nacho says that he will shoot her instead and holds the gun to her head but is ultimately unable to do it. Trini has a moment of realization about the pointlessness of her whole life and so she takes the gun from him and kills herself to minimize the group's quantity with that of the vaccines.\nElena takes Satur and Nacho to where she hid the vaccines. They take the vaccines out but before they can inject themselves they hear a clinking sound of coins being thrown. They go back to investigate and see Trini's dead body with coins placed over her eyes.\nWhile the three are looking at Trini's body, a now demented Israel comes out of the shadows and hits Satur on the head with a metal pipe and kills him. Israel chases after Elena and Nacho through the sewers. He is mostly only after Nacho as Nacho is the one who fought with him and tried to drown him earlier.\nNacho and Elena run and find a ladder to escape from the sewers. Elena starts climbing the ladder with Nacho just behind her. Israel catches up and grabs hold of Nacho but Nacho manages to kick him off. Elena and Nacho continue to climb up but Israel is climbing fast and grabs a tight hold of Nacho. During this struggle, Elena drops her dose of the vaccine down into the sewer. Nacho tells her to grab his hand and gives her his dose of the vaccine just before Israel pulls him down the ladder and back into the sewer, resulting in both being killed. Distraught, Elena injects herself with the vaccine and pushes open the grate before climbing out of the sewers and into the streets, where she sees the bar burnt down from the outside.

He was wounded during an Attack when he tried to save fellow Tamil people, Raj, Ajith, Mani, and Shiva, who later became his best friends after he had saved them from a certain death.\nMeanwhile, at home, Lekha struggled alone painfully to give birth to a baby; she calls out for help but is too weak to be heard. Shortly after, rumors started circulating the village that Lekha had died in labor and was now a ghost of a very powerful form haunting the house. The villagers in the neighborhood then heard her singing lullabies to her baby, terrifying them and forcing them to cower in fear.\nWhen Jai and his friends arrive back to the town in the evening, they find the town completely silent. The five soon arrives at Jai and Lekha's house during the night, and Jai introduces Lekha to them. As it is now too dark to continue traveling, Jai's friends decide to stay. The following day, the men visit the village market but are shunned by the fearful community. A drunk villager attempts to shout out a warning to Jai but is forced down and hushed by her son. Jai's friends then discuss what they had heard but dismiss the rumors as ridiculous.\nAjith, however, while he was sent to fetch Jai, saw that the house was a dilapidated wreck that had not been maintained for months, that the baby cot that Jai and Lekha's son was supposed to be sleeping in, was rocking by itself, and then he saw Lekha extending her arm to an unnatural length to retrieve a dropped Apple under the house. The following day, Mani discovers a decomposed corpse behind the house wearing exactly the same ring as Lekha. The drunk villager who had also tried to warn them earlier also turned up mysteriously drowned. Soon, all four friends are convinced that she is a ghost. The friends then try numerous methods to convince Jai of the news, including a game of charades, and come within inches of being murdered by Lekha, with only Jai's presence preventing her from doing so, and she scares them away. Worse, Jai dismisses all of their warnings, proclaims that they are no longer his friends, and kicks them out of their accommodations.\nLater, Jai and Lekha go out on a date in the town, visiting an amusement park. Jai's friends attempt to separate the two by kidnapping Jai, but their plans are foiled when Lekha discovers them and chases them away. Suddenly, during the getaway, Jai's wound reopens. His friends express surprise at how much blood has spilled, but Ajith and Mani become convinced that he, not Lekha, is the ghost, and their fears are seemingly confirmed when Jai reacts in pain when they attack him with holy rice. The friends then flee from their wounded friend and rescue Lekha. While escaping in a boat, Jai \"returns\" to them, walking into the river to them, but ends up almost drowning when he suffers cramps. As ghosts are not supposed to feel cramps, Jai is revealed to not have been a ghost, and he is rescued; when asked why he screamed when hit by the holy rice, he reveals that the rice had riddled his wound, making him yell out in pain.\nIn the following confusion, Raj drops a ring identical to the one Jai, Lekha, and the body behind the house had been wearing. Raj is immediately pronounced a ghost and kicked off the boat. The others then try to escape, but, as they had lost the paddles to the boat earlier, they cannot move. Lekha then somehow produces a soaking wet paddle and hands it to Mani, who suddenly recalls that all of them had been thrown overboard, and had already drifted too far away for a normal person to recover. Mani then stands up on the boat to look between his legs at the group; Lekha is revealed to have been the ghost all along, and the four remaining men, including Jai, retreat to a temple.\nThere, the men come under the protection of the local monk, armed with holy rice, holy water, and the temple is fortified with an enchanted \"safety ring\". Lekha quickly appears, in her terrifying ghostly form, and attacks. Initially, the holy \"weapons\" successfully keep Lekha at bay, but, in a panic, coupled with Jai's struggle to get back to his wife, all of the holy rice and water are wasted, and the monk was accidentally kicked out of the \"safety ring\". The monk then fled the temple, leaving the four, who had since destroyed the \"safety ring\" while trying to run, to face the angry Lekha. A pale Raj then reappears, and it was revealed that he is also human; he was in possession of the ring because he had stolen it off of the corpse behind the house to finance his gambling. Lekha angrily shouted at the five that she just wanted to be with her loved one, which the four friends argued against since they did not believe the living can be with the dead, and accuse her of killing the drunk; Lekha furiously denies her involvement and says that the drunk had drowned himself. Lekha, in a combination of sadness, anger, and desperation, then threatens to kill Jai and take him to live with her but stops when she sees how much she had been scaring her husband.\nJai then revealed that he knew the truth about Lekha all along, having had his suspicions raised during the game of charades. He had already looked at Lekha between his legs, which revealed her ghostly form, and found her decomposed corpse. However, even then, he is far more afraid of living without her than of her being dead. The two tearfully reconcile. His friends, seeing them reuniting, also tearfully reaffirm their friendship, and vow to never leave each other again. A flashback to Jai and Lekha's first meeting is shown.\nIn the credit scenes, Jai, Lekha, and his four friends live happily in the village. Lekha uses her supernatural abilities to do chores, play charades (and helping Mak win for the first time), scare off villagers who are attempting to drive her away (who are led by the village drunk's son), and even run the town's \"haunted house\" attraction.

She heads off to a cancer treatment center in Santa Monica where she helps patients undergoing chemotherapy with holistic treatments. \nAfter her shift, Beatriz drives to the Newport Beach home of an affluent client, Kathy, to give her a massage before her dinner party. During the massage, Beatriz tells Kathy that her neighbor killed one of her goats and becomes emotional. Later, when Beatriz unsuccessfully tries to start her car, she tells Kathy that a friend will come to repair it when he gets off work. Kathy invites Beatriz to stay for the dinner party. Kathy\u2019s husband Grant privately expresses his reservations about Beatriz joining them because they are entertaining important business connections, but he ultimately relents.\nThe first guests to arrive are married couple Shannon and Alex, who are about to make a small fortune off of a business venture. Beatriz introduces herself with warm hugs, which the guests receive awkwardly. Doug Strutt, the guest of honor and a real estate tycoon, then arrives with his wife Jeana. Kathy introduces Beatriz to Jeana and explains how they met: Beatriz helped treat Tara, Kathy and Grant's daughter who is currently away at college. Kathy claims Beatriz\u2019s alternative therapies helped Tara beat cancer. When Beatriz learns that her friend won't be able to come until morning, Kathy insists that she stay the night and asks her to sing a song for the guests after dinner. \nInteractions between Doug and Beatriz get off to a bad start with Doug mistaking her for one of the house staff members. Beatriz tells Doug he looks familiar to her and she might remember him from somewhere, and Doug tells her that because of his various businesses, it is possible she saw him in the news. During dinner, Beatriz begins to talk about her life and how she had to emigrate from Mexico when she was young. Doug asks her if she came to the country legally. All the guests, including Beatriz, drink wine during the dinner. At one point, Beatriz excuses herself to call a family member, asking if Doug was the man they protested back in Mexico. When she returns to the table, she asks Doug if he had a hotel in her home state of Guerrero. He says he does not recognize the name of the area, but mentions he has hotels located elsewhere in Mexico.\nBeatriz tells him how the hotel built in her hometown promised jobs and opportunities for her community but ended up destroying it; her family lost their home and the police killed protesters. Doug points out that his new project is a shopping center, not a hotel, and assures her the only ones losing their homes might be a few birds. Trying to diffuse the escalating tension, Kathy invites everyone into the living room for dessert. Jeana reveals she and Doug will be going to South Africa in the next couple of days, but she is expecting to be bored since Doug will be out hunting all day. Doug brags about his hunting of animals while on a safari and passes around a phone with a photo of a dead rhinoceros he hunted to the other guests. Once the phone reaches Beatriz, she becomes infuriated, calls the act \"disgusting\",  and throws the mobile at Doug. Beatriz exits the room, with Kathy telling everyone she's had an emotional week. Doug laughs it off, saying not everyone can handle the graphic image.\nAn emotional Beatriz apologizes to Kathy for losing her cool and promises to make it up to her. Kathy recommends she go to bed early and stop drinking since she's had a tough week. Beatriz obliges her and goes upstairs to Tara's room. While continuing to drink wine, Beatriz Googles Doug on the computer, which reveals Doug's businesses have been involved in various controversies and legal problems. Beatriz then decides to rejoin the guests, who are now sitting outside, and brings a guitar with her to perform the song Kathy asked of her earlier. She sings a song titled \"Las simples cosas,\" telling the guests it is about \"how we always want to go back to the places where we loved life, but the old, simple things are now gone.\" After the song, Beatriz tells Doug she mistook him for someone else and he is not the man who bought land in her hometown after all. She and Doug begin to trade words, with Doug insisting on the idea of manifest destiny, and Beatriz arguing that instead of hunting and killing, he should try healing. When the argument escalates and Beatriz calls out the privilege of the guests, an upset Grant tells her she needs to leave immediately and he will call a tow truck for her car. As Beatriz waits for the truck, Kathy attempts to give Beatriz money, but she declines.\nDoug follows Beatriz to the steps outside the house and tells her that no matter what, everything is going to die anyway, so she might as well enjoy herself and lighten up.

Now the movie goes back to 1947.\nIn August 1947, after India sought independence from the British, the Last Viceroy of India, Mountbatten gave Cyril Radcliffe, the responsibility of dividing India into two parts \u2013 India and Pakistan. Radcliffe drew two lines \u2013 one in Punjab and another one in Bengal. This line was known as the Radcliffe Line.\nBegum Jaan is a prostitute who runs a brothel between the cities of Shakargarh and Dorangla. The prostitutes in Begum Jaan's brothel are a number of girls she raised herself, who were either abandoned or disowned by their families and now work for her. The members of the brothel include an elderly woman known as Amma, Sujeet, a local worker who brings her customers and Salim, a gunman who guards them and also two dogs. They are pestered by government officers Hari Prasad, Ilyas Khan and Inspector Shyam Singh who visit her and ask all of the residents to evict the brothel, as it lies on the land that the Radcliffe Line is to pass through. Love is shown to blossom between Sujeet and Rubina. Begum Jaan's brothel is looked after by Raja Sahib, under whose protection, they are safe and sound. He pays their taxes and duties. Begum Jaan sends message to him for his help in this matter. He arrives at the brothel with gifts and presents for them and after hearing about their plight, he assures them of help by stating that he would be going to Delhi soon and discuss the matter there. However, he demands to spend the night with young Shabnam, who had recently joined the brothel as a mental wreck after abuse. Begum Jaan reluctantly forces Shabnam to sleep with Raja Sahib while she sings in the sidelines as he enjoys his night.\nAfter several failed attempts to convince Begum Jaan and her team to leave despite giving them a month's notice, as a last resort, Hari and Ilyas, enlist the help of Kabir, an infamous killer in Sonapur, to threaten Begum with her members to vacate the brothel. Raja Sahib returns to the brothel one day to inform Begum Jaan that his efforts to save her brothel have failed and now she must vacate the brothel. Begum, who was having hopes from Raja Sahib is shocked in dismay. Still, she stubbornly tells Raja Sahib come what may, she'll rather die in her house like a queen than die on the streets like a beggar. Kabir proceeds to kill Begum's beloved dogs, even feeding their meat to Begum and her girls. He then kills Sujeet while he is returning from the market with a few other girls of the brothel. He persuades the girls to escape while sacrificing his life. This killing enrages Begum Jaan and her members further. As a result of Kabir's intimidation tactics, Begum asks Salim to train every one of her girls to use weapons and fight back. Intensive training practice sessions are held.\nMeanwhile, Masterji, Laadli's teacher, is in love with Begum Jaan and proposes to her, unaware that another prostitute named Gulabo, harbors feelings for him as well. Begum Jaan rejects his proposal and asks him to leave, leading an irate Master to concoct a plan to kill her. He convinces Gulabo to run away from the brothel, betraying Begum Jaan. Gulabo does so but Masterji spurns her and gets her raped by his accomplices inside a horse carriage. She vows vengeance.\nThat same night, Kabir and his men attack the brothel. Laadli her mother and shabnam are forced to run away and are attacked by the policeman Shyam Singh, who seeks benefit from them, but laadli undresses herself which reminds him his ten years old daughter and he cries and asks her to stop. Begum and the girls fight back but to no avail. Gulabo returns and later slits Masterji's throat, while he is witnessing the attack on the brothel by Kabir and his goons. However, she has been badly assaulted by Masterji's accomplices and dies. The goons throw lighted torches inside the brothel, causing the building to be engulfed in flames. Begum Jaan and her girls put up a determined fight. Many are killed. She and her four surviving members smile while looking at their home being set ablaze; they walk inside the building and shut the doors.

Unable to do so, they allow her to access the City's map, revealing an abandoned level safe from Safeguard control where the villagers can evacuate to.\nCibo, now functioning through her only remaining arm, leads the remaining villagers to a trans-level railway car, but right after the villagers get in, a Watchtower spots them and spawns a gigantic Exterminator. Killy throws the device which has been keeping him safe from the Safeguard to Zuru, upon which he says that he still wants to find the Net Terminal Gene, which enables human control of the city and all machines, including the Safeguard. Killy seemingly sacrifices himself so that the villagers could escape. \nLater it is revealed that Zuru and other villagers successfully reached the abandoned level and established a new village there. Her granddaughter reminisces of the times when her grandmother Zuru used to tell about Killy, and it seems that the device Killy gave them is still in her possession.

In a tiny corner of the city, a little enclave known as the Electro-Fishers is facing eventual extinction, trapped between the threat of the Safeguard and dwindling food supplies.

Lin stops right outside the hospital, hesitates, and drives off to meet up with Xiao Su and their unit.\nBefore the unit arrives, Dr. James injects himself with a chemical substance and brings along a mechanical heart with him. As the unit escorts him away, they are ambushed by a squad of men in exotic black armor and high-tech weaponry led by a monstrous-looking man named Andre, who kills off most of the unit and severely injures Lin Dong and Xiao Su. Before Andre can capture Dr. James, Lin Dong pins him against an oil tank using his car. When Andre survives the car's impact, Lin shoots the oil tank, causing a huge explosion. As he lies gravely injured, Lin receives a phone call that Dr. James answers: Xixi has died at the hospital. However both Lin Dong and Andre are later shown to have survived, although Andre's injuries have him turned into a cyborg.\n13 years later in Sydney, Australia, author Rick Rogers has recently released a book titled Bleeding Steel about a US Marine implanted with a mechanical heart. A young man named Li Sen, disguised as a female prostitute, pays a visit to Rogers at his hotel, drugs him, and downloads information about the book from his computer. A black-clad woman storms the building and tortures Rogers to reveal the source of his inspiration for the book. While Li Sen hides in the suite's bathtub, the Woman in Black is attacked by Lin Dong, who has also come to find out the same answer. Rogers is killed by the Woman in Black, and the arrival of the police forces everyone to retreat.\nThe Woman in Black returns to a high-tech airship that serves as Andre's headquarters and briefs him about the failed operation. He identifies Lin Dong and Li Sen from CCTV footage and sends the Woman after the latter, but Li Sen has already fled. Acting upon the data he had taken from Rogers, Li Sen tracks down Nancy, a young woman who is plagued by nightmares about a laboratory where strange experiments were conducted. In order to deal with them, she has been visiting a spiritualist, who in turn told Rogers about the dreams. She is tracked down by the Woman in Black, but is rescued and taken to safety by Lin Dong and Li Sen's combined efforts.\nNancy is revealed to be Xixi, resurrected by Dr. James, who had been working on the genetic enhancement of human beings, and specifically regeneration, to create immortal bioroid soldiers. James fitted Xixi with the mechanical heart and infused her with the chemical substance he had injected himself with, a biogenetic blood substitute, which gave her regenerative abilities. However, Xixi's temporary death had left her with amnesia, and she was put into an orphanage for her own safety, while Lin Dong and his old unit secretly watched over her. Her nightmares stem from James' memories which imprinted themselves on the blood substitute he had injected himself with, and his blood was afterwards used in her resurrection. Andre, a former special forces soldier, was another test subject who infiltrated the project in the service of a prominent Korean arms dealer who wanted to steal James' research and use it for profit. The procedure failed on Andre, leaving his cells to slowly consume him from within, and in revenge he killed the arms dealer and his family. James himself died soon after his operation on Xixi, making her the sole successful subject of his achievements.\nLin Dong takes Xixi and Li Sen to his house, where he locks the young man in his advanced security vault and pays a visit to the spiritualist, who he finds murdered. Xixi runs away to take a flight back to James' abandoned home, where she recovers both her old memories of her father and a bank vault key hidden by James. Following her, Lin Dong reunites with Xiao Su, but before he can reach Xixi, she is kidnapped by the Woman in Black and is brought to Andre's airship and imprisoned in his laboratory. Rejoined by Li Sen, who had managed to free himself, they proceed to the bank vault, where the Woman in Black has been captured by Xiao Su while trying to retrieve the vault's contents: a video camera. Examining the contents of the camera's tape, which details Andre's botched bioroid conversion, Lin and Xiao Su surmise that Andre is dying and he needs Xixi's blood to bestow the regenerative effect upon himself to survive.\nOnboard Andre's airship, Andre proceeds to extract Xixi's blood and inject it into himself to restore his body. Lin Dong, Xiao Su, and Li Sen infiltrate the craft and try to break Xixi out but are thwarted by an impenetrable security screen. The trio battle Andre's henchmen, which forces him to join the fight before the transfusion is complete, which gives Xixi sufficient time to fully regenerate and come to her father's aid. Lin and the others cast Andre into the airship's reactor core, which overloads and destroys the lab, but Li Sen is caught in an explosion. Xiao Su and Xixi manage to escape the airship by parachute, but Lin Dong is attacked by Andre before he can join them. Because Andre had accidentally injected Lin Dong with Xixi's enhanced blood during their earlier encounter, Lin Dong gains enough strength to fight him off and rips Andre's heart out of his chest. Without a parachute, Lin jumps off the airship before a final explosion destroys the craft, killing Andre, but Xiao Su and Xixi catch him using their own chute's canopy.\nIn the aftermath, as Lin Dong, Xixi and Xiao enjoy time together, Lin learns from his colleague that Li Sen was the son of the arms dealer who had sought James' research, and for years he had planned to take revenge on Andre for the murder of his family. Lin also realizes that Li had been a friend of Nancy/Xixi at the orphanage and had acted out of genuine affection for her.

They all head out to Olivia's parents' summer home in an island to shoot a short film. On the island they meet Mang Pedring, a caretaker who instantly causes the group to feel uneasy. Olivia notices Kenly's cold nature towards her, causing her to think he has found someone new. She discovers that Kenly has been dating Marie all along, much to her dismay. To top it all off, Eunice has known the entire time and chose to remain oblivious, thinking she is protecting her friend. A fight ensues on both parties.\nThe next morning, when their shooting commences, Olivia forgives her friends. Soon, a storm starts, prompting the group to stop shooting. That night, the friends decide to play a game of \"Bloody Crayons,\" a form of \"truth or dare?\" with a twist. Everyone is instructed to form a circle around a box that has four sets of five crayons\u2014black, white, pink, blue and red. Each color represents a consequence, and each player will draw one crayon at a time. Black represents a rule to be given by the drawer. This rule is to be followed during the course of the game until the next black crayon is drawn. Failure to follow the rule means the drawer will vandalize the face of the violator. White represents immunity of the drawer from the rule until the next white crayon is drawn. Pink crayons represent friendship and whoever draws a pink crayon will choose a friend and have them make the drawer perform a dare. Blue crayons represent honesty. The drawer will confess something they have not done. If the other friends have done the confession, they have to vandalize their own faces. The drawer can also write on the face of someone they know has done the confession. Lastly, red is considered the bloody crayon, the most exciting piece in the game. The three people to draw the first three red crayons will be given the chance to each put a substance of their choosing in a cup and the last person to draw the red crayon will unfortunately drink the mixture. The game is over when the last red crayon is drawn.\nThe game commences and everything takes a turn. But the game heated up when Olivia draws the blue crayon and confesses that Olivia slept with Kenly last week regarding Kenly's and Marie's relationship roots up again. The anger causes Marie to draw the last red crayon, prompting her to drink the concoction the other friends have made. Marie vomits after ingesting the liquid. The group panics and gives Marie her water from her personal drinking bottle. She drinks the water, vomits blood and gets killed. Suspicion surrounds Olivia, causing her to run away in fright while a furious Kenly chases after her. The others watch in terror as Olivia had plummeted to her death on a cliff, turning suspicion on Kenly. Getting more violent, Kiko and John bind Kenly to a chair with ropes, much to the others' disagreement. As the group begins to blame one another, a bothered Richalaine goes out of the room only to be seen by Mang Pedring peering over the corpse of Marie.

When Kiko goes to check on him, they find him dead with his throat slashed. An angered Justin (who found a gun lying around the house earlier) threatens to kill them, insisting one of the remaining friends killed Kenly. John fights with Justin, after Kiko gets knocked out.

Richalaine steals the gun from Justin while being chased by the latter and hides in an upstairs bedroom. Justin chases Richalaine, steals the gun back from her and threatens to kill her, blaming her for Kenly's death. Justin slips in Richalaine's defense and knocks his head on a sink, rendering him unconscious. Eunice goes back for her remaining friends as John runs off into the woods.\nKiko attempts to aid Gerard but is weakened by his gunshot wound. Gerald eventually dies.

Justin tries to kill the both of them but Richalaine attempts to fend him off only for them to fall down a flight of stairs, killing the two instantly. Eunice eventually sees Justin and Richalaine's dead body and mourns as she gets reunited with Kiko. The two are greeted at the door by John who claims to have found a speed boat. Kiko grows suspicious, wondering how John was able to open the door with Mang Pedring's own set of keys. John explains Mang Pedring got killed by one of his animal traps but Kiko, still doubtful, attempts to fight him only for John to fall on a hidden pit. John survives the fall because of a ladder and follows the pit instead. John notices that the pit leads to the same exact location where Olivia was killed but her body was nowhere to be found.\nAs the pair arrive at the shore, they see a speedboat, indicating John was truthful all along. Suddenly, Olivia's voice emanates from Eunice's walkie-talkie, begging for help. Eunice and Kiko go back in the house only to find an unscathed Olivia. Kiko's suspicions are transferred to Olivia because of her survival from the fall without even suffering any bruises or major injuries, he attempts to warn Eunice only to be stabbed in the back with a knife, revealing Olivia was the perpetrator all along. Olivia chases Eunice around the house with a hunting rifle. John arrives to the rescue but ends up getting shot by Olivia, seemingly killing him. Olivia then chases Eunice into the woods. During the chase, Eunice discovers Mang Pedring\u2019s body impaled to one of his animal traps. Eunice and Olivia eventually ends up on the same cliff where they thought Kenly pushed Olivia at the beginning of the movie. Olivia explains that she only intended to kill Kenly, Marie and her but claims innocence on the death of the others. Olivia said that it wasn\u2019t her fault that their friends decided to kill each other. She also claims that Mang Pedring\u2019s death was because of his own stupidity by not knowing his own traps.

Suddenly, a drone controlled by John flies towards them which knocks Olivia and leaves her dangling from the cliff. Eunice grabs her hand in time.

The next day, Bouchard returns to the mob's headquarters, where he is viewed with suspicion until a doctor takes a blood sample that shows amphetamines and caffeine in his blood system, in line with his story. \nDavid returns to stealing cars for Sylvio Dipietro (Jenkins) and Mike Dubois (Beaupre), Dipietro's fixer, and Dipietro announces that they need 30 cars in 5 days. In their meetings at Ward's operation's headquarters, a disused curling arena, Bouchard meets the rest of Ward's team, particularly MC (Mazza), the tech whiz. To assist in their efforts to figure out why Dipietro needs so many cars so quickly, MC gives Bouchard an earpiece that allows him to stay in contact with Ward, and a cigarette with a camera at the end, since Bouchard usually has a cigarette tucked behind his ear. Bouchard returns to the chop-shop having stolen Carey Price's pick-up truck complete with his goalie mask. Realizing that this could throw Price off his game and affect the Montreal Canadiens, Bouchard seeks out someone he can trust to return the mask to the goalkeeper. Bouchard also manages to video the chop-shop's computer set up, which enables MC to hack the system and gain access to cameras and microphones in the chop-shop. That night at a strip club run by Dubois and where Bouchard is staying after the raid, the customers behind the mysterious order for stolen cars are meeting with DiPietro. Bouchard contrives a way to catch footage of the three men with his secret cigarette camera, but afterwards, on the street to smoke with Dubois, he lights the cigarette, which sparks. Ward follows the car with the three mysterious customers, and they return to the United States Consulate General in Montreal. When Ward returns to the Consulate the next day to investigate, he is stonewalled and told to come back another day. \nBouchard's daughter is applying to become a police officer at Nicolet and he sees her regularly. Ward, however, is estranged from his son, Jonathan (Knudsen). When Ward does call Jonathan to share important news apparently related to Ward's health, Jonathan angrily hangs up and tells his father not to call again. \nDubois, who already hates Bouchard because of his habit of calling Dubois 'Michel', presents evidence to Dipietro that Dubois's escape from Ward was staged. MC and Ward watch this discussion and are able to determine that Bouchard is burned, but when Ward orders Bouchard to break cover, Bouchard refuses and returns to Dipietro's HQ. There, they give him another task, to drive a car to a town in Maine. While Bouchard waits at the designated spot in a busy Maine town, MC and Ward use their access to Dipietro's video and microphone systems to surveil the office, where Dipietro, Dubois, and the three customers are discussing testing a satellite. Realizing that they will use the satellite to detonate a bomb in Bouchard's car, Ward orders Bouchard to run. Bouchard, however, refuses to leave the car at the busy intersection where it might harm innocents, and speeds away. He narrowly escapes the car before the explosion, but is arrested by inept local police. \nAfter waiting several hours for the FBI to arrive to investigate this apparent act of terrorism, the town sheriff decides to interrogate Bouchard. The sheriff and two other officers find Bouchard's claims to be a French-Canadian police officer unbelievable, since they think Bouchard is contradicting himself when he claims to be both French and Canadian and do not recognize Bouchard's Quebecois dialect as French. Eventually, the FBI, led by Agent Blaine (Apergis), arrive, as does Ward, who the FBI promptly arrests. Handcuffed together in the interrogation room overnight, Ward and Bouchard discuss their lives, and Ward finally reveals that he has been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease, hence his hand tremors. They agree that if they are freed, they will get to the bottom of the car-smuggling mystery, so that Ward can go out a hero, rather than an \"old, sick man.\" The next morning, Agent Blaine lets them go, completely dismissing their warnings about the exploding cars that seem likely to be sent to the United States.  \nWhen Ward and Bouchard return to the curling rink, the find the center empty except for MC, who explains that their superiors shut down the operation and the Dipietro's criminals have left the garage. They decide to push on with their investigation, and find out that the Dubois is still at the strip club he manages. They burst in, and after a confrontation with Dubois, who takes one of the escorts hostage, capture him. They interrogate him in Bouchard's wife's garage, where Dubois eventually breaks down when Ward tells him that he is dying and has nothing to lose, so is doesn't care if Dubois lives through the night. Ward, Bouchard, and Dubois go to the location where the five last exploding cars will depart from. From a sniper's nest, Ward shoots and injures the four of the drivers to prevent them from leaving with their exploding cars, but the last driver is his son, Jonathan. Explosives in the four cars that did not leave detonate, and Ward is distraught, thinking his son is dead. However, Bouchard and MC explain that Jonathan's car did not explode and they still have a chance to save him. \nWard and Bouchard then go to the US Consulate, where Agent Blaine and the three other conspirators are shown together discussing how their false-flag operation to provoke a renewed war on terror in the United States will make them heroes. When Bouchard shoots his gun in the lobby to cut the queue, Blaine emerges and takes them to his officer, where he explains that they were right, and he has broken up the terrorist plot and seized their computers. However, MC informs Ward over an earpiece that the signal just turned on again, which leads Ward to question Blaine, who then pulls a gun on the duo. They manage to subdue him in his office, and flee in a Consulate car to find the source of the signal that will trigger the exploding cars. They find the armored truck and corner it in an alley, but the man inside the vault shoots himself rather than open the door. Ward commandeers the vehicle and drives off, saying he will drive it into a river to submerge the truck and smother the signal, preventing the explosions, but Bouchard gives chase and manages to climb onto the truck and obstructs Ward's view, so that the truck crashes. They then use a mobile crane to lift the truck and drive it to a canal, where they drop it into the water with seconds to spare, preventing the explosion. In New York, Jonathan calls his father and the senior Ward gives Jonathan instructions about escaping the scene before the police arrive. \nSeveral months later, Bouchard and Ward, dressed in tuxedos and Ward using a cane, attend a ceremony with the President of the United States, where he awards them the Medal of Honor for their actions saving countless American lives. Jonathan is in the audience, apparently reconciled with his father, and Bouchard's daughter is in a police cadet uniform.", "tmdb_plot": "Ward and Bouchard must face an important car theft ring that turns out to be a lot more than they bargained for: one where the stolen cars will serve as bombs in a well planned terrorist attack.", "tmdb_id": "417489", "wiki_id": "52628922"}, {"title": "Nobody's Perfect!", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Gerard is tired of being taken for naive by his in-laws.

He tries to keep up, but in doing so suffers a violent crash, leaving him badly injured and ending his worst season on record prematurely, while Storm goes on to win the Piston Cup.\nFour months later, Lightning, who has since recovered from his crash, decides that he will continue racing and calls his sponsors, Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze, who reveal they have sold Rust-eze to a businessman named Sterling. Sterling assigns Lightning to train under Cruz Ramirez, where he struggles to adapt to the modern training methods. After Lightning accidentally damages a simulator, Sterling tries to force him to retire. Adamant that he can still race, Lightning instead offers that if he wins the upcoming Florida 500, he can decide if he wants to keep racing; otherwise he will retire immediately. Sterling reluctantly accepts the deal. Lightning tries to train on nearby Fireball Beach, but ends up spending most of his time teaching Cruz how to drive on the sand. Lightning then attempts to join a race undercover at a famous dirt track called Thunder Hollow, but inadvertently enters a figure-8-style demolition derby with Cruz, which she wins with both of them hiding their identities. Lightning's cover is blown when Cruz accidentally swerves to avoid a water truck, causing him to tumble over and spilling his water on Lightning, adding to his humiliation.\nFrustrated for wasted his time taking care of Cruz, Lightning rages at her and accidentally breaks her trophy. An upset Cruz reveals that she had wanted to be a racer just like Lightning all her life, but never started a race due to her feeling that she could never be one. She resigns as Lightning's trainer and heads back to the training center. Guilty and with no other options, Lightning calls his friend Mater for advice. He suggests that Lightning track down Doc Hudson's mentor Smokey, in his hometown of Thomasville, Georgia, so Lightning catches up to Cruz and convinces her to rejoin him. There, he meets up with Smokey, who reveals that despite the fact Doc never raced again, he found new happiness in training Lightning. After accepts the fact that Lightning will never be as fast as Storm, Smokey and Doc's old friends, Louise \"Barnstormer\" Nash, River Scott, and Junior \"Midnight\" Moon, help him learn new tricks to overcome his speed disadvantage, using Cruz as his sparring partner. However, during the final practice race, Cruz suddenly overtakes him and he suffers a flashback to his crash, shaking his confidence.\nAt the Florida 500, Lightning starts at the back, but with assistance from Smokey in the pits, manages to gradually push up the ranks. Sterling, who still believes Lightning can't win, orders Cruz back to the training center to prepare a rookie for the following race, despite her wanting to stay and watch the race. Overhearing the exchange and remembering Cruz's dream of racing, Lightning avoids a massive multi-car pile-up and has his crew outfit her to take his place in the race, believing she is the key to defeating Storm. While shaky at first, Cruz is able to push up the ranks, thanks to Lightning coaching her from the pits, and eventually ends up right behind Storm. Feeling threatened, he tries to intimidate Cruz, even to the point of ramming her against the wall in the final lap. Using one of Doc's old moves, Cruz flips over Storm, overtaking him and winning the race.\nAs she celebrates her victory, Sterling offers her a role on his team, but she instead takes a counteroffer from Dinoco's owner Tex Dinoco. Since Lightning and Cruz were both wearing #95, both have won the race, meaning that Lightning gets to decide if he is done racing. Some time later, Lightning and Cruz return to Radiator Springs, where Lightning reveals that Tex has bought Rust-eze from Sterling. Now decked in Doc's old racing colors, Lightning decides to continue racing, but trains Cruz first for the season.", "tmdb_plot": "Blindsided by a new generation of blazing-fast racers, the legendary Lightning McQueen is suddenly pushed out of the sport he loves.

He says Nora killed herself by hanging after she left the hospital and accuses Jane of driving Nora to insanity. Jane realizes Nora's father is Alex and breaks out of the institution. In the same way as Clara, she is tasered.\nShe wakes up in her home and sees Clara dead. Alex enters and explains that he wanted to punish her for trying to help Nora, his daughter. Nora had attacked him in self defense, which led to his disfigured face, and he staged the car accident to explain his injuries and make it onto the donor list for a skin graft. He also stopped paying Nora's bills to get her out, and made her break into Jane's house and psychologically torment her. The night of the murder, Alex had broken in and drugged Jane, which led her to accidentally kill Miles.\nJane finds Dr. Terry in a pool of blood. While attempting to escape through the window, she is pulled back by Alex. She grabs at his face and pulls off the grafted skin as she falls.

Gruner says the previous weather observer cannot return with the ship as he has died from typhus, possibly swimming in the sea, and there is no body. The captain suggests the newcomer leave with him but he refuses.\nThe unnamed man explores the island, seeing strange rock circles on the beach. When he returns to the cabin he finds the diary of the previous meteorologist which talks of strange creatures from the sea attacking; soon after reading this he is beset at night by the creatures. He hides in the cellar and jabs one of the creatures, which looks through the floorboards, causing them to flee. The next day he calls to Gruner to let him into the lighthouse, but to no avail. In the cabin he discovers a rifle among the baggage, and, determined to make a stand, he reinforces the cabin. At night the creatures come and he shoots at them. Eventually, he has to resort to starting a fire as there are too many to take on. This causes them to flee but ruins the cabin.\nThe next day he observes Gruner leaving the lighthouse, and follows him down to the rocks where he discovers a female sea creature. Gruner prevents him from shooting her and shows that she is 'tame'. Gruner gives the man the name \"Friend\" and  he explains that like a dog she will not leave her master no matter how cruel he is. She licks Friend's wounded hand and it heals.\nFriend offers to share ammunition and other supplies with Gruner if he can stay in the lighthouse, which Gruner accepts. He wonders if the creatures keep coming for the lighthouse because they want to reclaim the female sea creature. More creatures attack that night, but Friend faints and Gruner becomes angry at his uselessness and tells him to do menial activities such as fetch water instead. The next night Gruner locks Friend outside on the balcony with his gun, leaving him to see if he can fend for himself against the creatures. In the morning Gruner discovers him covered in creature blood but alive.\nThe two men settle into a routine; the creatures attack several nights and they are forced to constantly keep watch.

He shows one shaped like a boat to Aneris and she leads him to an abandoned boat on the beach. He tells Gruner about it but Gruner says the boat is too small for an escape from the island, and that he knew it was there, remaining from when a Portuguese man had used it to escape a shipwreck, but had been killed by the creatures. He says the ship's cargo contained dynamite but the only dynamite the Portuguese man had brought with him had been water-logged.\nFriend shows interest in exploring the shipwreck, while Gruner does not. However, after seeing Friend swimming in a pool with Aneris, Gruner changes his mind due to jealousy, secretly hoping that Friend might die in the attempt. They use the boat to row out to the wreck and Friend dons an old diving suit to go down and search for the dynamite. While recovering some, he sees child-like versions of the creatures playing. Once they return, they discover that the recovered dynamite is dry enough to use.\nFriend and Gruner form a plan to lure as many sea creatures to the lighthouse before setting off dynamite, believing that the show of force will drive them off. Aneris is forced onto the balcony and made to 'sing' to attract them. The creatures attack, but Gruner fails to set off the explosives, forcing Friend to run to the top of the lighthouse to reconnect the detonator. The resulting blast kills many of the creatures. Gruner sets off a secondary set of explosives closer to the lighthouse, knocking both Friend and himself unconscious.\nIn the morning, Gruner finishes off the wounded and dying creatures that are lying on the beach with a harpoon. Friend believes the creatures are more civilized than Gruner makes them out to be after seeing one of the dead creatures wearing a necklace. Gruner, enraged, hurls it into the sea. He explains that he found Aneris sea creature years ago as a baby trapped in a net and rescued her, believing that she owes him her life. The following night the creatures do not attack, and a great wailing sound comes from the sea which Friend takes to be mourning. Aneris disappears. While Gruner sleeps, Friend discovers a photo of Gruner as a young man with a wife.\nFriend resumes walking along the beach and leaves a carved present for the creatures. He discovers a child creature investigating his present, and Aneris returns, appearing more confident and bold. They are interrupted by Gruner firing a gun.

Gruner commands Aneris to return to him but she refuses, causing him to scream that 'no-one leaves Gruner'.

Friend runs after Gruner as he continues to fire flares, and after a struggle throws him to the ground and stabs his leg. Gruner gains the upper hand and attempts to kill Friend with an axe, but Friend reveals that Gruner is the previous meteorologist and urges Gruner to stop, telling him that he is not a murderer. Gruner drops the axe and staggers outside to be killed by the sea creatures.\nSometime later, the next ship arrives to replace Friend.

Jin-tae receives Cheol-ryung from the airport, where they head for Myeong-Dong to check on one of Ki-seong's men Park Myung-ho, but Cheol-ryong escapes after learning about Jin-tae's mission. Cheol-ryung arrives at Myeong-Dong to Jongro where Jin-tae also reaches there and interrogates Park, but the latter escapes. After the orders from his superior, Jin-tae takes Cheol-ryung to his home to spy on him. \nHaving guessed the latter's plan, Cheol-ryung removes the SIM card which Jin-tae had inserted in his phone to track his location anytime.

After checking Park's belongings, the officials learn about Cheol-ryung's mission. \nMeanwhile, Jin-tae learns about Cheol-ryung's past and decide to help him. They reach the place where Ki-seong has arranged a deal to sell the plates, but Ki-seong kills the buyer where Cheol-ryung arrives and kills the henchmen where he is about Ki-seong, but Jin-tae stops him which gives time for Ki-seong to escape. Cheol-ryung takes the master plates and leaves. However, Ki-seong kidnaps Jin-tae's family and demands the plates. A frightened Jin-tae tells Cheol-ryung, where he takes the plates and heads to the location. Jin-tae and Cheol-ryung arrives and gives the plates to Ki-seong, who leaves Jin-tae's family where Jin-tae takes his family to a safe place.

Both have reasons to climb the culinary ladder\u2014When Sky was ten years old, his father, Mountain Ko (Anthony Wong), left him behind with his friend, Uncle Seven (Ge You), master chef of Seven Restaurant. When asked why, Mountain told Sky that he has no talent as a cook and he would only take him back if he can prove to be a great cook. In reality, Mountain chose to pursue his culinary career over being a father and made the excuse that Sky can't even make a decent bowl of noodles. Because of that, Sky spent twenty years training to become a great chef under Uncle Seven. On the other side, Paul made a promise to his dying father that he would become a great cook. Through that journey, he became a highly successful chef in Europe and decides to run his own restaurant in Hong Kong, Stellar. However, this brings conflict between Paul and Sky.\nIn an old area of Hong Kong, Sky is now an acclaimed chef at Seven. However, the Li Management Group arrives and starts buying various properties of the old sector, including developing Stellar for Paul. The opening of Stellar proves to be a threat to Sky as these two chefs find themselves fighting for the best ingredients in the markets and maintaining their clientele. Stellar's fine haute cuisine represents a form of aggressive gentrification to the neighborhood and a threat to traditional Chinese cuisine. Their rivalry begins with a challenge for the best fish and the culinary masters agreed to face each other in a culinary duel. Sky makes a traditional salt-baked duck while Paul makes a foie gras sorbet. While both tied in points, the judges declare Paul the victor, as his dish presentation was superior to Sky's bland plating. Although the victory should've solidified Paul's abilities as a cook, things do not go as expected.\nIt was while celebrating their victory that the manager of Li Group tells Paul he wants to replace him with Mei You (Michelle Bai), sous chef and girlfriend, reasoning that a woman is far more appealing on media than a man. Betrayed and confused, Paul tries to defend his position as head chef, but Mei You exposes his dark secret: Paul has problems tasting certain flavors, especially saltiness. To compensate, he would utilize a notebook containing all his recipes and have others test taste for him. To make matters worse, the manager announces that he and Mei You are romantically involved. Mei You explains to Paul that she never loved him and only sided with him to surpass him. Now that she can take the title as executive chef of Stellar, she doesn't need Paul anymore. Angry that he has lost everything, Paul leaves.\nSky bumps into Paul drinking at an event stadium. Both share their past and troubles, and find mutual respect for each other. Both have a common goal of reaching the culinary top and decided to team up. At Seven, the Li Group wants Uncle Seven to sign away his restaurant, but Uncle Seven refuses. Paul and Sky then appear, announcing their partnership. Paul reminds the manager that as the winner of the competition, he is eligible to compete at the culinary championship, not the Li Group. Surprised by that technicality, the Li Group leaves, hypocritically calling Paul a traitor but not before Paul headbutted the manager in revenge. Sky trains Paul in the ways of Chinese cooking as well as developing Paul's limited palate to help create something new for the competition.\nIn Macau, at the Studio City Casino, attending the 7th International Culinary Competition, Sky and Paul use both their culinary strengths to compete against four other great chefs. Whoever wins the competition will gain the chance to face the current god of Cookery, Mountain Ko. In this competition, they face a French team, Indian team, a Japanese chef, and Mei You. The French team make a roasted squab dish, the Indian team make a five-flavor curry, the Japanese chef makes koi nigiri, Mei You, impliying that she is in the final stage thanks to mangager\u2019s bribery because she hadn\u2019t enrrolled to be in the competition, makes an oyster dish with frozen foam, and the duo create a deconstructed mapo tofu. Paul used Sky's sense of taste to help him determine the flavor of the ingredients and Sky relies on Paul's knowledge of molecular science and culinary artistry to create a traditional dish with a modern design. The victory goes to Paul and Sky. In defeat, a shameful Mei You is unable to bring herself to look at Paul's in the eyes for having betrayed him and now once again having to live under Paul's shadow.\nBefore the final round, Paul points out only one chef can compete against Mountain and he realizes Sky's desire to beat Mountain was a very personal one. Grateful he managed to make it this far with his condition, Paul gives Sky the chance to face his father. In the final competition, Sky finally faces his father, and the judges allow the two to cook anything they want as long as it is considered the highest expression of cooking. While Mountain begins cooking, Sky is distracted by his thoughts about how Seven and the people in the neighborhood mean the most to him. Mountain angrily splashes water at his son's face, demanding that he focus and show him something. Mountain creates a beautiful artistic sugar display of molten lava with a single flower on top. Sky cooks something far more personal: an interpretation of the original noodle dish that Mountain made all those years ago before abandoning Sky. Before the judges can score the dish, Sky gives the bowl of noodles to Mountain, who is moved as he remembers what the noodles represent. Acknowledging his skills as a chef, Mountain calls his son brilliant before Sky walks off the stage. Mountain continues to emotionally eat his noodles, with the victor unclear.\nSome time has passed and the people at Seven are getting ready for a poon choi Chinese New Year party with the neighborhood's people.

She wants Charles to investigate Aristide's death, and suspects he was murdered by a member of their sprawling and idiosyncratic family. Sophia notes that Aristide's regular insulin injection had been laced with eserine from his eye drops, causing a fatal heart attack. Sophia believes this was deliberate, not accidental. Charles reluctantly takes on the case, in part because he had a brief love affair with her in Cairo. Charles seeks the consent of Chief Inspector Taverner of Scotland Yard to look into the case, utilising his personal connection with Taverner, who had served with Charles's father, a decorated former Assistant Commissioner.\nAt the Leonides estate, Charles interviews the various members of the family, finding motives for each of them. All of them get substantial bequests from Aristide's estate but all resented the way he bullied and manipulated them.\nLady Edith de Haviland was the sister of Aristide's late first wife; she moved in to care for her motherless nephews. She despised her brother-in-law as a parvenu and for his callousness towards his grandchildren. Edith stalks around the grounds, blasting moles in the lawn with a shotgun.\nAristide's elder son, Philip, hated his father for passing him over as successor to the family business, and for refusing to fund production of a screenplay he wrote for his wife, Magda, a fading theatre actress.\nPhilip and Magda provided Aristide with three grandchildren: Sophia, Eustace (a teenager crippled by polio), and Josephine (a clever 12-year-old, who spies on everyone and writes it down in her notebook).\nThe younger son, Roger, is managing director of a major family business, but is a failure, requiring multiple bail-outs from Aristide. His domineering wife Clemency is a plant biologist with extensive knowledge of poisons.\nAristide's second wife, Brenda, is much younger, a former Las Vegas casino dancer. The others suspect her of killing Aristide, especially Roger, who denounces her as a gold-digging slut. She did administer the fatal insulin injection. Also, she is having an affair with Laurence Brown, private tutor for the Leonides children. And when Aristide's will is produced, it is unsigned. Thus he died intestate, and Brenda will inherit his entire estate.\nCharles's inquiries meet with hostility from most of the family. Josephine hints that she has found clues she does not disclose, to Charles's irritation. Events take a new, horrific turn when the ladder to Josephine's treehouse is sabotaged and she falls from the tree, having to be hospitalised. Charles suspects that this was due to Josephine's habit of spying on the other family members and the killer thus wanting to silence her.\nCharles' suspicions even extend to Sophia after a new, properly signed will is discovered, leaving the estate to her. Eustace even suggests that Sophia hired Charles to investigate the murder due to their personal history, knowing he would never accuse her due to their romantic past.\nAfter those developments, Taverner arrives in person to take charge of the case; he feels Charles' romantic history with Sophia does not make him objective enough to solve it. The discovery of love letters between Brenda and Laurence gives Taverner enough evidence to arrest them for Aristide's murder and the attempt on Josephine.\nCharles, however, remains unconvinced that Brenda and Laurence are guilty, noting Brenda's childlike intelligence and Laurence's pacifist, left-wing views as making them unlikely candidates for being murderers. Sophia and Edith seem to agree. Sophia notes that the letters could have been forged, and Edith insists on \"the best lawyer\" to represent Brenda and Laurence. Edith visits a London doctor, and learns she is dying of cancer. Charles returns to the estate after being in London when Josephine's nanny is fatally poisoned by hot chocolate that she had prepared for herself and Josephine.\nCharles implores Josephine to name the killer, as he has worked out that she knows. Again, Josephine smugly refuses to tell, even when Charles warns her that she is in danger. Edith collects Josephine, and drives out of the estate (supposedly for ice cream), lying to get past the police at the gate.\nThe coroner finds that the nanny died of cyanide poisoning, Charles suspects Edith, who used cyanide to kill moles. He searches Edith's garden shed, and finds a bottle of cyanide; also Josephine's missing notebook, buried in quicklime that would have destroyed it.\nCharles and Sophia take off in pursuit of Edith, who left a note for Charles to find in his car. Sophia reads Edith's note: it is a confession to the murder, but Charles doesn't believe it.\nSophia then starts reading from Josephine's notebook, and discovers the horrible truth: Josephine murdered Aristide. He had stopped her ballet lessons (with insulting comments), and she was bored. Josephine also staged her fall from the treehouse, poisoned the nanny, who had begun to suspect her, and forged Brenda's love letters. Lady Edith had worked out that Josephine was the killer and confessed to exonerate Brenda and Laurence, and perhaps to spare Josephine a life in psychiatric institutions and a lifetime reputation as a monster.

Ireland was particularly badly affected. A cure was later discovered, and 75% of those infected who could be captured have been treated and cured of the virus. The remaining 25% have proven resistant to the cure. The two groups are known as the Cured and the Resistant. The Resistant are held in captivity, despite public fears that keeping them alive could lead to another outbreak.\nSenan and Conor are Cured patients who have been interned together. Their 'Rehabilitation Officer', Sergeant Cantor, has little faith that the Cured can integrate back into society without further violence, and treats them with hostility. Senan reunites with his sister-in-law, Abbie, who has a young son, Cillian. Abbie asks Senan what became of her husband, Luke, Senan's brother, who is still missing. Senan claims ignorance of his fate, though it is revealed in one of Senan's many flashbacks that Conor infected Senan, who then killed Luke, in the house that Abbie still lives in. The Cured have a detailed memory of what they have done while infected; many of them suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder. Conor, formerly a lawyer with political aspirations, cannot find work and is shunned by his family for his acts while infected. He forms an underground movement called the Cured Alliance, with the aim of regaining the civil liberties that the Cured have lost.\nThe government is planning to euthanise the 25% (5,000 patients) who are resistant to the vaccine, despite the assertions of a prominent virologist that a better vaccine for the Resistant is nearly developed. Senan takes a job at the hospital where the Resistant are housed, and observes that they show no interest in attacking the Cured. This is a source of political tension in the community, as the never-infected suspect aloud that the Cured would love to see another outbreak of the Maze Virus, as they would be largely immune to its effects.\nConor attempts to recruit Senan into the Cured Alliance. Senan initially refuses, but after experiencing the hostility of society towards the Cured, he takes part in an arson mission for the group. Conor claims that the targets are uninhabited houses, but a soldier is killed and Cantor suspects Senan and Conor. Cantor approaches Abbie at her house and tells her that the infected are linked in some telepathic manner, and that they form into packs like predatory animals. He suggests that the predatory traits are not eliminated by the vaccine, and that the Cured are still dangerous. He shows Abbie a photograph of Conor and Senan roaming together when they were infected. Conor appeared to be leading Senan in murderous acts in the photo. Conor later approaches Abbie, and tacitly admits that he and Senan killed her husband while they were infected during the early days of the outbreak.\nAbbie confronts Senan and throws him out. Senan realises that Conor has no remorse for what he has done in the past, and what he is still doing. Senan assists Cantor in a sting operation to arrest Conor after he confesses aloud to the arson; however, Conor violently murders Cantor and flees. The Cured Alliance initiate a plan to free the Resistant from their confinement. The Resistant take to the streets, killing and infecting new victims and causing mass chaos. Irish Army troops are deployed. Senan finds Abbie, who is frantically trying to retrieve Cillian from his school. Senan rescues Cillian but is confronted by Conor, who beats him savagely. A soldier shoots Conor but he escapes. Senan, Abbie and Cillian return to their house, but Cillian is bitten and infected. Senan, knowing he is immune, takes Cillian, and tells Abbie he will keep him safe until another vaccine is available.\nSome time later, a news broadcast announces that order has been restored, although 8,000 new infected people are now in captivity.

Churchill includes Chamberlain (as Lord President of the Council) and Halifax (as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs). Churchill has a poor reputation in Parliament because of his record in the Admiralty, his role in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in the First World War, his views on India, the Russian civil war and his past defection from the Liberal Party.\nParliament reacts coolly to Churchill's first speech promising \"Blood, toil, tears, and sweat\". Chamberlain and Halifax are appalled by Churchill's refusal to negotiate for peace and plan to resign from the government to force a vote of no confidence, creating a situation in which Halifax would be likely to become the Prime Minister.\nChurchill visits French Prime Minister Paul Reynaud, who thinks Churchill delusional for not admitting that the Allies are losing the Battle of France, while Churchill becomes furious that the French do not have a plan to counterattack. Although US President Franklin Roosevelt is sympathetic to Churchill's plight, his actions are limited by an isolationist Congress and the Neutrality Acts. Churchill draws ire from his cabinet and advisers for delivering a radio address in which he falsely implies the Allies to be advancing in France, earning him a rebuke from the King. Halifax and Chamberlain continue to push to use Italian Ambassador Giuseppe Bastianini as an intermediary with Germany.\nThe British Expeditionary Force is trapped at Dunkirk and Calais, and Britain begins preparing for a German invasion. Against the advice of the War Cabinet Churchill orders Brigadier Nicholson in Calais to lead the 30th Infantry Brigade to distract the enemy and buy time for the evacuation of soldiers from Dunkirk. Layton tells Churchill that her brother was killed during the retreat.\nThe debacle in France causes the War Cabinet to support negotiating with Germany. Under heavy pressure, Churchill agrees to consider a negotiated peace, but chokes on the words as he tries to dictate a letter requesting talks. George VI unexpectedly visits Churchill; the King explains that he has come to support Churchill to continue the war. Churchill's idea of a \"small boats\" evacuation of troops from Dunkirk, Operation Dynamo, is initiated. Still uncertain, Churchill impulsively rides the London Underground (for the first time in his life) and asks startled passengers their opinions; the civilians all want to continue to fight Hitler. Churchill addresses the Outer Cabinet and other Members of Parliament and rallies their support.\nAs Churchill prepares to address Parliament, Halifax asks Chamberlain to continue with their plan to resign, but Chamberlain decides first to listen to the address. Towards the end of his speech, Churchill proclaims that \"we shall fight on the beaches\" should the Germans invade, to resounding support from the Opposition, while the Tory MPs behind him sit silently, until Chamberlain mops his brow with his handkerchief, a prearranged signal that they should support the PM. Churchill exits the chamber to cheers and enthusiastic waving of order papers.", "tmdb_plot": "A thrilling and inspiring true story begins on the eve of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation.

He finally has a breakthrough and begins to build something from the center and work his way out. When Annie comes home, she is surprised to find Dave's project: a small cardboard fort that is supposedly bigger on the inside. Dave, who communicates with Annie from the vents he added, tells her not to enter or destroy his project. When Annie shakes the exterior, she is confused by the abundance of noise and machinery she hears on the inside.\nAnnie calls Gordon, who comes to the same conclusion, and he, in turn, calls several of their friends over, including Leonard, Brynn, Greg, Jane and Harry, a filmmaker, along with his boom operator and cameraman.

As the group jump through the wall, the Minotaur kills Brynn. The group run into Dave, who leads them to safety. Dave admits that he is not sure how the maze came to be how it is, but he knows that it is growing on its own and that it might be connected to his imagination. He insists that they finish the maze so that they can escape, even though he is not sure how. Dave also reveals that his hand is now made entirely of cardboard due to sticking it into an odd vulva-shaped hole.\nAfter several other near-deaths, the group realize that they need to attack the maze at its heart, which Dave neglected to make.

James threatens Kira over public broadcast but when he fails to be killed, L confronts Light about being Kira and prepares the police to thoroughly search Light's home. Light decides to use the Death Note to force L's personal assistant Watari to travel to Montauk, New York, and find L's adoption record there; Light plans to burn the notebook page with Watari's name once he knows L's name to stop Watari's death, then kill L. Mia helps to sneak the notebook out before the search.\nLight and Mia go to the school dance, using the event to ditch L and the police. Light recovers the notebook just as Watari contacts him with L's name from the orphanage he was raised in, but Light cannot find the page in the notebook where Watari's name is written. Watari is then killed by security for trespassing before he can reveal L's name. Light discovers Mia took Watari's page, caused the agents' suicide, and has written Light's name in the book, set to kill him at midnight, but she offers to burn his page if he turns the notebook over to her. Light flees, telling Mia to meet him at the Seattle Great Wheel. Enraged at Watari's death, L leaves on a personal manhunt against Light, while James orders L to be detained. L corners Light, but a Kira Supporter, hearing that Light is Kira, knocks L out, letting Light escape. Mia meets Light at the wheel and they ride to the top. There, Mia steals the notebook, but realizes too late this was Light's plan: Light has written her death in the notebook contingent on her taking it. Ryuk then makes the wheel collapse, sending Mia falling to her death, while Light and the notebook fall into the nearby waters. L witnesses the page with Light's name land in a burning barrel.\nBefore meeting Mia, Light had used the book to coerce a criminally-charged doctor to rescue him and put him into a medically-induced coma, while having another criminal recover the Death Note and continue Kira's killings before returning the book to his bedside, killing both after their role is complete. Meanwhile, L is ordered off the case for his apparent misconduct, but in defiance, he raids Mia's home, finds the notebook page with the agents' names and deduces its capabilities. In a hysterical fit, he considers writing a name (implied to be Light's). When Light wakes from his coma at a hospital with James, who has come to conclude Light is Kira, by his side, he tries to convince James that his actions were \"the lesser of two evils\", prompting Ryuk to laugh and comment that \"humans are so interesting.\"", "tmdb_plot": "A young man comes to possess a supernatural notebook, the Death Note, that grants him the power to kill any person simply by writing down their name on the pages.

However, pianist Maria Yudina hides a note for Stalin in the record sleeve admonishing him and expressing her hope for his death. As the Central Committee members leave, NKVD head Lavrentiy Beria reveals to Nikita Khrushchev and Deputy Chairman Georgy Malenkov that Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov is to be purged. When the record arrives, Stalin finds the note; as he reads it, he laughs hysterically, but suffers a cerebral haemorrhage in the process.\nOut of fear of punishment, Stalin's guards do not enter the office despite having heard him fall; in the morning, his housekeeper is the first to discover him unconscious. The Central Committee is notified and they rush to the dacha; Beria, who has had the NKVD take over the Soviet Army-held security postings across Moscow, is the first to arrive and finds Yudina's note. After the rest of the Committee, including Lazar Kaganovich, Anastas Mikoyan, and Nikolai Bulganin, arrive, they collectively decide to send for a team of doctors despite all of the best in the Moscow area having been purged. Stalin has a bout of terminal lucidity, but he eventually dies, fulfilling Yudina's wish. The Committee returns to Moscow as the NKVD loots the dacha and Beria has the order to execute Molotov stricken.\nKhrushchev and Beria vie for the support of Stalin's children, Svetlana and her alcoholic brother, Vasily. However, Khrushchev fails to secure Molotov's allegiance as a result of Molotov's dislike of factionalism, which is compounded by Beria releasing his wife, Polina Zhemchuzhina, from prison. While the Committee names Malenkov chairman, he is essentially a puppet of Beria, who further exerts control by hijacking Khrushchev's proposed reforms, releasing political prisoners, loosening clergical restrictions, and relegating him to planning Stalin's funeral. Marshal Georgy Zhukov is irate over the supplanting of the military by the NKVD and he and Khrushchev are further incensed upon discovering that Beria has halted all transportation into Moscow. However, Beria learns that Khrushchev and Yudina, who is due to play at the funeral, are known to be acquainted, and threatens both with the release of her note to Stalin.\nZhukov and Molotov, the latter having been disillusioned by Beria's lifting of restrictions on the Church, both agree to support Khrushchev in a coup against Beria as long as the rest of the Committee is in unanimous support. Beria's authority is further undermined when Khrushchev surreptitiously has the travel ban lifted and the NKVD massacres 1,500 arriving mourners. The Committee decides to blame junior NKVD officers, but Beria angrily dissents under the belief that he will be held culpable anyway, and he threatens them with documents detailing their involvement in various purges.\nOn the day of the funeral, Khrushchev lies to Zhukov and Molotov about having secured the rest of the Committee's support, prompting the Soviet Army's reclamation of its posts and the mass arrests of NKVD personnel, including Beria, with Leonid Brezhnev's personal assistance. Malenkov hesitantly throws his lot in with the anti-Beria camp at Khrushchev's urging, and he reluctantly signs Beria's death warrant. At Beria's hasty trial, Khrushchev accuses Beria of sexual assault, pedophilia, and treason, charges that elicit disgust from the various attending officials and military officers, and sentences him to death. Beria is shot in the head, and Zhukov cremates him with a lighter and gasoline. Khrushchev sends Svetlana to Vienna despite her protests, and concurs with Kaganovich and Molotov that Malenkov is unfit to lead.\nSeveral years later, Yudina performs Concerto No. 23 again with Khrushchev, now leader of the Soviet Union in the wake of his removal of Malenkov and Molotov, in attendance.

He is married to a woman named Rani and they have two daughters, Achini and Sachini. His only interest apart from his family is watching films and he spends most of his time in front of the TV in his small office.\nDuring a nature camp, Achini gets recorded in the bathroom by a hidden cell phone which belongs to a young boy named Shane, the spoiled son of MP Vishaka Samaranayake. Shane blackmails Achini to open store room door while he come at late night, or else he would put the video on social media that would humiliate her. When Rani finds out about this and confronts Shane for it, Shane retaliates by demanding Rani sleep with him instead of Achini. Enraged by this, Achini hits on Shane's head with a pipe and broke the cell phone, killing him instantly. Horrified of what happened to Shane, Rani and Achini hide his body in a compost pit, which is witnessed by Sachini. Rani tells about the incident to Harishchandra, who devises a way to save his family from the law. He removes the broken cell phone and drives the Shane's car, which is seen by Harischandra's rival, Constable Vimal. Then, Harischandra drowns Shane's car into the river. This murder actually happened on August 2. To ensure things go smooth, Harischandra takes his family out on August 4,5 to a Meditation program which actually held on Matale August 2, watch a movie and eat at a restaurant. Upon seeing that Shane has gone missing, Vishaka starts an investigation.\nAfter Vimal revealed that Shane's car which driven by Harishchandra, had found in a river, Vishaka calls Harishchandra and family for questioning. Predicting that this would happen, Harishchandra had already taught his family how to change their alibi at the time of murder. When questioned individually, they give the same replies, surprising Vishaka. Harishchandra also presents the bill of the restaurant, the movie tickets and the bus tickets as proof of their alibi. Vishaka questions the owners of the establishments they claim they have been to, and their statements prove Harishchandra's alibi. However, after contacting Thero who held meditation program on Matale, Vishaka learns that some DVDs had released about that program. Then, She realizes that, Harishchandra had faked the evidence and established his alibi on the owners by going on a trip with his family to the same establishments later; some time after the murder, Harishchandra had met the owners again, and during the meetings, he had cleverly plotted in their minds that they had visited Matale on August 2,3.\nWith that in mind, Vishaka arrests Harishchandra with his family, and Vimal uses brute force to beat the truth out of them. Eventually, Sachini gives in after being brutally beaten by Vimal and reveals the place where the body is buried. However, Vishaka and her husband soon learned from Shane's friend, Damith that Shane took pictures of Achini on his phone, realizing that they raised a perverted teenager who tried to rape a young girl. After digging the compost pit, they only find the carcass of a calf, as Harishchandra anticipated that they would find the location by moving Shane's body elsewhere. With no evidence to prove that Harishchandra and his family have murdered Shane, Harishchandra gets Sachini to publicly speak out against Vimal for beating her, resulting several citizens to chase and beat up Vimal, who then gets suspended for battery and assault. All charges against Harishchandra and his family are dropped, and Vishaka resigns from her post, presumably out of guilt over Shane's actions.\nLater on, Vishaka and her husband apologize to Harishchandra and his family for their rude and violent behavior, holding themselves responsible for spoiling Shane in the first place and pleading to know what happened to him. A remorseful Harishchandra finally confesses that his family accidentally killed Shane because of what Shane tried to do to Achini. Harishchandra signs a register at the newly constructed local police station, where the new Inspector states that Harishchandra won't be fooling him and the police, to which Harishchandra replies that the police are only there to protect citizens like him, and that he has no intention of fooling them any further. As he leaves, a flashback shows him leaving the incomplete police station with a shovel in hand.

Tommy also insists he is from New Orleans, despite his pronounced European accent. At Tommy's suggestion, the two move to Los Angeles to pursue acting careers.\nGreg signs with talent agent Iris Burton and regularly attends auditions.

In a recovery room in Leisureland, Paul receives a call from Audrey, who says she decided to not go through with their plan and, because they are now different sizes, she is leaving him.\nOne year later, Paul signs his divorce papers. He has moved into an apartment, since he can no longer afford to live in the mansion Audrey picked, and is working as a customer service representative for Lands' End, since he let his occupational therapy license lapse because he had not expected to have to work after being shrunk, but has started dating someone. They break up, however, and Paul attends a wild party hosted by his shady but affable neighbor Du\u0161an.\nThe next morning, Paul recognizes one of Du\u0161an's house cleaners as Ngoc Lan Tran, a Vietnamese political activist who was jailed and downsized against her will, escaped in a television box, barely survived being shipped to the United States, and was brought to Leisureland a year ago to have her leg amputated. Wanting to assist Ngoc Lan with her prosthetic leg, Paul goes to her apartment in the slums just outside the walls of Leisureland where the service workers of the community live. Paul had not thought about this part of the small economy, and is shocked by conditions in the slum.\nAt her apartment, Ngoc Lan has Paul try to help her dying friend. When she finally lets him work on her prosthetic leg, he breaks it, so, until she can get a new one, he agrees to work for her cleaning service and also help her gather food from around the city to distribute throughout the slums. Du\u0161an, upon learning what Paul is doing, attempts to release Paul from his obligation by taking him to deliver supplies to the original colony for small people, but, unexpectedly, Ngoc Lan decides to tag along, as she has a standing invitation to visit Dr. Asbj\u00f8rnsen, who had heard about her ordeal.\nIn a Norwegian fjord, Dr. Asbj\u00f8rnsen and his wife board the boat piloted by Du\u0161an's friend Joris Konrad. Dr. Asbj\u00f8rnsen announces it has just been determined conclusively that, due to the positive feedback of Arctic methane emissions, the human race will soon become extinct. Paul asks if downsizing can save humanity, but Dr. Asbj\u00f8rnsen says the procedure came too late, as only three percent of the world has so far chosen to downsize. That night, Paul and Ngoc Lan make love.\nAt the colony, the travelers discover that, the next day, Dr. Asbj\u00f8rnsen is enacting a contingency plan: he and the other colonists are going to enter a large underground vault, and their descendants will emerge when the surface environment stabilizes in about eight thousand years. Du\u0161an and Joris are skeptical of the cult-like plan and say the extinction will not happen for hundreds of years, while Paul is excited to enter the vault and help with this effort to ensure the future of mankind. He asks Ngoc Lan to join him, but she refuses, saying the people in need of help will be those left above ground. As the door of the vault is closing, Paul changes his mind and steps outside.\nBack in Leisureland, Paul continues to work with Ngoc Lan to serve the people of the slums, deriving contentment from things like bringing dinner to an old man.", "tmdb_plot": "A kindly occupational therapist undergoes a new procedure to be shrunken to four inches tall so that he and his wife can help save the planet and afford a nice lifestyle at the same time.", "tmdb_id": "301337", "wiki_id": "49740268"}, {"title": "Dr. Nawariyan", "genres": ["Action", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Nirwan Senanayake, nicknamed as Nawariyan, is a thug: a crime don in the Colombo.

At this point the truth about Nirwan is revealed by the servant of Wickramasinghe's house. Wickramasinghe insults Nirwan's parents and calls them \"fools\" for being ignorant of Nirwan's real life as gang leader Nawariyan. Nirwan's father and mother, aghast and later heartbroken, leave for their village. Nirwan, in grief and despair, decides that the only way to redeem himself and gain revenge for the humiliation suffered by his father at the hands of the spiteful Wickramasinghe is to become a doctor. He decides to go to a medical college to obtain an MBBS degree.\nWith the help of his right-hand man Circuit and others, Nirwan \"gains admission\" to a medical college, where he again encounters Dr. Wickramasinghe, who is the dean of private hospital. His success there becomes dependent upon the (coerced) help of faculty member Dr. Roshan.\nWhile Nawariyan's skills as a medical doctor are minimal, he transforms those around him with the \"Magic Kiss\" (\"magical hug\") which is a method of comfort taught to Nirwan by his mother and the compassion he shows towards those in need. Despite the school's emphasis on mechanical, Cartesian, impersonal, often bureaucratic relationships between doctors and patients, Nirwan constantly seeks to impose a more empathetic, almost holistic, regimen. To this end, he defies all convention by treating a brain-dead man called \"Ananda Ayya\" as if the man were able to perceive and understand normally; interacts on familiar but autocratic terms with patients; humiliates school bullies; effusively thanks a hitherto-underappreciated janitor; and encourages the patients themselves to make changes in their lives, so that they do not need drugs or surgery.\nDr. Wickramasinghe, who perceives all this as symptoms of chaos, is unable to prevent it from expanding and gaining ground at his college. He becomes increasingly irrational and anger, almost to the point of insanity. Repeatedly, this near-dementia is shown when he receives unwelcome tidings and he begins laughing in a way that implies that he has gone mad. Wickramasinghe's laughing serves more to convey his anger than diffuse it. Meanwhile, his daughter becomes increasingly fond of Nirwan, who in his turn becomes unreservedly infatuated with her. Some comedy appears here, because Nirwan is unaware that Dr. Bhagya and his childhood friend \"Pinki\" are one and the same; an ignorance that Bhagya hilariously exploits. Wickramasinghe tries several times to expel Nirwan but is often thwarted by Nirwan's wit or the affection with which the others at the college regard Nirwan, having gained superior self-esteem by his methods. Wickramasinghe keeps a challenge that Nirwan can stay in college only if he passes the exam under his supervision. Nirwan and other mates accept it. Meanwhile, cancer patient Anushka is in a dying state seeking help from Nirwan. But unfortunately he dies in Nirwan's arms.\nEventually, Nirwan is shamed into leaving the college: His guilt for not being able to help Anushka gets the better of him. In the moments immediately following Nirwan's departure, Ananda miraculously awakens from his vegetative state; at this point Bhagya gives a heartfelt speech wherein she criticizes her father for having banished Nirwan, saying that to do so is to banish hope, compassion, love, and happiness from the college. Wickramasinghe eventually realizes his folly. Drunked Nirwan comes to home at late night and sees his parents at home. He shocks when his parents hugged him.

He desperately looks for evidence on who the spy is, but leaves after finding her in the shower. The next day, Kang Qiao receives a phone message from a mysterious phone number, cautioning him not to stalk her. He is alarmed, but is determined to help her stay safe. Kang Qiao finds out that her name is Xia Yingying, and she works at a big company.\nTo approach Xia Yingying, he becomes her client and they go out for dinner together.

Getting fed up with one another, the six remaining children divide into two teams: on one is Chiltington, Haley, and Andrew and on the other one is Kyle, Akimi, and Sierra.

He is told that \"the ride isn't over.\" As an adult, Dennis has a dream where a living demon, called \"The Cadaver\", fastens a zipper onto his back and enters his body. Also, in his dream, he finds a hidden room in the cellar that holds a full-length mirror that Dennis believes The Cadaver came from. The very next day, his brother John presents him with an identical mirror as a gift. He begins speaking to his reflection, who seems to answer back to him.\nDennis' brother John has difficulties of his own. His girlfriend, Lydia, demands that they get married but is upset that he will not do anything about Dennis. He is visited by Mildy Torres, a woman from social services, who believes that Dennis needs to be taken away after receiving an anonymous phone call where someone accused John of having trouble controlling his temper. This upsets John as he feels that Dennis is his responsibility. Dennis continues to have nightmares of The Cadaver, and his reflection informs him that in order to get rid of it, they need to start killing animals. He begins working in the secret cellar, which perplexes John, especially when he sees that Dennis has videos on taxidermy. Dennis says the videos are not his but were accidentally switched with another customer.\nOnce Dennis begins killing children, his reflection suddenly becomes a lot more articulate and reveals that \"he\" was the one giving Dennis the nightmares and that they still have more killing to do, much to Dennis' horror. Dennis meets with his crush, Susan, an employee at his favorite ice cream place. He tries to ask her out, but the conversation gets awkward, and Susan turns him down, hurting him. The Cadaver sends Dennis back to kill Susan, insisting that it is the only way to make her like him. Before he can reach her, she runs out into the street and is hit by a car, killing her. When John and Lydia take Dennis to his favorite restaurant, he spontaneously kills a man in the bathroom without hesitation, before returning to his senses and becoming horrified. Finally coming to the realization that his reflection is manipulating him for some sinister purpose, Dennis refuses to cooperate with it. Enraged by this, it continues to torment Dennis, creating illusions to frighten him as he struggles to stay awake. Eventually concluding there is no other way to stop The Cadaver, Dennis attempts to commit suicide by shooting himself with a gun he had hidden. Just as he's about to pull the trigger, Dennis is stopped by his reflection who emerges from the mirror and pushes Dennis in, allowing him to take control of Dennis' mind and body.\nAfter a night out, John and Lydia discover they do not recognize anyone at places they regularly visit, implying that Dennis has killed most of the people in town. Mildy Torres arrives at the house with two police officers, but \"Dennis\" manages to kill them before he can be apprehended. While sitting at their favorite caf\u00e9, Lydia begins to question John and finally reveals the truth: Dennis was a child prodigy whose works had been published in the newspapers. One day during an argument, John punched Dennis, causing him to fall down the stairs. When Dennis awoke, his mental capabilities were severely diminished, and John has felt guilty ever since, motivating him to try to atone by caring for Dennis at the cost of his own happiness. Lydia sympathizes with John and accepts the idea that if she and John get married, Dennis will always live with them. She leaves to get Dennis so that they can share the happy news over dinner. John's friend Pete sits nearby and reveals that the taxidermy tapes are indeed Dennis'. John instructs Pete to call the police, and he hails a taxi.\nLydia arrives at the house and is fatally stabbed by Dennis. In the cellar, Dennis proceeds to mutilate Lydia's body and extract her organs. John arrives and enters the cellar, where he finds Dennis' gun and sits in a chair with a spotlight on it. Dennis appears with a now-stuffed Lydia and puts on a ventriloquist act, and John realizes he is glued to the chair. Dennis' other victims have all been stuffed and are used in an extravagant diorama revealing that when they were children, John felt extreme jealousy for all the attention Dennis received. One night, in a moment of extreme anger and resentment, he intentionally hit Dennis in the head with a baseball bat while he slept. Afterward, John fabricated the story about Dennis falling down the stairs to cover up his violent act. As more stuffed bodies are revealed, it becomes unclear if what John is seeing is actually happening. Overwhelmed by the grotesque visions, John shoots himself. Dennis is suddenly slammed down by the Cadaver-Spider hybrid he constructed, but it's revealed that he is actually being restrained by police officers who drag him away.\nThe final scene shows Dennis in a padded room. It is revealed that The Cadaver is still in control while the real Dennis is trapped deep in his own subconscious, unable to escape. All Dennis can do now is wait to have the dream where he can finally \"get off the carnival ride\".", "tmdb_plot": "The sadistic tale of a lonely, mentally handicapped boy who befriends his reflection in an antique mirror.

Samuel feels that something is amiss and he tells Ranjan that the box from the antique shop is a Dybbuk box, with the name \u201cAbraham Ezra\u201d written on it in Hebrew. At his behest, Ranjan finds more about the Dybbuk from a Rabbi David Benyamin (Babu Antony) in Mumbai. He tells Ranjan that the Dybbuk only possesses people with mental instability or children under 3 years, and whoever exorcises the Dybbuk becomes its worst enemy. The next day, Rabbi Benyamin dies and Ranjan learns that Priya is pregnant and realizes his child will be possessed by the dybbuk.

The film moves to the historical era, where a rich Jewish boy Abraham Ezra (Sudev Nair) and a poor Christian girl Rosy (Ann Sheetal)  fall in love during Ezra's visits to Thiru Kochi, and eventually Rosy becomes pregnant. Rosy is not able to tell Ezra that she is pregnant. Ezra's father Yakoob Ezra refuses to let him marry Rosy, since she is not a Jew, and that marrying a woman of a lower social status is unacceptable. Rosy does not reveal to her father nor Yakoob that Ezra is her unborn child's father. Months later, a depressed Ezra writes to Rosy telling her to end the relationship and Rosy commits suicide in heartbreak. Rosy's father finds Ezra's letter and he with the villagers confronts the father-son duo when they arrive in Thiru Kochi. In the ensuing scrimmage, Rosy's father is killed and Ezra is left paralysed. When the doctors said that Ezra will be in this state for the rest of his life, Yakoob decides to take revenge on the town using black magic. He euthanises and puts his son's soul into a Dybbuk box, which on opening will release Ezra's spirit that will possess and destroy. A wooden dummy is buried in place of Ezra's body. Yakoob takes the corpse and dumps it in the sea. Thus is created the Dybbuk box which eventually finds its way to Ranjan.\nThe story comes back to Ranjan.

Fr. Samuel tells them that Ranjan, as an orphan, had mental problems. Hence he was probably vulnerable to the Dybbuk. It is understood that the spirit left Priya and possessed Ranjan when it noted that Ranjan handles nuclear waste and he could be controlled into using that to destroy the city.

The evidence seems irrefutable: The murder weapon is in his house, his fingerprints and DNA are in her apartment and the apartment's security camera has footage of him. Following pressure from the media, the court swiftly finds him guilty and sentences him to life imprisonment in a maximum security prison. In prison, Kwon catches the attention of gang leader Ma Duk-su, and Kwon is beaten on his first days. His mother visits him, assures him she is fighting for his freedom and encourages him to endure. Helped by a sympathetic inmate, Kwon retrains himself and fights back, eventually beating Ma.\nAfter receiving news that his mother has committed suicide, Kwon breaks out of prison, triggering a national manhunt. He goes to the office of Min Chum-sang, the public attorney who defended him. Min gives Kwon Yoo his mother's necklace, saying he will re-examine his case.

Giacometti lives with his wife Annette and also with his brother Diego at his studio which he also uses as a home. Giacometti also has a favorite muse whom he uses as a model and part time concubine who is the source of some tension in his home.\nWhen the two days pass, Giacometti requests that the sittings with Lord continue for another week. Lord is busy and needs to return to his work back home, though the chance to have his portrait done by Giacometti entices him to stay. He delays his departure accordingly and puts off his writing assignments. Giacometti's progress on the portrait appears to move in starts and stops. Often he is in the habit of simply blanking out the face to start over again. Lord keeps making photos of the progress, but the progress often is stifled when Giacometti completely rethinks his approach and restarts the portrait from scratch.\nGiacometti's relationship with his wife oscillates between genuinely caring for her while requiring that he also have the freedoms implied by having an open marriage. Annette is clearly disturbed by these vacillations in his affections and considers him to be niggardly in the affection which he shows her over the years. At one point she confronts him about being extravagant with his money when it comes to his models and courtesans, while at the same time being stingy about even buying her a coat. Annette reminds him that he has money now that he is a successful artist and insists on getting some attention. Giacometti goes into a rage and reminds her that he does have money and begins casually flinging stacks of bills at her for her new coat. The effect is counterproductive and his wife is still displeased with his keeping courtesans around his studio and in his home.\nThe progress on the portrait continues very slowly as one week passes into a second week and a third week. Giacometti decides that he will now purchase a convertible for his model courtesan as she has become his primary muse for his artistry. He and Lord and the courtesan go out for a night on the town once her convertible arrives and when they get home, Giacometti finds that his studio has been ransacked. He appears to know what has happened and tells Lord that he must go to sort this out the next day.\nIn the morning, Giacometti takes Lord with him to visit a local bar where he is to meet up with the male manager who is minding the affairs of Giacometti's favorite courtesan. Giacometti gladly pays him the \"fees\" which he requires for the services of the courtesan, and he pays for her services in advance. Both Giacometti and the manager are pleased with the arrangement and apparently Giacometti and his premises are to be left intact without further disruption in the coming months ahead. Lord is becoming concerned for the long delays with the portrait and tries to recruit Giacometti's brother to assist him in getting his brother to work a little faster, though his brother completely refuses to do anything like this knowing his brother's prickly temperament.

Shortly after hearing of Danny being bullied at school, Will decides to take his family to his hometown, Granville, Ohio to bond with Danny. Upon entering Granville, Will is reacquainted with Police Chief Marvin Howell (Bruce Willis), a family friend who knew Will's father and at one point dated his aunt, Dottie (Deb G. Girdler). Howell advises Will on taking precaution after informing him of a recent bank robbery where a couple of million dollars was stolen. While teaching Danny how to hunt with a rifle, Will and Danny witness a heated exchange between two men, one of them holding the other at gunpoint, inquiring after money drop-off not going according to plan. The unarmed man (Gethin Anthony) is shot in the shoulder after throwing a key near Will's position at a shooting station; Danny's shocked gasp at the shooting attracts the gunman's attention. The gunman opens fire on Will's location, prompting Will, fearing for his son's safety, to shoot him with his hunting rifle in self-defense. Upon inspecting the dead gunman, he's surprised to discover a concealed badge and that the gunman was a police officer who failed to identify himself. Distraught, Will brings the wounded man to the family cabin for Laura, a surgeon, to provide first aid and hopefully save the only other witness to the proceedings.\nShortly after being treated and bandaged up, on regaining consciousness, the man takes Danny hostage at knife-point, demanding that Will help him retrieve the discarded key in exchange for Danny's freedom. While attempting to retrieve the key back at the shooting shack, they're surprised by a uniformed officer, Richie Stechel (William DeMeo), who opens fire on Will and the gunman. The gunman tells Will to meet him at a bulletin board after retrieving the key, then absconds with Will's car and son as hostage. After a failed attempt at pursuing his son, Will learns from Howell that the gunman's name is Levi Barrett, and that the deceased officer was Richie's brother, Charlie (Shea Buckner). Will waits until nightfall to retrieve the key, only to be confronted by Richie. Will successfully subdues Richie, leaving him handcuffed to a tree, then heads to the bulletin board for further instructions. Meanwhile, Danny bonds with Levi and learns the reasons behind the bank robbery. Howell and the Stechel brothers engineered the heist and intended to use Levi as the fall guy. Levi agreed to the heist in order to financially support Mabel Fantion (Christine Dye), his girlfriend Adele's (Magi Avila) cancer-ridden mother. Levi was supposed to drop off the stolen money at a drop-site, but suspecting the cops would likely betray him, did not arrive due to fear of the site being compromised with a potential assassin. Howell also deduces Levi's predicament after a uniformed officer investigates Barrett's apartment.\nHowell and Will converge on Mabel's hospital bed, with Howell questioning Will's motivation for being there. While Howell is distracted with a radio call by an officer, Will receives a map from Mabel revealing the location of the post office where the stolen money was stashed and the location of an underground bunker at which to make the exchange for his son. The key is used to unlock the mailbox containing the stolen cash. Will briefly eludes Howell but is caught again after retrieving the money. Seemingly sympathetic to Will's situation, Howell provides Will transport to the bunker in order to apprehend Levi. Will gives the money to Levi and is reunited with Danny. Simultaneous to this reunion, Richie kidnaps Laura from the family cabin and drives her to Howell's location for leverage of their own.\nWhile attempting to flee, Adele is murdered by Howell. Left with nothing to lose, Levi attacks Howell and Richie only to be wounded.

Howell holds Laura at gunpoint, threatening to shoot her if Will doesn't hand over the money. Desperate to help his parents, Danny retrieves a pistol from the unconscious Richie and attempts to shoot Howell, only for Will to stop him. In an attempt to taunt Will, Howell reveals himself as the person that murdered Will's father years earlier. Levi distracts Howell while Laura ducks, providing Will the opportunity to shoot Howell in the head.\nDuring the aftermath, Levi dies of his injuries, much to Danny's sadness. Richie is questioned by the rest of the police department, and Mabel is found dead on the hospital bed, having been murdered by Howell by removing her life support system.

One day, while painting, he notices a strange man hanging around a group of children and ejects him from the property.\nScooty finds a lighter in a box that Dicky's family left behind when they moved away, and he, Moonee, and Jancey accidentally start a fire at an abandoned condominium complex. Ashley gets the truth out of him, after which she forbids him from hanging out with Moonee or Jancey and stops talking to Halley. When Halley learns this, she goes to the diner where Ashley works and makes a scene. Moonee and Jancey continue to play together and become best friends.\nWithout the free food from Ashley, and with security guards beginning to bother her at the hotels, Halley's financial situation declines even further. When she and Moonee move out of Magic Castle for the mandated 24 hours that month, they discover new owners at the motel they usually go to have raised the rates, so they instead spend the night with Stacey. Aware of this, Bobby is suspicious when Halley finally pays for her room, and it turns out she has begun to solicit sex work online, keeping Moonee in the bathroom with loud music when she has a client. She steals a client's Disney World resort passes to scalp them, and the man returns to demand them back. Bobby scares him off, but says Halley's guests now have to check in at the front desk. Desperate, she apologizes to Ashley for whatever Moonee did and asks for help with rent, but Ashley says Halley should have plenty of money, since she is prostituting herself. In front of Scooty, Halley punches Ashley in the face repeatedly and storms off.\nInvestigators from the DCF show up and question Halley and Moonee separately about their lifestyle. Halley has Moonee help clean their room and gives away her weed in anticipation of another visit. They go to a fancy hotel and have an extravagant meal, which Halley charges to a guest's room, and when they return to Magic Castle, the investigators, having found evidence Halley is doing sex work, are waiting with two police officers to take Moonee into foster care while they finish their inquiry. Not really understanding what is happening, Moonee asks to say goodbye to Scooty, who lets slip that she is going to a new family. She becomes agitated and runs away to bid Jancey goodbye, and Jancey, seeing her friend's distress, grabs Moonee's hand and escapes with her to Magic Kingdom.", "tmdb_plot": "The story of a precocious six year-old and her ragtag group of friends whose summer break is filled with childhood wonder, possibility and a sense of adventure while the adults around them struggle with hard times.", "tmdb_id": "394117", "wiki_id": "53834253"}, {"title": "Flower", "genres": ["Comedy", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Seventeen-year-old Erica Vandross gives a police officer oral in his patrol car, after which two of her friends sneak up and record them.

When his teenage daughter Fan is killed in a terrorist bombing, Quan seeks revenge. The British police discover an IRA codeword was used in the bombing and an Irish republican group calling itself the \"Authentic IRA\" claims responsibility. Quan takes to visiting Scotland Yard daily, asking for names of the bombers, but is told by Commander Bromley that his visits are diverting resources away from the investigation. Bromley advises Quan to be patient and warns him against going after the IRA. Undeterred, Quan takes matters into his own hands and turns his attention to the Northern Ireland deputy First Minister and Sinn F\u00e9in politician Liam Hennessy, a former Provisional IRA leader who has since claimed to have renounced violence. Quan purchases items to make homemade weapons and travels to Belfast, leaving the restaurant under Lam's control.\nQuan seeks out Hennessy at his office but Hennessy claims to have no knowledge of the perpetrators before ejecting him from the premises. Quan does not believe him, and sets off a homemade bomb in Hennessy's building before leaving a fake explosive on Hennessy's car as warnings. Hennessy tells his men to find Quan and stop him. Under pressure from the British government and hoping to shore up his position ahead of Northern Irish Assembly elections, Hennessy tries to identify the culprits with help from his former IRA comrades. He orders that known IRA weapons dumps be searched for missing Semtex. Hennessy's bodyguards, led by his right-hand-man, Jim Kavanagh, find Quan at his guesthouse but he fights them off and escapes. Quan later observes Hennessy with his mistress Maggie and photographs them kissing in a restaurant.\nQuan then brings the fight to Hennessy, hiding in the trees outside his farmhouse and attacking it with more explosives. As Hennessy's henchmen attempt to track him, Quan disables them with traps and attempts to interrogate one, but is shot in the shoulder by Kavanagh and flees. Tending to his wounds, Quan recalls his escape from Vietnam in which his first two daughters were kidnapped, raped, and killed by Thai pirates. Hennessy also investigates Quan's background and discovers he was a former guerrilla fighter who was recruited by the CIA in Vietnam. After Quan ambushes Hennessy in his house, Hennessy contacts his nephew Sean Morrison, a former Royal Irish Regiment soldier, from New York City in the hope that Morrison's tracking skills can be used to stop Quan. Hennessey first sends Sean to London to negotiate with Bromley and strike a deal in which Hennessy will tell each IRA cell to change their codewords, thus allowing the two of them to pinpoint the bombers after their next attack. Bromley agrees, on the condition that the police will take them down, not him and his uncle.\nHugh McGrath, one of Hennessy's old IRA commanders during The Troubles, arrives and asks Hennessy why his weapon dumps are being searched. Hennessy tells Hugh that the semtex used in the bombing came from one of his dumps. McGrath denies knowing anything and claims that everything was in order. McGrath then tells Hennessy that he believes the attacks should continue and tries to persuade Hennessy to think the same. Hennessy reveals that he secretly ordered the bombings, but ordered that only financial institutions should be targeted and that civilians should be spared. Angry, McGrath accuses Hennessy of caring more about his position within the British government than the IRA's cause. McGrath then leaves, but not before Hennessy threatens him saying if the bombers are not caught, he will go after McGrath next.\nA second bombing occurs on a double-decker bus and no codeword is given, prompting distrust between Bromley and Hennessy. British cabinet minister Katherine Davies tells Hennessy that Royal pardons for several of his IRA ex-comrades (which he previously sought) will be considered only if he immediately hands over the bombers. If he fails to, British soldiers will re-occupy the streets of Northern Ireland within two days. Hennessy soon learns from one of his men that Sean unintentionally leaked information to Mary whilst having an adulterous dalliance with her. Meanwhile, Bromley finds out that Hugh McGrath is the ringleader of the Authentic IRA and notifies Hennessy of the discovery. Hennessy tortures McGrath (by shooting him in both knees) into giving him the identities of the bombers with Maggie among them, whose real name is Sara Mackay. The affair was planned to tie Liam to the bombers in case he chose not to support further violence. Hennessy also discovers that the true mastermind of the attacks is his own wife, Mary. She bitterly resents the British due to her brother Patrick dying at the hands of the Ulster Volunteer Force and hates her husband for allowing his killers to be imprisoned instead of ordering their murders. In retaliation for his betrayal and for involving his wife and mistress, Hennessy executes McGrath with a bullet to the head. He then phones Morrison and shares the info, anticipating that his nephew might not succeed in defeating Quan.\nSean finds Quan's hiding place in the forest. After a knife fight, Quan captures Sean, who names the terrorists and their location in London before Quan lets him go. When Sean returns to the farmhouse, Hennessy admonishes his nephew for his actions. He tells him to bury McGrath in the pig pen, informs Morrison of last task that he has for him, and that upon its completion Morrison must return to New York.\nAs the police and MI5 prepare to raid the bombers' London hideout, Quan enters the flat disguised as a handyman and kills everyone but Maggie, leaving her severely wounded. Quan leaves just before the police storm the apartment. They then torture Maggie into disclosing the location of their next bomb, which has been planted in a laptop belonging to a reporter whom Maggie seduced, and is to be detonated on a plane carrying British dignitaries to a conference in Rome. With only seconds to spare, British police throw the laptop into an empty jet bridge, where it detonates without casualties. With the threat resolved, Maggie is executed to prevent any \"loose ends.\" Hennessy gets a call from Davies, who was scheduled to be on the targeted flight. She tells him that she has learned of his involvement with the bombers, but having helped prevent the last attack he can retain his position as deputy First Minister, albeit under her control. Davies also informs Hennessy that pardons for five IRA fugitives, including his cousin, have been issued and that he must fly back to London the next day for a debriefing. Sean visits Mary and shoots her dead with a silenced pistol, eliminating the entire Authentic IRA cell and removing all links to Hennessy.\nHennessy goes to his hotel and is confronted by Quan with the picture of him kissing Maggie on his phone.

Jin starts noticing discrepancies in his family's personality. He then realizes that they are not his family at all, but people pretending to be his family. He escapes the house and goes to the police. When he tells them he is 21 years old, the skeptical officer asks him what year it is. He replies that it's 1997; the officer reveals that it is actually 2017. Jin is, in fact, 41 years old.\nA shocked Jin looks around and sees signs of modern life: a tablet, a smartphone; an LED flat-screen TV showing the current South Korean President Moon Jae-in and United States President Donald Trump. He leaves confused, but is captured by the same \"family\" that was holding him captive. The young man pretending to be his brother, \"Yoo-seok,\" tells Jin that twenty years ago, a teenage girl and her mother were murdered. The case went cold, so the family of the victims hired \"Yoo-seok\" to find the murderer which is Jin. In flashbacks, it is shown that Jin was abducted and tortured to confess, but maintained his innocence. A psychiatrist suggested that he had repressed his memory because the event was too traumatic. The team has the psychiatrist hypnotize him back to his last happy memory in 1997, figuring that if they could re-enact the events of the murder, Jin might be able to recover his memories and tell them what happened. Everything was going as planned, until the night when Jin saw Yoo-seok being kidnapped. He was actually being arrested for fraud, and was gone for 19 days because they needed to wait until the next rainy night to properly re-enact the night of the murder.

He goes online seeking a job, and is messaged by an anonymous person, telling Jin he will pay him to kill someone's wife, but he must leave the two children unharmed. Arriving at the house, Jin's conscience doesn't allow him to go through with it. He is about to leave when the mother sees him, then the daughter, who starts screaming, and Jin ends up killing them both. The youngest child, a little boy, comes out, and Jin tells him to go back to bed. As he leaves, he discovers that this is actually the family of his brother's doctor.\nJin meets with the anonymous man, who is indeed Yoo-seok's doctor, demanding to know why the man would have his own family killed. The doctor explains that the financial crisis had bankrupted him; he had taken out multiple insurance policies on his wife to prevent his children from becoming homeless. Since Jin not only killed his wife but also his daughter, the doctor says Yoo-seok will die as well. A struggle ensues and the doctor is accidentally pushed to his death.\nIn the present, Jin wakes up in a hospital. The young man who had pulled Jin into the van survived the crash, and was now about to poison him to death, but Jin informs him that his memory has returned. The young man reveals that he was the little boy in the house twenty years ago, whom Jin spared after killing his mother and sister. After the deaths of his parents and sister, his relatives took all the money and left him to grow up in an orphanage. He begs Jin to tell him why he hadn't killed him too, and whether the murders were planned by his father.

The Indian Navy and RAW decipher a secret code sent from Pakistan to East Pakistan (modern-day Bangladesh), relating to a possible attack on an Indian naval vessel. The Navy deduces that the target may be INS Vikrant, India's sole aircraft carrier. The top command dispatches the submarine S21, under the command of Captain Ranvijay Singh for recce missions. To temper Singh's belligerent tendencies, the Indian Navy Admiral assigns Lt. Cmdr Arjun Varma to S21, with orders to ensure that Singh does not confront any Pakistani warships and trigger a war.\nThe Navy's top command soon learns that the Pakistan Navy has dispatched PNS Ghazi, under Cmdr. Razak Khan, to the Bay of Bengal to confront  Vikrant. Meanwhile, to divert the attention of the enemy, Ghazi torpedoes an Indian merchant ship. The attack is picked by S21, which races to the scene. Noticing survivors in the wreckage, Arjun jumps into the sea and manages to rescue a girl child and a woman, both of whom are Bengali refugees. During surveillance, S21 acquires a sonar signal of Ghazi.\nSingh believes that they should track down Ghazi and attack, while Arjun obstructs, reiterating his instructions. Singh then orders the ship's EXO, Lt. Commander Santosh Devraj to conduct a drill and target Ghazi while doing so, despite Arjun's protests. They fire a torpedo, which misses Ghazi narrowly, thus alerting them of their presence. Aware of the enemy's presence, Razak orders his crew to head towards Visakhapatnam Port at full speed and to set up mines en-route, planning to destroy S21.\nS21 pursues Ghazi's path and realizes at the last moment that it is headed into mines. Singh and Arjun frantically attempt to change its course but a mine explodes in the stern and damages most of the sub's batteries, propellers and circuits. The sub blows open many leaks, with the forward torpedo compartment flooded, crippling the sub and barring it from firing its forward torpedoes. Singh dies while trying to save Arjun, as S21 sinks to the sea-bed.\nArjun, now in command of the sub, regroups and work towards reviving S21. They manage to clog the sub's leaks and pumps the excess water out, before holding a final farewell for Singh. The crew noticed that the vessel is incapable of moving in any direction, except upwards or downwards. Since they are unable to chase Ghazi, the crew artificially trigger one of the naval mines in its vicinity to lure Ghazi to their position. Razak, believing S21 is still operational, orders his crew to turn around to sink S21.\nArjun and Devraj plan to lure Ghazi within its range of firing, but a suspicious Razak orders Ghazi's course to be changed at the last minute.\nGhazi, now having the ability to attack S21, fires six torpedoes, all of which are avoided by S21 through depth changing maneuvers, much to Razak's frustration. S21 dives to 350 m, in order to slip from  Ghazi's sonar range despite being designed for a maximum of 250 m depth. With very limited battery support, Arjun instigates Ghazi into attacking by transmitting his crew singing 'Saare Jahaan se Achchha' and the Indian National Anthem. Riled up by S21's defiance, Razak orders another torpedo attack on S21, for which Ghazi will have to turn by port 180 degrees. Arjun dives into the flooded forward compartment to manually trigger the torpedoes, successfully managing to do so. Ghazi also launches its torpedo at the same time. The torpedo launched by Ghazi misses S21 narrowly, but it is hit by S21's torpedo and disintegrates in the water, killing the entire crew. S21 surfaces and the crew manages to save Arjun from the flooded compartment in the nick of time. S21 is later saved by a patrolling Indian Navy vessel.\nThe ending titles narrate the mysterious circumstances about Ghazi's fate, with its sinking credited to the actions of INS Rajput.

Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet, Hanka Robotics CEO, Cutter, decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative.\nA year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the counter-terrorism bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. Killian, who experiences hallucinations that Ouelet dismisses as glitches, is troubled as she doesn't clearly remember her past.

Cutter has decided that Killian is a liability and orders Ouelet to kill her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated. Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter Motoko Kusanagi ran away from home a year ago and was arrested; while in custody, Motoko took her own life. Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who allows Cutter to remotely eavesdrop on their conversation. \nBatou, Togusa and Aramaki eliminate Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen.

Her parents sent her to the city to have an abortion, but they severed ties with her after she refused to go through with it.\nAna is ordered by her doctors not to consume meat. One night, Clara finds her rifling through the fridge. When Clara tries to guide her to bed, Ana kisses her but then scratches her hard enough to draw blood. The following morning, Ana does not appear to remember the incident.\nClara realizes that the incident might be connected to the full moon. The following full moon, Ana passionately kisses Clara and the two have sex. Later that night, Ana sleepwalks again. Clara witnesses her murdering and eating a cat. The following day, Clara tells Ana about her sleepwalking. She also puts some of her blood into Ana's meal to relieve her thirst for blood and sleepwalking.\nOn the following full moon night, Ana's cramping worsens. Before Clara can call for help, Ana's stomach ruptures. Ana is killed, but her baby, a werewolf pup, survives. Clara decides to run away and abandon the baby, but changes her mind on the last part upon hearing the child's cries and decides to raise it herself, naming him Joel.\nSeven years later, Clara works as a nurse and is raising Joel as her own. She has raised him as a vegetarian and chains him up in what is known as \"the Little Bedroom\" during full moons to protect him. After Clara's landlady Dona Am\u00e9lia gives Joel meat one day, he searches through Clara's things, where he uncovers a photo of Ana, becoming hostile with Clara. The next morning (as Joel began to transform while arguing with her) Clara reluctantly admits that Ana is his birth mother, but insists that she does not know who his father is.\nJoel decides to search for his father, the only clue being a receipt from a shopping mall where Ana bought shoes. He and his friend Maur\u00edcio go to the mall, but they are locked in when they decide to stay inside past closing time. Joel transforms as it is still a full moon, and soon after he pursues Maur\u00edcio and eats him whole. He returns home alone before he unconsciously transforms back but is seen by Dona Am\u00e9lia, who discovers his secret and wants to perform an exorcism on him (as Joel's traits are affected by his transformation). Clara injects the landlady with an anasthetic and then plans to run away with Joel the next day, but because he does not fully remember what he did in his wolf form he locks her in the Little Bedroom in a fit of confusion and anger. Joel tries to attend a dance with his classmate Amanda later that night but quickly realizes what he really is, and begs her to leave before he once again turns. Clara, who has managed to escape, shoots him in the leg before he can kill again, non-fatally injuring him.\nClara takes Joel home to the Little Bedroom and removes the bullet, healing the wound. Meanwhile, a terrified Amanda tells the locals what happened, leading them to hunt Joel down, tracking down his and Clara's apartment (though it is implied Amanda does not want them to do so) as Dona Am\u00e9lia wakes up and watches with implicit regret. With a lullaby Ana sang earlier in the film, Clara manages to tame Joel so that he does not attack her. She finally decides that she cannot keep him locked up and hungry.

The three deal with hardships on a daily basis; Eli and Daniel face racism from African Americans and Hispanics, and Kamilla has a troubled family life after the death of her mother some years earlier. Kamilla is also constantly badgered by Mr. Kim (Sang Chon), who owns a liquor store near Eli and Daniel's shoe store; this leads to Eli often intervening on Kamilla's behalf, straining the relationship between Mr. Kim and Eli. Mr. Kim speaks to Eli in Korean and Eli replies primarily in English, and occasionally in Korean. On April 29, 1992, the news of the day is focused on the pending Rodney King assault verdict.

Shortly thereafter Mr. Kim returns with Daniel; Daniel and Eli argue briefly before Eli begins to argue with Mr. Kim before Mr. Kim provides a cigarette as a peace offering. Kim then talks to Eli about when he and Eli's father started the shoe store, and how his father and Kamilla's mother died during a robbery at the store, and how their lives weren't what they wanted to give their kids. Eli and Daniel argue over whether to remove the shoes from the premises or to surrender the shoes to Keith and lose the store, which is already two months behind on rent.

When Charity attends finishing school, she and Barnum write to each other until reuniting as adults. They eventually marry and raise two daughters Caroline and Helen in New York City. They live a humble life and though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more.\nBarnum loses his shipping clerk job when the company goes bankrupt, due to a typhoon that sank all the firm's cargo vessels. He later secures a bank loan, deceptively using his former employer's lost ships as \"collateral\". He opens Barnum's American Museum in downtown Manhattan which features various wax figures. Ticket sales are slow, so Caroline and Helen suggest showcasing something \"alive\". Barnum adds \"freak\" performers, such as bearded lady Lettie Lutz and dwarf man Charles Stratton. This garners higher attendance, but also protests and poor reviews from well-known critic James Gordon Bennett.\nBarnum renames his venture, \"Barnum's Circus\" and recruits playwright Phillip Carlyle to help generate publicity. Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist, Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet Queen Victoria. Barnum persuades famed Swedish singer Jenny Lind to tour America, with him as her manager. Lind's American debut is a success. During her song, Phillip's parents see him and Anne holding hands.

Phillip awakens in a hospital with Anne by his side, while Barnum and Charity reconcile.\nA recovering Phillip offers his share of the profits to help Barnum rebuild the circus in exchange for becoming a full partner, which Barnum readily accepts.

The team includes representatives of the different nationalities of the Soviet Union. Arseniy, codenamed Arsus, can change into a huge, incredibly strong bear-man. Temirkhan, codenamed Khan, has super speed and wields a pair of curved swords. Lernik, codenamed Ler, has the ability to control earth and stone. Finally, Xenia can become invisible underwater.\nThe program succeeds where a second program called Module-1 fails. This prompts Professor Avgust Kuratov, creator of Module-1, to flee to the remote wilderness, away from Soviet authorities, to continue working on his experiments. When the military is summoned to arrest him, he bombs the Patriot laboratory, surviving because he was covered with some chemicals. He rebuilds his damaged body, making himself into a cyborg. This gives him the power to generate electricity and control machines. He also created an army of clones of himself and sets out to prove to the world that he is a genius. After the explosion, Arsus, Ler, Khan, and Xenia go into hiding for years.\nIn the present day, several walking robots used in a training exercise turn against their supervising officials and kill them. This leads to the Ministry of Defence holding a meeting and deciding to revive the Patriot organization under the leadership of Major Elena Larina and to locate their missing super agents. She finds Ler spending his time meditating in Armenia; Khan living on the steppes of Kazakhstan; Arsus in a remote cabin in northern Siberia; and Xenia performing stunts in a circus in Moscow. Their first task is to raid Kuratov's laboratory within an old factory, but they are captured.\nKuratov offers the Guardians a chance to join him but they refuse. This angers him and he keeps three of them trapped within a magnetic force field and injures Ler. He later goes to a military facility at Noginsk to take control of the tanks and other vehicles stationed there. Using them, he launches an invasion of Moscow and makes preparations to use the Ostankino Tower and the Federation Tower for his Module-2 Project. He intends to transmit a signal through an old Soviet satellite, which will then be sent to every other satellite orbiting Earth, and use it to seize control of all technology in the world. He uses a force field to protect his beacon tower and destroy several jet fighters that are sent to stop him. When a collaborator within the Russian military, Major-General Nikolai Dolgov, asks Kuratov for a reward for his help, Kuratov strangles him to death.\nMajor Elena frees the other team members from Kuratov's laboratory. She sends Kuratov's former rival to study one of Kuratov's clones. Unfortunately, the real Kuratov releases poison gas to kill him. Arsus and the other Guardians are trained in the Patriots' facility and are given suits and weapons.\nThe Guardians go to Moscow: Xenia and Arsus advance through the streets, Ler defeats several soldiers patrolling an underground car park, and Khan uses an airplane to try to fly above Kuratov's force field. The three Guardians enter a shopping mall, and begin crossing an iron bar linking it to the tower-beacon, but are shot at by more of Kuratov's troops on another pipe. Khan jumps from the airplane swinging on a grapple line to slice the pipe, causing Kuratov's troops to fall.\nWhile the other Guardians try to figure out a way to destroy the power source for Kuratov's beacon, Xenia grabs the power source to short circuit it. She is injured but manages to temporarily disable the beacon's transmissions, causing the force field to collapse. The Guardians battle Kuratov again on top of the tower but fail to defeat him. Khan uses his super-speed to tie all of the Guardians to a grappling rope and attach it to an airplane to escape. Kuratov interferes with the plane's controls, but Khan cuts the grappling rope, and they fall into a river before the plane crashes.\nAs they emerge from the river, they consider going back to Kuratov's beacon to destroy it and kill Kuratov, but Major Elena arrives and commands them not to.

To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect some of the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power.

After shouting at the cast and director at a poorly performed play leads to him being thrown out and fired from his position as a critic, Ted runs into his god daughter Jane, who lavishly pays him to investigate a series of miracles occurring at her family's manor in light of her unexplained apparent recovery from leukaemia.\nAt the manor, owned by his former friend Michael, Lord Logan, Ted becomes acquainted with his sixteen-year-old godson, David, who displays an unusual fascination with sex and nature. Also at the manor is David's brother Simon, Michael's angina-afflicted friend Oliver, who hopes to obtain funding for his new play and Valerie Richmond, a wealthy Frenchwoman who seeks to purchase one of the manor's horses, Lilac, for her socially awkward daughter Clara, who is accompanying her. For the next few days, Ted becomes acquainted with the manor's residents, encountering conflict between his abrasive attitude and the others' perky optimism, while David converses with Ted about both his interests and his ambitions of becoming a fellow poet.\nOne day, Lilac mysteriously falls ill of what appears to be ragwort poisoning, something which strikes Michael and Simon as odd as ragwort doesn't grow in the area. While Michael and company despair over the possibility of having to euthanise Lilac, Ted learns from various members of his god-family that the miracles he was sent to investigate were performed by David. According to this account, David had healed his mother from a severe asthma attack simply by touching her, when Simon's CPR seemed ineffective and cured Jane's leukaemia over the course of a few days through the same method. The following day, David appears to perform more miracles by curing Lilac's ragwort poisoning and Oliver's angina, leading Valerie to pursue him in hopes of improving Clara's appearance.\nDavid has gone missing, leading to a search across the manor's grounds. Ted eventually sights David and Clara running into the woods afterwards and gives chase, only to find Clara performing fellatio on David. A bewildered Ted simply chooses to observe them as an ejaculating David tries to coerce Clara into swallowing his semen; Simon then discovers the pair and interrupts them, causing a panicked Clara to bite David's penis. After Simon takes Clara back to the manor, Ted comes out of hiding and drives a bleeding David to the hospital. On the way back, David explains to Ted that he believes his healing powers come from his moral purity and a spiritual connection with nature, channelled though his hands and especially his bodily fluids; Ted rubbishes this as blind delusion, leading a heartbroken David to abandon him.\nOnce Ted returns to the manor, he is confronted by Michael's sister Rebecca, who bears a grudge against Ted for him publicly humiliating her on live television many years ago; Rebecca insults Ted and rebukes him for his interference in Michael's family's life, leaving Ted to sulk alone in his room for the rest of the night. He comes to an unexpected realisation when he accidentally knocks over and smashes his whisky bottle.\nThe following evening, the manor's residents agree publicly to announce David's miraculous healing abilities, only for Ted to rebut them as mere coincidence. Ted explains that the breaking of his whisky bottle led him to realise that Lilac's poisoning was actually a hangover from drinking the contents of a bottle he dropped in an outdoor bucket earlier in the film, that Simon's CPR had rescued his mother during her asthma attack and that Jane's recovery from leukaemia was a remission of its symptoms. Ted further reveals David's confidence in his semen's abilities and that this led him to have morally dubious sex with Jane, Lilac and Oliver.

That evening the women back at camp ask her why she is unhappy and in response she says that she wishes she had opted to become a goat.

After some time, while Chotta asks for a lift from Madhu, but he mistakenly hits Chotta and injures him. Madhu admits Chotta in a hospital and escapes from there as he did not have enough money to pay the bill. Chotta also manages to escape the hospital and reach his hideout place, a flat in an apartment building, owned by one of his associates, a lady who works as a manager, thus causing no doubts to anyone.\nMeanwhile, the doctor who treated Chotta in the hospital learns from the news that Chotta is a wanted terrorist and informs the police. The police collect the CCTV footage from the hospital and the highway, which contained Madhu and Kulandai providing lifts to Chotta. Hence, they corner and arrest both of them. While being taken to custody, they are hit by a jeep and are injured, causing Kulandai to forget his past. Madhu thinks that Kulandai must be a real associate of Chotta, and if he can make Kulandai tell the police that Madhu is not involved in this case, then he can escape. However, he is shocked to see Kulandai having forgotten his past. The case is handled by Dheena, who now gets a good chance to reject Madhu, as he doubts that he is a terrorist. Dheena plans to kill both of them in an encounter, but Madhu and Kulandai manage to escape. With help from Bhargavi, they all hide in her friend's flat, which happens to be just below the flat in which Chotta is hiding, in the same apartment. Chotta plans his attack in two days and sends the bombs to his associates. He tells them that he will mention the locations one hour prior, using the draft communication.\nMadhu and Bhargavi take Kulandai to Dr. Thillai and try to regain his memory using hypnotherapy. Thillai successfully makes him regain his memory, and he reveals that he too is innocent like Madhu. Madhu urges him to recall anything, while Kulandai gave a lift to Chotta. Kulandai tells them that Chotta made a phone call from the petrol bunk's public phone, and using lip reading, he manages to get the Gmail username of Chotta and his associates. However, he could not get the password, as Chotta was turned the other side while saying that on the phone. With help from his friend in the telecom industry, Madhu gets the number to which Chotta made the call and tracks down the number to the same apartment in which they are currently staying at. He identifies Chotta and manages to grab him, but Chotta overpowers him and escapes. Madhu chases Chotta, but Chotta gets away with his female associate escapes in a car. Madhu throws his phone and manages to record a conversation between Chotta and his female associate. Chotta also delivers instructions to the bombers about the locations to be targeted via a draft from his Gmail account.\nMadhu manages to get Chotta's laptop from the flat, and they decide to go to the police commissioner's office. Meanwhile, Bhargavi informs Dheena that Chotta and the female associate are escaping. Dheena starts to chase them in his car and manages to shoot down the female associate, killing her, while injuring Chotta. Dheena arrests Chotta and brings him to the police commissioner's office. The police uses narcotics to get the password from Chotta, and Madhu successfully logs into his Gmail account. He finds out about the plan. Since Chotta instructed the bombers to check the mail just one hour prior to the attack, the draft message remains unchecked by the bombers. Madhu deletes the drafts sent by Chotta and sends a new location detail to all of the four bombers, which happened to be the same location. As all the four bombers receive the draft by the next day, they go to the location, which is a bus and plant the bombs, only to find out they have been set up. The bus is filled with police officers in disguise, who are in undercover work. They immediately arrest the four bombers and deactivate the bombs. Madhu is hailed as a hero for saving the city. Dheena also approves Madhu and gets Bhargavi married to him. Madhu manages to build his dream home.

That night, Tang whips Sun Wukong for his disobedience.\nThe next morning, Tang goes to find water for their breakfast congee and comes across a house. Its host, a beautiful woman in a splendid outfit (Wang Likun), welcomes them all in for breakfast with her companions. Sun Wukong, however, sees through their disguises as spider demons; he purposely provokes them until she and the others show their true form. During the subsequent battle, the demons come together to form one huge spider. After being poisoned by the spider, Sha Wujing falls ill and slowly bloats into a fish-like creature. Sun Wukong defeats the spider and Tang attempts to exorcise her, but Sun Wukong smashes in the demon's head with one blow. Once more, Tang is annoyed at Sun Wukong's disobedience and whips him again that evening. Later that night, the enraged Sun Wukong discusses with the other disciples his plans to kill Tang, but the others fear Tang's mighty Buddha Palm powers. Tang overhears this conversation and prays to Buddha to help him and also confesses that he actually does not know, or have, Buddha Palm powers. Zhu Bajie overhears this admission and tells Sun Wukong, who challenges Tang to a fight. Just as Sun Wukong is about to strike, a blinding ray of light shines from the heavens and he retreats.\nThe next day, the group pass into the capital city of the Biqiu Kingdom and a minister (Yao Chen) comes out to greet them and bring them to see the king: an immature and childlike man who likes to play games. The king orders Tang to perform for him but the monk does not have anything to showcase. Sun Wukong therefore pastes an \"obedience sticker\" on Tang allowing Tang to copy his actions and perform stunts for the king. Sun Wukong, however, goes too far and makes Tang slap the king continuously, who throws them all out. Tang orders Sun Wukong to return and apologize, but it is revealed that Sun Wukong purposely provoked the king to make him reveal his form as the demon Red Boy. They fight and Sun Wukong defeats Red Boy, also freeing the true king of Biqiu (Bao Bei'er) from his cage under the throne. As a reward for helping him, the king presents them with a beautiful girl, Felicity (Lin Yun), to accompany them on their travels. As Felicity dances for them, Tang is reminded of his deceased lover, Duan (Shu Qi).\nThe group set off and on the way, Sun Wukong realizes that Felicity is actually a demon. In the meantime, Felicity takes out the nose plugs on Sha Wujing, allowing him to sneeze out the poison and turn him back into his human form. Tang, however, does not believe him, so they set off to visit Felicity's home village. Sun Wukong becomes enraged with Tang's lack of trust in him and that night he destroys the whole village, killing everyone. Tang stops him from killing Felicity, further angering Sun Wukong, who attacks Tang, but Felicity finally confesses that she is actually the demon White Bone Spirit and that the whole village was an illusion conjured by her. Sun Wukong flares up and turns into a giant Monkey King demon and swallows Tang. At that moment, the minister and Red Boy arrive and see Sun Wukong has fallen for their trick.\nThey had deliberately sent Felicity with the group to cause strife between Tang and Sun Wukong, so Sun Wukong would kill his master. Sun Wukong spits Tang out, however, as they had known this all along, but played along with story so that the minister would reveal her true form. They battle and the minister creates an illusion of Buddhas surrounding Sun Wukong, using them to fight him. The real Buddha, however, uses his giant palm to destroy the false Buddhas and reveals the minister's real identity as the Immortal Golden Vulture.\nAfter the battle, Tang heads back to find a dying Felicity. He has no choice but to free her soul as there is too much demon in her. Before she dies, Felicity asks Tang if he loves her, Tang replies that he has only one person in his heart. The animosity between Tang and Sun Wukong has finally dissolved; together with Sha Wujing and Zhu Bajie, they continue their journey to the West through a desert.\nIn a post-credits scene, breaking of the fourth wall was invoked with the appearance of a modern movie theater, where theater employees telling both the viewer and the in-story audience that its time to leave and there is no post-credits scene.", "tmdb_plot": "Tang Monk brings three disciples on a journey to the West.

Since the villagers, who have denied supporting the factory, are abroad and cannot come to Hyderabad within five days to rebut Aggarwal's claims, and the verdict is to be decided within five days, Seenu decides to take drastic measures to sensationalize the issue. He, Lakshmi, Malli, and the inmates of the old-age home block water supply to Hyderabad by sitting on the pipelines which carry water to Hyderabad. With the plight of the Hyderabad people due to lack of water supply having gained national attention, Seenu comes out of the pipeline after a few days and highlights the villagers' plight in an emotionally charged speech to the media, which is telecast nationwide and moves many people.\nMeanwhile, Shankar and the henchmen reach Hyderabad, but Shankar is soon kidnapped by Aggarwal's henchmen. While in Aggarwal's custody, he sees Seenu's speech on television and is moved by the efforts made by his doppelg\u00e4nger to help the villagers. On the night before the verdict, Seenu's bluff is exposed, but he assures the old men that he is genuinely interested in their cause, that Shankar is alive and that he will rescue Shankar from Aggarwal and hand him back over to the villagers with the assurance of a positive verdict. Seenu goes to Aggarwal's office, where Shankar is being held. He rescues Shankar and fights Aggarwal. Shankar kills Aggarwal when he is about to kill Seenu.

Her father, Sheriff Hartman, is called to the crime scene, where he is shocked to find his daughter deceased. Despite the efforts of matriarch Verna Sawyer, Hartman responds by taking Jedidiah into custody as retribution against the Sawyers, sending him to a mental institution known as the Gorman House Youth Reformery.\nTen years later at the Gorman House, where inmates are renamed to avoid their dangerous families, nurse Elizabeth White forms a bond with a boy named Jackson.

Planning to kill them, he gleefully tells Elizabeth that Jackson is really Jedidiah Sawyer. However, the Sawyer family arrives to save the helpless Jedidiah, beating Hartman into submission and taking all three of them into captivity.\nBack at the Sawyer home, Verna stitches the remnants of Jedidiah's face and applies a muzzle to hold them together.

As the family celebrates, Elizabeth flees into the woods while the Sawyers give chase. She nearly escapes, only to be caught in a bear trap. Elizabeth attempts to appeal to Jedidiah's sympathy, while Verna encourages him to kill her to protect their family.

The Soyuz detaches and crashes into the ISS, causing the ISS's orbit to decay again.\nThe remaining survivors, David and Miranda, speculate that Calvin could survive re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, so they plan to lure Calvin into one of the ISS' two escape pods. Once inside, David will manually pilot the pod containing Calvin into deep space, thereby isolating it and enabling Miranda to return to Earth in the other pod. David leads Calvin into his pod and launches into space as Miranda launches her pod, and the two pods go in different directions. As Miranda's pod flies in one direction, she records a black box message to warn Earth of Calvin's threat. Subsequently, one pod is hit by debris, while David is attacked by Calvin while trying to pilot. Eventually, one of the two pods lands in the sea and is found by Vietnamese fishermen, while the other pod flies away from Earth. What the Vietnamese fishermen find turns out to be David's pod. Meanwhile, Miranda's pod flies uncontrollably into deep space.

He works on a crossword puzzle from his daily newspaper. Lucky then walks to a convenience store where he buys another pack of cigarettes and a carton of milk. The owner, Bibi, tells Lucky that her son Juan is having his tenth birthday in a week. That evening, Lucky stops at a bar called Elaine's and has a few Bloody Marias with the locals. One of the regulars, Howard, is depressed that his pet tortoise, named President Roosevelt, has escaped.\nThe next morning, Lucky becomes entranced by the blinking numbers on his coffeepot. He gets light-headed and falls over, smashing his ceramic mug. At a clinic, Dr. Christian Kneedler gives Lucky a clean bill of health and tells him that Lucky has out-smoked and outlived the majority of people his age. At the diner, Lucky mentions how he fell and everyone becomes concerned for his safety. That night, Lucky calls a friend while he watches TV. He tells his friend that when he was a boy in Kentucky, he shot a mockingbird with his BB gun. He describes how devastating the silence was, and that it was the saddest thing he had ever experienced. Lucky thanks his friend for listening and hangs up.\nBack at the bar, Lucky listens to a story from one of the regulars, Paulie, about how he met and married his wife. Lucky reflects on how he never married or had any lasting relationships. Lucky sees Howard talking with a lawyer named Bobby Lawrence about making a will for himself and wanting to leave all of his possessions to his pet tortoise. Lucky is hostile to Bobby and challenges him to a fight outside, but Paulie tells him that Bobby won't fight him and that he should go home. A day or two later, Joe's employee Loretta visits Lucky to check on him. While smoking marijuana, Lucky shows Loretta old photos of his time in the US Navy and they watch old VHS tapes of Liberace in concert.

Lucky visits a pet store and buys a box of live crickets.\nLucky meets a World War II Marine veteran named Fred and tells him about his time in the US Navy during the war in the Pacific. Lucky explains that he got his nickname from having the relatively safe job of cook on an LST. Fred tells Lucky a story about how after the Marines secured a beach, the locals began to commit suicide by jumping off cliffs. After a battle, he encountered a child, smiling amidst the carnage. Fred remarked to his fellow Marine that at least someone was glad to see them, only to be told that the girl was a Buddhist and was smiling at the prospect of dying. The story leaves Lucky speechless. Upon returning home, he sets the clock on his coffee machine to the correct time, stopping it from blinking. He attends Bibi's son Juan's birthday party and enjoys himself. He spontaneously sings \"Volver Volver\" in Spanish for the party goers.\nThat evening, Lucky goes back to the bar for more Bloody Marias.

The plot then shifts to a young crime inspector named Kumaran (Sundeep Kishan), who is chasing a petty thief and witnesses Dheena murdering his wife. Kumaran chases Dheena, who corners him and halts him with a blow to his head. In an ensuing tussle, Kumaran manages to kill Dheena.\nA meeting with psychiatrist Aadhirai (Lavanya Tripathi) ends on a rough note when she deems him medically unfit to rejoin the police force. Later, when he faces symptoms which attribute to PTSD, he mends his ways with Aadhirai, who helps him overcome his disorder. A second murder happens in which a famous actress, Vishma (Akshara Gowda) is killed. Kumaran visits the spot and gets stressed and shocked upon finding similar bloodstains from the earlier murder and the same brand of cigarette smoked by the murderer. Aadhirai finds him, treats him for his PTSD, and makes him normal. Kumaran meets with Rudhran (Daniel Balaji) and introduces Aadhirai to him as a motivational speaker. Kumaran, now fitter, sets out his investigation and finds that a makeup man named Gopi (Mime Gopi) must have done the murder as he is the prime suspect. Upon investigation, he gets to know that Gopi and Dheena showed a different behavior a few days before they committed the murders. Kumaran tracks down Gopi, but he jumps to his death before confessing anything.\nThe next murder happens, and the victim is another scientist named Narayanan (Kathi Ravi). Kumaran tries to find shreds of evidence in Narayanan's home and finds a book written by Rudhran. Thinking that Rudhran might know the scientist, Kumaran visits his office and finds that his behavior has changed. His dog starts to bark at him, and he has also started to smoke recently, that too the same brand that was found in the earlier murders. Kumaran deduces that some strange thing is happening, and Rudhran could either be murdered or become the next murderer. He nabs Rudhran when he shows his more ruthless and cold-blooded side when he kills his dog. Kumaran takes Rudhran into custody. While signing on the FIR, Rudhran signs a different name but corrects it to his sign. Kumaran notices this and finds out that the first sign was signed \"Pramodh\".\nA brief investigation reveals that Pramodh is a late colleague of Narayanan. They worked together at the Indian Institute of Neurosciences. A senior official named Velayudham (Jayaprakash) reveals that Pramodh was involved in a project called Project Maayavan, which could enable a person to store their memories into a hard drive, which can be transferred to another individual by injecting a gel which would house millions of nano-transmitters. When injected into the brain, these transmitters will attach to the neurons. When the person dies, their memories could be transmitted to another individual whose brain would already have been injected with the gel. The memories of the new person will first be erased, and the old person's memories will be transferred via the nano-transmitters. This way the person (their memories) will not die and will instead live forever.\nTo prove his theory, Pramodh works day and night. During this experiment, he sends a patient into a coma but is not bothered about human life and instead wants to succeed in his mission. After Narayanan becomes the Director of the Indian Institute of Neurosciences, he stops Pramodh's project. Pramodh uses himself as the subject, transfers his memories in a hard drive, and commits suicide. Once he dies, his memories get transferred to his trainer, and then to Gopi and then Rudhran. Kumaran solves this and finds that the next target is Army general Major Sathyan (Jackie Shroff). Pramodh, who is living in Rudhran's body, commits suicide and arrives in Sathyan's brain. Sathyan invites Kumaran and says that his technology will let him live for more than 1000 years, and no one can stop him.

Pramodh successfully retrieves the hard drive containing his memories, which includes blackmailing and later killing Kumaran's friend Karna (Bagavathi Perumal). He then kidnaps Velayudham and goes to the institute lab to let him switch to another body. Kumaran tracks him down, and a gunfight ensues. Finally, Kumaran realizes that Aadhirai is the next subject. If Sathyan dies, then Pramodh's memories will transfer to Aadhirai's body, leaving Kumaran with a difficult choice.\n20 years later, Kumaran is happily married to Aadhirai who is celebrating her 40th birthday with their son.

This stone was owned by an ancient king named Irumporai and is rumoured to be cursed; anyone who laid their hands on the stone died due to a lorry accident, with the lorry rumoured to be driven by the spirit of King Irumporai. He hires a contractor named John (Mime Gopi), who has connections with local gangs that could do the job. He offers \u20b910,00,00,000 for the contract, but no one is willing to do the job as they are afraid of the curse. Only Senguttavan, who is frustrated at the small-time work he is doing under Ramdoss, is interested in the offer as he wants to involve himself in something big and challenging. Elango convinces Senguttuvan to approach a local priest (Kota Srinivasa Rao) who could protect them from the curse. The priest hands Senguttavan and Elango a lemon, at which point the ghosts of the 132 people killed by the curse are revealed to them. The priest tells them that if they are going to pursue the stone, they will need to seek the help of one of the ghosts.\nBack home, Senguttuvan and Elango complete the ritual to summon one of the ghosts: Elango's uncle Chidambaram. Unfortunately, before the ghost could appear, the duo is interrupted by the news that Ramdoss has died due to a heart attack. During Ramdoss's burial, the lemon accidentally slips from Senguttavan's pocket and falls on Ramdoss's hand, as a result of which Chidambaram's ghost possesses Ramdoss's body and appears in front of Senguttavan and Elango the following morning, much to their shock. The ghost decides to use three recently dead people and possess them with ghosts of three other people killed by the curse to help Senguttavan and Elango in their mission. The first is an old beggar Selvaraj (Sangili Murugan) who died in his sleep alongside the road. The second is a man (Arunraja Kamaraj) who got decapitated in a freak accident. The third happens to be Chanakya, who hanged herself.

This leads them to recover an emerald medallion, which turns out to be a fake. However, their methods draw the attention of Ramanathan. He previously rejected the idea of pursuing the stone but changes his mind. After realizing that they recovered a replica, the group continues to piece clues together. They find the man who made the fake, who is now on his deathbed. Before he dies, the man gives them clues to who ordered the fake medallion - a local doctor named Krishnan (Gajaraj) who happens to be one of the men killed by the curse. They find his son, who is also a doctor, and kidnap him. Before they can get him to tell them where the original medallion is, they are caught by Ramanathan's henchmen and are taken to his torture chamber. They manage to escape the torturers and eventually find the original medallion.\nDespite Chidambaram's warning, Senguttuvan and Elango touch the stone and are thereby cursed. They arrange for a meeting with John and the Chinese businessman for the exchange, but on the way, they are pursued by the mysterious driverless lorry. John and the Chinese businessman are run over by the lorry and killed. Senguttuvan manages to elude the lorry initially and recover the suitcase full of money. They then run into the Tamil teacher, who is in Selvaraj's body. He tells them that they must return the stone to the King's grave to lift the curse. On the way to the gravesite, they are pursued by both the mystery lorry and Ramanathan's gang, who are hell bent on taking the stone from them. The group manages to elude both and get to the gravesite. Before they can return the stone, Ramanathan's gang shows up. Senguttavan makes a deal with Ramanathan that after he places the stone in the King's grave, he can take it, to which he agrees.

Marjorie has chosen a younger version of her late husband Walter (Hamm), who died fifteen years ago. This choice disturbs Tess as she does not trust the system's functionalities, so she does not talk to Walter's hologram. Marjorie tells stories of her life to Walter Prime and enjoys listening to him tell them back, usually asking him to embellish some to make them better and prettier the next time he tells them, so that the new story will become her new memory. Meanwhile, Julie (Andujar), Marjorie's caretaker, moves in with the family to watch over her and confides in Walter.\nIn time, Walter Prime becomes curious about the real Walter's personal and professional lives and starts asking Jon about them. He appears to desire to know the reason why he couldn't tell his children how much he loved them. Jon tells Walter Prime a family secret that must never be repeated to Marjorie: she and Walter had a son named Damian who committed suicide forty years earlier and, before doing so, killed the beloved family dog Toni II (a black French poodle who looked just like the family's previous dog, Toni) to take her with him. Marjorie hasn't said Damian's name since then. Despite Walter Prime's understanding about not telling her, Marjorie suddenly asks for Damian in a bout of dementia. Tess finds a Bible in the living room table and accuses Julie (who had given it to Marjorie) of taking advantage of Marjorie's condition to religiously manipulate her (since Marjorie has always been an atheist), which prompts Marjorie to become upset and urinate herself.\nLater on Tess and Marjorie are sitting on the couch talking. It is soon revealed that Marjorie has died and Tess is talking to a Prime version of Marjorie; Jon recommended the Prime Program for his wife to help her cope with the death of her mother. Tess remains highly skeptical of the Prime program, especially because Marjorie Prime is constantly smiling and appears to be too understanding to truly impersonate Marjorie's real personality. This leads Tess to realize she has chosen the aged version of her mother because this is the version she still has things she needs to say to. Meanwhile, in a flashback to when Walter was alive, he and Marjorie are sitting on the couch watching the nightly news, which shows \u201cThe Gates\u201d, an art exhibit by Christo and Jean-Claude that ran in Central Park during February 2005.

They discuss a memory of the dog Toni, believing Tess was the one who picked him out. Walter tells them that Tess didn't pick Toni: Damian did. He picked her because she looked like their old dog, also named Toni, who died before Tess was born and whom she never knew existed. After hearing the story, Marjorie and Tess can remember Damian too. As Walter apologizes for saddening them, Marjorie responds by saying the only thing she can think of is \"how nice that we could love somebody\".", "tmdb_plot": "A service which creates holographic projections of late family members allows an elderly woman to spend time with a younger version of her deceased husband.", "tmdb_id": "426254", "wiki_id": "49418161"}, {"title": "Mark Felt: The Man Who Brought Down the White House", "genres": ["Drama", "History", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "The movie starts on April 11, 1972.

She urges them to leave their past behind and make new memories. Things start off well, and they make friends with a girl named Allie. However, Rose's health worsens and she dies, leaving behind her children Jack (20), Jane (19), Billy (18) and Sam (5). Before dying, Rose instructs Jack to hide news of her death until he turns 21 and legally able to care for his siblings. Six months later, the person who the family was running from finds the place.\nAnother six months later, the siblings still live in the house. All the mirrors are hidden or covered to protect them from a \"ghost\" in the loft, which had apparently been gone for several months. Of all the siblings, only Jack visits the local town to take care of any necessities. He courts Allie, now a library employee, while keeping his past from her. The town lawyer, Tom Porter, is in charge of the Marrowbone estate, and has unrequited affections for Allie.\nTom informs Jack he will come to collect the $200 fee and Rose's signature to finish the paperwork that transfers ownership of the estate to Jack. Desperate for money, Jack uses the \"cursed\" money of their father. Billy retrieves the money box at a secluded spot on the beach. Jack gives $200 to Tom, and Jane fakes Rose's signature on the papers, concluding the transfer.\nAfter several incidents, the siblings believe the \"ghost\" is back because they used the money. Billy \"returns the money\" by climbing on the roof and throwing the box with the rest of the money down the chimney into the attic. Sam sneaks into Rose's old room, where all the mirrors are kept, sees the \"ghost\" inside a mirror, and is traumatized. At this point, it is heavily implied that the \"ghost\" was their abusive father, who was bricked up in the attic and starved to death. Jane suggests properly burying him, but Jack dismisses the idea.\nAfter Allie firmly rejects Tom's advances, he gives her a folder containing the investigation on the Marrowbone siblings. The files inside revealed their father, Simon Fairbairn, to be a notorious serial killer who also, it is implied, raped and impregnated his daughter. He was convicted in court, with Jack a key witness, and later broke out of jail. In the house, Jane saw a raccoon being attacked and dragged into the attic and is convinced that Simon is still alive.\nTom is informed his potential employer is no longer interested in an employee, but a partner. He is offered 10% of their share for $5,000, which he doesn't have. Tom believes that the Marrowbone siblings have $10,000, which was listed as missing from Simon Fairbairn's property, and blackmails his eldest son. Billy climbs down the attic to retrieve the box, and barely escapes Simon's assault. Billy confronts Jack about Simon and urges Jack to deal with him together. Their argument is interrupted when Jack faints and has a seizure. Jane decides they must tell Allie the truth. The siblings send Allie their diary. While Allie reads through it, Tom arrives at the house. Seeing the bricked up attic entrance, he is convinced the money is hidden there and tears down the wall.\nThe diary reveals that when Simon found the house six months ago, Jack locked his siblings inside the attic. He tried to give the money box back to Simon at the secluded place on the beach, but was knocked out by his criminally vengeful father. When Jack regained consciousness, he returned to the house, only to realize Simon had entered the attic through the chimney and killed his younger siblings. After bricking up the attic, Jack prepared to commit suicide, but imagined his younger brothers and sister into existence. Mimicking his equally late mother, Jack begins to \"make new memories.\" He hides all the mirrors to avoid reminding himself that he is alone, and avoids going into the attic for the same reason. The \"younger siblings\" eventually become alternate personalities within his mind.\nAfter learning the truth, Allie goes to the Marrowbone house and finds Jack's different personalities arguing with each other. She tries to snap him out of it, but he drives her away, unwilling to accept the deaths of his siblings. Noticing Tom's belongings, Allie goes up the attic and finds Jane, Billy and Sam's desiccated corpses, as well as a dying Tom. She confronts a horribly malnourished but still ferocious Simon, while calling out for Jack's alternate personalities for help. Billy cries out to Jack to please let him take care of this. Eventually, Jack lets Billy take over and kills Simon, ending his threat for good.\nSome time later, Allie decides to stay and care for Jack after he is released from a psychiatric hospital after twelve weeks (three months). She disregards the doctor's recommendation to make sure Jack takes his medicine, so he will no longer have his younger siblings' personalities dominant within his fractured psyche.

Upon his return to his New York City office, he is sent to Bridgeport, Connecticut, to defend Joseph Spell, a chauffeur accused of rape by his white employer, Eleanor Strubing, in a case that has gripped the newspapers.  In Bridgeport, insurance lawyer Sam Friedman is assigned by his brother to get Marshall admitted to the local bar, against his will.  At the hearing, Judge Foster, a friend of the father of prosecutor Lorin Willis, agrees to admit Marshall, but forbids Marshall from speaking during the trial, forcing Friedman to be Spell's lead counsel.  Marshall must guide Friedman through notes, such as when he advises Friedman to allow a woman of Southern white descent into the jury because of her assertive and questioning personality.\nSpell swears to Marshall that he never had any sexual contact with Strubing and leads the lawyers to a patrolman who stopped Spell that night while he was driving Strubing's car.  Marshall and Friedman investigate Strubing's story that Spell tied her up in the back seat of her car after raping her and drove to a bridge to throw her over.  They wonder why Spell appeared to throw her over the calm side instead of the side with rapids.  Spell is initially interested in a plea bargain offered by Willis, but Marshall talks him out of it.  Later on at trial, though, a doctor testifies to finding pieces of skin underneath Strubing's fingernails, as well as bruises.  Strubing herself testifies that she was tied in the back seat when the patrolman pulled Spell over.  With this information, Marshall and Friedman confront Spell, who admits that he was lying about not having had sexual contact with Strubing.\nAt trial, Spell testifies that Strubing's husband inflicted the bruises through repeated acts of spousal abuse.  That night, he went to ask Strubing for money to pay off a debt, finding a distraught Strubing wanting to have sex with him.  Spell consented, and the two had several sexual encounters that night.  Strubing then panicked about being found out and being pregnant.  Spell tried to drive her to a doctor, but Strubing had to hide in the back seat when the patrolman questioned him.  A hysterical Strubing forced Spell to stop by a bridge where she ran out and tried to kill herself.  When Spell tried to stop her, she scratched him and jumped off the bridge.  But she survived and flagged down a motorist making up a desperate story about rape.  When Willis asks why Spell didn't tell the truth to begin with, Spell talks about how black men get tortured and lynched in his native Louisiana for having sex with white women.  Over Willis's objections, Judge Foster, who is shown to be horrified by Spell's revelation as are the members of the jury, allows Spell's statement to stand.\nBefore the verdict, Marshall has to leave for a case in Mississippi.  A desperate Willis offers Spell a much lighter plea bargain, but Spell feels emboldened enough to turn it down.

It is not lethal, but infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, resulting in people acting out their darkest impulses, which may include murder. Nevil Reed commits the first known case of murder driven by ID-7, but he was not deemed liable due to the virus' influence. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting (TSC), found the loophole that won Reed's case, earning him a corner office. Derek began his job full of optimism, but quickly lost his moral compass climbing the corporate ladder, even neglecting his family.\nOne morning, Derek goes into work and meets with a desperate client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan. Derek thinks he cannot help and calls security on her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vanda Corp. has been pinned on him by his superior, Kara Powell (\"The Siren\", as she has the ear of company head John Towers), Derek confronts her. They plead their cases to Towers, who orders Derek fired. Human resource chief Lester \"The Reaper\" McGill offers a hefty severance package in return for Derek claiming responsibility. Derek, afraid of being disbarred and sued, rejects this, so security begins escorting Derek out.\nJust then, the building is put under quarantine as the ID-7 virus has been detected in the ventilation system. A neutralizing agent was released into the building, with an estimated eight hours for the virus to be obliterated. However, everyone in the building is infected in the meantime, resulting in chaos, violence, and sex.\nDerek attempts to take the elevator upstairs to protest to Towers and the board of directors for his job back. Towers instead sends Derek to the basement to be beaten up by Towers' enforcer, Colton \"The Bull\" Snyder. Derek's friend Ewan arrives to help, but he is accidentally killed by The Bull, further infuriating Derek.\nDerek is locked up along with Melanie, who had resisted security. They quarrel but eventually decide to work together. Derek calls Vanda Corp., ensuring his innocence in the mishandled case, and costing TSC a payment from Vanda Corp. Realizing they will not be liable for their actions, Derek and Melanie grab weapons, intending to hold the people on the top floor responsible for their respective bad situations, but they require The Reaper's and Kara's key cards to get there. Derek takes out two security guards sent to attack them.\nEn route to The Reaper, Derek incapacitates two more guards. The Reaper attacks them; Melanie kills him with a power saw. Derek and Melanie use his card to get up to Kara's office. They duel and brutalize five of Kara's coworkers. Kara offers her card for her safety, but her long-suffering assistant Meg has already destroyed it, having been offered a promotion to do it to protect those upstairs. Meg cuts out The Siren's tongue and kills her. Towers taunts Derek by urinating on Ewan's corpse. Melanie comforts Derek and they have sex.\nNeeding another method to get upstairs, Derek and Melanie convince the company's one IT worker to hack Irene Smythe's computer, getting her to come down. They offer Smythe's files in exchange for her card and a reversal of her original denial of Melanie's loan extension. Smythe refuses, stating that contracts signed during this period can be invalidated citing the virus. Melanie destroys Smythe's files. The Bull attacks Derek but is killed with a screwdriver. Smythe offers Derek top floor access in exchange for revenge on Melanie. Derek accepts, but sabotages Melanie's restraints. Melanie escapes and kills Smythe with a hammer.\nOn the top floor, Towers offers Derek a full partnership, but Derek refuses. Derek fends off Towers' assistants and battles Towers. TSC's board give him permission to kill Towers, so Derek punches him off the building to his death just as the quarantine is lifted.\nDerek accepts the board's offer of Towers' job.

During his killing spree, he buried his victims in a bamboo grove that he bought. After killing a woman, he got into a car accident and injured his head, resulting in degenerative Alzheimer's disease. He stopped killing, resumed his job as a veterinarian, and continued taking care of his daughter Eun-hee (Kim Seol-hyun).\nOver the years, Byeong-soo's condition worsens. Large chunks of memories are lost at increasing frequencies. After multiple visits to the local police station (as he forgot where he lives), Byeong-soo strikes up an unlikely friendship with local policeman Byeong-man (Oh Dal-su). At Eun-hee's behest, Byeong-soo uses a recorder to maintain his routines. He types out everything he can remember into a memoir and saves it in his laptop. He also goes to a poetry class, where his poetic depictions of murders impresses his instructor and classmates, who believe they are metaphors. His classmate, Jo Yeon-joo (Hwang Seok-jeong), develops a crush on him, much to his annoyance.\nThe small town is shaken by the murders of two young women. Byeong-soo himself is confused and wondered if he did the killing.\nOn the way back from the bamboo grove (to check for new burials), he hit another car, popping its trunk open. Noticing a bloody bag in the trunk, he surreptitiously collects some blood on his handkerchief. The car's driver claims it is a deer's corpse and drives away without exchanging contact information.\nAfter ascertaining the blood sample is human, Byeong-soo calls the police anonymously, describing the encounter and the car's make and license plate. However, the tip is regarded as a prank, as the car's driver is a local policeman, Min Tae-joo (Kim Nam-gil). Byeong-soo also asks Byeong-man to run the license plate separately. Instinctively realizing Tae-joo is a serial killer like himself, Byeong-soo deduces where he was taking the body to. He finds the body and tips the police, catching Tae-joo's attention.\nTae-joo goes to Byeong-soo's clinic, where he meets Eun-hee. After a short while, the two begin dating. Byeong-soo sees the pair but does not recognize Tae-joo. After Byeong-man tells him about the license plate's owner, Byeong-soo realizes Tae-joo is the killer, and is approaching his daughter to taunt and threaten him. He gives Byeong-man the handkerchief with the blood, telling him it's from Tae-joo's car.\nByeong-soo tries to tell Eun-hee about his misgivings with Tae-joo, but realizes that Tae-joo had preemptively discussed with her about Byeong-soo's suspicious activities around the bamboo grove. Byeong-man calls him back with the lab's result claiming the blood sample is from a deer.\nSuppressing his self-doubts, Byeong-soo is determined to kill Tae-joo, but his failing mind and body betrays him. He starts experiencing hallucinations and a whole week's worth of memory is completely erased.\nByeong-soo wakes up finding himself tied up in his bedroom, with Tae-joo reading and liberally editing his memoir. Tae-joo admits to being the killer and having swapped the handkerchief with the blood sample. Byeong-soo tries to grab his bag for a weapon but fails and spills its contents onto the floor. Tae-joo threatens to kill Eun-hee unless Byeong-soo takes the blame for his crimes, then tranquilizes him. Byeong-soo wakes up and only vaguely remembers what happened.\nFearing for Eun-hee's safety, Byeong-soo orders her to stay with his sister Maria (Gil Hae-yeon) in her convent.

He flees, and the police begin digging up the bamboo grove, finding the bodies of Byeong-soo's past victims, as well as Yeon-joo.\nAt home, Byeong-soo recalls who his final victim was - his adulterous wife. Before killing her, he learned that Eun-hee was not his biological daughter. Arriving home after the car crash, Byeong-soo almost killed Eun-hee, but his injury caused him to forget the events surrounding his last kill. He comforted the terrified Eun-hee and continued caring for her. Recalling the recent incident in which he nearly strangled Eun-hee, mistaking her for his wife, Byeong-soo becomes convinced that he might have killed his daughter in a fit of insanity.\nThe guilt-ridden Byeong-soo prepares to kill himself as he listens to Eun-hee's voice on his recorder. However, he then hears Tae-joo confessing his crimes. During their earlier confrontation, he accidentally hit the \"Record\" button. He then realizes that he sent Eun-hee away in Tae-joo's car, not a taxi as he remembered.\nRenewed with vigor, Byeong-soo calls Byeong-man and plays the recording, convincing him that Tae-joo is the killer. Byeong-man follows Tae-joo to a cabin in the woods. Tae-joo strangles him and ties up Eun-hee after she sees the body. As Byeong-soo drives to the cabin, he speaks to the recorder, reminding himself to save Eun-hee, and puts Tae-joo's picture inside his locket to remember his face. Back at the cabin, while Tae-joo is monologuing about his life, he reveals a scar that relates to his and Byeong-soo's past. Eun-hee sneaks out of the room prompting Tae-joo to go outside in his car and look for her. Arriving at the cabin Byeong-soo sees him and crashes his car into Tae-joo's car.\nAfter entering the cabin, Byeong-soo's condition triggers again, completely blanking out his memory. Tae-joo, laughing with disbelief, begins to strangle Byeong-soo. Eun-hee calls to her father, bringing back his memory, and he begins fighting back. With Eun-hee's help, he eventually overpowers and kills Tae-joo. Eun-hee, having learned from Tae-joo earlier that her mother's body was found in the bamboo grove, is terrified of her father. Byeong-soo admits to his crimes and assures Eun-hee that she is not a murderer's daughter, as they are not blood related. Byeong-soo is subsequently incarcerated and processed into an internment facility.\nListening to Byeong-soo's last recording, Eun-hee learns that he keeps himself alive only for her. Deciding to forgive him, Eun-hee visits Byeong-soo, whose memory has deteriorated to the point that he mistakes her for Maria. She cuts his hair and gift him a new pair of white shoes. Byeong-soo, realizing that Eun-hee is the only reason that makes him want to live, decides to kill himself before wanting to live more and remember what he is, a murderer.

He has recently been framed of stealing the class funds, and is further humiliated in front of the class by a gang of bullies, consisting of leader Tuan Renhao, his girlfriend Wu Sihua, and Liao Kuoheng and Yeh Weichu. Suspecting them to be the actual thieves, Lin confronts them at their hideout at the school's abandoned swimming pool's maintenance room. Renhao mockingly confesses to his crime, stating that he needed the money to tune Kuo Feng's motorcycle scooter. Sihua then puts Lin's hand on her breast, making it appear as if he did so on his own free will and framing him as a pervert, with the bullies taking a picture of the scene and spreading it around the school, further degrading Lin's reputation. Lin is then restrained by the neck with an animal control pole, threatened by Renhao with corneal perforation from a wall dart, and released.\nExpecting to be overpowered, Lin used his phone to audio record the entire encounter conversation with the bullies. However, his teacher, Ms. Lee, points out that if the bullies were accused of the crime, the bullying would only get much worse. She then encourages Lin to accept the blame for the crime, and assigns the three male bullies to work with him, under the guise of them being the class's most popular individuals and with the intention of making the four boys closer. The four are told to perform community service for the elderly, by feeding them. However, the bullies abuse the elders instead, painting their faces and making them \"chicken fight\" each other. Initially disturbed by the bullies' actions, Lin participates and becomes visibly happy as he has been accepted and is now part of the gang.\nAt the end of their day, they come across an elderly war veteran of the National Revolutionary Army's 29th Broadswords unit suffering from dementia. They discover a locked box, and believe it to be filled with riches plundered from China, during the Nationalist withdrawal. They agree to return at night, to break open and steal the contents of the box. Upon their return, they are unable to open the box, and instead decide to take it back to the hideout. Unbeknownst to them however, a pair of female flesh-eating ghouls have made their home in the elderly home's elevator shaft, preying on both the mostly forgotten residents and the homeless. As the bullies start to leave, they come across the ghouls feasting on one of the elders. The older of the two flees into the shaft, while the younger attempts to pursue them. Terrified, the boys run out of the building, only to witness the younger ghoul get struck by a vehicle on the street. The driver flees the scene and the boys investigate the seemingly dead ghoul. When the ghoul tries to attack Kuofeng, Renhao knocks her out with a shovel. Unable to leave the ghoul there, as there is a traffic camera pointed at the scene, the bullies take the ghoul back to the hideout, believing her to be dead. Meanwhile, the elder ghoul mourns the disappearance of her sibling.\nThat morning, the bullies search the box but find nothing but medals and old photos. The younger ghoul reawakens and exhibits supernatural capabilities, such as regeneration, and the ability to climb on walls. As the ghoul confronts the boys, it accidentally steps in a ray of sunlight and its foot is burned by the sun's touch. The bullies immediately capitalize on this weakness, using a portrait of Sun Yat-sen to subdue the ghoul, trapping her under a box. They eventually tie the ghoul to a pillar in the center of the room using chains. Si Hua is informed of the monster's presence, and the gang discover the monster's flesh-eating disposition. Ren Hao exults in having the monster as a captive, stating that since it's not a human, they can do anything they want to it. Lin meanwhile, sympathizes with the ghoul, stating to her that the bullies will probably let her go after they've had their fun. Renhao extracts several of the monster's teeth and blood, with Sihua sanitizing and using them as part of her bracelet. The boys further torture the ghoul, drilling a plate to cover her mouth and applying more chains and locks to her mouth.\nBack at the elderly home, the war veteran, traumatized by the abduction of his compatriots, dons his old uniform and with broadsword in hand, begins singing an army song (\u4e2d\u570b\u7684\u99f1\u99dd), inviting the ghoul to find him. The ghoul is attracted by the noise, and confronts the veteran, who identifies himself as Superior Private Li Rengfeng. Though briefly interrupted by a neighbor, who chastises the veteran for his singing in the middle of the night, the ghoul and the old soldier clash, which results in the ghoul being ejected from the fourth-floor window, still alive but with her right arm nearly completely severed. The veteran, unscathed in the clash, smiles and dies whilst still standing.\nBack at the maintenance room, the bullies continue to torment their captive monster. After using clumsy attempts at religious exorcism and wrapping the monster in scripture, Ren Hao instructs Lin to thank the monster, implying that the latter would have been the one tied to the pillar and tormented had the ghoul not been there. Attempting to find out more about their monster, the bullies take blood samples from the creature, and study it in the school's lab, noting the lack of any red blood cells and the presence of eggs or spores on the monster's blackened cells, and that contact with normal blood cells causes the blackened cells to \"infect\" the blood cells, turning them black as well. They also notice that continuous contact with the sun causes the blackened cells to spontaneously combust. Lin does some research on the ghouls, identifying the younger monster as Lee Shiu Jen who went missing in 1985, alongside her sister, known as the Voodoo Master. From the news article Lin finds, it appears that the two went missing when they killed their parents, with the Voodoo Master using the dark arts to conjure a poison involving female menstruation, with the effects having backfired spectacularly as seen by the two girls' current state.\nLin prints out the information he finds, and presents it to Renhao, stating that the ghouls are indeed human. Ren Hao tosses aside the information, stating that no matter what the ghoul was before, its current state is that of a monster. Lin then asks what the purpose of keeping the monster is, and states that the monster would probably starve soon. The other bullies then decide on using Lin as a living blood bag to keep the monster alive. They further torment the monster by spraying blood at her, and terrorizing the ghoul by putting its head in a bird cage and dancing around it wearing face paint.\nThe next day, one of Lin's classmates tampers with his chair, causing it to collapse when he sits down. Contrary to his past behavior where he would congratulate the prankster and laugh along, Ren Hao beats the perpetrator to the point of hospitalization, in front of the entire class and Ms. Lee. Renhao justifies this, stating that only he would be the one that could beat Lin. During the disciplinary meeting after the event, Ms. Lee, a devout Buddhist, attempts to correct Ren Hao's behavior with spiritual guidance. Infuriated at the mockery Ren Hao makes of her attempts, she slap him repeatedly, and humiliates him by mentioning his family circumstances, with his alleged father being a criminal, and his mother being a prostitute. Renhao is thrown into a rage, and takes out his anger on the ghoul, beating her severely with a bat. After noticing the monster's blood combusting, he alongside the rest of the bullies poisons Ms. Lee's drink with the monster's blood. During a basketball game, several hours after drinking the monster's blood, Ms. Lee spontaneously combusts upon contact with the sun. Video of this event is shown on the news, which the older ghoul notices, along with the school's uniform. At a drinking party to celebrate the death of their teacher, Lin is offered several drinks by the bullies, but declines them out of fear of what happened to Ms. Lee. Out of spite, Sihua drinks Lin's drink, while Renhao states to Lin that he could kill him \"in a million ways\", thus poisoning him would be pointless. Sihua then expresses her exasperation at Lin's continued involvement with the group, stating that he was the only one who didn't want to see the monster die, and that he could have released the monster at any time, mocking him for being meaningless as he wanted to be \"the good guy\" but never possessing any courage to actually do anything. Lin later takes out his anger on a mentally challenged convenience store clerk, wrecking the store and stealing his money.\nThe older ghoul begins systematically hunting down individuals wearing the school's uniform, regardless of their involvement with her sister's predicament. Her attacks include ambushing a student getting a drink at a vending machine, and slaughtering a bus full of students. Sihua is on the bus at the time and manages to take a picture of the monster before the ghoul notices Si Hua's bracelet with her sister's teeth on it, and gruesomely kills her. In grief, Renhao pulls out hundreds of the younger monster's teeth. The monster also attacks an after-school program, slaughtering dozens of students, but sparing a pair of sisters. The remaining bullies decide to eliminate the older monster, using her sister as bait. Ren Hao plans to lock both monsters in the maintenance room, then pour gasoline in through the sprinklers and throwing a match down the ventilation pipe. Ren Hao and Kuofeng would be the ones pouring and igniting the gasoline, while Weizhu would be the lookout and Lin would be the one locking both monsters in. Unbeknownst to the bullies, Lin unscrews one of the window coverings, wanting the monsters to escape the trap, stating to the younger ghoul that he wants to at least do one thing right in his life.\nLured to the war veteran's room by the sound of her sister's cries, the monster follows arrows leading to the pool during the night. Before the monster reaches the pool, Lin asks Weizhu the reason they had framed him in the first place. Wei Zhu simply replies that \"it was fun\". Realizing that it was likely he would receive similar treatment to the monster after their escape, Lin sabotages the plan by calling Weizhu's phone when the monster shows up, causing the monster to corner and kill the latter. Lin then locks himself inside the maintenance room, leaving Kuofeng and Renhao outside to face the elder monster. Lin disregards Renhao's pleas to let him in by stating that one day, the bullies would likely torture him to death, and that this was the only way that he would be able to kill them off. The older monster kills Kuo Feng after he charges her with a hatchet, and then kills Renhao outside the maintenance room door. Lin retreats inside the room as the monster breaks down the door. Despite his pleas for the monster to spare him, the monster throws him around the room.\nIn an act of desperation, Lin opens the window that he had previously unscrewed, with the sun rising at exactly the same time. The beam of light strikes the younger ghoul, who immediately begins burning from its effects and is unable to escape it due to the restraints. The older sister frantically shields the younger sister and tries to tear the chains off, instead destroying her fingers in the process. With both of them beginning to combust, the older sister embraces the younger sister, dying in each other's arms. Lin leaves the maintenance hall and the bodies of the bullies behind in a daze.\nLater that day, Lin is assigned to lunch duty, being assigned to take care of the classes' soup container. It is shown that despite the bullies' deaths, the rest of the class still torments him. During lunch, he throws out the soup of another bullied student who had pitied him before, telling her that she wasn't \"one of them\". It is then revealed that Lin had kept the rest of the vial used to poison Ms. Lee, and had dumped the rest of it into the soup container, infecting everyone else in the class, including himself.

Walter, who has not filed a flight plan, suffers a fatal stroke mid-flight, and the plane crashes on a mountaintop in the High Uintas Wilderness. Ben, Alex, and Walter's Labrador Retriever survive the crash but Alex has injured her leg quite badly.

Henry seems uncomfortable asking and Hap hesitates to reply.\nA few years prior, Henry is conned out of renting a home and is forced to live near sharecroppers on a farm outside the town of Marietta, Mississippi and moves there with his wife Laura, their daughters, and his virulently racist father, Pappy. The Jackson family, led by tenant farmer Hap and his wife Florence, work the farm's cotton field and dream of owning their own land one day. As World War II begins, Jamie and the Jacksons' eldest son, Ronsel, join the United States Army Air Corps and U.S. Army, respectively. Both men experience severe war trauma in the European theater as Jamie flies B-25 bombers and Ronsel commands tanks. Ronsel also falls in love with a white German woman. Meanwhile, in Mississippi both families continue to live in poverty and support each other out of necessity. When the Jacksons' mule has to be euthanized, Henry offers to rent out his mule but exacts half of the Jacksons' crop in payment; leaving the Jacksons no choice but to accept. Florence also helps the McAllan family when their two young daughters fall ill with whooping cough; and then Laura offers Florence work to help care for her daughters permanently. Hap, who serves as the preacher for the local black community, falls while helping to build a church, breaking his leg and rendering him unable to work his fields. Laura sneaks money from her husband's safe so Hap can be properly treated by a doctor, much to Henry's disapproval and causing their passionless marriage to worsen.\nWhen the war ends, Ronsel and Jamie return home and realize that they have changed but the Mississippi Delta has not. Jamie becomes an alcoholic and suffers from PTSD. Ronsel, accustomed to the relative lack of racism among Europeans, struggles with racism in Mississippi.

The photo is of her and their bi-racial child. Ronsel shares this with Jamie while driving together when their truck passes Pappy, and Ronsel is forced to duck down to hide. Pappy confronts Jamie about him socializing with Ronsel and scolds him for his drunken behavior and sneers at Laura, claiming she has romantic feelings for Jamie. Later, Ronsel realizes that he lost the photograph that Pappy finds in the truck. Laura confronts Jamie as he prepares to leave and they have sex.\nAs Ronsel frantically searches for his photograph, he is ambushed and beaten by Pappy and members of the Ku Klux Klan. Pappy brings Jamie to a barn where the Klan is preparing to kill Ronsel for fathering a child with a white woman. Jamie points a gun at his father in an effort to save his friend and is also beaten by the Klan.

Alok justifies the break-up by explaining to his parents Indu's changed behaviour, her partying and drinking habits and is firm on not wanting to get back together. His father however, wants to hear Indu's side of the story too. He tricks Alok and his mother into going out to lunch, but also invites Indu, who agrees out of respect towards Alok's parents. In the restaurant things turn awkward when Alok's father gets Indu and Alok to mention each other's best qualities, with Alok saying that Indu is better than him in every way. Later in private, Indu confronts Alok about telling his parents about their break-up and her drinking. She asks Alok why he isn't able to find a steady job, or why he chooses to do random jobs despite having been a gold medallist at college. She leaves abruptly, calling later to apologise to Alok's parents. As they head back home, we see flashbacks to Alok and Indu's last fight, where Indu confronts Alok about not showing up for interviews or leaving jobs half-way. She tells him she has read his emails in an attempt to understand Alok's behaviour and knows that Alok lied to them about why he quit his year-long internship in Boston. She asks him what he's afraid of. Alok, upset and angry at Indu for reading his emails asks her to get out of his house.\nIn the present day, Alok's parents are preparing for guests to arrive. Alok has completely forgotten that it is his parents' anniversary. When he goes upstairs to fetch his father, Alok catches him listening to an old recording of him talking about Indu. Alok wants to know why his father has been taking Indu's side. Alok's father explains to him that he had seen Alok struggle with fear of failure after his MBA, but was certain that Indu would help him get through it. He explains to Alok that Indu has simply been trying to get Alok out of his comfort zone, but Alok never gave her a chance. Alok realises his mistake and rushes to Indu's house and apologises for the way he treated her. Indu forgives him.

The obsessive-compulsive\u2014who seeks balance in life, and considers his case-solving ability to see a lie amid truth to be a curse \u2014 wants to rest in Istanbul, but must return to London for another case. His friend Bouc, director of the Simplon-route Orient Express service, arranges a bunk for him aboard the train. The other passengers include: American widow Caroline Hubbard, American businessman Edward Ratchett, with his English manservant Edward Masterman and secretary/translator Hector MacQueen; elderly Russian Princess Natalia Dragomiroff and her German maid Hildegarde Schmidt; Hungarian diplomat Count Rudolf Andrenyi and his wife Elena; physician John Arbuthnot; Mary Debenham, a governess; Pilar Estravados, a Spanish missionary; Cuban-American car salesman Biniamino Marquez; and Gerhard Hardman, an Austrian university professor.\nRatchett offers to hire Poirot as his bodyguard during the three-day journey, having received threatening letters from an unknown party, but Poirot refuses. That night, Poirot hears strange noises coming from Ratchett's compartment, and later sees someone in a red kimono running down the hallway. An avalanche derails the train's engine, stranding the passengers.\nThe next morning, Poirot discovers Ratchett was murdered during the night after having been stabbed a dozen times. Poirot and Bouc investigate the other passengers as repairs begin. Evidence indicates that Ratchett was murdered by one person, and Mrs Hubbard claims that a man had been in her compartment in the night. Poirot discovers a partially burned note connecting Ratchett to the kidnapping of Daisy Armstrong, a child who was abducted from her bedroom and held for ransom. Though the family paid the ransom, Daisy was murdered nonetheless. Ratchett's true identity is revealed: he was John Cassetti, Daisy's kidnapper and murderer. The shock of her death caused her mother, Sonia, to die after giving premature birth to a stillborn baby; her father, Colonel John Armstrong, then attempted suicide. The family's nursemaid Susanne was wrongly suspected of complicity, leading to her being arrested and subsequent suicide in police custody, only to be posthumously exonerated.\nMore evidence is found, including a bloodstained handkerchief, and, in Mrs Hubbard's compartment, the button of a conductor's uniform. The uniform is later found, as is the red kimono \u2014 in Poirot's own suitcase. Hubbard is suddenly stabbed, non-fatally, in the back but cannot identify the culprit. Poirot discovers many of the passengers have direct connections to the Armstrong family and uncovers their hidden pasts. While interviewing Debenham, Poirot is shot in the shoulder by Dr Arbuthnot, who claims responsibility for the murder, but Bouc stops him from killing Poirot. Poirot realises that Arbuthnot, a former army sniper, never meant to kill him.\nPoirot confronts the suspects outside the train, offering two theories of how Cassetti died. The first is simple but does not meet all of the facts: a murderer disguised as a conductor boarded the train at a previous stop, murdered Cassetti, then fled at the stop as the train left. The second is more complex: with every suspect connected to the Armstrongs, Susanne, or her trial in some way, they all had a motive against Cassetti:\n\nMacQueen's father was the district attorney for the kidnapping case, who was pressured into prosecuting Susanne and sending her to prison, only for his career to be destroyed when the truth was discovered after her suicide\nMasterman, who is terminally ill, was Colonel Armstrong's batman during the war, and later his valet, who also acted as butler to the Armstrong household\nDr Arbuthnot was Colonel Armstrong's comrade and best friend\nCountess Andrenyi (n\u00e9e Goldenberg and real name Helena) was Sonia Armstrong's sister and Daisy's aunt\nCount Andrenyi was Sonia's brother-in-law\nPrincess Dragomiroff was Daisey's godmother, and a friend of her grandmother\nMs Debenham was Sonia's secretary and Daisy's governess\nSchmidt was the Armstrong family's cook\nMarquez was the Armstrong family's chauffeur\nEstravados was Daisy's nurse\nHardman, whose real name is Cyrus and is American, was a former policeman in love with Susanne\nPierre Michel, the train's conductor, was Susanne's brother\nHubbard is revealed to be Linda Arden, a former stage actress and aspiring director, as well as Sonia's mother and Daisy's grandmother.Poirot predicts that they acted together, which Hubbard confirms, admitting that she planned the murder and had recruited everyone else to help her. All the other passengers and Michel took turns stabbing Cassetti. Debenham wore the kimono, and Arbuthnot stabbed Hubbard without endangering her life, to convince Poirot of a lone killer. Poirot challenges the passengers and Michel to shoot him with a confiscated gun to prevent him from exposing their plot; Bouc can lie, but Poirot, obsessed with truth and balance, cannot. Hubbard grabs the gun and attempts suicide, but it is empty; Poirot wanted to see how the suspects would react.\nWith the train back on track, Poirot concludes that justice is impossible in this case, as Cassetti deserved death; for the first time, Poirot will have to live with a lie and imbalance. He presents the lone killer theory to the Yugoslavian police, allowing the others to leave on the train. As he disembarks, a British Army messenger asks him to investigate a death on the Nile.

Now a young man, Philip is left in the care of his godfather Nick Kendall, and learns through correspondence that Ambrose has wed their widowed, distant cousin Rachel in Florence. Later, Ambrose begins sending letters indicating distrust of the medical care he is receiving in Florence.

Nick learns that she drastically has overdrawn her accounts and warns Philip that Rachel was notorious in Florence for her extravagance and lust. Despite this, Philip intends to turn over much of the estate's wealth to Rachel, as soon as he can legally dispose of it after his 25th birthday, as she was left with very little from Ambrose's estate. His birthday arrives, and, when Rachel realizes what he has done for her, she's very grateful. While out in nature, the two have sex.

The main character, Kokone Morikawa, has strange dreams of Heartland while taking naps.  In these dreams, Heartland is a society entirely revolving around cars; the King's castle is a car factory, and his subjects all come to it to make a constant stream of new cars.  His daughter, Ancien (who appears as a younger Kokone), has a \"magic tablet\" computer she uses to give life to various machines: notably, a blue toy dog named Joy, and a motorcycle named Heart.  The king disapproves of Ancien bringing Heart to life, however, and confiscates her tablet and Heart and orders Ancien to be confined to her tower.  Additionally, the society of Heartland is under threat from a gigantic monster of molten metal called the Colossus.  The king builds giant robots to face the Colossus.  Ancien, spying a motorcycle-driving subject of the king's named Peach, decides to ally with him and seek to defeat the Colossus together with him, while the king's chief adviser Bewan plots against the king and Ancien alike.\nIn normal Japan, Kokone is finishing up her school term, considering where to go to college, and reconnecting with old friend Morio who has returned from Tokyo from his first year in college.  Kokone lives with her single father Momotar\u014d; her mother perished in an accident while Kokone was still young, and Kokone complains that her father never told her much about her mother.  Momotar\u014d is an eccentric car mechanic and has a jacket similar to Peach's, a blue stuffed dog, a motorcycle, and a cracked tablet, all similar to the ones seen in Kokone's dreams.  The situation takes a turn for the worse when Momotar\u014d is unceremoniously arrested three days prior to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and accused of stealing the car company Shijima Motors' secrets.  A suited figure who looks identical to the Heartland king's evil adviser visits the Morikawa home, and is overheard to be searching for both the tablet and Kokone.  Via text message from jail, Momotar\u014d warns his daughter not to trust the adviser, who is named Watanabe.  The message includes a picture of a younger Momotar\u014d, his wife, and Watanabe.  With Morio's help, Kokone evades Watanabe and his men and recovers the stolen tablet and bear doll, driving away in the family's motorcycle.  They also discover a business card for Isshin Shijima, the chairman of Shijima Motors, and consider visiting him for help after Kokone is told that her mother, Ikumi, was the daughter of the chairman.  The two take a nap in the motorcycle, visit Heartland where they dream of the motorcycle soaring through the sky, and are surprised to find on waking up that the motorcycle has driven itself to Osaka overnight before running out of gas.  Kokone's attempts to contact her father via the tablet seemingly fail, but surprisingly enough, the \"magic\" seems to work in the real world when a request to the tablet's e-Heart chat for train tickets results in an attendant giving them paid-for Shinkansen tickets to Tokyo.  There, Kokone seeks an audience with the chairman, while Morio learns that mechanics from Shijima Motors were the ones who saw Kokone's message and had bought the tickets for the pair.  The mechanics explain that after the chairman's daughter had a falling out with her father and eloped with Momotar\u014d, they used this chat to keep in contact with Momotar\u014d, who had been continuing his wife's self-driving car programming and research.  Ikumi had run a project researching self-driving car technology years ago, but Ikumi's father, as chairman, refused her proposal at the time.\nKokone has a final dream of Ancien and Peach's adventures, but unlike earlier dreams, Kokone appears as a separate bystander rather than as Ancien.  Ancien seeks to empower one of the giant robots with her magic tablet over the objections of the captain.  While the empowered robot engages with the Colossus, the captain turns off the engines.  Ancien frantically attempts to reignite the engines, but falls off the robot.  Peach keeps her in his grip, but she loses her grasp.  Appearing now as Ikumi (rather than a young Kokone), she swears to help out Peach one last time, then falls to her death and cracks the tablet's glass.  Kokone understands that the bedtime stories she was told as a young girl of \"Ancien and the Magic Tablet\" by her father that she has been dreaming of were actually stories of her mother.  Now, Shijima Motors has changed course and wants to use the once ignored technology to impress the world during the Olympics with self-driving cars, hence Watanabe's frantic hunt for the tablet.  Kokone, prominently carrying Ikumi's old bear doll Joy, finds Chairman Shijima, who talks of his regrets.  The action shifts to Heartland, where Bewan/Watanabe detains Kokone.  He describes his plan to overthrow the King via letting the King's giant robots fail, and then to prominently save the kingdom with his own giant robot.  The King orders Watanabe arrested, while Peach enters the remaining robot to do battle with the Colossus, which Kokone empowers with the tablet.  Watanabe manages to emit a \"curse\" from his cell phone to sabotage the robot, and the kingdom is briefly engulfed in flames.  Regardless, Peach and Kokone are able to prevail over the Colossus, albeit via flying into space and crashing back to Heartland.  In the real world, Kokone and her father Momotar\u014d are now stuck in the rafters of the building while Watanabe is carried off, and Momotar\u014d is holding onto Kokone just as Peach once had for Ancien.  The people beneath, and the self-driving motorcycle Heart, in seeming fulfillment of Ikumi's claim to be there for the family one more time when it is most needed, are able to drag a giant balloon into place; as the family falls, they hit every banner to slow their descent, and survive the fall thanks to the balloon.  A safe Kokone, seeing the company's motto on the banners explains that her name must have been based on the company's motto, a combination of \"heart\" (kokoro) and \"wing\" (hane).\nDuring the credits, scenes of Momotar\u014d and Ikumi's courtship, and the original tests of her software, are shown.", "tmdb_plot": "Japan, 2020, a few days before the opening of the Tokyo Olympics.

Despite her illness, Judy attempts to lead a normal life by attending a Parkinson's support group each week to help manage her disease.

Faced with the apathy of the war-weary Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) security forces, led by Assistant Commandant Aatma Singh (Pankaj Tripathi), and the looming fear of guerrilla attacks by communist insurgents, he tries his best to conduct free and fair voting despite the odds stacked against him.

Later when a foreign reporter turns up at the polling station the CRPF force the villagers from the constituency to turn up to cast their votes. When one of them enters the polling booth, he becomes bewildered by the voting machine and its operation.\nAfter talking to the lot, soon Newton realizes that they have no idea what the election is about. Some thought they would earn money from this, while others asked hopelessly about getting paid sufficiently for their work. He desperately tries to educate them but to no avail. Taking the lead, a frustrated Aatma Singh pushes Newton aside and shames the villagers by telling them that these officers have risked their lives for their vote, and they should not turn them away. He tells them that the voting machine is a toy; there are symbols of elephants, cycles, etc. and they could press any symbol they like (leaving them uneducated about the fact that those symbols represent respective political parties). So while they vote for their favorite symbol, instead of politicians they have never heard about, the foreign reporter gets a good news report about India's democracy.\nNewton wants to sit at the polling booth for the stipulated time but is forced to flee due to a Naxal ambush which he realizes later was staged by the CRPF. On gaining such knowledge, he tries to outrun his escort team back to the polling booth, but gets caught on both sides, and is forcefully taken back to safety. On the way back Newton decides to collect the votes of four villagers who suddenly turn up from deep inside the forest. Aatma Singh is reluctant to let them do so. It is here where the film gives the viewer the conundrum of the situation in war-torn areas, through two men without any rivalry, bent on their duty, yet a stark difference, exposing the conundrum of truth. Taking his duty very seriously, Newton steals Aatma Singh's rifle and holds the officer at gunpoint till the villagers cast their votes. Singh comments out of frustration that he did not want polling to be conducted in an area that was only secured by government forces 6 months ago, mentioning that there are still more landmines than men. He tells Newton that he doesn't want to lose any more troops, especially when the government cannot even supply them with night vision goggles that they have been requesting for 2 years. Newton keeps him at gunpoint even after the voting for the remaining two minutes of his official duty (till 3 pm). The CRPF troops then beat him up out of frustration.\nThe movie concludes with a shot of the area six months later, showing mining activity going on.

The film opens with a supernaturally-powered automaton called a kratt stealing a cow. It drags the cow by its chains and lifts it up in the air, depositing it at the farm of its master, the villager called Raak. Fashioned out of odds, ends, and farm tools, kratts need to be imbued with a soul in order to do their masters' bidding: primarily stealing livestock from other villagers, aside from menial farm labor. Villagers whistle for the devil at a crossroads in order to arrange a deal: their human soul, to buy a soul for their kratt. However, wily villagers such as Raak continually trick the devil by using the sap of three black currants in lieu of blood to sign the devil's contract.\nThe villagers are driven by a need to survive the harsh winter, and resort to all manner of thievery and deceit to accomplish their ends. They steal from one another, and trade their souls for the kratt in order to keep their souls from being stolen, too. They even fool the Plague - first disguised as a blanched young woman crossing the river, then later as a white goat - by wearing pants over their heads to make it think they have two asses, and thus leave them alone. But the Plague cannot be fooled twice, and when it finally assumes a pig form, the village elder makes a pact with the Plague: if it has to kill, then it must leave a young boy and a young girl alive so that the race can go on.\nThe young girl and the young boy are the main characters, Liina and Hans.\nLiina is Raak's daughter: a headstrong young woman whom her penurious father has arranged, in a drunken pub session, to be married to an older, piggish farmer named Endel. But she longs for the local village boy, Hans. He, in turn, is besotted with a young Baroness - the visiting daughter of the local German baron, whom the local Estonians secretly resent, and get their revenge on by stealing food and valuable objects from the estate. The Baroness is afflicted with somnambulism, and must often be guarded so she does not sleepwalk off the manor roof, which she almost does several times.\nHans and Liina try to use mystical powers so that their unrequited love could change into requited love. Liina can transform into a werewolf, and watches Hans as he stares at the Baroness' window at night. Seeing how smitten Hans is with the Baroness, Liina consults the local witch, Minna, who gives her an arrow and tells her to fling it at the Baroness when she looks out her window, saying that the arrow will split the Baroness' skull and spill her brains out. Liina stands watch at the manor one night, and sees the Baroness atop the manor, sleepwalking. She cannot bring herself to kill the Baroness, however; Liina materializes atop the manor and pulls the Baroness back from the edge.\nHans, meanwhile, fashions a kratt out of a snowman and tries to trick the devil with the three black currants. But the devil has wised up to the ruse and forces Hans into trading his own soul in order that his kratt may be imbued with one. Hans tries to use the kratt to bring him the Baroness; however, the kratt sadly replies that it cannot steal humans, only livestock and inanimate things. Hans then consults his kratt about love and romance; the kratt, made out of snow made out of water that has seen many things, enchants Hans with tales of romances it has witnessed through millennia.\nThe witch Minna asks why Liina didn't kill the Baroness; she replies that Hans loves the Baroness, and that he might die of sadness if she died. The witch is revealed to be an old spurned love of Raak, who in spite cast a spell that killed his wife and Liina's mother. But in a rare spirit of forgiveness, Minna confides to Raak her concern over Liina's unrequited feelings. In a last effort to enchant Hans, the witch asks Raak to ask Liina if she can procure a dress the baroness might wear. Luise, the baron's housekeeper, who has been pilfering the old Baroness' garments and other belongings, trades in the old Baroness' last gown for a silver brooch that Liina's forebears had been safeguarding as part of the Raak family treasure.\nThat night, Hans and Liina encounter each other in a dreamlike state in the forest. Liina wears the old Baroness' gown with a veil over her head. Hans does not seem to recognize Liina. He introduces himself and falls to his knees, thinking she is the young Baroness. Raak watches the two from a distance, saying to himself \"Two fools\" before walking away. The pair kneel in silence through the rainy night, and when morning comes, Hans finally kisses Liina through her veil. Ecstatic, Liina walks away, and Hans asks his melting kratt one final question. The kratt replies \"That girl loves you\" before dissolving into a muddy puddle. Hans then finds an expensive ring in the slush - one that had figured in a romantic tale in Venice that the kratt had relayed to Hans via the snowman's liquid memories.\nHans chases after Liina - still thinking she is the Baroness - to propose. Meanwhile, the actual Baroness is shown to have finally sleepwalked off the manor roof the previous night, and died. Liina hears Hans' wagon approaching and removes her veil in happy anticipation. However, the devil appears on Hans' cart, and asks where his kratt is. When Hans replies that it had melted, the devil says \"Then it's time to pay!\", then snaps Hans' neck. Liina chases after the wagon bearing Hans' dead body, as it encounters the funeral procession for the dead young Baroness.\nHans' father, Sander, berates his own kratt while they prepare Hans' body for burial, saying the kratts are burdens on humanity who won't hesitate to cut human throats. The kratt retorts by asking who told humans to make deals with the devil, and chides the father why humans fool the plague and the devil, but don't want to pay with their souls as promised. Sander then replies \"But I have no soul.\"\nAfter Hans' burial, Liina walks into a nearby river and drowns herself.

After dropping off the envelope, the pair go to a local bakery for some coffee. There, they meet Kevin Broadus, who is a mutual friend of both Addison and Phoebe and an employee at the bakery. Once Addison and Phoebe get into their car, Phoebe admits that she is still a virgin, and would like them to lose their virginity together before they leave for college. Addison agrees and the two head to Phoebe's house to have sex. Shortly after they leave, an armed motorcyclist pulls up to the bakery and rushes inside with his gun drawn.\nPhoebe's mother calls to inform her that there was a shooting at the bakery, and that Kevin was killed. Addison heads home, but stops at the bakery, which is now an active crime scene. Addison asks a news cameraman about the shooting, and the cameraman admits that it was most likely due to gang violence. Addison is confused because he believed Kevin was not the kind of person to be involved with a street gang.\nFed up with the authorities' dismissive claims about the shooting and his school's eagerness to forget about it, Addison starts his own investigation into Kevin's murder. He starts putting up posters around the school, asking anyone to call if they have more information about the shooting. Addison also steals Kevin's file from the school records, where he and Phoebe learn that Kevin was seeing the counselor because he seemed emotionally detached and distant. While at lunch one day, a student who was at the bakery the day Kevin was killed reveals that the shooter was white, and not black like the original police report said.

Addison delivers the drugs to a large mansion that belongs to Phoebe's friend Alex. After delivering the drugs, Addison receives the name of the man who was present at the nightclub, Mike Lorinner.\nAddison calls Phoebe and tells her about Mike, and she implores Addison to call the police and let them handle the situation. Addison ignores her and arrives at Lorinner's house. Addison sets up a video camera to record the confrontation. When Lorinner opens the door, Addison questions him about the night at the club. He tells Addison to leave, but further presses him about how he found him. At the same time that Lorinner notices the red \"record\" light coming from the camera, Addison notices the same motorcycle that the shooter was reportedly riding. Lorinner holds Addison at gunpoint, and reveals that the drug dealer that Kevin disrespected was in fact D Cash.

Finding the attention of several great white sharks with chum, passengers are allowed into the cage. When it's Jeff, Megan, and Josh's turn, they enter and a rogue wave capsizes the boat. They are able to escape the cage and reach the surface where a man is dead and bleeding heavily into the water; a girl is holding him and sobbing. As Josh tells her to get out of the bloody water, a shark breaches the surface and pulls them both under. Another passenger a little further away from them calls out and swims for them but is attacked by two great whites.

Nishino's explanation is proven wrong however when he meets Mr. Chang and presents him this time with 100 million yen.

The current clan chairman is an ex-stock-broker Nomura who assumed power of the clan because he was the brother-in-law of the old chairman. Nishino and Nakata have very little respect for him and want to take advantage of the Hanada-Otomo conflict in order to overthrow and eliminate Nomura, blaming it on the Chang organization in the process. Meanwhile, the Sanno clan (absorbed into the Hanabishi clan in the previous film) carefully assesses the situation and tries to take advantage for themselves.\nMr. Chang minimizes the conflict and settles the situation peacefully and wants Otomo to stand down from any retribution he is planning, while Hanada's men try to assassinate Mr. Chang, but fail. Being a former Sanno clan member and personally has conflict with the Hanabishi clan, Otomo decides to avenge the offense to him and Mr. Chang by traveling back to Japan and killing the Hanabishi responsible.\nThe conflict culminates in Otomo seeking out all the Hanabishi responsible and killing them all in insidious ways.  He did all this without Mr. Chang's approval, and consequently, he punishes himself by committing modern seppuku - shooting himself as punishment for his offense towards Mr. Chang, once again demonstrating his honor and loyalty.

He reluctantly marries the tree, which is duly chopped down after the completion of the ceremony. As a result, from that day onward he is haunted by the spirit of a woman named Shashi, who lived in that particular tree and hence claims to now be 'married' to him.\nThe story of Phillauri and Shashi is slowly revealed via the latter's flashbacks. Back in an unspecified time period, Shashi is a bright young woman who never fails to read the works of a poet named Phillauri that is regularly published in a local weekly. Everyone in the village of Phillaur thinks that the poems are written by the singer Roop Lal 'Phillauri', who is the heart-throb of the village. However Roop Lal notices that Shashi, unlike all the other village girls, never comes to hear him sing. When he confronts her and tells her that he is the Phillauri who writes the poetry by narrating one of his famous poems to her, he is shocked when Shashi slaps and insults him. She asks him to use his talent \u2013 of being able to connect with the common man through his songs \u2013 for something important (especially when the struggle for independence is on) and not for frivolous matters. From that day onwards Roop Lal is a changed man, dedicating his life to knowing and understanding the poetry of Phillauri (which it is clear now that he is not the author of), and spreading its message via his beautiful singing to others.\nOn one particular night while Roop Lal is alone at home singing one of Phillauri's poems, Shashi comes to him and reveals that she is the one who writes poetry under the pseudonym of 'Phillauri' (which she can't do openly, being a woman). Subsequently, love blossoms between the two (the poet and the singer who translates her poetry to song and spreads its message far and wide), but Shashi's elder brother (a reputed doctor of the village who brought her up) eventually learns about the affair and intervenes between the lovers. Roop Lal confronts Shashi's brother and admits to having been an alcohol-addicted good-for-nothing who still is not worthy of her, but tells him that he (Roop Lal) is going to Amritsar to record all the songs written by Shashi and will eventually return and ask for her hand in marriage.\nThe very fact that Shashi writes poetry is a revelation to her brother, and as time passes he too reads the poems and starts appreciating her obvious talent. Meanwhile, Roop Lal records the songs in Amritsar (the gramophone record is credited to both) and is paid a handsome fee of three hundred rupees. He immediately sends the entire amount as a money order to Shashi's brother, along with a letter stating his intention to return and marry her on Baisakhi. Shashi's brother, by now convinced of Roop Lal's changed nature and good intentions as well as the deep love between the couple, starts the preparations for her marriage.\nOn the day of the wedding Shashi discovers that she is pregnant, but does not disclose the news to anyone except her close friend Amrit (Nidhi Bisht). She expectantly waits for Roop Lal along with all her relatives and the entire village, but eventually the day ends with him nowhere to be seen on any of the buses from Amritsar. Her brother has to face the intense embarrassment and shame of sending everyone away, and this in turn hurts Shashi so much that she commits suicide (by hanging herself from a tree) due to an overwhelming sense of sadness, despair and betrayal.\nIn the midst of all these flashbacks by Shashi's spirit the parallel storyline in the present continues with Kanan (whose confused ramblings about seeing a ghost naturally no-one believes), ending up in trouble with Anu who feels that he is not really interested in marrying her (which is partially true since he is getting cold feet). In order to clear the misunderstanding Shashi  finally manages to reveal her presence to Anu as well (though Anu still cannot see her), and having heard her entire painful story Anu realises that Shashi's spirit is in fact still stuck on the mortal plane due to her unfulfilled love. At that point Anu's grandmother asks Kanan to say something to his bride, and Shashi prompts him with her poem. Grandma sings a few lines of the same, being her favourite, which as fate would have it is the one Roop Lal recorded. The record label mentions the recording date as 1919, which results in an epiphany for Kanan who immediately takes Anu (with Shashi in tow) to the site of the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, which took place on that very day 98 years ago.\nThe movie ends with Shashi's spirit reuniting finally with her lover Roop Lal's (who was indeed killed in the massacre on the very Baisakhi day he recorded their songs and was to return to marry her). Before they both ascend to heaven Shashi tells Kanan and Anu (who can now see her) to love and cherish each other always, and that is what they promise each other as they embark on a new phase of their very own love story.", "tmdb_plot": "A man is forced to marry a tree to ward off ill-luck that surrounds his love-life which turns into a nightmare when the tree is embodied by a spirit with an unfinished business.", "tmdb_id": "413421", "wiki_id": "49521801"}, {"title": "Phoenix Forgotten", "genres": ["Horror", "Mystery", "Science Fiction"], "wiki_plot": "Sophie Bishop and her boyfriend Dan visit Sophie's parents in Phoenix, Arizona on the 20th anniversary of her older brother Josh's disappearance.

Several strange lights appear in a \"V\" formation over the city before disappearing, followed closely by fighter jets. Josh becomes convinced they have witnessed UFOs, though others remain skeptical. Hoping to find answers to her brother's fate, Sophie begins reviewing all of Josh's saved videotapes.\nIn the tapes, Josh begins investigating the Phoenix Lights with the help of his friends Ashley and Mark. Ashley and Josh interview two astronomers, who theorize that the lights were flares dropped by jets from the nearby Luke Air Force Base. However, Ashley and Josh remain unconvinced. Several days later, more mysterious lights appear over Mesa. Hoping to capture the lights on film and in better quality, Josh, Ashley, and Mark drive to Mesa. Upon arrival, the trio climb a hill on the outskirts of the town before noticing a spotlight in the distance facing sky-ward. Curious, the trio hike toward the spotlight where they find a gathering of Sheriff's Deputies and mysterious men. Josh notices the cars belonging to the men have no license plates. The group is then spotted by the men, forcing them to flee. The next day, Josh plots the apparent course of the lights, determining they will soon appear over an isolated area of the desert. In the present day, Sophie continues to interview multiple parties regarding the trio's disappearance. Only the group's abandoned car and a camera with single tape was discovered. Sophie views the recovered tape, showing the beginning of the group's journey to find the lights and discovering a charred animal corpse.\nAs the tape ends, Sophie refuses to believe Josh did not record the remainder of the trip. She concludes that Josh must have had a second camera. Sophie and Dan visit the local high school, where Ashley was a film editor and would have had access to such equipment. However the film teacher does not have any logs that may have been filled out, leaving Sophie at a dead end. Before departing Phoenix, she interviews her parents who reveal that the strain of Josh's disappearance caused them to divorce. The next night, Sophie receives a call from the teacher, who claims to have found something. She returns to Phoenix and receives a box that had been mailed to the school several years prior before being placed in storage. Sophie and Dan open the box and discover a heavily damaged camera. Dan manages to retrieve the tape from within the camera before watching it with Sophie.\nThe film then cuts to Sophie after having watched the tape, clearly distraught by its contents. She then contacts a Captain at Luke Air Force Base for an interview. Upon arrival however, the Captain appears confrontational with Sophie while Dan waits with the camera in the car. Sophie then returns and claims the Captain ordered her to \"not let the footage get out\". Dan asks Sophie what to do next, with Sophie giving him a look of determination. The film then cuts to the contents of the recovered tape, comprising the remainder of the film.\nThe last film begins moments after Josh, Ashley, and Mark find the charred corpse. The trio continues to hike through the desert and up a hill. Meanwhile, Ashley and Mark appear to grow closer, much to the disdain of Josh. After waiting at the top of a hill for several hours, the trio witness a single light in the distance. The light hovers for several minutes before accelerating along the horizon. The light grows progressively brighter and faster before discharging several, smaller lights. All the lights subsequently vanish. The trio celebrate their recording before hiking back to the vehicle. As night falls, the teens become lost and disoriented. Mark ventures up a hill alone to try and spot the car. After he leaves, Ashley and Josh hear a loud sound in the distance that appears to be getting closer. A bright light then appears behind the hill before passing over them. Mark returns, visibly distressed but apparently unharmed, claiming to have found the car. As they walk back, Mark refuses to disclose what he saw at the top of the hill. The trio then find the car and attempt to return home.\nAs they drive, the light appears behind the car and pursues them. They attempt to flee before the light disables the car and vanishes. Unable to fix the vehicle, the trio hike along the road attempting to get back to town. As they walk, Mark begins showing severe symptoms of an unknown illness, including a nosebleed, fever, and disorientation. Mark then claims to hear voices, before running out into the desert while claiming to see his brother. As Ashley and Josh run after him, the light returns and Mark vanishes without a trace. Ashley begins to panic, while Josh comforts her. The two then notice a house light in the distance and resolve to follow it. Along the way, the two discover more charred animal corpses. In addition, Ashley also begins to show similar symptoms as Mark, including her hair falling out.\nContinuing on, Ashley begins to hear an unknown sound. She then claims to see her father in the distance before running off with Josh following her. As they run, the light returns, causing lightning and high winds around them. Josh then captures the source of the light, revealed to be an alien craft appearing as several concentric, rotating rings. Josh then witnesses Ashley being lifted off the ground before being abducted in a flash of light. The tape then cuts to Josh arriving at the deserted home, still pursued by the alien craft. He attempts to hide inside the house. Meanwhile, the craft causes various appliances to explode and gravitational distortion. Josh begins to scream as the craft removes the roof of the house, then also quickly lifts him off the ground in a flash before the camera cuts out.

Cappadocia, Saint Matthias is dragged in chains by a group of men to be stoned to death. Before the final stone is thrown, lightning begins to crackle overhead.\nIn 1209 A.D. Medieval Ireland, French Cistercian monk Fr\u00e8re Geraldus arrives at a remote monastery with a charter from Pope Innocent III, commanding the monks to undertake a pilgrimage to transport their holiest relic to Rome. The monks reluctantly agree as legend tells that the relic's holy power will destroy any not pure-hearted enough to possess it. A handful of monks set out, including multilingual Brother Ciar\u00e1n and novice Brother Diarmuid, accompanied by a mute laborer. As the group is caught in a rainstorm, the golden reliquary is struck by lightning but shows no damage, further reinforcing the notion of its mystical power.\nIreland, at the time reeling under successive Norman invasions, is a dangerous place; in fear of Gaelic Irish warriors, Geraldus leads several monks to a Norman encampment led by Baron de Merville, who believes that assisting the pilgrims will enable his forgiveness for atrocities committed as a crusader in service of the Church. The monks are disgusted by the violent nature of the soldiers, especially the Baron's son Raymond de Merville, despite Geraldus' claim of their protection being a necessary evil. It is revealed that the reliquary contains not the remains of the apostle Matthias, but rather the stone used to martyr him and that the Pope believes its tremendous power will benefit an upcoming crusade.\nA larger caravan of armed men, led by Raymond, sets out escorting the monks to the boat that awaits them in Waterford. Raymond, speaking French, tells the mute laborer that some of his men recognize him as a former crusader but not from where; only Brother Ciar\u00e1n speaks French, and the rest of the monks are left in the dark. En route, the caravan finds that a necessary bridge has been burned and its guards slaughtered, and Raymond takes most of the soldiers with him to give chase, leaving the monks with a token guard.\nThe monks continue, but are quickly ambushed by a group of Gaelic warriors, who slaughtered the soldiers and several monks. The Mute dives to protect the young Diarmuid, but is stunned by a rock from a sling. As the Gaels make off with the cart bearing the reliquary, the Mute regains consciousness, grabs a sword from a fallen soldier, and kills several of the Gaels, including their chieftain; the rest scatter in fear. The two surviving monks, Diarmuid and the timid Cathal, are astonished until Geraldus claims the Mute's fierce actions as holy wrath on the Gaels for desecrating the reliquary. They choose to follow after the stolen relic, as it is too dangerous to wait for rescue by Raymond's troops.\nThe Mute tracks the stolen cart, finding the reliquary gone; he then spots a Gaelic scout and quietly kills him. They have found the Irish camp, and there are too many men to fight. To their dismay, their leader Brother Ciar\u00e1n is tied hostage to a tree. Diarmuid insists they rescue Ciar\u00e1n, but Geraldus insists that their holy duty is to the relic and not to their comrade; further, that Ciar\u00e1n would surely also say the same. Diarmuid volunteers to after nightfall sneak into the camp and steal the relic, abandoning the ornate golden reliquary to the Gaels.\nAs the Mute and Diarmuid prepare to sneak into the camp, Raymond and his lieutenants appear. They are there for the relic, as they hired the Gaels to murder the pilgrims such that King John of England could claim the relic instead of the Pope. He says that John has become distrustful of his nobles in Ireland, thinking that they are more loyal to their relatives in Normandy and the King of France than himself. During their discussion Diarmuid sneaks to Ciar\u00e1n's side and attempts to cut his bonds; Brother Ciar\u00e1n insists the boy let him go. Ciar\u00e1n, who was driving the cart bearing the reliquary during the ambush, tells Diarmuid that he threw the relic from the cart before he and the cart were taken and that Diarmuid must find the relic and leave him to his fate.\nDevastated, Diarmuid leaves his mentor behind. The monks watch in horror as Raymond discovers the reliquary is empty. Raymond offers Ciar\u00e1n a quick death if he tells where the relic has gone. Ciar\u00e1n refuses and calls out Jesus' name as Raymond brutally kills him with a multi-pronged barb.\nThe monks escape and find the relic near where Brother Ciar\u00e1n threw it. Geraldus fanatically insists that they continue their pilgrimage despite their desperate situation. As dawn breaks and horns sound in the distance, the group sees a fog-shrouded river. Geraldus interprets this as a divine sign, and they race to the river before Raymond and his men can find them. They ford the river, losing their pursuers until Geraldus shouts back insults at Raymond in French. Raymond replies in English, telling the group that Geraldus is such a fanatic that he sent his own father to be burned at the stake for heresy. Diarmuid pulls the relic out of his sack and prays to it. The others join him, and before long, they hear distant chiming.\nThe chime is the bell of a river ferry. Geraldus suggests that the Mute murder the ferrymen to enable their escape, but Brother Cathal barters with pearls he recovered from when they fell loose of the reliquary. The boat takes them almost to the coast, but as the tide is out, the estuary is too shallow to pass. Behind them, Raymond and his men cross into a clearing on the shore. The ferrymen, realizing their own danger, throw their cargo out of the boat, and all push the boat through the shallows. Geraldus, speaking French, convinces the Mute to turn around and buy the pilgrims time to escape, as God will forgive the former Crusader's sins, no matter how great. Diarmuid is crushed and tries to stop the Mute, but Geraldus holds him back as the boat begins to float.\nThe Mute takes on Raymond and his men alone, killing several. Raymond's archer fires at the fleeing boat, killing one of the ferrymen. Raymond engages the bare-chested and winded Mute and ultimately gains the upper hand. Raymond stabs the Mute with his barbed torture prong, asking where he comes from. The Mute responds with his only word of the film: \"Hell.\" The Mute grabs Raymond and bites him in the throat, severing his artery, leaving him twitching on the ground. The Mute stands up, grabs his sword, and advances on the remaining three soldiers.\nOn the boat, Cathal reveals that he was struck with the last arrow in and slumps over. Hearing the clang of swords ashore, Geraldus tells Diarmuid that the holy relic will inspire a thousand men like the Mute to holy violence. In disgust, Diarmuid moves to throw the relic overboard. Geraldus struggles with him and goes overboard with the relic, sinking to the ocean floor.\nThe surviving ferryman asks Diarmuid, \"Where to now?\"; the novice has no answer.", "tmdb_plot": "In 13th century Ireland a group of monks must escort a sacred relic across a landscape fraught with peril.", "tmdb_id": "340442", "wiki_id": "46933348"}, {"title": "The Pirates of Somalia", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "After his graduation from the University of Toronto, journalist Jay Bahadur in vain tries to gain a foothold in the profession.

On their return flight, McNamara tries to convince William B. Macomber that the war is hopeless. However, Ellsberg is disillusioned to hear McNamara continue to publicly argue that the war is both justifiable and winnable. \nWhen Ellsberg gets a job as a contractor for the RAND Corporation, a military policy think-tank with access to classified government information, he copies thousands of pages from a top secret report on the country's extensive interference in Vietnam, which began with the Truman administration. He leaks the report to reporter Neil Sheehan at The New York Times. \nIn 1971, Katharine Graham has been the owner and publisher of The Washington Post for eight years since the suicide of its former publisher (her husband Phil Graham) and the death of its former owner (her father Eugene Meyer). She hopes to financially stabilize the Post by floating it on the stock market. Although Graham lacks journalistic and business experience she strongly believes they can best improve the paper's financial health over the long-term by investing in higher-quality national news. \nGraham appointed the bullish Ben Bradlee as the Post's executive editor as they both feel the paper's provincialism is preventing it from competing with The New York Times. However, she struggles to convince the male-dominated board's key leaders, who dismiss Graham as a former housewife in over her head. The board pushes to remain a regional paper, as a lower-risk strategy works for other publishers. Simultaneously, Graham maintains her pre-Post life as a well-connected D.C. socialite. She and Bradlee frequently clash over her reluctance to publish stories critical of her friends. \nMcNamara, one of Graham's long-time friends, tells her at a dinner party that an \"unflattering\" story about him will be published in The New York Times\u2014another example of the Times scooping the Post in its own backyard. The story is the first of Sheehan's scoops from Ellsberg's documents: an expos\u00e9 of the true origins of the U.S. government's interference in Southeast Asia. \nAs the Post's editors discuss how to pursue the story further, an anonymous woman leaves one hundred pages of the leaked documents on a reporter's desk in the newsroom. Bradlee is ecstatic at a chance to finally get ahead of the Times on a major story. However, a federal district court injunction halts the Times from publishing further articles on the subject, and Graham\u2014concerned about its potential to both open the Post to huge financial and criminal liability, and socially embarrass her\u2014instructs Bradlee that she won't allow the Post to ignore the injunction.\nPost assistant editor Ben Bagdikian tracks down Ellsberg, a former colleague at RAND, as the source. He explains how he copied the documents over years, a few pages each day, and gives Bagdikian over 4,000 pages to take back to D.C. Post reporters pore over the mounds of pages, searching for stories, as their attorneys advise against publishing them lest the Nixon administration file criminal charges. \nGraham confers with McNamara, Bradlee, Parsons, and trusted Post chairman Fritz Beebe as she agonizes over publishing the story. McNamara warns her that she will face social exile in D.C., and that Nixon's revenge on the Post will be merciless. Beebe and Parsons also warn they could lose investors. \nBradlee argues that they have a responsibility to actively seek out risky stories for the public interest. And, if they are successful in court, the Post would emerge as a significant journalistic institution. He also tells her that his own circle of elite D.C. friends (including John F. Kennedy, as revealed in the documents) repeatedly lied to him as well over the years to garner sympathetic coverage; her own friendships with people like McNamara cannot be allowed to influence her decision.\nAfter hearing all sides, Graham gives the go-ahead. However, the situation intensifies immediately after they go to print when the lawyers realize that Bagdikian\u2019s source and Sheehan's is Ellsberg, putting Graham and Bradlee in contempt of court under the terms of the original injunction. This opens them to further liability under the Espionage Act, with a serious risk that Graham has just destroyed both the newspaper and her family's legacy.\nThe Post and Times jointly appear before the Supreme Court to plead their First Amendment rights.

In the year 1928, William and his wife Elizabeth teach and work on their research at the associated Harvard and Radcliffe Colleges. One day, William hires one of his students, Olive Byrne, as a research assistant. Olive aids in the Marstons' work in inventing the lie detector and conducting research on William's DISC theory on human interactions, and the three soon grow close. One after another, tests by the lie detector reveal that they have fallen in love with one another, and all three of them begin to engage in a polyamorous relationship.\nAs word about their unconventional relationship gets out, the Marstons are fired from the university. Olive reveals that she is pregnant and moves in with the Marstons shortly after. The trio decides to build a family together and create a fabrication to keep secret the nature of their relationship. The family settles in a New York suburb, happily together. By 1934, both Elizabeth and Olive bear children by William (Olive has two sons and Elizabeth has one son and one daughter), telling the neighbors that Olive is a widow and taken in by the Marstons. William starts trying to make a living as an author. Elizabeth takes a job as a secretary and becomes the main breadwinner of the family. Olive stays at home and takes care of the kids, occasionally submitting her writing samples to publishers. They raise their four children together, and Elizabeth names her daughter after Olive.\nIn 1940, William stumbles upon a lingerie shop in New York City run by Charles Guyette, who introduces him to fetish art themed comics and photos. The art captures William's imagination as a demonstration of his DISC theory. Elizabeth initially disapproves of the art, but she relents during a presentation wherein Olive tries out an outfit that later would be the prototype for Wonder Woman's costume.\nAfter finding limited work as a writer, Marston comes up with the idea of creating a female Amazonian super-heroine for a comic book. The comic would feature his ideas on DISC theory, drawing inspiration from the Marstons' work on the lie detector as well as Elizabeth and Olive in real life, and intend to support the feminist movement to further equal rights for women through a populist medium. He pitches his ideas to Max Gaines, a publisher at National Periodical Publications, who ultimately accepts the comic and suggests simplifying the female superhero's name to \"Wonder Woman\". Wonder Woman is an instant hit, leading to prosperity for the Marstons/Byrne family. However, one day, their neighbor wanders into their home and witnesses the three of them having sex. This incident leads to their children getting bullied and asked to leave school by the staff. Worried about their children being attacked and ostracized and thinking they have no other choice, Elizabeth reluctantly demands that Olive leave the household with her children. At the same time, the Wonder Woman comic receives accusations of featuring overtly sexual, sadomasochistic, and lesbian imagery that leads to the testimony of the present day.\nLeaving the testimony, William collapses and is rushed to the hospital. Learning that he is dying of cancer, William asks Olive to see him and Elizabeth again, trying to help them reconcile. William persuades Elizabeth to submit to Olive as she should not always dominate in their relationship. The Marstons get on their knees and beg for Olive's forgiveness, and Elizabeth tearfully admits that she cannot live without Olive. She eventually agrees to come back to them.\nEpilogue text reveals that William died in 1947. Elizabeth and Olive continued to live together as a couple for another 38 years until Olive's death in 1985, and Elizabeth lived to be 100. It also notes that sexual imagery disappeared from the Wonder Woman comic after William's death. However, she kept her powers and had conventional superhero adventures. In 1970 she was subject to a reboot and lost her superpowers; she became a crime fighter and boutique owner.

Subash Chandra Bose, founder of the Indian National Army (INA), has become disenchanted with Mahatma Gandhi's Ahimsa (non-violent) movement and desires to fight fire with fire. Recognizing the growing dominance of Imperial Japanese Army in the Indo-China region, the INA allies itself with the Japanese, hoping to ride the wave to Delhi. Indian troops in the British Indian Army are locked in pitched battles with both the INA and its Japanese contingent. In one such skirmish close to the Indo-Burma border, Jemadar Nawab Malik and a group of fellow soldiers are cornered by the Japanese infantry. Running to escape on a barge, he is shot and captured as a prisoner of war. Meanwhile, the INA's top brass desperately seeks finances to replenish its heavy ammunition to aid the charge to Delhi.\nConcurrently in India, Julia a leading film star of the Indian cinema is the star performer of a dance troupe that entertains civilians and armed forces alike through films espousing her daredevilry. Zulfi is her butler, make-up man, and trusted confidant. Her films are produced by Rustom \"Rusi\" Billimoria, a former Indian action film star whose career was cut short when he lost a hand in a film stunt gone wrong. He is now Julia's mentor and the scion of a production house. Billimoria is on friendly terms with the resident British commander Major General David Harding, who encounters a gem-encrusted royal sword belonging to a Maharajah at a gathering hosted by Billimoria. Slighted by the commander's arrogant demeanor, the King endeavours to send the sword to Indo-Burma border, where the INA hopes it can fund its artillery program and drive the British out of India. An opportunity arises when Harding proposes dispatching Julia and her troupe to the war-torn border where he hopes to raise the sagging morale of his troops through her shows. When Billimoria and Julia (who are now in a relationship) object, Harding promises top-grade security and coerces them by threatening to block supplies of film stock from England, as Nazi Germany has stopped shipments. Billimoria's affair with Julia causes rifts in his family, with his wife demanding a divorce and his grandfather concocting a ruse to prevent Billimoria accompanying Julia on the tour.\nOn board the train, Jemadar Malik, who has apparently escaped as a prisoner of war, is assigned as security detail to Julia, much to her chagrin. Crossing a river, the full complement of passengers and boatmen come under fierce Japanese aerial attack, resulting in numerous casualties. The British assume Julia has fallen, but she has survived and is accosted by three Japanese soldiers. Malik, who has also escaped unscathed, arrives in time to save her from being killed and in the process, captures one Japanese soldier Hiromichi as a hostage to lead them back to the Indian border. Through the rain-drenched jungle and a war-zone swarming with enemy platoons, Julia, Malik, and Hiromichi march slowly to their destination. Combing an anti-aircraft bunker, they barely escape a booby trap, with Malik furious at Hiromichi for leading them into an ambush. As Julia's gentleness and compassion counteracts against Malik's battle-hardened cynicism and aggression, the two fall in love, despite the overwhelming realisation their journey will be over when Julia is reunited with Billimoria.\nBack in India, Harding again proposes that Julia, now engaged to Billimoria, be dispatched to the front-lines, with anti-aircraft gun protection this time. Julia continues to exhibit feelings for Malik: she endorses him for the prestigious Victoria Cross medal and deliberately forces him to volunteer for a stage show. Billimoria begins to have suspicions about her behaviour, which are confirmed after one surreptitious and passionate episode between Malik and Julia during an air-raid. Desiring vengeance, Billimoria volunteers as a stage hand on Julia's next show and after a tense routine, indirectly reveals that he is aware of her infidelity and ready to engage in a fight-to-the-finish with Malik. Meanwhile, Zulfi, who has also survived the earlier raid and is in reality a spy for the INA, has been entrusted to take the sword back to the INA by Mema, an INA agent in the British ranks, and Malik. It is then revealed that Malik did not escape his captivity in Rangoon but was freed by the INA who enlightened him about the evils of British rule in India, thereby enlisting him in the Gandhi regiment of the INA. Convinced of the cause and endowed with a fresh purpose, Malik clandestinely meets Julia before a show and delivers final instructions to Zulfi, who takes up a position outside her tent. Major Williams racially insults Zulfi after trying to forcibly enter Julia's tent to make her begin the show. Infuriated and inebriated, Zulfi hurls derogatory threats to the British on the radio during Julia's show. The outburst is heard by Billimoria, Harding, and other British soldiers, who rush to uncover the offensive culprit. Zulfi pleads guilty in Julia's presence on the stage but is shot dead by Williams, while Harding discovers Zulfi possessed a British Army officer's pistol. Distraught, Julia protests Billimoria's decision to not give Zulfi a proper burial as another member of Julia's troupe covertly abets Malik in a show of weapon check. As night falls, amid torrential downpour, Julia and Malik give Zulfi a proper burial, musing over loyalties and motivations.\nDuring an attempt to arrange a rendezvous for transferring the sword with the INA via a letter, Malik and Mema are caught by Julia, who accuses Malik of betrayal. Torn between his feelings for her and his cause, Malik retorts by saying Julia is blinded by what she sees and the truth is lost on her. The letter reaches the INA, but Mema is trapped by the British while relaying messages. Next day, Harding blackmails Mema into revealing her co-conspirators by threatening to kill her son, at which point Malik discloses his true allegiance. Singing the INA anthem, Malik marches up defiantly to Harding, who signals Williams to shoot Mema dead. Enraged at this callous attitude, Malik lunges at Williams, but is captured and tortured by his former comrades. Horrified at this sequence of events, Julia turns a new leaf: she extracts Malik from a train bound for Delhi and resumes Zulfi's journey in getting the sword to the INA. At the bridge where the sword is to be handed over, Malik and Julia are cornered by the British. Malik convinces Julia to cross the bridge by covering her. In the ensuing gunfight, Malik is seriously injured by mortar fire while Billimoria arrives with British reinforcements. Harding tries to dissuade Julia from crossing the bridge with another false promise, but the mortally wounded Malik defies him by walking across the bridge and sacrifices his own life so that Julia can continue. Harding orders the bridge be blown up, causing grave injuries to Julia. Seeking to redeem himself, Billimoria asks Julia for her last wish, who appeals that he continue her task of delivering the sword to the INA before falling to her death. Unsheathing the shining sword, Billimoria massacres the rest of the British troops on the bridge, decapitates Harding, and walking on the rope delivers the sword to the INA.

He later wakes up in a jail cell wearing tattered fatigues and unaware of anything but memories of intense pain. He meets Nadia (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe), a French foreign aid military doctor in the adjacent cell who tells him he \"sounds American\" and they were taken prisoner by a gang of xenophobic thugs. She calls him \"Bo\" after seeing the letters on his torn name tag. Nadia explains to Bo that the world had been invaded by alien machines which wiped out all the major cities and now systematically hunt down survivors.\nAfter escaping the jail cell, Bo decides to make his way to a U.S. military base somewhere near Nairobi. Nadia unenthusiastically joins him. Bo only recalls fragments of what happened to him while discovering his ability to absorb, conduct, and discharge electricity. Upon escaping attacking Kenyan soldiers who believe America must be controlling the \"drones\" since the enormous satellite dishes at the US base are still intact while everything else is destroyed. Bo and Nadia are captured by soldiers who use them as human bait for a failed machine killing operation. At the mercy of three machines, Bo and a hidden Nadia are inexplicably spared while the machines pursue a fleeing soldier on a motorcycle. Bo and Nadia encounter a fatally wounded photojournalist (Jason Flemyng). The photojournalist passes on his camera to Bo telling him to follow the photos (\"digital breadcrumbs\") as a way to the U.S. military base, which he had encountered and photographed on his journey. The camera proves to be useful until its batteries die.\nBo and Nadia resume their journey to the US base. While in an open field, they see an army of machines heading their way. Bo and Nadia enter a solitary dwelling in the field and flee to the basement, where they embrace and await their demise. In the following scene, Bo is alone and injured, as he staggers to the military base, only to find it in ruins. He sets out to Nairobi, but collapses from his wounds. Saved by a group of Nairobi resistance fighters, he is nursed to health in an underground command center. His story, that his life had been spared but that Nadia had been taken by the alien machines, is met with skepticism. Bo is taken to Roderick (Wandile Molebatsi), who reveals that the aliens gather humans together and transport them to a hovering mothership, and when that happens, the mothership might be vulnerable to attack.\nRoderick reveals a plan to detonate an EMP bomb near the mothership in order to bring it down and hopefully deactivate the machines it powers or controls. Bo observes Roderick's collection of sketches of the invaders, and upon viewing one drawing that depicts a machine holding a captive in the air, he remembers that he too had been seized by a machine and implanted with a device in his spine, which had caused the amnesia and also gifted him with his electrical abilities. Resistance scouts reveal the machines have returned in force. Bo is likely a beacon for the invaders, kept alive for the purpose of finding fellow humans for the machines to kill or take captive. Angry resistance fighters threaten to kill Bo then and there, and he offers to leave to draw away the invading machines. However, as the machines already know the location of the underground bunker of the resistance, the inhabitants are forced to evacuate. Bo offers to help Roderick take the EMP bomb to the alien mothership through service tunnels.\nJoined by a team of resistance fighters, Bo and Roderick carry the device through the tunnels and are attacked by infiltrating machines. They arrive at a location where the machines are herding humans and slaughtering those who try to escape. Bo attacks one of the machines in the ring surrounding the group of humans, and the opening creates an opportunity for the captive humans to flee while giving the resistance a chance to push the EMP bomb beneath the mothership. Although the power source of the bomb is damaged in the ensuing melee, Bo is able to use his own body as a conduit for electricity to power the bomb and detonate the device, which destroys the mothership and depowers the machines in Nairobi.

His career has progressed to the point where he keeps a major studio operating with multiple students and many models constantly in the studio as he progresses on his current projects. Though a significant success artistically, Rodin's personal life has suffered setbacks. His relationship with his wife has become colder over the years and Rodin takes up a relationship with a younger female sculptor who fills an emotional emptiness which he experiences with his wife.\nRodin goes to visit Honore Balzac to discuss making a life-size sculpture of the prominent French author. His original conception is to see the author as a primal literary figure whom he envisions as standing in a heroic posture and in the nude. As his conceptual drawings for the sculpture progress, Rodin then takes up the preliminary design of the molding structures which will support the sculpture which will grow to its full size as it progresses toward completion. Rodin does not have the benefit of Balzac as a live model for the sculpture and relies on a pregnant model posing in the nude in the heroic pose which Rodin wished to use for the sculpture. Rodin uses the increased mass of the pregnancy to mimick the somewhat oversized girth which Balzac's overweight figure obtained in older age. Meanwhile, his female sculpture assistant, Camille Claudel, confronts him about the prospects of their relationship which has become explicitly intimate, and Rodin tells her that she occupies an unrivaled place in his affections. She confronts him in order for him to sign a paper stating his intentions to leave his wife and marry her which Rodin agrees to do and signs before her eyes.\nRodin's wife is conscious of the fact that her husband is less than faithful and that their relationship has grown colder with the years and with her rapidly diminishing attractiveness and loss of youth. Rodin is uncommunicative about the issue and feels that he should live as if in an open marriage. He continues his relationship with the female sculptor and his wife begins to gather information about his mistress apparently with a mind to confronting her about the realities of Rodin's personal life and family. When the Balzac statue reaches its subsequent stages of completion, Rodin calls the commissioning parties to do a preliminary review of the statue. Their response is unanimously negative and stark in its disapproval. Before them they see an oversized and almost grotesquely obese version of the celebrated French author. The commissioning parties are especially disturbed by the prominently featured male organs which Rodin spent special effort to prominently display. There is no question left in the mind of the reviewers that the statue is to be fully rejected as both poorly conceived by Balzac and poorly executed. Balzac is deeply disturbed by the review though he remains silent through much of the criticism.\nHis wife has discovered the address of where Balzac's female sculptor friend is staying and goes to confront her. The meeting sours very quickly with verbal animosity overcoming both the wife and the mistress as they try to face each other down. They part company in a high state of distress, and Rodin's mistress then later confronts Rodin about his promises to her about starting a new life with her and leaving his wife. Rodin contemplates for a further moment and states that an ultimatum at this time does not work him or for his career and he decides that they must part ways. Although Rodin remains profligate in his sexual openness with his other models, he still nonetheless at least partially reconciles with his wife and the two continue to make their home together.\nRodin's contemplation about the Balzac statue has been ponderous and one day in his studio he gets help from one of his students to immerse an oversized men's overcoat into a clay bath in order to fully drench it in the wet composite of clay in order to prepare its application. Rodin decides that he will apply the wet clay overcoat by draping over the shoulders of the nude Balzac statue, thereby covering the original nudity of the preliminary pose of the statue and fully covering over the nude male organs which had offended the commissioning parties at the time of the first review. He allows the draped coat to dry and the completed statue takes its final form which he keeps in his country garden in his home outside of town away from his studio.

In his two-partner office, Israel is responsible for preparing briefs, often focusing on the civil rights of their defendants, while William Jackson, the firm's founder and a well-respected professor, focuses on the courtroom appearances that Israel struggles with. Israel has spent years developing a brief that he believes will bring reform to the unfair use of plea bargaining to induce guilty pleas in the justice system. Though short on social skills, Israel is gifted with a phenomenal memory as well as strong personal convictions, which he has pursued at the expense of family.\nJackson suffers a fatal heart attack. The firm is broke and will close, all to be handled by Jackson's former student, George Pierce. Pierce, who greatly admired Jackson and is impressed by Israel's legal mind, offers a job at his own large firm. Israel initially rejects this offer, believing that Pierce is simply a greedy lawyer. Israel meets Maya during a job interview at a local activist network. The interview does not go well, but Maya asks him to speak at an upcoming meeting organizing a protest. Struggling to find a job elsewhere, Israel reluctantly takes up Pierce's job offer.\nIsrael is a poor fit at his new firm, clashing with senior partner Jesse Salinas over a joke Salinas makes about battered women. After attempting to interest Pierce in his brief, Israel is disappointed to be assigned to handle clients. One such client is Derrell Ellerbee, a young man arrested for murder, who tells Israel that he is willing to divulge the whereabouts of the actual shooter, Carter \"CJ\" Johnson, and will testify against him. Israel goes behind Pierce's back to negotiate a plea deal with the district attorney. The prosecutor rejects his offer and hangs up on Israel after he insults her unsympathetic counter-offer. As a consequence, Ellerbee is also denied the protective custody he begged for in prison and is murdered as a snitch.\nOn the same evening, Israel is berated by Pierce for mishandling of Ellerbee's case, then is mugged by a homeless man he attempted to help. He becomes downcast and cynical, illegally using the information he received from Ellerbee to anonymously collect the $100,000 reward for Johnson's location. Israel indulges in luxuries he had previously eschewed. Pierce apologizes to Israel for berating him earlier and for forcing him out of the shadows, accepting that he thrives working behind the scenes as he did at his old firm. Maya calls Israel to ask him out on a date, where she shares some of her struggles with idealism and thanks Israel for his inspiring her. Pierce invites Israel to a luxury box, where he shares some of his big plans for their future at the firm.\nPierce calls Israel to meet a new client arrested for murder. Before the meeting, Pierce resumes the conversation from the game stating that Israel's dedication to justice has touched him, and that he is reorganizing the firm to take on pro bono cases handled by Israel. Pierce offers to work with Israel on his brief. Israel, still a bit despondent, is unmoved by these developments. They go in to see the client, who turns out to be Johnson. Meeting Israel in jail, Johnson accuses him of divulging privileged communications to collect the reward money, and resolves to torment Israel with the threat of jail time or death. Israel suffers a breakdown in which he becomes a law unto himself becoming both the lawyer and the defendant in one and judges his own actions as unlawful. Renouncing his momentary transgression, Israel goes home and returns the reward money with a note apologizing for taking it in the first place. He reconciles with Maya and Pierce, and tries to motivate them to pursue their inner sense of justice. He tells Pierce that he is turning himself in to the police for his crime. As Israel starts walking to a nearby station, he is shot and killed by one of Johnson's henchmen.\nIn the aftermath, Maya is seen to be renewed in her activism efforts, while Pierce files Israel's brief, in both their names, intent on continuing his efforts to reform the justice system.", "tmdb_plot": "Hard-nosed liberal lawyer Roman J.

Velma exposes Rafe of being the co-conspirator and he is caught in a lasso, where he explains his motive is buying up all the land to sell it at great profit to another company.

Hideyoshi unifies most of Japan and takes the title of taik\u014d, but also grows erratic in his old age: He orders a series of expensive invasions of Korea to expand his holdings but his armies are defeated and most of his vassals are almost bankrupted. In 1595, after he fathers a son, Hideyori, following years of being unable to conceive, Toyotomi orders the execution of his previously appointed heir and his entire family, under the pretext of treason, so his biological son can be his new heir. Dismayed at this unjust act, Mitsunari pleads for mercy, but fails to move Hideyoshi's heart. \nAfter the maids of one of the condemned women attack Ishida and his men during the execution, Mitsunari is impressed by their loyalty to their lady and spares them, even recruiting one of them, a woman called Hatsume, to serve him as a spy. After the execution, Mitsunari also meets Shima Sakon, a ronin who had caused a disturbance prior to the beheadings and who was once an incredibly respected general. Mitsunari offers Sakon half of his earnings if he'll serve him as a samurai, but Sakon initially turns him down, since he loathes Mitsunari's master, Toyotomi. During dinner with Sakon and his wife, Hanano, Mitsunari convinces Sakon to join him by promising that, after Toyotomi dies, he'll help Toyotomi's son govern the country more fairly and wisely than his father.\nIntrigues continue at court as Hideyoshi grows ill and weak. Mitsunari and his longtime friend, Otani Yoshitsugu, correctly suspect that Tokugawa Ieyasu, the wealthiest lord in the country, will conspire to usurp control away from the Toyotomi Clan after Hideyoshi's death. Tokugawa starts secretly conspiring with his vassals, Honda Tadakatsu and Ii Naomasa, to rise against Mitsunari after Hideyoshi's death, since they suspect he'll try to take control of the Regency Council that will govern until young Hideyori comes of age. After Toyotomi vassal Kobayakawa Hideaki is demoted and has most of his lands confiscated by Hideyoshi for poor conduct in Korea; Tokugawa convinces him that Mitsunari has been turning Hideyoshi against him. He also gains the favor of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake, Hideyoshi's greatly respected personal bodyguards, after sparing them punishment following a drunken brawl. Using bribes and espionage, Hatsume tries to keep Mitsunari informed of Tokugawa's actions, but she is hindered by Tokugawa's spymaster, the White Snake, who uses her influence to stop informants in Kyoto from selling information to Hatsume.\nIn 1598, Hideyoshi succumbs to his illness and Mitsunari orders that his death be covered up until all troops return from Korea, in order to avoid chaos during the retreat. When news of Toyotomi's death is made public and this ruse is revealed, Tokugawa takes it as further proof that Mitsunari intends to take control of the Regency Council. Tokugawa plots to have the Seven Spears bring complaints against Mitsunari to the Regency Council, accusing him of trying to usurp Hideyori, but Mitsunari learns of this through Hatsume and he pre-empts them by having one of his allies bring complaints against the Seven Spears of acting insubordinate during the Korean war. Just as conflict appears inevitable, a temporary truce is established due to the intervention of Maeda Toshiie, a respected lord who is friends with both Tokugawa and Mitsunari.\nOne year later, Maeda dies and the Seven Spears plot to assassinate Mitsunari, so he is forced to flee back to his castle in Sawayama. Before departing, he professes his love for Hatsume, telling her that he cannot be with her because he is already married, but that she is nonetheless the person he loves most. However, after a mission to secretly deliver messages to a severely-ill Otani, Hatsume is ambushed on the road by assassins sent by the White Snake, is captured and sold into slavery. \nMitsunari forges an alliance with Tokugawa's old rival, Uesugi Kagekatsu, and both declare war on Tokugawa, accusing him of being a usurper. Uesugi's men invade Tokugawa's home province, forcing him to march against them. In the meantime, Mitsunari's forces try to take hostages out of the families of lords living in Osaka, but one such attempted hostage-taking ends in the entire Hosokawa family killing themselves and setting fire to their home. Guilt-ridden, Mitsunari orders that no more hostages be taken and then he begins to mobilize his army, joined by Otani, Sakon and Kobayakawa, the latter of whom is a double agent for Tokugawa. Elsewhere, Hatsume escapes from her captors and begins to travel towards Sekigahara, anticipating Mitsunari and Tokugawa's armies will meet there.\nOn October 21st of 1600, battle commences in Sekigahara. Sakon leads a small elite force against Kuroda Nagamasa's Tokugawa vanguard; driving them back but getting shot in the process, which forces him to cede command and retreat to the battlefield clinic which his wife runs. One of Mitsunari's ninja attempts to assassinate Tokugawa at his camp, but he is stopped by White Snake, and both die fighting each other. As the battle is in the balance, a hesitant Kobayakawa is pressured by Tokugawa's emissaries into going through with his pre-planned betrayal of Mitsunari. After the order is given, Kobayakawa tries to rescind it and instead attack Tokugawa, but Tokugawa's emissary prevents him from changing his orders. Kobayakawa's troops turn against Mitsunari's, making a surprise attack against Otani's battalions and killing him in the process. The resulting panic sparks chaos in Mitsunari's army and allows the Tokugawa forces to break their lines and rout them, winning the battle. Mitsunari declines to commit suicide, and instead flees after ensuring that Sakon, Hanano and the wounded from her field hospital have escaped.\nMitsunari spends some time in hiding before eventually surrendering to Tokugawa's troops. While imprisoned, he is visited by a grief-stricken Kobayakawa, who regrets having turned on him. Mitsunari forgives him and tells him to go along with Tokugawa now, since it is too late to save him and thus Kobayakawa should preserve himself. The day prior to Mitsunari's execution, Tokugawa meets with him, but neither man says anything to each other. En route to the site of his execution, Mitsunari sees Hatsume, who has finally found him once more. As he and his captors pass her, she mouthes the motto of his clan to him: \"If one gives oneself for all, the world will prosper\".", "tmdb_plot": "The background to and depiction of a watershed battle in Japanese history, at Sekigahara in 1600, when Tokugawa Ieyasu's Army of the East defeated the Army of the West of Ishida Mitsunari.

To his surprise she has left him \u00a3500 and a diary, which is still with Veronica.\nIn flashback, we see that Tony's Sixth Form classmate, Robson, died from what many believed to be suicide after his girlfriend became pregnant. Tony's friend, the highly intelligent Adrian Finn, told their history teacher that in the absence of documentary evidence nobody will ever know the true reason for his suicide. Later, at the University of Bristol, Tony met Veronica, who introduced him to photography as a hobby. On a visit to her family, Veronica's attractive mother Sarah flirted with him but warned him \"not to let Veronica get away with too much\".  As Tony left, Sarah gave him a horizontal wave at waist level. Tony was unsure if it was a flirtatious goodbye or a warning signal.\nVeronica later broke up with Tony, having never had full sexual intercourse with him - until after their breakup. He received a letter from Adrian requesting his blessing for his new relationship with Veronica. At first he decided to respond positively, but then wrote an angry reply, writing of her being damaged and how even her mother had warned him about her, and wishing they would have a child which would pay for its parents' sins. He never heard back from either of them. Tony's two best friends from Sixth Form later informed him that Adrian, who had seemed happy and in love at first, had committed suicide. Tony believed that Veronica could have met Adrian through her brother Jack, who like Adrian studied at the University of Cambridge (but had previously told Tony he did not know Adrian), but they pointed out that Adrian and Veronica met through Tony.\nIn the present day, Tony tells his ex-wife Margaret about his relationship with Veronica for the first time. Tony reconnects with his two Sixth Form friends and they help him locate Veronica online. She is still angry at him, has burned Adrian's diary, which might have explained why he committed suicide, but hands him the angry letter he had written to her and Adrian.

Fin and April discover an ancient mechanism that causes the pyramids to open up and absorb the energy of the vortex upon its activation, seemingly ending the outbreak.

She begins undressing, seducing Chris, who is confused because he believes she would hate him for his part in the death of her son. Judge Dawkins bursts into the hotel room, anxious to retrieve the tape. Steph provokes Chris into attacking Dawkins, who kills him. With both the murder and the tape used to pressure him, Steph forces him to hold the money for Ed. At his house, Dawkins breaks down, crying, and tells his wife that he always intended to be a better husband to her.\nAndy, Chris, and Ed (whose \"State Champs\" tattoo is revealed) plan the robbery on Tuesday despite Steph's attempts to talk them out of it. After an argument over Ed's involvement in their son's death, Ed says the heist is the only way for them to escape their current life. Dawkins, who owns the bank, reluctantly gives the safe's combination to Ed in return for Ed's promise to give him the tape. After loading the bank's vault with money, Dawkins thanks Zeke for personally watching it overnight. Before leaving, Dawkins suggests that Zeke kill anyone who attempts to rob it instead of arresting them. As Zeke reads a book, Ed and Andy break into the bank and take Zeke hostage. Once Ed has the situation under control, Andy leaves to watch the door and Ed opens the vault. Zeke wounds Ed with a gun hidden in the paper bag that holds his dinner and Steph and he  reveal that they are the parents of the dead child, before killing Ed. It becomes clear Steph and Zeke, who we see has the same arm tattoo, planned to kill everyone responsible for their child's death.  Zeke asks Steph to shoot him in the arm (which has been numbed).

Libby's most strained relationship is with her mother, who claims she is too busy for such basic activities as taking her to the park, and whose physical affection Libby rejects.\nTaken aback at Libby's lack of familial interaction, and wishing to help the child diversify her forms of communication, Joanne teaches Libby British Sign Language. They take trips to the park and garden, play sardines and eat sweets, all in BSL. Libby, who quickly gains a proficiency of BSL, soon adores Joanne, with whom she can communicate.

In the meantime, Praful decides to go with her cousin on a trip to Las Vegas (her cousin pays for all tickets and accommodations).\nIn Las Vegas, she plays baccarat for the first time and wins big in her first few rounds. She quickly gets addicted to the game. The next day, she returns to the casino but ends up losing not only the money she won the previous day but a large chunk of her savings also.\nPraful then returns to Atlanta after a week, only to find out that her bank application to the bank has been rejected as her credit rating is very low. Praful seeks her father's help but he insists that she should meet a young man named Sameer (Sohum Shah) who has been selected as her suitor.\nAfter meeting with the suitor, she has mixed feelings about marriage and agrees to get engaged. However, her addiction to gambling takes a toll on her and Praful gives her last shot to gambling and goes back to Vegas.\nUnfortunately, she ultimately loses all her savings so a private money lender spots Praful (who is now drunk) in the casino and offers her money. The drunk Praful \u2013 not in her right senses-  takes $32,000 from the moneylender and in exchange gives him her driving license.\nPraful loses all that borrowed money (along with her hard-earned savings) and has to return penniless to her home.\nPraful tries to explain to her father her bad situation and needing his financial help, but in fear of retaliation and hostility, she is reluctant. Her parents want her to begin her wedding preparations and plans with Sameer, who by now gets impressed by her personality.\nAt a relative's wedding, Praful and Sameer meet again and dance, and get to know each other. However, Praful is threatened by the loan sharks to pay within 10 days or face death, so she is disturbed and anxious, unable to concentrate on her wedding plans.\nTherefore, Praful develops the habit of stealing whereby first she disguises herself (wearing oversized sunglasses and a hood) and approaches a cashier at a gas station shop. She collects only $10,000 so she has to go and rob a bank (which she learns how to on YouTube), with a disguise, and hands a note written with red lipstick that says money should be given to her otherwise she will blow the whole bank as she is strapped to a bomb.\nPraful's second robbery gets foiled by a bank manager who bumps into her when she tries to rob the bank similarly. When the manager asks her name, Praful tells her name 'Simran', the name of a popular character from an Indian blockbuster film Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge which her mother ultimately watches often.\nAlthough Praful's plan to rob the bank gets foiled, she manages to escape and similarly robs another bank.\nPraful Patel has now become a most wanted criminal with the name 'Simran \u2013 The Lipstick Bandit'. Despite robbing 3 to 4 banks successfully, Praful is still short of collecting fifty thousand dollars.\nMeanwhile, Praful develops a liking towards Sameer, and confides in him her bad habits of gambling and stealing which he does not take seriously, thinking it is some kind of a joke.

By now, these loan sharks know that Praful is actually 'Simran \u2013 The Lipstick Bandit', so they ask her to rob one more bank and this time with a bigger amount\u2014for which they offer her a gun to finish the job.\nDevastated and dejected, Praful calls off her relationship with Sameer and asks him to leave and by telling him the truth. Enraged by this, Praful's father slaps her and asks her to leave his house.\nPraful leaves her home and stays with her best friend Salma (Esha Tewari) for a night. The next day Praful attacks the same bank that rejected her bank loan and flees the place after stealing the money.\nSameer is still in love with Praful and to help her, he transfers a huge amount of fifty thousand dollars in her bank account.\nPraful, before leaving the city of Atlanta, calls him at a lonely place and tells him that he should find another girl, as he is a nice man and he deserves someone better; not someone like her.\nSameer refuses and asks her to surrender to the police and end this dirty game once and for all; after which Praful's dad calls her and asks for forgiveness. Praful is happy at this and returns home but the police cars have surrounded her and are following her car to arrest her.\nPraful drives off because she did not want to get arrested in her neighbourhood, which is full of Indians, and her parents would be very ashamed of her there. The ultimate chase begins as Praful's car is found empty by the police. Praful had taken a taxi and was almost near the airport, but then she decides to surrender on a lonely highway.

After seeing Duszejko, the police chief meets with Wnetzak, a local businessman, who gives the chief an ultimatum about money the chief owes him.  Duszejko complains to the local priest about the loss of her dogs but she is chastised for being blasphemous to treat animals like humans.

Later, Christian is pulled into a confrontation at a pedestrian zone, after which he notices that his smartphone and wallet are missing, presumably stolen in a confidence trick. Christian is able to track the position of his phone on his computer, which he and his assistant Michael trace to a large apartment block.\nThey write a threatening anonymous letter demanding the return of the phone and wallet by depositing them at a nearby 7-Eleven. Christian throws a copy of the letter in each apartment mailbox that night. Several days later, a package for him is deposited at the store, containing the phone and the completely untouched wallet.\nEuphoric after the success of his plan, Christian goes to a party where he meets Anne again, before ending up in her apartment. After the two have sex, Anne offers to throw away a used condom but he steadfastly refuses to hand it over to her. They argue over the situation, as she believes he does not trust her to dispose of the semen rather than take it. Several days later, Anne meets Christian in the museum and states she is looking for more than casual sex. She asks him if he feels the same, but Christian is evasive. When Anne later tries to call him, he does not pick up the phone.\nThe day after picking up the package, Christian is informed that a second one has arrived for him at the 7-Eleven. Suspicious, he sends Michael to pick it up. In the store, Michael is confronted by a young Arab boy who states that his parents believe that he is a thief because of the letter and demands that Christian apologizes to him and his family. Otherwise, the boy threatens to create \"chaos\" for him.\nLater, the boy visits Christian's home and confronts him, along with his two young daughters, on the staircase. Christian tries to send him away but the boy begins to knock on doors and screaming for help. In a fit of frustration, Christian pushes the boy down the stairs, though no one comes to his aid. Disturbed, Christian desperately searches the trash outside the house for a note which contains the boy's phone number. After finding it and unsuccessfully trying to call him, Christian records an apologetic video message.\nIn the midst of these troubles, Christian has to manage the promotion of a new exhibition centered on an art piece called The Square by Lola Arias, which is described in the artist's statement: \"The Square is a sanctuary of trust and caring. Within it we all share equal rights and obligations.\"\nThe advertising agency commissioned by the museum to promote The Square states that they need to harness social media attention with something other than the uncontroversial and bland artist's statement. Advertising agency representatives consider a depiction of violence contradicting The Square's message, developing a promotional clip showing an impoverished white blond girl entering The Square and being killed in an explosion. The video is published on the museum's website and YouTube channel after a distracted Christian gives his approval without viewing it.\nThe clip goes viral, quickly reaching 300,000 YouTube views, but receives an extremely hostile response from the media, religious leaders and the general public. The museum arranges a press conference, where Christian states he violated protocol and is stepping down as curator in mutual agreement with the board. Several journalists then attack him for stirring up cheap controversy with a tasteless clip, while others attack him for self-censorship because of his resignation.\nFeeling guilty about wronging the boy, Christian drives to the apartment block several days later and tries to find him and his family.

As she approaches the finish line, a bomb goes off right where Jeff is standing. After being rushed to a hospital, both of Jeff's legs are amputated above the knee.

A man enters and asks to be served. When Mitchell tells him to leave because the bar is closed, the man threatens him and angrily leaves. The man returns and shoots Lou, Mitchell, and Tom. The next morning Sam wakes up after dreaming about his former days as a bull rider. He starts his morning at the motel by reading about the shootings in the paper and then responding to a disturbance in room 128. Sam politely and shyly asks the tenant to quiet down, only to have the door shut in his face. Later that day, Tom's wife, Bernadette, goes on the porch during a gathering for her deceased husband and asks Sam if he can come by to no avail. Sam has trouble lifting his right arm and walks with a limp due to injuries suffered from bull riding. Bernadette, ignoring Sam's earlier wish, wakes Sam in the middle of the night for sex to which he obliges. They discuss whether Tom is in heaven or hell and Sam seems regretful of his relationship with Bernadette. Upon leaving the next morning, Bernadette picks up the picture Sam laid down. The photo is of a woman and a young girl.\nLila meets the man who shot Mitchell, her husband, and asks why he killed Tom and Lou instead of only killing Mitchell as planned. Showing no remorse, he blames her for the circumstances because Mitchell didn't leave the bar as she said he would. The man then tells her she should be celebrating because Mitchell has been killed as she wanted. He asks about his payment, and Lila tells him she will have it by the end of the week after she meets with Mitchell's lawyer. Lila tells the man she wanted Mitchell dead because he'd been unfaithful. Upon visiting Mitchell's lawyer, Lila learns that Mitchell was bankrupt, had lied about his life-insurance policies, and was being sued by former business partners. The bank now owns her home and there is no money. Mitchell's killer later approaches Sam at the motel and introduces himself as Elwood. He extends his stay at the motel and begins giving Sam praise as a famous bull rider. He tells Sam that his father was a huge fan of Sam and would have loved to meet him but he's now deceased. Sam befriends Elwood, and they go to a local diner where Sam talks about his health and why he shakes. Sam seems puzzled when Elwood tells him about his mother's death and how his father was absent due to incarceration. Elwood says his father died in a prison riot in 1996 and shows a strong disdain for him. Elwood asks Sam if he has a girlfriend, and Sam admits he does. When Lila enters the diner after riding with Bernadette to get milkshakes, Sam calls her over to the table and introduces her to Elwood. Taken aback, she pretends not to know Elwood before quickly leaving. Later that night, on the way home from Bernadette's house, Lila is followed by Elwood but is able to evade him.\nAfter a phone call with his mother, Elwood becomes enraged and instigates a fight with two men. After calling Lila and leaving her a threatening voicemail, he violently beats the two men before leaving. Later that night, Lila receives the threatening voicemail and tries to run away from home, but is attacked by Elwood. He demands payment, and again she tells him she can get the money. Satisfied, he leaves and meets with Paul to enlist his services to do a job to which Paul agrees. Sam leaves Maggie's basketball game to spend the night with Bernadette. Once Sam has left her home, Elwood and Paul approach the house while she is in the bathtub. Hearing a noise, Bernadette goes to investigate and is chased by Paul while Elwood breaks into a wall safe. She stabs and kills Paul and is chased by Elwood. He subdues and nearly shoots Bernadette when he notices Sam's hat on the counter. Elwood takes the money from the safe and leaves. \nUpon returning to the motel, Sam finds a tenant complaining about the noise in room 128. Sam knocks on the door and begins fighting with the tenant. However, his condition prevents him from throwing a punch and he is then overpowered and left lying in the rain. Sam recovers enough to go to Bernadette's home where he learns about the break-in. Elwood, who was injured in the struggle with Bernadette, tries sneaking out the next morning but is stopped by Sam who merely wants to say goodbye. However, Sam notices that Elwood is bleeding and realizes he is the one who robbed Bernadette. Elwood chases Sam into an occupied motel room, shooting the tenant in the process. Elwood searches the room but finds that Sam has escaped through the bathroom window. Sam then runs to the motel office to grab his grandfather's gun and tells Elwood to stay until the police arrive. Elwood refuses claiming that they are \"square\", a reference to him letting Bernadette live. Elwood attempts to get in his car to flee, but Sam shoots and kills him. The police go through Elwood's belongings and find Lila's name and phone number.

The most prominent combat-based game is Ordinal Scale, in which a player's abilities are ranked by ordinal numbers.\nAsuna, Lisbeth and Silica encourage Kirito to play OS upon hearing that Aincrad bosses have appeared. Kirito joins Asuna and Klein in a boss fight against Kagachi the Samurai Lord at Akihabara, where the game's mascot, AI idol singer Yuna, appears and gives players buff effects as she sings. Kirito fails to achieve anything due to lack of real world physical strength and agility. Eiji, the number-two ranked player, aids the group in defeating the boss. Before Asuna makes the killing blow, Eiji whispers the word \"Switch,\" a game mechanic from SAO that she recognizes.\nThe next night, Asuna joins Klein and his group for another boss fight at Yoyogi Park while waiting for their last group member, unaware that he was injured by Eiji the night before. Asuna leaves Klein and his guild behind and proceeds to the fight against the Storm Griffin, which is again presided over by Yuna. Klein and his guild are surprised by the sudden appearance of a second boss, Zanghi the Flame Caller, and shockingly supported by Eiji, who physically attacks and defeats Klein and his entire guild in the real world using superior reflexes and seemingly superhuman strength. When Asuna returns to where she left them, Klein and his guild are nowhere to be seen. The following morning, as Kirito practices with OS in Yoyogi Park, a girl he doesn't know appears in a white hood, mouths something wordlessly and points off into the distance before disappearing. A confused Kirito is surprised by Asuna who has arrived to have lunch with him. While eating together, Asuna theorizes that Eiji was a former member of the Knights of the Blood Oath named Nautilus, while Yui deduces that the spawn locations of the Aincrad bosses line up with the SAO dungeon maps. Noting the absence of Klein, Kirito tries to check up on him.\nAsuna, Lisbeth and Silica join the boss fight against Strict Hermit at Yebisu Garden Place, where Yuna and Eiji appear again. At the same time, Agil contacts Kirito and tells him that Klein has been hospitalized with a broken arm; Kirito, alarmed, rushes to protect Asuna and their friends. During the boss battle, a second boss, Dorz\u2019l the Chaos Drake, suddenly appears and fixates on Silica. Eiji blocks Silica's escape by pushing her into the path of a lethal boss attack, and Asuna is defeated while protecting her; an orange orb materializes from Asuna and is quickly collected by one of the OS drones. After the battle, Asuna begins to suffer memory loss, and goes to the hospital for examination.\nAsuna learns that the Augma device scanned her brain specifically for SAO memories and that the memory loss could worsen. After Asuna's condition worsens, Kirito gains a strong resolve to solve the mystery. Kirito visits Klein in the hospital and confirms that Klein's SAO memories are also missing. Kirito goes to the Dire Tusk boss battle at Tokyo Dome City looking for Eiji, where he is joined by Sinon; although he is concerned for her safety, Sinon reminds Kirito that she is not an SAO survivor. During the boss battle, an SAO survivor is defeated and Kirito witnesses a glowing memory orb being collected by an OS drone. Yui tries to retrieve the memory orb from the drone but fails after being blocked by the OS system. After the battle, Kirito is frustrated that Eiji did not show up, but meets the hooded girl a third time, who repeats her actions from before. Kirito and Yui figure out that she is pointing towards Touto Technical University.\nKirito goes to the university and meets Professor Tetsuhiro Shigemura, who developed Augma. Shigemura refuses to answer any questions. Before leaving, Kirito notices on Shigemura's desk a picture of a girl who resembles Yuna. Kirito talks to Seijir\u014d Kikuoka, who informs him that Shigemura's daughter, Yuna, died in SAO. Kirito warns Kikuoka that the memory loss may be affecting other SAO survivors playing OS. Visiting Asuna's home, Kirito promises Asuna that he will get her memories back. While searching for clues, Kirito encounters the hooded girl yet again, who he confirms is Yuna. When she tells him his rank is too low, Kirito decides to level up hardcore, recklessly chain-soloing as many bosses as he can, and improving his AR swordwork with help from Leafa.\nDays later, the OS players gather at the Tokyo National Stadium for Yuna's first live concert. In the lower levels, Kirito duels with Eiji, who claims he has a way to return Asuna's memories. After Kirito defeats him, Eiji reveals that Shigemura has been harvesting memories of SAO players in an attempt to reconstruct his lost daughter's soul and resurrect her as an AI; having SAO survivors concentrated in one place is the final stage of the plan and Eiji believes he has won. Kirito rushes back upstairs to warn everyone, calling Kikuoka on the way. Kikuoka warns Kirito that all the memory harvesting drones scanning everyone at once could damage the players' brains, killing them like the NerveGear did in SAO.\nAs a horde of Aincrad bosses appear and terrorize the stadium, Kirito and Yuna join the battle. Yuna tells Kirito that the Augma has a hidden full-dive feature and he can use it to defeat SAO's 100th floor boss to stop the scan and save everyone. Before diving, Kirito gives Asuna an engagement ring. Entering the Ruby Palace of Floor 100, Kirito, Lisbeth, Silica, Agil, and Sinon confront the boss. They are easily overwhelmed until Asuna, Leafa, Klein, and several other memorable players from ALO and GGO come to their aid. Yui restores their saved abilities from SAO, allowing everyone to defeat the boss.

Meanwhile, in the real world, Kikuoka finds Shigemura in the abandoned server room of Argus (the defunct company that once ran SAO) and arrests him. The hooded Yuna restores the survivors' memories and fades out of existence since her existence was tied to that of the Floor 100 boss. Afterwards, Kirito and Asuna fulfill the promise they made to each other in Aincrad, to watch a meteor shower together.

Unimpressed, Sick Boy informs Veronika that he plans to take revenge.\nBegbie escapes from prison and returns to his estranged wife June's flat, meeting his college-bound son, Frank Jr., whom he forces to join him in burgling houses after ridiculing his son's choice of studying hotel management instead of committing crimes.

One of Sick Boy's blackmail targets reports him to the police, and Renton seeks legal advice from his ex-girlfriend, Diane Coulston, now a solicitor.

Veronika takes Spud to her apartment and asks him to leave with her, promising him half of the \u00a3100,000. Spud fears he will spend it on heroin again, so she offers to give his share to Gail and Fergus. He helps transfer the money to Veronika's account by forging Renton's and Sick Boy's signatures. After reading another excerpt of Spud's writings about their encounter with Begbie's alcoholic father in the derelict Leith Central railway station, Begbie visits June's flat for the last time, apologising to Frank Jr. for his abuse and telling him that he (Frank Jr.) will be a better man than Begbie and his father were.\nSpud arrives too late at the pub to warn Renton and Sick Boy of Begbie's ploy.

Though Sameera is initially hesitant about another marriage, the two get married before moving to Iraq. \u200cThey along with a group of 19 nurses of same hospital move to Iraq to join Tikrit Teaching College, which is an Iraqi Government Hospital.\nMoving to Iraq, they realize Iraq is no more a peaceful country as projected during interview time, with conflicts rising on daily basis. The doctors are over-strained with rise of casualties. Sameera's knowledge in Arabic helps her to communicate better with Arabic doctors and she leads the nurses' group in their new working environment and challenges. In mean time, she gets pregnant and needs to hide this from her first son, Ibrahim who is about to visit her for vacation. Surprisingly, Faizal also comes along to permanently hand over Ibrahim to Sameera due to issues in his family. Ibrahim finds it hard to accept Shaheed as his new step father and when he realizes that his mom has remarried, he runs out of their quarters only to see the city is now a major riot zone with pro-ISIS supporters uprising against Iraqi Central Government in the city. He is brought back to quarters by Sameera. Shaheed feels that Ibrahim needs some time alone with Sameera to realize the new environment. For this, he offers his assistance to Army medical team moving to Mosul to deal with the local casualties over there. He consoles Sameera that it's a matter of two weeks which is sufficient for Ibrahim to get adjusted to his new realities and the mission is not dangerous as the army is along with them.\nHowever within a day, Mosul falls into hands of ISIS and the medical team is taken into captive. News gets flashed and Sameera pleads with hospital management to help in rescuing her husband. As Iraqi forces retreat from Mosul, the Iraqi government is no longer in position to help. The hospital manager advises Sameera to seek assistance of Indian Embassy in Baghdad. Sameera along with manager visits Embassy where she meets Indian Ambassador Manoj Abraham. They promise assistance but remind them that it's a war zone and Indian Government has its own limitations in intervening.\nWhile Sameera is in Baghdad, Tikrit falls into ISIS hands which they discover while coming back to hospital. ISIS militants kill the manager, while bringing Sameera back to hospital to join with other nurses who are now captives of ISIS. Sameera relays this matter to Indian Embassy and calls out for help, which brings the matter to serious concern of both Indian Government and Kerala Government, as all nurses were from Kerala state.\nIn meantime at Mosul, ISIS terrorists kill the doctor for not complying with them to treat wounded terrorists. Shaheed to save his life, offers medical assistance to wounded ISIS terrorists. Sameera starts informing about the tensed situation at Tikrit through her mobile to Kerala government. The Chief Minister of Kerala along with India's Foreign Affairs Minister starts briefing with the Ambassador. As there is no direct communication or normal diplomatic relationship with ISIS, Indian government has little chances of a formal route to intervene. Indian Government sends its Foreign Secretary to Iraq, who initially thinks that Iraqi Army will help the stranded nurses out of Tikrit. However the Ambassador doesn't join on that and assumes full responsibility to rescue. Meanwhile, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement offers their assistance and a bus is arranged to fetch all stranded nurses out of Tikrit. But, as they need to pass through extreme violent war zones of Mosul, Indian Embassy cancels permission, which results only Indian Nurses stranding in Tikrit, while other nationalities taken out. However the decision of Indian Embassy is proven right when the bus gets caught in a crossfire near Mosul, killing all nurses. With just 19 Indian nurses stranded in Tikrit, ISIS decides to use them as human shields and plan to take them to their key base Mosul. India responds by dropping food packets near hospital, but one packet contains a secret satellite phone with location detector which Sameera take over to correspond with Crisis Command center at Indian Embassy.\nAmbassador Manoj instructs Sameera to destroy all passports and documents that reveal their identity and asked all other nurses to declare themselves as Muslims, as ISIS terrorists might attack non Muslims among them. Sameera teaches all other nurses basic religious things like Namaz and covering the head as well as hiding all religious symbols. Meantime, Kerala Government along with its Foreign affairs agency- NORKA brings in a prominent Malayalee Businessman- Jayamohan of Crescent Group who have close links with Influential Saudi royal member and persuades him to make a deal with ISIS on India's behalf. Jayamohan, after hearing the nurses pleas over their satellite phone, rushes to meet Sheikh Salman, member of royal family, requesting his assistance to intervene with the ISIS . After a prolonged discussion, He agrees to broker on behalf of India unofficially without any record.\nMeanwhile, at Mosul ISIS base, Sameera and nurses are brought before a main cleric, who test them to ensure they all are Muslims. Sameera's knowledge in Arabic, her son's knowledge in Quran and the coordinated Namaaz all help them to believe that the entire nurses are of Muslims and no harm is done. With the Royal's intervention, a secret deal was drawn between India and ISIS. ISIS agrees to transfer the nurses to Erbil near the Kurdistan Check Point. Meanwhile, with Sameera's persistence, she finds out Shaheed among ISIS captives who were about to be executed and with her pleas, she is able to rescue him from there. Sameera, Shaheed, Ibrahim and nurses are brought to Kurdistan from where India take them over in their buses and a special flight is arranged to take them back to Cochin from Erbil.\nAs the movie ends, actual footages of nurses reaching Cochin airport and their narration of experience under ISIS are depicted on the screen with a second climax scene where Jayamohan destroys the documents that reveal the secret deal between India and ISIS, with a voice over that it shall remain as a classified secret of India.", "tmdb_plot": "A group of Malayali nurses stranded in Iraq, must survive their capture by the extremists and reach out to the rescue team headed by the Indian government.", "tmdb_id": "430521", "wiki_id": "53306598"}, {"title": "Take the 10", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "A day in the life of two best friends, a drug dealer, and a store manager collide at a hip-hop concert in the Inland Empire.", "tmdb_plot": "A day in the life of two best friends, a drug dealer, and a store manager collide at a hip-hop concert in the Inland Empire.", "tmdb_id": "433245", "wiki_id": "53245828"}, {"title": "Tamburo", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "The plot revolves around three P\u2019s \u2013 Paisa, Property &  Pyaar.

One day, he overhears another taxi driver talking about a foreign client who has booked him for a trip worth 100,000 won (the Korean equivalent of 100 dollars); the client intends to travel to Gwangju for the day and return to Seoul before curfew. Man-seob rushes off to steal the client.\nThe client is J\u00fcrgen \"Peter\" Hinzpeter, a West German journalist who wishes to report on the increasing civil unrest in Gwangju. Due to strict censorship, foreign reporters are prohibited from entering the country. Peter pretends to be a missionary in order to enter South Korea. Man-seob meets Peter and lures him into his taxi before heading off to Gwangju.\nThe two men discover that all the roads leading to Gwangju are blocked and heavily guarded by soldiers. Man-seob tries to convince Peter that they should return to Seoul, but the latter refuses to pay the 100,000 won unless they reach Gwangju. They manage to enter the city after they lie about Peter being a businessman. In Gwangju, they find that all the shops are closed and the streets are deserted. Man-Seob dismisses the severity of the city's state as he believes that the recent riots were caused by students who only \"go to school to protest\" in part due to the news reporting misinformation. Peter begins to record his observations on his camera, and the two men meet a group of college students who are riding on a pickup truck. The leader of the group, Yong-pyo, invites Peter aboard. They also befriend an English-speaking student, Jae-sik. Man-seob decides to turn back, reluctant to have his taxi damaged in the riots. Along the way, he takes pity on an old woman looking for her son and she leads him to the local hospital. The woman's son turns out to be Yong-pyo, who is in the hospital with minor injuries. Peter and the college students scold Man-seob for his selfishness and refuse to let Peter pay him until he fulfills the agreed upon trip.\nMan-seob agrees to take Peter and Jae-sik (now acting as their translator) through Gwangju. Local protesters welcome the foreign reporter and greet the trio with food and gifts. Peter films violent riots and witnesses soldiers beating protesters. Plainclothed Defense Security Command (DSC) officers (presumed to be the DSC 505th Defense Security Unit) see him filming and move to arrest him, but the three men evade capture. That evening, Man-seob's taxi breaks down and they are met by Tae-soo, one of the local taxi drivers. Tae-soo tows the taxi to his shop for overnight repair. Man-seob becomes distressed as his young daughter is home alone and he is unable to contact her as Gwangju's phone lines have been cut. Tae-soo lets the men stay at his house for the night.\nDuring dinner, they hear an explosion and discover that the television station has been bombed. They head there and Peter films the turmoil. The officers recognize Peter and chase the three men; Jae-sik is captured, but before he is taken away, he yells for Peter to share the footage with the world. Man-seob is assaulted by the leader of the plainclothes DSC officers, who accuses the driver of being a communist. Peter rescues Man-seob and the pair run back to Tae-soo's house.\nAt dawn, Tae-soo gives Man-seob fake Gwangju license plates as the soldiers are now searching for a Seoul taxi. Alone, Man-seob drives to the nearby town of Suncheon, where he overhears reports of the events in Gwangju; the media falsely claims that the chaos was caused by \"rogue groups and rioters\". He is overwhelmed with guilt and drives back to the hospital in Gwangju to find Peter in shock and Tae-soo crying over Jae-sik's corpse. He reminds Peter of his promise to show the world what is happening in South Korea and encourages him to continue filming.\nThey film a street where Airborne Brigade soldiers are mercilessly shooting at civilians. Man-seob and the other taxi drivers use their vehicles to barricade the soldiers from further harming the civilians. The Airborne Brigade soldiers continue shooting, and the two men arrive at a road blocked by 31st Infantry Division soldiers. Man-seob states that he is taking a foreign businessman away from the turmoil. A young soldier, Sergeant First Class Park, searches the car and finds the license plates from Seoul. However, he remains silent on the discovery and lets them go. The soldiers then receive orders through radio not to let any foreigners through. Man-seob breaks through the barricade by force and the soldiers open fire, but Sergeant Park just sits by and watches without firing.\nHowever, DSC officers soon give chase and shoot at them. Man-seob and Peter are rescued by the local taxi drivers, who ram into the military vehicles to distract the soldiers. The taxi drivers are presumably killed in the chase, and Tae-soo ultimately sacrifices himself to allow Man-seob and Peter to escape. The two men make it to the airport, where they bid each other an emotional farewell. Peter asks Man-seob for his name and phone number as he wishes to return to South Korea to visit.

James asks if anyone has seen Hurricane. \nThe next day, Thomas asks three experimental engines: Lexi and Theo, who helped him get more coal and water earlier, and Merlin, who Lexi and Theo told him about, if they can help him get back to Sodor, but are unable to. So Thomas continues his journey home, and meets Beresford again, a crane whom he previously met after he got lost, and sees that Hurricane and Frankie are taking James to the Steelworks. Thomas enlists the help of the experimental engines to rescue James from being captured too. Theo and Lexi distract the Steelworks engines while Thomas and Merlin try to help James escape. The plan quickly goes downhill, a wild chase ensues in the Steelworks, James is saved but Thomas is put in harm's way when he almost gets melted by molten slag. Hurricane selflessly pushes him out of the way causing his wheels to melt as a result. Frankie claims that Hurricane will not be able to help her make deliveries and explains that they are overworked at the Steelworks, which is why they tried to enslave Thomas and James, and that either nobody wants to work at the factory or just too busy. Thomas suggests that the experimental engines help them out. Although they are sure they are incapable of doing it, they are happy to try. \nOn their way back to Sodor, Thomas and James apologize to each other.

They attract attention, so Bill Willoughby, the local chief of police, visits Mildred, but is unable to persuade her to take them down, even by revealing he has terminal pancreatic cancer. He renews his efforts to solve the case, but does not get anywhere.\nMany townspeople are upset by the billboards, including Jason Dixon, an alcoholic police officer, who unsuccessfully tries to intimidate Red Welby, who rented Mildred the billboards, into taking them down. Mildred's dentist is sympathetic to Willoughby and menaces her during an appointment, so she drills a hole in his thumbnail. Willoughby brings her in for questioning and accidentally coughs up blood into her face. He has her released and is hospitalized, though he soon checks himself out against medical advice.\nThe billboards have further strained Mildred's relationship with her son, Robbie, and she recalls that her last interaction with Angela was an argument.

Stone, whose focus is on schizophrenic patients, is widely considered a critic of the system. In the 1950s, people with mental illnesses were mostly only kept in institutions and sedated when needed. Treatments with insulin shock therapy and the use of electric shocks were common, while talk therapy was only a marginal phenomenon.\nIn Ypsilanti, Stone meets two patients who both believe they are Jesus Christ: the short intellectual Joseph Cassell and the gruff Clyde Benson. Out of this coincidence, the psychologist develops a format of group talk therapy. He has another patient transferred to Ypsilanti who also believes he is Christ, Leon Gabor, and brings the three men together to study their behavior. He finds out that the problems of the three are completely different. Gabor suffered all his life from his deeply religious mother, and he was also traumatized by multiple rapes by a man he had been exposed to as a soldier. Benson couldn't cope with the death of his beloved wife from an abortion. Cassell is prone to outbursts of anger. Once admitted to the institution, he was repeatedly sedated with electric shocks, which he subsequently developed a great fear of because he feared for his sanity. Contrary to the skepticism of many colleagues, including the head of the institution, Dr. Orbus, Stone takes a different course and, for example, completely dispenses with physical punishment. In fact, he manages to get through to the patients by talking to them and writing them letters.\nWhen he makes the cover of a professional journal with his new approach, it arouses the envy of Dr. Orbus, who wants a share of the fame and henceforth urges to be involved in the treatment. Since Stone reacts reservedly to Orbus's obvious craving for prestige, the latter finally bypasses the colleague and lets Cassell be taken alone to his office for an interview. It is revealed that Stone wrote the letters to Cassell on Orbus' behalf, since the head of the asylum originally declined the task. Cassell feels betrayed by Stone and stalled by Orbus. Despite good behavior, he sees his hopes of leaving the clinic dwindling. Out of anger at this realization, he becomes abusive again, which is why Orbus orders renewed electric shocks for him. Stone rushes over and tries to stop it, but is ultimately unable to prevent the shocks. In a skirmish with another doctor, he injures him and himself. Orbus then has him expelled from the institution.\nOrbus takes over his patients. Cassell, however, who noticed that Stone wanted to save him and also that he then disappeared, no longer trusts Orbus. He sees himself in his power and believes in another long suffering. Finally, during a conversation in the chapel's bell tower with Orbus, he jumps out of the window and dies.\nIn the later hearing, Stone accused Orbus of making negligent decisions. He also deciphers Cassell's last words, according to which Cassell not only committed suicide to be free, but above all gave his life to justify the sins of Orbus as Jesus did the sins of mankind. The hearing ends with Stone being fired. However, he is granted permission and funds to continue his study, including the two remaining patients, in New York. Orbus, on the other hand, remains formally in his post, but without decision-making powers until his retirement. The film closes with a summary.

Naveen gives them the bullet from Nemo's body. Kaniyan finds that it is a 9mm bullet which had been ricocheted from Nemo.

One day, he met a woman named Jung Ha-yeon, and after saving her from an unpleasant incident, they build up a friendship, which eventually evolved into romance and love. Subsequently, due to her beautiful looks, the circus master recruited Ha-yeon to perform on stage with Seok-jin, who became her partner in every magical performance. Later, both Seok-jin and Ha-yeon married and Ha-yeon became pregnant.\nOne day on a bus, by chance, Seok-jin saw Ha-yeon on a street passing a letter to a woman. He enquired her what is it, and she said she merely helped a passer-by to pick up a thing. Afterwards, Seok-jin and Ha-yeon went to the capital Seoul on a new contract for further performances. Later, after a performance and while alone in a hotel they lived in, Seok-jin noticed a bag belonging to Ha-yeon was hidden under their bed, and uncovered a rectangular copper plate from the bag, which resembled a tool to make fake cash notes. When Seok-jin asked her about it, Ha-yeon said that during the Japanese colonial period of Korea, a man under the Japanese name Shigeru Okamoto approached her uncle, who was a copper metalsmith, and paid him a huge sum to manufacture the copper plate.\nShortly after Ha-yeon's uncle finished the task, he was killed, presumably by Okamoto for the copper plate, which Ha-yeon found buried under a tree in her house. The Japanese police and Okamoto also repeatedly probed Ha-yeon over the whereabouts of the copper plate, which led to her having to hide it and ran off from these people. Sensing that Ha-yeon's life will still be in danger and she will still be silenced even if she handed over the copper plate to Okamoto, Seok-jin went down wanting to contact Okamoto to stop him from getting near his wife, as he earlier received a letter from Okamoto who ominously stated he will find Ha-yeon. Unfortunately, just as Seok-jin waited for the phone call, Ha-yeon was being pushed to her death by someone, presumably Okamoto.\nGrief-stricken over the death of Ha-yeon and his unborn child, Seok-jin turns to alcoholism and abandoned his career as a circus magician. One day, while he was drunk while walking on a street, he stumbles upon a fake bank note which a passer-by littered on the road. Seeing the fake note, Seok-jin slowly became filled with vengeance and decided to avenge Ha-yeon. First, he went after the Japanese police officer who was formerly in charge of investigation Ha-yeon's uncle's murder, and who was still residing in Korea. The Japanese police officer, who was confronted by Seok-jin, managed to subdue him with the help of his subordinates, and asked him his reason to find him. After hearing Seok-jin's story, the policeman, who was about to leave for Japan and who was also being tricked by Okamoto over the fake bank note incident, then gave a description of Okamoto, describing Okamoto, who did not have a photograph, as a Korean man who was fluent in English, Chinese, Japanese and even German, and stated that Okamoto was always together with a woman. Before he leave, he left behind a fully loaded revolver for Seok-jin to kill Okamoto and even scarred him on the lip.\nActing upon the Japanese's tip-off to look for Okamoto in Seoul, where many people used counterfeit bank notes often, Seok-jin changed his name to Choi Seung-man, and changes his appearance by plucking away a chip of his tooth, and became a penniless taxi-driver who always fetch rich customers and businessmen. He also specially place a mat with written German words behind the backseat, as a way to test if the passenger could read it, as well as burning each bank note he received from each passenger to test if the note was counterfeit. This went on for two years, and one night, while Seok-jin was driving a passenger to a brothel, he heard the male passenger telling him what the German words meant and fluently recited them in German; he also found out that the bank note was fake after burning it the moment the man alighted the taxi. Realising that the man could be the mysterious Shigeru Okamoto, Seok-jin secretly entered the brothel and saw him together with the female brothel owner, who turned out to be the same woman he saw together with Ha-yeon on the day before he and Ha-yeon shifted to Seoul.\nUnder his alias Choi Seung-man, Seok-jin approached the man, and finally, after much begging and pleading, the man hired him as his personal driver; Seok-jin also found out that the man's real name is Nam Do-jin. Seok-jin then spent his days as Do-jin's driver living in Do-jin's stone mansion and secretly watching the man's every move, slowly trying to make a move to execute his revenge plan. One day, Do-jin, who earlier received a phone call looking for him by his Japanese identity, wanted Seok-jin to make a phone call at 10 pm to a number he gave him, wanting him to tell the recipient that he received a copper plate (which was the one used to make fake bank notes) and not to look for him again. The recipient, who was a printer owner involved in making counterfeit bank notes, was later killed by Do-jin after he told Do-jin that the copper plate was in the brothel owner Mdm Sung's possession.\nMdm Sung, who overheard the murder from the phone (as the printer owner had called her prior to Do-jin attacking him), contacted Seok-jin, whom she knew was Ha-yeon's husband. When Seok-jin asked if Mdm Sung was the woman whom the Japanese police officer claimed to be with Do-jin, Mdm Sung laughed and taunted him that Ha-yeon was the woman whom the officer is referring to, and even tauntingly claimed that Ha-yeon was a lover of Do-jin before they separated. Angered at the brothel owner's words, Seok-jin nearly killed her but managed to control himself and went back to Do-jin's mansion with the copper plate and a letter, which Sung claimed was the truth about Ha-yeon. Do-jin later met up with Sung (who had a one-sided crush on him) and killed her and dismembered her after telling her that he killed Ha-yeon to silence her and has never loved her or Sung and failing to receive the copper plate, which could be evidence to prove his crime.\nAfter going back home with Sung's severed head, Do-jin was confronted gunpoint by Seok-jin, who was bent on avenging Ha-yeon's death. After a fight between them which also continued down the basement, Do-jin was knocked unconscious by Seok-jin, whose right finger was cut off by Do-jin using an axe during the fight. Seok-jin was about to shoot Do-jin but after seeing his severed finger, he decided to not shoot Do-jin. He planted fake evidence to make it look like that Do-jin had killed \"Choi Seung-man\", fired a few gunshots in the house and left behind his finger. Additionally, after reminiscing his past memories of Ha-yeon, Seok-jin burned Sung's severed head in the furnace and the letter given to him by Sung, deciding not to read it; he rather accept the fact that he loved Ha-yeon instead of investigating her true feelings further. Seok-jin fled and went into hiding after tipping off to the police with an anonymous identity that a \"murder\" had taken place in Do-jin's mansion.\nDo-jin was subsequently arrested and charged with the murder of \"Choi Seung-man\". While Do-jin was on trial, the prosecutor, who investigated and uncovered some evidence of Do-jin's illegal manufacture of counterfeit bank notes, argued in court that Do-jin killed \"Seung-man\" in order to silence him and prevent him from exposing his illegal deeds, and several witnesses had testified for the prosecution, including medical experts who certified that the fingerprints on the severed finger belonged to \"Seung-man\", and that the blood type of the bloodstains and body part remnants (Sung's head) were blood type A, which proved that Do-jin killed \"Seung-man\". However, Do-jin, who knew that he himself was truly innocent, insisted in his defence that he had no motive or reason to kill his driver, and the defence lawyer impeached the statements of all witnesses by stating there is no direct evidence that Do-jin had killed his driver, who was described as a penniless lunatic by witnesses known to Do-jin. This fierce battle went on until a few months later, in light of the circumstantial evidence and arguments from both sides, the judge warned the prosecutor that if he did not provide further new evidence in the final hearing to prove his case against Do-jin, the court would have to acquit Do-jin.\nIn the next hearing, Seok-jin, dressed in a formal black suit, showed up as a witness, and he told the court that he was indeed the anonymous caller who contacted the police about the murder. Do-jin, who recognised Seok-jin as his driver \"Choi Seung-man\", pointed out that Seok-jin was Seung-man, and when the defence lawyer asked to see if Seok-jin indeed did not have a right finger, Seok-jin revealed to the court that he did not have a right hand, claiming that he lost it while trying out a new magic trick, which was supported by a medical report and witness statement. Do-jin, enraged beyond words that his story and innocence was not believed, tried to attack Seok-jin but ultimately subdued by the guards.\nAfter Seok-jin gave his story to the court, the prosecutor argued that it was not to be believed that Seok-jin, who was apparent strangers with Do-jin and had no feud against him at all, would pretend to be the \"victim\" Choi Seung-man, pretend to be dead and come back alive in the trial to further frame Do-jin for \"committing\" the crime. Seeing that he could not prove that Seok-jin was Choi Seung-man, and knowing that in turn of proving his innocence over his driver's \"murder\", he would be guilty of the other three murders he committed throughout the film and the manufacturing of fake bank notes, Do-jin was forced to confess that he indeed killed \"Seung-man\". As a result, Nam Do-jin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, with no chance of release from prison on parole for good behaviour. He was also set to stand trial for the other crimes he earlier committed on a later date.\nHaving achieved his goal of revenge, and having finally sought justice for Ha-yeon (and their murdered child), Seok-jin returned to the circus and continued his career as a circus magician and performer, while continuing to love Ha-yeon deeply in his heart and had kept a photo of her and her ring by his side.", "tmdb_plot": "In 1947, a magician, Seok-jin plans the most elaborate trick to find out hidden conspiracy in his fiance's death.", "tmdb_id": "452714", "wiki_id": "53849553"}, {"title": "Tori Girl!", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Yukina (Tao Tsuchiya) has always been an easygoing type.

The group is then ambushed by German soldiers who kill Pronger and Jennings and take Kelly and Dr. Priest prisoner. Berton and Cooper discover an exit but are also taken prisoner.\nAfter losing his tunneller to the infected (whom they needed to reactivate the charges), Mueller decides to recruit the group but Dr. Priest refuses to cooperate. Reiner, who was eavesdropping the whole time, singles out Dr. Priest for interrogation. Kelly's health deteriorates and he becomes sick.\nReiner interrogates Dr. Priest and tries to get him to relate to his twisted view on science. Dr. Priest figures out the worms were meant to kill livestock in the Allied countries but jumped species to infect humans. In turn, Reiner reveals that he marveled at the results and deliberately bred deadlier strains. Mueller escorts Berton, Cooper and Kelly into the lower levels where the charges is located but Kelly succumbs to the parasite and kills Cooper. Berton shoots Kelly and holds Mueller at gunpoint, but stands down after Mueller convinces him that the parasite will kill everyone if it ever gets out. Dr. Priest desperately tries to reason with Reiner not to use parasite for the sake of civilian lives, but Reiner remains adamant in using the parasite to destroy Europe and rebuild it under German rule. He then tortures Dr. Priest.\nMueller and Berton locate the charges and learn that the explosives were never rigged in the first place. After killing Dr. Priest, Reiner orders his men to seal the lower level and flood it with poison gas and begins to collect his parasites. Mueller and Berton are forced to flee and find another way to detonate the explosives. Berton tries to rig the explosive to a clock timer for a remote detonation but an infected soldier attacks them, breaking Mueller's leg and destroying the clock. Unable to move, Mueller stays behind and gives Berton time to arm any remaining explosives and escape. Berton finishes and reaches for the exit, but is shot in the leg by Reiner and his guard. Reiner then mocks and tortures Berton, who endures it to distract Reiner and his guard long enough for Mueller to detonate the explosives. The explosion catches both of them off guard, which allows Berton to kill the guard and engage Reiner in a brawl. Reiner attempts to flee but Berton trips him; resulting in his eye being impaled by a vial in his hand. The tunnel collapses on Reiner while Berton barely escapes.

The CIA and MI5 learn that radical imam Yazid Khaleel plans a biological attack on an American target on British soil in collaboration with American-born Islamic convert David Mercer. Frank Sutter, an officer from the CIA's London Station, tells Racine she has orders from Europe Division Chief Bob Hunter to help them interrogate and break Khaleel's captured courier, Lateef.\nIn a hotel, Racine interrogates Lateef and coaxes the message he is to deliver to Mercer's representative.

A police division is created by the United Human Federation to preserve peace throughout the galaxy. Among its staff are the arrogant Major Valerian and his partner, no-nonsense Sergeant Laureline.\nEn route to a mission, Valerian dreams of a planet, M\u00fcl, where a low-tech humanoid race lives peacefully. They fish for pearls containing enormous amounts of energy and use animals to replicate them. Wreckage begins plummeting from the sky, followed by a huge spacecraft that causes an explosion annihilating every being on the planet.

They reach a large, shielded hall where they find the humanoids, known as the Pearls, with an unconscious Filitt. The Pearls' leader, Emperor Haban Lima\u00ef, explains that his people lived peacefully on M\u00fcl until a battle occurred between the Federation and another faction. Filitt, the human commander, ordered the use of fusion missiles that disabled the enemy mothership and sent it crashing into the planet, annihilating M\u00fcl.

She and her friends go to the airport and dress Jara like a normal person. There, Kavya passes Jara's name off as \"K. Vaasi\". The friends manage to admit Vaasi at a Chennai hospital. Sometime later, Kavya arrives at the hospital to find Vaasi wildly beating up people. She then goes back home, where she learns from her cook Pandian that the hospital sedated Vaasi and dropped him at home. The morning afterwards, Kavya and her servants train Vaasi to act like a human.\nSome time later, Kavya's birthday is being celebrated, and Rajasekhar tells that they are also celebrating a 2,000-crore German project. Vicky finds Kavya and tells her that he cannot stand Vaasi. He also tells her that he had told his father about their relationship. Kavya then questions Vicky, and both start arguing. At that moment, Vaasi barges into the room. When Vicky tries to attack Vaasi, the latter gruesomely attacks him. Although Vaasi later comes to his senses, Rajasekhar calls the police, who encase Vaasi in a net and take him away.\nAt the hospital where Vicky gets treated, Rajasekhar is told that the former has a fractured bone in his neck and will have to wear a cervical collar for life. He is also told that the documents for the German project will need to be signed and dispatched. At the Andaman police station, the police say to take Vaasi to the forest and finish him off. Kavya and Pandian arrive at the police station, where Vaasi breaks free and kills the police officers. The trio flees to the forest as they are being followed by the police. Vaasi beats the police up and is held at gunpoint by Shanmugam, who is surprised to see that he is alive. Shanmugam reveals to Kavya that Vaasi's real name is Jara. Vaasi then meets up with his people. Meanwhile, a young girl wanders into the forest and gets worried upon seeing a tiger. Jara saves the girl from the tiger, but the tiger suddenly falls as Vaasi had cut its body. Vaasi manages to stitch the wound and save the tiger. He then takes the girl with him to his tribe. Meanwhile, the German company asks the Andaman police to get the project cleared. Despite the efforts to evacuate the tribe, they refuse to relocate. Shanmugam orders the police to shoot the tribe, when he suddenly hears his daughter's voice. His daughter ended up being the person whom Vaasi saved from the tiger. At night, Vaasi is sleeping and hears people screaming. He goes out to find the shelters being set on fire. A violent battle breaks out between the tribe and the police, with many people getting killed. Vaasi is also taken by the police and gets knocked out.\nThe film goes back to the beginning, where Shanmugam warns Vaasi about the police. Vaasi then runs away, and later, Kavya and her friends accidentally hit him with their car after escaping from the police (when they were out for Vaasi). Meanwhile, Rajasekhar, who has returned from the US, arrives at Andaman. Kavya tries to get a signal to call him, but to no avail. At the police station, Rajasekhar orders that Kavya be back within 24 hours. At the forest office, the police officer introduces Suryaprakash, a commando. Suryaprakash introduces a plan called Project Zero: there are three ways to enter the forest, and if they use full force to cover the zones, the radius of 50 kilometers will gradually reduce to zero. Meanwhile, as Vaasi, Kavya, and Pandian are walking, Pandian sees a bird and throws it. The bird turns out to be a spy camera monitored by the commandos. Vaasi, Kavya, and Pandian flee yet again as the commandos are monitoring their movements. As they are running, Vaasi suddenly gets tied to a tree. Suryaprakash and the officers plan to shoot Vaasi, but everyone hears a tiger growling, and the animal gruesomely kills the commandos.\nThe next morning, Rajasekhar admonishes Kavya for eloping with Vaasi even though he almost killed Vicky. Kavya reminds Rajasekhar that Vaasi and his people are in trouble as a big company is trying to snatch her land. Rajasekhar reveals that it is Kavya who has done this and shows her the documents that she signed (at the beginning of the film). As Rajasekhar abducts Kavya, they see Vaasi, and Rajasekhar hits him with his car. Kavya immediately runs to him, only for Rajasekhar to shoot him. The police then beats up Vaasi badly, but he manages to fight them. Afterwards, Vaasi beats Rajasekhar up but stops after being told to do so by Kavya. Rajasekhar spares Vaasi's life and asks Kavya to come with him. She declines and says that she does not want any more of her industries. She orders Rajasekhar to leave, to which he does so without punishing anyone.", "tmdb_plot": "An Andaman tribal who escapes from men trying to capture his people, ends up in the care of a spoilt, rich girl, who starts to fall in love with him.", "tmdb_id": "449739", "wiki_id": "51551198"}, {"title": "Varnyathil Aashanka", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "The film tells the story of four thieves: Kautta Shivan (Kunchako Boban), Wilson (Chemban Vinod Jose), Pratheesh (Shine Tom Chacko), Gilbert (Manikandan R Achari) and a common man Dayanandan (Suraj Venjaramoodu).

An officer inside the bank tries to call for help on his police radio. Detective Tom Iger, who had just been in the bank, hears the call and decides to check it out. While walking back to check on the bank, he hears another anonymous call on his radio about the robbery.\nThe robbers find only $70,000 in the vault. Leah wants to leave, but Vee and Cyrus demand more money. The assistant manager Ed Maas says he will tell them where $6 million is stored as long as they do not hurt anyone. He tells them the money is in the basement vault which is a part of the old bank and hands them the key to the access door.\nBy now, police are stationed outside the bank and Leah is confused as to how they knew about the heist. The head teller, Susan, tries to connect with Michael, telling him he is a decent man. He tells her that he owes people a lot of money and his sisters are helping him rob the bank.\nWhen Kramer successfully breaks open the vault, the lights flicker.

Leah and Vee watch from the security monitors upstairs, but only Kramer appears on the screen. Thinking there are more people in the bank, Leah asks Cyrus to count the hostages that are gathered inside the safety deposit vault. The lights start to flicker again and the vault door closes with Cyrus and the hostages inside. As Kramer is repeatedly stabbed in the basement vault, Cyrus is overcome by the same group of hostages that attacked Kramer.

Vee finds Cyrus's body with his head blown off. Leah heads outside and releases one of the hostages. She asks Iger who made the phone call to the police, about the message. He answers that it came from the radio, not the phone. Leah goes back inside to the telephone and listens as the same message repeats, suddenly recognizing the voice.\nVee escapes through the water pipe. As Michael begins setting the place on fire to cover their escape, Leah lets the hostages go. As she attempts to escape through the water pipe, the masked man and un-dead hostages attack her. Michael distracts them long enough to allow Leah to escape before setting the bank on fire, sacrificing himself.\nDuring the ensuing police interview of the hostages, Iger tries to find out why they know nothing about Maas. Susan says she's known all the employees inside the bank for ten years and has never seen the man before. Susan looks at the investigation wall and points to a picture of Maas. Iger tells her the picture is of someone who died in the 1982 incident. He was the assistant manager who had called the police to report the robbery but was shot by the robber. It was the same call Leah and Iger had heard the previous day.\nLeah and Vee meet in a rural area. The police assume all of the robbers died in the fire, so they are free to start their lives anew.

Meanwhile, McMahon is informed that due to massive voter fraud in the recent election, a runoff election will have to be held, further delaying the review of the assessment. Fed up, McMahon secretly leaks the assessment to The Washington Post and organizes an interview with 60 Minutes, during which he reveals that, in the last 70 days he has only been granted one meeting with President Obama. \nIn response, Obama announces that he will send 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, but that all U.S. and coalition forces in the country will leave in 18 months, infuriating McMahon and his staff for telegraphing America's Afghan strategy to the Taliban in Afghanistan. To gather the remaining 10,000 troops needed for his strategy to work, McMahon and his men head to Paris to negotiate with the other coalition nations.\nIn Paris, McMahon learns that the President is in Denmark and wishes to meet with him. The ambassador to Afghanistan warns McMahon that he needs to understand President Obama's position: if McMahon continues to anger the President, he will be fired for insubordination. The President, however, merely shakes McMahon's hand as he climbs aboard Air Force One, supposedly due to time constraints. McMahon and his staff attend a dinner in McMahon's honor, accompanied by Rolling Stone writer Sean Cullen, who intends to write a feature story about his performance for an upcoming issue. The next day, during their wedding anniversary dinner, McMahon's wife Jeanie confronts him about how much time he's been spending fighting abroad instead of being with his family back home.\nWhile en route to Berlin with McMahon's staff to continue negotiations, Cullen observes their behavior when \"out of country\" and concludes that they are arrogant, seem to care little about the growing public perception that the war is costly and unwinnable, and hold civilian leadership in contempt. At a conference to discuss his strategy, McMahon is confronted by a German official who criticizes the war and McMahon's strategy. Nevertheless, both the Germans and the French agree to furnish the troops needed for McMahon's planned offensive, codenamed \"Operation Moshtarak\", to proceed, with Afghan President Hamid Karzai's approval.\nThe operation launches, but soon runs into trouble when several civilians are accidentally killed. When McMahon holds a public meeting with locals to apologize for the incident and explain that the U.S. is fighting the war for the benefit of Afghans, the crowd grows hostile and asks McMahon and his troops to leave.\nMcMahon later learns that Cullen's article has been published, and realizes it paints a negative picture of him and his staff as openly speaking against the President and mishandling the war effort. The President calls McMahon to Washington. Knowing that he will be fired for his actions, McMahon returns to Washington and later takes a job as a civilian consultant.\nIn the aftermath, Cullen ponders the consequences of his article, noting that he wished McMahon's fall would finally convince the government to stop invading foreign countries and end the war in Afghanistan. Instead the government simply assigns a new general to replace McMahon.", "tmdb_plot": "A rock star general bent on winning the \u201cimpossible\u201d war in Afghanistan takes us inside the complex machinery of modern war.

While the youngest daughter, Ellie, is more than happy with the trip, the eldest daughter Jan is resentful of having to leave their home in Ohio. Paul and his wife Kate  choose to stay in Aylwood Manor and purchase Ellie a new doll to commemorate the occasion. Mrs. Aylwood, the home's owner, is initially resentful of the intruders but lets them remain after noticing that Jan can hear whispers from the nearby forest. That night Ellie names her new doll \"Nerak\" and Jan sees visions of a young girl in their bedroom mirror before it shatters in a perfect X. Her parents hear the commotion and accuse Jan of deliberately trying to frighten them away from the house.\nThe following day Jan meets a local boy, Mark, and the local oddball Helen, who tells them of the disappearance of Mrs. Aylwood's daughter Karen. The girl had been taken by a spirit inhabiting the forest, the Watcher, after Karen had played a prank involving her wearing a doctor's mask and robe and singing \"Ring around the Rosie\". Unnerved, the teens go to Mark's house with Ellie, where they see her write the name \"Nerak\" in a dusty window, showing that it is \"Karen\" spelled backwards. Later that night Ellie goes into a trance and starts screaming \"Nerak\". Jan follows Mrs. Aylwood into the forest the next day, resulting in her falling into some water and becoming encircled by roots when she hears her family calling for her. Paul and Kate find Mrs. Aylwood trying to free Jan, but assume that she was trying to drown her. Jan comes to her defense, endearing her to the woman. Mrs. Aylwood opens up to Jan and tells her that Karen was taken because the Watcher had assumed she was mocking him. The Watcher was originally a doctor who had been alive during the Black Plague. He had managed to keep the village essentially free from the disease, only for the villagers to turn on him when they discover he is sick. The Watcher is willing to return Karen, as he's aware that she meant no offense, but wants either another child in her place or a \"peeling\". Unable to determine what the latter is, Mrs. Aylwood agreed to trade Ellie for Karen. She admits that she had since regretted the decision and went to the forest to make a new bargain, appealing to the Watcher's Hippocratic Oath so that he would leave Ellie alone but keep Karen. The two then hear the Watcher call out as they see visions of Karen, followed by him calling for Ellie. Jan decides that she will save her sister and get Karen back by recreating Karen's prank, in hopes that the Watcher will either explain the \"peeling\" or take her in Ellie's place.\nThat night the family goes to the local carnival, where Jan and Mark gather Karen's friends. Their departure is noticed by her family, who return home because they assumed that she had gone to Aylwood Manor. They find the house empty and Mrs. Aylwood informs them of Jan's plans, resulting in them all going to the forest in hopes of saving Jan. Meanwhile Jan's plans result in her being taken by the Watcher to another dimension, where she is able to find Karen, who believes that only a day has passed. Back in the living world, Mark realizes that the Watcher was actually asking for a \"pealing\" - for the church bell to be rung for each year of his life so he can pass on to the other side. He runs to the church and rings the bell, which satisfies the Watcher.

The daughter of Queen Hippolyta, Diana is raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazons, women warriors created by the Olympian gods to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains their history to Diana, including how Ares became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon, the \"god-killer\", to prepare them for Ares' return. Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let her sister, General Antiope, train Diana as a warrior.\nIn 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain Steve Trevor when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by German soldiers, who had been pursuing Steve. The Amazons wipe out the German landing force at the expense of heavy losses, with Antiope sacrificing herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia and reveals that a great war is consuming the outside world and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook from the Germans' chief chemist, Dr. Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the \"god-killer\" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.\nIn London, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an armistice with Germany. Diana translates Maru's notes, revealing that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the Western Front. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits Moroccan spy Sameer, Scottish marksman Charlie, and Native American smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in Belgium. Diana goes alone through No Man's Land and captures the enemy trench, liberating the nearby village of Veld with the aid of the Allied forces. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, where Diana and Steve fall in love.\nThe team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party; Steve intends to locate the gas and destroy it and Diana hopes to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.\nSir Patrick appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence, as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the \"god-killer\" sword, he destroys it, telling Diana that, as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, she is the \"god-killer\". He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, blowing up the plane and himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good.
