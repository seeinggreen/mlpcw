He is rescued by the other three who respond to his calls of distress.\nThey then invite Thomas Kutty to join their group who, above all, vow never to cheat on one another. The scene is transitioned by the quote \"Thomas Kutty Vittodaa!\" (Thomas kutty, run!) once the scam artist brings his friends to return the beating he got.\nThe movie transitions to the current time: each of them are introduced again, 20 years later. Mahadevan is a Psychologist and an unhappily married father in the Middle East. Govindan Kutty is a Civil Engineer-CEO who's happily married Parvathi and settled in Kochi.

The prologue also highlights that none of them have really changed from their flirtatious ways, despite being married.\nAfter arriving at Harihar Nagar, they settle into Govindan Kutty's old house at Harihar Nagar. Disappointed at how life has become sombre after growing up, they decide to revert to their younger selves for the rest of the trip. To jump start their \"trip back to youthfulness\", Mahadevan suggests that they should create problems in the neighbourhood: according to him, its only with problems that one becomes youthfully energetic. \nWhile staying at Govindan Kutty's house, they are greeted with flowers left at the doorstep with a tag reading \"Maya\". Immediately thinking that this is their old Maya, they go to meet her in a caf\u00e9. They barely miss her, but Appukuttan throws a rock and breaks her car's rear window. An anonymous woman steps out of the car, but it is not \"their\" Maya. They are immediately arrested. Later, \"Maya\" comes and gets them out of jail saying that they are her friends and didn't recognise it because she hadn't seen them in a long time. Once out, she says not to bother her any more because of this. Maya lives right across from Govindan Kutty's house. Trying to find the weakness that will draw her attention, one night Appukuttan looks to the window and is frightened by the sight of a ghostly figure with a \"burned\" face.\nThomas Kutty is not staying with the other three on that night, but he arrives the next morning. Mahadevan says a sentimental story to make Maya believe that they're not here for wrong reasons. She later comes and visits them and becomes their friend. A hilarious sequence follows.\nIt is revealed that Maya is John Honai's daughter, in cahoots with her evil brother (John was the villain in the first part). Thomas Kutty gets kidnapped days before his wedding and his three friends are suspected. They are followed by the police. Meanwhile, Freddy Honai, son of John Honai reveals that he has Thomas kutty. When the threesome (with great difficulty) enters Freddy Honai's hiding place they find Thomas Kutty. Freddy Honai demands the box filled with money which the old Maya had given them. The 3 friends say to Freddy that they will give the box when the original owner comes in front of them. Freddy calls them to a room where a face covered man with his wheelchair by halfly burned face is sitting. Appukkuttan remembers the face that he seen the face earlier at Christina's their known Maya's house. Freddy reveals it is the person the foursome knows as John Honai, his father. The box is now in a bank with each of the foursome knowing two digits of the password. The four escape, but now Appukuttan is missing. Maya is found and chided, but she tells her story full of dire circumstances. The correct code for the box sounds faulty. It seems that Appukuttan who is in the hands of Honai has forgotten his two digits.\nAfter a lot of twists and turns they confround Honai who has a time bomb attached to his pet Lousie, a clinging lizard. The time bomb comically gets caught over each person. But then things get serious. The time bomb gets caught on Thomas kutty while Honai presses the ignition to burst in 30 seconds. Thomas Kutty runs to Honai in the last few seconds and pushes Honai and himself into the next room. The bomb explodes killing them both.\nIn the end, the other three friends eventually find out that Thomas Kutty is alive and was cheating them the whole time.

Not seeing the opportunity to express his feelings for Beth, Adam lists practical ways in which she helps him. Beth concludes that Adam is not in love with her, and she tells Adam she cannot go with him.\nA year later, Adam is working at the observatory, where his keen interest in space telescopes and his eidetic memory have made him successful and fulfilled in his job.

They both share the trait of stammering when they are emotional; in such a moment, the stammering Jenny induces a spontaneous stammer in Prem, but she misinterprets his stammer as a mockery on her. Although this makes her dislike Prem initially, she reconciles with him after realizing that his stammer is real. Prem eventually falls in love with Jenny, although she is oblivious to this and only considers him a friend. When he tries to tell Jenny his feelings, he finds out that Jenny is in love with her college friend Rahul Jalan.\nHe then meets Rahul and finds out that Rahul loves Jenny more than his family, so helps them board a train to escape. However, Rahul disappears at the train station, and Jenny returns to Prem so Prem can help her find Rahul.\nRahul's father, Pitambar Jalan, a politician, does not like Jenny and completely opposes a relationship between Jenny and Rahul, mainly due to the religious barrier, Jenny being a Christian and Rahul a Hindu.

Prem convinces his mother Shardato let Jenny hide in their house while Jenny's family search for her, but they are eventually caught by the police.

Some events are shown multiple times from varying perspectives. A young Israeli Arab boy, Nasri, who lives in the Ajami neighborhood of Jaffa, narrates the film.\nIn the first story, Nasri's neighbor\u2014a teenage boy\u2014is shot to death by a well-known Bedouin clan in a drive-by shooting while working on his car. Nasri explains that the intended target was his older brother Omar, who had previously sold the car to the neighbor. The botched hit was revenge for a loss of one of Bedouin clan members, who was shot and paralyzed by Nasri's uncle in a dispute. Nasri and his younger sister are sent to Jerusalem, while Omar, his mother, and grandfather stay behind. Fearing for his family's safety, Omar seeks protection and guidance from Abu Elias, an affluent restaurant owner, and well known and respected member of the Jaffa community. Abu Elias arranges for a three-day ceasefire, and hires a lawyer to represent Omar in tribal court. During this time, Nasri and his sister return home. At the conclusion of the court session, the judge declares that Omar must pay tens of thousands of dinars\u2014the equivalent of tens of thousands of US dollars\u2014so peace can be restored. Omar is given three weeks to make good on his payment. Omar and his friend Shaata attempt petty crime in order to come up with the finances, but are unsuccessful at bringing in enough money. Omar's mother attempts to persuade him to escape with the family, but Omar refuses to leave, believing that there is no place to run to.\nThe second story introduces a young teenaged boy named Malek who lives in the Palestinian territory of Nablus. Malek is illegally employed in Abu Elias's restaurant, and works out of desperation to make enough money for his ailing mother's bone marrow transplant surgery. Malek is friends with Omar, who has also become a recent employee at the restaurant. It is also revealed that Omar, a Muslim, is in love with Abu Elias's daughter Hadir, a Christian. Abu Elias, once discovering the secret couple later in the film by catching them in the surreptitious act of flirtation, does not approve of their relationship, and angrily fires Omar, warning him to stay away from his daughter.\nThe third story shows a brief, but violent encounter between an older Jewish man and his three young drug dealing Arab neighbors. The dispute begins when the Jewish man complains to the young men that he has not been able to sleep, due to the fact that their bleating sheep keep him up all night. The disagreement soon escalates, and one of the young men mortally stabs the Jewish man. The three young men go into hiding before the police arrive. Amongst the policemen who arrive at the scene is an Israeli officer named Dan, nicknamed Dando by his friends. Viewers learn that Dando's younger brother Yoni has gone missing during his service in the Israeli Defense Forces. While rumors circulate that Yoni may have run away and became very religious, Dando's family\u2014mother and father specifically\u2014suspect that he may have been kidnapped or murdered by a Palestinian terrorist organization. Dando\u2014a family man with a wife and kids\u2014has remained strong for his emotionally broken family, as they make attempts at locating his brother. Later in the story, Dando is informed that the army has discovered the remains of what is believed to be a murdered Israeli soldier in the Palestinian territories. It is soon thereafter confirmed that the remains are Yoni's, and Dando\u2014emotionally traumatized\u2014vows to find the murderer and bring him to justice.\nIn the fourth story, viewers learn of the character Binj (who is played by co-director Scandar Copti) an eccentric cook who works in Abu Elias's restaurant. He is also close friends with Omar, Shaata and Malek. Binj is in love with a Jewish girl from Tel Aviv, and is thinking of moving in with her, much to the dismay of his group of friends. It is revealed that Binj's brother was one of the three involved in the stabbing of the Jewish man in Jaffa. Both Binj and his father are taken in and interrogated by the police. After his release, Binj reluctantly agrees to accept a great deal of drugs that belongs to his brother who is still on the run. Early one morning, after a social gathering in his house, Binj awakes Malek so he won't be late to the restaurant's opening and hides in his presence the brick of drugs. Just when Malek is leaving he sees three Hebrew speaking men enter Binj's house. When Binj is found dead in his apartment not long afterward, Malek and Omar initially suspect that he was murdered by a group of Israeli drug dealers. It is later revealed that those three men were actually policemen who came to search Binj's house and intimidate him into revealing his brother's location. Having to leave after he told them nothing the police promises Binj to return. Binj, tired from the situation and annoyed by the ongoing harresment of the police, discarded the majority of the drugs, put sugar powder inside packages mimicking drug bricks and hid them around the house in an attempt to mock the police, should they ever return. Binj then proceeds to snort the remainder of drugs he did not discard and accidentally dies of a drug overdose. All of this is unbeknownst to Malek and Omar who, after Binj's death, takes one of the hidden mock-drug packages and, thinking it is the drugs, decides to sell it to a drug dealer in an attempt to pay off their respective debts. Abu Elias learns of their plans and tips off the police, thinking Omar will be caught, thus ending the relationship between Omar and his daughter. Initially, Abu Elias fires Malek after learning of his involvement with drugs, but after Malek's pleading and after learning that Omar will not go alone to the exchange he changes his mind, and instructs Malek to meet the dealers with Omar, but warns him not to carry the drugs on his person. He assures Malek that once Omar is taken into custody by the police, Malek can return to the restaurant and that his sick mother will be taken care of. Like Omar and Malek however, Abu Elias does not realize that the drugs are fake.\nThe fifth story shows the encounter between Omar, Malek, and the drug dealers. Toward the beginning of the film, viewers are shown the scene, and initially led to believe that Malek was shot to death by the drug dealers, once they discovered the drugs were fake. It is revealed later however, that the dealers were actually policemen executing a sting operation. It is also revealed that Omar's younger brother Nasri insisted on accompanying Omar and Malek to the meeting, afraid that something bad would happen to his brother. Upon arrival, Omar tells Nasri to stay in the car, and at Malek's urging, leaves his gun behind as well. At the meeting, the police tackle and beat Omar and Malek after they discover the drugs are fake. Dando, who is a part of the sting, sees Malek with the pocket watch he planned to give Abu Elias as a present. Dando believes that the watch belonged to Yoni and in a fit of rage beats Malek and aims his gun at him with the intent to murder him. However Nasri, who hadn't stayed in the car as ordered, sees the gun pointed at Malek, and shoots Dando with Omar's gun. Malek is then shot and killed by another officer.

As Vetra goes to evaluate the experiment, she discovers that Silvano has been murdered, and one of the canisters was stolen.  Shortly thereafter, four of the preferiti, the favored candidates to be elected pope, are kidnapped by a man claiming to represent the Illuminati. He sends the Vatican a warning, claiming he will murder each of the cardinals from 8 p.m. to midnight, when the stolen antimatter will explode and destroy the city, hidden somewhere within.\nHaving attracted the Church\u2019s attention after searching for the Priory of Sion in Paris and London, American symbologist Professor Robert Langdon is brought to the Vatican to help. After listening to the assassin's threat, he deduces that the four cardinals will be murdered on the four altars of the \"Path of Illumination\", in locations relevant to the classical elements. McKenna gives Langdon access to the Vatican Secret Archives to research the altars, against the wishes of Commander Richter, head of the Swiss Guard. Langdon and Dr. Vetra examine Galileo Galilei's banned book, finding clues to the first altar. Initially believing it to be at the Pantheon, they eventually discover it to be the Chigi Chapel. Though they rush to the chapel, accompanied by Ernesto Olivetti and Claudio Vincenzi of the Corps of Gendarmerie of Vatican City, they are too late to save Cardinal Ebner, who is found dead, having suffocated on a mouthful of dirt and branded with the ambigrammatic word \"Earth\".\nFollowing the clue left by a Bernini statue at the Chigi Chapel, Langdon discovers the second altar to be a Bernini-created sculpture in St. Peter's Square. Upon reaching it, they find Cardinal Lamass\u00e9 mortally wounded, his lungs punctured and his chest branded with the ambigram \"Air\". After reading a threatening note left on Lamass\u00e9's body, Vetra comes to suspect that Pius XVI did not die of a stroke as believed, but was actually murdered with an overdose of tinzaparin, which he had been secretly taking for his thrombophlebitis. This is confirmed when McKenna and Vetra secretly inspect the body in the Vatican necropolis. After returning to the Archives for further research, Langdon, Olivetti, and Vincenzi eventually identify the Santa Maria della Vittoria as the altar of fire, where they fail to save Cardinal Guidera, branded with the ambigram \"Fire\" from burning to death when the assassin appears, who kills everyone except Langdon before escaping.\nAfter consulting a map of Rome, Langdon identifies the final altar as Piazza Navona's Four Rivers sculpture. Escorted by two Vatican police officers, they find the assassin attempting to drown Cardinal Baggia, who is branded with the ambigram \"Water\", in the Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi. The officers are killed by the assassin, but Langdon manages to rescue Baggia with the timely help of bystanders. Baggia tells Langdon he was held with the preferiti in Castel Sant'Angelo.\nRichter confiscates Dr. Silvano's journals, thus convincing Vetra that he is a conspirator. Langdon, Vetra, and the police storm Castel Sant'Angelo. Langdon and Vetra find the assassin's lair, discovering the four brands used on the cardinals, and deduce that the missing fifth is meant for McKenna. Before escaping, the assassin claims he was hired by \"men of God\". Guided to a car by his unseen contractor, the assassin is killed when the vehicle is destroyed by a car bomb. Langdon and Vetra find a secret passageway leading to the Vatican, warning the Swiss Guard of McKenna's fate. They find Richter hovering over a branded McKenna. Richter and Archbishop Simeon, an alleged conspirator, are killed. Langdon retrieves a key from the dying Richter's hand.\nThe antimatter container is found in Saint Peter's tomb, due to detonate in five minutes, the cold temperature preventing its battery from being changed in time (according to Vetra, the device would not have enough residual charge to keep the antimatter in suspension). McKenna, a former helicopter pilot, seizes the canister and pilots a helicopter into the sky, parachuting out seconds before the antimatter detonates. The explosion unleashes a powerful, blinding shockwave that causes damage and injuries throughout Vatican City but no lives are lost and the Church is saved. McKenna is hailed as a hero, with calls for him to be elected pope by acclamation.\nLangdon and Vetra retrieve Silvano's journals from Richter's office, finding he kept tabs on the Pope with hidden security cameras for medical reasons. Using the key Langdon retrieved from Richter, they discover that McKenna was the true mastermind behind the attacks. The Pope had invited Silvano to publicly present the antimatter as proof of a divine power, bridging the gap between religion and science and potentially ending the conflict between them. Considering such a claim blasphemy, McKenna orchestrated Pius XVI's death and hired the assassin, plotting to have himself elected as pope while making the Illuminati the scapegoat. The footage is shown to the papal conclave. McKenna, realizing he has been exposed, commits suicide via self-immolation after refusing to be taken alive.\nThe following morning, Cardinal Baggia is elected as the new pope.

Arundhati is engaged to Rahul while Arundhati's relatives: a couple, while on their way to Gadwal meet with an accident but stay unscathed. They see a decorated mansion at a short distance and go to seek help but are horrified by a ghost of a woman, disguised as the landlady who wants the couple to break a tomb protected by divine Yantras in a room of upper floor and free \"her son\" from it. The wife vanishes into thin air while the husband goes insane and the decorated mansion turns out to be ruined and not beautiful as the couple had seen earlier.\nArundhati's paternal grandfather Bhupati Raja finds himself injured by an accident caused by the ghost which brings Arundati to Gadwal, which is desired by the ghost imprisoned in the tomb. Arundhati clashes with Anwar, a Fakir who evicts malevolent spirits from (or) evil control on a person when he tries to do the same with the insane husband as she doesn't believe in ghosts and related stuff. That night, she receives a misleading phone call from Rahul, apparently who invites her to the old mansion. In the mansion, Arundhati sees the tomb and is provoked to free the ghost but she is taken away from the mansion by Anwar, who helps her see ghosts, making her believe in his words. He warns her to leave Gadwal as evil powers are after her. To know about the old mansion which belongs to her clan, Arundhati asks their family's maid Chandramma who had been serving the clan since the time of Jejamma and is treated as a family member rather than a servant.\nChandramma narrates to the whole family that the mansion was inherited by Raja Chinna Venkata Rangarayudu who had two daughters: Bhargavi and Jejamma. Bhargavi was married to Pasupathi: her cross-cousin and son of Jalajamma, Rangarayudu's sister. Pasupathi and Jalajamma are greedy for the property and hope that the former inherit the wealth for which Jalajamma deceitfully convinced Rangarayudu to get Bhargavi married to Pasupathi, a cruel womanizer. Jejamma fumed with anger when Pasupathi molested and murdered her blind dance teacher Kanchana and requested her father to evict him and his mother out of Gadwal but her father resisted as Bhargavi's life would be ruined. Considering herself an obstacle for her maternal family's reputation, she hung herself and died. Pasupathi arrived drunk at the funeral and insulted Bhargavi's corpse resulting in the enraged Jejamma to oust him out of the kingdom but not before having him beaten up by the people of Gadwal and tying him to his horse, which dragged him to the forest. He was presumed to be dead and Gadwal celebrated the death of a cruel man. Jejamma continued to be loved by the people for her act and grew up to be a beautiful young lady, trained in arts and warfare. Pasupathi, who did not die was rescued by Aghoris, who were passing by. To avenge what was done to him, Pasupathi mastered Blackmagic and returned to Gadwal on Jejamma's wedding day.\nWreaking havoc, Pasupathi partially disrobed Jejamma who lured him into the room where Pasupathi murdered Kanchana using her dance. She cut off his tongue to prevent him from uttering incantations, pinned his hands to prevent him from doing Blackmagic and commanded a chandelier to fall on his body. She spared his life when sages present at the mansion tell her that his Pretatma would be more powerful and destroy Gadwal. To prevent his Pretatma from emerging after his death, she built a tomb around him when he was alive and made it capable of stopping his Pretatma from coming out of it using Yantras, a powerful trident and divine enchantments. The royal family deserted the mansion and started to live in another one.\nAt present, Chandramma stops narrating as the next part of the story is something frightening. However, upon being privately insisted by Arundhati, Chandramma says that despite being imprisoned in the tomb, Pasupathi's Pretatma, after his death inside it continued to ruin the happiness of Gadwal by inducing several diseases, drought and famine. Jejamma was also warned by his Pretatma from the tomb.\nPresently, the insane husband breaks the tomb when Pasupathi's Pretatma mimics his wife to lure him. Freed, Pasupathi's vengeful ghost starts to trouble Arundhati desiring to fulfil his sexual desires with her and murder her, who stays back at Gadwal by making excuses upon being threatened by Pasupathi while her family leaves to Hyderabad. Realizing that she has been going through, Chandramma and Anwar help Arundhati realize that she is Jejamma's incarnation. Arundhati finds inscriptions, written by Jejamma on her own painting and learns that Jejamma, when she had gone to several temples and priests to find a solution to completely destroy Pasupathi, crossed paths with few Aghoras who suggested that the weapon capable of killing him is herself and for the weapon, Jejamma must die and claim that she would be reincarnated in her own family for accomplishing the task using the weapon. As a result, Arundhati returned to Gadwal, bid a farewell to her family and people and returned to Aghoras, who gave her a painful death and after skeletonizing her corpse, fashioned a dagger from her bones, which they safely hid.\nPresently, Anwar and Arundhati set out to search for the weapon while Chandramma is asked to stay at Anwar's home. Rahul is threatened by Pasupathi's ghost over a phone call and after seeing his driver commit suicide after behaving strangely and attempting to run the car over him, Rahul complies and arrives at Gadwal. Chandramma spots him and attempts to stop him but he fails to see her and she is murdered by Pasupathi. Arundhati and Anwar, while on their way to Aghoras meet with an accident caused by Pasupathi resulting in Anwar falling off the cliff. Arundhati runs with fear and meets Rahul while the family arrives and is devastated to see Arundhati in a frightened state. They learn of Chandramma's death while Arundhati's family is abducted by Pasupathi leaving Arundhati with no option but to surrender herself to him, who possesses the insane man. However, Anwar turns out to be alive, meets the Aghoras and procures the weapon. He returns to the old mansion and gives the weapon to Arundhati, who stabs Pasupathi with it but he doesn't die. Pasupathi kills Anwar when he tries to inform Arundhati that the dagger would gain power to kill a Pretatma only if it is drenched in Arundhati's blood. When Pasupathi attempts to molest Arundhati, the latter stabs herself using the same dagger unwilling to let his greed be fulfilled. The dagger gains divine powers and Arundhati transforms into Jejamma to stab him and kill him to death.\nThe mansion burns and explodes while the family manages to run safe out of it and presume Arundhati to be dead but she returns like Jejamma.", "tmdb_id": 31629}, "19985215": {"title": "Arya 2", "plot": "Two orphans, Ajay and Arya, meet at an orphanage, where the psychotic Arya forcibly befriends Ajay and grows possessive about him, while Ajay despises him but pretends not to.

After his sister escorts her dad away from the grave, Carty, looking at his watch, starts to run off. Along his way he gets changed into casual clothing and carries on running until he catches a football special train.\nAboard the train, he meets the leader of the football firm, John Godden (Stephen Graham), an ex-soldier who warns him he has no room for runners in his firm and he best stand his ground. When walking through the train, he meets Elvis (Liam Boyle), and Carty reminisces about how they met in a series of flashbacks. We learnt that Carty has always been fascinated by The Pack, observing them at Tranmere games when they fight and trying to dress like them, at which point Baby Millan (Oliver Lee), taunts Carty and threatens him but Elvis leads the other lads away and Carty stands his ground. Carty eventually meets Elvis at a club night and the pair realise they have many things in common from music taste to wanting out of Birkenhead. The pair fantasise about leaving for Berlin. Carty, over their next few meetings, begs Elvis to introduce him to The Pack but Elvis calls them a \"gang of pricks\" and says Carty does not want to be involved. Eventually, after Carty headbutts a rude sales assistant in a record shop to prove his fighting skills, Elvis gives in and tells him to meet him on the train at 12:00 on Saturday.\nIt fast-forwards onto the train again, and The Pack are led by Godden to meet a rival firm. Once there, the two groups scrap and Carty is taken over by a thrill as he is embroiled in the fight. Carty returns home and we discover that his sister knows about his fascination with The Pack. The next day, Carty promises to take her shopping for her birthday in Chester. However, after an argument with Elvis when Elvis tells him he is making a \"twat out of himself\", Carty leaves work to find Elvis there. The pair go for a drink and forget about their argument, and Carty forgets completely about his sister. He promises he will take her out another time the day after, as his mind is firmly on the meet The Pack has when they travel to Wrexham that day. Once there, police attempt to form a barrier between the firms but Carty breaks through and cuts a Wrexham fan with his Stanley - much to the delight of Godden, who finally accepts him as one of The Pack. Everyone toasts Carty on the train home, except Baby Millan and Elvis who are far from happy about his new status. That night at The Pelican, the HQ and chosen pub of The Pack, Carty is \"initiated\" with a girl who he takes outside to have sex with. Once out there, Godden warns Baby Millan to not deal heroin to the members of the firm, warning The Pack cannot have any \"smackheads\". Baby replies \"But it's okay for Elvis to do it?\", much to the puzzlement of Godden and the rest of the firm. Outside, Carty does not perform well with the girl, and the lads all rib him for this.\nCarty and Elvis one night meet two women, Sonia (Rebecca Atkinson) and Jackie on a bus and take them back to Elvis' bohemian-style flat, which has stars on the wall and a noose to remind him of the \"certainty of death\". Elvis' behaviour becomes erratic as he consumes heroin, and when Carty refuses, Elvis rejects Sonia's advances and plays the guitar instead. Carty, waking up, sees Sonia in the bathroom and the pair have sex. The next day, Elvis and Carty are on their way to another away day when the pair argue in front of Godden. Elvis, taunting Carty's choice of women, is obviously hurt when Carty taunts his performance in bed with the women in front of The Pack. Godden taunts Elvis for taking heroin. Carty tries to apologise to Elvis as the pair walk in front of The Pack, and Carty spots the opposition firm coming towards them. He yells at the firm and urges The Pack to join them - and Godden does, only briefly, before headbutting Carty and telling him he is the leader of The Pack. Carty's reign as a top boy in the firm is over and Elvis is back to his jovial self on the train home as Carty sulks in the corner.\nCarty forgets about the Pack for a while and we see him telling his boss, Uncle Bob, that he will go back to college to do his Foundation Course. He spends more time with his sister and he urges her to go out one night. In a taxi, Carty meets a pretty girl, Natasha (Sacha Parkinson), whom he had previously met in a club. The pair are spending a romantic night in when Carty's sister enters, visibly shaken up. She has been roughed up by a gang of boys and Carty, attempting to sort them out, is beaten up by them too. He recruits the help of Elvis and The Pack (without Godden, who Elvis informs him, has been killed by Baby Millan after a disagreement in The Pelican). The Pack beat up the gang of lads who roughed up Carty's sister, and Carty finds Elvis crying on the waterfront. Carty thanks him and says he owes Elvis one, but Elvis replies Carty does not owe him anything, and tells Carty \"He always loved you, Carty\".\nAt Godden's funeral, Carty is sitting in the church after everyone leaves when Elvis enters and asks Carty if he will hear his confession. Carty, confused, agrees. Elvis is seen through the confession booth inhaling what appears to be heroin, and he tells Carty to come away with him to Berlin. Carty, currently enjoying a healthy relationship with his family, tells him he cannot yet. Elvis is upset by this, and tells him \"He always loved you Carty\", meaning himself. Elvis asks Carty for one more away day, before leaving.\nAt the final away day, Carty is stood on the station platform waiting for Elvis to meet him yet there is no sign of him. He catches the train just in time and as the train pulls away, Elvis is visible sat on top of a bridge overlooking the track, as the train crosses underneath it, the bridge is covered in smoke and once it clears, Elvis has gone, hinting at suicide. Carty is out of place in The Pack without Elvis and after a final meet with a local firm in which Carty does not get involved, he is cut with a knife by Baby Millan, who calls him a \"ponce\". Carty then turns away from The Pack and walks out of the street, saying \"How long had I waited for this day? Out of here.

During lunch one day at his new school, he meets a girl who says her name is written Sa5m (pronounced Sam; the 5 is silent). She tells him about Bandslam, an annual music competition in which the winning band gets a recording contract. Will and Sa5m quickly become friends but, shortly after, he is sought after by an older girl named Charlotte Barnes. Impressed by his eclectic knowledge of music, Charlotte, who is a gifted singer-songwriter, asks Will to manage her rock/ska band.\nWill agrees to help Charlotte's band (later called I Can't Go On, I'll Go On) which includes Bug and Omar, eventually expanding it with more like-minded outcasts. The group's sound starts to come together and their prospects for success look bright. Will starts losing his \"loser-status\", but the band gets in the way of completing a class project he was doing with Sa5m. After spending a day with Sa5m, Charlotte teaches Will how to properly kiss a girl, by demonstrating on him that night. Will takes Sa5m to the overlook and, after an awkward start, successfully kisses her, after which Sa5m shyly asks Will to accompany her to a movie screening, to which he agrees. However, Will stands up Sa5m, instead going to a concert with Charlotte. After that, Sa5m starts ignoring Will at school; so he visits her house, hoping to apologize. Her mom shows him a video of a younger Sa5m performing \"Everything I Own\", but when Sa5m arrives home she is outraged and orders Will to leave. As an apology, he makes a touching documentary short about her for his Human Studies project and she eventually forgives him.\nAfter Will accidentally ruins Ben's attempt to reconcile with Charlotte, Ben decides to do a little research on him, in order to ruin his image. He finds out about Will's father, who was sent to prison years ago when he accidentally killed a child while driving drunk. Ben then starts to call Will \"Dewey\" (just as other students did at his old school), which stands for \"DWI\" (\"Driving While Intoxicated\"). Will detests this nickname because it reminds him of his father, of whom he is ashamed. Soon after, Charlotte's father dies and she decides to quit the band. Her father hated how she acted when she was with her ex-boyfriend, so after he got sick she decided to change her image and be nicer to \"people like Will.\" The band members are hurt by this discovery but they decide to go on nonetheless, with Sa5m taking over as lead singer.\nOn the night of Bandslam, Charlotte comes backstage to apologize to the band for her behaviour. Will and the band accept her apology. Right before going on stage, however, they see Ben's band (the \"Glory Dogs\") playing the same song that I Can't Go On, I'll Go On were planning to perform, forcing them to change their act at the last minute. Will suddenly remembers the video Sa5m's mother showed him earlier and suggests that they perform \"Everything I Own\", since it is the only other song Sa5m knows. To buy some time, Will comes out first onstage, but at first he is embarrassingly silent. The students begin to chant \"Dewey\". He starts to walk off the stage, but then comes back and decides to chant with them instead. After carrying the chant for a while, he finally changes it to, \"Do we wanna ROCK?!\". The band then takes the stage and performs \"Everything I Own\".\nAlthough they fail to win the competition, a YouTube video of their performance gains the band popularity at school. David Bowie sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band as one of their first acts.

His wife advises him to send a message to his cousin Henry the Lion to bring fresh troops for the German army to which Barbarossa agrees but the Empress has an additional request; to free Eleanora because she believes that is protected by God but Barbarossa refuses.\nAt the Mera River, Emperor Barbarossa and his troops arrive and Barbarossa asks his cousin Henry the Lion when he is going to give the army he promised him. Henry says that war is no longer a luxury that he can afford and he has no soldiers to give to Frederick, but he does have a small chest filled with coins with which Frederick can buy fresh troops. Possessed of great wealth already, Frederick growls that Henry is \"useless\" and leaves him behind.\nBarozzi arrives late to Eleanora's burning but a masked woman is on the pyre which is set alight.

Humanoid Cylon John Cavil is shown leading the planning for the genocidal attack on the human race.  The seven known Cylons are present in the control room of the main Cylon base.  Two versions of Cavil are shown in a Resurrection Ship, with the \"Final Five\" Cylons in stasis in resurrection chambers. The two versions of Cavil briefly discuss their plans for \"teaching a lesson\" to their creators, the Final Five. One version of Cavil announces his intention to witness the destruction of humanity on the ground.  This version of Cavil travels to the planet Picon, where he encounters Ellen Tigh. Other characters from the series are also depicted: Gaius Baltar has a final meeting with Caprica Six; Samuel Anders is shown at his Pyramid team's training camp along with the team doctor, who is Number Four/Simon; and Tory Foster (Rekha Sharma) is shown driving to an airport.\nThe destruction of the Twelve Colonies is depicted in a series of new special effects shots, with the Cylon Hybrid narrating the destruction with oblique poetry.  Almost all of the planets of the Twelve Colonies are depicted in short scenes. Ellen Tigh is severely wounded in the nuclear attack on Picon. Cavil helps her leave the planet aboard a Colonial Fleet rescue ship.  Aboard a civilian transport, Cavil torments the half-conscious woman with descriptions of his intent to destroy humanity. Tory Foster survives the nuclear attack as well, but is wounded when her car flips over in the blast.  Anders helps console his teammates in the mountainous region where they were training.  Several scenes from the television miniseries were edited into The Plan.\nCavil later boards the Galactica, calling himself \"Brother Cavil,\" and takes over the Galactica's chapel.  The creation of Galactica's \"wall of remembrance\" is depicted, where survivors posted pictures and mementos of their dead or missing loved ones.  Using religious fliers which talk about a \"plan\", Cavil covertly gathers the seven known Cylons. Cavil tells them that he intends to continue his plan to utterly destroy the human race. He also tells them that there is a sleeper agent aboard the Galactica, a Number Eight, whom he also plans to use.\nBack on Cylon-occupied Caprica, Sam Anders and his teammates have fled their training center for safer quarters. They spot Cylon Centurions collecting the parts of their fallen comrades. Later, Sam and his companions launch their first attack on the Cylons, losing several people in an otherwise successful attack. Sam and Jean Barolay later observe several Number Fives burying numerous dead human bodies, realize that Cylons have taken humanoid form, and resolve to attack them.  They do so later, while a Cavil version supervises the Fives' work.  Cavil plays dead and survives the attack unharmed. Mistakenly believing Cavil to be a human being, Sam and his friends take the priest with them back to their camp. Cavil is clearly shocked to see Anders, because he is one of the original Final Five.\nBack on the Galactica, the events of the first-season episodes unfold from the Cylons\u2019 perspective. Brother Cavil triggers the original Cylon programming of the Number Eight known as Sharon \"Boomer\" Valerii. She plans a bombing of the ship's water storage facilities. As she tries to implement her plan, Boomer becomes increasingly distraught because she has fallen in love with Chief Galen Tyrol (Aaron Douglas). Cavil becomes angry when the Number Five known as Aaron Doral is exposed as a Cylon, and demands that he attempt to kill Commander Adama.  The Number Two, meanwhile, listens in on Colonial Fleet communications, and becomes convinced that Kara \"Starbuck\" Thrace (Katee Sackhoff) holds some special purpose for the humanoid Cylons. He begins to paint the nebula depicted in Season Three episodes. Cavil, realizing that the Number Two known as Leoben Conoy has had his identity compromised, demands that the Number Two turn himself over to the humans and attempt to deceive or kill them. When Boomer's plan to deprive the Fleet of water fails (and Boomer helps the Galactica locate more water), Cavil demands that she kill Commander Adama. She first attempts suicide, and later purposefully botches the assassination attempt. Cavil, worried about Dr. Baltar's attempt to develop a Cylon detection machine, orders the Number Six known as Shelly Godfrey to frame Baltar for treason.  She does so, but her attempt fails when her evidence is exposed as a sham by Lieutenant Gaeta. Cavil orders the Six into an airlock and kills her. Cally Henderson's assassination of Boomer is depicted as well. Cavil also orders the Number Four known as Simon to destroy the ship on which he lives with his family. Simon commits suicide rather than kill the family he has grown to love.\nIn the aftermath of Simon's suicide, Simon's wife Giana tries to convince everyone that he wasn't a Cylon. She seeks solace from Chief Tyrol, who is beginning to suspect that he himself might be a Cylon.Meanwhile, back on Cylon-occupied Caprica, the other version of Cavil has ingratiated himself with Sam Anders. Cavil has ordered the Number Four to attempt to kill members of Sam's team, but none have died and Cavil criticizes the Four's actions. Starbuck returns to Caprica and meets the stranded Colonial pilot Karl \"Helo\" Agathon.  Cavil makes a failed attempt to trick Sam into thinking they are Cylons and attacking them. Helo and Starbuck join them and attack a local Cylon base.  Starbuck is wounded, taken captive by the Cylons, and subjected to various breeding experiments. Anders, Helo, and the others rescue her, discovering that Simon is a Cylon in the process. Later, Cavil tries to assassinate Starbuck and Anders but finds that he cannot pull the trigger, because he cannot stop thinking about Anders' comment that death wouldn't make him love these people any less.  When the Cylon Centurions attack, Cavil is forced to hide with the rest of the humans.  That night, Cavil meets with a Number Six who informs him that the Cylons have agreed to end their attacks on the human race. Cavil, who has changed his mind about humanity, agrees to pass on the message to the humans despite the fact that his model voted against the truce. Cavil returns to the human camp, and the humans leave the next day for the Galactica.\nMeanwhile, the Brother Cavil on the Galactica is bedeviled by the repeated appearance of a young boy named John (Alex Ferris) in his chapel. Their various interactions finally end when the fake priest offers the boy an apple and then stabs him to death.\nThe Plan ends with \"Caprica Cavil\" arriving aboard the Galactica, and exposing himself and Brother Cavil as humanoid Cylons (as depicted in scenes from the second-season episode \"Lay Down Your Burdens\"). We realize from the Cylon perspective that he does this on purpose to stop Brother Cavil's plans.\nBrother Cavil is brought to the brig protesting that he is not a Cylon until he sees Caprica Cavil already in the brig, at which point he stops pretending. Caprica Cavil announces that the Cylons have voted to give the humans \"a reprieve\" because they have decided that their attempts at genocide were an error. They have left the colonies and will stop hunting the humans (this scene differs from the same scene in \"Lay Down Your Burdens, Part Two\".)\nBrother Cavil is in disbelief that the Cylons have decided to leave the humans alone, and continues to argue for their destruction. Caprica Cavil asserts that Brother Cavil does not understand the nature of love. He says that the Final Five loved humanity, and that Brother Cavil is jealous of this love. Brother Cavil, he claims, does not understand that God and the Final Five will love humanity even more if the human race is extinguished.\nAs they are escorted to the airlock, the Cavils see the Final Five Cylons watching them and admit this wasn't the reunion they had expected. The two Cavils are forced into the airlock where they argue their differing perspectives right up until the end. Brother Cavil announces that he intends to finish the destruction of the human race once he is resurrected, implying that he and John Cavil are one and the same and he intends to box Caprica Cavil to prevent him from spreading his ideologies to the rest of the Cylons. The two are ejected, and float out past the fleet. The film ends with this scene overlaid with John Cavil's fourth-season tirade lamenting his human-like body and desiring to be more like a machine so that he could \"see gamma rays, hear x-rays, smell dark matter...and feel the solar wind of a super-nova\" flowing over him.", "tmdb_id": 105077}, "25609292": {"title": "The Be All and End All", "plot": "At fifteen, Robbie has only one thing on his mind - losing his virginity.

Their tranquil holiday is complicated when he cannot resist becoming involved in the case of a man, insurance broker Emile Leullet (Jacques Gamblin), who recently attempted to fake his own death in a car crash near S\u00e8te for his mistress (Vahina Giocante) and the insurance money. Leullet, hiding under an assumed name and altered appearance and unsure what to do now, seeks out Bellamy for help. (Bellamy is a celebrity and well known throughout France through his published memoirs, which reveal he has a \"soft spot for murderers\"). Leullet may or may not have killed the homeless man whose corpse was found burned in his car. The dead man, Denis Leprince (also played by Gamblin), was a son of a local judge, now also dead. Bellamy's alcoholic half-brother Jacques Lebas (Clovis Cornillac) shows up unexpectedly and soon he and Paul are bickering bitterly and Paul is back on the bottle himself, which he had previously given up. Fran\u00e7oise is not thrilled with all the disruptions. In between socializing with their gay dentist friend and his partner and quarreling with Jacques, Paul finds time to informally interview and repeatedly question Leullet, Leullet's wife, Leullet's mistress, Leprince's former lover, and many other local denizens. As things become more complicated, family tensions threaten to overwhelm professional obligations. Paul, a professional tough guy, finds himself pondering the meaning of his own life and relationships. Leullet turns himself in to the clueless local police chief who, apparently, has been sleeping with the mistress. He is acquitted at the trial where he is represented (at Bellamy's suggestion) by Leprince's girlfriend's lawyer who renders the defense (also at Bellamy's suggestion) in the form of a Georges Brassens song. (Brassens was a local S\u00e8te hero and had been something of an obsession for Leprince.) Jacques absconds with Paul's car and is soon reported dead in a car crash, but only after Paul has revealed to Fran\u00e7oise the dark secret underlying his fraught relationship with his half-brother and the source of his lifelong tristesse.

One of them reveals herself to be Elena Validus, a childhood friend of Ben and Gwen. Elena explains that she had set up negotiations to lure Ben out into the open to seek his help in finding her abducted scientist father.\nAs Ben agrees to help her, the chips spring to life and attack, controlled by a man on a catwalk. The group fights them, and in the process the suspicious man and the dealers escape. While Elena claims she is not responsible for the attack, Kevin and Gwen are suspicious of her.\nAt their headquarters, the trio, along with Grandpa Max, study one of the chips salvaged from the fight, learning that they are a hybrid of organic and technological components. Elena, having followed the trio, breaks in and Max orders her to leave, explaining that Elena's father, Victor Validus, was an apprentice of his who was dishonorably discharged after stealing the original chips. Ben refuses to believe that Elena is like her father, and breaks ranks with his grandfather and teammates to help her.\nWhile Max is away, Gwen and Kevin investigate Victor Validus and discover a video of Max interrogating Victor, in which Victor insists that \"the Hive\", the mind intelligence behind the chips, is coming to take over the planet as they are revealed to be able to possess people.\nMeanwhile, Ben and Elena arrive at Victor's old laboratory. It has been cleared out by the Hive, but they find evidence that Victor was studying and upgrading the chips. Elena reveals that her father had become erratic before disappearing, and had stopped returning home. He also appears to be the man from the rafters controlling the chips. A mob under the control of the chips ambush Ben and Elena, forcing them to retreat. The Omnitrix again experiences interference around the chips and keeps Ben from transforming, but Ben utilizes a scanning function on it to temporarily repel the mob and allow him and Elena to escape. They head to the Ship-It building to investigate further, though Ben is now somewhat suspicious of Elena himself, realizing the mob expected him and Elena to go to the lab and set a trap for them. Ben finds an order slip made out for that day, when Elena claimed that Victor had already been missing for weeks.\nGwen and Kevin, having reached the building first, are too late to stop the distribution of the chips. Instead, they are met by one of the Ship-It employees, who is also under the chips' control. He summons another larger chip swarm, now capable of forming solid, weaponizable shapes, to attack Gwen and Kevin, damaging Kevin's car during a lengthy chase. Ben, upon joining them, uses Humongousaur to defeat the swarm, destroying Kevin's car in the process.\nBy the time they return to headquarters, the chips have spread across the globe, and number in the millions. Gwen realizes the swarm's new ability is a sign that they can adapt to threats and become smarter. The group also deduces the chips have a queen, as the chip's hosts have mentioned her. They believed that they can stop the chips by destroying her, but during their search, Max is possessed. Pulling together, the group notice that while world population centers are all infected, Barren Rock, Missouri, has the highest concentration, an apparent anomaly in their distribution.\nInfiltrating the factory, populated by multiple infected, including Max, the group discovers that the Queen infected Elena's father, and his body is being used as a hive to rapidly mass-produce the chips. Fearing being possessed by the chips while in his alien forms, Ben uses the Omnitrix to transform into a new alien that he calls \"Nanomech\",    but before he could turn into it he was instead shrunken down as a human. He then notices the giant feet of Kevin and Gwen in front of him. Gwen begins to scrap her gigantic heavy foot across the floor which causes a loud scratching sound which goes to show the massive difference in both size and mass between Gwen and now her shrunken cousin. Ben realises that he is small then after a few seconds then finally transforms into Nanomech, which was created by scanning the DNA of the chips. He flies into Victor's head and battles the Queen, who briefly tries to assert dominance on him, though he resists, while Gwen, Kevin, and Elena fight the infected. As the dormant chips in the factory activate, Nanomech uses the chips ability to adapt to overwhelm and destroy the Queen, freeing everyone from the chips' control.\nIn the aftermath, Max, after apologizing to Victor, decides to retire and leave his position as leader to Ben, but Ben refuses to allow him to do so.

The Mask escapes into space as Teridax begins his takeover of the Matoran Universe.\nThe Mask crash lands on the nearby Bara Magna, a remote, decaying wasteland planet filled with scrap parts and burnished metals. A Scarabax beetle watches as the Mask of Life creates a body for Mata Nui, who picks up the Scarabax. The beetle, later named Click, changes into a living shield after touching the mask. Just then, a scorpion-like being called a Vorox attacks Mata Nui. After a short struggle, he manages to break off its stinger and drive it away. Mata Nui takes the stinger as a weapon and encounters a villager named Metus (David Leisure), who warns Mata Nui of the deadly Bone Hunter and Skrall tribes.\nMetus, a recruiter for the Agori natives, takes Mata Nui to the fiery village of Vulcanus, telling the ex-ruler about life on Bara Magna. Local villages scavenge for what remains, building shelters, survival gear and ultimately arenas where they can settle their disputes by putting the best Glatorian, fighters larger in stature than the Agori, from each village against one another. Metus introduces Mata Nui to Raanu (Armin Shimerman), the Agori leader of Vulcanus, during a fight between veteran fighter Strakk (Jeff Glen Bennett) and Vulcanus' troubled prime Glatorian, Ackar (Jim Cummings). Strakk concedes, but illegally attacks Ackar afterwards. Mata Nui intervenes and, though outclassed, accidentally uses his mask to transform the stinger into a sword. He forces Strakk to concede again, befriending Ackar in the process.\nMetus later attempts to recruit Mata Nui as a Glatorian, who refuses. Ackar introduces the hero to Kiina (Marla Sokoloff), a feisty Glatorian from the water village of Tajun.

As his mask seems to work on things that are/were alive and most Glatorian weapons are made of bone or claw, Mata Nui successfully repairs and transforms their weapons, in the process granting the Glatorians elemental abilities of fire, water, and air for Ackar, Kiina, and Gresh respectively.

On that same night, Bone encounters mob boss James and his girlfriend Angela Soto. Bone enters his first underground fight and quickly defeats his opponent with only two kicks. Pinball explains to Bone that Angela was previously married, but James set up her husband Danny on a triple-homicide, sending him to jail.

Crew members spend most of the fully automated flight in deep cryosleep while one person stays awake in 8\u00bd month shifts to monitor the ship.

After meeting with several of the deformed carnies, and getting acquainted with the normal looking, but psychic Samara, Atlas meets with Cap, who takes him into the tent where the creature, a large, winged mammal-like beast, is being kept for the opening show. Atlas, shocked at the beast's hellish appearance and aggressive nature, suggests that it is not safe, but Cap is unconcerned and continues planning the public unveiling. During the opening show, the audience is shocked at the sight of the beast, but the pastor's unruly son Taylor  and his friend Jesse are unimpressed and taunt it by throwing peanuts at it, infuriating the beast enough to break free from its cage and begin terrorizing the carnival before escaping into the woods.\nLater the following night, Taylor and Jesse hide in an old barn in the forest when a feral, blood-covered dog feeding off of a severed foot barks at them, alerting the beast to their location. The beast chases and kills the dog as Taylor and Jesse escape the barn only to get separated; the beast eventually finds Taylor hiding under a bridge and kills and dismembers him as Jesse hides in an old car. The next day, Jesse is found by Atlas and his team, alive but traumatized by the ordeal, while Taylor's mangled remains are found and taken away, which devastates the pastor and drives him insane with grief and rage. Atlas and his deputy find the remains of the man who sold the beast to Cap near the river, having been cut rather than mauled by the beast, determining it to be a homicide; the investigation is witnessed by Cap and Quinn, the latter of whom was responsible for disposing of the body on Cap's orders.

The beast then sets its sights on Cap's carnival once more, only managing to kill one of his carnies, the \"Leopard Woman\", before being driven off by Atlas. Cap later tries once again to recapture the beast by stabbing Quinn to death to attract the beast with his blood. The beast soon arrives and sneaks up from behind Cap, who immediately shoots it with his new tranquilizer darts that \"have enough drugs in them to put an elephant to sleep for a week\", which knocks out the beast once more.\nCap returns to the carnival later that night to retrieve the beast, only to be stopped and arrested by Atlas, who had discovered part of the tranquilizer dart in his deputy's back. The pastor, who wants revenge on the beast and the carnival for the death of his son, knocks Atlas unconscious and locks him up to prevent him from interfering in his vengeance. The pastor cuts out Cap's tongue and prepares to finish him off, but the beast, having awakened from the darts and sensing Cap's blood after Atlas punched him in a fit of rage, arrives at the police station and kills Cap.

The Imperial Japanese Army has just captured Nanjing (or Nanking), capital of the Republic of China. What followed is historically known as the Nanking Massacre, a period of several weeks wherein massive numbers of Chinese prisoners-of-war and civilians were killed by the Japanese military.\nAfter some commanders of the National Revolutionary Army flee Nanking, a Chinese soldier Lieutenant Lu Jianxiong and his comrade-in-arms Shunzi attempt to stop a group of deserting troops from leaving the city, but as they exit the gates, they are captured by Japanese forces that have surrounded the city.\nAs the Japanese comb the city for enemy forces, Superior Private (later Sergeant) Kadokawa Masao and his men are attacked by Lu Jianxiong and a small unit of both regular and non-regular soldiers, who fire at them from buildings. Lu and his companions are eventually forced to surrender as more Japanese troops arrive. The Chinese prisoners-of-war are systematically escorted to various locations to be executed en masse. Shunzi and a boy called Xiaodouzi survive the shootings and they flee to the Nanking Safety Zone, run by the German businessman and Nazi Party member John Rabe and other Westerners. Thousands of Chinese women, children, elderly men and wounded soldiers take refuge in this safety zone. However, the zone is forcefully entered several times by bands of Japanese soldiers intent on making sexual advances on female refugees. Due to the repeated intrusions, the women are urged to cut their hair and dress like men to protect themselves from being raped. A prostitute called Xiaojiang refuses to do so, saying that she needs to keep her hair in order to earn a living.\nMeanwhile, Kadokawa develops feelings for a Japanese prostitute named Yuriko, and struggles to come to terms with the omnipresent violence around him with his own conflicting impulses. Despite his feelings of alienation, Kadokawa brings Yuriko candy and gifts from Japan, and promises to marry her after the war.\nRabe's secretary Tang Tianxiang and a teacher named Jiang Shuyun manage the daily operations of the safety zone. Even though he is in a privileged position, Tang is still unable to protect his young daughter from being thrown out of a window by a Japanese soldier, and his sister-in-law from being raped. When the Japanese officer Second Lieutenant Ida Osamu demands that the refugees provide 100 women to serve as \"comfort women\", Rabe and Jiang tearfully make the announcement to the community. Xiaojiang and others volunteer themselves, hoping that their sacrifice would save the refugees.\nKadokawa meets Xiaojiang and brings her rice but witnesses another soldier raping her as she lies almost lifeless. Later, many \"comfort women\", including Xiaojiang, die from the abuse, and Kadokawa sees their naked bodies being taken away. Kadokawa feels further estranged when he witnesses Ida shooting Tang's sister-in-law May, who has become insane.\nRabe receives an order to return to Germany because his activities in the safety zone are detrimental to diplomatic ties between his country and Japan. Tang and his wife are allowed to leave Nanking with Rabe. However Tang changes his mind at the last moment and trades places with a Chinese soldier pretending to be Rabe's assistant, saying that he wants to stay behind to find May. Mrs Tang reveals that she is pregnant before bidding her husband farewell. Not long after Rabe has left, Ida has Tang executed by firing squad.\nThe Japanese disband the safety zone and start hunting for Chinese men who were previously soldiers, promising that these men would find work and receive pay if they turn themselves in. However, men deemed to be soldiers are huddled into trucks and sent for execution. Shunzi, who survived the earlier mass killings, is physically checked and initially deemed to be a non-combatant, but is later recognised by a Japanese soldier and brought onto a truck as well.\nAfter Minnie Vautrin and other Westerners plead with the Japanese, Ida permits each refugee to choose only one man from the trucks to be saved. Jiang Shuyun rescues a man, pretending to be his wife, and then returns for Shunzi, claiming that he is her husband, while Xiaodouzi acts as their son. Kadokawa sees through Jiang's ruse but does not expose her. Despite this, another Japanese soldier points her out to Ida and the three of them are captured. Shunzi is taken away again, this time together with Xiaodouzi. Jiang, knowing that she will be raped, asks Kadokawa to kill her. He grants her her wish and shoots her, much to his comrades' surprise.\nAfterwards, Kadokawa looks for Yuriko and learns that she has died after leaving Nanking. He says that she was his wife and requests that she be given a proper funeral. As the Japanese perform a dance-ritual to celebrate their conquest of Nanking and honour their war dead, Kadokawa reveals his emotional turmoil over what he has done and witnessed.\nKadokawa and another Japanese soldier march Shunzi and Xiaodouzi out of town to be executed, but to their surprise, Kadokawa releases them instead. Kadokawa tells the other soldier, \"Life is more difficult than death.\" The soldier bows to show his respect for Kadokawa's decision and walks away.

She works as a seamstress for the performers by day and as a cabaret singer by night, singing and dancing with Adrienne a song about a little dog named \"Coco\" that gets lost at the Trocadero in Paris. Gabrielle and Adrienne resist being confused with the hookers whose services are purchased by the male customers of the bar, but they both get the seductive attentions of two older rich men, a baron for Adrienne, and another aristocrat named Balsan for Gabrielle. \"Coco\" becomes Gabrielle's nickname. Adrienne becomes the de facto wife of the baron, who however never marries her, due to his family opposition.\nDeprived of opportunities and driven by an inner drive to make it at all costs, Gabrielle resolves to leave the provincial city and reach Balsan's country estate.

In revenge, Balsan reveals to Gabrielle that Capel is betrothed to a woman in England. Coco decides to continue the liaison with Capel, but with no more illusions about marriage, declaring that she will never get married.\nCapel believes in Coco's talent making hats and dresses and tells her \"There's no one else like you\". Coco continues developing independently her own new vision of how a modern woman should be dressed, in a style that conveys freedom and self-determination, rather than being a man's toy. When she learns that the bank is lending her money for her new business in Paris only thanks to guarantees offered by Capel, she shows aversion, and she insists to deal with the bank by herself, understanding that her independence and her success will not be for real if she depends on a man.

Back in the US, when Joe was still in the biker gang, Colombian drug dealers wanting to collect a debt went to Joe's apartment and fatally shot his brother.

Oleg was part of the coup as well. After the coup failed, special forces raided the Kazov house; in the chaos, Dmitri killed Oleg's mother and then himself.

Filipov comes up with a plan to reunite his old orchestra, composed of old Jewish and Gypsy musicians \u2013 who also have been reduced to making a living as movers or taxi drivers \u2013 to perform in Paris and complete a performance of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto, which was interrupted 30 years earlier by former KGB Agent Ivan Gavrilov, who is enrolled by Filipov in his scheme as the orchestra's manager and is actively and efficiently supporting Filipov's plan, much to the dismay of Aleksandr 'Sasha' Abramovich Grossman (the orchestra's main cellist), because he suspects that Gavrilov has his own agenda for the Paris trip.\nGavrilov and Filipov demand several conditions from the Ch\u00e2telet, that they are forced to accept, since the concert with the Bolshoi is significantly less expensive. One condition is that the solo violinist will be Anne-Marie Jacquet, who famously has never played Tchaikovsky's concerto because she is afraid of it. She has long dreamed of playing it with the Bolshoi and particularly with Filipov, whose fame outside of Russia has not diminished. Her agent, Guyl\u00e8ne de La Rivi\u00e8re, who is also Anne-Marie's adoptive mother, is reluctant to allow that because she is acquainted with Filipov and his past, but Anne-Marie insists, and de la Riviere has no option but to accept. The orchestra is also forced to accept the sponsorship of an open Russian mafia boss who likes to play the cello, despite the fact that he does so terribly and who wants to be part of the orchestra.\nOnce in Paris, the entire orchestra disappears, partying and raising money in other jobs such as taxi drivers, movers or translators. The unprofessionalism of the Russian musicians and Anne-Marie's own impression that the performance serves as a means of catharsis for Filipov forces Anne-Marie to call off her participation in the concert. But Sasha convinces her to come to the theater because the Concert holds the key to Anne-Marie's past and her parents, whom she has never met, and whom she believes to be scientists who died during her infancy in the Alps. As it turns out, Filipov and his wife Irina were best friends of Lea and Yitzhak Strum, also Jewish musicians. Lea was an accomplished violinist and the soloist at the time of the interrupted concert thirty years before in Moscow. After the public humiliation they suffered under Gavrilov and the entire Brezhnev regime, the couple spoke openly against the government on Radio Free Europe, an American radio station that was banned in the former USSR. As a result, they were deported to Siberia, where they spent the rest of their lives. Lea, Anne-Marie's mother, lost her mind and played the Tchaikovsky concert in her imagination every day for her husband until her death in 1981. Her husband died six months later. Guyl\u00e8ne, at the time the representative of a visiting French orchestra, had managed to escape with Baby Anne-Marie hidden in a cello case, at the behest of Irina, Filipov, and Sasha.\nAt the last moment, the entire orchestra, after receiving an SMS message calling them to play in honor of Lea, appears at the Theatre despite the fact that not a single rehearsal has taken place. In the meantime, the real manager of the Bolshoi, who happened to be vacationing in Paris and learned by chance about the concert, appears at the theatre to prevent the performance, but he is intercepted by Gavrilov, who locks him in a broom closet. The concert has a wobbly beginning due to the lack of rehearsals \u2013 even Gavrilov, who actually intended to speak at a Communist Party meeting, asks God to demonstrate his existence by salvaging the situation. However, the orchestra manages to reach Filipov's ideal of spontaneous harmony once Anne-Marie mesmerizes everyone with her magnificent interpretation of the solo part, which she had studied on her mother's annotated score.

As a last-ditch effort, they have found a couples therapy resort named Eden. A deal called the Pelican Package is half the normal cost if they can get three other couples to join them. In their presentation, they show photos of sunlit beaches and beautiful locations. They assure the others that the couples therapy is purely optional.\nDave and Ronnie insist they can't go because of their children, declining the trip. In the middle of the night, Jason sets off their alarm to try to sell the idea of the retreat. The commotion wakes the kids, who overheard their parents' conversations of not being able to go because of them. Fearing their parents are contemplating divorce, the kids have already arranged for Dave's father, Grandpa Jim-Jim to babysit so their parents can go to Eden.\nThe retreat proves to be divided into Eden West and Eden East. West is for couples and uses the tagline \"Stay Together\". East is for singles and uses the tagline \"Come Together\". East and West attendees are not allowed to intermingle.\nUpon arrival at Eden West, the four couples are shown their villas. At dinner, resort host Sctanley informs them 6 a.m. couples therapy, is mandatory. If any couple fails to attend, it will be taken as an indication that they want to leave, and a refund for Eden will be given, although not for their airfare. The group debates what to do. After an indulgent dinner with many delicacies, they decide to put up with \"a couple of hours\" of therapy in order to enjoy the other amenities of the resort.\nIn the morning, each couple meets with an assigned therapist. All four couples are told they have problems, even Ronnie and Dave, who thought they were fine. They endure resort owner Marcel's unusual methods, including swimming with and feeding lemon sharks and yoga sessions with amorous instructor Salvadore.\nOn the fourth night, Trudy escapes to Eden East. The other seven, encouraged by Joey, leave to find her. After Cynthia and Jason argue, the men and women split up. As they try to find their way to the resort, the men end up arguing and pointing out the problems with each other's marriages.\nThe women run into Salvadore who takes them to Eden East. The men find the staff lounge where they find Sctanley playing Guitar Hero. He threatens to report them to Marcel, but Dave challenges him to the game (without telling Sctanley that he has helped produce the game). Sctanley, after losing the wager, directs them to Eden East, even though he knows he was tricked by Dave.\nWhen they arrive, Dave realizes what a good thing he has with Ronnie. He goes with her to be alone at a waterfall. Joey finds Lucy with Salvadore and knocks him out, reuniting with her. Cynthia and Jason share drinks and end up becoming intimate. Shane runs into his ex-wife, who admits she still loves him. Shane tells Trudy to remain in Eden East and enjoy being single, then leaves with his ex-wife.

Many fear they will never see them again, and she assures them she will document where each child is sent to facilitate their reunion with their parents once the war is over. Others bemoan the fact their children will be raised in a faith other than their own and forget their religious beliefs and traditions, but Irena convinces them this is a small price to pay in exchange for keeping them alive.\nAmong those helping Irena is Stefan, a Jewish friend from her university days. He is aware of a few overlooked exits from the ghetto and uses this knowledge to help Irena and others involved with the underground organization \u017begota plan their strategies and devise routes to smuggle the children, some in boxes hidden under bricks on wheelbarrows, others through sewer systems, and still others brazenly escorted through the front door of the city hall hand-in-hand with their savior.\nEventually Irena is arrested by the Gestapo and placed in captivity, where she undergoes interrogation accompanied by torture. However, she refuses to name those who helped her. She is sentenced to death by firing squad, but at the last moment a guard, bribed by the Polish Home Army resistance movement, frees her.

Di Radfield (Juno Temple) has a crush on Miss G, and is the firm favourite and ringleader of her group. When a beautiful Spanish girl named Fiamma Corona (Mar\u00eda Valverde) arrives at the school, Miss G's focus is shifted away from the other girls. It becomes a triangle: Miss G gets increasingly obsessed with Fiamma, Fiamma is disturbed by Miss G and also openly disgusted by the teacher's hypocrisies and deceptions, and Di is terribly jealous and makes Fiamma's life hell.\nMiss G (who claims to be a world traveller) goes to a nearby parochial town to buy some provisions. She  draws the unwanted attention of some local louts and is visibly upset and in a near-panic when she returns to the school.\nThe bullying culminates in Di physically throwing Fiamma out of the school but, unable to return to Spain as she hoped, Fiamma returns later that night.\nDi and Fiamma begin to develop a friendship. Fiamma faints at a dorm party, and Miss G takes her to her own room, where she rapes her while she is passed out. Di witnesses this and flees.\nThe next morning, Fiamma is visibly upset, and Miss G is equally distressed as she runs around after her. Di is broody, and eventually tells the rest of her gang that Fiamma seduced Miss G. Fiamma presumably tells Miss G that she will report the molestation to the teachers, and horrified, Miss G realises her career will be over. She in turn manipulates Di's affection for her into anger. She says that Fiamma will make up lies about her molesting her (even though it was true) and plans to get her kicked out of school. Di absolutely refuses to allow this to happen.\nThe confrontation between Di's gang and Fiamma turns ugly as Fiamma declines to answer Di's vicious questions and tries to explain what really happened, hinting at Miss G's lies and character defects. Fiamma runs into the forest as things become more violent, but the girls catch up with her and, under Di's leadership, beat her with their sticks and fists. Fiamma starts to have an asthma attack, and the girls stop, terrified. They run to get help, and Di runs into Miss G (who had been watching the beating and the chase that ensued quietly and with no attempt to stop the beating), who says she'll stay with Fiamma, and directs Di to go get a teacher.\nIn the forest, Miss G, alone with Fiamma, refuses to give Fiamma her inhaler and calmly watches her die.

He teaches her much about nature and science, including his theory of evolution, and tells her stories of his travels. Her favourite story, despite the sad ending, is about the young orangutan Jenny, who is brought from Borneo to the London Zoo, where she finally died of pneumonia in the arms of her keeper. Darwin is furious when he learns that the family clergyman has made Annie kneel on rock salt as punishment for contradicting him about dinosaurs, which she takes as having become extinct long ago. This contradicts their church's position that life is unchanging and that the Earth is very young -- Young Earth Creationism being a then-recent heresy taken as dogma by Seventh-day Adventists.\nHaving returned from his expedition in the Galapagos Islands 15 years earlier, Darwin is still trying to finish a manuscript about his findings, which will articulate his theory of evolution. The delay is caused by anxiety about his relationship with his devoutly religious wife, Emma, who fundamentally opposes his ideas, which pose a threat to established Anglican theology. Emma worries that she may go to heaven and he may not, separating them for eternity.\nThe film shows Annie, through flashbacks and Darwin's hallucinations, as a vibrant apparition who goads her father to address his fears and finish his big work. It is apparent that Annie has died, and that her death is a taboo subject between Darwin and Emma, as both feel intense blame for her death. As a result of the strained relations between Charles and Emma, they entirely stop having sex. Anguished, Darwin begins to suffer from a mysterious, fatiguing illness.\nIt is revealed that after Annie becomes ill in 1851, Darwin takes her to the Worcestershire town of Malvern for James Manby Gully's water cure therapy, against Emma's will. Annie's condition worsens, and she ultimately dies after her father, at her request, tells her Jenny's story once more. Darwin is devastated, and her death sharpens his conviction that natural laws operate without divine intervention. To his contemporaries, this is an idea so dangerous it seems to threaten the existence of God (in reality, Darwin's biggest supporters were believers). In a box in Darwin's study, we discover the notes and observations that will become On the Origin of Species.\nHaving read his 230 page synopsis, Darwin's friends in the scientific community, Joseph Dalton Hooker and Thomas Henry Huxley, also encourage him. Huxley admiringly tells Darwin that with his theory he has \"killed God\", which fills Darwin with dread. In his hallucinations, he also feels that Annie disapproves of his procrastination.\nDarwin receives a letter from Alfred Russel Wallace in 1858, which details the same findings as Darwin in 20 pages. He has mixed feelings about this; all his work may have been in vain, but on the other hand, as he will not have to write his book, the discord with Emma will heal. However, Darwin's friends urge him to continue, as his book is much more comprehensive.\nAfter receiving treatment at Malvern himself, Darwin makes a pilgrimage to the hotel where Annie died. The journey marks a change in him; upon his return home, he is able to reconnect with his wife, and they speak to each other for the first time of their fears and grief over Annie's death. They specifically speak about the possibility that Annie died because she was genetically weak, as Darwin and Emma are first cousins.

She asks their 6-year-old son Dinu (Aman Attar) to keep a watch on Kisna, and report any irregular behavior. Kisna is however imbued by the thoughts of the arrival of the Monsoon.\nDuring these days, Alka tries her best by preparing Puran Poli amongst other myriad efforts to keep Kisna in good spirit. However, Kisna being inherently stronger than his peer farmers, albeit aloof, is often annoyed by the overt and misplaced concern of his wife.\nPawning jewelry, Kisna purchases cotton seeds from Nagpur City, intending to sow them when the rains arrive. The seeds fail to germinate, due to the late arrival of the monsoons and this is the only time in the entire movie Kisna contemplates suicide, by consuming pesticide. However, Alka sells other jewelry and purchases a fresh set of seeds, which are sowed. Due to the vagaries of the rain, Kisna is able to reap only two quintals of cotton, which is taken away by the money-lender/cotton trader, leaving Kisna's family with nothing.\nMeanwhile, Kisna, with his indefatigable spirit, goes to a bank in the city, takes a loan and installs a bore-well in his farm, despite the perpetual pessimism of Patil. The bore-well itself doesn't work to its potential due to the erratic power supply, typical of the hinterlands of Vidarbha. At this stage, Patil gives Kisna the idea of drawing electric power from the Electric power transmission lines.\nKisna never gives up even till the end, where ill-advised, he naively tries to tap electric power from the high voltage Electric power transmission lines to power his water pump of the recently installed bore-well and loses his life by electrocution.", "tmdb_id": 170989}, "14812466": {"title": "The Damned United", "plot": "After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's long-time assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him.\nThe roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumed Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, and made many preparations for the match. However, on the day of the match, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2\u20130. Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted, but in their first league game against Leeds they lose 5\u20130. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to secure his position by offering his and Taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwillingness to fund further signings. He is outraged when the directors accept their resignations and ban them from entering the Baseball Ground again (although Clough later sneaks in as a supporter). Derby fans' protests raise Clough's hopes of being reinstated, and he is backed by the majority of his players as well, but former player Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca. During the holiday that summer, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representative. Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways.\nBack in the storyline's \"present\u201d: Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by accusing them of winning all of their awards by cheating, and then making them start with a 7-a-side game as if they were schoolchildren. When Bremner protests that Revie never made them do this, Clough reminds them that he is not Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager's name or methods again.\nThe season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool at Wembley, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when the Leeds captain Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract after just 44 days - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face-to-face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being 'cold-hearted' and 'fundamentally dishonest', both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as 'inflexible and egocentric'. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally getting on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, and they are reconciled.\nIn the film's epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie \"failed as England manager\", and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the Middle East, where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor, meanwhile, reunited at the \"small, provincial club\" Nottingham Forest, where they repeated their prior achievements with Derby by helping them win promotion to the First Division and then winning the title. They went on to better both Revie and their own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession, in 1979 and 1980.

After three months of inactivity, human investigators find over one million malnourished aliens (called \"prawns\") inside, and the South African government relocates them to a terrestrial camp called District 9. However, over the years, it has turned into a slum, and locals from Earth often complain that the aliens are filthy, ignorant lawbreakers who bleed resources from humans.\nFollowing unrest between the aliens and locals, the government hires Multinational United (MNU), a huge weapons manufacturer, to relocate the aliens to a new camp outside the city. Piet Smit, an MNU executive, appoints MNU employee and his son-in-law Wikus van de Merwe to lead the relocation. Meanwhile, three aliens, Christopher Johnson, his young son CJ, and Christopher's friend Paul, search a District 9 garbage dump for alien fuel in Prawn technology, which Christopher has had them spend the last twenty years synthesizing enough of to enact his plan. They finally finish in Paul's shack, but when Wikus comes to the shack to serve Paul a relocation notice, Wikus finds the hidden container with the fuel and accidentally sprays some of it in his face while confiscating it.

He is taken to a hospital, where his left hand is now discovered to have become a prawn claw, and transferred to the MNU lab, where researchers perform brutal experiments. They find out his chimeric DNA grants him the ability to operate Prawn weaponry, which only works with the aliens' biology. Wanting to capture this human/alien hybrid before Wikus fully transforms, Smit orders Wikus's body to be vivisected and harvested for its properties. Wikus overpowers the lab personnel and escapes.

Christopher explains to Wikus that the confiscated fuel is crucial to his plan of reactivating the dropship. If he can get them in the dropship to the mothership, he can cure Wikus and reverse his physical transformation. Wikus attempts to acquire weapons from the District 9 Nigerian arms dealer Obesandjo, who wants to eat Wikus's alien arm because he believes it will grant him alien abilities. Wikus, however, seizes an alien weapon and, able to use it, escapes with a collection of weapons he and Christopher can use to attempt the retrieval of the alien fuel.\nWikus and Christopher then force their way through MNU to the lab and retrieve the fuel. However, after seeing the barbaric experiments MNU has performed on his people in the lab (including a dissected Paul), Christopher tells Wikus he must return home as fast as possible for help and cannot undo Wikus' mutation until he returns in three years, due to the limited supply of the fuel. Enraged, Wikus knocks Christopher down and attempts to fly the dropship module to the mothership himself, but Koobus Venter's forces shoot it down. Venter captures Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes the MNU convoy, seizes Wikus, and brings him to Obesandjo, who prepares to chop off Wikus' prawn arm.\nMeanwhile, remaining hidden in the dropship, CJ remotely activates the mothership and a large mechanized battle suit located in Obesandjo's base. The suit guns down the Nigerians, and Wikus enters the suit and rescues Christopher from the mercenaries.

West shoots the rattlesnake's rattler off and it retreats into the bushes, and diagnoses and fixes Silver's dislocated arm. Silver asks him if he's a doctor, but West denies it.\nSilver tells West that the bandits headed for Holysand, the nearest town. They arrive in Holysand to witness a conflict between Silver's stepfather, rancher Nathan Mitchell (Boots Southerland) and rival rancher Victor Baker (Adam Taylor) over a large quantity of seed. The argument is broken up by Sheriff Roy Basehart (Paul Sorvino) and the local school teacher Denise Stark (Clare Carey).\nNathan's ranch hand, Garvey (Alessio di Clemente) orders Silver to clean it up.\nWest walks into the saloon, drawing the attention of the room, first as a stranger in town, and then by ordering tea rather than whiskey, which the patrons see as weakness. Garvey offers him a seat and a round of poker. West hustles Garvey, who accuses him of cheating, and challenges him to a duel. Basehart arrests West and locks him up and Garvey keeps West's money. News of West helping Silver spreads, and his reputation is further improved when he identifies the sheriff's boots as the source of his back pain.\nThe next morning Nathan's daughter, Millie (Mary Petruolo) who West met in the post office, arrives in Holysand and is greeted by her childhood friends Burt Baker (Micah Alberti) and Jack Baker (Linus Huffman). The sheriff has no more back pain due to his new boots. West also gives Stark a remedy to heal her sick friend. Millie reunites with her grandmother Melody, Nathan, and Silver. Nathan tells Jack and Burt to stay away from Millie because of his rivalry with their father. After a conversation with the sheriff, Nathan leaves but not before Silver gives West an apple pie (which they talked about earlier in the film).\nWest and the sheriff play a game of poker. After the sheriff wins, West tells him that he was a doctor, but he accidentally killed a patient while drunk. He also says that he takes care of her daughter, Estrella who he sends money to every month. He still continues to doctor, but vowed never to drink or touch a scalpel. The Baker brothers set the seed salesman Sam's (Harry Zimmerman) clothes on fire and are arrested, causing the town to laugh. West is released and with the help of Nathan, gets his money back from Garvey. Millie learns about Nathan's marriage to a woman named Dana, upsetting her. He also explains that the Bakers are their enemies, as they fight over a piece of land. Victor's barn mysteriously burns down. He blames Nathan and bails his sons out of jail.\nIn Santa Fe West is going to send money to Estrella and the bank teller declares they are all marked with \"E\" (for Estrella) and West realizes something. Meanwhile, Millie wants her father and Victor to get along and asks help from Stark. West tells the sheriff that Garvey gave him the stolen money, indicating that Garvey was one of the bandits in Santa Fe. West gets a room at the saloon and plans to stay until Garvey is behind bars. Millie talks with Burt and Jack and decide to keep their friendship a secret from their fathers.\nStark's dog, Big steals West's pan of beans and leads him to her house. He eventually lets Big have them and for the first time, the dog shows affection towards anyone. West and Stark have dinner and West retires. The next morning Millie thinks that Nathan burned down the Baker's barn and storms off. Nathan discovers that the water pump for his cattle is sabotaged, causing him to think Victor did it. Silver tells West that Garvey was not in Holysand the day of the robbery that he takes three days off every month. Victor challenges Nathan to a gunfight but West shoots the guns out of their hands. Garvey attempts to challenge West, but the sheriff stops him.\nWest decides to settle who claims the land by a boxing in the center of Holysand. Victor and Nathan refuse, but the sheriff reminds that blood will be spilled if they don't agree.\nWest teaches Burt and Jack along with their friend Larry exercise before boxing. Burt and Millie's friendship turns into a romance, causing Jack to be jealous. Burt can only kick but not box and Jack takes his anger out on the beanbag that they punch. Jack is so strong that a beam comes down and knocks West unconscious. Stark nurses West back to health and West continues training the Bakers. The sheriff tells West that every time Garvey took days off there were robberies, confirming Garvey was one of the thieves.\nAt the tournament there are no guns or eye-gouging allowed. The fight begins and the Bakers win.\nGarvey sneaks off to his horse and reveals a stashed gun under his saddle. This reveals that Garvey burned Victor's barn down and sabotaged Nathan's water pump to cause conflict.\nHe puts on his gun belt and challenges West again to a gunfight. West shoots him and walks away. Garvey survives and tries to kill him, but Silver jumps in front of him and takes the bullet. West shoots and kills Garvey.\nWest refuses to do surgery after Estrella's mother died at his hands, but Stark encourages him to do so. Silver is saved and Nathan thanks him. West is self-awakened and he and Stark share a kiss. West leaves the next morning, but a Mexican farmer asks for help. His wife is in labor and is dying.

Claire drugs him and steals classified documents from him.\nThree years later in Rome, Ray and Claire meet for the first time since Dubai and spend several days together at a posh hotel. They imagine leaving their government jobs for work in an intensely competitive area in the private sector. They contemplate using their skills in intelligence to enrich themselves. After exploring possibilities over several months, including companies vying for the market in double-crust pizza, they settle on cosmetics and personal hygiene.

His laziness is portrayed in the film as not a quality but as an ethic imbibed within his general thoughts and notions of the everyday world that surrounds him. Through his formative years, his thinking becomes pragmatic in considering that livelihood can always be sought through alternate sources rather than being a puppet to how the world goes about through linear methods of gaining success and money. The other essentially important character in the film is a visually impaired person named Naani (played by Tabla Naani). Although being born blind, he wishes to be a film director. Naani's most positive aspect of the role is that he does not believe that his physical disability could stop him from achieving what he dreams, that is to be a filmmaker. The film is structured around the lengthy conversation, which happens in a captive lodge room, between Manja and Naani where each depicts their ideologies and experiences and co-relate their thoughts. Being a Jaggesh film, the film is nowhere short in containing blatant satirical humour and constant metaphors. The characters of Manja and Naani form contrasting personalities - Manja being an unmotivated, lazy and irresponsible guy and Naani being optimistic and ambitious. Naani happens to meet Manja is a very interesting scenario. Even with their contrasting personalities, Manja and Naani get along together pretty well.\nThe other important, yet minimally portrayed, the role is of Manja's wife Gowri (played by Yagna Shetty). Manja admittedly marries Gowri in the fact that he was getting a small house as a dowry. Gowri struggles to save her relationship while Manja is doused into the casual habits of alcohol, his influential \"circle\" of friends, betting, occasional petty thieving at random jobs, inability to sustain decent jobs, wife-bitching and other habits including schemes that eventually thicken the gap between living a moral and meaningful life and being an incapable disloyal husband. However, Gowri's character is portrayed to be of a devout woman who honours the capacity of developing a more healthy family hood through her husband changing his ways someday or the other. But days and years go on and Manja's lifestyle remains unchanged much to the chagrin of Gowri.\nThe conversation now continues shifting from the lodge to Manja's home itself. After celebrating their freedom from the lodge with alcoholism that night they find themselves again captive within the house due to the help of the local inspector who assists Gowri to tackle Manja's unyielding ways. Naani then talks about the plot of his film, which was seemingly ignored by the producer with whom he had placed his trust upon (and for the reason with which he ended up being captive in the lodge). Manja, hearing of the simple story of Dr Rajkumar's pledged eyes and how they were now seeing a world through another person, is taken aback and applauds Naani for such a heartwarming plot and how the -Annavru-'s fans would welcome such a movie. He motivates Naani with all success if Naani ever made the film by taking out his mother's prized 50 rupee note from the cupboard and giving it to Naani. He tells Naani that it was considered as a lucky charm to any person that received it. He also happens to find a note in the cupboard that Gowri leaves behind (after her inability to tell him personally that night due to his inebriated state) to Manja conveying that she was now carrying and that he would soon become a father. Manja's personality suddenly defines a change after reading the news. He is unable to express his joy, apart from sharing it with Naani, at that moment being locked in his home. He tries calling Gowri but he doesn't get her on-line. In the midst of all this, there concocts a life turning situation for Manja at that moment. His wife returns home struck in pain. Gowri had killed the developing child in her womb due to the burdensome worry which she concluded that she wasn't in a state to be able to maintain and grow a child while having such a lackluster and incapable husband. She perceived that it was best for the child to not come to life and face a deteriorated lifestyle. Naani leaves the house expressing his ill-timed presence in the development of such an event. Manja is clipped between a moment of where he faced fresh joy like he had not known for a long long time where he believed that the child, who would be his Lakshmi (the Goddess of wealth), would change his life for the better and to another moment that his 'Lakshmi' would not be happening. In his state of hopelessness, he threatens Gowri as to what rights she held to kill his child. Gowri is throbbing in pain to be able to reply to his questions. In this delusion of Manja, Lakshmi -the unborn child, appears to him and speaks to him as to how ill-fated she would have been to have been born as a daughter to such a father. Lakshmi says that Gowri, her mother, did not kill her and that Manja, her father, killed her and suggests to him that he could celebrate this occasion with his friends by drinking along with them. Manja's remorse knows no bounds. He reflects back Lakshmi's words to Gowri and says to his wife that neither his own parents nor his own wife or any of his gurus could ever be a guru to him, but the unborn dead child which will never happen in his existence was his ultimate guru to his final immediate realization of the value of life.", "tmdb_id": 826181}, "25412715": {"title": "Eden Is West", "plot": "Elias (Riccardo Scamarcio) is an immigrant in his twenties who tries to get to Europe by a boat along with other illegal immigrants. When the boat is near the Greek shores and they hope they will soon  disembark, a marine patrol approaches and  Elias jumps into the sea in order to avoid arrest. So do the other people in the boat. He wakes up next morning in a shore with nudists, which is not so bad after all, since he has lost some of his clothes while he was swimming for quite a few hours. He pretends to be a nudist himself, steals some clothes and he pretends he is an employee of the hotel \"Eden Club-Paradise\". Some residents consider him to be an employee and some others a client like themselves. He meets a magician (Ulrich Tukur) who hires him for a few tricks and since Elias is fairly good, Nick Nickelby, as the magician is called in the movie, tells him \"if you find yourself in Paris, come and find me\".

Going to Paris becomes an obsession.\nIn the meantime nasty things happen to him: he is raped by the manager of the hotel and in another occasion he is obliged to clean a toilet with his hands because a tenant considers him to be a plumber. He also happens to witness the arrest of a friend of his, an illegal immigrant, who is discovered hiding near the hotel.

A man takes advantage of his ignorance and says he will take him to Paris as long as he shares the expenses. Elias wants to prove he can afford it and shows an envelope where he keeps his money.

Also, when he tries to eat in the same restaurant with the local employees he is pushed back and this racist episode compels him to run away again.\nHe ends up in a village hungry and without proper clothes. He steals a jacket but he is found out and is again on the run while somebody cries \"damned gypsies\".  Some gypsies think he is a gypsy and they help him picking him up with their truck. They show him the way for Paris laughing at him for his dream. When he leaves he sees two other trucks approaching the encampment and questioning the gypsies where the thief they\u2019ve just helped is hiding. They are friends of the man from whom he had stolen the jacket. They leave after they throw a petrol bomb in one of their trailers.\nElias, on the run again, finds himself in a village where he meets a compatriot. This is the only time that his mother language is heard. The other immigrant is disillusioned from the \"West\" and says he is heading back to his country, because there are no jobs in Paris, he  does not have any savings, and life back home seems better. He sleeps in a refuge with other homeless people, who steal his jacket. The next day he is heading for Paris and finds club \"Lido\".\nFinally he finds the magician giving a performance from a beautiful, red Citroen DS cabriolet in the street.

Elias runs after the magicians car and cries  \"Mister\" and when the magicians driver  stops, the young immigrant tells him \"don\u2019t you recognise me? You once told me that if I found myself in Paris, I should come and see you\". The magician stares at him and says \"Aha, so you\u2019ve done both. You came in Paris and you also saw me\". He then gives him a small toy magic wand and leaves. Elias, embarrassed, points the wand awkwardly toward the Eiffel Tower and by chance the lights on the Tower are lit.

Telling her that he is a music lover and that he is worried about her cello getting wet, David convinces Jenny to put her cello in his car while she walks alongside. As the rain becomes stronger, Jenny asks David if she can sit inside his car.

An investigation of her death is done by Assistant Commissioner of Police Vasudevan (Aadhi), who is an honest and upright police officer and also Ramya's former lover. Although circumstantial evidence claims it was a suicide, Vasu doubts that it is not and starts to investigate from another angle.\nThe investigation reveals that Ramya was having an extramarital affair with an unknown person, and his frequent visits to her flat are confirmed by the neighbors in Ramya's apartment building. However, Vasu is not convinced, sure that there is someone behind Ramya's death and names him Mr. X. He also remembers his love life with Ramya during their college years. Vasu was denied marriage with Ramya by her father Shriraman (Rajashekar) as he was not willing to get his daughter married to a police officer. When Vasu asked her to marry him without the consent of her father, she refused, and they parted ways. Later, Ramya married a rich businessman Balakrishnan (Nandha). From then on, the relationship was entirely cut between Vasu and Ramya. Vasu then became a police officer.\nMeanwhile, strange mishaps begin to take place in the apartment where Ramya died. Kalyani Subramanyam (Lakshmi Ramakrishnan), who resides in the flat opposite to Ramya's, dies by electric shock. An ex-army veteran, Thiyagarajan (Boys Rajan), on his travel to Pondicherry, dies when an umbrella tip pierces his neck. The apartment watchman also dies a mysterious death. Vasu connects the deaths to Ramya but does not know how exactly. He finds that water is the common element in all the deaths. He appoints a few assistants to live in various flats of the apartment and inform him if there is any suspicious activity. The assistants point out a young man (Krishna) coming there to meet his girlfriend Deepa. Vasu identifies him as Mr. X and follows him to a theater, but before he can catch him, he sees \"Mr. X\" banging his head into the restroom mirror. Vasu tries to stop him, but an eerie spirit stops him from saving Mr. X. Vasu then sees human footprints walking on water and understands that it is the work of a supernatural entity.\nThe color red and water keep appearing together as premonitions and signals to Vasu that a murder is about to take place. He is unable to convince his superiors that the deaths are not accidental. Vasu investigates in the angle of life after death, and finds that a spirit can contact this world in any medium after the death. It may also be through water. Vasu realizes that Ramya's spirit killed everyone.

Bala was a person who disliked anything secondhand in his life. He could not digest his wife's past relation with her lover Vasu, and hence started to torture her. Ramya's maidservant complained of Thiyagarajan in another flat as he had been sexually harassing her. Ramya warned Thiyagarajan that if he repeated this, she would inform it to his wife. Ramya also advised Deepa to stop having a boyfriend (Mr. X) as it would spoil her life, and this earned her Deepa's dislike. Ramya's opposite apartment neighbor Kalyani wanted the flat where Ramya lived, for her daughter. Mr. X created an impression that he had come to visit Ramya to Kalyani. She had spun a false story against Ramya, and Thiyagarajan also confirmed it to Bala as revenge. Therefore, Bala killed Ramya and drowned her in the water to make it look like a suicide.\nHence, Ramya's soul killed Kalyani by electric shock; Thiyagarajan by the umbrella tip; the watchman who supported the false statement against Ramya; Mr. X by dashing him in the mirror; and now, she traumatizes Deepa, which leaves the girl mentally unstable, yet she survives.

At the fight, Bala initially gains the upper hand, hits Vasu mercilessly with an iron rod on his head, and then stabs Vasu in his stomach with his own machete.

Guarding it is Velicity's partner, Larnell's grandfather Cyril, who is inexplicably out of his wheelchair and able to walk. Larnell and Rabbit go inside the hut where Velicity explains that her father uncovered a prehistoric strain of marijuana cultivated by an ancient people, \"the Poontang Tribe\". She has found that the marijuana can be used to help cure people of health problems and severe injuries-explaining how Cyril is able to walk again-and Velicity is planning on donating the marijuana to help cancer patients. Bachman suggests that the marijuana could help them with their extreme side effects, so they smoke some and it seems to work.\nLarnell pulls out leftover pieces of Eebee's face which Velicity immediately recognizes as Poontang craftsmanship. Eebee is brought back to life by the ancient marijuana smoke and Velicity takes the pieces to Cyril. She overhears a phone call between Cyril and a potential buyer, so she confronts him. He chastises her for her naivety, and she runs off upset. Having heard Cyril's plan, Eebee offers her help if he helps restore her original form, which Cyril does. Rabbit shows up and tries to cut a distribution deal with Cyril, threatening to expose Cyril's intended operation if he does not cut him in, when three Poontang Tribeswomen appear behind them, holding spears. They attack Cyril (who runs off) and capture Rabbit and Eebee. The three women bring Rabbit and Eebee to King Bong even larger, skull-shaped bong with eyes. They place Eebee on an altar next to King Bong and they argue, revealing a past relationship. The women \u201cforce\u201d Rabbit to smoke from the King Bong and he enters the Bong World. Cyril returns to the hut, bleeding, where he tells the others what happened. Larnell, Velicity, Alister, Bachman and Brett head out to save Rabbit leaving Cyril behind.\nThey find King Bong and theorize that he is more powerful than Eebee and has ability to pull a person's whole being into the Bong World, not just their soul. Eebee, still being bitter from King Bong's implied infidelity, tells them they have to destroy his \u201csymbol\u201d, a necklace and the source of his power. Bachman and Brett enter the Bong World (this time a jungle) and are danced on by two mostly nude tribeswomen before being tied up and brought before King Bong with Rabbit. Larnell and Alister enter find the tribe rolling Rabbit up in giant paper, turning him into a massive joint that King Bong shrinks down to a normal size with his necklace. They untie Bachman and Brett and the group attacks the tribe while Larnell shatters the necklace, destroying King Bong and sending them out of the Bong World. They all walk off, ignoring Eebee's angry cries to them not to leave her on the altar alone. The film ends with everyone smoking in Larnell's dorm, everything back to normal.", "tmdb_id": 20029}, "23943222": {"title": "Evil Things", "plot": "Five college students leave New York City for a weekend in the country, and 48 hours later they vanished without a trace.\nTo celebrate Miriam's (Elyssa Mersdorf) birthday, Miriam's Aunt Gail (Gail Cadden) gives her use of a large country home in the Catskills for the weekend.

As they are driving away, a girl from inside the gas station stops them to hand over a phone Cassy left in the bathroom. The group continue to Aunt Gail's home and are again tailed by the van. They stop at a diner and while eating, the van pulls into the diner parking lot and drives slowly by the window. Furious, Mark storms outside to confront the driver but he drives away when Mark gets too close.\nThe group eventually make it to the house and Aunt Gail comes to turn the power on and wish them a good night. The five surprise Miriam with a birthday cake and then party and drink with Leo filming the whole occasion.\nThe next day, the group take a hike to the snowy woods which they soon get lost in the dark. They hear noises that they can't identify, crackling sounds on their two-way-radio and branches snapping which scares them all into a run. They do eventually make it back to the house without further incident. Later when eating dinner, they receive phone calls with no one answering. A knock at the door is heard and Mark finds a video tape wrapped in brown paper on the front step.\nThe tape reveals that the group have been being secretly video taped since they were on the road, and are being stalked by the same person in the maroon van.

Miriam finally gets a signal on her phone and dials 9-1-1, but the call drops out.\nDown the hall, the group hear a noise. Mark gets a knife and goes to investigate. He finds a two way radio that is on and crackling. The door suddenly shuts from the inside and Mark's cries of pain can be heard. Cassy bangs on the door and tries to open it, and then it opens just a crack which scares the group into running upstairs to hide.\nUpstairs, the group see the van driving away from the house so they come back downstairs to leave. Leo gives the camera to Tanya and leads the way out, but once outside he sees something that makes him scream at the others to run back inside. Once inside, Tanya falls breaking the camera and all left is the audio sound of Tanya screaming and her and Leo's fate is left unknown.\nOn the video footage of the van outside, Miriam is shown to be running from the house. The van turns on its lights and creeps along to follow her. The van stops and the stalker gets out and chases a screaming Miriam into the woods.\nBack inside the house, the other stalker is looking around the house for Cassy with his nightvision on the camera. He finds Cassy hiding behind a couch and, believing she is alone, creeping out wandering blindly around the home. The stalker follows her watching how far she will get. Cassy gets to the door but, it is pulled shut from the outside, and the camera man makes the same sound the group heard in the woods alerting Cassy of his presence.

Under increasing social, commercial and family pressure, Aaron tries to break off ties with Ezri but is unable to bring himself to do so. Confronted by Rabbi Vaisben, Aaron is unabashed, feeling alive only now. Ezri encounters his former lover outside the synagogue, in the attempt to confrontate him about the flyers, which escalates into Ezri being attacked by some locals. Aaron witnesses the attack but does not intervene. He consoles Ezri afterwards, but they both realize it is time for Ezri to leave the community. Aaron continues to be distressed by this, asking for Rivka's understanding and protection. He returns early one morning to the spot where he took a bath with Ezri. He submerges himself beneath the water for a prolonged period before the camera fades to black.

The Dean recognizes him as an irresponsible student who rarely attended his lectures. He further tells him that he used to date Mona who is on the contrary: a brilliant girl. The Dean asks him where he has been posted to; \"Araromire\", he replied. The Dean picks interest and brings out a book. He starts to narrate the folk story about the village and the goddess it was named after.

Femi and Sola arrive at the Araromire Shrine to return the figurine; rain starts to fall and Femi is nowhere to be found. While Sola is busy looking for Femi, Femi kills him by hitting him with a log of wood. Femi returns to Lagos and he is confronted by Linda, whom Lara has already confessed to. Femi confirms the truth by revealing many things which proves that the whole Araromire good luck and bad luck was all a charade orchestrated by him in order to kill Sola and get Mona all to himself. He terms the losing of their jobs, his father's death and his asthma 'coincidence'. He kills Linda afterwards and dumps her body in the lagoon. On his way back, he has his asthma attack and commands Lara to bring him his inhaler, but she refuses; instead, she calls the 'Rapid Response Squad' to report her brother's killings.

Bex compliments Dom's courage, saying that he has a lot of guts to walk in and face him. Dom later finds out where Bex works and goes to visit him. They become acquaintances, visiting a sports shop where Bex purchases a pair of Adidas Munchen trainers. He then asks Dom if he wants to play in his football team. Dom accepts. Dom asks his Dad for money to buy the same pair of trainers.\nDom arrives late at the football game and is put in goal. After he saves a vital penalty, the rest of the boys begin to take a liking to him, especially Jay, who asks if he is coming to Portsmouth at the weekend. Dom agrees. Trigger, the firm's second-in-command, visits Bex at work, where he tells him that Millwall's firm and Portsmouth's firm are meeting to discuss the up-and-coming matches between the three teams. Bex walks in on the meeting to pitch his idea of the three firms coming together to form a national firm for the UEFA European Football Championship. The pitch fails, with Millwall and Portsmouth's top boys refusing to stand behind Bex in the national firm unless he and his firm can beat theirs in the upcoming meets. Saturday comes and the firm are at the station getting a train to Portsmouth. When they get there they meet the Portsmouth firm at the pub. Police arrive and try to break up the two teams. During the brawl, Dom is punched in the face but stays on his feet and punches back.\nBex visits Dom at work and tells him to not make any plans for the weekend. Dom sees Tel who criticises his tracksuit, but Dom tells him that he is part of the West Ham firm now. Dom later meets Jay, and the two go to the sports shop and steal a load of gear. Some of the firm go to Bex's house to talk about the possible national firm. Bex asks Dom if he would like to go to Europe, and Dom agrees. Bex says he has to get blooded first, which means he has to get the firm's symbol engraved on his forearm. Bex pulls out a Stanley knife and starts to engrave on Dom's arm. When the rest of the firm lick their hands and rub off the symbol that is on their arms he realises that it is a joke.\nDom goes to the Lord Nelson to meet up with the boys. Soon after arriving, he is harshly ridiculed in front of everyone by a drunken Trigger for wearing the same tracksuit as Bex. Feeling forlorn, Dom leaves the pub and doesn't to go the game. Bex then visits him at work the next day and tells him to stand up for himself, and invites him to a night club. Dom also gets invited to Crystal Palace on the weekend, but the firm end up going to Millwall to launch a surprise attack on the Millwall firm instead. Millwall fights back with weapons and largely outnumbers them. As a result, the surprise attack fails and they suffer a humiliating defeat. Bex, along with Dom and some other members of the West Ham firm, go back later and ambush a Millwall fan as he leaves the pub, beating him half to death with lead pipes. They return home only to find that their cars have been smashed up. A calling card has been placed on Bex's car saying \"Congratulations, you have just met the Yeti\" (the Yeti is a nickname for the Millwall firm leader).\nSome of the firm express that they are not happy with Bex's reckless leadership in refusing to back down over the feud with the Yeti, and are ultimately forced by Bex to leave the firm. When Bex brings a bag full of blunt weapons to the Lord Nelson in preparation for a revenge attack on the Yeti and his firm, Dom expresses his concerns as well. Bex reacts angrily, bullying and threatening Dom and telling him that he has no choice but to stay with the firm. They go from the Lord Nelson to London Bridge station and ambush the rival firm. Dom looks on as Bex overpowers the Yeti and kicks him savagely in the head and body repeatedly as he lies on the floor. As Bex walks away, the Yeti pulls a flick knife out of his sock and stabs Bex in the stomach. Off-screen, Bex eventually succumbs to the wound.\nThat night, the police are seen arriving at Bex's house. His wife answers the door angrily with the baby in her arms. From the police's silence, she knows Bex has been killed and tearfully goes into denial.\nIn the epilogue, Dom puts on the red tracksuit that Bex told him to never wear again, and heads to the Lord Nelson one last time. He looks through the window and sees that the firm are enjoying themselves and do not appear to be mourning Bex, with Trigger now seemingly in charge. Dom sees this as his chance to get out for good. He walks away from the pub and bumps into Tel.

Odusami identifies it as Sumerian.\nAnother patient, Scott, wishes to communicate. He admits that there was no owl and speaks of \"them,\" but cannot remember anything further and begs Abbey to come to his home to hypnotize him. Under hypnosis, he suddenly jerks upright and begins hovering above his bed, while a voice speaking through Scott orders Abbey in Sumerian to immediately end her study. Later, Sheriff August arrives, telling her that Scott is completely paralyzed from the neck down. Believing Abbey is responsible, August tries to arrest her but Campos comes to her defense and confirms her story. August instead places her under guard inside her house.\nDash-cam footage of a police officer watching Abbey's house shows a large black triangular object flying into view. The image distorts, but the officer is heard describing people being pulled out of the house and calls for backup. Deputies rush into the house, finding Ronnie and Abbey, who says Ashley was taken. A disbelieving August accuses her of kidnapping Ashley and removes Ronnie from her custody.\nAbbey undergoes hypnosis in an attempt to make contact with the beings responsible and reunite with her daughter. Campos and Odusami videotape the session. A hypnotized Abbey recalls that she witnessed Ashley's abduction and was also abducted herself. An alien presence communicates with her and Abbey begs for Ashley's return. It states Ashley will never come back before referring to itself as \"God\". When the encounter ends, Campos and Odusami rush over to the now unconscious Abbey and then notice something offscreen. The image distorts again as a voice yells \"Zimabu Eter!\" before resolving to show that all three are gone. Abbey wakes up in a hospital with a broken neck. August reveals that Will had committed suicide, and Abbey's belief that he was murdered was a delusion.\nThe re-enactment ends and, back in the present, Abbey states that she, Campos and Odusami were abducted during the hypnosis session but have no memory of their experiences. She is asked how anyone can take her claims of alien abduction seriously if she was proven to be delusional about her husband's death. Abbey states that she has no choice but to believe that Ashley is still alive. The interview ends as Abbey breaks down in tears.\nAn epilogue states that Abbey was cleared of all charges against her, left Alaska for the East Coast, and her health has deteriorated to the point of requiring constant care. Campos remains a psychologist and Odusami became a professor at a Canadian university. Both men, as well as August, refuses to be involved with the interview, while Ronnie remains estranged from Abbey and still blames her for Ashley's disappearance.

The film opens with him defending his friend Raj Thakur (Vipul Gupta), who has been accused of rape and murder. Arjun's defense strategy involves suggesting the victim had dubious morals. The victim's parents confront Arjun outside the courthouse, cursing him for his lack of a conscience. Later Raj confesses to Arjun that he is guilty; when Arjun is disturbed by his friend's lack of shame, Raj points out that Arjun's success comes from defending wealthy criminals like him.\nAt home, Arjun calls his girlfriend and fellow lawyer Urvashi (Sagarika Ghatge). A shadowy figure carrying a gun sneaks up on Arjun, but they retreat when they hear Arjun confess over the phone that he wants to change. When the court convenes the next morning, Arjun publicly accuses his friend of being guilty. The judge orders Arjun to step down from his duties, and his license is revoked. Arjun decides to take a break, leaving Mumbai and his girlfriend.\nArjun travels to Goa, where he meets an old man named Vivian McNamara who claims to be a retired lawyer. They spend time together, during which McNamara says he understands Arjun's situation. McNamara has written a novel titled \"Fix the Fox\", a crime thriller about the murder of five lawyers, which he hopes to publish and leave behind a positive legacy instead of a negative one. McNamara gives Arjun a copy of the manuscript, which he finishes reading in one night. When Arjun returns to McNamara's house the next morning, he is stopped by a police officer named Gaitonde, who tells him that McNamara just died.\nAs there's no one to give the manuscript to, Arjun decides to have it published in memoriam. He offers it to Sophia (Udita Goswami), a publishing house editor who recognizes its potential. The manuscript's pages are watermarked with \"McNamara\", which Sophie assumes is Arjun's pen name. Sophie's publishing policy is to use real names; she also doesn't normally accept unknown authors, but Arjun's fame as a lawyer will ensure the novel's publication. Arjun is pressured into signing a contract, officially claiming to be the author.\nThe novel becomes a national bestseller and lands in the hands of a local crime branch police officer Yashwant Deshmukh (Sunny Deol), who reads it and finds something suspicious. Yashwant meets Arjun to discuss the novel, and when Arjun confirms that he wrote it, Yashwant has Arjun arrested. The five murders in the novel match five unsolved murders on file, right down to confidential details. Urvashi comes to Arjun's aid, negotiating for bail and a remand under Yashwant's custody so they can investigate the case themselves.\nArjun and Urvashi tell Yashwant the full story and ask for his help, but they can't find any evidence that \"Vivian McNamara\" or \"Gaitonde\" ever existed. Arjun then remembers that the original manuscript had the \"McNamara\" watermark, which may help cast reasonable doubt. He and Urvashi sneak out of Yashwant's house to get it from the publishing house. They arrive just as \"Gaitonde\" has taken it; Arjun chases him, eventually following him back to Yashwant's house.\nArjun sneaks into Yashwant's rooms, where he discovers pictures of Yashwant with \"Gaitonde\". He also finds a secret room where there are costuming materials and newspaper articles of the five criminal lawyers and Arjun himself. He realizes that Yashwant is the Fox. He is behind the murders and the frame-up.\nArjun agrees to meet Yashwant at a secluded location. There, he demands to know why Yashwant framed him. Yashwant explains that his wife and son were murdered, but a criminal defense lawyer similar to Arjun got the killer acquitted. Yashwant since then vowed to kill all lawyers like him. He had almost killed Arjun, as seen earlier in the film, but changed his mind when he heard Arjun confess his troubles to Urvashi. Yashwant decided to give Arjun a chance, setting up the con with \"Vivian McNamara\" (actually Yashwant's brother, who also pretended to be Gaitonde), but when Arjun took credit for the novel, Yashwant took it as evidence that he hadn't changed at all.

After winning a fight in a local mechanic's garage, Hector tries to get another fight but the entertainment is interrupted by Tito who scolds both Hector and the owner due to the fact that Tito could  get into more trouble for illegal gambling fights as if smuggling illegals across the border isn't enough.\nCorralled, Hector goes to change but is followed in by another illegal; Maria. It soon becomes known that they grew up together as kids and it also becomes apparent that Hector dislikes her (mostly because of her sarcastic teasing). Tito hands Hector medicine for his mother and the three head back to the farm where they all work. After settling all of the immigrants in, Maria goes into her own suite with Hector and makes herself at home despite Hector being less than welcoming. Hector then goes to his mother Rosa to give her the medicine but it becomes apparent that she is getting worse. Hector begs her to not go out to the fields the next day but she declines stating \"No work, no pay\". She scolds Hector for fighting to make money and reminds him that a fighter's lifestyle gave his father nothing. Maria walks in and gets reacquainted with Hector's mother who comments on how much she has grown  and how beautiful she has gotten after nine years apart.\nAfter a hard days work, Maria is stopped and charmed by the farm owner's cocky and pugilist son Robert while Hector looks on with uncertainty. While taking a walk around the ranch, Hector and Maria happen upon Robert's training session where he is sparring. Hector comments to Maria while although Robert is very good, he has trouble with his balance. Overheard, Robert takes it as an insult. However, Robert's trainer, the alcoholic Billy Jenks agrees with Hector. Still feeling slighted, Robert challenges Hector on the spot. After getting outfitted, Hector and Robert spar but it quickly gets out of hand and has to be broken up by Billy. \"Big Al\" Stevens, the racist and brutish farm owner and Robert's father shows up and yells at Billy for letting Hector in the ring despite Tito and Billy saying that Hector shows promising talent. Al has none of it, and is firm in his wanting Robert to become a champion by any means necessary. Billy finds steroids in Robert's training bag and when Al reacts indifferently to it, Billy quits finally fed up.\nA few days later, Robert shows up with Maria to Hector's suite and offers him money for the sparring session the other day stating he earned it. Hector refuses it stating he doesn't accept charity. When Robert leaves, Maria yells at Hector for being so prideful to which Hector responds that people like Robert play games and that as workers, they are nothing more than playthings.

It becomes apparent that Billy was the one who trained Hector's father and angrily refuses stating that although Hector's father was a decent man, he was stubborn, had a bad temper, wouldn't listen or train and believed that Hector would be no better.

He implores Tito to look after his mother while he is gone.\nHector's persistence to get Billy to train him finally pays off but under the condition that he follow all of Billy's rules and guidelines.

Maria impresses everyone with her dancing and is guided into a corner with Robert who kisses her. But when Robert takes it further, Maria stops him. Irritated Robert leaves her believing that Hector has something to do with her hesitance and allows her to be picked on by the other guests. Maria leaves the party feeling humiliated.\nMeanwhile, Hector tells Billy he wants to fight Robert. Billy trains Hector into using his brains as well as his fists stating that Hector uses to much anger in a fight disabling him from thinking clearly and leaving himself vulnerable.

Tito comes to Billy and offers a proposition where he bets heavy on Hector and getting every worker to put money on him for the fight against Robert and goes and does the same with Al who readily agrees to the fight and the terms as he needs the money to keep the farm from failing (insect damage to the crops).\nOn fight day, Tito needs to smuggle Hector, Maria, and a friend across the border but are nearly caught. Tito wards away the border patrol by comically telling them an embarrassing story about one of the agents who forgets to check the van and leaves. Before the fight, Hector kisses Maria passionately. Meanwhile, Robert refuses to take steroids believing he doesn't need them against Hector and Al reminds him that the fate of the farm depends on him. Hector shares a touching moment with Billy who tells Hector that his father was a great fighter and a great man just like Hector.\nAs the fight begins, it becomes apparent that Hector is outclassed by Robert who is 30 pounds heavier and much more experienced getting knocked down several times. However, with Billy's strategy, Hector holds his own against Robert and ferociously fights back. In the last round, both fighters are battered but Hector beats on Robert until he makes him throw up and knocks him out. At the end of the fight, as everyone comes up to congratulate Hector, he tells Maria he loves her to which she responds the same way.

The eco-feministas are imprisoned.\nAt a Legion meeting, No. 9 explains that Fry must stop the implosion of the violet dwarf and thwart the Dark One who is sure to be present. Though no one knows the Dark One's form, its mind cannot be read, allowing Fry to identify it. No. 9 gives Fry the Omega Device, which can temporarily disable the Dark One at close range.\nBender frees the eco-feministas from prison to uphold his record for most crimes committed at once. Hermes, Zoidberg, Scruffy, and a repentant Farnsworth rescue them.\nAt the ceremony, Fry cannot locate an unreadable mind; he concludes that he himself (having an unreadable mind) must be the Dark One. The eco-feministas disrupt the ceremony, but Fry convinces Leela to let him proceed. Fry activates the Omega Device, which creates a small dome around the two that seemingly has no effect. Leela's leech falls to the ground, revealing itself as the final Dark One. The violet dwarf system forms a giant sperm and flies into the star, creating an Encyclopod embryo which quickly matures, taking the form of a giant manta ray-like creature. The Dark One kills Hutch, whose dying act is to pull Frida's necklace from Fry's forehead, causing Fry to lose his telepathy. The Encyclopod kills the Dark One. No. 9 convinces the Encyclopod to preserve the Dark One's DNA, but Zoidberg eats the remains before it can.

The primary field team consists of three guinea pigs: Darwin, Blaster, and Juarez, as well as a mole, Speckles and a fly named Mooch. The unit's leader Ben, orders an unauthorized infiltration of the residence of home electronics and appliances magnate, Leonard Saber, who is working with an unseen business partner named Mr. Yanshu. Saber's appliances all have control chips inside them that will activate a function called Sabersense, allowing electronic communication. The team retrieves sensitive information about a scheme called Clusterstorm, which will occur in 48 hours. However, when Ben's superior, Kip Killian, arrives for his evaluation, he is angry at Ben for performing an unauthorized mission. The government agent orders the unit shut down. With the help of the humans, Darwin, Juarez, Blaster, Mooch, and Speckles escape, but find themselves in a case bound for a pet shop. Ben and his assistant, Marcie, send a trained cockroach named Harry to infiltrate their hideout, which is now guarded by FBI agents, and recover Darwin's Personal Digital Assistant, which contained the information acquired from Saber's computer.\nTrapped in the store's pet rodent display case, G-Force meet Hurley, a guinea pig, Bucky, a hamster, and three mice. Although Blaster and Juarez manage to get themselves sold to a family with plans to return to extract their comrades, Speckles is thrown and seemingly crushed in a garbage truck. Meanwhile, Mooch manages to return to Ben to tell him where his mammalian agents are, but Darwin escapes with Hurley, who is forced to come after he gets kicked out by Bucky, before he can arrive to collect them. While Blaster and Juarez escape their new owners to return to Ben, he and Marcie discover that the intel in the PDA has a computer virus that hid the scheme. At this time, Darwin and Hurley make their own way to their superior. En route, Darwin sees a Saberling coffee maker and decides to investigate it, but it turns into a violent robot; which he and Hurley defeat by luring it into the road where its destroyed by a passing car. After examining the wreckage, they discover that Sabersense and Clusterstorm are connected and that the chips found inside the appliances actually transforms them into killer robots.\nOnce they all return and inform Ben of Speckles\u2019 apparent demise, Ben eventually confesses that they are not special genetically enhanced animals as previously told, but ordinary ones Ben took in and trained for the team. However, Hurley lifts them from their despair by reminding the team of the astounding feats that he has seen them do. He also suggests using the virus in the PDA to take down Saber's computer mainframe. Emboldened, Ben provides the field team with the means to infiltrate the Saber residence and plant the virus in the mainframe. Unfortunately, FBI agents are ordered by Killian to capture the animals dead or alive. After the team infiltrates Saber's mainframe, they encounter a bomb trap, but avoid it because of their size.\nIn every place with Saberling appliances, all of the machines also transform into killing machines resulting in massive chaos; one of which tries to kill the 3 guinea pigs after trapping Hurley inside & tries to cook him. The team fight the monster until it is destroyed by the bomb trap, and the resulting battle separates the group, leaving only Darwin and Mooch to take the mainframe down. Meanwhile, Leonard Saber is shocked that his appliances have turned into killing machines, having wanted them to communicate with each other. As this happens, Kip and the FBI, having found out about the appliances going on a rampage via live television, decide to apprehend Saber for his actions, only to find out that he didn't do anything wrong and that he just wanted to make Saberling the biggest appliance manufacturer in the world. Darwin finds Speckles alive and well (having faked his death) at the mainframe, who reveals that he is the mastermind behind the plot and is also the mysterious Mr. Yanshu (Yanshu means \"mole\" in Chinese), tricking Saber into planting the control chips into the appliances to repurpose Clusterstorm into causing a massive planet-wide bombardment of space debris to make Earth's surface uninhabitable while using Sabersense as a cover up, and reveals that he was the one who sabotaged G-Force's presentation to ensure that they did not find out about his plot. He explains his motive is to exact revenge on the human race for the death of his family after being persuaded by his father to do so. Speckles promptly amalgamates the various appliances in the vicinity into a giant walking robot, which attacks the police and grabs the command truck with Ben, Marcie, Killian, and Saber inside. During the fight, Darwin convinces Speckles to change his ways, but he refuses and summons a Saberling blender to overpower him, which loses his PDA and parachute in the process. However, Darwin manages to persuade Speckles by saying that G-Force is his family now, one he was close to destroying like what had happened to his first family long ago because Ben was the only human who took him in when they had nobody else. Realizing Darwin is right and that he is close to destroying the only family he has left, Speckles tries to shut down the robot, but he cannot control them anymore. With Mooch recovering the PDA, Darwin uses it on the device to take it down, destroying the robot and nearly killing Hurley, but saving Ben, Marcie, Kip, and Saber, who is later taken by the FBI. With the mission complete, the G-Force find Hurley dead, but they use the remains of his chocolate cake that Hurley found earlier to revive him.\nThe guinea pigs are personally commended by the FBI Director, who also appoints them special agents of the FBI. Furthermore, G-Force is reinstated as a unit of the Bureau and expanded with Hurley, Bucky, and the mice inducted as new recruits. Meanwhile, Saber was forced by the FBI and the government to make the largest consumer product recall in history where Speckles is given the duty of removing the malicious chips from all 178,003 Saber appliances before rejoining the team.

The nanobots can only be stopped by activating the kill switch. His company M.A.R.S. sells four warheads to NATO, and NATO troops led by American soldiers Duke and Ripcord deliver the warheads. Their convoy is ambushed by the Baroness, whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fianc\u00e9e Ana Lewis. Duke and Ripcord are rescued by Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Breaker, and Heavy Duty. They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in Egypt, and upon arriving, rendezvous with the head of the G.I. Joe Team, General Hawk. Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and Ripcord, only to be convinced to let them join his group, after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.\nMcCullen is revealed to be using the same nanotechnology to build an army of soldiers with the aid of the Doctor, planning on using the warheads to cause worldwide panic and bring about a new world order. Using a tracking device, McCullen locates the G.I. Joe base and sends Storm Shadow and the Baroness to retrieve the warheads, with assistance from Zartan.\nStorm Shadow and the Baroness retrieve the warheads and take them to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize in his particle accelerator; after he reluctantly does this, DeCobray is killed by Storm Shadow. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but they launch one of the missiles. The missile hits the Eiffel Tower, destroying it and some of the surrounding area before Duke hits the kill switch.

Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that McCullen's employer the Doctor is actually Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Dr. Mindbender in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke using a flamethrower, McCullen ends up being burned when Duke shoots the weapon and causes it to explode, so Rex and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back after Rex activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.\nRex assumes the identity of the Commander, having healed McCullen's burned face with nanomites, transforming his skin into a silver-like substance and naming him \"Destro\", which places McCullen under the Commander's control. They are captured by G.I. Joe soon after. On the supercarrier USS Flagg, the Baroness is placed in protective custody until they can remove the nanomites from her body.

The first application of Castle's \"Nanex\" technology is a virtual community life simulation game, Society, which allows gamers to manipulate live actors as their avatars.  Society becomes a worldwide sensation, making Castle the richest man in the world. He then creates Slayers, a first-person shooter where the \"characters\" are death-row prisoners using real weapons in specially created arenas.  Unlike Society actors, Slayers participants are not paid; instead, they volunteer in exchange for the promise that any Slayer who survives 30 matches will earn his freedom (though no one ever has).\nJohn \"Kable\" Tillman (Butler) is the crowd's favorite, having survived a record 27 matches (no inmate before him has managed to last more than ten). He is exclusively controlled by Simon (Lerman), a seventeen-year-old superstar gamer from a wealthy family.\nAn activist organization called the \"Humanz\" hacks a talk-show interview with Castle and claims that his technology will one day be used to control people against their will. The Humanz also disrupt Society play, but Castle sees both these actions as trivial.  However, Castle feels threatened by Kable's winning streak, and introduces a new inmate into Slayers, Hackman (Crews), specifically to kill Kable.  Unknown to anyone else, Hackman will not be controlled by a player, and thus not be handicapped by the \"ping\" that causes a small but dangerous delay between the player's command and the Slayer's action.\nKable/Tillman's wife, Angie (Valletta), works as a Society character, but in spite of her earnings, she is refused custody of their daughter Delia, who has been placed with a wealthy family.\nThe Humanz contact Kable and Simon separately, warning them that Castle has no intention of letting Kable survive, and offer to create a mod that will let him escape, but only if Simon relinquishes control during the game.  The escape is successful, and news outlets report that Kable has been fragged, which puts Simon in a difficult position: he is labeled a \"cheater\", locked out of his bank account, and investigated by the FBI for helping Kable escape.\nTillman is brought to the Humanz' hideout; he refuses to help their fight against Castle, but learns of Angie's current location in Society.  He rescues her, escaping from both Hackman and Castle's security forces. They are met by Gina (Sedgwick), the talk show host, secretly assisting the Humanz.  The Humanz deactivate the nanites in Angie and Tillman's brains, and Tillman remembers that the original nanites were tested on him while he was still in the military.  Under Castle's control, Tillman shot and killed his best friend, and was imprisoned.\nUpon learning that Castle is the wealthy father who adopted Delia, Tillman infiltrates his mansion to get her back. He locates Castle, who  reveals that his henchmen have already tracked down the Humanz' lair and killed all of them.  He also reveals that 98% of his own brain has been replaced with nanites, but this allows him to control others, rather than be controlled.  He plans to release air-borne nanites which will infect the entire United States within six months, giving him ultimate control. Hackman attacks Tillman, who easily kills him.  Tillman then attacks Castle, but is frozen in place, as Castle explains that his men have reactivated his and Angie's nanites.\nUnknown to Castle, Gina and Trace (Lohman) escaped the murder of the Humanz, and patch into the Nanex, revealing the confrontation to the world and exposing Castle's plans, much to the disgust of the people worldwide.

Journalist Mikael Blomkvist, who Salander helped on a previous case, resumes his efforts to clear her of several murder charges, knowing that she was framed by the \"Section\", a group within the Swedish Security Service that illegally sheltered Zalachenko after he defected from the Soviet Union.\nSection members Evert Gullberg and Fredrik Clinton decide to silence Zalachenko and Salander to preserve their secrets. Gullberg arrives at the hospital and kills Zalachenko, but is unable to reach Salander; he then commits suicide. Clinton plans to have Salander recommitted to the mental hospital where the Section had her institutionalized as a child after she nearly killed Zalachenko. His collaborator in this plan is Dr. Peter Teleborian, the hospital's administrator, who \"treated\" the young Salander by putting her in restraints for the smallest infractions.\nBlomkvist persuades her doctor to sneak an Internet phone into Salander's room, whereupon Salander contacts her fellow hacker, Plague, to see if he can find something on Teleborian. She then tells Blomkvist that Annika Giannini, her lawyer and Blomkvist's sister, has permission to use a video showing her state-appointed guardian Nils Bjurman raping her; Bjurman, a former Section employee, is one of the people she is accused of murdering.\nRonald Niedermann, Zalachenko's son and enforcer who previously tried to kill Salander's girlfriend Miriam, remains a fugitive, wanted for killing a police officer. Sonny, a member of an outlaw motorcycle gang Salander encountered in the previous film, learns that Niedermann went to his home to hide out. There, Sonny finds his brother dead and his girlfriend badly injured. She tells him that Niedermann was the culprit, and Sonny vows revenge.\nOn the day of her murder trial, Salander enters court with piercings, a mohawk, black makeup, and black leather clothing. Called as an expert witness for the prosecution, Teleborian characterizes Salander as delusional and violent; but Giannini gradually demolishes his credibility, using Salander's words and files from the hospital. She also presents the video proving Bjurman raped Salander.\nAs Giannini presents her case, the police arrest the people involved with the Section and seize their place of operation. In court, Blomkvist and Giannini prove that Teleborian made a false diagnosis on orders from the Section, and that the evidence against her was planted. Teleborian is then arrested for possession of child pornography, which Plague discovered after hacking into his laptop. The court releases Salander.\nSalander checks on a property she has inherited from her father and discovers the warehouse where her step-brother Niedermann is hiding. He tries to kill her, but she nails his feet to the floor with a nail gun. She calls Sonny and tells the bikers where to find him, and then calls the police.\nBlomkvist visits Salander to tell her that the motorcycle gang killed Niedermann and were arrested at the warehouse afterward.

On returning to Sweden after nearly a year living abroad, Salander reconnects with her best friend and former partner Miriam Wu and offers her free use of her old apartment in return for forwarding her mail. Later, Salander confronts Nils Bjurman after hacking into his mail and discovering that he has an appointment booked with a tattoo removal specialist. Threatening him with his own gun, she warns him not to remove the tattoo that she etched on his abdomen.\nMillennium magazine welcomes Dag Svensson, a new journalist who is writing an expos\u00e9 on prostitution and human trafficking in Sweden. Dag's girlfriend, Mia Bergman, is writing her doctoral thesis on sex trafficking. Dag is nearly finished with the story and is confronting those who will be exposed by the article. Dag and his girlfriend are about to leave on a holiday and ask Mikael Blomkvist to come to his apartment and collect some photographs. At the same time Dag also asks Blomkvist to inquire about someone called \"Zala,\" who may have a connection to his present research. Blomkvist arrives at their apartment and finds the two lying dead. The murder weapon is tracked to Bjurman who is also deceased. Salander is the prime suspect, as her fingerprints happen to be on the gun. Salander tells Blomkvist that she did not kill anyone and that he needs to find the mysterious \"Zala.\"\nBlomkvist is contacted by Salander's boxing trainer and friend, Paolo Roberto.  While he is unaware of Salander's whereabouts, Paolo does know Miriam, who also trained with them, and promises to pay her a visit. Near her apartment, Paolo witnesses Miriam being kidnapped by strongman Ronald Niedermann. Paolo follows his car to a deserted barn, where he hears him beat Miriam for information about Salander. Paolo comes in to rescue her but Niedermann beats him too. He then sets the barn aflame, but the two manage to escape.\nNews breaks of the attack, and Paolo gives his account to the police. After Blomkvist leaves information that he has discovered about the case on his computer for Salander to hack into and read, she leaves a message to him saying, \"Thank you for being my friend.\" He realizes that she intends to set out alone to find the man who framed her and that she may not survive. A disguised Salander visits Miriam in hospital to apologize for getting her involved. Without giving anything away, Salander confirms the police sketch of Niedermann with Miriam and then disappears. Knowing now that he is Salander's friend, Miriam calls Blomkvist to the hospital to give him keys that Lisbeth dropped during her visit. Noticing that one of them is for a post office box, Blomkvist is able to access and read Salander's mail and locate her apartment. Meanwhile, Salander continues her efforts to find Niedermann by patiently staking out his post office box. She eventually sees someone retrieve his mail and follows him to a small house near Gosseberga. Reading the material in Lisbeth's apartment, Blomkvist finds the video of Bjurman raping Salander.\nIn the offices of Millennium magazine, Paolo explains that he tracked down Niedermann and learned that he has congenital analgesia which makes him unable to feel pain. They trace Niedermann to a company owned by \"Karl Axel Bodin.\" Blomkvist has Erika Berger forward documents to Bublanski and sets out to find Salander.\nSalander crosses the grounds and enters the Gosseberga house, but Niedermann has been alerted by motion detectors and knocks her out. She awakens to see her father, Alexander \"Zala\" Zalachenko, an old man who walks with a stick and is heavily scarred by the burns that she inflicted as a child. He dismisses her mother as a whore and belittles her rape at the hands of Bjurman. He reveals that Niedermann is her half-brother and that Niedermann killed Bjurman to prevent him from revealing any of Zalachenko's secrets.\nThey lead Lisbeth to a shallow grave in the woods. She tells him that the police will find him soon and all that he has said has been published online through her hidden cellphone. Seeing through her bluff, he shoots Lisbeth several times as she attempts to escape and buries her alive. Salander digs her way out using her cigarette case. Hidden in the woodshed, she surprises Zalachenko and sticks an axe into his leg. She then keeps Niedermann at bay with Zalachenko's gun as Blomkvist comes coasting up the driveway.

Lisbeth Salander, a freelance surveillance agent and hacker, is hired by Henrik Vanger, the patriarch of the wealthy Vanger family, to conduct a background check on Blomkvist.\nVanger subsequently hires Blomkvist to investigate the disappearance of his niece, Harriet, who vanished on Children's Day decades earlier in 1966. Vanger believes that Harriet was murdered by a family member. Henrik explains that his brothers\u2014Richard, Gottfried and Harald\u2014are supporters of the Nazi regime. As Richard died in 1940, he is not a suspect. Her father, Gottfried, who is described as a heavy drinker, womanizer and wife beater, accidentally drowned in a lake a year prior to Harriet\u2019s disappearance, so he is not a suspect either. After his death, since Harriet\u2019s mother seemed incapable of/uninterested in taking care of her children (Harriet and her older brother Martin), Henrik took responsibility for raising the two.\nHarald is a recluse who still clings to his strong Nazi views and is a suspect for the murder, as is Harriet's mother and all the other family members who were present on that day. Henrik also shows Blomkvist a room whose walls are covered with pressed flowers. The first ones were gifts from Harriet, and since her disappearance, a flower has arrived each year from different places around the world. Henrik believes that Harriet's killer is sending them to taunt him.\nSalander, who was ruled mentally incompetent as a child, is placed in the custody of a new legal guardian, Nils Bjurman, after her previous guardian suffers a stroke. Bjurman makes it clear to Lisbeth that unless she does what he tells her, he will make her life very difficult and even threatens her with incarceration in a mental hospital. Bjurman also takes over control of Lisbeth's bank account and refuses to let her access her own money. Lisbeth lies to Bjurman about the nature of her work by pretending that she is just an office assistant.\nLisbeth is attacked by a group of drunk thugs in the subway. Although she manages to fight them off, her laptop is broken. She visits a hacker friend of hers, \"Plague\", who can save the hard drive and let her use his spare PC, but only until she can get a replacement laptop. She goes to see Bjurman, who forces her to perform fellatio on him in return for the money that she needs to buy a new computer; he refuses to give her the full amount she needs. Lisbeth calls him again the next day, but when she goes to meet with Bjurman, he handcuffs her to his bed then beats and rapes her. Lisbeth secretly records the encounter with a hidden device. She later returns to Bjurman, uses a taser to incapacitate him, ties him up, rapes him with a dildo, shows him the hidden camera footage, explains what she really does for a living, and tells him that she is taking back control of her money and her life. If anything happens to her, then the video recording will be released, and any threat to her will result in the same outcome. She then uses a tattoo machine to brand Bjurman's abdomen with the message \"I am a sadistic pig and a rapist\".\nBlomkvist moves to a cottage on the Vanger estate and meets the Vanger family, including Harriet's brother Martin, who is the head of the Vanger group, and her cousin Cecilia. Martin is congenial and invites Blomkvist over for dinner; he and Cecilia both think that Harriet simply ran away, as she was unhappy at home. Inside Harriet's diary, Blomkvist finds a list of five names alongside what appears to be phone numbers. He visits retiring police inspector Morell, who informs him that his team had been unable to decipher them when they worked on Harriet's case. After viewing photographs taken during the Children's Day parade, Blomkvist sees Harriet's facial expression change suddenly just before she leaves and, after obtaining photographs taken from the same side of the street that she was on, comes to believe that Harriet may have seen her murderer that day.\nUsing her access to Blomkvist's computer, Salander theorizes that the numbers in Harriet's diary are references to verses in the Book of Leviticus and emails Blomkvist anonymously. Blomkvist figures out that Salander sent the email and hires her as a research assistant. Together, Blomkvist and Salander connect all but one of the names on Harriet's list to murdered women. They are all Jewish names, which intrigues Blomkvist, as the Vanger family has a long history of antisemitism. During the investigation, Blomkvist and Salander become lovers.\nThey suspect Henrik's reclusive brother Harald to be the murderer, as he is the only other surviving Vanger brother. Salander searches through Vanger's business records to trace Harald to the crime scenes, while Blomkvist breaks into Harald's house, believing it to be unoccupied. He discovers many Nazi texts and memorabilia amid the wreckage of the interior of the house, which has been left to decay. When Harald attacks Blomkvist, Martin appears and saves him. Harald insults Martin for stopping him from shooting Blomkvist. Martin escorts Blomkvist to his home, where Blomkvist reveals what he and Salander have uncovered. Martin says that he'll call the police, but instead he drugs Blomkvist. Salander's search of the company accounts points to Martin and his late father, Gottfried, as having been jointly responsible for the murders. She returns to the cottage to find Blomkvist missing.\nBlomkvist wakes to find himself bound in Martin's cellar. Martin explains that Gottfried began teaching him to rape, torture, and kill as a teenager. Martin boasts about raping and murdering women for decades since his father's death. However, he denies killing Harriet, insisting that she disappeared. He also says that his father was too theatrical and that leaving the bodies out to be found was a step too far, as it drew unwanted attention. As Martin is in the process of hanging Blomkvist, Salander appears and attacks him with a golf club. While she frees Blomkvist, Martin flees in his car. Salander gives chase on her motorcycle. When Martin drives off the road, Salander finds him still alive but trapped in the vehicle. She then simply walks away as the car catches fire and he burns to death.\nBlomkvist realises that Cecilia's late sister Anita was the near-double of Harriet and that some of the photographs taken on the day of Harriet's disappearance show Anita, not Harriet as previously thought. Blomkvist and Salander discover that Harriet has been using Anita's name and is still alive in Australia. Blomkvist flies there to look for her, and he persuades her to return to Sweden, where she is reunited with her uncle. Harriet explains the truth about her disappearance: that her father and her brother had repeatedly raped her; that she killed her father by drowning him, which was witnessed by Martin; and that her cousin Anita had smuggled her away from the island prior to her death. Harriet notes that her brother was harsher to her than her father and that she knew that remaining on the island would lead to her death at her brother's hands. As a way of letting Henrik know that she was alive, Harriet sent him a pressed flower every year. She apologises for frightening Henrik as he had misinterpreted these messages, but Henrik reassures her by explaining that thanks to her messages, the truth has come out.\nSalander's elderly mother, living in a nursing home, apologises for not choosing a \"better papa\" for her. Salander then visits Blomkvist in prison and gives him new information on the Wennerstr\u00f6m case. From prison, Blomkvist publishes a new story on Wennerstr\u00f6m in Millennium which ruins Wennerstr\u00f6m and restores his reputation. Wennerstr\u00f6m is then found dead, which the police write off as a suicide.

Michael is curious to learn what happened to Anne, which leads Walter to reminisce about the summer of 1939 at the Keyes' estate in Norfolk.\nOn Sir Alexander's birthday, Anne has prepared a table in the garden to celebrate. Anne's friend, the outspoken MP Hector and lover, the reserved Lawrence, are present for the festivities. When Sir Alexander arrives, he brings a guest, the quiet government employee Joseph Balcombe. During dinner, Hector rants about Britain's lack of action against Nazi Germany. It is later revealed that he has been one of those calling out for a new prime minister. The next day, while looking for a cat in one of the property's sheds, which are out of bounds as they are used for storing Sir Alexander's private papers, Anne finds gramophone records, labelled \"Foxtrot\". They prove to contain recorded meetings and telephone conversations. Sir Alexander reveals that he has allowed Balcombe to store government documents in the shed.\nTwo weeks later, Anne is notified that Hector has been found dead from an apparent suicide. Anne wonders if Balcombe had anything to do with Hector's death. Sir Alexander brushes off the idea but offers to ask Balcombe to remove the records from the shed, which he promises to do the next day during a picnic. There, the picnickers go for a walk, leaving Anne to watch over the baby Oliver. She awakens to find Oliver and his pushchair missing.

At the end, she recognises Balcombe's voice discussing their plots to pressure and silence men like Hector.

His mother sent Goemon away for safety minutes before he witnessed her death. Running away with his caretaker, they were attacked by bandits but he was saved by the great Oda Nobunaga. Goemon followed Nobunaga and Hattori Hanz\u014d was assigned to train him in the ways of the shinobi (ninja) along with his martial brother, Kirigakure Saiz\u014d.\nAfter many years of training, Goemon was assigned to protect Oda's niece, Princess Chacha. They developed feelings for each other, but status differences kept them apart and eventually she departed. Before leaving, Chacha gave Goemon her favourite fan as a memento. Oda rewarded Goemon's faithful protection of Chacha by giving him his double-bladed sword. Meanwhile, Oda's generals, Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Akechi Mitsuhide, conspired to kill Nobunaga. The two made a secret written covenant, placing their signatures onto a black scroll. Mitsuhide, not trusting Hideyoshi, had his men hide the contract. After assassinating Nobunaga, Hideyoshi betrayed and killed Mitsuhide, took credit for slaying Nobunaga's killer and became the next ruler of Japan. With Nobunaga dead, the two young ninjas parted ways for different pursuits: Saizo hopes to be elevated to Samurai status and chose to remain in service to Nobunaga house, but Goemon chose to leave and be free. As a parting gift, Goemon broke his double-bladed sword in two and gave one-half to Saizo.\nYears later, Goemon became a master thief and something of a Robin Hood. Sarutobi Sasuke, an inexperienced bounty hunter, tried to arrest Goemon, but failed and became his private servant instead. During a festival, Goemon infiltrated and robbed a treasure repository that contained a mysterious box with foreign writing on it. Ishida Mitsunari, a high-ranking samurai under Lord Hideyoshi, tried to retrieve this box to destroy it, but Goemon escaped with it, leaving behind only his calling card: a red sticker with the Japanese character \"Go\" on it. Goemon, unaware of the value of the box, threw it away and distributed the gold to the poor. A young pick-pocket, Koheita, picked up the mysterious box and kept it as a memento. The following day, Goemon learned of the box's value from Sasuke. Intrigued by the box, Goemon returned to the city to find it. Searching around the slums for the box, Goemon heard a scream and finds Koheita and his mother, who had just been callously murdered by cruel and petty local samurai. Goemon saved Koheita and retrieved the box, but also took Koheita under his wing.\nSaizo and his ninja squad, working for Mitsunari, appeared and confronted Goemon. Refusing to turn over the box, Goemon fled and was pursued by Saizo's ninjas. Goemon evaded all of his pursuers except Saizo, who remained close behind him. In a showdown between the former brothers, Saizo informed him that the box Goemon carried was referred to as a \"Pandora's Box\" by foreigners, and the two engaged in a duel. After Goemon was overpowered and about to be killed by Saizo, Hattori Hanzo appeared and intervened, causing Saizo to withdraw. After returning to the city, Goemon examined the \"empty box\" and discovered a map to a mysterious treasure. Following the map, Goemon and Sasuke were led to the destroyed Buddha statue where Akechi Mitsuhide had hidden his contract with Hideyoshi. Goemon became angry once he learned that Hideyoshi was involved with Nobunaga's death. Hattori Hanzo then reappeared, under the command of Tokugawa Ieyasu. Hanzo offered his old student a bag of gold for the contract, which Goemon readily agrees to. Seeking vengeance for his murdered lord, Goemon infiltrated Lord Hideyoshi's castle, where he killed Lord Hideyoshi and discovered Princess Chacha. Startled by another person entering, Goemon hid himself in the ceiling of Chacha's room, losing Chacha's fan as he did so. To Goemon's surprise, the real Hideyoshi entered the room. Goemon had only killed his fake double. Suddenly, one of Lord Hideyoshi's guards discovered Goemon and shot him in the chest, blowing him out of the castle and into the moat. Later, Goemon was secretly rescued and recovered by Saizo.\nGoemon was then contacted by Hanzo, who took him to a waterfall to meet Chacha. The princess had come to bid him farewell and returned the fan as she had reluctantly agreed to become Hideyoshi's concubine. Afterwards, Lord Tokugawa arrived to ask Goemon to assassinate Hideyoshi in order to save Chacha and the country. Elsewhere, Lord Mitsunari offered Saizo samurai status in return for killing Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon and Lord Tokugawa crafted a plan to assassinate Lord Hideyoshi during a celebration on his royal boat, but upon receiving his secret signal, Goemon changed his mind and did not complete the plan. Moments later, all of Lord Hideyoshi's escort ships were destroyed by explosives set by Saizo and his team; they captured Lord Hideyoshi and tried to assassinate him by hanging him from the ship's mast with a steel chain. Lord Mitsunari, believing Lord Hideyoshi to be dead, then turned on Saizo and shot him. However, Lord Hideyoshi survived the assassination attempt and Saizo survived the gunshot wound. Lord Hideyoshi, unaware of Lord Mitsunari's betrayal, interrogated Saizo and threatened to kill Saizo's family unless he revealed who hired him.\nMeanwhile, Goemon tried to rescue Chacha, but because Lord Hideyoshi was still alive, she refused to leave. Later, against Sasuke's warnings, Goemon rescued Saizo from prison. Unfortunately, Lord Mitsunari killed Saizo's wife in reprisal and left a note on her body telling Saizo he had taken Saizo's child. Saizo was later recaptured and Lord Hideyoshi decreed Saizo should be boiled to death during an elaborate public execution. Hideyoshi told Saizo he would spare his child's life if he would reveal his name so he falsely identified himself as Goemon. Goemon tried to stop the execution but he could only watch in horror as Lord Hideyoshi kicked Saizo into the cauldron and then threw in the child.\nWith the help of Saizo's surviving team, Goemon stormed through the palace and eventually reached Lord Hideyoshi. Goemon wanted to know why Lord Hideyoshi had betrayed Lord Nobunaga. Hideyoshi explained it was his insatiable hunger for power that had driven him and Goemon eventually killed him. With Hideyoshi dead, there was a power vacuum that the strongest fought for.

He punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver, slices his tongue, and drives nails into his scrotum. He sexually assaults both the man and woman, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes, he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and treat the couple's wounds, so they can continue to live for a longer period of time. He cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples, and cuts off her right arm.\nAs the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs so no longer needs the couple's \"services\". The couple is moved to a room that resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of their wounds. It gradually becomes apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, and fine taste, preferring classical music, good wine, and expensive clothes. He mentions he is wealthy, suggesting he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme way to obtain satisfaction in his lonely life. The couple notes that the doctor has a particular rotting smell behind his clean and elegant appearance.\nAfter several days of healing, the \"doctor\" simply tells the couple they will be free to go. He will turn himself in, and, as an apology for all the suffering he inflicted, he will give them his entire fortune as compensation.

However, immediately after telling them they will be released, the couple is taken back to the basement and are shackled again, just like before.\nThe \"doctor\" announces they must participate in one final test of love. He pulls out some of Kazuo's intestines and attaches them to a hook. If Kazuo can cross the room to the other side (pulling his entire intestine out of his body in the process) and cut Aki's ropes with scissors to release her, both will be freed. However, Kazuo fails due to blood loss, and it is revealed that the ropes restraining Aki have a metal wire running through them; the task was therefore impossible regardless.\nAki begins to insult the doctor, saying he has a skunk odor. Angered, the doctor cuts off her head. The head lands on the doctor's neck; she bites him with her final breath.

He is still a virgin at 25 because a lifetime of alienation and bullying have left him unable to make friends or attract women. At the photographic studio he shares with his brother and nephew Lee, he meets aspiring model Tia.\nAs Jamie develops photos from a shoot, he notices a disturbing face looking at him from the window of a house. When he goes back to investigate, he follows a suspicious man to a group of hooded vandals around a fire, who emit eerie shrieks. One notices Jamie and shrieks at him. Jamie is shocked to see a demonic lizard-like face under the hood, with huge pin-like teeth. Over time Jamie becomes aware of a series of horrific murders by Molotov cocktail that have been occurring in the neighbourhood. A witness to one of the murders, a little Asian girl, tells a TV reporter that they weren't wearing masks; the demonic faces were real. Jamie's neighbour and new-found friend, A.J. turns up with a huge wound that looks as if it was caused by claw marks. Parts of his dismembered body then turn up in the local area.\nJamie and his mother are walking in the neighborhood when they are attacked by the demonic gang. His mother is immolated while Jamie watches helplessly, and he is savagely beaten and left for dead. While unconscious in hospital he glimpses a man in his dream who says he is waiting for Jamie. Later, he receives a phone call from a man with the same voice, and is guided to the apartment of Papa B and his assistant Belle, who looks just like the little Asian girl from the TV report. Papa B offers a Faustian bargain: Jamie must fulfil Papa B's desire for chaos with occasional acts of vandalism in return for the removal of his birthmarks. Despite Papa B admitting that he was responsible for his mother's death as a way of bringing Jamie to him, Jamie consents and they shake hands. Jamie is told to immolate himself with a Molotov cocktail in order to be reborn. Jamie miraculously survives and peels away his burned skin to reveal perfect, unblemished skin.\nInitially things go well: a chance meeting with Tia leads a newly confident Jamie to spend the day with her in the park, where his beloved, deceased father first taught him to use a camera. The deal sours, however, when the Weapons Man arrives: Papa B has reneged on their bargain and Jamie must now commit murder by ripping the heart from a living victim. The Weapons Man tortures Jamie until he agrees to kill a street hustler. His hope for a better life returns after he and Tia become lovers. During this time Belle also comes to live with Jamie, after Papa B beat her in a fit of rage. She starts calling Jamie \"Dad\" and becomes a bit of a guide to him, kindly and pragmatically explaining that he has no choice but to kill, to save his own life\u2014and Belle's. But Papa B is outraged at Belle's betrayal and as punishment demands that Jamie kill a new victim\u2014Tia.\nTia asks Jamie to put a photo album in his work safe, and it is revealed that Tia and Lee intended to steal his late mother's jewellery. Tia had initially meant only to help Lee gain access to the safe, but she ended up sincerely falling in love with Jamie. During the ensuing struggle Tia is accidentally shot and killed, and Lee is seriously wounded by \"She\", a gang leader to whom he owed money, and who wears a metallic claw in place of a severed hand.\nJamie is pursued by She but fights back and kills him. He notices that a mark on a wall from She's claw looks just like the wound received by A.J. Jamie tells Belle, who has turned up from nowhere, that she must flee to stay safe, and she disappears. Jamie spies himself in a mirror and sees that his birthmark has returned, and with it the knowledge that it had been there the entire time, even while he was courting Tia. Jamie confronts Papa B's minions and fights them off, but when faced with a larger demon, Papa B in his true form, runs away. Viewers are left to decide for themselves whether Papa B cheated Jamie by never removing the birthmark, or if much of what transpired was the product of Jamie's imagination.\nAfter waking up indoors, Jamie staggers outside. On the ground he sees several masks with sharp teeth, and looks up to see several masked and hooded gang members. But these are ordinary masks made of sacks, not the realistic demon faces Jamie has seen so far. Are these the \"demons\" he had been fighting a short while ago? Jamie now recalls himself walking and talking with Belle\u2014only now he appears to converse with empty space. As realisation sinks in, a gang member catches him with a Molotov cocktail.

Heiter also abducts Japanese tourist Katsuro. Heiter is a retired world-renowned expert at separating Siamese twins, but dreams of making new creatures by sewing humans together. He says he will surgically connect his three victims mouth-to-anus, so that they share a single digestive system. His prior experiment, the 3Dog, conjoined three Rottweilers into a \"Siamese triplet.\" All three dogs expired after the operation. Heiter has moved on to using human subjects.\nAfter Lindsay tries to escape and fails, Heiter decides to make her the middle part of the centipede, the most painful position for the healing process, as punishment. Heiter performs the surgery, placing Katsuro at the lead, Lindsay at the middle and Jenny at the rear; he removes both the upper and lower front teeth and lips of Lindsay and Jenny, and mutilates the buttocks of Katsuro and Lindsay to provide access to the rectums. He severs the ligaments of his victims' knees to prevent leg extension, forcing his victims to crawl.\nOnce the operation is complete, Heiter takes the centipede to his living room, takes photos, and passes a mirror around for the segments of the centipede to view their new form. Heiter attempts to train his centipede as a pet by caging the centipede in a dog kennel, letting Katsuro eat dog food at dinner, and belittling Katsuro with racist insults and beating him with a crop when he becomes rebellious. When Katsuro defecates after apologizing to the girls, Lindsay is forced to swallow his excrement. Heiter becomes irritated after being kept awake by the screaming of a caged Katsuro (who, as the front part of the centipede, has his mouth free and is still able to speak, but in Japanese) and by the constant moaning of the women, threatening to remove their vocal cords. When the centipede attempts to escape while Heiter is swimming, all three segments are beaten with the crop. Heiter is displeased with the realization that Lindsay is constipated. He proposes to use laxatives on Lindsay. However, before he can do this, he discovers that Jenny is dying from sepsis (suggesting that Lindsay may have already defecated into her mouth off-camera, which led to infection).\nTwo detectives, Kranz and Voller, visit the house to investigate the disappearance of the three tourists. Heiter comes up with an idea to add them as replacements for Jenny in a new creation: a four-segment centipede. He offers the detectives water spiked with Rohypnol. After being given the drugged water, the detectives become suspicious and obtain a search warrant for his home. When the detectives leave Heiter's home, the victims attempt to escape. Katsuro attacks Heiter. Their attempt to escape fails. Katsuro confesses to Heiter that he deserves this fate because he treated his family poorly, then takes his own life by slitting his throat with a glass shard.\nUpon returning to Heiter's home, the detectives conduct separate searches as Heiter, injured, hides near his swimming pool. Kranz finds the ward along with Heiter's victims. Voller begins to feel ill from the earlier drugging, and Heiter stabs him with the scalpel pulled from his foot during Katsuro's attack.

The troupe's main attraction is a portal to a magical \"Imaginarium\", a surreal dream world that transforms according to its participants' own desires and offers them a choice between difficult self-fulfillment or easy ignorance. After a drunkard is swayed to the latter, Parnassus says he has lost \"another one\" to Mr. Nick, a suave personification of the Devil, who often appears without warning to taunt Parnassus and gloat over Parnassus's failures. He reminds Parnassus that in three days Valentina turns 16, and her soul will belong to Mr. Nick. Hundreds of years ago, Mr. Nick tricked Parnassus into accepting immortality, after making a wager similar to his current predicament.\nAs the troupe crosses a bridge, Anton notices someone hanging beneath it. After they rescue the man and revive him, he spits out a golden pipe that allowed him to continue breathing while being hanged; unwilling to explain his past, the man convinces his rescuers that he has amnesia. Parnassus sadly contemplates the impending loss of his daughter, and Mr. Nick visits him, revealing the identity of the rescued man: a disgraced philanthropist named Tony Shepard, who was being hanged by Russian gangsters for owing them money. Mr. Nick also offers Parnassus a new wager: Valentina can stay with Parnassus past the age of 16 if Parnassus can win five souls to the path of self-fulfillment before Mr. Nick can win five souls to the path of ignorance, all within the universe of the Imaginarium.\nThe newcomer Tony soon joins the troupe as a barker even more charismatic than Anton, who is becoming suspicious. Tony convinces the troupe to remodel the show into a more modern act. While performing, Tony lures a posh, affluent woman into the Imaginarium and follows her, where they enter a pastel-coloured dream-world representing the woman's imagination. The woman's imagination also changes Tony's face to one of her liking; Tony dances elegantly with her, and they notice a motel run by Mr. Nick, but Tony convinces the woman instead to take a gondola ride that wins the first soul for Parnassus. Tony falls back out of the Imaginarium, returning his face to normal. The woman exits shortly after and gives the troupe a vast sum of money as thanks for her marvellous experience. When three other women enter, each re-emerges elated; and thus, Parnassus has won a total of four souls. However, Mr. Nick easily takes the souls of four Russian gangsters looking to hunt Tony down for his debts. They chase Tony into the Imaginarium and quickly fall into a trap laid by Mr. Nick. Thus, the score is tied: four to four.\nWith the bet nearing its end, Parnassus reluctantly reveals to Valentina her secret origins: after aging from immortality, Parnassus made a new pact with Mr. Nick to be youthful again, in order to win the heart of a woman he loved. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick's property at the age of 16. Valentina is horrified at her father's revelation. Meanwhile, having discovered that Tony is a fraudulent charity scammer who stole organs from orphans in developing countries and sold them to wealthy westerners, Anton confronts Tony, but Tony fights him off, pushes Valentina into the Imaginarium, and joins her. Influenced by Valentina's romantic desires, Tony's face changes to that of her dream lover, and they float along a beautiful river in a gondola, fulfilling their shared sexual feelings. A child in rags disrupts their serene boat trip, transitioning the scene to one of Tony as a philanthropist, speaking at a fundraiser for impoverished children. Anton, following the pair into the Imaginarium, appears in the form of an outspoken child and exposes Tony as a fraud. A mob of angry benefactors pursues Tony, and, as the landscape disintegrates, Anton confesses his love for Valentina before falling into a void.\nDistraught and angry over her father's bargain and a lifetime of hiding the truth from her, Valentina willingly gives her soul over to Mr. Nick. Disillusioned by the easy victory, Mr. Nick offers Parnassus yet another bargain: to trade Valentina's soul for Tony's. Therefore, as the mob approaches Tony to hang him, Parnassus presents Tony with his true sturdy golden pipe that will allow him to survive the hanging as well as a near-perfect but brittle replica. Parnassus hopes that Tony will choose wrong; indeed, Tony inserts the cheap replica in his windpipe and thus dies when the mob lynches him. Mr. Nick keeps his word, freeing Valentina's soul but not revealing her new location to Parnassus, who is abandoned to wander in despair for years, trapped in his own Imaginarium.\nOne day, Parnassus looks up to find himself a pitiful beggar back in London, when Valentina suddenly walks by him. He sees that she is now happily married to Anton, and they have a daughter. As Parnassus watches them through a window, his old assistant Percy walks up to him, dissuading him from interrupting Valentina's new cheerful life. Parnassus finally seems to be at peace, just knowing that his daughter is happy.

However, in the dreamworld, Ink is unable to open a portal to the Incubi's headquarters, where he intends to take Emma's soul. He is told that he must find and barter with two other Drifters to acquire parts of a code that will enable him to achieve entry into the headquarters.\nMeanwhile, John, whose life has attained a sense of repetition and perfection, faces turmoil when an account he has been working to acquire is about to be swept out from under him. Soon after, Ron Evans (Steve Sealy), John's estranged father-in-law, comes to inform John that Emma is in a coma and has been placed in a hospital. Although Ron begs John to go and see the girl, John refuses and berates Ron, saying that the father-in-law turned the world against him. Shortly after, Ron is ordered out of John's office. It is revealed that Ron and his wife were given custody of Emma after the death of John's wife Shelly (Shannan Steele) in a car accident, due to John's grief-induced addiction to alcohol and drugs.\nAt the same time in the dreamworld, the Storytellers Allel, Gabe, and Sarah (played by Jennifer Batter, Eme Ikwuakor, and Shelby Malone, respectively) work to find a way to awake Emma. In order to do this, they receive the help of Jacob (Jeremy Make), an eccentric blind spirit known as a \"Pathfinder\". Meanwhile, a Storyteller named Liev (Jessica Duffy) confronts Ink and attempts to discourage him from delivering Emma to the Incubi. After Ink threatens to murder Emma if Liev continues to pursue him, Liev surrenders to Ink as a prisoner. It is revealed that Ink is taking Emma's soul to the Incubi in order to become one of them and cease to be a Drifter. Soon after, Ink successfully barters with two Drifters for parts of the code. As Ink's prisoner, Liev tries to bolster Emma's bravery in order to thwart Ink.\nDuring this time, the Pathfinder Jacob unveils his abilities to the Storytellers: tapping into the \"beat of the world\" in order to cause physical changes that affect the course of time. Through a chain of events, Jacob causes several small accidents that culminate in a truck running a red light and crashing into John's car, revisiting an opening scene of the film. Due to his injuries, John is taken to a hospital, which turns out to be the same hospital where Emma is checked in. After recalling his happiness before his wife died, John walks to Emma's room, guarded by Allel as an unseen battle ensues between the Storytellers and Incubi.\nIn the dreamworld, Liev discovers that Ink arrived after his human counterpart committed suicide. Ink, being ashamed of his hideous and scarred appearance, believes the Incubi will help him, the Incubi having been revealed to all wear apparati that project facades of bliss and happiness to hide their misery. After making their way to the stronghold of the Incubi, Ink offers Emma and Liev as his payment to the leader. As Liev attempts to stand up to the leader of the Incubi, she is mortally wounded. While dying, Liev pleads with Ink to \"remember\". Suddenly, Ink has a revelation: he recalls that Emma died in the hospital without her father's presence; and John, driven to further depression and regret, shot himself in despair, at which time his soul entered the dreamworld and became the Drifter known as Ink. Ink understands that he is, in fact, John Sullivan's soul from a future in which Emma dies and he does not visit her at the hospital (time flows differently in the dreamworld). In this realization, Ink rushes at the Incubi and kills them to rescue his daughter, mirroring the dream scene in the beginning of the film. After the fight is over, Emma's soul embraces Ink, realizing that it is her father. In the normal world, Pathfinder Jacob activates a device that calls the other Storytellers as reinforcement, with the onslaught of Storytellers defeating the Incubi. John finally makes his way to Emma's room.

We learn that the group own a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients. Sebastian does not want to do this line of work forever.\nFor Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal, which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a large treasure.\nSebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life.\nSebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace (Michael Graziadei) and his girlfriend Kimi (Mircea Monroe), Dani's best friend, who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to get involved with other women.

He then lies in a variety of other circumstances, initially for personal gain; he prevents a police officer from arresting Greg for drunk driving, convinces a stranger to have casual sex with him to prevent the end of the world (but fakes a call from NASA confirming the world has been saved after deciding that this was exploitative), breaks the bank at a casino, and writes a screenplay about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century that ends with the claim that everyone's memories were erased.

Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which would lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust.\nWhile attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that some black people in the stadium are cheering for England, and not their own country, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar (Matt Damon), and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with Fran\u00e7ois a British poem, \"Invictus\", that had inspired him during his time in prison.\nFran\u00e7ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many black people, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country.\nThings begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks begins to grow among the black population. By the second game, the whole country comes together to support the Springboks and Mandela's efforts. Mandela's security team also grows closer as the racially diverse officers come to respect their comrades' professionalism and dedication.\nAs Mandela watches, the Springboks defeat one of their arch-rivals\u2014Australia, the defending champions and known as the Wallabies\u2014in their opening match. They then continue to defy all expectations and, as Mandela conducts trade negotiations in Taiwan, defeat France in heavy rain to advance to the final against their other arch-rival: New Zealand, known as the All Blacks. New Zealand and South Africa were universally regarded as the two greatest rugby nations, with the Springboks then the only side to have a winning record (20\u201319\u20132) against the All Blacks, since their first meeting in 1921.\nMeanwhile one day during the tournament, the Springbok team visited Robben Island, where Mandela spent the first 18 of his 27 years in jail. There, Pienaar is inspired by Mandela's will and his idea of self-mastery in \"Invictus\". Fran\u00e7ois mentions his amazement that Mandela \"could spend thirty years in a tiny cell, and come out ready to forgive the people who put him there\".\nSupported by a large home crowd of all races at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg, Pienaar motivates his teammates for the final. Mandela's security detail receives a scare when, just before the match, a South African Airways Boeing 747-200 jetliner flies in low over the stadium. However, it is not an assassination attempt, but a demonstration of patriotism, with the message \"Good Luck, Bokke\"\u2014the Springboks' Afrikaans nickname\u2014painted on the undersides of the plane's wings.

While there, the school's co-founder and fellow teacher, Chef Cannone, a previous winner, serves as Pfeiffer's mentor. The theme of this year's competition is marriage, and the competition requires that all competitors create a wedding buffet consisting of a wedding cake, a chocolate sculpture, a sugar sculpture, cream puffs, chocolate candies, breakfast pastries and jam, tea pastries, a restaurant-style dessert plate, and a small sculpture (known as the \"bijou\") to commemorate the competition. Everything in the buffet, with the exception of the bijou, must be made from scratch and assembled in front of the  judges over a three-day period.  Keeping in mind that the presentation of his buffet will be judged on par with its taste, Pfeiffer works to develop close to forty recipes that are as visually exquisite as they are delicious.\nOnce his recipes and training regiment are established, Pfeiffer returns to his childhood home in Alsace where he adjusts his recipes to account for the nuances in French-quality baking ingredients. He is aware that the differences between French and American ingredients can affect the structure of his pastries as well as their taste. For example, French butter tends to have a higher fat and lower water content than American butter, and that slight variation can cause tremendous chemical complications in the baking process.

They inspect the chefs' work spaces for signs of messiness, going as far as to examine the chefs' aprons for fingerprints, and their waste-bins for discarded surplus.

Meanwhile, Caleb begins hearing the same whispering voices as Lucinda.\nJohn tracks Lucinda's daughter Diana and her granddaughter Abby to prevent the last event. After some initial disbelief, Diana goes with John to Lucinda's childhood home, where they find a copy of Matth\u00e4us Merian's engraving of Ezekiel's \"chariot vision\", in which a great sun is represented. They also discover that the final two digits of Lucinda's message are not numbers, but two reversed letter E's, matching the message left by Lucinda under her bed: \"Everyone Else\" \u2013 implying an extinction-level event. During the search, Caleb and Abby, who were left asleep in the car, have an encounter with the beings who are the source of the whispers. Diana tells John that her mother had always told her the date she would die. He also visits Lucinda's teacher, who tells him of the scratching on the door left by Lucinda.\n\nThe next day, Abby colors in the sun on the engraving, which gives John a revelation. He rushes to the MIT observatory and learns that a massive solar flare with the potential to destroy all life will strike the Earth on the last date indicated by the message. As Diana and Abby prepare to take refuge in nearby caves, John goes to the school and finds the door on which Lucinda engraved the final numbers and identifies them as coordinates of a place where he believes they may find salvation from the solar flare. The skeptical and hysterical Diana loads Caleb and Abby into her car and flees for the caves.\nAt a gas station, the whispering beings steal Diana's car with Caleb and Abby inside. Diana pursues them at speed in a stolen SUV, but is killed in a collision with a semi-truck on the date her mother predicted. The beings take Caleb and Abby to Lucinda's mobile home, where John encounters them shortly thereafter. The beings, acting as extraterrestrial angels, are leading children to safety on interstellar arks. John is told he cannot go with them because he never heard the whispering, so he convinces Caleb to leave with Abby and two pet rabbits they found, and both are transported away by the beings. The ark, along with many other arks, leave the planet. The following morning, John decides to be with his family when the flare strikes and drives through a chaotic Boston to his parents' house, where he reconciles with his estranged father. The solar flare then strikes, destroying all life on Earth. Meanwhile, the ark, along with others, deposits Caleb and Abby in another world resembling an earthly paradise and departs. The two run through a field towards a large white mysterious tree (implied to be the tree of life).", "tmdb_id": 13811}, "22785498": {"title": "Kobe Doin' Work", "plot": "Kobe Doin\u2019 Work is an 84-minute exploration of Kobe Bryant's work ethic, his in game mentality, and the bluntness that made Bryant a great competitor. Lee uses multiple cameras, sound from the in-game broadcast, the Staples Center, a microphone worn by Kobe himself, and a follow-up narration while he watched the footage to illustrate every detail of Kobe's performance, strategy, and inner thoughts.Bryant shot 6 of 14 from the field, scored 20 points, and played 32 minutes. The game was a crucial game in the end of the regular season, as the Los Angeles Lakers hoped to keep first place in the Western Conference with a record of 55-25. In an NBA.com 2009 Q&A (now archived) Spike Lee explained in an interview why he chose Kobe Bryant as the subject for this documentary: \"I'm a big basketball fan. It was obvious. He was having an MVP-type year, in which he did win the MVP. Also the Lakers looked like they were going to take it to the Finals. And I wanted them to beat the Celtics. I hate the Celtics. But the Celtics won. But I don't think I was taking a gamble by choosing Kobe.\" Also, according to Spike Lee, \"He (Kobe) said several times how much fun it was just doing it.\"\nThe 84-minute documentary ran on ESPN commercial free. The documentary also focuses on Bryant and the team in huddles and during time-outs. The cameras also get full access of coach Phil Jackson in the locker room with the team during half-time. Bryant provided the voice-over for the documentary on February 2, 2009, hours after he scored 61 points against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, (then a single-game record at the arena, which has been broken since). Spike Lee said that he was excited for Bryant to do the commentary following a game at Madison Square Garden, but no one expected a 61-point performance from Bryant. \"I know that if he had a terrible game the commentary would not have been the same. Guaranteed. But Kobe said he made a point to make sure not to lose the game or he would hear it from me.\" Bryant indeed said in an after game interview that he was going to give the game his all in order to show Spike Lee a thing or two about Bryant's skills on the court against the Knicks. \"On a lighter note, I'm going to review this documentary I'm doing with Spike Lee tonight after the game and I didn't feel like sitting next to him and hearing him talking trash about the Knicks, so that was added incentive as well.

The story features a prison system, in which prisoners are sealed in personal containment systems known as \"laminated suits\" and used for labor. Prisoners go through a \"Lamination\" process, where they are fitted with cybernetic, laminated skin-tight suits. In these suits, they can move around and completed work assignments that cannot be done by machine or robots. Law-abiding citizens are protected, while the criminals become members of society in a futuristic prison system. This process ensures that convicted criminals remain productive members in a system of virtual slavery. The story encompasses the dichotomy between the theory and practice of a futuristic society's justice system.\nThe lamination process and system of virtual slavery has made both jails and the death penalty obsolete in a world where human ingenuity, creativity, and labor continue to be precious commodities that cannot be replaced by robots or any form of artificial intelligence. The system also sparks off philosophical debates among citizens presenting pros and cons of the ethical feasibility of \"Lamination\".The story follows protagonists Sara Integra and Jack Griswold's struggle against Cerra's system of imprisonment. Major Sara Integra is a former weapons specialist in bio-weapons division. While she was on a military assignment, innocent lives were lost during an experiment gone wrong. She was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 200 years encased in a laminated suit. Sara forever became known as Eve, or Eve1135.\nWhen she became a LaMB, Eve was assigned a Shepherd. Shepherds control the actions and movement of the LaMBs. Included among the laws of society are that LaMBs must only act upon instructions of their Shepherds. While LaMBs can hear others, they cannot speak, nor can they touch another human being unless ordered by their Shepherd. Dr. Jack Griswold was assigned to be Eve's Shepherd.\nGriswold is a scientist from another planet, specializing in advanced botanical engineering. He has been assigned the task to restore vegetation to the dry, desert planet. Among Griswold's superiors is Keiko Suzuki, Chief Scientific Advisor specializing in biophysics, and Sara Integra's niece. She has been deeply affected by the death of her parents, and her aunt's imprisonment, and lamination and has made revenge her ultimate goal in life.\nGriswold tends to display workaholic traits, presumably in order to forget the recent loss of his wife. His curiosity and soul-searching thirst to understand the complexities of the universe drives his research. He tends to spend more time in the lab than anywhere else and his intense focus on his research makes him appear awkward when in comes to social interaction. Griswold inadvertently gets pulled into the politics and ethics behind the system of \"Lamination\", as well as a romance with Eve.\nKeiko's anti-LaMB organization and conspiracy is discovered, and she is put into a lamb suit. Due to recent developments in technology her suit is part plant possibly. She goes on a rampage and tries to destroy Eve1135, but she is immobilized by touching Griswold while she attacked him.

She convinces him to finish his tachyon amplifier and go on an expedition to the Devil's Canyon Mystery Cave theme park where she found the fossil.\nAs they float into the cave on a small inflatable raft with the theme park's owner Will Stanton in the role of a paddler and narrator, Marshall detects high levels of tachyons. Activating the tachyon amplifier triggers an earthquake, opening a time warp the raft falls into.

They rescue an apeman by the name of Chaka, who becomes their friend and guide.\nThey spend a night in a cave where they have taken refuge from the pursuing telepathically endowed tyrannosaur they nickname \"Grumpy\", who develops a grudge against Marshall for being intellectually disparaged. Marshall receives a telepathic invocation for help and is being drawn to run towards ancient ruins, where they encounter reptiloids called the Sleestak before meeting Enik the Altrusian, who sent the message. Exiled by the Zarn, who wants to take over Earth with his Sleestak minions, Enik can prevent the invasion if Marshall gets the tachyon amplifier.\nLed by Chaka, the group enters a rocky wasteland littered with artefacts from different epochs, encountering compsognathuses, dromaeosaurs, Grumpy, and a female allosaur nicknamed \"Big Alice\". These last two are battling it out over the remains of an ice-cream seller killed by the dromaeosaurs, until they sense Marshall and chase him. Marshall kills Big Alice with liquid nitrogen, finding the amplifier was eaten by the allosaur. But a pteranodon snatches the tachyon amplifier into its caldera incubator. Treading lightly on the thin volcanic-glass floor of the glowing caldera, Marshall gives himself over to the music of A Chorus Line coming from the tachyon amplifier, and dancingly meanders between the pterosaur eggs towards the device. When he reaches it, the playback suddenly stops. The eggs begin to hatch, and they realize the music was keeping the baby pterosaurs asleep.

The detective in charge is Chandler Manning and his rookie assistant is Street Wilkenson. They initially believe this is a stand-alone murder, but when a second prostitute is killed, the medical examiner says the two murders are not only eerily similar to two murders that took place 7 years prior, but they are exact copies of the first two Jack the Ripper murders in 1888 London. Since Detective Manning had caught who he thought was the murderer of the previous crimes, they now realize the wrong person was tried, prosecuted and executed. Manning is also dealing with a wife who tried to commit suicide, and his estranged daughter, Amanda, who blames him for the attempt.\nIn a second story line, a couple is looking to rent their guest house when a passerby comes to the door and says he wishes to rent the room. Ellen Bunting takes the lodger, Malcolm Slaight, to see the room and he immediately agrees to rent the guest house but says several times he cannot be disturbed since he is a writer, and needs complete quiet. When Ellen's husband, Joe, asks her why the \"for rent\" sign has been removed, she says she has rented the room but the lodger needs to be left alone. Joe does not believe she has rented the guest house because he never sees anyone coming or going from the premises, and because he knows his wife has episodes where she imagines things and needs to take medication. Ellen begins to have feelings for the lodger and she goes out of her way to see him. She catches him in their kitchen late one night and when he says he was looking for scissors, she reaches across him to pick up and hand him a pair, but he just takes them and walks out.\nThe ripper copycat then commits two more murders, but this time he is seen by a witness who describes a man with a long black coat and a black bag. Manning notices a garbage can near the murder site with BATTY written on it; when he opens the lid, he finds a pair of bloody underwear that belong to one of the victims. Wilkenson is suspicious of how he knew there was something in the can, but Manning references the previous ripper murders and how they found a portion of clothing from one of the victims. Manning then goes to the old case files for the man he had previously arrested for the murders 7 years ago, and takes evidence of a letter that was written to him after the arrest had taken place. While there, he pulls his gun on the evidence clerk and tells him to stop following him.\nEllen continues to make contact with the lodger by taking him breakfast and tea - anything to be near him. On one visit she sees a pair of her husband's boots drying on a newspaper, and Malcolm states they got muddy when he walked in the garden. The lodger then kisses her, and Joe can be seen in the house, beginning to head for the guest house. As he is nearing, Ellen opens the door and walks out with the boots, saying she was cleaning them. She sees a picture in the newspaper of a footprint taken of boots that is linked to the crime, and puts the sole of the boot on top of the picture, but then does nothing despite realizing that they are the same size. Joe, getting tired of what he thinks is Ellen's hallucination, forces her next door and tells her he doesn't want to hear another word about the imaginary lodger if they see no one in the room. When the door opens, no one is there and Ellen is left sitting in the rain while Joe disgustedly walks back to the house.\nManning and Wilkenson begin investigating the suspects that are known to frequent the area where the killings are taking place, and this brings them into contact with Joe Bunting. They visit the Bunting home, and Ellen acts suspiciously when she takes them to see the guest house. They leave to get a warrant to search the place, but Manning is pulled into a meeting with the Captain of the precinct and the Mayor. Since he threatened the evidence clerk while at the station, they feel this - combined with his personal life - is causing him to lose touch with reality and they place him on suspension. Det. Wilkenson is left trying to solve the case without the assistance of Manning and when he sees Manning's name on a suspect list, he goes to the Captain. The Captain believes Manning is delusional and psychotic, and not only committed the murders 7 years ago but is obsessed with Jack the Ripper and is committing murders again, just so he can solve them. Manning realizes that the Captain suspects him and observes the Captain and officers searching his apartment, and that they have taken the letter he had stolen from evidence.\nEllen, believing Malcolm is guilty but not caring, goes to the guest house to wipe it clean of any evidence he was ever there, and disturbs a cabinet, causing a gush of red liquid that appears to be blood to spill from it. Malcolm walks in then and confronts her about why she is there and says a bottle of red ink must have spilled. Ellen goes to the house to wash her hands and Malcolm walks in, carrying a black bag. Ellen - realizing he is either about to leave, or worse, kill her - says she will not tell anyone what she has seen and will do anything to protect him. Malcolm appears to let her take the bag from his hand. Meanwhile, Joe is at work and finds that the police have been there to talk to him and becomes agitated.\nManning goes to Wilkenson to ask him for help, as there has been yet another murder, leaving only one woman left to be killed before the murderer disappears. Wilkenson agrees and they get the warrant they need to search the Bunting's guest house but initially find nothing. Manning then realizes the cabinet has not been opened and when they do, in it are maps with red ink and prints on them. Wilkenson and the Captain both look suspiciously at Manning because they believe he is planting evidence, and Wilkenson cuffs Manning to escort him in, though they also place a call to pick up Joe at work. When the police arrive, they realize Joe is no longer there.\nWe see Manning's daughter, Amanda, leaving her dorm at college and being observed by someone in the shadows. Manning notices two maps at the scene, one of London during the Ripper murders and another of Hollywood, marking the current killing. He sees that the marks on the map line up for the past murders, except now there is a new mark on the Hollywood map that does not line up, and it is exactly where his daughter's dorm is. He talks Wilkenson into removing the cuffs and they head off to grab Amanda, but she is walking down the street, headed to a local venue. She is being followed by someone in a long black coat, wearing boots and begins to run.\nShe stops and turns when she hears the sirens but the ripper has moved to the side and attempts to attack her when she stops. Manning sees the attack and runs off after the ripper, while Wilkenson stays with Amanda. The ripper is chased into the Bunting home where Manning, the Captain and several officers enter. We see Ellen in the living room, sitting in a rocking chair, wielding a long, curved knife. She drops the knife when they enter and go upstairs; they find Joe has been cut up very badly but is still alive.\nThe ending provides an explanation for the killings; Ellen became schizophrenic by the death of her baby in child birth 8 years ago, and this sent her into a spiral of killing. She also made up the imaginary life that her son lived, and the lodger, who was a romantic interest for her. Though the police and the press accept that this is the truth and Ellen is the killer, Manning does not believe it and the last scene is Malcolm, at a new residence in Santa Monica, looking for new lodgings.", "tmdb_id": 15052}, "26114073": {"title": "Logorama", "plot": "The short opens with a panorama of Los Angeles where all of its buildings and inhabitants are in some form of commercial branding: birds are in the form of Bentley and Aston Martin logos and MSN's butterfly; pedestrians are in the shape of the AIM icon; and overhead highway signs are mounted on Atlantic Records logos, among others.

This causes Linda to get jealous and fear Josh may be cheating on her. Although Josh tries to assure her that he is only trying to help an old friend, Linda tells him that it was Candace's own fault for being who she is and that he should only socialize with a higher class of people. Conversely, Candace sees right through Linda upon meeting her and tells Josh that it will never work between them since they are too different: Linda is a spoiled brat who considers people who have a lower status than her as inferior, while Josh actually cares about helping anyone he sees in trouble.\nDriving to Madea's anger management counseling, another car cuts ahead of Cora's car fueling Madea's aggression.

She subsequently allowed her anger at him and the trauma from the rape to consume her, which led to her dropping out of school and becoming a drug addict and prostitute. But with everything she learned from Ellen and Madea, she finally decides to forgive Josh and pick up the pieces of her life.\nOn Josh's wedding day, Chuck, serving as best man, tells him that Linda falsified Candace's file.

However, his uncle (Achyuth Kumar) is the only exception. His friend Satish (Sathish Ninasam) is a neighbour and cable operator, whose love for one of their neighhour - Bhamini, is unrequited. Bhamini marries a software engineer, and at the wedding reception, tells Manu that she loves him, but couldn't live with him (given his status). She also asks him to do something with his life, and not throw it away by spending his time criticizing the people around him. Meanwhile, Satish takes note of the \"gulf\" between Bhamini's new husband and himself, and decides to prove himself that he is indeed more worthy than she thinks of him. To that end, Manohar and Satish get together and invent a \"electricity producing machine\" which harnesses its power from vehicles that drive on roads (the fact that this isn't free energy, and that it would cost motorists who drive over it some extra fuel is not mentioned in the movie). His demonstration goes off well, but a police car chasing a criminal on a motorbike suddenly drives onto the machine, which causes the car to flip over, and in fact nearly kills the constables inside.\nManu and Satish are arrested and reprimanded for their foolishness, but they are soon released. Manu's aunt decides to marry him into a wealthy family, to get rid of him and an attempt to temper his behaviour. While they are visiting the intended's family, a baby next to Manu begins urinating. Manu takes a nearby tea-cup to catch the urine and prevent getting wet. Everyone sees this and his prior behavior as confirmation that he is mentally unstable. Manohar and Satish, both drunk, stop at an isolated hill top and tell one another their opinions about life; they get into a row. Satish drives off leaving behind Manohar.\nManohar walks back home and sees a van coming from a distance. The van is transporting about a dozen patients bound for an asylum. The inmates cause a commotion in the van, the guards loose order of the inmates' paperwork and photographs but the inmates are subdued by the guards. The van stops so that the guards can relieve themselves, and the patient Mahendra escapes. Manu was near the van when the guards went after the escapee. The guards notice him and take him as the escapee. Manohar is forcibly taken to the Kaamanabillu asylum.\nAt the asylum, Manohar demonstratively attempts to explain the mix-up but he is not believed. Soon, his family find out and go to remove him from the  asylum. An altercation between Manohar and another inmate cause the family to rethink their decision to take him away because they believe he insane. So, they decide to leave him there. Manu's life is thrown out of gear, as he realizes that he has no choice but to live the life of a lunatic, although he is not. He settles down and starts bonding with the patients: Dollar (played by Pawan Kumar (of Lucia (2013 film) fame), who is a brilliant engineer, but considered a lunatic when one of his inventions, - a baby ass washing machine - injures a baby. He also bonds with Raju Thalikote, who is a self declared veteran of the asylum. Manu soon discloses his story to Shankrappa, who advises him to talk to Dollar, who in turn has always had an uncanny knack to escape from the asylum.\nSoon, Manu manages to slip out, but during his escape, which takes him through the female wing of the asylum, he catches a glimpse of Devika (played by Aindrita Ray) and is smitten by her. Although he escapes, he changes his mind and returns to the asylum to pursue a relationship with her. As they are not allowed to mingle by the asylum staff, the inmates (under Shankrappa's leadership) hatch and execute a plan to allow Manu to meet Devika. Shankrappa is well aware of the doctors' tendency to perform the exact opposite to what he request them to do - since they perceive him to be insane - and he uses this to get them all sent for electro-shock therapy (since the EST room is within the women's wing). Dollar has manufactured a non-conducting gel which they then switch with the EST gel, so that they're not really affected by the shock. They fake syncope, and when the staff leave for a prayer assembly, they sneak out to meet Devika. It turns out that Devika is sleeping (having been given an illegal pill, by a doctor who, unbeknownst to everyone engages in (implied) sexual abuse of female inmates, using the pill). Nonetheless, Manu - with Shankrappa's assistance, carries Devika to an ambulance, and drives it out of the asylum.\nDevika is a dental student who is in the asylum as she has cultivated intense misandry, after a lecturer misbehaved with her. This manifests itself as aggressive behaviour from time to time, where she stabs any man she deems dangerous. When she awakens the morning after being spirited away by Manu, she attacks him. However, Manu manages to subdue her and professes his love to her. Devika and Manu decide to return to the asylum. On the way, at Devika's insistence, they take a temporary detour to her childhood home, where Devika has a flashback - of her uncaring father (who drove her mother to suicide). They then proceed to the asylum, but stop for the night. Manu spouts a monologue of his love for her, once she sleeps - and this is recorded by a CCTV camera that was activated accidentally by Devika, when they had hit a bump in the road earlier. The next morning, she discovers this, but while waking up Manu, unintentionally scares and nearly kills him when he falls down a railway overbridge. Manu is angry, and is about to leave her to her own devices, when she laughs at his rant, and he is smitten again. As they continue on foot (the van having run out of fuel), even as Manu pleads with her to go back (and not to the hospital). She doesn't respond right up until they go to the hospital, and convinces Manu to re-enter it.\nAs their relationship reaches serious levels, Devika asks Manu point blank whether he is capable of cheating her, to which the latter replies in the negative. However, once the escaped inmate (Mahendra) is caught, and brought to the asylum by the police (Mahendra is a murderer), the staff realise their mix-up. However, in front of everyone, they accuse Manu of being complicit in the charade, so that he could enjoy a free ride at the hospital. Devika construes this as Manu's betrayal, and of the disingenuousness of his love, and spurns him. A shattered Manu is thrown out of the asylum, bidding a tearful farewell to his fellow inmates with whom he had developed a bond. As he leaves, he encounters Dollar (who had managed to finally escape) returning to the asylum, claiming that there was nothing in the world worth living for outside the asylum.\nWhen he arrives at his uncle's place however, he is once again exposed to the ridicule of people.\nThe movie ends with Devika encountering him near his house. It is shown that she is cured of her dementia when she remembered Manu, who helped her to let go of her painful past, and move on; when she fought back the abusive doctor, and having watched the tape again, Devika is convinced that his love for her was real. The doctors have also concluded that Manu was responsible for \"curing\" Devika, and she says that is why she has returned to him; but Manu says that he himself is deemed to be uncured, and insane - being laughed at by society. Devika asks him, rather nonchalantly, as to how could that be his problem, and Manu comes around - with both of them pitying society, and walking away. The final scene closes with a voice-over, of a line that Shankrappa had delivered to Manu when the latter first arrived at the asylum - \"Those in this world that come to an asylum, are those who can be cured. The ones who cannot be cured at all, remain outside. There's a chance that you'll be cured of madness, which is something that others outside don't have. Wheover comes here is only temporarily mad, but the ones on the outside are permanently so.\"\nThe movie has shades of \"One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\", the conundrum illustrated in \"Catch-22\" and also shows the 'institutionalisation' depicted in \"The Shawshank Redemption\". The main thrust of the movie is to show the hypocrisy of a society which classifies behaviours, and, by extension, people into 'normal' and 'abnormal'.", "tmdb_id": 463203}, "25517880": {"title": "Maneater (2009 film)", "plot": "A former FBI profiler, now a sheriff of a small town and single parent of a high school-aged daughter, begins to profile a series of unexplained murders only to find out that the monster he's profiling may be himself.", "tmdb_id": 54753}, "27476784": {"title": "Mangatyanan", "plot": "The film tells the story of Himalaya \"Laya\" Marquez, a 27-year-old travel photographer who projects a cold, aloof persona to her family and workmates.

At first bypassed but selected after a plea by his teacher during the school visit, Li seems bewildered although piqued by the gruff preliminary inspection screening at the provincial capital city of Qingdao. Forwarded to a Beijing audition for a place in Madame Mao's Dance Academy, he is admitted for ballet training based on a series of physique and flexibility examinations.\nYears of arduous training follow, Li surpassing his initial lukewarm interest and mediocre performance after inspiration from senior teacher Chan (whose advocacy of classical Russian ballet as opposed to the politically aimed, physically strident form required by Madame Mao leads to the teacher's apparent banishment).

Li's determined courage garners a formerly disparaging teacher to influence the Academy to allow him the opportunity for a three-month stay in the United States.\nLi's encounters with US life cause questioning of the Chinese Communist Party dictates upon which he has been raised, and he begins a relationship with an aspiring American dancer, Elizabeth Mackey. Quickly attracting the attention of the local ballet scene, Li together with Stevenson requests a time extension in America, but the Chinese government refuses. Overwhelmed by the opportunities offered in America and in love with Mackey, Li is determined to stay. With legal advice that the Chinese government would recognize certain residence rights arising from an international marriage, Li and Mackey rush into a marriage. To declare personal responsibility for his decision and hopefully avoid consequences for his family and Stevenson, Li visits the Chinese Consulate in Houston.

At school, she is teased by her classmates because of an unfortunate birthmark on her forehead. While at home, her distant father, Noel, and alcoholic, kleptomaniac mother, Vera, provide little support. Her only comforts are her pet rooster, Ethel; her favourite food, sweetened condensed milk; and a Smurfs-like cartoon show called The Noblets. One day, while at the post office with her mother, Mary spots a New York City telephone book and, becoming curious about Americans, decides to write to one. She randomly chooses Max Jerry Horowitz's name from the phone book and writes him a letter telling him about herself, sending it off hoping he will become her pen pal.\nMax Jerry Horowitz (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a morbidly obese 44-year-old Jewish atheist who has trouble forming close bonds with other people due to various mental and social problems. Though Mary's letter initially gives him an anxiety attack, he decides to write back to her, and the two quickly become friends (partly due to their shared love of chocolate and The Noblets). Due to Vera's disapproval of Max when she receives his first letter, Mary tells him to send his letters to her agoraphobic neighbour, Len Hislop, whose mail she collects regularly. When Mary later asks Max about love, he suffers a severe anxiety attack and is institutionalised for eight months. After his release, he is hesitant to write to Mary again for some time. On his 48th birthday, he wins the New York Lottery, using his winnings to buy a lifetime supply of chocolate and an entire collection of Noblet figurines. He gives the remainder to his elderly neighbour, Ivy, who uses most of it to pamper herself before dying in an accident with a malfunctioning jet pack. Meanwhile, Mary becomes despondent, thinking Max has abandoned her.\nMax finally writes back to Mary on the advice of his therapist and explains he has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome.

Mary and Damien grow closer following Vera's death and are later married.\nInspired by her friendship with Max, Mary studies psychology at university, writing her doctoral dissertation on Asperger syndrome with Max as her case study. She plans to have her dissertation published as a book, but when Max receives a copy from her, he is infuriated, believing that she has taken advantage of his condition, which he sees as an integral part of his personality and not a disability that needs to be cured. Feeling betrayed and unable to put his emotions into words, he breaks off communication with Mary (by removing the letter \"M\" from his typewriter), who, heartbroken, has the entire run of her book pulped, effectively ending her budding career. She sinks into depression and begins drinking cooking sherry, as her mother had done. While searching through a cabinet, she finds a can of condensed milk and sends it to Max as an apology in an attempt to heal wounds. She checks the post daily for a response and one day finds a note from Damien, informing her that he has left her for his own pen-friend, Desmond, a sheep farmer in New Zealand.\nMeanwhile, after an incident in which he nearly chokes a homeless man (Ian \"Molly\" Meldrum) in anger for throwing away a used cigarette, Max realizes Mary is an imperfect human being, like himself, and sends her a package containing his Noblet figurine collection as a sign of forgiveness. Mary, however, has sunken into despair after Damien's departure and fails to find the box on her doorstep for several days. Finding some Valium that had belonged to her mother, and unaware that she is pregnant with Damien's child, Mary decides to commit suicide. As she takes the Valium and is on the verge of hanging herself, Len knocks on her door, having conquered his agoraphobia to alert her of Max's package.

However, because of the political situation in China at the time, the battle, which would be later known as \"The Battle of Luohu\", was held at the Sham Chun River, the border between Hong Kong and Shenzhen. The two battled all night, but the match was eventually stopped by a Zen master. Returning home, the headmaster had strongly believed that he had lost the encounter, and thus went into seclusion, trying to modernize Taoist Kung Fu with little success. He then turned his attentions to opening the Spring Flowers Gate, taking on the guise of Brother Panda to get new recruits and to comfort students at the academy. McDull, moved by his sacrifices, decides to return to training, and calls his mother to tell her to attend the competition.\nEventually, the day of the competition arrives. While at the competition, McDull notices his friend from Hong Kong, May, who had enrolled in a \"wire-fu\" summer camp sponsored by Yuen Woo-Ping, also competing in the contest. Meanwhile, the headmaster has also received a revelation: at the competition, the headmaster of a rival school greets him, stating that he was a student of Pruce Lee. He goes on to state that Pruce had thought highly of the headmaster, and believed that the headmaster had won their encounter. Because of this, he had spent his last years extensively studying Taoist martial arts, and had written a book about the subject, which was dedicated to him.\nMeanwhile, the Mak-zi artifact had wound up at the site of the competition, and, in front of a large televised audience just as McDull's match was about to begin, the artifact suddenly comes to life, revealing to itself as a crudely made clock in the shape of a chicken powered by cow feces which could count 100,000 years, 100 years at a time, using a complex holographic system. Inspired by the sight before her, Mrs. Mak decides to move back to Hong Kong to start a new business. McDull, having been beaten up badly in the competition, also returned to Hong Kong, having discovered Mak-zi's original blueprints for the clock in the meantime. Having returned home, McDull proceeded to build a new clock using the blueprints as a guide.\nThe story is concluded by a flashback from an adult May, who had gone on to become an office worker, suddenly noticing McDull's clock in the sky. Taking a break from her mundane life, she traces the clock to its location, and find a quaint restaurant in the middle of Hong Kong's concrete jungle, run by the adult McDull.\nThroughout the film, viewers were also treated into various stories involving Mak-zi, in a pseudo-documentary style, narrated by Jim Chim.", "tmdb_id": 23698}, "23440490": {"title": "Me Shivajiraje Bhosale Boltoy", "plot": "Dinkar Maruti Bhosale represents thousands of Maharashtrians, who feel they have lost their identity in the cosmopolitan Mumbai.

Outside Ultra's orbit in the Space Prison, also known as the Belial Prison, Alien Zarab assumed the guise of an Imitation Ultraman to subdue the guards before using the Giga Battlenizer to release the prison's only occupant: The evil Ultraman known as Ultraman Belial. While Zarab was expecting an alliance, Belial kills the alien and takes back his Giga Battlenizer as he is confronted by a squadron of Ultras led by Ultraman Taro to contain him. But Belial overpowers them while proceeding to overpower every able-bodied Ultra in the Land of Light, including his former friends Ultraman Ken (Father of Ultra) and his wife Ultrawoman Marie (Mother of Ultra), as he makes his way to the Plasma Spark Tower to take the Plasma Spark which keeps the planet alive. As the planet begins freezing over, Ultraman and Ultraseven shielding themselves at the last moment, Taro protects the last fragment of light to prevent the planet's complete demise. As Belial flies off, having knocked the younger Ultraman off the planet during his rampage, Mebius returns to find his world a frozen wasteland while Ultraman and Ultraseven instruct Mebius to seek out the Reionics Rei.\nFollowing their battle against Alien Reiblood, the ZAP Spacy group have arrived on the Earth-like Planet known as Dent where Rei and his Gomora just defeated a Zaragas when Mebius spirits Rei and appears in the form of his human guise Mirai Hibino. Mirai tells Rei the genesis of Planet Ultra: How the Plasma Spark initially created to replace M78's collapsing sun caused the evolution of the residential advanced human populace into Ultramen who used their powers to protect worlds from monsters also created by the radiation. But Belial was an exception, his temptation to gain more power from the Plasma Spark resulted in his banishment when he nearly endangered the planet. Belial ended up encountering Alien Reiblood, who fused into the Ultraman's body and further corrupted him into an Ultraman-Reionics. Belial used his ability to control hundreds of monsters with the Giga Battlenizer to raid the Land of Light in what came to be known Belial Revolt, nearly conquering the planet before being defeated and imprisoned in the newly created Space Prison by Ultraman King while his weapon was sealed away in Valley of Fire before it was found by Zarab. Rei agrees to aid the Ultraman in facing Belial, who has arrived to the Monster Graveyard to resurrect his army with the Plasma Spark's power.\nRei and Mirai soon land on the frozen surface of the Land of Light, ambushed on their journey to the Plasma Spark Tower by an Alien Shaplay that Belial sent with a Dorako, a Bemstar, and a Saramandora to intercept them. During the fight, Mirai's Mebium Brace is damaged by the Shaplay and Rei nearly loses his Battlenizer, but Ultraman, assuming a human form modeled after his host Shin Hayata, and Ultraseven in his Dan Moroboshi guise come to the youths' aid as the later uses his Capsule Monsters Windom, Miclas, and Agira to defeat the Shaplay's monsters. On the way to the tower, it is revealed there is another Ultraman who can assist but Ultraseven reveals that person was also exiled from Ultra. While the group arrived to the tower, they find themselves facing a now-revenge driven Shaplay while Rei and Gomora face a Black King. Once their opposition is dispatched, Taro gives the three Ultramen the last of the Plasma Spark's light to assume their Ultraman forms in a last ditch attempt to reclaim the Plasma Spark from Belial. Meanwhile, sent to a desert planet after almost touching the Plasma Spark when stopped by Ultraseven, the Ultraman known as Zero undergoes training by Ultraman Leo in training armor while observed by Ultraman King.\nOnce at the Monster Graveyard, the Ultramen and Rei's monsters battle Belial's army with Belial sensing kinship in Rei as he pressures the human to join him. When Rei refuses again, Belial uses his power to force the human into his Burst Mode and under Belial's control. Gomora assumes Reionic Burst Mode as it proceeds to attack the Ultramen with Ultraseven mortally wounded. Elsewhere in the universe, the ZAP Spacy crew are searching for Rei before they are saved from an ambush by a Nurse and its Alien Zetton wrangler by Ultraman Dyna who agrees to take them to the Monster Graveyard after they learned of Rei's location from the Zetton. Dyna attempts to fight Belial while the ZAP Spacy crew snaps Rei out of his Burst Mode. After brushing off Dyna, Belial attempts to kill the humans with Ultraseven taking the lethal attack before using the last of his strength to send his Eye Slugger to the desert planet where Zero is training. The crest-blade reached the planet just after Zero passed Leo's test when he saved the life of a Pigmon that was observing them. Both Leo and Ultraman King inform Zero that he saved the life of someone, the purpose of being an Ultraman, and they finally reveal to him that Ultraseven is his father and that his actions were to prevent Zero from the taking the path Belial took. Casting aside his training armor while using his father's Eye Slugger as a homing device, Zero reaches the Monster Graveyard and introduces himself as Ultraman Zero.\nAfter Ultraseven died in his arms, an infuriated Zero defeated the remaining monsters of Belial's Monster Army before battling the evil Ultraman himself. After a long and vicious battle, Zero disarms Belial of the Giga Battlenizer and knocks him into a river of molten lava. But the souls of Belial's monsters converge on their master and form a massive exosuit-like monster called Belyudra which Belial has overpower the Ultramen. But Rei uses Giga Battlenizer to disrupt Belial's hold over the monsters, leaving Belyudra open to attack while Zero uses the Plasma Spark's energy to give him enough power to end Belial as he falls into Belyudra as it explodes. After the Plasma Spark is restored to its rightful place, the ZAP Spacy crew become the first humans to ever set foot on the Land of Light as they bid their goodbyes to Ultraman and Mebius as Dyna decides to accompany them a bit longer as his human host Shin Asuka. As Zero is reunited with a revived Ultraseven, the Ultras attend a moving speech by Ultraman King to remain ready for future threats that would threaten the universe. Back in the Monster Graveyard, a scarred Belial is revealed to have survived destruction of Belyudra.", "tmdb_id": 51948}, "22031391": {"title": "Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus", "plot": "Off the coast of Alaska, oceanographer Emma MacNeil is studying the migration patterns of whales aboard an experimental submarine she took without permission from her employer. Meanwhile, a military helicopter drops experimental sonar transmitters into the water, causing a pod of whales to go out of control and start ramming a nearby glacier. In the chaos, the helicopter crashes into the glacier, and the combined damage breaks the glacier open, thawing two hibernating, prehistoric creatures. MacNeil narrowly avoids destruction as, unknown to her, a giant shark and octopus are freed. Some time later, a drilling platform off the coast of Japan is attacked by the octopus, which has tentacles large enough to wrap around the entire structure. After returning to Point Dume, California, MacNeil investigates the corpse of a beached whale covered with many bloody wounds. Her employer Dick Richie believes them to be from a tanker propeller, but MacNeil insists they appear to be from a creature. Later, she extracts what appears to be a shark's tooth from one of the wounds. Elsewhere, the huge shark leaps tens of thousands of feet into the air from the ocean and attacks a commercial aircraft, forcing it to crash into the water.\nA review board convenes and fires MacNeil from the oceanographic institute for stealing the submarine. She brings the shark tooth to her old professor, former U.S. Navy pilot Lamar Sanders, who believes it belonged to a megalodon, an enormous species of shark believed to have become extinct 1.5 million years ago. The duo is visited by Dr. Seiji Shimada, a Japanese scientist trying to determine what attacked the drilling platform. The three review a videotape recorded during MacNeil's submarine voyage, finding images of both the megalodon and a gigantic octopus. MacNeil reflects on the polar ice caps melting due to man-made global warming, and wonders if the creatures are mankind's \"comeuppance\". Meanwhile, a U.S. \"naval destroyer\" engages the megalodon, but is destroyed after its guns fail to destroy the shark. MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada are arrested by a team of soldiers and taken to government official Allan Baxter, a rude and racist man who demands their help in destroying the creatures. The three agree to help, in exchange for the government trying to capture the creatures for study rather than destroy them.\nWhile working at a naval laboratory to develop a method for luring the creatures, MacNeil and Shimada become attracted to each other and have sex in a utility closet. The incident makes them realize they can attract the creatures using chemicals. MacNeil and Sanders agree to place a trap for the shark in San Francisco Bay, while Shimada returns to Tokyo to attract the octopus. MacNeil and Sanders barely escape the shark after placing the trap with a mini-submarine. The plan fails, however, when the shark destroys another destroyer sent by Baxter. The shark then resurfaces and bites off a large portion of the Golden Gate Bridge, killing many civilians on the bridge. Later, Shimada contacts the Americans and says the Japanese trap, having the same disaster, only succeeded in angering the octopus, which has escaped despite multiple artillery and missile hits. Baxter suggests using nuclear weapons against the creatures, which MacNeil, Sanders, and Shimada strongly oppose due to the risk of marine devastation, coastal damage and human casualties. As an alternative, MacNeil suggests using the same pheromone traps to create a \"Thrilla in Manila\" by drawing the two creatures together. She believes that because the two creatures were frozen in ice locked in combat, they must be natural rivals and their aggressiveness towards one another will cause them to fight to the death if they're lured together. MacNeil, Sanders, and Baxter are assigned to a submarine to find the shark and lure it to the North Pacific Ocean.\nAfter a short search, the submarine brings both the shark and the octopus to an ice trench off the Alaskan coast, where MacNeil first encountered the creatures. Sanders himself ends up piloting the sub after the original pilot loses his nerve and pulls a gun on the captain before he is overtaken. As the creatures meet, the octopus wraps itself around the shark and tries to suffocate it, but the shark bites its tentacles to escape and attacks the submarine. MacNeil, Sanders, and Baxter man a mini-submarine and detach just as the shark bites the larger submarine in half, killing the rest of the crew. The shark gives chase, but the mini-sub and its crew are saved when a Japanese submarine with Shimada on board fires torpedoes at it. The octopus grabs the Japanese submarine and nearly destroys it, but the sub is released after the octopus is attacked by the shark. The two creatures engage in a fierce battle, at the end of which, the octopus strangles the shark after the shark dismembers some of its tentacles, causing it to bleed to death. The two sink, dead, still locked from their battle.  McNeil and the others, after watching the showdown between the two monsters, discover Shimada and his sub survived the octopus attack.

The facility is highly automated, requiring only a single human to maintain operations, oversee harvester machines, and launch canisters bound for Earth containing the extracted helium-3. Samuel Bell nears the end of his three-year work contract at Sarang Station. Chronic communication problems have disabled his live feed from Earth and limit him to occasional recorded messages from his wife Tess, who was pregnant with their daughter Eve when he left. His only companion is an artificial intelligence named GERTY, who assists with the base's automation and provides comfort for him.\nTwo weeks before his return to Earth, Sam begins to suffer from hallucinations of a teenage girl and a bearded, disheveled man. One such image distracts him while he is out recovering a helium-3 canister from a harvester, causing him to crash his lunar rover into the harvester. Rapidly losing cabin air from the crash, Sam falls unconscious.\nSam awakes in the base infirmary with no memory of the accident. He overhears GERTY having what appears to be a live chat with Lunar Industries management. Lunar Industries then orders Sam to remain on base and informs him that a rescue team will arrive to repair the harvester. Suspicious, Sam manufactures a fake problem to persuade GERTY to let him outside. He travels to the crashed rover, where he finds his unconscious doppelganger. He brings the double back to the base and tends to his injuries. The two Sams start to wonder if one is a clone of the other. After a heated argument and physical altercation, GERTY reveals that they are both clones of the original Sam Bell. GERTY activated the newest clone after the rover crash and convinced him that he was at the beginning of his three-year contract. GERTY confirms his memories of his wife and daughter are implanted.\nThe two Sams search the area, finding a communications substation beyond the facility's perimeter which has been interfering with the live feed from Earth. GERTY helps the older Sam access the recorded logs of past Sam clones, showing them all falling ill as their contract expires. Later, the older Sam discovers a secret vault containing hundreds of hibernating clones. They determine that Lunar Industries is unethically using clones of the original Sam Bell to avoid the cost of training and transporting new astronauts, as well as deliberately jamming the live feed in order to prevent the clones from contacting Earth; clones who believe they are entering the final hibernation at the end of their contract just before their final return to Earth are in fact incinerated. The older Sam clone drives past the interference radius in a second rover and tries to call Tess on Earth. He instead makes contact with Eve, now 15 years old, who says Tess died \"some years ago\". He hangs up when Eve tells her father (offscreen, identified as \"Original Sam\" in closed captioning) that someone is calling regarding Tess. After he returns, the older Sam begins displaying the same symptoms as previous clones as they begin to deteriorate.\nThe two Sams realize that the incoming rescue team will kill them both if they are found together. The newer Sam convinces GERTY to wake another clone, planning to leave the awakened clone in the crashed rover and send the older Sam to Earth in one of the helium-3 transports. But the older Sam, having learned that the clones are designed to break down at the end of the 3-year contract, knows that he will not live much longer. With his health rapidly declining, the older Sam suggests that he be placed back into the crashed rover to die so that Lunar Industries will not suspect anything, while the newer Sam escapes instead.\nFollowing GERTY's advice, the newer Sam reboots GERTY to wipe its records of the events. Before leaving, the newer clone reprograms a harvester to crash and wreck the jamming antenna, thereby enabling live communications with Earth; he also brings along a canister of helium-3 to provide him with funds once he reaches Earth.

The next morning, she is discovered dead on the rooftop, shocking the town and pressuring the incompetent police to find the killer. Do-joon is arrested for the murder due to circumstantial evidence placing him near the scene of the crime. His mother believes he is innocent, and tries to prove he is not the murderer. However, she is challenged by her self-absorbed lawyer and the community who unanimously blames Do-joon for the crime.\nSuspecting Jin-tae of committing the murder, the mother breaks into his house to look for evidence.

The collector reveals that he has been troubled since he saw Do-joon kill Ah-jung. He witnessed the two have a short conversation, during which Ah-jung called Do-joon a \"retard\", and Do-joon then threw a large rock into the shadows in which Ah-jung was standing, hitting her in the head and inadvertently killing her, and then dragged her to the rooftop.

Fearing for her son, the mother bludgeons the collector with a wrench and sets fire to his house.\nLater, the police tell the mother that they have found the \"real\" killer: Jong-pal, who is being presumed guilty after Ah-jung's blood was found on his shirt. The police assume it got there during the murder, but the mother realizes that Jong-pal's story, that the blood is the result of Ah-jung's nose bleeding during consensual sex, is true.

Sara has no qualms over using Anna's body to treat Kate's, and fully believes she is doing so willingly, while Brian is closer to Anna and has his own misgivings.\nAfter Kate goes into kidney failure, Anna \u2013 with Jesse's help \u2013 approaches attorney Campbell Alexander, and tells him she wishes to sue for medical emancipation, on the basis that she will be required to donate one of hers, and that having just a single kidney will severely restrict her quality of life. Campbell, whose covert epilepsy lends him sympathy to her predicament, decides to take her case pro bono and, representing Anna as her guardian ad litem, he files a suit for partial termination of parental rights.

At first Charles resents Sami's presence in his house, but they gradually become friends. Sami enrolls in classes at Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, a private school there.\nSami is made fun of by many of his classmates at school, particularly Guilain Lambert (Mathieu Spinosi). He impresses the blonde violinist Marie (Jos\u00e9phine Japy), however, with his tender side: during a music class one of the pieces moves him to tears by making him think of his friends back in Chalon. He and Marie become friends. Guilain, who also has his eye on Marie, gets revenge by tricking Sami into eating pork (which Sami cannot eat, as it is haraam), and Sami retaliates by beating up Guilain. Marie chides Sami, saying she will not tolerate violent boys, but they soon make up. Later, though, when Guilain and Charles end up running against one another in the class elections, Guilain hires a local thug Malik (Booder) to mug Sami and Charles. They manage to escape from Malik and his thugs, but Malik gives Sami a black eye in the process; when Marie sees the black eye, she becomes angry with Sami, thinking he got in a fight again.\nSami and Charles decide to throw a party in their house, to try to win votes for Charles for the class delegate election. Marie comes to the party and has forgiven Sami, but before they can talk Malik and his friends show up to trash the house. Some friends Sami invited from Chalon (Shaiko Dieng and Pierre Louis Bellet), however, soon arrive, and with their help the partygoers give Malik a beating and chase him and his thugs away. Malik finds Guilain and, thinking Guilain set him up, gives him a beating that sends him to the emergency room. Guilain and his mother encounter Sami's aunt Djamila and uncle Stanislas at the hospital, and tell them that the beating was Sami's fault. Djamila, enraged, returns home and tells Sami she is sending him back to his mother.\nMarie finds Malik and pays him to tell the school headmistress (Josiane Balasko) that he is responsible for Guilain's beating, however he refuses the cash and told her that he had already told the story to the headmistress. The Headmistress informs Djamila, and she forgives Sami.  Charles wins the election with the help of a well-written letter to the class, and goes on to meet all of Sami's friends back in Chalon, urging them to remember his name and vote for him in the future.

Upon returning home, he finds Louisa's pet cat mutilated near the house.\nLouisa returns to the mound after school and, while relaxing in the sunshine, hears strange noises. As Louisa hears what sounds like approaching animal growls, the film jump-cuts to John cutting his hand while washing dishes. That night John finds a trail of muddy footprints leading from the open front door to the bathroom. Louisa is inside with the door locked, sitting in the tub as the shower washes her extremely muddied body. The muddy water is shown turning red with blood as it reaches the drain. Later that night, John finds Louisa sleepwalking. When he takes her back to bed, he finds a strange doll made from straw, inside which is a dark ball containing a live spider. The next morning Louisa comes down for breakfast wearing a short black dress and make-up. When John asks her about the doll, she claims not to have seen it.\nLouisa is bullied by a preppy girl in the staircase of their school. Meanwhile, at home, John comes across a pile of muddy clothes in her bedroom. While investigating outside the house, he finds the head of Louisa's doll at the mound, and the bloody remains of a blackbird.\nJohn is called to come to pick up Louisa, who says she does not feel well. In the infirmary he passes the preppy girl, who had apparently \"fallen\" down the stairs and injured her arm. Sam's teacher, Cassandra (Samantha Mathis), gives John her phone number, offering her friendship.\nHe is later startled to find a nest of spiders in the kitchen drawer where he'd placed the straw doll. That night John sees Louisa emerging from the woods, even though he had previously ordered her to be home by dark. He calls attention to scarring visible on the skin around her neck, but Louisa storms off without explanation. At dinner she eats in an animal-like manner, as if starved.\nJohn contacts Cassandra one night, and they meet socially. While John is away, Louisa hears noises outside the house and exits.\nAs John is returning home in his car, he sees a shadowy figure, which vaguely looks like Louisa, running through the woods in front of the house.\nHe exits his car and follows sounds of animal growls, but growing fearful, he rushes back to his car. A stone hits his window and he speeds back to the house.\nAsking Louisa if she'd been outside, she says no. He orders her not to go near the mound any more.\nThe next day, John's agent drives up to the house and they talk about the house.\nInside, Sam is directed by Louisa to climb the ladder to the attic. Sam falls when frightened by animal noises there. He requires stitches, and John berates Louisa for not caring for her younger brother.\nThat night, John searches the internet, finding an article about burial mounds.\nHe telephones an expert on the subject, Professor White (Noah Taylor), but is ignored. He then researches the previous owner of the house, Sarah Wayne; she disappeared one day without a trace, after having locked her teenage daughter Emily in her bedroom from the outside. Emily was eventually found alive and went to live with her grandfather, Roger Wayne (James Gammon).\nJohn leaves the children with a babysitter, Mrs. Amworth and goes to find Roger Wayne. As Louisa watches him drive away from her window, scarring can be seen on the nape of her neck. She then returns to the mound. John arrives at Roger Wayne's empty house, but lets himself in and looks around. In the girl's room he finds a strange nest made from twigs and straw, and a depiction of the burial mound drawn onto a wall with the word \"home\" below it. Roger arrives and confronts John with explanations of what had occurred with Emily, that he burned down his house with her inside, insisting that it wasn't his granddaughter anymore.\nWhile John is away, Mrs. Amworth is locked out of the house, and animal growls are heard approaching. Sam hides in his room as he hears the babysitter's cries for help.\nJohn arrives home, comforts a frightened Sam, and rushes to Louisa to ask what happened to the babysitter. She says she does not know. After reporting the babysitter's disappearance to police, John takes an ill Louisa to bed. She tearfully asks if he's going to leave her as her mother did. He tells her he never will.\nThat night, John dreams of a doorway on top of the burial mound and Louisa transforming into a creature who announces \"I'm your new daughter\".\nThe next day he finds a nest in Louisa's closet similar to the one at Roger's house. John calls a contractor to destroy the mound that day. Professor White, having called back to ask about the mound, suddenly arrives and pleads with John to wait. He tells John of an ancient civilization who worshiped the burial mounds, believing them to be the homes of ancient Gods, or \"mound-walkers\".\nHe mentions a ritual exchange of gifts \u2014 including small straw dolls, as John had found \u2014 and the mound-walkers' search for a young girl with whom to mate and give birth to a new generation of deities to reclaim the earth.\nHorrified by this, John instructs the bulldozer to start. When it digs into the mound, the body of Mrs. Amworth is uncovered. Louisa, meanwhile, in the schoolyard, is scraping the ground with her fingers. John is taken to the police station for questioning while Cassandra looks after the kids.\nThat night, as officer Ed Lowry (Erik Palladino) drives John home, they are attacked and Lowry is dragged from the patrol car by a creature.\nJohn continues home, discovering it in disarray and finding Cassandra with her throat slit. She dies while motioning toward Louisa standing in the doorway. \nJohn gathers the children to leave, but Louisa refuses. Mound-walkers begin attacking the house, and John kills three.\nAfter the attack, Louisa is missing. Her screams can be heard coming from the mound. John leaves Sam in his room, tells him to wait for the police, and tells him \"be a big boy\".\nJohn goes to the mound to rescue Louisa and finds a tunnel leading into it. He pierces a can of gasoline, sets explosives left from the postponed demolition by the tunnel entrance, sparks a flare for light and crawls inside. Louisa is found unconscious and covered in mud. As he carries her out, angered creatures howl and give chase. Meanwhile, Sam has exited the house, clutching a framed family portrait and looking into the dark toward sounds coming from the mound.\nJohn escapes the mound with Louisa and blocks the tunnel with the leaking fuel canister, but another mound-walker is already there outside. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John looks down at her and sees her beginning to transform into one of the creatures. He drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. As Sam watches, the flames are reflected on the glass of the frame.

Omar is then taken into custody and interrogated by FBI Agent Roshan, also a Muslim man originally from South Asia who has been living in the United States for twenty years. Omar then discovers that he was set up by the FBI to force him to spy on a former college friend, Terrorist Sameer \"Sam\" Sheikh, whom he has not seen in seven years and who the FBI believes is a terrorist. In the process, Omar discovers that Sam has married Maya, a mutual friend whom Omar had a crush on in university and finds out that Sam and Maya have a young son, Danyal.\nRoshan orders Omar to tell him everything he knows about Sam. The film then flashes back to September 1999, when Omar begins his studies at the New York State University. He is befriended by his international student counselor Maya and learns that though she was born and raised in New York, she is fluent in Hindi because of her mother's interest in Bollywood films. Omar also meets Sam, an American Muslim who is also fluent in Hindi due to the fact that his father is a professor of Indian studies. Over the next two years, all three become inseparable friends and gradually Omar falls in love with Maya. When Omar realises that she loves Sam, however, he distances himself from them both. Their carefree days end with the onset of the September 11 attacks, or 9/11.\nAfter finishing his story, Omar agrees to help Roshan (rather reluctantly), if only to prove that both he and Sam are innocent. He reunites with Maya and Terrorist Sam and stays in their house, all the while spying for the FBI. Omar learns that Maya is a civil rights activist who is helping one of Sam's employees, Zilgai overcome his experience as a former 9/11 detainee. Zilgai was eventually released due to lack of evidence and has been having difficulty adjusting back to normal life.\nAs time progresses, Omar feels satisfied that he can find nothing to warrant the FBI's suspicions and is ready to leave when a series of events forces him to reconsider. In the process, Omar learns from Sam that ten days after 9/11, Sam was arrested and detained for a period of nine months as a suspected terrorist, a charge which everyone, including the FBI and Roshan, now agree was incorrect. Though he was eventually released due to lack of evidence, the impact of being detained and tortured permanently changed Sam in ways which are difficult for those surrounding him to understand, leaving him with feelings of deep resentment towards the FBI. Omar thus finds that Sam ultimately resorted to plans for terrorism as a means of revenge.\nIn addition, Maya is unable to help Zilgai resolve the trauma of being a detainee. After a routine traffic stop escalates and an NYPD police officer gives Maya a very rough full-body search, Zilgai becomes agitated. He drops Maya at her home and eventually kills the police officer the same night. After being declared a fugitive, Zilgai leads the police on a long chase ultimately ending in his suicide.\nThe climax of the film rests upon the attempts of Maya, Omar, and Roshan to prevent Sam from committing an act of terrorism by telling him that if he perpetuates towards terrorism, others will suffer as he has. Finally convinced, Sam surrenders and aborts his attempt to bomb the FBI building. However, the moment he drops his cell-phone (which was originally intended as a detonator for the bomb) he is shot and killed by FBI snipers.

Having turned fifty and developed writer's block, he conjures all the women in his life, both alive and deceased, for inspiration, including: Luisa (n\u00e9e Acari), his wife; Claudia Jenssen, his star actress; Carla Albanese, his mistress; Liliane \"Lilli\" La Fleur, his costume designer and confidant; Stephanie Necrophorus, an American fashion journalist from Vogue; Saraghina, a prostitute from his childhood; and his beloved Mamma (\"Overture Delle Donne\").\nHaving not yet formulated an idea for his new movie, Guido evades questions from reporters. In his mind, he wishes for both youthful naivet\u00e9 and the wisdom of age (\"Guido's Song\"). Escaping to the Bellavista Spa Hotel on the coast, he receives a seductive call from Carla while a doctor examines him (\"A Call from the Vatican\"). She comes to stay with him, but he hides her in a shabby pensione instead.\nDante, Guido's producer, brings much of the film's crew to work at the hotel. When Guido confesses to Lilli his dilemma, she urges him to use his film to entertain, inspired by the Folies Berg\u00e8re where she \"learnt her art\" (\"Folies Berg\u00e8res\"). Guido remembers Saraghina, a prostitute whom he and his schoolmates paid to teach them the joy of life's sensual pleasures (the art of love and sex) by dancing for them on a beach when he was nine years old (\"Be Italian\"), before he was caught by the priests and whipped.\nAt dinner, Guido is surprised to see Luisa, who recounts having abandoned her acting career to be his wife (\"My Husband Makes Movies\").  Carla arrives, and Luisa storms out; Guido orders Carla back to the pensione alone, leaving her heartbroken. Failing to pacify Luisa, Guido meets Stephanie in the hotel's bar, who confesses that he adores his movies\u2019 style rather than their substance (\"Cinema Italiano\"). Stephanie takes Guido to her room but, while watching her undress, he realizes he still cares for his wife.\nReturning to Luisa, he promises to discontinue cheating. As she embraces him, he is called away to help Carla, who has overdosed on pills in a suicide attempt. Guido stays with Carla, and has a vision of his mother singing him a lullaby when he was young (\"Guarda La Luna\"), advising him to repair his life. He leaves when Carla's husband Luigi arrives in the morning, and returns to find Luisa gone, while the film crew leaves for Rome.\nFilming in Rome, Guido phones Luisa to come that evening. When his leading lady, Claudia, senses there is no script, Guido confesses that he needs her to inspire one. His idea for the film resembles his own ordeal: a man lost and in love with so many women. Claudia responds that this man is incapable of love and that, while she loves him, she cannot keep playing the same part in his films or his life (\"Unusual Way\").\nWhile Guido is reviewing screen tests, Luisa arrives and is devastated to see him interact with an actress exactly as when he first met Luisa. After an argument and an angry, imaginary striptease (\"Take It All\"), Luisa permanently leaves Guido. Finally acknowledging the truth, Guido cancels the film, now abandoned by all those he has selfishly been exploiting (\"I Can\u2019t Make This Movie\"). He admits to the crew that there never was a movie to make, and has the set destroyed before he leaves Rome.\nTwo years later, at a caf\u00e9 in Anguillara, Guido sees an advertisement for a play starring Luisa, whom he sees leave the theater with another man. Lilli suggests he make another movie, but Guido\u2019s only idea is a man trying to win back his wife. Some time later, Guido is making that very film, directing actors representing a younger version of himself and Luisa, living in a small apartment and deeply in love. Guido's younger self assembles the cast of his entire life on the scaffolding behind him (\"Finale\"), as Luisa arrives and watches from the shadows, happy that Guido has returned to his former self.

Then a masked man enters and explains each of them is there for a reason, and to survive, they must figure out how they are all connected. He further explains that he will kill one of them every ten minutes until they figure it out. The kidnapper leaves and a countdown begins. The group begins introducing themselves, and a few early connections are made. Christian says he once borrowed money from Sully but paid it back. Coogan mentions he has been in multiple prisons. Kelley and Jackson are former lovers. Just as the group begins to think it is all a hoax, the kidnapper enters and shoots Christian.\nAfter the masked man leaves, Leon has Sully stomp on his hand until it breaks, freeing himself from his handcuffs.  He attempts to escape, but is caught and brought back by the shooter. The shooter then kills Coogan, who had mentioned earlier that he is dying anyway. The shooter whispers the reason in Coogan's ear, prompting Coogan to attack him before being shot. The shooter tells Leon he will be the next to die.\nWith seven people left, Mrs. Chan recognizes Kelley as her former lawyer after her store was robbed two years earlier. The group begins to see connections between themselves and the robber, Wade Greeley. The shooter returns, but as the seven only know part of the story, he shoots Leon.  With the theory in doubt, it becomes clear that Father Francis knows more than he is admitting, but refuses to give further information.  Eventually, it is determined that Greeley did not rob the store; the real robber, Christian, confessed to Father Francis that he committed the robbery to pay back Sully. However, when shown a line-up, Mrs. Chan mistakenly identified Greeley as the robber, and Kelley prosecuted him.\nAt this point, the shooter reenters, and since not all of the connections have been established, he tries to kill Eddie, but Father Francis puts himself in the path of the bullet and is killed instead. When Kelley identifies the shooter as Wade, he denies this and leaves. Once the shooter leaves, Sully realizes that before Christian robbed Mrs. Chan's store, he didn't have a gun, and must have bought one from Leon. The shooter enters and targets Mrs. Chan; instead of whispering the reason to her, he hands her a note written in Chinese. She pleads with him in Chinese (presumably revealing the shooter's motive to viewers who understand Chinese) before being shot. Kelley begs him to let her go to be with her son, but the shooter angrily berates Kelley for using her son as an excuse, and leaves, but not before hinting Jackson is the father of Kelley's baby.\nKelley confirms that Jackson is the father of her son, and also reveals she fabricated evidence to convict Greeley, saying she needed to win a case after many losses. She also reveals that Jackson unknowingly helped her falsify evidence, and that she once killed a man who raped her in self-defense, and swept it under the rug when the rapist's body was found. Eddie realizes the shooter must be Greeley's father, exacting revenge, and the remaining four begin to wonder what happened to Greeley after he went to prison. The shooter returns and kills Sully, who has no remorse for his actions.\nWith only Kelley, Jackson, and Eddie left, the three struggle to establish connections for Eddie and Coogan. Eddie supposes that Coogan was earlier referring to being infected with AIDS (since he mentioned the others being harmed by \"blood splatter\"), and, as he has been in multiple prisons, could have raped Greeley and infected him. Then the final connection is made; Greeley applied for an experimental drug treatment for HIV from Eddie's company, but Eddie would have had to reject him due to his criminal conviction. They explain this to the shooter, Greeley's father, who removes his mask and agrees to let them all go. Kelley is released, but, having slowly revealed her true nature, steals the gun and shoots Greeley's father, Eddie, and Jackson.

None of the facility's 25 team members, led by Professor Borman, have been heard from in three days, so Jack is sent to check up on them. However, he instead finds the facility abandoned with signs of struggle, cryptic messages scrawled on the walls in Arabic with blood, and even the remains of a ritual where a jackal was skinned and sacrificed. He calls this in to his radio operator Kat at headquarters and sends photos of the writings to be translated. Unable to properly search the rest of the compound due to the storm, he investigates video recordings and discovers that the drill site was established by Borman to investigate a newly-detected air pocket nine miles below the surface. The scientists then began to exhibit signs of paranoia, causing Jack to also feel paranoid and experience a vivid hallucination while trying to sleep in his vehicle.\nBy morning, the storm has cleared and Jack searches the facility in earnest, meeting Dr. Jenny \"JC\" Christensen, seemingly the sole remaining member of the science team. She explains that Borman was murdered by the chief geologist and his body was stored in the refrigeration unit along with Dr. Varga who died of a heart attack. Jack calls in the deaths to GNE, but the police are tied up searching for the other missing scientists, and his boss Chief Caswell orders him to stay put in case anyone returns. JC, meanwhile, is anxious to leave, and Jack becomes suspicious, having not seen her in video or photos of the team. While he recovers from hitting his head on a crane hook, she attempts to steal his vehicle but he has hidden the keys on his person. A call from Kat then reveals that one of the doctors, Ivanoff, was found alive and that JC did not appear on the crew roster, although JC herself explains this with evidence that due to budget constraints not allowing segregated quarters, Borman falsified her name and gender.\nJC recounts that, six days prior, the drill had broken through to the cavity and audio sensors on the drill picked up chilling audio of what sounded like human screams. Fearing they had broken through to Hell itself, the crew then began to hallucinate seeing dead loved ones, resulting in panic and even violent behavior. At this point, Jack has also begun to see things and act nervous. The two begin to develop a strong attraction to each other while watching the sunset over the desert and they share dinner to celebrate Jack's birthday.

To comfort him, Jack and JC sleep together, but his hallucinations worsen due to his resurfaced trauma.\nIn his nightmares, Jack begins to suspect that JC is not human and fears for his life and sanity. Arming himself, he discovers human remains in the site's cesspit and, in a panic, attacks JC in the shower. She tries to subdue him but Jack locks himself in Borman's office and finds a hidden recording of the Professor feverishly explaining that the Devil itself had been released, further convincing Jack that JC is dangerous. Finding her in the kitchen carving meat, her persona has become that of the Devil and convinces him to sell his soul. In reality, she is merely playing along with his delusions in a ploy to get his car keys so she can drive them to get help. Jack finds himself reliving the day of the murder-suicide and wounds JC with a screwdriver before setting the facility on fire. Just then a GNE rescue team arrives and subdues Jack, evacuating them both to a hospital via helicopter before the facility explodes.\nJack's superiors Caswell and Inspector Khaled later back up JC's story and presence on the expedition, explaining that the rescued Ivanoff had a sample of a kind of toxic gas released from the underground cavity by the drill. Inhalation of the gas caused the afflicted to lose the ability to differentiate between reality, memory, and imagination, causing irrational behavior in the scientists as well as Jack. JC, meanwhile, was less affected because her quarters were separate from the main compound. The remaining scientists are still missing and presumed dead, having scattered into the desert. Despite these revelations, Jack's paranoia about JC being the Devil quickly resurfaces, and he steals a handgun and tries to kill her before being stopped by his coworker Alex.

Toby is kidnapped by an unknown perpetrator leading to the involvement of the local police and eventually the FBI. The FBI begins inquiring in Jack's past only to find out he has no official records dating back farther than ten years, and there is no evidence showing how his first wife had died or where she was buried.\nA local petty criminal and repeated sex offender is initially thought to be the culprit, but it is revealed that the dangerous cult-like religious movement Santa Muerte, popular within Mexican criminal circles, might be involved. Jack's former life as a Santa Muerte worshiping hit man for the Mexican Mafia is revealed as he tries desperately to find out who kidnapped his daughter.  We later learn that Jack was really named Roberto.  Though born in Oklahoma, his drug addicted mother took him to Mexico when she was young.  She later died, and Roberto had to make a life for himself on the streets.  He ultimately became an enforcer for the Mexican Mafia.  He married a woman named Katie, and they had a child, Toby.  Jack escapes from the FBI in Texas and makes his way across the border to Acuna.  There he is accused of murdering a prostitute who was trying to help him find Toby.  Though he did not do it, the Mexican police arrest him.  Jack is later able to escape from the Mexican jail in disguise.  Still in Acuna, he makes his presence known.  As he planned, he lured the assassin who was looking for him to come to his hotel.  They fight and Jack beats the assassin, who he then tortures for information about Toby's whereabouts.  The assassin tells Jack that Toby was kidnapped by Katie, Jack's/Roberto's ex-wife.  Jack breaks into the brothel that Katie now runs in Acuna and confronts Katie, who is herself furious that Jack/Roberto ran out on her without warning and took Toby with him.  Jack thinks Katie is lying when she says she does not know where Toby is, and murders her.\nIn the film's denouement, we realize that the real kidnapper was Jack's new wife, Amaya, with the help of her cousin, the sheriff in Del Rio (who throughout the film appeared as if he was trying to help Jack and that he believed Jack's innocence).  We learn that the flashback we have seen throughout the film\u2014of Jack/Roberto strangling a man at Katie's behest as she looks on in delight\u2014has new meaning.  The man Roberto strangled was Amaya's father.  Worse still, Amaya was in the room with Roberto and Katie when they strangled her father, hiding under the bed.  Amaya's father was a degenerate gambler who owed a large debt to Katie and the Mexican Mob, and when he could not pay, Katie had Roberto kill him.  Amaya witnessed all of this.  We realize that she then set in motion an elaborate plan to emigrate to the United States and marry Jack/Roberto in order to punish him for murdering her father.  It was Amaya and the sheriff who kidnapped Toby.  Amaya and the sheriff set fire to the room where Jack is (the same room where he killed Amaya's father many years ago).  But Jack is able to see that Toby is tied up on the bed in the room.  He manages to free her and they escape the fire unhurt.\nThe viewer thinks this is the end of the movie and that it has a happy ending.  But we then learn, in a final twist, the truth.  Amaya did not really kidnap Toby.  When Amaya explained to Toby who her father really was, Amaya was able to enlist Toby (using the magic of Santa Muerte) to help exact an even worse revenge on Jack/Roberto.  Amaya tells Toby that her father will kill her mother (which in fact happened earlier when Jack was duped by the assassin he tortured into killing Katie to find Toby).  Amaya told Toby that Santa Muerte magic would give her the strength to carry out a terrible revenge on her father for that murder.  So Amaya purposefully let Jack and Toby escape.  Her plan was for them to live happily for many years and then for Toby to kill her father.  In the final scene, we see Jack and Toby fleeing deeper into Mexico on an old bus.

Eno further tells the crew that as he was being stabbed, Matsuki told him \"it is your turn,\" which Eno takes as an imperative to perform a \"ceremony\" mandated by God, which he believes was the motive behind the mass stabbing. Seeing that Eno is financially troubled, the crew agree to let him live in their offices and pay him on the condition that they are allowed to film the occurrences.\nShiraishi's crew come to be repulsed by Eno, especially since they think that he will follow Matsuki's path of mass murder. From Matsuki's father, the crew learns that Eno's symbol resembles the birthmark possessed by Matsuki since childhood. Their search brings them to Kutoro Rock (\u4e5d\u982d\u5442\u5ca9, literally \"Nine-Headed Spine Rock\"), a formation at the peak of Mount Ohiruyama, where Shiraishi had a bizarre experience the same day as the mass stabbing, in which he found nine leeches biting his left leg. At Kutoro, the crew find a stone with Matsuki and Eno's petrogylph symbols inscribed on it. According to horror film director Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Kutoro Rock was dedicated to Hiruko, a Japanese god with the form of leech. Meanwhile, the film Eno shoots following his daily routine reveals the \"UFOs\" are, in fact, leech-like apparitions that appear in the skies above Tokyo.\nShiraishi takes Eno to a Korean barbecue restaurant to get him to talk openly about what the voices tell him to do. Drunk and relaxed, Eno reveals that he has been saving \u00a5700,000 to build a bomb so he can commit a suicide bombing in a busy street in Shibuya, which he claims will send him and his victims to Hiruko's realm, a place he likens to paradise. Shiraishi resolves to stop Eno, but on the way home, he sees Eno's head surrounded by the leech-like apparitions and finds his leg bleeding as it did when the leaches bit it. Shiraishi reluctantly agrees to cooperate, intending to record Eno's plot for posterity. After spending a day with Eno prior to the bombing, Eno offers him a \u00a5100 coin to repay one he borrowed near the beginning of their relationship. Shiraishi instead asks him to keep it and return it and the camera from the realm he expects to go to as proof his plan succeeded. The blast ends up claiming 108 lives, including Shinobu Kuribayashi, a member of Shiraishi's film crew. Eno's body, like Matsuki, is never found. Shiraishi, meanwhile, is sentenced to prison for complicity.\n21 years later, Shiraishi is released from prison and reunites with his producer. They return to the Korean barbecue, where Eno's camera and the \u00a5100 coin fall from the ceiling.

He sees she is alive and resuscitates her. She calls herself Ondine and refuses to be taken to the hospital, not wanting to be seen by anyone else. He shelters her in a caravan house that belonged to his late mother in a quiet harbor, which makes him late for picking up his daughter Annie who uses a wheelchair and lives with his ex-wife Maura. During Annie's dialysis, he tells her a story about a fisherman that catches a woman out of the sea. Annie explains the woman could be a magical selkie.\nAnnie receives a new powerchair from the CRC, and upon returning home is greeted by Maura's boyfriend Alex. Maura flips off Syracuse for missing the doctor who had news on a kidney match for Annie.\nNext morning, Syracuse finds Ondine washing clothes in a stream, singing in an unknown language. She follows him on his boat to work that day. He pulls up only empty lobster pots until Ondine starts singing, after which every pot contains a catch. Still not wanting to be seen, Ondine refuses to follow Syracuse to the fish market where the lobsters are sold. He buys a dress and lies to the store clerk that it's for Annie when she grows up.\nWhen Syracuse picks up Annie from her school, he continues the fisherman story by explaining how the woman sings to the fish for him to catch, a song in a language he has never heard before. Annie states that Selk is the language of the selkie. Syracuse stammers that his lobsters hear her sing, which makes Annie curious as to whose story this is, and she secretly follows him to the caravan. When Syracuse asks how long she will stay, Ondine says it is up to him. He happily replies forever and happily ever after, like the fairytale he has been building with Annie, who watches them without being noticed.\nAnnie is seen back home studying all her new library books on seals and selkies. Alex says selkies are Scottish creatures, but the one Annie saw is not.\nSyracuse regularly torments the local priest in confession because there aren't any AA meetings in town. He recalls a recurring nightmare where he is at Alex's funeral and reunited with Maura, still with her drinking problem. As the priest pushes the subject away, Syracuse reveals he pulled a woman out of the water with his net and kept her, reminding the priest he can't tell anyone.\nOndine is shown alone, tidying up the caravan, then tries her new clothing as if the experience was a first, especially when she stretches leggings over one splayed hand so it looks webbed.\nThe next day, Annie sees Ondine swimming and approaches her on the dock. They bond as Annie tells her about selkies and ostensibly Ondine herself, which Ondine goes along with, kissing Annie goodbye before the child goes back to her mother. Syracuse goes in the library asking for books about selkies, but discovers that Annie took them all. Annie runs into some neighbourhood kids showing off their bicycles and lets one of the kids play with her powerchair before it shorts out driving into water. The kids call Annie a \"spaz\" and abandon her to push it back home, where she finds Alex drinking beer. As Alex dries out the batteries, Annie asks again about selkies and he tells her they come from his homeland, Outer Hebrides. However, Ondine doesn't speak like him.\nSyracuse brings Ondine fishing again to steer the tiller, until a Fisheries board patrol boat zooms by, causing Ondine to hide. She begins singing again as he is pulling up his net, and finds it filled with a bountiful catch of salmon, that doesn't come from trawling. Ondine hides as the patrol boat returns to inspect for prohibited gillnetting; the guards find dry gillnets and Ondine hidden in them. Glad that Ondine isn't invisible and that the guards accepted her story about how the fish were caught, he goes into harbor to sell their catch, where everyone stares at Ondine, including a dark-haired man who is looking for her. Syracuse takes her shopping for clothes and run into Annie, who helps her with outfits, as townfolk gawk through the store window eyeing a very pretty Ondine.\nLater Syracuse wants to pick up Annie for local regatta festivities but Maura says she already left. Ondine gets another surprise visit from Annie, and sees the caravan has been cleaned. Learning that Annie can't swim, they both play in the shallow water, where Ondine finds something that Annie thinks is her seal coat, and they bury it in the greenhouse. Annie wants Ondine to stay for seven years, unless the selkie husband claims her back, and shares this with her dad as they all boat into town. Ondine warns Annie that she isn't selk and can't grant wishes. Upset, Annie pretends to have brake failure to throw herself off the pier, to test Ondine's ability to breathe underwater, and Ondine jumps in to her rescue. They bring Annie back to Maura and Alex, who share with Annie that a man was asking for Ondine. This gives Annie a nightmare about the selkie husband coming. Back in the caravan, Syracuse explains he's called Circus the Clown because he was an alcoholic like Maura. He stopped drinking for Annie, yet custody went to her mother.\nBack in the confessional, Syracuse tells the priest he sinned with Ondine the night before, and fears the good luck she brings, since he lost hope long ago. As he leaves, the unknown man approaches him about Ondine and Syracuse ignores him. He brings Annie home from dialysis but she is locked out since Maura and Alex are drinking in a pub. Annie asks to be left with them. Syracuse returns to find the caravan has been ransacked, and Ondine hiding nearby. He wants Ondine to stay and asks her to wish the man away, but her only wish is for Annie not to be sick. Ondine's man is searching town, driving with rage, causing an accident with Maura who was drunk driving. Alex is killed, thrown through the windshield. Ondine and Syracuse follow Annie to the hospital, and learn she is getting an immediate kidney transplant from Alex, who opted to be a donor. The man is also brought to the hospital, and asks Ondine why she speaks their language as they both don't belong here.\nSyracuse and Maura both get drunk after Alex's wake. Maura wants him to get rid of Ondine, now hiding in his boat, because of bad luck. Intoxicated, Syracuse maroons Ondine at Roancarrig Lighthouse island because he thinks she will haunt him forever, as humans and selkies don't belong together. Dusk comes and some driftwood gives Ondine's basking silhouette the appearance of a seal's tail; she jumps into the sea towards the seals on Seal Rock. The priest wakes up a depressed Syracuse, and he brings Annie from hospital to his home. She comforts him saying Ondine will be back because she left something behind. As Annie watches TV with Sigur R\u00f3s performing, Syracuse recognizes they are the songs of Ondine, and goes back to find her on Seal Rock to demand the truth. Ondine first says she is a sea creature that found her seal coat and buried it so she can stay with a family she loves. She then explains that she is a drug mule from Romania, and her pushta Vladic was evading the Coast Guards, when she swam away with a backpack of heroin since Vladic can't swim. She floated in the sea until Syracuse saved her.\nSyracuse brings Ondine back to Annie where they are ambushed by Vladic and another gunman, that Annie thinks want the seal coat. Everyone goes to the greenhouse to dig it up, but find nothing because Annie moved it. Ondine promises to stay with Annie, who reveals the bundle was moved to a lobster pot. As they pull up the pot, Annie reminds Ondine that she is a selkie yet Vladic isn't, and Ondine trips Vladic overboard by pulling on the rope he is standing on. He drowns going after the falling lobster pot pushed back in by Annie.

He tells Benny to take 3 men to the site of the rocket launch and launch the missile. He takes the rest of his men to destroy Dhuruvan and the girls, which turns into a war. \nOn the other side, Ganapathiram finds the complaint letter, gathers his team and goes to the forest checkpoint to find out what happens. The storekeeper tells him what happened and that condoms were purchased. Assuming Dhuruvan kidnapped the girls, Ganapathiram and his officers destroy Dhuruvan's community and their homes, and exile them from the area while degrading their lower caste status. He eventually finds Ajitha's corpse in the quicksand of the river and assumes that Dhuruvan raped and killed her. Ganapathiram frames Dhuruvan as a serial killer to the district collector. The collector issues a shoot-at-sight order for Dhuruvan, with Ganapathiram's permission.\nDhuruvan and the girls kills 3 of the mercenaries who were with Anderson. Benny tells Collin, one of the 3 men who came with him to stay and guard the box, where the missile is. While they goes to help Anderson in the war. After finding their secret signal, Anderson kills Susheela and hangs her from a tree. The girls and Dhuruvan gets heartbroken at the sight of a dead Susheela and buries her with an NCC tribute. The girls kills Thompson and the two other men except Anderson, Benny and Collin. Benny finds Dhuruvan and the girls. He trashes Benny and makes him to lure Anderson after which Dhuruvan kills Benny with the girl's help. He goes in search of Anderson, while the girls go to stop the missile launch. While Dhuruvan goes to find Anderson, Ganapathiram catches Dhuruvan and tries to shoot him. Dhuruvan tries to reveal the situation but fails. Ganapathiram tries to call his men through his walkie-talkie to kill Dhuruvan as he was running out of bullets. Dhuruvan throws the walkie-talkie, beats Ganapathiram and escapes. When Ganapathiram goes to take the walkie-talkie, he realizes the situation when he sees the corpses of the mercenaries and realizes that Dhuruvan killed them. Ganapathiram reveals the situation to the collector and arrogantly tells the collector: \"My team is enough. I will put over their dead bodies in front of you\".\nAt the climax, Dhuruvan and Anderson fights face-to-face where Dhuruvan confronts and defeats Anderson, and the girls kills Collin and tries to disarm the counter missile from firing the space rocket. After an intense fight between the men, Dhuruvan manages to kill Anderson. Dhuruvan finally reaches the site of the rocket launch and helps the girls. He increases the time set of the missile by 25 seconds and changes it direction to the left. The Indian space rocket launches from the station and speeds up into the atmosphere. After 25 seconds, the counter missile diverted from its direction explodes into the desolate forest. The troop prides themselves for being successful on their mission, but feel bad for Dhuruvan as his bravery will never be recognized due to his caste. In the end, Ganapathiram is awarded by the Indian government for \"bravery\", while Dhuruvan is back at the camp training another set of new NCC cadets.

Michael is uninterested, and leaves the building in pursuit of a loan to pay off his debt.\nMichael heads to Delgado's Pool Hall, a nearby snooker bar, in search of a man known as The Mutt (Liam Cunningham), who provides loans. There, Michael's friend Clifford (Domhnall Gleeson) explains that The Mutt was recently thrown out of the bar after assaulting a man who insulted his snooker skills. Leaving the bar, Michael clashes with two clampers (Ned Dennehy and Glenn Speers), who vow to find him and clamp his car later. Michael goes home to find his father, Jim McCrea (Jim Broadbent), waiting outside. Their relationship is not good, and Michael is reluctant to talk. However, Jim reveals that he is dying of cancer and wishes to reconcile. The two go to a pub to drink, but while there, Michael learns of The Mutt's location in another pub. He abandons his father, promising to talk later.\nAt the next pub, Michael runs into Shamie, who is making out with a girl. Michael is angry and tells Shamie he needs to show Brenda some respect and end their relationship if he wants to pursue other girls. Michael then finds The Mutt, who is drinking with his associate Dinny (Breffni McKenna). He asks The Mutt for a loan, but is refused. Giving up, Michael begins to drink at the bar only to be assaulted by an angry Shamie. Michael overpowers Shamie and demands he break up with Brenda. Storming off, he is stopped by The Mutt, who asks if Michael will join him and Dinny in a burglary. The money earned will pay off Michael's debt, but he won't get it until morning. Michael agrees, and the three head out.\nThe burglary goes off without a hitch, and The Mutt finds pictures that prove the home owner is cheating on his wife. The trio plan to blackmail him out of \u20ac30,000. Michael is dropped off and is assured he will get his \u20ac10,000 in the morning. Back at his car, he finds his car clamped. Ivan and Orlando then return and drive their truck full speed into the clamped car. Michael flees the scene and loses them, then returns to his home in search of the pistol he keeps under his bed. However, Brenda has stolen the gun and is contemplating suicide after being dumped by Shamie. She locks Michael out of her apartment just as Ivan and Orlando enter, having predicted that he would come home. They begin to beat Michael with a bat and prepare to break his leg. Before they can do so, Orlando is shot dead by Brenda. Ivan runs away to tell Perrier. While comforting Brenda, Jim enters and, noticing the body, tells them they need to properly dispose of Orlando. The three get into Brenda's car and go to an escarpment, where they bury Orlando. Jim comments that the locale is beautiful and refers to its history, commenting that men who lived and died by the sword were buried here. Brenda's car becomes flooded and they cannot get away, so Michael and Brenda spend the night in her car, while Jim stands outside, spending the whole night awake, watching Dublin.\nAt Perrier's hideout, he discusses Orlando's death with four other members of his crew.

Jim then admits that he does not have cancer, but instead believes he was visited by the Grim Reaper. During his visit, the Reaper informed Jim that the next time he sleeps, he will die. Upset that his father played on his sympathies, Michael wakes Brenda and tells her that her car has to be burned. Once it is aflame, the trio head back into the city. They are caught in a rain storm and take shelter at a farm, but the farm owner (Jane Brennan) calls the police and claims the trio raped her. Having fled down the road, they take cover upon seeing a Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na patrol car. Once it has passed, they cut through a forest. Brenda vows to make her relationship with Shamie work, and an angry Michael berates her for blindly loving Shamie despite his lack of faithfulness and love for her. While Jim takes him aside, Brenda storms off and, once they notice she is gone, Michael and Jim follow. They catch up with her as she is being arrested by two police officers. While sneaking up on them, Jim snatches Michael's gun and confronts the officers. The trio steal the police car and Michael receives a call from The Mutt, who gives them his location in order for Michael to pick up his share of the blackmail earnings.\nWith plans to meet The Mutt behind a factory at one in the afternoon, Brenda demands that, in the meantime, she be dropped off at Shamie's so she can try to restore their relationship. Along the way, the trio encounter a young man (Chris Newman) and two of his mates joyriding in a stolen car. Jim and the man talk and the two trios swap cars. In their new stolen car, they arrive at Shamie's; however, Brenda arrives just as a nearly naked woman strolls out and a nearly naked Shamie runs after her. The two start to get intimate in the hallway just as Shamie notices Brenda, but Brenda runs away. Outside the building, Brenda bypasses the car and runs down a nearby street, prompting Michael to chase after her and comfort her. Jim, left behind, approaches Jerome (Brendan Coyle) and Russ (Conleth Hill), two members of the Savage Canine Vernacular, who are training their Rottweilers to attack. Jim helps them, and then picks up Michael and Brenda.\nThey trio arrive at the warehouse and Michael heads in alone to get his share. He meets with The Mutt and Dinny, but the two plan on betraying him. The Mutt knocks Michael out with a wrench and he and Dinny carry the unconscious Michael to The Mutt's car. As they are putting him in the boot, Jim approaches, armed with a pistol. He knocks both Dinny and The Mutt out while Brenda steals the entire \u20ac30,000. With Michael back in the car, the trio head out.\nHiding out in another industrial area, Jim reveals the reason why Michael became estranged from his parents. After witnessing a local thug, Steve Lynch, beating up a woman, Michael intervened and beat up Lynch. Lynch returned to Michael's house later, where only his mother, Elaine, was home. Lynch proceeded to assault Elaine, leaving her badly injured. Believing his parents blamed him for the attack, Michael broke off contact with them. Elaine and Jim would later split up, with Elaine moving to County Clare. Jim then asks Michael if he can have some cocaine, and Michael agrees, taking him to Delgado's Pool Hall in order to buy off of Clifford. However, during the sale, Clifford signals Mulligan, played by the Irish novelist (Patrick McCabe), who calls Perrier. While Jim is snorting coke in the bathroom and Michael and Brenda are talking, Perrier and his goons enter. Michael accidentally fires off his pistol, causing everyone to take cover. Other gang members, primarily Ivan, begin shooting but Brenda, angry at Clifford, beats him over the head and she and Michael use him as a human shield to escape. Clifford is killed in the process, and Jim is left behind. Upon exiting Delgado's, the pair find that their stolen car has been clamped, and are forced to flee on foot. Thankfully, Shamie is able to find them in his car, announcing that he has been looking for Brenda. Michael and Brenda jump into his car.\nOutside Delgado's, Perrier and his crew join with The Mutt and Dinny. Jerome and Russ approach, but their dogs growl and Perrier coldly shoots them. Jim walks out of the hall just as the gangs are leaving, but The Mutt notices him and he is taken hostage. Meanwhile, Shamie has tried to reconcile with Brenda, but she refuses him and her and Michael take his car at gunpoint. They take refuge in a hotel. They receive a call from a badly beaten Jim who explains to Michael that he is going to \"take a nap\" after the phone call - implying, true to his vision, that he will die. Despite this, Michael arms himself and prepares to go to Perrier's hideout. Brenda tries to warn him against it, but the two share a passionate kiss and Michael heads out in Shamie's car.\nMichael arrives at Perrier's hideout, with the \u20ac30,000 and a pistol hidden in the crotch of his pants. He is informed that his father is going to die that night, though it will be quick. Michael's death, however, will be slow. He is pinned down on the table while Ivan attempts to castrate him. Before it can be done, however, The Mutt asks for his money so he can leave. Perrier pockets the money, just as Hank (Francis Magee) shoots and kills Dinny. In the confusion, Michael is able to escape, and Perrier kills The Mutt. Two of Perrier's cronies pursue Michael, who has acquired a golf club. He uses it first to knock out Blaise (Wuzza Conlon) and then Victor (Brendan Dempsey). Michael, now armed with a pistol, returns and confronts Perrier, Ivan, Hank, and Kenny (Brian Doherty). Lining them up against a wall, Michael takes their guns and his money. Kenny calls his bluff, and is shot in the leg. Michael then pushes his father out of the building and loads him into Shamie's car. At the same time, Perrier reveals that he has an AK-74u hidden under the snooker table. With that in hand, he, Ivan, and Hank head outside to confront Michael, who is attempting to flee. Perrier fires into the car as Michael reverses, and Jim is hit in the chest. They comment on how the Reaper came after all, and Jim calls him a cunt. An enraged Michael charges out of the car at Perrier, firing his gun, wounding Ivan and Hank in the process. Perrier shoots at Michael, severely wounding him. Before Perrier can finish him, multiple vans pull up, brought to the location by Brenda, containing members of the Savage Canine Vernacular. They set their dogs upon Perrier, who is mauled to death. Brenda, Jerome, and Russ inform a semi-conscious Michael that they're taking him to Derek Dawson, the best veterinarian in the business.\nThe next morning, Michael, having had his wounds treated, and Brenda are at the funeral for Jim, who is buried alongside Russ and Jerome's dogs Achilles and Apollo at the same place that the trio had buried Orlando earlier. A heartfelt eulogy is given, and Michael and Brenda profess their love for each other. The pair then head to County Clare, where Michael intends to reconcile with his mother.

Shortly afterwards, Chris's adoptive parents are murdered by hired assassins of the Singh Brotherhood, the long-time enemies of the Phantom for over five centuries. He is sought out by Bpaa Thap (Jungle Patrol), the group founded by the 1st Phantom which has evolved into an International Covert intelligence and law enforcement agency headquartered in the jungles of Bangalla (the fictional small island nation in the Indonesian archipelago). The Bpaa Thap team consists of a bunch of scientists, various paramilitary specialists, Director of Field Operations and close ally of the Walkers Abel Vandermaark, and Guran, a native Bangalla woman who quickly befriends Kit. Now going by his birth name of Kit Walker, he begins training to become an expert in martial arts and combat, to emerges as the 22nd Phantom to battle evil.\nHe quickly encounters the Singh Brotherhood, now led by the murderous and arrogant Rhatib Singh. Wearing an updated Phantom uniform that gives him added strength and speed, Kit's first mission is to stop Singh and figure out the Singh Brotherhood's plans for a new technology they have developed named \"Flicker\" (which enables them to brainwash people through specially planted cable TV set-top boxes to complete specific tasks). However, the task is not so easy as there is a mole in the Phantom team, and the Singh Brotherhood attempts to assassinate the police detective father of Kit's new love, Renny. Kit eventually finds and eliminates the facility which handles the broadcasts, but not before the Brotherhood transmits the necessary commands to the people needed to make their master plan a success. Kit races against time to stop brainwashed people (including a press photographer, a Secret Service agent and an EMT) from assassinating a diplomat who has an uncanny ability to bring nations to peace, and the only man who can do so to the Middle East and whose death would spark wars (and thereby increase the Brotherhood's revenue).\nKit manages to save the diplomat as the Phantom, and in the wake of this, Rhatib Singh orders the mole in the Phantom team (who has been holding Renny and her father at gunpoint to force the Phantom to allow the diplomat to be murdered) to kill them, but the team manages to subdue the mole. Immediately after the failure is revealed, Singh is executed by the other board members of the Brotherhood for incompetence. Finally, Kit confronts Vandermaark, who it turns out is a morally questionable man with a streak of cruelty and who deliberately tipped the Brotherhood off to Kit's foster parents' location in order to entice Kit to become the Phantom. Vandermaark attempts to convince Kit to put the past behind him, but Kit begins to walk away from him, thereby banishing him from the Phantom team.

She proceeds to argue that this cultural heritage is under-threat from large-scale corporations that, driven by profit maximization, have replaced traditional farming with a system that treats animals as a mere raw material or input in an industrial system.\nWorcester narrates the history and development of these large-scale corporations through the anti-competitive practices of vertical and horizontal integration. Through interviews with affected parties, as well as footage of campaign rallies and undercover expos\u00e9s within factory farms, the film suggests that powerful corporations may take advantage of a monopoly position by acting in an unethical manner. It states that because the external costs of intensive animal farming are not taken into consideration by consumers, the industry constitutes an example of market failure.\nOf particular focus is the expansion of food giant Smithfield Foods within Poland, a location selected for its low costs and strategic access to the European Union market, following Smithfield's acquisition of the former state-owned meat producer Animex Foods in 1999. Drawing on testimony from Polish academics, politicians, industry leaders, farmers and villagers, the film argues that poor corporate regulation has resulted in a number of human and environmental disasters within Poland. Specifically, Animex is accused of causing harm to human health through the over-application of pig slurry as an agricultural fertilizer, as well as of antibiotic misuse within factory farms. Worcester further suggests that Smithfield has influenced government legislation through the sponsoring of sympathetic politicians with financial grants.\nSpeaking in 2006, then CEO of Animex Foods Morten Jensen states that Animex is compliant with all Polish and European environmental legislation. In an interview given in 2008, Smithfield's Vice-President of environmental and corporate affairs Dennis H Treacy states that contamination caused by slurry is illegal and that the organisation goes to \"extra-ordinary lengths to ensure that they have a system in place that doesn't allow that\". Responding to the issue of corporate donations, Treacy argues that such contributions are \"the way of life in American government \u2013 part of the American system\". Guardian columnist Warwick Smith argues that such donations corrupt democracy.In closing, the documentary proposes a number of solutions to the issues it highlights. It advocates buying British meat to ensure that products are not imported from jurisdictions with less stringent animal rights legislation, particularly in relation to the use of sow stalls and tail docking. It further promotes the adoption of clearer labeling systems on food, and recommends buying meat certified high-welfare, outdoor-bred, free range or organic.", "tmdb_id": 273606}, "60182943": {"title": "Pinju Manasu", "plot": "Thulasi (Saravanan), an orphan, works as a peon in an engineering college.

Meanwhile, Inspector Clouseau is reassigned from his task as a parking officer by Chief Inspector Dreyfus to join the detectives in Japan, site of the Tornado's latest heist. After Clouseau immediately crosses the \"borders\" of France at an airport gate, news instantly breaks that the Pink Panther diamond has been stolen, prompting Clouseau to gloat that his presence has kept the diamond safe and that he had known it would happen all along. Clouseau meets the other members of the Dream Team: Detective Randall Pepperidge from Great Britain; Vincenzo Brancaleoni from Italy; Kenji Mazuto, an electronics specialist from Japan; and Sonia Solandres, a researcher and criminology expert from India. \nThe team then goes to Rome to investigate a black market fence, Alonso Avellaneda. Assuming Avellaneda is the Tornado, the Dream Team question him while Clouseau snoops around. Avellaneda demonstrates that he lacks a characteristic bullet wound the Tornado received years ago; after the detectives leave, Avellaneda then meets with the real Tornado. That night, Clouseau and his partner Ponton spy on Avellaneda at a restaurant using an audio bug. The mission is compromised when they find Vincenzo and Nicole, Clouseau's girlfriend, together at the restaurant. Banned from the restaurant for burning it down months earlier, Clouseau disguises himself as a dancer and switches the bug to Nicole's table, burning down the restaurant again in the process. Meanwhile, the Tornado steals the Pope's ring, souring public opinion against the Dream Team. When Clouseau's incompetence aggravates the situation, he is voted off the team. Clouseau is later called to an office and finds that the Tornado has apparently killed himself, leaving a suicide note claiming he destroyed the Pink Panther \u2013 considering it so beautiful that he could not allow anyone else to own it \u2013 and left the other treasures to be recovered. Examining a key found in the Pope's Chambers, the Dream Team match the dead man's DNA with DNA recovered from when the Tornado was shot, and believe they have solved the case, but Clouseau remains unconvinced.\nA celebration is thrown in the Dream Team's honor, although Clouseau is uninvited. While wandering near the celebration, he realizes something after seeing the license plate of Sonia's car and calls Ponton. Clouseau tries to tell Dreyfus that the real thief is still at large, but is ignored. Dreyfus announces to the group that Clouseau believes Sonia was the thief, and the detectives jokingly work out a plausible explanation: as the Tornado's ex-lover, she would have in-depth knowledge of his methods, and could have drawn attention to the thefts of the other artifacts, leaving her free to sell the Pink Panther. Nicole, realizing Clouseau could be correct, asks Sonia to empty her purse. After initially trying to leave, Sonia ultimately pulls out a gun, threatening to shoot Nicole, before shooting Clouseau, but the bullet ricochets off his L\u00e9gion d'honneur medal. A chase ensues, with the Dream Team suffering due to various accidents caused by Clouseau's clumsiness. Finally cornered, Sonia threatens to destroy the Pink Panther and, goaded by Clouseau, she does. Before she can escape however, Sonia is knocked out by Ponton and arrested. Clouseau reveals that Sonia destroyed a fake gem, as Clouseau kept the real diamond in his possession in order to protect it, while the Pink Panther at the museum was swapped with a replica he was given before leaving France. Furthermore, The Tornado, an expert on gems, would have recognized the fake Pink Panther, allowing Clouseau to deduce that his suicide note was forged and that he was murdered. Clouseau then reveals that he had given a ticket to Sonia's car two days before the Pink Panther was stolen \u2013 contradicting her alibi of being delayed to the original crime scene by her flight \u2013 which confirmed to him that Sonia was the culprit and that she used the Dream Team, and by extension Clouseau's mishaps, as a strategic cover.

His access is blocked, its data classified by the administration, following the gag order of the whole department. He continues regardless as he becomes more suspicious when the sun unexpectedly sets at Eagle Peak.\nJames' son, Shane, meets Zoe and Kevin at the park, where the latter challenges Shane in drag racing to settle a dispute over who repays the damage to a telescope they broke during a fight earlier that night. As they prepare for a drag race, an electromagnetic interference suddenly occurs, followed by an earthquake that swallows Kevin and his car. Shane and Zoe make a run from the park. At the same time, James explains in an interview with Vanetti about the misalignment of the Earth's axis due to a sudden axis tilt following the cataclysmic events in Alaska. James' findings have received enormous attention. As a result of violating the gag order and U.S. government-imposed censorship, he was being called by his father, General Mayfield, to report to the Gilboy Air Base.

While on the road, members of the U.S. Army force Cynthia and Shane to turn back and take shelter in a parish.\nReturning to Lindenville, they find their road blocked. An EMP shock wave and an earthquake force Shane and Cynthia to run on foot, narrowly surviving the tremor after the crevice nearly swallows Cynthia before making their way to the Lindenville Parish. She tries to persuade the people inside and the General in charge to evacuate, but they refuse. Only Michael and Zoe leave the Lindenville Parish with Cynthia and Shane before the electromagnetic shockwave fries everyone inside.\nWhile heading for Little Brook, Michael dies of a heart attack after the EMP wave disabled his pacemaker and after a looter's death by electrocution by the shockwave as he tried to steal Michael's SUV. Despite the vehicle being fried, Shane turns it back on by using the EMP wave to ignite the spark plugs and start the engine. At the same time, James and General Mayfield, along with the Russian Navy Captain Yulenkov and his submarine crew, dive and head towards the Mariana Trench in a plan to bring the planet back into regular axis tilt by dropping two nuclear warheads into the bottom of the trench, however, they are aware that the diesel-powered submarine; the one necessary for the operation as it remains functional even with the EMP shockwave, might not outrun the nuclear blast on time given its slow speed, making it a suicide mission.\nAfter dropping the warheads and the crew preparing for the inevitable death, James points out and uses the underwater volcanic geyser for the submarine to propel themselves back up to the surface right as the warheads detonate. The combined efforts between Russia and the United States ultimately became a success, nearly risking the lives of the crew but saving the Earth.\nThe film ends with James Mayfield returning home in Lindenville, and introducing Shane to his grandfather.", "tmdb_id": 27391}, "46961177": {"title": "Polish-Russian War (film)", "plot": "The film's events take place over several days and they are set in the present time in a large Polish city.

There, they solve the fourth and final puzzle that directs them to the final room of the contest, but Layton leaves Luke, Janice and two other contestants (Brock and child prodigy Amelia Ruth) to enter it while he explores the rest of the castle.\nBack in London, Emmy Altava, Professor Layton's assistant, is meeting with Dr. Andrew Schrader when she hears about the events on the Crown Petone. She flies out to the remains of the ship, where she picks up Inspector Grosky and flies to the island.\nLayton finds a room filled with Melina Whistler's belongings, along with a piece of sheet music titled \"A Song of the Sea\". He meets Melina herself and witnesses her having an argument with herself. Luke, Janice, Brock and Amelia enter the final room of the contest, only to be trapped behind bars. The mystery man reveals himself as Jean Descole, Layton and Luke's old nemesis, who orders Amelia to be brought to him. Luke, Janice and Brock are taken by Descole's men, but they are saved by Emmy and Grosky. Layton and Melina meet up with them, and Emmy recognizes \"Melina\" as Nina, one of the girls who went missing.\nAmelia is brought to Oswald Whistler, believed to have been eliminated by a previous puzzle, and declares her the winner of the contest, but soon forces her into a machine connected to the Detragon and confesses that there is no Elixir of Life. Layton and company manage to save her, and Layton explains the truth: the Detragon is actually a machine that can copy a person's personality and download their memories into another person's brain. Whistler had conspired with Descole to abduct girls from London and use the Detragon to implant them with his dead daughter's memories as a means of keeping her alive indefinitely. This is the fate that befell Nina, and it is the fate that Whistler had planned for Amelia. Layton reveals that Janice also was a victim of Whistler's experiments, and that, unbeknownst to Whistler, he had actually succeeded in transferring Melina's memories into Janice's body. It was Melina who sought Layton's help in stopping her father from hurting anyone else.\nWith Melina's cover blown, Descole captures her and reveals his true plan: to use the Detragon in concert with Melina's singing to raise Ambrosia by playing a pair of melodies found in the island's stone seal - the Song of the Stars and the Song of the Sea. After Descole's attempts fail, he flies into a rage: the Detragon destroys the castle and becomes the controls of a gigantic excavation robot, the Detragiganto, which Descole commands and begins rampaging across the island in a desperate attempt to uncover Ambrosia by force. Layton and company escape the castle, and Layton and Luke fly in their makeshift helicopter to save Melina.\nDuring the chaos, Melina tries to stop Descole, but he knocks her over the side of the robot, where she holds on for her life. Luke rescues Melina while Layton duels with Descole on top of the Detragiganto, and reveals that Descole had overlooked a third melody hidden in the seal, the Song of the Sun. Again, Melina sings as Layton takes the Detragon's controls, and this time, the ruins of Ambrosia do indeed rise, infuriating Descole even further. He lunges at Layton, believing that the ruins belong only to him, but merely damages the control panel instead, throwing the Detragiganto out of control and causing it to heavily damage itself. Descole falls off the machine and disappears while Layton, Luke and Melina escape.\nIn the aftermath of the rise of Ambrosia, Melina decides she cannot take over Janice's life, and, after bidding farewell to her father, Luke and Layton, her spirit leaves Janice's body. Whistler plays one last song on the remains of the Detragon, and Janice, now in control of her body again, sings for Melina's memory. As the sun rises over the island, Layton concludes that the true \"eternal life\" of the people of Ambrosia comes from people in the modern age still speaking tales of them and their beloved Queen. Luke wonders if Melina could have been a reincarnation of the queen of Ambrosia, and Layton reminds him of the legend: that Ambrosia would rise again when its beloved queen returned.", "tmdb_id": 41066}, "22740792": {"title": "A Prophet", "plot": "Malik El Djebena, a 19-year-old French youth of Algerian descent, is sentenced to six years in prison for attacking police officers.

All the while, he is haunted by visions of the murdered Reyeb.\nWhen most of the Corsicans are transferred or released, Luciani is forced to give Malik more responsibility. Having secretly learned Corsican, Malik acts as Luciani's eyes and ears in the prison. When Malik earns the privilege of day-long furloughs outside the prison, Luciani relies on him to conduct Luciani's criminal business outside.\nRyad, a Muslim friend, teaches Malik to read and write, and the two become close. Ryad teaches Malik about his own heritage, introducing him to two other Muslims, Tarik and Hassan, and increases his power within the prison.\nMalik also becomes involved with a prison drug dealer, Jordi. When Ryad gains an early release due to testicular cancer, the three partners organize a drug-running enterprise to sell hashish. But when Ryad is kidnapped by the drug dealer Latif, Malik tracks down Latif's relative inside the prison. He kidnaps the relative's family and forces Latif's gang to release Ryad.\nWhen Luciani discovers that Malik is using his day-releases for his own personal enterprise, he punishes him. Malik is sent to meet Brahim Lattrache in Marseille, another Muslim, who is involved in a deal between Luciani and the Lingherris, an Italian mafia group. Lattrache is bitter toward the Corsicans for the murder of Reyeb and holds Malik at gunpoint. When Malik spots a deer warning sign, he remembers a recent dream of deer running in the road. He tells his kidnappers that they are in danger of hitting wild animals, and they suddenly strike a deer. Lattrache is impressed by Malik, calling him a prophet and agreeing to conduct criminal business with him instead of Luciani, even though Malik admitted that he killed Reyeb.\nLuciani believes there is a \"mole\" in his organization and decides to use Malik to assassinate Jacky Marcaggi, the don of the Corsican mafia, for secretly dealing with the Lingherris. But Malik and Ryad have their own plan for Marcaggi: they kill his bodyguards, kidnap him, and inform him that it was Luciani who ordered the hit before abandoning him in the city.\nMalik takes refuge at Ryad's house with his wife and young son. Ryad's cancer has returned; his decision to forego more chemotherapy leaves him just six months to live. He gets Malik to promise to take care of his family when he's gone.\nUpon Malik's return to the prison, he is placed in solitary for returning late - putting him out of reach of Luciani's retribution - while Marcaggi uses his influence to wipe out much of Luciani's faction.

He furthermore tells her that their picture will \"never see the light of day\" due to the fact that the Nazis will never allow its release. He hands her a forged passport and papers to get out of the country but she throws them in the trash, not believing what he says about the imminent German invasion.\nAs the filming of the 'film within a film' is on the verge of completion, we see the two actors riding stationery bicycles with a moving image in the background. As was the usual practice in creating films in earlier days, the illusion of motion is created when the moving image flickers in the background but the object in the foreground is static. This cyclist becomes a symbol for the man who pedals furiously but is actually going nowhere. That man is the Czech \"every-man\" of 1938 who desperately wishes to escape his tragic circumstances but in reality remains motionless, trapped by the forces of tyranny. Throughout the film, we catch glimpses of the film's protagonist, Emil, pedaling furiously, superimposed over the screen's larger canvas.\nHana is married to Emil, a journalist, who is conscripted by collaborating Czech officials at the radio station where he works to serve as a radio announcer after a colleague, Franta, who will not keep his opinions about the Germans to himself, is taken away by occupying forces and later executed. Emil cooperates to protect his wife from being deported to the death camps. Emil's boss at the radio station is a Nazi sympathizer who offers him the job with the understanding that no one will bother him about his wife.\nSoon, Emil has become popular hosting a cultural program in Prague entitled \"Voices of Our Home\". Meanwhile Hana becomes bored sitting at home and jeopardizes Emil's position by leaving their apartment, usually to attend the cinema. As Hana is rebellious and exasperated, she refuses to accept how risky her position is as a Jew in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia. She is almost arrested leaving the cinema after curfew, rescued by former medical student, now morphine-addicted projectionist, Petr.\nAs tensions arise, Emil begins having an affair with former colleague and former lover of Franta, Vera. Vera is now engaged to his boss, after dumping Franta for not being able to \"listen.\" After figuring out Emil is having an affair, Hana begins seeing Petr more and more, as they both begin to take up the dangerous hobby of Petr taking pictures Hana in front of Anti-Jewish shop signs. He wants to go to bed with her but she resists his advances, eventually allowing him, however, to take pictures of her in the nude. At this point in the film, things slow down considerably as Hana is no longer talking to Emil with the conflict between the two principals, grinding to a halt.\nHana's former film co-star shows up at their apartment having just escaped from a death-transport (he never made it out of Czechoslovakia). Emil is horrified that Hana allows him to take a bath in the apartment and throws him out on the street. Enraged at Emil for throwing her ex-colleague out, Hana dons her blond wig and adopts the persona of her character from her movie and crashes Emil's boss's wedding. Emil is on the verge of being fired for his 'transgression' when Reich Protector Heydrich is assassinated by Czech partisans. Nazi soldiers do a house-to-house search and discover Hana is in the apartment. When they realize who Emil is, they take no action against Hana, despite the fact that the soldiers know she is Jewish. Later, the Nazis broadcast a description of a bicycle used by one of the partisans who has killed Heydrich. Emil has another affair with a gossip columnist and takes her family's bicycle back to his apartment and attempts to hide it; this leads Hana to believe that Emil has switched sides and is now helping the partisans.\nNow Emil's boss orders him to prove his loyalty by reading a loyalty oath over the airwaves after the Heydrich assassination places all Czech citizens in jeopardy.

Along the way there are visually stylish dreams with dreams, a pulse-pounding psychedelic sex scene between the step brother and sister, an extended Evil Dead homage that segues into an epic animated sequence that pits The Patient's conflicting \"light and dark\" sides against one another.

Jonah tells Nick about a vision he received from a Watcher about a young girl Nick must help in the future to bring down Division. Nick watches Carver murder Jonah before he escapes.\nYears later, The Division has developed a drug that can boost psychic abilities. All of the test subjects died until an unknown female Pusher successfully adapted to it. The woman escapes from The Division and steals a syringe of the drug before fleeing to Hong Kong, a common hiding place for psychics. Nick now lives in Hong Kong as an expatriate, but is in trouble due to the debts he incurred while attempting to use his power as a Mover, which has become blunt due to lack of training, to cheat in gambling. Nick is first visited by two Division agents, who are looking for leads on the escaped female patient, but they find none. Nick is visited immediately after by Cassie Holmes, a moody teenage Watcher, who wants Nick to help her in tracking down the woman who is supposed to have a case with six million dollars inside. While pleading her case to Nick, they are attacked by the Triads at a market, and Nick is severely wounded by a Bleeder before the pair can escape. After being separated, Cassie finds an unconscious Nick in the care of a Stitch named Teresa Stowe who owes a favor to Cassie's mother and was told to be in the market at the exact day and time they were attacked. She heals Nick's wounds to repay her debt to Cassie's mother, while also taunting Cassie about her mother's current captivity. Her mother, Sarah, is considered the strongest Watcher ever born and was detained by The Division to ensure their control over her abilities. Unbeknownst to them, her mother was the patient who directly helped the female Pusher escape. After talking to Cassie about her past and her most recent drawings, Nick realizes she is the girl his father saw in his vision and decides to help her find the woman as well as the briefcase containing the stolen goods.\nNick and Cassie use her Watcher abilities to track down the woman, who is actually Nick's ex-girlfriend, Kira Hudson. Kira hid the case and then had a Wiper erase her memory of its location, protecting it from Division agents. Nick recruits a Shadow, named Pinky Stein, to hide Kira from Carver and other Division agents. Cassie attempts to foresee the case's location, competing with the Triad Watcher, Pop Girl. As Kira begins to get sick from withdrawal, Nick learns that Kira will get sicker and eventually die without more of the drug, which only Carver has, and realizes he must meet with Carver to save her life. Victor, a talented Mover and Carver's assistant, battles Nick and nearly kills him before Cassie convinces Carver to spare him. Cassie then finds a key in Kira's shoe which unlocks a locker atop a construction site where the case is hidden.\nKnowing that Division Watchers and especially Pop Girl, who tracks intents of her targets rather than possible outcomes like Cassie, can see their every move, Nick proposes an elaborate plan to obtain the drug and eliminate their enemies. He creates several envelopes containing instructions for each of his friends, including the Shifter called Hook Waters and the Sniff called Emily Wu. Nick seals each envelope and gives them to his friends before hiring the Wiper who erased Kira's memory to do the same to him. With his memory wiped, the Watchers are unable to see his future, enabling the group to execute Nick's plan. Hook locates the case and creates a duplicate of it and the syringe, while Pinky delivers Kira to Carver as part of the plan.

Their mission is to monitor a road as a sting to catch militants using it to transfer supplies. However, as the platoon\u2019s convoy makes their way towards the objective, an IED detonates near the truck carrying Keller\u2019s squad. Disorientated, the vehicle inadvertently heads off in a different direction from the rest of their platoon. Staff Sergeant Howston manages to make contact with their lieutenant and is ordered to conduct a reconnaissance sweep, sending Keller and a group to search the area. During this unintended stop, the men discover a mysterious shrine; the squad's interpreter Wilcox believes that it was a shrine to a Djinn, a powerful deity made from a smokeless flame, which in mythology matched the legend of a genie. A bored member of their group, Chard Davies, proceeds to fire a few rounds at a stone idol, causing it to shatter. They return to their convoy and go to the farmhouse.

Unable to speak her language they are unable to understand what she is saying, though dubious to her arrival, they keep her in case there are more. During the following days, tension begins to mount in the group. Staff Sergeant Howston is unable to reach any of their allies by radio; when Wilcox attempts to, he hears a strange distress call stating that their sergeant has gone AWOL. Howston cannot hear this call. Paranoia begins to get the better of them, when Howston receives word that they missed a car on the road which they cannot see, and their truck's ignition system is destroyed one night.\nMeanwhile, Howston and Wilcox are being haunted by gruesome images of people they had killed in the past. Wilcox goes missing, and the only witness seems to be team member Tino Hull, who sees another member, Jorge Wardell, giving off a terrifying roar before him. That night, Wilcox's dead body is found with his eyes removed and his face in a frozen expression of terror. After a series of vivid and bizarre dreams Hull grabs another member, Trevor Anderson, and holds him at gunpoint as he accuses Wardell of killing Wilcox. Hull opens fire on Wardell and Davies is forced to retaliate, killing Hull. Howston orders them to take the bodies outside, and the next morning, the group is shocked to find that they are missing.\nHowston, slowly losing his grip on his sanity, orders Keller and Anderson to keep guard outside while he himself watches to make sure nothing else goes missing. While they are gone, Davies attempts to rape the Afghan girl, and in a heated moment calls Howston a \"fucking nigger\", prompting Howston to hit him. In anger, Davies attempts to attack Howston, and Howston finally cracks, killing Davies and ordering Anderson and Keller to stash his body outside.

Keller realizes that the voice he heard on the radio was that of Anderson, when he makes the same radio call he had heard days prior.\nThe pair plan to make a break for the rest of their group, but the girl appears briefly in the house and Keller goes to find her. Meanwhile, Anderson is confronted by the dead Wilcox who reveals himself to be a hideous creature. Before Anderson can react, however, he is killed by a shot to the head from the stalking Howston.

Suddenly, another person named Yoshie (Aya Kiguchi) appears, reveals herself as a robogeisha, and destroys the villainous robot.\nWe go back in time to see Yoshie as a servant for her sister Kikue (Hitomi Hasebe), who is a geisha in training. It is later revealed that the two sisters were orphaned, and though they used to be close (with Kikue being the favorite child), they are now enemies. Yoshie is klutzy and ruins Kikue's performance for Hikaru Kageno (Takumi Saito), heir to Kageno Steel Manufacturing.\nDespite her klutziness, Kageno is impressed with Yoshie's beauty and becomes more interested when he witnesses her display of superhuman strength when threatened by Kikue.\nEventually, Kageno invites the two sisters to his house, where they are captured by the goblin ladies. The two are forced to fight to the death, and after Kikue wounds and actually threatens to kill her sister, Yoshie snaps and knocks out Kikue, once again displaying superhuman physical prowess. Accordingly, Kageno and his father begin training Yoshie to become an assassin for the company along with many other young Geisha-type women, and she quickly becomes the head assassin. They are told that Kageno Steel seeks to use them to kill terrorists and other national threats in an effort to create an \"Ideal World\".

The leader, however, had installed a gun into his leg and uses it to kill Kageno's father. Hiraku, now freed from responsibility, activates a protocol that turns his family castle into a giant robot.

She confronts Kageno, but is met by Kikue who has been upgraded into a superior model of robogeisha and who has had her mind wiped. Kikue  defeats Yoshie. Knowing she has been bested, Yoshie reveals that, in fact, she was her father's favorite daughter because Kikue was actually born to their father's mistress and was looked down upon.

The next day, the Mystery Inc. gang arrives in Tokyo, where Daphne has been invited to participate in a martial arts tournament at the prestigious Mirimoto Academy, run by Miss Mirimoto. The gang meet Daphne's friend Miyumi, who explains the difficulty of winning the tournament and entering the school as a student. After Daphne defeats Miss Mirimoto's bodyguard, Sojo, and almost defeats Miyumi, Mirimoto tells her she shows promise as a fighter. Also at the tournament is Mr. Takagawa, who warns Mirimoto that the Black Samurai has risen and will be after the Destiny Scroll, which is at the school. That night, during a feast, the Black Samurai and his Ninja warriors attack the school and steal the scroll. However, Mirimoto explains the scroll was only a copy, and shows the gang the real one.\nMr. Takagawa explains to the gang that the Black Samurai was an ancient warrior who asked the renowned swordsmith Masamune to craft a sword of great mystical power; Masamune agreed, but stated that the process would take a whole year. Masamune's evil apprentice Muramasa offered to make another sword in only half the time, which the Samurai accepted. However, Muramasa's evil nature passed into the blade, and when the Samurai took the sword, he was infected with the evil and transformed into the Black Samurai, wielding the Sword of Doom. When Masamune finished crafting his sword, the Sword of Fate, he presented it to the legendary Green Dragon. After a long battle in the sky, the Green Dragon defeated the Black Samurai and imprisoned him in the Sword of Doom. The Dragon then hid the Sword of Doom and marked its whereabouts within a riddle written on the Destiny Scroll.\nShaggy and Scooby-Doo unconsciously solve the riddle, and Mirimoto dispatches the gang, Miyumi and Mr. Takagawa to find the Sword of Doom before the Samurai. The gang finds the sword in a cave on an island in the Pacific Ocean, where they deal with a tribe living on the island and are attacked by the Black Samurai. During the fight, the Black Samurai is revealed to be Sojo. The gang brings Sojo back to  Mirimoto, but she and Miyumi capture them. Mirimoto explains that she staged the tournament to bring Mystery, Inc. to Japan so that they would find the Sword of Doom for her, and that she intends to use the Black Samurai to return Japan to the way it was in feudal times. The ninja army is revealed to be made up of robots, in which are equipped with the various fighting techniques of her students, including Daphne's. She then locks Fred, Daphne, Velma and Mr. Takagawa in the museum, but not before Daphne kicks the Sword of Doom from Mirimoto's hand into Scooby and Shaggy's possession.\nScooby and Shaggy manage to escape with the blade, but are chased by the ninja robots. They are saved by Matsuhiro, a sushi shop owner and Samurai, but the ninjas manage to reclaim the sword. Matsuhiro, who is aware of the legend, agrees to train Scooby and Shaggy as Samurai. He instructs them to pass through the gates of Earth, Wind, Fire and Water in order to find the Green Dragon and the Sword of Fate. After doing so, they find the Green Dragon, who takes them back to the museum to combat the Black Samurai. Kenji inadvertently frees Fred, Daphne, Velma and Mr. Takagawa, and they, with the aid of a repentant Miyumi, attempt to stop Sojo and Mirimoto from resurrecting the Black Samurai, but their plan fails and they are captured. After reviving the Black Samurai, Mirimoto tries to make him her servant, but the villain has no interest in her vision and knocks her out.

Searching at night at Grimes' house, they learn that the school grounds were once used by Coolsville Academy, a prep school that was destroyed during a flood the same day they intended to bury a time capsule of the school's history; the gang concludes the ghosts are trying to get their school shut down so they can search for the time capsule unimpeded. The ghosts attack again, and the teens are knocked out. The Specter, keeping Scooby and Grimes as prisoners, forces the gang to search underground for the time capsule. Unable to find the capsule, they trick the Specter into coming down to carry the capsule out of the hole, but the plan backfires when they try to lock him up in a flooded room, and the Specter acquires the capsule.\nStealing the capsule back, the gang uses the spell book to banish the ghosts. Scooby breaks free of his restraints and arrives just in time to subdue the Specter, who is soon revealed to be Deedle. It is then revealed that a stamp misprint was hidden within the time capsule, something that would have been worth a fortune. Determined to obtain the misprint, Deedle used the spell book to summon the ghosts to have the school evacuated so he can accomplish his goal.\nAfter Deedle is arrested for his crimes, the group is re-instated to Coolsville High and publicly congratulated by Grimes, who becomes the new principal. He apologizes to them for wrongly accusing them before announcing the official burial of the time capsule.

Hartman who is by-the-book and hierarchical, got the job despite being the second best shooter in team history. The best was Hartman's former teammate Lincoln (Huang Xiaoming), whose unorthodox methods and confidence makes him arrogant and disdainful of authority. Hartman and Lincoln are two alpha males with a long-running rivalry, with only room at the top for one sharpshooter.\nLincoln however was dismissed and jailed for accidentally killing a hostage (the son of the bank chairman) during a bank robbery committed by crime boss Tao (Jack Kao). Lincoln maintained in defense that Tao was about to pull the pin of a grenade but no one else on the Sniper Team could support his story, indeed there is a feeling that Hartman (who was the only other person who could have been in a position to see Tao with the grenade) may have withheld key evidence that would have exonerated Lincoln. Back to the present, upon his release from prison after a four-year stint, Lincoln still harbors a grudge against his former SDU teammates despite being welcomed back into society by Shane. Within days Lincoln has purchased an illegal sniper rifle. He also rekindles his relationship with his wife Crystal (Mango Wong) who encourages him to seek revenge, after they view the wedding ring in the aquarium.\nIn a flashback, there are two rookie cops getting involved in criminal shootout. One of them is OJ (Edison Chen), who manages to stay calm and kills a criminal. Lincoln sees potential in this youngster and decides to take him under his wing. Yet when OJ becomes fascinated by Lincoln and determines to top his shooting skills, he becomes another wild card on the loose. OJ's unorthodox means leads him into frequent conflicts with Hartman's rigid authoritarian style.\nWithin a few days of being a free man, Lincoln helps crime boss Tao escape prisoner transfer convoy. An off-duty Hartman witnesses the incident, killing several of Tao's men but unable to prevent them from breaking their boss free, after Lincoln tips him off to the crime's location as kind of a \"ha ha, I'm helping the bad guys,\" taunt. Ming and his team are dispatched to profile the suspect. OJ, the hot-headed rookie on the team, surprises everyone by accurately replicating the suspect\u2019s impossible shots. He manages to do this because of advice from Lincoln.\nAs Hartman investigates the suspect, he inadvertently runs into crime boss Tao and his henchmen in the elevator of an apartment building. Hartman manages to kill one of the criminals but while chasing after Tao he is foiled by Lincoln. Hartman then pursues Lincoln to the roof and Lincoln loses his grip on a rope and falls down. Tao escapes but his right-hand man is cornered by police, so he flees into a restaurant and takes hostages. Hartman, now in the police command van, coordinates his sniper team but only OJ has a good shot. Although Hartman's order is \"shoot to kill\", OJ instead wounds the criminal in the arm holding the gun. Although the hostage situation has been resolved without loss of innocent life, Hartman and OJ have a heated argument over the disobeyed order, with OJ arguing that this allowed for the mobster's capture so the case can be further investigated.\nLater it is revealed Lincoln has survived the fall with no major injuries and continues his plan of revenge and kidnaps Shane, who is Lincoln's last friend and supporter from the SDU. While Lincoln and Crystal make conversation, Shane regains consciousness and reminds him that Crystal is dead and it is revealed that Lincoln has been hallucinating all this time. In a fit of rage, Lincoln takes his rifle and fires at the ghosts of Hartman and the bank chairman's son, before realizing that he has inadvertently killed Shane. A flashback shows Crystal visiting Lincoln in prison, but he tells her to go away. Crystal then returns home and drops the wedding ring into the aquarium.

First Lincoln forces the crime boss Tao reenact the bank robbery hostage taking, and unlike four years ago, this time Lincoln successfully kills Tao and saves the hostage.

He then disappears.\nThe Yamato warps back to Earth, and the energy being Metzler appears again. He reveals that the black hole headed for Earth is artificially created and controlled: it will serve as a portal to \"steal\" Earth and take its resources, since they cannot be found in his world. Kodai realizes that it must have a power source. The Wave Motion Gun automatically reconfigured to enable it to fire all six shots in one go, a risky decision that could destroy the ship, but the crew unanimously agree that saving Earth is more important. The Yamato dives into the black hole, and as it reaches the core, the Wave Motion Gun fires, destroying the artificial weapon in a gigantic implosion. The blast from the Wave Motion Gun had ruptured and damaged the Yamato bow and front section; the third bridge (where the ship's navigation room resides) also suffers serious damage and is exposed to space, killing Chief Navigator Maho Orihara, who was working in it, and her assistants; but the ship is still space-worthy and orbits Earth in triumph.

Mission Control finds that the sounds from their helmets happen to be soft barks, and conclude they are golden retriever puppies, and this is broadcast on the news. The children find out through the news (\"We're live at Vision Enterprises, where quite a furry tale is unfolding. It seems five golden retriever puppies have been accidentally launched into space\".). The dogs, while on the Moon, meet a ferret named Gravity who is their mission control assistant. But since their only communication is from audio, they don't know she's a ferret. She orders them to get back on the Vision 1.\nWhen returning to Earth, the path is changed by an unworthy Dr. Finkel. The path's telemetry is reverted into a meteor shower. The \"auto-avoidance system\" takes control of the Vision 1, rotating and shifting heavily between every meteor in its path, but the Vision 1's data communications antenna is busted when it becomes struck by a meteor. Budderball is sent to repair the antenna by doing a space walk outside of the Vision 1. At Mission Control, the adults are puzzled about the change of the telemetry course of the Vision 1 when Sam accuses Dr. Finkel of changing the path. As Dr. Finkel's denies it, Pi uses the security camera to confirm that Dr. Finkel was indeed at the desk at 7:49 pm, the time when the telemetry course was changed. As Dr. Finkel is taken away by security, Sam approaches Dr. Finkel and calls him \"Dr. Stinkel\".\nThe Mission Control center receives Yuri's distress signal in the Cosmopod before the Vision 1 enters the atmosphere through the blackout zone. They wait 4 minutes until they arrive, but they arrive early. Vision 1 ends its mission by slowing down on the take-off strip. The dogs find out Gravity is a ferret. Yuri crashes his pod, and is rescued by some soldiers, telling them he comes from space.\nPi awards the dogs wings of true heroism, with their title as \"Space Buddies\".

Among the audience is a girl named Courtney Lane (Tammin Sursok). Interspersed with the scenes of the band playing, lead singer Nikko Alexander (Nolan Gerard Funk) calmly walks into the club through the back, barely making his cue for \"Don't Tell Me\". At the end of the song, he kicks over one of the amps, destroying it for effect. After the performance, the other members of Flux, upset by his carelessness, kick him out of the band; Nikko's girlfriend Amy (Britt Irvin), who is also in the band, dumps him. After the band members leave, Courtney frantically attempts to recruit Nikko into a show choir named \"Spectacular!,\" of which she is leader. Though Nikko is skeptical and condescendingly rejects her offer, Courtney begs him to come to a carnival to see the choir perform and then make his decision.\nThe next day at the carnival, Nikko arrives in time to see the Spectacular! show choir perform \"Eye of the Tiger\". Afterward, the ever-anxious Courtney once again attempts to persuade Nikko, who is less than impressed by the group's performance and style, to join the show choir and help them win a national contest, even offering him half the group's earnings from the contest in exchange for his consent. Nikko declines to join the group, stating that he isn't interested in choir. Soon, another show choir named Ta-da performs \"Things We Do for Love\". The lead singers are Royce (Simon Curtis), who used to be the lead singer for Spectacular! but quit after breaking up with Courtney, and Tammi (Victoria Justice), Royce's new girlfriend who is a snobby and selfish girl. It is hinted she was a member of \"Spectacular!\" because of the number of times Courtney calls her a backstabber and that the letter I in her name stand for the \"ice in her veins\". Later on, Nikko meets with and performs for a famous music producer named Mr. Dickenson (Matthew Bennett), who informs him that he has a shot at getting a record deal if he can raise enough money for equipment for his demo, which has to be excellent. Nikko recalls Courtney's offer of half the earnings from the contest Spectacular! plans to perform in, and decides to join the choir in order to get the money to pay for his demo. When he approaches the choir Courtney remembers his mockery of their carnival performance and initially refuses to let him join, but acquiesces after Nikko demonstrates his talent by performing \"Break My Heart\" in front of the whole group, who are impressed by his vocals. When they are practicing, however, Nikko finds out that dancing for show choir is not as easy as it looks and cannot easily pick up the dance routines. Nikko, who lives with his older brother Stavros (Christopher Jacot), does not inform his brother that he has joined show choir or that he is attempting to get a record deal because he knows Stavros would not approve.\nSeveral days later the group, dressed in hideous cowboy costumes, goes to perform at the club Nikko and his old band, Flux, had performed at in the beginning of the movie. There Nikko runs into his old band members, leading to an awkward confrontation and a lot of mockery from Flux. Meanwhile, Ta-da, who are also at the club, performs their song \"Lonely Love Song\". Nikko discovers from the other Spectacular! members that Royce is Courtney's ex-boyfriend. Upon witnessing Ta-da's good performance and the snobby attitudes of Tammi and Royce, Nikko becomes determined to help Spectacular! win the upcoming competition and begins to think that the group should come up with new dance moves and new music. One day, before Courtney arrives for choir practice, Nikko encourages the other choir members to try things a different way, and performs \"Your Own Way\", persuading the others to join in, Nikko sang the beginning of the song, and ask the others to show some talents, Tajid (Avan Jogia) started beatboxing, then other members Janet (Shannon Chan-Kent), Caspian (Joel Ballard) and Robin (Andrea Lewis) showcase their singing talent. Though they are initially reluctant to go against Courtney's wishes, the rest of the group eventually agree that they need a new routine in order to win the competition. They later meet up at Nikko's house, unbeknown to Courtney, and Nikko begins to teach them new dance moves, stating that if they perform the song in front of Courtney she would be impressed and may agree to change the group's style. The choir assembles at Nikko's house every night to practice while still attending practices with Courtney every afternoon.\nNikko learns of Spectacular!'s tradition of gathering for a bowling night the week before a competition. Only four members, Nikko, Courtney, Caspian and Janet, show up at the bowling alley, where they discover that Tammi and Royce are already bowling in their lane. After a brief confrontation between the two groups, Nikko persuades the others to perform a song using \"Rock The World,\" a spoof of the real-life video game Rock Band. Random selection chooses a song called \"For the First Time\", which was Courtney and Royce's old duet. She and Nikko sing it, much to Royce's jealousy, and Nikko and Courtney are becoming attracted to each other. Nikko invites Courtney over to his house for a surprise, and when they get there the whole group has assembled on Nikko's rooftop, where they all perform \"Your Own Way\" for Courtney. Courtney, instead of being impressed, is upset, accusing Nikko to have betrayed her by practicing another routine behind her back, and then leaves.\nLater that night, Nikko goes to Courtney's house to apologize and almost has a fistfight with Royce, who has come to ask Courtney to get back together with him. Courtney rejects Royce, who tauntingly tells Nikko that Ta-Da will beat Spectacular! at the competition in the \"weirdest trash talk that [Nikko's] ever heard.\" After Royce leaves, Nikko apologizes to Courtney for taking control of the group behind her back and offers to do things her way, but Courtney admits that the group needs a change. Courtney's mother tells Nikko that he can bring some good and change to the \"Spectacular!\" group and that Courtney will know how far they are actually able to push the envelope to win. The two of them decide to combine their talents and perform a song that everyone can agree upon, and Mr. Romano (Greg Germann), their music teacher, suggests a song called \"Something to Believe In\". Spectacular! begins intense rehearsals and all seems well (\"Just Freak\"), until Mr. Dickinson pays Nikko and Stavros a visit and informs them that his boss is offering Nikko and Flux a record deal after an audition and will only be available on Saturday night. Knowing that Spectacular! is scheduled to perform at the concert on Saturday night, Nikko is torn between his commitment to the choir and his one shot at getting a record deal. He tries to inform Courtney of his decision to audition for the record deal, but cannot bring himself to do it. Meanwhile, Amy informs Stavros that Nikko has joined choir and Stavros confronts Nikko in front of the members of Spectacular!, insisting that Niko drop out of choir and audition for the record deal instead. The other members of Spectacular! are upset at Nikko for bailing on them at the last minute, and Courtney feels that Nikko has betrayed her again.\nMr. Romano visits Nikko, who is having a tough time deciding what to do, at his house and reveals that he was once in a famous band as Joey Rome that could have been more successful if he hadn't flopped and broke his contract due to his fear of taking risks. Before leaving to go audition for the record deal, Courtney shows up. Nikko fears that she is mad at him for turning his back on \"Spectacular!\" but instead she kisses him on the cheek and wishes him luck. On concert night, Ta-Da performs \"On The Wings Of A Dream\" and earns much applause and acclaim from the audience. Meanwhile, Nikko and Flux perform at their audition for the record deal, but Nikko's heart is not in it and the producers notice and tell him they are not interested; Stavros says that Nikko is just warming up, and that he is better than what he is giving out. Nikko begs them to let him show where his \"heart is.\" When it is Spectacular!s turn to sing \"Something to Believe In\" at the national competition, Nikko, much to Courtney's surprise and delight, arrives onstage right before the chorus, belting out a long note. Flux joins him, playing background music, and Mr. Romano reprises his dream as a rock star by playing a guitar during the song.  Nikko and Courtney reconcile, and the group earns a standing ovation.\nTa-Da is announced as the winner of the contest and Spectacular! is disqualified because Flux were unregistered members of the act. Tammi reveals to Royce that she had only used him to win the contest and breaks up with him. Even though Spectacular! lost the contest, Nikko's amazing performance got him the record deal. After everyone leaves, Nikko and Courtney share a kiss.

Mitch says he\u2019ll put his entire bag of cigarettes on the table, and the loser has to eat an entire tube of toothpaste.\nMitch loses the round and refuses to eat the toothpaste as the cellmates continually ask him to uphold his end of the bet.

The cellmates laugh, and Peter says he\u2019ll make another drink to make him feel better.  Peter takes water filled with urine and feces from the toilet bowl.

Under his leadership, the economy begins to thrive, and he assembles a force of government-employed superheroes consisting of Captain Atom, Katana, Black Lightning, Power Girl, Starfire, and Major Force. Despite Power Girl's enthusiasm about the peace and stability and Captain Atom's loyalty to the government, Superman and Batman maintain their distrust toward Luthor.\nThe United States government discovers a massive Kryptonite meteor hurtling toward Earth. Instead of asking superheroes for aid, Luthor decides to destroy it with nuclear missiles. Luthor arranges a meeting with Superman in Gotham City under the pretense of a truce, only to result in a battle with the hired Metallo against Superman and Batman, in which Metallo manages to injure them both before an unknown assailant kills Metallo. On national television, Luthor pins Metallo's murder on Superman, using altered footage of their battle to implicate him as well as a baseless claim that Kryptonite radiation can affect Superman's judgment, then places a billion-dollar bounty on Superman.\nBatman and Superman break into S.T.A.R. Labs seeking information on the meteor and finding Metallo's remains; they realize that a radioactive energy blast is what killed him, and it was made to look like Superman's heat vision. An army of villains looking to collect the bounty attacks them. Superman and Batman easily overpower most of the villains while Captain Atom defeats the rest with a giant energy blast. All of Luthor's superhero team except Power Girl, whose loyalties are divided, attempt to capture the heroic duo until Superman creates a twister using his super-speed, and the two heroes escape with Power Girl.\nIn Metropolis, Power Girl admits that she does not believe Superman killed Metallo and that she doesn\u2019t like Luthor. Luthor's superheroes catch up and the fight begins anew with Power Girl aiding Batman and Superman until Batman deduces that Major Force killed Metallo under Luthor's orders and goads him into admitting it in front of everyone. When Major Force snaps and tries to kill him, an angry Power Girl punches him in the stomach hard enough to rupture his containment suit, releasing his radiation. Captain Atom, who was listening nearby, manages to absorb the energy, disintegrating Major Force and leaving him comatose.\nMeanwhile, the missiles fail due to the sheer amount of radiation the meteor gives off detonating them before impact. Amanda Waller discovers that Luthor has secretly been taking a serum composed of strength-enhancing steroids and liquid Kryptonite. Luthor then informs Waller that he will let the meteor hit the Earth as he plans to rebuild society in his image, making himself Earth's single leader. Batman and Superman battle Captain Marvel and Hawkman before breaking into Luthor's base of operations to retrieve data on the meteor. Luthor refuses to relinquish the data, going so far as to erase it from the lab computers, but Waller gives them a copy. Batman, Superman, and Power Girl fly off to Tokyo to deliver the data to Toyman, who has already built a giant rocket-propelled spacecraft, intending to use it as a large missile to stop the meteor. Waller and the military then attempt to arrest Luthor with the discovery of his world-domination scheme, but he injects himself with more Kryptonite steroids and dons a power suit equipped with Kryptonite weaponry. After escaping Waller and the military, Luthor follows Superman and Batman overseas, intending to kill Superman himself.\nAfter Batman and Superman arrive at Toyman's lab, he shows them the spacecraft, which resembles a giant, robotic composite version of Superman and Batman. With the data, Toyman is able to calculate the necessary reinforcements needed for the rocket so it will not explode before impact. Unfortunately, Luthor arrives and neutralizes Power Girl, Superman, and Batman,  then disables the rocket's remote guidance systems so that it will not take off by itself. With no other choice left, Batman decides to fly the rocket himself even in spite of Superman's protests. Though initially faring poorly against Luthor and his power suit, Superman eventually gains the upper hand when they reach Metropolis, and disables his power suit. Luthor's team arrives with a recovered Captain Atom, who apprehends Luthor. Batman succeeds in destroying the meteor, and Superman finds him alive in an escape pod.\nWith the truth of Metallo's death now public knowledge, Superman is cleared of the murder charge, while Luthor is arrested and taken away to face trial and impeachment for his crimes.

Compared to their surrogates, the human operators are depicted as slovenly and homebound. Protected from harm, a surrogate's operator feels no pain when the surrogate is damaged, and can do acrobatics that a normal person couldn't. In Boston, FBI agent Tom Greer has been estranged from his wife Maggie since their son's death in a car crash several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies.\nTom and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters, investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed at a Fort Point club. Jared Canter, one of the victims, is the son of Dr. Lionel Canter, the inventor of surrogates and the former head of their manufacturing company, Virtual Self Industries (VSI). The two determine that a human, Miles Strickland, used a new type of weapon to overload the surrogates' systems and kill their operators. After locating Strickland, Tom attempts to bring him into custody. Strickland uses the weapon and injures Tom during the chase; Tom inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone known as the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the US). A mob helps Strickland and destroys Tom's surrogate. The Dread leader, a man known as the Prophet, kills Strickland and confiscates the weapon.\nWith his surrogate destroyed, Tom is forced to interact in the world without one. He learns that VSI originally produced the weapon, designed to load a virus that overloads a surrogate's systems, thus disabling it, under a government contract. Unexpectedly, the weapon also disabled the fail-safe protocols protecting operators. The project was promptly scrapped and all prototypes supposedly destroyed. Tom also learns that Andrew Stone, his FBI superior, supplied the weapon to Strickland and ordered Dr. Canter's assassination, upon VSI's request, for his criticism of surrogate use. Jared, using one of his father's many surrogates, was killed instead. Jennifer is murdered in her own home by an unknown man who hijacks her surrogate, and the Prophet orders the weapon delivered to her. During a military raid on the reservation, the Prophet is shot, revealing he was actually a surrogate, with Canter himself as the operator. Tom steals the weapon's codes from Stone, but \"Jennifer\" escapes with the codes.\nImmediately travelling to Canter's home, Tom discovers that Canter has been controlling not only the Prophet, but also Jennifer and the surrogate he used to kill Jennifer as well. Using Jennifer's surrogate in FBI Headquarters, Canter uses the weapon to kill Stone and proceeds to upload the virus to all surrogates, which will destroy them and kill their operators. Canter reveals that he only wanted to empower the disabled to live normal lives, but after he was fired from VSI, they capitalized on surrogacy for profit. Convinced his plan is unstoppable, Canter disconnects from Jennifer's surrogate and swallows a cyanide pill. Tom takes control of Jennifer's surrogate and, with the assistance of the network's system administrator, Bobby Saunders, insulates the virus so the operators will survive, but a second step is required to save the surrogates.

Tony storms out of the house as Anne follows. He turns around as she says they need to find a new car. Tony tells her to come so they can go.\nAnne asks why he took her.

As he breaks the bolt off the door, an older man walking his dog spots the station wagon and looks right at the house. While Anne and Tony are inside, he starts yelling because he has run out of the supply of drugs he usually injects into himself. Tony drags her close to the window and asks her what she sees; she says she can't see anything because it's too dark, as it is nighttime. He calls her a liar. Lights flash outside as it becomes evident that the FBI and police have found them.\nTony becomes hysterical, blaming Anne and saying he is not going to go to prison. Anne tells him to call the police, as she won't let them hurt him. She gets on the phone and asks them to let Tony call his grandmother. When he talks to his grandmother, she asks if it's true that he took Anne, and said she'll be praying for him. Tony tells his grandmother that he's going to kill Anne, and then himself. He points the gun at Anne's chest as Anne picks up the phone and tells the police not to shoot, as they are coming out. She tells Tony they can't shoot, or they'd end up shooting her, too. As they exit the house, he has his arm wrapped around her; she turns around and tells him to put the gun down. As he does, Anne runs to Officer Timbrook. Tony begins screaming for Anne as the FBI and police rush towards him. He begs them not to shoot, as he is getting on the ground. While Officer Timbrook is hugging Anne, he shows her the teddy bear that she left behind, returning it to Anne. Tony is put in the back of a police car, still screaming her name. Anne and Officer Timbrook walk up to the window as Anne throws at the window the wedding ring Tony gave to her, much to Tony's shock, as he begins to realize that he has forever failed in his goal of keeping Annie to himself, and he is now paying the highest price for it. As revealed in the text in the end, Tony ends up being convicted of his crime and sentenced to life in prison without parole.\nThe film ends with Anne in a car as Officer Timbrook drives her home. She gets out of the car, running towards her family and hugging them as reporters all around are filming and asking questions. Officer Timbrook smiles while Anne's father looks up at him, mouthing, \"Thank you.\"", "tmdb_id": 19560}, "21082878": {"title": "Taking a Chance on Love (film)", "plot": "Peyton MacGruder (Genie Francis) is still learning how to be a parent after reuniting with Christine, the daughter she gave up for adoption 18 years earlier.

His friend Digs, who has devoted himself to having sex with as many high school girls as possible, is disgusted at this and wants Chase to join him on the dating scene.\nA group of Native Americans arrive in town, taking up temporary residence in the hotel run by Chase's father, to consider setting up a casino in Patriotville. They negotiate with the town government for a bribe by threatening to have the casino built in Sulfur Falls instead. Feeling the town needs the casino to keep from going bankrupt, the mayor resorts to taking $1,000,000 out of various town projects to fund the bribe.\nChase spots a girl, Lucy, trying to get into her father's car. She sets the interior on fire and convinces Chase to give her a ride away from the scene before he realizes what's happening. Lucy comes from Sulfur Falls and tracked her father to Patriotville after he abandoned Lucy and her mother for another woman. Though she claims to be after a family heirloom that her father took, Chase intuits that Lucy is obsessed with her father. Intrigued, he asks for her phone number.\nDigs, whose father is on the town council, tells Chase about the casino deal. Chase is incensed even before learning that the proposed building site is the historical battlefield, believing that the casino will desecrate the town's culture.

Lucy finds Chase and confesses that, much as Digs suspected, the mayor is the third married man in a position of authority who she had an affair with, but also says that she is giving up this behavior.

Uncoupling the front car of the train below 51st Street, they take the passengers hostage. Metropolitan Transportation Authority employee Walter Garber, working the Rail Control Center as a train dispatcher, receives a call from Ryder, demanding $10 million in cash to be paid within 60 minutes. Ryder warns that every minute he waits past the deadline, he will kill a hostage.\nBashkin kills a suspicious New York City Transit Police officer, and all the passengers not in the front car, except the motorman, are released. Garber reluctantly negotiates with Ryder as Ramos and Emri set up Internet access in the tunnel. On his laptop, Ryder watches the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge nearly 1,000 points in response to the hijacking. A hostage's laptop also connects to the Internet, and its webcam allows the control center to observe Ryder and Ramos. Lieutenant Camonetti of the New York City Police Department Emergency Service Unit takes over negotiations, which infuriates Ryder, who kills the train's motorman to force Camonetti to bring Garber back.\nCamonetti learns that Garber is being investigated for allegedly accepting a $35,000 bribe over a contract for new Japanese subway cars. Ryder also discovers the allegations online and forces Garber to confess by threatening to kill a passenger. To save the hostage, Garber claims that he was offered the bribe while deciding between two companies, using the money to pay for his child's college tuition, and insists he would have made the same decision regardless. The mayor agrees to Ryder's ransom, ordering the police to deliver it. En route, the police car is involved in an accident and fails to deliver the money in time. Garber attempts to bluff Ryder that the ransom has arrived, unaware he has been monitoring events on his laptop. Ryder threatens to execute a child's mother, but another hostage, a former soldier, sacrifices himself and is killed. A brief gunfight erupts after an Emergency Services Unit sniper is bitten by a rat and discharges his weapon, killing Ramos.\nBased on clues from Garber's conversations, the police discover that Ryder is Dennis Ford, a manager at a private equity firm who was sentenced to prison for investment fraud. Ford had agreed to a plea bargain to serve three years, but received ten years instead. One of the mayor's aides mentions the extreme drop in the major stock indexes, and the mayor deduces that Ryder is attempting to manipulate the market via put options. Ryder demands that Garber deliver the ransom money himself to avoid coming in contact with the police. Garber is flown to the terminal, where he is given a pistol for protection. Ryder brings Garber aboard and orders him to operate the train down the tunnel below 33rd Street, where Garber and the hijackers exit, rigging the train to go on without them. Garber manages to separate himself at a railway crossing and then follows Ryder to Track 61 underneath Waldorf Astoria hotel. Ryder parts from Bashkin and Emri, who are shot dead after being surrounded by police and provoking deadly force in an apparent suicide-by-cop.

A hippie theater troupe, The Earthlight Players, rents the barn, but can hardly pay any rent. Due to financial trouble, the motel may have to be closed, but Elliot pleads with the local bank not to foreclose on the mortgage and Sonia delivers a tirade about her struggles as a Russian refugee. The family is given until the end of the summer to pay up.\nElliot plans to hold a small musical festival, and has, for $1, obtained a permit from the town's chamber of commerce (of which he is also the president). When he hears that the organizers of the Woodstock Festival face opposition against the originally planned location, he offers his permit and the motel accommodations to organizer Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff). A neighbor, Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), provides his nearby farm land; first they agree on a fee of $5,000, but after realizing how many people will come, Yasgur demands $75,000, which the organizers reluctantly accept. Elliot comes to agreement about the fee for the motel more smoothly. Initial objections by his mother quickly disappear when she sees the cash paid in advance.\nElliot and Yasgur encounter a little bit of expected opposition. The local diner refuses to serve Elliot anymore, inspectors target the motel (and only his) for building code violations, and some local boys paint a swastika and hate words on the motel. However, resistance quickly dissolves in the tidal wave of peace and love (and commerce) brought to the area. The Tiber family works hard serving the massive influx of visitors and become wealthy in the process. A cross-dressing veteran, Vilma (Liev Schreiber), is hired as a security guard. Elliot also struggles with hiding his homosexuality from his family, when he connects romantically with one of the event organizers staying at the motel.\nOn the first day of the concert, Elliot, his father, and Vilma hear the music begin in the distance. Elliot's father, transformed and enlivened by all the new life in town, tells Elliot to go and see the concert. Elliot hitches a ride through the peaceful traffic jam on the back of a benevolent state trooper's motorcycle and arrives at the event. There, he meets a hippie couple (Paul Dano and Kelli Garner), who invite him to join them on an LSD trip in their VW Bus a short distance from the crowd. Elliot has trouble relaxing at first, but gradually melts into a psychedelic union with them. When they finally emerge after sundown, Elliot watches the vast crowd and brilliant lights of the distant concert ripple with harmonious hallucinatory visuals that swell into serene white light.\nElliot returns home from his liberating experience and has breakfast with his parents. He suggests to his mother that they now have enough money to replace him, but she cannot bear to let him have his freedom. Elliot storms out, facetiously suggesting his mom eat the hash brownies Vilma has just offered. After another beautiful day at the festival, during which his friend the Vietnam veteran, Billy (Emile Hirsch), appears to overcome his post-traumatic stress disorder, Elliot returns home to find his parents laughing and cavorting hysterically, having eaten Vilma's hash brownies. The once-brittle family (particularly Sonia) is united in joy and delirious affection.\nThe next morning, however, Sonia inadvertently reveals that she has secretly saved $97,000 in cash in the floorboards of her closet. Elliot is upset that his mother hid this from him while he put his own savings into helping his parents.\nAfter the final day of the concert, Elliot decides to move to California as he packs up his things and says farewell to his father, after his father encourages him to strike out on his own.

One survives and flees to Shizontonia's front gate, where he delivers a report to an unseen individual in the city. Niren, upon receiving the news that reinforcements would not be arriving anytime soon, decides to take the knights to investigate the source of the aer, which he believes to be a fortress at the center of a nearby lake. Flynn disagrees with Niren's decision, viewing it as disobedience of a direct order.\nGarista, the strategist for the Niren Corps, attempts to dissuade Niren but to no avail. The investigation in the fortress turns out to be more dangerous as the aer begins to turn the fortress into a living weapon to attack the knights. The knights make their way into the fortress' center, where a giant blastia is found to be using the aer. Niren uses the device given by Rita to stifle the gushing of aer, but the sudden ceasing of aer flow causes a backlash, and the blastia explodes, destroying the barrier blastia that keeps Shizontonia safe, knocking out Chastel and causing the fortress to begin to crumble. As Niren attempts to carry Chastel to safety, the floor beneath him crumbles. Niren is able to throw Chastel to Yuri and is stranded in a sinkhole of gushing aer. Despite Yuri's attempts to save him, due to a wound he received during the investigation, Niren is unable to pull himself to safety. Leaving his blastia with Yuri, Niren has the knights leave without him.\nThe knights and the entire town mourn over Niren's death.

Yuri and Flynn confront Garista with this information. Garista reveals that he attempted to create a new kind of blastia illegally but failed. He decided to leave the blastia to destroy itself, destroying Shizontonia and killing all witnesses. Yuri and Flynn attempt to arrest Garista, but a fight ensues, and Yuri kills him.

Kana obliges, and Utsumi agrees to go on a date with Ayaka. The next day, Utsumi shows Kana and Ayaka a news report on his cell phone about the mysterious death in Nagoya. Utsumi recalls a story he heard in elementary school about Teke Teke, a ghost with no lower extremities. When individuals walk on the overpass at night, it is said that Teke Teke will chase after them (making a \"teke teke\" noise as she moves along the ground), and that if they look back, she will cut them in half.\nAs Utsumi rides away on his bicycle, Kana and Ayaka walk back to their homes together. Ayaka upset that Utsumi seems to like Kana more than her, angrily takes a different route home. Reaching the overpass, Ayaka sees Teke Teke, and trips after trying to run away from her. Teke Teke severs Ayaka's upper body from her lower body and disappears along the train tracks into the night. After school, Kana learns that Hiromi's boyfriend was arrested by Aichi Prefecture police officers for her murder. He denied any involvement in her death and told the authorities that he saw a woman with no lower half.\nThe next night, Kana places a bouquet at the site of Ayaka's death. She hears Ayaka call her name and turns to see Teke Teke, who begins to chase her. Kana runs into Utsumi, who helps her escape on his bicycle.

The scholar's assistant, Takeda, leads them to the daughter of a landlord who lived in that area. She tells Kana, Rie, and Takeda that the woman who killed herself was a nurse named Kashima Reiko, who was assaulted and raped by an American soldier. Traumatized, Kashima associated the color red with the bleeding she experienced during the incident and discarded all red objects in her sight as a result.\nAfterward, Takeda informs Kana and Rie of rumors he heard in middle school, which told of a memorial built for Kashima in Mikasa-cho, which has since fallen over. Rie, who reveals that she also encountered Teke Teke not long after Kana did, drives to Mikasa-cho by nightfall with the help of directions given by Takeda. There, Kana and Rie discover the fallen memorial in a forested area. They lift the memorial back into its original position, and after returning to Rie's red car, Kana and Rie notice Teke Teke behind them in the road.

Tony tells them that he \"sawed off\" a matching weapon for a Hong Kong hitman who works on Seafood Street. As the four men reach the street, they see a man with a bandage over his ear. However, they see only two men. Kwai's syndicate decide to wait until the men lead them to the third attacker. The two suspects head towards the countryside as Kwai's syndicate follows.\nThe two men later reach a nature reserve as the third killer shows up. The trio meet their wives, their kids and Kwai's syndicate during a barbecue. After a tense standoff, they explain that they killed Costello's grandchildren because the children had seen their faces. Not wanting to start a shootout in front of the three attackers' wives and children, everyone waits until they have left. A moonlit gun battle ensues, with both sides suffering injuries. The three attackers flee, while Costello and Kwai's syndicate take refuge at a run-down apartment in Hong Kong to treat their wounds. Costello reveals that he is a former assassin and has had a bullet in his head for twenty years, which is affecting his memory.\nShortly after they have tended to their wounds, Kwai receives a phone call from triad boss Fung, who informs him that three of his men need help, and are with an underground non-registered doctor known as \"Old Five\". Fung tells Kwai that his men were attacked by three Chinese men and one white man. The four men realize that Fung ordered the hit on Costello's daughter and her family. They head to the dwelling and kill the three attackers but leave Old Five alive, who telephones Fung reporting what had happened. Fung then contacts Kwai, explaining that Thompson Cheung Chi-shun, Costello's son-in-law, was handing over Fung's financial reports to the police, and that he only ordered his men to kill the parents. Kwai replies that his syndicate has switched their loyalty from Fung to Costello as a matter of honor.\nLater that night, Fung sends more killers to Kwai's refuge in order to eliminate Kwai's syndicate. A gunfight ensues, with the four men emerging victorious. As they escape, Kwai's syndicate lose track of Costello, who is walking through a crowded street, seemingly lost in the night rain. He pulls out the Polaroid pictures that he took of the hitmen earlier, and tries to find them in the crowd. They meet again, but it becomes evident that Costello has a problem with his memory, and has rapidly forgotten who his friends are, but also what he is doing. The hitmen try to explain to Costello that he is seeking revenge for his daughter, but Costello does not recognize her, nor does he understand the concept of revenge. The three men give up in despair, and take him to a beach where they meet Kwai's friend, Big Mama (Michelle Ye), a pregnant woman with a group of children. Kwai gives her a stack of money and ask her to take care of Costello. Kwai's syndicate return to Macau because they lost contact with Kwai's cousin Tony who supplies their ammunition. When they reach the landfill where Tony is living, they find him and his partner dying as they were tortured by Fung and his gang. Soon, a large group of assassins sent by Fung show up and a gunfight ensues. Kwai, Chu and Fat Lok are killed. Costello and Big Mama learn of the shootout during a news report. Later that night Costello has a vision of the 3 Hitman and Irene in the afterlife, implying his daughter died of her injures and also reminding him of his mission for revenge against Fung.\nThe next day, Fung is having tea in a public square surrounded by his subordinates. He sees a beautiful woman (actually is Big Mama) having tea in the same square. As he tries to get her attention, a large group of children come asking him to buy charity stickers. The children place stickers on Fung and his men. Big Mama leaves the square and meets up with Costello, then tells him that the man back in the square with the most number of stickers is Fung. Costello thanks her, makes his way to the square and begins to shoot a great many of the guards as well as Fung as chaos ensues. However, Fung turns out to be wearing a bulletproof vest. His subordinates help him run away from Costello, who gives chase on foot. As Costello walks, he checks the bystanders for stickers, which tips Fung off to the fact that Costello does not actually recognize him, apart from the stickers he is wearing. Fung removes the stickers from his coat, and puts them on the jacket of a subordinate instead. This causes Costello to shoot Fung's subordinate. Fung then removes his coat with all the stickers and runs off.\nCostello picks up the trenchcoat and shoots more subordinates who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head, killing him.

Marimuthu, along with his childhood friends Ayyappan (Hari Vairavan), Sekar (Nitish Veera), Murthy (Maayi Sundar), Appukutty (Appukutty), Subramani (Soori), and Pandi (Ramesh Pandiyan), are kabbadi players who dream of winning a local tournament.\nSekar is a rich, short-tempered rice mill owner and is always captain of the team. Appukutty is a short tea shop owner who often gets heavy scoldings from his old mother-in-law. Subramani is a newlywed man who has only three hobbies: eating thrice as normal, playing kabbadi, and making love. Pandi is a fat local store owner who is the son of an ex-army man. Marimuthu works in a farm and can stay in his house only during holidays. Their kabbadi team, Vennila Kabadi Kuzhu, is infamous for never winning a match in their history. In a subplot, Marimuthu meets and flirts with an unnamed beautiful young lady (Saranya Mohan) who comes visiting to his village's annual festival. They organize a friendly kabbadi match with the neighboring village team for the festival, and Souda Muthu (Kishore), the coach of the state's best kabbadi team, is the chief guest in which an outbreak in the game occurs. They then go to Madurai for a non-detail known match where Souda Muthu is one of the chief conductors and a coach. He tells it is a state-level pre-qualified tournament in which no local teams may participate. As they prepare to leave, they learn that suddenly their district team has forfeited, and hence they join unopposed as Dindigul district team.\nSouda Muthu wants to give a rookie substitute of his team (the Paper Mills team, which has won the last two seasons) into playing seven, but the rest of the team rebel and expel Souda Muthu from coaching them. Then, Souda Muthu separates from his state winning team and starts coaching Vennila. The team progresses through the tournament into the final despite the myriad hurdles and disadvantages, with the help of their coach, who gives them very hard coaching.\nIn the semifinals, the opposite team tries to injure Marimuthu and win the game. They succeed in dislocating his collarbone, and Marimuthu is hospitalized. The rest of team ensures that they win by a very huge margin, including a brutal offence attack. Though the collarbone is relocated, Marimuthu must remain in the hospital for the night.\nThe finals between the teams Vennila and Paper Mills causes high anticipations as one is the defending champion and the other is an unknown rookie. The betting bookie fears that Vennila might win. Hence, they poison Sekar's mind stating that Railways will choose one player from each finalists, and he must prevent Marimuthu from playing in finals to get the job for himself. Sekar attempts to do so minutes before the finals, but the coach and team turn on him, and he is expelled before the match. The whole of the village has come to watch their match, except Marimuthu's mother.\nIn the final, the Vennila team struggles initially but manages to fight back into contention in the second half. As the game ends in a tie, players from each team go up individually against each other as a tiebreaker. Both teams score equal points, and only one upon each side remains. Marimuthu is to be the defense, when the opposite raider (Vijay Sethupathi) has the last raid. The raider attempts to touch Marimuthu by kicking lightly on his chest and coming back, but Marimuthu comes forward and holds his leg, they both fall down, and the raider is prevented from touching the line within the time period. Hence, Marimuthu wins the game for the Vennila team, and they become the first rookie state champions.\nThe scene changes to several months later when Marimuthu's love interest returns to the village festival where she met Marimuthu the previous year, but he is nowhere to be found. It is revealed later that Marimuthu died as his heart stopped due to the sudden shock he received when the opposite player kicked him in his chest and both fell down. However, his friends, despite noticing her search for him, decide not to reveal to her Marimuthu's demise to spare her the anguish.

These modules, which are worn like glasses and suppress real-world body movement, allow the crew to assume various identities and enjoy a variety of adventures. The crew's experiences aboard the ship are broadcast back to Earth as Fox's reality television program Edge of Never: Life on the Phaeton.The pilot picks up approximately six months after the launch of Phaeton. The crew now faces a \"go or no-go\" situation, in that they are fast approaching their last chance to change course back towards Earth. However, their home planet is quickly becoming uninhabitable, with dry land becoming increasingly rare. Scientists estimate that the planet will become completely inhospitable within the next hundred years.

A credits montage reviews the rise of costumed crime-fighters from 1939 to 1977, culminating in a public backlash and passage of an anti-vigilante act. Rorschach, a vigilante detective who operates illegally, discovers that the dead man was Edward Blake, better known as the Comedian, a costumed hero who worked for the government. Suspecting that other vigilantes could be attacked, he warns members of his former team, the Watchmen. Rorschach's former partner Dan Dreiberg (Nite Owl II) believes he is paranoid but relays his concerns to Adrian Veidt (Ozymandias), a crime-fighter turned businessman. Rorschach visits Jon Osterman (Doctor Manhattan), a physicist whose accidental superpowers make him a national security asset, but Osterman is preoccupied with energy research and ignores him.\nAt Blake's funeral, Osterman, Veidt and Dreiberg each recall the Comedian's pessimism in his later years about the Watchmen's mission. After the service, a lone mourner pays his respects. Rorschach tracks down and questions the mourner, former supervillain Edgar Jacobi (Moloch). Jacobi says that Blake had recently broken into his apartment while he was sleeping \u2014 tearful, unmasked and incoherent. Rorschach is astonished, but doubts that Jacobi would tell a lie so bizarre. During a press interview with Osterman, an investigative journalist tells him that several people who had contact with him have developed cancer, including his former girlfriend. As other reporters mob Osterman with questions, he shouts to be left alone. Escaping to Mars, he reflects on his existence as Doctor Manhattan and his regrets at being turned into a weapon. In his absence the Warsaw Pact countries make aggressive moves and Nixon prepares for war.\nVeidt survives an assassination attempt, suggesting that Rorschach's \"mask-killer\" theory is correct. Dreiberg takes in Laurie Jupiter (Silk Spectre II), a second-generation vigilante and estranged friend of Osterman, for protection. Rorschach's investigation of the assassin leads him back to Jacobi. While attempting to question Jacobi again, Rorschach is framed for his murder, arrested, and unmasked as a low-born vagrant. In prison he defends his vigilantism to a psychiatrist, saying that he cannot ignore evil and the people who cause it. Dreiberg and Jupiter, growing nostalgic for their crime-fighting days, put on their costumes and break Rorschach out of prison. Osterman teleports Jupiter to Mars while Dreiberg joins Rorschach's investigation of the Blake murder. Evidence points them to Veidt as the mastermind; they find him at an Antarctic hideout, where he has just overseen activation of Osterman's energy reactors in New York and other world cities. On Mars, Jupiter tries to convince Osterman that humanity is worth saving, and succeeds only when he learns that Jupiter is Blake's illegitimate daughter, a fact so unlikely that it restores his respect for life.\nVeidt admits orchestrating Osterman's exile, staging the assassination, framing Rorschach, and killing Blake who was spying on his activities. He has also executed the final step of his plan: turning the world against Osterman by rigging his reactors to explode, killing 15 million people. Osterman returns with Jupiter to a devastated New York, pieces together what has happened and teleports to Veidt's hideout. After a brief struggle, Veidt shows him that the countries of the world have put aside their rivalries to focus on a common enemy. Realizing the logic of Veidt's plan, the Watchmen agree to keep his secret, with the exception of Rorschach, whom Osterman kills to preserve the new global peace. Osterman departs permanently for another galaxy, Dreiberg rebukes Veidt's moral sacrifice, and Jupiter finally comes to terms with her parentage.

Maria and Andre have a lazy, mentally unstable son, Manuel. Andre also has a half-African son, Jose.  Civil war has broken out and rebel soldiers, many of them child soldiers, are advancing on the area.\nThe French military, while pulling out, makes a final plea for Maria to leave, but she is unyielding in her desire to protect her family's home and ignores the warnings.  Meanwhile, a rebel DJ on the radio urges the rebels on and advocates attacks on emblems of colonialism.  Maria's workers flee for fear of the upcoming conflict.  Maria stubbornly refuses to abandon the plantation and its harvest, which will be ready in five days.  Risking her life and unable to find Andre, she drives to a village to hire men to finish harvesting the coffee. On the way, she is forced to pay off bandits who threaten to kill her at a roadblock. After hiring the workers, she stops at the elementary school and collects Andre's mixed-race son, Jose.  Jose is an upbeat boy of about 12, and we later learn that his mother is the young housekeeper working for Andre's father.\nMeanwhile, Andre is in town meeting with the African mayor, Cherif.  Cherif, seeing that Andre is desperate, takes advantage of the situation and offers to purchase the plantation in exchange for cancelling off Andre's debts.  Cherif requires Andre to get his father to sign over the coffee plantation to him.  Having returned to the plantation, Maria searches for her son Manuel and finds him in bed after midday.  Trying to rouse him, she laments his listlessness and scolds that he is without purpose.  Manuel rises, and after a swim, is intrigued by a noise in the house.  He follows it to two young rebels.

She discovers the wounded rebel hero known as 'The Boxer' in a barn and feeds him.  As night falls, the workers bed down and Maria falls asleep dreaming of an earlier evening.

When under interrogation, his son confesses to 'impure' touching; the pastor has the boy\u2019s hands tied to his bed frame each night.

The baron, who is the lord of the manor, underwrites harvest festivities for the villagers, many of them his farm workers. After his young son is abusively injured by unknown assailant(s), he summarily dismisses Eva for no apparent reason, yet defends the integrity of a farmer whose son in a symbolic act has destroyed the baron's field of cabbages.\nThe schoolteacher's friendship with Eva leads to a visit to her family home during a Christmas break; asking for her hand in marriage, he receives from her taciturn father a reluctant permission to marry, but only after a one-year test-period delay.\nUnexplained harmful events occur.

When he makes it back home, he spots a fire in the upstairs room of the house and alerts Shyama, and they are able to put it out.\nShyama believes there is some supernatural cause at play and urges Ramdas to move to another house. Ramdas, who is against superstition, dismisses her concerns and consults Dr Vinod. Dr Vinod advises him to consult a Vastu shastra expert. The Vastu astrologer visits and assesses the house. After sensing that Ramdas does not believe him, he explains that Vastu is more of a science than superstition, and that he utilises knowledge about air pressure movements, furniture placement, heat and light etc. to remove problems caused by bad placements. He explains away the incidents such as the spontaneous fire being the cause of improperly placed window panes, and conducts his procedures to make the house safer. Though initially skeptical, Ramdas is convinced as he notices the changes in the house's atmosphere after the Vastu ritual is complete.\nThe family's experience at the house improves as the mysterious incidents come to a halt after the vastu ritual. However, one night, Ramdas sees an apparition outside a window and is disturbed. Later, Ramdas plans to take his family to a movie and leaves Gopalan home alone at night. Gopalan is seeing being stalked by a shadowy presence as he moves about the house. Upon investigating a crashing sound upstairs, he is shown being chased by an unseen presence and runs out of the house. He runs into Stalin, who keeps him company until Ramdas returns. Gopalan insists that the house is haunted and decides to go back to his hometown.\nRamdas takes Stalin aside and asks him the history of the house. Stalin admits that the house belonged to the murderer behind the old serial killings, who was also his son. He says he does not want to believe in superstition, but he insists that he had confirmed his son's death. Later, Ramdas is called by the villagers to attend a patient who is sick. On the way back, he feels like he is being chased by an unknown presence, and sees various bad omens. Thoroughly disturbed, Ramdas takes a day off. He confides in his colleague Dr. Sandeep, who helps him look for a new house. Later, the family dog is found with his neck sliced, in the same way as the murder victims many years ago. Ramdas finds a new house to rent, and is told that he will need to wait a couple of weeks before he can move in.\nRamdas gets a call from ACP Saju Paul who warns him that there have been strange attacks in the area near his house. Ramdas and his family continue to be terrorized by strange incidents. One night, the villagers bring an injured child to Ramdas's house, but he is unable to save her in time. The child has a deep cut in her neck, who Ramdas notices is similar to the one on the serial killer's victims. Next day, Ramdas is visited by a villager who reports that there have been new cases of attacks similar to the night before, and points out the similarity to the old killer's Modus operandi. Ramdas reports his suspicion to Saju Paul who dismisses it, insisting they confirmed the death of the previous killer. The police nevertheless hire Dr Vinod to look into the psychology of the killer. Dr Vinod after investigating confirms that the handprints of the new killer is different from the previous killer, and concludes that the killer is a copycat killer who wants to take over the role of the previous killer. He also advises Ramdas that his family may be in danger and to move from the house. The police begin a manhunt for the killer.\nThe night before they move to another house, Ramdas is called to the hospital. He advises Shyama to invite Stalin over for safety. Shyama is seen being stalked by a mysterious presence in the house. She goes over to Stalin's house, only to find Stalin stabbed to death. Shyama gathers the kids and calls Ramdas, who requests the police to go rescue Shyama. Saju Paul picks up Shyama and the kids to take them to a safe house, but are stopped on the road by the killer. The killer defeats the police but Shyama gets away and runs to the forest with the kids. After not hearing from them for some time, Ramdas drives over to the house. Meanwhile, Shyama is attacked and falls unconscious and the children are chased by the killer. One child makes it safely back to the road and is rescued by Ramdas. Ramdas goes in search of the others, and rescues his other daughter from the killer. He hits the killer over the head with a rock. Ramdas rescues Shyama and the kids and begin driving away, but are stopped by the injured but alive killer. Ramdas finishes him off by running him over with his car.\nThe film ends with Saju calling Ramdas on the phone to inform him that got promoted to Commissioner. When asked if he still lives at Hillview, Ramdas says that he feels very happy in the house now that the danger is gone, and he plans to stay there.

The woman he approaches tells him to use the money to \"buy something nice for your mother.\"  An upset David picks up bricks and starts throwing them at cars until he is arrested.  When the priest picks him up at the police station he asks him why he did it.  David responds \"I wanted to see how low I could go.\"\nThe priest finds the unopened letter from Amy and reads it.  In it Amy states that, while she is flattered by the proposition of having David lose his virginity to her, she feels like she cannot do it.  She continues by writing she hopes he gets better soon, and she's sure that when he does she'll find a nice girl who loves him.  The Priest knows what Amy does not, the cancer is spreading and \"getting better\" is not a possibility.\nLater that night the Priest wakes David up and takes him via motorcycle to see a prostitute.

Jerry considers the idea too dangerous, as many wizards have gone on the quest and never returned.\nLater, Alex is caught trying to use magic to get away from her family by her mother, leading to an argument which results in her mother grounding her for two months and taking away her magic privileges. In a fit of rage, Alex wishes that her parents had never met. A smuggled wand and spell book, which Alex was holding at the time, grant her wish and as a result creates an alternate reality where Jerry and Theresa do not remember their kids and do not know each other.\nThe kids attempt to get the spell book from Jerry, but he catches them. In this alternate reality, since he never met and married Theresa, he still has his powers and is shown to have a care-free-like attitude. Justin asks him what would happen if a wizard wished that his or her parents never met; Jerry explains they would gradually forget their past before disappearing forever. He further says they only have 48 hours to reverse the spell, causing Alex and Justin to panic, and that it would take a miracle to fix it, leading Justin to mention the Stone of Dreams, which Jerry says would also work too and he jokingly tells them they should go and find it.\nJustin and Alex set off to find the Stone of Dreams, guided by Archie. Meanwhile, Max stays at the resort to watch their parents; being the youngest child, Max begins losing his memory. Realizing that something is wrong, Max tells Jerry that Alex and Justin have gone to find the Stone of Dreams, having taken his suggestion seriously, and asks him to help him find them. Jerry is shocked by this, knowing how incredibly dangerous the journey is, but agrees to help. They are joined by Theresa, who believes them to simply be treasure hunting.\nEventually, Alex and Justin succeed in finding the Stone of Dreams, but Giselle steals the Stone. Theresa, Max and Jerry meet up with them and the kids tell Theresa and Jerry their story. Theresa doesn't believe them, believing she would not forget her children. Jerry mentions that if one of the kids was a full wizard, they might be able to cast a spell to reverse it. Max finally loses all of his memories and is sucked into a vortex of non-existence. Theresa remembers him at the last minute, realizing that they were telling the truth. Jerry transports Alex and Justin to an ancient battlefield to have a contest. He explains the contest's rules: they will only be allowed to use spells involving the four classic elements, and the winner will become a full wizard, while the loser will permanently lose their powers. Alex and Justin engage in what turns out to be an intense battle, with Alex narrowly winning it. In a state of worry, Alex turns to Justin for help. However, by now Justin has lost all of his memories; Alex tells him that even though they pick on each other, she looks up to him and begs Justin to not leave her alone. Justin tells her that he'd never leave her and that even though he doesn't know her, he believes her and wants to help, but he is quickly sucked into the vortex.\nMeanwhile, Theresa returns to the resort and notices Giselle in human form with the Stone of Dreams on her necklace. After Giselle admits to using him to get the Stone, Archie manages to take the Stone from her. He uses it to turn her back into a parrot before giving it to Theresa.

Her tyrannical brother, Amir Khan, wants Munis to prepare for a visiting suitor and demands that she cook dinner for them. When she scoffs at the idea, he gets angry, and threatens that if she leaves the house he will break her legs.Protests fill the street. People are chanting \"Durood bar Mosaddegh, marg bar Englis\" (\"Long live Mosaddegh, Death to Britain\"). A second woman, the religiously observant Faezeh (Pegah Ferydoni), joins Munis and they discuss the protests. Faezeh calls the protestors \"a bunch of ne'r do wells\". Munis suggests that they themselves should be outside protesting. Faezeh, who secretly longs to marry Munis' brother, asks if it is true that he will marry someone else. Munis nods her head, yes.\nA prostitute, Zarin (Orsi Toth), puts on makeup. A male client gets up and dresses. As Zarin washes her face, a brothel madam is calling out her name. Zarin curls into a corner and begins to sob, as the madam continues to yell that there is another customer. Another man appears in Zarin's room. Surrealistically, in Zarin's point-of-view, he appears to be \"faceless.\"  Zarin rushes out of the brothel, the madam calling after her.\nIn the next sequence, a wealthy 50-year-old woman named Fakhri (Arita Shahrzad), arrives at a military event where her husband Sadr, a general, is being honored. They get into a marital dispute about another officer, an old flame, Abbas (Bijan Daneshmand) who has returned to Tehran and with whom she has been seen talking. Sadr tells Fakhri she is aging and that if she is unable to satisfy him sexually, he'll get another wife. Crying, she says she is tired of him and leaves.Faezeh and Munis are in the garden of Munis' home, gossiping about the woman that Munis' brother is planning to marry. It is suggested that the fiancee may not even be a virgin. Munis' brother shows up and they get into another argument.\nZarin the prostitute is at a bath house. She is wearing a long (a traditional Iranian piece of cloth used to cover the body in a public bath). A female dallak (a person whose job is to help people wash themselves in a public bath) offers to aid her but she refuses. When Zarin opens the robe to bathe, her gaunt body and protruding ribs are revealed. She proceeds to scrub her body vigorously, so hard that her skin becomes raw and bleeds.Faezeh and Amir Khan find Munis, apparently dead, in the street. She seems to have jumped from the roof while they were getting ready, after Amir unplugs her only connection to the outside world, the radio. On discovering her body, Amir curses her for disgracing him and buries her in the garden as Faezeh looks on.A  group of women in black chadors are mourning. Zarin, in a white flowered chador, walks by, scowling. She continues walking until she comes to a group of men in sujud during prayer. She defiantly stands in front of them until they rise. She then scampers away into the night. Zarin walks until daybreak onto a dirt road, and the rivulet from the beginning of the film appears again. She walks into the river, leaving her chador behind.\nThe military wife, Fakhri, arrives at a restaurant where her old flame, Abbas, is having a sociopolitical discussion with a group of artists. When they are alone, the young man recites some poetry to her. He tells her she seems sad, upon which she reveals that she has decided to leave her husband, Sadr. In the next scene she is being driven along the dirt road. She steps out of the luxury car and arrives at the gate. A man (the same one who was seen stroking Zarin the prostitute) opens the door. He says that he has been waiting for her. He takes Fakhri to a beautiful, quaint villa house, a mystical retreat which she buys. The interior, while luxurious, is filled with dust. Fakhri examines the house. There are books and instruments, but the place is covered in cobwebs. She walks into the garden and looks into a river, where she sees Zarin lying unconscious. Fakhri calls the man for help and he carries Zarin into the house.\nFaezeh is with an old woman with divine powers whom Faezeh has approached to cast a love spell on Amir Khan. While in Amir Khan's house following the seer's instructions, in a magical realist trope, Faezeh hears Munis' voice beckoning from the ground. Munis tells Faezeh that she can no longer breathe, and Faezeh digs her out of the ground. Munis then walks into the howz and immerses herself in the water.\nMunis, who was a virtual prisoner in the house even when controlled by her tyrannical brother, goes out to a caf\u00e9 to listen to the radio, Faezeh following her. Noticing two men gazing at her, Faezeh quickly walks away. The men follow Faezeh. Munis walks out to find Faezeh curled up into a ball and crying after she has been raped, and takes her to the garden. Walking through the trees, Faezeh prays to God to forgive her \"sin\". She follows some singing and arrives at the cobweb house, where she finds the military wife. She tells her that she has lost her way and asks for water. She then sees Zarin, the prostitute, lying on a bed.\nThe next sequence shifts to a street in Tehran. Munis begins a second fantasy life as an independent woman working with an underground Communist group. She becomes infatuated with a young man who is telling people to band together and fight injustice. He shouts, \"Long live freedom!\" as he scampers away to avoid authorities. Munis asks if he is a member of the Tudeh Party. As he leaves, he gives her a pamphlet, saying he hopes to see her again. A crowd is in the street shouting the same slogans as before. The crowd is wearing white, and Munis, now standing among them, is wearing a black chador. She says that this time, she is here, \"Not only to look, but to see. Not only to be, but to do.\"\nFaezeh is praying. Noticing the gardener outside her window, she rushes to close it, darkening the room. Flash to a dark dreamscape where Munis is calling Faezeh's name. In this surreal sequence filled with abstract voices and music, she watches herself lying on the ground helpless, as the two men rape her. Faezeh awakes at Fakhri's cottage of refuge, in a bed next to Zarin's. Faezeh walks out of the house without her requisite chador, her long hair flowing down to her shoulders. She arrives in a fantastic field of red flowers.\nA meeting occurs among members of the Tudeh Party, including the young man Munis met earlier. An announcement is made that the British government has declared Mosaddegh's government illegal and plans to stage a coup d'etat. That night, they distribute flyers under doors. During the day, people continue to protest. A man is speaking on a megaphone, claiming the Shah has run away, but the danger of a coup is still imminent.\nWe return to Fakhri's mystical house of refuge, where Faezeh and Zarin are recuperating. Fakhri announces she wants to \"open the garden doors\" and have a party. Faezeh likes the idea, but Zarin doesn't. Later that night, a tree mysteriously falls through one of the windows. Zarin is lying in some greenery outside, scowling. Munis' narration: \"The garden is turning. Under this great weight, it seems sick. Now, there is no way back, and no peace.\"\nA different group of protesters, shouting out, \"Javid Shah\" (\"Long live the Shah\") collide with Mossadegh's supporters. Gunshots ring out. Munis is seen among Mossadegh's supporters. She no longer wears a chador.\nThe gardener walks into the house, carrying Zarin, who has fallen ill again. Fakhri tells him to put her in her bedroom, as she is preparing the living room for the party. The party guests arrive. A man recites (Saadi) poetry. People drink, \"to the health of the Shah's rule.\" Amir Khaan arrives and witnesses Faezeh tending to Zarin, the prostitute. Amir asks Faezeh what has happened to her hijab (head covering) and who are these dubious people he thinks she has surrounded herself with. He questions Faezeh's faith, and queries whether or not she still prays. Amir tells Faezeh that he has now come to take her hand and not to worry about his other wife, who will act as a servant to her. Faezeh replies, \"And perhaps when you get tired of me I will serve your third wife\". Faezeh leaves in anger. Police arrive, inquiring about the home's owner. The police search the place, and then later are invited to sit down to a grand dinner. The guests ask the police which dissidents they are searching for (the Tudehs, or Mossadegh's supporters). A guest replies, \"It doesn't matter. Opposition is opposition. We are all Shah-supporters here\".\nThe next scene is a Tudeh marriage gathering, a celebration which may be a front for their covert publishing activities. Munis is in a back room where a political discussion is ongoing. One of the Tudehs has been taken by the police and they are discussing whether he will talk under torture.\nAt the garden party, a soldier is praising his country to a foreign guest. Her fiance (Fakhri's old flame) thanks Fakhri and asks her to sing. Faezeh sits with Zarin, who is sweating profusely. The police raid the place. Meanwhile, the Tudeh publishing room and wedding party are also raided. The captured Tudeh, a young man, also arrives with the police. He has been battered and bruised. Munis's friend gets in a scuffle with a young soldier, whom he kills with a knife. Munis cries over the soldier's body.\nBack at the garden party, Faezeh, crying, walks into the room where Fakhri is singing. Fakhri realizes that Zarin has died. Fakhri quietly makes her way to Zarin, touches her forehead, and weeps over her body. Munis narrates \"Death is not difficult. It is imagining it that is difficult. It seems that what we were all looking for, was finding a new shape, a new way towards freedom.\" Munis falls from the rooftop in slow motion once again. There is no mistaking that the party is a last hurrah for a kind of social and political freedom that is now long gone.", "tmdb_id": 44159}, "18305011": {"title": "Wonder Woman (2009 film)", "plot": "In ancient times, the Amazons, a fierce race of warrior women, led by their Queen, Hippolyta, battle Ares, the god of war, and his army.

Instead, Hera bounds his powers with magic bracers. They deprive him of his ability to draw power from the violence and death he can instigate. In compensation for their years of servitude to Ares, the Amazons are granted the island of Themyscira, where they remain eternally youthful and isolated from Man, holding Ares prisoner for all eternity. Hippolyta is also granted a daughter, Princess Diana, whom she shapes from the sand of the Themyscirian seashore and gives life with her own blood.\nOver a millennium later, Diana is unsatisfied with her life on Themyscira and longs to explore the outside world. An American fighter pilot, Colonel Steve Trevor, is shot down in a dogfight and crash-lands his YF-23 fighter jet on the island. He then meets Diana, starting a fight in which he is defeated and taken to the Amazons. After interrogating him with the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy and as such, their tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but her mother argues that she hasn't enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world. Diana is instead assigned to guard Ares' cell; her bookish but kind-hearted best friend Alexa offers to cover for her. Defying her mother, Diana covers her face with a helmet and participates in contests of strength, ultimately winning the right to escort Trevor home.\nIn the meantime, the Amazon Persephone, seduced by Ares, kills Alexa and releases him. Diana brings Trevor in his repaired and now invisible jet to New York City, where he volunteers to help Diana capture Ares. An investigation uncovers a pattern of violence created by Ares' presence. The pair goes out to a bar and, after some heavy drinking, Trevor makes a pass at Diana. They argue outside, but are attacked by the demigod Deimos. Diana subdues Deimos, who kills himself to avoid interrogation. His death leads Diana and Steve to a concealed gateway to the underworld guarded by members of a still-extant ancient cult of Ares.\nOnce they have arrived, Diana attempts to take Ares down, but he summons harpies that attack her, prompting Trevor to save her. Meanwhile, Ares performs a sacrificial ritual that opens a gate to the Underworld, where he persuades his uncle Hades to remove the bracers. Hades agrees, but does not tell his nephew that the ultimate cost of removing them would be his own death in combat. Later, Diana wakes up in a hospital, furious that Trevor saved her instead of stopping Ares. Trevor defends his actions, revealing how much he cares about her in the process.\nAres and his dark army attack Washington, D.C.; Trevor and Diana arrive to battle him and are soon joined by the Amazons. Ares manages to summon the Amazons long dead from the Underworld to fight their own sisters, but Alexa, a member of the undead host, reveals to her sister Artemis a chant which nullifies Ares's control. The undead then turn on Ares, but are destroyed by his powers; before passing on, Alexa makes peace with her older sister. Hippolyta kills Persephone in combat. With her dying breath, Persephone declares that by shutting the Amazons away from the world of Man, Hippolyta has denied them the happiness that comes with love and a family.\nMeanwhile, Ares' influence reaches the President of the United States, who orders a nuclear missile against Themyscira, assuming the island is the source of the attack on Washington. This act of supreme aggression increases Ares's power, but Trevor takes the invisible jet and shoots down the missile just before it hits the island. After taking a brutal beating at Ares' hands, Diana finally outmaneuvers and beheads him. Trevor arrives back at the scene, Diana finally accepts him, and the two share a kiss. Ares is later condemned to the underworld to attend Hades as a slave.\nOn Themyscira, in memory of Alexa, Artemis takes up reading.

As the town prepares for its annual celebration of this event, a wyvern, a fierce winged beast similar in appearance to a dragon, is released by the melting of the ice caps. A fisherman alone on the shore of a lake nearby, cuts himself while cleaning a fish, casually washes his injury over the water, and as the blood hits the lake the wyvern attacks.\nMeanwhile, in town, ice trucker Jake Suttner, acts as a handyman, fixing the steps of the town cafe and gathering place. Jake had an accident with his truck nearby a few months prior, in which his brother was killed. Jake had relatively minor injuries, and he's waiting in Beaver Mills for his insurance claim to be settled. Owner and waitress at the restaurant, Claire, is clearly attracted to Jake, which town doctor, David, notices because he's attracted to Claire. David doesn't understand, doctor or not, Claire has no romantic interest in him.\nIn the restaurant we also meet Edna and Farley. Edna is an older woman mourning the loss of her best friend, Maggie, who died about a year ago, and this takes the form of denial; Edna behaves as if Maggie is still alive and interacts with her. Claire, Farley and the others in town humor her, and in fact when Claire clears away Edna and Maggie's breakfast plates, which she insists are on the house, she walks the plates right over to Farley for him to have Maggie's obviously uneaten food, you get the impression this is their daily routine. Farley is just a guy in town, no explanation really of who he is and what he does; he seems to be the town's buffoon.\nAfter Jake goes to an RV he's using as a temporary home, he finds David there waiting for him, under the pretext of treating Jake's hand injury, but in reality he wants to gauge Jake's interest in Claire, saying after Jake leaves, he \u2013David- will still be there. Jake says he looks at Claire only because she's an attractive woman, leaving David believing Jake isn't a threat. Unfortunately while en route to another house call after leaving Jake, David stops to answer nature's call, and the wyvern attacks, pulling him out of his vehicle.\nThe next morning, Sheriff Dawson and Jake are having a conversation at about 5AM outside Claire's restaurant, waiting for her to open, and hear gunshots. They decide to investigate and find Haas, an older man described affectionately as a \u2018hillbilly\u2019 by Claire, talking wildly about being attacked by the wyvern. They don't believe him at first, thinking he's just going on too little sleep, but Jake sees a bloody arm lying nearby and identifies it as David's. The three men head back to town, and Dawson calls ahead to Claire while they drive to ask her to have the townspeople gather, telling her only that David is missing and may have been injured. He asks Deputy Susie to go out to the arm's location to investigate. After they arrive in town, they explain Doc is missing and things don't look good for him.  While he's talking, Susie comes in, holding the arm, which horrifies Claire and the others present, Dawson reprimands her, telling her to put it in the cooler at their office. Dawson advises them all to be careful, they obviously have a predator loose in the area, but then has to leave to investigate another incident.\nWhile this happens, the Colonel, an older military man, has had a couple of odd things happen at home, like his dog disappearing and a moose's head being dropped into his hot tub. He sees the wyvern at home and again while going to town to warn the citizens; but they don't believe him.  He asks Vinyl Hampton, who runs the town's radio station, to broadcast an emergency warning, but she refuses, saying she cannot as she answers to a higher authority. The Colonel leaves in a huff.\nDawson has told Deputy Susie to keep an eye on town, so she's there watching the goings on at the solstice festival. He gets to the location he was called to, finds the owner and some animals dead in a barn, but slips on the blood as he turns to leave and hits his head, knocking him unconscious.  In town, Vinyl sees the wyvern from her window, and tries to make an emergency broadcast, but is stopped when the creature rips out her antenna.\nSheriff Dawson comes to and calls Susie, tells her to stop the festival, get everyone home.  She starts making this announcement to the small crowd using a megaphone, and is puzzled when they all look at her with some confusion. She doesn't see the wyvern flying up behind her, and it savagely takes her life, the megaphone falling to the ground in a puddle of blood.  Several others ae killed, while some, like Haas, Vinyl, Farley, and Edna take refuge in the caf\u00e9.\nWhile all this is going on in town, Jake and Claire have tracked the wyvern to a strange mound  in the forest, and run into the Colonel after, who has discovered the interstate which brings people in and out of town is full of cars, trucks, and RV's, crashed and attacked by the wyvern, intent on keeping the town secluded. They decide to go back to Beaver Mills, and don't see a badly wounded David on the far side of what is truly a nest, as he is able to look in and see three large, odd, dark orange eggs. Just then the wyvern flies overhead and envelopes the doctor.\nBack in Beaver Mills, Sheriff Dawson arrives to see the megaphone and blood that was his deputy in the road, and is then killed by the wyvern as those in the caf\u00e9 yell warnings to him. When Claire, Jake, and the Colonel arrive, and everyone takes stock, some go elsewhere in town to get supplies, and while going back to the  caf\u00e9 Farley is scraped across his chest with the beast's tail, causing a bloody injury, and is helped into the building.  Jake and Claire talk while everyone's trying to rest, and he tells her he believes it was his fault his brother died in the accident. He says that his brother was sick and so all the driving for a few days was on Jake, rather than resting or turning back, he insisted on continuing, even though they really didn't need the money.\nThe wyvern brings David, still alive, and drops him in the middle of town as bait to draw people out of the cafe. David screams for help, bloody and in pain.  Jake goes to rescue him, and Farley distracts the wyvern to save the two men, but is killed himself. David tells the group the wyvern has eggs, then dies right after of his injuries. Claire, Jake, Haas, Vinyl, and the Colonel decide to electrify the nest with some of the items the beast has used to construct it and kill the wyvern. They do succeed somewhat, but the creature kills Haas and escapes after it is shocked and flies off. The Colonel immediately starts shooting the eggs, but Jakes stops him, says they could be bait.\nThe survivors drive away, but stop when they see what looks like brand new truck tractor on the side of the road, Jake's claim fulfilled. Jake comes up with a plan to kill the wyvern, saying he needs Doc's GPS and the egg strapped into the truck. He drives off, alone, and as the GPS tells him he's getting closer to \u2018his destination\u2019 the wyvern appears and attacks the vehicle. As the truck reaches its destination the wyvern is on the front, covering the hood, and Jake bails out as the tractor sails off a cliff, and explodes.\nEveryone is waiting for Jake to appear at Claire's caf\u00e9, as the sky gets slightly darker.

But they encounter a series of small but strange incidents (such as milk getting spoiled), which are regarded as inauspicious by his family but shrugged off by an excited Manohar. The elevator in the apartment works for everyone in the building except Manohar, which bothers him.\nThe women in the family get hooked on a new TV show Yavarum Nalam (Everyone Is Well, or Sab Khairiyat in Hindi). The show is about a family eerily similar to Manohar's who have also just moved into a new house as they have. As the serial unfolds, Manohar notices that the incidents that happen in the serial reflect what is happening to his family. He notices that his camera takes distorted pictures of him while he is in the apartment but not while he is outside the apartment. Things like his sister graduating, his wife getting pregnant, and later suffering a miscarriage are all also shown in the serial. Priya is saved by their longtime family friend and doctor, Dr. Shinde/Dr. Balu. The rest of the family remains oblivious to the similarities, and Manohar prefers it that way to avoid panic.\nThings take a turn for the worse in the serial, and Manohar becomes terrified that the same might happen to his family. He now wants to know who is behind the making of the TV show. He goes to the production company of the serial and asks about the serial Yavarum Nalam/ Sab Khairiyat. To Manohar's horror, he finds out that Yavarum Nalam/ Sab Khairiyat is a different TV reality show and realizes that the serial appears only in his house, every day at 1 p.m. \nOne day Manohar finds their blind neighbour's dog trying to find something in the sand. Manohar stops the dog and takes it to its owner. Later that night, he asks his wife about the latest episode of the serial. She reveals the story to him of the neighbour's dog digging something, and the serial finishes for the day.\nManohar then wakes up at midnight and digs the ground on a rainy night, finding a diary with photographs pasted of the same family coming in the serial. However, there was also a picture of another guy he hadn't seen in the serial in the photos. He then unravels a terrifying secret: the apartment they live in shared their address with a house where a family of eight (similar to Manohar's family) was butchered back in 1977. It was the family of a TV news anchor named Chitra. On the day of Chitra's engagement, an ardent fan, Sairam Shinde, of Chitra, wanted to stop the engagement because he loved her dearly and said to them that if he did not get Chitra, then he would kill everyone without leaving a piece of them. But, he fails in convincing them. So, in sadness, he committed suicide the very next day. It was revealed that all members of Chitra's family were murdered with a hammer on the same day as Sriram's death. The blame rested on the lunatic brother in the family, as he had been seen with the hammer last. The police officer investigating the case also committed suicide by hanging himself in the same house.\nManohar and his policeman friend Shiva meet the mentally disturbed brother Senthil/Ashok (Hindi version), who apparently goes crazy after seeing a TV show in an asylum. They then meet Chitra's former fianc\u00e9 Ramchandar, who tried to plead for Senthil's/ Ashok's innocence because he got covered in blood while he hugged the bodies of his family. After researching one night, Manohar has a nightmare of the 13B murderer climbing the stairs to kill his family. When Manohar tries to climb the stairs, he always ends up on the 2nd floor. Suddenly, Manohar wakes up from sleep, and he realises that the events that took place, from digging the diary of photographs to the climbing the stairs, are actually happening in his dream. He goes to the hall and witnesses the climax of Yavarum Nalam when they are showing the murderer's identity: Manohar's face is shown as the killer.\nNot wanting to risk his family's life, he tells Dr. Balu/Dr. Shinde to book tickets and send his family members somewhere without telling him so that they would be safe.\nBalu/Shinde arrives at Manohar's home and gives the flight tickets to Manohar's wife. Suddenly, the television starts when he comes home, and he sees Chitra's Spirit.\nThe 13B murderer is revealed to be Dr. Balu/Dr. Shinde. He killed them in the 1970s on behalf of his brother, the spurned fan, and also killed the police officer who caught him red-handed. Manohar kills Dr. Balu.\nThe story ends with Manohar living a normal life with a new dog in the family; the milk is not getting spoiled anymore. They bring Senthil/Ashok home, and the apartment's lift finally works for Manohar. When Manohar uses the lift the next day, he receives a call from Dr. Balu/Dr. Shinde, saying that while the 13B family had haunted the TV, he now haunts Manohar's phone.

Seconds later, that same man rises up and attacks them both.\nTwenty years later, a local professor is trying to catch a train out of Pancevo, Serbia, but finds that all railroads have been closed down as part of a military exercise. While he tries to make a call, a train comes in carrying a deadly biohazard agent monitored by a scientist in a hazmat suit, who asks for permission to pass through. Before he can, a trio of drunken off-duty soldiers emerge and harass the station guard, taking his weapon and inadvertently rupturing the tank, releasing the chemical agent into the atmosphere. All the soldiers and the station guard are infected by the gas, becoming zombies, but the professor manages to escape.\nMeanwhile, INTERPOL Agent Mina Milieus is tasked with transporting a mysterious prisoner from Serbia to Belgrave while under the supervision of Agent Mortimer \u201cMorty\u201d Reyes, an ex-CIA agent and on the verge of retiring, along with his partner, Inspector Dragan \u201cDra\u201d Belic.

Morty assures her that she will be fine, considering this to be the easiest assignment he has ever had.\nThe Chief of Bureau meets with the President and informs him about the accident at the train station in Pancevo. He discloses that the agent in the tank was capable of reanimating dead cells and advises that he not bother with evacuation but contain the incident and let the National Guard deal with the rest.\nBack in Pancevo, a young reporter named Jan is wasting his time at a minor concert, and is eventually convinced by his girlfriend Angela to leave along with her friend, Jovana. At the same time, the professor is trying to escape the growing number of infected.

The Prisoner tells them to shoot the zombies in the head, which proves to be successful, but they are quickly overwhelmed: Petrovic is devoured, and Dra is bitten on the hand. They are forced to take shelter in a nearby abandoned police station with little choice.\nWhile reconnoitering the area, Morty and Dra find the professor, Jan, and the girls and bring them back to the reception. The Prisoner attempts to flirt with Mina, but she rebuffs him, although she is put off by how he knew she was a rookie.

He enters a local TV Station and broadcasts his declaration of the apocalypse to Pancevo, including the station. Realizing the gravity of the situation, Morty decides to activate the generator and find a way out. Dra is unable to come with him and has begun to succumb to infection, resulting in Morty freeing the Prisoner and taking him along. After turning the power on, several zombies break in and nearly kill Morty, but the Prisoner saves him. Dra subsequently dies and reanimates, forcing Mina to shoot him. Jovana, driven insane by the turn of events, breaks down the barricade, allowing herself to be eaten. The professor also chooses death by Morty\u2019s gun, as opposed to being eaten.\nThe group escapes and heads towards the river through the train tunnels.
