His father also disowns him, and the dean of the school suspends his scholarship. Left with no other choice, Adam calls the promoter and accepts the battle.\nAt the event, Adam and Grym go head to head.

While enraged during the fight, Adam gets angry at two other rappers who are talking during the fight, and he and Grym perform an impromptu tag-team battle against them.\nAfterwards, Grym informs Adam that they are no longer friends, because while other battle rappers' cruelty is merely an act, Adam's battle rapping has become an outlet for his actual cruelty. Grym departs, saying he needs to be where he belongs; with his family. Desperate, Adam attempts to call Maya and ask her to marry him, but she lashes out at the ridiculousness of the idea and tells him to stay away from her.\nMegaton \"bodies\" Che during their battle, even bringing his girlfriend out to freestyle about how bad he is at sex.

Unfazed, the bloodied Adam gets back on his feet and calls Megaton out for putting on an aggressive act. Megaton concedes the battle to a triumphant Adam. Afterwards, Adam, now sleeping on a park bench on the Berkeley campus, watches a video of his new widespread fame on his phone and says he's decided what his rap name is, but the film cuts to credits before he can say.

Then he phones his cousin Joe Gargan and tells him to book hotel rooms on Martha's Vineyard for the Boiler Room Girls, who worked for Bobby's presidential campaign. He travels to Chappaquiddick Island, where he meets Gargan and Paul Markham for a sailboat race. After losing, Kennedy goes to a party at a cottage with five friends and six Boiler Room Girls.\nKennedy leaves the party with Mary Jo Kopechne. On the road, they encounter a police officer, who asks if they need help. Kennedy backs up and drives quickly away. He accidentally drives off the Dike Bridge, causing the car to flip over before it submerges into a pond. Kennedy climbs out of the vehicle, and calls out to Kopechne, but receives no response. He sits down and cries, before walking back to the cottage. He summons Gargan and Markham, and they drive quickly to the bridge. Gargan and Markham attempt multiple times to retrieve Kopechne from the overturned vehicle, but are unable to open any of the doors or windows. They insist Kennedy report the incident immediately, but instead, he gets in a rowing boat, and Gargan and Markham row him to Edgartown, where they go their separate ways.\nKennedy walks past the phone booth outside his hotel and up to his room and gets undressed. He takes a bath, gets dressed, and combs his hair. He goes down to the phone and calls his father Joseph P. Kennedy Sr. for advice. His partially-paralyzed father says one word: \"alibi\". Kennedy sits on the steps outside his room. He asks the night porter the time, which is 2.25 a.m. Kennedy claims he is having trouble sleeping, but he goes to sleep without contacting the police.\nThe next morning, the overturned vehicle is discovered by father-and-son fishermen, who call the police. Police Chief Arena and the fire department recover Kopechne's body from the car, which they find is registered to Kennedy.  Gargan and Markham realize that he has not reported the accident, and insist again that he must. Kennedy goes with Markham to the Edgartown Police Department and commandeers the Chief's office, waiting for his return.\nAfter giving the Chief a statement written by Markham, Kennedy travels to the family compound in Hyannisport, believing he has contained the situation. He is shocked as his father tells him his actions have disgraced the family and is surprised by a damage control team led by Robert McNamara, convened to address the legal (potential charge of manslaughter) and political consequences. First, they make sure the body is not examined again, and that the official record that his licence has expired is changed by a Kennedy-friendly official. Then they craft a strategy to push the court hearing after the current news cycle, dominated by the landing of the first men on the Moon. Kennedy attends Kopechne's funeral wearing a neck brace to gain sympathy, but this ploy backfires in the press.\nKennedy suggests an appeal to the people of Massachusetts on national television, which his damage control team heartily endorses. They use the family's influence to resolve the court case without a trial, where anything he says publicly could be used against him. Kennedy receives the minimum sentence by pleading guilty to leaving the scene of an accident: two months' jail time, which the judge suspends based on Kennedy's character and good standing.\nGargan, who has become increasingly disgusted with Kennedy for not being honest about the facts of the case and attempting to play the victim, attempts to resign.

Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck by personal tragedy when his friend Franklin Pope dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine \"The Phonograph\". To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily electrocutes animals, and secretly works to help the creators of the electric chair, despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is William Kemmler, and newspapers label the event as \"Far Worse Than Hanging\". Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press.\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical AC motor. Edison is increasingly marginalized and J. P. Morgan merges Edison Electric into General Electric. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Samuel Insull presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The fair is abundantly lit, and Westinghouse is successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention (motion pictures) could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.", "tmdb_plot": "Electricity titans Thomas Edison and George Westinghouse compete to create a sustainable system and market it to the American people.", "tmdb_id": "418879", "wiki_id": "51793625"}, {"title": "Custody", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Miriam Besson and Antoine Besson are a recently divorced couple.

Now Ines, an artist trying to cope with unfavourable reviews of her latest exhibition, has accepted Emilie's invitation to accompany her on a short trip to an unknown place in the heart of Europe. The hotel Emilie has chosen for the first few days of her stay is very luxurious, as is the restaurant where she plans to dine; she evasively explains to her sister that she has sold her flat because she wants to go back to studying. During dinner, she agrees to dance with a stranger, to whom she confides that she is convinced Ines is only with her because her career is on the decline, adding that she \"has no more time to lie\". She therefore rejects the man's advances on the grounds that she would like to have an adventure but that this is not possible for her; immediately afterwards she feels very uncomfortable, which she attributes to the champagne she has drunk.\nTheir destination, which Emilie describes as \"the most beautiful place in the world\", turns out to be an estate lost in the woods beyond an unspecified country border, where they are met by an elderly woman, Marina (Charlotte Rampling), who describes herself as Emilie's \"personal companion\". For the unsuspecting Ines, it is the moment of truth: Emilie reveals to her that she has cancer, has been undergoing unsuccessful treatment for three years, and has therefore chosen assisted suicide; the place to which she has taken her is actually an exclusive clinic where patients can spend their last six days in complete peace before taking their own lives by poisoning themselves after a simple ritual. Ines is distraught and cannot accept that Emilie has kept everything from her, but her sister bitterly claims that she did it because it was the only way she could accompany her on her final journey. In fact, during their stay, the two will repeatedly confront each other harshly about their conflicting life choices: Emilie has remained close to her mother, who fell into depression because of her separation from her husband, until her suicide; Ines soon distanced herself from her, accused her of weakness and victimhood, and did not even go to the funeral, building a nice career as an excuse for her constant absence and creating a kind of armour of rationality and self-preservation. At the clinic, the two women not only meet but also the charming Mr Daren (Charles Dance), also terminally ill, a wealthy playboy who is now an old man and organises a party on his last night, and Brian (Mark Stanley), a former footballer who has been paralysed and rendered impotent by a car accident and who, attracted to Emilie, spends a night with her, arousing her anger that he has decided to leave life behind despite his health. Marina also reveals a little about herself, saying that she stayed at the clinic after accompanying her dying husband there two years earlier because she \"couldn't find a reason to leave\". Ines feels a mixture of disgust and attraction for the place and takes some photos with Daren's complicity for personal inspiration, even though she knows it is forbidden by the rules. At the height of another argument with her sister, she decides to leave early, but Marina stops her with a ruse and listens to her outburst, which turns from a blind rage against her mother and sister to a desolate lament for her growing sense of abandonment. Finally ready to face her pain, Ines makes peace with Emilie, who is now dying, shares fond childhood memories with her and prepares her for suicide.\nEverything happens as planned. Emilie confirms that she has voluntarily chosen death and quietly poisons herself in front of Ines, who leaves the clinic. When she says goodbye to Marina, she gives her Emilie's ring - which belonged to her mother - and reveals to her that she knows about the photos she took and asks her to use them according to her conscience.

It faces dwindling attendance, so the church has moved away from its historical focus on Calvinist theology and now serves mostly as a tourist attraction. Toller, a former military chaplain, is struggling with alcoholism and the death of his son Joseph, who was killed in the Iraq War. Toller seeks a deeper spiritual understanding through reading Roman Catholic writers (G. K. Chesterton and Thomas Merton) and mystical books (The Cloud of Unknowing). This leads him to seek support from Abundant Life, the evangelical megachurch in Albany that owns First Reformed.\nHe is approached by Mary, who is seeking counseling for Michael, her radical-environmentalist husband. Michael further challenges Toller's beliefs: he wants Mary to get an abortion, because he does not want to bring a child into a world that will be rendered almost uninhabitable by climate change.\nMary finds a suicide vest belonging to her husband in their garage. Toller takes it, promising to counsel Michael about it. They discuss going to the police, but Toller feels it would worsen Michael's state.

At a meeting in a diner, Balq takes issue with Toller honoring Michael's will, deeming it a political act, and they argue over climate change: Balq dismisses it as \"complicated\", but Toller sees it as a straightforward matter of Christian stewardship.\nExperiencing physical pain, Toller reluctantly sees a doctor, who suspects stomach cancer and schedules some tests. Toller has Michael's laptop computer, which he took after Michael's suicide to prevent the police from discovering his radicalism and making trouble for Mary. He uses it to research Michael's concerns, including the materials on Balq's factory which inspired him to make the explosive vest.

Later, the mother takes ill and is visited by a doctor and nun from a nearby town. They discover she has bulbous growths located below her armpit and, considering her too far gone, they leave.

Albrun meets the parson, who tells her that he came there to bring faith to people like her who have difficult lives.

As he hands Albrun her mother's polished skull, painted with flowers and greenery, he concludes, \"To strengthen the faith of a religious community, it requires all sacrilege be cleansed.\" Albrun takes her mother's skull and places it in a corner of her cottage. She surrounds it with flowers and a candle. When a visiting Swinda notices it, she promptly leaves. In seclusion, Albrun hears voices from the woods, including that of her mother. The strange sounds continue as she masturbates.

One brother of Namme is Muslim guy, the other one is kind of atheist phenomenon and a teacher in single-pupil class, another guy is Christian Orthodox priest who participates in building of church, on the other hand Ali and Namme perform some pagan rituals and heal people with the water which is sacralized by the mystic fish that was inherited to the family by their ancestors, somehow family should hold the role of fishminder and Namme is obliged to follow her father\u2019s path because her brothers totally refused \u201cfather\u2019s icon.\u201d\nDuring this silent-rhythmic and visual acoustic environment director tactically leaves this magical space and shows us urban surroundings and life, also building of weir is infiltrated in this quiet narrative. Because of some technical development for instance the building of weir evokes water pollution and fish becomes sick. Also there is an issue with the puritanity that the Namme isn\u2019t allowed to be in love affairs or this kind of relationships because her and water\u2019s power becomes useless. However she falls in love, power fades away step by step and Namme slowly becomes unable to cure people. She faces the dilemma: private life or sacralized traditions of family that can help people, finally she emancipates from the background and lets the fish go. In one of the latest shot she walks on water and  fades away with the fog and maybe becomes the part of the universe, maybe she continues her private and non-mystic life, that\u2019s on the decision of the audience.", "tmdb_plot": "In the Georgian mountains, a family oversees a healing spring for the local village.

The area near Martinon's home is rocky with steep hills, which are surrounded by a dense forest filled with wildlife. Martinon's daily routine consists of maintaining the land in front of his house, setting traps, tending to his goats and hunting for wolves so that he can trade their skins. Martinon's physical appearance, tall and muscular with shaggy hair and a bushy beard, intimidates those he encounters. \nDuring a visit to the local town, Martinon is collecting a bounty from wolf skin from the mayor.  The mayor haggles with him over the price. The bar owner Severino suggests to Martinon that he should consider marriage and starting a family to pass on his property as his legacy. Martinon considers the suggestion but points out that the conditions of his life in the mountains are no place for children or a wife. On his way out of town Martinon has sex with a local woman, Pascuala. Martinon makes a deal with Pascuala's father, Ubaldo, and pays the father a sum of money for Pascuala.\nMartinon leaves town with Pascuala as his wife. Pascuala adapts to her new home life with ease, but begins showing signs of an unknown illness through consistent coughing. Pascuala also tells Martinon that she is pregnant. Martinon shows no verbal or facial expressions on how he feels about the pregnancy, but begins to create a baby crib. Pascuala's illness worsens, resulting with a difficult pregnancy. Bedridden Pasculua dies while giving birth to a stillborn baby boy, while Martinon is tending to the goats.\nVisibly saddened and frustrated because of the deaths of his wife and son, Martinon breaks the baby crib he created. While attempting to bury their bodies, Martinon burst into a fit of anger and begins knocking down the headstones on the older surrounding graves of the graveyard. Martinon brings the bodies of his wife and the baby boy to Ubaldo, and accuses him of knowing that Pasculua was sick and  pregnant with someone else's child upon joining him. Ubaldo concedes to the accusations, stating that he was afraid that Pascuala's reputation would  be ruined. He'd hoped that once Pascuala had her baby, people would believe that Martinon was the father, since they were living together. Martinon berates Ubaldo for not being a good father and demands his money back. Ulbaldo begs Martinon for time to collect the money. Martinon gives him until the next spring to pay.\nWhen Martinon goes back to Ubaldo to collect his money, rifle in hand, Ubaldo instead of money offers his youngest daughter, Adela, to Martinon. He says Adela will join him, provided that he marry her. Martinon accepts Adela and the next day they are married. After the wedding, Ubaldo apologizes to Adela for the impromptu marriage. He pleads with Adela not to run away, but instead to attempt to adapt to the situation, because should she run away, Martinon would look for her and also come after Ubaldo. Her father then gives Adela a red cloth, later revealed to contain herbs, telling her to use it should her situation become unbearable.\nAdela leaves with Martinon on the journey back to the top of the mountain. The walk is strenuous for Adela, causing Martinon to stop repeatedly to give her water. Adela does not adapt to her new life, which features brutal sex forced upon her and a complete lack of human connection with Martinon, who regards her as a piece of property. One day Martinon informs Adela that he will be gone for trading for four days. Martinon warns Adela to be careful of the wild life in the forest, should she venture outside the abandoned town. While alone for four days, Adela inspects the ruined buildings of the abandoned town and the nearby cemetery, where she notices two open graves. Upon Martinon's return, Adela asks for whom they were intended. Martinon replies that \"they're not graves, just holes\". This response upsets Adela and she begins to walk away when Martinon tells her that Pascuala's death was her father's fault because Ubaldo traded Pascuala knowing she was sick and pregnant. Martinon also tells Adela that Ubaldo did the same trade with her. Adela calls Martinon a liar and walks away.\nLater Martinon observes Adela staring tearfully out into the distance. While looking at herself in the mirror Adela realizes she is pregnant. Though Martinon shows no verbal or facial reaction, he prepares a baby crib and makes breakfast for Adela in the mornings. Martinon also begins to reduce any strenuous activities for Adela. One day while cleaning a wolf skin, Adela becomes frustrated, and resolves to poison Martinon's food with the herbs her father gave her. Martinon unknowingly eats the poisoned foods and soon becomes sick, vomiting daily. Adela appears pleased with herself and decides to run away while Martinon is out hunting. While running down the mountain Adela steps on one of the traps set by Martinon, preventing her from properly running and walking.\nWhen Martinon returns home to find Adela gone he immediately searches the ruined buildings of the town. The next morning he follows Adela's tracks and discovers her passed out under some fallen trees. Martinon takes Adela home to nurse her back to health. While wrapping the unconscious Adela's frost bitten feet Martinon observes Adela having a miscarriage. Adela becomes strong enough to walk around the house. Adela sorrowfully tells Martinon that she lost the baby. Martinon is quiet, as he is already aware. Martinon tells Adela that once she fully recovers, she can return to her family.

Sidney confronts Velouria about him moving away. She attacks Sidney, who hits his head on a mantelpiece. Sidney and Melody subsequently move away together.\nAt the age of twenty-four, Sidney is a successful, albeit alcoholic, writer with two books- Suburban Tragedy and State of Execution- atop The New York Times Best Seller list and his name in contention for a Pulitzer Prize. He suffers from hallucinations, as his head injury left scarring on the left side of his brain. At a book signing, Sidney meets an obsessed fan called Henry Crowe, who quotes Suburban Tragedy and speaks of knowing what must be done. Shortly after, Crowe attempts murder and commits suicide, casting the book in a negative light, leading to a competitor on the list, Francis Bishop, to win the Pulitzer. With his marriage with Melody failing, Sidney has a discreet, ongoing affair with Harold's daughter, Alexandra. Melody informs Sidney that she is pregnant, though she insists that he is honest if he is having an affair, which he denies. He reveals that he purchased their dream house in New Mexico. While Sidney and Melody are at a restaurant, Alexandra confronts them, revealing the affair. Sidney and Melody make their way to their apartment, and while Melody attempts to leave in the elevator, the power goes out, trapping them. Melody suffers an asthma attack and due to not having her inhaler, dies in Sidney's arms in the elevator. Sidney leaves his apartment with the keys inside.\nAt the age of thirty, Sidney has not been seen nor heard from in five years. Downtrodden, he spends his time going from library to library, burning copies of his books. An apparent detective, The Searcher, traces his steps and interviews those who have known him, including librarians, Duane and Johan, who forged identities for him. After making his way to New Mexico and riding on trains with his dog, Sidney is arrested for having an open alcohol container in public. The Searcher bails Sidney out of jail and takes him for breakfast, where he reveals himself to be Francis Bishop, wishing to write a biography about Sidney. Francis takes Sidney to the house in New Mexico, where Francis reveals that the positive influence from Suburban Tragedy dissuaded his son from committing suicide. The writers part ways. Sidney's health takes a turn for the worse from the seizures and effects from alcoholism, putting him in a terminal state in the hospital. Sidney summons Francis, who he gives all his writings to and reveals the secrets about the inspiration for Suburban Tragedy, as well as Judge Newport's perversion.

Later, Joan meets a published alumna female author whose cynical view of opportunities available to female writers disheartens her.\nTwo years later, Joseph has been fired for having an affair with Joan, his marriage is failing, and his first attempt at writing a novel turns out very poorly. Joan, a secretary at a publishing house, observes how the all-male editors dismiss women writers. When Joan criticizes Joseph's work, he threatens to end his relationship with her, claiming she cannot love \"a hack.\" Joan agrees to fix Joseph's novel for him. The work, titled The Walnut, is published and becomes a bestseller. By 1968, Joseph and Joan are married and living in a large seaside home in Connecticut. Joan is hard at work on a novel to be published under Joseph's name, while Joseph supports her by cooking, cleaning, and caring for their first child, David.
