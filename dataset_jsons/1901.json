[{"title": "The Countryman and the Cinematograph", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "A man is sitting in a box at a cinema theatre. The screening starts with the title The Edison Projecting Kinetoscope followed by the intertitle Parisian Danger showing a girl dancing the can-can. The man jumps out of his box and starts imitating her dance. The second intertitle, The Black Diamond Express then appears and the film shows a train rushing towards the camera. The man is so afraid that he jumps back in his loge. The third film, The Country Couple, is then shown and when the spectator sees a couple kissing, he goes back on stage and tears up the screen, revealing the movie projector and projectionist behind it. The projectionist stands up and gives the spectator a beating.", "tmdb_plot": "A satire on the way that audiences unaccustomed to the cinema didn't know how to react to the moving images on a screen - in this film, an unsophisticated (and stereotypical) country yokel is alternately baffled and terrified, in the latter case by the apparent approach of a steam train.", "tmdb_id": "179000", "wiki_id": "65353732"}]
