He allows the female goat inside his van reluctantly, as he doesn't allow females in his van usually, after Arakkal Abu assures he will slaughter it and have it as a barbecue.\nThe decision lands them into a slew of hilarious problems, as the team crashes into a tree, with a coconut falling on the head of Captain Cleetus, leaving him with cognitive slippage.

He reports the mishap to Dude. Shaji Paappan and the team runs into the Dude' henchman they knock out Shaji and capture Abu along with Pinky as hostages. Because Dude believes Abu to be the thief, as he was wearing his traditional cap, similar to Soman's assailants.\nSomewhere else, a veteran left-wing leader named P.P Sasi gets into legal trouble as he foolishly discloses the politically driven murder hits to the public. When the police comes to arrest him, Sasi escapes from them. As Shaji Pappan is worried about Abu, a ransom video sent to the team by Dude's boys, betrays the location of their hideout. Shaji and his friends rush to the place and rescues Abu and Pinky. However, they run into Shameer and in crossways with Dude, who madly opens fire. In the end, Abu and Pinky are captured once again.\nWith a new lead in hand, Shameer apprehends Soman and Hakkim, the right-hand men of P.P Sasi Aassaan, to counter his armed adversaries. Shaji Paappan unwillingly decides to seek help from his elder brother Thomas Paappan whom Shaji hates. As an iron-smith, Thomas Paappan arms the group with rifles to confront Dude and his thugs. The century-old rifles turns out to be useless. But they defeat Dude and save Abu and Pinky.\nRefusing to give up, Dude pulls out his gun and points at Shaji. Thomas arrives and manages to shoot the gun away. Thomas appears to be a poor marksman and runs away from seeing the police beside the gang. Sasi, who was hiding in an empty water tank, is exposed out of his hiding.

Soman, didn't have the intention to hand over the Neelakkoduveli to Dude and switched the herb chest with a decoy trunk filled with dung. As he was getting away with the valuable chest, he runs into an elephant pit, accidentally throwing the chest outside. When Soman came back to his senses, he discovers that Pinky had eaten away the Neelakkoduveli from the popped open chest. The power of the exotic herb might have rendered Pinky auspicious, which might be the reason why the ewe lamb didn't get harmed.\nPappan finally manages to sell off Pinky to a butcher.

Cortland is recruited to join the rebellion against General Lang, who won a civil war against General Hatch.  Hatch explains to Cortland that his father, an important figure to the rebellion, is scheduled to be executed in several months on the anniversary of Lang's victory.  Hatch wants Cortland, an accomplished pilot, to hijack a scientific vessel, retrieve its data, and use it to help Hatch free Cortland's father.  Cortland receives a cybernetic foot and agrees.\nOnboard the Arrowhead, Cortland wakes from suspended animation early and hacks into the vessel's data banks.  He is concerned when this appears to lower the ship's defenses, but Hatch remotely assures him that it will be temporary and perfectly safe.  A dangerous EMI flare-up prevents Cortland from sending the data to Hatch and damages the ship, forcing it to eject all the escape pods.  Cortland escapes in a shuttle, landing near the escape pods on a desert moon.  The ship's AI, RE3F, warns him of a toxic atmosphere but refuses to give further data without a valid login.\nExploring, Cortland finds the body of Arrowhead's security chief, Norman Oleander, and an intact pod with biologist Tarren Hollis.  Cortland brings Hollis back to the shuttle and, after reviving her, uses her biometric data to activate RE3F.  Hollis surmises Cortland is working for Hatch, who she says has been engaging in terrorist attacks; Cortland dismisses her accusations as propaganda.  Hollis, who recognises Cortland as a soldier who served with her father, offers him a fair trial if he accompanies her to a rendezvous point where survivors will be rescued.  Cortland declines.\nCortland rejoins her when RE3F refuses to start the shuttle's engines with Hollis' login.  On the way, a hostile insectoid creature attacks and apparently kills Cortland, causing Hollis to miss the rescue.  A nearby obelisk resurrects Cortland, infecting him with a symbiote and healing all his wounds, including his foot.  Hollis and Cortland drag Oleander's body to the same obelisk, resurrecting him and using his biometric data to unlock all of RE3F's functions.  Hollis convinces Cortland not to leave Oleander behind.  However, when Oleander revives, he begins ranting and turns hostile.  After Oleander shoots Hollis, Cortland kills him and collapses from his own wounds.\nWhen Cortland revives, RE3F tells him he was dead for thirty-four days.  The symbiote has again revived him, but Hollis is gone, apparently dead.  With RE3F's help, Cortland works to restore the shuttle's power and escape the moon in time to rescue his father.  Cortland discovers his symbiote causes him to transform into the insectoid creature during periods of intense stress or pain.  After suffering an uncontrolled transformation, Cortland misses the anniversary.  Resigned, Cortland spends the next three years bonding with RE3F, learning to control his transformation, and surviving on the moon. During this period an insectoid is attacking Cortland's refuge and thanks to RE3F he finds out that the insectoid is based on Oleander\u2019s cells. Cortland sets up a trap and manages to kill Oleander by killing himself. Cortland is revived once again.\nRE3F cannot volunteer information and must be asked questions.  After a chance comment, Cortland learns from RE3F that Hollis survived the fight and possibly escaped the moon.

Cortland set up an expedition to find out information about Hollis destiny and while exploring a deep cave he finds the two original bodies of Oleander and himself merged to a sort of organism deeply embedded in the planet.

She is initially flippant towards her actions during this time, but soon discovers that she caused serious emotional and physical damage, resulting in her losing her job, friends, and boyfriend, as well as potential jail time. Ava's parents (William Sadler and Deborah Rush), sister (Whitney Able), and her sister's fianc\u00e9e Roger (Zachary Booth) are all concerned for her. Her family pushes her into accepting a plea deal that would spare her jail time or commitment in a  facility for troubled ex-possessed people as long as she attended a rehabilitation program for the recently exorcised, as possessions are seen as a real, common phenomena. The program is led by Tony (Wass Stevens), a gruff man that insists that Ava take the program seriously as to do otherwise would just raise the likelihood that the demon would return, as repossessions will frequently happen. Participants will ultimately be tested by wearing a necklace that invites the demon back into their body. If they can pull the necklace off and reject the demon, they graduate since this shows that they are strong enough to deter future possessions.

Sure that he is dead as a result of her, Ava lies to Ben about how she found the watch but ends up spending time with Ben. Lonely and confused as to what exactly caused her to become possessed, Ava agrees to help Hazel's demon return via a ritual, which results in Hazel getting committed. The ritual also leaves a tattoo on her neck, which Tony discovers. He throws her out of the program, as the tattoo makes it easy for the demon to return. Ava's family chooses to commit her but Ava manages to gain a lead on Ben's father via a prostitute. The prostitute is murdered before she can tell Ava anything. She is then recaptured and is put in a car with Roger, who is to take her to the asylum. However instead of taking her to the facility Roger instead tries to kiss her and reveals that he murdered the prostitute in order to keep her from telling anyone that he had visited her. She then discovers that while she did kill Ben's father, he was only in the apartment because he was a hitman that Roger had hired to murder her, as Ava had seen Roger with the prostitute and then joined the two of them for a sexual encounter. Roger drives Ava to Tony's now empty classroom, where he forces her to put on the necklace and bring back the demon, as he believes the two of them had a connection. While she\u2019s possessed, Roger confesses his crimes in front of the facility's security cameras. Ava is able to control the demon and use its abilities to capture Roger.

He simply avoided Kencho and asks his wife not to allow the boy inside their house.\nOn the next day Kencho again comes to the school gate at the Tiffin period and waits for Mini. When the class teacher sees this he comes and beats him because for him he was insulted by Mini's father. Kencho says, \"how can you beat me sir, I am the son of Shree Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi. You will worship him within the school and beat his son outside it?\" The teacher starts laughing and goes inside. Kencho shouts in a challenging voice towards him, \"I shall take admission to this very school and then you will know the result of beating me\". Then Kencho goes to NGO da and tells him that he, too, like his father wants to be an educated man, a lawyer. NGO da becomes very happy and asks him to come to his night school. But Kencho was not willing to read in a night school. Kencho was insistent that he would not read in an ordinary school as his father must had learnt lessons in London or some other big places. Kencho says that he himself had selected a good school for himself that is the school where Mini reads and this was the most famous school in the town. NGO da tried to say how impossible it was but Kencho was insistent and at last NGO da agreed to arrange something to get him admitted there.\nThen the story moved on through a number of twists and sub plots.

His wife Carol suffers extreme depression and rarely gets out of bed while he works in his practice, meeting some clients referred to him by his mentor, Duncan. One client, Felix, apparently suffers from anterograde amnesia, believing that it is still the 80s; another, Erica, talks of her suicidal thoughts, but finds herself unable to commit suicide; and another, Elizabeth Valentine, is a girl who is apparently mute and who reacts with fear to the sound of the train passing by Peter's office, and before she flees, she writes a series of numbers on one of Peter's notepads: 12787.\nElizabeth returns unexpectedly, and Peter finds her looking out of his window to where the train will pass. Again, she is disturbed by the sound of it and begins to choke; she hits the window, leaving a handprint. Peter records her, but she disappears before he can speak to her further. He plays the recording to Duncan, who claims he hears nothing and believes that Peter is hallucinating Elizabeth out of guilt from failing to prevent his daughter's death, pointing out that her initials sound like Evie's name. Later, Peter hallucinates Elizabeth saying that \"we have her\" before turning into Evie and then vanishing, and later, he has a nightmare about Erica, who says she wasn't able to commit suicide because she's already dead. Doing research, Peter discovers that Elizabeth died in 1987, along with all the other clients who have been seeing him. The numbers that Elizabeth wrote on his notepad was a date: July 12, 1987. Perplexed, he calls Duncan and asks to speak with him later, and then has a vision of his deceased patients on the train outside of his window.\nDuncan comes over, and Peter worries about his sanity and questions how Duncan could have referred the patients when all of them have been deceased for decades. He then notices that Duncan doesn't appear in a mirror, and he, too, is a ghost. Now fully disturbed, Peter uses a map to discover that all the deceased patients lived along a train line leading to his hometown, False Creek. He travels there alone and meets with his father, William, a retired cop. Going to the bar, Peter meets with a childhood friend, Barry, and tells him that there is a weight on his conscience that he wants lifted. Barry alludes to a horrifying event that happened in their youth that they promised to keep a secret, and tells Peter to leave him out of any confession.\nWhen the two were teenagers, Barry led Peter to a secret location that his brother mentioned, where couples would apparently have sex in their cars. The two left their bikes at the side of the train tracks and went to go spy on a couple in a car. Peter panics when he hears a train whistle, and he raced to move their bikes; in the process, he saw what he thought was Barry, running ahead of him. However, neither got there in time, and the train was violently derailed, killing 47 of the passengers on board. Peter saw several of the victims, all of whom would be his deceased future clients. He is then terrorized by the ghosts of Evie, Felix, and Elizabeth.\nThe next morning, Barry drives to the train tracks, and Peter goes to the police station. There, he meets Barbara, a constable, and confesses the incident to her. She tells him that he will likely face no charges, as it was an accident that happened when he was a teenager, and the statute of limitations has expired. Peter also discovers that she was the daughter of Erica. He apologizes, and Barbara tells him that her mother was the only local killed in the accident, and that William was kind to her at the funeral, inspiring her to become a police officer.\nBarbara investigates the accident while Peter tries and fails to burn his newspaper clipping of the accident. He is drawn to a closet, where the ghost of Elizabeth briefly strangles him. Duncan then appears, telling him that there was no way that bicycles lying against the tracks would have derailed the train, and that there was more to the accident. He also urges Peter to remember exactly what distracted him on the day of Evie's death. Peter recalls looking into a toy shop window at a railroad set, specifically, a model of a switch tower. The next morning, he investigates the switch tower beside the tracks and finds Barry, who has committed suicide, inside. When the police arrive, Peter confesses to Barbara that Barry was there the night of the accident, but he intentionally left him out of the confession. Later, he tells her about his hallucinations since Evie's death. When she does not believe him, he tells her details about Erica that he wouldn't otherwise know. Rattled, she orders him to leave.\nA police officer finds an old and encrusted pin lying on the floor of the switch house and gives it to Barbara, who discovers that it's the insignia of Elizabeth's high school. As Peter once more returns to the scene of the accident, she pays a visit to William and tells him that during her investigation, she has discovered that the road he apparently drove to get to the aftermath of the crash was blocked off, and he would have only been able to drive there if his car had already been on the right side of the tracks, as the crossing was blocked by the derailment. Furthermore, Elizabeth was the only victim with a cause of death that the coroners deemed inconclusive. Meanwhile, Peter sees Elizabeth's ghost once more, and, taking the same path he did as the night of the accident, he realizes that it was not Barry he saw running ahead of him, but Elizabeth. Going up to the switch house, he suddenly remembers all of the night: he looked through the windows of the house to see his father (William) strangling Elizabeth. In her struggle to survive, she left a handprint on the window (the same one he saw earlier), and she also accidentally pulled the lever of the track points, leading it to derail and kill the passengers. Afterwards, William placed her body at the scene of the crash inside a derailed carriage.\nBarbara asserts to William that she knows Elizabeth was not a victim of the crash, and she believes that Peter saw something that night that William wanted covered up. William knocks her unconscious and puts her in the trunk of her police car. Peter returns and tells William that he knows the truth: the couple that Peter and Barry saw in the car was really William raping Elizabeth, and he saw William kill her; he asks William if Elizabeth was his only victim. William pulls a gun on him and tells him to get in the police car in the garage. Inside, Peter hears Barbara regain consciousness while in the car boot, and after a brief struggle, William knocks him unconscious as well.\nThe next morning, William drives out with both Peter and Barbara restrained in the car. A gun is on the passenger seat. However, the ghost of Elizabeth appears in the road and in the car, startling William and making him lose control of the car. In the process, Peter is thrown out of the backseat of the car and ends up a safe distance away, with the gun. William ends up on the train tracks, the engine dead and the doors locked as a train begins to approach. He tries and fails to escape and yells to Peter for help. Peter attempts to shoot out a window so William can escape, but only succeeds when the train is extremely close. The trunk opens and Barbara manages to climb out, and Peter pushes her off the tracks to safety. William, held back by Elizabeth's ghost, is crushed by the train. As Peter and Barbara stand on the side of the tracks, Peter can see the ghosts of the victims on the train, and sees a tranquil Elizabeth turn and depart.\nLater, Peter is on the beach with the ghost of Evie, who gets up and walks into the ocean, finally moving on and at peace.

They demand that Alfie be sacked. Deputy Head and Alfie's father Martin Wickers (Harry Enfield), headmaster Shaquille Fraser (Mathew Horne) and teacher and Alfie's girlfriend Rosie Gulliver (Sarah Solemani) insist that Alfie is given another chance and that they conduct a surprise visit to his classroom. Meanwhile, Mitchell has been attempting to tattoo 'Class K Forever' onto Alfie's back, but Alfie passes out from pain before Mitchell can get any further than the letters 'CLA'. The classroom visit ends with the children's parents refusing to pay for the Las Vegas trip, after Susan, the overbearing mother of Class K student Joe (Ethan Lawrence) interrupted their \"class wars\" and accidentally shot the class hamster under her skirt. Alfie says he will pay for the trip, but upon realising the cost of this, decides on a trip to Cornwall. Joe is concerned his mother will not let him go on the trip, but Alfie creates a fake trip itinerary to fool the parents into thinking the trip is educational. Alfie also informs his class that his best friend from school, Atticus Hoye (Jeremy Irvine), is hosting a house party in Cornwall.\nSusan, concerned about what the trip will involve, comes with the group to Cornwall, and implements Alfie's fake itinerary, starting with a trip to the Eden Project. While at the Eden Project, Alfie is forced to zip wire across the entire park with his trousers around his ankles and no underwear on. Also Mitchell picks a plant known as 'nature's laxative' which Alfie spikes Susan's drink with. The class continue to Penleven Castle where they see John the Baptist's foreskin. Susan, beginning to feel the effects of the laxative, goes to the toilet and leaves the group unattended. While she is away, Mitchell attempts to steal the foreskin, but loses it instead. Alfie retrieves it, but is unable to put it back before Susan returns. Alfie is forced to eat the foreskin to cover his tracks.\nThe group then arrives at the fishing town of Port Jago, where their hotel is located. Alfie and the children manage to sneak out to the local pub without being caught by Susan.

Alfie and the class arrive at the pub, where Alfie is mistaken for a CLA member because of the unfinished tattoo on his back. Pasco has a plan to assassinate the local Tory MP, Michael Hoye, who is also Atticus' father. Overhearing Alfie talking to Joe about going to the party at Atticus' house, Pasco reveals himself to be a smuggler and recruits Alfie to the CLA. Alfie and the class become involved in the frivolities at the pub, which get out of hand and end up with Joe being stabbed in the hand. Susan records the incident from outside through a window, but before she can send the recording to the other parents, Pasco (at Alfie's request) slips her some sleeping pills, packs her in a trunk, and abandons the trunk in Cherbourg, France. Pasco then takes the group to a strip club, where he asks Alfie to deliver some cannabis to Atticus Hoye's party the following evening on his behalf. Unbeknownst to Alfie, the truck he is to deliver the cannabis in is actually packed full of explosives.

Martin, Fraser, and Rosie drive down to Cornwall in an attempt to find them. Alfie and the children arrive at the party, where Alfie is bullied by his so-called friends and made to teabag a swan. Feeling betrayed by everyone, including his class, he decides to call Pasco to be picked up from the party. Pasco takes this as a signal and detonates the truck, which blows up in the grounds of the Hoye house. Pasco drives Alfie and the children in his truck back to Port Jago and decides to make Alfie the leader of the Cornish rebellion. They are joined by many of the people from the pub and Port Jago itself, who all reveal themselves to be members of the CLA. Meanwhile, the other teachers, trying to find Alfie, have involved the police, who believe the situation to be so serious they call in Interpol, who in turn conclude that Alfie has been radicalised. They are joined at the operation's nerve centre by Susan and some other parents.\nPasco informs the group that the CLA is going to seize the means of production, which in Cornwall's case is its most important tourist attraction. The police believe this to be the Eden Project, and send troops there, but it soon transpires that the group are actually heading to Penleven Castle again (thanks to Susan placing a tracking chip in Joe's neck prior to the film).

During the ensuing chase, Robin falls out of the vehicle while Misha gets shot. As per the plan, Harman jumps out of the car and escapes while the police arrest Liaq. Both Misha and Robin succumb to their injuries in a hospital and later die, shattering her husband and his father Raghav \"Raghu\" Purohit (Varun Dhawan), who violently attacks Liaq in prison before learning through Inspector Govind (Kumud Mishra) that Liaq had a partner. Soon, Raghu approaches a private detective, Mrs. Joshi (Ashwini Kalsekar), who tells him about Liaq's girlfriend and sex worker, Jhimli (Huma Qureshi). Raghu meets and interrogates her and offers all the insurance money he received for his son's death in exchange for telling him Liaq's partner's name, but Jhimli refuses. As a result, an enraged Raghu forces her to dance for him and eventually assaults her. Liaq is convicted for the robbery and sentenced to jail, and Raghu exiles himself to a reclusive life far away from Pune.\nFifteen years later, Liaq becomes terminally ill and wishes to spend his remaining life with his mother. Raghu is approached by a social worker, Shobha (Divya Dutta), who asks him to forgive Liaq, but he declines.

Raghu locates Harman and gets close to his wife Kanchan \"Koko\" Khatri (Radhika Apte), who invites him for lunch to their home where Raghu's true intentions are revealed.

The story then jumps to Chandigarh, in 2014, where a frustrated man, while conversing on phone, loses control of his car due to a basketball and instantly applies brakes thereby also causing a public transport bus to stop, when the couple are just beside each other and fall over, sprouting up the love that led to their marriage.\nWhile the frustrated man stops, a local taxi-driver Gurinder (Anil Mange) jumps out of his taxi and begins creating a scene against the frustrated man, who is then revealed to be enterprising caf\u00e8 owner Dev Arora (Sidhant Gupta), the owner of a very popular caf\u00e8 known as Caf\u00e8 Konnect. Gurinder and Dev part ways, clearing the crowd that had accumulated there.\nA rewind back to a recent history shows Dev's past, when, one day while taking photographs of a cute young woman he saw playing with balloons in the midst of children, he ended up saving another woman, Naari (Suzanna Mukherjee) and later took her to his caf\u00e8. Shortly after, the two entered a live-in relationship with Dev getting a huge loan following Dev's love instinct for Naari. However, despite a huge house and a big loan shark, Naari deserted Dev the very evening he wanted to propose to her during dinner at a five-star hotel on the pretext of using the washroom. Ever since that day, Dev did preserve Naari's belongings, but life for him has taken a back seat and he now has his hopes pinned on friend Pinkesh Kapoor (Karan Mehra), a part-time detective.\nBack again to the foreground in the beginning, there is another typical Chandigarh couple which shares the first meet story. During their first meet, both the boy and the girl have a fight, particularly because the boy despises the girl's ambitions of being a fashion designer. However, the boy ends up unintentionally tearing off the back of the girl's designer gown-dress upon having slipped off a cherry ball on the floor which was being squashed by a man.\nIn comes another man, a fantastic character, Pinkesh, also nicknamed 'Pinku'. Initially a private detective, Pinku has had solved numerous cases, but the toughest case is that of Naari, since she is also one among his half-acquaintances. During the time when Dev was conversing on phone in the first scene, it was actually Pinku himself who was chasing Naari and also speaking to Dev. However, it is revealed that Pinku is also deeply infatuated with Naari, and has often supported her with cons. Also, it is unveiled that the person who tried to squash the cherry on the floor was also Pinku, who later chased Naari and found her, at last, with money belonging to her target. After a few more dozen moves, Naari left, leaving Pinku still undaunted. She later went to Dev's house to empty her belongings from the huge house.\nReturning to Dev's life, the story shows him visiting the bank to mortgage another loan, but the bank is raided by robbers, and while dealing with a crisis, he meets Palak Mehra (Gunjan Malhotra), the same girl he was capturing on his camera, who defends him against a haughty woman trying to falsely accuse him. The two get out, Dev thanks Palak, and asks Pinku to meet up at Velvet Lounge, a starry restaurant. Meanwhile, Palak's friend also arrives there, asking her to meet up at Vintage Lounge.\nAt night in Vintage Lounge, Palak's friend refuses to turn up, while Pinku and Dev do meet, but Pinku makes up a fake pretext of using the washroom and leaves Dev in the lurch, and Dev doesn't have money to pay. Meanwhile, Palak too does not have money to pay. However, they meet each other in a funny manner, with Palak perceiving him as a chicken-bait and Dev perceiving her as Goddess Lakshmi. Both have a fat meal, but when it comes to payment, Dev tokens away his car keys and Palak her ring, which she wanted to wear off after her fianc\u00e9 left her.\nDev and Palak walk on foot to Dev's house where she admires its scenic beauty. Palak asks to change her clothes and occupies Naari's room. Naari turns up at that moment, when Dev asks her to empty her room else he will throw away everything in her room. Palak returns, notices Naari and condemns her and soon takes a taxi.\nIt is further revealed that when Dev had phoned him to reach Vintage Lounge, Pinku was at Dev's house, hidden away in the bathroom since he was helping Naari procure her passport and bags before she could leave.\nA rewind back to Pinku's escape from Vintage Lounge reveals the character who had been narrating the story all this time : Haryanvi Don Jassi Chaudhary (Sharib Hashmi). It is revealed that while Pinku was chasing Naari in the five-star hotel, the latter was with Jassi. The same night when she ditched Dev, she met Jassi, who fell head over heels for her, and while he sang the lovebird songs, Naari eyed some lettuce which Jassi was supposed to give away to a local lord. A reformed gangster, Jassi, who, till then, was into a decent business, began suspecting Pinku of a false move and later discovered that it was he who had Naari escape.\nActually, it is further revealed that the money which Naari stole from Jassi comprised counterfeit notes, which she ferried in a bag. While Dev reached home with Palak that night, Naari hid herself behind a tree, and simultaneously, Jassi and his men also succeeded in spotting Naari. While she occupied Naari's room, Palak didn't literally freshen herself, but instead noticed the bag and unknowingly stuffed the cash bundles into her bag and purse, thinking she might get a government bank job for which her private banking firm demanded a bribe. Naari rushes into her room after Palak leaves, but is devastated to find her bag empty, whereafter she notices Jassi, who forgives her and confesses his love for her. Naari realizes her mistake and reunites with Jassi. Meanwhile, Dev chases Palak, who is in a taxi, which is driven by Gurinder himself, and succeeds in earning her attention and affection. He starts dancing and an SUV car stops. He steps aside, the car leaves, and he starts dancing again, little knowing that Jassi and Naari were in the SUV.\nPresently, Pinku, who was actually spared by Jassi's men whose entry into Velvet Lounge in his search offered Pinku the prerogative of escaping, is at Dev's house, lifting dumbbells and advising Dev against another rendezvous with Palak. While the two meet, they confess love for each other, and find hilariously that they had been running after fake bundles of cash!\nThe story returns to the same foreground in the beginning, where Dev and Palak have a one-on-one meet with the audience as a married couple.

She predicts that just as she yearns for her husband, Kashibai will yearn for Bajirao.\nWhile travelling to Sironja, an emissary from Bundelkhand requests Bajirao's help to fight invaders. She reveals herself to be Mastani, the daughter of the Hindu Rajput king Chhatrasal and his Persian Muslim consort Ruhani Begum.

One afternoon, she is playing on a hill when she accidentally falls off it. When she doesn\u2019t return home by the end of the day, the villagers organize a search party. After hours of searching, they find the little girl on a branch protruding from the hill. She had been stuck on it for the entire day but couldn\u2019t call for help because of her disability. The following morning, her parents and neighbors discuss what must be done to help her. Older man suggests they take her to the shrine of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya in Delhi, India. The religious family believes that a visit to the holy shrine will bring peace and happiness and most importantly, restore Shahida\u2019s speech. Shahida\u2019s father used to be in the military and has fought against the Indian army. He is sure that he won't be provided with a visa to India. Hence, her mother Razia takes it upon herself to travel far from the village for the first time. The trip goes as planned for the most part. The two reach the shrine, pay offerings and get on a train back to their home country. \nOn the return journey, the train stops for repairs at night. When everyone is asleep, Shahida notices a sheep stuck in a pit right outside the train. She doesn\u2019t think much before going outside to help the animal. However, the train restarts before she can return to her mother. The little girl runs towards it but is eventually left behind. In a desperate attempt to go the same way that her mother did, she boards a freight train. But to her dismay, it goes reverse-path and stops in Kurukshetra, India. Raiza notices her daughter is missing and stops the train. Policemen are appointed to look for the girl around the track where she was lost. However, they cannot find her since Shahida has already reached a different place. Raiza meets her husband who is worried to death about his daughter. They cannot get an immediate visa back to India, much to their dismay. The parents have no other way but to pray that their daughter is safe.\nMeanwhile, Shahida is now lost in a different country with no way to communicate. In a religious celebration, she sees a stranger eating at a street-side restaurant. The stranger is the kind Pawan Kumar Chaturvedi who invites her to have a meal with him. After a few minutes of trying to get her to talk, he realizes she is mute and starts calling her Munni. A starving Munni finishes the food and follows Pawan around. Assuming that she was separated from her parents during the festival, he asks her to stay in front of a temple. Pawan is a devout Hindu Brahmin and an ardent devotee of Lord Hanuman. He believes that Lord Hanuman will take Munni home if she stays in front of his temple. When Munni still doesn\u2019t stop following him, he brings her to the police station. But since she cannot tell them any details about her parents, the police can only wait for someone to file a missing complaint. Until her parents are found, Munni needs a place to stay, hence, Pawan takes her in. On his way to his home in Delhi, he tells Munni to call him Mama if she ever talks in the future. He also starts naming different Indian cities, asking her to nod if she knows what city her parents are in. All the passengers on the bus help him but none of them name cities outside of India. As they talk, Pawan tells everyone how he came to Delhi for work. \nA flashback shows the time he was in high school. He was an average student who could never pass the final examination. All his friends cheated and went on with their lives, but Pawan refused to cheat or lie, being a true  \ndevotee of Lord Hanuman. Eventually, he passed on his eleventh try and came to Delhi to look for work. He stayed with his father\u2019s friend, Pandey, a strict Hindu who refused to let the followers of any other religion enter his house. Pandey\u2019s daughter Rasika offered Pawan a job at the school she taught and fell in love with his innocent persona. But being the strict father he is, Pandey asked Pawan to build his own house before marrying his daughter. Even since then, Pawan and Rasika have been working hard to collect money. The two are bound to get married sometime next year. Everyone on the bus is impressed by his story. He and Munni reach his home where Rasika receives them in the doorway. She is glad that Pawan is helping a little girl in need but Pandey doesn\u2019t feel the same way. He is worried about the possibility that Munni belongs to a different religion. Pawan rationalizes that she is Hindu because of her fair skin color and persuades Pandey to let her stay for a month. Munni cries every day in the memory of her parents even though Pawan and Rasika treat her like their own daughter. Since the entire family is vegetarian and Munni is accustomed to eating meat with every meal, she hardly ever finishes her food. \nOne day, Pawan and Rasika find her in a Muslim neighbor\u2019s home devouring home-cooked chicken. Pawan brings her to a restaurant that evening and lets her eat whatever she likes, even though eating meat is against his religion.  \nMunni is very fond of the glittery bangles they sell on the street side. One day while walking down a market, she innocently picks up a pack of bangles before being stopped by the vendor. Pawan makes her return it and takes her to the temple to apologize to God for stealing. As he teaches her to join her hands, Munni sneaks into a Mosque nearby. Pawan is hesitant to follow her inside but he does it anyway. To his utter surprise, he sees her reading the Quran in front of a shrine. For a few minutes, he feels like she betrayed him because he would have never befriended a Muslim.But Rasika makes him realize that she is a human before being Muslim. She hates that her father discriminates against people because of their religion and wants Pawan to be different. Pawan understands and runs into the Mosque to get Munni but by now, she has already left. As he nervously looks for her, she runs to him and hugs him tightly. At that moment, he accepts her entirely, overcoming his irrational fear of going against his religion.  \nThat night is a cricket match against Pakistan and India. The entire family watches it on TV, cheering for India, except Munni who cheers when Pakistan scores. When the Pakistani team wins the game, she dances and kisses their flag through TV. Pawan approaches her and asks her if she is from Pakistan. After weeks of shaking her head to every Indian city, Munni finally nods yes. Pandey is furious. Being a Muslim was bad enough but since the girl is from Pakistan, he can no longer allow her to stay at their home. Pawan promises to hand her to the Pakistani embassy the next day. However, the embassy worker cannot allow her a visa without a passport. In Munni\u2019s case, they don\u2019t even know her real name so a visa allotment is impossible. Moreover, a riot takes place in front of the embassy that closes all visa processing for a month. As the last resort, Pawan takes her to a travel agent at Pandey\u2019s suggestion. The agent promises to take the little girl to the other side of the border and asks for one lakh rupees. Pawan and Rakisa give up the funds they had collected for their house to help Munni. The next day, Pawan reluctantly brings Munni to the travel agent\u2019s office and leaves after a tearful farewell. On his way home, he notices a street vendor selling glittery bangles. He remembers that Munni liked them and buys one for her. However, on returning to the travel agent\u2019s office, he finds out that he has been cheated. The agent has taken the little girl to a brothel and is about to sell her into prostitution. The otherwise composed Pawan loses his temper at the sight of the agent counting bills that he made from Munni. He throws the man out of the window and brings Munni home again. \nPawan has made the decision to bring Munni home himself. Although he has no connections or ideas about Pakistani villages, he packs his bags and makes his way to the border.  A few miles away from it, they meet a secret agent named Ali who illegally transports people to the other side through a tunnel. After listening to Munni\u2019s story, he agrees to take them for free.  When they reach Pakistan\u2019s side of the border, Ali runs away but being a lord Hanuman\u2019s devotee, Pawan refuses to go without asking the guards for permission. When the officers find him, they beat him up as Munni watches and cries. Pawan pretends to laugh even while being beaten so the little girl wouldn\u2019t be afraid. After finding out the reason for his travel the head soldier asks him to do whatever he wants in the following ten minutes before they return for the next round. Pawan decides to wait for them because they have still not permitted him.  Although the idea is idiotic, and he gets beaten up again, he is eventually allowed to go, with permission from the soldiers.\nIn the following scene, he and Munni are in a restaurant. Munni sees a cop\u2019s handcuffs and steals it, assuming that it is a bracelet.  The cop finds out and throws Pawan in jail, labeling him as an Indian spy because of the lack of a passport. Then, we are introduced to a struggling journalist Chand Nawab. He finds out about the alleged spy and runs to the police station to interview him. He gets a few vague answers from Pawan and informs the media company that doesn\u2019t take him seriously. Inside the police station, a cop interrogates Pawan but refuses to believe anything he has to say. Suddenly, Munni sees a picture on a table calendar and recognizes it as her village. Pawan is overjoyed until the policeman forcefully makes Munni open her mouth. Pawan loses his temper and attacks the man, inviting more trouble for himself. He manages to defeat the officers and run away from the police. Nawab sees him escaping and follows him behind. \nThey board the bus where Pawan shows the conductor their destination and also tells him Munni\u2019s story.  After finding out he is actually a good person, Nawab and the rest of the travelers decide to help him. They hide him and Munni on the top of the bus when the police come looking for them. At night, Nawab, Pawan, and Munni stay at a Mosque. A religious scholar named Azad also helps them and hides them from the policemen searching the entire city for the alleged spy. One of Azad\u2019s students sees \"Switzerland\" written on the picture that Munni thought was her village. The group is back to square one. After that, Azad dresses up Pawan and Nawab in a burqa and manages to send them outside the city without the police noticing. Pawan, who was oblivious to Islam a few weeks ago, feels strange in them traditional clothing. He apologizes to his god but is ready to do anything for Munni. For the next few days, Pawan and Nawab take Munni to several different places, asking people if they know her. Nawab documents their journey and everything about Munni and Pawan\u2019s relationship. He tries selling the documentary to news channels, but they refuse to air it, claiming that it is boring. They have to find another way to spread the news so, the people on the internet can help. One day, they go to a famous mosque were they find policemen looking for them. Nawab realizes that his cameraman friend is being used by the police to gather information about their whereabouts. The trio immediately runs away from the holy place and gives the cameraman false information to distract the police.  \nFollowing that, the group is reviewing the footage from their time at the mosque when Munni recognizes her mother in one of the clips. They see her getting into a specific bus and go to the bus driver the very next day. On inquiring, he names all the villages that come to his daily route. One of them is Sultanpur which Munni confirms is her home. Nawab and Pawan hug, having finally found their destination. Nawab also uploads the video documentary on YouTube and the police get a hint of their location through it. On their way to Sultanpur, the bus is stopped to be checked. With no way out, Pawan comes to the police\u2019s view and pretends to run away. While the men are busy trying to catch him, Nawab takes Munni and brings her back to her village. In the following scene, we see Munni run to her mother, who couldn\u2019t be happier to see her. As she reunites with her family, Pawan gets beaten up by the police. \nThe documentary on YouTube goes viral and bigger news channels start covering the story. Eventually, people find out that Pawan is not a spy and is being held in prison for helping a little girl. Both Indian and Pakistani people give him all their support. But the Pakistani officials refuse to let him go. They torture him in prison, beating him up for hours, drowning him until his last breath, and starving him. Nawab then claps back with another video, this time on a bigger platform, asking people to gather at the border and ensure that Pawan reaches home safely. The plan works, and several people from both sides come to the border in crowds. Rasika and her family are also among the crowd, waiting for him to come home. Eventually, the officials have to back down. The crowd erupts chanting Pawan\u2019s name as he crosses the border. Then, we see Munni among the crowd, waving her hands but unable to call him. All of a sudden, she shouts \u201cMama\u201d, the name Pawan wanted her to call him when they first met. The crowd goes silent as she yells goodbye. Pawan turns around in shock.

She asks him to pull a massive con to get revenge on three people: Makrand Rao aka \"Makrandam\" (Tanikella Bharani), Seshagiri (Rao Ramesh) and Bhale Babu (Posani Krishna Murali). All three became \"filthy rich\" through embezzling the money of the poor in their chit fund. When their accountant and her father Satyanarayana (Subhalekha Sudhakar) discovered this and threatened to expose these activities, they framed and imprisoned him for the crime, leading to his depression and a stroke that put him in paralysed in the present. However, the three's greed also led to their split, and they aren't on friendly terms anymore. Upon hearing this, Vishwa not only agrees to defraud them, he rejects payment for personal reasons. He enrolls the help of his actor friend nicknamed Tellabbai (transl.\u2009White/pure guy)  (Sampoornesh Babu), and using Jahnavi's experience with building cameras, the three start planning.\nThey first target Makrandam, who collects antiques, by convincing to buy a chest belonging to a rich zamindar. The chest contains a fake letter that purportedly states the location of some of the zamindar's wealth. Overjoyed, Makrandam and his assistant Chikati Rao (lit.\u2009'\"Darkness\" Rao') (Srinivas Avasarala) buy the land from a local farmer and dig for the treasure that night. They find a chest, but see that it only contains shredded paper and a tape recorder declaring that they have been fooled. Vishwa and Tellabbai take their ladder and splash a concoction on them that makes them faint, and the next morning they are found in the hole, leading to their humiliation on live TV. However, Makrandam was able to see Vishwa's face when he dumped the solution.\nNext, Vishwa goes after Seshagiri by posing as an American businessman. Seshagiri sees through his ruse, having learned about the defrauding of Makrandam, and claims that he can't be fooled. Vishwa challenges him to give a 10 crore (100 million) check to him under the condition that Seshagiri calls the bank beforehand to add extra permission requirements, which he accepts in his arrogance. The initially smug Seshagiri gets tensed over time checking if the check is deposited yet and shows his anger at work and at home. He then wakes up to discover that the check has been portrayed as a donation to charity, creating a national spectacle and leaving him no choice but to allow the check to be cashed. The ruling chief minister (Sayaji Shinde), jealous that he didn't give any money to him, cancels a contract for a 5000 crore (50 billion) hydropower project, angering Seshagiri, who decides to partner with Makrandam to figure out how to retaliate.\nFinally, Vishwa gets Bhale Babu by revealing his knowledge of Bhale Babu's ambition to become Prime Minister of India as well as secret affair, and convinces him to run in the village elections while acting as is campaign manager. Their main opponent is Parvathalu (Chandra Mohan), a righteous man who decrys Bhale Babu's rowdyism through his newspaper Agni. To stop Parvathalu, Vishwa and Bhale Babu force him to sell his newspaper to them and withdraw.

Be My Cat is a film he has written so Anne Hathaway can play the leading role. He states that his interest in Anne and making this film came from her portrayal of Catwoman in The Dark Knight Rises, citing a love for cats.\nThe first actress that he uses as an example of his directorial style is a girl named Sonia, whose parents drop her off with Adrian at an abandoned house down the street from where he stays with his mother. Adrian begins shooting a scene with Sonia that doubles as a frustrating acting exercise. It becomes clear that Be My Cat is about a stalker obsessed with an actress, and the lines start to blur between Adrian as director and Adrian as the character. Increasingly frustrated and frightened, Sonia calls the police. After talking with her, Adrian explains to the police that it was a misunderstanding and convinces Sonia to shoot another scene at night. In the night scene the stalker uses chloroform to abduct the actress. In the second take, Adrian uses real chloroform and knocks Sonia out.\nAfter taking her to his bedroom Adrian procures a cat suit. Before undressing her and putting the cat suit on her, Adrian explains to the camera (now personified as \"Anne\") that he would never do this in real life, and that it is only him in character. He also states that he is worthy of Anne in every way, betraying that his intentions for Anne may be more than artistic. Adrian stays the night beside the knocked out Sonia. When she wakes up frightened he insists that she must be sacrificed for her art. He chokes Sonia to death and hides her body in the basement.\nWhile going to meet the second actress Adrian explains that he was bullied in the past, and due to this he dislikes boys and dogs for their meanness and likes girls and cats due to their sweetness and innocence. He also explains that the character in his film seeks to turn the actress character into a surrogate of his cat that he accidentally killed, and that this is based on how he accidentally killed his cat as a child. He ironically chances upon a dead cat on the side of the road.\nUpon meeting the second actress Flory, Adrian is disappointed, as she had sent him pictures of herself when she was younger. Displeased with her age and weight, Adrian berates her. Flory offers him sexual favors in exchange to let her be in the movie, which disgusts Adrian. He tells Anne that he will not accept.\nIn the next scene Adrian has apparently allowed Flory to stay as they pick up the third actress, a young girl name Alexandra.

The village is informed that the government has fallen and military-aligned rebels have seized control of the country. With rebel forces headed towards the village, many people flee to the country's capital for safety. Agu's father buys safe transport for his wife and two youngest children, but has to stay behind with Agu and his eldest son. Rebel and government forces fight in and around Agu's village. While the rebel soldiers flee, government forces round up the remaining villagers and execute them, but Agu evades capture and escapes into the jungle.\nAfter wandering for an unspecified amount of time, Agu is caught up in a guerrilla skirmish. The Native Defense Forces (NDF), a rising rebel faction in the country, adopts Agu into their ranks. Agu's battalion is led by the Commandant, who takes Agu under his wing. Following a brutal initiation process where Agu hacks an innocent captive to death with a machete, Agu becomes a fully-fledged member of the militia. Agu befriends another young NDF child soldier, Strika, who never speaks. One night, the Commandant summons Agu to his quarters and rapes him. Strika, another of the Commandant's rape victims, comforts him. Preacher, an older soldier, gives Agu brown-brown to lift his mood. Agu and Strika take part in a number of bloody battles and ambushes. During one of the raids Agu, under the influence of brown-brown, mistakes a village-woman during a raid for his mother. He exclaims that he found her and clings to her while the other members of the group declare they want to rape her. The woman says not to recognise Agu and he calls her a witch woman. One of the other child soldiers drags the young girl with the woman and stomps the child to death. Agu joins in. He wonders if God sees what he is doing.

Two I-C accuses the Commandant of orchestrating the incident before dying, while the Commandant insists it must have been a botched attempt against himself. The prostitute professes that it was an accident, but the Commandant and his men shoot the women and leave the city with the battalion.\nNow on the run from their own faction as well as their enemies, the battalion suffers heavy losses. Airstrikes and supply shortages kill many of them, including Strika. The remaining members of the battalion take shelter at a gold mine for several months, hoping to find gold to pay for supplies.

While all that is going on in their lives, on the night of Vijayadashami after Durga Puja in their North Kolkata residence, in front of the gathered family, Biswanath Majumdar drops a bombshell. He declares that he has decided to divorce his wife, and their mother, Arati. However, hard the children try, they cannot extract any information from their father, while their mother seem most unconcerned about the announcement. Biswanath files a divorce case in court. In the court proceddings, Biswanath declares that he wants to divorce Arati because he believes that their married life, having fulfilled its purpose, has been converted into a series of obligatory chores, which he wants to be freed of by starting life afresh.

The family decides to spend this 15-day vacation at their Santiniketan residence. Unsatisfied with Biswanath's explanation, Barin and his three brothers-in-law place CCTV cameras in Arati & Biswanath's room to eavesdrop on their conversation along with their spouses in order to discover the 'real reason' behind the divorce. As Biswanath and Arati share their long experiences of living together - their grudges, their disappointments, and their delights, they realize that despite having very little or no emotional connection with each other for prolonged periods due to Biswanath's busy schedule and Arati's involvement with their family, they continued to care for each other. It's drastically different from their children's actions, who have adapted the modern lifestyle and are whimsical regarding their marital lives. As they see their parents, the siblings discover their own follies and in no time, love is rekindled with their spouses. In the course of their conversations, Biswanath grudges that Arati had never loved him in person; she loved the family life and was driven by habits to care for him. Arati retorts that her family life does not exclude Biswanath and that her caring habits denote her love for him. She also grudges him for his whimsical nature towards her wishes and desires. At last, Biswanath convinces Arati to divorce him by stating that he wants to divorce Arati in order to make her self-dependent, at which Arati unwillingly agrees and the two separate. However, after four months, Biswanath finds out that Arati has managed to be self-sufficient, but he cannot get rid of his dependence on her and returns to Arati.

While getting water for his master, he encounters Okba, another of Quraysh's leaders, who is persuading the people of Mecca to come to his shop and buy various types of idols from him, and the mysterious and masked Charlatan Priest, who tricks people to give their money to him with promises that the idols will grant them all of their desires.\nIn another part of the city, Safwan, Umayyah's son, is bullying Ghufaira, Bilal's sister, along with his friends and is about to shoot her with an arrow when Bilal intervenes and saves her. Umayyah hears about this from one of his merchants and reminds Bilal of his status with brutality before ordering the guards to whip him. After that, Umayyah slaps Safwan for losing to a slave and embarrassing him.\nOne day, Bilal meets and befriends a white horse, whom he rides until adulthood. He becomes friends with Saad, a skilled archer. On his way back to Umayyah's mansion, he stops a hungry young boy from stealing from the idol's bowl to spare him a beating from the Meccan Priest's guards. He gives the boy his own food instead. His act of kindness is seen by Abu Bakr, a man who believes in equality for everyone and sees greatness in Bilal. However, Bilal doubts him and his beliefs, unable to see a future where slaves are treated fairly. Unbeknownst to both of them, Safwan's servant had been watching them while they had their conversation.\nAfter receiving a gift from Sohaib, a slave of Persian origin purchased from the Roman lands, which is actually the gift from his master to Umayyah, Bilal is told to sing at Umayyah's feast at night. He leaves after his song to the sound of his master's friends mockingly praising, laughing, and insulting his late mother. The next day, Bilal goes back to Abu Bakr to ask for clarity and accepts his belief that there is only one God. He also learns that even people like Umayyah are slaves as well, their master being \"greed\".\nAt the next feast celebrating Safwan's first success as a merchant, another Quraysh leader named Abu al-Hakam, warned Umayyah of the new movement opposing them. Upon learning from al-Hakam that some of his fellow merchants are beginning to join the new movement, Umayyah is enraged by this and demands to know of any more traitors among his ranks. Seeing the opportunity, Safwan accuses Bilal of being part of the new movement. After being questioned by his master, Bilal then defies Umayyah and is taken to a cage where he is tortured every day to force him to renounce his claims. One day, Umayyah comes and offers him an opportunity to be a spy against the movement. Bilal does not yield and is then taken out to the public where he is chained in front of the Meccans. A large boulder is put on top of him to slowly crush him, but he was saved by Abu Bakr who buys him from his oppressive master.\nGhufaira, however, was given to Safwan by his father as a gift. He chooses not to sell her just to torture Bilal mentally. Three months later, after being sold off to his new master, Abu Bakr frees Bilal. Bilal is then taught how to fight with a sword by Hamza, who is the foster brother, paternal uncle, and also one of the companions of the movement's leader, while also traveling with them up north, fleeing from the persecution of the Meccans. One year later, after the migration to the great city of Yathrib, now renamed as Medina, Safwan sends Bilal a lock of Ghufaira's hair. Bilal immediately rides back to Mecca after receiving it, followed by Hamza. They find a part of the city on fire, where many who are part of the new movement are slaughtered by the order of Umayyah and his fellow corrupted merchants. Bilal hurries to Umayyah's mansion and is caught by the guards. Safwan then shows him a coin that Ghufaira had been keeping safe for Bilal. However, the coin is drenched in blood, implying that Ghufaira has been killed. Just as the guards are about to execute Bilal, Hamza steps in and saves him, after which they both successfully escape back to Medina.\nA year later, two more cities join the new movement like Medina, resulting in Umayyah and his merchants deciding to declare war on them for threatening the Meccans' power. Amid the battle, Bilal faces Umayyah and asks that they end the war for the sake of peace. However, Umayyah refuses and is killed by Bilal. Due to the deaths of Umayyah and al-Hakam in the battle as well as help from divine warriors who come to the movement's aid, the army of Qurayshi Meccans quickly fall into disorganization and are subsequently defeated.\nThe death of Umayyah spreads fast in every city and the angry Safwan prepares for revenge with his troops from various allying cities of the peninsula. A year later, Hamza dies in another battle against the Qurayshi warriors of Mecca, becoming a martyr along with those who were killed in the battle.\nMany years later, most of the cities in Arabia have fallen and only Mecca remains opposing the newly-emerged and unified polity. The High Priest of Mecca is dead after an attempt to please the idols by fasting. However, his attempt ends in vain and all idols of Mecca have proven to be powerless.

Safwan reiterates Bilal's words, that a man is judged by his actions, and says that freeing Ghufaira will be his one act of morality. Bilal spares Safwan, leaves his chamber, and encourages him to continue on this path.\nAfter Bilal and Ghufaira reunite, Safwan hears the noise coming from the city's holy site and comes out to see Bilal call for prayer at the Kaaba after the statue of Hubal and the other idols have been removed.", "tmdb_id": 332718}, "44482933": {"title": "Bin Roye", "plot": "The film starts by introducing Saba Shafiq (Mahira Khan) and Irtaza's (Humayun Saeed) relationship.

Douglas suffers from Reye syndrome, leading the devastated Lindsey to remove him from life support over Whitey's furious objections.\nAlthough Connolly is supported by his co-worker John Morris, their boss, Charles McGuire, is suspicious. Whitey increasingly exploits his status as an informant, using Connolly's \"protection\" as a cover for his crimes.

Soon after, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange gets hacked, causing soy futures to rise. The Chinese government and FBI determine that the hack was performed using a remote access tool. Captain Chen Dawai of the People's Liberation Army cyberwarfare unit is tasked with finding the hacker, and enlists the aid of his sister Lien, a networking engineer. He meets with FBI Special Agent Carol Barrett in Los Angeles and reveals the code in the tool was written by himself and Nicholas Hathaway, his college roommate, during their time at MIT. Dawai requests that Hathaway, who is in prison for hacking banks, be offered a temporary release in exchange for his services. Hathaway, knowing how necessary he is to the investigation, demands new terms: his prison sentence commuted if his assistance leads to the hacker's identification and capture. He is required to wear an ankle bracelet monitor and be accompanied by deputy U.S. Marshal Mark Jessup.\nHathaway manipulates the update system on Jessup's phone GPS that tracks his location, allowing him to follow his own lead and arrange a meeting with the hacker's partner at a restaurant. While they wait, he tells Lien about his past, but the partner does not arrive. Hathaway discovers a camera watching them and, following it to the connected computer, messages the hacker that he is now on his trail.\nClues uncovered by Dawai and Barrett lead the team to Hong Kong, where they work with Police Inspector Alex Trang. The team traces the stock trade money to a paramilitary operative named Elias Kassar. Hathaway, Jessup, Chen, and Trang, along with a Special Duties Unit team, raid Kassar's hideout, and a shootout ensues in a drainage tunnel, resulting in the deaths of Trang and several officers as Kassar and his men escape.\nThe nuclear plant has stabilized enough to have a data drive recovered from the control room, but it is corrupted by radiation. The National Security Agency's Black Widow software has the ability to repair the data, but they refuse to allow the Chinese access. Reluctantly sanctioned by Barret, Hathaway hacks into the NSA and uses Black Widow, discovering that the hacker's server is based in Jakarta. Lien finds out the hacker has been buying high-resolution satellite photos of a site near Seri Manjung, Malaysia.\nFor his illegal hack, the NSA and FBI demand Hathaway's return to prison. Dawai's superiors advise him to turn Hathaway over to the U.S. government, but he instead alerts Hathaway to their plans. Meanwhile, one of Kassar's men secretly plants a tracking device on Dawai's car. As Hathaway and Lien, who have become romantically involved, argue about his fleeing alone, Dawai is blown up by a rocket launched by Kassar; Barret and Jessup, arriving on the scene, manage to shoot several of Kassar's men before they are both killed. Lien and Hathaway escape on a subway train, and she uses her connections to charter a plane to Malaysia.\nHathaway deduces that the hacker's attack at the nuclear plant was merely a test for a later plan: to sabotage a large dam and destroy several major tin mines in Malaysia, allowing the hacker to make a profit buying tin options. In Jakarta, he hacks into a bank's computer and transfers the hacker's funds into Hathaway's Swiss bank account, then forcing the hacker, Sadak, to contact him. Sadak and Hathaway agree to meet and discuss a partnership; Hathaway anticipates a double-cross and arms himself with makeshift weapons and body armor which he conceals under his clothes.\nThough Hathaway insists Sadak and Kassar come alone, they bring their henchmen. Lien spots them and alerts Hathaway, who orders them to a new location in a park during a large religious procession. Hathaway trails them, but is caught at gunpoint by Kassar. As he is being frisked, Hathaway blindsides and stabs Kassar to death with a sharpened screwdriver.

She is being harassed by a local man named Blackway (Liotta), who is a big criminal in their small town. He operates with impunity in this small community on the edge of the wilderness.\nAfter Blackway kills her cat, she goes to the town sheriff for help, but is basically told that her best option is to leave town. Lillian refuses to be run out of town by Blackway, but Sheriff Wingate is reluctant to act against Blackway out of fear; feeling sympathetic to Lillian, he tells her to go to the town lumberyard mill and ask for a man named Scotty. The following events that unfold afterwards all happen within one single day.\nIn the early morning, Lillian goes to the lumberyard mill, where a group of elderly men are gathered in the shop's office, run by Whizzer. Lillian tells Whizzer that she is looking for Scotty on the recommendation of Sheriff Wingate to help her with Blackway. Scotty isn't there, and the men also tell her the same thing that the sheriff said, which is to leave town rather than go up against Blackway.\nOne of the older men at the shop, Lester (Hopkins), feels bad for Lillian and decides to help her. He takes along a young man named Nate (Ludwig), who is also an employee at the mill and in the shop with the elderly men. Nate is a simple guy, but is strong and has a good heart. The three drive around town in Nate's pickup truck looking for Blackway at various locations and asking for him from the locals that he associates with. Through their quest in tracking down Blackway, various bits of details are revealed about the town's locals through flashbacks, conversations, and narratives; such as Sheriff Wingate recommending Scotty to help Lillian because he figured Scotty might have a score to settle with Blackway. In a flashback Scotty is shown to have gotten beaten up really badly by Blackway, but Scotty presently states that he has nothing to settle with Blackway anymore.\nIt's also hinted that Lester's daughter, who died of suicide, might have been abusing heavy drugs; for which Blackway is the local drug kingpin, manufacturing and distributing meth, hillbilly heroin, etc. Through various associates of Blackway, they find his shady accountant, Murdoch, at a bar. Murdoch gets into a fight with Nate, and seems to be winning when he has Nate pinned back on to a table, until Lester bends Murdoch's fingers backwards, causing excruciating pain. Nate then gets the upper hand on the fight and the three are able to leave the bar.\nThey head out to a local diner, where Lester asks the cook, Chris, who is newly released from prison on drug charges, where they could find Blackway. Chris tells Lester to try Blackway's motel, where he runs his drug business as well as other criminal activities. They find Blackway at his motel in the afternoon, but do not act upon it, as Lester can see that it's not a good opportunity yet.\nInside one of the motel rooms, Lillian finds an old school acquaintance handcuffed to a bed, she releases her while Lester and Nate distracts two of Blackway's men. Lester grabs a handgun from one of the men, while Nate grabs a shotgun that was in sight. Nate causes an explosion inside the motel room, presumably because meth was being cooked in the room; Lillian puts her old acquaintance on a bus to get out of town after rescuing her.\nIt is now evening time, and the three drive up into the deep woods, while Whizzer is narrating to the men in the shop about the dangers of the deep backwoods. Since Nate and Lester have been causing Blackway so much trouble all day, Lester knows that he will be looking for them. They settle in for the night out at a camping ground area of the woods, and Lester goes off with his antique shotgun, leaving Lillian and Nate alone together.\nBlackway shows up at night, armed with a pistol pointed at Lillian and Nate. Lester has a clear shot of Blackway from inside a trailer and is about to kill him, but unbeknownst to Nate of Lester's vantage point, Nate fends off Blackway to protect him and Lillian. When Lester gets another chance of a clear shot of Blackway again, he gets shot instead by Murdoch who finds him in the trailer, and Blackway is able to knock out Nate.\nLillian is able to escape by bending Blackway's fingers backwards the same way she saw Lester do to Murdoch at the bar, giving off a chase between her and Blackway into a cabin. Before Murdoch can finish off Lester in the trailer, Nate attacks Murdoch and then beats him to death. After a hide and chase between Blackway and Lillian inside the cabin, they both make it back outside to the campfire area, where Blackway is finally killed by Lester with one shot from the shotgun that he had inherited from his uncle.\nLester tells them that they'll have to drag Blackway and Murdoch's bodies deep into the woods so that the wild animals will scavenge their bodies and they'll never be found.\nAt daybreak the next morning, the three drive back into town. Whizzer, who is opening up his lumber mill during daybreak, sees the pickup truck coming back into town and knows that the town is finally rid of Blackway just from seeing the truck.

Hunt leaves Samantha in the sheriff's office with his other deputy, Nick, to tend to Purvis' wounds. That night, a nearby stable boy is killed.\nHunt learns of the murder and goes to his office finding it empty, with an arrow left behind.

The group later witness Nick stripped, brutally scalped, bisected alive, and then consumed. Hunt tricks several Troglodytes into drinking liquor laced with opium tincture, with one dying while another becomes unconscious. Arthur follows the men's trail and discovers the valley. He kills two Troglodytes and discovers they use an animal bone in their windpipes as a whistle. He blows on it, luring another Troglodyte, then kills him.\nIn the cave, the Troglodyte leader grows angry at the poisoning. The Troglodytes cut open Hunt's abdomen, shove the heated opium flask into the wound, and shoot him. Arthur arrives, killing the leader, and frees Samantha and Chicory. A mortally wounded Hunt stays behind with a rifle, promising to kill any surviving Troglodytes when they return, to prevent them from terrorizing Bright Hope.

Later, when Garrett's car brakes fail to work, he and Kevin are nearly involved in an accident. That evening, Noah attempts to blackmail Claire, telling her that he has a video of them having sex, which he will relinquish to her if she continues sleeping with him.

Noah binds and gags Vicky with duct tape and uses a recording of her voice to lure Claire to her house. \nWhen Claire arrives, she discovers Vicky dead, and as a horrified Claire contacts the police, she runs into Noah again. She accuses him of killing his parents, and he clarifies that his mother killed herself after his father cheated on her and he retaliated by cutting the brakes of his father's car, killing him and his mistress. Noah takes Claire to a barn house where he has tied up Garrett and Kevin, outlining his deluded notion that killing them will help him and Claire to start a new life together, and soon pours kerosene around the barn, causing it to ignite in flames. In the ensuing struggle, Claire finally destroys Noah's delusional love for her by stabbing his eye with Kevin's EpiPen. An enraged Noah attempts to kill all three, but Claire eventually pulls a lever that drops an engine on Noah, ultimately killing him.

God is a grumpy sadist who created humankind specifically to have something to torment. He manipulates reality via a personal computer which he forbids his family from accessing. One day, Ea sneaks into his office and discovers how he has been mistreating humans. This enrages God who then whips Ea with his belt. Ea decides to rebel against her father. She steals the key to His office and accesses the scheduled dates of death of every human in the world and releases the information to them via their portable telephones. Everyone with a cell phone receives a text message informing them exactly when they will die. Ea then locks God's computer and escapes from the apartment through a washing machine which provides a tunnel to the outside world. Wandering the streets of Brussels, Ea decides to follow in the footsteps of her brother Jesus and write a Brand New Testament as her contribution to the human race. She selects six apostles to narrate their life stories. She first enlists a homeless man, Victor, to be her scribe, since she cannot write well.\nThe first apostle is a reclusive woman who lost her left arm in an accident and feels nobody will love her. The second is a man who hates his work and his life, who has decided to never move from a bench in the park now that he knows the date of his death. Ea translates to allow him to converse with a bird. This induces him to follow a flock of birds to the North Pole. The third apostle is a sexually frustrated man who is awkward with women and remains lovesick for a German girl he met once as a boy. With Ea's encouragement, he becomes a voice actor for porn movies, where he encounters and establishes a relationship with his lifelong fixation. The fourth apostle is a man who is fascinated with death and killing. He purchases a rifle and shoots people knowing that, since all death dates are already predetermined, they can not be his responsibility. Ea prods him to shoot a woman, the first apostle. He hits her in her prosthetic arm. Believing this to be a divine signal, he courts the woman and they establish a relationship, and he learns to embrace life instead of death. The fifth apostle is an elderly woman trapped in a loveless marriage, especially now that her husband knows he will outlive her by many years. Ea persuades her to cheat on her husband. She has sex with a young male prostitute, and then forms a love relationship with a gorilla. The gorilla scares her husband away, to her delight. The sixth apostle is a sickly boy who, with only days left to live, decides to live them as a girl. Ea encourages her to live each day as the equivalent of one month.\nGod is horrified when he discovers what Ea has done and that he can no longer torment humans. Locked out of his computer, he is powerless. He leaves the apartment using the chute in the laundry room, and in the real world he suffers all the mistreatment and frustrations he created for mankind. He is assaulted by everyone he meets. He discovers to his horror that the tunnel to his apartment has disappeared and he is trapped on Earth powerless and alone. He takes shelter in a church, where his outrageous criticism of his son Jesus Christ provokes a charitable priest into beating him senseless and eventually deporting him to Uzbekistan with a group of illegal immigrants.\nEa and her apostles go to the seaside where hundreds of people have gathered to spend the last hours of their lives. An airplane, which happens to be carrying God under police escort, falls out of the sky and threatens to crash onto the beach and kill everyone. At the last moment, however, God's wife realizes that the number of apostles has grown to 18, her favorite number, explores her husband's work space, unwittingly restarts his computer, and begins to configure a new life for mankind. She deletes the messages that notified people of their death date. The airplane regains altitude and a new creation is born under a flower-filled sky. Victor publishes the Brand New Testament which becomes a bestseller and catapults him out of hopeless poverty into a whole new life of fame and fortune.

It had been examined by various experts and declared to be one of Vincent van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\", similar to a masterpiece thought to be destroyed during a U.S. air raid in Japan during World War II.\nJirokichi Suzuki, accompanied by his niece, Sonoko fights off all contenders with a $300 million bid. At a press conference, he announces his plan to gather all seven of the known Van Gogh's Sunflowers paintings around the world for a grand exhibition. The venue would be a purpose-built gallery in Japan known as \"Lake Rock\", which boasts of iron-clad security and protection of the art pieces against fire, damaging humidity, sunlight, etc. The announcement is broadcast live worldwide, watched by Conan and Haibara.\nJirokichi also announces the engagement of seven specialists, whom he called the \"Seven Samurai\", to oversee the exhibition and protect the Sunflowers:\n\nKeiko Anderson, a painting exhibition planning professional;\nNatsumi Miyadai, a painting history professional;\nKoji Azuma, a painting restoration and preservation professional;\nKumiko Kishi, a painting exhibition professional;\nTaizo Ishimine, a painting transportation professional;\nCharlie, a New York Police Department professional engaged to safeguard the painting out of New York;\nKogoro Mori, a Tokyo private detective engaged to protect the painting in Japan.Suddenly, a card is thrown on the platform, which has the insignia of the legendary phantom thief, Kaitou Kid. Kid makes his presence known, causing mass panic by firing his card gun. Inspector Charlie chases Kaitou Kid and surrounds him, but Kid is still able to escape using a flare bomb. Much to Jirokichi and Sonoko's shock, Kud\u014d Shinichi arrives from behind and offers his services to catch Kid.\nConan is particularly intrigued by Kid's sudden interest in masterpiece paintings, as his interests had previously been limited to gemstones. The painting is moved by airplane with the Seven Samurai, Jirokichi, Sonoko and Shinichi Kud\u014d riding in it and set out for Japan. Ran, Conan and his friends, Kogoro, Inspector Nakamori, Agasa and others arrive at the Haneda airport to receive them. A bomb detonates near the cargo compartment of the plane and the recently purchased painting flies away. Shinichi jumps off the plane and saves the painting. It is revealed that Shinichi Kudo is none other than Kaitou Kid himself in disguise (surprise surprise didn't see that one coming). The police and Conan spot Kid flying away with the painting, while the plane is in danger of crashing. This triggers chaos at the airport. Conan locates Kid on the terrace but Kid merely smirks and leaves. Conan finds out that Kid left the painting on the roof of a building. The plane safely lands and there are no casualties. The painting is retrieved by Conan who was mystified by Kid's actions as Kid never did any actions that could potentially harm anyone, and suspects a \"fake Kid\". The painting is examined and is found to be unharmed.\nInspector Charlie brands Kid as a ruthless murderer and terrorist, to which Sonoko objects (as she, like many others is a fan of Kid). Meanwhile, a Kid card arrives, saying he would be stealing van Gogh's second painting. Conan happenes to be at the art gallery where the second painting is, and as he went off when he heard news about Kid, he put Haibara in charge of the other kids. Haibara then resumes a talk with an old woman who came to the art gallery every day to see van Gogh's painting.\nAs the Seven Samurai are securing the painting, another Kid card appears, hinting that the painting was already stolen ahead of time and was replaced with a replica. Conan is surprised as Kid never lied about the time of his thefts. Tricked by it, Jirokichi orders the painting to be reexamined. Natsumi is unable to determine if the painting is real or fake and asks to take the painting to their workshop. One of the security guards puts a Kid card in Jirokichi's pocket and is reveals himself as Kaitou Kid. Kid steals the painting and is chased by Conan and Charlie. But Kid once more outwits them and escapes. In the new note, Kid demands \u00a510 billion in cash as a ransom for the second painting within the next two hours, and Jirokichi accepts. This again puzzles Conan, because Kid had never demanded money and had always returned stolen goods. The money, in cash, is placed in an isolated room with only the art gallery's director present. Conan finds that the pressure in the room was increasing, as the water in a bottle in the room seemed to have increased, even though the director had drunk from it. Conan and Charlie storm the room, and Kid who appears at that room escaped, though the painting is intact. Kid had also anonymously contacted the media to witness the escapade. Jirokichi announces that the seven paintings would remain exhibiting on schedule, though Jirokichi is threatened with another Kid's card and Phosphine. Inspector Charlie resolves to show no mercy against Kid, and intends to kill him.\nOn the day of the exhibition, Kid once more impersonates Shinichi, and attends the exhibition. He leaves another Kid card with an enigmatic message. Conan discovers it and realises that it is a cryptic warning related to the Last Supper and its betrayer. Conan understands that Kid is warning that one of the Seven Samurai is the culprit behind these incidents. As soon as Kid's presence is discovered, Jirokichi orders the gallery be evacuated and asks Inspector Nakamori to perform a background check on the Seven Samurai, while Charlie pursues Kid. Suddenly, the power system fails and a fire breaks out. Nakamori identifies that Koji Azuma had previously killed his twin brother when the newly discovered painting was recovered from Arles. Azuma confesses, but denies being the culprit in the present incident. In the fierce fire, two of the paintings are left to burn. Kid saves one of the paintings. Conan arrives to see Kid desperately trying to save the other painting whose security system has been jammed. Kid and Conan, with Ran's help, are able to activate the security mechanism and put the painting to safety while the gallery is collapsing.\nIn a desperate bid to put out the inferno, Kid detonates a bomb which breaks the water tank and douses the fire. Ran is knocked unconscious. Kid takes Ran and flees along with Conan. Kid tells Conan that he was aware of the culprit's plans to destroy the paintings when he hacked into her computer. Conan realises that Kid is innocent. The building threatens to collapse, so Conan requests Kid to save Ran and leave. Kid reluctantly agrees and breaks out of the building and leaves Ran near a lake. Jirokichi inspects the paintings and discovers that the second painting is missing.\nConan, using Shinichi's voice, then contacts everyone and concluded that Natsumi Miyadai is the true culprit. He reveals to everyone that all this while, Kaitou Kid was aware who the culprit was all along and was constantly thwarting her plans. In New York Kid had caused chaos so that Jirokichi would tighten the security of the paintings, preventing Natsumi to carry her plans. Kid had impersonated Shinichi and accompanied the group to Japan to ensure that the painting was safely transported. Natsumi had set off a bomb in the plane to destroy the painting, but Kid had rescued it and returned it. Knowing that Natsumi was also targeting the fifth painting, Kid had sent out a theft notice to once more tighten the security. Natsumi planted a fake Kid card to perform a re-examination of the painting. When Natsumi had suggested taking the painting to her workshop, Kid was forced to snatch it away, with the motive to enforce security. It was Natsumi who had sent the fake Kid card and phosphine to kill Jirokichi, to halt the exhibition and destroy the paintings. Natsumi had suggested putting fake sunflowers near her targets and had coated them with turpentine to act as incendiary. To stop Natsumi, Kid had sent out a message to Conan, hoping the latter would expose her. Natsumi wanted to destroy the two paintings as she was under the false assumption that they were fakes.\nKid and Ran are able to escape from the wreckage, but Conan is trapped inside as the water flooded the gallery. Ran is found by the police. Conan uses the ball to generate pressure differences to ensure the rock would explode, and goes along the water stream with the last painting. He falls unconscious for a brief moment before being able to resurface to be rescued by Kogoro.\nKid is cornered by Charlie. Kid tells Charlie that Natsumi had previously sent him an anonymous voice message, to steal the paintings for her. Being a master of disguise, Kid had identified her and was after her. Charlie asks Kid as to why the paintings concerned him. Kid tells him that during the first US air raid in Japan during World War II, the painting was saved from being burnt down by Azuma's grandfather, confirming that the painting was real. He requested a servant to save his lover from the fire. The servant had told Kid of this story and had asked him to save the paintings at all costs. The servant is revealed to be Konosuke Jii, Kaitou Kid's friend and assistant. The woman is revealed to be the old lady which Haibara talked to in the museum.\nCharlie decides not to apprehend Kid, because despite being a thief, Kid is a man of honor.

These autonomous androids were developed by British scientist Deon Wilson and largely supplant the overwhelmed human police force. A competing project within the company is the remote-controlled MOOSE, developed by Australian soldier-turned-engineer Vincent Moore. Deon is praised for Tetravaal's success, but Vincent grows envious when the police are unwilling to give his heavy weapons platform equal attention.\nAt home, Deon creates a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind to the point of feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley refuses to let him test the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, Deon steals a recently damaged robot before it is destroyed and puts it in his van, along with the \"guard key\" needed to update the robot's software.\nOn his way home with the damaged police robot, he is kidnapped by gang members Ninja, Yolandi, and Amerika. When he mentions that Tetravaal doesn't have remote controls for the police robots, they order him to reprogram the robot instead. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which then responds with childlike trepidation upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm the robot teaching it words and naming it \"Chappie.\" Despite Deon wanting to stay with the robot, Ninja forces him out of their hideout.\nNinja's gang only has a few days to pay a debt of 20 million rand to Hippo. Yolandi sees Chappie as a child and wants to mother him, but Ninja grows impatient with his development due to both the impending deadline for the debt and Chappie's irreplaceable battery running out, giving him days to live. Ninja tries to train Chappie to be a gangster by leaving him in a dangerous neighborhood to fend for himself. After being wounded by thugs, he is followed by Vincent, who plans to deactivate all Tetravaal scouts except for MOOSE. Vincent successfully extracts the guard key for his own use, but the traumatized Chappie escapes and returns to the hideout. Yolandi scolds Ninja for this mistreatment, but he manages to earn Chappie's forgiveness by training him in martial arts and weapon handling. Ninja and Amerika trick Chappie into stealing cars for them, and lie about needing the money to replace his dying body.\nAt Tetravaal, Vincent uses the guard key to upload a virus, thus sabotaging and disabling all scouts including Chappie. Johannesburg's criminals immediately run rampant in the streets and Deon brings Chappie to the Tetravaal factory to fix him. After being restarted, Chappie notices a helmet used to control MOOSE. At the hideout, he re-engineers it to allow him to transfer his consciousness into a computer, so he can change bodies when his current one dies.\nNinja's gang uses Chappie to rob an armored car, an act which is caught on the news, prompting Tetravaal to pursue him. When Chappie learns that Ninja's plan to acquire the body is a lie, he prepares to kill Ninja for betrayal. However, Deon arrives to warn them that Michelle Bradley has ordered that Chappie be destroyed. At that moment, the MOOSE robot (controlled remotely by Vincent) is launched to assassinate Deon and Chappie at the hideout, at the same time that Hippo arrives to collect his debt. Amerika and Hippo are killed in the ensuing battle while Deon is mortally wounded. When Ninja is about to be killed, Yolandi sacrifices herself to save him, and Chappie destroys MOOSE by detonating a bomb.\nEnraged by Yolandi's death, Chappie drives Deon to the factory, storms into an office, and fiercely beats Vincent close to death. He then transfers the dying Deon's consciousness into a spare robot through the modified MOOSE helmet. In return, the now-robotic Deon wirelessly transfers Chappie's consciousness into one of the nearby disabled scouts. Deon and Chappie go into hiding as the police discontinue their contract with Tetravaal, while it is implied that Vincent, assuming he survived, now faces serious criminal charges for his actions.\nWhile burning memorabilia of Yolandi, the grieving Ninja finds a box containing a doll copy of her and a flash drive marked \"Mommy's Consciousness Test Backup\" which contains a copy of Yolandi's consciousness that Chappie took while testing the device on her.

When he leaves on business, Lady Tremaine reveals her cruel and jealous nature, forcing Ella to give up her bedroom to the stepsisters and move into the attic.

The family comprises Arqu\u00edmedes Puccio, the family patriarch; Epifan\u00eda Puccio, his wife; Alejandro, their eldest son and a star rugby player; Daniel \"Maguila\", their middle child, who'd left the country years ago and hadn't kept in touch; Silvia, their eldest daughter, a schoolteacher; Guillermo, their youngest son, who is still in high school; and Adriana, their youngest daughter, who is in middle school.\nAt the end of the Falklands War in 1982, Arqu\u00edmedes, who had been working for the state's intelligence services in operations to capture communist guerrilla fighters, becomes the owner of a small shop, a deli. In order to maintain his financial status, he decides to turn to crime and start kidnapping people for ransom, targeting wealthy families. Alejandro starts to collaborate with his father, by identifying potential hostages, taking advantage of his popularity among friends and acquaintances to not raise suspicion.\nThe first victim is Ricardo Manoukian, a friend and teammate of Alejandro's. Though the kidnapping is successful, Arqu\u00edmedes kills Ricardo anyway, to avoid any chances of being identified as the kidnapper. After discovering Ricardo has been killed, Alejandro has a bout of conscience, but his father convinces him to keep the secret by assuring him that if Ricardo had been left alive, he would have identified them as the culprits and gotten them all arrested.\nThe ransom improves the Puccios' economic situation and, by early 1983, they replace their family deli with a successful store selling sporting equipment. Alejandro meets a girl called Monica at the store, and, after a few dates, she becomes his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Gustavo Contenpomi, a friend of Arqu\u00edmedes' who is furious after being deceived in a business deal with entrepreneur Florencio Aulet, contacts the Puccios and suggests they make Florencio their next victim. Instead, Arqu\u00edmedes and his cronies kidnap Florencio's son, Eduardo; since he is one of Alejandro's friends, and thus he's easier to lure into a trap. The Aulets pay the ransom, but Eduardo has already been murdered, and his body buried in a shallow grave, on an empty construction lot.\nIn December 1983, after the return to democracy in Argentina, Arqu\u00edmedes goes to visit imprisoned military officer An\u00edbal Gordon\u2014who had participated with Puccio in the kidnapping of a businessman in 1973\u2014and asks for advice on how to continue with the Clan's activities in the new political landscape. Gordon advises him to lie low, since the military will have more difficulty protecting him now that they've lost control of the country, but Arqu\u00edmedes does not heed the warning.\nAlejandro accompanies his youngest brother, Guillermo, to the airport, since Guillermo\nis going abroad on a sports trip. At the gate, Guillermo confesses that he knows what Alejandro and their father had been up to and says he will not be returning after the tour is over, since he is afraid of what will happen if the family's crimes are discovered. Before leaving, Guillermo begs his brother to get out while he still can. Listening to his brother's plea, Alejandro decides not to join his father in the next kidnapping: that of another businessman acquainted with the family, Emilio Naum. Due to Alejandro's absence, the plot fails, and Naum is murdered after refusing to stop his car when Arqu\u00edmedes and his goons begin the abduction. Angered, Arqu\u00edmedes returns home and beats Alejandro, blaming him for the failed kidnapping and accusing him of being ungrateful for all that Arqu\u00edmedes sacrificed to get him a cushy lifestyle.\nTo reconcile with his father, Alejandro travels abroad to convince his other brother, Maguila, to return to Argentina and join the Clan in their operations. Now, in 1985, the group kidnaps businesswoman N\u00e9lida Bollini Prado and keep her prisoner in their home's basement. However, things do not go according to plan: the ransom negotiations fail; Adriana hears the woman's screams coming from the basement and realizes what had been going on; and Arqu\u00edmedes gets a call from his former military superiors warning him that his stunts have garnered too much public attention, so he no longer has their protection.\nIn August 1985, when Arqu\u00edmedes and Maguila collect the ransom in a service station, they are arrested by the police, who then break into the Puccio house, free the kidnapped victim, and arrest the family, with the exception of Adriana. The case causes a frenzy among the media, who dub the family the \"Puccio Clan\".\nThe prosecuting attorney shows Arqu\u00edmedes the overwhelming evidence against him and tries to broker a deal: if Arqu\u00edmedes confesses to being the mastermind behind the kidnappings, his family will not be indicted as accomplices. Arqu\u00edmedes, however, insists that he'd been compelled to carry out the crimes by his military superiors and refuses to sacrifice himself for his family.\nWhile his rugby team and Monica believe in his innocence, Alejandro cannot withstand the pressure. After violently arguing with his father in their jail cell (during which Arqu\u00edmedes goads Alejandro to punch him, so Arqu\u00edmedes can falsely claim the guards beat him), Alejandro tries to commit suicide by throwing himself off the fifth floor of the Tribunal building while he is being taken to testify.\nThe film ends with a series of texts detailing the family's fate: \n\nAlejandro survived his fall and was sentenced to life in prison. While serving his sentence, he tried to commit suicide four more times. Monica kept visiting him for years, until he asked her to stop doing so and instead move on with her life. Alejandro died [of pneumonia, aged 49] in 2008, a few months after being released on probation.\nMaguila never served his sentence, since he fled the country - presumably to Australia, Brazil, or New Zealand - before he could be tried.

Penny is reluctant to follow the plan. The three walk into the school undetected, and announce to their secretary, Christina Cook (Jillette Dayton), their plan. They take her hostage, and when David starts harshly yelling at a student, Penny confronts him. Instead of shooting her like he had earlier threatened, he gets his car keys and throws them at her, commanding her to leave, saying she is no daughter of his.\nAfter Penny leaves, David and Doris take three people (two staff, one student) into Room 4, where David takes control of a class being held in the room. Doris then manipulates the rest of the school to go into Room 4, telling them \"a surprise\" waits for them. Once all 136 students and 18 teachers are in the room, David establishes control by explaining his rules, then sitting next to the bomb; if he pulls the trigger, it will detonate. He shows off his firearms and explains he\u2019ll kill children with a .22 because they\u2019re innocent, while his .45 is reserved for teachers.\nAfter a few minutes, Max Excell (Alan Peterson), the school principal who had been away, walks in and discovers the situation.

After the principal returns, David demands him to call the White House.\nDuring the next few hours, the teachers create a \"magic square\" of masking tape on the floor where only David is allowed to go. The square serves as a boundary between the bomb and the children. Around this time, David is getting more and more agitated especially when Jason Hartley taunts him. When Jason puts his foot inside the magic square, David loses control and yells at Jason, who doesn\u2019t flinch.

Ron doubts this but Claudia believes him after Jason points out a picture of his great-grandmother, who had passed away years earlier, saying she was his angel in the classroom. Ron questions this so Claudia convinces him to gather evidence just as he would for any other investigation.\nHe visits multiple families who inform him of similar stories from their children. He visits the investigating certified bomb expert, Rich Haskell (Rick Macy), from Sherrif's office in Rock Springs, who tells him that three of the five wires in the bomb were mysteriously cut; not broken, but cut clean. Haskell also mentions that the open windows and doors provided ventilation for the explosion. He is baffled that the shrapnel David put in the explosive was thrown around the room but no one was injured by it. Ron later tells Claudia that he found out every one of the hostages prayed some time during the crisis, and that some ran back into the room to help others. Despite all this information, Ron is reluctant to believe it.\nOn Sunday, Jason refuses to attend church unless his dad does so as well. Motivated to attend for Jason, Ron tries to make it through the meetings. But after the main meeting, Ron's doubts start to control him again and he tells Claudia that he can't do it. She tells him that he needs to control it or he could lose her and their children. Ron then overhears some words the bishop, John Teichart (Shawn Stevens), is saying in a class. He says that hatred will not be the answer but prayer will. Ron then goes to the youth room where they are singing \"A Child's Prayer\". He notices that almost all of the kids in the room have some injuries of some kind, and he becomes humble and asks God for forgiveness for doubting Him.

Before his death, fellow former football player Justin Strzelczyk confides in Webster that he is suffering from memory loss, is saying odd things to his children, and nearly threw his wife against the wall. Webster deliriously responds by reciting from his Hall of Fame induction speech, that the most important thing \"is to finish the game\".\nBennet Omalu (Will Smith), a forensic pathologist with the Allegheny County, Pennsylvania coroner's office, handles Webster's autopsy. Wondering how an otherwise healthy man could have degenerated so quickly, he closely examines microscope slides of Webster's brain, seeing evidence of severe neurotrauma. He concludes that Webster died as a result of the long-term effects of repeated blows to the head, a disorder he terms chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).\nWith the help of former Steelers team doctor Julian Bailes, fellow neurologist Steven DeKosky and county coroner Cyril Wecht, Omalu publishes his findings in Neurosurgery, which are dismissed by the NFL. In subsequent years, Omalu discovers that Strzelczyk and two other deceased NFL players, Terry Long and Andre Waters, exhibited symptoms very similar to Webster's. \nOmalu persuades newly appointed NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to allow him to present his findings before a player safety committee, but he is barred from the committee meeting, forcing former NFL employee Bailes to the presentation in his place. The NFL does not take the findings seriously and claim the players' head trauma is unrelated to football. Former NFL Players Association executive Dave Duerson angrily confronts Omalu and tells him to \"go back to Africa.\"\nOmalu is subjected to considerable pressure to back down from his efforts, as football is a widely beloved sport in Pittsburgh, providing jobs and college opportunities. Wecht is subject to a politically motivated prosecution on corruption charges, and Omalu is threatened with deportation and a prison sentence on petty charges as punishment for tarnishing the NFL's image. His wife, Prema, suffers a miscarriage after being followed in her car. The Omalus are forced to leave their dream home outside Pittsburgh, relocating to Lodi, California where he takes a job with the San Joaquin County coroner's office.\nThree years later, Omalu is vindicated when Duerson commits suicide due to his inability to cope with worsening cognitive function. In his suicide note, he acknowledges Omalu was right, and offers his brain for future research. The doctor is invited to address an NFLPA conference on concussions and CTE. He says that he once wished he had never known Mike Webster, but by knowing him, he has the responsibility to inform NFL players of the true risks they take by playing. He says that he holds no resentment for the NFL and tells them to forgive themselves and be at peace.\nAmid growing scrutiny from Congress, the NFL is forced to take the concussion issue more seriously, and in 2011, NFL players sue the league for not properly informing them of the risk of CTE. Dr. Omalu is offered the job of Chief Medical Examiner for the District of Columbia, but Omalu turned the offer down to remain with his family in Lodi, becoming naturalized as a U.S. citizen in February 2015.

He mentions that Robert Cochrane \u2018founded a Wicca coven as recently as the 1960s\u2019, and that his coven split up, but later reformed and met in the nearby Queens Wood at the titular coven, a particular ring of trees. He is interrupted by a Mrs. Belial, posing as a supply teacher who tells him that he needs to see the headmaster. He leaves and she takes over the lesson. She explains how there was a spiritual leader and politico, Uri Clef who went missing on Halloween with seven of his followers, and they were last thought to be in Queen\u2019s Wood.\nFive of the girls decide to go into the Queens Wood on Halloween, on the way they are involved in a near miss with a biker while crossing a road. They enter the wood and discover the word Lucifer in ash upon the ground. They notice that their five names have first letters that are the letters of Lucifer.

They bid farewell to their acquaintances and the citizens of Kasukabe in tears. Shinchan heard that Mexican young girls are stylish and beautiful and became eager for this journey.\nOn arriving at Madakueruyobaka city in Mexico, a new life full of anxiety, surrounded by unique neighbours awaits them.\nBut Shinnosuke and Nohara family had no idea that flesh-eating killer cactuses are going to attack.\nNow it is up to Nohara family along with the neighbours of Mexico to overcome this trouble.In Mexico, in the town of Madakueruyobaka (fictional place), a new species of cactus was discovered. From the bud of the cactus, delicious and sweet honey could be made. Futaba Shouji, the company where Hiroshi worked, had put an eye on this. The company saw this as a business opportunity; it wanted to import and sell this commodity in Japan and outside. So, the company decided to open a branch office in Madakueruyobaka. Hiroshi was made the president of the Madaukeruyobaka branch, and was ordered transfer to Mexico.\nHiroshi had initially decided to go alone. But his wife Misae strongly opposed this. She argued that it would hamper the growth of their children, and said that a family is useless if it is not together. So it was decided that Hiroshi would move to Mexico with his family together.\nAt Futaba Kindergarten, Miss Yoshinaga announced that Shinnosuke would be leaving Kasukabe and moving to Mexico, which shocked everyone. All the Kasukabe Defense Group members expressed sorrow, except Kazama-kun who pretended that he's not sad and remained calm. Ai-chan, who has a crush on Shin-chan, cried for him.\nShinchan realized that he would separated from Nanako. He said that, \"I will remain in Kasukabe. I shall marry Nanako and live in Kasukabe\". But when Shinnosuke was told that Mexican girls are beautiful and glamorous, he decided to go.\nNohara family packed their belongings, and their house appeared empty. They felt sad and nostalgic for leaving their house full of memories. Their luggage was transported before their actual departure.\nOn the day of leaving, all the people of Kasukabe came together to bid farewell to the Nohara family. The Kasukabe Defense Group had come with a KB (Kasukabe Boueitai) badge, and gave it to Shinnkosuke. They said that, \"Wherever in the world you go, if you have this badge, you shall remain a Kasukabe Boueitai member\". All members except Kazama-kun had arrived. Even the Saitama Red Scorpions, who considered Shin-chan a nuisance, had come.\nThe Nohara family took a taxi to Kasukabe station. From the station, they boarded a train to the International Airport. When the train moved, in the middle of a dry river, Kazama was seen running behind. Shinnosuke and Kazama both called each other's names, with tears, and Kazama still running behind the train. Finally they lifted their KB badge together and waved goodbye.\nAt the airport, Hiroshi was amazed at the speed of the airport crew. Huge aeroplanes could be seen landing and taking off. They boarded their flight to Mexico.\nThey finally arrived at Mexico. They stayed at the seaside resort, and took a long-distance bus to Madakueruyobaka. On reaching, they saw that it is a small and remote town, cut-off from the big cities, and isolated. From there, they meet Jos\u00e9, the only employee from the Futaba Shouji's Mexico branch. Jos\u00e9 couldn't speak Japanese, except for few words and phrases. From his dialogue \"zenzen daijoubu\" (totally fine), Hiroshi and others mistook that he is fluent in Japanese. He took them to their new house. In the pamphlet given by the company, the house looked gorgeous and nice. But when they reached there, they saw that the house was only halfway made with brick walls and windows, looking tattered. They had to accept it, looking at the body language of Jos\u00e9.\nNohara family begin their new life in Mexico. They quickly adapted to the surroundings. They adjusted to Mexican food, which was very different from their own Japanese food. They learnt Spanish, so as to be understood by the locals. They even wore the traditional Mexico attire.\nShinnosuke went to the local kindergarten, where he is smitten with his curvaceous teacher Carolina.\nOn the way, Shin-chan encountered a girl who was always busy with her smartphone. When he spoke to her, she ignored him and said, \"Don't touch my phone, you potato-head\". Shinnosuke named her \"Sumaho-chan\", though her real name was Fransisca.\nThe family also encountered two interesting locals. One was Nene Rodriguez, a masked professional Luchador wrestler. The other person was Mariachi, a man who loved singing and always played the guitar.\nThis town, in the old days, was poor in industry and many people had left in search of work. But thanks to the cactus, the town seemed to escape from crisis. The Mayor wanted to further develop the town and attempted to harvest and sell only to the locals. When Hiroshi met the Mayor to negotiate, he refused. He said that many outsiders are attracted to the sweet nectar of the cactus. He refused to sell the cactuses or permit business.\nMeanwhile, in the square with the new cactus, a cactus festival was held. Shinnosuke wanted to dance with Carolina, so he insisted Hiroshi to take him to the festival. Everyone in the festival was having a nice time.\nThere was a huge cactus which was about to bloom. The people including the Mayor were waiting for it to flower. But immediately after blooming, it turns into a giant killer cactus. From this giant Queen Cactus, small killer cactuses were generated. They started swallowing the people one after the other. All the terrified people started running, with the cactuses chasing them and eating them up. The town was getting destroyed.\nThe cactus researcher, Ikegamino, said that cactuses have a strong regenerative power and it would be difficult to destroy them.\nNohara family including some residents, fled to one of the nearby bars. Hiroshi suggested that they should run out of the town, but no one cooperated fearing that they would be attacked by cactuses. At the bar they drank cola; there was no milk for Himawari. So Hiroshi decided to get some from the closest supermarket. Sumaho-chan accompanied him, in order to get a charger for her smartphone. But when they returned, the killer cactus also reached the bar and started eating people. So they had to escape again.\nMeanwhile, their dog Shiro was left behind in their house in the town. Shiro bravely saved some stray dogs from the cactus attack.\nHiroshi bought a bus from the bus stop and the residents boarded it. But they got eaten up even on the way. The person who were alive were the Nohara family, the Mayor, Carolina, Fransisca, Nene Rodriguez, Mariachi and the Nihon Erekiteru Union. The Nihon Erekiteru Union is a comedy group of Japan, consisting of Hosogai-san and Akemi-chan. Hosogai-san was an officer and Akemi-chan was Chibikko. On the bus, they both got soon eaten up by cactuses. Chibikko said her famous lines \"Dame yo, Dame Dame\" (No, no), before getting eaten. The rest fought with the cactus. The bridge which lead out of the town was occupied by killer cactuses, so they had to turn back. Shinnosuke discovered that cactuses hit people by responding to sound. But soon the bus driver got eaten up and the bus crashed onto a mountain.\nAt the suggestion of the Mayor, the survivors escaped into the Cactus amusement park nearby. The park was still under construction. There was no food available. So they decided that they had no choice but to leave the town. But the Mayor was strongly opposed to this. They discovered dynamite in the prefabricated hut for construction workers. They made a plan to blow up the cactus in the town. The Mayor was again opposed to blow up cactus in the town. So they decided to blow the cactus outside the town. They tied dynamite to a vehicle called \"Cactus Car\", and from the nature of cactuses reacting to sound, the strategy was to take the cactus out of the town and blow them across the bridge. When the cactus followed the vehicle, a fruit of the cactus fell down. The tempted Mayor went to pick up the fruit but fell down and by mistake changed the direction of the vehicle. As a result, the vehicle blew up on the bridge itself. Thus, the only exit of the city was collapsed.\nThe cactus started attacking again. In order to escape, Hiroshi and Misae wandered. Shinnosuke and Mayor were left together. They planned to go back to the town to get food. The Mayor talks about the reconstruction of the town to Shinnosuke. According to him, Madakueruyobaka was a poor countryside town and he grew up in this town. Now since many people have left, the town is deserted like nothing. So he intends to use this new cactus species to revitalize the town.\nShinnosuke ate the food that was passed from the Mayor and wanted to have a pee. But it was forbidden by Mayor's law to stand and pee on the roads. So, he had to go into the fields to pee. While peeing, a small killer cactus came near him. Shinnosuke peed on the cactus. To his surprise, the cactus got wrinkled and died. He wondered if pee was the weakness of the cactus. He told this thing to the Mayor, who was still busy thinking of his revitalization plan. Then they all realized that the weakness of cactus is water.\nThey decided to defeat the killer cactus using water. But there was shortage of water in the city. At the suggestion of Carolina and Francisca, they decided to use the water of the water supply tank on Chichideka mountain. The Mayor was again opposed to use the water from the tank, but had to give up this time. He let out his anger on Sumaho-chan. Hiroshi's plan was to inject water into a playing balloon called \"Sabo-chan\", and throw it at the Queen Cactus.\nThe action started with the day after sunrise. The \"Madakueruyobaka Defense Group\" was formed. The Queen Cactus had grown into a huge monster. They were likely to be attacked during water injection, so someone had to play the role of decoy. Mariachi was chosen as the decoy and he asked help from Rainbow Kamen in fear. In their dedication, water was able to get filled in the Sabo-chan balloon. But suddenly the Queen Cactus which was stationary began to move, and attacked Mariachi and Rainbow Kamen. The Mayor could see his town getting destroyed. In order to help Mariachi and Rainbow Kamen, the hitherto uncooperative Mayor himself became the decoy. While he was busy distracting the cactus, Hiroshi rolled the water-filled Sabo-chan balloon down the mountain and it was thrown at the Queen Cactus. The balloon was supposed to be burst by the thorns of the cactus and water was supposed to spout. But, the Queen Cactus guarded the balloon with its tentacles which had no thorn and it didn't burst.\nSo, Shinnosuke took out the needle of the KB badge which he was wearing. Kazama-kun had made the needle as a safety pin of the KB badge. Shinnosuke had almost forgotten about its existence; and it proved to be very helpful at the right time. Then Shinnosuke ran with the needle in hand, jumped and pierced the balloon with it. The balloon got burst, with water spouting all over. The Queen cactus got exhausted, was defeated and got disappeared. Also, all  people which it had swallowed were alive and came out. The botanist Ikegamino gave the reason that carnivorous plants take time to digest the things they eat.\nPeace returned to town and the Cactus Festival resumed. Shinnosuke was able to dance with Carolina which he had been waiting since long. The species of new cactus was never seen again. So, the Mexico branch of Futaba Shouji was shut down, and Hiroshi was recalled back to the headquarters in Japan. Everyone happily enjoyed at the Cactus Land amusement park.\nMeanwhile, in Japan, Kazama received an international mail from Shinnosuke. There he had stated that since the new cactus doesn't exist anymore, they would be returning home soon. Kazama was overjoyed on reading this.\nFinally the Nohara family returned to Kasukabe after their adventure in Mexico."}, "45502438": {"title": "Crazy Beautiful You", "plot": "Jackie (Kathryn Bernardo) is a troubled, nineteen-year-old wild child, much to the dismay of her separated parents.

Under the terms of his house arrest, he is not allowed visits from unaccompanied minors nor is he allowed access to his computer (which has been confiscated by the authorities) or the internet. His I.P. address has been tagged so as to alert authorities if he attempts to access any social media.  As his mother is away on business, he is alone in the house. Daniel's parole officer, Stokes (Peter Stormare), explains that Daniel's monitoring tag will go off if he goes past the edge of the front lawn. If he does not retreat within five seconds, he will be arrested. Daniel mentions hearing of someone under house arrest who cut off their foot to get the monitoring tag off so they could flee to Mexico.\nDespite the restrictions placed on Daniel, his friends Abby Feller and Kevin Dowdle visit and bring him a tablet so that he can access a neighbor's internet connection and Skype his mother. As the three converse by the pool, it is rather clear that Abby has a crush on her friend Daniel. Daniel explains that he wasn't interested in Mona but then developed an obsession - virtually overnight.\nWhen he is about to Skype his mother, Abby contacts him instead. After a brief conversation, he receives an incoming Skype call from Mona, who commits suicide by gunshot on camera.\nFollowing this incident, Daniel becomes more and more paranoid, and keeps seeing Mona in the house. Daniel and his friends attempt a seance to contact the spirit of Mona. The idea is that by each holding pens, Mona will communicate with them. Instead, Daniel and Kevin stab Abby through the hand with their pens. She is then lifted up and dragged across the wall. Afterwards, we see the blood from her injured hand spells out 'Daniel' on the wall.\nAfter more supernatural events, Abby and Kevin head over to the dead girl's house. They are looking for a personal item of Mona's they can use as part of a ritual to help her move on to the afterlife. When they arrive at the house, they find it empty. They break in and, guided by Daniel who has a blueprint of the house, they head to Mona's room which is bare apart from a blood-stained mattress (from Mona shooting herself). They realize, with Daniel's help, that there is a false wall at the back of a closet which leads to a secret room which contains a number of strange artifacts and a large number of photos of Daniel; Mona was stalking Daniel, not the other way around. One of the items they find has a strange symbol embossed on it. Daniel finds out what it is and uses the name of the symbol as the password to Mona's cloud account. There he finds a folder called 'Daniel' which contains a spell.\nIt turns out that Mona secretly had a crush on Daniel, and had been obsessively stalking him for a long time. She put a spell on Daniel to make him fall in love with her. It worked, but he was too shy to contact her, so Mona used a second spell so that her spirit could enter into Daniel's body alongside his own spirit so they would be together. There are five steps to the spell, the first of which was Mona's suicide. They realize that if all the steps are not completed by Daniel, the spell will fail. Abby therefore takes the last step, hoping that this will break the spell. However, Abby has already unwittingly carried out the previous steps of the spell so performing the last step brings Mona's spirit into her body. While they are cleaning up after the failed seance, Mona, now possessing Abby, kills Kevin and knocks Daniel out. Gagging him with duct tape, she then cuts off Daniel's leg so she can remove his house arrest monitor and abduct him without notice. When Stokes visits, he sees the severed leg on the floor and just thinks Daniel has absconded, as he described when he was first fitted with the tag.\nIn a post-credits scene, Abby, still possessed by Mona's spirit, is seen driving a gagged Daniel out of town while he lets out muffled screams.", "tmdb_id": 306969}, "48832093": {"title": "Darling (2015 American film)", "plot": "The film takes place over six chapters.", "tmdb_id": 352372}, "43629708": {"title": "Darling (2015 Indian film)", "plot": "Kathir, Nisha and Kumaran plan to commit suicide together because they feel like failures.

Though his wife is distraught that he is returning again to Peru, Oliver tells her he must close the deal or all of their previous sacrifices will be for nothing.  Oliver recruits Ricardo to research Caravedo.  After Oliver aggressively pressures the Peruvian finance minister to repay debts, Ricardo walks away from the Caravedo deal.

Meanwhile, Diego breaks his leg while finding the llama.  Oliver arrives at Florentino's farm just after Florentino finds his injured son.  As Oliver prepares to take Diego to the hospital on horseback, Oliver offers him a deal: agree to sell his land in return for Oliver's help in getting a helicopter to airlift Diego.  Florentino reluctantly accepts.  Dr. Cerr\u00f3n tells Maria the surgeon scheduled for Gloria's operation can only help one of the two, Diego or Gloria; Dr. Cerr\u00f3n leaves the decision in Maria's hands, and she chooses Gloria.\nOliver is called to identify Ricardo's dead body.

Realising Ashwini is addicted to Bhuvan's custom paan blend, Byomkesh takes a chew and euphorically creates a mural of his understanding of the entire case, revealing Sikdaar said the words \u201cYoung Gun\u201d to him before dying. The next morning, Byomkesh tests the mixture and his own blood; while his blood contains heroin, the paan is clean, making him deduce that Bhuvan had created an \"untraceable\" formula. Byomkesh learns from Kanai Dao, a fellow lodge resident and licensed opium dealer, that the opium supply in the local areas has been halted, and asks him if he can help Byomkesh meet any heroin suppliers. However, Kanai turns out to be a police informer and turns Byomkesh and Ajit into Deputy Commissioner Wilkie. Wilkie tells Byomkesh about Yang Guang, a former Green Gang leader who wanted Calcutta's opium business for himself and was killed in retaliation but reportedly survived; Byomkesh realises Sikdaar was referring to him.\nByomkesh discovers the drawing actually depicts the course of the Ganges through Calcutta and Sukumar's campaign points. With Kanai's help, Byomkesh meets with the Green Gang, where they realise Yang had and set a deal with the Japanese to use opium smuggling routes to invade Calcutta by surprise on Basant Panchami, in turn giving Yang control over the city's drug trade. Byomkesh also realizes that Anguri Devi is Yang's lover, who she has not met in 4 years, and she had killed Sikdaar and attempted to seduce Byomkesh on his orders while being unaware of Yang's deal with the Japanese. With the attack scheduled for the next day, Byomkesh meets Wilkie and requests him to set off all the air raid sirens at four in the morning, but Wilkie refuses, and Kanai defects to Byomkesh for saving him from the Green Gang. Byomkesh requests Dr. Guha, Satyavati, Sukumar and Dr. Watanabe to meet him at the lodge, pretending to have joined them and claiming they have been betrayed. At the lodge, he reveals Dr. Guha is Yang Guang, conned the idealistic Sukumar into his deal, and plans to make Calcutta the drug capital of the world. Byomkesh states he informed the authorities about the landing points, but Yang claims he is bluffing. Anguri Devi attempts to dissuade Yang, nearly shooting him, but he shows affection to draw her in before stabbing her. The air raid sirens are set off; using this, Byomkesh convinces Watanabe to leave and stop the attack to save his men. The Green Gang, having secretly observed the proceedings with Kanai's help, attack Yang.\nByomkesh informs a panicking Satyavati that he was indeed bluffing before being struck unconscious in the chaos. Regaining consciousness, Byomkesh is told by Ajit that the Green Gang has taken Yang. Byomkesh asks Satyavati to marry him, to which she smiles in reply. Meanwhile, the Green Gang's blinded leader orders his son to blind Yang in revenge at an abandoned factory, but Yang purposely blinds himself with the poker to turn the tables and kill the gang instead, planning the same for Byomkesh.

He plans to spend time with his \"uncle\" Tang Ren (Wang Baoqiang), who is reputed to be the number one detective of Chinatown in Bangkok. Tang Ren turns out to be a sleazy petty swindler who is an underling of incompetent police sergeant Kon Tai (Xiao Yang). Meanwhile, the main suspect in a gold robbery case, Sompat, is murdered and the gold goes missing. The gold belongs to prominent local gangster Mr. Yan (Chin Shih-chieh). Kon Tai and his ambitious rival Huang Landeng (Chen He), are put into competition by the police chief to solve the case and retrieve the gold in order to be appointed the next deputy chief.\nAfter a series of mischievous adventures with Qin in Bangkok, Tang is pursued by police as he is the main suspect in Sompat's murder, being the last person to enter and leave Sompat's workshop where he was murdered. Tang seeks the help of Qin, who turns out to be a prodigy in solving crimes. During their exodus from the pursuit, Qin and Tang are captured by Sompat's cohorts who wish to locate the lost gold. Qin and Tang, now wanted criminals, are able to escape and hide in the home of Xiang (Tong Liya), Tang's beautiful landlady. However, they are followed by the gold robbers, who arrive just before Kon and then Huang, leading to an awkward confrontation between all parties.\nQin later finds out why Tang is implicated: on the day of the murder, Tang received a call asking him to deliver a boxed Buddha statue from Sompat's workshop at midnight. The pair, deciding to stay in Thailand rather than flee, goes to the parking lot where Tang delivered the box. Qin finds a trace of fish in the area, after which they go to a nearby seafood market and a junk yard. That night, Qin and Tang searches the workshop, narrowly avoiding an encounter with the robbers. Qin deduces that Huang Landeng's assistant, Tony, is part of the scheme.\nTo solve the murder, Qin and Tang must watch the surveillance footage of the workshop. As it is kept in Huang's computer, Tang lures the police force away while Qin and Kon retrieve the footage and other documents about Sompat. After translating the documents, Qin finds that Sompat's son went missing a year prior and that Sompat frequented a caf\u00e9. Following the trail, Qin and Tang are led to Snow (Zhang Zifeng), who was a school classmate of Sompat's son.\nQin and Tang are soon captured and led to Mr. Yan, who gives them 3 days to find the stolen gold. Qin and Tang split up, with Qin meeting Snow for a second time and Tang being pursued again by Huang. Qin discovers that Snow's stepfather works at the junk yard near the parking lot, making him a suspect.\nQin and Tang rejoin at the workshop, where they hypothesize that the murderer hid in the workshop for one week (As the surveillance footage overrides itself after a week), killed Sompat before Tang's delivery, and escaped the workshop by hiding in the box Tang delivered. They are suddenly ambushed by the masked murderer, who sets the workshop on fire. Qin and Tang narrowly escape.\nAfter learning that Xiang is kidnapped by Tony, Qin and Tang confront and defeat him. The pair delivers Xiang to the hospital, where they witness a shootout between the police and the other three robbers. Qin and Tang return to Snow's home yet again, but find that she has overdosed and is on the verge of death. After delivering Snow to the hospital, Qin finds the story behind the murder in Snow's journal. Snow was raped by Sompat, which her stepfather found out, leading him to kill Sompat. The gold robbery and the murder are unrelated.\nAfter a car chase around Bangkok, Qin and Tang finally reveal to the police that the lost gold was hidden in a statue at the workshop. At the hospital where Snow resides, Qin and Tang convey their findings to the police in the presence of Snow and her stepfather. After being exposed, the stepfather is killed by Kon's car when he jumps out of the hospital window. Kon is subsequently promoted to deputy chief due to his prevention of the murderer's escape, to the annoyance of a severely injured Huang.\nHowever, Qin soon realizes that Sompat was homosexual, meaning he did not rape Snow. He realizes that Snow was stalked by Sompat because he suspected her of killing his missing son. Thus, Snow planned Sompat's murder, framed him for rape in her journal, and fabricated the evidence to get rid of both Sompat and her pervert stepfather, whom she loathed.

It is set entirely in the backstage area (and briefly, the main stage) of a London playhouse during the Blitz.\nIt opens with a meeting between Norman and Sir's (apparent) wife, \"Her Ladyship\", in Sir's dressing room following a difficult visit to Sir in hospital. At Her Ladyship's frantic behest, Norman explains the events which had led to Sir's admission. He had discovered Sir wandering the streets of London during an air raid: his erratic behaviour, including trampling his hat and coat and making a public spectacle, induced Norman to take him to the hospital, despite his being scheduled for a performance of King Lear that evening. Norman regrets this, while Her Ladyship, concerned for Sir's ability to perform, considers cancelling the performance on account of illness. Norman, who has been with Sir as his dresser for nearly thirty years, and has never seen his company cancel a performance, pleads with Her Ladyship and company stage manager Madge (Sarah Lancashire) to postpone the cancellation and allow him to visit Sir in the hospital. As he begs, Sir reappears in his dressing room, having \"discharged himself\" from medical care.\nSir insists that he be allowed to prepare for the evening's performance, to the shock and dismay of Her Ladyship and Madge. Obviously exhausted, and approaching senility or dementia, the elderly Sir views each performance as essential to his reputation as a respected classical actor. Sir begins to prepare between bouts of amnesia and jealous weeping, accidentally blackening himself for the role of Othello instead of King Lear and forgetting the lines which begin the play; meanwhile, Norman attempts to defuse his flaring temper with silliness and reminiscing. Her Ladyship and Madge both attempt to check in on Sir, but Norman refuses to let them enter. Various members of the company, whose numbers have been dwindling with the loss of so many young actors to the war in Europe, appear for Sir's appraisal, including the pretty young actress Irene (Vanessa Kirby) toward whom Sir behaves inappropriately; demure and miscast Thornton (Edward Fox) in the role of Fool; and the standoffish Oxenby as Edmund, who refuses to \"muck in\" and assist with offstage production activities. Sir attempts to write in his memoirs without success.\nThe performance finally begins, as the sheepish but obviously attention-hungry Norman makes a fool of himself in his curtain speech warning of the air raid. As the play approaches Sir's first entrance, it is unclear whether he will be physically able to perform; however, after initially missing his cue, he begins a passionate, inspired performance of the play's most important speeches. Oxenby begrudgingly assists with the backstage sounds for the storm scene, while Norman plainly relishes any role given to him in the running of the production.\nDuring the interval, Sir returns exhausted to his dressing room while Norman congratulates him and prepares him to sleep until his next entrance; however, Her Ladyship enters and awakens him, imploring him to retire from the stage following the performance. Sir refuses, and Her Ladyship laments his self-centred, egotistical nature and her own choice to live in his shadow. It is revealed that Sir refused to divorce his first wife for Her Ladyship because he hoped to retain eligibility for a knighthood. She threatens to leave the company and Sir forever, but Sir pleads for her not to go; when it becomes apparent Her Ladyship has relented, he turns malicious and belittles her hopes for a life outside his shadow. After she leaves, Irene attempts to enter, but Sir has her summon Madge, to whom he tells his wishes for his press clippings of theatrical reviews for his career, and to whom he gives an heirloom ring from actor Edmund Kean. Madge reveals she has loved Sir since her time at the company began, which Sir uses to assuage his wounded ego. Irene then enters, and Sir makes a sexual advance after signing a photograph for her. Norman returns and jealously listens through the door. Sir takes Irene in his arms as he would Cordelia, then casts her off; as Irene exits, Norman accosts her about what occurred, but Irene refuses to divulge any information. Norman expels her from the company, against the authority of Sir.\nThe play resumes, and Sir continues his exceptional performance.

Thornton appears and expresses his joy at having played the principal role of Fool, extemporising on the opportunity theatre offers to even older actors. Sir becomes distant and withdrawn, dismissing Norman's attempts at cheer and preparation for the next night's performance of Richard III. Her Ladyship appears to say a spiteful goodnight, followed by Oxenby, who diminishes Sir's authority in the company. Sir becomes distraught, and Norman's attempts to comfort Sir as he lies down to sleep are largely ignored. Norman asserts that he is \"never despairing,\" and claims to be unconcerned about his own legacy, in contrast to Sir. Sir asks Norman to read aloud the dedication to his memoirs, which contain dedications to Her Ladyship and the \"spirit of all actors and those who do the work of the theatre ... and the memory of William Shakespeare\"; as Norman does so, Sir dies. Norman slowly realises this, and becomes distraught and spiteful towards Sir, who has failed to mention him in the dedications. He calls for Madge, who is tender with Sir's remains. While Madge telephones Her Ladyship to give her the news, Norman secretly adds \"dressers\" to the list of dedications. Norman is obviously contemptuous and expresses cowardice about his own future. As Madge begins to leave in tears, Norman claims he \"wouldn't give [Sir] a good character in a court of law.\" The two scrap, and Madge leaves distraught; Norman is left alone with Sir's body.

His mother encourages him, while his father discourages him. As a teen, Eddie gives up his dream of participating in the Summer Games in favour of skiing in the Winter Games. Although skilled at the sport, he is rejected by British Olympic officials for being uncouth. Realising he could make the team as a ski jumper (a sport which the United Kingdom has not participated in for six decades), Eddie decamps to a training facility in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, where the more seasoned jumpers belittle him.\nEddie self-trains, and after successfully completing the 15-metre (49 ft) hill on his first try, he injures himself on his first attempt at a 40-metre (130 ft) slope. Alcoholic snow groomer Bronson Peary advises Eddie to give up, but Eddie's tenacious spirit and a shared sense of being an outsider convince Bronson to train Eddie. Peary is an American former champion ski jumper who left the sport after a conflict with his mentor, Warren Sharp, as Eddie learns from Petra, a cafe owner who takes him in. With very little time to qualify for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Eddie and Bronson employ various unorthodox methods to refine Eddie's form, and he successfully completes the 40m jump. \nTo qualify for the British Olympic division in ski jumping, Eddie must complete a jump from a 70-metre (230 ft) hill. He manages to land the jump successfully, with a distance of 34 metres (112 ft), thus earning a place on the British Olympic Team. In an effort to keep Eddie from sullying the Winter Games with his amateurish skillset, the officials change their criteria and demand that he jump at least 61 metres (200 ft). Eddie decides to continue training and performs on a circuit, his jumps increasing in length each time.\nWhile practicing for the final event before the cutoff date for qualification, Eddie lands a 61m jump exactly, but misses the mark on his official jump and is disqualified. Eddie is about to return home to work with his father when he receives a letter stating that his qualifying practice jump is valid. Bronson advises Eddie wait until the 1992 games and train for the next four years to give himself a better chance of winning a medal, concerned that he will embarrass himself and his country if he goes ahead, but Eddie is undeterred.\nUpon arriving in Calgary, Eddie is scorned by the other British competitors, who get him drunk so that he fails to attend the opening ceremonies. Despite finishing last in the 70m jump with 60.5 metres (198 ft), Eddie sets a British record. His triumphant celebrations win the audience over, and the media embrace him as Eddie \"The Eagle\". Over the phone, Bronson criticizes Edwards for not taking the sport seriously. Edwards publicly apologises for his behavior and, wanting to ensure he does not leave the games without recognition, he enters the 90-metre (300 ft) jump, which he has never attempted before. Bronson now travels to the games to support him.\nAfter an encouraging conversation with his idol Matti \"The Flying Finn\" Nyk\u00e4nen on the lift to the top of the hill, Eddie miraculously lands a 71.5-metre (235 ft) jump. Once again, he comes last in the event, but is nonetheless cheered by the audience and TV viewers worldwide, which earns him recognition in the closing speech of the President of the Organising Committee for the Olympic Games, Frank King.

Karamakate prolongs his life, blasting white powder called \"the sun's semen\" (possibly a hallucinogenic made from virola) up his nose, but is reluctant to become involved with a westerner and refuses his money. Theo is searching for yakruna as the only cure for his disease and the three set off in the canoe to search for it.\nMany years later an American botanist, Evan, paddles up to a much older Karamakate who has apparently forgotten the customs of his own people. Evan says he is hoping to complete Theo's quest and Karamakate does assist, again reluctantly, saying his knowledge is spent. Evan has a book of Theo's final trek, which his aide had sent back to Europe, as he did not survive the jungle. The book includes an image of Karamakate, which he refers to as his chullachaqui, a native term for hollow spirit. Karamakate agrees to help him only when Evan describes himself as someone who has devoted himself to plants, although Evan's real purpose is actually to secure disease-free rubber trees, since the United States' supplies of rubber from South East Asia had dwindled due to the Japanese wartime advance.\nBoth expeditions feature a Spanish Catholic Mission by the side of an Amazon tributary, run in 1909 by a sadistic, lone Spanish priest who beats orphan boys for any \"pagan\" behaviour, and in 1940 by a delusional Brazilian figure who believes he is the Messiah.

She tries to convince him to sign documents to obtain a \u20ac300,000 payout. He refuses, sensing his claim could be worth much more. He is correct: the loss adjusters receive a video of the accident and know he could win in a court case.\nOn a second visit, he scares and exhilarates her driving his specially adapted truck. The ethics of Florence's employer are called into question when her boss asks her to get his signature as soon as possible, using any approach. She returns, casually dressed and tries to befriend Marc, offering him a CD of music he had playing on the last visit. She reveals she was once a pianist, but quit after failing a crucial exam. He convinces her to ride his horse - initially terrified, she soon loves the experience.\nHome with her husband and two children, she begins to experience doubts about her life and relationship, thinking fondly of Marc. Marc meanwhile tries to mount his horse using a knotted rope and upper body strength, but panics and is knocked unconscious and taken to hospital. In a dream scene, he is seen stunt-riding a white horse along a beach. He makes a recovery and mounts his horse again, with more success and an adapted saddle.\nLater, Marc buys and ATV from a dealership where the salesman mentions he is Florence's husband.\nEventually relieved of handling Marc's insurance case by her boss, Florence pities Marc, while developing feelings for him and illegally passes him the business card of a friend, a top lawyer, who could help him. The lawyer puts Marc on course to receive a large insurance payout, but wants taped evidence of his conversations with the insurance company to strengthen her case. Marc invites Florence on a date unsuccessfully, also asking if she has taped their conversations. She eventually tries to pass him a voice-recording where she is heard to pressure him into accepting the inferior insurance deal. Marc refuses to accept it, knowing she will be fired if it is heard in court. Florence, plagued with guilt and attracted to Marc, wakes up before dusk and enters Marc's house, leaving the voice recorder. Drawn to Marc sleeping, she approaches him. He reaches for her and they kiss and (off camera) have sex, unconstrained by his paralysis. They also spend the morning together in a speedboat and by a lake in the Loire region. They are not shown together after this.\nFlorence eventually mails the recorder directly to the lawyer, who uses it to (off camera) help secure Marc's compensation claim in court. Florence is fired for her actions, rekindles her love of classical piano (including taking an exam) and takes a job in the local public library. She is in her house with her daughter when the TV shows Marc competing in a dressage event, confident on his horse, Othello. Florence weeps openly. Marc is seen driving home from the competition with a horsebox.

Vicky suffers from insomnia. On one of his sleepless nights, Vicky is contacted by a drug dealer who gives him Lucia pills as a solution to his insomnia. This drug is said to have the capability to help one dream the life they want but has the side-effect, that upon discontinuation the same dreams shall turn into nightmares.\nWith the help of the Lucia pills, Vicky starts seeing himself as a successful actor called Vignesh surrounded by people he knows in the real world. Film actor, Vignesh's life is depicted in black-and-white. Durai, the theatre owner where Vicky works, had directed a film in his youth produced by a thug, who now wants Durai to sign off his theatre for his debt.

Meanwhile, in reality, Vicky struggles to win Divya's heart, who rejects him first due to his low salary and falls later for his humble character. Divya's attempts to get Vicky educated and lead him to get a better-paying job turn out to be futile and result in the death of Durai at the hands of goons.

Divya receives an unexpected call from Vignesh some days later and he asks her to meet him. He tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is ultimately happy. He says that he should not confuse his dreams and real life. Asking Divya to close her eyes, Vignesh jumps off the roof to the disbelief of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.\nIn the present, the detective with the help of the suspects performs a sting operation on the drug dealer and learns more about Lucia's pills. Meanwhile, Divya is caught in an attempt to kill Vignesh by taking him off life support.

He listens to the recordings he made during their time together.\nThe film returns to the period shortly after the book's release. Although initially skeptical of the high praise Wallace's book is receiving, Lipsky \u2013 a writer having only marginal success \u2013 is awestruck after reading it. He persuades his editor at Rolling Stone magazine to give him an assignment to interview Wallace during his book tour.\nThe journalist travels to meet Wallace at his home on the outskirts of Bloomington-Normal, Illinois (near Illinois State University where the author teaches writing). Lipsky finds the young author unassuming and amiable, but indifferent to being interviewed. Wallace permits Lipsky to tape-record their conversations, with the proviso that Lipsky won't use any direct quotes which Wallace asks to have taken \"off the record\" five minutes later. Wallace opens up to Lipsky on a variety of subjects, ranging from dogs to television to fame and self-identity, but remains somewhat guarded. He tacitly admits to alcoholism, but offers few details of his experience. Lipsky's mention of Wallace's brief voluntary institutionalization under a suicide watch causes some friction between them.\nAs their conversation continues late into the night, Wallace invites Lipsky to stay in his unused \"guest room\", rather than a motel. The room is dominated by stacks of his books. They resume the interview in the morning. Lipsky also accompanies Wallace for a few days to Minneapolis-Saint Paul, where Wallace has the final appearance of his book tour. There they meet two women friends of Wallace: Betsy, whom he knew in graduate school, and Julie, a literary critic; the men spend time with the women later that night and the next day at the Mall of America. Although Wallace and Lipsky generally get along well, Wallace becomes angry when he sees Lipsky flirting with Betsy.\nAfter their return to Wallace's home, tension increases when Lipsky asks the author about rumors of past heroin abuse. Wallace denies it, accusing Lipsky of looking for a stereotypical angle from which to write his article. As their time comes to an end, the two spend a morning together, mainly as new friends rather than as journalist and subject. Lipsky summons the nerve to give Wallace a copy of his own novel, and they agree to stay in touch.\nThe closing passage is set fourteen years later, when Lipsky is on his own book tour.

From Northwood Headquarters she takes command of a mission to capture three of the ten highest-level Al-Shabaab leaders, who are meeting in a safehouse in Nairobi.\nA multinational team works on the capture mission, linked together by video and voice systems. Aerial surveillance is provided by a USAF MQ-9 Reaper drone controlled from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada by Second Lieutenant Steve Watts. Undercover Kenyan field agents, including Jama Farah, use short-range ornithopter and insectothopter cameras to link in ground intelligence. Kenyan special forces are positioned nearby to make the arrest. Facial recognition to identify human targets is done at Joint Intelligence Center Pacific at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. The mission is supervised in the United Kingdom by a COBRA meeting that includes British Lieutenant General Frank Benson, two full government ministers and a ministerial under-secretary.\nFarah discovers that the three high-level targets are now arming two suicide bombers for what is presumed to be an attack on a civilian target. Powell decides that the imminent bombing changes the mission objective from \"capture\" to \"kill\". She requests Watts to prepare a precision Hellfire missile attack on the building, and solicits the opinion of her British Army legal counsel. To her frustration, her counsel advises her to seek approval from superiors. Benson asks permission from the COBRA members, who fail to reach a decision and refer the question up to the UK Foreign Secretary, presently on a trade mission to Singapore.

The lawyers and politicians involved in the chain of command argue the personal, political and legal merits of and justification for launching a Hellfire missile attack in a friendly country not at war with the US or UK, with the significant risk of collateral damage. Watts can see the more direct risk of little Alia selling bread outside the targeted building, and they seek to delay firing the missile until she moves.\nFarah is directed to try and buy all of Alia's bread so she will leave, but after paying her his cover is blown and he is forced to flee without collecting it. Seeking authorisation to execute the strike, Powell orders her risk-assessment officer to find parameters that will let him quote a lower 45% risk of civilian deaths. He re-evaluates the strike point and assesses the probability of Alia's death at 45\u201365%. She makes him confirm only the lower figure, and then reports this up the chain of command. The strike is authorised, and Watts fires a missile. The explosion destroys the building and injures Alia, but one conspirator survives. Watts is ordered to fire a second missile, which strikes the site just as Alia's parents reach her. They rush Alia to a hospital, where she is pronounced dead.\nIn the London situation room, the under-secretary berates Benson for killing from the safety of his chair.

The three then strip and run to Dag's house, where they change into organic cotton clothes kept by Dag's hippie mother.\nLater, Dag, Petra, and Ned are captured by the aliens. They are placed with other captured residents in a warehouse, with force fields segregating the humans, vampires and zombies.

In the fight with a karate duck, Toto dodges and thinks he defeats him at first, but the duck punches Toto, throwing him into the air, and he lands unconscious.\nLater, as Toto regains consciousness, Pat\u00edn Pat\u00e1n, a duck egg, shows up and reveals that Don Poncho's duck opponent was his dad, who retired and \"explored\" a crocodile's stomach.

Two days later, Toto begins his training with Pat\u00edn and shows improvement in his fighting skills. That afternoon, Pat\u00e1n tells Toto that he needs to learn non-fighting moves, which include swimming, running, and flying, with training taking during place the following days. Burnt out, Toto rests and his friends show concern. The next morning, Don Poncho teaches him his \"signature move\" which involves crowing before delivering a knock-out punch.

In a moment of remorse, Toto lashes out at Pat\u00edn Pat\u00e1n when an army of vultures invades the \"Granjas el Pollon\" ranch. Toto and his egg friends fight back and get help from the ducks, leading the vultures into the rocky mountains and defeat them by flying through a narrow gap. Afterwards, Toto regains courage and the group flies off to the Palenque arena at Tepizcoeloyo.\nAs Don Poncho is training, Toto arrives to take his place and then enters the stage for his match against Bankivoide. The match begins with a rocky start as Toto is knocked into the wall, leaving him almost unconscious, and then runs off before being knocked back again. Then, the fight proceeds normally and Toto uses much of the methods from his training. For 11 rounds, Toto has been improving on his fighting skills as he goes, even dodging Bankivoide's knock-out dunk move. On the 12th round, just when Bankivoide is tiring out, Toto use# his \"signature\" punch, which isn't enough to knock down Bankivoide. As time runs out, with much encouragement from his friends, Toto goes all out on Bankivoide and shows much more improvement in dodging as he fights. Finally, after remembering the love and support of his family and friends including Di, Toto knocks out Bankivoide with a perfect rooster crow, claiming victory.\nIn the aftermath, Bankivoide congratulates Toto, Mat\u00edas \"El Oscuro\" Jim\u00e9nez is arrested after showing to have counterfeit documents, and El Padrino wins the bet placed on Toto. In discussing the vulture invasion, Bibi reveals that Chiquis sent the army in attempt to ensure Toto's loss, much to Bankiviode's shock and disappointment, and he sents her away.\nBack at the \"Granjas\", the entire barn celebrates with a party, and it's revealed the ranch has been paid in full. Toto ends the film with his perfect crow.\nIn the mid-credits, Tlacua and Cuache are seen trying to stop a motorcycle with a rope, attempting to capture a chicken.

One day however, she sees Gordo watching her while shopping. Simon's sister tells her that in high school, Simon and his friend Greg reported that Gordo had been molested by an older boy, which led to Gordo getting bullied and transferring schools. Robyn discovers that Simon has run background checks on Danny McDonald and Gordo, who has spent his life in and out of prison. She seeks out Greg, who reveals the molestation story was fabricated by Simon, calling him a bully. As a result of the false report, Gordo's father thought Gordo was gay and tried to burn him alive, leading to his arrest for attempted murder and Gordo being sent to military school. When Robyn asks why Simon would have done such a thing, Greg replies, \"because he could.\" He goes on to explain that Simon was a bully with a \"real mean streak.\" \nRobyn confronts Simon but he denies responsibility. At her behest, he tracks down Gordo and delivers a non-apology. Gordo knows Simon is insincere and warns Simon that the past is not done with him yet. Furious, Simon attacks Gordo. He later lies to Robyn, saying Gordo accepted his apology.\nSimon is promoted, but at his celebration party, Danny McDonald hurls rocks at his house and accuses Simon of fabricating information and ruining his career in order to get the promotion. Robyn goes into labor and gives birth to a boy. Simon is fired for lying about McDonald, and Robyn tells him that she wants to separate.\nSimon returns home to find another gift box, consisting of a key to their house, an audio recording of Simon and Robyn making fun of Gordo, and footage shot from inside their home that shows Gordo standing over Robyn when she had fainted, seemingly about to sexually assault her. Gordo wears the mask of a monkey (a lifelong fear for Simon) as he touches an unconscious Robyn on the bed before the camera cuts.\nAt the same time, Gordo visits Robyn at the hospital with a bandaged eye and his arm in a sling. He tells her that Simon caused his injuries. Simon rushes to the hospital but misses Gordo, who smirks at him as the elevator doors close. Gordo calls Simon to taunt him, refusing to confirm whether or not he raped Robyn and fathered the baby, just as Simon refused to come clean about the molestation story years before. With his marriage over and his career destroyed, Simon breaks down as Gordo watches.

Nash, Ramsey, and their father Butch have lost their herd of longhorns, so Arlo offers Spot's help in sniffing them out. The group locates the herd, but Butch recognizes the work of cattle rustlers. Arlo and Spot lure the four rustler Velociraptors into the open, allowing Butch and his family to attack. After the rustlers have been driven off, Arlo joins the Tyrannosaurus in driving the cattle south. Later, he sees the familiar mountain peaks of his homeland in the distance, and leaves with Spot to return home. Along the way, they encounter an adult feral caveman in the distance. Spot is intrigued, but Arlo dissuades him and they continue on. As another storm approaches, the pterodactyls return, attack, and carry Spot away. Arlo falls off a cliff and becomes entangled in vines, being knocked unconscious as a rock strikes his head. Arlo has a vision of his father freeing him and leading him home. Arlo instead resolves to save Spot, making the vision of Henry proud of his son before it fades away. The vision invigorates Arlo with refound strength, as he frees himself from the vines and finds and attacks the pterodactyls, who have cornered Spot in the river. Arlo and Spot together plunge the pterodactyls into the water, where they are swept helplessly downstream. When a landslide causes a giant wave, Arlo leaps into the water to rescue Spot, and the two are swept away toward a waterfall. Arlo protects Spot as they go over the falls, and carries him to shore.\nAs they near Arlo's home, the two are approached by the caveman and his entire family, who show great interest in Spot. With great reluctance, Arlo pushes Spot to join this new adoptive family, and the two of them share a tearful goodbye.

Upon returning home, Hannah's father again warns him to stay away, or bad things will happen.\nLater, Gale has to supervise a school dance, leaving Zach with his aunt Lorraine. Fearing Hannah is in danger, Zach tricks her father into going to the police station while he and Champ enter his house.

In response to Champ's curiosity, Zach unlocks The Abominable Snowman of Pasadena and the story's titular monster emerges from it and escapes. With Hannah's help, they track the Abominable Snowman to a local ice rink where Hannah's father appears and reimprisons it in the manuscript.\nHannah's father unintentionally reveals he is R. L. Stine, the creator of the Goosebumps franchise. He originally wrote the stories to cope with severe bullying, but the monsters featured in them became real as a result of his imagination, forcing him to keep them imprisoned in their house manuscripts. Back home, they encounter Slappy the Dummy from the Night of the Living Dummy series, who has now been freed from his manuscript.

Furious, Siddheshwar Maharaj warns him that he would face dire consequences for what he has done. \nAn apparent earthquake destroys Gopala Rao's shop leaving him perplexed on how to make the ends meet as the house was mortgaged and Gopala Rao took loans to renovate his shop. To claim his insurance, Gopala Rao and his assistant Ottu visit the insurance company, which repulses to give him insurance as the destruction of shop was an Act of God and the company would not be responsible for it according to the documents, Gopala Rao had signed unaware of it. Gopala Rao arranges for the land, on which shop was located to be sold but none comes forward to buy it as they consider it \"impure\" as the idols of Gods were shattered on the same land due to earthquake. Gopala Rao decides to sue God in court, demanding compensation despite receiving opposition from Meenakshi.

After attending a seminar by a New Age communications guru, Ukai, Jun casually reveals that she has been having an affair with a younger man and plans to divorce her husband. The other women are shocked, with some more hurt than others that Jun kept so many secrets from them. However, over time, especially during a vacation that Jun plans, they rekindle and re-contextualize their bonds with each other. The three friends attend Jun's court case to support her, which affects their perception of their own lives and relationships in intertwining stories.\nFree-spirited and independent Jun is married to a biologist, Kohei, who strongly opposes the divorce and calmly believes that he can convince her to give up. In court, Jun admits that Kohei did not physically abuse her, but that their marriage was rife with emotional and psychological abuse. She maintains that she tried hard to be a good wife, but Kohei emotionally rejected her, and his lack of interest in sex prevented her from achieving her dream of having a baby. However, her court case goes poorly when her infidelities are admitted on tape, and she does not come across as sympathetic, or having tried to fix her marriage. Though she tries to incite Kohei to violence in private, he ignores the attempts and continues to try to get her to stop the divorce proceedings. Kohei later reveals to the rest of the friends that she is pregnant with his child. Frustrated by the lack of progress in the divorce proceedings, she flees on a ferry to an unknown destination, knowing that being separated from him long enough will automatically grant a divorce. Jun disappears for the rest of the movie, and Kohei mentions that she is in a shelter specializing in women trying to divorce their husbands.\nThe tough, no-nonsense Akari chafes at work with a younger and inexperienced colleague, Yuzuki, who she is training.

Though she is looking for a partner, she finds it difficult to connect with other men and struggles with whether or not she desires intimacy. A doctor at the hospital attempts to start a relationship with her, but she rebuffs him. Later, she reprimands Yuzuki harshly for making what could have been a serious mistake, and afterward, she accidentally falls down the stairs and breaks her leg.

Ukai is slated to interview her when it is over, but when he spontaneously walks out, Kohei is brought on to replace him.

Sadie's grandfather, Graff, takes them to sea in his commercial fishing trawler, Harbinger, which is crewed by Bowman, Roland, Big G, Dock, Svetlana and Atka. Sadie declines when Graff encourages her to helm the boat as she has lost her nerve since losing her father at sea.

The crew help to recover what proves to be the crashed Soviet lander, now frozen in ice. Ronelle and Stephen are awakened by the commotion and Stephen excitedly claims ownership of the lander. Graff disputes his claim and says the Russians will want their ship back. Sadie points out that the object was the property of the now-nonexistent Soviet Union, therefore maritime salvage law would give them the rights to it. Graff infuriates Stephen further by declaring that it belongs to Sadie.

However, cosmic radiation has caused them to mutate and become capable of shapeshifting.\nWhen the cosmonaut's body goes missing, Stephen accuses Sadie of moving or hiding it.

One of their friends and classmates, Adrian (Marlo Mortel), harbors romantic feelings for Ella, who is also skilled with mediumship. Ella confesses to the two that she will not be able to attend their school retreat due to financial problems. Adrian offers to pay for her registration but Ella kindly declines. After a physical education class, Ella sees a ghost of a girl (Andrea Bersamin) in the gymnasium's locker room before being made fun off by three clique students; Megan (Ingrid dela Paz), Jessie (Eliza Pineda) and Allison (Devon Seron). The next day, during a Chemistry class, Jacob (Jerome Ponce), who also harbors feelings for Ella despite being Megan's desire, was asked by the clique give Ella a box of chocolates which actually contains cockroaches unbeknownst to Jacob and Ella. Jacob becomes angry with the clique while friends Steve (Paolo Gumabao), and Jack (Phytos Ramirez), who has a relationship with Jessie, laughed at the prank.\nAt home, Ella's mother (Lilet), notices Ella's sad behavior and gives her money to join the retreat, which Ella reluctantly accepts. On the day of the retreat, the class was accompanied by their teachers Ms. Gonzalez (Janice De Belen) and Ms. Taas (Sue Prado) and the school's chaplain Father Anthony (Dominic Ochoa) to a mansion on the province. They are greeted by caretakers Selya (Vangie Labalan) and Anding (Archie Adamos). Selya explains to everyone of the mansion's history and was owned by a rich woman named Donya Amara (Iza Calzado), who lived and died during the Japanese Occupation Period and the estate is under the ownership of her descendants who live in the United States. On the first night, while Ella was sleeping, she had a vision about a woman in black committing suicide by hanging herself. \nOn the next day during an activity, Ella asked Manang Selya about the woman in the photo, whom she recognized was the woman in black in her dream. Selya explained that she was Veronica (LJ Reyes), Amara's younger sister who committed suicide because of shame from being raped by the mansion gardener Jaime (Joem Bascon). Jaime was then burned to death by people close to the family. That night, Ella, Faye and Adrian were terrorized by whom they thought was a ghost, only for them to find out that it was another prank pulled by Megan and her clique. The noises awaken Jacob, who then attempts to settle things down. Adrian however rebuffed his concerns and blamed him to be a part of the prank while also, revealing that he overheard a conversation between Steve, Jack and Jacob that Jacob only \"likes\" Ella to make Megan jealous. The argument ensues into a violent fight which was stopped by an angry Ms. Gonzalez and Ms. Taas. As their punishment, the group was not allowed to attend the remaining activities in the retreat and instead serve detention by cleaning the whole vicinity. \nThe next night, Ella was haunted by the ghost of Jaime and ended up fainting in fright. Thinking it was another prank pulled by Megan, Ms. Gonzalez and the others made the group stay for another day in the mansion to work out their differences while their classmates and Ms. Taas went home ahead as a huge storm was on its way. Ella then confessed to Adrian that she has the ability to see ghosts and when she was younger, caused her father to be killed, to which she blamed herself for. That night, while Ms. Gonzalez, Father Anthony and the caretakers were asleep, Megan, Jessie, Allison, Jack and Steve decided to hunt ghosts, Jacob, Ella, Adrian and Faye warned them not to but they continued. They decided to leave Megan's cellphone plugged in a battery pack in the confessional in hopes that they will record The Black Lady's (Veronica) voice. \nA storm hits the town and causes a power outage the next morning while water begins to flood the mansion. That night, Steve remembered Megan's phone and asked if she has already retrieved it. He goes to get it alone while the others were fixing candles and putting buckets in leaking areas. Father Anthony noticed Allison, Steve and Jack's disappearance and Jessie volunteered to look for them. A chandelier suddenly dropped on the floor and injured Father Anthony's legs rendering him immobile. On the confessional, Steve retrieves Megan's phone and decided to listen if there were voices recorded. He listened to the recording and was frightened when Jaime's ghost appeared pointing at something. He tried to escape but was caught by another violent ghost. His tongue was then severed and he was killed. Jessie found Jack who was revealed to be cheating on her with Allison. Jessie runs away but stumbles into Steve's dead body, which they carry back to the house. They find Megan's phone in his pocket which Mrs. Gonzalez uses to call for help. Faye and Jacob accompanied her. While making the call, Ms. Gonzalez accidentally listened to Veronica's voice recording and Jaime appeared pointing at something. Ms. Gonzalez suffered from an asthma attack and orders Jacob to grab her inhaler. Faye stays with Ms. Gonzalez and decides to listen to the voice recording as well. Jaime appeared once again pointing at something. Suddenly, the ghost who killed Steve appeared and threw Faye and Ms. Gonzalez to a wall injuring them severely. Ella and the others hear their screams and when they ran to help them, they find their corpses with their tongues ripped out. Jacob told everybody that he saw Ms. Gonzalez freaking out over something she heard from the phone. Father Anthony advises them to listen to the recorded message as they might learn something about the killings. \nThe recording turns out to be Veronica's confession, stating that she committed suicide not because Jaime raped her but that they fell in love. Veronica adds that Amara, a witchcraft practitioner, did not approve of their relationship as she had feelings for Jaime also. Due to her practice of sorcery, Amara influenced everyone to believe that Jaime raped her sister and burn him alive. This led to Veronica committing suicide as she lost the love of her life. Eventually, Amara died too.\nElla then realizes that Amara was the real killer. She also discovers that whoever heard Veronica's confession will be killed by Amara because she did not want anybody to know the truth while Megan concludes that everyone would suffer the same fate. Suddenly Jaime's ghost appeared and pointed at Amara's ghost approaching them. Ella, Adrian and Jacob carries Father Anthony to safety. Megan, Jack, Jessie and Allison flee the mansion. Selya and Anding are then killed by Amara, who blasts them through a glass door. Father Anthony asked the three to leave him behind stating that the Lord is with him no matter what. The surviving trio reluctantly leave him and Amara kills Father Anthony. \nMegan and the others cross a flooded area outside the mansion wherein Allison is pulled down by a supernatural force. Jack and Jessie, who noticed her disappearance, are also pulled down and killed before they can warn Megan. Megan now alone encounters Amara surfacing up from the water feasting on the tongues of her three friends. Attempting to get to safety, Megan is captured by the spirit. As the three remaining friends hide, Adrian convinces Ella to use her abilities to ask help from Veronica and Jaime. Ella is drawn to a vision of the afterlife and is greeted by Veronica and Jaime; the former instructing her to destroy Amara's corpse before she takes human form. The trio head to a private tomb in the back area of the house to exhume Amara's corpse. Before Jacob could destroy the corpse, Amara appeared and captured him. A heavily injured Jacob asks Ella and Adrian to leave him before being killed by Amara. While on the run, Adrian is pulled down to the ground by the rotting hands of Amara, also killing him, leaving Ella all alone. She runs to the chapel wherein Amara's ghost confronts her. Using a crucifix, Ella stabs Amara in the mouth and takes out the latter's tongue. Ella is then blasted by the force backwards, injuring her head.\nSometime later, Ella was then seen with her mom and was greeted by her younger siblings. It turned out that Ella suffered from amnesia caused by the head injury as she did not recognize them at all. Ella's mother told her not to worry as her memory will be back some time. Three months later, Ella woke up in her home to find out that her memory has returned. A door opens by itself and Ella, suspecting it was her mother rushes out to tell the good news. However, the spirit of Amara appears once more and the two fight, resulting in Ella getting mortally wounded. As Amara tells Ella that her friends are waiting for her, Ella uses her strength to condemn Amara back to hell by placing a rosary around her neck.

The dragon abducts one of the maidens, but one brave knight traveled to an island where the dragon lived to rescue his love, but the time he got there, it was to late. The knight and dragon fought a fierce battle, but in the end, the knight emerged victorious and the dragon was defeated.

Meanwhile, Curt meets the Devil and hits it off with him until learning he is to be ritualistic killed for not living up to his blood oath, Curt persuading the Devil to not sacrifice him via a contract if he puts on a show to win Barb's favor with a replacement sacrifice.\nRemy, Augie, and Deema locate the way to Orpheus which is guarded by Deema's mother Durmessa, who warn Deema that Orpheus isn't what she expects him to be as they get past her.

Annoyed with Orpheus, revealing herself to be his daughter through his fling with Durmessa, Deema leaves with Augie following her upon being fed up with Remy's selfishness. After sharing a romantic moment while on Charon's ferry, they discover from the Devil's cellphone that Curt is being sacrificed at the crossroads and head out to save him.

A jealous Devil tries to use a bazooka cannon full of T-shirts to kill Orpheus, accidentally knocking Barb out as she was getting the group to safety. The group survives the fall, but find themselves in the lower regions of hell full of living sex-offender trees, including one tree who repeatedly raped Orpheus as a child. Seeing the tree to be truly regretful, Orpheus accepts his forgiveness if he rapes the Devil.\nRemy, Augie, Curt, and Deema are caught and bounded by the trees and when Remy is eventually held down by roots, Curt, while hanging upside down from a tree, drops a mint onto Remy. Although upset at first about Curt keeping this from him, Remy is told that if he eats the mint, the blood oath will be paid. The Devil and a demon try to stop him, but Remy eats it with him and the others returning to the land of the living with Deema while the Devil is forced to watch Barb fly off with Orpheus as he is being hit on by the tree much to his distress.

The next day, Laing is taken to the 40th-storey penthouse to meet Royal, who invites him to a party thrown by his snobby wife, Ann.\nThe gathering turns out to be an 18th-century costume party where Laing's everyday suit is ridiculed by Ann and other guests, including Munrow, who also lives in the building. Humiliated, Laing is thrown out of the party and becomes trapped in an elevator during a power outage. Such outages are becoming common, along with water being shut off and garbage chutes becoming blocked, to the annoyance of residents. Royal tells Laing these are simply growing pains of a new building. Munrow's brain scans come back clean, but a vengeful Laing leads him to believe he has a brain tumor. Another power outage ignites a night of decadent partying throughout the high-rise, and a drunk Munrow commits suicide by jumping off the 39th floor. Suspicious that no police arrive to investigate, Wilder becomes intent on exposing the injustices within the high-rise. Law and order in the building disintegrate as violence and debauchery become commonplace, garbage piles up, food becomes scarce, and class warfare erupts between floors. Laing shows signs of mental disturbance, savagely beating a man, barricading himself in his apartment, and having sex with Helen.\nWilder, having been beaten by upper-floor residents, decides to kill Royal, believing him responsible for the chaos. It is implied that Royal has bribed authorities to ignore the disorder. Acquiring a gun from the Royals' former housekeeper, Wilder learns that Toby is Royal's illegitimate child. Breaking into Charlotte's apartment, Wilder tortures and rapes her for information on Royal. A television newsreader named Cosgrove, the only upper-floor resident who still leaves for work, is killed by a gang of lower-floor residents. Some upper-floor residents butcher Ann's horse for meat and ask Laing to lobotomise Wilder as a dangerous agitator. After conducting a psychiatric examination, Laing refuses, stating that Wilder is \"possibly the sanest man in the building\". Laing is nearly thrown off the tower, but Royal intervenes. He surmises to Laing that the failure of the high-rise may actually be a kind of success, a \"crucible for change\" that could lead residents to escape to a new life. Helen gives birth to her overdue baby. Wilder makes his way to the penthouse, and after a confrontation with Royal, shoots him dead. Wilder is then stabbed to death by Royal's women, as Toby looks on through his kaleidoscope.\nThe film ends as it began in the ravaged high-rise. Violence has abated somewhat since many residents are dead or have fled. Laing appears to have gone insane, speaking about himself and to others in the third person. He lies down with Charlotte, reflecting that what has happened will eventually occur in the second tower of the development. The film concludes with Toby listening to a radio broadcast of Margaret Thatcher declaring that \"where there is state capitalism there can never be political freedom.\"", "tmdb_id": 254302}, "39126340": {"title": "Highway to Dhampus", "plot": "Film Tagline: \nWe look at the sky, but we walk on the ground.\nSummary: \nWhen Laxmi, headmistress of a small orphanage in Nepal, is visited by a rich socialite attempting to fix her image through charitable acts, a chain of events is set in motion that affects everyone involved.

The campaign started by derailing, assaults upon Japanese bases and outposts.\nInitially, Shangwu's unit disrupt a train line and assaulted the depot in Niangziguan, suffering and inflicting casualties, but they were fooled by IJA into not touching a fake Red Cross train, the train dismounted Japanese troops and an armored train disrupts their attack, leading them to collide a train engine. The unit suffered casualties just to hold a rail switch. They are victorious in the effort. The unit was permanently honored.\nIn the IJA's headquarters, Hayao Tada berated Commander Okazaki for his failure and took away his medal. Meanwhile, Chiang Kai-shek was listening to the broadcast in his house when Lin Sen talk to him about the history of anti-Japanese resistance of China. Mao also listens to the broadcast. Chiang later sends a commendation on the 8th Route Army.\nLater, Tada commands a Collaborator to Okazaki to infiltrate the CPC's depot headed by Master Feng and returns his medal. Yao's unit was charged of defending the same depot which develops a new weapon made of chili. They also sent spies upon a Japanese armory depot in Xiyingwu, disguised as supplying Collaborators. Peng also inspects several volunteers preparing clothes and explains to Zuo the importance of the offensive when 120th Division gives them telegrams. Yao's unit was charged of attacking the depot in Xiyingwu and the division was led by Zuo himself, but there are Japanese armor that serves as reinforcements and civilians as comfort women inside the depot. Another unit ambushed the armor convoy while Zuo's unit assaulted the depot. When the women were rescued, at the cost of Liu Zhu Zi, whose family hated him for being a 'traitor' and demoted from being a commander to an infantryman, they relentlessly killed all the Japanese soldiers they find. Mao took the telegram on its success. The mute man gave Peng shoes, but he gives it back.\nOkazaki meanwhile assaulted the Huangyadong depot in Licheng with infantry and later, air support, but retreated when the news of the counterattack of the 8th was reached him. Master Feng, as well as the Collaborator died on the assault. Peng later honors the casualties and swears revenge upon Guanjianao, a major IJA stronghold and Okazaki's HQ.\nPeng himself led the attack upon Panlong, Guanjianao. Casualties were rising on both sides, especially on the caves where Japanese are holed. With air support from Tada, Okazaki led the defense, Kuromon's cavalry was repulsed. The flanks were taking fire, until a squadron entered and eliminated the defenders on a side. The assault on the main peak started. Okazaki relays a message on Tada instead of Kasahara that air support must be directed to him and wears the medal he has. Liang's position was taken air strikes, but unharmed. They were charged to plant explosives under the main base. The mute man sacrificed himself while delaying the cavalry charge, Peng took the bloodied shoes. Yao was hit by airstrike, but unharmed while Liang's men are busy planting explosives. She saved Yao from an exploding bomb, knocked her unconscious. A soldier sacrificed his life while repairing the detonation cord and detonated, destroying the flanks, while Yao carries Liang to safety.\nThe battle ends in Peng's victory, taking the mountains. months later, Peng and Zuo debriefs his men when Yao approaches Peng and told him that if not for Liang (she died of wounds), and Peng's words, he will not be encouraged. Peng told him that it's not him, but Yao's sacrifice made him. Mao made a speech praising Hundred Regiment Offensives and commanded the listeners to use this as inspiration. Near the end of the film, both CPC and NRA are mounting offensives all over China, Zuo Quan was killed in one engagement, until Japan surrenders in 1945. At Zuo's grave, he swore that until the war is over, he will not stop fighting.

President Coin refuses to let Katniss go to the Capitol until they take District 2, so instead, she sends her to join the assault on the Capitol's armory in District 2, the last district controlled by the Capitol. Although she is able to rally the rebels and convince District 2 to join the rebellion, she is shot by a civilian, but merely injured due to her bulletproof Mockingjay costume.\nJohanna covers for Katniss while she sneaks on board a helicopter on its way to the Capitol. Coin becomes aware of Katniss' defiance but plays along. Katniss is recruited into the Star Squad, which includes Gale and a recently married Finnick. The whole squad is given nightlock pills to take in case they are captured. Peeta, who is still not fully recovered, eventually joins them in the field to appear in the propaganda videos that the team is responsible for shooting in the wreckage of the city. Led by Boggs, the team makes their way to the Capitol, evading booby-trapped \"pods\" placed along the way with Boggs' holographic map called the Holo. In setting up for a shot in a courtyard, Boggs is fatally wounded by a pod and bestows the Holo on Katniss. In his final breath, he tells her the password to self-destruct the Holo and insists that she keep going, warning her of Coin. The squad then accidentally triggers another pod, releasing a flood of lethal black tar. As they flee, Peeta momentarily succumbs to his conditioning in the high-pressure situation and attacks Katniss, killing Mitchell in the process.\nKatniss refuses to kill Peeta, but Gale states that he would kill him if needed. The group are then trapped in a building by Peacekeepers. As they try to figure out their next steps, Katniss lies and says that Coin has sent her on a mission to assassinate President Snow. The other group members know this is a lie, but they back Katniss up and decide to follow \"Coin's\" orders. The Leeg sisters stay behind in the building as a distraction so the group can escape the building. The Peacekeepers destroy the building and the Capitol broadcasts a video of the attack announcing Katniss' apparent death, which is then interrupted by Coin who delivers an impassioned eulogy for Katniss to rally the rebels. Realizing that everyone believes Katniss to be dead actually helps their cause, the team decides to continue on to the mansion and quietly assassinate Snow. The group travels into the sewers to make it across the Capitol without being detected or hurt by pods, but surveillance footage in the tunnels alerts Snow that Katniss is actually alive. He orders the release of genetically engineered \"mutts\" into the sewers, who ambush and kill several members of the group, including Finnick. Katniss uses the password on the Holo to self-destruct and cause an explosion that kills the rest of the mutts. The team escapes the sewers and takes shelter in a nearby house owned by former Hunger Games stylist and Snow's cousin, Tigris.\nSnow invites Capitol citizens to take shelter in his mansion, forming a human shield around the mansion. After saying goodbye to Peeta, Katniss and Gale join the group of citizens in disguise in order to infiltrate the mansion. During this attempt, the rebels finally arrive at the Capitol and engage in a gunfight with the Peacekeepers, with several Capitol citizens being caught in the crossfire. The mansion gates remain closed to the Capitol citizens that arrive, and the children in the crowd are brought to the front so that they can enter first when they do. In all the confusion, a hovercraft marked with Capitol insignia drops bombs into the crowd. When a group of medics, including Katniss' sister, Prim, arrive to treat the wounded, the second wave of bombings occurs, killing Prim and knocking Katniss unconscious.\nKatniss awakens, and Haymitch informs her that the rebels have finally won the rebellion. Katniss goes to face Snow in his greenhouse, where he is being held prisoner and awaiting execution. He explains to Katniss that Coin staged the bombing to turn his followers against him, and when she doesn't believe him, he reminds Katniss of their promise never to lie to one another. Katniss realizes Gale had suggested a similar strategy and confronts him about this when he comes to visit her. When Gale claims that he is not sure whose side the bombs came from, but that he cannot deny his part in Prim's death and regrets not being able to keep his promise of protecting her family, Katniss dismisses him.\nCoin calls a meeting of the surviving Hunger Games victors, where she declares herself the interim President of Panem. Haymitch slyly asks how long \"interim\" might be, but Coin does not answer. To end the violence of the rebellion, she calls for a vote for a final, symbolic Hunger Games using the children of Capitol leaders as revenge. Some of the tributes, including Peeta, are immediately outraged, and others support the initiative. Katniss stays deliberately silent, and Coin asks her directly what she thinks after most of the tributes have cast their votes. After a moment to think, Katniss votes yes on the condition that she can execute Snow herself. After meeting Katniss' eyes at the table, Haymitch casts the tie-breaking final vote of \"yes.\"\nAt Snow's execution, Katniss approaches Snow with her bow in hand. Overlooking them is Coin, and after a speech, Katniss shoots her dead instead. Coin falls from her podium and Snow begins to laugh, which causes a riot of citizens to converge on and kill Snow. Katniss then tries to swallow her nightlock pill, but Peeta rushes in to stop Katniss from committing suicide and she is then arrested. In captivity, Haymitch brings Katniss a letter from Plutarch that she refuses to read. Haymitch then reads it aloud to her; the letter assures Katniss that she will be pardoned, there will be no \"last Hunger Games,\" and she will be able to return to District 12. He doesn't tell her this in person because he feels that he cannot be seen with her as Panem begins to heal under the leadership of Commander Paylor. Katniss remarks that the only person who's ever actually won the Hunger Games is Plutarch.\nReturning home to District 12, Katniss tries to pick up the pieces of her old life. Prim's cat returns to the house, and Katniss has an outburst at the animal before breaking down into tears. One day, Katniss walks outside to find Peeta, who has almost fully recovered from his conditioning and returned home. They spend time together, sometimes with Haymitch, and receive a letter from Annie, Finnick's wife, telling them that they have had a son, that Katniss\u2019 mother is still treating survivors, and that Gale was promoted to Captain. Commander Paylor is formally elected the new President of Panem.\nSeveral years later, Katniss and Peeta play with their children in a meadow. Their infant cries from a nightmare, and Katniss ponders that they will eventually learn her story and about her time in the Games; She muses to her baby that when she has a nightmare, she plays a game wherein she imagines every good thing that she has ever seen anyone do.

Even in his late 30s, he is only interested in 'scoring' one night stands while his friends are all married with kids. The story opens with one such scene where his friends tell him to get married as he is too old to screw around; in turn, Mandar explains his philosophy about sex as a purely physical act, somewhat akin to the satisfaction of the 'perfect' bowel movement. He asserts it \"as a physical need\", whereas to him \"love is a different ball game and isn't necessary for sex\".\nThe narration now moves back several years to Mandar's teenage. The year is 1989, whence Mandar along with his cousin Dilip (nicknamed Yusuf as a tribute to the thespian) visits his village in Maharashtra where their cousin Kshitij is already waiting for them. 15-year-old Kshitij is studying in a military school and is mature beyond his years in his views and aspects about marriage, love and sex. By the end of their vacation Mandar realises that he is no longer a kid. His life becomes more exotic as he starts to woo girls, watching adult films and fantasizing about ladies.\nLater in the year 1995, Mandar is now grown up and is an engineering student in Pune. Dilip and Kshitij accompany him there too; the latter is an army officer by now. Mandar stalks Parul only for having sex with her. While making out in the hostel room, they are caught by the warden and Mandar gets expelled from the hostel, leading him to rent a small flat. There he meets a beautiful housewife Jyotsna and sets his sights on her. The dapper Kshitij, in the meanwhile, beds a steady parade of stunning girls at Mandar's flat. One of Kshitij's many girlfriends has a friend Anju who is being sexually abused by her own father. Greatly incensed on learning of this heinous act, Kshitij beats up the father and takes Anju and her kid brother away thus rescuing them. Kshitij falls in love with her and stops seeing other women. Amused, Mandar and Dilip talk about how Kshitij didn't fall for any of the pretty girls he was seeing, but fell in love with a dark complexioned plain girl. Kshitij marries Anju and they eventually have a son.\nGetting back to Mandar's alliance with Jyotsana, their casual flirting gradually reaches a point where they start an affair. Hers is a marriage that has petered into nothingness, given her husband has let himself go out of shape and humour. Jyotsna needing sexual satisfaction finds it in Mandar. Their furtive affair carries on for a while, Jyotsana visiting Mandar's flat from time to time, before Deepak finds out. Once again, Mandar is forced to shift residences and finally ends up staying with Dilip. Later in 1996, Mandar meets Parul again in order to keep in touch with her and is left heartbroken when he finds her with another guy, Alok.\nAfter college, Mandar is shown working a full-time job but is involved in a booty call arrangement with an older married woman who goes by the name Savita Bhabhi. After years of loveless one night stands, he takes Dilip's advise and decides to meet some girls through matrimonial sites. His strategy of being honest about his past affairs upsets most potential matches who are orthodox, conservative girls. When he finally meets one Tripti Gokhale, he is so smitten by her that he decides not be honest, but instead projects a holier-than-thou image. This almost backfires, as Tripti turns out to be a very open-minded girl who has no hang-ups about her own past and admits to having been in relationships before. Now stuck in a lie, Mandar has to continue projecting himself as an orthodox, colourless man. All the same, the two continue to meet and start liking each other.\nKshitij is killed during an encounter with insurgents in Kashmir. Mandar again is left heartbroken from losing his cousin and friend. This incident brings Tripti close to him as she comforts him. They eventually get engaged, but Mandar is having a tough time with the idea of monogamy. He has one last encounter with Savita Bhabhi. Worse still, while on an errand to pick up a distant relative from the airport, Mandar assumes that the person hasn't turned up and instead tries to pick up an attractive woman who turns out to be the distant relative. Embarrassed and shamed, Mandar barely gets out of the situation.\nAt this point, Tripti's ex-boyfriend Chaxx enters the equation. Cool, suave and charming, Chaxx is all that Mandar is not. That, and Tripti's history with Chaxx trouble him no end and make him insecure to the point where he assumes that Tripti is leaving him for Chaxx.

Tripti also reveals that she got pregnant when she was with Chaxx and there was nothing between them as they have broken up.

After their assigned evacuation vehicles are unable to reach their location, the section moves on foot and reaches a Pashtun village. They are harboured by a tribal elder (who has eyes of two different colours, one brown and the other blue) in his home, who sends the Taliban away after they attack the village while searching for the Canadians.\nSanders and his section evacuate the area and return to base, where his secret lover Captain Jennifer Bowman, an officer in the Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry (PPCLI), is also stationed.\nMeanwhile, Captain Pete Mitchell, an Intelligence Branch officer, carries out normal duties as the road is constructed, with little help from the Afghan National Army (ANA). When he hears Sanders' story of the Afghan elder, he decides to search for the man as a potential ally. He is helped in his search by a local asset assisting against the Taliban, called The Cleaner.\nWhile a search of the village yields nothing, Mitchell believes the man to be \"the Ghost\", a former militant who fought against the Soviets in the Soviet-Afghan War who gained his nickname for disappearing every time he was wounded, as his comrades would take him across the mountains into Pakistan to recover, out of the range of the Soviet military.\nMitchell eventually arranges a meeting with the Ghost, but the Ghost refuses to accept money as a deal for his help, wisely stating, \"Only a fool accepts a gift without knowing what it's worth\".  During this conversation, Mitchell confirms his suspicion that they are talking with the man widely regarded as \"The Ghost\".\nMeanwhile, the Canadians' Afghan ally, Bashir Daoud Khan (BDK), and his son, Karim, are double-crossing them and are working with the Taliban. Sanders' section sees this firsthand while observing the Ghost visit his son's home and granddaughters. The home was situated on land owned by BDK, while the crops had been destroyed by a Coalition airstrike some time in the past, leaving the Ghost's son with nothing to give BDK as his tithe for protection.\nSoon after the Ghost leaves, BDK arrives with Taliban protection and instructs the Ghost's son to pay up his money. When the son doesn't give the money owed, BDK kidnaps the Ghost's granddaughters. Sanders' fireteam observes the whole scene, but Mitchell repeatedly instructs them to hold their fire as they do not fully understand local politics. While everyone in the Canadian intelligence group knows their Afghan allies are crooked, there is no alternative in the province, and they need all the help they can get.\nMeanwhile, Bowman reveals to Sanders that she is pregnant with his child, conceived while both were on leave in Cyprus. Sanders rejoices in this, despite its being a serious problem given military regulations prohibiting fraternization. Before leaving for his next (and last) mission, Sanders proposes to Bowman and she happily accepts.\nThe Canadians follow the Ghost, who has declared a personal war against BDK in revenge for the kidnapping of the girls. With assistance from his tribe, the Ghost abducts BDK's son Karim and beheads him. Following this, the Ghost arranges a meeting with BDK in an isolated house, at the same time when BDK is supposed to be with the Canadians as they commemorate the opening of Hyena Road.\nWhen BDK arrives with his bodyguards in a convoy, he demands to know the location of his son. The Ghost responds by opening a sack he has brought and holding up Karim's severed head, at which point BDK pulls out his pistol and threatens to kill the Ghost.\nSanders and his section, who have been observing the incident, shoot and kill BDK as they see his positive intent of violence. They do not, however, know that the Ghost desired to die having nothing else to live for and only wanted to avenge his grandchildren who he assumed were lost forever.\nAs the section pulls out, dozens of Taliban insurgents arrive, and the section is trapped with the Ghost around the house. Although they fight off the insurgents, there is no support available, and the Canadians are pinned down. After Travis, a member of Sanders' section, is shot in the head by a sniper, the section decides to relocate into the house under heavy enemy fire.\nAs they move, they run into an IED, incapacitating the section, and only Sanders and the Ghost survive. Recognizing there is no escape, Sanders calls for an artillery strike on his location to eliminate the insurgents. After apologizing for the last time to Bowman, who desperately tries to countermand the order, Sanders tells the Ghost that he was going to be a father, something the Ghost appears to understand despite his not speaking English. Moments later, the artillery rounds hit the house obliterating Sanders, the Ghost, and many of the Taliban insurgents around them.\nLater, Canadian troops rescue numerous Afghan children, including the Ghost's granddaughters, having acted on the Cleaner's information and other assets.

She is no longer an aspiring writer and now devotes her time to working as an assault helpline operator and going to group counseling under the assumed name \"Angela Jitrenka\". She is also periodically shown attending personal therapy for her ordeal. Jennifer's scarring experience has left her highly distrustful and defensive towards most men, including her colleague Matthew, who has a seemingly genuine interest in her.\nWhile in group counseling, Jennifer develops a bond with one of the girls in the group, Marla, who also does not trust men. The duo begin their own personal crusade by exacting poetic justice for victims of sexual assault. However, just as Jennifer begins to enjoy life, Marla dies under mysterious circumstances and no one is found guilty of her death. She becomes acquainted with Detective McDylan, an investigator into Marla's death who, however, fails to bring justice for Marla nor closure for Jennifer. Distraught and enraged at how the law could not help Marla nor the rape victims in her support group, she decides to get vengeance for them.\nOne by one, Jennifer stalks and lures the unpunished rapists to a private place to torture and kill them. Her first victim is Marla's estranged boyfriend and alleged murderer, soon followed by the stepfather of a teenage member of the group.

She has a nervous breakdown, becoming further disillusioned with society and no longer able to discern well-meaning men from sexual predators. Clad in a suggestive red dress in order to bait men, Jennifer leaves her home, evading the police watch. First, she unsuccessfully attacks Matthew and scares him away, then she tries to lure a local thug who had been harassing her. As Jennifer is about to kill him, she is shot and arrested by McDylan, who had been trailing her the entire time.\nIt is now revealed Jennifer's personal therapy sessions were part of her mandatory treatment following a two-year sentence for attempted murder, lacking evidence of the murders that she actually committed. After completing the final session before her release, Jennifer leaves the doctor's office and switches the \"therapist\" sign on the door to read \"the rapist\". She is then attacked by two inmates, whom she kills, before killing her therapist who had left the room to stop it, but this is revealed to be a daydream, indicating that Jennifer's fantasies of killing all rapists are not over.

One day, a woman entirely dressed in black moves into the mansion next door and invites Bart and Jory over for tea and cookies. During this, she explains to them that she is rich but has no family except for her butler, John Amos. She takes a picture of them for a keepsake, and asks them to visit her often. Jory declines, but Bart agrees after she promises to give him anything he wishes for. Bart is curious as to why he has no other relatives, both he and Jory being aware that Chris is merely their step-father. Jory tells him that their maternal grandmother is in a mental hospital and that all of Chris's relatives are deceased. The woman lavishes treats and gifts on Bart, including a pet python, and eventually tells him that she is in fact his grandmother, Corrine. John Amos gives Bart a journal that belonged to his great-grandfather, Malcolm, and makes him promise never to reveal it to his family. Bart reads Malcolm's fanatical entries and writings, referring to beautiful women as sinful and degrading, which begins to leave a deep impression on him.\nOne night, Cathy places three beds in the house attic, which worries Chris about her behaving similarly to their mother. However, Cathy insists that she is only creating a back-up plan in case her and Chris's incestuous secret is ever exposed and they face the possibility of losing the children. She pleads with Chris to adopt Cindy, one of her ballet students, whose mother has died from cancer, and he agrees in order to calm her down about losing their family. Bart soon goes missing and the family discover him unconscious in the woods due to an infected cut on his arm, leading him to be hospitalized. Bart starts to suspect that his parents are keeping secrets from him, and he confronts Corrine over a painting of a boy who resembles Chris since he believed she had never met him. Corrine confesses that Cathy and Chris are both actually her children, leaving him horrified at his parents' incestuous relationship.\nBart starts to withdraw and lash out at his family, greatly worrying them.

Jory soon finds the family dog killed, and begins to believe Corrine responsible for the change in Bart. He tries to convince Bart to stay away from her, but Bart blackmails him into staying quiet and calls him weak for feeling emotion. Feeling pressured by Bart, Corrine admits that his biological father is her late second husband whom Cathy seduced to get back at her. Corrine then reveals how she wants Bart to become the child that she never got to have with his father, vengefully wishing to steal him away from her daughter.\nHaving become resentful towards Cindy since her adoption into the family, Bart attempts to drown her in the kiddie pool when she calls Cathy \"mommy\". However, he is stopped by Jory. As punishment, Chris locks him in the attic. Bart then begins to shout that they are \"the devil's spawn\" and that Chris is \"fornicating with his sister\". Realizing that he knows about their secret, Cathy and Chris desperately wonder how he could have found out. Bart is placed in a mental hospital and claims that it was Malcolm who tried to drown Cindy, leading doctors to suspect that he suffers from a mild case of schizophrenia. Jory goes to confront Corrine, who tells him that Cathy and Chris are siblings, which horrifies him. Jory then tells Chris that Corrine is living next door, and Chris goes to confront her. Corrine begs for Chris to forgive her and let her be part of her grandsons' lives, but what she wants most of all is to raise Bart as her own son. Chris rejects her and demands that she stay away from his family and children.\nAt Cindy's dance recital, Cathy sees Corrine in the audience and falls off the stage in shock, injuring her leg so severely that she is no longer able to dance. Jory's paternal grandmother, Marisha, comes for a visit upon hearing about Cathy's accident. However, she has learned about Chris and Cathy's true relationship and threatens to turn them in to the police for incest, wishing to take Jory into her own custody. Cathy is put on edge and argues with her, but Marisha insists that Jory's current living situation is unhealthy for him and points out how \"nuts\" Bart is. Bart, overhearing this, storms out of the house with Cathy chasing after him. He runs to John Amos, who tells him that if he cannot deal with the sins and hypocrisy of his family, then he should not be with Corrine either. John Amos tells him that she is a sinner just like his parents, due to her committing incest with her half-uncle, who was Cathy and Chris's father. Cathy goes to Corrine's mansion to find Bart, and finds a portrait of her siblings and herself. She confronts Corrine about involving herself in her children's lives and orders her to leave her family alone.

The owners hire veteran whaler Owen Chase as first mate, though he is disappointed not to receive a captain's commission. The captain is George Pollard, an inexperienced mariner from an established whaling family who envies Chase's skill and popularity. Chase and Pollard clash, leading Pollard to sail into a storm against Chase's advice. The two agree to put their differences aside, rather than risking their reputations by returning to port without profit, and soon, the crew kills their first bull sperm whale.\nThree months pass with no further successes, and Pollard realizes that the Atlantic Ocean holds no sighting of whales. The Essex sails past Cape Horn to the Pacific, hoping for better luck in catching one. In Atacames, Ecuador, the officers meet a Spanish captain who tells them his crew found the bountiful \"Offshore Grounds\" 2,000 miles to the west, but claims that a vengeful \"white whale\" destroyed his ship, killing six of his men.

Soon after, one of the men dies, and the remaining crew reluctantly decide to cannibalise him.\nThe older Nickerson is overcome with remorse for his cannibalism and stops his story, thinking his wife could not love him if she knew about it; however, when his wife comforts him, assuring him that she still loves him, he feels encouraged enough to finish. Back in the 1820s, the three boats are separated by the currents and one is lost. The other two further resort to cannibalism to survive, with Pollard's cousin Henry Coffin sacrificing himself.\nThe white whale suddenly returns, and Chase gets into position for a final attack. The whale breaches for a moment, allowing Chase to observe a portion of his previously thrown harpoon still embedded above the whale's eye. Chase hesitates, and stares into the whale's left eye, as the whale stares back at Chase. After a moment of thought, Chase lowers his harpoon, deciding not to kill the creature.

M. Karthik), who makes a living by repairing home appliances. The three of them are involved in an accident and witness the time machine while recovering from the shock. While Parthasarathy decides to keep the time machine for himself, he suffers an electric shock and ends up in a coma, prompting Elango and Arumugam to steal the time machine from Parthasarathy's shop. The duo use the time machine to make Arumugam's astrology practice extremely successful by going back in time and finding things lost by people under the guise of astrology. Elango further uses the machine to impress Anu's industrialist father Rajarathinam (Jayaprakash) by going to the future, obtaining the stock market results and successfully \"predicting\" them in front of Rajarathinam and his company's board of directors. Rajarathinam soon approves the marriage of Anu with Elango.\nThings go smoothly until Elango and Arumugam inadvertently thwart an encounter to kill Kuzhandaivelu (P.

In the present day, Kuzhandaivelu is plotting to kill Rajarathinam for his role in planning the encounter and also Elango and Arumugam for (unknowingly) attacking him in a parking lot. Elango and Anu's marriage is postponed indefinitely as a result.\nElango and Arumugam go back to the past to fix their mistake, but Kuzhandaivelu accidentally shoots the time machine while fighting a police officer during the encounter, damaging it. The duo find Parthasarathy, who has woken up from his coma but doesn't remember them, and ask him to fix the time machine. While Parthasarathy manages to fix the time machine, due to a lack of specific parts which have not yet been developed, it can only take the user to a specific time in the past (when Kuzhandaivelu damaged the time machine) and also as the date cannot be changed, the user cannot return to the future. Therefore, the duo decide not to use it. Later, Kuzhandaivelu spots Elango, Arumugam and Anu at a mall and pursues them. He opens fire during the chase, killing Anu. To ensure that Anu remains alive, Elango decides to use the time machine to return to the past and kill Kuzhandaivelu, even though he cannot return. But Kuzhandaivelu spots the duo and while fighting them, all three of them fall into the time machine and go to the past. In the past, Kuzhandaivelu destroys the time machine, but Elango manages to kill Kuzhandaivelu. Then, Elango and Arumugam stop themselves from finding the time machine by thwarting the accident involving them and Parthasarathy.\nThe next morning, Elango wakes up in a bed, remembering only the events of the previous night. He soon finds out, to his surprise, that he is in a marriage hall and that he will marry Anu on that day. He does not remember, to Anu's bewilderment, any of the events which had occurred in the past two months as a result of his usage of the time machine during that period.

As she works on the experiment at home, while Molly hosts a dinner for her lacrosse team, a moth flies by and distracts Cleo, causing her to accidentally spill unknown chemicals into her solution. The steam produced ends up turning the moth invisible, leading Cleo to chase it around the house, full of guests, before it gets away.\nLater, while Molly is preparing for bed, the moth returns, attracted to the light from the bathroom. The moth flies to close to the light, gets killed by it and falls into a cup of water containing an antacid Molly is about to drink, and she unknowingly consumes the moth which renders her invisible.\nThe next morning, Molly is horrified when she cannot see herself and discovers the reason from Cleo. She must attend school to participate in the season opener for her lacrosse team, which college scouts will be watching. As it is Halloween, she decides to wear her costume to mask her invisibility, but when the costume also turns invisible, Molly has Cleo wear the costume and pretend to be her at school.

The sisters go to a cemetery to catch another moth while George goes to school to set up. While in the cemetery, Molly's frustration over her invisibility mounts, leading to a heated argument with Cleo. In apologizing, Cleo admits to admiring Molly's \"light\" and is jealous because her not sharing in it makes her feel invisible.

After Franca leaves to do volunteering for two weeks, Giulio is visited by his schoolmate Alfonzo, now a door-to-door salesman, who tries to cheer Giulio up by administering a pill that temporarily reduces human brain usage to 2%. Under the influence of the drug, Giulio instantly becomes a thoughtless, vulgar, narcissistic womanizer: he cheats on Franca with his neighbor Sharon, then has Alfonzo take him to an exclusive nightclub, where he impersonates former footballer Ruud Gullit. Giulio later borrows the bouncer's Hummer and crashes it into a tree in the very same park he had been trying to save, then he steals an excavator and uses it to further vandalize the park. \nThe next day Giulio wakes up, having regained his consciousness, to the news that his vandalism acts have earned the park great attention by the media and public opinion, thus putting Cartelloni's levelling plans on hold. Giulio surmises that the only way to raise public awareness is through eco-terrorism. He joins an environmental NGO that plans to contaminate the city's water supply with large amounts of waste, so that citizens would understand the value of water. In order to reach the mindset to commit the reckless act, Giulio obtains more pills from Alfonzo, however he becomes addicted to the drug and trapped inside his newfound \"average Italian\" lifestyle, marrying Sharon and completely overturning his life. Giulio is noticed in this state by the talent scouts of the popular reality show Master VIP and accepts their offer to participate in the competition, eventually working his way up to the finals. Franca returns home and, after learning from Sharon and Alfonzo about the recent events, she takes them with her to the TV studio to attend the Master VIP finale.\nMaster VIP finalists are required to break from their past and everyone connected to it, thereby truly becoming VIPs: Giulio must divorce Sharon and cut ties with Franca and Alfonzo. Initially he complies, until Franca and Alfonzo reveal that he has been acting so recklessly of his own volition: the pills never existed and were a product of Giulio's own imagination to justify his behavior. Giulio briefly comes to his senses, addresses the audience and delivers an incoherent, ranting speech where both his personalities alternately prevail: this impresses Cartelloni, who is a judge in the show and instantly declares Giulio the winner. Giulio hallucinates about his negligent parents and tries to run towards them: he crashes into the camera, faints and falls into a coma.\nWhile Giulio is hospitalized, a psychologist explains that his mind is manifesting a split personality, due to years of repressing his latent desire to embrace conformity. As Giulio awakens from his coma, he understands the importance of compromise, which is often a necessity to get things done in Italy. He therefore finds a new way to save the park by exploiting his newly gained popularity: with Cartelloni's approval, he launches a new reality show where competitors are tasked with rebuilding the park using gardening tools.", "tmdb_id": 320316}, "43387789": {"title": "Ithaca (film)", "plot": "In 1942, Homer Macauley is a determined 14-year-old who seeks work delivering telegrams to take care of his widowed mother Katie, his older sister Bess and his 4-year-old brother Ulysses.

The resulting scandal not only costs him his reputation and job, it also causes him to lose the ring. After hearing the news, Amber breaks up with him as well. Brother Hai chases Da Peng, demanding his money back. Da Peng saves himself by explaining that he has already contacted Du Xiaoxiao and is using the ten million dollars for production. Pleased with this news, Brother Hai lets him off, on the condition that this movie is successfully made.\nNow forced to make the movie, Da Peng recruits Xiaoxiao, his personal assistant Pan, background actor Ma Tao and paparazzi photographer Hu. Da Peng tells them about the script he wrote, named \"Jian Bing Man\" (Pancake Man). The titular character is a superhero who fights against a large global crime organization that has kidnapped many people, including his beloved. Because he does not actually have money to hire any well-known actors, Da Peng sets various actors up in situations resembling the scenarios in the script, and gets them to unknowingly act out his story, all while secretly filming them. He successfully shoots scenes with many actors like Sandra Ng, Eric Tsang, Yue Yunpeng and Deng Chao, all of them oblivious to their plot. As the filming progresses, Da Peng reveals to his crew that \"Jian Bing Man\" is not just a simple film, but a story based on his childhood dream of becoming a superhero. Motivated by his dedication, the crew continue with filming and vow to make this movie a success.\nDa Peng manages to save his reputation by bravely stopping an armed robbery, mistaking it for a scene of his film. He also finds the missing ring and uses it to pay off his debt to Brother Hai. Da Peng's former entertainment company contacts him and wishes to hire him again, but warns him against continuing to shoot \"Jian Bing Man\". Because he did not receive consent from any of the actors that were secretly filmed, Da Peng will face serious lawsuits if he releases the film for commercial purposes. Da Peng decides to cease all production of the film and disband the crew. The film crew are extremely disappointed by his decision, and accuse him of cowardice. Da Peng is uncertain of what he should do, but is encouraged by his best friend Liu Yan to continue pursuing his dream.\nDa Peng successfully finishes filming \"Jian Bing Man\" with the help of various celebrities, include several additional stars like Jean-Claude Van Damme, Ekin Cheung and Jordan Chan, who were idols that his crew dreamed of meeting. The various celebrities all congratulate Da Peng on his movie, and tells him that although the movie cannot be screened, he can rewrite it into new film about the making of this movie, and if he was to do that, the celebrities would be happy to work with him again.", "tmdb_id": 348595}, "44928462": {"title": "Jil (film)", "plot": "In Mumbai, A gangster named Chota Nayak escapes from police custody and sets out to look for his aide-turned-foe Ranganath, who turned police informer and stole Nayak's money worth \u20b910,000 crore (US$1.3 billion).

He asks Magnus, and his wife Tina, about \"Project Fair Play\", which involved scientists under Lex Luthor's employ; Magnus offers to ask what the others know. Magnus gathers the remaining scientists (John Henry Irons, Thomas Morrow, Michael Holt, Pat Dugan, Emil Hamilton, Karen Beecher (whom Will Magnus argued with), Thaddeus Sivana, Kimiyo Hoshi, and Stephen Shin) for answers.

Initially, Sarah refused to adapt to her grandfather's traditional cultural practice, such as eating chicken feet for breakfast, and the local community who she thought were disgusting. Despite the best efforts of her grandfather to re-create a familiar environment for Sarah by recreating western dishes that Sarah is familiar with using local substitutes, Sarah only ate potato chips that she brought over from New York and refused to communicate with her grandfather.\nDefeated, Sarah's grandfather turned to Ah Bao, a neighbour who claims to speak English, to translate his instructions in Chinese and Cantonese to Sarah. Annoyed but later amused at his poor command of English, Sarah starts to take an interest in the surrounding neighbourhood. She also reveals that she can actually understand and speak Chinese, much to her grandfather's relief.

Sarah had warmed to the community so much that as the time draws closer to her departure, she became reluctant to leave. Above all, she did not want to leave her grandfather alone, as she had learnt of his various health ailments that he had hid from everyone over the years. Sarah thus prodded her grandfather to embrace new media so that she could communicate with him overseas and also tried desperately to get her mother and grandfather to reconcile.\nBefore Sarah's departure, Sarah's grandfather got Ah Bao to film a video to give to Sarah's mother when he dies.

Also, from time to time, a mysterious man stops by her van who frightens her, and she gives him money.\nOne day, a couple of youth scare Miss Shepherd, shaking the van and yelling at her. They woke her from a nightmare she was having of a long ago traffic accident. She goes to confession, and the priest reminds her he has absolved her several times already.

A wealthy neighbour buys her a new van, and it stays on Alan's property for the next 15 years.\nMary has an aversion to all music. When asked why, she explained that when she was a novice nun, left alone in a room with a piano she started to play a classical piece. She was forbidden to play it again. Another unusual experience she mentions is driving an ambulance during the 1939 blackout.\nFrom time to time, she takes a trip to Broadstairs on the coast, visiting a cottage with a blue door, speaking with a man. Once she's gone to the day centre, Bennett goes to the person she's named next of kin. Her brother in Broadstairs fills him in on the details: she'd tried to be a nun twice, he had had her institutionalised in Banstead (however, she escaped), she'd studied under the virtuoso pianist Alfred Cortot.\nHe returns home, to find her back. She had been scared off by a woman she'd known in Banstead, and had an opportunity to sneak in to play a piano in the centre. She retells that her confessor (in addition to the nuns) had forbade her from playing, which she was told would help her spirit grow. Before he goes into his home, she asks to hold his hand. It was her final goodbye to him; she dies peacefully in her sleep in her van.\nMuch of the dialogue is between two versions of Bennett \u2013 his \"real self\" and his \"writer self\".\nDuring her 15-year stay in his drive, Bennett balances his writing career with watching over Shepherd and providing for his increasingly invalid mother. Though he denies \"caring\" for anyone, he slowly becomes aware of his growing friendship with Shepherd. After her passing, Alan decides to write a memoir covering the years he has known her.\nIn 2014, the real Bennett is shown observing this film's final scene being filmed, with his younger self unveiling a blue plaque on his home dedicated to \"The Lady in the Van\".

Returning to the Danish Army after service in the British Parachute Regiment, sergeant Carl Leopold Rasmussen furiously beats up a German prisoner for carrying a Danish flag. A group of young German prisoners are handed over to Rasmussen's commanding officer Captain Ebbe Jensen and sent to the west coast, where they are trained to use their bare hands to remove the mines that the Germans had buried in the sand.  They are warned not to expect any sympathy from the Danes, who resent their former occupiers. Rasmussen shares this contempt and is determined to treat the young prisoners without sympathy.\nRasmussen is rude to and contemptuous of them and the neighbouring farm treats them with hostility. After marching his squad onto the dunes, he promises that they will return home in three months, if they can each defuse six mines per hour for a total of 45,000 mines. Rasmussen's hostility begins to recede slightly and the boys' leader Sebastian Schumann attempts to remain optimistic as they discuss their plans for when they return home. The POWs are not given food due to post-war shortages and begin to suffer from malnourishment, with Ernst befriending a young local girl to steal some bread from her. The optimistic Wilhelm's arms are blown off and he dies in a field hospital.

He also allows the boys to use a device invented by Sebastian to improve productivity. Hearing rumours of Rasmussen stealing food for the boys, Ebbe brings a group of British soldiers to abuse and torment the boys. Rasmussen stops them but is confronted about the theft by Ebbe, who accuses him of being sympathetic towards the Germans. Werner is blown to bits after encountering landmines buried one above another and his twin brother Ernst goes to search for him and continues to deny his death even after being comforted by Rasmussen.\nAfter a casual game of football, Rasmussen's dog is blown up in a supposedly cleared zone of the beach. This causes Rasmussen to snap and begin abusing the boys again. He forces them to march close together across the cleared zones of the beach to confirm that they are safe. When a young local girl walks out into an uncleared area of beach, her mother comes looking for Rasmussen only to find him gone. The boys volunteer to help save the girl. Ernst walks through the uncleared minefield to keep the little girl calm whilst Sebastian clears a path to safety for her. They manage to rescue her but instead of returning to safety with Sebastian, Ernst decides he cannot go on without his twin brother and commits suicide by walking backwards into the uncleared section and dies promptly.\nAfter witnessing this act of kindness and bravery from the boys, Rasmussen relents in his treatment of them and reassures a grieving Sebastian that they will soon be able to go home. While four of the boys continue to clear the beach with Rasmussen, the rest of them are loading unexploded mines onto a truck.

Gavin's parents are then seen, well into their 80s or 90s, tenderly holding hands.\nKerrod suffers a heart attack and his acute condition reunites Pamela, who is now a B-grade thespian and cabaret performer, with Edith, a successful best-selling author. Gavin is unable to make it back to Kerrod before he dies, but both Pamela and Edith are able to bury the hatchet with each other at his funeral. They agree that their naivete and sibling rivalry were the root of their poor life choices but also that there is ultimately nothing to forgive. Edith graciously soothes Pamela's bitterness over the sense that her life is without purpose, explaining that this means she can do whatever she wants with her life. She speaks philosophically about wisdom and regrets and the two feuding sisters are able to find peace together.\nMany years later, Gavin and Edith have passed away and Pamela reflects on her long and family-oriented life.

Without Hitler, MyTV's ratings and ad revenue drop precipitously and Sensenbrink, after a fit of rage (parodying Hitler's breakdown scene in the German drama film Downfall), decides he must rehire Hitler.\nHitler plays himself in the movie. After a night of filming, he is beaten by two Neo-Nazis who believe him to be a fraudulent impersonator mocking their beliefs. Hitler is hospitalized, but the news of his beating generates sympathy and he returns to high standing with the German people. While Hitler is recuperating, Sawatzki reviews his old footage and discovers a ball of energy (based on The Terminator) in the background before Hitler first appeared. Returning to the site, he finds burnt leaves. With horror, he realizes that the Hitler he encountered was the real person all along. He rushes to the hospital to confront Hitler, but finds only Katja, who says Hitler is at the movie studio. Katja does not understand Sawatzki when he says Hitler is real and he trashes the hospital room before running for the exit pursued by two hospital orderlies.\nSawatzki arrives at the movie studio, where he forces Hitler to the roof at gunpoint with his own pistol. Calmly, Hitler replies that he was elected by the German people, and if he is a monster, then so is everyone who voted for him. Enraged, Sawatzki shoots Hitler in the face and watches him fall off the roof to his apparent death. Suddenly Hitler reappears behind Sawatzki, claiming he cannot be killed, as he is a part of every German. This entire scene is revealed to be a part of the film, and Sawatzki is a body double wearing a silicone mask. The real Sawatzki has been committed to a mental hospital following his previous outburst that Hitler still lives.\nOnce the work for his film finishes, Hitler senses that he is on the path to a political comeback. He is more popular than ever, and nationalist Germans give him hope that Germany may be ready for his return to power. With Hitler and Bellini riding in the back seat of a car, and among images of actual nationalist demonstrations, the film ends with Hitler's voice-over: \"I can work with this\".", "tmdb_id": 318917}, "47385378": {"title": "Looking for Grace", "plot": "The story follows Grace as she runs away from home to the Wheatbelt of Western Australia.

The objective of the operation is to extract a rare flower, as the agents believe it to be the world's most powerful weapon. However, they are beaten to it by Speedy Gonzales. In New York City, Lola Bunny is tired of working for Giovanni Jones at the Acme department store perfume counter. She accidentally damages the store, gets fired and takes a long, awkward ride home in Bugs Bunny's taxi. Arriving in her apartment, she screams when she sees a mouse, even though it is her landlord, Speedy. He gives her the flower as a gift, unaware it is being watched by the NSA.\nGeneral Leghorn sends agent Elmer Fudd to watch the flower, though Lola uses it to create her perfume, which has a side effect of invisibility. She doesn't notice as she accidentally sprays her eye, forcing her to wash it out, rendering her visible. Cecil sends his goons to get it, but Lola backs out the window and falls to Bugs' taxi below. On the way down, the perfume makes the wall invisible exposing, in successive apartments. General Leghorn puts out a reward of $500,000 for Bugs and Lola, and Yosemite Sam, who was preparing to rob a bank in Times Square (with just a short-range water pistol), learns of it and apprehends them. However, he refuses to hand them to the NSA or the NYPD until after he gets the money, and a one-sided gunfight ensues. Lola and Bugs escape and slip down a storm drain.\nThey emerge through a manhole in front of Porky Pig, causing a traffic jam, but Giovanni grabs the perfume. Lola runs after him and gets abducted by Cecil in a van. Bugs jumps in Daffy Duck's taxi and follows them. At a secret location, Cecil and his goons interrogate Lola and leave her to die, but Bugs and Daffy manage to free her. Driving through the streets (and subway tunnels) of New York and running through Central Park, the rabbits make haste to John F. Kennedy International Airport. Daffy envies the ducks in the park and decides to retire. Having been arrested, Sam steals an NSA car and follows Bugs and Lola to the airport, where she spots Giovanni, and they all board the plane as does Cecil. Bugs retrieves the perfume and makes a parachute from clothes in passengers' checked baggage and, after a fight with Sam over the perfume, he and Lola land in the Atlantic Ocean. The Goofy Gophers pick them up in their yacht, try the perfume, and discover its invisibility property, albeit to Lola's dismay, but Bugs convinces her to see the upside. The Gophers subsequently give Lola a makeover while singing a song.\nThey arrive in Paris, and Bugs and Lola spray themselves, subsequently having fun with their invisibility: stealing lemonade, smashing the Louvre Pyramid by playing baseball, going skiing in \"Ze Alps\", painting a picture of the perfume and cramming several cars into the Arc de Triomphe. When it rains, the invisibility wears off and they find themselves caught between Elmer Fudd and Cecil at the Pont des Arts, Fudd holding the Gophers hostage. Cecil and his goons betray and disarm Fudd and the Interpol officers he hired with heat ray pistols, and Bugs tries to throw the bottle into the Seine to force the cops to stand down, but Sam catches it. They all dogpile on Sam, but are suddenly teleported to a space station over Mars, where Marvin the Martian grabs the bottle, with Cecil revealing he works for Marvin. Cecil's goons unzip their costumes revealing they are Instant Martians, much to Cecil's confusion. Marvin reveals his plan to make all of Earth invisible, as it \"obstructs [his] view of Venus\". To do so, he extracts the invisibility part of the potion from the perfume part, but ends up with two identical bottles; one of them has invisibility and the other does not.\nBugs and Lola play switcheroo and end up with both of them, handing Marvin a Joker card. They are chased to the Transporter Depot, but everyone crams into one pod overloading the system and causing them all to switch heads, bodies, and other parts. They continue to play body part swap for a while and even Screwball Daffy from Duck Amuck walks across the scene, and they are eventually restored. Marvin catches them, grabs the bottle, betrays/fires Cecil and sprays the Earth with perfume, not knowing that Bugs has switched it so Earth doesn't turn invisible. To Marvin's fury, Bugs turns the group and himself invisible, allowing them to escape the Martians, and they board the Martian Maggot. Before they leave, Bugs tosses Marvin the Illudium Q-36 Explosive Space Modulator, which Marvin was originally going to use to blow up Earth. Ironically, the Modulator blows up Mars instead, killing the Instant Martians and leaving Marvin hanging from a root, remarking \"I hate Earthlings.\" The Maggot returns the rest safely to Earth, landing in the Seine. When they accidentally leave the bottle in the spaceship, sinking with it, Fudd comes to believe the world is not ready for invisibility, and starts a one-sided chase to arrest Cecil for his complicity in Marvin's plan. Lola forgives Giovanni for stealing the perfume, and happily continues her relationship with Bugs. Unexpectedly, Speedy shows up to collect his \"morning croissant\" and briefly calls Lola out on her failures to pay rent while being able to visit Paris, before departing for Switzerland.\nOne year later, perfume mogul Pep\u00e9 Le Pew introduces his newest scent \"Lola\" and back in New York, Bugs reveals that he still has the invisibility potion, while Daffy has retired to Central Park.

Insisting that she needed to thank her, Honoka drags her back to her home, only to have her stop just outside, saying that that was good enough. The singer then asks if Honoka had found the answer to her question yet. After having Honoka close her eyes, the two of them are transported to a hill full of flowers, in front of a large lake. The singer then asks Honoka to jump over the lake, telling her that she definitely can fly whenever she wanted. Honoka proceeds to run down the hill and take the jump, reaffirming her love for the existence of school idols. Eli also sends Honoka a message on behalf of the third years after they had discussed it, telling her their decision to stop activities.\nHonoka wakes up the next morning and heads back to the rooftop, where everyone has come to the same decision. There, Honoka announces her final idea, to hold a concert to promote all school idols as their final contribution to the industry. She goes over to UTX High School where she pitches the idea to Tsubasa, who accepts it readily. Despite having sent emails to all school idols across the country, not many of them are accepting of it, which leads Honoka to decide that they need to meet them personally in order for their feelings to get through. \"Future Style\" plays after this sequence.\nUsing Maki's money for train fare, they head out in groups of three across the nation to convince school idols to join their endeavor. The massive crowd gathers in Akiba at the end, and begins preparing for the school idol festival to occur. Kotori and Anju work together on the costumes, while Maki and Tsubasa work on the song. On the final evening before the event, Honoka announces to everyone the news of \u03bc's disbandment, to everyone's dismay.\nThe day of the festival finally arrives, and all of \u03bc's heads towards Akiba together. As Eli decides to start a race there and \u03bc's begins running, Honoka is distracted by a single drifting petal, reminiscent of the flowers upon the hill in the illusionary world. She begins to run while doing pirouettes and spins along the way, feeling that just like before, she really can soar anytime she wanted now with the burden off her shoulders. When she gets to the site, all of \u03bc's is greeted by the sight of all of the school idols already there, dressed in costumes following a style similar to their own design. The massive crowd parts to give them a clear path to the stage, and the festival begins with the performance of \"Sunny Day Song\", which is now the song for all school idols.\nA new school year begins in Otonokizaka High School, with Yukiho and Alisa shown as third years carrying on \u03bc's' will and discussing their plans for the Idol Research Club.

The scene then transitions to a backstage flashback of \u03bc's just before their last idol performance.

While performing his menial labor, his employers notice that he seems to have exceptional skills in mathematics and they begin to make use of him for rudimentary accounting tasks. It becomes equally clear to his employers, who are college-educated, that Ramanujan's mathematical insights exceed the simple accounting tasks they are assigning to him and soon they encourage him to make his personal writings in mathematics available to the general public and to start to contact professors of mathematics at universities by writing to them. One such letter is sent to G.H. Hardy, a famous mathematician at University of Cambridge, who begins to take a special interest in Ramanujan.Hardy soon invites Ramanujan to Cambridge to test his mettle as a potential theoretical mathematician. Ramanujan is overwhelmed by the opportunity and decides to pursue Hardy's offer, even though this means he must leave his wife Janaki for an extended period. He parts lovingly with Janaki and promises to keep up his correspondence with her.\nUpon arrival at Cambridge, Ramanujan encounters various forms of racial prejudice and finds his adjustment to life in England more difficult than expected. Hardy, though much impressed by Ramanujan's abilities, remains concerned about Ramanujan's ability to communicate effectively due to his lack of experience in writing proofs, but with perseverance, he manages to get Ramanujan published in a major journal. In the meantime, Ramanujan is diagnosed with tuberculosis and his frequent letters home to his wife remain unanswered after many months. Hardy continues to see much more promise in Ramanujan. However, he remains unaware of the personal difficulties his student is having with his housing and with his lack of contact with his family back home in India. Ramanujan's health worsens while he continues delving into deeper and more profound research interests in mathematics under the guidance of Hardy and others at Cambridge.\nJanaki, after much elapsed time, wonders why she has not heard from Ramanujan and eventually discovers that his mother has been intercepting his letters, and withholding hers to him. Hardy makes special efforts to get Ramanujan's now recognizably exceptional mathematical skills accepted by the university, by nominating Ramanujan for a fellowship of Trinity College. At first, Hardy fails for reasons related to college politics and racial prejudice. By gaining the support of key members of the college, Hardy again successfully nominates Ramanujan as a Fellow of the Royal Society, thereby forcing his acceptance as a fellow of Trinity. Ramanujan is eventually reunited with his family in India, though his declining health, exacerbated by poor housing and harsh winter weather in England, ultimately takes its toll and leads to his death aged 32, soon after his recognition as a mathematician of international merit and importance.", "tmdb_id": 353326}, "45665893": {"title": "The Man with the Iron Fists 2", "plot": "Thaddeus is on his way to the monks at Wu Chi Temple on a quest on inner peace when he is attacked by the brother of Silver Lion and his henchmen.

Thus, the mission is scrubbed and the crew evacuates just as the dust storm begins to hit; during the evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by debris and pulled away by high winds. The telemetry from his suit's bio-monitor is damaged and Watney is erroneously presumed dead. With the MAV (Mars Ascent Vehicle) on the verge of toppling, the remaining crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the Hermes.\nWatney awakens after the storm, injured and with a low-oxygen warning. He returns to the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\") and treats his wound. As Watney recovers, he begins a video diary. Unable to communicate with Earth, his only chance of rescue is the next Mars mission. In four years, the Ares IV will land 3,200 kilometers (2,000 mi) away at the Schiaparelli crater. Watney's immediate concern is food; he estimates that the food sent with the mission will only last a little over a year with rationing.  As Mark is fortunately a botanist, he manages to cultivate a garden inside the Hab using Martian soil fertilized with the crew's bio-waste and manufactures water from leftover rocket fuel. The garden grows potatoes using whole potatoes sent with the mission for a special Thanksgiving  meal. Mark also begins to modify a rover for the journey to the Ares IV MAV site.\nOn Earth, NASA satellite planner Mindy Park, reviewing satellite images, notices moved equipment and realizes Watney must be alive. NASA director Teddy Sanders releases the news to the public, but decides not to tell the Ares III crew so that they will remain focused on their mission, over flight director Mitch Henderson's strong objection.\n\nWatney takes the rover on a one-month journey to retrieve the Pathfinder probe, which fell silent in 1997, and its associated Sojourner rover. Using Pathfinder's camera and motor, he establishes visual contact with NASA. NASA transmits a software patch to link the mission's rover with Pathfinder, enabling communication by text. Sanders finally allows Henderson to inform Watney's crewmates.\nMars missions director Vincent Kapoor and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng prepare a space probe to deliver enough food for Watney to survive until Ares IV's arrival. However, the Hab's airlock blows out and exposes the Hab's garden to the harsh Martian environment; the potato plants all die. Thus, Sanders orders that routine safety inspections be bypassed in order to accelerate the arrival of the food mission. His gamble fails, and the Atlas V rocket explodes soon after lift-off.\nThe China National Space Administration has developed a secret booster rocket, the Taiyang Shen (lit. the \"Sun God\"). The decision is made to use the rocket to resupply Watney. However, JPL astrodynamicist Rich Purnell devises an alternative plan: have the Taiyang Shen rendezvous with and resupply the Hermes, which will then use Earth's gravity to \"slingshot\" back to Mars two years earlier than Ares IV. Sanders rejects the idea, considering it too risky for the Hermes crew. Henderson surreptitiously sends Purnell's proposal to the crew; they unanimously vote to implement it without seeking NASA approval, disabling NASA's remote controls and making the course change. Sanders is forced to support them publicly, but demands Henderson resign after the Ares III mission is complete.\nWatney begins the 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli, where the MAV for Ares IV has been pre-positioned. He must use it to rendezvous with the Hermes, but it needs to be lightened considerably. After takeoff, when the MAV runs out of fuel, its velocity relative to the Hermes is too fast for Watney to be picked up. Commander Lewis quickly improvises, using an explosive to breach a forward airlock, resulting in air escaping violently and slowing down the Hermes. It is still not enough; using a tethered Manned Maneuvering Unit, Lewis is unable to reach Watney. Watney pierces his pressure suit, using the escaping air to propel himself to Lewis, ending his 543 sols alone on Mars.\nAfter returning to Earth, Watney becomes a survival instructor for astronaut candidates.

After realizing that her chemotherapy is doing more harm than good, Rachel opts to discontinue her treatment. Greg and Rachel have a heated argument over her choice where Greg accuses Rachel of giving up on herself and in return Rachel points out his unwillingness to do anything selfless unless he's told to do so. He leaves, devastated that he can no longer help her.\nIn a rage, Greg confronts Earl, blaming him for the events leading to the end of his friendship with Rachel. Earl in turn admonishes Greg's inability to care and sympathize for anyone but himself, before ultimately punching Greg after the latter dares him to. Later, Earl gives Greg a heartfelt testimonial for Rachel\u2019s film before letting him know that he's finished with their friendship. Greg's admission to the college he planned to attend is later revoked due to his poor grades.\nLater in the year, Greg learns that Rachel is back in the hospital and is dying. His mom encourages him to visit her. Madison invites Greg to the prom, but at the last moment, he decides to go to the hospital instead. During the journey there, Greg is asked by the limo driver if he loves the girl he's going to see, a question he finds himself unable to answer. He brings his iPhone and a portable projector and places a corsage around Rachel's wrist before running the film he made for her on the front wall of her room. Rachel is moved to tears by the movie, but falls into a coma shortly after viewing it and dies about 10 hours later. Greg admits to the viewer that he lied about Rachel not dying, as he \"didn't think she would.\"\nAt her shiva, Greg is comforted by Rachel's mom and they grieve together. Greg and Earl rekindle their friendship. During the funeral, Greg sneaks into Rachel's room, where he finds a card from her stating that she wrote to Greg's college and explained that he missed school for her sake. It also states her wish for Greg to take any of her possessions that he pleases. He finds several intricate carvings within her books depicting scenes of her with Greg and Earl. Greg leaves with one of the books containing a personal carving and his favorite of Rachel's pillows.\nSome time later, Greg writes his story of his time with Rachel and mails it to the college along with the film he made for her with a warning that \"the last person who saw this immediately went into a coma and DIED.\"", "tmdb_id": 308369}, "52967415": {"title": "Me and Kaminski (film)", "plot": "Sebastian Z\u00f6llner, a cocky young writer, travels to the Swiss Alps to interview Manuel Kaminski, a legend among 20th-century painters, who knew everybody in the art world but lost his sight and withdrew from all contact.

Dane suggests that they work together to stop the shark in a more humane fashion and protect the environment. Elsewhere, King recruits desk worker Spencer to assist her in stopping Kolossus.

As he collects the red mercury from Kolossus, the shark attacks again, but he uses Kolossus to attach a transmitter to it, bringing the shark under his control as well. Dane broadcasts a message worldwide, announcing that he has control of both Mega Shark and Kolossus and plans to use Kolossus to destroy the cities that produce the most pollution, killing millions in the name of saving the environment.

As Holmes spends time with Roger, showing him how to take care of the bees in the farmhouse's apiary, he comes to appreciate Roger's curiosity and intelligence and develops a paternal liking for him.\nOver time, Roger's prodding helps Holmes remember the case (shown in flashbacks); he knows he must have failed somehow, as it resulted in his retirement from the detective business. Almost 30 years earlier, after the First World War had ended and Watson had married and left Baker Street, Thomas Kelmot approached Holmes to find out why his wife Ann had become estranged from him after suffering two miscarriages. Holmes followed Ann around London and observed her seemingly preparing to murder her husband \u2013 forging cheques in her husband's name and cashing them, confirming the details of his will, buying poison, paying a man, and checking train schedules. Holmes, however, deduced her true intentions: to have gravestones made for her and her miscarried children (the man she paid was a stonemason) and then kill herself. Confronting her, Holmes confessed he had the same feelings of loneliness and isolation, but his intellectual pursuits sufficed for him. Ann asked Holmes if they could share the burden of their loneliness together. Holmes was tempted, but instead advised her to return to her husband. She poured the poison on the ground, thanked Holmes, and departed. Holmes later learned that Ann succeeded in killing herself by stepping in front of an oncoming train. Blaming himself, he retired and fell into a deep depression.

Years before, Umezaki's father had gone to England on business and never returned; he had sent a letter explaining that Holmes had persuaded him to remain there and forget his family in Japan. To Umezaki's disappointment, Holmes told him bluntly that his father probably just wanted a new life for himself and that he had never met the man.\nIn the present, Mrs Munro grows discontent with her work as Holmes becomes infirm and burdensome to look after. His closeness to her son Roger is another source of tension, as the boy is becoming dissatisfied with his family's lowly status and increasingly distant from his barely literate mother. Mrs Munro accepts a job at a hotel in Portsmouth, and plans to take Roger to work there as well. Roger is unenthused by the prospect of hotel drudgery and unwilling to leave Holmes, and says as much to his mother. Later, Holmes discovers Roger lying unconscious in the garden, covered in insect stings. As the boy is rushed to hospital, Mrs Munro accuses Holmes of caring for nothing but himself and his bees, and prepares to burn the apiary. Holmes stops her, having realised that the culprits are actually wasps; Roger had found a nearby nest and tried to flood it in order to protect the apiary, but the wasps swarmed on him instead. Holmes and Mrs Munro burn the nest together, then return to the hospital as Roger regains consciousness.

An army is deployed to repel the so-called terrorists, but after some of the army's soldiers are killed by the Ace Archers, the army plans a mission that will remove the primitive people. Guruji dislikes the idea of declaring the primitive people terrorists. According to Guruji, all people are humans, and no inhumane treatment is justified. He believes that even if the local primitive people behave in an uncivilised way, they are not animals, and that every person has the ability to be transformed by love and affection. Even though the primitive people endanger Guruji's life, Guruji decides to advocate for them. A police inspector named Arjun attacks the primitive people, but Guruji saves him after he is badly injured. Arjun goes to meet Guruji with Babru. Guruji also saves the life of the Tibru tribe's leader, Babru's son, and gains his confidence. Babru learns that Guruji has all the signs of Aadi Guru, the deity worshiped by the tribe for many years. Thus, the Tibru tribe becomes civilised by Guruji and abandons their practice of hunting and killing animals for food. Suddenly, the head of the 16 tribes, Ajgar, demands a sacrifice. When Guruji asks the tribe to refuse, he learns that they oppose civilised people and that Ajgar saved them from civilised people. When asked why they hate people who live in cities, Babru states city-dwellers are successors to Eklavya's tribe. As Guru Dakshina, Eklavya was a renowned Archer who gave his thumb, but could not earn respect for his tribe. His forefathers tell him not to worry and say that during Kali Yuga there will be a man who will bring respect to the tribe. On Guruji's insistence, the tribe refuses to offer a sacrifice. On hearing this, Ajgar is enraged and takes the whole tribe as his hostage, but Guruji saves them. Soon Ajgar realizes that Guruji is no ordinary man and that the army might kill him. His own tribe seems to be against him, as the army is about to enter the area to kill the tribe, as they had been labeled as antisocial terrorists. It seems wise to surrender his life to the army rather than risk his entire tribe. He asks for pardon from Guruji for his deeds and runs away, saying that he is going to surrender himself, but when the army takes him as a hostage, Guruji arrives and fights the entire army by himself. Durjan Singh suddenly arrives and tells Guruji how he tried multiple times to prevent the minister from instigating the army into believing that the primitive tribe is its biggest enemy. They were even trying to take Guruji's life but failed miserably because of Guruji. At this point the army realizes that Durjan Singh is misleading them and that Guruji is the man \"Saint Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh Ji Insan\" who has been donating blood to the army, eyes to the old parents of army officers, even kidneys to the needy army personnel.

Two years later, after having been hauled from one foster home to the next, including her uncle's where an older cousin of hers attempted to sexually abuse her from reading her father's novel on sex, Emily lives with June (Chiarain) and Steve (Loui Vangelder), foster parents she feels are not the worst but too suffocating, often rebuffing their attempts at kindness, notably June's. Emily feels June pressures her to be happy when she finds herself incapable of doing so due to her clinical depression. In the present, she often reflects on her happy earlier childhood (Millie Donnelly, Hunter and Sadie Fitzmaurice, Sarah Minto) with her father, her unconventional homeschooled education with him and how he changed dramatically after the death of her mother, also named Emily (Mullins) on the night of her birthday in a car accident, an event that led to his mental breakdown; he became obsessive with writing, refusing to eat and sleep and was preoccupied with the concept that humans and the surrounding universe, such as a blade of grass, shared the same molecules. As an ode to her mother, Emily dons an intricate bracelet she used to wear at all times.\nEmily is enrolled in a new secondary school and quickly attracts the attention of an awkward half-Irish, half-English classmate Arden (Webster) who is unrequitedly smitten with her, though she is initially standoffish and uninterested in his attempts of a relationship. Contrarily, Emily is outcast by her teachers and bullied by her peers (Hughes) for her oddity and intellectual arrogance, such as refusing to introduce herself on her first day and rebelling against an assignment to dissect a Wordsworth poem \"Ode on Intimations of Immortality\" for its obvious sexual message. On the day of her 16th birthday where Emily is troubled at the absence of a birthday card from her father, a tradition he has kept since his commitment, she contemplates suicide at the bottom of the school pool, much to the concern and frustration of her swimming teacher (McCann) who is forced to pull her to safety. Not comprehending her actions, she is further humiliated by her classmates as she is banned from class. Later that afternoon, Arden drops by her home to deliver a present, an old book handed down to him by his Irish grandmother (McCusker), Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. Emily does not thank him, though accepts the gift.\nThereafter, she welcomes him accompanying her on their way home from school. When she returns home however, she grows upset at still finding that no letter from her father has arrived in the mail and despite June's assurance, she has an emotional meltdown. The next morning, she meets Arden at his home during a confrontation with his strict, physically abusive father (Conlon) and sensitive, submissive mother (White) and pleads for him to help her travel to the psychiatric institution and rescue Robert. At first reluctant, Arden eventually agrees as they both skip school. At first, they attempt to hitchhike in the rain with no luck until Arden enlists the help of his Granny to borrow her 70s canary-yellow Renault 4. After a full day on the road, on the following morning the two stop by a supermarket for breakfast, though Emily manipulates her way into only paying for a bouquet of flowers for Robert while shoplifting the rest, which upsets Arden given he would rather pay \"like normal people\" would, prompting Emily to justify that the money would be more useful towards border crossing and questions what it means to be \"normal\".\nFollowing this incident, Emily grows paranoid of authority, believing they will attempt to stop her of reaching her destination and at one point, orders Arden to drive away from a curious policeman (\u00d3 H\u00e9alai) questioning them for IDs. Camping on the beach for the night, Emily and Arden are ambushed by a local gang. When Arden is beaten in an outnumbered fight and runs towards the car for help, Emily is left vulnerable inside the tent where she is threatened to be raped by the gang's leader, telling him coldly, \"Fuck off.\" However, Arden returns having retrieved his deceased grandfather's handgun from the glove compartment, frightening the gang into submission as they flee. A mutual trust therein develops between Emily and Arden as they eventually arrive at the institution.\nArden invents a theatrical distraction atop the roof of one of the buildings, entertaining the patients whilst alarming the orderlies as Emily, bouquet in hand, searches for Robert. Coming upon his room however, she finds not her father but Dr. Golding (McGovern) who quietly informs her that her father is no longer at the facility. Inviting her to his office, he explains to her that the hospital does not hold people against their will, that Robert, after sometime, voluntarily admitted himself, a fact that greatly upsets Emily. Destroying the flowers outside, Arden comes to her aid where the two leave to Emily's grandfather's summerhouse, uncertain of their paths. After getting into a disagreement, Arden storms out of the home where Emily attempts to follow him, though meets her father instead unexpectedly.

Twenty years earlier, Frank Grieves, a former addict and current police officer, discovers a body at Ambro's corporate headquarters.  Perplexed as to why his DNA scanner can not identify the body, Grieves becomes obsessed with solving the mystery.  The only clue he has is the word \"Morlock\" hidden on the body.  Grieves' superior, Nolan, does not approve of his investigation and instead orders him to work on busting the few remaining street dealers, who operate a shrinking black market since the legalisation of all narcotics.\nWhen Grieves continues his investigation, Ambro puts pressure on the police to rein him in.  Eddie Rankin, Grieves' friend and a medical examiner, tells him that an unidentified drug was found in the man's body.  Before Grieves or Rankin can examine it further, Ambro has the body destroyed.  Against orders, Grieves returns to the site of the crime in search of more clues, where he recovers a young woman, Eva Gray, who has apparently been targeted for assassination by unknown forces.

After Ambro goons attempt to kidnap his son, Grieves realises that the body he found earlier is the adult version of his 9-year-old son, Ben.  \"Morlock\" is a code word based on The Time Machine, a book that Grieves gave to Ben.

The North Koreans are eventually released upon orders by the South Korean high command, as part of the government's Sunshine Policy.\nOver the coming month, North Korea's Korean People's Navy repeatedly enters South Korean waters to reconnoitre and survey the ROK Navy's patrolling tactics and defensive measures. The South Korean Ministry of Defense is notified about North's strategy but is again ordered by the Blue House to not engage first. South Korea also receives intelligence reports that an attack is forthcoming, but does not change the rules of engagement to counter the looming threat despite the repeated requests of PKM 357's commander, Lieutenant Commander Yoon Young-ha.\nOn 29 June 2002, the second Battle of Yeonpyeong commences with a surprise attack on PKM 357 by a North Korean patrol vessel. The ensuing battle severely cripples both ships before reinforcements from the South arrives and forces the North's patrol vessel to retreat. 19 wounded and 4 deaths are confirmed before PKM 357 sinks due to uncontrollable fires. Naval divers eventually find the helmsman's body in the sunken vessel.\n83 days later, Park Dong-hyuk succumbs to his wounds, becoming the final casualty of the battle.

In below-freezing conditions, they see two inadequately-dressed hitchhikers, siblings Lee and Cheryl, and give them a lift. Lee is friendly but Cheryl is hostile from the start; both make no secret of their shady past and moral ambiguity. \nNight falls and Will, who is driving, is the only person awake in the car. Suddenly a man staggers into the path of the vehicle. Will narrowly avoids a collision by braking sharply. The man turns out to be severely hypothermic ; he is ushered into the car and an ambulance is called but he dies before its arrival. Lee picks the dead man's pocket, helping himself to a large amount of cash which he sees as a karmic reward, and noticing from his ID that his name was Cormac Leith. Cheryl finds a written note in Cormac's pocket which Will identifies as geographical coordinates.\nThe police speak to the four travellers who deny knowledge of the dead man's name and feign ignorance about his lack of personal effects. Unable to resume their journey immediately because black ice has closed the highway, they hole up in a motel for the night. Over drinks in the bar there, Cheryl looks up Cormac Leith online and discovers that he was recently released from a lengthy prison sentence and is the sole survivor of a bank robbery that netted millions of dollars worth of gold coins. The four surmise that Cormac met his death attempting to retrieve the loot from the coordinates written on the note. Cheryl steals a GPS device and they realise the coordinates denote a spot only 30 miles away.\nLee and Cheryl are immediately keen to go after the gold. Will and Dawn are more hesitant but eventually come to see it as a route out of their crushing debt. The next morning, and initially gung-ho about their chances, the four drive to the closest bit of road to the coordinates and then embark on a long hike to the site.\nQuickly their energy is sapped by inadequate clothing, mutual distrust, unexpected terrain and a frightening encounter with a hostile stranger. As the temperature drops and their chances of survival dwindle, they disagree on whether and how to continue. After a night spent in an improvised shelter, Will recognises that he is starting to die from frostbite and hypothermia, following an argument with Dawn, turns back on his own. She continues towards the treasure with Cheryl and Lee and the three eventually find the gold coins and fill their clothes with as much as they can carry.\nDawn fights with an increasingly irrational Cheryl and sets off alone to try to find her way back to the highway. Cheryl insists on trying to pull a heavy chest of coins, slowing her and Lee down.\nWill makes his way back to the relative shelter of a cabin where it becomes apparent that Cheryl earlier murdered the trapper who lived there. Suddenly terrified for his wife, Will seizes the trapper's gun and snowmobile and sets off to try to rescue her.\nCheryl loses consciousness and is on the point of death. Furious that Dawn refused to help Cheryl at the end, Lee, who is armed with a knife, leaves Cheryl's body and pursues Dawn across a frozen lake.\nWill reaches a cliff edge where he can see Lee chasing Dawn in the distance below. He attempts to shoot Lee using the trapper's gun but misses. Will uses the last of his strength to try to abseil down the cliff but falls and is knocked out.\nLee catches Dawn and attacks her. She manages to knock him over; he bangs his head and dies. Dawn, seeming to experience the paradoxical heat sensation of late stage hypothermia, removes her clothing , guaranteeing her death. She collapses.\nWill comes round at the base of the cliff. He fires his gun into the air. Dawn fires a flare gun in response. In this way they achieve a final communication but neither has the strength to reach the other.\nWill is rescued: the flare his dying wife fired alerted authorities to his plight. He wakes up in hospital with severe frostbite injuries and learns that his wife is dead. A police officer asks him why he went into the frozen wilderness.

In the courthouse later in the day, Oddball is given one last chance at behaving or he will get put down if he enters the city again. That night Swampy finds an injured penguin which has been attacked by a fox on Middle Island and takes him back to his house, where a fox attempts to eat it but is scared off by Oddball. Surprised by Oddball's sudden change in his ability to protect other animals, and realising that someone might be sabotaging the island to turn it into a whale-watching station, he comes up with an idea to save the dwindling number of penguins. Olivia agrees with the idea enthusiastically and names the injured penguin 'Pocket'. They begin training Oddball and eventually convince Emily to go on a holiday to Melbourne with Bradley, where he proposes that they and Olivia move to New York City.

After the penguin numbers are steadily rising, Emily finds out about Swampy's plan after Olivia accidentally blurts it out. Emily eventually approves and warns that Oddball could get into trouble if the council finds out. Swampy assumes that Bradley is sabotaging the penguins because Bradley is so eager about a whale watching idea formed by a man named Rich (Jason Geary). The whale watching station would supplant the penguin sanctuary. That night after going home from dropping Oddball off to the island, Oddball tries to fend off a decoy fox and gets shot by a tranquilizer gun off-screen by an unknown person.

After a brief confrontation Emily calls out to the person, assuming it is Bradley, to stop, but the person is actually revealed to be Zoe. She explains that Rich, the whale watch station promoter, is her boyfriend and wants the whale-watching plan to go through, just so she can get out of her job which she secretly hated. She then grabs Pocket's egg and attempts to stomp on it but is stopped when Emily and Olivia tackle her. Emily accidentally kicks the egg off the cliff but it stops before it can reach the sea.

The firm brings in \"Calamity\" Jane Bodine to manage Castillo's fledging campaign. The opposition's top political consultant is her nemesis, fellow American Pat Candy. In Bolivia, the situation is tense: Bodine learns that the indigenous people, who are a majority in the country but lack any real political power, are protesting for constitutional reform to get proper representation.\nThe American consultants, not knowing the language or the culture of Bolivia, are persuaded by Bodine, a burned out veteran of American politics, to follow a strategy of smear campaigning to make up for their candidate's shortcomings. However, Castillo refuses to give permission for the team to do so. It is only after Bodine arranges for the distribution of a flyer accusing Castillo of a long-ago affair (and blaming it on the opposition) does she finally get him to agree to smear his opponents.\nIn the following months, the team exercises a strategy of \"declaring a crisis\". They plan to frighten the people, with the aim of persuading them to vote for the unsympathetic but known Castillo rather than the younger opposition candidates. They even resort to publishing photos of their enemy with Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie in the background, so that he has to deny being a Nazi. Castillo's bus is stopped by a group of protesters who don't want the International Monetary Fund in Bolivia. Castillo promises them that he will not invite the IMF without a public referendum. Eduardo, a young volunteer of the Castillo campaign, is deeply impressed by this show of commitment. His loyalty comes mostly from the fact that Castillo, who was president at the time, took a young Eduardo on his arm during a rally in his town. Nevertheless, his brothers are much more skeptical about Castillo.\nDuring the final debate, Bodine cites a quote in a conversation with Candy (knowing that he'll give it to rival candidate Rivera for his speech) saying that \"a great man\" said it. Unfortunately, the quote is actually from Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitler's minister of propaganda. Castillo wins the vote by a small margin. As one of his first actions, he invites the IMF into Bolivia, thereby breaking his promise. The deeply disappointed Eduardo visits Bodine in her hotel; Bodine replies that she is not responsible for Castillo's actions. In her eyes, her job is done.\nThe disillusioned Eduardo joins his brothers at a demonstration of people demanding change. The police arrive and the demonstration quickly turns into a riot. Bodine and her crew join Candy on the way to the airport. All of them, except Bodine, have already taken jobs as political consultants in other countries.

The daughter Sophie is on the roof of the vet clinic, laying in a lounger and talking to her friend on the radio. Carla sits at her desk, picks up the overdue $435 radio bill and angrily calls her daughter, who ignores her. Sophie storms into the clinic and argues with her about school life being solitary confinement and how they should move into the city; Carla counters this by suggesting she help out around the house or get a job to help pay the radio bill. Carla sends the children in the house and calls for her friend over the walkie talkie.\nThe bank manager arrives and, during the course of the conversation, it is revealed that their payments are in arrears and the house is being foreclosed, despite Carla's clinic being a new source of income. The snide and sarcastic bank manager tells them they can take the reduced amount of $200,000 for their barn or be forced out in 48 hours, but Adam refuses to sell, as the only reason they are unprofitable is because the sheep keep being attacked and stating that they will never have to leave.

He gets out of his vehicle and as he approaches the house, the pack viciously attacks him before dragging his body into the woods. Adam goes out to his pick-up truck and lets the family know it is safe to come out so they can escape in the truck. Just then, a dog leaps through his window, breaking the glass and biting him. He hits the gas and the truck leaps forward, plowing into the police car and totaling both vehicles.\nCarla hides Sophie and Henry in the pantry, while an injured Adam goes out to the vet clinic to get additional ammo.

After being met with hostility from the plantation workers, they are introduced to an elderly Sim\u00f3n. Sim\u00f3n tells Clarence that Iniko's grandfather, Ose, was friends with her grandfather, Ant\u00f3n. A confused Iniko demands to know what Clarence is really searching for. Clarence tells Iniko about her uncle Kilian and her father Jacobo, then shows Iniko the half-torn picture. A shocked Iniko tells Clarence that the woman in the picture is his mother Bisila. Iniko takes Clarence to the elderly Bisila's home, where Bisila tells Clarence her connection with Kilian.\nFlashing back to 1957, Kilian returns to Bioko. Kilian visits Ose and the Bubi people at their village. Ose reintroduces Bisila (she states her name as Daniela Bisila), her husband Mosi, and their son Iniko to Kilian. Kilian then visits Santa Isabel looking for Jacobo. While there, Gregorio takes a prostitute at gunpoint after arguing over her with another man. Kilian talks Gregorio down and then takes Jacobo, Dick, and Pao back to the estate. The next day, Kilian sends Jacobo on a plane back to Spain. Kilian visits Julia at her parents' store and they discuss the hostile changes of the political climate. Bisila arrives to tell Julia that her friend Gustavo, a local politician, has been attacked. Julia asks Kilian to assist her and Bisila with rescuing Gustavo, smuggling him through military checkpoints. At the estate Bisila, a nurse, attends to Gustavo's wounds. Killian and Bisila almost share a kiss, later meeting in a shed where they profess their connection and make love.

Jacobo makes another advance towards Julia, who tells him to leave. That evening at the estate, Bisila is cornered by a car with a drunken Jacobo, Dick, and Pao inside. They proceed to beat and rape Bisila. Sim\u00f3n finds her, she swears him to secrecy, and tends to her injuries. The next day Kilian returns; Jacobo is in the plantation hospital with syphilis. Dick and Pao's bodies are found hanging from a tree. It is implied that Mosi, Bisila's husband is taking revenge for the rape. Kilian confronts Ose and Sim\u00f3n, they inform him of Bisila's rape, and warn him not to interfere, or Mosi will find out about their affair. Kilian tells Jacobo of Dick and Pao's deaths and then confronts him about Bisila's rape. Kilian beats Jacobo and warns him of Mosi's revenge. Kilian asks Bisila for forgiveness and she hints at Mosi\u2019s attack. Later on Mosi attempts to kill Jacobo but Kilian arrives in the middle of the attack, giving Jacobo time to shoot Mosi dead. Kilian sends Jacobo back to Spain. Bisila tells Kilian that she must leave and mourn Mosi's death for a year, after which she will be free to be with him. Kilian tells Bisila that he will wait for her.\nIn 1968, a new president is elected for the newly independent Republic of Equatorial Guinea, and the Spanish colonists are being forced to leave.

While walking through the cocoa fields Kilian is approached by three angry laborers. They force Killian to go deep into the forest, where he is forced to dig his own grave. A laborer tells Kilian that he originally wanted to kill Jacobo for killing Mosi, but now Kilian will pay the price. Sim\u00f3n arrives and convinces the laborer not to kill Kilian as long as he leaves and takes Bisila with him at the end of her mourning. As Julia and Manuel are preparing to leave for Spain, Julia begs Kilian to leave with them and suggests he bring Bisila along. Julia brings Bisila to her home, marking the end of Bisila's year-long mourning. Bisila arrives with Iniko and her second son Laha, telling Kilian that he is Laha's father. The next day Julia, Manuel, Kilian, Bisila, and Nelson and his wife attempt to leave Bioko by boarding a ship to Spain, with other Spanish colonists and some locals. Julia and Manuel pass through the gate successfully, but a guard prevents Bisila and her children from passing because everyone considered Guinean is prohibited from leaving. The crowd becomes agitated and pushes the gate down, and the guards begin shooting at the crowd. Julia and Manuel escape on to a motorboat where Julia's parents are waiting, while Nelson is shot dead. Kilian and Bisila return to the estate, marry in front of a rock the call the Keeper of the isle, and attempt to live together as a family but Kilian is eventually forced to leave alone.\nIn present-day 2003 Clarence returns to Pasolobino, where she visits the elderly Kilian.

The village and the society are plagued by several social evils, age-old traditions and practices of patriarchy, child marriage, dowry, marital rapes and physical and mental abuse.\nRani is a widow struggling to support her old mother-in-law and teenage son, Gulab. Following village customs, Rani marries Gulab off to a child bride by paying a hefty sum to the bride's family. Meanwhile, Gulab is disrespectful, rebellious, and prefers to loiter with a gang of friends, spending time with sex workers. Janki, the child bride, hopes to stop the marriage by chopping off her hair but is still forced into the relation. Lajjo lives in the same village as Rani, and is a close friend and aid in Rani's struggles. Lajjo is in an abusive marriage with an alcoholic husband, Manoj. Having failed to conceive, Lajjo is mocked for being infertile and therefore worthless in the eyes of her husband and society. The fourth woman is Bijli, an erotic dancer in a travelling entertainment company. Bijli acts as an advisor to both Rani and Lajjo.\nThe movie begins with Rani and Lajjo visiting another village to meet Janki and her family. Meanwhile, Gulab and his friends are seen harassing an educated, working woman, until her husband, Kishan (Sumeet Vyas) approaches. While at Janki's house, Rani receives calls on a cell phone given to her by Gulab. The anonymous calls started off as a wrong number but developed into coy flirting.\nLater, at the Gram Panchayat, the village participates in solving local issues. The first issue is of a girl named Champa who ran away from her husband and tried to return to her parents. The Panchayat forces her to return despite her revelation that her husband's male family members all rape her. Kishan and his wife try intervening but are ridiculed for their progressive opinions.\nKishan is a forward thinking local entrepreneur and employs women in the village for craft and handloom jobs. The women reveal at the Panchayat that Kishan has secured a large contract for their handicrafts and so they are prepared to save money for the installation of televisions. The elders reluctantly agree and this angers some men in the village, including Gulab, who resent Kishan for trying to liberate the women.\nThe conservative and patriarchal village men are seen to be constantly visiting Bijli. She has been increasingly turning down offers for sex work which irks her boss, who threatens to replace her with a new younger girl Rekha (Tanya Sachdeva). Gulab's unhappy marriage exacerbates his anger issues and poor attitude towards women. Janki is repeatedly beaten and raped by Gulab.\nAfter being threatened by a pimp, Gulab and his friends take out their anger on Kishan. First they destroy his handicraft goods, and later on they violently beat him, prompting Kishan and his wife to leave the village.\nFrustrated, Bijli picks up Rani, Lajjo and Janki, and visit a local fort. Lajjo realizes that her husband, not her, may be the infertile one. In an experiment, Lajjo has sex with Bijli's lover and becomes pregnant. Bijli returns to the company to find that her dancing spot has been given to Rekha. She resorts to engaging in traumatic rough sex with multiple men in order to make money.\nRani discovers that Gulab has stolen her last bit of savings and confronts him.

She relieves Janki of her marriage, allowing her to reunite with her childhood sweetheart and continue with her studies.\nLajjo informs Manoj of her pregnancy and he begins to beat her, implying that he was aware of his infertility.

The man, known as Jude Rosario in the opening sequence, is shown to be Captain Daniyal Khan, a dead-end ex-soldier with a completely deadpan sense of life and death which is pulled out of oblivion and pressed into service by the spy agency to wreak vengeance on the men who planned the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. He agrees on the assurance that he will be reinstated in the Indian army to the same rank from which he was court-martialled, which meant regaining the respect of his estranged father, retd. Col. Usman Khan, and mentor, Dilawar Singh. His only team member, Nawaz Mistry helps him find his first target Sajid Mir at a cricket match in London.

He contacts Nawaz in order to acquire money to buy a battery, as a replacement for another one which holds a certain poison. The poison, (succinylcholine), is untraceable as it can kill a person when it touches the tongue, causing a heart attack. After killing Headley by plugging the poisonous battery into a showerhead he usually uses, Brody, who supposedly died upon falling in the river, is found alive, and Daniyal is released as his earlier sentence is rendered null and void. Meanwhile, ISI agents gather information about him.\nDaniyal and Nawaz travel to Syria via Lebanon, to get in touch with the fighters of Lashkar-e-Toiba. There, Daniyal is held captive by the L-e-T and is forced into revealing the purpose of killing Sajid Mir and David Headley, on camera. The chief of L-e-T in Syria tries his best to send the video of Daniyal's confession to ISI, but the war-torn situation of Syria has led to a mass disruption of communication networks. Nawaz, with her team of soldiers, kills the subordinates of L-e-T, much to the chagrin of Daniyal. Subsequently, Daniyal, Nawaz, and the team escape from the clutches of the L-e-T after a bloody gunfight. Daniyal manages to kill the Syrian chief of L-e-T, just before he is about to send the video to the ISI, and destroys the recordings. Subsequently, the ISI kills the Indian Consulate General of Jordan, Mr. Rajan Sampath, in a gas explosion, similar to the killing of Sajid Mir, as a revenge attack. The RAW chief Roy reprimands Daniyal for unnecessarily killing someone who was not meant to be killed and asks him to call off the mission. Nawaz encourages Daniyal to carry on the mission to avenge the 2008 Mumbai Attacks by killing the direct people who orchestrated the whole mission. She offers to take him and herself to Pakistan.\nDaniyal and Nawaz go to Pakistan to take down the last two perpetrators, Sahabuddin Umvi and Haaris Saeed. There, they make plans of killing Saeed with the help of a local restaurant owner and RAW agent Khalid, by an explosive planted in the mic used during his public rally. However, their plan fails, leading Daniyal to pursue Saeed in a car and shoot him dead, also causing an explosion. Umvi is killed with the help of a nurse Amina Bi, a mother who lost her militant son in a suicide attack, who replaces his regular medicine with poison, later shooting herself after the police find her at her home.\nWith the Pakistani army and ISI pursuing them, Daniyal and Nawaz make their way to the coast to escape through the Arabian sea. Their accomplices get caught and interrogated for information or are killed. While they are escaping on a boat, the Pakistani military finds out about it and sends patrol boats to apprehend them. While hiding in the waters with Nawaz, Daniyal gets shot by the military and dies. Nawaz later gets rescued by the Indian Navy, after they leave.

He refers to this state as a \"Phantom\", but if he spends too much time away from his body, he will begin to fade away before disappearing entirely.\nMeanwhile, NYPD Lieutenant Alex Tanner is demoted by his boss, Captain Simon, and assigned grunt work after he manages to catch two burglars robbing a supermarket, but blows up part of the building in the process. Leo is taken to the hospital for more tests, as his illness worsens. He laments over the loss of his hair and follows his mother home as a phantom.

Expository text explains that, since 1997, the United States military has been engaged in a covert war against \"forces of unknown origin\", and that \"57 incidents have spread across Asia, Europe and Russia.\" It goes on to note that NATO notes that alien invasion forces will reach populated areas within two years, and that the conflict itself is in retaliation for an incident in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997. The film notes that it is dedicated to \"members of the intelligence community who provided evidence that made the film possible\".\nTying into the film's viral campaign, the film introduces the disappearance of four Arizona men. Heaven's Gate cult member Walton S. Gayson (Adamthwaite), initially held as a suspect in the murder of the four men, was taken into federal custody. Later, the search for the men was suspended, concluding that the four men had been killed in a bear attack, a conclusion which the local medical examiner denies, but was ordered to list as the cause of death.\nThe documentary style film moves between two complementary plotlines; the first is a filmed interview with an unidentified Air Force pilot who exposes, despite likely repercussions, the truth about what happened to four missing civilian men on the night of the Phoenix Lights. The second plotline comes from recovered filmed footage (\"The Lauder Tapes\") by one of four men: Glenn Lauder (Lowenthal), Mitch Adams (Willingham), Ryan Stone (Baker) and Jacob Reynolds (O'Brien). Lauder cannibalizes several different cameras, even duct taping a camcorder to the side of his ATV helmet. It is from these cameras that most of the footage is derived.\nThe interviewed officer details how the military detected the approach of a triangular-shaped object in the tail of the passing Hale-Bopp comet until it began to descend into Earth's atmosphere over Arizona. Later, the object goes missing and two KH satellites in the area had stopped transmitting.\nThe men decide to go out to the foothills by the Sierra Estrella to spend time together and ride their ATVs. Mitch, whose brother was a former US Marine is excited about the trip, his friends substantially less so. While packing their truck for the trip, the men notice a growing military air presence in the area, first helicopters and then F-15 fighter jets and A-10's, as well as odd atmospheric disturbances. When they embark on their trip in Ryan's truck, it suddenly breaks down in the foothills. Jacob tries to repair the damage to the vehicle while the others try to find someplace to call for Roadside assistance. They come across a desert compound, protected by an electrified fence, owned by the reclusive Walton S. Gayson. A highly agitated Gayson accosts Jacob at the truck, warning him that they must leave immediately. Despite the warning, the men set off in their ATVs into the foothills anyway.\nFurther questioned, the Air Force officer details how several \"bogeys\" had entered Nevada's airspace before turning towards Phoenix. By this time, several eyewitnesses had already seen the multiple crafts, and Operation Snowbird goes into effect: a diversion operation to distract the civilian population with decoy flares while an aerial dogfight ensues between Air Force jets and the unidentified craft at the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range.\nThe four men witness the dogfight when an alien craft is disabled and crashes into a nearby hill. Mitch's brother had been killed in a helicopter crash, so he decides to try and render aid to what he presumes is a human pilot. Upon reaching the downed craft, before the military can respond, the men are attacked by defensive creatures that faintly resembles man-sized scorpions; Jacob is severely injured in the attack. Their ATVs are destroyed by the aliens, and they take refuge in Gayson's compound. Gayson has been awaiting the coming of the creatures for years to be abducted and taken to a \"higher plane\" of existence, so he turns off the electric fence, letting the creatures in.\nIn the final act, Jacob is abducted, and Mitch is ripped apart in an attempt to defend Ryan and Glenn, who are almost rescued by a military helicopter. After the helicopter is shot down by one of the UFOs, Ryan distracts the creatures before being dragged off by one of them and Glenn runs into a vehicle to hide from them, before making a run for it alone. However, just as it seems he has escaped, one of the aliens attacks him. As his helmet flies off, Glenn is killed out of the view of the camcorder before the creature disappears, and one of the alien spacecraft slowly leaves the area. Gayson later finds the helmet and recovers the camcorder's film.\nIn a post-credits scene, it is revealed that Gayson escaped prison shortly after his interview.

Although Devin and Amps are privately dubious about Carter's usefulness, the team members express their optimism and excitement for the project in taped interviews that Perry arranges.  Perry explains that their funding only allows for five subjects, so they must proceed slowly and carefully.  As they set up the equipment, Amps and Carter bond.  Devin confides to Perry that his father, a scientist, experienced his greatest regret in having his work finished by later teams, and Devin says he wants to push this experiment all the way.\nTheir first subject is an insect.  When the experiment fails, Devin suggests that since the experiment was designed around mammals, they should abandon tests on insects.  Perry reluctantly agrees, and Amps recalibrates the equipment for a mouse.  Carter, initially supportive of the idea, becomes reluctant when it comes time to kill the mouse, which the others refused to let him name.  The experiment is once again a failure.  Carter and Devin give up for the day, but Amps convinces Perry to set up a second test on the same subject.  Amps becomes demoralized when this also results in failure.  When Carter walks through the lab that night, he notices the mouse's body has moved.  He excitedly wakes the others, and they celebrate.  Carter later approaches Perry privately and cautiously suggests that one of the team members may have moved the mouse to raise morale.  Perry reassures him that he has the situation under control.\nFurther tests prove failures.  Frustrated, Devin requests Carter contact the grant organization and request money for more tests.  Carter is incensed when he finds that Perry has lied to them; there is no grant, and Perry is bankrolling the experiment privately.  Carter quits the project, citing legal and moral implications, though Devin elects to stay.  Perry and Devin do not explain the situation to Amps.  Devin pushes for a larger mammal, which he says will be easier to test, and Perry allows the use of a rabbit, though he cautions Devin that to maintain public acceptance they must avoid animal testing on anything larger.  Devin and Perry become further estranged when Perry learns Devin has joined to project for personal reasons \u2013 his sister is near death, and Devin intends to reanimate her.  Perry angrily reminds Devin that human experimentation is not possible.\nAfter promising results, Amps' updated calculations reveal that the second subject, the mouse, could not have moved.

Seeing no alternative, Devin commits suicide to force them to test the machine on him.  The result is initially a success, but the others are quickly horrified to learn that Devin's memory and personality have been wiped; he does not even understand how to speak.

She sings her unfinished song \"Flashlight,\" impressing them; they decide she can join, as since she came of her own accord, they technically aren't breaking any rules. The Bellas meet DSM when the latter performs at a car show; the group, led by intimidating duo Pieter Kr\u00e4mer and Kommissar, takes delight in mocking the Bellas. Later, both groups are invited to an exclusive riff-off; also in attendance are the Treblemakers, the Tone Hangers (a group composed of former Treblemakers, including previous leader Bumper Allen, with whom Amy is in a no-strings-attached relationship), and the Green Bay Packers.\nThe Bellas make it to the final two, but lose to DSM when Emily panics and sings \"Flashlight\", violating the tradition of singing non-original songs. Bumper surprises Amy with a traditional date and asks her to officially be his girlfriend; she refuses, leaving him devastated. At a practice performance for the Worlds, the Bellas' planned set ends in disaster when their incorporation of pyrotechnics sets Cynthia Rose's hair on fire. In order to rediscover their roots and synchronicity, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former Bella Aubrey Posen. The truth about Beca's internship comes out, and she starts a heated debate with Chloe over her obsession with the group and accuses the other Bellas of not thinking about their futures. She angrily storms off, only to step into one of the camp's hidden bear traps. In a panic, she apologizes for her harsh words, before being saved by Lilly. Later, the Bellas accept that they must go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing \"Cups\", the song Beca used to audition for the group.\nAmy realizes she regrets ending things with Bumper, and the two reconcile the next day. Meanwhile, Beca's boss at her internship has been unimpressed with everything she has presented to him so far, so Beca offers to help Emily produce \"Flashlight\" at the studio to demonstrate her true abilities. When they show him the demo, he expresses envy for their talent and says he looks forward to working with them. The senior Bellas graduate, and the group heads to Copenhagen for the World Finals. Before their performance, Emily and Benji share a kiss. The Bellas deliver a stellar stripped-down performance, ending in a harmonized version of \"Flashlight\" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. They win the championship, repairing their damaged legacy.

Despite Balu's request to execute him as a martyr by shooting, the court orders that he be hanged within a month's time by a professional executioner or hangman. He is escorted to a high security prison complex in Chennai by Macaulay, an honest, law-abiding police officer who is given the charge of monitoring him until his execution. The prison provides freedom to all prisoners, including Balu, to do whatever they want, as long as they do not cause unrest. Balu is instantly admired by the inmates for his patriotism and philosophy, as well as his empathy with the inmates. They view him as a spokesperson to the prison officials on behalf of them.\nMeanwhile, Macaulay searches for a hangman and learns of Yamalingam, an executioner who has had a disdain of execution since his teens due to remorse of hanging an innocent man who was wrongly accused.

To justify his actions, Balu took to violence and tried suicide bombing the Indian Army but failed due to Kuyili's reluctance to kill him. He was apprehended and jailed in Delhi.

Virginia criticizes Catherine for having had unhealthy and codependent relationships with James and her father, and for choosing to live as her father's administrative support instead of attempting her own artistic career. In turn, Catherine derides Virginia for her aimless, unemployed lifestyle. Despite their arguments, Virginia assures Catherine that she truly cares about her and wants to see her heal. Catherine begins painting a portrait of Virginia as the two spend their evenings discussing their personal relationships.\nCatherine's mental health gradually unravels during her stay: she has a strange encounter with a neighbor who warns her that Virginia's parents are bad people; she has difficulty sleeping and eating; and she is increasingly paranoid over Rich's presence, believing him to be driving a wedge between her and Virginia in his sexual pursuit of the latter, which an annoyed Virginia denies. As Virginia becomes concerned over Catherine's well-being, a clearly unwell Catherine worries that she and Rich believe her to be crazy. After Catherine has a disturbed reaction to Rich's observation that she had been talking to herself the night before, Virginia remarks that she is finally seeing Catherine for the first time: she had initially thought Catherine was perfect, but now realizes that she had surrounded herself with men to protect her weak and fragile sense of self.

Virginia insists that she also cares about Catherine, which Catherine casually denies.\nAfter Virginia and Rich take Catherine out on a canoe ride, Virginia observes and then listens in as Catherine describes the event to someone on the phone. She assumes Catherine is speaking with James, but it is left ambiguous as to whether an unstable Catherine is envisioning herself conversing with her late father. That night, Virginia throws a party for some neighbors, and Catherine imagines increasingly hostile interactions with the guests, including a confrontation over her father's embezzlement, ending with her screaming as all of the guests grab at her. After coming to her senses, she flees. She begins to lose awareness of time and her surroundings, and after a dinner where Rich mocks her mental struggles and callously suggests she could use her recent grief to promote a new art career, she calmly gives Rich a disjointed but withering lecture, blaming him for being an embodiment of all the worst things in the world. \nThe next morning, Catherine confronts Rich and blames him for getting in the way of what should have been her week with Virginia, but he remains unsympathetic, confessing that he hates her because he considers her a spoiled brat. Catherine ineffectually attempts to strangle him, then suffers a nervous breakdown, leading a stunned Virginia to realize that Catherine's issues are greater than her own the previous year, and she is far beyond her help.

The girl watches a reality TV series called Re-Kill that broadcasts live footage of R-Division squads.  Commercials interrupt the show, showing attempts to repopulate the United States and reassure the populace.\nThe show begins with a recap.  An embedded journalist accompanies a squad on a raid to New Orleans, which has had reports of zombie activity.  The squad is overrun, and only two people make it to a car: Alex Winston and the journalist.  When the journalist stops speaking coherently and moans uncontrollably, Winston realizes she is infected and shoots her.  The government promises that the situation is under control and clears out the zombies.  Winston is reassigned to Division 6, which includes new recruit Tom Falkirk, former thief Omar Hernandez, immigrant Nguyen, Rose Matthews, \"Grizzly\" Adams, conspiracy theorist Trent Parker, and the squad leader, Sarge.\nAlong with embedded journalists Jimmy and Bobby, Division 8 is sent to investigate reports of a family who are harboring reanimated members.  Sarge explains that the outbreak spread so far because people could not give up hope their loved ones could be saved.  After neutralizing the human resistance, the soldiers rescue prisoners kept chained up for zombie food.  One of the family members reveals that his sister, a zombie, is kept in the attic.  Before she can be put down, she bites Tom, who is mercy-killed to prevent him from turning into a zombie.  In interviews, Parker is dismissive of Tom's sacrifice, and Sarge says that it is a known risk of the job.\nDivision 8's next job is to investigate a truck suspected of carrying contraband.  When they finally stop the truck, they find it contains zombies.  Sarge uses a rocket-propelled grenade to clear out the zombies.  The truckers initially profess ignorance of their cargo but eventually confirm rumors of the Judas Project, a shadowy program rumored to be an experiment on the zombies trapped in New York City.  Parker believes it to be a secret military project, but Sarge is more concerned with the possibility of a second outbreak, which he believes is inevitable due to human nature.\nIn the forbidden areas of New York City known as The Zone, they discover dead scientists and zombies who seem more intelligent.  After an ambush, Omar insists that Parker was bit and demands they kill him.  Before they kill him, Parker opens fire on the squad, killing Adams.  Winston is wounded next, and he sacrifices himself with a grenade to allow the others to escape.  In a previously recorded interview, he describes his belief that the government has secretly organized an ark for eligible survivors; he posthumously wishes the squad well and hopes they are accepted there.  Deeper in the Zone, Hernandez is bitten and turns.\nAs the squad faces a horde of zombies, including Hernandez, a man who claims to be the last remaining member of the Judas Project leads them to safety but Nguyen falls behind and is killed.  He explains the project was designed to turn the zombies against each other, but it instead revealed an alpha zombie, nicknamed Elvis, capable of leading a zombie army.  Jimmy says the network's drones will pick up and broadcast his and Bobby's footage every two hours.  As they perform reconnaissance, Bobby dies, alerting the zombie army.  The squad flees, but Sarge and the Scientist are killed by the horde. Elvis appears and kills Jimmy and throws Rose a window. He tries strangling her to death but she kills him and escapes The Zone. As a special news report reveals zombie activity near the Zone and the start of a new outbreak, the young girl who was watching the program is revealed to have transformed into a zombie.

Before dying, future Rigby also reveals future Mordecai shot him, shocking the group, and tells Rigby that he will soon have to reveal a secret from his past to save the universe, even if it costs him his friendship with Mordecai.

Mr. Ross then tries to kill Mordecai with a volleyball bomb, but future Mordecai, having a change of heart, jumps into the bomb's path, forcing Mr. Ross to retreat.\nEnraged at Rigby's duplicity, Mordecai ends his friendship with him, prompting a heartbroken Rigby to run off with the timeship and leave the group behind. Before dying, future Mordecai gives his present self his timeship and instructs him to patch things up, saying what Rigby did was no excuse to side with Mr. Ross.

After the group meets the owner of the resort, Valerie Wilton, Archer sees Sadie sneak into a control room.  There, she hacks into a mainframe, causing the system to become erratic.  The engineers, scared they could lose their jobs due to their careless system security, keep quiet about the problems as they attempt to fix the system.\nAfter meeting their guide, Nevins, the guests leave the resort to hunt zombies.

He built the company into the world's largest retailer. Shocked by reports of anti-Jewish pogroms in Russia, he realizes that America's treatment of Negroes is no better and marshals his fortune to improving their condition.\nHe develops a friendship with Booker T. Washington, donates money as a philanthropist to Tuskegee Institute, and helps support a model project for Tuskegee architects to design and the school staff to oversee operate simple schoolhouses intended for the rural South.\nAfter Washington's death in 1915, Rosenwald set up his Rosenwald Foundation in 1917 to expand the scale of the school construction project; the foundation primarily funded rural schools for African-American children in the South. It was based on offering matching construction funds to communities, and gaining white school board approval and commitment for operating funds. Local communities conducted fundraising and sweat equity participation, with some also donating land for these schools. By Rosenwald's death in 1932, some 5,357 of the informally named Rosenwald schools had been built. They comprised about one-third of all elementary schools available for African Americans prior to the 1954 US Supreme Court ruling in Brown vs. Board of Education that segregated public schools were unconstitutional.\nOther Rosenwald-supported projects depicted in the film include establishing 25 YMCA-YWCAs for African Americans, founding the Museum of Science and Industry, building the Michigan Boulevard Garden Apartments, a housing project for some of the many blacks moving to Chicago in the Great Migration; and helped pay for the training of the Tuskegee Airmen.

Emperor Singhana of the Devagiri Empire also wishes to conquer the Kakatiyas and name his grandson and heir, Mahadeva, as the king. Meanwhile, Ganapati's wife is pregnant. Everyone prays for a boy child, because a prince can repel the Devagiri Empire and serve as a successor to the throne. A priest working for Murari and Hari Hara predicts Ganapati's baby will be a girl who will be the saviour of the kingdom.\nGanapati's baby indeed turns out to be a girl, Rudramadevi (Anushka Shetty).

Despite this, Rudrama wins the challenge, making her adored by several princesses in the scene, including Muktamba (Nithya Menen). Gona Ganna Reddy, one of Rudrama's playmates in childhood and who was then thrown out of the palace and is now called a traitor, shows up in the scene to confront Rudrama. Gona is now the leader of an opposition army, which has been a threat to Ganapati's position. He manages to escape when Ganapati's army tries to arrest him.\nGanapati, unable to escape from the pressure from inside and outside his palace, decides to get Rudrama married to a princess, and he chooses Muktamba. On their wedding night, Rudrama, in order to protect her secret, tells Muktamba that she has taken a vow of celibacy until the kingdom is safe.

Due to him also being a loner, drifter, and having illegally entered the country years before, he is labeled as the prime suspect of the killings. He also falls under suspicion after being accused of having an inappropriate relationship with Grace Putnam, the young daughter of religious missionary Duane, who is a friend of Salazar's; other residents acknowledge the dynamic was innocent.

Interviews with residents, families of victims, and Salazar's sister give mixed opinions on Salazar's character and guilt. Salazar himself is ambivalent about the trial, and grants only one interview with a criminal psychologist. He claims that he brought his camera along on the night of June 2 to document the events, but lost the footage while escaping; however, one camera roll is eventually discovered by a resident who had initially apprehended him, and forwarded to an independent journalist working on the case.\nThough the photographs are dismissed by his lawyer, the police, and the courts as being doctored, a professional photographer and Border Patrol specialist examine the camera roll, determine it as genuine, and piece together what must have happened that night, which corroborates Salazar's sole interview: at his house on the outskirts of town, Salazar was visited by a young man and friend suffering from mysterious wounds and blood loss. After the young man dies while Salazar attempts to call for help, he suddenly comes back to life and violently attacks Salazar, who is forced to kill him again. Salazar exits his house and witnesses mysterious figures approaching from the hills near his home. While running to Sangre De Cristo for help, he encounters another resident, a professional hunter who shoots the approaching zombies but is unable to kill them before being overcome. Salazar photographs a number of disturbing images of violent, contorted zombies attacking, devouring, and turning residents before attempting to make his way to the church to find the Putnams. However, he discovers that the horde has already descended upon the church, and it is revealed that Duane was driven insane after being turned and killed everyone in his family except for Grace, before committing suicide. Salazar, having keys to abandoned buildings in town due to his work as a handyman, runs and hides until he reaches the town's daycare center, which has been overrun by zombies. There he finds Grace, who is separated from him by a gated window, and he is forced to watch her be devoured.\nSome praise Salazar's bravery for documenting the night, while others dismiss the photographs as fake or criticize him for not doing more to help the residents.

Though Fabinho and Val have a close relationship it comes at the expense of her relationship with her daughter who continues to live in Pernambuco and harbours anger towards her mother for always being away.

Val is extremely shocked that she received this call from her daughter. Val is very surprised because she has not spoken to her daughter in years. Val, who lives in the house with the family she cleans for, asks them for permission to let Jessica stay while she searches for an apartment for the two of them.

Deepa who plays the lead role, is the star of the evening, but expresses no joy despite the audience's approval. Next week, she is being married off, against her wishes, to a young industrialist by the name of Debashish Bhatto and this is her last show. Deepa has nothing against Debashis. He is good-looking, extremely well-to-do and interested in the arts, but she is in love with someone else. She dare not tell her family about him because all hell would then break loose.\nNripati Laha, the founder member of the group, and Deepa's brother Vijay look forward to the wedding as they both have much to gain from this alliance. Nripati hopes to get a solid sponsorship for the Swapnochari through Debashis's \u2018Bhatta Group of Industries\u2019. However, there are several others who are not so happy. Prabal Gupta, the director of the group theater is not only unhappy, but angry at the bargain. He considers Deepa to be his creation as he is the one who had trained her painstakingly into becoming the actress she is today. Deepa leaving the group means that the lead actress would be gone. Deepa's wedding takes place right on schedule the week after the show. All the members of the group attend and all put up a joyous front. Debashis is already enchanted by his beautiful bride; the only thing that bothers him is the sullen expression on her face.\nDebashis's fleeting anxiety about his bride's state of mind turns out to be eerily clairvoyant. When he tries to pull her into his arms after they are alone in their flower-bedecked bedroom that night, she draws back and informs him that she is in love with someone else. Debashis is stunned.\nDebashis takes some time to digest this, but eventually offers to give her a divorce so that she can marry the man she loves. However, Deepa is not ready for that either. It would be impossible for her to go back to her family. She pleads with him to let her stay on in his household as his legal wife until her lover is ready. Then she will ask him to grant her a divorce.\nThe very same night \u2014 the night of Deepa's wedding \u2013a beggar is killed on the streets of Kolkata. The sky is strangely dark and, just before the murder, crows gather inexplicably on the overhead wires and railings of the nearby park as if in foreboding of something evil. No one pays much attention to the news of the murder the next morning and among those who do; many feel that there are too many beggars in Kolkata anyway. In any case, the story is hardly noticed as it is featured in a small unnoticeable corner in one of the back pages. Such murders are common enough occurrences in big cities to merit much attention; the only thing uncommon being the murder weapon: a porcupine quill driven clean through the heart of the victim from the back.\nOne person does notice it though \u2014  Byomkesh Bakshi whose habit it is to read several papers from end to end every morning looking for exactly such small, unnoticed stories. As Byomkesh tells his dear friend and assistant Ajit of the incident and rues the fact that killers of Kolkata are becoming creative these days, footsteps are heard on the staircase outside followed by the ringing of the doorbell. It is Deepa's brother Vijay. He looks distraught and appeals to Byomkesh for help. It appears that Vijay had been to visit Debashis and Deepa the morning after the wedding and that Debashis had blamed him and Nripati squarely for having been architects of this marriage when they knew fully well that Deepa had a secret lover. Debashis also told him that the marriage had not been consummated because of this complication. Vijay now wants Byomkesh to help him find Deepa's secret lover. Once he knows the guy's name, Vijay will fix him so that he never dares to disturb Deepa again. Byomkesh tells Vijay that his job is not to look for secret lovers of women especially since in this case, Deepa is in no way to blame for a marriage that has been forced upon her. Byomkesh is far more interested in the mystery of the beggar murdered with the porcupine quill. Coincidentally, the DC DD of Kolkata police has just rung him up to solicit his help in solving the strange case of the porcupine quill murder.\nMeanwhile, Deepa's unusual married life continues. She and Debashis are courteous to each other, but no more than that. They sleep in separate bedrooms but put up an appearance of conjugal bliss in front of outsiders. Deepa refuses to meet anyone, especially her family members; she remains mainly at home and keeps entirely to herself. Soon after, she receives a gift packet with no name on it. When she opens it, she finds a beautiful pair of designer earrings made of some strange horn like substance. She puts them on, more out of curiosity than anything else, and then decides to keep them on as they are so striking in appearance. Yet another gift comes along \u2014 this time from \u2019a real sender\u2019. Debashis hands her a mobile phone. He has been feeling sorry for her despite what she has done to him and has bought her the phone so that she may at least keep in touch with her friends.\nOnce she is alone in her room, Deepa starts sending text messages to a certain number instead of calling anyone.

She tells him that Dietrich was convinced of the existence of a race of \"Aryan god-men\", described as superhuman beings with god-like powers who have been living in the forest for millions of years, and the purpose of the mission is to find a relic that will permit the SS to have the \"god-men\" use their powers to help the Reich win the war.\nOne by one, Fleischer's men are killed in strange and horrible ways.

He works stoically, seemingly having been numbed by the daily attrocities. Among the dead after a gassing, Saul sees a boy who is still barely alive suffocated by a Nazi doctor who calls for an autopsy on the boy. Saul steps forth and insists on carrying the body himself to the prison doctor, Mikl\u00f3s Nyiszli, a fellow Hungarian prisoner and a forced assistant to Josef Mengele. He asks Mikl\u00f3s to not cut up the boy, so he can give him a proper Jewish burial. Mikl\u00f3s declines, but says he can have five minutes alone with the boy tonight, before the cremation. Saul goes in search of a Rabbi to perform the funeral ritual. He goes to Rabbi Frankel in the crematorium, who dismisses Saul's concern and suggests that Saul perform the burial himself.\nSaul overhears Sonderkommando Abraham talk about an uprising against the SS-guards with Oberkapo Biederman (Urs Rechn). Biederman first wants to photograph the camp's horrors using a camera collected from the clothing of an earlier murdered caravan, and smuggle the pictures outside to attract attention and help. Saul asks for another rabbi and Abraham tells him of \"the Renegade,\" a Greek Rabbi who has lost his faith. Saul in return offers his assistance in their plan and is instructed to go with a prisoner (Katz) to repair a shack; he is given a piece of jewellery for use as a bribe in case he's caught. When Saul and Katz arrive at the shack, Saul pretends to fix the front door's lock, while Katz takes out a camera from inside the shack and starts to take pictures of the cremation. Saul hears the guards and hides the camera outside in a drain. The guards search the shack, only to find nothing.\nSaul then sneaks onto a truck for another Sonderkommando unit, heading to a nearby riverbank, where the ashes from the crematoria are dumped into the river. Saul finds the Renegade, who refuses to help him. Saul then threatens to alert the Oberkapo of the unit, Mietek, that the Renegade is a rabbi by reciting a Jewish blessing. When the Renegade refuses yet again Saul throws the man's shovel into the water. The rabbi jumps into the river to retrieve the shovel or drown himself. Saul, who can't swim, manages to bring the Renegade back to the riverbank and both are then taken to the SS-commandant of the unit. After an interrogation, the Renegade is executed and Saul is allowed to go back to the unit.\nSaul is then confronted by Mietek, who realizes that he is from another unit. To mollify Mietek, Saul gives him the piece of jewellery. Back at the concentration camp, following roll call, Saul sneaks into Mikl\u00f3s's office where he is caught by a group of Nazi officers. One of them pushes Saul around like a puppet and makes a mockery of Jewish dances, finally forcing him out of the room. After searching in vain for the boy's body, Saul confronts Mikl\u00f3s, who assures him that he has hidden it from the other doctors for safety. Saul sneaks into the autopsy room and takes the body back to his own barrack in a sack.\nThat night, Saul is summoned to clean the dinner tables by SS-commandant Moll. Biederman walks in and is ordered to write up a list of seventy names. This leads Biederman to believe that his unit will soon be killed. Biederman discloses the information to Abraham, who instructs Saul to head to the women's camp, where he will pick up a smuggled package of gunpowder from a prisoner named Ella. When Saul finds himself face to face with Ella, it is clear they know each other. She calls him by name and clasps his hand, but he withdraws. After collecting the package, Saul deliberately falls into a line of newly arrived Hungarian Jews, who are being led into the woods for execution. Saul, again, looks for a rabbi among the arrivals. A Frenchman named Braun approaches him and convinces Saul that he is a rabbi. Saul disguises Braun as a member of the Sonderkommando and sneaks him into the camp.

On further questioning, he says that the murdered boy is his illegitimate son, an assertion Abraham says is not true.\nThe next morning during roll call, Mikl\u00f3s finds Saul and tells him that he needs a replacement body, similar to the one Saul has taken. The prisoners are then summoned into the crematorium to get back to work, where they discover that Biederman and his unit have been murdered by the SS.

Cameron grudgingly accepts to help, even though he doesn't feel he is going to remain at the school for long.\nVazquez, looking for more kids to join the engineering club, talks to teacher Gwen Kolinsky, who recommends Cristian Arcega. After agreeing to help, Arcega takes the technical lead of the project and sketches an early design of the potential robot. Before starting to build it, Cameron suggests a prototype so they can do a proof of concept model.\nCameron starts to learn about the competition rules and requirements, which demands the robot to successfully complete a series of underwater tasks. Kolinsky offers to help teaching him about the PBASIC programming language, to implement the robot's intelligence module.\nAfter catching Santillan stealing from the principal's car, Cameron forces him to join the team and the now named Robotics Academic Club, so he can help with the mechanical design and building of the prototype. They later recruit Luis Aranda, for being strong enough to help lift the machine in and out of the pool.\nBecause of a lack of funds to see the project through, the team starts looking for spare parts and asking for donations from the local businesses, which raise $663.53, plus $134.63 given by Cameron himself. The small budget forces them to scale back the original design and to innovate in how the robot is constructed, including the glue which gives the robot its name, \"Stinky\".\nNeeding to go from Phoenix to Santa Barbara creates problems because three of the four boys were illegal immigrants from Mexico.

The Phoenix teenagers scraped together less than $1,000 and built their robot out of scavenged parts. Yet their robot finishes the practical segment of the competition in fourth place with 75 points after missing three tasks.

The Parkers admit to Rae that they were forced to leave Coonaburra to escape the attention. Catherine becomes frustrated with Matthew's focus on his job as a pharmacist, though he insists that he has no choice, since the community needs his services. Rae's queries in town reveal that Lily had indeed multiple sexual relationships despite being underage (she's fifteen). When Catherine finds Lily's diary she reluctantly reads it. It's irate/angsty with hyper-sexualised imagery and includes pictures and poetry about several people: McPherson, the Parker's mentally handicapped handyman Burtie, and a local youth nicknamed Slug. It also describes her parents' marriage as a sham, which causes Catherine to cry. Catherine hands the diary to Rae with the proviso that he not reveal it to Matthew.\nMatthew drives to Coonaburra, where he questions and threatens McPherson. Coreen, Rae's girlfriend and Burtie's sister, becomes annoyed when Rae won't share details of the case with her. She's also jealous, fearing Rae is attracted to Catherine. Rae secretly shreds the evidence from the diary that connects Burtie to Lily and discourages Burtie from telling him anything incriminating. Rae arrests Slug, but without any evidence of an actual crime, must release him. When the kids remain missing, the town organises a search party. Matthew refuses to participate, further angering Catherine. Rae suggests to Catherine that her children could have run away for a reason closer to home. Catherine confronts Matthew with Lily's sexual history and asks if he ever molested her. Incredulous, he denies it and asks why she would even ask; she cites his apparent reluctance to help find the kids. Knowing now that Burtie had a sexual relationship with Lily, Matthew beats up Burtie and searches his house. Coreen demands Rae arrest Matthew, and when she accuses him of taking the Parkers' side, Rae reveals Burtie's connection.\nBurtie visits the Parkers and asks to speak with Matthew. Catherine invites him in, but he leaves when she attempts to seduce him in Lily's clothes. When Matthew drives into the desert alone, in the opposite direction of the other searchers, he finds Tom dehydrated and delirious. Tom initially refuses to speak, so Catherine yells at him; Tom eventually tells Matthew that he saw Lily get into a car. Catherine listens as locals discuss Lily's disappearance and likely death, and becomes distraught when she receives prank calls that call Lily \"a whore\". Desperate, she visits Rae, and when she fails to seduce him, wanders into the desert night, alone. Unsure why she's hated or has done wrong, she despairs. Next morning, traumatised and stripped naked, she reappears in town; gathering all to gawp. Matthew rescues her, then tenderly bathes her. In bed together, as they hold each other, Catherine admits that she hid the diary from Matthew, and Matthew reveals he saw the kids leave that night.  He admits he did not stop them because, angry with Lily, he wanted to punish her. Catherine hugs Tom and walks onto the porch, where she and Matthew console each other.

The old woman introduces herself as Kathryn, and the younger woman as her daughter, Milja. Kathryn offers the Survivalist some jewellery and seeds in exchange for some of his crops, but he declines, all the while holding them at gunpoint. Finally, Kathryn offers him Milja, and an agreement is made for sex with the young woman in exchange for food. The Survivalist locks Kathryn in a back room while he and Milja have sex.\nThe following morning, the Survivalist tells the women to take their belongings and leave. Kathryn steps outside and Milja is about to join her, when suddenly she returns inside and takes a razor and some soap. Milja caresses his face, before softly shaving him.\nKathryn and Milja have been allowed to stay. Over the following days, they fall into an uneasy domestic routine alongside the Survivalist; they farm during the day, eat dinner together in the evening, and then Milja and the Survivalist have sex every night. However, Kathryn and Milja plan to secretly kill the Survivalist in order to reduce the amount of supplies being used. One night, on Kathryn's orders, Milja steals the two last shells from the Survivalist's shotgun. The next morning, before their plan can be put into action, Milja is abducted by a drifter while bathing in the stream. After the Survivalist is alerted by an out-of-place footprint in the mud outside the cabin, he takes off into the woods after Milja and her assailant. After tracking them down, the Survivalist tries to load his shotgun but realises that his shells are missing. As a result, the assailant is able to shoot the Survivalist in the stomach. The assailant approaches the wounded Survivalist, first intending to shoot him again in order to kill him, but pulls out his knife instead, presumably to save the bullet. The Survivalist stops the drifter\u2019s knife and pulls out his own knife at the last second and slits the assailant's throat. Back at the cabin, Milja and Kathryn treat the Survivalist's wound, prying the bullet out and cauterising the wound. When the wound becomes infected, Kathryn wants to let him die, but Milja convinces Kathryn to help nurse him back to health.\nOne night, after the Survivalist has returned to full health, a band of raiders arrive at the cabin. The Survivalist gathers Milja and Kathryn, and informs them that he counted six raiders. Armed with only a shotgun with two shells and a pistol with one bullet salvaged from Milja's abductor, they decide that they are outnumbered and cannot fight back. They have no choice but to keep quiet while the raiders attempt, but fail, to break into the cabin. The following morning, the Survivalist, Kathryn and Milja emerge from the cabin to discover that their farm has been ransacked and all of their crops have been stolen. In the following days, they work to save the farm, but they begin to slowly starve. Meanwhile, Milja discovers she is pregnant and attempts to perform an abortion on herself with a length of wire, but stops at the last moment. Kathryn again floats the idea of killing the Survivalist, explaining that there is only enough food for two people. Milja agrees that there is only enough food for two people, and suggests poisoning the Survivalist. That night, Milja makes a meal with poison mushrooms.\nThe following morning, Kathryn tells the Survivalist that she and Milja are leaving. Milja tells her she wants to stay; Kathryn immediately goes to the sink and vomits, realising that Milja has poisoned her instead of poisoning the Survivalist.

On the way back from burying Kathryn, the Survivalist finds two rabbits caught in some of his traps, which would have been enough food for three people had Kathryn survived. The Survivalist returns to the cabin, and tells Milja about his brother while preparing the rabbits to eat. He tells her that they used to steal supplies from camps by going in and out undetected. During one run, his brother saw a girl and couldn't help himself.  While attempting to rape her, she screamed and a chase ensued. Realising that there was no way that both of them would escape alive, the Survivalist cut his brother's Achilles tendon and left him to die. The Survivalist tells her that he did what he had to do to survive; in telling her this, he reassures her that she did the right thing in poisoning Kathryn.

She also struggles in her personal life to make emotional connections with others.  At a crime scene, she meets Nick Hopewell, the new partner of Detective Ed Braxton.  Braxton does not get along with Sher, as his reputation was damaged after she helped solve a crime he could not.  When her latest assistant quits after seeing the crime scene, Hopewell chats with her, and Sher impresses him with her insights into the murder.  Sher later visits the police station to give Braxton a clue she found at the crime scene while cleaning.  Upset that she seems to be trying to upstage him, Braxton ignores her.\nAfter a one-night stand with a data entry worker, Sher encounters Hopewell again, who has become anxious to impress his captain and wants to know about the evidence she found.  After Sher hands him the tip of a cane, Hopewell requests her assistance in examining a seemingly related case, angering Braxton.  After a brief confrontation, Hopewell takes Braxton up on his ultimatum and partners with Sher instead, convincing her to take a role as a police consultant.  In return, she demands Hopewell help her clean up crime scenes.  As they grow closer, Hopewell flirts with her, only to be rebuffed by Sher, who says she has a policy against dating cops and coworkers.\nFollowing clues left at the crime scenes, Hopewell realizes the cane may be connected in some way to Jean-Baptiste Lully, a French composer who died from gangrene after stabbing himself in the foot with a conducting staff.  The killer left behind a compact disc containing Lully's \"Marche pour la C\u00e8r\u00e8monie des Turcs.\"  Hopewell researches the local orchestra and finds a donor who was accused of attempted rape, Gary Butler.  Butler, when questioned, is nervous and denies the rape accusation, which he says was an extortion attempt.  When Hopewell pushes him, Butler panics and leads them to Adam Fowler, a conductor.  Hopewell reasons that a serial killer has targeted people with a criminal record who are connected to the orchestra.  Butler and Fowler, though spooked, refuse to cooperate; Sher and Hopewell agree they are holding back information.\nAfter cooking dinner for her, Hopewell convinces Sher to enter into a relationship, and she admits that personal issues in her life led her to have difficulty in starting healthy relationships.  After they have sex, Sher sneaks out of Hopewell's house with his badge and return to Butler's house.  Impersonating a police officer, she gains entry and flatly tells him she intends to kill him, revealing that she is a former rape victim kidnapped by Fowler, Butler, and the other dead men.  Before she kills him, Butler reluctantly assists her in arranging his own murder scene.\nWhen Butler is found dead, Captain LaSalle angrily takes Hopewell off the case when she learns Hopewell suspected Butler may be the next victim.  Knowing his job on the line, Hopewell again turns to Sher for help.  After promising to help him, she murders Fowler and makes it look like a suicide, arranging the scene to give Hopewell enough evidence to close the case with Fowler revealed as the killer.  Hopewell's job is saved, and Sher becomes hopeful that she can now move beyond the trauma of her rape and have a healthy relationship with Hopewell.\nHer hopes are dashed when Butler's estranged wife reveals that she set up a hidden camera in their house to gather evidence of Butler's infidelity.  The footage reveals a woman killed him, and Hopewell becomes suspicious of the case's too-perfect closure.  As he zeroes in on Sher as a suspect, Hopewell, who previously cooperated with Internal Affairs to take down dirty cops in his precinct, struggles with his rigid morality.

The machine operates by creating one half of a wormhole during one run, the other half during a second run. The process is expensive and dangerous. To activate the process requires radioactive material created by KMC \u2014 a company owned by Klaus Meisner, a venture capitalist.\nIf the material is mishandled as part of the process, the machine will malfunction \u2014 creating a devastating explosion. During the first test, Beale receives a genetically-created Dahlia flower from the wormhole. Beale cannot prove his invention actually works without Meisner's radioactive material for a second test. Meisner demands 50% ownership of the process in exchange for the material, but he gets 49%. The second test is scheduled for one week after the first.\nSoon after the first test, Beale meets Abby Ross, who seems to know too much about him for their meeting to be coincidental. He is attracted to her, but also suspicious. His suspicions are apparently confirmed when Chuck calls him on his cell phone and tells Beale that Abby is not to be trusted and that the test was much more successful than they initially thought. Beale leaves Abby and rushes back to the lab, but Chuck refuses to explain further. Beale later ignores his suspicions and starts a relationship with Abby. They discover a deep bond, which is broken when Chuck's warning is confirmed: Abby tells Meisner about the flower. Meisner threatens Beale with knowledge of the flower \u2014 the intellectual property of another of his companies. Meisner extorts Beale for another 50% ownership of Beale's research, leaving Beale with 1%.\nDuring the second test, heartbroken and not thinking clearly, Beale makes a mad dash through the machine into the wormhole, with these parting words: \u201cYou may own the Dahlia, but you don\u2019t own me.\u201d In an attempt to avoid losing ownership of his company, Beale had reasoned that he needed to send something through the wormhole \u2014 namely, himself \u2014 that did not belong to Meisner from an intellectual-property standpoint. He is thus transported one week into the past to the time of the first test.\nBeale is convinced that on this \"second run\", he can outwit Meisner and Abby and prevent his research from falling into their hands. He seduces Abby but soon learns that she was honestly attracted to him: A science writer herself, she had read an article about him and crafted a fanciful story in a journal about what he must be like. Having learned more about him from Meisner and researching his work, she is powerfully attracted to him. Beale reads the fictional story but finds that it is a somewhat inaccurate representation of his work and is also unfinished.\nComplications arise: The \"second run\" Beale becomes physically weakened, and experiences pain when in close proximity to \"Jim Prime\", the version of Beale who existed before the jump into the wormhole. Beale reveals himself to Chuck and Matty in the hopes of securing their help to protect the research. They both assist Beale and conceal his presence from Jim Prime, explaining several confusing interactions during the week before the second test. Beale is jealous of Jim Prime, but there is no need: Jim Prime is still suspicious of Abby, and it is clear that he will have nothing to do with her after the second test because of her betrayal.\nBeale continues to weaken. He encounters Abby's journal again (this time in Matty's hands) and is confused; in the first timeline, it was at Abby's apartment. Matty says he found it in Jim's coat pocket when he came out of the wormhole. The journal is now subtly different, which confirms that Beale has jumped not back in time, but into the past of a parallel universe, slightly different from the one he left. Subtle inconsistencies Beale had not noticed in this timeline are explained. Chuck says that it is impossible for two Beales to exist in the same universe, so the \"second run\" Beale will die, and only Jim Prime will remain.\nBeale enlists the help of Chuck and Matty in making an unscheduled wormhole to send himself into the past with his new knowledge, to try and prevent the research from being stolen. A mistake is made in the process, preventing the time jump and wasting the radioactive material.\nThe date of the second test arrives. Beale finds another time-displaced Jim dead in a hotel after trying to leave the city. He returns to the Grand Hotel, where he sees Abby's apparent act of betrayal was done purposefully to get more radioactive material to make the second test happen, to send Jim Prime away, and to save Beale's life.

Upon their encounter, the old storyteller criticizes Ved's irrationality and confronts him to complete his own story. This opens Ved's eyes and he goes back to his house where he starts narrating events that happened in their family, using theatrics and metaphors in the form of storytelling to the family audience. Moved by his art of storytelling\n, Brijmohan forgives him for leaving his job and lets him pursue his life as he wishes.\nVed returns to Delhi and accepts the ring being kindly returned to him by the hijra.

The king summons Sado and tells him to kill himself.  Fearing for their own lives, Sado's supporters rush in and save him from suicide.  Instead the king orders Sado into a large rice box, which he then nails shut since no one else will do it for him.\nThe movie proceeds to flip back and forth chronologically between the rice box in the courtyard and the history of how it got there.\nThe king is presented as a doting father very concerned with the educational attainments of his young son.

His friend in cybersecurity, Erik, alerts him that the CIA has tracked him down and though he manages to briefly elude them, he is captured.  Upon meeting with him, Agents Holden (a former mentor of Drew) and Connelly offer him a deal: spend 30 years to life in prison or work for them to catch an even greater threat. An unidentified hacker has somehow managed to tap into Chicago's power grid using a volatile program known as \"Pantheon\" and shut it down completely thanks to a special encryption key that allows him access to the entire Internet and World Wide Web and beyond. If this device gets into the wrong hands, the entire world will be at the mercy of any number of terrorists, most likely the highest bidder.

As the mission progresses the team are able to learn that the hacker in question is Teebs, a young anarchist who intends to sell the key on the black market to the highest bidder, who ends up being a pro-Soviet Russian defector named Olag Konstantin. It is also revealed that Drew faked the algorithm process by which he chose his team; he simply read their files and selected them based on their shoddy records hoping that the mission would end in failure.  With his immunity deal having already been signed, Drew could then go back to working alone.

Shortly afterward, Teebs reactivates Pantheon at Konstantin's order, causing Bulgaria to experience total blackout. Thanks to Erik's help, Drew is able to locate Teebs and after an apology followed by a rousing pep talk, he and Holden are able to convince their former team members to return and finish the mission.\nOnce the team is back together, they sneak into Konstantin's headquarters. Drew finds Teebs and tries to convince him to hand over the key. Teebs attacks him instead, but drops the key when Drew shoots him, destroying it and forcing Drew to bypass the hardwired encryption in order to restore Bulgaria's power and prevent a lethal gas valve failure.

Frank is approached by a young girl, Athena, who hands him an orange lapel pin with a blue \"T\" embossed on it, telling him to follow her onto Walt Disney's \"It's a Small World\" attraction at the Fair's Pepsi-Cola Pavilion. Frank obeys and sneaks onto the ride, where the pin is scanned by a laser, and he is transported to Tomorrowland, a futuristic cityscape, where advanced robots fix his jetpack, allowing him to fly and join the secretive world.\nIn the present day, optimistic teenager Casey Newton repeatedly sabotages the planned demolition of a NASA launch site in Florida. Her father, Eddie, is a NASA engineer, but faces losing his job. Casey is eventually caught and arrested. At the police station, she finds a pin in her belongings. While touching it, the pin transports her to Tomorrowland. Her adventure is cut short when the pin's battery runs out.\nWith help from her younger brother Nate, Casey finds a Houston memorabilia store related to the pin. The owners attack her when she is unable to divulge where she got the pin, insisting that Casey knows about a \"little girl\".

After Casey and Athena steal a car, Athena reveals she is an animatronic, purposed to find and recruit people who fit the ideals of Tomorrowland. Athena drops Casey off outside an adult Frank's house in Pittsfield, New York.\nThe reclusive, cynical Frank declines Casey's request to take her to Tomorrowland, having been banished from it years ago. Inside Frank's house, Casey finds a probability counter marking the end of the world. Frank warns her that the future is doomed, but she disagrees, thus lowering the counter's probability. Animatronic assassins arrive to kill Casey, but she and Frank escape, meeting Athena in the woods outside Frank's house. Frank resents Athena for lying to him about her true nature, but reluctantly agrees to help them get to Tomorrowland.\nUsing a teleportation device, the trio travel to the top of the Eiffel Tower. Frank explains that Gustave Eiffel, Jules Verne, Nikola Tesla, and Thomas Edison co-founded Plus Ultra, a secret society of futurists, creating Tomorrowland in another dimension, free to make scientific breakthroughs without obstruction, eventually inducting Walt Disney into the society based on his philosophy of \"making dreams come true\" through imagination and filmmaking aligning with their own principles, thus one of the first transports to Tommorowland was built beneath Disneyland's park attraction of the same name. The trio use an antique rocket, called the Spectacle, hidden beneath the Eiffel Tower to travel to Tomorrowland.\nThere, they find Tomorrowland in a state of decay. David Nix, Tomorrowland's governor, greets them. They travel to a tachyon machine, invented by Frank, which accurately predicted the worldwide catastrophe. Casey refuses to accept the world will end, causing the future to temporarily alter. While Frank attempts to convince David to listen, he refuses and intends to have the group leave Tomorrowland.\nCasey realizes the tachyon machine is telling humanity that the world will end, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. They confront David, who admits he tried to prevent the future by projecting such images to humanity as a warning. Instead, they embraced the apocalypse, refusing to act to make a better future for their world. Believing that humanity simply gave up, David has also given up and intends to allow the apocalypse to happen.

The five segments are described here in the order they appear in the film:\nA young girl, Dorothy Mahler, is hiking on a nature trail near to downtown Los Angeles when two dimwitted street  dealers, Jesse and Mathew, turn up by chance. She borrows the phone of one and calls Mel Samson, a private investigator, whom she had met earlier, saying she needs his help because some bad guys in the city are angry with her. While waiting for Samson to arrive, Dorothy takes ecstasy given to her by the dealers, who have to go but promise to come back for her later. Dorothy begins talking to a seemingly friendly park ranger (Skippy Fontaine). Dorothy and Fontaine chat until we see that there is a dead body nearby. Suddenly Fontaine attacks Dorothy and strangles her. The returning Jesse and Matthew come across her body and believe that she overdosed on the drugs they gave her, and they run away in fear. Samson arrives, too late, to find Dorothy dead.\nIn the second segment, Samson arrives at the home of sleazy strip club owner Gordy, saying he's been in a car accident and needs to use their phone. He speaks with Gordy's much-younger, neglected wife, Janet, and has a drink. When Samson eventually comes face to face with Gordy and Roger Fontaine, Skippy's father, he reveals his real identity and tells them the motivation for Dorothy's murder: Dorothy had photographs of Gordy receiving oral sex from another stripper, and Gordy arranged Dorothy's murder to keep Janet from finding out. Janet is incensed by Samson's story of her husband's infidelity and retrieves a gun. Provoked by Samson, she shoots Gordy and Roger dead, before (despite Samson's protests) turning the gun on herself. Samson remarks to himself that he needs to get his life together.\nThe third segment shows what would have been first chronologically. Samson sits in a strip club and is offered a lap dance from a performer named Jill, which he declines. He meets Dorothy and asks her to get a drink with him but she diverts him and leaves without him noticing. Samson goes to a neighbouring club where a friend's band is performing live music. He finds Dorothy waiting for him and she joins him in a photo booth. He plays guitar and performs a song.\nThe fourth segment shows what would have been last chronologically. Jill is working at a drive-in movie theater, where she's approached by Samson, who has a non-deadly bullet wound in his chest. They discuss their year-long romantic relationship, which ended some time earlier. Samson reveals that he's come to the theater to confront one of its patrons, Skippy Fontaine. He gets into Fontaine's car and points a gun at him but Fontaine manages to stab him in the abdomen with a broken bottle and escape. Jill joins Samson in the car and holds him as he dies. He shows her the \u201cJilly Bean\u201d tattoo he got in her honour.\nIn the final segment, Samson goes to see Dorothy's grandmother and mother about taking her case, but he insists on doing it at no cost, out of loyalty to Dorothy. Speaking privately to Dorothy's mother, Mary, Samson reminds her through an allegory that they had had a relationship many years earlier, revealing that Samson is Dorothy's father and had watched her grow up from a distance her whole life. Walking to his car, Samson is attacked and shot in the chest by Jesse and Matthew, who believe Dorothy died from the drugs they gave her and don't want to be implicated in Samson's investigation.

They refuse to directly answer questions, confident that a liberal majority on the Supreme Court will overturn their convictions for contempt of Congress. Trumbo's friend Edward G. Robinson, who supports the cause, sells Vincent van Gogh's 1887 painting Portrait of P\u00e8re Tanguy to raise money for their legal defense fund.

Without any prevarication, Antoine immediately asks if Alice forgives him and she says no. He leaves without Alice accompanying him.

Furthermore, he is recently diagnosed with advanced stage brain cancer and has only a few more months to live, a fact which is unknown to his own family. He is treated by his family doctor Dr. Arpana, with whom he has an extramarital affair.\nAfter these revelations come to him in a flood, Manoranjan decides to withdraw from a film produced by Poornachandra Rao and instead act in a film produced by himself and directed by Margadarsi, who was his mentor. The two directors had fallen out when Manoranjan married Varalakshmi and started acting in films directed and produced by Poornachandra Rao, who is Margadarsi's rival. Despite the personal differences between the directors, Manoranjan wishes for Margadarsi to be the director of his last film before he dies. Margadarsi initially refuses to direct Manoranjan, but when he hears from Arpana about Manoranjan's terminal illness, he is visibly moved and accepts to direct Manoranjan. When Poornachandra Rao and Varalakshmi find out about Manoranjan's plan, they become enraged and leave his house along with Manohar. Undaunted, Manoranjan proceeds with his film.\nManoranjan's film with Margadarsi is titled Uttama Villain. It is a fantasy comedy film which tells the story of a street artist named Uttaman, who has dodged death several times and is hence believed to be immortal. With the help of a princess named Karpagavalli, he works to defeat the evil king Muttharasan, who is obsessed about gaining Karpagavalli and the whole Theeyam empire.

Varalakshmi, on the other hand, suffers a heart attack on hearing the news, though she soon recovers. She apologises to Manoranjan for her actions to forcibly separate him from Yamini, so that she could marry him. Later, Manoranjan finds out that a letter he had written to Yamini shortly after they had separated, had not been delivered to her. When Manonmani reads this letter, which tells about Manoranjan's support for Yamini's decision to not undergo an abortion despite being pregnant out of wedlock, her hatred towards her biological father turns to love and she finally accepts him as her father.\nAfter completing the shooting of Uttama Villain, Manoranjan becomes very sick, suffering from delirium as well as slurred speech and movement, and faints.

The gloating from his friends Jack and Nancy Peterson about a family trip they had in Paris, \u00cele-de-France in France doesn't help his situation.\nHe desires to relive the fun of his family vacations and holiday gatherings from his childhood. These memories prompt him to abandon his family's annual trip to their cabin in Cheboygan, Michigan (which the rest of the family secretly hated), and instead drive cross country from Chicago to Walley World, just like he did with his parents and sister. For the trip, Rusty rents a Tartan Prancer, an ugly, over-complicated Albanian SUV.\nAlong the way, the Griswolds take many detours. The first stop is in Memphis, Tennessee, where it's revealed that the otherwise mild-mannered Debbie was an extremely promiscuous Tri Pi sorority sister in college nicknamed 'Debbie Do Anything'. To prove that she was the rebellious student, Debbie attempts to run an obstacle course while drunk, but fails miserably.

They return to their SUV, only to see that it's been broken into and sprayed with graffiti, as well as finding their luggage and cash stolen.\nThey stop in Plano, Texas, to get help from Rusty's sister Audrey and her attractive husband Stone Crandall. Rusty begins to suspect problems in his relationship with Debbie due to her seeming acceptance of Stone's obviously outward sexual advances, but she rebuffs his suspicions; Stone then walks in on the couple and makes a show of his muscular body and oversized genitalia.\nSpending the following night at a Wigwam Motel in Holbrook, Arizona, Rusty and Debbie sneak away and attempt to have sex at the Four Corners Monument, where officers from all four states of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico confront the couple.

Unfortunately, they have been tracked down by a seemingly unstable truck driver, who they think has been stalking them throughout the trip. In actuality, the trucker has been instead trying to return Debbie's missing wedding ring. He ends up giving them a lift to San Francisco, California.\nThere, they spend the night at a bed and breakfast run by Rusty's parents, Clark and Ellen. They intend to fly home the next day, but Rusty and Debbie confront each other about their stale marriage and decide to start over again.

The lives of the four labourers take a turn for worse when they are caught, beaten and tortured brutally in police lock-up for a theft that they did not commit, due to police's need to close a high-profile robbery case. The four resist the torture and refuse to confess but are forced to relent due to the police brutality. However, when produced in court, they speak out the true set of events to the judge.

Despite his background and friends, James sees potential in Cole and takes him as his student. After listening to Cole's original song, James criticizes Cole for imitating other well-known producers, and he suggests using organic sounds for an original vibe. They write a song using the original vibe technique and vocals from Sophie, which is well received at a local nightclub. Next, Cole and his friends head to Las Vegas for a music festival, where he meets up with Sophie, whom James ditched. Sophie gives Cole MDMA, and they sleep together, spending the night at a hotel.\nBack in San Fernando, James invites Cole over to watch an MMA fight with him and Sophie. An awkward moment ends up with Sophie telling Cole to accept what happened and leave it alone, and James gives Cole a new MacBook Pro and the opportunity to open for him at a popular music festival. One day, Cole and Paige (Jon Bernthal) meet up with Tanya Romero (Alicia Coppola), whose house is being foreclosed. During the negotiation, Paige buys her house and rents it back to her, intending to sell it quickly for a substantial price, which angers Cole.

After the funeral, the remaining friends begin to question their future, and go their separate ways after Mason blames Ollie for the drugs that killed Squirrel. Cole visits James, whose alcoholism has completely consumed him, to let him know of Squirrel's death and that it could possibly have been his fault. James consoles him and also tells him that Sophie moved to the San Fernando Valley and works at a local coffee shop, where he later visits her.\nWhile taking a run, the battery of Cole's phone goes dead, causing his music to stop playing.

Cole releases his track, which contains snippets of his conversations with Sophie and Squirrel, and he later uses Squirrel's quote \"Are We Ever Going To Be Better Than This?\" as a hook before the beat drop. When the song ends, Cole is met with enthusiastic acclaim from the audience and James. The film concludes with Sophie going back to college, Ollie reading for an audition, Mason handling the nightclub, and Cole remaining positive about his future and creating a proper relationship with Sophie.\nIn the mid-credits scene, Tanya opens her front door to an Adidas box that Cole has been saving all of his earnings in throughout the film.", "tmdb_id": 301351}, "49110028": {"title": "We Can't Live Without Cosmos", "plot": "Two lifelong friends \u2013 designated by the numbers 1203 and 1204 \u2013 grow up with the shared dream of becoming cosmonauts.

Randol Schoenberg (the son of her close friend, Barbara), a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the art restitution board in Austria. Reluctantly returning to her homeland, Altmann discovers that the country's minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. Altmann is told that the painting was legitimately bequeathed to the gallery by her aunt. Upon further investigation by her lawyer and Austrian journalist Hubertus Czernin, this claim proves to be wrong as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting, the artist's fee having been paid by Altmann's uncle. Adele Bloch-Bauer wanted the painting to go to the museum at her husband's death but it was taken from him by the Nazis and placed in the museum by a Nazi-collaborating curator, well before his death. Schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board, but it is denied and Altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. Defeated, she and Schoenberg return to the United States.\nMonths later, happening upon an art book with \"Woman in Gold\" on the cover, Schoenberg has an epiphany. Using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retroactively  applied, Schoenberg files a claim in US court against the Austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. An appeal goes to the Supreme Court of the United States, where in the matter of Republic of Austria v. Altmann, the court rules in Altmann's favor, which results in the Austrian government attempting to persuade Altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. After a falling out over the issue of returning to Austria for a second time to argue the case, Altmann agrees for Schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of a panel of three arbiters in Vienna.\nIn Austria, the panel hears the case, during which Schoenberg reminds them of the Nazi regime's crimes. He implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word \"restitution\" and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the Nazis. Unexpectedly, Altmann arrives during the session, indicating to Czernin that she came to support her lawyer. After considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of Altmann, returning her paintings.

The retelling ends with Triple H's ascension to COO of the WWE following his marriage to Stephanie McMahon; Landis suggests that Triple H sought power behind the scenes of the company because he could never achieve the glory that he truly desired in the ring.", "imdb_id": "tt4532032"}, "46416144": {"title": "Wrong No.", "plot": "The story revolves around Sallu (Danish Taimoor) who hopes to make it big in showbiz someday.

Loomis bathes in contaminated water, and immediately sickens, but is nursed back to health by Ann, who welcomes him into her farmhouse.\nLoomis regains his strength, and gradually, becomes part of Ann's humble rustic life.  He helps Ann pump diesel from local petroleum pumps and gets the farm's long-disused tractor running to expand her gardens for the winter.  Ann tells Loomis about her parents and younger brother who left the valley to find other survivors... but never returned.  Loomis speculates hydro-electricity might be generated from the nearby waterfall, using a water-wheel fashioned from the Burden church's planks and beams.  Ann is uncomfortable with this proposal, citing her father's involvement as preacher and her deeply-held Christian beliefs.  Loomis chooses to not pursue the project further.\nAnn and Loomis grow closer, cultivating crops and preparing for long-term habitation.  Their domestic accord is marred by occasional tensions, notably involving matters of religion and Loomis' drinking.  The two come to the verge of initiating a sexual relationship, but Loomis demurs, claiming a sexual relationship will change them, and he needs more time.\nMysterious phenomena (including stolen food supplies and a half-glimpsed shadowy figure) culminate in the arrival of a third survivor, Caleb.  Although Ann welcomes Caleb into the farmhouse, Loomis resents Caleb, stating \"whites belong with whites\".  Loomis questions Caleb's backstory and motives;  Caleb repeatedly emphasizes the religious connection he shares with Ann (in stark contrast to Loomis).\nThe three survivors slowly settle into a marginally-stable partnership.  Both men relate post-apocalyptic horrors they witnessed before reaching the valley;  Loomis describes a radiation-sickened child begging him for death; later, he privately confides to Ann his belief the dying boy was her long-absent brother; Loomis confesses to the murder of the child.  Caleb pressures Ann to go forward with the water-wheel project, and work commences on tearing down her father's church for materials.  Perceiving their mutual attraction, Loomis awkwardly gives Ann consent to pursue a romantic relationship with Caleb, but belies his grief and anger in losing Ann through his remarks. Shortly thereafter, following a celebratory dinner, a heavily intoxicated Loomis tells Ann he loves her before passing out in a bedroom in Ann's home.

He assumes control over the city of Hu, getting the locals to worship his every word.  It is later revealed that not every demon in Hell is deserving of their fate nor their status, and that the lesser ones want redemption for themselves rather than harm to humanity, but must play along to avoid Diaoxian's zealot demon-slayers.  Zhong Kui, a local scholar, is manipulated by Diaoxian into becoming his most powerful experiment yet: a pseudo-demon capable of more effectively slaying demons with.  Diaoxian wins the trust of Hu's residents in order to deceive them and the other gods into not noticing his real plans for wishing to steal away from Hell one of its most prized treasures: the Dark Crystal.  With it, he seeks to overthrow the pantheon of gods and rewrite all reality - even if he has to eradicate Hell and erase the souls of all the innocent in Hu to make that possible.\nThe current resident \"Demon King\" in the realm of Hell nearest to the city of Hu is revealed to have once been one of Diaoxian's pawns, much like Kui is presently.  After Diaoxian's betrayal led to the Demon King and his followers being turned into demons and sent to Hell as Diaoxian sought to hide his crimes from the other gods; the Demon King sought to take advantage of a date when the realms were close by and reincarnations occurred as his big chance to win redemption for his clan by using the Dark Crystal to expose Diaoxian.\nThree years prior, a snow demon named \"Little Snow,\" stumbled upon a younger Kui in an effort to seduce him, but was soon smitten with him herself and lost some of her zeal for revenge.  However, she was heartbroken when Kui said that humans and demons do not belong together, and left him to return to Hell. Subsequent to her departure, Kui took part in the imperial exams and obtained the highest honours. However, this was stripped away from him due to bribery and he committed suicide due to the injustice. Daoxian brought Kui back to life and him gave a magic elixir to make him believe he was still fully human and alive, rather than a human-demon hybrid per an unholy resurrection.\nThree years later, Kui tries to master his new power of a \"pseudo-demon\" form.  He also steals the Dark Crystal from Hell on Daoxian's command.  The Demon King recruits his subjects - along with some actual demons - to wage assault on the city of Hu and take the Dark Crystal back, fearing that Diaoxian's true evil plan will finally come to pass otherwise.  When the initial waves of actual demons prove too weak and animalistic and fall too easily to the demon slayers, the Demon King revives Snow Girl to assist his subjects in retrieving the Dark Crystal.\nThe Demon Sisters travel to Hu disguised as traveling dancers, to bemuse the town into drunken revelry and lust so they will be too distracted to help Diaoxian guard the crystal properly.  However, a suspicious Kui feigns being drunk in order to get closer to the girls, in a quest to get them to betray their demon forms.  When his initial efforts to expose them fail, he discovers Snow separated from the others.  The two of them reignite their love affair, as she attempts to explain to him the truth of what's happening.  Their lovemaking session is interrupted after the other girls grow impatient and try to steal the crystal without her, causing a mystical fox guardian to attack them.  Kui hears the commotion and leaves to investigate.  Snow arrives on the scene afterward to help her sisters out, and comes across Kui in his demon form, the two of them confused to find themselves fighting on opposite sides.  They trade blows, but Diaoxian arrives and the demon girls are defeated.  Snow tries to escape and feign innocence, but Kui isn't fooled.  Realizing she went out of her way not to hurt anyone except in self-defense, Kui gives in to both his love for Snow and to her pleading for mercy, and decides he can't bring himself to kill her.  Instead, he has her hide with his siblings.\nDiaoxian fears the girls might betray the truth to the residents of Hu, so he stirs up hatred against them and tries to orchestrate a public execution to send them back to Hell, in a weakened state where it could take centuries before they are strong enough to return to Earth.  Snow hears her sisters being publicly tortured, so she heads out in public to rescue them.  By herself, she proves no match for Diaoxian, who quickly defeats her and exposes her in public.  Diaoxian demands that Kui execute Snow publicly for the crime of humiliating him with icicles.  However, Kui refuses to kill her, instead pleading for her life.  Diaoxian responds by stabbing Kui with a blade.  More of the Demon King's forces advance in an effort to rescue Snow and Kui, with Kui's demon form able to understand the intentions of the demon girls and his loyalties shifting following his disillusionment with Diaoxian's cruel and merciless demeanor. He allows the Demon King to return to Hell and draws Daoxian's ire. She and her sisters meet up with Kui later, healing his condition with some stolen elixir.  Kui agrees to go to Hell with them and meet up with the Demon King to learn the truth.\nKui then goes to confront Diaoxian, learning even more the true nature of his former master.  He threatens to expose Diaoxian's evil plan to the townsfolk, but learns the hard way that Diaoxian's deceptions have the town completely under his spell.  The townsfolk turn against Kui, beating him until he becomes enraged and his demon form manifests.  Even then, he refuses to attack his countrymen - except as a last resort in self-defense.  A bitter, wounded, betrayed Kui flees to the outskirts of the realms in an effort to make sense of his broken reality, with Snow chasing after him to comfort him and remind him of their love.\nThe two of them decide to stage a final assault on Diaoxian in order to separate him from the Dark Crystal, so that the balance of reality can be restored and the residents of Hu saved from being the fuel to Diaoxian's reality-warping engine.  The city's royal guard interferes, slowing Kui down as he's forced to fight his former demon-slayer comrades and overcome them.  Snow tackles Diaoxian by herself, openly chastising him for his never-ending treachery.  However, the fight goes poorly for her.  He is able to imprison her in a crystalline structure suspended in the air, significantly weakening her life force so that she'll need to reincarnate in Hell before gaining another chance at redemption centuries later, possibly dooming her to go through numerous reincarnations as a pseudo-demon before transcending to human - or godhood.\nKui catches up and notices Snow's predicament.  He seems stunned and helpless at first, but flies into a rage when Diaoxian mocks the lovers' commitment to each other.  Diaoxian soon discovers that he exhausted much of his own energy supply trying to imprison Snow Girl, then exhausts what's left trying to create an energy pyramid to shield himself from an enraged Zhong Kui in full demon form.  Kui, finally fed up, uses his hidden sword to shatter the compromised shield, leaving a weakened Diaoxian exposed and vulnerable.  Kui slices Diaoxian into four pieces, seemingly killing him.  This causes the crystal imprisoning Snow to disintegrate, sending her falling to the ground.  Kui catches her, but she is too weak.  Dying and in pain, she retreats in spirit form to Hell to recuperate.  However, the July 15th special event is nearly at an end.  If Kui doesn't save her from Hell in time, it could be thousands of years before her next reincarnation can hope to escape demon life.  Kui restores the chi spirits of the townsfolk stolen by Diaoxian with the Dark Crystal's help, and the disillusioned townsfolk realize that Kui was right to rebel against Diaoxian.\nAs Kui replaces the Dark Crystal in its rightful place, the Jade Emperor appears and beckons Kui to reincarnate as the Heavens still need him.

His father used to recite Shabad Kirtan in Gurudwaras, but after his death, Dilsher has developed a fear of music. He instead grows up with a speech impairment and stammers. He comes to Delhi to meet a businessman, Gurcharan \"Guru\" Sikand (Manish Choudhary), who is often referred to as the Lion of Gurdaspur.\nA flashback speaks of how, while being bullied by some of his schoolmates, Dilsher met a young Gurcharan who told him about how life often becomes cruel to people, and how one should fight back. He even gives Dilsher a pen, which is symbolic of Gurcharan's own struggles, and his audacity to write his own destiny. Dilsher is encouraged to write his own destiny in Delhi.\nDilsher befriends Tulsi Ram, the leader of a workforce employed in one of Gurcharan's projects, and learns more about Gurcharan from Tulsi Ram. Thereafter, he joins a security agency in hopes of getting to Kapoor Sikand Industries Limited, better known as KSIL, which is owned by Gurcharan. However, he lands a job at a music show, and notices a young girl, Amira (Sarah Jane Dias) dancing to a song.\nA bouncer, Yadav, is assigned duty at KSIL for the next day. Dilsher begs Yadav to swap positions with him, but Yadav mocks Dilsher for being too enthusiastic, verily questioning his own sensibilities. As a last straw, Dilsher injures Yadav and announces himself as a substitute. While trying to settle an agreement between Tulsi Ram's workforce and Gurcharan's son Surya Sikand (Raaghav Chanana), he eventually manages to meet Gurcharan, and reminds him of the pen he gave him. Surprised that a stranger would have known him better than his family, Gurcharan is rendered nostalgic, and begins playing a CD of the songs he used to hear in Gurdaspur days.\nTulsi Ram is given a hefty sum to help with his sons' studies. The sum is delivered via Dilsher, who uncannily and sinisterly puts a hidden sum in the same red bag. Sometime later, Dilsher shifts to the construction site where Tulsi Ram works. Surya is angry but much to his shock, Gurcharan orders his assistant Ajmani to arrange a room beside on his own estate for Dilsher.\nSurya takes Dilsher to a party, where he meets Amira. She happens to be Surya's friend, but when Surya tries to mock Dilsher, Amira rebukes him. Amira later mentions an event named Dhruvtara, which Surya wants to attend, but Amira refuses, citing that Dhruvtara is only for people who have been close friends to her and Dhruv. Just as he is leaving, Dilsher is attacked by a few thugs sent by Surya who threaten Dilsher, asking him to leave the estate.\nDilsher visits Amira in the meantime, bringing some bananas for her, and learns that she is preparing for Dhruvtara. Both of them get high on alcohol, and the next morning, Amira discovers Dilsher singing. She falls asleep, and wakes up soon, only to end up stopping Dilsher, who however admits that he is not interested in singing. Amira then reveals that he does not stammer while singing, which soon compels Dilsher to recall his childhood with his father.\nSeeing how much Dilsher knows about him, Gurcharan bonds quickly with him, giving him a higher preference over Surya, much to the chagrin of Surya's mother Mandira \"Mandy\" Sikand (Meghna Malik). Mandy orders Gurcharan to fire Dilsher because Surya doesn't like him, but it falls on deaf ears. Dilsher still remains loyal to Gurcharan. That night, after an argument between Mandy and Gurcharan, Dilsher is brutally attacked by some goons who seem to have been sent by Surya. However, this time, Dilsher challenges Surya, vowing that he will become a big man, and that Surya is nothing like his father. A broken Surya then ceases communication with Gurcharan, who is already angry with him for having sent the goons.\nDilsher meets Amira again, this time on his own. He learns that Dhruv was Amira's brother, who for a reason did not like Surya, but was very reactive and aggressive when drunk. During a party, he accidentally fell into a swimming pool and died. After a few days, Gurcharan hosts a party where the Les Twins are to perform. Dilsher tries to apologize to Surya, but leaves him alone in a weak moment. Meanwhile, Gurcharan is furious when he notices Mehta at the party, trying to meet with Mandy, who but warns Gurcharan against creating a scene, and he leaves in disgust.\nDilsher is confronted by Gurcharan and soon reveals that he was the one who injured Yadav to meet him, and Gurcharan, in turn, reveals a number of truths to him: Surya is actually Mandy's son with Mehta, and that Mehta actually belonged earlier to the Kapoor family from KSIL, which is why he doesn't love Surya and Mandy. However, Dilsher is devastated to learn that the goons that day were actually sent by Gurcharan, and not Surya. After a lengthy conversation, Dilsher realizes that KSIL is not the place for him. Instead, he picks up at Amira during her performance with the dancer duo. As the song ends, the two share a kiss.\nRecalling through another flashback how his father developed a speech impairment that led to his banishment from the Gurudwara and ultimately desolation resulting in suicide, Dilsher finally lets go of it all as he realizes the lesson Amira gave him on music and life. He leaves Gurcharan for a new life, thus also incriminating Gurcharan with Surya and Mandy. Although he is arrested and imprisoned upon arrival in Gurdaspur under charges pressed by Gurcharan, he is soon released, and writes a message to Amira, finally reuniting with her in the end.", "tmdb_id": 455272}}
