Initially the monks reject him, since he is an outsider, but the chief abbot has mercy on the young man and lets him stay. One year later, Yude - now known as San Te - begins his martial arts training in the temple's 35 chambers, in each of which the temple's novices are trained in one aspect of the kung fu fighting arts.\nThe chambers shown in San Te's training are as follows (names of the chambers, if given, are from the subtitles and in quotation marks):\n\n\"Top Chamber\": This is considered the highest-level chamber, where the monks are reciting the Buddhist sutras from memory.  When the head master of the chamber tells San Te to leave due to his ignorance of the sutras, San Te protests, only for the head master to knock him down from a distance.  San Te flees the chamber, and agrees to start at the lowest level.\n\"35th Chamber\":  This chamber teaches lightness and balance.  Monks in training must jump on a bundle of sticks floating in a pool of water to reach the dining hall.  Falling in the water requires the monk to dry his clothes off before entering the dining hall (by which time the food is all gone).\nThird Chamber: This chamber trains arm strength.  Monks must carry water in buckets with blades attached to their arms to keep the arms held straight out.  The chamber also serves as the monastery's laundry.\nFourth Chamber: This chamber trains wrist strength.  Monks must strike a gong with a weighted pole to the rhythm of the head master's striking his wooden fish.\nFifth Chamber:  This chamber trains eyesight.  Monks must follow a light without turning their heads, or risk getting burned by large sticks of incense.\nSixth Chamber: This chamber trains head strength.  Monks must headbutt their way through a corridor of sandbags and then place incense sticks on an altar.  This is the last conditioning chamber; after passing this chamber, San Te is allowed to learn kung fu techniques.\nSeventh Chamber:  This is the chamber for training empty-hand forms and techniques.\n\"Leg Chamber\": This chamber trains kicking techniques.\n\"Sword Chamber\":  This chamber trains broadsword techniques.\nNinth Chamber:  This chamber trains staff techniques.San Te advances more rapidly than any previous student, reaching the rank of deputy overseer within the space of six years.

It opens with a quote by Picasso himself: \"Art is a lie that leads us closer to the truth.\"\nThe story starts with Picasso's birth in M\u00e1laga, Spain. His father, Don Jose (Hans Alfredson), is an artist and discovers early his son's talent when the young boy makes a sculpture of Don Jose with his food. \nWhen Pablo is old enough (and now portrayed by G\u00f6sta Ekman) his father takes him to Madrid, so that Pablo can study art. On their way, they encounter two robbers who try to hurt a beautiful girl named Dolores (Lena Olin). After a slapstick number in which Picasso defeats the two attackers, she gives him a bottle of paint, containing a djinn. With the paint from that bottle he signs all his paintings. \nAt the academy of art Pablo's talent is praised and awarded. When he returns home with a portrait of his mother Dona Maria (Margaretha Krook), he is equally praised there. Unfortunately, their happiness is ruined when Don Jose suddenly dies - or so it seems. At the funeral it turns out he's actually still alive. Despite this, Dona Maria keeps ignoring him with the words: \"Idioto, t\u00fa es muerta\" (= \"You are dead, fool\").\nPablo leaves for Paris, but has a hard time selling any of his paintings. One day his father comes to visit him, bringing the sad news that Dona Maria is dead. When Don Jose starts to eat an apple that Pablo used as a reference for his painting, Picasso starts to draw faster, still using the apple as reference.  The result is the birth of cubism.\nThis new style, however, is very hard to sell - until Pablo's father gets an idea from a fishing rod. He lowers the painting down from a window during a vernissage. The overall reaction is negative, with comments like \"Scandal\", \"Merde\", \"Oh, mon dieu\" and \"piss\".\nOne of the guests however, finds the picture both charming and marvelous and declares that she wants to buy it. This lady is none other than the great writer Gertrude Stein (Bernard Cribbins), who is attending the vernissage with her companion Alice B. Toklas (Wilfrid Brambell).\nAfter this, Picasso becomes the center of the artworld of Paris. Along with names like Braque, Matisse, Fernand L\u00e9ger, Pompidou, Entrec\u00f4te, Carl Larsson, Karl-Alfred, Loulou, Dodo, Jou-Jou, Clo-Clo, Margot, Frou Frou, Jenny Nystr\u00f6m, Hejsan-Tjosan, Corselet, Omelette and Rembrandt (most of these names are just nonsense and mean other things than you might suspect). The Paris artworld also included Hemingway, who enjoys knitting, Erik Satie, Guillaume Apollinaire, Henri Rousseau, Vincent van Gogh and no less than two Toulouse-Lautrec. Along with Mimi, a waitress who gave Puccini the inspiration to \"Thy tiny hand is frozen\", the reason for this being that she is carrying a wine cooler.\nAfter this introduction to the artworld of Paris, the narrator tells about a \"normal\" day in Picassos life. It ends with a visit from Mr. and Mrs. Guggenheim from New York City. Although the Swedish American multimillionaire Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim (Birgitta Andersson) doesn't understand Picasso's art, she knows that it is expensive, and therefore immortal. She becomes a pest and at whatever the cost she is determined to become a part of Picasso's art and world. When Picasso no longer seems to be able to escape the annoying American, his two friends Rousseau (Lennart Nyman) and Apollinaire (Per Oscarsson) invite him to Rousseau's hidden forest, where Apollinaire reads aloud some of his poems for his friends. This gives Picasso an idea. They will have a masquerade in Rousseaus honor.\nThis masquerade has a lot of famous historic persons, most of them dressed as furniture. It all ends with Rousseau, while playing his violin, flying out the window and into the night of Paris.\nNow it's 1914 and Picasso and all of humanity is looking forward to a bright future full of liberty, equality and fraternity. This is all destroyed however with the coming of World War I and the headlines \"KRASH! BOM! BANG!\"\nIn 1918, when the war is over, Pablo once again meets his father, who has invented a new shampoo that will regrow hair. It has another effect on Pablo however, who loses all of his hair and gives him his famous bald look.\nShortly after this, Pablo gets the job to make the sets and clothes for the russian ballet. The ballet, premiering in London, is not a success however. Don Jose makes the dancers' food and all the performers end up passing gas. \nPicasso returns to Paris, where he meets Sirkka (Lena Nyman), a Finnish singer who sings a song that he becomes enchanted by. However, when it turns out that that song (which is essentially a recipe for making a kalakukko (the equivalent of the Russian rybnik or kurnik)) is the only one Sirkka\u2019s got on her repertoire, Picasso soon gets sick of it and leaves for New York City with his father.\nIn America there is a prohibition on art (a reference to the real Prohibition era of liquor). Pablo works underground and one day he is asked to deliver a set of pictures to a Mrs. X. It turns out that this mysterious woman is none other than Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim. She doesn't give up so easily, but Picasso manages to escape her flirting.\nWhen delivering art to the local gangster Big Mac Kahnweiler, Pablo, Don Jose and Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim are caught in a shootout between Big Mac and his rival Mr. Peperoni. The shootout is interrupted however by a police raid. A very foulmouthed cop accuses Pablo of being a murderer and states that art is a lethal poison. It all turns into an impromptu trial against Pablo with Ingrid Svensson-Guggenheim and the two gangs as the jury. Don Jose, acting as Pablo's lawyer tries to defend his son, stating that Picasso's work is not art, but childish graffiti. However, Pablo is still found guilty and is sentenced to death by the electric chair.\nThe chair refuses to work however, and the electrician, a Norwegian named Grieg (Rolv Wesenlund), is sent in to fix it. It all backfires however and in the mess Pablo draws a door on the wall and escapes back to Europe.\nIn Europe however, \"the monsters\" -- Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Francisco Franco\u2014have seized power. Don Jose joins the German army and later on becomes promoted to the rank of Hauptbahnhof (a German word meaning main train station) in the SS, in charge of Operation Ostrich, with the mission to find opposition men in hiding.

Local law enforcement, led by D.A. Coleman (John Lehne), targets Freed for allegedly inciting teenagers to wild and immoral behavior by broadcasting raucous and sexually suggestive rock n' roll songs, many of them by black musicians. WROL station management also dislike Freed's unconventional programming habits, including playing songs that the station has banned such as \"Tutti Frutti\" by Little Richard. Freed nevertheless rejects all suggestions that he change his programming style and feature more socially acceptable musical acts, such as Pat Boone. He also refuses to sign a statement declaring that he never accepted anything in return for playing a record, on the grounds that signing it would be a lie and that all disc jockeys, including those who have signed the statement, take such bribes.\nBecause Freed has the power to make a record a hit by playing it on his show, he is constantly besieged by record promoters and artist managers.  He avoids most of these people, but takes an interest in those who share his love for rock n' roll. He repeatedly rebuffs the aggressive record promoter Lennie Richfield (Jeff Altman), but is kind to Artie Moress (Moosie Drier), a young boy who is the president of a Buddy Holly fan club, and even puts Artie on the air to talk about his idol Holly. Freed also encourages Louise (Laraine Newman), a white teenage songwriter whose parents ignore her talent and disapprove of her associating with the Chesterfields, a black doo-wop group who perform her songs. Freed himself suffers discrimination when he takes a racially mixed group of teenagers with him to look at a luxury home he wants to buy; the owner refuses to sell to him at any price.

Dixon's team includes Sam Smith, a disguise expert who is seen at various points dressed as, among other things, George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and Adolf Hitler; scuba diver Greg Colburn; Olympic swimmer Gretta Attenbaum; and parachute-toting soldier Wilbur Finletter.\nSmith is sent out to infiltrate the tomatoes at a campfire, eventually blowing his cover while eating a hotdog and asking if anyone could \"pass the ketchup.\" Colburn and Gretta are sent to sectors, while Finletter stays with Mason. Meanwhile, the President sends Richardson to the fictitious ad agency Mind Makers, where executive Ted Swan spends vast amounts of money to develop virtually worthless ploys, including a bumper sticker with \"STP\" for \"Stop Tomato Program\" on it, a satirical reference to both the real \"whip inflation now\" campaign with its widely ridiculed \"WIN\" slogan and STP motor oil decals and bumper stickers which were commonplace in the 1970s. A human is revealed to be also plotting to stop Dixon when a masked assassin attempts to shoot him but misses. A senate subcommittee meeting is held where one secret pamphlet is leaked to a newspaper editor, who sends Lois Fairchild on the story. While she tails Finletter, he mistakes her for a spy and trashes a hotel room attempting to kill her. He then chases the assassin as the masked man fails again to kill Dixon, but loses him.\nGretta is killed and further regression has led leaders to bring in tanks and soldiers to the West Coast in a battle that leaves the American forces in shambles. Dixon, walking among the rubble, sees a trail of tomato juice and decides to investigate. He ends up being chased by a killer tomato to an apartment where an oblivious child is listening to the radio. The tomato is about to kill Dixon but suddenly flies out the window. Dixon peers out to see if it has died, and he spots the assassin hijacking his car. He chases the assassin in a \"slow car chase\" that has since been copied by other comedies. Dixon is eventually knocked out by his own car. Awakening, Dixon finds himself captured by Richardson. Though he did not create the killer tomatoes, he has discovered how to control them and plans to do so once civilization has collapsed \u2013 leaving him in control. He is about to reveal his secret of control to Dixon when Finletter charges in and runs him through with his sword. Dixon, picking up some strewn records, realizes that he has seen the tomatoes retreat at the sound of the song \"Puberty Love\", but had not put two and two together until now. He orders Finletter to gather all the remaining people and bring them to the stadium. Finletter remarks that \"only crazy people\" are left in the nearly deserted city, resulting in a motley assortment of people in costumes facing the attacking tomatoes at the stadium.\nThe tomatoes are cornered in a stadium. \"Puberty Love\" is played over the loudspeaker, causing the tomatoes to shrink and allowing the various people at the stadium to squash them by stomping on them repeatedly. Fairchild, meanwhile, is cornered by a giant tomato wearing earmuffs, hence cannot hear the music. Dixon saves her by showing the tomato the sheet music to \"Puberty Love\". He professes his love to her, in song. The film ends with a carrot that rises from the soil and says, \"All right, you guys.

The next day, auditions, led by the director Paul Aviv (Tuvia Tzafir) are held for the three new members. The three chosen members are the forward Giora Datner (Gidi Gov), the nerdy Jerry Lewis-type Bazooka (Meir Suissa), and the beautifully talented Noa (Dafana Armoni). As part of the welcome wagon, the veteran members give the new recruits the silent treatment by playing practical jokes on them.\nDuring a rehearsal, Leicht, the assistant musical director randomly gives Noa a solo that the troupe's prima donna member, Yaffa (Smadar Brenner), initially sings. As Noa amazes everyone in the rehearsal hall, Yaffa storms out of the room. When Datner and Bazooka learn about the new recruit welcome wagon tradition, they decide to get revenge by playing practical jokes back on the veteran troupe members. On their first performance, Yaffa and the troupe's shorty male diva Doron receive electric shocks when touching wet microphones, Shuka, the drummer gets his drums destroyed, Moni, the keyboard player gets powder puffing out of his keyboard, and the audience find it to be hilarious, thinking it was part of the act.\nThe next day, Doron with Moni and Shuka spread dog poop all over Datner's bus seat. When Datner sees the messy seat, he faints. After the seat is cleaned, he suddenly winks at Moni's girlfriend and featured soloist Micki (Liron Nirgad), who begins to have a secret liking for him. The bus brings the troupe from show to show, making stops at cafes in between.\nAlong the journey, the troupe's male lead singer Dani (Sassi Kesshet) and Yaffa's girlfriend, the commander Moti (Doval'e Glickman) both have a love for Noa, which initially causes them to feud.

However at a certain cue, Datner and Bazooka begin to start yelling freaking everyone in the bathroom out.\nFollowing a performance at an Israeli Independence day party, Datner continues to help shy Bazooka with his relationship lessons by hooking him up with two girls, who later are seen as drunk and begin raping Bazooka. He escapes by jumping of a window knocking over a table of food. Meanwhile, Datner and Micki begin to start a secret romance for each other. It is revealed when Datner dumps two cakes on the faces of Doron and Moni and run off with her. Moni calls off the relationship with Micki.\nThe next day on the way to a performance, Moti makes an announcement that the troupe will be performing on national television.

Just then, Micki pulls a cup of yogurt from Aviv's table and dumps it all over his face, screams at him, and storms out of the rehearsal hall. Because of her behavior, Aviv and Moti put Micki on trial sentencing her to 30 days on probation and a transfer to another army base. Upset by the departure of one of the best members and his girlfriend, an angry Datner rebels out and leads the entire troupe in a strike against Aviv until Micki is brought back. Aviv refuses and heads out to Alron's office to tell him about the fiasco.\nOutraged, Alron punishes the entire troupe by announcing that the television appearance is cancelled, and the members will be sent to new army bases.

The scene then shifts to young Magnus on the beach spotting Jennie riding the turtle, heading out to open sea and disappearing beneath the water as he calls after her, then shifts again to his nightmare of the night his father, Lionel, was knocked into the water by an unseen horror in the cave beneath the house and part of his house on a cliff crumbling down to the beach as the storm rages on.\nFinally awakening and groggily gathering his things to go to town, Magnus sees a woman swimming in the ocean. He meets his childhood friend, Eric, at the docks. When Eric asks him where he has been, he admits he has been drifting for a few years. Eric introduces Magnus to Dr. Paulis, whom Eric is working for to finish his master's degree in marine biology. Suddenly, the boat lists violently to one side and the net they pulled up has been shredded by something very large and strong.\nThat evening, the three men are joined by Eric's wife, Doshan, for dinner at Dr. Paulis' house. He explains that he and Eric are doing teratology. Dr. Paulis calls out to Delia to hurry up with dinner. Magnus is intrigued by the necklace she wears, which resembles his own.\nAfter dinner, upon not getting answers to his question about his father's death from Dr. Paulis, Magnus steps outside. He again sees Jennie swimming by the boat. He jumps into the water to follow her, but he is saved from drowning and revived on the beach by the woman, whom he does not recognize. She returns to the ocean, telling him her name is Jennie Haniver. His description of the incident to Dr. Paulis is not taken seriously. Dr Paulis tells him the woman must have been joking with him, as \"Jennie Haniver\" is the name given to a sea creature of local folklore. But Delia later tells him the full legend; Jennie Haniver was a beautiful but vain woman who bargained with a mysterious god to save her from a violent storm at sea, and was granted eternal life at the cost of becoming a sea creature who can never again live on land.\nThe next morning, the police brings in Eric to examine enormous tracks on the beach. Magnus goes down to the beach and meets Jennie. Finally remembering her as his young playmate, he takes her to his father's wrecked house.

Paulis explains that Lionel was conducting tests regarding mutation in sea life when he was attacked and apparently eaten. Magnus asks him if he remembers the turtle from his childhood, and describes how he carved initials on the shell, for himself and Jennie. Paulis is dismayed.\nMagnus awakens to Eric and Dr. Paulis arguing. Eric wants to use the Horror, a harpoon-firing bazooka. Paulis, aghast at the idea, withdraws his support for the expedition. Eric collects Magnus and heads out in the boat. After some trawling, they again find something dragging on the line. Taking a small harpoon gun, Eric dives to try to save the net. He shoots at a form he can see only vaguely. It turns out to be Jennie. Eric and Magnus resume trawling. Magnus tells Eric he had been with Jennie the night before on the beach, and how she was his friend from when he was young. Eric does not remember her, and dismisses her as an imaginary friend. The trawl lines finally catch the turtle, which is so large it begins to tear through the net. Eric blasts it with the Horror, and allows it to run out the line, waiting for it to resurface.\nAfter sundown, the boat's power mysteriously gives out, the compass spins crazily. Magnus leaves the boat's cabin, finds Jennie on board the ship. She begs him to free the turtle, nebulously saying she made a promise long ago she will forever regret.\nAt Doshan's insistence, Dr. Paulis boards a helicopter to fly out to the boat. Upon arriving, he observes a huge shape underwater near the boat. The turtle surfaces, swimming quickly towards the helicopter, then leaping out of the water, sending the helicopter crashing into the ocean. Upon seeing the crash, Eric rushes out onto the deck, but is confronted by Jennie. To his horror, her eyes glow an eerie green, just as the turtle surfaces under the boat, capsizing it. Magnus climbs aboard the lifeboat amidst the wreckage and desperately tries to help Eric on board, but he is entangled in the line from the Horror.

The painter is frightened and tries to run away, but becomes tired, falls from a cliff and lies on the ground, imagining that the alien is going to lock him in a cage and torture him. The alien approaches the painter and tries to hum the same melody that the painter hummed earlier, but makes some mistakes. The painter understands that the alien is friendly, teaches him the correct melody, and they walk away together hand in hand.\nThe film has no dialogue in any language. All communication is made using music, gestures and gazes; the alien also tries to communicate by shapeshifting.

Proceeding on his way, Rubber Duck runs into fellow truck drivers Pig Pen/Love Machine and Spider Mike, when another \"trucker\" informs them over the C.B. that they are okay to increase their speed. The \"trucker\" turns out to be Sheriff \"Dirty Lyle\" Wallace, a long-time nemesis of the Duck, who extorts them for $70 each.\nThe truckers head on to Rafael's Glide-In where the Duck's sometime girlfriend and Lyle's wife, Violet, works as a waitress. Melissa, the driver of the XK-E, is also there; her Jaguar broke down and she had to sell it and some of her belongings in an effort reach Dallas, as she's on her way to look for a job. The Duck offers Melissa a ride; Violet is unimpressed and ushers him away to give him a special birthday present. While they're away, Wallace shows up at the Glide-In checking plates. Pig Pen and Spider Mike start making fun of Wallace over the diner's base-station CB radio, leading to Wallace attempting to arrest Spider Mike for \"vagrancy\".\nThe Duck, having been warned by Widow Woman, enters and tries to smooth things over. But Lyle is determined and insults Mike, who is desperate to get home to his wife. Mike punches Wallace, leading to a brawl in the diner when some troopers arrive to assist Wallace. The assorted truckers prevail, and the Duck handcuffs Wallace to a bar stool. After pulling the spark plug wires and distributor caps out of the police cars, the truckers decide to head for the state line to avoid prosecution.\nThe truckers drive across Arizona and New Mexico, with Wallace in pursuit after he forces a local youth outside the diner to give up his vehicle when he finds him possessing drugs.  He catches up with Duck, but matters are made worse when Melissa accidentally causes Duck to veer into the path of Wallace's vehicle, forcing him to crash through a billboard and into a ditch, infuriating him further. The initial police pursuit is foiled when Duck leads the truckers off the main highway and down a rough dusty desert trail, causing several of the police cars to crash.  Wallace, in yet another vehicle, this time commandeered from one of the state troopers, is again thwarted when Pig Pen and Spider Mike crush his vehicle between their rigs. Additional independent truckers join them to form a mile-long convoy in support of Rubber Duck's vendetta against the abusive Wallace. The truckers communicate with each other via CB radio, and much CB jargon is sprinkled throughout the film. As the rebellious truckers evade and confront the police, Rubber Duck becomes a reluctant hero.\nIt becomes apparent the truckers have a great deal of political support and the Governor of New Mexico, Jerry Haskins, meets Rubber Duck. About the same time, Wallace and a brutal Texas sheriff arrest Spider Mike in Alvarez, Texas.  He had left the convoy to be with his wife after she gave birth to their son. Wallace's plan is to use Mike as \"bait\" to trap Rubber Duck. A janitor at the jail, aware of the plan, send messages by CB radio that Spider Mike has been wrongfully arrested and beaten. Various truckers relay the message to New Mexico.\nRubber Duck ends the meeting with Haskins and leaves to rescue Spider Mike. Several other truckers join him and head east to Texas. The truckers eventually destroy half of the town and the jail and rescue Spider Mike. Knowing they will now be hunted by the authorities, the truckers head for the border of Mexico. On the way, Rubber Duck gets separated from the rest of the convoy when the others get stopped by a traffic accident. The film culminates with a showdown near the United States-Mexico border where Rubber Duck is forced to face Wallace and a National Guard unit stationed on a bridge. Firing a machine gun, Wallace and the Guardsmen cause the truck's tanker trailer to explode, while Rubber Duck deliberately steers the tractor unit over the side of the bridge, plummeting into the churning river below, sending Duck presumably to his death. Pig Pen and the other truckers blast their air horns in salute.\nA public funeral is held for Rubber Duck.  Haskins promises to work for the truckers by taking their case to Washington, D.C. Disgusted with the politics of the situation, Pig Pen abruptly leaves the funeral. A distraught Melissa is led to a school bus with several \"long-haired friends of Jesus\" inside. There she finds Rubber Duck in disguise sitting in the back.

Rural communities and the National Guard have been effective in fighting the zombie hordes in open country, but urban centers descend into chaos.\nAt WGON TV, a television studio in Philadelphia, traffic reporter Stephen Andrews and his pregnant girlfriend, producer Fran Parker, are planning to steal the station's helicopter to escape the city. Across town, police SWAT officer Roger DeMarco and his team raid a low-income housing project, whose mostly African American and Latino tenants are defying the martial law of delivering their dead to the National Guard. The tenants and the officers exchange gunfire as the officers try to gain entry. Roger unsuccessfully tries to restrain Wooley, a brutal and racist officer, after he maniacally kills several unarmed civilians. Wooley is shot dead by an officer from another unit, Peter Washington. As the SWAT team dispatch the reanimated dead that have injured or killed several tenants, a disillusioned Roger suggests that he and Peter desert and join up with Stephen (who is Roger\u2019s friend) in escaping the city. An elderly priest tells them that several zombies are confined in the basement. He also tells them that the SWAT team is stronger than the residents, but that soon the dead will be stronger than the SWAT team.  The two go there and take on the grim job of eliminating all of them.\nLater that night, Stephen discovers the dead body of a security operator who had been guarding a traffic helicopter belonging to his employer. Roger and Peter join Fran and Stephen at a police dock and then leave Philadelphia in the stolen helicopter. Following some close calls while stopping for fuel, the group comes across a shopping mall, and decide to remain there since there is plenty of food, medicine, and all kinds of consumables. Peter and Stephen camouflage the entrance to the stairwell which leads to their safe room, and they block the mall entrances with trucks to keep the undead from penetrating. This involves driving through crowds of zombies who are indifferent to their own injuries and attempt to enter the trucks. Roger survives a particularly dangerous encounter, and becomes reckless as a result. He is soon bitten by the zombies.\nAfter clearing the mall's interior of zombies, the four enjoy a hedonistic lifestyle with all the goods available to them, furnishing their safe room with the mall's many commodities. Roger eventually succumbs to his wounds and dies; when he reanimates as a zombie, Peter shoots him in the head and later buries his body in the mall. Sometime later, all emergency broadcast transmissions cease, suggesting that the government has collapsed. Now isolated, the three load some supplies into the helicopter, in case they might need to leave suddenly.  Fran gets Stephen to teach her how to fly in case he is killed or incapacitated.\nA nomadic biker gang sees the helicopter in flight, and break into the mall, destroying the barriers and allowing hundreds of zombies back inside. Despite having a fallback plan should the mall be attacked, Stephen, consumed by territorial rage over the mall, blindly fires on the looters, beginning a protracted battle. On their way out with whatever goods they could carry, straggling bikers are eventually overwhelmed and eaten by the zombies. Stephen tries to hide in the elevator shaft, but gets shot and subsequently mauled by roaming zombies.

Led by DSP D'Silva (Iftekhar) and Inspector Verma (Satyen Kappu), the police department is working with Interpol officer R.K. Malik (Om Shivpuri) in their attempts to nab Don. Along with the police, Don makes a few other enemies through his merciless approach to running his organization. At this point, one of his henchmen Ramesh (Sharad Kumar) fearfully decides to leave the business of crime and escape from India. However, Don learns about Ramesh's decision and gets hold of him during his attempt of elopement, killing him. This introduces Don to his two new enemies; Kamini (Helen), Ramesh's fianc\u00e9e, and Roma (Zeenat Aman), Ramesh's sister. Kamini seduces Don in an attempt to have the police arrest him, but her plan backfires as Don outsmarts her and the police in his escape. In the process, Don kills Kamini, too. A shattered Roma swears to seek revenge from Don for her brother and sister-in-law's deaths. She gets her hair cut short, trains herself in judo and karate, and enters Don's gang after deceiving the members into believing that she too is on the wrong side of the law. Without suspecting any ulterior motive, Don is impressed with her fighting skills and allows her to work for them all.\nAfter several years of unsuccessful attempts, the police finally succeed in nabbing Don who, however, tricks them all and flees from the spot. During a police chase, he is badly injured by a gunshot inflicted by the police which leads to his sudden disappearance. That night, DSP D'Silva individually encounters a wounded Don hiding in his car and decides to take him into custody alive, to extract the source of the crime organisation that he relies on. While on their way to the police station, Don succumbs to his serious injuries in the car, botching DSP D'Silva's plan. \nStill wanting a chance to take down Don's gang, DSP D'Silva secretly gets Don's dead body buried in a graveyard while ensuring many people that he may still be alive. The only ones who are aware of Don's death are DSP D'Silva himself, the graveyard priest, and his followers. As luck would have it, D'Silva remembers his previous encounter with slum-dwelling simpleton and street performer Vijay (also Amitabh Bachchan), an exact doppelg\u00e4nger of Don who is currently taking care of Deepu and Munni, two motherless children separated from their father. Meeting up with Vijay, DSP D'Silva reveals Don's death to him and hatches a plan to have Vijay impersonate Don, so that he can get the police to arrest the rest of the gang and find out the source of crime that they all rely on. As a startup, Vijay and DSP D'Silva stage an \"accident\" that lands Vijay in a hospital under police custody. This prompts Roma and Don's gang, currently led by Don's right-hand-man Narang (Kamal Kapoor) to kidnap Vijay from the hospital and take him to their hideout, allowing him to infiltrate the gang under the guise of having amnesia.\nAround the same time, a poor widower Jasjit (Pran) is released from prison after being arrested by DSP D'Silva few years ago for a past robbery he was involved in along with Narang. Jasjit took the job only with the intention of using the money to save his ill wife from death, but was caught by D'Silva in the act which resulted in his wife's death. He also intends to reunite with his children Deepu and Munni who are currently being taken care of by Vijay as they went missing after Jasjit's arrest.  \nAs part of his mission, Vijay finds a red diary containing all the addresses and contacts of the criminals and even the evidences regarding their activities. He replaces the diary with a blank one and heads to DSP D'Silva's house to hand him over the real diary. While Vijay is climbing to D'Silva's apartment, Roma chases him and attacks him in an attempt to avenge both Ramesh and Kamini's deaths. Vijay survives the attack and tries to explain to Roma that he is not Don but she refuses to believe him. DSP D'Silva intervenes and confesses about Don's death to Roma, who apologises to Vijay and agrees to help him out in taking down the gang members. Using the diary, DSP D'Silva learns that all of the gang members are working for a notorious crime lord Vardhaan Makhija who is serving as the source of crime in Mumbai (even Don and Narang are nothing more than just middlemen reporting to Vardhaan). Despite this, there is no indication in finding out Vardhaan's identity as it remains unknown. Meanwhile, Vijay announces to the gang members that he has regained his memory after learning more and more about Don's past through the diary. \nHowever, things take a drastic turn when the police, acting upon Vijay's information, raid the hideout during the celebrations and DSP D'Silva, the only witness to Vijay's true identity, is shot in the crossfire while Vijay and the gang members are arrested as Inspector Verma and Malik mistake Vijay for Don. In the hospital, Vijay desperately tries to make a gravely injured DSP D'Silva confess that he is not Don. Unfortunately, DSP D'Silva dies from his serious injuries and Vijay is imprisoned. He is forced to escape from the police truck while on the way to a high-security jail, and the commotion causes Narang and the gang members to finally learn that Vijay is an imposter, just as they too escape from captivity, swearing to kill him. \nTangled in a web of confusion where the police refuse to believe he is Vijay while the gang members realise he is indeed not Don, Vijay learns that the diary (the sole evidence to prove his innocence) is stolen by Jasjit in order to track down Deepu and Munni. He meets Vijay and Roma who team up with him. However, the trio learn that Malik himself is actually Vardhaan who captured the real R.K. Malik (Pinchoo Kapoor) and posed as the latter to cover his crime, and that Vardhaan was the one who had murdered DSP D'Silva during the raid-up and had already exposed Roma's identity to the gang members, before having them kidnap Deepu and Munni so that the trio can surrender themselves and the diary to Vardhaan. After being captured by Vardhaan, Jasjit is reunited with Deepu and Munni and manages to escape the hideout with them, thanking Vijay for taking care of his children. \nMeeting up in the same graveyard where Don was buried, Vardhaan and his gang members who are holding Deepu and Munni hostages, have a long standoff with Vijay, Roma and Jasjit, resulting in Vardhaan grabbing the diary from Roma and throwing it in a fire. Eventually, he calls Inspector Verma and the police to the scene to have the trio and the gang members arrested so that he can get away scot-free. However, anticipating the possibility that Vardhaan would try to escape, Vijay cleverly reveals that the diary that he had thrown in the fire was actually the blank one that he had switched, just as he hands over the real diary to Verma, exposing Vardhaan's identity and occupation to the police. Eventually, Vardhaan and the gang members are arrested and sent to prison for their crimes while all charges against Vijay are dropped.

The film follows three main storylines: (a) the production of the play, (b) Maya\u2019s changing approach to how to portray Medea, and (c) the story of Brenda Collins\u2019 murder of her children. These three storylines are intertwined. Early in the film, we see early scenes from the play being rehearsed, the play\u2019s director and Maya argue about Maya\u2019s (first) interpretation of the character of Medea, and Brenda Collins is introduced. In the middle part of the film, scenes from the middle of the play are rehearsed, and Maya's thoughts about Medea begin to change as she learns more about Brenda Collins\u2019 troubled marriage and as her exploration of Medea makes her rethink some difficult episodes in her own life. In the last part of the film, Maya thinks more deeply about her own life, learns more details about the murders of children, and we see scenes from the end of the play\u2014showing Maya\u2019s final interpretation of Medea.\nThe production of the play is being filmed by a BBC crew. Early in the film, one of Maya's BBC contacts manages to arrange a publicity stunt for Maya, in which Maya will meet an American woman, Brenda Collins, who was imprisoned several years earlier for the murder of her three young children. The Collins family had lived in a suburb of Athens, Glyfada. Brenda committed the murders to punish her husband, Roy, for having an affair with a Greek woman. The press at the time called her \"the Medea of Glyfada.\" Maya happily imagines what the headlines will be after their meeting: \"The Two Medeas.\"\nThe publicity stunt ends in disaster. Brenda is initially happy and excited about talking with Maya, having never met a movie star before, but she is frightened and then infuriated when the press suddenly rushes into the interview room, snapping photos. She screams obscenities and curses at Maya as a nun pulls Brenda out of the room. Maya is horrified at how the stunt turned out and later sends flowers and a note of apology to Brenda. Brenda agrees to meet Maya again, and the two establish something of a friendship.\nTo learn more about Brenda Collins, Maya goes to see the publisher of the Kathimerini newspaper, a woman she already knows. She shows Maya the records the paper still has from their coverage of the case, including crime-scene photos, a copy of the note Brenda left for Roy after the murders, and the notes of a psychologist who examined Brenda after the murders. Maya also visits the Collins' former house (which has remained unoccupied\u2014the chalk outlines are still on the floor, showing where the children's bodies were found) and meets with Brenda several more times at the prison.\nBrenda Collins is a deeply religious woman. She had been devoted to her husband and children and had begged Roy to stop his affair, but he treated her and her faith with disdain. She talks about the events leading up to the murders and the murders themselves with a mix of anguish and fury and a mix of obscenities and quotes from the Bible. She says that she did not kill her children with the story of Medea in mind; she tells Maya that she didn't understand the reference when the press first started calling her a \"Medea.\"\nMaya's research into Brenda's case, looking at it from Brenda's point of view and having rethought difficult events in her own life (in particular, her relationship with her own somewhat estranged husband and her friendship with and later mistreatment of Maria\u2014who was once an actress and is now the prompter for the stage production), causes Maya to rethink her portrayal of Medea.

Wong provokes and challenges him to a fight and is soundly defeated and humiliated. He makes his way back to Beggar So and decides to commit himself to the Drunken Master's training program. The training resumes and soon Wong learns Beggar So's secret style of martial arts, a form of Drunken Boxing called \"The Eight Drunken Immortals\", named after the eight xian that the fighting style references. Wong masters seven of the eight styles with the exception of Drunken Miss Ho's as he feels that her style of fighting is too feminine.\nMeanwhile, Yim Tit-sam is contracted by a business rival to kill Wong's father. Wong's father fights with Yim and is defeated and injured by him. Wong and Beggar So arrive on time and Wong continues the fight with Yim. Beggar So promises not to interfere in the fight. Wong employs the new skills he has learned and outmatches Yim's kicking style. Yim then resorts to his secret technique, the Devil's Shadowless Hand, which is too fast for Wong to defeat. Wong confesses that he did not master the last style so Beggar So tells him to combine the seven styles and create his own version of the last style. Wong follows the instruction and discovers his own unique style of Drunken Miss Ho, which he uses to overcome the Shadowless Hand and finally defeats Yim.", "tmdb_id": 11230}, "47927421": {"title": "Dui Purush (1978 film)", "plot": "Nutubihari Mukherjee is a freedom fighter who makes many sacrifices when he goes to jail and continues to do good even after his release.

The screenplay is a cautionary tale about terrorists attacking major cities in the United States using hijacked commercial airliners containing nuclear bombs as the attack vehicles.  No one knows the content of the script or its author who Craig claims is a new writer by the name of Malcolm Hart.\nBret Easton (Vince Edwards) is a popular American film actor, director and producer who lives and makes films in Europe.  His most recent film is about a revolution and uprising in a third world country in which he portrays the leader of the revolutionaries in the film.  He secretly arranges to get a copy of Craig's script by sending several women to Murphy's hotel suite.  While Murphy is otherwise occupied one of the women takes the script downstairs to the copier machine in the hotel offices.\nCraig meets a former love, Constance Dobson (Shirley Jones) and they decide to travel into the countryside together to a small inn.  Meanwhile, Easton has read Craig's script at his Riviera mansion and is deeply troubled.  His underling, Fabricio (Gregory Sierra) asks him what he wishes to be done.  Easton replies, \"We'll have to kill Mr. Craig.\"  Later that evening, Fabricio secretly enters Craig's room at the inn where Craig and Constance are staying and plants a bomb among Craig's clothing.  The bomb is a string of plastic explosives concealed within the belt of Craig's bathrobe.  When the ends of the belt are drawn together it closes the circuit setting off the electrical detonator of the bomb.  After Craig enters the room he goes to the bathroom to shower.  Constance undresses to surprise Craig when he emerges from the bathroom.  She puts on Craig's robe and unknowingly detonates the bomb when she ties the belt.  The bomb blast kills Constance and injures Craig who is taken to a local hospital.\nThe police inform Craig that he was the intended target of the bomb and the type of bomb that was used is the trademark of an assassin who works for a terrorist group that has been staging attacks across Europe. Craig starts his own investigation in an attempt to avenge Constance's murder.  He meets a reporter, Gail McKinnon (Erin Gray) who wants to interview him.  She ends up assisting him with his inquiries.  Craig also contacts an old friend who he had served with in the war, U.S. Air Force Major General Jerry Olson (Harry Guardino), who commands the nearby NATO Air Force Base, for help in gathering intelligence about this terrorist group.\nAfter many plot twists and harrowing experiences Jesse and Gail uncover the fact that Bret Easton is one of the leaders of the terrorist group and the reason he tried to murder Jesse was that Jesse's screenplay, of which Jesse is the real author, comes very close to describing the terrorists' latest attack plan.  Meanwhile, the terrorists have secretly taken control of three airliners and have landed them on remote and desolate airfields that have been prepared in advance to off load and imprison the airliners' passengers and then quickly retrofit the planes to each transport and drop a nuclear bomb on three cities in the United States.  These cities are Washington, D.C., New York City, and Miami, Florida.\nBombs have been planted on three flying commercial airliners and set to detonate in flight so the terrorist-controlled jets can impersonate the legitimate commercial flights. Jesse Craig and Gail confront Easton on Easton's yacht which is at sea several miles off the coast.  Easton confirms Craig's suspicions while boasting about his grand plans and then tries to murder him.  A violent brawl ensues and Easton tries to stab Craig with a small sharpened boat anchor.  Craig gets a hold of a revolver that he had taken off a dead terrorist before he boarded the yacht and shoots Easton dead.\nJesse and Gail use the radio-telephone on the yacht to contact General Olson.  It turns out that General Olsen is flying on one of the targeted jetliners and he is onboard speaking with Jesse via cockpit radio when the bomb onboard explodes.  Realizing that General Olson is dead, Jesse contacts General Olson's executive officer at the NATO base and informs him of events.

Believing that he is falling for her, Philo decides to set off for Lynn's home in Denver, Colorado.\nAlong the way, he has a run-in with a motorcycle gang called the Black Widows, who incur Philo's wrath after two gang members insult him and Clyde at a traffic light. Philo chases them down and takes their bikes (which he repaints, repairs, and resells), and every attempt they make to get even results in disaster.

Orville makes the arrangements, and Philo faces his elderly nemesis. During the fight, the crowd, initially pro-Murdock, begins to insult him, with some murmurs that Philo is going to be the next Murdock.

The laborers go to the office of Boss Andrews, where Kovak believes he negotiates a deal for the workers, only to find out the next day that he and his friend Abe Belkin have been fired.\nKovak and Belkin are approached by Mike Monahan, who was impressed by their leadership. He offers them positions in the Federation of Inter State Truckers (F.I.S.T.), where they will be paid according to how many members they can recruit.

The segment ends with photographs, footage and air traffic control audio from the crash of PSA Flight 182 and its grisly aftermath of scattered mutilated body parts and numerous destroyed houses. Gr\u00f6ss states that the neighborhood still smells like \"rotting bodies and jet fuel\", and that a mutilated body with only its torso and right hand \"is the worst face of death\".\nGr\u00f6ss introduces his next topic, the role of supernatural forces in death. He meets with architect Joseph Binder, whose wife and son both died under tragic circumstances. He confides to the viewer that he believes his family remain as ghosts in his house, attempting to communicate with him. Gr\u00f6ss enlists the services of parapsychologists to verify this. The team takes photographs of footprints and two apparitions. Binder communicates with the spirits of his family through a medium, seemingly confirming the existence of life after death.\nAfter studying Binder's case, Gr\u00f6ss concludes, \"when we die, it isn't really the end\" as \"the soul in each of us remains a traveller forever\". Gr\u00f6ss ends by questioning whether death is \"the end of the beginning or the beginning of the end\" and leaves the footage he has shown to the viewer's interpretation.

All are shocked when it is confirmed Fedora committed suicide by throwing herself in front of a train.\nOne of her mourners at her funeral is aging has-been Hollywood producer Barry \"Dutch\" Detweiler, who was once Fedora's lover. Dutch recalls visiting Fedora two weeks before her death at her villa near Corfu in order to convince her to come out of retirement for a new screen adaptation of Anna Karenina. Dutch is suspicious when Fedora seems confused, disheveled, and cannot remember details of their love affair. Fedora tells him she is a prisoner on the island, held captive by the elderly Polish Countess Sobryanski, her overprotective servant Miss Balfour, her chauffeur Kritos, and Dr. Vando, the cosmetic surgeon responsible for keeping Fedora looking so young. Dutch attempts to help Fedora flee the island, but Kritos knocks him unconscious. He awakens a week later to discover Fedora has killed herself. Dutch suspects she was murdered by the countess for revealing the secret of her captivity.\nAt the funeral, Dutch accuses Vando and the countess of murdering Fedora. The countess reveals that in fact she is Fedora, with whom Dutch had the affair. The woman who died was her daughter Antonia, who took her mother's place after one of Fedora's surgical treatments disfigured her face. Antonia closely resembled her mother physically but was a much better actress, causing people to believe Fedora herself had become more skillful with age. The deception went undetected until Antonia fell in love with actor Michael York while making a film with him. She begged her mother to be allowed to tell Michael the truth, but the scandal would have ruined both Antonia's career and Fedora's legacy.

The joy of finding the comet is short-lived, however, when it is determined that it may hit the Earth in just eight days.  Dreiser is summoned to see the President (Andrew Duggan) at his vacation home, along with a number of other experts, to discuss the situation.  Astronomer Jason Voight (Richard Crenna), a specialist in near-Earth objects, shocks the group by telling them that the comet will hit within 50 miles of Phoenix.  Voight urges the President to order an evacuation of Phoenix and the surrounding area, but the President ultimately leaves that decision in the hands of Arizona's governor, Michael Ritchie (Nicolas Coster). The President does order the nuclear warheads of a Minuteman ICBM to be launched into space aboard a Titan-Centaur rocket, so that an attempt can be made at destroying the comet.\nAfter talking with the President, Governor Ritchie meets with a number of key people, including his chief of staff Elliott Kirkwood (Kip Niven), insurance executive Paul Gilliam (Lloyd Bochner), newspaper owner David Allan (David Dukes), and emergency management officer Wayne Lustus (William Bogert). David's wife, television station owner Sharon Allan (Elizabeth Ashley), gets wind of the meeting, but is unable to get David to tell her what's going on.

Sharon Allan is the only media person in town who is willing to discuss the issue with him. Ultimately, Voight convinces her to put him on the air and describes what will happen when the comet hits. Voight's broadcast has one desired effect\u2014people begin leaving the city for safety. But it also leads to businesses being looted. Governor Ritchie instructs Elliott to report the broadcast to the Federal Communications Commission, in an effort to get Sharon's television station's license to broadcast revoked.\nThe U.S. Air Force's attempt to intercept the comet is broadcast on national television. Both of the nuclear warheads detonate behind the comet's nucleus, in its tail. Once it has been confirmed that the comet is still on course to hit the Earth, the network broadcast is interrupted with instructions from Civil Defense urging citizens of Phoenix to begin leaving the area immediately. Governor Ritchie, now understanding the real danger posed by the comet, resolves to withdraw the FCC protest against Sharon's station, and he takes to the TV to urge people to evacuate the city.\nOn the day of the comet's impact, Voight tells Jennifer to meet him in Tucson, so that they can go off to Mexico together. Jennifer begs him to go directly to Tucson with her, but he insists on taking some scientific equipment to the comet's projected impact point, to record atmospheric and seismic data from the impact. When he gets to the impact area, in the desert outside the city, he finds a large group of Pima Indians whose truck has broken down. Voight calls for help on his Citizens Band radio and is promised that helicopters will pick them up as soon as possible. Not knowing if the help is really going to come, Voight gives the keys to his car to one of the adults in the stranded group, and after packing all the young children into the car, gives the man instructions to head away from the impact zone.\nEvacuees clog the roads leading out of Phoenix, and many of them pour into Sky Harbor Airport to catch flights out of the city. These people include Paul Gilliam, his wife Ellen (Marj Dusay), and their daughter Paula (Cindy Eilbacher). When her parents leave their car to go into the airport terminal, Paula stays behind to look for some jewelry her mother has forgotten. This gives Paula the opportunity to get back to her boyfriend, Tom Reardon (Michael Biehn), a rough-and-tumble college student with whom she has a romantic relationship and of whom her father disapproves. Tom's grandmother (Diana Douglas) refuses to leave her home and Tom is unwilling to leave her to face the comet's impact alone, so Tom, Mrs. Reardon, and Paula begin preparing for the coming disaster.\nIn the hours before impact, Stan Webster (Merlin Olsen), who is leading a group of young boys including his nine-year-old son, Danny (Dino Bachelor) on a survival hike, finds out about the comet over the radio. With no shelter immediately available, Webster and the boys dig themselves into the desert floor and cover themselves with sleeping bags in a desperate attempt to survive the impact.

Their small aircraft is destroyed after hitting a larger commercial plane, tearing the landing gear off the commercial plane and forcing it to be diverted to San Diego. Meanwhile, Ann Webster (Jenny O'Hara), who has been in the family station wagon looking for her husband and son, has broken down in the desert and takes cover in a drainage ditch. Tom, Mrs. Reardon, and Paula take cover in the farmhouse's cellar. David Allan, who had been drafted to help evacuate patients from a local hospital, takes refuge with them in the basement of a bank building downtown. Sharon Allan, who keeps her television station on the air until the last possible moment, rushes to the lowest levels of a parking garage with several members of her staff in the moments before impact. Jennifer Dreiser arrives safely in Tucson before the comet hits.\nHelicopters never arrive to airlift Voight and the stranded Pima Indian adults out of the impact zone. As the comet makes its final approach, Voight looks up and sees the fire in the sky that he had warned so many people about. He and the others are all incinerated when the comet strikes. Strong winds and earth tremors devastate Phoenix. The bank building's basement, though rattled by the impact, holds up and David and everyone else inside survive. Sharon is abandoned by her colleagues when they think the parking garage is going to cave in. One of them eventually makes it to the bank building for medical treatment after the impact and tells David where Sharon is. David finds Sharon amidst the rubble of the garage, and after a tearful reunion, they vow to work on their struggling marriage.

He plans to steal a monthly shipment of gold from the London to Folkestone train which is meant as payment for British troops fighting in the Crimean War. The gold is heavily guarded in two heavy safes in the baggage car, each of which has two locks, requiring a total of four keys. Pierce recruits Robert Agar, a pickpocket and screwsman. Pierce's mistress Miriam (Lesley-Anne Down) and his chauffeur Barlow (George Downing) join the plot, and a train guard, Burgess, is bribed into participation. The executives of the bank who arrange the gold transport, the manager Mr. Henry Fowler and the president Mr. Edgar Trent, each possess a key; the other two are locked in a cabinet at the offices of the South Eastern Railway at the London Bridge railway station. In order to hide the robbers' intentions, wax impressions are to be made of each of the keys.\nPierce ingratiates himself with Trent by feigning a shared interest in ratting. He also begins courting Trent's spinster daughter, Elizabeth (Gabrielle Lloyd), and learns from her the location of her father's key. Pierce and Agar successfully break into Trent's home at night, manage to locate the hidden key and make a wax impression before making a clean getaway despite a close call with the butler.\nPierce targets Fowler through his weakness for prostitutes. Miriam reluctantly poses as \"Madame Lucienne\", a high-class courtesan in an exclusive bordello. Miriam meets with Fowler and asks him to undress, forcing him to remove the key worn round his neck. While Fowler is distracted by Miriam, Agar makes an impression of his key. Pierce then stages a phony police raid to rescue Miriam, forcing Fowler to flee to avoid a scandal.\nThe keys at the train station prove a much harder challenge. After a daytime diversionary tactic with a child pickpocket fails because Agar cannot wax them in the time available, Pierce decides to \"crack the crib\" at night. The whole operation is a matter of timing, because the officer guarding the railway office at night leaves his post only once, for seventy-five seconds (to go to the toilet). Pierce plans to use \"snakesman\" (cat burglar) Clean Willy to climb the station's wall, climb down into the station, enter the office via a small skylight in the office ceiling, and open the office door and the key cabinet from within. Because Clean Willy is incarcerated at Newgate Prison, Pierce and Agar first have to arrange for him to break out, using a public execution as a distraction. With Willy's help, the criminals succeed in making wax impressions of the keys without detection.\nClean Willy is subsequently arrested after being caught pick-pocketing and informs on Pierce. The police use Willy to lure Pierce into a trap, but the master cracksman easily eludes capture. Clean Willy escapes from his captors, but is murdered by Barlow on Pierce's orders. The authorities, now aware that a robbery is imminent, increase security by having the baggage car padlocked from the outside until the train arrives at its destination and forbidding anyone but the guard to travel in the baggage van. Any container large enough to hold a man must be opened and inspected before it is loaded on the train.\nPierce smuggles Agar into the baggage car disguised as a corpse in a coffin.  Pierce plans to reach the car across the coach roofs while the train is under way, but he and Miriam encounter Fowler, who is riding the train to Folkestone to accompany the shipment. After arranging for Miriam to travel in the same compartment as Fowler to divert his attention, Pierce travels down the roof of the train and unlocks the baggage van's door from the outside.  He and Agar replace the gold with lead bars and toss the bags of gold off the train at a prearranged point. However, soot from the engine's smoke has stained Pierce's skin and clothes and he is forced to borrow Agar's suit, which is much too small for him. The jacket splits across the back when he disembarks at Folkestone. The police quickly become suspicious and arrest him before he can rejoin his accomplices.\nPierce is put on trial for the robbery. As he exits the courthouse, he receives the adulation of the crowds, who consider him a folk hero for his daring act. In the commotion, a disguised Miriam kisses him full on the mouth, in the process slipping a key to his handcuffs from her mouth to his. Agar is also present, disguised as a police van driver.

Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Lieutenant Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) escape the crippled plane.\nThe survivors come upon a band of men they believe to be partisans but are later revealed as collaborationist Chetniks led by Captain Drazak. Taken prisoner, they tell the German commander in control of the area, Major Schroeder, that they are deserters. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's explosives suitcase, Mallory claims it contains the new drug \"penicillin\" which will spoil if exposed. The next morning the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. They improvise an excuse, \"admitting\" they buried the samples. Schroeder sends Barnsby and Mallory to retrieve them under the guard of his concubine Maritza and three soldiers. Miller, Weaver, and Reynolds are left in camp.\nFar from camp, Maritza kills the Germans, revealing herself to be a partisan and the person who hid the explosives. She directs Mallory and Barnsby towards the partisan camp under the command of her father, Major Petrovich. Mallory and Barnsby escape and meet a patrol of real Yugoslav partisans led by Lescovar, who has gained Petrovich's trust. Mallory and Barnsby are taken to the camp, which lies near a hydroelectric dam. An arch bridge spanning the river ravine is set to be used by a German force for an impending assault on the partisans, who have been unable to destroy the bridge. Barnsby reveals that the bridge is Force 10's target.\nMallory convinces Petrovich to mount a rescue mission of demolitions expert Miller, using Lescovar and Marko, a loyal partisan. The four re-enter the camp at night, with Mallory and Barnsby posing as captives, and Lescovar and Marko disguised as Chetniks. Drazak discovers that Maritza must have helped Miller and Mallory escape, and begins beating her viciously. Schroeder and Reynolds are killed in a gun battle, but the others escape with a badly beaten Maritza and the recovered explosives.\nMiller reveals that the bridge is impregnable, which Barnsby refuses to accept. Mallory hits upon the idea of destroying the upstream dam, to use the sudden onrush of millions of gallons of water to destroy the bridge. A night-time air drop is arranged to replace Force 10's lost supplies, but Lescovar, revealed to be the saboteur, calls in German planes to stop the drop. Maritza catches Lescovar in the act, but he kills her before she can warn the others, and German planes bomb the illuminated drop zone, killing numerous partisans.\nPetrovich, angered by the botched air drop, orders the men to be sent to Marshal Tito's headquarters for transport back to Italy. Accompanied by Lescovar and Marko, the team instead infiltrates the German marshaling yards at Mostar to steal explosives. Lescovar again betrays them, alerting a German sergeant to their presence. Marko sacrifices himself to save the others, who escape with Lescovar aboard a train leaving for Sarajevo. Lescovar is questioned by the others, who have grown suspicious of him. Lescovar initially denies the accusations, but gives himself away and is shot dead by Barnsby, who then asks Mallory to return the favour by helping him accomplish Force 10's mission.\nJumping the train near the dam, the team splits up: Miller and Weaver run a diversion, while Mallory and Barnsby sneak into the dam. Weaver runs into Captain Drazak and kills him in a knife fight. Mallory and Barnsby set their charges within the dam; its structural integrity compromised by the blast, the dam wall bursts, releasing a torrent of water that topples the bridge. The German assault is thwarted, saving Petrovich and the partisans.\nMallory and Barnsby rejoin Miller and Weaver, but Mallory reminds the others they are trapped on the wrong side of the river. As the credits roll, the men begin a strenuous journey back to friendly lines.", "tmdb_id": 17339}, "1002717": {"title": "Foul Play (1978 film)", "plot": "A Catholic archbishop returns home, walks into a room and puts on a record.

Gloria sits with a friend and is encouraged to open herself to new experiences. Driving home, Gloria picks up an attractive man named Bob \"Scotty\" Scott (Bruce Solomon) when she encounters him next to his broken down car at Powell and Market streets. She impulsively accepts Scotty's invitation to join him at the movies that evening, and before they part ways, he asks her to take his pack of cigarettes to help him curb his smoking. Unknown to her, Scotty has secreted a roll of undeveloped film in the cigarette pack. That evening, a seriously wounded Scotty meets Gloria in the movie theater and asks her about the film. He bleeds into her popcorn and warns her to \"beware of the dwarf\" before he dies. When his body mysteriously disappears while Gloria seeks help from the theater manager, she is unable to convince anyone of what has transpired. At home she tells her elderly neighbour/landlord Mr. Hennessey (Burgess Meredith) of the events.\nAt the end of the next day, Gloria is attacked in her library by albino Whitey Jackson (William Frankfather) who tries to use ether on her. She runs off and hides in a singles bar where she asks a stranger, Stanley Tibbets (Dudley Moore), to take her home, but Stanley, an aspiring British womanizer, who assumes she is picking him up to have sex, mixes a cocktail laced with Spanish Fly and puts on the Bee Gees.\nShocked by his misunderstanding, she flees and returns to her apartment, where she is attacked by a man with a scar who demands the cigarette pack Scotty had given her. When he attempts to strangle her with a scarf, Gloria stabs him in the stomach with a pair of knitting needles and calls the police for help. When the attacker tries to stop her, he is killed by a knife thrown by Whitey through the kitchen window, and Gloria faints in shock. When she awakens, all traces of what has happened have disappeared, and she is unable to convince two San Francisco police officers, Lt. Tony Carlson (Chevy Chase) and his partner Inspector \"Fergie\" Ferguson (Brian Dennehy), or even her landlord Mr. Hennessy that she was attacked.\nGloria is abducted by Turk Farnum (Ion Tedorescu), the chauffeur of a limousine in which she earlier had seen Whitey riding, but she manages to subdue him with mace and brass knuckles given to her by her friend and fellow library employee, Stella (Marilyn Sokol). Upon further investigation, Tony discovers that Scotty, an undercover SFPD inspector who had received a tip that a major assassination would take place in the city on a certain night, was investigating contract killer Rupert Stiltskin (alias \"the Dwarf\"). Now assigned to protect Gloria from her would-be killers, Tony later takes her to his houseboat, where the two fall in love.\nWhen Tony and Fergie discover that the limousine is registered to the archdiocese of San Francisco, they visit the office of Archbishop Thorncrest (Eugene Roche), unaware that their interviewee is actually the archbishop's twin brother Charlie, who is involved in a plot to assassinate Pope Pius XIII (played by prominent San Francisco businessman Cyril Magnin) during his upcoming visit to San Francisco, and has murdered his twin in order to impersonate him. The following day, Rupert kidnaps Fergie and uses him to lure Gloria into a trap. She manages to hide in a massage parlor, where she encounters Stanley yet again, but Whitey and Stiltskin then find and abduct her.\nAt Gloria's request, Stella has researched an organization known as the Tax the Churches League, and discovered that the league is a radical fringe group founded by Delia Darrow and her husband. For the Darrows, organized religion is a corrupt, greedy sham involving powerful billion-dollar corporations. Stella gives the results of her findings to Tony, who returns to the archbishop's residence with Mr. Hennessy. Sneaking into the wine cellar, Tony discovers the imprisoned Fergie, who informs him that the Darrows hired Stiltskin to assassinate the Pope during a performance of The Mikado at the San Francisco Opera House that evening. Tony is attacked by Rupert and kills him in self-defense by toppling shelves of wine upon him, but the fake archbishop's assistant Gerda Caswell (Rachel Roberts), who is really Delia Darrow, holds him and Gloria at gunpoint.\nDarrow then details her \"contingency plan\" to eliminate the pope: If the pope is not dead at the end of act I, Whitey Jackson will open fire from one of the auditorium's two organ bays (\"He will also open fire should the pope unexpectedly leave his seat, or if the police arrive in the auditorium\", Darrow explains). Mr. Hennessy knocks out Charlie and defeats Delia in a duel of martial arts, after which Tony and Gloria drive to the opera house, having some unusual problems along the way (such as crashing into an Italian restaurant and commandeering an airport limousine carrying a pair of Japanese tourists). After making it backstage, Gloria is grabbed by Jackson, who kills one of several security guards who have joined the pursuit. An enraged Gloria attempts to attack Jackson, who simply shoves her to the floor. This gives Tony the room he needs to shoot the albino, thus thwarting the plan to kill the pope. When the albino falls from the rafters, he gets tangled in ropes and activates a lever that lowers a stage-length display of the ship H.M.S. Pinafore, which is completely unrelated to the classical production.

Hamilton is killed trying to rescue a badly wounded man who was left behind by a combat patrol. An anguished Oleonozski commits suicide the next day. When informed of the deaths, Barker wants to pull his troops out now that they lack an experienced leader, but this request is denied by General Harnitz forcing Barker to send Olivetti to Muc Wa. That night, the outpost is attacked again by a large force of well-armed Viet Cong, not the few dozen predicted by high command. US helicopter gunships arrive just in time to save the outpost from being overrun.\nThe next morning, Harnitz finally orders Barker to withdraw all American troops from Muc Wa, which is now believed to be besieged by the 1,000-strong 507th Viet Cong battalion. However, all the South Vietnamese and the walking wounded are to be left. Barker volunteers to stay and help evacuate these troops. Cowboy kills some Vietnamese civilians that Courcey brought into the base camp after they stole weapons and tried to escape. But a teenage girl, who Courcey tried to befriend, escapes and informs the VC of the Americans' evacuation plans. As night falls, Barker and Courcey begin the retreat from Muc Wa under the cover of friendly artillery fire. However, the group is ambushed and Barker is killed by the waiting VC, who are led by the same teenage girl. A wounded Courcey is hidden in bushes by an elderly militiaman.\nThe next morning, Courcey is the only survivor. He finds that Barker and the South Vietnamese militia soldiers have been stripped of their uniforms and weapons. A dazed Courcey staggers into the French graveyard where he encounters the one-eyed VC scout whom he had seen earlier. The badly wounded VC raises his rifle at Courcey before dropping it out of exhaustion.

Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so a new body must be found for him. After rejecting several possible men who are about to die, Joe is persuaded to accept the body of a multi-millionaire industrialist. Leo Farnsworth has just been drugged and drowned in his bathtub by his cheating gold digger wife Julia Farnsworth and her lover Tony Abbott, Farnsworth's personal secretary.\nJulia and Tony are confused when Leo reappears alive and well, and Farnsworth's domestic staff is confused by the changes in some of his habits and tastes. Still obsessed with his football destiny, Farnsworth/Joe buys the Rams to lead them to the Super Bowl as their quarterback. To succeed, he must first convince and then secure the help of a longtime friend and trainer Max Corkle to get his new body in shape. At the same time, he falls in love with Betty Logan, an environmental activist, whom he met when she came to his doorstep to protest the original Farnsworth's corporate policies.\nWith the Rams about to play in the Super Bowl, all the characters face a crisis. Mr. Jordan informs Joe that he must give up Farnsworth's body as well. Joe resists but hints to Betty that she might someday meet someone else, possibly another quarterback, and should think of him. Julia and Abbott continue their murderous plans, and Abbott finally shoots Farnsworth/Joe dead. The Rams are forced to start Tom Jarrett, another quarterback, in the climactic game. A detective, Lieutenant Krim, interrogates the suspects while they watch the game on television. With the help of Corkle, he gets Julia and Abbott to incriminate each other.\nAfter a brutal hit on the field, Jarrett is killed. With Mr. Jordan's help, Joe occupies Jarrett's body and leads the Rams to victory. During the team's postgame celebration, Corkle finds Joe, and when he realizes that it is him, they share an emotional embrace. As Joe is being interviewed on television, Mr. Jordan tells him that, to live as Tom Jarrett, he will have to lose the memories of his life as Joe Pendleton. As Mr. Jordan disappears, Tom/Joe becomes disoriented. Corkle goes to find Joe later and is crestfallen to realize that Joe has \"left\" Tom. \nTom bumps into Betty while leaving the stadium. They strike up a conversation, and each appears to recognize the other, but they do not know how. The lights go out in the stadium as they exit the venue, and Tom says something that reminds Betty of Farnsworth/Joe. Looking into his eyes, Betty remembers what he said to her before and whispers \u201cYou\u2019re the quarterback.\u201d Tom asks her to go with him for coffee, and she accepts.", "tmdb_id": 12185}, "20904334": {"title": "Heeralaal Pannalal (1978 film)", "plot": "The movie starts with two innocent and kind hearted guys named Heeralal (Shashi Kapoor) and Pannalal (Randhir Kapoor).

Roger loves the idea, ignoring the warnings that Sonny and Ski might not survive the landing even if the car lands on its wheels. Max Berns, the movie's producer and a longtime friend of Sonny's, warns Roger that the film is already over budget and they can't afford the $100,000 Hooper wants to perform the rocket car jump.

Seeing Jocko in the hospital motivates Sonny to promise Gwen that he will quit the business after the film wraps.  Then, Sonny's assistant and best friend Cully (James Best) reveals the rocket car stunt and Sonny's secret visit to his doctor to a horrified Gwen.  Sonny later tells Roger that he is backing out of the gag, but Max convinces him to reconsider, as no qualified stuntman is available, or willing, to replace him and Ski cannot do it alone.

While taking a break from being in a relationship, Donald cannot help but notice the dozens of beautiful young women New York has to offer in the swinging seventies. But Becker's swing needs a big push to get off the ground, yet he finds friendship in the company of Sally Claybrook (Armstrong) who is currently in an off  and on relationship (presently off) with married man Frank Cavanaugh (Rudolph Willrich).\nUpon arriving at Harrington's apartment, (413 E 68th street) Becker cannot get in and valiantly tries to gain entrance without a key or knowledge of new fellow tenants.

Robby tries to update Donald's fashion and confidence to the New York lifestyle in a trendy fashion store where they meet Pam (Fobesy Russell) and Denise (Hollis Winick). Denise eventually ends up in bed with Pam and Harrington, and Becker sadly walks the streets wearing his new ensemble but quickly reconfirms that this is not who he really is, as he sees a mannequin in the window wearing the very same clothing articles. As Becker states in a bar with Claybrook  \"I look like a runner-up in a John Travolta look-a-like contest\".\nThe bar scene is a pivotal point in the film as Sally shares a recording of an on the spot interview with Howard Cosell, and inspires Donald by saying, \"You know anybody will talk to you with a tape recorder in your hand, it makes you look like you know what you're actually doing.\"  The Cosell interview is for Sally's thesis on pop art and its relationship to society. Donald meets Terry (Denise Flamino), a gorgeous young woman in the bar, grips the tape recorder and microphone and tries Claybrook's technique and gets her number. This bumps up Donald's confidence and he courageously goes to the source on what makes women tick, and the best way to approach them. Unfortunately this confidence ultimately blinds Becker as he swoons Cynthia Miller (Deborah Raffin), an alluring model and girlfriend of his employer (Chandler Cory) of four years. When Donald informs Robby of his dinner date, Harrington tells him, \"That's terrific I'm very proud of you, you're making great progress, now break the date, is it worth your job?\" Becker responds, \"It's worth my life!\" Donald calls from Studio 54, to tell Robby how well it's going, Harrington tries his best to stop Donald from going any further, but to no avail, the two hit the dance floor in a spectacular liveliness which really defines the New York Disco scene.\nDonald has the best night of his life, then has the worst day when Chandler humiliates Becker while firing him. Donald takes to the hubs to record audio for his book on how to pick up girls, even though both Sally and Robby discourage him from doing it. In the midst of Becker getting more material for his book he sees Claybrook infuriatingly leave the apartment exclaiming, \"I'm a failure and a fraud\" because the notes for her thesis are just culminating with no signs of fruition. Donald takes her apartment key from her secret spot (a humble loose bannister knob) and organizes the archives and bestows all the credit to Max, her dog who isn't the best watchdog. Sally invites Donald up to the roof for a surprise picnic, Donald having undeniable romantic feelings for Sally, and he believing they're mutual, he finally pushes to know what's the story between her and Cavanaugh. While finishing the typing of \"The End\" of his book, Sally hysterically knocks on the door with wine and flutes to celebrate the triumph of her thesis. The two end up spirited by the wine singing \"On the Banks of the Wabash, Far Away\", the very song which introduced the two. Donald makes a move on Claybrook, and the two become an item.\nWith multiple manuscript rejections and red wine to soften the fall, Claybrook cheers up Becker by scratching off Cavanaugh's name from the mail box. Donald receives a letter to meet with Dana Greenberg, editor (Polly Bergen) and throws oil on the fire by assuming Dana Greenberg is a man, believing only a man would be interested in his book. Ms. Greenberg hated the book and only sent the letter to personally insult and reject Donald. Sally cheers up Donald by singing \"The Sons of Nebraska\" (an old collegiate football fight song), then introduces Donald to a printer by the name of Nathan Perlmutter (Abe Vigoda) who begins sentences with \"Based on my experience\" and instructs Becker on taking ads out in magazines to bring his book exposure, then getting the orders for the books first, then printing them. Perlmutter instructs the two not to go to the post office for a week. Yet every day the two meet at the post office only to witness lint in the box. On the day the rent is due on the p.o. box, Donald asks Sally if he could go alone. Donald receives a note to report to the postal carrier, and is reprimanded on having his mail pile up. As excited as Donald is to announce the news to Sally's door, that jubilation is halted as Frank Cavanaugh opens the door, making things difficult and complicated between the two as Donald cannot fully celebrate his success with Sally. Becker's star keeps climbing as press and beautiful women clamor for him, even the venomous Dana Greenberg sees Donald's book and stardom skyrocket, and decides to gain a reprieve with him. Soon enough Harrington and Becker's apartment become too crowded with overstock of his book, Donald seeks a more suitable abode to complement his successful jet-set lifestyle and his best friend Robby. With all of his success, he still sulks and wishes things with Claybrook worked out. While back at the old apartment Donald stands in the center of a maze of boxes packing his book in envelopes, Sally comes to tell him that she's leaving to Chicago for good with Frank Cavanaugh. She gets a cold and unfeeling \"goodbye\" from Donald and the two get into an argument that has Sally storming off, toppling the maze of boxes.\nDonald visits with Dana Greenberg to discuss the paperback right to his book, once again she insults his book while insisting he be a spokesman on \"swinging singles\" \"the definitive expert on picking up girls\". Donald insists his book is not silly and he couldn't be spokesman for anything, \"I didn't write this book for swinging singles, they don't need one. I wrote this book about loneliness and how to find somebody\". During the meeting Donald realizes that he's done being petty with the Cavanaugh/ Claybrook situation and wants to profess his undying love for Sally, by telling Greenberg, \"You know I suddenly have a yen for frozen yogurt\" (the celebratory meal Sally and Donald shared when their success came together). Donald races through security at the airport but it's too late, as he sees Claybrook's airplane pulling away from the terminal.

Three middle-aged men who live in the manor and the surrounding area fall in love with her: a 50-year-old gloomy widower Urbenin (Leonid Markov), an even more senior in age but youthful and lighthearted Count Karneev (Kirill Lavrov) and the stately, handsome, 40-year-old court investigator Kamyshev (Oleg Yankovsky). Olga wanting to escape poverty marries the nobleman Urbenin without love. On the day of her wedding she runs away from the celebration and declares her love to Kamyshev but refuses to leave with him.

The opening shot introduces the audience to the themes the film will later elaborate. Michael Goddard's The Cinema of Ra\u00fal Ruiz: Impossible Cartographies poses that this film demonstrates the exploration of cinema's power of \u201csimulacral repetition,\u201d the ability of cinema to simulate images that extend beyond the power of repetition where repeated images build upon themselves. Or, as David Heinemann puts it, film \"demonstrates how visual signs draw on, and generate other signs. Hypothesis, with its inclusion of multiple forms of reproduction, exhibits this cinematic power.\nThe remaining scenes center around an art collector participating in a mockumentary style of interviews from a disembodied interviewer who the audience never sees. Through a large 19th-century baroque-style house and its grounds, the camera follows the collector as he guides the interviewer. The collector has six of seven canvasses by a fictional 19th-century painter called Fred\u00e9ric Tonnerre (a reference to Klossowski's short story about a painter of the same name). No one knows what was in the fourth painting of the sequence because it was stolen. His quest is to recreate the missing painting through a series of connections between the other six in order to ultimately discover the meaning of the series in its entirety. To achieve this, he hires models, acquires props and rigs lighting in order to bring each of the six surviving scenes to life as a tableaux vivants. The collector takes advantage of the tableaux vivants as a medium to experience aspects of the paintings that could only be materialized in three dimensions. He can then walk around each tableau, adjust lighting, move actors to different positions, and construct narratives intertextually between the tableaux. All this he does in speculation to search for the artist's intended meaning behind the set of Tonnerre's paintings. The tableaux vivants depict singular narratives that lie within each painting. Some narratives include the mythological characters of Diana and Actaeon, Knights of the Templar playing chess, a scandal among Parisian nobility, and an occult ceremony involving a sacrifice similar to that of St Sebastian.\nIn each case the collector discerns strong sexual currents flowing between the characters, both heterosexual and homosexual. He also recites the incredibly complicated plot of the novel in which the paintings were primarily conceived. As the collector explains the multitude of threads connecting each painting, the disembodied narrator questions the collector's pedantic conclusions. The collector stubbornly presses on with his investigation despite the narrator's critique. Throughout the film the collector makes many claims regarding the connections between each tableau. More significantly, he thinks traces of an esoteric cult of the Baphomet are hidden in secret codes within the pictures. Yet, without the missing painting any overall answer eludes him, and the collector is left asking more questions than when he'd begun. He travels back through the gallery toward the exit, slowly walking past the tableaux vivants which are now entangled and sprawled throughout the gallery. The actors playing the characters in the tableaux are having trouble keeping still. Some blink and some begin to lose their balance. The collector exits through the back door of the gallery and the film ends while the camera resides in the gallery.", "tmdb_id": 88034}, "751724": {"title": "I Spit on Your Grave", "plot": "Short story writer Jennifer Hills lives in Manhattan and rents an isolated cottage in Kent, Connecticut near the Housatonic River in the Litchfield County countryside to write her first novel.

She awakens the next morning to discover her boyfriend, Geoffrey Howell, acting cold and distant and dropping nondescript debris in one of many garbage trucks that will become ubiquitous later on. Driscoll's colleague, Matthew Bennell, advises her to visit psychiatrist David Kibner, who is giving a presentation of his new book. As Elizabeth and Matthew drive to the bookstore, a hysterical civilian warns them of danger before being pursued by a mob, killed in a hit and run and surrounded by emotionless onlookers. At the presentation, Kibner skillfully sows doubt in Elizabeth and another woman about their shared misgivings concerning their respective partners. Meanwhile, Jack Bellicec, an aspiring writer and friend of Matthew, calls Matthew to investigate when a deformed body resembling Jack is found in his wife Nancy's mud parlor. Matthew goes to Elizabeth to warn her, but discovers a semi-formed duplicate of her. Matthew rescues Elizabeth and alerts the police, but the duplicates of Jack and Elizabeth disappear before their arrival.\nElizabeth deduces that the flowers are involved and examines it at the health department, failing to find records of it, while Matthew unsuccessfully attempts to alert several government agencies.

Matthew and his friends nearly incur the same fate in their sleep that night. Matthew calls the police, but realizes that the department has been duplicated. Matthew destroys his own clone with a hoe before escaping with the others. The \"Pod People\" \u2013 extraterrestrials emerging from later-stage pods and taking the forms and memories of sleeping humans as the originals crumble to ashes \u2013 set off in pursuit of Matthew's group.

Matthew recognizes and unsuccessfully tries to wake Harry, a homeless busker lying asleep with his dog next to a mature pod. Matthew and Elizabeth take refuge in the health department, where they take a large dose of speed to remain awake.

The previous dose of speed enables Matthew to escape with Elizabeth after killing Jack's double and locking Kibner's in a refrigerated room.\nMatthew and Elizabeth reunite with Nancy, who has learned to evade the Pod People through hiding her emotions. The tactic works until Elizabeth screams at the sight of a dog-human duplicate amalgam (produced by Matthew's kick to the pod next to Harry and his dog) and their cover is blown. They separate from Nancy in their escape and board a truck delivering plants to Pier 70, where Pod People are processing them.\nThey hide near the pier and Matthew declares his love for Elizabeth while trying to keep her awake. He hears music from a nearby ship and scouts the area, only to discover the ship being loaded with pods to send overseas to other widely populated cities.

When he visits his sister Martha, she is watching wrestling. She tells Jacob he should leave, and that he would only get nightmares from the frightening wrestlers. When he asks Emma and Noah if he can join in on their game of Child Power, they tell him that he is too little to play. When he enters the kitchen, he asks his mother if he can help with dinner, but once again he is told that he is too small. Finally, Jacob visits his father in the living room, where he is reading a newspaper. Jacob expresses his disappointment that he is too small to help and play, and Jacob's father suggests that he travel to the store down the street and buy some chocolate ice cream.\nJacob leaves for the corner store and passes a policeman on his way inside. Inside he sees adults looming over him. He sees a man holding a fish, a woman holding a bird, and a man holding a lollipop. Jacob approaches the store owner, Mr. Cooper, and asks for \"two quarts of chocolate ice cream please, two quarts of chocolate ice cream please.\" Mr. Cooper is taken aback by Jacob's odd behaviour and begins to tease the boy. The policeman enters the store and joins in on the fun. Mr. Cooper demands that Jacob be charged with insulting an adult. The policeman agrees and pulls out his pad of paper, pretending to write the charge down. Jacob panics and runs from the store. The policeman runs after him and tries to explain that he and Mr. Cooper were only joking, but Jacob is already too far away. Jacob runs to a park and hides under a pile of fallen leaves, where he eventually falls asleep.\nWhen Jacob wakes up, he is in a jail cell. The policeman from the store comes into the cell and introduces Jacob's lawyer, Mr. Loser. When Jacob walks into the court, he is surrounded by screaming adults. The judge sits in front of him and is angry and rude to the boy. He says that offenses such as Jacob's cannot be taken lightly, as they may lead to bigger crimes in the future. Jacob pleads innocent, and the judge tells him that his plea is very inconsiderate because it is a busy court. The jury finds Jacob guilty and sentences him to \"\u2026two months, two days, two hours, two minutes in the darkest dungeons of prison.\"  Suddenly, a voice from the back of the room yells, \"I appeal this verdict\". Exciting music begins to play and the adults in the room scream, hide, and faint. Child Power enters the room, portrayed by Jacob's siblings, Emma and Noah. They are introduced as \"The Intrepid Shapiro\" and \"The Fearless O\u2019Toole\".  The judge is afraid of the two children, and nervously tells them that Jacob's sentence has already been passed. Child Power agrees but remind the judge that cruelty to children is against the law. They warn the judge that if they hear of any cruelty in the prison, then he will be hearing from them. Jacob leaves the court room only to find his siblings waiting for him in his cell. They give him a jewel shaped tracking device, and ask for his help. He promises to contact them if he senses any child cruelty in the prison, and Child Power leaves him in the cell.\nMaster Fish and Mistress Fowl take Jacob from his cell and lead him to the prison. They have similar faces to the people that Jacob saw when he was in the store. As they walk towards the prison they tell Jacob scary stories and point out the smog and crocodiles that block the way to the prison's island. When Jacob gets to the prison, he is introduced the fearsome warden, The Hooded Fang. The warden reads Jacob's sentence and sends him to the deepest and darkest cell in the prison. The Hooded Fang tells Jacob that he hates children. He says that when he was a wrestler, he was feared by everyone. During one match, a child pointed at him and laughed, telling the audience that the wrestler was not scary \u2013 only funny. After this incident, the Hooded Fang was unable to fight, because everyone around him would laugh him out of the stadium. Jacob apologizes to the Hooded Fang after hearing his story, telling him that he seems like a nice man. The warden is furious, as he wants everyone to think of him as mean and scary, and sends Jacob to his cell. As Jacob passes by the other cells, he notices that the children's skin is gray in colour. They beg Master Fish and Mistress Fowl for food, but are given only stale bread and moldy apples. When Jacob reaches his cell, he finds some candy and a note that says, \"You have a friend\".Jacob is woken up the next morning by a man in a large fur coat. He introduces himself as Mister Fox, the head guard, and takes Jacob to the shower room to give him his new uniform. When they enter the shower room, Jacob realizes that it is a freezer. After his cold shower, Mister Fox inspects behind Jacob's ears to make sure that he is clean and finds the jewel that Child Power gave him. Mister Fox takes the tracking device from him, thinking that it is a precious jewel. Jacob is then taken to a party in the dining hall. He sees all of the gray children and sits down with them. He asks them why they are gray and they tell him that it is because the smog hides the sun. The Hooded Fang enters the room and all of the children start screaming. Jacob's new friends tell him that he must pretend to be afraid as well, or else the warden will be angry. The Hooded Fang presents Mister Fox with a \"Rotten Child Award\" and says that he must go to the city and complete some undercover work. He wants Mister Fox to visit toy stores and sabotage all of the toys. Jacob is worried because Mister Fox has the tracking device, and if he leaves the prison, then Child Power will not be able to find the children. Jacob feels that by losing the tracking device, he has failed everyone.\nChild Power is alerted that the tracking device has traveled to a toy shop in the city. They decide to go and investigate and find Mister Fox sabotaging the toys. They ask him where he found the jewel, and Mister Fox lies and tells the children that he found it in a fish. Child Power is devastated, because they think that Jacob drowned while trying to escape and was then eaten by a fish. The film then cuts back to the prison, where Jacob is working in the smog making workshop. He tells his friends that he has been receiving many notes with candy attached, telling him to tremble when the Hooded Fang is around.\nThe Hooded Fang talks to his mother about Jacob. He tells her that no matter what he does he cannot get the small boy to cower or scream in fear. He travels to Jacob's cell and asks him questions in an attempt to break his spirit. He tries to get Jacob to say numbers other than two, but Jacob finds ways around it. Jacob tells the Hooded Fang that \"he too can be a two-two\", making the retired wrestler more and more frustrated until he eventually threatens to feed Jacob to the sharks.  When Jacob is in the dining hall with his friends, he tells them about a plan for escape. He has written a note for Child Power and thinks that the Hooded Fang will deliver the letter for him.\nThe Hooded Fang brings Jacob his last meal before he is to be fed to the sharks. He tried to get Jacob to scream, but Jacob says that he knows the warden's secret. Jacob tells him that he knows the Hooded Fang is not evil. He thinks that The Hooded Fang is the one who has been leaving Jacob notes and candy, because they always appear after the warden leaves Jacob's cell. Jacob says that he will hug and kiss him unless they make a deal. After several hugs, the Hooded Fang agrees to deliver the letter for Jacob. Child Power receives the letter and sets out to find Mister Fox. They battle Mister Fox in the toy store, but eventually The Intrepid Shapiro and The Fearless O\u2019Toole get the better of him. They tell him that they will spare him if he promises to take them to the prison. When they reach the water surrounding the island, Child Power poisons the crocodiles. Mister Fox teases Child Power, poking fun at Jacob's size and telling them that he could never actually help. Jacob's siblings stand up for him, telling Mister Fox that Jacob isn\u2019t too small to help. The children in the prison rebel against the guard by destroying the smog machine and blinding the adults with the sun. The only adult that doesn\u2019t cower is the Hooded Fang, because as Jacob predicted, he is just a big kid. The Hooded Fang tries to scare the children, but they only laugh.\nWhen Child Power reaches the prison, Jacob tells them what happened. Child Power points out to Jacob that he is no longer repeating what he says. Jacob realizes that people are finally listening to what he says the first time.

Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse (in an unsubtitled alien language) with their leader, who orders them to return to Earth and recover the cannon: it is implied that the aliens left the cannon and pendant behind under the presumption that no other human would be able to use them as the green-skinned man had. Meanwhile, Billy and Kathy attend a pool party with other teens, where Chuck makes an unwanted advance on Kathy, resulting in Billy fighting with Chuck and Froggy.

Genres covered include blues, rock and roll, New Orleans R&B, Tin Pan Alley pop, folk, and rock. Further genres are explored in segments filmed later on a sound stage with Emmylou Harris (country) and the Staple Singers (soul and gospel).\nThe film begins with The Band performing the last song of the evening, their cover version of the Marvin Gaye hit \"Don't Do It\", as an encore. The film then flashes back to the beginning of the concert, and follows it more or less chronologically. The Band is backed by a large horn section and performs many of its hit songs, including \"Up on Cripple Creek\", \"Stage Fright\", and \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down\".\nThe live songs are interspersed with studio segments and interviews conducted by director Martin Scorsese in which the Band's members reminisce about the group's history. Robertson talks about Hudson joining the band on the condition that the other members pay him $10 a week each for music lessons. The classically trained Hudson could then tell his parents that he was a music teacher instead of merely a rock-and-roll musician. Robertson also describes the surreal experience of playing in a burnt-out nightclub owned by Jack Ruby.\nManuel recalls that some of the early names for The Band included \"The Honkies\", and \"The Crackers\". Because they were simply referred to as \"the band\" by Dylan and their friends and neighbors in Woodstock, New York, they figured that was just what they would call themselves.\nDanko is seen giving Scorsese a tour of The Band's Shangri-La studio, and he plays a recording of \"Sip the Wine\", a track from his then-forthcoming 1977 solo album Rick Danko.\nA recurring theme brought up in the interviews with Robertson is that the concert marks an end of an era for The Band, that after 16 years on the road, the time had come for a change. \"That's what The Last Waltz is - 16 years on the road.

They come from totally different backgrounds and can hardly speak the other's language. When Balu and Sapna admit their love, there is chaos in their homes as they face an unexpected test of their love.\nThe movie begins with an old, ruined building near the beautiful beach of Vizag. The dilapidated walls of the building are covered with many names, but two names stand apart from the rest---Balu and Sapna.\nBalu is a happy, carefree young man who belongs to a Tamil family. He resigns his job after his boss scolds him and he returns to his home in Vizag. His orthodox Tamilian father is always at loggerheads with the Telugu-speaking neighbour family. The family has a beautiful daughter named Sapna, a college student.\nWhile being followed on her way home by a creepy bookstore clerk (who'd earlier shown her a book of nude photos), Sapna sees Balu jogging and starts a one-way conversation with him. Seeing this, the bookstore clerk retreats. Sapna thanks Balu for pretending to be her friend, but he reveals that he doesn't understand Telugu. Vasu wants to make friends with her. He tries to meet her later pretending his motorcycle has broken down but he crashes and ends up in the hospital. Impressed, Sapna sends him a gift: a ceremonial mask with her name on it and asking his name.\nDespite the nasty conflicts between their families, Vasu and Sapna fall deeply in love with each other. They get to know each other, experiencing the joy and innocence of first love. One day, however, Sapna fairly misunderstands Balu when he forcefully kisses her and is offended and breaks up with him. Despite Balu's efforts to make her understand his love, Sapna ignores him and remains angry. A week later, Sapna finds Vasu awake all night looking at her window hoping that she would forgive him. Heartbroken at seeing him like that, Sapna forgives him and signals him by turning her room light off and on repeatedly.\nThey meet the next day and Sapna expresses her love for Balu by kissing his hand. The lovers unite and visit the beaches, forts, waterfalls and scenic places of Goa. While returning home late at night, Balu's motorcycle runs out of petrol. They pose as a newly married couple and ask for a lift in a car. To their shock, Sapna's father is in the car and he takes her home immediately. Balu and Sapna keep meeting each other and fall in love even more.\nOne day when Sapna returns from college after meeting Balu, she finds the lewd bookstore clerk at her home. The man has secretly clicked pictures of her and Balu together and shown them to her parents. Burning with rage, Sapna's mother forbids her from seeing Balu and accompanies her everywhere. Heartbroken, Balu makes a plan and stealthily meets Sapna during her college lunch break. They go to a hotel for lunch and Balu pauses the elevator halfway to spend some time with Sapna. He sings a love song for her using his broken Telugu. This leads to an amused crowd at the hotel lift listening in. They are reprimanded by the guard as they exit.\nBalu and Sapna's families find out. In anger, they lock up Sapna at home and Balu's father scolds him. Despite the opposition, Balu boldly goes and meets Sapna in her home in the presence of her parents and expresses his love for her. Sapna's mother screams and claims that Balu is ruining their family honor.\nFinally, both the families meet and Balu and Sapna affirm their love for each other. Their families agree to allow them to marry on one condition \u2013 that they separate from each other for one year without any contact or communication. Afterwards, if they still want to be together, they can get married. Balu and Sapna reluctantly agree to the contract.\nBalu goes to Hyderabad for a job, while Sapna stays behind in Vizag. During their year of separation, Vasu writes a letter every day to Sapna, in which he expresses his pain and love, but doesn't send it to her because of the contract. He learns to speak Telugu fluently from a young widow named Sandhya. To drown his pain of separation, he also learns classical dance from Sandhya.\nOn the other hand, Sapna visits all the places where she and Balu used to go which brings back old memories. She also visits a rocky hill by the beach, where their names 'Balu' and 'Sapna' are painted on the highest rock. In order to make Sapna forget Balu, her mother destroys the cassette tape that he had given her. The mother also burns her only photo of Vasu which Sapna crumbles into her tea and drinks in defiance. In response, Sapna writes Balu's name on every inch of her bedroom wall, making her family even more angry.\nSapna goes on a college trip to Mangalore, where her mother sends her cousin Chakram to spy on her. Chakram wants to marry Sapna, but she doesn't like him. Coincidentally, Balu also comes to Mangalore due to a job assignment. He spots Sapna and follows her to her hotel room, but bumps into Chakram, who lies that he and Sapna are married. A shocked Balu meets Sapna's college friends and asks about her, but they mistakenly say Chakram and Sapna are soon to be married.\nBalu is heartbroken and proposes to Sandhya, thinking that Sapna was unfaithful to him. Sandhya is surprised but accepts and fixes their wedding date. Later she finds in his room all the letters he wrote to Sapna, and discovers the truth. Sandhya goes to Vizag and meets Sapna and learns that she is not married and is still waiting for Balu. Seeing their true love, Sandhya sacrifices her love and decides to unite Balu and Sapna.\nShe tells the truth to Balu and cancels their wedding, urging him to go to his beloved Sapna as their one-year contract was completed. Sandhya's older brother hears that the wedding is cancelled and thinks that Balu abandoned his sister. In a drunken, angry state, he phones his criminal friend in Vizag and asks him to 'completely get rid' of Balu.\nWhen Balu arrives back in Vizag, and is about to meet Sapna in their favorite beach spot, Sandhya's older brother's criminal friend and a gang brutally beat up Balu. Meanwhile, Sapna is heading to the beach to meet Vasu. The lascivious bookstore clerk tries to attack her, Sapna tries to escape him and falls from the second floor. The bookstore clerk seeing her almost dead from the fall, still violently rapes hers! Sapna and Balu meet after the clerk and the goons flee. However, Balu is badly injured.

The narrative is strictly chronological and avoids the digressions required to mirror the novel's structure. Many of the novel's minor characters do not appear or are combined. For example, the role of the Th\u00e9nardiers is reduced to a scene in which Valjean ransoms Cosette from them.\nThe film begins with Jean Valjean's theft and then lingers in the Toulon prison where his mistreatment is detailed under the gaze of Javert, who witnesses Valjean's amazing feat of strength in rescuing a man crushed under a boulder. Valjean escapes when saving another convict who had fallen while repairing some battlements. Struggling to survive, he encounters a kindly Bishop, who feeds and shelters him. He steals silver plates from the Bishop. When Valjean is arrested and brought back to the Bishop, the Bishop pretends the silver pieces were a gift, dismisses the police, and gives Valjean two silver candlesticks in addition to what he had originally stolen. Valjean is overcome. The Bishop tells him he has purchased his soul for God and that his life will now be different.\nValjean becomes a prosperous businessman using techniques for the manufacture of black beads that he learned in Toulon and becomes mayor of his town under the name Madeleine. Javert arrives to serve as chief of the local police. He thinks he recognizes Madeleine and notes his use of the Toulon manufacturing method. Madeleine rescues the beggar Fantine, who recounts her history in a few sentences, when Javert is about to punish her, and Javert witnesses Madeleine rescue a man trapped beneath a cart, another astonishing feat of strength. Javert denounces Madeleine to his superiors, but before they can confirm Madeleine is actually Valjean, another man is arrested and charged in Arras with being the escaped convict Valjean. Javert confesses his actions to Madeleine and asks to be dismissed from his position. Madeleine refuses his request and goes to Arras where he wins the release of the falsely accused man by identifying himself as Valjean.\nValjean returns to his town and tries to help the dying Fantine while he awaits arrest. He learns how the Th\u00e9nardiers are caring for her daughter Cosette. Javert insists on arresting him, Fantine dies, and Valjean escapes. He ransoms Cosette from the Th\u00e9nardiers and gives her a doll. Living in Paris with Cosette, Valjean escapes from Javert, who is directing police searches of the district where he is living, by climbing a wall, landing in the garden of a Paris convent. The gardener is the man he rescued from being crushed under a cart, who agrees to pretend he and Valjean are brothers and recommends him to the nuns as a gardener. Cosette attends the convent school. When she completes her education and has become a young woman, Valjean decides they should leave the convent's cloistered premises so she can experience the world.\nValjean and Cosette are strolling in a public garden and pause to listen to radicals denounce the government. Cosette and Marius, one of the radical group though not a speaker, see one another and their eyes lock. Marius pays the urchin Gavroche to tail them and report their address to him. Marius soon romances Cosette through the entrance gate to their home. Valjean sees this and abruptly announces to Cosette that they must leave for England. When Marius learns this, he visits his grandfather, Gillenormand, who detests his radical activities, to ask for money. Instead his grandfather suggests he make the woman he wants to marry his mistress and Marius, repulsed by the suggestion, leaves.\nThe radicals have created a barricade and are exchanging gunfire with the military. Gavroche identifies a man on the radical side of the barricade as the undercover police infiltrator, Javert. Enjolras arrests Javert and promises to shoot him if the barricade falls to the government's forces. Marius sends Gavroche with a message for Cosette, which Valjean reads. Valjean goes to the barricade and tries to talk Marius into abandoning the radicals. Gavroche is shot by the soldiers and dies. Valjean asks Enjolras for the privilege of killing Javert, which Enjolras grants him. Valjean instead releases him, repeating the words of the Bishop that his soul was once purchased for God. When Marius is wounded, Valjean escapes carrying his limp body with him through the sewers. Javert pursues him there and confronts him about their earlier encounter. Javert prepares to kill Valjean but suddenly disappears into the darkness of the sewers. He commits suicide by jumping into the Seine.

Victor is introduced by means of voice-over narration (Jesper Hoffmeyer) as a young artist of Jewish descent who has shunned his heritage. He is described as having arrived at the realisation that he is alone, doubting humanity's willingness to extend help to one another. It is further narrated that during a previous period in his life he had been referred to as a wimp, which has subsequently resulted in a fear of weakness and being incapable. Victor believes that he must keep his mind busy and therefore decides to cultivate his love for Eliza, a young nurse he encounters during his stay at a sanatorium.\nWhilst in residence at the sanatorium, Victor observes the intimate friendship between Eliza and her female friend, also a nurse. It is suggested they are lovers. It is ambiguous as to which nurse is specifically Eliza, which is further enunciated by a recurring voice-over that states \u2018I am not Eliza\u2019. Victor is portrayed as exhibiting a sense of dependence upon the nurses; in one scene he waits upon one nurse to dry and swaddle him in a towel following a shower, and in the following scene he uses a wheelchair. He is wheeled through the gardens of the sanatorium by one of the nurses, potentially Eliza, towards whom he expresses a tenderness by clasping her hand. Victor and the accompanying nurse pass a gardener and a woman painting on a large canvas, both of whom Victor greets with a smile. Arriving at a tree, the nurse gathers handfuls of blossoms, which she begins to gently sprinkle onto Victor's hair. She is interrupted by the call of another nurse, Eliza's friend. Leaving Victor seated in his chair, the nurses walk into the distance, with Eliza's friend retrieving from her pocket a condom, prompting laughter from both. Victor looks on with a forlorn expression. The sky becomes clouded; the camera tracks along the ground, displaying the painter's canvas and easel as scattered along the grass, with the painter nowhere to be seen. Eliza dashes back to Victor, who is still seated, and wheels him along, harshly dusting the blossoms from his head in the process.\nVictor is shown in a household setting, presumably following his period in the sanatorium. He looks on at a woman, one of the former nurses who is now dressed in masculine attire. The narrator describes that Victor had studied women and had come to the conclusion that women always despise that which is weak, driving him to dream of strengthening himself. This narration is accompanied by a scene in which a young child is thrashed and locked in a room by an older, unknown woman; the woman, situated on the other side of the locked door, masturbates against the backdrop of the child's distressed cries.\nReturning to the antics of Victor, Victor dons a Nazi military uniform whilst sat before a tabletop mirror. In contrast to the masculine overtones of the garment he applies mascara to his eyes and powder to his face. In the following scene he intensely studies the former nurse brushing her hair and applying cream to her face; as she hums the melody of Lili Marleen, Victor runs his hands along the outline of the head and shoulders, never directly touching her skin. Following this, Victor is shown outside in a derelict urban setting, adjusting his trousers. A doll's pram overturned in the background, and it is indicated by the narrator that Victor has assaulted a young girl.\nEliza, Eliza's friend and Victor attend a cinema screening. While Eliza and her friend sit side by side, an empty chair separates Victor from the couple. The film displays a male and female couple in the midst of an incomprehensible dialogue; while the male figure becomes increasingly animated and emotional, the female figure remains coolly composed and disaffected by the male figure's erratic gesticulations. Eliza and her friend exchange amused glances, while Victor, who sports painted nails, gazes intensely at the screen whilst tightly holding a furled flyer featuring a painting of a man. Once the film concludes, Victor is left alone in the auditorium.\nVictor is shown wearing female attire, applying make-up once more, gazing into his tabletop mirror. Running his hands over the contours of his face, he looks into his own reflection for a moment before approaching a nearby birdcage. He removes the bird inside, a pigeon, and rings its neck until the head is removed. He returns to the mirror, dabbing his finger into the head's open wound, using the blood as rouge for his cheeks. In an abrupt change of pace, the next scene shows Victor running frantically down an enclosed street, collapsing as he reaches a dead end. He is then shown at the seashore, perched upon the edge of a pier. The narrator describes how Victor fantasises a hand caressing his own. Victor becomes briefly lost in his imagination, believing a hand to touch his own, only to realise that he is daydreaming and is actually alone.\nBack in the household Victor suspends himself from the ceiling, giving the impression of having hung himself. His female companion, one of the former-nurses, enters the house and eventually arrives at the room in which Victor is hanging. She is not startled and conversely strolls towards the window behind Victor before departing. Infuriated by her response, Victor cuts himself free and flings off the harness that had been supporting him. He runs from the room.\nThe following scenes show Victor descending into greater anxiety and violence. His sleep is interrupted by distress. He sits for long, inert periods besides an empty canvas. It is implied that he is so bothered by the song of the birds outside of his atelier that he hammers them by their wings against a wall and sets them alight. Finally, he is shown holding a gun to his female companion. She remains composed, as she turns her back to Victor and extends her hand across the wall. She turns back to face him and tells Victor that she cherishes him the way he is, that he should give her a chance, and that it would be foolish for him to shoot her. She asks him why he has never wished to be caressed. Victor's hand tremors and he throws the gun aside. The camera cuts to a wide shot, revealing that the female companion is not clothed except for trousers and a tie; she presents Victor with a whip, which she begins to coat with a viscous substance followed by a white, granular powder. Watching intently, Victor begins to undress.\nClasping his head and body, Victor walks down a mostly empty street. He walks with a pained gait, which increasingly falters. An elderly woman collapses in the distance and a crowd begins to gather, although they do not actually help her but instead stare at her body. Victor remains unacknowledged as he staggers on, almost collapsing entirely. The scenes fades to an image of a nude Victor, collapsed in front of the large canvas, drawn-out hand prints running down the length of the canvas.\nIn the final scenes of the film Victor is shown driving a hearse to an orchid nursery. As he drives, an English language commercial discouraging smoking plays from the hearse's radio. After removing a formal jacket and bowtie, revealing that he is wearing gardener overalls, he retrieves a cap from inside of the coffin situated in the back of the hearse and then attends to work in the nursery.\nThe narrator states that Victor truly cherished Eliza, to which a female voice responds \u2018No, not Eliza\u2019. The film concludes with a priest driving a wooden cross into the ground.", "tmdb_id": 108799}, "13632712": {"title": "An Ordinary Miracle (1978 film)", "plot": "The protagonist of the film, the Wizard (Oleg Yankovsky), invents a fairy tale to amuse himself and his wife (Irina Kupchenko).

Now, the young man returns to the Wizard's house where he meets a beautiful girl (Yevgeniya Simonova), and they immediately fall in love with each other. To his dismay, she turns out to be a princess \u2013 the Wizard made it so that a king (Yevgeny Leonov) who was just passing by with his daughter and his suite felt a sudden urge to stop by the estate. When the Princess, clueless about the young man's origin, wants to kiss him, he flees in horror.\nThe Princess hurries after him, dressed as a boy. They meet in a tavern called \"Emilia\", but the Bear, unable to recognize the Princess, summons her to a duel. However, when the Princess cries out \"Daddy\" during the battle, the Bear realizes that she deceived him.\nIn anger, he goes to the innkeeper (Yury Solomin) and begs to be to locked up, as the tavern is covered with snow and it is impossible to get out. The innkeeper gives him the key to a room. He draws his attention to one of the court ladies and recognizes in her his first love Emilia, in whose honor he named the inn. The innkeeper and Emilia decide to help the quarreled lovers.\nThe Princess locks herself in a room on the second floor of the inn and promises to shoot anyone who would come to her. The King orders to draw lots and the lot comes out for the court Minister Administrator (Andrei Mironov).

Desperate, his love taken away from him, the Bear decides to tell all about the princess kiss that would turn him into a beast, but the Princess rejects him.\nThe wedding procession leaves. The Hunter (Vsevolod Larionov) and the Bear remain in the tavern. The Wizard appears and tells the Bear that he was disappointed in his behavior. He calls the Bear a coward. In the opinion of the Wizard the Bear should have kissed the princess. The fact that he didn't do that shows that he does not love the princess so much as to sacrifice his human form. The Bear and the Hunter make an agreement under which, if ever the Bear is to kiss the Princess and to turn into an animal, the Hunter will kill him.\nExactly one year passes by. The country is actually ruled by the Administrator instead of the King. The Princess is slowly dying of longing for the Bear. The Wizard intentionally does not let the Bear in the country and into his house, because he thinks that the tale with a sad end has much more to teach people, and stories with a happy ending are just for children.\nAs the Princess feels death coming, the Bear appears in the house of the Wizard. The Hunter is aiming the gun at the Bear. The Bear kisses the princess, but does not turn into a bear, and stays a man. The Wizard explains this paradox to be an ordinary miracle.\nThe characters leave the Wizard's house that turns out to be all scenery.

Ranga is keen to leave Kalyani, while Kalyani suggests they live now as if they have divorced without really divorcing.

Puff then helps Jackie make a boat using things in Jackie's room, such as string, sealing wax, and the frame of his bed.\nThey set out onto the ocean, where they meet a boat filled with kings and princes in the shape of cards. Afterward, Jackie says he was afraid of pirates after hearing about them. They then run into Very Long John Black and Bluebeard Kidd, a giant pirate who takes them to his island.

Jackie challenges (with a verse from Billy Boy) Very Long John to bake a cherry pie, which he does, and subsequently expresses that he always wanted to be a baker, but never believed he could do it and was afraid he could not change from being a pirate. Jackie prompts him to make this change, and Very Long John expresses his gratitude to Jackie and Puff.\nThey continue their journey until they reach the starless sky, where jealous clouds block out the brightness of the stars. One of the stars falls, and Puff instructs Jackie to take the small star to the sky with the boat, which Puff gives butterfly wings. In order for the ship to fly, Puff has to get out of the boat, leaving Jackie alone to face his fears. Jackie then returns the star to the sky, brightening the sky. Puff rewards Jackie with a medal for bravery.\nEventually they reach Honalee, which, instead of a paradise, turns out to be a gloomy place. This is revealed to be the work of living sneezes that out of depression made the place gloomy to fit their mood. Puff then orders Jackie to leave, as this is no place for him. After that Puff sadly walks to his cave, realizing he was not brave enough to defeat the sneezes. He is then reunited with Jackie, who returns with Very Long John and his chicken soup to cure the living sneezes of their colds, making them happy. They then return Honalee to its happy glory by singing.\nOnce this is done, Puff and Jackie go back to Jackie's room and return Jackie to his body. Puff tells Jackie that thanks to his creativity he is now a brave boy and leaves, saying he will return to visit. Jackie's parents come into the room to find Jackie happy and talking again.

The band quickly succeeds with hit records and sold-out shows.\nMeanwhile, villainous Mr. Mustard (Frankie Howerd) and his henchman the Brute drive to Heartland in their computer- and robot(Polythene Pam)-equipped van. Mustard receives orders from the mysterious FVB to steal the magical instruments from City Hall and distribute them among FVB and its affiliates. Without the instruments, Heartland\u2014now under Mustard's control\u2014quickly degenerates into a hotbed of vice and urban decay. Strawberry takes an early morning bus to Hollywood (\"She's Leaving Home\") to tell the band. Mustard, who has a crush on Strawberry, follows. In Hollywood, the band and Strawberry steal Mustard's van and use its computer to locate the stolen instruments. They recover the cornet from the deranged, money-driven anti-aging specialist Dr. Maxwell Edison (Steve Martin), and the tuba from mind-controlling cult leader Father Sun (Alice Cooper). They find the drum still in Mustard's van. However, the computer malfunctions before they can locate the final missing instrument\u2013the saxophone\u2013which remains in the hands of FVB.\nAs Heartland continues to deteriorate, Dougie and the band convince B.D. to organize a benefit concert to save the town (\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!)\". Dougie and Lucy, who have bonded over their shared love of money, plot to run off with the show's proceeds (\"You Never Give Me Your Money\"). They hide bags of money in Mustard's van while Billy, Strawberry, and the Hendersons are watching Earth, Wind & Fire perform at the benefit (\"Got to Get You into My Life\"). Mustard and the Brute suddenly arrive and take back the van, which also contains the recovered instruments. They also kidnap Strawberry, with whom Mustard has fallen in love from afar (\"When I'm Sixty-Four\"). Mustard drives off with Dougie, Lucy, Strawberry, and the money hidden on board. Billy and the Hendersons see the van leave and pursue it in the town's hot air balloon.\nMustard drives to FVB's headquarters, where the Future Villain Band plans to take over the world. This Orwellian hard-rock group (Aerosmith) contrasts the wholesomeness of Sgt. Pepper's band. FVB is described as \"the evil force that would poison young minds, pollute the environment, and subvert the democratic process\"; they perform in militaristic uniforms on a high platform stage made to look like stacks of money, accompanied by uniformed youth twirling flags. To turn Strawberry into a \"mindless groupie\", FVB chains her up onstage while the band plays \"Come Together\" and lead singer (Steven Tyler) fondles her. Dougie and Lucy are also tied up and forced to watch. Billy and the Hendersons arrive and engage FVB in hand-to-hand combat. The singer is thrown off the stage to his death, but unfortunately, so is Strawberry.\nThe town of Heartland, now cleaned up and the instruments returned, holds an elaborate funeral for Strawberry (\"Golden Slumbers\"/\"Carry That Weight\"). The depressed Billy attempts to get Strawberry off his mind (\"The Long and Winding Road\"); when he cannot, the Hendersons worry for him (\"A Day in the Life\"). Billy attempts suicide by jumping from a rooftop. Before he can hit the ground, in a form of Deus ex machina, the Sgt. Pepper weather vane atop City Hall comes to life (Billy Preston). Wielding magical lightning bolts, Pepper catches Billy (\"Get Back\"). Pepper dances through the town square, transforming Mustard and the Brute into a bishop and a monk. Mustard's van is transformed into a Volkswagen Beetle. Dougie and Lucy are transformed into a priest and a nun. Strawberry is restored to life, and happily embraces Billy. Sgt. Pepper transforms the band members' mourning suits into shiny new uniforms.\nIn the finale, the cast appear with numerous celebrities in a tribute to the original Beatles album cover.", "tmdb_id": 36759}, "52764133": {"title": "Shadows of a Hot Summer", "plot": "The film is set in the 1940s after the end of World War II.

Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood $2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before.\nThe murder is arraigned to take place in a graveyard outside town where Barrett is expected to arrive. Blood lies in wait until a carriage eventually pulls up. Its occupant is a young boy however, not the older land baron he had expected, who enters the graveyard carrying a funeral wreath. Blood then sees several men who ambush the child, but before they can kill him, Blood shoots the assassins and rides off with the boy. Blood learns the boy's name is Thomas Barrett, Jr. (Sven Valsecchi), the son of his intended victim Richard Barrett. The elder Barrett has been dead for several years and Thomas, Jr. has since been cared for by his uncle Thomas Barrett, Sr. (Ettore Manni). Angered at being cheated out of his revenge, Blood leaves the boy stranded in the hillside with only a knife and a blanket.\nBack at the Barrett homestead, Thomas's older sister Margaret (Cinzia Monreale) is upset over her brother's disappearance. Thomas, Sr. discusses the search with Turner, who is revealed to be the ranch foreman, and is decided by the land baron that Roy Blood is the kidnapper and posts a $5,000 bounty. Meanwhile, Blood is rejoined by Snake, who offers him a deal. Snake reveals that he took in Thomas, Jr. after he left and intends to ransom the boy back to the Barrett family. Blood is also informed that the bounty was a ploy used to kill himself and the boy, with Blood being blamed for the murder.\nBlood hides out at Shiba's whorehouse, and where Thomas, Jr. is looked after, while Shiba obtains information on the Barrett family. Using her feminine wiles, she is able to learn that after the death of Richard Barrett, his fortune was divided between his children and his brother. However, Thomas gambled away his half of the inheritance, while the family fortune was possessed by his children. The will provided that if Thomas, Jr. died, Margaret would inherit the entire fortune. It is presumed that is the motivating factor for Thomas Barrett, Sr. to marry his niece.\nThomas, Jr. is eventually spotted by Turner while visiting the whorehouse and Blood takes him to the San Jacinto monastery located several miles away. The gun-toting padre of the monastery promises to protect the boy while Blood goes after Turner. He eventually confronts Turner and his men at an abandoned farmhouse, where a shootout occurs and Blood kills Turner. But at the monastery, the bandit Garrincha and his gang have killed all the priests and taken Thomas, Jr., whom they plan to ransom for themselves. Blood is later arrested by the sheriff (Phillppe Hersent) who believes he is a member of Garrincha's band.\nThe bandit leader demands $10,000 for the safe return of the boy. Thomas, Sr., against the advice of the sheriff, agrees to pay the ransom and sends out a messenger named Fletcher (Donald O'Brien) to deliver the money to Garrincha's camp. The courier is murdered once he hands the money over to the bandits.\nWith the help of Margaret, Blood eventually escapes from the town jail and reunites with Snake to track down Garrincha. They finally find the bandit's hideout when Thomas, Jr. flies a kite over its location. Blood and Snake arrive to find Garrincha whipping the boy after discovering his ruse. A gun battle with Garrincha and his men results in the death of the bandit, but not before Snake is killed.\nBlood returns to the Barrett ranch with Thomas, Jr. and exposes his uncle's role in the kidnapping, revealing that Thomas, Sr. had planned with Turner to kill his niece and nephew so that he would gain the family inheritance. Garrincha was also part of the plan, Thomas, Sr. staging a false kidnapping and ransom payment to avert suspicion from himself, and had intended to kill Turner as well as Margaret once he married her.

Luke tells her that he does not know what happened. Malla contacts Saun Dann, a local trader. He tells her through a carefully worded message that Han and Chewbacca are on their way and should be arriving soon.\nMalla then attempts (unsuccessfully) to prepare a meal, the instructions of which are being aired via a local cooking show by an eccentric four-armed alien cook, Chef Gormaanda (Harvey Korman).\nSaun arrives with Life Day gifts for everyone, including a virtual reality fantasy program (featuring Diahann Carroll) for Itchy. Back on the Falcon, Chewbacca and Han have just come out of hyperspace not far from Kashyyyk. Han notices an increased Imperial presence, so they decide to land in an unguarded area to the north.\nAs they enter the atmosphere, Lumpy hears the roaring of the ship. Believing Han and Chewie might be arriving, Malla opens the door, but instead finds two stormtroopers and officers. The Imperials force their way into the house. An officer orders a search for Chewbacca.\nAs they search, Saun and the others attempt to distract them with food and Malla's music video box (which features a video by Jefferson Starship). When the music finishes, the head officer orders the search to continue. The head officer tells Malla to keep Lumpy busy while they search his room, so Lumpy (and the viewing audience) uses a viewscreen to watch a cartoon of his father's many adventures:\n\nDuring a search for a talisman, the Millennium Falcon crashes on the water moon of Panna with the main characters onboard. They run into Boba Fett, who saves Luke from a giant monster and claims to want to help the Rebels. They all board the Falcon, where Han has been infected by a mysterious sleeping virus caused by the talisman. Luke then contracts the virus as well. Fett and Chewie go into Panna City to get the cure. Once they get into the Imperial-occupied city, Fett instructs Chewie to stay behind\u2014so he can contact Darth Vader. On the Falcon, as C-3PO is caring for Han and Luke, R2-D2 intercepts the transmission between Vader and Fett. Evading the Imperials, Fett and Chewie return to the Falcon with the cure. After everyone recovers from the virus, they learn of Fett's true allegiances. He blasts away using his jetpack, promising they will meet again. The heroes head back to the Rebel base aboard the Falcon.\nLumpy works to create a translation device that will fool the Imperials into returning to their base by faking their commander's voice. To do so, he first must watch the manual for the device, being presented by a malfunctioning, incompetent robot (also played by Korman). While the Imperials are searching downstairs, the living room viewscreen activates, announcing that Tatooine is being put under curfew by the Empire because of \"subversive forces\".\nThe video is announced as required viewing for all Imperial forces and much of it features Ackmena (Bea Arthur) running the Mos Eisley cantina. Ackmena is approached by an admirer: Krelman, an amorous alien, who has misunderstood something she said to him recently. Ackmena announces last call, and upon being ignored, sings a farewell song.\nLumpy uses this opportunity to put his plan into motion, faking a repeated call for the Imperials to \"return to base\". They leave, but one stormtrooper stays behind and realizes that they were tricked. He finds Lumpy and destroys the machine, then chases Lumpy outside.\nHan and Chewbacca arrive. Chewie protects Lumpy as Han kills the stormtrooper. After they are reunited, an Imperial officer appears on the viewscreen, giving a general alert for the missing stormtrooper. Saun quickly responds that the trooper stole supplies and deserted. The danger averted, the family prepares to go to the festival at the great Tree of Life. They hold glowing orbs, and appear in space wearing red robes.Wookiees walk into a bright star and arrive at the Tree of Life, where many are gathered, including C-3PO and R2-D2. Luke, Leia, and Han also appear. Leia gives a short speech and sings a song in celebration. Chewie remembers his adventures during the events of the original film.

Akton and Stella escape by jumping into hyperspace. When they emerge, they discover an escape pod from the attacked starship, and in it, a sole disoriented survivor. Before they can escape, they are apprehended by the police, who have tracked their hyperspace trail.\nTried and convicted of piracy, they are each sentenced to life in prison on separate prison planets. Stella manages to escape from her prison, but Elle and Thor recapture her, only to inform her the authorities have canceled her sentence; she is taken to an orbiting ship, where she is reunited with Akton. They are contacted holographically by the Emperor of the Galaxy, who thanks them for recovering the starship survivor.\nHe informs them that Count Zarth Arn has a secret weapon of immense power hidden away on a planet somewhere. The Emperor orders Stella and Akton to find the Count's weapon. They are offered clemency if they help find two more missing escape pods as well as the mothership, one of which may contain the Emperor's only son. With Thor and Elle accompanying them, Stella and Akton set off on their quest.\nThey quickly arrive at the location Akton computes for the first escape pod. Stella and Elle take a shuttle from the spaceship and land near the pod on a sandy, rocky beach. There are no living survivors. Stella meets an Amazonian warrior tribe and is escorted to their underground fortress. On arrival, Elle is ambushed, shot and left for dead, and Stella is taken captive. Stella is taken before Amazon Queen Corelia, who is in league with Zarth Arn. Elle, revealed not to have died, makes his way to the throne room, taking Corelia hostage to secure Stella's release. They escape, but the queen activates a giant female robot which chases them until they are rescued by Akton and Thor.\nOn an uninhabited, frozen planet, Stella and Elle investigate the mothership crash site. As with the first crash site, they find no survivors. Upon their return to the ship, Thor, who has ambushed and apparently knocked out Akton, reveals that he is an agent of Zarth Arn. Thor locks Stella and Elle outside on the planet's surface, where the temperature drops thousands of degrees at night, but Elle is able to preserve Stella's life by using his energy to keep her heart going while they freeze over in the snow. Meanwhile, Akton revives and battles Thor, killing him and subsequently rescuing Elle and Stella.\nApproaching the planet of the third escape pod, their ship comes under attack from the same weapon seen at the beginning of the film, but Akton steers the ship through it, saving them. Stella and Elle, inspecting the pod wreckage, are attacked by cavemen who smash Elle to pieces and abduct Stella, but a man in a golden mask arrives, firing lasers through his eyes, and rescues her. He is revealed to be the Emperor's son, Prince Simon. They are again attacked and overpowered by the cavemen, but Akton appears and fights them off with his laser sword; he then reveals that they are standing on the Count's weaponized planet.\nArriving at an underground laboratory, the three are captured by the guards. The Count appears and reveals his plan to use them as bait to bring the Emperor to the planet and then have his weapon self-destruct, destroying the planet, the Emperor and all three of them. He leaves, ordering his two robot golems to keep the group there. Akton engages them in a laser sword duel and defeats the robots, but is mortally wounded and fades away. The Emperor arrives at the planet and fires a green ray from his flagship to \"stop time\" for three minutes, allowing them all to escape as the planet explodes behind them.\nA huge battle commences between the Emperor's armada and the Count's, with the Emperor's soldiers storming the Count's space station; however, the attack fails and the victorious Count gets ready to destroy the Emperor's home planet.

They planted a homer (a tracking device) inside a briefcase containing $1,000,000, after finding out, they brutally shoot both of them. Desperate, they store the money and drugs into a Corvette Stingray in a used car lot. Slim (Morgan Hatch), the owner, comes out to see what's going on. With nothing or no one in sight, Slim puts a Sold sign on the Corvette's windshield.\nMeanwhile, at the local A&W restaurant, Lonigan and Tony are enjoying their food when two cops bust them and take them to the station. The disgruntled Lieutenant Herschel (Richard Cosentino) is forced to let them go when the police were unable to find anything in their car, but Herschel orders his partner Sgt. Murphy (Harry Gorsuch) to follow them, anyway. Soon after, we are introduced to Lonigan and Tony's leader Abigail Bratowski (Sherry Jackson) who is disguised as a nun to avoid being recognized because she's wanted by the police in several states. The three head to the car lot with Murphy on their tail, but his car soon gets disabled by jumping over a steep hill. Then they pick up another of their cronies Rosco (Cliff Emmich) who has a habit of urinating multiple times in one hour, which is a running gag in the first half of the film.\nMuch to their dismay, they find out that the car is being bought by two buddies Al (Christopher Mitchum) and Elmo (Les Lannom). As they speed out of the car lot, the gang begins to pursue them, but Al soon gets pulled over for speeding\nby two cops. Both of them eventually get killed and their car blows up when the four criminals shoot it to oblivion. Tired of distractions and complications, Lonigan decides to purchase a homer of his own so he and the gang can track them down more easily. When they catch up with them again, along with Herschel and Murphy in a police car, they manage to disrupt a concert in the park by knocking over the stage, musicians, and sound equipment and Herschel's car ends up getting disabled when a fallen ladder damages the car's radiator. The chase is once again cut short when Abigail demands Lonigan to pull over so she can change out of her nun costume, causing another delay. Thinking that they lost them, Al and Elmo pull the car into a service station to get gas and Al decides to use the phone booth to call the police to explain the situation. When Elmo uses his jacket to wipe the sweat off his face, he notices bags of heroin in the backseat. He runs over and yanks Al out of the phone booth, causing him to rip the receiver out. Though annoyed with Elmo, he manages to persuade him that they should peddle the heroin for money or end up getting killed by the cops. As they begin to leave, Lonigan spots them and Al immediately peels out of the station, with Elmo forcing to take a shortcut by running into the woods, with Abigail and Rosco on his tail. After destroying the roadside snack stand next to the station, Lonigan and Tony go after Al, thinking it will be an easier way to get rid of Abigail since the two are fed up with her.\nAs the chase begins, it gets interrupted by two country hicks, in a delivery truck, blocking their path, Lonigan throws a grenade into the back of their truck, causing them to stop and run for their lives. Al eventually loses them in a construction site by temporarily disabling Lonigan's car with a bulldozer. Meanwhile, in the woods, Elmo hides up in a tree to avoid being spotted by Abigail\nand Rosco. Elmo eventually falls to the ground, but manages to run away as the two shoot at him. Abagail accidentally kills Rosco with her machine gun  after a brief scuffle. Elmo eventually steals a motorcycle from a young, naked couple making out in the woods and Abagail steals the other one, but soon after, she ends up losing him when she crashes it during a jump and its runs out of gas. She eventually meets up with Lonigan and Tony at the construction site, not knowing that she killed Rosco. She manages to free the car from the bulldozer and they try to find the Corvette.\nAs night falls, Al decides to make a stop at a neighborhood bar called Ronnie B's to relax and have a beer. Not long after, a weary and filthy-looking Elmo arrives and decides to clean up in the bathroom, but Abagail, Lonigan, and Tony arrive thanks to the homer. Abagail instructs Tony to stand guard outside while she and Lonigan go in to find them. Once in there, a bar patron (John Carl Buechler) tries to hit on Abagail, but she ends up setting his crotch on fire with a cigarette lighter. The pandemonium eventually erupts in an all-out bar fight and amidst the chaos, Al and Elmo sneak out of the bathroom window and are immediately caught by Tony, but Elmo knocks him out after he punches Al to the ground and they escape in the Corvette. At his boiling point, Lonigan lays it on the line with Tony saying he and Tony will not take the heat for this caper and decide to abandon Abagail altogether. They try to run her over in the parking lot, but get chased away by her gunfire. Shortly after, Herschel and Murphy arrive in the bar with all the patrons and employees laying around in disarray after Abagail fired bullets in the air to stop the fight. Herschel then orders Murphy to put out an APB on Abagail and her cronies.\nThe next day, Al and Elmo are seen driving back into the city, hoping to find another way out of this whole mess. Elmo picks up a hitchhiking girl (Sondra Theodore) for no apparent reason as Al thinks it is not a good idea, at the moment. Elmo thinks the only way to elude them is disguising the car in a different color, something Al is not too thrilled with. Meanwhile, Abagail manages to steal an Austin Healey by fatally shooting the driver and putting his body in the backseat. As Abagail sneaks up to Lonigan and Tony, she kills Lonigan by stabbing him in the neck with an ice pick. She attempts to kill Tony, too, but decides to spare his life, providing he will share the million dollars with her. Al, Elmo, and the hitchhiker accidentally pull the Corvette into a car wash, causing the new paint job to wash away, blowing their cover. Abagail and Tony engage in one final chase that ends in a dead end embankment road under a city bridge. Elmo disables Abagail and Tony's car by blowing up its engine with Abagail's Machine gun that Tony left back at Ronnie B's accidentally. Al, Elmo, and the girl retreat and Abagail gets shot by Tony, stating that he does not share a million dollars with nobody. Thinking she died of the wound, Tony collects the heroin bags and starts to leave in the Corvette, but she sits up and fatally shoots Tony multiple times. Despite being shot, she tries to get into the Corvette, herself, but the machine gun Elmo left behind is standing next to the car door and the gun's charge ignites when she tries to shut it, causing it to shoot her in the head. Suddenly, Herschel, Murphy, and a squad of policemen arrive on the scene and discover all of the dead bodies, including Lonigan's in the back seat of their car. Later on, Al and Elmo attempt to locate the suitcase of money the girl managed to sneak away from the crime scene, but they discover it's gone. They find out that a derelict had stole the case and they chase after him under the bridge supporter. Al tries to retrieve it, but falls into the river and never comes back up.\nThe final sequence has Elmo explaining to the girl saying they should have gone to the police, originally and blames himself for being too greedy, but Elmo notices Al's body floating over to the shore. He runs over and discovers Al was pretending to have drowned just to play a joke on Elmo.

Krypton, thereafter, is destroyed.\nThe ship lands near Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El, now about three Earth years old, is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are astonished when he lifts their truck. They decide to raise him as their own, naming him Clark after Martha's maiden name. Jonathan tells the boy that he must have been sent to Earth for \"a reason\".\nAfter Jonathan's death from a heart attack, 18-year-old Clark hears a psychic \"call\" and discovers a glowing green crystal in the remains of his spacecraft. It compels him to travel to the Arctic where he uses the crystal to construct the Fortress of Solitude, which resembles the architecture of Krypton. Inside, a hologram of Jor-El explains Clark's true origins, and after twelve years of educating him on his reason for being sent to Earth and his powers, he leaves the Fortress wearing a blue and red suit with a red cape and the House of El family crest emblazoned on his chest. Becoming a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis, Clark meets and develops a romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane.\nLois is involved in a helicopter accident. Clark publicly uses his powers for the first time to save her, astonishing the crowd gathered below. He then thwarts a jewel thief attempting to scale the Solow Building, captures robbers fleeing police and depositing their getaway cabin cruiser on Wall Street, rescues a girl's cat from a tree, and saves Air Force One after a lightning strike destroys an engine. The \"caped wonder\" is an instant celebrity. Daily Planet boss Perry White wants the newspaper to find out more information about him. Clark visits Lois at her penthouse apartment the next night for an interview and takes her for a flight; Lois subsequently writes an article naming him \"Superman\".\nMeanwhile, criminal genius Lex Luthor learns of a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy nuclear missile test. He buys hundreds of acres of empty desert land and reprograms the two missiles to detonate in the San Andreas Fault, with his assistant Otis accidentally programming the second missile coordinates incorrectly. Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Lex deduces that a recently discovered meteorite is from Krypton and is radioactive to Superman. After he and his accomplices Otis and Eve Teschmacher retrieve a piece of it, Luthor lures Superman to his underground lair and reveals his plan to cause everything west of the San Andreas Fault to sink into the Pacific Ocean, leaving Luthor's desert land as the new West Coast of the United States. Luthor then exposes him to the meteor piece's mineral, Kryptonite, which weakens Superman greatly as Luthor taunts him about the second missile which will detonate in Hackensack, New Jersey.\nTeschmacher is horrified that Luthor does not care that her mother lives in Hackensack. Luthor leaves Superman to die. Knowing he always keeps his word, Teschmacher helps Superman on the condition he will stop the eastbound missile first. After being freed, Superman diverts the eastbound missile into outer space, consequently preventing him from reaching the westbound missile before it explodes in the San Andreas Fault. Massive earthquakes erupt across California, damaging the Golden Gate Bridge and breaching the Hoover Dam. Superman mitigates the effects of the explosion by sealing the fault line.\nWhile Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car falls into a crevice from one of the aftershocks, trapping her as it fills with dirt and debris. She suffocates before Superman can reach her.

An Air Force unit, led by Major Baker (Bradford Dillman), investigates, and comes across an unauthorized scientist at the secured base, Dr. Bradford Crane (Michael Caine), who was tracking a large swarm of killer bees, when they attacked the Air Force bunker. General Slater (Richard Widmark) orders two helicopters to check the area, whereupon the helicopters are destroyed by the swarm of bees. Crane insists to Slater that the base was attacked by the same African killer bees that destroyed the helicopters. Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross), one of the base's doctors, supports Crane's story.\nMeanwhile, in the nearby countryside, the Durant family is attacked by the swarm of the bees. The mother and father die from the bee stings, but Paul, their son, escapes in a Mustang. Although he is stung, Paul manages to make it into town and crashes into the Marysville town square, where the citizens are preparing for the annual flower festival. The boy is brought into the hands of military personnel, where he hallucinates a vision of giant bees attacking him, due to the aftereffects of the bee sting. Wheelchair-bound Dr. Walter Krim (Henry Fonda) confirms to Crane that the very war they have feared for a long time has started against the bees. At the gates of the base, Slater confronts angry county engineer Jed Hawkins (Slim Pickens), who demands to see the dead body of his son, an airman in the bunker, who was killed by the bees. Hawkins takes the body bag and departs, leaving the entire watching crowd silent over the loss. Slater suggests airdropping poison on the swarm, but Crane considers the ecological possibilities of the situation, as the poison will wipe out plant growth for a decade or more.\nRecovering from his earlier bee attack, Paul and his friends search for the hive to firebomb it in revenge for his family, which results only in angering the bees, who make their way to Marysville, where they kill hundreds, including some children at the local school. Crane and Helena take shelter at the local diner, with pregnant caf\u00e9 waitress Rita. Reporter Anne McGregor (Lee Grant) watches from the safety of her news van, hoping to get some exciting footage about the siege. After this most recent attack, and fear of another one, Slater suggests evacuating many of the townsfolk in a train. However, the bees attack the train, causing the locomotive derail over a cliff, killing everyone aboard, including a love triangle made up of schoolteacher Maureen Scheuster, retiree Felix Austin, and town mayor and drug store owner Clarence Tuttle.\nRita tries to board the ill-fated train but is saved at the last minute by going into labor and is confined to the hospital. She gives birth to her child while falling in love with the doctor in the process; but Paul suffers a relapse from the effects of being stung earlier and later dies, devastating Helena and sending her into a rage about why the children have to die. The savage swarm heads for Houston, Texas, and Crane decides to drop eco-friendly poison pellets on them, hoping that the swarm senses will harm them and stay away from the city. Unfortunately, the plan fails. Dr. Krim self-injects an experimental bee venom antidote, planning to track the results, but the trial proves fatal and he dies. Meanwhile, nuclear power plant manager Dr. Andrews (Jos\u00e9 Ferrer) is convinced that his plant can withstand the attacks of the bees, ignoring the warnings of Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain). However, the bees invade the plant, causing a nuclear explosion, killing Andrews and Hubbard, destroying the plant, and wiping out a nearby town.\nMeanwhile, in Houston, Crane analyzes tapes from the bee invasion and comes to the conclusion that a test of an alarm system at the ICBM bunker attracted the swarm into the base. The bees attack Houston, resulting in the deaths of Major Baker and Dr. Newman, one of Crane's associates. Slater sacrifices himself to save Crane and Helena from the bees. Helicopters playing the alarm sound from the ICBM bunker over loudspeakers lure the bees out to sea, where they douse the water with oil and set the swarm ablaze.

Initially, he only has three contacts in Seoul: Park Mu, the chief press officer for the Republic of Korea Army, Janet O'Neill, the wife of senior American intelligence official Dr. Kelton, and Lee Hong-sik, his handler, through whom Yu also runs into his old lover Kim Soon-hee, who is apparently employed by the United States Counter Intelligence Corps, and is introduced to Colonel Klaus. Yu begins gathering intelligence on a coup plot by rightist South Korean general Sin Jae-sin. Lee helps him pass back this information to North Korea using his unwitting friend Kim Su-gyong as a courier. Lee is suspected by a US counter intelligence agent Martin who found Lee takes care of homeless kids. Soon after, Lee is killed in a shootout with CIC agents, including Kim Soon-hee, leaving Yu unable to pass his crucial intelligence back to his government. Yu calls Lee from a bar, but after realizing the person on the other end of the line is not Lee, hangs up immediately. A waitress in that bar is subsequently arrested and tortured by Colonel Klaus, who learns that a man suspected to be Yu was seen making the phone call.Yu flees to a Hong Kong safe house run by a North Korean singer.

Yu hides messages in cigarette filters, which he then throws on the ground near the beggar. However, he is unaware that he is being followed by the CIC, who are filming his activities. Colonel Klaus hears about a North Korean spy disguised as a veteran, and begins reviewing video tapes to check on Yu's activities. Kim saves the day by cutting the scenes out of the tapes to avoid further suspicion falling on Yu, but the disappearance of the scenes triggers Klaus' suspicion towards Kim herself.

He resorts to devil worship and appeases the Devil- Karimuthey who appears before him. He requests him to provide everlasting youth. The devil grants his wish, on the condition that he must be appeased by offering 10 virgin girls at every specific interval of his life. Upon offering each virgin girl, the devil grants him nectar of youth, that can reverse his age back to youth and warns, failing to do so, he will absorb all energy of Thamban and his body shall be rotten. Based on his word, Karimuthey grants him the first glass of nectar, which makes him young.\nHe then resorts to seducing young girls for Karimuthey. The first victim was Kochammani, Heiress of an aristocratic Nair family of Tharayil Kurups. She was the only young lady in the family through which family lineage has to move on. Thamban appears in front of them as a rich young prince of Wayanad. He meets, the elder uncle of the girl and express his desire to marry. Though he and Kochammani's elder brother Kunjambu agrees to the proposal, they asked him to wait for getting the horoscope fixed. Thamban seduces Kochammani and was in a hurry to get her to his fort to offer to Karimuthey as the time was fast approaching. So instead of waiting for marriage, he kidnaps her, by seducing her with his magical powers. Kochamani's young brother Ananthu saw this and reports it to the elders, who rush with their men to rescue. However, Thamban overpowers them with his magical powers and drags her to the palace. By this time, his mask of youth got withered away and he forcibly offers Kochammani to Karimurthy who gives him the second glass of nectar to regain youth.\nThe men of the Tharyil family seek the whereabouts of the mysterious Prince and come to know that such a man or place doesn't exist. However, a few tribal men reported that they saw an old man rushing on horseback with a young girl matching to description of Kochammani, which confuses the Tharayil men. They thought, some magician might have killed the young Thamban and drove away with Kochammani. They pledge to themselves that all male members of the family will never forgive Thamban for this atrocity and will take revenge for it.\nAs years passed, Thamban identifies his next target- Nabissa, a daughter of a rich Muslim trader- Kannamparambathu Koyambadu Haji (Balan K. Nair), whom he saw at a railway station (signifies that time has moved to an age when commercial trains started). He appears in front of them as Ibrahim, a young trader and seduces Nabissa. At the same time, Thamban disguises himself as son of Kochammani and Thamban and appears before the Tharayil Family citing himself as an orphan after his mom died. The current head- Kunjambu welcomes young Thamban, thinking of him as his nephew.\nKoyambadu Haji and his son Abdulla (Janardanan) fixes Nikkah for Nabissa and Thamban who disguises himself as Ibrahim elopes with Nabissa. However, Koyambadu Haji's guards spot them and block them. However, Thamban attacks them and even wounds Abdulla. Hearing of this, Koyambadu Haji and his men with guns rush to hunt for the mysterious young man. They learn that the young man was living in Tharayil House and they rush there. Spotting his nephew also missing, Kunjambu felt suspicious about the young man who lived with them for days as his nephew. As he claimed himself to be the son of Thamban, they assumed he too did the same with Nabissa as was done to his sister Kochamani. The combined men of both Tharayil and Koyambadu mutually pledge to assist each other and hunt for the mysterious man. They also learn from tribals that an old man rode in a horse cart with young girl, so both assume, it's some black magician who inflicted damages to their family. Both families further pledge to track down and do revenge even after generations.\nTime further passes and Thamban kept on poaching girls in nearby localities under varied identities and names. The new target for Thamban is Annamma (Latha), a Christian girl on her matriculation. Thamban appears before her as Thomas, a college lecturer. He seduces her as usual, and brings her to his fort. However, as a devoted Christian, she felt suspicious about the voices of devils inside and escape from him by flashing her cross. However, Thamban as Thomas came before her the next day and made her believe, it was all just a trick to scare her and give a surprise, which she believed. Thamban felt, to bring her again to the fort, he must earn her trust, so he married her at the register office. However, Annamma seduced Thamban on their wedding night and entered into a sexual relationship with Thamban, losing her virginity, thus making her unfit to sacrifice for Karimurthy. Thamban seriously felt love with Annamma, thus his devil lord Karimurthy started warning that he is losing patience. In time, Anna became pregnant and Thamban enjoyed life with her. One day when he woke up, he saw himself in his original identity as old fragile man and Anna was horrified to see the old man lying next to her. Thamban ran away from Anna's home and surrendered himself to Karimurthy. Karimurthy gave one last chance to him and offered him youth again, on assurance that he won't enter into any relationship and will offer virgin girls to the devil.\nAnna realizes there was no man called Thomas working in the college as said by Thamban and she connected with her experience earlier at Thamban's fort to reach a conclusion that her husband was a black magician. Anna gave birth to a daughter and she put her in a boarding school to avoid speaking on details of her husband. The current generation of the Tharayil Family and Abdulla in his old age are still keeping in good relations to gather any information on the mysterious man. They soon realize several families in other villages had similar experiences decades before and thus form a joint committee to carry out a search.\nYears later, Thamban continued his antics, this time with a local tribal community girl. By now, India was under British rule and Malabar Police was investigating on missing of this tribal girl, which came in local newspapers. This brings Abdulla and Tharayil Kurups to meet the parents of missing girl and understand the modus operandi is very similar. Annamma also reads this news and connects this to her incident.\nAs time passes again, Thampan identifies his latest target Elisy (Shobha) who he finds in a picnic place. Elisy and Thamban who now appears as Frankie, a photographer' they become good friends and form a close friendship. He gives a photograph of him with Elisy to her which she kept in her book. Unbeknownst to Thamban, Elisy is the daughter of Annamma and Anna finds the photograph of young Thamban in Elisy's book, which shocks her. She understands, he is now behind her daughter. To confirm the identity of Thamban, she takes the photograph and shows it to the parents of a missing tribal girl, who confirms the same. Old Members of Tharayil family as well as Abdulla also confirms the identity, thus they all realize, they are all searching one man, not multiple magicians etc.\nWhile Anna was coordinating with other affected members, Thamban, now as Frankie seduces Elisy and brings her to his fort. Hearing her daughter missing, Anna along with Abdulla, his men as well as other men of affected families rush to the Thamban's palace as she knew where it was out of her experience going there once. While they enter, Thamban was about to offer Elisy to Karimurthy and Abdulla's men started firing at Thamban. He escapes to the backyard of the palace along with Elisy and then enters again to the Devil's chamber. By this time, Anna comes in front of Thamban and reminds him that Elisy is his daughter. Dilemma struck Thamban, who now changes into old man, and loses his ability to fight with other men. In this confusion, Anna forcibly takes Elisy and rushes out of the house.

Some doubt whether Luper exists or if he was invented by the Institute to embark on an experimental film project. Some say that the more modern / non-landscape footage was inserted contrary to what Luper envisioned; this footage is alleged to have been shot by another. The academics assert that if Luper was building to anything, it would be at the middle of the square described before VFR1, rather than the final shot of VFR. VFR3 plays. Shots change in a call-and-response pattern to a basic piano score.\nVFR3 is criticized.

Stranded deep in hostile territory, the abandoned mercenaries fight their way through bush country, pursued by the Simbas. Many men, including Coetzee, are killed along the way.\nThe mercenaries make their way to Limbani's home village, hoping to start a rebellion, but realise that his people are too ill-equipped to fight. An Irish missionary living there informs the group of an old Douglas Dakota transport aircraft nearby that they can use to escape. As the Simbas close in, the mercenaries suffer heavy casualties holding them off in a climactic battle while Fynn starts the Dakota's engines. Janders is shot in the leg and unable to board the departing airplane. Faulkner is forced to kill him to spare him from capture and torture. The thirteen surviving mercenaries from the original fifty eventually manage to land at Kariba Airport, Rhodesia, but Limbani dies from a gunshot wound sustained during the escape.\nSome months later, Faulkner returns to London and breaks into Matheson's home to confront him. Faulkner takes the half a million dollars in Matheson's safe to compensate the survivors and the families of those who died. Faulkner then kills Matheson and makes a swift getaway with Fynn.
