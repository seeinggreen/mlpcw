There is a plot twist when he finds out that this land is soon to be irrigated by a dam. Asa Holman, the banker, knows that the ownership of property deed must be registered the next day, but does not let Tex know. Instead, he offers a $50,000 reward for his capture.The film is set in western Montana in the 1920s during a time when men rode horses as a means of transport. The film begins with a screen that says, \"In Montana, things often happen with a surprising suddenness.\" This is followed by a black screen with the words, \"Help!\" appearing multiple times. What appears to be a brawl including guns is unfolding across the street where a business owner notices and calls for help. Then, we see a black screen that says, \"Get him boys, don't let him get away.\" Then there is some more brawling, followed by a black screen that says, \"I've got what you're after, try and get it.\" Some more brawling, followed by a screen that says, \"50,000 reward to the man who gets him.\" The men start running after Tex Sherwood as it appears, and he runs away on his horse. The group of men all hop on their horses and follow Ken until they see he has gone up a hill with his horse and the rest of them can't seem to get up there. A black screen then appears and it says, \"Tex Sherwood cowpuncher from the Rio Grande, the cause of all the excitement, who has come to Montana to transact some business of a personal nature,\" Then, we see a black screen that says, \"Buck Scofield, the leader of a lawless outfit,\" and \"Tarzan, Tex Sherwood's pal, by himself.\" Here, we can tell that Tarzan is Ted Sherwood's horse. Then we see Ted and a black screen that says, \"We fooled 'em boy, didn't we?\" Tarzan nods, and Sherwood rides him down onto the other side of the hill.\nThe scenes change, and we are now in an office. A black screen says, \"Asa Holman, president of the bank, and a big man in local affairs.\" We see this character who appears to be Asa Holman speaking and a black screen that says, \"Tex Sherwood is in town with the papers. I've offered Buck and his gang $50,000 reward to get those documents.\" We then see a man reply, he is Eli Higgins, Holman's lawyer. Holman and Higgins exchange back and forth. Holman looks concerned, saying \"I have millions at stake. If he records those papers, I am ruined.\"At this point in the film, we find out why it is that Holman is so concerned. We find out that Holman is a sponsor for a large reclamation project, part of which is a million dollar dam nearing completion in the mountains.\nAll of this takes place during the first 5 minutes of the film and sets the course for the plot to unfold. On the one hand, we have Ted Sherwood, which has just received a piece of land. And on the other hand, we have Asa Holman, the president of the bank, who has a conflict of interest in Sherwood's acquirement.

This inspires him to daydream about Mars and a strange civilization there. We see Aelita (Yuliya Solntseva), the queen; Tuskub (Konstantin Eggert), the actual ruler; and Ikhoshka (Aleksandra Peregonets), Aelita's mischievous maid. They live in a society where aristocrats rule over slaves who are confined underground and put into cold storage when not required.\nLos's wife Natasha (Valentina Kuindzhi) is pestered by Erlikh (Pavel Pol), a bourgeois playboy before the revolution who is now a dishonest minor official.

He disappears; a would-be detective, Kratsov (Igor Ilyinsky) (who has been rejected by the police) suspects Spiridonov to be guilty of the theft of the sugar, because of his disappearance.\nLos's jealousy gets out of control and he shoots Natasha: disguising himself as Spiridonov with a wig, false beard and glasses, he goes into hiding and makes plan to escape to Mars in a rocketship he has been constructing.

Los confuses Kratsov by removing the disguise.\nThey land on Mars. Tuskub orders them killed, ignoring Aelita's pleas for their safety. Kratsov is taken before Tuskub and demands that the soldiers arrest the other two: he is promptly arrested. The chief astronomer comes to Aelita and tells her where Los's ship has landed; she instructs her maid to kill him. The maid is arrested and sent to the slaves' caves - Gusev, who has taken a fancy to her, follows.\nAelita and Los meet and fall in love, though Los occasionally sees her as Natasha (so do we). They are arrested and sent to the caves.\nGusev tells the slaves of his own country's revolution and foments a revolt, which Aelita takes command of. Tuskub is overthrown and the army sides with Aelita - she commands them to fire on the workers and herd them back to the caves - she intends to rule Mars herself. Disgusted, Los kills Aelita (seeing her as Natasha as he does so).\nSuddenly back on Earth, it's clear that all this is a daydream. Erlikh is arrested for theft.

The film includes several flashbacks and crosscuts to other scenes giving additional information about those characters..\nAn opening intertitle extols the beauty of Varmland and the (fictional) estate of \"Ekeby.\"  A century earlier, the estate was home to a company of twelve \"Cavaliers,\" former soldiers who spend their time idly and often drunkenly as guests of Margaretha Samzelius, wife of a former army major and referred to as the \"Majoress.\"  On Christmas Eve, Gosta Berling, a defrocked Lutheran minister, leads evening revels and tricks the company with an appearance of a \"devil,\" played by Sintram, a household servant.\nEvents later that evening lead to a flashback when Berling was still a minister but on the verge of being removed from his parish by the presiding bishop because of his habitual drunkenness.  Berling gives such a moving sermon, though, that the parishioners and bishop are ready to forgive him until he begins to denounce their hypocrisy.  Driven into exile, he becomes tutor to Ebba Dohna, stepdaughter of the mistress of Borg, an estate near Ekeby.  The mother hopes to have Ebba marry Berling so that she will be disinherited for marrying a commoner, allowing the mother's natural son, Hendrik, to become heir to the estate.\nAt that time, Hendrik returns from a trip to Italy with his new wife, Elizabeth.  At dinner that night, Berling's past is exposed, devastating Ebba, who is in love with him, but rousing the sympathy of Elizabeth.  Berling leaves Borg and is found half-frozen by Margaretha who brings him to Ekeby and makes him one of the Cavaliers.

In a scene with a young neighbor woman, Marianne Sinclaire, he kisses her, although the audience thinks it is part of the act.  Marianne's father, however, is outraged and leaves the party, with Marianne walking in the snow to their house, where her father refuses to let her in.  Back at the party, Margarethe's own past is exposed by one of the Cavaliers, and her husband the Major throws her out of the house.  Disgusted with life, the Major gives control of Ekeby to the Cavaliers, bitterly predicting that they will ruin the estate.\nBerling searches for Margaretha but finds Marianne collapsed in the snow by her family's front door.  Berling takes her back to Ekeby but tries to keep her presence confidential since she has fallen ill.  In the meantime, Margarethe has returned to the cottage where her mother still lives, seeking forgiveness.  As the old woman collapses and lies dying, there is a partial reconciliation but Margarethe realizes that she must atone for her past by driving the Cavaliers out of Ekeby.\nAt Borg, Hendrik learns that his Italian marriage to Elizabeth will not be considered legal until they both sign certain documents.  At Ekeby, Berling considers marriage to Marianne, but she turns him away when she reveals that her face has been scarred by smallpox.  Margarethe, driven by her own guilt and rage, assembles a party to set fire to the wing of Ekeby housing the Cavaliers in order to capture and exile them, but the fire gets out of control and begins to burn the central mansion housing Marianne, whom Berling manages to save from the flames just as her father arrives, now relieved that his daughter is safe.\nAt Borg, seeing the fire, Elizabeth heads across the lake to Ekeby on foot, where she is discovered by Berling who was driving a sleigh across the ice.
