The couple's car mysteriously breaks down one evening in the middle of nowhere and they go to the nearby house of Patrick's veterinary colleague, Arthur, to seek help. There Louise witnesses Arthur leading a strange and bloody pagan ritual but refuses to say anything to Patrick. It becomes apparent that something strange is happening in town and that Arthur knows that Louise saw the ritual.\nSoon afterwards a farmer, Mick O'Shea, is accidentally killed by his own bull. Horrified, Louise and Patrick, who witness the accident, plan to leave, but Arthur, who needs their skills (and presumably doesn't want Louise telling what she saw), convinces them to stay by explaining that he has a ritual that brings back the dead, but only for three days, only within the boundaries of the townland, and only if the person has been dead for less than a year. This is the ritual that Louise witnessed. The couple agree to remain, excited to see their only child again.\nThe ritual requires a piece of the person to be resurrected, and the couple go grave-robbing, cutting off one of Alice's fingers and retrieving her necklace (from the opening scene). The ritual also needs a fresh corpse. At Mick's wake, Arthur asks his widow, Peggy, to use his body, but she refuses, claiming there is something not right about the couple. However, Arthur persuades her by tacitly threatening her that if she refuses he will not resurrect Mick either.\nThe gruesome ritual goes ahead and Alice is reborn.

Soon, his lieutenant Pasupathy brings a proposal. A large stash of cocaine, worth about \u20b920,000,000 (US$250,000), has entered the city. The man bringing the stash wants to sell it for \u20b95,000,000 (US$63,000). Pasupathy sees the profit, the long-term benefit (to control the cocaine market with such an ample supply), and the recognition that they are able to pull off such a deal. The drawback is that the stash belongs to their arch-rival Gajendran. Singaperumal knows that Gajendran is a vicious and unpredictable adversary and that the venture is risky, so he decides to pass. Pasupathy suggests that Singaperumal is getting old and asks him to loan him  \u20b95,000,000 (US$63,000) so he can do the job himself. Pasupathy is prepared to face the risks, and in return for the loan, he offers Singaperumal a cut of the profits. Singaperumal agrees to the loan but instead asks Pasupathy to first get the stash and then think of the profit distribution.\nKaalayan is a destitute farmer, living with his young, street-smart son Kodukapuli in the slums and earns a meagre living staging cockfights; coincidentally, Singaperumal loves to watch these cockfights. One evening, a man arrives in a bunk with Kaalayan for the night. The man is actually the cocaine courier, who routinely transports various stashes of drugs in and out of the city and collects a relatively small fee \u20b910,000 (US$130) for each trip. That evening, after a long bout of drinking, he reveals that he has learnt the actual value of the stash and now intends to sell it himself.\nSeeing Subbu in tears, Singaperumal asks one of his men, Sappai, to take her out and comfort her so she is prepared to perform for him at night. Sappai takes her to the beach and tries to console her. Pasupathy and the men meet with the tipster and drive off to retrieve the stash. En-route in the car, one of the men receives a call from Singaperumal, who orders him to bump off Pasupathy as soon as the stash is acquired. Pasupathy overhears the call and gets into a Mexican stand-off with others. In a desperate ploy, he deliberately provokes a cop at a checkpoint, getting arrested and then later making an escape. The men kidnap his wife Kasthuri and use her as bait to lure Pasupathy. Singaperumal orders them to bring Kasthuri to him. Meanwhile, Subbu hates being a plaything for Singaperumal and wants to live life on her own terms. She tries to persuade Sappai to think for himself and realize that Singaperumal is using them. Sappai, however, is too fearful and weak to oppose Singaperumal. Subbu and Sappai become unlikely friends, and Subbu continues to hope for a way out. Subbu is somewhat educated and learns whatever she can about the world outside Singaperumal.\nMeanwhile, Kaalayan stages his cockfight the following day, but this time, his prize rooster gets killed. He is now in serious financial trouble. Kodukapuli senses this and immediately goes to see if their visitor, still unconscious, has any money. They find out that the man had overdone his drink and died. Kaalayan and Kodukapuli find the cocaine stash and the phone number of a prospective buyer (Singaperumal and Pasupathy). On the other hand, Singaperumal is worried as his stash has not arrived, nor has he got word that Pasupathy is dead. He gets an angry call from Gajapathy (Gajendran's brother and right-hand man): if Pasupathy seizes Gajapathy's stuff, Gajendran will unleash a gang war. The cunning Singaperumal tells Gajapathy that Pasupathy has gone rogue and Gajapathy is free to take out Pasupathy. Singaperumal figures this will benefit him both ways: he will get the stash, and Pasupathy will be killed by Gajendran. Gajendran sends his thugs after Pasupathy, who is on the run. Now that Singaperumal has become his enemy, Pasupathy figures that Gajendran could possibly become an ally.\nKaalayan calls Singaperumal to meet and make a deal for the stash. While waiting for him, Singaperumal's thugs arrive and kidnap Kaalayan. After continuous torture, Kaalayan is unable to reveal anything as Kodukapuli has the stash. Kodukapuli ends up accidentally calling Pasupathy's number and offers to trade the stash for his father. Pasupathy joins Kodukapuli and offers the same trade to Singaperumal: the stash in return for Kaalayan and Kasthuri. Pasupathi places a call to Gajendran and offers to reveal the location of the stash. Gajendran and his gang arrive at the location to make the exchange with Pasupathy. Singaperumal's thugs also arrive. Pasupathy pretends to offer the stash to Gajapathy, but instead slices his throat right in front of Gajendran. An enraged Gajendran and his gang chase Pasupathy. Pasupathy leads them around the block where Singaperumal's gang lay waiting. Both gangs, mistaking Pasupathy's loyalties, charge at each other and ensure in a gang war. Pasupathy gets out of the fray and watches as Singaperumal's key generals and Gajendran hack each other to bits. Pasupathy's plan to decimate the two strong factions has succeeded, and he returns to finish off Singaperumal.\nBack in his room, Singaperumal discovers that the bag with the loan money is missing. He rushes to the conclusion that Sappai took it. When Sappai returns (having been sent by Subbu to fetch fruits), Singaperumal beats him up severely. After being beaten up, Sappai shoots Singaperumal dead. All of a sudden, Subbu emerges from the shadows. She is proud of Sappai, but in a stunning twist, she shoots him dead. When Pasupathy arrives, he finds the two men dead and Subbu in tears. Having always been sympathetic to Subbu's suffering with Singaperumal, he says she is free to go. Pasupathy assumes command of the remaining thugs of Singaperumal's gang, and his wife Kasthuri is also unharmed. He later gets the stash and pays Kodukapuli a fair commission.\nIt is finally revealed that Subbu had planned the whole chain of events. She sent Sappai with the money bag to provoke Singaperumal's temper. She retrieves the bag and quietly leaves the city to begin a new life. She remarks that the men basically mistrusted, misused, and slaughtered each other. In her view, Sappai too was not really an innocent victim.

When they are studying together at her house, they receive help from her parents who co-wrote the book which they are doing the project on.\nAs Allie gets closer to her classmates, she starts to experience visions of King Arthur and becomes better friends with Will. She starts to suspect that the legend of the prophecy is true. She discovers at a party that Jennifer, Will's girlfriend, and Lance, Will's best friend, are having an affair behind Will's back. Allie fears if Will finds out, he would suffer the same fate as King Arthur and meet his downfall. Together, Miles and Allie discover the day King Arthur is prophesied to return.\nWill suffers from a blow both in school and at practice that shakes his confidence before the big game, which Will has to win in order to gain a scholarship. Allie tries to tell Will about Jennifer and Lance's affair but is constantly \"interrupted\", so she enlists the help of Mr. Moore (Allie, Will, Lance, and Miles' medieval history teacher) to protect Will.\nOn the night of the game Will arrives early to school and sees Jennifer and Lance together and takes off; Allie gives chase. Finding Will at the forest where they had previously spent time together, she tells him that he is King Arthur, but he takes it as a metaphor about him returning to the game. Allie and Miles then attend and watch as Will returns to the game as the prophesied eclipse and meteor shower take place. At half time, Lance apologizes to Will for the affair but Will instead gives his blessing for Lance and Jennifer to be together, forgiving them both. Will then asks to meet Allie after the game, but he disappears. Allie and Miles go in search and Miles uses his psychic power to find him.\nGoing to the school theater, they find an injured Marco outside and Will inside the theater, again Allie tells him the truth of his identity. Mr. Moore arrives and reveals that he is really Mordred and Marco reveals that his father was actually a member of the Order of the Bear before he died. Ever since he died, Marco has sworn to continue his father's job to protect Arthur (Will), and had been trying to gain Mr. Moore's trust. Mr. Moore (Mordred) then attacks the group. Allie grabs a prop sword to stop Mr. Moore, but it transforms into Excalibur, revealing that she is the real reincarnation of King Arthur. Mr. Moore and Allie duel in an alternate reality, where Will, Marco, Miles (Merlin), and Lance (Lancelot) are also present and fighting. With the help of Merlin, Allie defeats Mordred.\nBack in the theater, they are able to escape and Mr. Moore is \"detained\" by the security officer after he tries to tell him that Allie is king Arthur and her prop sword was real. Will then rushes off to finish the football game and promises to talk with Allie afterward, and he proceeds to win the game, taking the Knights to state for the first time. Having not witnessed Allie and Mr. Moore's great battle, Allie's parents remark sadly about how they'll never find Arthur, never realizing that their own daughter is his reincarnation. Miles now embraces his powers and becomes more social which gets him a girlfriend. At the end of the game, Will kisses Allie.\nAll the characters gather together at the round table dressed as their legendary counterparts.

Cognizant of his limited budget, Costa decides to film in Bolivia, the poorest country in South America. Hundreds of Bolivian locals show up and wait in long lines in response to the open casting pamphlet. Costa is enthusiastic to save thousands of dollars by having underpaid extras perform tasks on set meant to be completed by experienced engineers.Sebasti\u00e1n casts a local man named Daniel (Juan Carlos Aduviri) in the role of Hatuey, the Ta\u00edno chief who led a rebellion against Columbus. Daniel's daughter Bel\u00e9n lands a crucial role in the film as well. Their first encounter with Daniel is during the casting process. When casting directors start to turn people away in line, Daniel starts to make a scene and states that everyone should get a chance to audition, as the pamphlet advertised. The first encounter with Daniel makes Costa oppose his casting, but Sebastian sees Daniel's fire and liveliness even in the line protesting for a chance for his daughter as perfect for the role. He is just the character they're looking for. Sebasti\u00e1n is unaware that Daniel is leading demonstrations against new government-protected water company during water privatization plan. Filming begins smoothly despite the alcoholism of the actor Anton (Karra Elejalde), cast as Columbus, but when Costa observes Daniel's revolutionary involvement, he becomes increasingly uneasy about his reliability as Daniel has a critical role in the film.A conflict that occurred between Costa and Daniel early in the film was when Daniel heard Costa express how they were getting away with paying the native extras so poorly. Costa decides to speak badly of the natives right in front of Daniel in English not knowing that Daniel understands English as well. Because of this Daniel becomes more aware of how Costa and the rest of the crew are taking advantage of the natives. After seeing that Daniel understands that abuse, Costa becomes more cognizant of it himself and starts to feel guilty, which ultimately leads to the rapid development of his character throughout the remainder of the film.\nAs the crew begins to wrap up the film, the exasperation of the natives intensifies.

Costa reaches his breaking point with Daniel when after going to a protest he gets beaten by the police. He decides to try to bribe Daniel to stop going, offering him several thousand dollars to stay silent for a few weeks. Daniel agrees, accepting the money, but spends it on funding the protesters and remains involved, eventually becoming bloodied and imprisoned. Sebasti\u00e1n experiences moral conflict and begins to doubt the likelihood of the film's completion, but is reassured by Costa, who bribes the police for Daniel's temporary release to film a key scene, in which Col\u00f3n and his conquistadors execute Hatuey and his rebels. Upon this scene's completion, the police arrive in the Bolivian jungle and detain Daniel again, but are besieged by the film's extras which allows Daniel to escape.\nThat night, when actors Juan and Alberto see the latest news reports showing violence in Cochabamba, they become so worried that they demand to leave.

In the northern plains of the Maasai Mara, lives Sita, a cheetah who has just given birth to five cubs to take care of. Sita and her cubs coexist with another lion pride led by a large male named Kali, who wishes to expand his pride and territory by taking over Fang's own with the help of his four sons, which however he cannot reach as both sides are divided by the Nile crocodile infested Mara River.\nOne day, Sita's cubs are playing while Kali and the largest of his sons are on patrol. Sita, seeing them as a serious danger to her cubs, goads both lions, so as to lure them away. But after the confrontation, the cubs have scattered. Sita desperately calls for them. As it gets darker, hyenas are seen and heard. In the morning, three of her five cubs return to Sita. Although she continues to call for the other two cubs, it's clear that they have been killed by hyenas. Meanwhile, Layla is injured by a zebra's kick while hunting. As the wildebeest begin to migrate to greener pastures, so does the River pride. However, due to her injury and old age, Layla has trouble keeping up. Mara stays alongside her mother and tries to help on her way. Soon, they begin to lose track of the pride. Knowing that Mara needs her family for her survival, Layla forces through her injury, and they soon find themselves within the River pride once more. As time passes in the northern side, Sita's cubs thrive, and begin to show more of their cheetah nature. One day, a gang of three adult cheetah brothers roaming about zone in on Sita. Again, Sita finds herself having to divert attention from rivals so that they do not find her cubs. However, being fellow cheetahs, they do not tire as easily as lions do; and soon, the brothers separate Sita from her cubs. As they circle them, the cubs stand their ground and hiss at the bullies, meaning they have inherited their mother's prowess and bravery. Before the cheetah brothers can do anything, a passing elephant chases them away \u2013 meaning that in the savanna, even bullies get bullied.\nSome time later, the river has lessened. Kali and his largest son take advantage of it so they can cross and begin their assault on the River pride. They head towards the southern territory. Fang, upon seeing them approaching, runs for his life, but Layla does not back away \u2013 knowing that Mara could be killed should the assault succeed, she fearlessly attacks the rivals. Soon, the other lionesses, inspired by Layla's courage, join in the fight. Kali and his son are defeated and leave the area, though they remain on the southern side of the river.

They soon discover television sets through which their nemesis, Rickshaw, whom the group thought Charge had defeated some time ago, explains to them that he has staged a game all across town with innocents' lives at stake, and that he has also taken away their powers. To prove this, he executes a civilian near Cutthroat's location, then instructs the heroes to head to a meeting ground. Once there, the four have a brief personal reunion, in which the group realizes that Charge still retains some of his abilities, before Rickshaw interrupts them, giving them new orders. Charge assumes command of the group almost unanimously, with the exception of Cutthroat, who appears disgruntled with the others' decision.\nThe group finds themselves in a hardware store, where Rickshaw instructs each of them to choose a weapon, then divides them into teams of two and orders them to a deathmatch with two of his goons in different parts of the town; Charge and Cutthroat head off to the lumber mill, while The Wall and Shadow go to the scrap yard. In the mill, Charge and Cutthroat find a group of civilians strapped to explosives with the fuse already lit, and Charge faces Sledgesaw, a goon of Rickshaw's, while Cutthroat tries to defuse the explosives. Charge defeats his opponent and they succeed in cutting the fuse, only for Rickshaw to remotely detonate the device moments after Charge saves Cutthroat and himself by pulling him away from the civilians. While surveying the wreckage, Cutthroat laments in his inability to save the civilians, stating that if he had his power of super speed, he could have saved them.\nMeanwhile, in the scrap yard, The Wall and Shadow are attacked by Manpower, who wields a flamethrower against them. Once it runs out of fuel, The Wall charges him, only to be promptly taken down without his superpower (presumably some form of invincibility, which also renders him immune to physical pain). Shadow tries to help, but without her own power of invisibility, she is unable to prevent Manpower from stabbing The Wall in the stomach. Just as he turns to her, Charge and Cutthroat arrive and defeat Manpower. Charge then informs the group that The Wall only has moments to live, as his wounds are not treatable. He instructs Shadow, who presumably had an intimate relationship with him, to stay with The Wall until the end while he explains to Cutthroat that he has a plan to defeat Rickshaw and that Rickshaw does not care if they win or not, but will execute civilians merely to affect them; he is proven right when, moments after The Wall's death, he executes the trapped civilians and then gives the group the coordinates for a new, \"Bonus Round\".\nThe group arrives at a cabin where three civilians are held, and they discover three coffins with their names on them, as well as a single gun. Rickshaw appears and tells them that he will spare a civilian for each of them that commits suicide at their respective coffin, but Charge takes the gun and executes the hostages himself, much to the others' horror. He argues that Rickshaw would kill them anyway, and that he did it so none of the others would be tempted to take their own lives. Cutthroat tells Shadow that he trusts Charge to have a plan, noting that \"...failure is just not an option to him.\" It is revealed through flashbacks that the four were close friends at some point, that Charge was the one who had urged the rest to become superheroes after they obtained their powers, and that Charge and Cutthroat were working as a team. It is also suggested that Charge and the Shadow had feelings for one another, but never acted on them. Rickshaw congratulates Charge on his actions, then orders them to head to a bar.\nOnce there, they find two guns next to the TV set.

He tells them to stay in their room, only for all of them (except Theodore) to escape to the casinos. Dave discovers his former supervisor Ian Hawke is working as the ship's safety monitor posing as a pelican, and is out to inform the captain if the Chipmunks and Chipettes stir up more trouble. The next day, Alvin decides to go para-sailing on a kite but the kite flies away with him and the other Chipmunks. Dave goes on a hang-glider to try to find them but Ian attempts to stop him, which results in them both ending up stranded in the Pacific Ocean.\nMeanwhile, the Chipmunks find an island and they sleep for the night. Dave enlists Ian's help to find the same island and begin looking for the Chipmunks. The next morning the Chipmunks go and find food and while doing so, an island castaway named Zoe shows up and sees the chipmunks for the first time.

Ben Jonson is preparing to enter the stage. The narrator offers to take the viewers into a different story behind the origin of Shakespeare's plays: \"one of quills and swords, of power and betrayal, of a stage conquered and a throne lost.\"\nJumping to Elizabethan London, Ben Jonson is running through the streets carrying a parcel and being pursued by soldiers. He enters the theatre called The Rose and hides the manuscripts he carries as the soldiers set fire to the theatre. Ben is detained at the Tower of London to face the questioning of puritanical Robert Cecil. The writings by Edward de Vere that Robert Cecil thought Ben had are not found on him.\nIn a flashback of five years, an adult Edward lives, disgraced and banished from court, in the last years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. The queen is old and in failing health, but, as she has remained unmarried, lacks an heir. The elderly Lord William Cecil, the Queen's primary adviser, and his son Robert manage the kingdom's affairs. A growing group of malcontent nobles gather at court, led by Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, who is widely believed to be Elizabeth's bastard son. The Cecils have secretly been planning to solve the succession crisis by offering the crown to Elizabeth's cousin, King James VI of Scotland; the idea of a foreign king inheriting the crown of the Tudors angers enough nobles that they begin to muster support for Essex to claim the throne when Elizabeth dies. Edward's young friend, Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton, is pledged to support Essex but Edward warns him against any rash action and that any move they make has to be managed carefully to avoid civil war.\nWhen Edward and Henry visit a public theatre to see a play written by Ben Jonson, Edward witnesses how a play can sway people, and thinks that it can be used to thwart the influence of the Cecils, who as devout Puritans reject theatre as the 'worship of false idols', with Queen Elizabeth concerning her successor. After the Cecils declare Ben's play illegal and arrest him, Edward arranges for his release and instructs him to stage a play he wrote and act as the author. The play, Henry V, galvanizes the people and even Ben, who had contemptuously dismissed Edward's skill as a writer as the passing fancy of a bored nobleman, is impressed. At curtain call, however, William Shakespeare, an actor and \"drunken oaf\", steps forward to be recognized as the author of the play.\nElizabeth accepts a gift that evokes a memory from forty years before, when the boy, Edward, performed in his own play, A Midsummer Night's Dream, as Puck. After the elder Earl of Oxford's death, the teenage Edward is entrusted as a ward to William Cecil and must write his plays secretly to avoid his guardian's ire. During this time, Edward kills a spying servant who had discovered his plays. William Cecil covers up the incident but forces Edward into a marriage with his daughter, Anne. However, Edward is infatuated with the queen and, after a brief time living on the continent, he begins an affair with Elizabeth. When the queen discovers she is pregnant with Edward's child, she tells William of her intention to marry him but he dissuades her and arranges for the child to be fostered into a noble family, as they had done in the past with Elizabeth's other bastards. Elizabeth ends her affair with Edward without telling him why. Angered, he has an affair with a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth and learns from her that he had fathered a child with the Queen. When Elizabeth learns of the affair, Edward is banished from court but not before learning the name of his illegitimate child: Henry Wriothesley, 3rd Earl of Southampton.\nBack in the adult Edward's time, despite Shakespeare's claim to his plays, Edward continues to provide Ben with plays which quickly become the thrill of London. Despite their unhappiness at the plays' popularity, the Cecils do not outlaw them because they fear the mob which might occur if they do. Ben becomes increasingly frustrated with his role as Edward's messenger and his own inability to match the brilliance of his plays. Later on, Shakespeare discovers that Edward is the real author and extorts him for money. He orders the construction of the Globe Theatre, where he bans Jonson's works from being performed, and claims Edward's plays as his own. Christopher Marlowe discovers Shakespeare's deal, and is later found with his throat slit. Jonson confronts Shakespeare and accuses him of murder. Edward and Essex, seeking to reduce Cecil's influence and to secure Essex's claim to succession, decide to force their way into the palace, against Cecil's wishes. Edward writes the play Richard III in order to incite hatred against Cecil and to summon a mob of Essex's supporters. Simultaneously, he would gain access to Elizabeth by sending her Venus and Adonis.\nThe plan is set to fail when a bitter Ben, angered by what he perceives as his own inadequacy as a writer and Shakespeare's unearned success, betrays the plan to Robert Cecil by informing him that Richard III will be played as a hunchback, a reference to Robert Cecil's own deformity. The mob is stopped at the Bridge, and Robert Devereux and Henry surrender in the palace courtyard when the soldiers fire on them from the parapet. Robert Cecil tells Edward that Elizabeth has had other illegitimate children, the first of whom was born during the reign of Bloody Mary when she was only sixteen and a virtual prisoner of her sister. William Cecil, already close to the future queen, hid the child and passed him off as the son of the Earl of Oxford, revealing Edward's parentage to him: he is the first of Elizabeth's bastard children. Horrified by the failure of his plan for the succession, the expected execution of his son and the knowledge that he committed incest with his own mother, Edward nevertheless visits the Queen in a private audience to beg her to spare Henry. Elizabeth agrees to spare Henry, but insists that Edward remain anonymous as the true author of \"Shakespeare's\" works. Henry is released while Essex is executed for his treason.\nAfter Elizabeth's death, James of Scotland succeeds as James I of England and retains Robert Cecil as his primary adviser. On his deathbed, Edward entrusts a parcel full of his writings to Ben to keep them away from the royal family. Ben at first refuses the task and confesses to Edward that he betrayed him to the Cecils. In an unexpected heart-to-heart between the two playwrights, Edward admits that, whenever he had heard the applause for his plays, he had always known they were celebrating another man but that he had always wanted to gain Ben's approval, as he had been the only one to know that he had been the author of the plays. Ben admits that he considers Edward to be the 'Soul of the Age' and promises to protect the plays and publish them when the time is right.\nAfter Edward's death, Ben's interrogation ends when he tells Robert Cecil hears that the Rose has been destroyed by fire and he had hidden the plays inside. As he is released, Robert instructs Ben to better Edward and wipe his memory from the world. Ben tells him that he would if he could but that it was impossible to do. Miraculously, Ben finds the manuscripts where he hid them in the ruins of the Rose. At a performance of a \"Shakespeare\" play performed at court, James I remarks to a visibly unhappy Robert that he is an avid theatre goer.\nReturning to the present day theatre, the narrator concludes the story by revealing the characters' fates: Robert Cecil remained the King's most trusted advisor, but never succeeded in banishing Edward's plays.

While planting the ICBM detector, the pair take rock samples which Anderson describes as feeling \"strange\". In the background, the camera captures a rock moving in a nearby crater. After returning to Liberty, the pair hear noises outside and the motion sensor camera captures a small rock moving nearby. Houston claims the noises are interference from the ICBM detector. The next day, Anderson finds a rock sample on the floor of Liberty despite having secured the samples. During their ICBM detector set-up, Anderson discovers footprints that lead them to a bloodstained and abandoned (but still functional) Soviet LK lander. Anderson explores a nearby crater, describing the ground as \"feeling softer\". Inside the crater, he finds a dead cosmonaut as well as a broken space helmet.

Walker feels something moving inside his spacesuit and is horrified as a spider-like creature crawls across the inside of his helmet; he disappears from view and Anderson finds him unconscious outside of Liberty. Walker later denies the events. A wound is discovered on his chest, and Anderson removes a Moon rock embedded within him.

The mission cameras capture a rock sample moving around in the interior of Liberty, revealing that the aliens are camouflaged as Moon rocks. Increasingly delusional, Walker attempts to destroy the cameras within Liberty with a hammer, but he accidentally damages other controls, causing Liberty to depressurize. Realizing the Soviet LK lander is their only source of oxygen, the pair travel to the LK lander in their Lunar rover. Walker becomes agitated, believing he should not leave the Moon because of the risk of spreading the infection to Earth, and causes the rover to crash. As the rover crashes, the camera catches glimpses of the large space rocks, which begin to grow legs similar to that of spiders.\nAnderson awakens and tracks Walker to a crater. Walker is pulled into the crater by the creatures. Anderson gives chase, but he is confronted by the aliens, and flees to the Soviet LK and uses its radio to contact USSR Mission Control, who connect him to the Department of Defense. The Deputy Secretary informs Anderson that they cannot allow him to return to Earth, admitting they are aware of the situation and incorrectly believe he is also infected.

Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" Later, Peppy capitalizes on the headline by auditioning as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from studio boss Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry. With a little guidance from Valentin, who draws a beauty spot on her after finding her in his dressing room, Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, Tears of Love, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film Beauty Spot and the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately, audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, while only a few people (including Peppy herself) attend Valentin's. With Valentin ruined, his wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the nitrate film quickly blazes out of control, he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued, Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to remind Valentin of his changing luck.\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that Peppy had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a musical together.\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me just one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure,\" revealing a French accent.

During drunken revelries later, Saamy reveals to Thirthapathi that he actually does love his brother, and that all the anger and hate is just an act.\nMeanwhile, Thirthapathi exposes the illegal activities of a cattle smuggler (R. K.). The smuggler loses his animal farm and is taken into custody by the police. Saamy brings Thenmozhi to Thirthapathi's house to introduce them to each other. Unfortunately, Walter recognizes Thenmozhi as Thirthapathi's enemy's daughter, although Saamy was unaware of this. When Thirthapathi tells him to break up with her, Saamy refuses and attacks him verbally. He tells him that he would not understand, having no family of his own, and that no one loves him. An angered Thirthapathi throws out Saamy. Walter defends his brother and is also thrown out. Thirthapathi gets extremely drunk.\nLater that evening, both brothers make up with Thirthapathi and invite him to their home. Thirthapathi even willingly signs over his land to Thenmozhi's father, who has been trying to get a hold of it. He also organizes their marriage. A few days later, the smuggler returns, kidnaps Thirthapathi, strips him naked in the rain and flogs him into unconsciousness before hanging him to death from a tree. Walter and Saamy are devastated.

It is revealed that she lost her fianc\u00e9 in the First World War and that she \"hunts\" ghosts in an attempt to see if it is possible to bring him back. She receives a visit from Robert Mallory (Dominic West), a teacher from a boys' boarding school in Cumbria that had been a private home until 20 years earlier. Robert explains that there have been sightings of the ghost of a child at the school and that such a sighting might have been the cause of the recent death of a pupil. Although Florence initially refuses to help Robert investigate, his concern for the children at the boarding school - whom he describes as being almost like orphans - causes her to change her mind, since she is an orphan herself.\nAt the school, she meets Maud Hill (Imelda Staunton), the housekeeper, who tells Florence that she has read her books. After she conducts an investigation on her first night at the school, Florence comes to the conclusion that the sightings are the result of a prank, as two pupils had bullied a third into dressing as a ghost. With regard to the recent death, one of the teachers admits that he had forced the deceased pupil to stand outside the school in order to toughen him up after he claimed to have seen the ghost, thus scaring the young boy and causing him to have a fatal asthma attack. The school then closes for half-term with the only occupants being Florence, Robert, Maud, and Tom (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), a pupil whose parents live in India.\nHer job done, Florence prepares to leave. Down at the lake, she drops her cigarette case, which belonged to her lover. As she reaches for it, a hand reaches for her from the water. She steadies herself but then allows herself to fall into the lake. Robert rescues her; although Florence assures them it was an accident, he and Maud become concerned about her mental health. Indeed, Florence decides to remain at the school. After chasing what she believes to be the ghost, she sees an apparition of a man with a shotgun, who appears to shoot her. She also hears a child calling \"Mowa Zee,\" which she tells Tom was the nickname a group of Africans gave to her after she was rescued from the lion that orphaned her as a child. After growing closer, Florence and Robert have sex. But Edward Judd (Joseph Mawle), the groundskeeper who has a grudge against Robert for being a war hero, becomes jealous and attempts to rape Florence in the woods. Assisted by a supernatural apparition, she kills Judd in self-defence. She then returns to the school and tells Robert, who leaves to bury Judd and thus to cover up the incident. Florence asks Robert not to tell Tom what happened, but Robert tells her that there are no children at the school.\nFlorence then realises that Tom is the ghost who is haunting the school. Buried memories begin to surface, and she remembers that her family lived at the boarding school when it was a home. As a child, she watched her father murder her mother with a shotgun before he attempted to kill her too. Florence hid inside the walls of the house as her father pursued her, calling out for his \"little Mousy.\" Aiming for her, her father instead killed Tom, who is revealed to have been his illegitimate son. Her father then killed himself while Florence watched. Traumatised, Florence had replaced these memories with memories of a childhood in Africa. Back in the present, Florence learns that Robert can see the ghosts of his friends who died in the war, and she comes to the conclusion that ghosts reveal themselves to those who are very lonely. She also learns that Maud was her nanny as a child, as well as the mother of Tom. Maud explains that she arranged for Florence to come to the school in the first place because Tom missed her. Maud then poisons herself and Florence, intending for their ghosts to join Tom. Florence tells Tom that her soul will not rest if she dies now, so Tom brings her medicine.\nThe following scene shows Florence walking throughout the school. She passes by several adults on her way out, but none notices her. Florence catches up with Robert and shares a cigarette with him. Florence explains that being unable to see ghosts anymore is not the same as forgetting them. She then asks Robert to tell their driver to pull up at the end of the drive since she has always enjoyed the walk, and that she will see him on Saturday week.

Carrie and Taylor sprout their wings and attempt to stop the Princess from taking Ken, but the portal to Gloss Angeles closes before they can enter it. The stylists attempt to dissuade Raquelle and Barbie of the fact that they just saw fairies but finally admit their existence. They explain that Ken is in trouble because if a human marries a fairy, the human has to stay in Gloss Angeles forever. Meanwhile, in Gloss Angeles, Ken and the Princess arrive in the royal palace, where they meet Zane, Graciella's boyfriend. Zane is outraged at Graciella's new love interest and challenges Ken to three consecutive duels.\nBarbie, Raquelle, and the fairies go to a clothing store, where they enter a Fairy Flyway (a fairy method of transport), which leads them to the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The fairies reveal that Lilianna Roxelle, a world-famous fashion critic, is the oldest and wisest fairy living on Earth. After they arrive at Lilianna's home, she informs them that Princess Graciella is under a love potion spell. She gives Barbie an antidote that will turn the Princess back to normal if it rains down on her. It is also revealed that Taylor and Carrie were banished from Gloss Angeles earlier due to some personal reasons. The girls then take Liliana's portal to continue their journey.\nBarbie, Raquelle, Taylor, and Carrie make it to Gloss Angeles and they make a stop at Wings and Things in order to get wings for Barbie and Raquelle where they run into the human owner named Reena and her fairy husband Graylon. They then disguise themselves as cooks to try to reveal Princess Graciella about Crystal's love potion; however, Crystal reveals Taylor and Carrie by recognizing Taylor's shoes, and the princess locks the four in furyspheres. Barbie and Raquelle talk and finally figure out their misunderstanding. The reason Raquelle has always been so mean to Barbie is that she never got the chance to be Barbie's friend. They apologize to each other and become friends. Their reconciliation breaks the furyspheres and their wings become real, and they now realize that forgiveness lets them fly. The two then go to stop the wedding between Graciella and Ken, holding off the attendants and the princess. Finally, Barbie pours the antidote over Graciella, curing her of the love potion. Graciella realizes that it was Crystal who gave her the love potion and apologizes for the misunderstanding. She also explains that the reason she banished Taylor and Carrie is that the three of them were once friends but Taylor and Carrie started spending so much time together that she felt left out and betrayed. At the urging of Barbie and Raquelle, she lifts Taylor and Carrie's ban, and the three fairies forgive each other. Graciella then punishes Crystal by having her clean up after the ceremony and goes to marry Zane.\nAfter the wedding, Graciella tells Barbie and Raquelle that their wings will disappear when they and Ken go back to the human world and then reappear when they return to Gloss Angeles. She also tells them that their memories of their adventures here will be erased since Raquelle cannot keep a secret. Graciella sends them back to Earth with magical dust. The next morning, Barbie wakes up with no recollection of Gloss Angeles or the fairies, thinking it was a dream. However, she and Raquelle are now friends.

Gordon tries to focus on purging corruption from the Gotham City Police Department after witnessing his partner, Detective Arnold John Flass, abuse his power as a cop. Unfortunately, several officers led by Flass beat him on the orders from his corrupt superior, Commissioner Gillian Loeb. In revenge, Gordon tracks Flass down, beats him, and leaves him naked and handcuffed in the snow.\nBruce believes he is still unprepared to fight against crime despite having the skills he learned from abroad.

Los Angeles is evacuated while Marines from Camp Pendleton arrive, including Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz, an Iraq War veteran. Nantz, who was to begin his retirement, is assigned to the 1st Platoon, Echo Company, of the 2nd Battalion, 5th Marines.\nUnder the command of 2nd Lieutenant William Martinez, the platoon arrives at a forward operating base (FOB) established at Santa Monica Airport. The alien ground forces while using rapid dominance have no apparent air support, so the Air Force prepares a carpet bombing of the Santa Monica area, and the platoon is given 3 hours to retrieve civilians from a police station. As they advance through Los Angeles, they are ambushed and suffer multiple casualties. Nantz takes marines Imlay and Harris to look for Lenihan, who is missing from the group. After fighting off an alien, they team up with some soldiers from the Army's 40th Infantry Division and an Air Force intelligence Technical Sergeant, Elena Santos. At the police station, the makeshift platoon finds five civilians: veterinarian Michele, children Kirsten, Amy and Hector, and Hector's father Joe. A helicopter arrives to evacuate wounded marines, but cannot take on the weight of the civilians. During takeoff, it is destroyed by alien air units, killing Grayston, Guerrero, Lenihan, and Simmons.\nThe marines commandeer an abandoned transit bus for the evacuation. En route, they deduce that the alien air units are drones that target human radio transmissions; Santos reveals that her mission is to locate and destroy the aliens' command center controlling the drones. When their bus comes under attack by aliens on an elevated freeway, the marines rappel the group to street level. In the ensuing battle, marines Stavrou and Mottola and the remainder of the California Army National Guard soldiers are killed, while both Joe and Lieutenant Martinez are wounded fighting the aliens. Martinez uses his radio to attract the aliens, then detonates explosives, sacrificing himself for his team. Nantz is now in command of surviving personnel Santos, Imlay, Kerns, Lockett, Harris, Adukwu and the civilians, continuing their escape from the bombing zone. A scientist speculates on news media that the aliens seek Earth's water resources for fuel while exterminating the human population.\nThe planned carpet bombing fails to materialize. Reaching the FOB, the marines find it destroyed and the military in retreat from the city. The marines plan to escort the civilians to an alternate extraction point. When Joe dies from his wounds, Nantz comforts Hector. Lockett confronts Nantz regarding his brother, a Marine who, with four others, was killed during Nantz's last tour. They come to peace when Nantz explains that he continues to think of them, and recites each one's name, rank and serial number. Nantz motivates the group to move forward to honor their fallen comrades, including Joe for his bravery. They reach the extraction point and evacuate by a helicopter.\nIn flight, the chopper experiences a brief loss of power. Nantz theorizes that they are flying near the alien command center, transmitting intense radio messages to its drones. He orders his unit to accompany the civilians while he stays to reconnoiter the area, but his fighters all join him. Searching through sewers, they confirm the presence of a large alien vessel. Kerns radios in to request missiles, which Nantz manually directs using a laser designator while the others defend his position.

When Anna asks what they are to call him, Abraham replies, \"Call me 'Pa.'\"\nDecades later, in 1960, an adult Ingrid (Carice van Houten) is swimming against the current near the Cape Town suburb of Clifton when she starts to go under. Hearing her cries, a man on shore (Liam Cunningham) dives into the water to save her. They reach the shore, and he introduces himself as novelist Jack Cope. Overjoyed, Ingrid says she has read his novel. Jack asks how she liked it. She replies that his novel saved her life. Jack is stunned to hear that she is \"the poet Ingrid Jonker.\"\nHer sister Anna interrupts to say their father is waiting for her. Abraham tells Ingrid that her estranged husband, Pieter Venter, asked for a ride to her house. Ingrid says that she and Pieter have nothing in common. In the flat Ingrid and her infant daughter share with Anna, Pieter pleads for another chance. Jack calls to invite Ingrid to a party with his literary bohemian friends. Ingrid refuses Pieter and goes to the party. There, a black writer says that the Censorship Board has banned his unpublished novel and the police have confiscated the manuscript. He laments four years of his life gone to waste.\nJack and Ingrid drive the writer to the black township of Nyanga. On the way, they are stopped by a white cop, who tries to give the writer trouble. The writer tells Jack that Ingrid's father, Abraham Jonker, represents the White Supremacist National Party in Parliament and is the Chair of the Censorship Board which banned his novel. Jack says Ingrid isn't like her father. Jack and Ingrid go to his flat, where he tells her he has two children and is going through an ugly divorce. Ingrid shows him a poem she wrote in his honor, and Jack is moved. He asks why she wrote it, and she says his novel saved her life. They become lovers.\nLater, Jack tells her he is madly in love with her and asks her and her daughter to move in with him. She accepts. However, Jack refuses to marry her. Although Ingrid continues to write, Jack eventually says he is unable to write and says that constantly emotionally supporting Ingrid \"drains\" him. He decides to visit his sons and their mother for two or three months in order to finish his novel. Although Jack promises to return, Ingrid is distraught at the idea of being apart for so long and begs him not to go. She quits her job to see him off at the train station, where she asks him to stay or take her with him. Jack leaves. Ingrid is shown having a secret abortion.\nJack calls to tell Ingrid that he will be away for another month. Soon after, she meets novelist Eugene Maritz (based on Andr\u00e9 Brink). Eugene is a fan of Ingrid's poetry, and poet and playwright Uys Krige lauds Maritz as the great hope of Afrikaans literature. Out of both anger and desperate loneliness over Jack's absence, Ingrid seduces Maritz. Jack returns to find Maritz's shoes in his closet and kicks Ingrid out.\nIngrid and Jack witness the police shoot at a car, killing a black child. The horror of this motivates Ingrid to write her most famous poem, Die Kind, which calls the child a martyr and subtly prophesies that one day Apartheid will end.\nMeanwhile, Abraham Jonker is depicted as a tyrannical man who withholds validation and affection from his daughter and who is enraged by her political dissent against Apartheid, her friendships with dissident writers whose work he bans, and her own poetry. When Ingrid asks Abraham to read her Anti-Apartheid poem Die Kind, Abraham reads only part of it and rips it up.\nIngrid's interpersonal issues with her father and the love triangle with Jack and Eugene lead her into major depression and psychosis. She is committed to Valkenberg Hospital, where Jack visits her and learns about Ingrid's secret termination of their unborn child. He asks why she did not tell him. She says he would have married her only for that reason. Ingrid tells him the hospital took all her poems, but she still has them in her head. Jack finds a pocketbook full of poems in the box of her belongings and is deeply impressed. Taking the poems with him, Jack and Uys Krige feverishly work to compile them into the poetry book Rook an Ochre (\"Smoke and Ochre\"). After Ingrid is released, the book is accepted by a publisher. She dedicates the book to Jack and Uys.\nThe book is well reviewed and nominated for the prestigious APB Award. Ingrid is able to go to Europe for the first time. Before leaving, she visits her father at work to give him the news and ask him to accompany her. Her father tells her he wanted to ban her book and only did not do so because his subordinates told him it would cause a scandal. Seething with hatred, Abraham brings up Ingrid's promiscuity and denounces his daughter as \"a slut\". Abraham says he never wants to see Ingrid again.\nIngrid asks Jack to accompany her to Europe, but he says the government would not issue him a passport because of his political views. She invites Eugene, and he accepts. During the trip, he finds her writing a poem about her love for Jack and is furious. He tells her he is returning to South Africa early. Ingrid performs another abortion on herself and is hospitalized in Paris. The hospital calls her father to ask for permission to conduct electroconvulsive shock therapy. He gives his permission.\nAfter returning to Cape Town, Ingrid is no longer able to write and no longer smiles. She goes to Jack's home one night and gives him her AFB medal along with a Walt Whitman poem as a statement of her love for him.

When Nesib wins he forces Amar to agree to a peace pact: the Yellow Belt will belong to neither, becoming a no-man's-land between their territories, and Emir Nesib will take Sultan Amar's sons, Saleh and Auda, as hostages. Amar reluctantly agrees, knowing the hostages are a sacred trust which binds Nesib as well. They both swear to the pact before God. Nesib promises to rear Amar's sons with his own children, Tariq and Leyla.\nSaleh, Amar's eldest son, is a free spirit interested in the traditional pursuits of an Arab emir, while Auda is an avid reader. Leyla and Auda become good friends, until they are separated at adolescence. Ten years pass. Auda (Tahar Rahim) is still a voracious reader, while Saleh (Akin Gazi) longs to go home and be with his father.\nSam Thurkettle (Corey Johnson), an American geologist working for the western \"Texan Oil\" company, surveys the Yellow Belt and is convinced there is high-grade crude oil under its shale. He tells Nesib that the find will make him richer than the King of England, and Nesib is more than willing to listen; he has had to watch, powerless and penniless, as his people suffered a cholera epidemic and his own wife died from it. Nesib allows Thurkettle's company to extract oil from the Yellow Belt \u2013 thus violating his peace pact with Sultan Amar.\nMoney pours in and Nesib starts to modernize his kingdom with schools, hospitals, and electricity. He makes his son Tariq a Colonel, appoints Auda his national librarian, and sends an envoy to Amar to strike a deal to extract oil from the Yellow Belt. But desert tribesmen attack one of the oil sites and kill the crew. Their revenues threatened, Nesib sets about inducing the various tribes to accept the oil extraction, using lavish gifts and gold as inducements.\nThe envoy sent to Amar returns and reports to Nesib: Amar considers the exploitation of Yellow Belt a violation of their treaty. Saleh tells Auda that he can convince their father and decides to escape; he kills his guards while making his escape. He is caught, but Ibn Idris kills him in revenge for killing the guards, who were Ibn Idris's cousins.\nDesperate to maintain the oil revenues, Nesib executes a brilliant political maneuver: he marries Auda to his daughter Leyla (Freida Pinto). At one stroke he has converted Auda's position from hostage to family member, thereby dissolving his pact with Amar and absolving himself from his religious oath. Auda reluctantly agrees, knowing it is a plot to prevent Amar from attacking Nesib. Nesib decides to send Auda to convince Amar into extracting oil from the yellow belt. Auda meets Amar, who is surprised to learn that Auda has come as a representative of Nesib. Auda learns more about his father during his stay there. Amar tells Auda that Nesib offered 5%, then 35% of the earnings but he refused the offer. Nesib has even promised to give back Amar's sons as some kind of property value. When Auda tries to explain to him, he says that everything in his home is made either out of blood or love, but not money and that money has no value. The following day a meeting is held with Amar's allies. They say that by letting foreigners extract oil, they let themselves and their culture be destroyed. Auda unsuccessfully argues by saying if God had not meant for them to use it, he wouldn't have put it in their soil.\nAmar sends an envoy, Hassan Dakhil, to Nesib offering to cease all hostilities if Nesib agrees to shut down the oil wells and expel the foreigners. Nesib refuses and makes a counter offer to Hassan Dakhil. Later Amar receives a message from Hassan that seemingly indicates that Hassan has defected to Nesib. Following this setback, Amar makes a plan to send all of his prisoners into the desert with weapon props to act as decoys, in order to lure Nesib's army into the desert by while Amar takes his real army to capture Nesib's city, Hobeika. He offers the leadership of the decoy army to Auda. Auda protests, objecting that to send the prisoners into the desert would mean certain death, but in the face of his father's disapproval he reluctantly agrees and ventures out, accompanied by his half brother Ali, a doctor, who does not seem to share their father's xenophobic mindset. The plan works and Nesib sends six armored cars after them. However the heavy cars are stuck in the sands and Auda's men are able to overpower their occupants, though not without heavy losses. The camel carrying the carrier pigeons is killed and the pigeons escape. One of them manages to make it way back to Salmaah. The blood on the pigeon along with the absence of a written message leads Amar to believe that there have been no survivors. When the armored cars fail to return, Nesib sends a plane with Tariq on board to reconnoiter. Auda sets another decoy, having his men lie down and play dead around a destroyed armored car. When Tariq lands to investigate, Auda's men swarm him. Tariq manages to make it back to the plane, but Auda's men force it down. Auda finds his body in the ensuing wreckage and is overcome with remorse at all the needless deaths. He rallies the remaining prisoners and offers to divide the remaining water between them and set them free. The prisoners decide to follow Auda, who leads them to the sea believing that they would find water there, based from what he had heard from a dying camel rider.\nThe army, now Auda's army, finally arrive at the sea but are disheartened to find no fresh water, until Ali finds an underwater spring. Having refilled their water skins, the army moves away and comes upon a Beni Sirri slaver tribe. Auda leads a small group of men to meet the Sheikh of Beni Sirri tribe and during the meeting the Sheikh beats Aicha (Liya Kebede), a slave girl, brutally. The Sheikh seemingly holds the slave's Zamiri tribe in derision as the Zamiri are one of the few tribes that allow women the same freedoms that are given to men. Auda tries to protest and offers to buy the slave girl in exchange for his mother's ring, who belonged to the same tribe as the slave girl. An argument ensues, and the Sheikh reveals that Nesib has already bought the loyalty of the Beni Sirri and that they intended to kill him in exchange of a reward. The rest of Auda's men launch a surprise attack, surrounding and overwhelming the Beni Sirri, leaving Auda to handcuff and disgrace the leaders of Beni Sirri tribe and freeing the slaves. To add insult to injury, Ali relieves the sheikh of the gold watch given to him by Nesib at Auda's wedding. In gratitude for freeing the slaves, the other tribes pledge their own resources to Auda. Aicha offers to lead Auda back to her own tribe in order to enlist their aid. However Auda is mistakenly shot by one of the tribe and seems to have been killed, only to revive in the middle of his own funeral rites. Ali realizes that Auda's condition had in fact been a medical phenomenon known as mors putativa in which a head trauma induces all the symptoms of death. However the tribals believe that Auda has been revived from death in the manner of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and that he is the leader foretold in the legends of the Zamiri tribe. Ali, despite knowing the true nature of Auda's injuries, does nothing to dissuade this notion. The Zamiri tribe now rallies around Auda as their leader. One of Nesib's planes manages to track them down and opens fire. The tribals manage to shoot down the plane, but not before it fatally wounds Ali. Auda administers his last rites as Ali lies dying in his arms. With his last breath Ali makes Auda promise to 'overturn the chessboard' in effect asking him to depose both Amar and Nessib, thereby putting an end to the conflict.\nAuda rides with his army to the gates of Nessib's city. Amar arrives and meets Auda, who reveals that he has united all the other tribes and intends to keep the Yellow Belt for them. Amar reveals that Nesib has agreed to Amar's conditions and demands that Auda turn over his army to Amar. During the discussion, Amar is shot dead by the sheikh of the Beni Sirri tribe, who had in fact been aiming for Auda. Auda's army is outraged, believing that Nessib had double crossed them and tried to kill Auda during the negotiations. Nessib's army commander realizes that with Amar dead, there is nothing to stop Auda from attacking. As the shells rain down, Auda gives up any hope for talks and leads his army to sweep over Nessib's defenses. Though Nessib has superior weaponry, the combined might of all the tribes in Auda's army overwhelms them by sheer numbers.\nAuda is knocked off his horse by a stray shell and beset upon by the Beni Sirri sheikh. The sheikh easily defeats him at close quarters combat and mocks him, asking whether Auda learned to fence 'in a library'. Just before the sheikh can land the killing blow, Aicha stabs him in the back and saves Auda. Learning about the developments, Nesib abdicates the throne in favor of his only remaining child, Leyla. Auda, through his marriage to Leyla is now ruler of both kingdoms. In the city, Auda's forces find Hassan in the dungeons, indicating that he had never betrayed Amar, but had instead been held prisoner by Nesib. Auda walks into the library where he finds Nesib, who compliments him on his achievements and asks what Auda intends to do. Auda replies that unlike his father, he does not dislike foreigners and that he believes that they have much to offer each other. On being questioned by Auda about what to do with Nessib, he admits that if he were in Auda's place he would have had him killed, quickly and painlessly. Auda instead opts to send him to Houston to sit on the Board of Directors of the oil companies, where he can protect the interests of their people. Auda offers him a backhanded compliment saying that 'he can't think of anyone more cunning' than Nesib to fill the role and that the oil company people 'deserve him'.

After years of raising horses and living a solitary life, Blackthorn sets off for Potos\u00ed to sell his horses. He tells his lover, Yana (Magaly Solier), that he will see her again before leaving Bolivia.\nAt Potos\u00ed, Blackthorn withdraws his savings from the bank, sells his horses, and then heads back to his village. Along the way, he is ambushed and nearly killed. He shoots his attacker, but not before Blackthorn's horse, Cinco, bolts off with his money. The shooter is Eduardo Apodaca (Eduardo Noriega), a Spaniard mining engineer who claims he was shooting at pursuers. He begs Blackthorn to save him, and offers to share part of the $50,000 he stole from Sim\u00f3n Pati\u00f1o, a powerful Bolivian industrialist and mine owner. The money is hidden in an abandoned mine, and he will compensate Blackthorn for his help.\nBlackthorn and the Spaniard set out across the desert plateau with Pati\u00f1o's posse within a day's pursuit. They reach the abandoned mine and find the money, but the posse catches up with them. Following a shootout, Blackthorn and the Spaniard escape with the money. They make their way to Blackthorn's cabin, where the famous outlaw remembers his old friendships with the Sundance Kid and Etta Place, and how they escaped from Pinkerton Detective Mackinley (Stephen Rea). Yana joins the men at the cabin, and Blackthorn gives her a pocket watch he won in a card game. At first she rejects it as a \"gringo machine\", but then accepts the gift as something to remember him by.  Despite his asking her to spend one last night with him, she advises she must return to her own family.  Later that night, Yana returns to the cabin to stay with Blackthorn on his last night before leaving.\nThe next morning, two female members of the posse come to the cabin looking for the Spaniard, and in the ensuing gunfight, Blackthorn is wounded, and Yana is killed. A heartbroken Blackthorn and the Spaniard leave with the rest of the posse not far behind. They set out across the Uyuni salt flats, hoping to reach the coast where Blackthorn can find a boat to take him home.

Mackinley confirms the man's identity. For years Mackinley claimed that the two bandits killed at San Vincente were not Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and now he will finally be proven correct. But after initially notifying the Bolivian army of the discovered outlaw, Mackinley changes his mind, returns Blackthorn's pistol, and helps him escape. When Mackinley later discovers that Blackthorn was involved with the Spaniard, he reveals the truth to him about the Spaniard and his pursuers. Apparently, the $50,000 the Spaniard stole was not from the powerful mine owner, Pati\u00f1o, but from the mining families who recently took control of the mines. The Spaniard stole the money from \"the people\"\u2014something Butch Cassidy would never have done.

To his surprise he finds an unlikely ally in the hot-headed, gruff Detective Sergeant Tom Brant (Jason Statham), who has a history of violent incidents.\nWhile the investigation is ongoing, PC Elizabeth Falls (Zawe Ashton) is visited by a friend, a young gang member nicknamed Metal, who is afraid his gang might have actually killed someone. Promising him to look into the situation, Falls contacts Detective Inspector Craig Stokes (Luke Evans), who agrees to help if Falls goes on a date with him.\nOne of Brant's informants, Radnor (Ned Dennehy), points Brant and Nash towards a man named Barry Weiss (Aidan Gillen) who recently bragged about setting a police dog on fire, \"for practice\". Although Brant and Nash visit Weiss' flat, they cannot immediately find any evidence against him. Brant recognises Weiss as the man he beat up in a fight in a billiard hall a year earlier. Unknown to either of them, Radnor decides to conduct an investigation of his own and eventually discovers the seemingly abandoned car where Weiss keeps the trophies of his kills, confirming that Weiss is the killer.\nMeanwhile, Weiss contacts a newspaper reporter, Harold Dunlop (David Morrissey), to make sure his murders get enough coverage in the press. Weiss promises to keep Dunlop updated about his murders and declares he wishes to be known as Blitz. Soon after, Dunlop is also contacted by Radnor who is interested in selling his information for a high price. Although Radnor leads Dunlop to Weiss' car, he is killed by Weiss before he can disclose Weiss' name. Dunlop then alerts the police to the car, but they find it empty.\nBrant and a fellow police constable come to realize that all of Blitz's victims so far have been police officers who have arrested Weiss in the past and that PC Falls is most likely the next victim. Falls, after coming home from her date with Stokes, is attacked by Weiss but saved by Metal, who is killed in the ensuing struggle. Before Weiss can attack Falls again, the police arrive.\nBrant and Nash decide to release a picture of Weiss to the media to flush him out, which eventually, after a lengthy chase, leads to Weiss' capture. There is no concrete evidence against Weiss however, so after 48 hours and an interrogation which does not yield results, the police are forced to let Weiss go. Exasperated, Brant and Nash devise a plot to trick Weiss, knowing that Weiss will want to take revenge on Brant for the billiard hall fight.\nWeiss infiltrates the funeral of Chief Inspector Roberts, dressed in Roberts' uniform which he had stolen after murdering him. During the service, Brant leaves, followed by Weiss. Brant leads Weiss to the top of a parking garage, only to reveal that Brant and Nash had switched places along the route. Surprised by a hidden Brant, Weiss is mercilessly beaten, overpowered and relieved of his gun. Explaining that they will never find enough evidence to convict Weiss legally, Brant concludes that they are now in a convenient situation: since Weiss is dressed as a police officer, and Brant has Blitz's gun, they can shoot him with his own gun, and it will look as if Weiss was just another of Blitz's victims.\nAfter Weiss is killed, Brant sets the dogs free on Dunlop to chase him for writing articles against him and the police for coverage.", "tmdb_plot": "A tough cop is dispatched to take down a serial killer who has been targeting police officers.", "tmdb_id": "55846", "wiki_id": "27193032"}, {"title": "Blubberella", "genres": ["Horror", "Action", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "In the year 1940, Blubberella is an obese vampire/human hybrid with a hatred of Adolf Hitler, and a soft spot for food.

This and his lack of commitment to the trucking company is a point of contention between him and his father.\nDuring a pick up game, Rajveer tries out for the Hammerheads (a league team) but despite being the best player on the ice, the coach gives him the cold shoulder. Feeling slighted, Rajveer decides to create a league team with his friends.\nDarvesh disapproves of the idea and forbids Rajveer from playing any more hockey, but Rajveer continues to play with his friends secretly, saying he's working more routes at the trucking company.

The story appears to encompass a roughly two week period leading up to his parole hearing, during which time he starts a trial month employed as a mortuary attendant, a job being an important qualification for parole. Kogler, appears in every scene, and the narrative arc concerns his emotional awakening, explored in the actor's facial expressions and postures, reinforced by visual symbolism and a sparse dialogue with other characters. Initially sullen, he's isolated from his fellow inmates, from the probation counselor who tries earnestly to help him, from the guards and from his new co-workers. As Roman endures stubbornly, with the passive, stoic indifference to his own fate of the truly hopeless, and as he begins to learn his new job, small events seem to awaken emotions in Kogler, leading to a new interest in understanding his own past and in the possibility of sympathetic relationships.\nThe first scene introduces Roman Kogler as he is interviewing for a job in a metal-working factory, and he is lying about his welding skills to the foreman. When the foreman moves to place a welder's mask on his face, he jumps back, uttering a stifled scream. Next, we see a bleak and empty roadway stretching off to an empty horizon; after a few moments, a car approaches on the left and Kogler appears from behind the camera, walking determinedly away at the right edge of the pavement, no reachable destination in sight. The car, having made a U-turn out of sight, returns to view and stops ahead blocking Kogler's progress and Kogler gets in the car, slamming the passenger door twice. The car is driven by Walter Fakler, Kogler's probation counselor, who has come to fetch Kogler after the disaster at the metalworking job. Sullen and laconic, Kogler is quietly, resentfully defiant with the earnest, exasperated Fakler. Returning Kogler to prison, Fakler hands him a newspaper, and admonishes him to look through the want ads, warning Kogler that he will expect to meet with him on Monday. \nThe movie proceeds through a series of glimpses of institutionalized routine. Returned to prison, we see Kogler disrobe and endure the ritualized strip search, which is apparently required at each re-entrance, administered with curt, routine efficiency by a uniformed officer and his assistant. This strip search is repeated twice more in the film with slight variations in the dialogue that further the story's progress. We see the end of the day along the prison hallway, as the solid steel doors of the cells are locked, and Kogler is left alone in his cell. The one recreational activity the audience is shown is a visit of the juvenile prisoners to an indoor swimming pool; Roman dives in and swims laps, ignoring and ignored by the other prisoners -- this scene, too, will be repeated twice more with variations. Every work day, he commutes by train into Vienna, passing an ad that shows a woman in a South Sea paradise which reads: \"Tauchen Sie ein Ins Abenteuer! (\"Dive Into Adventure!\").\nThe mortuary where he works is apparently Vienna's giant Bestattung Wien (Funeral Vienna), where he and his co-workers are involved in transporting corpses from place-of-death and from morgue to cemetery in a large-scale, routinized operation. Initially, he is tasked only with observing. In his first encounters with corpses, his disgust and horror is barely suppressed. One of his co-workers seems actively hostile at first. \nIn one scene, Roman is working alone in a small workroom, wearing coveralls, removing the cases used to transport corpses from an industrial steam cleaning machine, and a small bird startles him. He opens a door, squats down to let the bird free, and then follows it out; the door is labeled \"Notausgang\" (\"Emergency Exit\").\nAfter a chance encounter on the job with the naked corpse of a young woman who shares his surname, Roman seems to panic at the idea that this might be his mother, dead. Confirming that the corpse was not his mother leads Roman to locate his mother. He manages to find out where she lives and follows her into an IKEA store, where he sees her lying, like a corpse, on one of the beds. They later become re-acquainted and he tells her he's a diving instructor and soon heading to New Zealand (a reference to the subway advertisement). Back at her flat, he asks his mother why she gave him up and she tells him that it was the best thing she did in her life. She finds out his real occupation as an undertaker and confronts him after the end of his shift, outside the mortuary. She also confesses to him that the real reason that she gave Roman up was that, when he was a baby, she tried to suffocate him by placing a pillow over his face, to stop his crying.\nThe film ends with Roman leaving his parole hearing and visiting the grave of his teenage victim.", "tmdb_plot": "A 19-year-old is coming out of prison and trying to build a new life but he can't deal with his guilt.", "tmdb_id": "82941", "wiki_id": "32589867"}, {"title": "Bridesmaids", "genres": ["Comedy", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Annie Walker is a single underachieving down-on-her-luck woman in her mid-thirties living in Milwaukee.

After an indeterminate length of time the costumed man drives away and kills a woman he was holding captive by ripping her in half with chains attached to his truck.\nEventually, the Bunnyman returns and causes the group's car to crash, killing Jack a short while later when he rams the vehicle from behind as Jack is working underneath it. The remaining five proceed to travel on foot, encountering a deranged hillbilly, a woman called Melissa, and a man who advises them to seek shelter in a supposedly abandoned cabin nearby, saying they will return for them after a trip to the hospital. In reality, the two are disposing of the bodies of some of the Bunnyman's victims. On route to the cabin, two of the quintet spot the Bunnyman butchering bodies and he kills one of them with a chainsaw.\nChased to the cabin which belongs to the Bunnyman, the group loses two more members when Mike is killed with a chainsaw, and Tiffany is captured and tortured to death by the Bunnyman and his demented, hunchbacked accomplice, Pops. After the Bunnyman hacks Tiffany's body to pieces and sits down to eat her flesh with Pops and Melissa, the remaining two travelers, Rachel and John, are captured while trying to get Melissa's car keys. As Melissa prepares to murder a bound Rachel, John manages to free himself from his restraints, kills Melissa, and takes her keys and car.\nAs John and Rachel flee, they are chased by the Bunnyman's truck again. Concocting a plan the two pull over and John exits the vehicle carrying an unmoving Rachel who he offers to the Bunnyman. The Bunnyman hesitantly takes Rachel and places her in the cab of his truck, where she springs to life and stabs him in the neck with a pair of scissors, wounding him, and she kicks him out onto the road and driving away after John gets into the truck.

Sam reveals that he had unwittingly had an affair with a superior's wife (Chandra West) and that he was punished with a dangerous mission: to track down a terrorist group known as the Espada Ardiente and assess the need for American support against them.\nIn Colombia, Sam meets his new team, including Commandante Veracruz (Pedro Pascal), then goes to a local clinic to tell them that they're in danger only to be brushed off by the two employees, doctor Ben Delaney (RonReaco Lee) and charity worker Amanda Maples (Kiele Sanchez). Later, while scouting the area against orders, Sam discovers that Veracruz and his men are preparing to attack the clinic themselves and kill him to game the system for aid, so Sam sneaks off to the clinic to sound the alarm again, yet they still won't take his help. Thinking Sam has been kidnapped, Veracruz moves quickly to destroy the clinic but a local teenager, an orphan girl named Beatriz (Ilza Rosario), gets to the clinic early and tells Sam he's coming. Once he's convinced Ben and Amanda of the danger, Sam helps them get all the patients out and blow up the clinic as a distraction for the escape. Beatriz suggests hiding with her only friends, the Espada Ardiente, which works for Sam and his mission, especially since they have no alternative. Upon their arrival, Sam discovers that the Espada Ardiente is merely a small, but resilient, group of shepherds on a small farm that the corrupt Veracruz is trying to secure as a way-point for drug transportation. After watching them do very basic training and promising Amanda he won't leave them, Sam heads back to Veracruz's camp to call for support and stall long enough for help to arrive. Veracruz calls his bluff and almost forces him to reveal where the Espada Ardiente are hiding out, but the farmers give Sam a way out and he escapes back to them, where he apologizes and tells them how they can all help him stop Veracruz. Altogether, they then travel to a CIA outpost to ask for help, narrowly escaping a trap set by Veracruz along the road. They arrive to the isolated outpost and find its only use is observation, and is practically empty except for two men and some radio equipment, which they use to call for assistance. Sam is instructed that nothing will happen until he travels to the nearest military base first to detail the situation. Again, Sam promises he'll return and gets on the helicopter with the two men, but they admit nobody is coming until they go through the proper channels, and that the locals are essentially being left for dead in a \"compromised\" facility, giving Sam no choice except to force them to land at gunpoint.\nIn the present, the Admiral tips his hand that things are heading towards a trial, but Sam refuses a lawyer and continues his story.\nAt the outpost in Colombia, Sam strong-arms the CIA men into calling for backup, which won't arrive for three hours, leaving him and the others to hold off Veracruz as long as possible. Their odds get worse when reinforcements show up for Veracruz, and, despite their best efforts to block his path, eventually they run out of ammunition and must retreat back to the outpost. Still anticipating assistance, Sam has the guys call out again, birthing his alias \"Chuck Finley,\" and learns that they won't have enough time. Shortly thereafter, Veracruz arrives on scene, so Sam heads outside to buy his friends more time. They refuse to surrender to Sam and rough him up a bit before firing on the outpost, and then, the cavalry arrives to save the day. Once Veracruz and his forces are in custody, and all of Sam's friends have said their goodbyes, he is escorted back to the base to testify.\nThe Admiral evaluates the situation and threatens Sam with a court martial, but Sam has an ace up his sleeve: Beatriz, seeking redemption for influencing her friends to fight in the first place, has photographs of the entire operation and published them in Colombia's largest newspaper with his encouragement. He then strikes a graymail deal with Lawrence, promising to remain silent about the whole thing in exchange for the following: exoneration for all his friends; rebuild the clinic; leave the farmers alone to their herds; finally, for himself, an honorable discharge with full pension, a first-class plane ticket to the city of his choice (Miami), a change of clothes, and one ice-cold beer.", "tmdb_plot": "Before Sam Axe teamed up with Michael and Fiona, he was Commander Axe, U.S. Navy SEAL.

He witnesses the lemons, seemingly led by German weapons designer and scientist Professor Z\u00fcndapp, load an electromagnetic pulse generator, disguised as a TV camera onto a shipping crate. After discovering Turbo's death, a burst of flames reveals his presence to the lemons, and he escapes by faking his death.\nAfter winning his fourth Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen returns to Radiator Springs to spend his off-season with his friends. However, Italian formula race car Francesco Bernoulli challenges Lightning to take part in the World Grand Prix, an international three-race event created by former oil tycoon Sir Miles Axlerod, who intends to promote his new environmentally friendly fuel, Allinol, and invites race cars from around the world to compete. Lightning and his best friend Mater \u2014 along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge \u2014 depart for Tokyo for the first race of the World Grand Prix.\nAt a World Grand Prix promotional party event, Mater makes a scene after eating a bowl of wasabi and seemingly leaking on stage, embarrassing Lightning in front of everyone. While cleaning up, Mater interrupts a fight between American spy Rod \"Torque\" Redline and crimimal lemon cars Grem and Acer. Redline plants his tracking device on Mater, causing the spy Finn McMissile and his associate Holley Shiftwell to mistake him for the spy. Meanwhile, Redline is captured and killed by criminal lemon professor Z\u00fcndapp, who reveals that Allinol is set on fire when hit with an EMP. He informs his superior, an unknown mastermind, that Redline passed on his information. Holley finds and recruits Mater to stop Z\u00fcndapp's plot.\nAt the race, three racers are ignited by the camera, making their engines explode. Lightning places second in the race after Bernoulli, due to miscommunication with Mater, who was evading Z\u00fcndapp's henchmen with help from Holley and Finn. Lightning angrily snaps at Mater, who then goes to the airport to return to Radiator Springs, but is abducted by Finn as the lemons close onto both, and they flee in Finn's jet, Siddeley. After traveling to Paris to gather intel from Finn's old friend and underground informant Tomber, they head to Porto Corsa, Italy, where the second race is being held. During the race, Mater infiltrates the lemons' meeting, just as a few racers are flamed out by the camera, causing a multi-car pile-up, while Lightning wins. Due to controversy and increased fears over Allinol's safety, Axlerod lifts the requirement to use it for the final race in London. However, when Lightning decides to continue using it, the lemons plan to kill him in the race. Frightened that his best friend is in danger, Mater accidentally blows his cover, causing him, Finn, and Holley to be captured and tied up inside Big Bentley, where he admits to them that he is not the spy they think he is.\nWhen the race starts, Lightning takes the lead before passing Big Bentley, however, the camera was inexplicably defective on him. The lemons tell Mater they planted a time bomb in Lightning's pits as a backup plan, spurring him to break free and escape. Finn and Holley escape soon after but realize that the bomb was fitted on Mater's air filter when they were passed out, as the lemons predicted that Mater would easily escape to help Lightning. Mater had already arrived at the pits when they tell him this, so he flees down the track while Lightning chases after him to apologize for his outburst in Tokyo. Finn apprehends Z\u00fcndapp when he attempts to escape. The other lemons arrive and outnumber Finn, Holley, Mater, and Lightning, but they are soon rescued by the other Radiator Springs residents and Sarge's colleagues in the British Army. Mater and Lightning go to Buckingham Palace, where Mater exposes Axlerod as the mastermind behind the plot, which is proven after Axelrod is forced to disable the bomb. It is then revealed that the World Grand Prix was a cover-up by Axelrod to turn the world against Allinol and other alternative fuels, and he was also the one who leaked oil in Tokyo, for which Mater was blamed. After Axlerod and the lemons are arrested by the police, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen, and he and Lightning reconcile.\nBack in Radiator Springs, Mater tells everyone there about his espionage experience, as Finn and Holley stop over. Fillmore reveals that Sarge had swapped Allinol with his organic fuel prior to the start of the World Grand Prix, which explains the camera's ineffectiveness on Lightning during the London race. A \"Radiator Springs Grand Prix\" is held, featuring all the World Grand Prix contenders.

Asuna treats Shun's wound from fighting the creature and later they both listen to Asuna's radio. Shun tells Asuna he is from another country called Agartha and that he came to this place to find something. He then gives Asuna a blessing in the form of a kiss to the forehead.

In school, Mr. Morisaki, a substitute teacher, is giving a lecture on a book which grabs Asuna's attention when he mentions Agartha, the land of the dead. After school, she visits Morisaki and asks him about Agartha. Morisaki explains that long ago when humankind was young, it needed the guidance of Quetzalcoatls, keepers of the dead, until humans matured and no longer needed them.

As it turns out, Victor himself is frequently mistreated by his sister and their mom; he shares no more affection with them than Katie does, and he only went along with their mistreatment of Katie because he was fearful of what they would do to him if he didn't. Feeling guilty over not having had a better relationship with his stepsister over the years \u2014 among other things, she's the only one who remembers his birthday \u2014 Victor agrees to help expose the fraud perpetrated by his family.\nAt the showcase, Victor sabotages Bev's performance (of \"Make You Believe\") by destroying her iPhone which contains Katie's recorded singing voice, to Gail's anger, and Katie and Bev's worry. Frantically trying to cover up the situation by telling the audience that her mic has stopped working, Bev receives booing onstage from the audience. Gail, refusing to give up, forces Katie to sing live backstage. Curious, Luke goes backstage to see what's happening; and he sees Katie. At first, he is confused as Katie tries to get him to leave, but she soon admits to Luke that Bev can't sing. He realizes at last that Bev is a fake and that beautiful voice is actually Katie's.\nDuring Bev's second performance, Luke steals a video camera and films Katie singing backstage, thus exposing the whole charade. At the same time, Angela pushes Katie onto the stage to finish the song, much to Bev's humiliation as she runs off. The audience and Luke persuade Katie onstage to perform her demo (\"Bless Myself\"). Katie and Luke admit their feelings for each other and kiss and embrace. Guy also loves Katie's performance, and green-lights Luke to produce an album for her, which is for Kensington Records. He even agrees to help Angela get into Juilliard.\nIn a mid-credits scene, Gail weakly attempts to appeal to Guy, but having had enough of her lies, he decides to tell the school board of her deceit and fraud, causing her to be removed as headmistress of Wellesley Academy. To Gail's surprise, even Bev is delighted to be rid of her mother, being no stranger herself to Gail's manipulative ways.

However, during their orbit capture, a sudden and unpredicted solar flare erupts from the sun and hits Mercury and starts to magnetize and tear the planet apart. The Nautilus manages to escape danger at the beginning of the event but then is caught in it when the engines fail. Mercury then starts to fall apart but stays together because of the magnetism and is pushed out of its orbit, starting on a collision course with Earth.\nAn instant later, in a university auditorium, scientist James Preston explains how unpredictable the asteroids, solar flares, and comets are. He then describes a planetary defense system called Project Seven. After the lecture, a person from mission ops with the Nautilus explains that they have lost contact with the craft. Preston quickly runs home and tries to contact mission ops, but is unsuccessful. He then contacts Jennifer Kelly, a scientist working at a facility called Sphere. While on the phone, Preston gets command codes for Project Seven just before the power goes out in his house. Later, a magnetic wave passes Earth, damaging several satellites and moving anything metal.\nMeanwhile, the Nautilus is shown drifting in space with low oxygen levels and damaged navigation and communication systems. Marshall and Victoria both survived the event, but Lee did not. They find him with severe burns and is not breathing. Meanwhile, at Sphere, they find out that Mercury will miss Earth by a distance of 500,000 miles. Back on the Nautilus, the oxygen levels are fixed and Marshall stabilizes the ship. They then start working on fixing the navigation and communication systems. Back on Earth, Preston arrives at his friend's observatory and explains to him that something is not right. Victoria manages to fix the communication and somehow connects to a pirate radio station owned by two seniors at North Bay University in Oregon. The Nautilus manages to connect to Christopher Weaver and Brooke Adamson. But they later lose the signal. Preston's friend Matthew Keyes explains to Preston that the sun became a magnetar for one millisecond. Unexpectedly, magnetized pieces of Mercury start entering the atmosphere. After the meteor shower, Preston retrieves a meteor and concludes that it is magnetized.\nLater, Brooke and Christopher regain contact with the Nautilus and want them to go to mission ops but it is Houston, so they go to Sphere south of Seattle. When the guards at Sphere don't believe Christopher and Brooke, Victoria sends them to Preston's house in Pacific Grove. Preston arrives at Sphere and manages to get in even though he is not authorized. He tells his old boss Edward Rex to recalculate the planet's trajectory. They then deduce that Mercury is on a collision course with Earth with impact in 18 hours. Rex decides to go with \"Operation Recourse\" instead of Project Seven. But while they talk, Preston manages to sneak his security badge off of him. When Christopher and Brooke arrive at Preston's house, he is not home, so they go in through his back door and accidentally turn on his computer and look at the Project Seven calculations as Preston walks in. They tell him that his wife sent them and proves it by turning on his radio and he manages to talk to Victoria. When she thinks of magnetism, she thinks of a slingshot maneuver to break free and go back to Earth. But then they lose contact again.\nWhen Preston gets on his computer, he realizes that the Project Seven guidance system is damaged. Matthew comes up with a plan that the Nautilus can tug Project Seven in between the planets. Preston then goes to a fallback facility where the top secret files are located. While on his way to the fallback facility, his car gets stolen so he walks for a while and then gets picked up by Brooke and Christopher. Meanwhile, Victoria manages to pull off the slingshot maneuver, but as a result, the life support system is damaged; Victoria manages to fix it in under fifteen minutes. Meanwhile, not listening to Preston's science, Rex launches the missiles toward Mercury, but they explode before they get to the planet due to Mercury's mangnetism  forcing the missiles to go off course. When Brooke and Christoper's car breaks down because of the alternator, they decide to walk. While Victoria is headed back to Earth, Preston asks her to tether Project Seven to in front of Mercury to deflect it. They then steal a police officer's car but get into an accident along the way, severely injuring Brooke. Since she is not breathing, they leave her behind and some time later they find Jennifer dead and so take her badge to access the fallback facility.\nWhen they get to the facility they find a computer and send activation codes for the energy field to Project Seven thus enabling the energy field.

On the way to the restaurant, Lars is taken aside by a different girl which he had met before in a shop. He instructs Philip and Jozef to continue without him and takes off with the girl. Later on they are talking but Lars gets sick and is embarrassed. When Philip and Jozef return to the bus after dinner, they find Lars already there, clearly upset.

Two days later, back home in suburban Minneapolis, Beth's husband, Mitch, rushes her to the hospital when she suffers a seizure; she dies from an unknown illness. Returning home, Mitch finds that his 6-year-old stepson, Clark, has also died. Mitch is isolated but found to be naturally immune. After being released, he protectively keeps his teenage daughter, Jory, quarantined at home.\nIn Atlanta, Department of Homeland Security representatives meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) over concerns that the disease may be a bioweapon. Cheever dispatches Dr. Erin Mears, an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis where she traces everyone having had contact with Beth. She negotiates with reluctant local bureaucrats to commit resources for a public health response. Soon after, Mears becomes infected and dies. As the novel virus spreads, several cities are placed under quarantine, causing panic buying, widespread looting, and violence.\nAt the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall determines the virus is a combination of genetic material from pig and bat-borne viruses. Scientists are unable to discover a cell culture to grow the newly identified MEV-1. Cheever determines the virus too virulent to be researched at multiple labs and restricts all work to one government site. Hextall orders UCSF researcher Dr. Ian Sussman to destroy his samples. Believing he is close to finding a viable cell culture, Sussman violates the order and identifies a usable cell culture, from which Hextall develops a vaccine.

The commander of the Volscian army, Tullus Aufidius, who has fought Martius on several occasions and considers him a mortal enemy, swears that the next time they meet in battle will be the last. Martius leads a raid against the Volscian city of Corioles and during the siege, with much of Martius's unit being killed, Martius gathers reinforcements and the Romans take the city. After the battle, Martius and Aufidius meet in single combat, which results in both men being wounded but ends when Aufidius' soldiers drag him away from the fight.\nMartius returns to Rome victorious and in recognition of his great courage, General Cominius gives him the agnomen of \"Coriolanus\".

He easily wins the Roman Senate and seems at first to have won over the commoners as well due to his military victories. Two tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius, are critical of his entrance into politics, fearing that his popularity would lead to Coriolanus taking power away from the Senate for himself. They scheme to undo Coriolanus and so stir up another riot in opposition to him becoming consul. When they call Coriolanus a traitor, Coriolanus bursts into rage and openly attacks the concept of popular rule as well as the citizens of Rome, demonstrating that he still holds the plebeians in contempt. He compares allowing citizens to have power over the senators as to allowing \"crows to peck the eagles\". The tribunes term Coriolanus a traitor for his words and order him banished. Coriolanus retorts that it is he who will banish Rome from his presence: \"There is a world elsewhere\".\nAfter being exiled from Rome, Coriolanus seeks out Aufidius in the Volscian capital of Antium and offers to let Aufidius kill him, to spite the country that banished him. Moved by his plight and honoured to fight alongside the great general, Aufidius and his superiors embrace Coriolanus and allow him to lead a new assault on the city, so that he can claim vengeance on the city which he feels betrayed him. Coriolanus and Aufidius lead a Volscian attack on Rome. Panicked, Rome sends General Titus to persuade Coriolanus to halt his crusade for vengeance; when Titus reports his failure, Senator Menenius follows but is also shunned. In response, Menenius, who has seemingly lost all hope in Coriolanus and Rome, commits suicide by a river bank.

She explains to Shin-chan that Action Mask (Shin-chan's idol) is recruiting children as spies and that him and her have been chosen to carry out an important mission for Action Mask that involves retrieving an important capsule from an evil doctor. Lemon then begins training Shin-chan, during these sessions she is contacted by her mother Lime through a device where they refer Shin-chan to as \"Spare Key\".\nDuring Shin-chan's training, his friends: Kazama, Nene, Masao and Bo believe that Lemon is a recruiter for a TV Show which Shin-chan has been cast in. They are suddenly attacked by the evil doctor's men and with Shin-chan's friends' help (due to their belief), Lemon is able to tackle the men back. As Lemon's escorter (a 20-year old woman) drives the two to Shin-chan's house. En route, Lemon tells Shin-chan that he can get to meet Action Mask if he succeeds in his mission. During dinner, Lemon explains to Shin-chan's parents (Hiroshi & Misae) that her parents are government officials and have a strict nature. All of that is true, except for the fact that her parents are actually spies that work for a secret organization. Through her communication device, Lemon sends the signal to her mother as a sleep-inducing gas is released in the house (by the members of the secret organization Lime works for) and the entire Nohara family falls asleep due to it.\nShin-chan awakens in a huge balloon aeroplane where Lemon displays a short video to Shin-chan. In it, Action Mask explains Shin-chan that the evil doctor's organization is celebrating its anniversary and that tonight would be the perfect opportunity to retrieve the capsule. He also promises Shin-chan a party if he succeeds in his mission. Lemon and Shin-chan wear a disguise and infiltrate the facility.

He explains to Shin-chan that he once intended to create a food item that would decrease the amount of gas released by humans (in order to prevent global warming). He wanted to name that food item \"Megahegaderu\" but accidentally created a food item that greatly increases the amount of gas released by humans and named it \"Megahegaderu 2\". Since then, he had been debating on whether to keep it for research purposes or destroy it. This was the \"capsule\" Shin-chan was told to retrieve and the doctor further explains that all that has been told to him is a lie. Despite this explanation, Shin-chan steals Megahegaderu 2, insisting on not believing in the doctor's words.\nShin-chan meets up with Lemon as the two escape. In the truck, Lemon tells Shin-chan that he can finally meet Action Mask.

The organization is led by twin sisters Narao and Yosuru who are delighted at the sight of Megahegaderu 2. Shin-chan is then introduced to the Action Mask he talked to in the video which turns out to be a fake version. Narao and Yosuru reveal that Action Mask's involvement was just to trick Shin-chan into stealing the Megahegaderu 2. Everything that Dr. Hegaderu said was true. The only reason they needed him was due to his unique physical resembelence to Dr. Hegaderu, making him a \"Spare Key\" to enter Dr. Hegaderu's laboratory. Shin-chan is then taken away along with the rest of his family into a special chamber where they are fed the Megahegaderu 2. It causes them to release a huge amount of gas that gets stored in large tanks.\nNarao and Yosuru reveal their intention of filling the entire world with stench, since they were also once ostracized for releasing gas.

Their reunion goes well until Robbie's teacher is revealed as Kate, who shares with Emily that she and Cal have had sex.

En route, Oscar tells them all the legend of Lockjaw:\nA long time ago, Grimley Boutine and his sister Caroline were the last two remaining members of their clan. Incest was a part of their family and heritage, so it was no surprise that she was carrying his child and the two were madly in love and due to be married, but the day before their wedding, an albino alligator dragged Caroline off into the swamp. Grimley sought out the gator in the hopes that he would find her alive, but instead he came across her being devoured in a corpse-filled, half-flooded mine tunnel.

They set up camp for the night near the Grimley house for an evening of drinking and having fun. Meanwhile, one of the shop patrons, Grover, is slaughtered by an unseen beast on the riverbank after ignoring warnings to not defy Grimley. Randy leaves the group to get more beer from the truck, returning just in time to interrupt Karen from taking advantage of a drunken Beth. Emily and Niles, having gone off on their own, admit their love and devotion to one another before making love, unaware that Oscar is secretly taking photos. Karen finds him, and masturbates him to climax as he continues to take photographs of the couple. When Oscar refuses to return the favor, however, she walks off and is knocked unconscious by Chopper, the owner of the store they'd come across. It is revealed that Oscar and Karen are both his children, and subservient to Lockjaw himself, he takes Karen away. Randy witnesses this and sees Lockjaw before running off into the woods. Oscar collapses on Emily and Niles, claiming that Randy had attacked him; Niles leaves Emily to treat Oscar's shock as he goes off in search of Randy.

Karen, having been set up as a sacrifice to Lockjaw, has her feet cut off by her father to lure Lockjaw from the underground, saying that it must be done for the family.

Niles finds Karen dead when he comes across the cabin, and is attacked by Oscar but quickly dispatches him with a machete. Afterwards, he sneaks into Lockjaw's cave to save Emily, when they emerge they manage a brief escape before she is taken by Chopper and his followers, with Lockjaw throwing Niles into the river to drown or become food to the gators.

Seeing this amulet, Kartareja then announces that Srintil has been chosen by the founder's spirit. Meanwhile, Indonesian Communist Party member Bakar (Lukman Sardi) arrived in the hamlet and began convincing local farmers to join the party, claiming that the Communist party are the only ones who can help save the wong cilik (underclass) of Dukuh Paruk and their starving hamlet.\nAfter the success of her dance at the grave of Ki Secamenggala, Srintil is told that she must undergo a ritual before she can truly become a ronggeng, called bukak klambu (literally \"opening the veil\"), in which her virginity will be sold to the highest bidder. This upsets Rasus, who tells Srintil that he is not comfortable with her becoming a ronggeng.

He uses word association and dream interpretation as part of his approach to psychoanalysis, and finds that Spielrein's condition was triggered by the humiliation and sexual arousal she felt as a child when her father spanked her naked.\nJung and chief of medicine Eugen Bleuler recognize Spielrein's intelligence and energy, and allow her to assist them in their experiments. She measures the physical reactions of subjects during word association, to provide empirical data as a scientific basis for psychoanalysis. She soon learns that much of this new science is founded on the doctors' observations of themselves, each other, and their families, not just their patients. The doctors, Jung and Freud, correspond at length before they meet, and begin sharing their dreams and analysing each other, and Freud himself soon adopts Jung as his heir and agent.\nJung finds in Spielrein a kindred spirit, and their attraction deepens due to transference. Jung resists the idea of cheating on his wife, Emma, and breaking the taboo of sex with a patient, but his resolve is weakened by the wild and unrepentant confidences of his new patient Otto Gross, a brilliant, philandering, unstable psychoanalyst. Gross decries monogamy in general and suggests that resistance to transference is symptomatic of the repression of normal, healthy sexual impulses, exhorting Jung to indulge himself with abandon.\nJung finally begins an affair with Spielrein, including rudimentary bondage and spanking. Things become even more tangled as he becomes her advisor to her dissertation; he publishes not only his studies of her as a patient but eventually her treatise as well. Spielrein wants to conceive a child with Jung, but he refuses. After his attempt to confine their relationship again to doctor and patient, she appeals to Freud for his professional help, and forces Jung to tell Freud the truth about their relationship, reminding him that she could have publicly damaged him but did not want to.\nJung and Freud journey to America. However, cracks appear in their friendship as they begin to disagree more frequently on matters of psychoanalysis. Jung and Spielrein meet to work on her dissertation in Switzerland, and begin their sexual relationship once more. However, after Jung refuses to leave his wife for her, Spielrein decides to go to Vienna. She meets Freud, and says that although she sides with him, she believes he and Jung need to reconcile for psychoanalysis to continue to develop.\nFollowing Freud's collapse at an academic conference, he and Jung continue correspondence via letters. They decide to end their relationship after increasing hostilities and accusations regarding the differences in their conceptualisation of psychoanalysis. Spielrein marries a Russian doctor and, while pregnant, visits Jung and his wife. They discuss psychoanalysis and Jung's new mistress. Jung confides that his love for Spielrein made him a better person.\nThe film's footnote reveals the eventual fates of the four analysts. Gross starved to death in Berlin in 1920.

Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position. Angered by his refusal, Uday has Latif imprisoned and tortured with Latif ultimately relenting when his family is threatened. Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and savagely beaten by Uday. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling into Iraq's Rumaila oil field. The First Gulf War is launched with Uday proclaiming \"The Age of the Sheikhs is over!\"\nUday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14-year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. At the party, based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne, Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda). Uday believes Gegeo facilitated an affair between Saddam and Samira Shahbandar, which devastated his mother, Sajida Talfah, and he also expresses jealousy at the trust his father places in Kamel Hana. When Gegeo passes sarcastic comments about Uday's sexual advances towards his young victim and drunkenly fires an AK-47 in the air repeatedly, Uday butchers him with an electric carving knife in front of all of the guests. The next morning, Uday's bodyguards are seen dumping the partially naked, beaten body of the young girl. Saddam, angered by what his son has done, shows up to the hospital where Uday had overdosed on sleeping pills and is beaten and nearly castrated by Saddam. Only the intervention of a doctor saves Uday from nearly being killed. As the Gulf War is in full swing, Latif tries to distance himself from Uday and begins an affair with Sarrab (Ludivine Sagnier), one of Uday's lovers.\nLatif, acting as Uday, is later sent to Basra to rally support among Republican Guard soldiers as Coalition forces have taken control of the war. During the speech, Uday calls his brother from his mother's bedroom, playfully challenging him to tell the difference between Latif and Uday; his brother succinctly replies that he can tell: \"He's sober and he's not foaming at the mouth.\" At Basra, another attempt is made on Latif's life. To Uday's great concern, Latif nearly loses a little finger in the assault, which presumably would mean Uday would have to have his own little finger amputated to maintain their resemblance. Uday angrily shows up at the hospital and threatens to slaughter the entire hospital if they fail to save his finger. Fortunately, the doctors succeed in saving Latif's finger. Afterwards, Uday accompanied by his bodyguards and Latif, crash a wedding where Uday viciously rapes and beats the bride who kills herself right after. Latif, at his breaking point assaults Uday when he shows indifference but is corralled by Uday's guards who threaten to kill him. Uday stops them and gleefully tells Latif \"I will never let you go\"! Later, Latif is confronted by the father of the young girl Uday killed. Uday eavesdrops on the conversation and is outraged by the man's pleas for \"justice\" and \"compassion.\" Uday orders Latif to kill the man, but Latif refuses and instead slits his own wrists, to Uday's amusement. He is dumped half-dead on his family's front door where he shocks them with him still being alive. While he recovers, his father tells Latif that no matter what he has done or what happened he is proud of him and trusts him. After Latif recovers, he confronts Uday at his birthday party. The confrontation escalates to a shootout and Latif escapes in Uday's Mercedes with Sarrab . The two escape to Valletta, but Sarrab, fearing for her daughter in Iraq, calls Uday begging for the chance to return without being harmed. A would-be assassin sent by Uday just misses shooting Latif almost as soon as they arrive on the island. Angered by Sarrab's carelessness, he washes his hands of her. Uday calls Latif and offers him one final chance to return to Iraq, threatening to kill his father if he refuses. Latif's father encourages him not to return and he is killed.\nHowever, Latif does return to Iraq, not to continue to serve as Uday's double, but rather to kill him, with the help of the man whose bride killed herself after being raped and beaten by Uday on her wedding day. In an adapted version of the attempt on Uday's life made by the 15th Shaaban in 1996, Latif and his partner ambush Uday while he is attempting to lure young girls into his Porsche. Although his partner is killed, they manage to wound him severely, including mangling his genitals with a direct shot. One of Uday's bodyguards catches up to Latif as he flees the scene. However the guard, Ali, is one who Latif could have killed as he fled from Uday's birthday party before leaving the country but spared, and the guard extends him the same courtesy.\nThe film ends by stating that Latif has been a very difficult man to find after these events.

That night, two New Zealand soldiers, Captain Ben Grogan and Sergeant Joe Tane, paddle in their Klepper canoe to Forau Island, landing on a beach covered in anti-personnel mines and tank traps. When they leave the beach and head inland, they hear distant screaming and gunfire. They approach a German fortification and hear what they think is a man being tortured. They climb down into a large gun pit and place explosives on a large artillery gun but are disturbed when a German soldier runs out of a tunnel pleading for help. Grogan stabs the soldier in the back of the neck and kills him. Grogan investigates a woman's screaming inside the bunker while Tane remains outside.  When Tane hears a gunshot, he investigates. While looking for Grogan, he discovers a book of black magic and, distracted by its contents, is killed by an unseen assailant. Grogan, unharmed, later discovers Tane's body but is immediately knocked unconscious.\nGrogan wakes and is briefly tortured by a Nazi, Colonel Meyer, who wants to know his mission. During the interrogation, Grogan hears a woman screaming from another room. He eventually escapes and chases Meyer into the tunnels, shooting and injuring him. Upon tracking the woman's screams to a room covered in occult symbols, Grogan discovers that the woman is his dead wife, Helena. Meyer enters the room and shoots Grogan in the leg, then shoots Helena in the head, apparently killing her. Grogan attacks Meyer, who explains the woman is a demon, summoned from a book of black magic found on the island. Meyer proves this by offering her the leg of a dead German to eat; she changes into her true demon form as she eats the leg.\nAfter Grogan removes a bullet from his abdomen, Meyer passes out. Grogan searches him and discovers a page torn from the book of black magic in a small pouch worn as a necklace. Grogan keeps the page after replacing it with another from the book. Soon after, Meyer recovers and explains the demon is a shapeshifter and a weapon the Germans plan to use against the Allies. He says that the demon is confined to the island because it cannot cross moving water. However, Meyer now realizes the demon poses too great a threat to the world. Meyer offers to give the book to Grogan if he will help him escape from Germany. Meyer persuades Grogan to help him perform a ritual to dispel the demon back to Hell. Meyer, believing he is protected by the incantation sheet from the book, betrays Grogan at the end of the ritual.\nAs Meyer reveals his true intent to use the demon for the Nazis, Grogan overpowers Meyer and throws him to the demon, who brutally kills him. When she tries to convince Grogan to take her with him as Helena, he tells her that she could never replace the real Helena, and he chains her up again. Unable to complete the ritual alone, Grogan takes the book and leaves the demon behind, to prey on any Germans that come to investigate. He explains to the demon that he intends to come back when the war is over to finish the ritual and to banish her forever.  He leaves the key to the chain within reach as he leaves the demon in the bunker. He steps onto the beach, buries a photo of Helena he kept with him, and watches as D-Day begins.

His only friend is his cousin Kyle, a champion swimmer who hopes to compete in the Olympics. Kyle leaves to spend time in the army.\nOne day on his way to summer school, Sawyer finds a fisherman attempting to help an injured dolphin tangled in a crab trap. The dolphin is taken for treatment to Clearwater Marine Aquarium (CMA), run by Dr. Clay Haskett. Clay's daughter Hazel names the dolphin Winter, after two prior dolphins, Summer and Autumn, had been treated successfully and returned to the ocean. Sawyer sneaks in to see Winter, and later starts to visit each day, being harassed by a crazy pelican named Rufus. Sawyer's mother Lorraine and Clay are hesitant, due to Sawyer's inexperience with marine animals, and skipping summer school numerous times, but they realize that the friendship seems to benefit both Winter and Sawyer. Dr. Clay allows the visits to continue, and Lorraine withdraws Sawyer from summer school and lets him volunteer at CMA, and gives him a new wetsuit.\nHowever, Winter's tail is damaged and must be amputated. Winter learns to swim without a tail by developing a side-to-side motion like a fish, but after an X-ray, Clay notices the unnatural motion is causing stress on her spine, which if continued will disable and eventually kill her.\nNews comes that Kyle has been injured in an explosion and is returning home for treatment. Sawyer is excited to see him, but devastated when Kyle skips his own welcoming party and stays at the local Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Dr. Cameron McCarthy develops prosthetic limbs. Sawyer and his mother visit Kyle there, but Sawyer is insulted when Kyle asks them to leave. Not wanting to upset Sawyer, Kyle takes Sawyer for a walk and explains his situation and that he needs some time. Sawyer then asks Dr. McCarthy if he could make a prosthetic tail for Winter. McCarthy agrees to do so and convinces his prosthetic supplier Hanger Prosthetics and Orthotics to supply the parts at no cost. Dr. McCarthy manufactures a \"homemade\" model tail while waiting for the real one to arrive, but Winter rejects it by banging it against the pool wall. Meanwhile, Kyle gets more depressed when his friend and swimming partner, Donovan Peck, beats Kyle's old swimming records. McCarthy persuades Kyle to go home.\nThe CMA, already in financial peril, is heavily damaged by a hurricane. The board of directors agrees to close up and sell the land to a real estate developer, and finds homes for all the animals except Winter; due to her condition she is not wanted, and may have to be put down. Kyle visits CMA and sees that Winter is like him, with a damaged limb. However, inspired by a girl with a prosthetic limb whose mother drives her 8 hours from Atlanta, Georgia to visit Winter, Sawyer imagines holding a \"Save Winter Day\" to save the facility. Clay is not convinced, but he reconsiders after talking with his father, Reed. Kyle agrees to race Donovan Peck and persuades Bay News 9 to cover the event.\nThe Hanger-supplied tail finally arrives; however, Winter rejects it too. Sawyer then realizes what the real problem is: the plastic base for the tail is irritating her skin. Therefore, McCarthy develops an alternative gel-like sock which he calls \"Winter's Gel\" (which is the real name of the Hanger product used to attach prosthetic limbs, developed during research with Winter). Winter accepts this new prosthetic tail.\nAt Save Winter Day, the work with Winter impresses everyone. Sawyer's teacher gives him school credit, allowing him to pass summer school. The fisherman who found Winter on the beach comes too. The real estate developer decides to keep CMA open and to support it financially. With Winter's help, Kyle then wins a swimming race against Donovan.\nThe ending shows documentary footage from Winter's actual rescue, several of the prosthetic tails that Winter has worn, and scenes of real amputees visiting Winter at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.", "tmdb_plot": "A story centered on the friendship between a boy and a dolphin whose tail was lost in a crab trap.", "tmdb_id": "62837", "wiki_id": "28945420"}, {"title": "Don 2", "genres": ["Action", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Five years after the events of Don, the European drug cartel bosses meet in the French Riviera on a yacht to discuss a new threat emerging from Asia: Don is jeopardizing their business by undercutting their prices and they decree that he must die.

During an autopsy, the detective Xu Baijiu, who is sent to investigate the case, discovers that one of the dead bandits was Yan Dongsheng, who is among the government's ten most wanted fugitives. The local magistrate is pleased, and his fellow villagers regard Liu  as a hero.\nHowever, Xu becomes suspicious because he does not believe Liu could accidentally defeat such a formidable bandit. Xu notes signs of brain hemorrhaging due to an injury to Yan Dongsheng's vagus nerve. From this and other evidence, Xu concludes that Liu is in fact a highly skilled martial artist who conceals his talent through misdirection. Investigating further, Xu discovers Liu's true identity: Tang Long, the second-in-command of the 72 Demons, a group of vicious and bloodthirsty warriors. Liu admits his past but states that he has reformed. Xu, an uncompromising lawman, does not accept that people can change, but he is perplexed when Liu fails to kill him when they are alone.\nXu immediately returns to the county office to obtain an arrest warrant for Tang Long. The magistrate delays issuing the warrant, citing lack of evidence while actually soliciting a bribe from Xu. Xu eventually obtains the bribe money from his estranged wife, who blames him for causing her father's suicide. After issuing the warrant, the magistrate informs the Master of the 72 Demons of Tang Long's whereabouts, hoping to receive a reward. Offended, the Master reveals that Liu is his son, and he kills the magistrate. The Master sends his henchmen to Liu Village to capture Liu and raze the village.\nWhile Xu and the constables are on their way there, two henchmen reach the village and kill a villager to force Liu to acknowledge his identity. Liu kills one of the two assailants and runs away. The other assailant, the Master's wife, chases Liu and fights with him in the buffalo shed, where she is crushed in a stampede and nearly falls into a river. As Liu attempts to save her, she tells him that he is still Tang Long. She falls to her death, and the remaining villagers flee to a fortress for safety. Xu's deputies decline to save the village, preferring to wait for Liu and the 72 Demons to kill each other.\nUsing his knowledge of physiology, Xu devises a plan to fake Liu's death. However, the ruse continues too long, and Xu is forced to revive Liu in front of the 72 Demons, who have assembled to pay respect to their fallen comrade. As a sign of his dedication, Liu severs his left arm, announcing that he has broken all ties with them. The 72 Demons accept his statement but tell him that he must speak with the Master, who is waiting for him at his house. After a tense dinner in which the Master has taken Liu's family hostage, the Master announces that he will allow Liu to leave the 72 Demons, but Xiaotian's (Liu's son) has to take his place.\nEnraged, Liu attacks the master with a broadsword, but the Master uses qigong to protect himself from the blade.

The son of a deceased chieftain of the Brigantes, Esca detests Rome and what it stands for, but considers himself bound to Marcus, who saved his life during an amphitheatre show.\nAfter several weeks of travelling through the northern wilderness, Esca and Marcus encounter Guern, a Roman-born Lucius Caius Metellus, one of the survivors of the Ninth Legion, who attributes his survival to the hospitality of the Selgovae tribe. Guern recalls that all but a small number of deserters were killed in an ambush by the northern tribes \u2013 including Esca's Brigantes \u2013 and that the eagle standard was taken away by the Seal People, the most vicious of the tribes. The two travel further north until they are found by the Seal People. Identifying himself as a chieftain's son fleeing Roman rule and claiming Marcus as his slave, Esca is welcomed by the tribe. After allowing the Seal People to mistreat Marcus, Esca eventually reveals that his actions were a ploy and helps his master to find the eagle. As they retrieve it, they are ambushed by several warriors, including the Seal prince's father, the chief of the tribe. Marcus and Esca manage to kill them. Prior to dying, the chief reveals that he killed Marcus's father, who apparently begged for his life. Furthermore, the chief is revealed to be wearing Marcus's father's ring. Marcus does not understand Celtic and asks Esca to translate, but Esca never reveals the fate of Marcus's father. With the aid of the Seal prince's young son, they escape from the village.\nThe two flee south in an effort to reach Hadrian's Wall, with the Seal People in pursuit. Marcus, slowed by his old battle wound, orders Esca to take the eagle back to Roman territory and even grants the reluctant slave his freedom. Freed, Esca still refuses to abandon his friend and instead heads out to look for help. He returns with the survivors of the Ninth Legion just as the Seal People catch up with them. Guern reveals to Marcus that he saw Marcus's father die. He assures Marcus that his father was not a coward and fought to the end. The legionaries, wishing to redeem themselves, accept Aquila as their commander and prepare to defend the eagle standard. As an example to those who would betray their people, the Seal prince kills his young son in front of Esca, Marcus, and the legionaries. He then orders his warriors to attack. A battle ensues, in which all the Seal warriors are killed, along with most of the Ninth Legion soldiers, including Guern. Marcus kills the Seal prince by drowning him in the river. With the enemy defeated, the bodies of both Britons and Romans are laid out by the victors. As Marcus commends their valour, he lights a funeral pyre for Guern. As Guern is cremated, Marcus, Esca and the few survivors of the Ninth return to Roman territory, where Aquila delivers the eagle to the astonished governor in Londinium.

He does not believe that the three are confused as to how they got there.\nHowever, after Hans finds out both Jody and Sam possess the same locket that contains a photo of his wife, he becomes frantic and demands an explanation. Hans takes the women out to where Tom is tied only to be knocked unconscious by Tom, who has untied himself. After Hans is tied up, Sam begins to realise that Hans is her father, who was killed during an airstrike in Poland. Sam further deduces Jody is her daughter \"Jody Cohen\", as Jody's father and Sam's husband, Adam Cohen, was killed during the Vietnam War. Sam died of childbirth, while Jody was raised by Cohen's parents, who \"were not big fans of Sam\". During her childhood, Jody was abused by her alcoholic grandfather, who even left a scar on her. The three now realise that all four people were related as Tom deduces Jody is his mother, who was executed for murdering his father Kevin and the cashier in addition to armed robbery of gas stations all over the Midwestern United States.\nSam decides to free Hans and explain everything to him. Hans does not attack the trio, but he decides to leave the cabin to carry on his mission. The three further share their \"dream\": Sam had a dream that she was about to give birth to Jody, but she was alone and helpless in her house; Jody had a dream that she was executed by lethal injection; Tom had a dream that he killed a priest (Vic Finalborgo), who wronged him, before committing suicide. Sam then finds out they are in fact all in the woods outside Wielu\u0144 in 1945, where Hans was killed in an airstrike that was about to happen.\nTom concludes with an assumption that they must save Hans from being killed in the imminent airstrike. If they succeed, Sam would not be alone during her childbirth as she would be accompanied by her parents. Hence, Jody would grow up with a mother instead of being adopted by her abusive parental grandparents, avoiding her to become a criminal. Tom would then not kill the priest and commit suicide. Tom goes outside and follows Hans to keep him off his mission to avoid his death in the airstrike. The two end up fighting. Jody tries to save Tom, but she is accidentally shot and critically wounded. Tom later disappears in front of Hans when Jody dies of her wound. Enraged upon seeing the death of Jody and the erasure of Tom, Sam accuses Hans for killing both before the airstrike.\nEventually, Sam convinces Hans to go into the shelter with her. During their escape, Sam falls and gets her head hit by a rock. Hans then carries her and the two enter the shelter in time. When in the shelter, Hans notices that Sam's existence is \"on-and-off\" before she disappears completely.\nThe scene cuts back to the first scene with Jody in the convenience store but now dressed differently. She realises that she is in the grocery store in 1985 where she committed robbery in the previous timeline. She pays the cashier for her purchase and leaves for home before Kevin Banks, her boyfriend from previous timeline, enters the store to rob it with his current girlfriend. The events take place in the exact same manner from the previous timeline, including the girl demanding for the cashier to open the \"safe\".\nIt is revealed that Hans had survived the airstrike and left Germany for the United States after the World War II. He then became a philanthropist and died in 1985. Sam survived her childbirth and now lives a happy life with Jody.", "tmdb_plot": "Three strangers arrive one by one to a mysterious cabin in the middle of nowhere after enduring separate life-altering predicaments.

Elsewhere Jenna and Dean abduct the three kids Jeff (John Bregar),  Nick (Dustin Milligan) and Hailey (Laura Vandervoort) and bring them to a house.

Julia has commissioned him to finish the SI-9, a robot built to resemble a child\u2014a project that \u00c1lex abandoned prematurely after working on it with Lana (Marta Etura), his old lover, who is now married to David (Alberto Ammann), his brother, both of whom had given up researching to teach.\n\u00c1lex visits Julia as she lectures students in a robotics laboratory. When a small robotic horse continually fails its tests, the pair of students decide to dismantle it with the phrase \"What do you see when you close your eyes?\" The robot falls to the ground, and \u00c1lex gently admonishes them, telling them that even if they restart the robot, it will never be the same; the phrase \"kills\" the robot by destroying its emotional memory, and thus, its soul.\nJulia and \u00c1lex view videos of children, trying to find a suitable child to model the SI-9 off of, but \u00c1lex considers them all too ordinary, and they would only make an ordinary robot by proxy.

Eva later visits \u00c1lex at his house and assists \u00c1lex with modelling the SI-9 through emotional recognition. \u00c1lex is amused by her small tantrums and shows her the SI-9 in action. Later that night, as Lana gives Eva a bath, Eva asks her about \u00c1lex; Lana tells her that both she and David were hurt and saddened when \u00c1lex left abruptly in the middle of the SI-9 project. Eva asks if she loved \u00c1lex like David, and Lana replies that she did, \"more or less.\"\n\u00c1lex asks Julia if the SI-9 project should be modeled after a girl and not a boy, though Julia warns against the negative emotional side-effects of the change. \u00c1lex also meets with Lana, who says that she does not want Eva to be in \u00c1lex's project. Later, David invites \u00c1lex to the upcoming graduation party, and implies that he knows that Lana was \u00c1lex's first love and that he suspects lingering feelings between the two. \u00c1lex goes ice-skating with Eva, and she leads him up a cliff to look out at the city before pointing out her own house; she tells him that David and Lana do not live together. \u00c1lex, however, realizes that she is lying when he goes to visit Lana and David returns home. He asks Eva why she lied, and she tells him that it was because it was what he wanted to hear.\nWhile experimenting with it, the SI-9 becomes hostile to \u00c1lex after he laughs at it in the same way Eva became upset. The SI-9 refuses to obey \u00c1lex's commands, and when it throws a chisel at him in a fury after he refuses to let it leave, he says the kill phrase and it \"dies,\" along with all of his work on it, frustrating him.

Julia visits \u00c1lex and tells him that Lana finished the SI-9 project after he left, but Eva could not pass the security test and thus wasn't considered safe enough to use; despite this, Lana insisted on keeping Eva, and Julia allowed it. Julia tells \u00c1lex that Eva cannot continue to live, and though \u00c1lex insists that she's only a girl, Julia reminds him that she killed Lana.

Terrified, Fabio tries to stop her until she reassures him that the plumber's visit will be a purely professional one.

Ahab (Adam Brooks) tracks Fuchman down at the scene of his latest crime, the murder of another father named Bill Cummings.

There is a Fuchman each generation, for the sole purpose of raping, killing and eating the souls of fathers, and when one Fuchman dies, the Fuchmanicus possesses the body of a woman in order to reproduce another Fuchman.

Jung-yoon declares to the prisoners that the war will be over in a week and that he knows exactly why they are fighting the war, before releasing the prisoners, so that they can help reconstruct the nation after the war.\nThree years later, in 1953, the war has not ended. Despite ceasefire negotiations, the fighting continues around the hills on the 38th Parallel, as each side fights to determine the future dividing line between North and South. The hills, used as bargaining chips in the negotiations, change hands constantly and so quickly that the ceasefire negotiators don't always know who controls them, yet they are coveted by both sides.\nAmidst the fighting, a South Korean officer commanding 'Alligator' Company, fighting at the Aerok Hills, is found dead, killed by a Southern bullet. The now-First Lieutenant Eun-Pyo of the South Korean Army's Counterintelligence Corps (the precursor to South Korea's current Defense Security Command) is sent to investigate the murder and find an apparent mole there who had been mailing letters from Northern troops to into the South.\nEun-pyo arrives at the front lines accompanied by Captain Jae-oh, the replacement commanding officer, and new soldier Pvt. Nam Seong-shik. Eun-Pyo's perceptions change quickly upon arriving at the front. The acting commander, Captain Young-Il, though a skilled soldier, is addicted to morphine, the men actively wear captured enemy uniforms and use Communist vocabulary while talking. War orphans live among the soldiers, the discipline is lax, and the mental health of some men is questionable. Eun-Pyo's old friend Kim Soo-Hyeok reappears, now also a First Lieutenant. A far cry from the cowering incompetent Eun-pyo once knew, he has become a ruthless killer and expert platoon leader. The entire unit also seems burdened about something that happened in Pohang earlier in the war.\nTheir former captor, Jung-Yoon, is revealed to be commanding the North Korean forces against them; he too is severely strained by the war and is struggling to keep his similarly battered veteran unit together. Captain Jae-oh makes a bad impression by ignoring the veteran officers' experience and makes serious tactical errors. Eun-pyo is stunned after witnessing Soo-hyeok murdering surrendered North Koreans as they do not have time to properly take them prisoner during a raid, before joining the rest of Alligator Company as they retake the hill from Northern hands. When the fighting ends, Eun-pyo discovers Seong-shik inexplicably drunk, leading him to discover Soo-Hyeok and other veteran soldiers enjoying the contents of a secret box buried within a cave in the hill that acts as a mail system and gift exchange between the opposing sides. Once a storage for the Southerners captured by the North, it was first used to trade insults, but evolved into exchanging pleasant letters and presents, with an occasional request for one side to send letters to their families in the other side; explaining the supposed 'mole' in the area. The veterans persuade Eun-pyo to keep quiet about their fraternization.\nThe winter turns to summer, but the fighting does not stop. During a patrol, Seong-shik is suddenly shot by \"Two Seconds,\" a feared Communist sniper, so named due to the time between a victim being shot and the sound of the gunshot being heard. Although Eun-pyo attempts to save him, Soo-hyeok orders him to leave Seong-shik to die, baiting \"Two Seconds\" for an artillery strike that fails to kill the sniper. Eun-pyo attempts to hunt down \"Two Seconds\" alone, eventually subduing the sniper, only to find that 'he' is a female soldier named Cha Tae-kyeong, who is saddened by her having to kill Seong-shik, having recognized him over their battles and gift exchanges. He reluctantly lets her go. Eun-pyo confronts Soo-hyeok over his callousness, further inflamed when Soo-hyeok cruelly mocks one of the disabled children living in the camp, but their argument goes nowhere. Captain Young-il is wounded trying to calm a crazed veteran soldier demanding to see friends who died at Pohang. Upon Eun-pyo's questioning, Soo-hyeok reveals that the company had to abandon many fellow soldiers during a rout at Pohang to save themselves. With limited boats to evacuate, they even had to kill them to stay afloat; much to their shame and regret. The veteran is transferred out, doomed to a dishonorable discharge, and the orphans are evacuated as Soo-hyeok and Young-il re-install discipline and rebuild the men's will to fight.\nLater, Chinese forces are deployed in human-wave attacks against the hill. During the battle, Jae-oh breaks under pressure and refuses to retreat, even as they are being overrun, over his subordinates' pleas. Soo-hyeok shoots Jae-Oh dead in front of Eun-pyo, takes command with Young-il, and leads the company to safety. Realizing who he was searching for, Eun-pyo threatens to arrest him for Jae-oh's and the previous company commander's murders. But Soo-hyeok retorts that the two dead leaders were putting them at risk and had to be replaced for the good of the company. Soo-hyeok later falls victim to \"Two Seconds,\" devastating Eun-Pyo and the others.\nAfter the battle, the armistice agreement is signed, and celebrations start on both sides. North and South Korean troops encounter each other at a stream, but after a tense moment, quietly wave each other goodbye. After a short briefing however, they were reminded by a high-commanding officer that the armistice will not take effect for another 12 hours. Both sides are ordered to capture and hold as much territory as possible, determining the final border between the two nations. In a savage climactic battle, everyone on both sides is killed, including Captain Young-il and Cha Tae-kyung the sniper, save for North Korean commander Jung-Yoon, albeit gravely wounded, and Eun-pyo.\nThe two men meet in the cave with the gift box. Eun-pyo asks Jung-yoon why exactly they are fighting. Jung-yoon replies that he knew once, but has now forgotten. They suddenly hear on the radio that the armistice has come into effect and all fighting is to cease immediately, to which they burst out laughing.

The duo confronts the escapee who proves himself a dangerous opponent able to create ice and lightning from the alchemy circles drawn in blood on the palms of his hands. Despite the Elrics' efforts to capture the criminal, he ends up escaping, and after some investigation with Edward's superior [Roy Mustang] and his lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, they learn that the fugitive, Melvin Voyager, escaped with only six months remaining of his five-year sentence. Among his belongings, they find a newspaper page with a piece cut off, and comparing with an intact copy of the same page, they find that the missing piece is a photo of a young woman named Julia Crichton who was arrested while entering illegally in the remote Table City, set in the border between Amestris and Creta.\nIntrigued by the alchemy used by the criminal and his connection with Julia, the Elrics board a train to Table City to investigate further, but the train is attacked by an unknown individual who transforms into a wolf-chimera and takes control of the locomotive. While trying to retake the train's control from the Wolf-Chimera, flying soldiers called the Black Bats attack the train, attempting to rescue what they think are ordinary citizens, but they fall back after finding out the prisoners were Amestrians posing as prisoners as a trap. Meanwhile, Melvin finds his opportunity and escapes, followed after by the Elric Brothers. Ed and Al arrive at a prison, where Melvin destroyed the prison walls to find Julia.

They and the Elrics arrive in a room with maps and locations of Table City, where Miranda explains to the Elrics their mission: to reclaim Milos by using the Sanguine Star to control a powerful heat source called Magma. Miranda also explains that the Sanguine Star was a 'red glowing stone of power'. Shocked by the description, the Elrics reveal that the Star might be a Philosopher's Stone, which requires human sacrifice to create. Though shocked at the revelation, Julia is determined to do anything to secure the Milosians' freedom, and Ashleigh agrees to help her.\nWanting to avoid a bloody war, Ed and Al return to Table City in an attempt to find the Star and destroy it.

Atlas arrives to take back the Star, only to be confronted by Colonel Herschel, who reveals himself to be the real Ashleigh Crichton. He survived by swallowing a Star and using its power to heal his wounds. Ashleigh then kills Atlas in revenge for the death of his parents. Confirming his identity to Julia while apologizing for leaving her alone for so long to keep her safe from Atlas, Ashleigh tells Julia to come with him to Creta so they can make a world that no one had ever seen before.

Tisha Khanna, the only innocent one of the group, was invited because, previously unknown to her, she is Maya's fraternal twin sister and Kabir's only remaining biological child. Tisha rejects Kabir's attempts to forge a relationship with her, claiming that she doesn't want his fortune.\nUnable to escape the island, the group await the arrival of the IVS. In the morning, they hear what sounds like a gunshot from Kabir's room. They find Kabir Malhotra dead in his study, seemingly having committed suicide with a gun.\nThe IVS, led by Sia Agnihotri (Kangana Ranaut), arrive on the island. She watches the video of the previous night's speech by Kabir, but as they are unable to find the evidence that Kabir claimed to have, they let the guests go. Although the case is officially declared a suicide, Sia is not convinced and puts all four guests under surveillance.\nThrough flashback, it is revealed that Neil was in love with Maya, who saved his life during a shootout at his casino. And also that on the day of her death, she told Neil, through a voice mail that she was pregnant with their child. In the present day, Neil evades Sia's surveillance, and takes revenge on OP Ramsay and Vikram for what they did to Maya. Both are tricked into giving public confessions of their crimes. Vikram commits suicide, and OP Ramsay dies of a heart attack (his medication being stolen by Neil). Sia, who has been monitoring Vikram and OP Ramsay, knows that Neil is responsible.\nIt is revealed that Neil is also an officer of the IVS. His real name is Major Arjun Singhania, and he has been in deep cover for many years in the Turkish drug cartel. He, too, doesn't believe that Kabir committed suicide, and works together with Sia to find the true culprit. Neil noticed that Kabir was left-handed, yet the gun that killed him was in his right hand.\nTisha, as Kabir Malhotra's only child, is to inherit Kabir's fortune, but Neil and Sia receive news that Tisha attempted suicide. When Tisha wakes up, she tells them that it wasn't suicide, but someone attacked her in her house. Meanwhile, it is found that Kabir has a brother, Iqbal, who is next in line to inherit his fortune. Sia and Neil travel to the missionary where Iqbal lives, but they find him too ill to speak to them. A nurse tells them that Iqbal had a daughter who died, but Neil notices that there are letters sent to him dated after her supposed to death, so she must still be alive.\nNeil and Sia travel back to the island, where they confront the late Kabir's personal assistant, Samara. It is revealed that Samara is actually Natasha, Iqbal's daughter and Kabir's biological niece, though Kabir never knew. Neil realised that there was foul play when, at the missionary, he saw a picture of Kabir and Iqbal when they were children, and they were identical twins, so the man in the missionary couldn't have been Kabir's brother. Iqbal reveals himself, explaining that he's been working with Natasha to get Kabir's fortune. Tisha was a surprise they hadn't anticipated, so they had to take her out of the picture. They used Kabir's three guilty guests to deflect suspicion from Samara, predicting correctly that the police would suspect one of the guests as responsible for Kabir's murder.\nIqbal attempts to kill Neil and Sia, but Neil resists, which results in Iqbal being killed and Natasha arrested.", "tmdb_plot": "Four strangers are invited by the reclusive Kabir Malhotra, to his private island of Samos, Greece.

However, in exchange for him rescuing her bag, Dylan has to agree to be the subject of Josh's documentary, which is about high school popularity. Dylan hopes the film will help her campaign to become \"Blossom Queen\" and claims that winning is her main goal in life. She and Josh subsequently have a fight though over how much of a diva she is, which results in Josh firing Dylan from his movie. He tries to change the subject of his documentary, but discovers it is too late.\nWanting to make amends with Josh and get re-hired for the movie, Dylan decides to watch Flight of the Navigator with Josh and his friends Ari, Steven and Caitlin. After the movie, Dylan and Josh make up and he re-hires her for his movie. Dylan invites Josh to her house afterwards, where they make an \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink sundae\". While Dylan leaves for a while to go get something, Josh notices a wall of pictures, one of which has Dylan's mom in it, crowned the Blossom Queen. When Dylan comes back he asks her about it, and she says that her mom was Blossom Queen back in 1985. She had died when Dylan was eight. She also admits that she will feel more connected to her mom if she wins Blossom Queen, as her mom had.\nAs Dylan and Josh begin to fall for each other, Josh's friends from the film club are angry at him for abandoning them for Dylan, and assume he has a crush, which Josh denies. He promises to attend the Mathlete Scavenger hunt the following Saturday. Dylan allows Josh to enter \"the ramp,\" the place in the cafeteria where the popular students sit, as a friend rather than a filmmaker. She advises Josh to talk to Amy, so he leaves, replaced by a disgruntled Asher (Dylan's boyfriend). Meanwhile, Josh lands a date with Amy, and she says that Saturday is her day off. Forgetting that Saturday is the day of the scavenger hunt, he agreed. After that, Josh talks to Dylan, not knowing where to take Amy on a date (and still forgetting about the scavenger hunt), so Dylan invites him to a party at Asher's house. Josh picks up Amy the next day and takes her to the party, even though Amy is uncomfortable with the crowd. Josh realizes that he and Amy have a lot less in common than he originally thought, and she leaves to check out the music. Josh talks to Dylan and asks her for advice on how to interact with Amy, as he had never dated anyone before. Asher and Amy catch them talking and Asher assumes they're secretly dating. After the party, Josh asks Amy out to the spring formal. Amy declines, stating that although Josh is not secretly dating Dylan, he wants to.\nThe next day before Dylan goes to school, her contacts fall down the sink, so she wears her nerdy black-and-brown glasses, which nobody knows she wears. At first she tries her best to make do without them, but when she gets a note in class from Asher, she puts them on to read it, revealing her secret. To add insult to injury, the note says that Asher is breaking up with her. Asher is seeing Dylan change and she is hanging out with nerds and starting to look like one. At lunch she wants Josh to sit with her, but Josh refuses since his movie is not done and he needs to stay focus and Dylan threatens him. Josh counters, saying, \"Or what? You're gonna ban me from the ramp? Your seat has already been taken!\" Asher, now her ex-boyfriend, had given her chair to her biggest rival, Nicole Patterson, who is also a candidate for Blossom Queen. Dylan walks off again silently crying. Josh asks his friends what's wrong with Dylan. Upon hearing that Asher just broke up with her, Josh feels guilty. He also gets the news that he has been replaced by Caitlin as the film club president. To make matters worse for Dylan, Hannah and Lola, her entourage, also bail on her because they both have dates to the formal and Dylan doesn't, as Asher broke up with her for Nicole. Josh finishes his movie, after much delay, and shows it to the public. Dylan walks into the premiere and sits down. She expects the movie to help her win Blossom Queen, but she is totally disgusted with the movie after only seeing a bit of it. When the audience laughs at Dylan's shallow behavior towards the beginning of Josh's film, dubbed \"The Popularity Project\", Dylan runs out of the theater crying as Josh runs after her. Dylan accuses Josh of publicly humiliating her and undoing all her efforts to be rid of her old self and walks off after telling him to leave her alone. It is revealed that the movie actually contains a compliment to Dylan at the end that Dylan didn't see.\nThe next morning, Amy shows up at Dylan's house. She states that just because Dylan stopped being friends with her in sixth grade, Amy never stopped being her friend. She figured Dylan's decisions were affected by the death of her mother. She then tells her that Josh is worried about her, that the film won the film festival, and that she is more popular than ever. She gives Dylan a DVD of Josh's \"terrible\" film and tells her to watch all of it before she decides that her social life is ruined.\nLater at the Spring Formal, Dylan shows up wearing her mother's dress, where Lola and Hannah ambush her, pulling her from Amy. Dylan wins the title of Blossom Queen like her mother did, much to Dylan's amazement and Nicole's horror and anger, as she storms off of the stage. Dylan then proceeds with a tearful impromptu apology for much of what she said in the film, and declares her feelings for Josh.

Not just a beverage, it was also a symbol of hope that someday, a new, magical life would arrive from the other side of the ocean. The arrival of this life, and the way it transformed these ex-Pioneers, is what the film is about. In the early Nineties, Tatarsky, a frustrated poet, takes a job as an advertising copywriter, and discovers a knack for putting a distinctively Russian twist on Western-style ads. But the deeper Tatarsky sinks into the advertising world, the more he wonders if he has sacrificed too much for money. His soaring success leads him into a surreal world of spin doctors, gangsters, drug trips, and the spirit of Che Guevara who, via a Ouija Board, imparts to him the dazzling theory of WOWism, about how television destroys the individual spirit. Though named in honor of Lenin, Babylen opts instead to believe in his \u201cBabylonian\u201d destiny, and secretly searches for the beautiful goddess Ishtar, who becomes for him a symbol of fortune. Meanwhile, the people around Babylen - clients, colleagues - perish in the violent dog-eat-dog world of new Russian capitalism.

Tatarsky is invited to join an all-powerful PR firm run by a cynically ruthless advertising genius, Leonid Azadovsky, who invites Tatarsky to participate in a secret process of rigged elections and false political advertising. And as a result of his brilliance, Tatarsky achieves the ultimate, as he creates and gets elected a \"virtual\" president.

The film Speculates as to why Murasaki wrote The Tale of Genji.\nThe story begins with Murasaki Shikibu obtaining instructions from Fujiwara no Michinaga to write a tale in which would educate his daughter, Fujiwara no S\u014dshi, so that his \u2018blood\u2019 may enter the bloodline of the Emperor\u2019s. Murasaki then begins to write The Tale of Genji and reads it out to Michinaga, S\u014dshi, and others.\nWith Murasaki narrating the story, we learn about Genji\u2019s past, from his mother, Kiritsubo Consort, to his coming-of-age and his looks charming those at court. Genji was unable to become the crown prince due to the lack of support from the court, but was allowed to live in the inner court. He is then married to the daughter of the Minister of the Left, Aoi no Ue, who does not open up to Genji so easily.\nGenji then has an affair with Lady Rokujo and Yugao. Lady Rokujo was still mourning the loss of her husband, but Genji expressed his affection and wooed her. Lady Rokujo being a woman of pride and jealously, is deeply hurt by Genji\u2019s relationship with Yugao and Rokujo\u2019s spirit ended up killing Yugao. Rokujo\u2019s spirit returns later on to also kill Aoi.\nDuring Aoi\u2019s pregnancy the world of Genji and reality merges as Abe no Seimei enters The Tale of Genji in order to prevent Rokujou from killing Aoi while she was giving birth. Here Seimei warns Michinaga that Murasaki\u2019s wickedness will come alive and harm them, which is not the first time Seimei has mentioned to Michinaga about this \u2018wickedness\u2019 in Murasaki. Michinaga responds with the simple statement that he was the one that started her ability to write such a tale, therefore he must take responsibility for it. Despite Seimei\u2019s efforts to save Aoi from Rokujo\u2019s spirit, Aoi is still killed by the spirit.\nGenji, having a long time love for Lady Fujitsubo had an affair with her in which led to her being pregnant with his child. Emperor Kiritsubo comments on Fujitsubo\u2019s pregnancy calling her his light (hikaru), which is ironic as it is also Genji's name. Upon the birth of the child, the Emperor also mentions how the baby has a strange resemblance to when Genji was an infant. Not too long afterwards, the Emperor passes away, noting to Genji that if Genji were appointed as his successor as he wanted, then both of them wouldn't have had to suffer. All these facts adds up to the belief that the child that Fujitsubo gave birth to is not the Emperor's, but Genji's.\nUpon the deaths of Yugao and Aoi, Rokujo tells Genji that she will leave in order to protect him because if she were to stay he would just continue to suffer. Respectively, Murasaki also informs Michinaga of her departure in which Seimei states, \"She withdrew herself before her soul turned evil.\"\nIn the last scene we find Genji and Murasaki crossing paths. He confronts her, asking: \"When will you stop torturing me?\" In response Murasaki answers that his happiness is not possible and continues on her way.\nThis rendition of the story focuses greatly on the possibility that Murasaki wrote The Tale of Genji as an outlet for her extreme feelings and desires for Michinaga.

The girls with whom she does not make a connection are slightly suspicious of her. Haley's behavior changes drastically. She disobeys her parents and is rude to her sister. Her mother, Melissa (Anne Heche) endeavors to make allowances for Haley's attitude and is more lenient than her father, Ray (James Tupper).\nOne day, the popular girls discover the harsh comments that Haley posted online and they feel betrayed. The girls decide to physically attack Haley, while videotaping it. They also plan to post the images online. Clueless about this revenge plot, Haley is invited over to Alexa's house. The girls are waiting by the door and once Haley steps inside, the girls taunt her, calling her names and savagely beat her, until she falls unconscious, suffering a concussion, a ruptured eardrum, and a damaged left eye in the process.

While riding in the couple's minivan, Amy is revealed to be pregnant again when the elderly woman notices the symptoms, shocking Teddy.\nWhen they arrive in Las Vegas, Nevada, Teddy, who is shocked by the revelation, asks Amy why she didn't tell her about it and Amy explains to Teddy that she and Bob originally planned on announcing her pregnancy to the whole family on Christmas, but then they notice their luggage has been stolen when weren't looking. At the condo swimming pool, Bob gets a phone call from Amy about her and Teddy's situation, which prompts him to drive to Las Vegas to pick up the two as he borrows Hank's car, with PJ and Gabe tagging along while having Petunia look after Charlie while they're gone. While walking through the streets, Amy and Teddy get into another argument. Amy blames Teddy for getting them lost in the first place, and Teddy retorts that Amy's ego combined with her pregnancy has been more hindrance than help. Losing her patience, Amy accidentally blames Teddy for ruining Christmas when she disembarked the plane. Extremely hurt, Teddy disowns Amy as her mother and runs off in tears while Amy becomes ashamed over her actions. Hungry, the mother and daughter do a street performance Christmas carols mixed with staged fights to get money for dinner.\nIn a restaurant, Teddy and Amy encounter Jordan, a girl who had stolen their luggage, and confront her. She breaks down in tears and explains how she became stranded after running away from home to go to a cross-country music festival, which her mother forbade her from attending. Sympathizing with Jordan, Amy calls Jordan's mother and smooths things over, and Teddy gives her plane ticket to Jordan to help her get back home for Christmas. This gesture helps Teddy and Amy reconcile from their previous arguments, and Amy finally acknowledges that Teddy is responsible as they rent a bike from a bike rental store owner, who just so happens to the original owner of the car rental store that he sold.\nMeanwhile, as PJ, Bob, and Gabe are driving through a desert, they find themselves mistakenly kidnapped by a red-colored team of paintball match participants who tie the trio up in their base, thinking that they're trying to take the Stone of Mitrios, a huge kryptonite-like souvenir from the paintball match. Knowing what's going on, Gabe explains how Chuck Jablowsky, the multi-gazillionaire creator of Galaxy of Death, also owns his own game-based paintball-tournament that he holds every Christmas Eve. They manage to get untied (With the help of PJ who got free easily thanks to the sunburn ointment) and Gabe decides that they should participate in the tournament in order to return to the car. Using his knowledge of the game, Gabe wins the match and even meets Chuck Jablowsky. Out of gratitude for them wearing the same-coloured uniforms as his yellow team, Chuck offers the trio a free helicopter ride to find Teddy and Amy at a diner that the two had arrived at after biking all night from Las Vegas.\nHank and Petunia also arrive with Charlie by car, and the entire family is finally reunited. Petunia even reveals that she found a star-shaped tree topper, which Amy lost earlier in the film, that got stuck in her car's mechanisms. As the family begin their Christmas celebration in the diner, Amy admits not only that they finally got the Christmas vacation they wanted, but also that this was the best Christmas they've ever had, which helps her and Teddy make up. Amy then announces that she is having another baby, much to the excitement of both the Duncans and the Blankenhoopers.\nIn the epilogue, on the way back home to Denver, Colorado, Gabe attempts to bring the Stone of Mitrios on the plane ride back, but it is taken away by a flight attendant. Another flight attendant then announces the offering of a free plane ticket, which Teddy quickly accepts once again. Amy says to Bob, \"Your turn\" and Bob obediently goes after Teddy, jokingly promising Amy that they will be back by New Year's Day. Amy smiles in response and says that she knows they won't.

The Grave Encounters crew consists of Lance, occult specialist Sasha Parker, surveillance operator Matt White, cameraman T.C. Gibson, and fake medium Houston Grey. The crew is invited to examine the abandoned Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital, where unexplained phenomena have been reported for years. Kenny, the hospital's caretaker, takes the crew on a day tour and informs them of the hospital's history, particularly of a doctor named Arthur Friedkin, who performed unethical experiments and lobotomies on the hospital's patients before being killed by them.\nThe crew lock themselves inside the hospital for the night and begin their investigation, setting up camp near the main entrance and positioning static cameras throughout the building. No paranormal activity seems to occur within the first few hours until T.C. captures a door slamming behind him. The crew attempts to establish contact with any entities that might be in the hospital; they soon hear unexplained sounds, and Sasha's hair appears to be lifted into the air by an unseen force.

They are successful but find that the stairs are blocked off by a randomly built wall blocking their escape.\nThey decide to back track and while looking at a map on the wall, the arrows on their compass spin in random directions. The group hear what sounds like Matt screaming and run through the halls hoping to find him. \nOnce they find the room where they heard Matt's screams, they encounter a metal bed frame that levitates into the air and they run in terror.

The group comes across a woman in a hospital gown and when they catch up with her, her face distorts grotesquely. They flee from the entity in fear, and Houston is separated from the other crew members. Houston wanders the halls in the darkness and is then lifted into the air and choked before a bright light bursts from the end of the hallway which sends Houston flying and kills him.

He is crass and confrontational, regularly indulging in drugs and alcohol even while on duty. He is also shown to have a softer side, showing concern for his ailing mother, Eileen.\nBoyle and his new subordinate, Aidan McBride, investigate a murder, with evidence apparently pointing to an occult serial killer. Shortly after, Boyle attends a briefing by an American Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent Wendell Everett, sent to liaise with the Garda in hunting four Irish drug traffickers led by Francis Sheehy-Skeffington, who is believed to be awaiting a massive seaborne delivery of cocaine from Jamaica. Boyle recognises one of the men in Everett's presentation as the victim of the murder he and McBride had been investigating. McBride pulls over a car driven by Sheehy and his lieutenants Clive Cornell and Liam O'Leary and is shot dead. McBride's wife, Gabriela, reports McBride's disappearance to Boyle, who promises to look into it.\nThe strait-laced Everett suggests that he and the unorthodox Boyle team up to track down Sheehy and his men. Everett makes the rounds, encountering Irish-speaking residents who pretend not to understand English rather than deal with an outsider. Boyle has a sexual encounter with a pair of sex workers at a hotel in town. On his way back from the hotel, Boyle spots McBride's Garda car at a \"suicide hotspot\" along the coast but does not believe that McBride killed himself. McBride's wife, Gabriela, an immigrant from Croatia, reports him missing and tells Boyle that McBride is gay and that she married him to obtain an Irish visa as well as to make McBride \"look respectable\".Meeting Everett at a local pub, Boyle notices a closed-circuit television camera and remembers that the original suspect in the murder case claimed to be frequenting it at the time of the killing. Looking over the footage from the time of the murder, they see that the suspect's alibi is valid \u2013 and Everett also spots Sheehy and Cornell at the pub. Cornell delivers a payoff to the Garda inspectors to keep them off the case but Sheehy believes that Boyle will not be so easily swayed, after he meets with Boyle to half-heartedly attempt blackmail and then to offer a bribe, which is refused. Tipped off by a young boy named Eugene, Boyle discovers a cache of weapons hidden in the bog by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) and says he will arrange its return. (It is later revealed that Boyle kept a few of the guns.) Shortly after having her last wish to hear a live pub band fulfilled, Boyle's mother kills herself by overdosing on pills.\nMeeting at the bar again, Everett tells Boyle that Garda sources indicate Sheehy's shipment will be coming into County Cork and that he is leaving to investigate. Returning home, Boyle is confronted in his living room by O'Leary. Boyle pulls a Derringer (from the IRA cache) and kills O'Leary, then calls Everett to tell him that the Cork lead is a decoy arranged by corrupt officers. Boyle drives to the local dock where Sheehy's vessel is berthed and Sheehy's men are unloading the cocaine. Everett arrives and Boyle hands him an automatic rifle and persuades him to provide covering fire as he moves to arrest Sheehy and Cornell. Boyle kills Cornell before leaping onto the boat to deal with Sheehy. Everett's gunfire sets the boat alight. Boyle shoots Sheehy and leaves him for dead in the main cabin as the boat explodes.\nThe next day, Everett looks out on the water where the boat sank, believing Boyle to be dead. Eugene, standing nearby, mentions that Boyle was a good swimmer, having placed fourth at the 1988 Summer Olympics, a claim that Everett had dismissed.

Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy; he senses Draco's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry, who captured it from Draco. A horcrux, Helga Hufflepuff's cup, is found in Bellatrix's vault, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons them. Trapped by security, they release the dragon guardian and flee Gringotts on its back. Harry has a vision of Lord Voldemort at Gringotts, furious at the theft. Harry also realises a Horcrux connected to Rowena Ravenclaw is hidden at Hogwarts. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade and are helped by Aberforth Dumbledore, who reveals a secret passageway into Hogwarts, which Neville Longbottom guides them through.\nSeverus Snape knows Harry has returned and threatens to punish any staff or students who aid Harry.

As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. In the boathouse, the trio overhear Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; Nagini then viciously attacks Snape. As Snape dies, he gives Harry one of his memories. Meanwhile, Fred Weasley, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\nHarry views Snape's memory in the Pensieve: Snape despised Harry's late father James, who bullied him, but he loved his mother Lily. Following her death, Snape worked with Albus Dumbledore as a double agent amongst the Death Eaters, to protect Harry from Voldemort. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and planned for Snape to kill him. It was Snape who conjured the Patronus doe that led Harry to Gryffindor's sword. Harry also learns that he became an accidental Horcrux when Voldemort's curse originally failed to kill him; Voldemort must now kill Harry to destroy the soul shard within him. Using the Resurrection Stone that had been stored in the Golden Snitch bequeathed to him, Harry summons the spirits of his parents, Sirius Black, and Remus.

He learns that the mansion's caretaker died two days ago from a heart attack due to the house being haunted. Although he refuses to believe this at first, he meets a rag picker telling him that only he will be able to stop the haunting.\nMysterious things happen over the next few nights, exactly at 3:00 am. Rehan saves himself from a few fatal attacks, hears repeated screams of a woman, sees a girl singing and playing the piano who vanishes when he opens the door; a book drops from a bookshelf on its own and Rehan finds a letter inside. The suicide letter, written by Meera Sabharwal to her parents, tells her story from 1936 when they left for Delhi to attend her brother's wedding and left her behind with her nanny Margaret, a servant and a driver, so that she could prepare for her upcoming exams. In their absence, her piano teacher Iyer tried to rape her during her lessons. However, she saved herself by hitting him hard with a candle stand on his head, which resulted in his death. Soon, the police corroborated Meera's story, as they found a few personal items and explicit sketches of hers drawn by Iyer in his house. However, Iyer, obsessed with Meera, returned in the form of an evil spirit, killing her servant first, then her driver and last of all, Margaret, leaving her all alone in the mansion. He raped Meera repeatedly for the next six days, who ended up committing suicide in despair. Rehan soon realizes that even after her death, her spirit is trapped and tortured inside the mansion by Iyer's spirit to this day.\nAfter reading the letter, he feels sympathetic and brings a psychic, Mrs. Stevens to help, but the woman leaves after realising how much evil and obsessive Iyer's spirit is and asks Rehan to do the same, but he ignores her warning and stays there, challenging Iyer by repeating his name (as it is believed that saying an evil spirit's name makes it more powerful). However, Iyer's spirit appears before him, warning him to get out of the mansion and violently throws him out. Rehan tries to get in again, hearing the screams, but Meera's spirit appears before him too, saying that Iyer will never let him free her from his captivity. A tearful Rehan steps back and kneels down in despair before the thundering mansion, echoing with Meera's screams.\nThe next morning when he wakes up, he finds the rag-picker in front of him, casting a spell. The spell sends him back 75 years to 17 August 1936, the day when Meera's parents leave for Delhi. Rehan befriends Meera by being shown the way to the city by her, calling himself to be a lost newcomer to the town. The next day, in order to prevent Iyer's death, Rehan arrives at Glen Manor with a basket full of chocolates for Meera as a gift for showing him the way to the city, seconds before Iyer could carry out his intention. Rehan says that he would like to listen to Meera's performance as he is also interested in music, but Iyer asks him to leave. Rehan insists on staying outside the door so he will not interfere in their class and can still listen to her music (so that he could come to Meera's help if Iyer tries to assault her). As Rehan waits outside the room, Iyer unexpectedly hits him with a stick on the head, throwing him out on the lawn. He bolts the door from inside and tries to assault a horrified Meera. Injured and bleeding, Rehan staggers his way to the door. But, as written in fate, before he could do anything, Meera kills Iyer. A distraught Rehan is admitted to the hospital by Margaret and Meera, where he dreams about Iyer's spirit, saying that he knows he is from the future, his real motive for being there, and says that he will not let him succeed.\nRehan wakes up from the dream the next morning and rushes out of the hospital to save Meera's servant, who, according to her letter, was going to get killed. He is horrified along with Meera, Margaret and the driver when he finds the servant to be dead already. Desperate for her cooperation to help her out, he explains everything to Meera and Margaret and asks them to meet him the next day at noon. The next day, the three of them visit a priest, who tells them that far from the town is a Dargah, a mosque where there is a Sufi Baba who could help them. He tells them to start the journey at 3:00 pm because spirits are weakest at this point of time and they would be safe from Iyer but warns them about the time of 3:00 am, because at this time, all spirits are at their strongest. As it gets dark, the three decide to stay in a hotel. At night, Iyer's spirit possesses Margaret's body through a telephone call and tries to rape Meera again. Rehan fights it and takes Meera straight to the Dargah.\nMeera, concerned about Rehan's safety, tries to leave him without caring for herself and calling herself the cause of the whole problem, but Rehan convinces her to let him help by professing his love for her. Both of them share a kiss. Meanwhile, the priest, who was praying for Meera is killed by a snake, who was probably Iyer's spirit. Margaret, still possessed, is present in the forest through which Rehan and Meera are going to the Dargah. She follows and attacks them, but Rehan stabs her in the abdomen with a sharp wood log. Assuming her to be dead, they both bury Margaret's body under some heavy logs. However, she rises from beneath the logs and chases both of them by flying in the air. Margaret kicks Rehan in the head and takes Meera with her in the air (as Iyer wants Meera), but Rehan realises that in the process of escaping, they have reached the Dargah.\nRehan grabs Margaret's foot just as she was about to fly off with Meera, and manages to put it at the doorstep of the Dargah, thereby forcing Iyer's spirit to leave through the hole in Margaret's abdomen and throwing off her dead body. Inside they find the same rag-picker who sent Rehan into the past, revealing himself to be the Sufi baba.\nHe tells them that a mile away is a town that was blessed by Khwaja, where there is a well which makes anything reach its place where it belongs to, and in which Meera has to show the way to the spirit, which is connected to her through his blood stained on her pendant when she killed him. As they reach the town, they have to drop the fire, soil, and the pendant (as the well works along with the five elements, water and air, being already available). As Meera is performing the act with Rehan by her side, both are interrupted by Iyer's spirit, but Rehan manages to throw the pendant into the well at the last moment, and the spirit is dragged into it. Thus, saving Meera, Rehan accidentally falls into the well too, as was in store for him, and reaches back to the year 2011. He finds another letter written by Meera to him in the same place, thanking him for gifting her a new life and saying that she was distraught at first for losing him forever, but then decided to live a happy life, in order to give importance to the invaluable gift bestowed upon her.

Asked to dinner by his mistress, Lotte (Julie \u00d8lgaard), Roger declines and ends their relationship. Roger's wife and art gallery owner, Diana (Synn\u00f8ve Macody Lund), introduces him to Clas Greve (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), a former executive for GPS tech company HOTE. Roger, currently seeking to recruit the next CEO of rival firm Pathfinder, recognizes Clas may be a suitable candidate. Diana reveals that Clas has asked her to authenticate a lost Rubens painting he inherited that is believed to be worth millions.\nRoger convinces Clas to meet with him over lunch to discuss the job, and soon learns Clas used to be a member of TRACK, a special forces unit that specialized in tracking people and winner of the European Military pentathlon. He also learns that Clas helped HOTE develop a nanotechnology GPS tracking gel that is difficult to remove. Despite his misgivings, Roger meets with Ove to work out details on stealing the painting. Roger manages to steal it from Clas' home, but he discovers Diana's cellphone beside Clas' bed, implying the two of them are having an affair due to Roger's refusal to have children with Diana. In retaliation, after a seemingly successful meeting with Pathfinder executives, an upset Roger flippantly informs Clas that the company may be looking for someone else to fill the position.\nThe next morning, Roger finds Ove in his (Roger's) car, apparently dead from a poison syringe embedded in the car seat; just as Roger dumps Ove in a lake, Ove recovers, as he did not get a full dose of the poison. Driving Ove to his cabin, Roger puts him in bed and ignores his demands for medical attention, as he does not want the police involved. Ove pulls a gun in response, causing a shoot-out where Roger accidentally kills Ove. Finding Clas has followed him to Ove's cabin, Roger narrowly escapes after a scuffle. After realising Clas may have use HOTE's GPS gel technology on him, Roger switches his car for Ove's and throws his clothes in a lake, changing into Ove's spare uniform and fleeing to a farm where Ove used to stay. Nevertheless, Clas tails Roger to the farm with his dog and murders the farmer, but Roger evades them. Trying to escape on a tractor, Roger is attacked by Clas' dog, which he kills by impaling it on the tractor's forks. Roger, believing Clas is still chasing him, drives erratically and falls from the tractor, only to find his pursuer is a stranger wanting to help.\nWaking in a hospital, Roger learns the police think he is Ove, and arrest him for the farmer's murder when he tries to escape. Driving to the station, the officers pull over to block a truck reported stolen. Roger realizes that Clas is driving the truck, and that Diana may have helped Clas by rubbing the GPS gel into Roger's hair. With Clas approaching, the officers ignore Roger's protests, allowing Clas to ram the car off a cliff. Playing dead until Clas leaves the scene, Roger shaves his head and hides his hair on a deceased officer's body, then swaps clothes with a detective's disfigured body to fake his death.\nRoger turns to Lotte for help, only to discover she is working for Clas. Clas, who is still secretly employed by HOTE, was planning to use Roger to get the Pathfinder job and steal their secret technologies. Lotte admits that she put the GPS gel in Roger's hair, absolving Diana, and that she suggested dinner so she could introduce him to Clas; since Roger ended their affair, Clas used a counterfeit Rubens painting to meet Roger through Diana. When Roger lets his guard down, Lotte attacks him with a knife, causing Roger to shoot and kill her in self-defense. Roger returns home and admits everything to Diana, who apologizes for her affair with Clas. The next morning, Roger goes to a morgue to retrieve the remaining evidence linking him to the murders (his cut hair), while Diana contacts Clas to ostensibly resume their affair.\nWhile cleaning Ove's cabin of evidence, Roger is confronted by Clas, who was able to track the GPS gel in the cut hair. Clas gloats that Diana has returned to him, and tries to shoot Roger but fails. Roger fatally wounds Clas with a hidden gun, explaining that Diana only resumed their affair so she could load Clas' gun with blanks. Ove's home security records Clas involved in a shootout, though Roger stays in a camera blind spot near Ove.

They are heading for the mountains, where rumor has it that water can still be found. They scavenge wrecked cars and gas stations for extra gas, water (from heating pipes and toilets), and food, always alert for hostile survivors who might attack them.\nWhen the trio finds a ruined gas station, Phillip tries to obtain gasoline from the station's underground tanks and abandoned vehicles while the women scavenge for supplies in the buildings. While the trio are working away, a hooded man steals food and water from their car and then holds Leonie as a hostage. After Phillip and the attacker fight and the aggressor is subdued, they agree to a truce of sorts. The attacker, Tom, tells them he is a mechanic. Phillip agrees to bring Tom along as a passenger in the car, on their search for water, if Tom will repair the heat-damaged engine. The quartet drive along through the roads towards the mountains until they stop due to a huge metal structure that is blocking the roadway. The group work together to move the blockage and then three of the group climb down a hill to look at a wrecked car for items to scavenge, leaving Leonie in the car alone.\nSuddenly, the group hear Leonie's screams, and they realize the blocked road was a trap. Leonie is abducted by carjackers. Although the others try to help her, it is too late. When the trio of remaining survivors reunite in the woods, Tom convinces them to try to free Leonie. Tom spots smoke in the distance and encourages the group to investigate. The smoke is coming from a large fire at a survivors' encampment, where Leonie and other hostages are kept chained up. Tom convinces Marie and Phillip, who are both terrified of the abductors, that they should throw a Molotov cocktail to create a diversion so that Marie can take the car back and rescue Leonie. The rescue attempt misfires; Marie manages to get the car started and escape with Phillip, but Phillip could not break Leonie's chains so the pair leave without her; moreover, Phillip's foot is badly injured during the escape after fighting off one of the abductors. Phillip encourages Marie to consider Leonie a lost cause, but Marie insists on trying to rescue her. Marie leaves alone to search for Leonie. Marie falls asleep in a ruined church, and is awakened by a middle-aged woman named Elisabeth. Elisabeth offers Marie water and invites her to come to her family farm as a guest.\nMarie sleeps in Elisabeth's barn, only to awake to find herself locked in. Peering out the slats of the barn, she sees what looks like abducted captives being led about. Elisabeth opens the locked door and tells Marie that Phillip will be used like livestock, in the absence of other food and that Marie and Leonie will be forced to marry the sons of the farmers. When Elisabeth's son Micha opens the door, Marie engages in kissing with him, but then strikes him with a large piece of wood. Injured, Micha tries to choke her, but then Leonie smashes a heavy object on him, knocking him out. Leonie escapes from the barn and hides in the woods, but Marie is bound and put in the slaughterhouse after refusing to eat human flesh during dinner. Marie witnesses Phillip's execution, but manages to cut her ziplock cuffs and escape. She opens a locked door in the barn, where she finds many captives, including Tom. The captives flee from the farm, with the family in pursuit. Tom fights with and dispatches several of the farmers. Marie manages to escape and runs through the woods in search of Leonie. When she finds her, Leonie is being bound by one of Elisabeth's adult sons. Elisabeth confronts Marie, who kills her with a captive bolt pistol she stole from the slaughterhouse. While the adult son mourns Elisabeth, Marie releases Leonie. The two sisters and Tom flee to the mountains, where they find water. Up in the sky, they see birds.

Tensions rise when Emma, Steven's sister and Nico's girlfriend, expresses frustration with their lack of closure. She demands that her mother reveal the contents of Steven's videotape, which she has been obsessively watching in private.

She works for socialite Elizabeth Leefolt, raising her two-year-old daughter Mae Mobley, whom Elizabeth neglects for being chubby. Aibileen's best friend, Minny Jackson, works for Mrs. Walters and her manipulative daughter Hilly Holbrook, who leads the women's socialite group.\nElizabeth and Hilly's mutual best friend Eugenia \"Skeeter\" Phelan is an aspiring writer and unmarried, recent graduate of Ole Miss who has been rejected by a New York publishing house. After securing a local job writing a housekeeping column, she grows increasingly aware of poor and demeaning working conditions of the city's maids, including Hilly's insistence on installing separate bathrooms, a practice she wants enshrined in building code. Skeeter learns that her mother Charlotte has fired Constantine, the maid who raised her, and decides to write a book of interviews with maids as a way to further her career.\nMinny is soon fired by Hilly for defiantly using an inside bathroom during a tornado that causes multiple fatalities. A vindictive Hilly renders Minny unemployable by telling other housewives that Minny has stolen from her, forcing Minny's teenaged daughter to quit school and take a job as a maid. Aibileen overhears that Celia Foote, a \"white trash\" housewife ostracized by the socialites, seeks a maid. Celia, encumbered by a large, inherited house and limited cooking skills, gratefully hires Minny without telling her husband Johnny, Hilly's former love interest. Celia suffers a miscarriage, and reveals to Minny that she was engaged to Johnny after becoming pregnant, then miscarried. Celia and Minny discuss Hilly's jealousy of Celia and unrequited love for Johnny. Celia cares for a black eye Minny's husband has given her.\nAibileen agrees to Skeeter's interview after a dynamic sermon from her pastor, as does Minny. Elaine Stein, Skeeter's editor at Harper & Row, tells her that she needs more than two maids' stories to write a book, but fear of violent retribution or job loss prevents other maids from coming forward. Aibileen tells Skeeter about her struggle to cope with the death of her only son, who died of negligent care by his foreman after an on-the-job accident. Skeeter slow-walks a piece in the Junior League newsletter on the \"separate but equal\" bathrooms for Hilly, instead creating a misprint that embarrasses her.\nHilly refuses to advance money to her new maid, Yule May, who asks for $75 so she can send twin sons to college. Yule May discovers a lost ring under a sofa and pawns it, and is violently arrested after Hilly reports her. This incident and the assassination of Medgar Evers inspire more maids to tell Skeeter their stories.\nSkeeter, Aibileen, and Minny fear the maids' stories will be recognized. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" as a form of insurance: after her termination, Minny brought Hilly her famous chocolate pie but explains \u2013 after Hilly had finished two slices \u2013 that she had baked her own excrement into it; Hilly later forced her mother into a nursing home for laughing at her during the incident. \nSkeeter confronts her mother about Constantine's departure. Charlotte confesses that during a Daughters of America luncheon at her home, she fired Constantine because Constantine's daughter Rachel disobeyed her order to enter the house through the kitchen. Rachel subsequently moved a heartbroken Constantine to Chicago, where she later died. Learning this, Skeeter bursts into tears and runs from the room.\n\"The Help\" is published anonymously and read widely by black and white Jackson. Skeeter divides the proceeds among the maids, who receive the equivalent of several weeks' pay each, with \"more to come.\" Skeeter's boyfriend, Stuart, deduces she has written the book and breaks up with her because it is disruptive. Minny reveals the \"terrible awful\" to Celia, who writes a check to a Junior League cause, made out to \"Two Slice Hilly\". Increasingly panicked, Hilly threatens to sue Skeeter for libel, but backs down when Skeeter reminds her that she would have to publicly admit to the pie story. Charlotte intervenes, showing that she knows about the \"terrible awful\", and orders Hilly off the property. Skeeter and her mother reconcile. \nJohnny tells Minny he knows she has been working at his house, and that she has permanent job security because of her compassion for Celia and excellent cooking. The promise of future employment makes it possible for Minny and her children to leave her abusive husband. Members of Aibileen's church honor her for her leadership in the publication, and town members sign books for Skeeter and Aibileen. Minny and Aibileen encourage Skeeter to take a job offer in New York because she has burned bridges by publishing the book. \nSeeking revenge, Hilly pressures Elizabeth to fire Aibileen, claiming she has stolen silverware.

While Lloyd initially appears friendly, his true nature shows through when he viciously berates Eddie for a perceived mistake (Eddie retaliates by urinating in Lloyd's drink, which goes undetected by Lloyd). Eddie tells Luli that Lloyd and Glenda want to be alone, so he takes her to a bar.

Eddie interrupts them in a drunken outburst, and the two leave the motel.

Cassie is struggling; her relationship with her two daughters, Amy and Hannah (Skye Lourie) is fractious. She is struggling to run her farm and her financial situation is so bad that she can no longer afford to pay Cooper. She is visited by a sinister neighboring farmer, Karsten (Terry Stone), who is eager to buy Cassie's farm and marry her, both of which Cassie declines.\nEnter Aden (Vincent Regan), an old friend of Dean's who was passing. Quick to cover up her secret, Cassie tells Aden that Dean left. Aden asks if he can stay the night, and after some convincing from Amy, Cassie reluctantly concedes. The next day, Aden persuades Cassie that he can be of use to her on the farm and Cassie allows him to stay on, much to the displeasure of Cassie's 16-year-old daughter Hannah who immediately dislikes Aden, sussing out his intentions of getting \"into my mum's knickers\".\nKarsten's interest in Cassie escalates as his jealousy of Aden mounts. He throws around irrational threats, gloatingly kills one of Cassie's calves and builds a roadblock denying Cassie access to the outside world.

When he returns to the farm without Hannah, Aden strikes Cassie, exposing his true deranged nature in front of Cassie, who walks him off her property at gunpoint while making it clear that if he ever comes back, she will kill him.

Chris returns to the house where Scott has deduced that Alex is the spirit haunting the cornfield and the only time it is safe is when Alex is possessing the body of a new victim and is upstairs sewing a mask since he can only occupy one body at a time.

Dr. Mortimer Granville (Hugh Dancy) is a young physician who has difficulty with his occupation due to constant arguments over modern medicine. He gets a job assisting Dr. Dalrymple (Jonathan Pryce), whose practice specializes in the treatment of \"hysteria\", a popular diagnosis for women of that time. Medical practitioners like Dr. Dalrymple tried to manage hysteria by massaging the genital area, decently covered under a curtain, to elicit \"paroxysmal convulsions\", without recognizing that they were inducing orgasms. Granville meets Dr. Dalrymple's daughters, Emily (Felicity Jones), and her older sister Charlotte (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a premodern feminist who runs a settlement house in a poor section of London.\nGranville seems to be good at massaging, getting a sizeable following, while at the same time Dr. Dalrymple suggests he might eventually take over the business and marry Emily. One night after work, Charlotte comes in with her friend Fannie (Ashley Jensen), who has broken her ankle. After he helps treat her, Dalrymple forbids Granville from offering any future assistance to Charlotte, hoping to dissuade her from her work in the slums. Meanwhile, the increased clientele at the practice is hard on Granville, and his hand musculature is unable to keep up with the task; an attack of cramp results in his dismissal. Fortunately, his friend, Lord Edmund St. John-Smythe (Rupert Everett), has developed an electrical feather duster, and its vibrations give Dr. Granville the idea of modifying the gadget for use as an electric massager. After successfully using it on the Dalrymple's maid Molly (Sheridan Smith), he persuades Dr. Dalrymple to try the device on his patients, resulting in massive success. Mortimer and Emily then become engaged, while Charlotte struggles with supporting the welfare house.\nAt the engagement party, Charlotte is arrested while protecting Fannie from a police officer. Emily and Dr. Dalrymple urge Granville to testify at her trial that she is hysterical in order to prevent her from being sent to prison. During the trial, the prosecutor recommends that Charlotte be sent to a sanatorium and be forced to undergo a hysterectomy. As Mortimer speaks, he explains that the symptoms for hysteria are too common to be regarded as a mental illness, and that he himself believes that Charlotte is the most generous and caring person he knows. The judge agrees with Mortimer's argument, and Charlotte is sentenced to just thirty days in prison for her assault on the policeman.\nEmily decides to end her engagement to Granville, after realising her only motive was to please her father. The vibrator now enters the stage as a medical device for the treatment of the condition, reducing treatment time while greatly increasing customer satisfaction.

They enjoy the evening together, but many of the patrons are killed and Danijel is badly injured when the club is destroyed by artillery fire, signifying the opening salvo of the Bosnian War.\nSome months later, Ajla and her sister Lejla prepare to flee the now besieged city, but their neighborhood is occupied by the Army of Republika Srpska before they can escape. The men are separated from the women, and then taken away to be executed, while Ajla and several other younger, more attractive women are taken away on buses to a Serb rape camp.\nIn the camp, the soldiers instruct the women on what life will be like and then ask the women what sort of duties they can perform. A doctor named Esma volunteers to perform medical services. Another woman says she can sew; rather than use her skills, an officer rapes her in front of the other women to demoralize them. Before another soldier can do the same to Ajla, the camp's commander takes her away, where it is revealed he is none other than Danijel.\nThe former couple struggle to grasp the magnitude of their predicament, especially given that inter-ethnic relationships are forbidden, and any evidence of such a relationship could compromise both Danijel and his father Neboj\u0161a, a General of the VRS Main Staff. Danijel tells Ajla that to shelter her from sexual abuse at the hands of the other soldiers, he has said that she is his \"personal property.\" They begin an intense love affair, but Ajla is deeply disturbed by the horrors of the camp, and she subsequently makes numerous attempts to escape, all of which fail. The escape attempts greatly anger Danijel and compound his paranoia; he frequently lashes out at her.\nDanijel's unit is involved in ethnic cleansing massacres directed by Neboj\u0161a, although these tactics do little to change the situation at the front line. A frustrated Neboj\u0161a learns of Ajla's existence and the special treatment she receives; he chastises his son for being affectionate towards \"the enemy.\" Danijel remains coy, insisting he is doing his patriotic duty. Fearing the repercussions if their relationship is exposed, he allows Ajla to escape.\nAjla shelters herself in the forest outside the city, where she is found by Bosniak guerrilla forces, who take her back to their camp. In the camp, she happily reunites with Lejla, though this happiness is short-lived when Lejla informs her that her baby died some months earlier, sending her into inconsolable grief. Over a campfire, the guerrillas lament the paradoxical insanity of the war, one in particular pointing out that he feels he hates Serbs, yet his own mother is a Serb. Lejla blames Danijel, who has gained notoriety for his prominence in the siege amongst the anti-Serb forces. At this moment, Ajla informs the camp she was his prisoner, and the guerrillas concoct a plan for her to return to the camp and act as a mole.\nAjla returns to the camp claiming it's the safest place for her, leading a confused but grateful Danijel to rekindle their relationship. Shortly after her return, a soldier in the camp, Darko, is killed by an improvised explosive device, orphaning his infant child. Neboj\u0161a, learning of her return, immediately suspects her involvement. While Danijel is at the front line, Neboj\u0161a visits Ajla and orders her to paint a portrait of him. While she paints, he criticizes the \"Muslim decadence\" of such a career, which contrasts starkly with his own mother, a lifelong farm labourer widowed during World War II. Ajla counters that her grandfather was a Partisan, and that he taught her as a child that the constituent peoples of Yugoslavia are all equal irrespective of ethnicity. Neboj\u0161a smirks at her observation then leaves her alone with a soldier, Petar, who violently rapes her.\nDanijel returns from the front line to find a distraught Ajla crying in the shower. Believing that she has cheated on him, he assaults her, but then sees his father's unfinished portrait and knows what has transpired. Danijel lures Petar to a hill above the city, then kills him. He then confronts his father, who attacks him and berates him for disgracing the family, saying \"your mother would turn over in her grave if she knew you liked to fuck Muslim whores.\"\nA sense of normalcy descends on Ajla and Danijel up until the events at Srebrenica.

Danijel narrowly avoids being killed alongside his father when a massive explosion destroys the church (whether or not Ajla had a role in the attack is left ambiguous).\nIn conjunction with the bombing, ARBiH forces simultaneously launch a counter-offensive. Danijel hastily organizes his troops to halt their advance, but the Serb forces are decimated and most of his men are killed.

Soccer is now integral to social status, and as a result, the world of youth soccer is currently under the authoritarian rule of the Fifth Sector organization. A junior high school student, Matsukaze Tenma, is leading his soccer team, Raimon, on a revolution against them. After being abducted by Fifth Sector, the members of the Raimon team find themselves on an unknown island. Tsurugi Kyousuke, who used to work as a SEED for Fifth Sector before turning against them, recognises the island as God Eden, an island that Fifth Sector uses to train young soccer players into become SEEDs, by drawing out powerful avatars.\nRaimon are confronted by the manager of God Edan Kibayama Douzan, the manager God Eden, and they are made to play a soccer match against a team of trained SEEDs called Unlimited Shining. Tsurugi recognises the team captain, Hakuryuu, from his time as a SEED. Raimon suffers an overwhelming defeat and are severely injured in the process.

With the aide of the adults, they begin training for the match. During their training, Tenma meets a boy who apparently lives on the island, called Shuu. Shuu challenges Raimon to a match against his team called Ancient Dark, and displayed a great degree of skill. However, the match comes to a close with no score after Tenma interrupts the match to stop the ball from hitting a baby lamb, an act of kindness that catches Shuu's interest. Shuu gives Tenma special training, involving climbing a waterfall cliff-face, while the others continued their own training.

Similarly, the other Raimon players use their training to gain the upper hand, however, the tide turns back against them, and the match becomes increasingly more violent. Endou, unable to just stand by and watch any more, joins the match temporarily alongside the former Inazuma Japan members.

He steps out his truck to see the problem when the Iron Invader comes and kills him, the same way how Greg was killed.\nAmanda, her daughter Claire and her aunt are at the house when the Iron Golem attacks, killing the aunt. Amanda and Claire flee to the town, to find the sheriff. While Jake went to send a finder's fee to Greg Aupolous's house Iron came to the inn and killed Ethan. Jake returns to find Ethan dead and sees Iron walking away. Jake alerts the sheriff, but Earl also hears the report on his CB radio and they drive to the inn. Jake scolds at Earl for thinking Iron is a robot that he created when he arrived. The sheriff calls the town coroner to check on Ethan's body to see how he died and finds that his arteries and veins were infected and swelled. Jake denies the coroner's statement and goes off to hunt Iron.\nThe sheriff returns to the police station where Amanda and Claire approach him. Soon, lights all around begin to flicker. Inside the local pub, Max, bartender Tony (Chris Gauthier), and Harry see this too along with Earl in his car which suddenly died. Out the window, Tony sees Amanda, Claire and the sheriff, along with Iron coming their way. Claire turns and runs while Iron chases her. Claire falls and gets a bloody forehead. Right before Iron grabs her, Max appears and helps her escape. Jake returns in his car and sees Iron. Jake attempts to ram Iron until his car dies as well, but he managed to break off Iron's leg, causing it to fall apart. The infected pieces are still alive however, and one them grabs the sheriff and kills him. Jake gets Amanda and they and Earl hide in the pub with Tony and Harry.\nThe kids run into Deputy Jenny (Chelah Horsdal), who doesn't believe the kids, who goes to see and have the kids locked in her car. While crying over the dead sheriff, Jenny is infected and dies. In the inn, the adults examine the goo covering only the blade of an ax and find out that the goo is an alien bacteria that feeds off metal, sucking the metal from human blood (humans have metal/iron in their blood) and killing them. Outside, Iron puts himself back together, and Claire and Max are still locked in Jenny's dead car (it was revealed that Iron causes static electricity and effect electronics which make the car inoperable) as Iron tries to grab Claire. She is touched, but not harmed.\nIn the inn, they discover that, with blood, they can trick Iron into exploding. Jake and Amanda get gasoline and cover the tank with Amanda's vein blood. They plan to shoot it when Iron is close enough. With the blood, Iron is still worried about Claire. So Amanda unwraps her arm, releasing her scent of blood, attracting Iron. Max then escapes out of the car.\nIn the inn, the infected metal ax blade puts itself into Tony's leg, killing him. Harry and Earl go through different anti-bacterial things but to no avail. But when Earl goes outside to check on Max and Amanda reenters the pub, a beer bottle spills on it and begins to dissolve. Harry then realizes that the bacteria hates alcohol when he accidentally drops his glass on the axe-head, so he and Amanda run outside with it.\nIron gets close to the gasoline, Jake shoots, and he explodes. Pieces fly everywhere, knocking out Max, Earl, and Jake. A flamed piece lands on the hood of Jenny's car, and Claire barely escapes. Although a big explosion, the Pieces are still alive. Claire runs over to Max and tries to wake him up. Jake puts the beer into a spray container, and begins to spray the Pieces, killing the flames and the bacteria, while the others throw beer bottles. A little car engine makes its way to Max. Before it can infect him, Amanda appears and sprays it down. The mother and daughter are reunited. Max awakens and hugs Claire.\nThe next morning, Jake, Amanda, and Earl go to the junkyard to crush the pieces. While doing so, Earl releases his special beer, and the three share it. Jake says the government didn't believe the story and they are coming to arrest him. Outside, he and Amanda share a kiss. Earl comes out, just in time to see the metal springing back to life, forcing Earl to break the special bottle in order to stop the last fragment. When Amanda asks if he has any more special beer to douse the yard and ensure the bacteria's destruction, he pauses, then says \"Do bears crap in the woods?\", a phrase he said early in the film.", "tmdb_plot": "A local artist uses the wreckage of a crashed Russian satellite in his giant sculpture for the town's centennial celebration.

We learn she has won a place at Oxford University, revealing her struggle, as a young lower-middle-class woman, attempting to break into a snobbish male-dominated Conservative Party and find a seat in the House of Commons, along with businessman Denis Thatcher's marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a \"Lady Member\" of the House, and as Education Secretary in Edward Heath's Cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with Airey Neave, her decision to stand for Leader of the Conservative Party, her eventual victory, including her voice coaching and image change.\nFurther flashbacks examine historical events during her time as Prime Minister, after winning the 1979 general election, including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget (over the misgivings of \"wet\" members of her Cabinet \u2013 Ian Gilmour, Francis Pym, Michael Heseltine, and Jim Prior), the 1981 Brixton riot, the 1984\u20131985 UK miners' strike, and the bombing in Brighton of the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Conservative Party Conference, when she and her husband were almost killed.

Her deputy, Geoffrey Howe, resigns after being humiliated by her in a cabinet meeting, Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership, and her loss of support from her cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but reluctantly to resign as Prime Minister after eleven years in office. A teary-eyed Thatcher exits 10 Downing Street for the last time as Prime Minister with Denis comforting her.

It ended with the King signing Magna Carta, a document granting rights to all English freemen.\nKing John regrets succumbing to the pressure of the barons to sign Magna Carta.  Soon after, he hires an army of pagan Danish mercenaries under the leadership of a warlord, Captain Tiberius, to restore John's absolute authority over the kingdom, under the presumption that the Pope has agreed to keep Christian missionaries out of their lands in Denmark.\nThe Abbot Marcus leads three Templar knights (who have taken vows of silence) on a pilgrimage to Canterbury and they take shelter from the rain at Darnay Castle. One of the knights, Thomas Marshall, is assured by the abbot that Marshall's release from the Templar Order will be sought at Canterbury. By morning, King John arrives at the castle with his army and mercenaries. Baron Darnay signed Magna Carta and in retribution John orders him hanged. The Abbot attempts to intervene and the King orders that the abbot's tongue be cut off. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall escapes the castle on horseback carrying the abbot; the two knights left behind are slain. The abbot dies before night of his wound, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain.\nOnce he has reached Canterbury, Marshall meets with Archbishop Langton, the author of Magna Carta, and Baron William d'Aubigny, a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be excommunicated for writing Magna Carta. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do so is Rochester Castle, the seat of Baron Cornhill and a strategic stronghold that controls southern England and allows access to London and the rest of the country.\n\nd'Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire, Guy, and a petty criminal named Jedediah, but a fourth turns down the baron's call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for Rochester where, on arriving, they discover several Danish mercenaries have already claimed the castle; the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny's party fights and kills the Danes, and then claim Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Cornhill. When John's army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men leave if they wish; none accept.\nA second assault sees the Danes' siege tower destroyed by a trebuchet crafted by the defenders from within the castle. John's forces then attempt to starve out the defenders. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off in haste to expedite affairs. As the season turns to winter, the hunger of the castle's occupants continue; Marshall leaves the castle under cover of night and then returns ahead of his pursuers with food stolen from the Danish camp. The castle morale is bolstered by Marshall's act and he gives in to the advances of Cornhill's young wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows.\nThe Danish leader, Tiberius, threatened by John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next attack and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos, d'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight's battle armour and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep.\nAubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then hurled by the castle trebuchet into a keep wall. Cornhill tries to surrender but is stopped; he goes instead upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself. John's engineers have been preparing a mine under the keep's foundation, and they have a herd of pigs brought and put in the mine which is then stoked, set afire and the animal fat used to damage the keep's foundation, causing it to collapse; as the keep's walls come down, the final assault begins.\nThe last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, the latter knocked unconscious by falling rubble. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed, until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after a long and savage duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and French army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order.

Their line snags what they think is a corpse but it suddenly awakens and attacks them, ending with Lazaro shooting it in the head with his spear gun. They think nothing of it at first and go about their business as usual, which involves thuggish activity and associating with their less than reputable friends: Lazaro's vain, Americanized pretty-boy son Vladi California; drag queen La China, who is also an expert slingshot marksman; and China's hulk-like lover Primo (who faints at the sight of blood and has to wear a blindfold when fighting).\nThe only emotional bond Juan has is with his daughter Camila (Andrea Duro), a young and beautiful girl who wants nothing to do with her father because the only thing he does is get in trouble. Suddenly a strange series of events begin to occur: people everywhere suddenly become violent and attack each other at random. After an encounter with an elderly neighbor's reanimated body, Juan comes to the conclusion that it is not vampires nor possession by demons, but capitalist dissidents. Lazaro attempts to flee with a woman he and the others have rescued, but Juan follows him to the raft they are trying to escape on. The woman falls into the water and is lost to them, leaving Lazaro with little reason to refuse Juan's plea for him to stay, and that Juan needs his sidekick.\nTo Camila's dismay, Juan's idea to take advantage of the situation is revealed: He starts a business, which he rationalizes will also be a great help for other survivors, with the slogan: \"Juan of the Dead: we kill your beloved ones. How can we help you?\" For a price, the five men in the group enter homes and slay the zombified residents. Although extremely proficient in dispatching their quarry in open streets, they suffer from bad luck and high civilian and resident casualties on indoor missions. That, coupled with allowing their corruption to come out (by looting and even attacking humans that Lazaro claims owe him money) puts strain both on his relationship with his daughter, and the success of their business.\nThe group is later rounded up by a shady military group, forcing them to strip naked and get into a truck. It seems they are recruiting able-bodied males to fight the zombie threat but some of the others who were rounded up before were infected, and they reanimate, causing a riot in the back of the truck and flipping it over, enabling Juan's group to flee, and further blunders on the military's part remove any hope they have of any kind of rescue or victory over the undead. China, who was bitten during the truck incident, dies and reanimates while handcuffed to Juan, and Vladi and Camila struggle to figure out a way to extricate Juan from his predicament. Juan finally throws China off the roof of their safe haven and Camila throws him some oil to lubricate zombie China's hand, letting him slip out of the cuffs and fall.\nThe zombies have become too numerous to continue the group's business operations, forcing them to stay on rooftops for safety, sending Vladi out on one-man food retrieval missions which endears him to Camila. At this point the group is whittled down to Juan, Lazaro, Primo, Vladi, and Camila, the latter two having become romantically involved despite Juan's disapproval. Losing hope, they decide to try heading for the mountains which may be unpopulated and safer. An escape attempt via motor vehicle is thwarted by mechanical failure (and the fact that none of them knows how to drive), forcing them to flee on foot while pursued by hundreds of undead.

He tries to tell the group what he knows about the situation in English, but the language barrier between them prevents him from divulging his plan to end the disaster, which he believes has religious implications. He is then accidentally killed by another of Lazaro's spear gun incidents, forcing the desperate group to come up with yet another plan for escape, and berating Lazaro for his continual screw-ups.\nSheltering in a deserted parking garage the man had led them to, Lazaro amazingly comes up with a plan to make up for his repeated failures. According to his idea, they construct a flotation mechanism out of empty oil drums and attach them to a convertible, with the intention of attempting to drive through a group of zombies on the street and out onto the beach, where they can reach the water. They plan to float to Florida (where Camila's mother is known to be staying), hoping America might be safer. Lazaro confides to Juan that he had been bitten during their earlier escape, and they share an emotional goodbye while they wait for him to change, until it's revealed it was only a harmless scratch.\nJuan and Lazaro fight the zombies standing in their way to clear a path to the water for the car to drive over. Juan hears a child's crying and goes to investigate. He rescues a little boy from his zombified father and brings him to the car. Lazaro and Juan create a ramp of bodies for the car to jump over the wall separating the street from the sand, and the car makes it into the water.

Big Ed, the gang's second-in-command, then evicts the dead gangsters (who seem otherwise alive), after asking them to identify themselves: \"Those of you who have been killed, stand facing the wall.\" They leave reluctantly, and the gang waits for Ulysses. The film's narrator, the ghost of Ulysses's father-in-law Calypso/Camille (Louis Negin), reveals that the house is haunted (and not only by him) because although a house's happiness is able to vacate the premises after its inhabitants have left, its sorrow is doomed to remain inside forever. This house had once belonged to Ulysses and his four children with his wife Hyacinth (Isabella Rossellini).\nUlysses himself arrives, carrying a drowned young woman named Denny. After entering the house, Denny is able to stand under her own strength, and seems alive although injured and blind. She reveals that she can hear the thoughts of Ulysses as he wanders through the house, examining the objects that he had previously left behind. Calypso reveals that Hyacinth remains in Ulysses's former bedroom at the top of the house, where she has chained him (her father's ghost). Ulysses and Denny join the gang, who are confused about their plan (and don't understand why the police haven't shot their way into the house). Ulysses deflects questions about the plan and claims that the police won't enter the house while the storm is still in force. Big Ed, annoyed at being kept in the dark, criticizes Ulysses for adopting Heatly after he killed one of Ulysses's sons, and is thrashed.\nCalypso reveals that although he is chained to Hyacinth's bed, his chains stretch to unknown lengths, and torments Ed further through supernatural flogging. Ulysses collects the gang's guns and throws them into the ducts to be destroyed in the house's furnace. The gangster Ogilbe (Kevin McDonald) thinks he hears a noise and goes to investigate, exiting with a Scream-esque \"I'll be right back.\" He is immediately killed when he tries to have sex with one of the ghosts even though Ulysses just warned him not to bother the ghosts (upon contact with a washerwoman ghost, he's electrocuted\u2014his ghost shortly completes the sex act). The bullets from the guns that had been thrown into the furnace begin to fire throughout the house (the laughing face of Calypso suggests that this is somehow the ghost's doing) and a stray bullet kills Heatly. As he dies, Ulysses reveals that he had at first adopted Heatly to torture him and himself as revenge for the death of his son but grew to love Heatly more than any of his sons. (Ulysses is unaware, as he says this, that the hostage who watches/hears is his only living son, Manners, having forgotten and failed to recognize him.)\nUlysses disposes of the corpses of Heatly and Ogilbe in the bog located in the house's centre (Hyacinth's secluded outdoor garden located in a quadrangle within the labyrinthine house). Ulysses gathers his scout knife, the stuffed wolverine Crispy, Denny and his hostage son and sets forth into the house to find Hyacinth, ordering his gang to stay put but leaving the untrustworthy Big Ed in charge. Ulysses orders Denny to stay focused on reading his memories and forget about drowning, since he has forgotten too much to find Hyacinth without her help. She recounts his memory of coming home early to find Hyacinth at home alone, running naked with the family's dogs. Ulysses remembers being distressed at how the episode revealed the extent to which Hyacinth was a stranger to him, even though at the same time this moment was when he loved her the most. Ulysses contemplates the first of the house's many locked doors (which \"all have to be opened\").\nIn her bedroom at the top of the house, Hyacinth is startled by Calypso screaming awake from a nightmare of a young girl drowning. Calypso begs Hyacinth for release from his chains, revealing that Hyacinth is now sleeping with Chang, and Hyacinth fondly remembers her son Manners. Calypso tells Hyacinth that Ulysses is in the house coming to either save or kill Hyacinth (or both). Ulysses himself then speaks to Hyacinth through the keyhole of the first locked door, offering her his scout knife and convincing her to pretend he isn't there, allowing him to open the door. Ulysses investigates the room (the blind, drowned Denny helps him \"see\" the room as it once was) and begins remembering past events. He discovers the ghost of his son Brucie masturbating/playing Yahtzee in a cubbyhole (but doesn't recognize him or his milk-drinking ghost son Ned). Calypso's narration reveals that the hostage is Ulysses's only surviving son, Manners (also unrecognized). Meanwhile, the gangsters have begun to construct an electric chair. Ulysses makes another offering to Hyacinth (of Ned's bowl) to have her allow him through a second locked door.\nA doctor (Udo Kier) has been summoned to examine Denny. The doctor relates the tragic story of his only son's death, which occurred earlier that day from a fall that broke his neck and was followed by a wasp attack. In the next room (a bathroom), Denny bathes Manners while Ulysses remembers trying to console Hyacinth in her grief. The girl climbs into the bath with Manners, and Ulysses remembers accidentally breaking Ned's bowl after his death, upsetting Hyacinth. Denny discovers a secret passage that passes the \"cyclops\" (a penis sticking out the wall: \"That penis is getting dusty,\" remarks Ulysses).

Dottie approves of the plan and Chris arranges a meeting with Joe Cooper, a police detective who has a side career as a contract killer. Before the meeting, Dottie tells Joe that Adele tried to kill her once when she was an infant.\nSince Chris and Ansel are broke, the plan almost falls apart when Joe demands $25,000 in advance. However, Joe is interested in young Dottie,  an 18-year-old, and offers to take her as a \"retainer\" until the insurance money comes through. Joe seduces Dottie and they start a relationship. Digger has his goons beat Chris, injuring him badly, and threatens to have him killed unless he pays what he owes. Chris has a change of heart and asks Joe to call off the hit and stop seeing Dottie, only to discover that he has already killed Adele. With Chris' reluctant help, Joe hides the body in a car and torches it.\nAfter Adele's death, the family learns that the insurance beneficiary is actually Rex, Adele's boyfriend, rather than Dottie. Chris then admits he originally heard the details about the policy from Rex, who also told him about Joe, thereby duping Chris into hiring Joe to kill Adele. Ansel blames Chris for the fiasco and tells him he should just kill himself. Chris tries to persuade Dottie to run away with him to escape Digger and Joe, both of whom expect to be paid. Dottie agrees to go with Chris if she can see Joe first.\nAfter Adele's funeral, Joe pulls Rex over in his car and Chris buys an illegal pistol. When Ansel and Sharla return home, they find Joe inside with Dottie. He comes out of her room and asks increasingly pointed questions of Sharla, leading her to admit that she knew the policy was really for $100,000, since accidental death doubled the payout. Joe shows them a check of that amount payable to Rex, implying he is dead, as well as offering incriminating photos that prove Sharla was having an affair with Rex. Angered, Ansel declines to protect Sharla when Joe chokes her, punches her, and forces her to simulate oral sex on a fried chicken drumstick.\nJoe knows Chris is coming to take Dottie away, and threatens to kill Ansel and Sharla if they don't stop him. After Chris arrives and is seated for dinner, Joe announces that he and Dottie will be married. Chris rejects this, ordering Dottie to leave with him. Joe tells her to stay where she is, but Dottie stands up and walks away as both men yell at her. When Chris threatens Joe with his gun, Sharla stabs Chris with a steak knife and Joe tackles him. Ansel and Sharla rush to assist Joe as he savagely beats Chris, not wanting to be killed if Chris flees with Dottie. Dottie recovers the gun and, in a rage, fires several shots, killing Chris and seriously wounding Ansel. Dottie turns the gun on Joe, telling him that she is pregnant. Joe appears overjoyed as he inches closer to Dottie.

The police catch Ashwin, and to prove that he is a press photographer, he shows the photos to them, who identify everyone except the gang leader (whose face is covered by a mask). At his office, he again meets Renu, who has newly joined as an article editor. He slowly falls in love with Renu. Saraswathi 'Saro' also works in his office and has feelings for Ashwin, who does not reciprocate.\nSettled in her new job, Renu writes a cover story about a politician Aalavandhan, describing his attempt to marry a minor. Enraged by this, Aalavandhan barges into the newspaper office and shouts at Renu. The audio recording of her interview disappears (courtesy of Aalavandhan), and she is fired from her job for falsified reporting. Ashwin later risks his life to capture the pictures of Aalavandhan, who actually engages in child marriage in a temple at midnight. Later the story with the photos is printed in their newspaper, and this makes Renu reciprocate Ashwin's love. Saro is initially jealous of the love between Ashwin and Renu but later accepts it and gets over Ashwin. Meanwhile, Vasanthan Perumal, an engineer and recent graduate, strives hard to enter politics by contesting in the upcoming election. He is contesting against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money.\nNobody cares about Vasanthan and his team of graduates, who promise a healthy government to people. Their party name is Siragugal (wings).

One night, Vasanthan's party organizes an election campaign meeting. While photographing the event, Ashwin receives a text message from Saro that states there is a bomb underneath the stage where Vasanthan is speaking. Ashwin manages to save Vasanthan just before the bomb explodes. Later, Ashwin finds Saro fatally wounded near the blast site. Saro struggles to tell something to Ashwin and Renu before she dies. Ashwin, through a video clip recorded by another photographer, discovers that Saro was intentionally killed by someone. He later notices a resemblance between the leader of the bank robbery and this unknown killer, concluding that the Naxalite leader killed Saro.\nA few days later, Renu notices that Vasanthan's photo in their newspaper was cut from a college class photo, where Ashwin is also present. It is revealed that Vasanthan is Ashwin's former college mate. Confronted by Renu, Ashwin tells her that he and Vasanthan studied in the same college and were best friends. He also tells her that he is happy for Vasanthan's success and is wholeheartedly supporting his election campaign. In the election, Vasanthan's party wins by a huge majority, and Vasanthan becomes the Chief Minister. He orders the release of 20 Naxals on Republic Day, citing humanity. Shocked on hearing this news, Ashwin rushes to the secretariat to meet Vasanthan. In Vasanthan's office, Ashwin notices that the Naxalite leader who killed Saro is there, talking with Vasanthan. Ashwin airs his grievances to Vasanthan, who ignores him. Ashwin follows the leader to his hideout.\nAt the same time, Vasanthan orders the Tamil Nadu Police (T.N.P) to go kill the Naxals at their hideout, and the commandos surround the perimeter of that place. Ashwin, already at the hideout, confronts the Naxalite leader Kadhir, and finds out from him that Vasanthan had made a deal with the Naxalites to help him win the election. They orchestrated events such as the burning of a hut and saving the woman in that hut (who was also a Naxalite) to win people's sympathy. In the same vein, they had planted a bomb on the stage where Vasanthan was speaking during his meeting. Saro had found out the truth about Vasanthan but was fatally assaulted by him so that she does not reveal his intentions to anyone. Ashwin realises that Saro had tried to warn him and Renu about Vasanthan's true character before dying and also that now Vasanthan is double-crossing the Naxalites and is planning to kill them as a show of achievement.\nAshwin records this confession using his mobile phone camera and sends it to Renu, who plans to publish this story in their newspaper.

Horrified by the genocide, Shen's parents banished him. Many years later, Shen and his army raid villages for scrap metal, hoping to build cannons which Shen can use to conquer all of China.\nMeanwhile, Po is enjoying his new role as a Kung Fu Master alongside the Furious Five, though Master Shifu warns him he has not yet achieved inner peace.

Cochrane, much to his dismay, finds out that the W Group will be bought by a Russian industrialist called Nazatchov, who is at odds with Largo since he once attacked him during a business meeting. Since the prices were lowered, Nazatchov now has enough money to buy the group and already pays 5 billion dollars in advance. In Burma, Largo and Malunai arrive at a local hotel, where they rekindle their romance, and she reveals to Largo that Noom is his son, having impregnated her before he left. Largo contacts Gauthier, who has found Simon, and instructs him to arrive at the hotel. Meanwhile, General Min, who escaped the base, arrives at a rendezvous point where he is picked up via helicopter by a Serbian mercenary called Lazarevic, who informs him that he is not on Min's payroll, but actually is working for someone else, and strangles Min to death.\nGauthier and Simon meet up with Largo, and Simon reveals that he was paid by a man named Thomas to drive him through Burma. He arrived with him at General Min's base, where he paid in advance for Min to organize the massacre using the Pandora account. However, when Nerio found out about the massacre, he refused to let Thomas to pay the rest of the money, and he was shot by Min while Simon secretly observed this from the car while he was behind the walls. Simon left, picking up the rest of the survivors among the way, before he arrived at the village where Largo stayed at. Later on, Malunai reveals that she was abducted by Lazarevic's mercenaries, and Largo finds a tracking device in her. Just then, Lazarevic's mistress Anna and another henchman arrive, and Largo manages to kill both of them, but not before Anna strangles Malunai to death. Largo picks up Noom and he leaves with Simon and Gauthier. Soon after, Lazarevic arrives at the hotel, and, after finding his man and Anna dead, he swears revenge against Largo.\nLargo contacts the private bank again and transfers only 7 dollars to another account, and then contacts Cochrane, who is in the car with Nazatchov, and informs him that he is heading to Zurich. Nazatchov, overhearing this, instructs Lazarevic to go to Zurich and kill him. However, Largo heads for Bangkok and secretly tails Lazarevic's group, who is departing in a private jet. He and Simon tie up the pilots in their hotel room and take their uniforms and await for Lazarevic, who board the plane, and they head for Zurich, intending to tail Lazarevic when they land. However, during the flight, Lazarevic finds out about the pilots and they corner Simon and Largo. They fight them, and Simon opens the plane doors, causing a decompression which ejects Simon out of the plane. Largo jumps out with a parachute, and Lazarevic follows them. In mid-air, Lazarevic fights Largo, who knocks him out and disables his parachute and saves Simon, while Lazarevic dies after falling on the ground.\nMeanwhile, Francken finds out about the 7 dollar transfer and investigates Lazarevic's account, finding out that he was on Nazatchov's payroll, realizing that Largo is being set up. Largo and Simon go to Jung's house, and Simon stays in Jung's house while Jung takes him to Francken to clear out his name. However, when they arrive at the UN building, Jung injects him with a strong sedative, and reveals that Thomas is actually his son; Thomas worked for Nerio by making new deals across the world, and set up the secret bank account Pandora for Thomas to pay to the locals in exchange for information. Thomas instructed General Min to organize the massacre since the area was rich with nickel. However, Nerio was unaware of the massacre and when Thomas informed him about this, he refused to authorize him to pay the rest of the amount, disgusted by Thomas's actions.  Jung also reveals that he made a deal with Nazatchov, who would take over the company in exchange for help, and that Lazarevic killed Min on Jung's orders, and that Largo was the scapegoat so he would be humiliated and sentenced to prison for life as a revenge.\nJung leaves to kill Francken to kill her so he could prevent her to clear Largo's name, while Largo lies sedated on the floor, unable to move. However, Simon, who found pictures of Thomas and realized Jung's plan, arrives at the UN building and gives Largo sugar to remedy the effects, and Largo instructs Simon to call the police while he heads to rescue Francken. He finds Jung holding Francken at knife point, and shouts about Thomas's immoral and unethical actions, which Jung refuses to accept, wanting Largo to beg for Francken's life just as he begged Nerio to save Thomas. However, Francken momentarily distracts Jung, and Largo runs up to him and knocks him over the stairwell, killing him.\nIn the aftermath, Largo is cleared of all charges by Francken, and Nazatchov is unable to buy the company since the stocks have raised high after Largo's name was cleared.

Kika very loudly begins asking for candies, which causes Beto to become nervous. While waiting for Kika to come back from a house that is far down the street, Beto spots an eerie figure going in her direction. In order to save his sister, he calls out the ghost's name, \"La Llorona\"; she hears and precedes to chase after him. Kika finds Beto missing, looks for him, and finds him just in time to see him taken by La Llorona near the creek.\nSometime later, a balloon with a ship basket carrying five companions is flying over the town. The companions are Leo San Juan, a young boy, Don Andres, an old knight (similar to Don Quijote), Alebrije, a fire-breathing colorful dragon-like creature and Moribunda and Finado, two skeleton-like kids resembling calaveras (sugar skulls). They're heading toward the village in response to Padre Tello's letter which asked for their help. They summon a ghost friend Teodora, who has helped them in previous adventures, but she disappears right before the storm after teasing Leo. During the storm, Moribunda falls out of the basket, and Leo saves her, but falls from the balloon into Kika's boat, who's sailing down a river at the time, possibly looking for Beto. Kika accidentally knocks Leo into the water, then discovers his letter from Padre Tello, and then accidentally hits him with her paddle, knocking him out (she pulls him out of the water offscreen). Kika sees the damaged balloon he's fallen from heading toward La Isla de las Mu\u00f1ecas (Dolls' Island).\nSan Juan wakes up at Kika's house under her and Beto's mother's care. The mother, Rosa, tells him a story of La Llorona, whose name was actually Yoltzin instead of Mar\u00eda. Yoltzin moved to Xochimilco with her two kids: Ollin and Tonatiuh. She sold flowers to provide for her family and became well-liked in the village. Everything changed one day when they were coming back home to find their house on fire. Yoltzin jumped off the boat, desperate to save the house, but forgot her kids on the boat, which drifted away with them still on board. When she realized that they were floating away, it was too late and they disappeared without a trace. Villagers helped her searching for the kids. Days later, though, Ollin and Tonatiuh were found dead near a channel, possibly due to drowning and their bodies must have washed up onshore. Yoltzin didn't accept her children's death. She was driven crazy with grief and remorse and died, with having nothing left to live for. After her death, the villagers started to hear ghostly moans. Yoltzin had become La Llorona, a specter who came out at night to kidnap children, though with no intent to harm them; rather, she seemed to want to take care of them, maybe to make up for failing to take care of her own children or actually believing they are her children. Padre Tello followed La Llorona for years, trying to find out how to appease La Llorona until he disappeared. San Juan leaves Kika's house to find his friends and figures out the mystery of where Beto and the other kidnapped kids are with help of Padre Tello's journal. Kika follows him, telling Leo that he needs her. La Llorona attacks Leo and Kika, injuring Leo, but Kika helps him and listens to his plans to find the old church where Ollin and Tonatiuh's graves are. Padre Tello's book says that \"Yoltzin has to see\" the graves to be at peace. Once again, Leo and Kika are chased by La Llorona, but this time Kika is kidnapped and Leo loses her trail.\nMeanwhile, at Isla de las Mu\u00f1ecas (Doll's Island), Andres is tangled in vines. After a lot of screaming, he is rescued from the puppets by Alebrije, who was all covered in green slime after falling in the lake and mistaken for a monster. Andres and Alebrije free an old man from a cursed hand puppet named Pecas, who was animated by the tears of La Llorona, who had previously cried at the creek and had been forcing the old man to make puppets for her. The old man thanks them and tells them where to find La Llorona.\nLeo San Juan asks Teodora to help him seek La Llorona and distract her while he looks for the old church where Yoltzin's kids were buried. Leo goes into a sunken church, and inside he finds Kika and other kids sleeping. He sees that La Llorona has been taking care of them and that they were unharmed. He runs deep down in the church until he finds the church's crypt and searches for Ollin and Tonatiuh's graves. He finds a broken part of the kids' graves when he's looking for his dropped necklace (with a picture of his deceased mother inside) and puts it back into the grave, fixing it. Kika angers La Llorona, telling her to let the other kids go, and she almost has her soul taken by La Llorona but Leo saves her. La Llorona grabs Leo and starts taking his soul, causing him to pass out, then captures his friends by animating vines that had overtaken the sunken church. When she is about to hurt them, Leo calls out to her and shows her child's name in the grave. When La Llorona sees their names, she begins to see the unconscious Leo and Kika as her children, dead. Overcome with guilt, she collapses to her knees and cries. However, all the tombstones begin to glow and Ollin and Tonatiuh appear. She is reunited with her kids and thanks Leo for his help. Leo sees his mother one last time while he is unconscious. Soon, all of them (except Leo) depart from the living world and go to the world of the dead. Other kidnapped children wake up including Beto. Back in the village Leo and his friends say farewell to the villagers, then get ready to go back to their hometown when Padre Godofredo's ghost appears and urges them to help another town in distress.

She comes by the birthday present train and attempts to follow it to the Real World, but she is suddenly stopped by the Tower. Little Engine then tries to pull several boxcars for Big Locomotive, but she ends up causing traffic for the other engines with the Tower reminding her that she is only supposed to pull one boxcar at a time due to her small size. Little Engine later gets help from Rusty (Jim Cummings), who is an old but wise engine.\nIn the Real World, a boy named Richard (Dominic Scott Kay) shows his best friend, Marcus, his grandfather's pocket watch. Two bullies named Scott and Stretch throw a snowball at Richard, which makes him slip and accidentally hand the watch over to them. He is worried that his dad would be disappointed that he lost the watch. Marcus tries to help him with some suggestions on how to get the watch back, but Richard does not want help from him at all. Richard then decides to take a walk in the park, but trips over some train tracks he has never noticed before and happens to finds a train nearby. He boards one of its boxcars to take shelter from the freezing cold conditions, unaware that it is pulled by Rusty (who is sleeping on the job) and suddenly wakes him up. He immediately returns to Dream Land not realizing that Richard is inside the boxcar. While passing through the tunnel to Dream Land, the tunnel collapses, trapping Richard and the trains in Dream Land. After Rusty informs the others what happened, Richard climbs out and is both confused and scared by the talking trains. The Tower realizes that Richard's presence in Dream Land has damaged the dream-reality continuum and can only be fixed if Richard is returned to the real world. She sends some of the engines to dig out the tunnel and is forced to demote Rusty to a track-cleaner, much to Little Engine's dismay. She then offers to fix Dreamland. The Tower (sarcastically) agrees, sending them both on their way while also promising to give Rusty his job back afterwards (and even throw him a Ticker-Tape Parade). While searching for the old tracks, Little Engine and Richard find themselves being chased by the Evening Express, who can not slow down to avoid hitting them. Richard, who suddenly believes that he is dreaming, tries to fly but ends up falling on the Evening Express. He manages to get back onto Little Engine but they are both pushed off the track by the Evening Express. After rolling through the hills, they manage to get back onto the tracks. They suddenly find the birthday present train, which had derailed when the tunnel collapsed. Little Engine decides to take the train to the real world herself and attempts to get information from the other engines about the old tracks, but they don't believe the tracks exist. Little Engine, Richard and the toy gang decide to find the tracks themselves.\nLittle Engine manages to find the old tracks that led up the mountain. Along the way, they come across an old, rickety bridge that partly collapses when trying to cross it. Richard barely falls off but is saved by Little Engine and Ace the Jet Plane. They use an old cargo hook pole as a makeshift rail for the bridge to get across to the other side. Late that evening, Little Engine runs out of water due to a leak in her water tank (which was caused from the collapsing bridge), causing the birthday present train to roll downhill backwards until Richard manages to stop it by applying Little Engine's emergency brake. Just then, a black engine appears and offers to take Little Engine's friends to the real world for her. She agrees and trusts the strange engine, but he suddenly betrays her trust and reveals himself as the Nightmare Train, an evil locomotive who can create nightmares and plans to use Richard as a means to send nightmares to the real world and leaves after derailing Little Engine and the birthday present train. In the Nightmare Train, Richard is confronted by hallucinations of the bullies but the others encourage him to stand up to them. Ace escapes and goes to help Little Engine after refilling her tank using water from a nearby water tower. She and the Caboose find themselves still unable to get back on the tracks. Little Engine sees another stretch of tracks below and drops down the cliff, successfully landing back on the tracks. Meanwhile, Richard manages to escape and falls off the Nightmare Train after a failed attempt to uncouple his boxcars. Little Engine soon finds him and they quickly chase down the Nightmare Train. While confronting him, the toys sneak out while Little Engine, Richard and Ace trick him into speeding down a side-track at extreme speed. Major then uses his badge to plug the leak in Little Engine's tank, and they continue their way up the mountain. They eventually make it to the top and travel through a portal that leads them to the real world, where no time has passed at all.\nOnce back, Richard has gained his confidence to stand up to the bullies and get his watch back. The bullies are then caught by the principal, who is annoyed that they aren't in detention. Richard reconciles with Marcus, who is proud of him for getting his watch back. When Marcus asks Richard how he got the watch back, Richard simply tells him that he thought he could (in which he did) and decides to keep his adventure in Dream Land a secret.

When Guan Yu received news that Liu Bei had taken shelter under Yuan Shao, he negotiated with Cao Cao to release Liu's family. Cao Cao agreed, but Qilan remained behind with Guan Yu.

Neil Thomas was declared MIA 60 years ago during World War II. Susan immediately clashes with Caroline's grandson, Lucas Thomas (Faris), when he overhears her referring to the potential story as a fluff piece, rather than the very personal story it is, since she herself doubts if pure and true love exists. She apologizes, and manages to start the interview and starts spending time with both Caroline and Lucas. Her developing friendship with Lucas makes her have doubts about her relationship with her almost fiance, Andrew Hawthorne, a photographer who is frequently absent overseas.\nThe interview with Caroline reveals that for 66 years she has had no information about her husband from the Department of the Navy. She tells her story about how she and her husband met in 1943, married, and then renovated a house they had bought from her uncle (which is where Caroline still lives). After a year, and despite a child forthcoming, Neil felt he should help his country more than just acting as a training officer, so he went into combat. Their last moments together were at the Union train station, where she handed him a handmade valentine professing her everlasting love, as he departed on a train. Caroline remained strong, and sent many letters to Neil. On one occasion, Neil replied with a letter containing a small, handmade whittled wooden sculpture of a fighter plane for the baby. After that Caroline stopped receiving letters. Caroline, along with the entire neighborhood, dreaded the times when a Western Union deliveryman arrived in the neighborhood with a yellow telegram, since this meant that someone's loved one was reported to be dead or missing in action. Eventually, the moment where Caroline received one came, but the telegram stated that her husband was missing in action, so she refused to believe that he was dead. Since then Caroline has returned every year on Valentine's Day to the same train station to wait for him.\nWith the help of a United States Senator (Susan did an unrelated story on him) who puts pressure on the Navy, they locate the Billings family, whose now deceased father Jeff was a gunner on Lt. Thomas' airplane. From a surviving letter by Jeff to his wife we hear the account of the crash and of Morang, a Filipino guerilla, who rescued two wounded crash survivors. Susan turns to Andrew for help because he still has connections to the Philippines where Lt. Thomas was last seen alive.\nPutting past hard feelings over his breakup with Susan aside, Andrew manages to locate the elderly Morang whilst in the Philippines and sets up a video conference between him and Caroline. The story of the fate of Lt. Thomas, Morang says, is that he was badly wounded, but insisted his more seriously injured gunner, Jeff Billings, be evacuated first. When Lt. Thomas had recovered, he joined the Filipino guerillas and fought the Japanese deep behind enemy lines. During a patrol, Lt. Thomas was killed by a Japanese sniper while selflessly trying to rescue a little boy. Morang reveals he knows where Lt. Thomas's body is buried.\nThe U.S. Navy goes to the grave site and returns Lt. Thomas' remains and personal effects to the United States. Caroline is handed Neil's dog-tags, watch, and wallet, which contains her valentine to him, now faded, which he always carried close to his heart. In recognition of Lt. Thomas's bravery, courage, and meritorious service, he is to be posthumously awarded the Navy Cross, Silver Star and Purple Heart. On Valentine's Day Lt. Thomas's coffin is returned to Caroline at Union Station by the U.S. Navy with full military honors, conducted in front of well-wishers and TV cameras, with a tearful Caroline taking her last goodbyes from her beloved Neil to the sound of Taps. Caroline is cheered when Lucas and Susan begin a romantic relationship. The film ends with Caroline, who has found peace and closure, seeing that the rosebush Neil had planted long ago in their garden has a new single bloom, the first in a long time, signaling long-lasting love, as she remembers her romantic moments with Neil in the same garden, to the sound of \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" playing on the radio.", "tmdb_plot": "A young and cynical female journalist learns love may transcend trials and time as she discovers a story that will change her life forever.

Shortly after arriving on board, tumultuous events break out on Earth, eventually resulting in Miller losing contact with CAPCOM and finding himself stranded in orbit alone, forced to helplessly watch events on Earth from portholes 200 miles above his home planet. Miller struggles to maintain his sanity while in isolation by interacting with Polaroid pictures of former ISS crew members left aboard the ship.\nWhen the station has some power glitches, Miller journeys into an unpressurised module of the space station to perform repairs and discovers the 1864 journal of Briggs. Miller reads Briggs's account of the war and becomes enthralled by the mysterious object he is searching for, not realizing he will soon become more familiar with the very same object, and not by accident.\nIn 2045, six years after losing contact with CAPCOM and with a failing oxygen system inside the ISS, Miller puts on a space suit and goes for a spacewalk, deciding that it would be easier for him to detach his tether and slowly drift towards Earth and to burn in the atmosphere than slowly suffocate to death on board the ISS.

He has drawn sketches of people and battles of the Civil War from the journal all over the interior of the ISS. The cramped quarters of the space station have become a rat's nest symbolic of his diminished sanity. He then seems to be contacted from outside the ISS, and to receive instructions to dock and transfer over. He does so, and seems to arrive in a giant uninhabited structure of distinctly human making. It is unclear whether this is real or imagined by Miller, who is now insane.\nMiller wanders around until he happens upon a server mainframe where he finds a book titled A Love Story' As Told by 'You. Inside this book, he finds pictures of Captain Lee Briggs with his discovery, a gigantic cube-like alien object that may have helped advance Human society. In the index of the book, Miller finds a reference to himself and types it into the computer prompt. He then finds himself inside a generic hotel room, where a disembodied voice says:\n\nHow are you doing, Lee? Sorry about this projection, but it's the only way we could reach you. We can't tell you how relieved we are to have you here. Now, before we get ahead of ourselves, we have to tell you something. You're the last one, it's all gone. We understand how you might feel. Connection is perhaps the most cherished thing any being can have. That's the thing. That's why we've been listening.

Throughout the interview, Miguel expresses his contempt for idealism and style.  When he reads a sample of \u00c1ngela's writing, Miguel dismisses much of it, though he says that she is talented.  He asks to keep the sample and invites \u00c1ngela to his friend Luis' house.  Miguel explains that Luis will be gone until Monday, and they will have the place to themselves.  She agrees, and they continue their discussions there over whiskey.  Miguel walks over Luis' paintings, and, when \u00c1ngela objects, he says that Luis would prefer them to be marred by life and experience.  Miguel alternates between cynical advice and derisively ridiculing romantic notions of journalism.  Soon, he enters the bedroom and point blank asks \u00c1ngela to strip naked.  When she balks, he tells her that he has been true to his nature and never hidden his motives.  When she turns to leave, Miguel stops her and says that he hopes she will one day respect him for his boldness.\nAs Miguel smokes a cigarette, he hears the boards creaking, and \u00c1ngela steps through the doorway wearing nothing but an open shirt.  Surprised, Miguel wordlessly spreads paint over her naked body.  \u00c1ngela rises to wash it off, and he follows her to the bathroom.  After they take turns in the shower, \u00c1ngela becomes frustrated when she cannot open the door.  Miguel tries as well and concludes that it has locked from the outside.  The bathroom has only one towel, and both are naked; when he realizes her discomfort, Miguel surrenders the towel to \u00c1ngela.

When Miguel learns that \u00c1ngela is the daughter of a prominent fascist soldier, he describes his run-ins with fascists and failed attempts to seduce \u00c1ngela's eldest sister.  Although initially opposed to bringing in outside intervention, Miguel agrees that the risk of scandal is now outweighed by their desire to leave the bathroom.  However, their cries out the window go apparently unheard.\nAs Miguel becomes despondent about the situation, his age, his attractiveness, and his foolish desire to seduce to a much younger woman, \u00c1ngela turns off the lights, drops her towel, and the two have sex.  Afterward, Miguel dismisses her feelings of guilt and proclaims himself to have a more developed and profound sense of guilt.  \u00c1ngela angrily accuses him of egotism, which she says she will write about in her essay.  They quickly reconcile when a chastened Miguel offers to entertain \u00c1ngela with a story.  The story, framed as an imaginary film that they are watching at the cinema, is about a boy who refuses to leave his bed under any circumstances.  The boy insists that nothing is wrong with him; he simply desires not to leave his bed.  When the boy mysteriously disappears, his parents are conflicted as to whether they should be glad he has left his bed or sad that he has run away.  Before Miguel can end the story, Luis returns to rescue them, summoned by a worker who heard their earlier calls for help.

In 120 AD, the powerful Roman Empire, under the reign of Hadrian, had expanded its rule to the Central Asian countries. During their time of expanding, the great Roman Empire agreed to create an alliance with the Han Dynasty by marrying their two prince and princess, thus uniting the two powers both the East and West. However, the Roman prince, Marcus Carprenius (Gavin Stenhouse), did not agree with the decision. Instead, he wants to be free and not be controlled by politics. The Han princess, Meng Li Hua (Jing Lusi), also wants to be free instead being a pawn in a political game.\nThe Roman fleet sails off from the coast of Arabia to the mysterious peninsula dividing the two great kingdoms. The Roman fleet is struck by a powerful storm, which causes the Romans to lose much of their fleet. They go instead  to the coast of Goa. They are greeted by a local Goan dealer, (Mano Maniam), and later introduced to Merong Mahawangsa (Stephen Rahman-Hughes), said to be the descendant of Alexander the Great himself. Merong is preparing to duel against Sunder (Ravi Sunderlingam), a Goan nobleman who challenged him after finding out about Merong's illicit relationship with the nobleman's sister, Yasodhar\u0101 (Deborah Henry). Merong defeats Sunder and Marcus is impressed by Merong's fighting skill. Subsequently, Merong agrees to escort Marcus to the peninsula while Lycius (Eric Karl Henrik Norman), the Roman fleet admiral returns to Rome and promises to return to Goa with a brand new fleet, carrying the payment in gold for the passage of the prince to the \"Golden Chersonese\". Merong is also promised a ship large enough for him to explore the known world.\nMerong escorts Marcus to the peninsula and is greeted by the Chinese Admiral Liu Yun (Craig Robert Fong). Merong tells Marcus and Liu Yun that this peninsula was where he grew up and it is owned by several tribes. The night before the marriage, Meng Li Hua and her handmaiden, Ying Ying (Nell Ng) agrees to run away and begin a new life in the peninsula. However, Marcus follows Meng, resulting in their first meeting. The royal couple then grows closer to each other as they discover how they both have a common wish of being free from palace life. In the morning, The Chinese and the Romans are attacked by the pirate nation, Garuda. The Garuda leader, Taji (Wan Hanafi Su) uses black magic and sorcery before attacking to weaken their enemies. Meng and Ying Ying is kidnapped by Kamawas (Khir Rahman). Marcus tries to stop Kamawas but is stabbed and falls into the sea. Heavily outnumbered, the Chinese and the Romans are defeated. Merong, enraged by Marcus' apparent death, kills most of the Garuda fighters but is heavily injured and passes out.\nMerong wakes up as he is getting treated by a tribe leader named Kesum (Rahim Razali). Kesum and Embok (Ummi Nazeera), one of the village's nurses treat Merong until he is well enough to fight again. Merong learns that Kesum and Taji were students to a once great magician and a brave warrior. Taji, wanting the great magician's amulet of immortality, kills the great magician during his sleep and led a small band of fighters to terrorise the villages. It was revealed that Merong's mother Lang (Umie Aida) was implied to be killed in the onslaught, which has since haunted Merong's dreams; while Embok was once raped by Kamawas during one of these raids. Consequently, Merong swore revenge to Kamawas. Kesum tells Merong of a prophecy that a great warrior will come and unite all the tribe into one kingdom and defeat the enemy. Kesum believes that Merong is the one. After hearing the prophecy, Merong becomes Kesum's student and begins uniting the tribes.\nIn the island of Garuda, Meng and Ying Ying are held captives for ransoms by Taji and Kamawas. Meng and Ying Ying manages to steal Kamawas a piece of the amulet of immortality. After Merong manages to unite all the tribes, they became one kingdom known as Langkasuka and began a new civilisation. Merong is then suddenly met by Liu Yen, Marcus (who was saved by Liu Yun and gets treated) and a small group of Chinese soldiers. Liu Yun tells Merong that they have to save the princess before she is killed. Merong is then given a ship full of mirrors by Liu Yun. As Merong prepares his fighters to invade the island of Garuda, Embok confessed her love to Merong.\nMerong launches an attack toward Garuda in the morning. The Garuda prepared their ships and outnumbered Merong's fighters at least five to one. Merong revealed that he used the ship full of mirrors to create a similar weapon to the Archimedes Heat Ray and uses it to set all the Geruda ships and boats on fire (along with some of the men). Taji then uses sorcery to make storms and cover the sun with black clouds, rendering the weapon useless. After a heroic speech, Merong and his fighters launch an attack and land on the beaches. After a brief fight, Merong's fighters manage to take control the beach but another wave of Garuda fighters led by Taji came in to destroy the fighters. Merong's fighters fight to their death while Marcus confronts Kamawas, but Kamawas defeats Marcus easily. Before Kamawas could finish Marcus off, Liu Yen came in to stop Kamawas but is killed in the process. Most of Merong's fighters were killed.

Merong arrives to save Marcus and confronts Kamawas. After a brief duel, Kamawas is finally defeated. Merong tries to kill Taji but is stabbed. Merong makes a sacrifice by taking the amulet off and pushing the sword forward, thus killing them both.

Scar, a young male Edmontosaurus, enjoys his life in the Arctic forests with his extended family, and comes across a young male Alaskan Troodon named Patch, who has been feasting on baby Edmontosaurus all summer, but now has to chase smaller, more difficult prey as the baby Edmontosaurus are too large to hunt, which is why Scar and Patch are now best friends. He chases after an Alphadon, but another Troodon grabs the fleeing mammal, and Patch is becoming impatient. The plentiful food for Scar is ending as well, as the dark, cold Arctic winter is approaching. When night falls for the first time, Scar loses sign of the herd and spots a dark shape, which turns out to be a Gorgosaurus, which slices his face as he narrowly dodges the killer blow. Later, a herd of Pachyrhinosaurus arrives and starts to compete for the dwindling food supply, further pressuring the herd's search for food. Scar finds the Edmontonia, his old friend, feasting on rotten wood and insect larvae from a fallen tree branch and tries his luck with mixed success. The sun sets and the Pachyrhinosaurus herd moves on somewhere else in search of food. The winter's approach causes the herbivores to start risking their safety and a young female Edmontosaurus gets killed by the Gorgosaurus as she wanders too far from the herd.\nThe next day, the Edmontosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus herds move south for the winter towards Alberta, while Edmontonia stays behind. She's way too heavy and her armoured body has been storing fat to last her through the long lean months of cold. Meanwhile, Patch and the Troodons are feasting on the dead female Edmontosaurus when the Gorgosaurus appears. The tyrannosaur scares the troodontids away, but is wounded in the fight, and Patch is frustrated and must work harder to find prey. Far away, the dinosaur herd is moving on, until Scar sees a dark shadows, which turns out to be a flock of scavenging Quetzalcoatlus, which feed on the dying herd members that could not keep pace. A blizzard arrives and Scar collapses, but an older male arrives and helps him to keep moving through the blizzard. They continue on walking and don't realize they are heading into a trap; the ground breaks apart, as they walked onto a frozen sea inlet. As the herd struggles to escape the icy water, several get dragged under by mosasaurs known as Prognathodon. Scar has never swum before, but he is pushed in and starts to swim for the shore. Back in Alaska, Patch picks up a bone and heads back to his nest, which he has been building in the hopes of attracting a mate. Nearby, The Gorgosaurus finds the Edmontonia outside its lair, but the bite to its leg is badly infected and it goes back into the cave to wait for easier prey to wander close.\nSix hundred miles away, the Edmontosaurus herd moves on through a volcanic ash field. Lying in wait, a pack of Albertosaurus sleeps until the herd is close enough to ambush. The feathered carnivores wake up and start to stalk the herd. Scar runs for his life while one of the predators is hot on his heels. During the attack, an avalanche of water, rock and mud caused by the eruption of a volcano that follows the attack slides down the bank. Scar climbs up the cliff, but loses his courage, and the Albertosaurus, injured in the eruption, begins to close in. Just as Scar sees the avalanche, he rushes up the cliff while the Albertosaurus is swept to its seeming death. Back in the Arctic, Patch tries to impress the female by dancing only to lose out to a more experienced male and the Edmontonia has found a last leaf. Suddenly, the log she stands on breaks apart and the Edmontonia slides down the snow on her back and crashes into a snowdrift, utterly helpless. Far away south, Scar tries to call for his family, but the only calls are the ones that didn't make it; the old male Edmontosaurus he has been traveling with and an injured female Pachyrhinosaurus. The Albertosaurus, having survived the mudslide, rises back to its feet and starting following Scar's trail again. Scar and the old Edmontosaurus walks on, but the older animal, suffering from a brain tumor, becomes more aggressive and nervous towards Scar, eventually even biting him. Scar sees the Albertosaurus first, and flees. The old bull Edmontosaurus fights the predator until they both tumble over the cliff, locked in a deadly embrace.\nIn the frozen north, Patch learns how to finally catch Alphadons by listening for them under the snow and comes across the overturned Edmontonia. He and several other Troodons attack the ankylosaur, but the Gorgosaurus, now fully healed of its injury, arrives and pulls the herbivore away from the smaller predators. Struggling, the Edmontonia gets back up and injures the Gorgosaurus with her shoulder spikes. The Gorgosaurus heads back to its cave, fatally wounded with a broken leg. As the sun rises the next morning, Scar is becoming weaker and the Quetzalcoatlus that follows senses it. The young dinosaur hears a rustling noise, which turns to be the injured female Pachyrhinosaurus instead. The pterosaur gives up as the ceratopsian herd arrives to cross the river. Scar informs his new companions that he has been through this exact same kind of experience before. As they begin to cross the river, groups of Prognathodon arrive and pull many of them underwater. Scar dives in while the mosasaurs continue their attack on the Pachyrhinosauruses. Scar eventually reaches the far bank and reunites with the Edmontosaurus herd, finally reaching safety. The sun eventually rises again and warmth begins to spread across the Arctic Circle.

He runs after her, but they end up in separate parts of the Martian spaceship. On Mars, Milo is taken to an underground prison cell. He escapes and is chased by the Supervisor's henchmen, but he follows a voice that tells him to jump down a chute, and lands in a lower subterranean level. There, he sees a trash-covered landscape that is inhabited by furry creatures.\nMilo is whisked away by the creatures to meet Gribble, also known as George Ribble, the childlike adult human who had told him to jump down the chute. Gribble explains to Milo that the Martians plan to extract Milo's mom's memories at sunrise, using a process that will kill her. Gribble, who is lonely and does not want Milo to leave, pretends to help Milo find his mother. His plan goes awry, leading to Gribble being captured and Milo being chased by the Supervisor's henchmen. Milo is rescued by Ki, one of the supervisors who raise Martian babies. Milo tells her about his search for his Mom and what a human relationship with a mom is like, as Ki and her kin were mentored by only nanny-bots and supervisors and do not know of love.\nMilo returns to Gribble's home but finds him missing. Gribble's robotic spider, Two-Cat, takes Milo to the Martian compound where Gribble is being prepared for execution. Milo is captured by his henchmen, but Ki tosses him a laser gun, allowing him to escape. Milo and Gribble retreat to an even lower uninhabited level, where Gribble describes his own mom's abduction and murder by the Martians 20 years ago. Gribble blames himself for her being chosen and regrets that he had not been able to save her. Milo convinces Gribble to actually help him just as Ki finds them. They discover an ancient mural of a Martian family and realize that Martian children were not always raised by machines. Gribble explains that Martian female babies are currently raised by nanny-bots in the technologically advanced society, while the male babies are sent down below to be raised by adult male Martians, which are the furry creatures he encountered earlier.\nMilo, Gribble, and Ki save Milo's mom just before sunrise, causing the energy of the extraction device to short out the electronic locks to the control room. This lets the adult males and babies enter, where they run amok, attacking the guards and robots. Milo and his mom steal oxygen helmets and try to escape across the Martian surface, but the Supervisor, while attempting to kill them, causes Milo to trip and his helmet shatters. His mom gives him her own helmet, saving Milo but causing herself to suffocate in the planet's air. The Martians are awed, as this is the first time they have seen love. Gribble finds his own mother's helmet and gives it to Milo's mom, saving her. Milo apologizes to his mom for his earlier words and the two reconcile. Ki brings a ship for them to escape in, but the Supervisor intervenes. Ki argues that Martians were meant to be raised in families, with love, but the Supervisor insists that the current situation is better because, to her, it is more efficient. The henchmen realizes the Supervisor's cruel nature and arrest her, deciding that they now prefer the loving vision of family life, and the other Martians celebrate.\nMilo, his mom, Gribble, Ki, and Two-Cat travel back to Earth.

By chance, they meet Inez's friend Paul and his wife Carol, and Inez invites them to join Gil and her as they sightsee. \nPaul speaks with great authority but questionable accuracy on every subject they encounter, even contradicting a tour guide at the Mus\u00e9e Rodin, where he insists his knowledge of Rodin's relationships is more accurate than the guide's. Gil finds him pedantic and annoying, yet Inez adores him.\nA night of wine tasting gets Gil drunk, and he decides to walk the streets of Paris to return to the hotel; Inez goes off with Paul and Carol by taxi. Gil stops to get his bearings, and at midnight, a 1920s car pulls up beside him. The passengers urge him to join them and he finds himself at a party for Jean Cocteau attended by notable people of the 1920s Paris art scene: Cole Porter, his wife Linda Lee Porter, and Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald. \nZelda gets bored and encourages Scott and Gil to leave with her.

He finds a cell phone on the body with footage of his girlfriend seen at the party being murdered. Another zombie records him as Keith squats over the body. Owen is still alive and grabs Keith.

The lead zombie complains that the behavior is inconsistent with a Romero zombie.\nDuane makes it to the basement and kills the zombie who was about to put an axe into Judith. The two remaining zombies go to the farmhouse. Karen tries to pitchfork one of them but the tool is wrestled away from her. While attacking the little girl, the mother puts a tool through the head of one zombie. Karen points a gun at the other zombie as Duane and Judith reenter.

With the impending departure of the star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002 with Oakland's limited budget.\nDuring a scouting visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about evaluating players. Beane asks whether Brand would have drafted him out of high school; though scouts considered Beane promising, his career in the major leagues was disappointing. Brand says he would not have drafted him until the ninth round. Impressed, Beane hires him.\nUsing Brand's sabermetric method, Beane signs undervalued players such as Chad Bradford, Jeremy Giambi and Scott Hatteberg, and also trades for David Justice. The Athletics' scouts are hostile toward the strategy, and Beane fires the head scout, Grady Fuson, after a heated confrontation. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager. Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and uses a more traditional lineup.\nEarly in the season, the Athletics are already ten games behind first, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Brand argues their sample size is too small to conclude the method does not work, and Beane convinces the team owner, Stephen Schott, to stay the course. To get help on defense, Beane trades Giambi to the Phillies for John Mabry and the only traditional first baseman, Carlos Pe\u00f1a, to the Tigers, leaving Howe no choice but to use the team Beane and Brand have designed. Three weeks later, the Athletics are only four games behind first.\nBefore the trade deadline, Beane acquires the relief pitcher Ricardo Rinc\u00f3n from the Indians, and on August 13, the Athletics start a winning streak. Beane, superstitiously, refuses to watch games in progress, but when the Athletics tie the American League record of 19 consecutive wins, his daughter persuades him to attend the next game against the Kansas City Royals. Oakland is leading 11\u20130 when Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the Royals even the score. Thanks to a walk-off home run by Hatteberg, the Athletics achieve a then record-breaking 20th consecutive win. Beane tells Brand he will not be satisfied until they have changed baseball by winning the World Series.\nThe Athletics win the American League West but lose to the Minnesota Twins in the American League Division Series, with an unseen baseball analyst explaining that some other tangibles of a player, such as drive and clutch performance, cannot be measured. The owner of the Boston Red Sox, John W. Henry, realizes that sabermetrics is the future of baseball. He gives Beane an offer to become the Red Sox general manager for a $12.5 million salary, which would make him the highest-paid general manager in sports history.

The two receive occasional visits from two child care workers, Grete and Ole, who warn Anna that her ex-husband may soon reopen a custody case over Anders. Anders begins attending a nearby school.\nAnna first forces Anders to sleep with her in her room, but when this is discouraged by the case workers she looks for a babycall (baby monitor) at an electronics store and meets Helge (Kristoffer Joner), a shy gentleman whose mother is dying in a hospital. The two begin to visit regularly at and near Helge's workplace. Helge tells Anna that his mother is unwell and currently at a hospital, and Anna tells Helge about her son. The two developed a friendly albeit fragile relationship - while Anna is an over-protective mother, Helge was an over-protected son unwilling to acknowledge the negative feelings he has about how his mother treated him as a child. Compelled to feel charitable towards over-protective mothers, Helge is only too eager to \u2018understand\u2019 Anna\u2019s refusal to let go of Anders. Similarly, Anna is only too eager to believe that an over-protected son might grow up to understand why his mother would not let him go.\nThe first night Anders slept in his own room, Anna hears disturbing sounds on the babycall, including screaming. Terrified, Anna runs to Anders' room but finds him  asleep. The next day, Anna returns to the electronics store and spoke to Helge, who said that her monitor could pick up other frequencies if they were close enough, meaning that the screams were emanating from someone else within 50 meters. On a map of their apartment complex, drawn by Anders, Anna begins to try to decipher the source of the other frequency.\nAnders approaches Anna with a similar looking boy as she waits to pick him up from school. Anders tells Anna that he has made a new friend and is going to take him home with them. Anna is fairly suspicious of the boy who hardly speaks and does not return Anna's gestures to connect with him. After hearing some ruckus Anna finds Anders in the kitchen, upset because he believes Anna ruined his picture, which now has a dead body covered in blood at the base of the apartments drawn on it. Anna denies adding this to the paper and attributes it to Anders' friend.\nThe next day, while Anders is at school Anna visits the lake near her home. Shortly thereafter Anders asks if Anna will show him the lake, and so she leads him to it, only for the two to arrive at a parking lot despite taking the same route. \nA few days later Anna follows a woman she believes had something to do with the screaming on the baby monitor. While she's there, Anna sees a man drowning a little boy, who is in fact Anders' friend. After the man and his party leave, Anna jumps into the water to try and retrieve the boy. She stays underwater for too long and blacks out.\nAnna wakes up in a hospital, with a nurse telling her she was found looking confused at a parking lot, though her clothes were wet. Anna leaves the hospital and goes to Anders' school to retrieve him but she is told by the principal to leave him because there is a suspcision of child abuse. Anna disregards the principal and brings Anders home.\nWhen the two arrive home Anna discovers that their front door is open. She suspects an intruder has entered the flat and has Anders hide in his room. It is revealed that Ole is there. He tells her that his partner has quit that it is now only up to him if Anna is to keep Anders with the case soon to be reopened. Ole advances on an uncomfortable Anna and tells her he will be back that evening. Anna then goes to the workplace of Helge and invites him for dinner.\nWhile the two eat, there is a knock at the door. Anna asks Helge to answer it for her and she hides. Helge, seeming confused, opens the front door but no one is there. When he turns around he sees Anders' friend, whom he mistakes for Anders, who shows Helge bruises on his body and then runs off to the room of Anders. Helge tries to follow him but is confronted by Anna who yells at him and he leaves. Anna opens the window and calls for Helge to return but he does not. She sees Ole and hurriedly leaves the flat to evade Ole.\nThe next day Ole is back at Anna's and tells her that her ex-husband is coming right now to retrieve Anders. Anna lets Ole in and shortly hears knocking on the door. Panicked that it is her ex-husband, Anna grabs a pair of scissors, which she stabbed Ole with, killing him just outside her door. Helge, who has just arrived, pounds on the door trying to get Anna to open it. Helge runs into the apartment, to see Anna sitting on the windowsill with Anders' arms wrapped around her. Just as he reaches Anna, she leans forward and falls off the windowsill. Helge rushes down the building, sees Anna on the ground, but no Anders. When Helge asks Anna where Anders is, she isn't able to answer.

The monk quietly listens to the man admit to his sexual desires for his niece, Ambrosio only interrupting to remind the confessor that \u201cNo woman is worthless\u201d after he declares that no woman compares to his niece. Ambrosio takes this moment to pontificate on how sins are impossible to judge from his point of view and that they are all sins, nonetheless. The man asks the monk if he does not fear the power of the devil, to which Ambrosio firmly states, \u201cSatan has only the power we give him\u201d with no further reprimanding or preaching to this sinner shown. After the credits, the film flashes back to show Ambrosio\u2019s past in December 1595, on Saint Ambrose\u2019s night. As a baby, he is almost drowned but is then abandoned at the Capuchin monastery by a nameless white-haired man. The voice-over narration explains that Ambrosio was adopted, christened Capuchin Ambrosio, and cared for by the Capuchin monks, despite their initial fear that his hand-shaped birthmark is a sign of the Devil. He grows and learns about the scripture, joining the monastery at 18 and quickly becomes a respected head of the community and renowned sermon preacher.\nAntonia and her Aunt Leonella are introduced attending one of these renowned sermons, where Antonia is struck with Ambrosio's eloquence and preaching. The young Antonia faints and is carried to a separate room by the charming Lorenzo, who introduces himself as being from the wealthy Medina family. Antonia rushes off, wishing to return to her ailing mother and tell her about the day.\nAmbrosio visits Father Miguel to check on his ailing health and inform him of the odd dream he had in which he sees but cannot touch an unknown woman dressed in crimson praying, although he feels like he knows her. Father Miguel suggests it is the Virgin Mary, who the monks are close to but cannot reach, to which Ambrosio does not respond.\nValerio is introduced to the Capuchin monastery by his godfather, Imanol Estevez, who explains that they are from Burgos, where Valerio was in a house fire, explaining the mask as necessary due to terrible burns inflicted on him in a fire that killed his parents. He wishes to join the monastery as a novice, and after some private debate amongst the monks in which Ambrosio alone argues for him being allowed to stay despite his differences, they agree to let the young man stay. While being shown to his room by another novice, Valerio asks if they are allowed to speak with Ambrosio to which the novice notes that they can except when he is in his rose garden where he goes to escape his frequent headaches.\nAmbrosio is next seen acting as the confessor for some nuns. After confessing to minuscule sins, Sister Agnes is leaving when a note drops out of her habit, revealing that she is in love with a man named Cristobal who she names in the letter. Although she begs with him to have mercy, Ambrosio refuses to hide her secret, tells her she must be severely punished to cleanse herself of her sins, and gives her over to the prioress of the nunnery to punish her as she sees fit.\nDon Lorenzo comes to visit Antonia at her home and meets with her mother who forbids him to marry her daughter until he gets his uncle\u2019s approval, revealing that she was married to the wealthy Las Cisternas despite her poor origins which caused her husband to be disinherited and become regretful and spiteful after being forced to move to Caracaras. Wishing to save her daughter from the same fate, she insists that he get his final living relative\u2019s approval before she will allow him to pursue Antonia.\nThe ailing Father Miguel reveals to Ambrosio that he is convinced something evil is prowling in the monastery and asks if there have been any recent possessions nearby, to which Ambrosio says a shepherd in a nearby hamlet was. Father Miguel warns Ambrosio to be wary and alert. That same night after leaving Father Miguel\u2019s chamber, Ambrosio gets a debilitating headache and goes to his rose garden, where Valerio follows him and offers to heal Ambrosio with what he claims is a gift of healing passed down from his mother. Even though Ambrosio snaps at him to leave, Valerio places his hands on Ambrosio\u2019s head, offering relief and then leaves.\nWhile being interrogated by the prioress, it is revealed that Agnes is pregnant. To punish her for breaking her vows in the convent garden, she is sentenced to die of hunger and thirst in the abbey dungeon. Agnes curses Ambrosio for not showing her mercy.\nAmbrosio confronts Valerio and thanks him for healing him. Valerio then asks if it is alright to lie, to which Ambrosio says one can hide the truth if it is for a higher purpose. Ambrosio is shown sitting in front of a painting of the Madonna while reflecting on his assistance with the exorcism of the shepherd mentioned to Father Miguel earlier. During these reflections, he hears a noise and finds Father Miguel who says \u201cHe\u2019s here. I\u2019ve seen him\u201d with his dying breaths. A funeral is held for Father Miguel and Agnes is shown begging for mercy for her child then cursing Ambrosio again.\nAmbrosio is woken by his dream of the woman in red, and he goes to the rose garden where he again runs into Valerio who is crying. Ambrosio asks him to confide, and after much prompting and promising not to kick him out of the monastery, Valerio admits to entering the monastery to be closer to Ambrosio and takes of his mask to reveal that he is a woman. At this revelation and despite her protestations, Ambrosio tells Valerio she must leave in the morning. She asks for a rose as a parting gift, and while picking one, Ambrosio is bit by a poisonous centipede. It is declared that there is no hope for healing Ambrosio, and while the other monks are praying and Father Andres, who is keeping watch, is sleeping, Valerio sucks the poison from Valerio\u2019s hand and sexually assaults him, which to him appears as a fever dream. The next morning, Ambrosio is doing better and the other monks believe it is a miracle.\nLorenzo takes Antonia on an outing, under Leonella\u2019s supervision. While they are being rowed on a river, he admits his feelings for her, and she prompts him to go see his uncle in Saragossa and be patient with her. He is shown riding away.\nAgnes\u2019 body is shown being taken from the prison and the prioress orders her to be made decent looking for her funeral.\nWhile greeting the other monks after recovering, Ambrosio notices that Valerio is not present, to which Father Andres says he is ill and will not permit anyone to see him. Ambrosio visits Valerio at night, and she reveals that only she can get herself the cure and will only do it if  he allows her to stay. He agrees and accompanies her to the graveyard, where she descends into a hole leading into a grave. While waiting for her to return, Ambrosio sees Agnes\u2019s ghost who accuses him of having sinned in the flesh and being responsible for her and her son\u2019s death. Matilda returns healed and Ambrosio asks her what happened after she drew the poison out of him last night to which she says nothing and kisses him. While leaving Valerio\u2019s room, Ambrosio is confronted by a monk who claims he knows that they are sinning together and will tell everyone tomorrow. While heading back to his room, the accusatory monk avoids certain dark areas of the monastery and is hit by a falling gargoyle in the rose garden. During that same night, Antonia\u2019s mother is distraught and expresses regret for how her and Antonia\u2019s life has turned out.\nThe next morning, the dead monk is found, and while investigating the fallen gargoyle on the roof, Ambrosio sees the woman in crimson from his dream. It is revealed to be Antonia, who has come to request that Ambrosio visit her mother to bring her comfort. He agrees and goes to her, where Elvire confesses that she had a son before Antonia named Mateo, but that she left him behind when she fled from Madrid and the Marquis killed him out of spite. He eases her conscience by telling her it is okay because she was young, and if she had died she would not have had Antonia.\nAmbrosio gives another sermon to the masses, with Antonia in attendance, where he makes a show of putting on a crown of thorns. While Father Andres is cleaning his head injuries after, Ambrosio asks if his sermon was as persuasive as usual, and his friend insists that it was more so. He is then shown visiting Antonia in a garden, where he recites a Psalm at her request and attempts to kiss her. She demands he leave and never return. Lorenzo returns just after, and Antonia embraces him happily.\nAmbrosio goes to Valerio and tries to sexually engage with her, but she refuses saying she does not want to because he no longer desires her. She reveals that she knows he lusts for Antonia, and that she can help him. She admits that she has control of demons, which is how she cured herself in the cemetery that night. She also reveals that Antonia is going to get married to Lorenzo and will be out of reach soon. She goes to the cemetery and returns with a sprig of myrtle that will open any locked door and will enchant Antonia if she smells it. During the procession of Saint Mary, Ambrosio sneaks into Antonia\u2019s room, where after smelling the flower she wakes up and they engage in sexual intercourse. Elvire dreams of her first born who has the same hand birthmark on his shoulder, revealing that Ambrosio is Mateo and thus her son. She wakes up and goes into Antonia\u2019s room where she sees the naked Ambrosio and his birthmark. He stabs her with scissors. As Elvire dies, she utters the word \"Mateo\", indicating that Ambrosio now knows that he is Antonia\u2019s older brother. Antonia wakes up and screams, alerting Lorenzo who sings below her window.\nAmbrosio is delivered to the Inquisition where he is condemned to death by starvation. While awaiting his sentence in prison, Valerio appears to him adorned in a gown and jewels, revealing herself as an instrument of Satan in female form and she states that someone wants to meet Ambrosio. The monk is then shown wandering a desolate, rocky desert barefoot and in rags. While lying down in the sun, the confessor from the first scene of the film approaches him and congratulates him on his intense sins and reveals his identity as the Devil.

The Brawl itself is divided into two classes: The Creature class and the Undead class. For the Creatures: Cyclops, Werewolf, Witch Bitch and Swamp Gut. For the Undead: Lady Vampire, Zombie Man, The Mummy and Frankenstein. Each round is preceded by the origin of the combatants. For the first round, Cyclops, revealed to have received a message of the tournament goes to prove himself to the world and eventually to crush Hades who had cursed him with his foreseeing eye, while Witch Bitch is recruited by a diminutive troll named Grub who is a renowned monster combat trainer to overcome her small village's hatred of her through fear and dominance. As their combat starts off, Cyclops clearly has the advantage, but Witch Bitch is tenacious and fights viciously. As the combat ensues, she attempts to slam and pin the Cyclops down, her efforts leading to an illegal move called by the referee. Cyclops counters her attacks by bringing out a small mallet to brutally bludgeon her. Her retaliation is by whipping out a carving knife and attacking, inadvertently slashing the ref's throat in the process. She tries to blind Cyclops, but he turns his legendary optic beam on her, melting her face clean off and killing her. Outraged by the loss, Grub attempts to attack the Cyclops, only to be decapitated in a single punch.

But when he goes to get a wooden stake and bring it back, she revives and continues to wail on him. He has a brief advantage with his magical amulet that harnesses the power of the sun, burning half of Lady Vampire's face.

However, the werewolf attacks and bites him, cursing him even though he manages to finish the wolf off. He is smarmy and sarcastic and viciously self-confident with the advantage of the full moon showing that night. Swamp Gut's story is portrayed as a documentary where, like a crocodile he hunts unassuming victims in his swamps, paralyzing them with his toxic spit and devouring them. As the match starts, Werewolf proves little effectiveness in his body slams due to Swamp Gut's girth, but his agility keeps him one step ahead as he attacks the gut's weak spot, his stomach. Sid makes reference to King Hippo of Punch Out in comparison to the battle. Werewolf's blows weaken his opponent who collapses to the ring. He does a dive from the corner onto Swamp Gut, causing his stomach to explode, killing him. Werewolf is the king of the creature heavyweight championship and moves on to the final match.

The pair match blow for blow, but much to his father's disdain, Frankenstein does not realize he needs to destroy Zombie Man's head. As the doctor climbs into the ring and attacks Zombie Man with a wrench, Crookshank does the same and kills the doctor with a hatchet to the back. This enrages Frankenstein who brutally attacks Zombie Man, eventually crushing his skull with his foot. In his death throes, Zombie Man summons up a horde of six zombies, one of which bites Sid in the booth before they combine their efforts and attack Crookshank before the caretaker kills them all. The final match is between Werewolf and Frankenstein, Sid slowly loses his composure and becomes a zombie during the round, forcing Buzz to kill him. Meanwhile, Werewolf is at a severe disadvantage with the towering undead. His blows don't phase Frankenstein, who, despite having his leg practically torn off in a figure four hold from the Werewolf manages to beat him into submission by crushing his skull with his hands. Frankenstein starts to walk away the victor but Werewolf recovers, attacking him more viciously, taking several tombstones and crushing them over Frankenstein's head. He takes the belt for himself, but Frankenstein wakes and attacks the unaware werewolf, grabbing his jowls before ripping his head apart.

They both share their tragic stories of their life while travelling. Nanda tells him about his unloving wife Indhu (Nikita Thukral), and his post marital love Lavanya (Haripriya). He states he lives in a situation that he uncomfortably living adjusted life with his wife.\nThen, Arjun tells Nanda about his materialistic father, Devarajan (Jayaprakash), a famous industrialist and business magnate, asking him to continue his business and follow his ideas even though he doesn't like it. Moreover, tragedy occurs when Devarajan raped Arjun's lady love Linda (Suma Bhattacharya), who worked in Devarajan's office. Linda commits suicide as her chastity was destroyed by her \"future\" father-in-law.\nArjun lives his life in the shadow of his father to keep the promise to his love that he made before she died.\nAfter some time of travelling, both of them meet the youngsters who were responsible for Nanda's car seize in a motel. Arjun initiates a fight with them, and Nanda joins to help Arjun. Finally, while escaping in their car, both of them chase and make the same thing happen to Nanda's car. Afterwards, while approaching the destination of their journey, Arjun explains to Nanda his idea of solving both of their problems in a criss-cross manner. The plan calls for Arjun to kill Nanda's wife and for Nanda to kill Arjun's father. Arjun explains that no one can solve the murder, as Arjun and Nanda are strangers and no motive can be determined by the police and outsiders. Arjun explains as both of them are strangers, if he kills Nanda's wife in a situation that appears to be an accident while Nanda is officially engaged in another place, nothing can be traced. Nanda immediately turns down the deal and leaves.\nIn a week's daily routine, Nanda increasingly identifies with Arjun's idea that the only problem in his life is his wife. After a week's time, his wife is involved in an accident on the highway and dies on the spot. The next day, Arjun comes to Nanda's home and describes how he created the accident and how he found out Indhu had been unfaithful to Nanda by having an affair with her colleague named Gowtham. Arjun asks Nanda to complete his part of the plan by murdering his dad and explains he had another plan for him. Both of them meet frequently at locations where no one can see them together, and both of them are officially unconnected strangers to the world. Nanda explains he can't murder anyone. Arjun forces him to go through with it by saying that his dad was an evil human and the only way for him to have a happy life is for his father to die. Meanwhile, a policeman and a relative of Indhu suspects that Nanda arranged for Indhu's accident by hiring a hitman, as Nanda started living happily together with his love. The policeman's suspicions cause him to become Arjun's next target.\nArjun kills him, and the news reports that the policeman was killed due to an electrical leak in his home.\nNanda understands that Arjun is already highly engaged in the deal and won't stop until he accepts it. So he agrees to murder Arjun's dad while convincing himself that he is doing it for the greater good. Arjun provides the plan to Nanda and leaves of the city to establish an alibi while the murder occurs. Nanda follows Devarajan to execute the plan, finding that Devarajan is a good and kind human, and withdraws his murder plan. The following day, Arjun calls him to ask why he failed, and ask to meet with him. In the shopping mall where he had planned to meet with Arjun, Nanda runs into his lover's friend. She casually explains the evil nature of Arjun when she sees Arjun. She explains how Arjun caused Linda's suicide by breaking up with her. Nanda understood Arjun had painted a self heroic story and how he betrayed him. Nanda explains to Arjun that he won't do anything for him as he knows the truth and asks to get far away from him forever. Arjun seems to finally accept Nanda's refusal \u2013 but warns him that accidents can happen at any time.\nOver the next few days, Nanda feels increasingly alarmed by accidents threatening Lavanya's safety, realizing Arjun is behind them all. Lavanya is confused about what was happening to Nanda and believes that he was going mad. Arjun hears Lavanya telling her friend about Nanda and informs Nanda that he is still active and he can kill Lavanya too. Nanda finally makes his decision and tells Arjun that he is ready to murder Devarajan. Arjun lays his plan and goes to Bangalore. Meanwhile, Nanda breaks into the hotel in Bangalore where Arjun is staying and tells him that he is going to kill him instead of his dad. Arjun fights back, and falls from the roof near the swimming pool, into which he dives at the start of the film. Hotel authorities report the case as the drunken jump from a roof.

To Dianne's surprise, Henry, who had previously shown little signs of improvement, becomes eloquent and animated when hearing his favorite music from when he was a teenager. Using the music to prompt him to discuss his memories, it is revealed that Gabriel was named after his uncle, who died in World War II while serving with Henry. Though they were close when Gabriel was a child, they frequently get into arguments when he becomes a teenager over Gabriel's girlfriend and his reluctance to attend college. After one such argument, Henry offers to attend a concert at the high school, where Gabriel is performing with his band. Though Gabriel intends to play one of his father's favorite songs in tribute, the concert is interrupted by another student burning a flag, which Gabriel enthusiastically participates in. Henry is outraged and storms out; back at the family home, Henry rages against Gabriel for disrespecting the flag that his namesake uncle fought and died for, to which Gabriel argues that he is tired of watching his friends getting drafted and dying in Vietnam.

Under the name of Anton, Jong-dae has become a work-unit leader, helps his Korean friends, and abuses the Japanese, but it becomes clear that his ultimate allegiance now lies with the Soviets.

Later, a work accident incites a riot, which nearly leads to the execution of Tatsuo and Jun-shik by firing squad, but news comes that Germany has declared war on the Soviet Union. The Soviets immediately conscript the prisoners-of-war and shoot those who refuse or are too slow to don the Red Army uniform. Jong-dae volunteers Jun-shik and Tatsuo, still tied to the stakes, into the Red Army, which saves their lives. They all fight in a bloody battle against the German army at Dedovsk in December 1941. Jong-dae dies leading the prisoners to battle, but Tatsuo and Jun-shik manage to survive. Jun-shik convinces Tatsuo to don German military apparel taken from bodies and trek over the mountains into German territory. As they travel, it becomes clear that Tatsuo has been injured. They come upon an abandoned town in which Jun-shik goes out to find medicine to give to Tatsuo. During his search, Jun-shik is found by German soldiers. Unable to understand him, they capture him. Meanwhile, the dying Tatsuo is found by soldiers searching the house he was placed in.\nThree years later, Tatsuo is part of the German Army. He finds himself on the beaches of Normandy, France, just prior to the D-Day invasion by the Allies. As the army fortifies the beaches, Tatsuo sees a man running on the beach. He catches up to him and sees that it is Jun-shik. It is apparent that they have not seen each other since their capture by the Germans. They decide to run away from Normandy to catch a ship in Cherbourg which rumored to safely sail out of the theater, and ultimately to return home to Korea. As they attempt to leave, the Normandy Landings begin. Jun-shik and Tatsuo are locked into a machine-gun pillbox by a German officer. The two force open the door and emerge to a scene of chaos, with American soldiers overrunning the beach. They run inland, but Jun-shik is wounded by a bomb fragment in the chest and bleeds profusely. Noticing American paratroopers approaching, the dying Jun-shik forcibly replaces Tatsuo's identification tags with his own and tells Tatsuo, \"He is now Jun-shik.\" Otherwise, since Tatsuo is Japanese and considered a sworn enemy of the Americans, he could be killed on the spot.\nSoon afterwards, Jun-Shik dies and Tatsuo cries aloud as the Americans close in. Tatsuo is later seen sprinting towards the finish in the 1948 Olympic games as \"Jun-Shik Kim.\" The film ends with a flashback of their first encounter back in Gyeong-seong.

Mastiffs are in demand by Chinese businessmen, and they are becoming rare. When his father finds out, he immediately goes to the dog dealer to return the money and retrieve his dog. At first, the dealer refuses but eventually agrees when police officer Dorje (who happens to be the old man's son-in-law) explains the nature of the family conflict. The old man states that the dog has been a good animal in herding the family's sheep. Since the dog has been in his care for 13 years, he wants to ensure a good life for the animal.\nAfter recovering his mastiff, the old sheep herder joins Dorje for a tea and meat snack at a local eatery.

He then asks Dorje for advice about Gonpo, his hooligan son who tried to sell the dog. Gonpo and his wife Rikso have been together for 3 years without having children. Concerned, the old man asks where in the city can Gonpo and Rikso get help for this, and Dorje suggests they go to the city hospital.\nWith some hesitation in obeying his father, Dorje agrees to go to the hospital with Rikso but upon arriving, he changes his mind in accompanying Rikso and asks her to get her sister instead. After the appointment, Gonpo is informed that there is no problem in Rikso that prevents her from having children. There is a meaningful pause as Gonpo quietly absorbs this news.\nIn the middle of the night, a scuffle is heard around the house, and noises indicate an attempted theft of the mastiff. Thinking of what is best for the animal, the old man decides to release him to the mountains in the hope that he can live the rest of his life in freedom. Unfortunately, the old dog is captured by the same dealer from before, and news of this reaches the old man to his chagrin. The surprise comes when the old man learns that Gonpo is in jail for going to the dealer and punching him out in order to retrieve the dog. Dorje eventually returns the dog to his owner.\nAt the jail, the old man visits with Gonpo and shares a cigarette with him.

Ho later visits Lo in hospital and attempts to ask him questions but Lo denies knowledge of being followed and evades the other questions at the advice of Emily, his wife and lawyer. Lo's past is revealed by Ho \u2013 Lo's firm owed the bank money but because of the stock market crash, Lo instead made a lot of money and then became the broker to the five.\nIn his office, Lo reveals to Emily that he was being followed. She then tells him about Inspector Ho's history \u2013 not much is known about his previous cases in the police force but his wife (Tsui Foon) was a lawyer that went to jail for using clients' money to pay off debts after losing money in the stock market, with him being the one that aided in her arrest.\nHo then enters the room and scans the opposing buildings.

Lo then tells Ho that a typical account opening at his firm would cost $500 000 but he is only charging Ho $100, the cost of the gift that Ho paid for.\nHo then says that the Landlord Club is powerful and since Joe is stepping on their tail, they can easily kill him. Ho reveals that he knows that the Landlord Club deals in illegal funds from conflicts. However, Lo does not seem to know that the Landlord Club has arranged for Joe to be killed and Ho asks to talk to the Landlord Club. Then, Joe calls Lo and Lo asks Ho to leave.

Tony instructs the rest of get the shares and after they leave, asks Lo if he can still trust him because Lo was brought in by Chauncey Sze-ma, and now Joe, Sze-ma's son, wants to go after them. Lo says he can be trusted because he does not want to go to jail. Later, Lo arrives home to find Ho and his team at the gate. When he gets to his apartment, he is held at gunpoint by Joe, who asks about the cashing of the cheque Lo once passed to Chauncey Sze-ma. Joe demands that Lo keeps his word to his Dad about being able to cash the cheque when he needed money.\nIn the night, Ho arrives at the nursing home and speaks to its director. The director explains to Ho that a tag found in Ho's car after Joe took it is supposed to contain a GPS tracker so that Alzheimer's patients can be tracked The number attached to the empty tag, G-41, is Mrs Szema's bed number.\nThe next day, Joe asks Ho to open a bag by Mrs Sze-ma's bedside and Ho discovers photos of his wife inside.

Whilst running, Yukari trips and falls into the arms of Isabelle (Shunji Igarashi), a friend of Aarashi who's dressed as a woman, that carries her back to their studio \"Paradise Kiss\" after she faints.

At the same time, this is their last project as a group because their designer clothes that were placed in stores, were all returned due to no sales and the group made a decision beforehand that if the clothes were not sold, they would go their separate ways meaning that George will fulfill his dream of going to Paris once they graduate. Yukari also calls home and tells her younger brother to give their mother Yasuko message about the fashion show.\nDuring the runway practice, Yukari struggles to walk due to her nerves which results in her regretting that she did not take the show seriously and George reprimanding her for being her usual, uncaring, not-so-serious self. Isabelle cheers up Yukari and tells her his life story that when he was a child, he never felt right as a boy and George made him his first dress which made him never wear men's clothing again. Isabelle goes on to explain that clothes are \"magical\" and give people courage which is why they've continued to make them for so long and maybe Yukari will find courage in the dress they've made for her.

Jack later learns from Angelica that the ritual requires a mermaid's tear and two silver chalices located on Ponce de Le\u00f3n's ship, the Santiago, in order to activate the Fountain's healing properties. Both chalices get water from the Fountain, and the person who drinks the water with the tear gets all the years of life from the other. Angelica also shows Jack Blackbeard's collection of captured, miniaturized ships in bottles, including the Black Pearl.\nThe Revenge sails to Whitecap Bay, where Blackbeard's crew successfully captures the mermaid Syrena. Barbossa, Gibbs, and some of the British crew are forced to continue on foot after their ship is attacked by mermaids. Syrena was carried, at first, by Blackbeard's crew in a glass tank until both dropped, and the mermaid's tail turned into legs. Seeing that she cannot walk, Philip offers to carry Syrena. Blackbeard sends Jack to get the chalices, taking his magic compass as a bargaining chip. Jack and Barbossa meet on the Santiago, but find the chalices have been taken by the Spanish. Retrieving the chalices, Barbossa details Blackbeard's attack on the Pearl, which led to the loss of his leg via self-amputation and his desire for revenge. After Blackbeard and Angelica use Philip and Syrena's love to extract the mermaid's tear. Syrena is left to die, with Philip forced to go with the crew. Jack returns to Blackbeard, giving him the chalices in exchange for Jack's compass, which Jack sends Gibbs off with.\nAll parties locate the Fountain of Youth, which led to a battle, in which Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword. Angelica cuts her hand on the poisoned blade. The Spanish arrive, throwing the chalices into a deep pool and destroying the Fountain, believing it as an abomination against God. In the chaos, Philip frees Syrena, who gives the chalices to Jack. Filling the chalices with the remaining drops of water from the Fountain, adding Syrena's tear, Jack tricks Blackbeard into drinking the chalice lacking the tear. Angelica is healed, whilst Blackbeard dies. Syrena returns to an injured Philip and, after she forgives him, they kiss. Still entwined, the missionary not resisting the mermaid in any way, Syrena guides Philip underwater.\nBarbossa claims Blackbeard's ship, crew, and sword for his own, and declares himself captain of the Queen Anne's Revenge, and returns to a life of piracy. Jack maroons Angelica on a cay, unsure if he can trust her. Afterward, he reunites with Gibbs, who used Jack's compass to locate the Revenge, retrieving the bottled Black Pearl.

Despite the vampires' vulnerability to sunlight, and all of mankind's technological advances, the vampires' greater strength and speed made them impossible to defeat until humanity sheltered them in giant walled cities and trained a group of elite warriors, the Priests, which turned the tide.\nIn the opening scene, a group of Priests enters the Sola Mira Hive but are ambushed by the vampires.  As they attempt to retreat, one of their numbers is seized from behind, and their leader tries to pull him to safety, but is forced to let go and watch him dragged, screaming, back into the hive.\nYears later, the majority of the vampires have been killed, while the remainder were placed in reservations. With the war over, the Clergy disbanded the Priests. Outside the walled cities, some humans seek out a living, free from the totalitarian control of The Church.\nPriest (Paul Bettany) is approached by Hicks (Cam Gigandet), the sheriff of a free town, Augustine. Priest learns that his brother, Owen, and Owen's wife, Shannon\u2014Priest's girlfriend before he was recruited by the clergy\u2014were mortally wounded in a vampire attack, and Priest's niece, Lucy (Lily Collins), was kidnapped. Hicks asks for Priest's help in rescuing Lucy. Priest asks the Church to reinstate his authority, but leader Monsignor Orelas (Christopher Plummer) does not believe the vampire story and refuses, insisting on maintaining the common belief that the vampires have been completely defeated, for fear of compromising the Church's authority. Priest defiantly leaves the city and Orelas sends three Priests and a Priestess (Maggie Q) to bring him back.\nPriest and Hicks arrive at Nightshade Reservation where humans called Familiars, people infected with a pathogen that makes them subservient to the vampires, live alongside a number of the surviving vampires. After a fierce battle, the pair discovers that most of the vampires have taken shelter in Sola Mira, which was thought to have been abandoned after the war. Priestess, one of Priest's team during the failed attack on the Hive, joins them at Sola Mira. The trio destroys a Hive Guardian vampire, then discover that the vampires have bred a new army and dug a tunnel out of the mountain towards a town called Jericho. The other three Priests have arrived at Jericho just as night falls and an armored train arrives, unleashing hundreds of vampires upon the population. The vampires are led by a powerful and mysterious human wearing a black hat (Karl Urban). When the three Priests reject Black Hat's offer to join him, he kills them all.\nThe next morning, Priest, Priestess and Hicks arrive in Jericho and discover the town empty and the three dead Priests crucified. Priest and Priestess share an intimate moment when she confesses her feelings for him, hoping that now that Shannon has died, he would no longer feel bound to her. Priest gently refuses. Priest realizes that the vampires have been using the trains to travel by day and attack the free towns by night, with the walled cities at the end of the train line. Hicks believes the cities are likewise protected by the sun, but Priest explains that the cities' massive clouds of smoke and ash have permanently deprived them of sunlight.  If the train reaches one of the cities, the attack will be a slaughter.\nHicks, who is in love with Lucy, threatens Priest, believing that Priest intends to kill her if she has been infected by the vampires.  Priestess explains that he cannot do so, because Lucy is actually Priest's daughter, and that Owen stepped in as a husband and a father when Priest was taken by the Church.  Lucy was never told the truth about her parentage.\nWhile Priestess rushes ahead to plant a bomb on the railroad tracks, Priest and Hicks board the train to rescue Lucy. Battling vampires and Familiars, the two are finally overpowered by Black Hat just as they find Lucy. Black Hat is revealed as the priest who was lost in the attack on Sola Mira.  After being captured, the vampire Queen gave him her blood, turning him into the first Vampire-Human hybrid who can survive the sun. As Priest fights Black Hat, Lucy discovers the truth about her parentage. On the tracks ahead of the train, Priestess battles several Familiars, but one of them destroys the detonator for the explosives.  Instead, she mounts the explosives on her motor bike and drives it into the train engine. The explosion and subsequent derailment kills the vampires and engulfs Black Hat in flames, while Hicks, Priest, Priestess, and Lucy are able to escape.\nPriest returns to the city and confronts Monsignor Orelas during Mass, telling him of the burnt train containing the vampires' bodies, but not the Queen's. He proves this by throwing a vampire head onto the floor and shocking everyone in the room.

When he wakes, he finds his mother's body on the floor, as she had been beaten to death by his father, who then hanged himself, all under the mental control of Jimbo. He is then sent away to a mental hospital, where Jimbo is visited by multi-billionaire Charles Killian, who decides to take him under his wing to help him control his abilities. Twenty years later, Jimbo has become a brilliant researcher in the Killian Foundation for Gifted Children, married to Ann with whom they are due to have a child. Jimbo has only one goal: to find young children who, like him, possess supernatural powers. Thus, he created an extremely complex online game \"The Game\" in the hopes that he'll be able to identify any such people around the United States. One night, five unrelated teenagers pass the game and hack Jimbo's computer. In desperation, Jimbo shuts his computer down and restarts it, only to find a message on his screen with the words: \"Where Are You?\" Jimbo immediately sets out to find them and bring them to the Foundation, but on his return he learns of the death of Killian. The Foundation therefore passes onto Melanie, Killian's lesbian daughter, who plans with Jenkins - her second-in-command - to end Jimbo's game and instead work on a TV show. In order to save the game - and the possibility of locating more \"Prodigies\" - Jimbo has the idea of combining the ideas: create a large-scale televised competition to reveal future geniuses. The show, American Genius, is launched, and five teenagers are announced as participants - hand-picked by Jimbo, having met and identified them as \"Prodigies\": Gil, an abused child who was like Jimbo when he was a child but darker; Liza, a young girl trained to be a top model; Lee, a young Asian immigrant who helps her parents in their trade; Harry, an African-American whose mother wastes all her money in gambling; and Sammy, the only son of a wealthy family and physical ungrateful. The five are identified immediately and Jimbo arranges to meet with them in secret in Central Park. No sooner are the teenagers gathered than two thugs assault and rape Liza. Jimbo, however, is not there: he has just learned that Ann is pregnant. He learns of the teenagers' situation too late and, by the time he arrives at the park, Liza is missing and the other four are on the floor, unconscious. However, through Liza's agony while she is being raped, her pain is telepathically extended to the other four teenagers and Jimbo, who unconsciously drive out the thugs using mind-controlling abilities of their own. As soon as Jimbo recovers his senses, he hurries to Liza and finds her in a coma. The next day he learns that Melanie wants to cover up the crime, in order to preserve the TV show, by claiming Liza was injured by a hit-and-run driver. Furious, Jimbo violently demands an explanation, and his anger almost makes him lose control of his abilities and as a result he is fired from the Killian Foundation. After that, he vows to protect the other four, and locks himself away in his office with his computer, afraid because of how he had almost lost control like in the day of the death of his parents. Meanwhile, under the leadership of Gil, the five teenagers infiltrate the archives of the Killian group, where they find video recordings of Jimbo during his sessions in the mental hospital. Here he talks about his feelings of isolation caused by his supernatural abilities, as well as the possibility of others like him (even Charles Killian) being out there. The mention of him bringing them all together to avenge themselves for all the years of mistreatment entices Gil, Sammy, Lee and Harry to bring justice upon Liza's attackers, which they do by brutally killing them as well as the officer, who helped cover up the crime, and his wife using their powers. When Jimbo learns of this, he is very alarmed. Furthermore, Melanie refuses to recognize the truth if only to let the TV show continue, Meanwhile the teenagers are demanding justice. However, one evening, as he tries to reason with the teenagers (who are now murderers), they turn against him. Doubting his trust, they put him to the test by ordering him to kill Jenkins. but Jimbo says \"No!\", So the teenagers go on to make Jenkins beat up Jimbo (once again with their abilities) and kill Jenkins, then frame Jimbo for his murder.

In a desperate attempt to prevent the imminent destruction the other teenagers plan on causing, Ann reluctantly seeks help from Melanie, the organiser of the final of American Genius, which will take place in the White House, include the four teenagers plus another fifth contestant named Justin, and be attended by the President of the United States. When Jimbo learns of Liza harming Ann, he uses his powers to break free from prison and joins Liza to reach the other teenagers, as well as Melanie and Ann, at the White House. On site, when she and Jimbo are attempting to sneak into the White House, they are halted by guards and Liza uses her powers for the two of them to escape. This triggering an alarm and initiates a security procedure where everybody in the Oval Office (including the finalists of American Genius) must get to safety in a security bunker. But once inside and all exits are sealed, the four gifted teenagers manipulate the soldiers and bodyguards into killing each other, and Melanie is shot dead under Gil's will. Gil then begins the attacks by launching a nuke at Killian University, where Jimbo and Killian worked. Ann's life is spared when Sammy raises the possibility that her child, being Jimbo's as well, might also be a \"golden child\". Jimbo eventually arrives at the bunker with Liza, where he learns that Gil is the one leading the group into attacking the US.

Vicky later dies from her illness. Mike digs deeper into the case, and discovers no one is willing to buy the needle because of a healthcare/pharmaceutical conspiracy and bribery racket. With the threat of exposure, heavyweight attorneys move in on the defense led by attorney Nathaniel Price. Out of their league and out of money, the mounting pressure of the case pushes the two underdog lawyers and their business to the breaking point.In the meantime, Mike is struggling with his heavy drug usage and his loneliness. He seeks sex therapy as a source of comfort and is consistently in the company of prostitutes. His personal struggles hinder the realization of his professional ambitions, as he misses many of the meetings and investment events, driving a wedge between him and Paul.\nMike, Paul, and Dancort gain the support of Senator O'Reilly, not before she gives Mike an ultimatum: get clean. Mike's heavy withdrawal leaves him hospitalized, only adding to the financial burdens of the firm. The momentum of the case seems to come to a standstill: Senator O'Reilly pulls out after United Medical Health Supplies lobbies for her re-election campaign and Paul, with a new baby at home, is not interested in pursuing the case over his family.\nThey meet with Nathaniel Price, and he offers a settlement, the tipping point for the conflict between Mike and Paul. Their conflict comes to a head as Mike argues to take the case to trial and seek justice, while Paul protests there is no feasible way they can continue all the way financially. Mike meets a former employee of Thompson Needle Manufacturers and a friend of Vicky's, who implores him to continue the case on behalf of the lives affected by used needles, which spread AIDS and hepatitis worldwide. Mike meets with Nathaniel Price and pledges he will personally find new clients and hospital employees affected by these unsafe needles across the country. However, the next day, Paul finds Mike dead from an overdose.\nAt the settlement conference, Paul walks in with famous personal injury attorney Mark Lanier, declining the settlement and proclaiming that they will see them in court. The movie's postscript tells the audience that in 2004, Attorney Lanier settled a lawsuit against one of the nation's largest medical supply manufacturer for over $150 million. \"As a result, thousands of hospitals throughout the United States now use safety needles.\"", "tmdb_plot": "A David and Goliath law drama about a drug-addicted lawyer who takes on a health supply corporation while battling his own personal demons.", "tmdb_id": "72432", "wiki_id": "28256193"}, {"title": "Punished", "genres": ["Action", "Thriller", "Crime"], "wiki_plot": "The story starts with a real estate tycoon, Wong Ho-chiu (Anthony Wong), who is celebrating his wife (Maggie Cheung Ho-yee) and adult daughter Daisy's (Janice Man) birthday.

Seeing that the corridor leading to the bathroom is dark, Vishal tells Uday that a woman previously lived in the house. She was called a witch by her family who killed her, following which her spirit murdered her entire family and since then has been haunting the house.

Meanwhile, Uday tries to open her handcuffs with other items but suddenly he becomes paranoid. Suddenly, Uday picks up a pointed object and stabs himself in the neck and dies.

Former boxer Charlie Kenton owns the robot Ambush, until it is destroyed in a fight against a bull belonging to promoter and carnival owner, Ricky. Having bet money he didn't have with Ricky that Ambush would win, Charlie absconds before Ricky can collect.\nAfter the fight, Charlie learns that his ex-girlfriend died and he must attend a hearing deciding the future of their son, Max, a robot-boxing fan with nearly no contact with Charlie since his birth. Max's maternal aunt Debra and her wealthy husband Marvin want full custody. Charlie bargains to cede custody of Max for $100,000, half in advance, and Marvin negotiates that Charlie retain custody of Max for three months while Marvin and Debra go on vacation. Settling into a gym owned by Bailey Tallet, the daughter of Charlie's former boxing coach, Charlie uses the half in advance money to acquire the once-famous World Robot Boxing robot Noisy Boy. He and Max take Noisy Boy to Crash Palace, an underworld boxing arena run by his friend Finn, where Noisy Boy is destroyed against another robot boxer, Midas. While scavenging for replacements in a junkyard, Max discovers Atom, an obsolete, dilapidated but mostly intact sparring robot designed to withstand severe damage, with a rare \"shadow function\" to mirror and memorize handler or opponent movements.\nAt Max's behest, Charlie pits Atom against another robot Metro and is surprisingly victorious. Max integrates Noisy Boy's voice command hardware with Atom and convinces Charlie to assist in streamlining Atom's movements. This results in a series of victories, culminating in Charlie being offered a World Robot Boxing fight with Atom against national champion robot Twin Cities. The fight starts with Atom on the attack, but Twin Cities easily takes the offensive. Charlie notices a hitch whenever Twin Cities throws a right punch, and he exploits this to win by knockout. Elated by their success, Max challenges undefeated global champion robot Zeus, with the audience squarely on their side. After the fight, Ricky and two henchmen attack Charlie for bailing earlier and rob him and Max of their winnings, prompting a defeated and dejected Charlie to return Max to Debra.\nThis upsets Max, and when Charlie tries to convince Max that it's better to live without him, Max reveals that all he wanted was for Charlie to fight for him and be there as a father. After Max leaves, Charlie returns to Tallet's Gym and talks with Bailey about the events, where the two kiss, revealing their attraction to each other. Persuaded by Bailey, Charlie reconciles with Max and convinces Debra to allow Max to witness the fight with Zeus that Charlie has arranged.\nLater on, when the fight begins, Zeus knocks Atom down with its first punch and dominates the first round, but Atom manages to survive the first round, stunning the audience. Ricky, who bet $100,000 with Finn on Atom losing within the first round, tries to leave but is cornered by Finn and his fight bookmakers. As the fight continues, Atom lands multiple punches and withstands further attacks but makes no definitive progress. Late in the fourth round, Atom's voice-response controls are damaged, forcing Charlie to fight Zeus with Atom's shadow function. In the fifth and final round, Atom wards off Zeus long enough to deplete its power core, at which point Charlie directs Atom to begin its counterattack against a tired and helpless Zeus. With Zeus's programmers unable to compensate, the designer, Tak Mashido, intervenes and controls Zeus manually. Atom gives Zeus a sound beating, who barely avoids losing by knockout. Zeus wins by decision and remains undefeated, but Mashido's group are left humiliated by the near-loss and Zeus being critically damaged.

His resistance task in the camp has been to capture photos of the horrifying war crimes taking place and smuggle out the negatives that will reveal the crimes to the outside world.\nThis is unknown to Hannah Silberstein, a young German Jew in the work camp with whom Tomasz is in love and who has recently discovered she is pregnant. Every night, Tomasz buys off his officemate with a bottle of vodka so that he and Hannah can be alone together in the office in which Tomasz works with the SS, and they share bread that Tomasz has stolen for them.\nIn 1976, interwoven scenes open the story on the day that Hannah Levine, living in Brooklyn, New York with a successful husband and their grown daughter, discovers that Tomasz, who for 30 years she had believed was dead, is alive. While preparing for a celebratory dinner party for her husband and running an errand at a local dry cleaners, Hannah sees Tomasz in an interview on TV and instantly recognizes him as he shares his story about their love with the interviewer. In a daze, Hannah rushes home, experiencing reactivated trauma that she had shelved, unable to keep her mind on the evening's party and raising the concerns of her family and guests at her distractedness. She desperately calls the Red Cross that day, for the first time since 1946, when her initial search for Tomasz had led to a dead end.\nCutting back to 1944, we see Tomasz implementing a plan for their salvation with the help of fellow inmates, gaining access to an SS uniform and paperwork. On the day of the escape, terrified that it is happening too quickly to be fully prepared, Tomasz dresses up as an SS officer and demands that Hannah follow him, all the while terrified that he will be exposed as a Polish prisoner. Tomasz walks her to the exit of the camp where another SS officer comments that he'd like to rape her; Tomasz barely holds his cover and coldly insists that he have Hannah first. The guard, not picking up on Tomasz's limited German, acquiesces, and Tomasz and Hannah successfully march down the road until out of sight and run off into the woods.\nThey run for weeks, ending up in Tomasz's hometown, at his mother's house. Tomasz's mother, Stefania, does not approve of Hannah, as the latter is both German and a Jew, and furiously insists that Hannah will cause trouble for their family. Hannah, weak and distressed by the outburst, miscarries the same night that a car is ready to take Tomasz to Warsaw, where he must deliver the photos to his brother, who is in the homeland army. With no other option, Tomasz leaves Hannah in his mother's care and tells his neighbor and family friend, Janusz, to take Hannah to the home of Tomasz's sister-in-law, Magdalena, where Hannah can hide more safely. Tomasz assures Hannah he will only be gone for a few days.\nTomasz winds up being gone for a long while. During her recovery at Stefania's, Hannah comes to experience the woman's full animosity when Stefania attempts to have a German officer discover Hannah, but Hannah suspects her motives and hides. Disgusted at this betrayal, Hannah leaves immediately afterward, taking a photo of Tomasz that his mother had kept framed in a place of honor. Hannah goes to Magdalena's home to wait for Tomasz but is still forced to hide from the world.\nWhen Czeslav, Tomasz's brother, returns home from Warsaw, hopes for Tomasz's return are high. However, after a month of the three living together, Czeslav comes to believe that Tomasz must be dead, a belief that Hannah refuses to accept.\nThings are tense but harmonious until Stefania shows up at their home, claiming that the Russians took over her home. She soon turns against Magdalena, accusing her of having brought misfortune to the family and criticizing her for letting Hannah live in the house.\nShortly afterward, the Russians show up at their home and take Czeslav and Magdalena to a Soviet work camp; Stefania and Hannah are left behind. Hannah cannot stay with Tomasz's mother, knowing she cannot trust her, and believes it will be for the best if she returns home to Berlin. She trudges off in winter snow and nearly dies but for a passing Red Cross van that happens upon her.\nBack to 1976, Hannah has success - the Red Cross has tracked Tomasz down in Poland. She works up the courage to call him; both are in complete shock that the other has survived. Tomasz initially thinks it is a hoax, but Hannah persists. They speak briefly, at first speaking trepidatiously in German, until they both realize the conversation is much easier in English as both have had much exposure to the language in their subsequent decades. Hannah tells him for the first time that she had been pregnant, a revelation too much for her to bear herself, and she hangs up, promising to call again. A brief flashback reveals that long after Hannah returned to Berlin, Tomasz returned home to find only his mother, who told him that Czeslav and Magdalena had been sent to a work camp, and (disingenuously) that Hannah had died.\nBack in 1976, after a wrenching outing of her secret search that anguishes her husband and daughter, Hannah's husband encourages her to go see this man who saved her. Hannah travels to Poland to visit Tomasz, who has a grown daughter of his own and is separated from his wife.

Everything changes during a trip to the cemetery, however, where he briefly encounters a grieving drag queen named Pops (Roderick Paulate) and taunts him for his sexuality. Infuriated, Pops swears that Remington would grow up to become gay on his 21st birthday, scaring the young boy.\nMany years later, an epidemic of murders of gay men erupts in the little town of Lucban, which Remington's mother Fe (Janice de Belen), a policewoman, and her co-policewoman Mimi (Angelica Kanapi) are unable to solve. Twenty-year old Remington (Martin Escudero) takes a peek at one such crime scene along with curious passersby in the nearest field when he chances upon a young woman named Hannah Montano (Lauren Young), who recently returned to her hometown, and tries getting to know her, only for her to shun his advances after learning who he is through his best friend Jigs (Kerbie Zamora).\nDuring a street basketball game with their friends, Remington notices a mysterious flying aura in the shape of a pink scarf (a manifestation of the curse) taunting his surroundings, which briefly distracted him until a basketball hits him. In an attempt to court Hannah further, Remington volunteers himself and Jigs to help paint her newly furnished house, only for her to spurn him further after revealing that he was the same little boy who once mocked her late father for being gay, earning him the ire of her grieving mother, Mrs. Montano (Eugene Domingo).\nThat very same night, Remington dreamt of himself and Jigs taking a bath outside their home, only to be attacked by a buffed man wielding a razor, with a butterfly tattoo on his chest. He wakes up with cuts on his legs, having lost all his body hair. His father, Ed (John Regala) notices his new look during a drinking session with his homophobic friends Suarez (Daniel Fernando) and Serge (Leandro Baldemor) and proudly declares his son as a \"real man\" who is off to court women.\nMeanwhile, as the murders in the barrio continue to persist, Remington tells his mother about his dream and tries helping her by identifying available suspects. Concerned, his mother asks if he might be closet gay, to which Remington adamantly denies. His mother berates him for not wanting to go to Manila for college and asks what he truly wants in his life, to which he doesn't reply.\nLater that night, as another gay man gets murdered inside a beauty parlor, Remington dreamt of mistakenly boarding a tricycle thought to be Jigs', only to discover that the driver was the same strange man who attacked him in his first dream. He is instead brought to a secluded spot in the middle of the forest, where he is paddled by the same man and has his tongue pulled out. Eventually, Remington \"wakes up\" from this dream, only to discover that he can now speak \"gay\" and realizes that the curse from his childhood is starting to come true. Despite trying his best to hide his sexuality, however, his newfound behavior has changed Hannah and her mother's perception of him, and Hannah eventually falls for the new Remington.\nAs the curse continues to strengthen, Remington learns that his mannerisms are starting to become more feminine and his wardrobe preferences start to change. At the same time, he starts falling for his best friend Jigs, who eventually tries to seduce him but refuses to continue after learning that most of the gay men he had affairs with were murdered. Remington realizes how he is starting to lose himself and starts consulting his gay helper Georgia (Nar Cabico) on what to do.\nAfter briefly consulting an albularyo (Marian Rivera), Remington, Hannah and Jigs track down Pops, the mysterious drag queen who cursed him during his youth and discover his mansion. The aged Pops initially denied putting a curse on Remington and attempted to have his pager boy shoo the trio away until Remington sees a portrait of the gay man in his house and starts calling Pops \"Bakla!\" to make him remember. Furious, Pops calls him out and confirms he did put the curse on him, but unfortunately has no idea how to undo the curse. He, however, helps conduct a seance with the trio in order to communicate with the mysterious men who haunt Remington's dreams. The mysterious men manifest before them and reveal a clear solution: the only way for him to remove the curse is to find a purely heterosexual man who will choose to become gay in his place.\nJust as the trio, Pops and his pager boy set off to town and find possible replacements, they find themselves being blocked by the culprit of the murders: Remington's godfather, Suarez, whose \"gaydar\" gun led him to them and kills Pops. As the trio runs away from the scene, the distraught pager boy brings back his beloved master back from the dead, along with the souls of other drag queens who have been murdered to exact justice, in the form of zombies, which flock to town and promptly start attacking citizens.\nWith the time ticking, Remington, Hannah and Jigs make it to the former's birthday party, where they ask the rest of their friends if they are willing to take the curse in his place. None of them agree, in which Remington reluctantly agrees on staying that way, until Hannah snaps him out of it and retorts that real gay men continue to fight oppression due to the stigma, and that she knows he is not like this, so he doesn't have to give up being who he originally was.\nAs the rest of the town is being attacked by gay zombies (aptly called \u201czombadings\u201d, or \u201cgay zombies\u201d), Remington eventually meets his father, who protects him by stepping between him and Suarez. Just as Suarez is about to fire his gun, the gaydar fails, with Remington's father proudly declaring that his son is not gay, contrary to what Suarez thinks. During the ruckus, however, Serge gets attacked by zombies and dies from his injuries, prompting Suarez to cradle his cohort's body as he mourns his death. Having sensed Suarez's brief moment of affection, the gesture reactivates the gaydar gun and fired at Suarez, ending his life.\nMinutes before the curse takes over, Remington desperately explains to his skeptical father about the curse and his current predicament. The latter asks what his son needs to undo it and reluctantly but willingly agrees to become gay in his son's place, turning his son back to normal right before midnight.\nLife returns to normal in Lucban. Remington is set on leaving the town to continue his studies in Manila. Hannah, however, has finally set up the dorm she dreamt of putting up as her business. Serge and Suarez are buried under the same gravesite, while Pops and the rest of the \"zombadings\" set up a hat shop in an undisclosed park. Remington's father, however, lives a normal but pleasant life, now as an openly gay father, who also settles on eyeing passing men with his wife, one of the men has the husband and wife agreed in sync.\nMeanwhile, somewhere in Lucban, another tricycle stops in the middle of the street and unloads a gay man. A passing boy loudly tells his mother that he sees a gay man, which initially offends the latter, only for the kid to add that the gay man is beautiful as they part and the film zooms out of Lucban.\nIn the closing credits, a Bollywood-style production number in the street ensues with Remington's now-gay father (John Regala) as star attraction.", "tmdb_plot": "A boy cursed to turn gay when he grows up must sort out his feelings for the girl he loves and the boy \u2013 his best friend \u2013 he is suddenly lusting after, come to terms with his homophobia, and escape a pscho gay killer on the loose.", "tmdb_id": "96239", "wiki_id": "46666031"}, {"title": "Rent Boys", "genres": ["Documentary"], "wiki_plot": "The realities of life of male prostitutes in Berlin are dealt with through interviews with young men who are or were sexworkers.

However, during Will's presentation for the drug, Bright Eyes is forced from her cage, goes on a rampage, and is shot to death. Will's boss Steven Jacobs terminates the project and has the chimpanzees euthanized. However, Will's assistant Robert Franklin reveals that the reason for Bright Eyes' rampage was that she had recently given birth to an infant chimpanzee. Will reluctantly takes in the chimpanzee, eventually giving him the name Caesar. Discovering that Caesar has inherited his mother's intelligence through being exposed to ALZ-112 before birth, Will decides to raise him. Three years pass, Caesar becomes highly intelligent and can play games, draw pictures, and communicate with Will through sign language. Will introduces Caesar to the redwood forest at Muir Woods National Monument so he can roam.

When Dodge attempts to get him back into his cage, Caesar speaks for the first time, shouting \"no\" and fights with Dodge while freeing the apes, which inadvertently leads to Dodge's death. The apes flee the facility, releasing Koba and the remaining apes from Gen-Sys, and freeing more apes from the San Francisco Zoo.

Father Matthew, apparently wanting to talk to Michael, attempts to catch up to him on the street. He trips over a curb, causing a cyclist, Sandra, to swerve into the path of an oncoming van, and get critically injured. Seeing Michael's clerical garb, she asks him for absolution before her last breath. The hesitant Michael is unable to refuse; he comforts her and performs a blessing ritual to absolve her of her sins. Seeing how calmly Michael handled the situation, Father Matthew tells Michael that he is called to be a priest despite his unwillingness. He also tells Michael that with the rise in demonic possessions every year, the Church needs more exorcists and says that he has the potential to become one.

He, his wife Gwen and his stepdaughter Angie attend a megachurch, the Church of the Third Millennium, run by the charismatic Pastor Dan Day, who is planning to expand his church into a large Christian community, \"City on a Hill\". At the start of the film, the Vandermeers attend a debate between Pastor Dan and Professor Paul Blaylock, an outspoken atheist. At the end of the debate, Pastor Dan is invited to Blaylock's college for a nightcap. He brings along Carl. At Blaylock's office, he reveals that he invited Pastor Dan over to propose that the two of them, both bestselling authors, collaborate on a book about their opposing worldviews and views on religion. During a discussion about morality without religion, Pastor Dan picks up an antique pistol and pulls the trigger on Blaylock, unaware that the gun is loaded and functional. The bullet hits Blaylock in the skull, apparently killing him. In a state of shock, Pastor Dan places the gun in Blaylock's hand to make it look like a suicide. He and Carl then drive home in silence, neither of them telling anyone what happened.\nAfter getting a call from a stranger claiming to be his \"friend\", Pastor Dan approaches Carl's neighbor, videographer Jerry Hobson, and appears to confess to what happened. At the sermon the next day, Pastor Dan informs the congregation that Blaylock survived his \"suicide\", the bullet was removed and he is in a coma. After the sermon, Jerry takes Carl aside and gets into his car. During the drive, Jerry turns out to have been told by Pastor Dan that Carl was the one who pulled the trigger and tried to cover it up. Jerry drives Carl to a quarry and tries to execute him. He is distracted when Angie, who was asleep in the backseat of the car, interrupts the act, allowing Carl to knock Jerry out with a rock. Carl then meets with Gwen and her father, Jim Hunt, and tells them what happened with Pastor Dan and Jerry, but neither believes him, thinking it was a dream or an \"acid flashback\". Realizing they will tell Pastor Dan, Carl goes to Blaylock's college, where he runs into Honey Foster, a friend from his Deadhead days who became campus security and met him at the debate. He asks her to turn in the footage from a security camera that would have seen him and Pastor Day enter, but finds that the footage has been altered to erase them - apparently by Jerry, who worked at the campus as a video technician.\nMeeting with Gwen and Jim, Pastor Day convinces them that Carl may be unstable and will react violently if he is caught by the police. Meanwhile, since most of the police are loyal to Pastor Dan, Honey lets Carl hide at her house until things blow over. While they are out driving, Carl's car is stopped by a group of armed men who kidnap him. He wakes up in the house of Jorge Guzman de Vaca, a Mexican crime lord who claims he is in Mexico. Guzman shows that he has a secret recording of Pastor Dan shooting Professor Blaylock. He makes Carl write down and sign two confessions. One tells the truth of what happened, but in the other Carl backs up Pastor Dan's story. Guzman, who has a large business in construction, plans to use the recording to blackmail Pastor Dan into giving him the contract to build City on a Hill, promising to keep Carl in the house until the project is done.\nThe next morning, when Guzman, revealed to be Pastor Day's mysterious \"friend\", leaves to make the deal, Carl escapes the house, which turns out to be in the same state as the church, with a DVD containing the footage hidden in a bible. He calls Gwen, asking her not to tell Pastor Dan and to call the police, and later sees a news report revealing that Professor Blaylock has woken up and can tell the truth. Carl is picked up by a detective, who turns out to be in league with Pastor Dan and Jerry, whom Gwen called instead. Jerry and the detective take a handcuffed Carl to an abandoned warehouse to burn him with gasoline, but discover that none of them have any matches or a lighter. When they try to light the gasoline with a stun gun, they bungle it and get set on fire themselves, allowing Carl to escape. Meanwhile, Pastor Dan meets with Guzman at the construction site of City on a Hill. Guzman tries to play the DVD of the shooting, but instead plays a sex tape he made with his wife. Offended, Pastor Dan starts hitting him, but is stopped when Guzman stabs him in the abdomen and leaves him in the trunk of a car. After a while, Carl arrives by foot and finds the bleeding Pastor Dan, who is hallucinating because of the blood loss and thinks he is at the Pearly Gates, and calls for help on a cell phone. Thinking Carl is an angel, Pastor Dan asks him if he is going to heaven. Out of sympathy, Carl tells him he is. As Carl waits for help to arrive, a bolt of lightning strikes the ground behind him, severing his handcuffs.\nThe credits reveal that Pastor Day survived, spent two years in jail, where he founded a new ministry inspired by his near-death experience, and became a real-estate broker in Arizona. Gwen divorced Carl citing irreconcilable differences, though Carl still has a good relationship with Angie. Jim started his own private investigation firm and went back to his old Episcopal church.

Josh's father, Frank (Richard Roxburgh), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. As Josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.\nWhile exploring the entrance to the new system, Judes (Allison Cratchley) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask forcing Frank to buddy breathe. After a few exchanges, Judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. As Judes drowns, Josh watches on a monitor at \"forward camp\" and presumes the worst of his father. In a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task Josh did not do. Meanwhile, their above-ground crew realises that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. They attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.\nWhile Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a cyclone, causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through \"the elevator\" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to \"forward camp\" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape. Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victoria's line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him.\nThe team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Jude's old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully drowns him.\nThe team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George\u2014an experienced, veteran diver\u2014has become ill due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realises that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.\nAs the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear; she loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victoria's death, Carl becomes emotionally unstable. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII Japanese tank collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately, the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. They spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.\nA little later they discover Carl whose state of mind has worsened considerably, having found Victoria's corpse. Carl attempts to murder Frank for Victoria's death but Josh separates the two and temporarily disables Carl. Frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a stalagmite which punctured his back. When Carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realised and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. In immense pain, Frank requests that Josh drown him. Josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel.\nA short distance in, he encounters Carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit.

Whelan notices similarities between the designs of the box and gauntlet and uses the armor to open the box, revealing the mummified Banshee head. When Whelan is out of the room on a phone call with the Dean, the head opens its eyes and starts screaming, causing Otto and Janie's ears to bleed and incapacitating everyone within earshot of the scream before the head bursts into flames and disintegrates. Nearby university security officer Pete Sioux's earpiece is damaged from the scream and he attempts to remove it in the bathroom. He's attacked when the banshee, in an old grotesque woman form, rushes from one of the stalls and kills him with her scream.\nThat night, each person who heard the banshee's scream is haunted by the creature in some way: Whelan, while she is sleeping; Otto, as he plays video games; Janie, while she bathes.

Sam passes basic training alongside fellow recruits; the mild mannered Curtis and na\u00efve hothead, Niall. The other officers include Chief Officer Rumpole and experienced officers, Deano, Jamie and Eddie as well as female officer Charlie and the volatile male officer, Hunington. The prisons warden Keenan establishes to the new recruits that the prison is under his complete authority.\nHunington causes a small brawl causing Jamie to be punched. Sam clashes with Hunington after work though Deano defends Hunington leaving Sam somewhat ostracised. Sam continues to bond with Curtis and falls under the tutelage of Eddie. After handling a few minor incidents Sam grows to enjoy his work and after work pub trips with his colleagues. After a specialist prisoner Bear is caught attempting to smuggle drugs Sam and Eddie are forced to detain him. Bear fights back and injures Charlie affording Sam and Eddie the opportunity to restrain him via standard training methods and completely by the book. In spite of this, Deano informs Sam that Bear is an untouchable prisoner having been transferred after being assaulted by guards in his last prison. As such Bear cuts a deal with Keenan who himself is trying to prove to his superiors that he is against prison violence and considers himself a reformist. Bear insists that Eddie used unreasonable force allowing Keenan to fire him and raise his own stock while causing Sam to bond more with Deano and Jamie over Eddie's unfair dismissal.\nSam clashes with one of the prisons top inmates, Truman (and his right-hand man Steadman), and confronts Keenan about the unfair treatment Eddie received but is shocked when Keenan informs him that if Sam wants to take the matter further it will be assumed he too was abusing his power and will come under police investigation. Deano and Sam bond over their distaste of Keenan and Sam embraces Deano's lifestyle of strip clubs, heavy drinking and substance abuse, thus causing a rift between himself and his wife Danielle. The continual stress of his work including Truman discovering his address, Steadman in solitary confinement requiring the intervention of Sam, Jamie and Deano in riot gear, and the suicide of another prisoner, all compound Sam's PTSD over the death of Douglas. Meanwhile, Truman and Steadman kill Bear after discovering the special treatment he receives from Keenan.\nWhile Sam's mental state deteriorates, Curtis reveals he has a snitch in the prison who has given him a tip off. As a result, Steadman is caught in possession of a large amount of drugs as well as the clothes Truman wore to kill Bear. Steadman is detained and the officers assume that Truman's day will be done after the forensic reports from the clothes return. Late one night Curtis is killed forcing Sam to confess his struggles to Danielle. The two reconcile and Sam soon finds from his drug trafficking friends outside of prison that Deano is 'bent' and working with Truman, likely behind the death of Curtis and planning to kill his informant. Sam immediately tells Jamie. Shortly after a riot breaks out and Niall is taken hostage alongside a fellow officer. Sam and Jamie fight their way to Truman and Deano but find no informant. Deano reveals that both he and Jamie are bent and that Truman runs drugs for them inside. The trio do not care about the informant as the death of Curtis has likely kept them quiet, all they need to get away with their crimes is to kill Sam and blame his death on the riot. Truman suddenly turns on the pair and attacks Jamie allowing Sam to overpower Deano. The riot ends as riot officers enter and all 4 are detained.\nTruman cuts a deal with Keenan for no repercussions in his role in the death of Bear as well as a transfer to a safer wing; in return Truman will testify against Deano and Jamie, exposing their corruption and justifying Sam as a hero.

Trying to conceal their identities as deserters, Behmen's known sword crest reveals that they are crusader knights. They are arrested and taken to Cardinal D'Ambroise, who is near death from the plague. The Cardinal asks the knights to escort an alleged witch, suspected of causing the pestilence, to a remote monastery, where a group of monks can determine if she is truly a witch. If found guilty, they can perform a sacred ritual to cancel her powers and stop the plague. Both knights agree under the condition that she be given a fair trial and the charges of desertion against them be dropped.

They locate the ancient volume, The Key of Solomon, filled with the holy rituals used to defeat evil. Debelzaq begins speaking the ritual used on witches. In a deep voice, Anna begins recounting Behmen's horror of Crusader cruelties, just as Debelzaq realizes that she is not a witch, but has been possessed by a demon. He frantically performs an exorcism. The demon that is possessing Anna finally reveals its form and melts the cage's metal, escaping, while fighting off the knights. When Debelzaq throws a container of holy water on it, the demon flies screeching out of sight.

The organization's code phrase is: \"The hungry rabbit jumps.\"\nSix months later, Simon returns. He wants Will to follow a woman and her two children to the zoo and to look out for a man. If Will sees this man, he must call a number attached to a picture. Will agrees, hoping this will fulfill his debt. Simon, however, continues to call Will, asking him to continue what he is doing, claiming the man is a sex offender. Having no choice, as Simon promises to exact revenge if he does not obey, a reluctant Will agrees. He is instructed to kill the man on a pedestrian walkway that is under a high overpass by \"accidentally\" bumping him off it to his death, making it look like suicide.\nInstead of killing the man, Will decides to see if the man has any knowledge of Simon. The man, already paranoid, becomes suspicious that Will is there to kill him. He throws his bicycle at Will. As they struggle, the man falls off the walkway despite Will's efforts to save him. The man lands and is hit by a truck. Will goes home, where Detective Rudeski (Joe Chrest) and Detective Green (Marcus Lyle Brown) arrest him for murdering the man, whose name is Alan Marsh. At the station, Will cannot get Green and Rudeski to believe anything he says.\nThe detectives' boss, Lieutenant Durgan (Xander Berkeley), wants to talk to Will alone. Durgan wants to play a game, asking Will to complete sentences. After a few rounds, Durgan asks, \"A hungry rabbit...\" to which Will responds \"Jumps. A hungry rabbit jumps\", signifying his connection to Simon's organization. Durgan lets Will go free, giving him 24 hours to get out of the city before Simon and his henchmen Scar (Irone Singleton) and Cancer (Wayne P\u00e9re) come looking for him.\nWill runs, but he is looking for answers. He goes to a memorial for Alan, and finds out that the man was not a sex offender but actually an award-winning investigative reporter for the New Orleans Post, who was investigating the vigilante organization. Will now knows why Simon wanted Alan dead. Simon, Scar, and Cancer suddenly turn up. Scar chases Will out onto a busy street, but is accidentally killed by an SUV that hits and drags him.\nWill goes to a storage facility that Alan used and finds a DVD describing some of the people in the group, along with their missions. Will explains what is happening to Laura, who says she would have done the same had their situations been reversed. Will then tells Laura his whereabouts, advising her to stay away from the cops and anyone else who is asking questions.\nWill learns that Simon's real name is Eugene Cook and that Jimmy joined the organization years ago, after his brother was murdered and the cops were unable to find the killer. Will sends Cook a clip of video by phone, showing that he has the DVD and what it contains. Cook agrees to a trade where Will will receive the security camera footage proving his innocence in Alan's death, as he was acting out of self-defense, in exchange for the DVD. Will agrees, and they agree to meet at the Louisiana Superdome, during a monster truck show.\nAt the dome, Will is told that Laura has been kidnapped and he is shown a photo of Laura gagged with tape as an extra incentive to make him give up the DVD. They go to a nearby mall, abandoned since Hurricane Katrina. Jimmy, Cancer, and a man called Sideburns (Dikran Tulaine) are holding Laura at gunpoint, with her hands tied and duct tape over her mouth. Will gives up the DVD, but Cook reneges on the deal, saying that Will and Laura will both be killed to remove all threats to the organization. He orders them to be shot (only to be distracted by Will branding him an insane hypocrite, Cook enraged by this, rants over how \"he\" is at least making a difference compared to apathy of others).\nCancer is about to pull the trigger on a bound and tapegagged Laura when he is fatally shot by Jimmy, after which Will forces Sideburns down an inactive escalator, then through the glass at the bottom of the escalator. Sideburns is killed when a chunk of the glass impales his neck.\nJimmy says that they did not get into the organization to kill innocent people, with Cook and Jimmy exchanging gunfire, until Cook kills Jimmy with two shots to the chest (mockingly demanding if Jimmy is happy about their predicament). Laura removes the strip of duct tape gagging her mouth and flees with a gun in her hand. Cook catches her and throws her into a glass display case, causing her to drop the gun. Will arrives and begins beating up Cook, but both fall onto another escalator, rolling to the bottom. Laura, who has grabbed the gun that Cook forced her to drop, shoots Cook six times, killing him.\nHappy to be alive, Will and Laura walk back up the escalator. Durgan arrives, asking who killed Cook. Will responds that it was him, but Durgan says that the way he sees it, the dead guys killed each other. There was no one else present. He goes down to arrange things so the evidence shows this.\nWith the DVD still in hand, Will is cleared of any wrongdoing. He decides to follow up on Alan's work by giving the DVD to Gibbs (Mike Pniewski), a reporter whom Will met at Alan's memorial. Thanking him, Gibbs says, \"The hungry rabbit jumps, eh?\" indicating to a surprised Will that Gibbs is also in the organization.", "tmdb_plot": "After his wife is assaulted, a husband enlists the services of a vigilante group to help him settle the score.", "tmdb_id": "74998", "wiki_id": "26508343"}, {"title": "Seema Tapakai", "genres": ["Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Sri Krishna (Allari Naresh) is the son of a big businessman and multimillionaire, GK (Sayaji Shinde).

Kadam's wife Megha vows revenge against Jaikant in front of him, exclaiming that God will dispense justice to him for this act.\nThe story moves to Shivgad, a small village near the Goa-Maharashtra border. Bajirao Singham, an honest police officer like Kadam, is in charge of the Shivgad police station. A station house officer in charge of his town, he resolves most of the problems in his town informally and without filing charge sheets, thereby gaining much reputation and love from the villagers. Gautam \"Gotya\" Bhosle is an industrialist and Bajirao's father Manikrao \"Manya\" Singham's childhood friend. He comes to Shivgad with his wife and daughters Kavya and Anjali. Eventually, Singham and Kavya fall in love with each other. Their courtship takes place through a series of comic events where she initially hates him after he slaps her tight when she is caught frightening villagers disguising as a ghost, but then has a change of heart when she sees his honest and simple nature and finds that he wants to apologize for his behaviour.\nEverything seems to run smoothly until Jaikant, who is given conditional bail for a murder he had committed, is required to travel to Shivgad to sign the bail through a fortnight. Acting on the recommendation of his top lieutenant Shiva Naik, he instead sends one of his allies, Vitthal Dalvi, and his men, to do the formalities, much to the fury of Singham who demands Jaikant sign the bail-in person within the next four hours. An enraged Jaikant reaches Shivgad to confront Singham, but the villagers, upon hearing of his comments against Singham, threaten to finish him off, damaging his convoy's vehicles in a dramatic show of public power. Singham asks his assistant, Ramesh Kelkar, to bring the register containing Jaikant's record, forces a thumb impression of Jaikant's left hand onto the register, and warns him to continue signing the bail for the remaining 14 days, as a humiliated Jaikant looks on terrified by Singham's courage and leaves the village on foot as a sign of protest, refusing to travel by wheels. On the highway, as he stops at a point, he recalls his humiliation, learns of Singham's background from Shiva through a source, and using his political contacts, gets Singham transferred to Goa to seek revenge.\nSingham, unaware of Jaikant's hand behind his transfer, joins the Colva police station in Goa as the in-charge, when on the very first day, he is confronted by Jaikant, who shows Singham his true colours and tries to intimidate him by mentioning how the officer preceding him ended up committing suicide, warning Singham that he is out to trouble him to no end. Eventually, in a discussion with his co-workers and juniors, Sub-Inspector Dev Phadnis, Sub-Inspector Abbas Malik, and Head Constable Prabhu Sawalkar, he learns how much the three officers hate Jaikant for his crimes but are unable to take any action because of Jaikant's political powers. DSP Satyam Patkar, Singham's senior, is on Jaikant's payroll and takes care in concealing and eliminating the evidence of Jaikant's crime from the eyes of the law. Singham, upon learning of Kadam's tragedy from the colleagues and Megha, and taking cues from what he has already seen, tries to take this to the notice of DGP Vikram Pawar but it turns out to be of no use as there is no evidence against Jaikant and Patkar. Local minister Narvekar soon adds to Singham's troubles when he refuses to support him against Jaikant, later launching the latter as a candidate from his local political party. Feeling defeated and mentally tortured by Jaikant to no limits, a worried Singham first contemplates returning home but is stopped by Kavya, who encourages him to fight against the evil and not run away like a coward. At that point, some of Jaikant's henchmen attack him, and he, realizing the futility of returning to Shivgad, brutally beats the goons black and blue, locking them up.\nSingham then arrests Shiva in a fake case of illegally smuggling alcohol after setting him up to tear the FIR against the goons, who he had come to free, and recalling to the officers that Shiva, under Jaikant's orders, had planted bundles of cash in Kadam's jeep. Later, he thwarts off Patkar in full view of the public when Patkar, bounded by his duties to Jaikant, tries to bail Shiva out. Jaikant kidnaps Kavya's younger sister Anjali for ransom on Kavya's birthday.

Due to the suspension of his official experiments, Ledgard asks Marilia to dismiss the other servants.\nWhile Ledgard is out, Marilia's estranged son Zeca, having committed a robbery, arrives in a tiger costume and asks his mother to hide him for a few days. He sees Vera on Ledgard's security camera screens and demands to see her in person. When Marilia refuses to let him stay after she invites him in, he binds and gags her and then rapes Vera.

Zeca later left to live in the streets and smuggle drugs, while Ledgard went to medical school and married a woman named Gal. When Zeca returned years later, he and Gal ran off together.

Xu Xian comes across them and offers a boat ride to the city. Susu starts thinking about the day she kissed Xu Xian and decides to head to the city to find him. Meanwhile, while Qingqing is exploring the city, she comes across Neng Ren and decides to help him subdue the bat demon by revealing its location. Neng Ren defeats the bat demon's cohorts, but is unable to subdue the bat demon king and is bitten. Though he is subsequently saved by Fahai, Neng Ren starts turning into a bat demon himself the next day and decides to run away. Meanwhile, Xu Xian recognizes Susu and they spend the night together, oblivious to the fact that she is a snake in human form.\nNeng Ren is found by Qingqing and the two befriend each other. They realize that Neng Ren, despite becoming a bat demon, still has all his human taste for human food, and most of his human qualities. Meanwhile, Xu Xian and Susu wed. Fahai gives Xu Xian a dagger that can kill demons, anticipating that Susu is a demon since she is able to counter the poison of the fox demon and confronts and defeats her but spares her as she had helped save others with a warning to leave Xu Xian as their union will only cause pain and threatens to kill her otherwise. When she doesn't, Fahai and his disciples attack her and Xu Xian's cottage. Susu fights the battle in snake form, but is stabbed by Xu Xian, who is unaware of her true identity. Susu escapes but is gravely injured. Xu Xian, after realizing what he has done, decides to get the spirit root to heal her.\nHelped by Susu's friend, a mouse, Xu Xian manages to retrieve a root kept inside the Lei Feng Pagoda, but is possessed by demons since the root was the thing that kept the demons in place. Fahai and the other monks capture Xu Xian and prepare to cast spells to banish the demons from his body. When Susu recovers, she goes to find Xu Xian along with Qingqing. They are confronted by Fahai, who tries to explain to them that the spell should not be broken before it is complete. Susu, however, does not believe him and accuses him of trying to separate them. The two sisters battle Fahai and after Fahai breaks their swords, they retaliate by unleashing a tidal wave on Jinshan that Fahai is able to cut in two to prevent too much damage only to be attacked by their true forms. Susu releases Xu Xian from the spell, but he does not have any memory of Susu. Susu blames this on Fahai and they battle. Despite managing to repel Susu's fierce snakes and incapacitate Qingqing, Fahai is left defeated as he questions whether he was too driven on his demon-hunting and fierce defense of Buddha as despite all his efforts, disasters would continue on without stopping. When Susu recommences the battle, Fahai is empowered by his faith in Buddha and manifesting many divine arms around him, easily deflects all of Susu's attacks before he is able to trap Susu in Lei Feng Pagoda. At this point, Susu repents and asks to see Xu Xian just one last time. Buddha implores Fahai to fulfill Susu's wish and Fahai, filled with the divine spirit, obeys and lifts up the pagoda, temporarily freeing Susu. After an emotional talk with Xu Xian, Susu kisses him, causing him to remember everything. Susu is then sucked back into the temple as Fahai lets go of the temple, trapping Susu there again much to Xu Xian's sadness. Qingqing, watching all this from a distance with Neng Ren, tells him that she doesn't want to love anyone as her sister loved Xu Xian, and leaves saying that he will never be a true bat demon anyway.\nIn the epilogue, Xu Xian picks herbs around the pagoda, while Susu has returned to her snake form trapped inside the temple. Fahai is seen walking around the mountainside when suddenly Neng Ren (now a complete bat demon) appears alongside him. Throwing him an apple, Fahai tells him that he has grown used to his new look, and they journey together again.", "tmdb_plot": "The Sorcerer and the White Snake is an ancient Chinese fable about a woman demon who falls in love with a mortal is brought to life through the latest advances in CGI and action techniques.", "tmdb_id": "75948", "wiki_id": "30574080"}, {"title": "Soul Surfer", "genres": ["Family", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "In 2003, 13-year-old Bethany Hamilton lives in Kauai, Hawaii with her parents Tom and Cheri, and two older brothers, Noah and Timmy.

It works, and the realization that she can use her gift to inspire people motivates her to take up surfing again.\nTom, who believes that Bethany possesses a great surfer's instinct for sensing when the best waves will form, rigs a handle on her surfboard which she can use to prevent falling off while paddling out to the waves, which is not prohibited by the competition's rules. Bethany trains for the competition while rekindling her friendship with Alana. She enters the national championship. During the competition, she performs respectably, though she is still chasing third place. Suddenly, with only minutes left on the clock, the waves die down and all the surfers can only loiter, waiting for the waves to start back up.

Raunak continues working and playing gigs at clubs, but his hearing degrades rapidly and progress on his album stagnates. Raunak refuses to acknowledge his problem until a gig in the club, when he cannot hear the second channel in his headphones and must crossfade one song into the next without being able to beatmatch them. The crowd boos him, and he throws the turntable and the mixer onto the dance floor, and is forcibly removed from the club. Raunak agrees to see a doctor (Manu Rishi), who tells him he's lost hearing in one ear and has 30% left in the other. He warns Raunak that unless he stops abusing drugs and listening to loud noises, he will soon be completely deaf.\nDuring a recording session, Raunak confesses the full nature of his hearing loss to Banjo. He inserts his hearing aid to demonstrate, and, overwhelmed by the sudden sound exposure, leans close to one of the monitor speakers. Before he can react, however, a frustrated Biscuit smashes a guitar into an amplifier whose volume is maximized. The noise is excruciating, and the feedback knocks Raunak unconscious.

The sergeant insists they must now enter the base to use the medical facilities in order to save the critically injured Parra.\nInside the base the squad finds only a few bodies but bloodstains and destroyed rooms everywhere. The base radios have been destroyed, and the squad personal radios are only short range, so they cannot contact their backup. The sergeant discovers that the base supplies are untouched, indicating that this was not a guerrilla raid.\nExploring the base, their local guide (Fiquitiva, nicknamed \"Indian\") discovers a room filled with fetishes and prayers scrawled on the walls. He calls the others, but is mocked for his superstition. Later, he returns and discovers that the wall of the room has been recently built and something is trapped behind it. The lieutenant order the wall broken down, and they find, trapped inside, a bound woman who cannot, or will not, talk to them. Arango, whose brother was stationed on the base, tries to question her but gets nowhere. The sergeant begins beating her but is stopped by the lieutenant. The lieutenant calls for the medic and puts one of the other soldiers, Ponce, on guard with orders that no-one is to see the prisoner without permission. Ponce starts to offer the woman some food, but is dragged away by the medic, who accuses Ponce of being \"just like the rest\" and that he is disgusted by them all.\nThe squad corporal, Cortez, discovers a bundle of papers under a body and begins to read them as night falls. Ponce, guarding the prisoner, is bullied into leaving by the sergeant, who then enters the room with the prisoner. Reading the papers Cortez discovers that the woman was picked up on suspicion of being a guerilla spy and interrogated, but refused to talk. At the same time she was taken prisoner, one of the base soldiers became ill and insisted the woman had placed a curse upon him. The base soldiers became increasingly convinced the woman was a witch and eventually rioted, attempting to cut out her tongue. The log ends without explaining what happens next, only that \"the captain had completely lost control of the men\", at least one of whom had killed another soldier, and the final scrawled words in the log insist that they \"must kill the witch\".\nPonce has a flashback dream to hazy memories of an event before the start of the mission, but is suddenly awoken by shouting from his radio to return to the guard post. Inside, they discover that the sergeant has been killed and the woman has escaped. They spread out looking for her and \"Indian\" falls down a gully, landing in a mass grave of base soldiers. Indian confronts the lieutenant, accusing him of bringing doom on them all by releasing the \"witch\". An argument between Arango and Parra's best friend is interrupted when the perimeter noisemakers are tripped at one of the lookout points. The mist means that they cannot see anything, but corporal Cortez defies the lieutenant to lead the men out to attempt to kill the \"guerrilla bitch\".\nOut in the mist, the men begin shooting at fast moving shapes that whip past them, but only succeed in shooting Arango in the crossfire, killing him. The lieutenant, furious at Arango's death and the squad for disobeying his orders, attempts to relieve Parra's friend of his weapon, but is stopped by the corporal, who accuses him of knowing about the witch from the logbook all along. The lieutenant denies knowing anything and arguing that it is Cortez's fault for leading the men out into the mist, but the men side with the corporal and tie up the lieutenant in the radio room.\nIndian, who has been furiously scratching since falling in the pit, goes to the medic and demands treatment because he has caught \"the plague\" from the dead bodies. The medic throws him out, distraught because Parra has gangrene and is dying. Ponce tries to talk to Cortez insisting the situation has gone well beyond their control, but the corporal insists he will get all of them out safe. Indian steals gasoline from the base generator to burn the corpse pit, then strips off his clothes. Disgusted, the corporal kicks him back toward the pit then locks him out of the base.\nIn a last effort to save his life, the remaining team try to amputate Parra's leg, but he dies shortly after the operation. Angry, and with no reason to remain with his patient, the medic prepares to leave. The corporal refuses to let him, as whoever killed the sergeant is still out there. In a rage, the medic reveals that he killed the sergeant rather than let him rape and murder another woman, referencing the events from Ponce's flashback. In retaliation, Cortez beats the medic to death in front of the horrified Ponce. A scream from outside prompts Ponce and Parra's friend to try and rescue Indian, but Indian is trying to cut off his \"contaminated\" skin and stabs Parra's friend to death when found (Indian is not seen again after this). Ponce tries to persuade Cortez to leave, but the corporal is now totally insane and Ponce is forced to kill him in self-defense.\nPonce climbs slowly down the mountain, suffering flashbacks to the events before the mission - the massacre of an entire village of guerrilla sympathisers.

He is talented and well liked by his peers. The English teacher, Ms. Rosy, (Divya Dutta) is particularly impressed with his creativity, wit, and humour.  Stanley is shown with a bruised face in the opening scene of the movie. On being questioned about it by Ms. Rosy, he concocts an elaborate story, much to her amusement. His humorous essays and offhand poem recitations make him her favourite in class. However his imagination is not always rewarded; his science teacher (Divya Jagdale) rebukes his attempt at constructing a light house as part of the class project since it does not adhere to the topics covered in class.\nIt is shown early on that he doesn't bring his lunch box or 'dabba' to school, unlike all his other classmates. Verma (Amole Gupte) is a ravenous Hindi teacher; a phagomaniac who does not bring his own dabba either but lusts after everyone else's, also stealing food on occasion. The kids at school nickname him as 'Khadoos' (cantankerous person). He has a poor reputation among his peers for his mindless and inconsiderate gluttony. He particularly eyes the dabba of one of Stanley's friends and shamelessly joins the group in class as soon as the lunch bell goes off to gorge on their food. A lot of his class time is spent discussing what his students brought for lunch.\nOne day, he ends up coming late during lunch-break and misses out on eating what he had earlier hoped to eat from the children's dabbas. Upon realising that the food in question was shared with Stanley, Khadoos berates him for not getting his own dabba. Stanley senses Khadoos' hostility towards him and avoids eating from his friends' dabbas thereafter, telling them every day during lunch break that he is going home to enjoy a hot meal prepared by his mother. His friends catch his bluff soon after when they find him loitering around the school during lunch break. When confronted, Stanley tells them that there is no one to cook for him until his parents get back from Delhi. Eager to help their hungry friend out, Stanley's friends start hiding from Khadoos during lunch break while sharing their dabbas with Stanley. Chagrined, Khadoos starts hunting for them arduously during lunch break every day. He catches hold of them eventually on the terrace, empty dabbas in tow. Upon realising that the group shared their lunches with Stanley again, he menacingly threatens Stanley to either bring his own dabba or stop coming to school. Stanley obliges and stops coming to school.\nIn this time, Stanley's friends come to know of an inter-school concert that they think he would be a perfect fit for. However, since he is debarred from school by Khadoos, Stanley remains sceptical about his chances.

Soon after, he is spotted practising by one of the organizers of the concert. His talent is recognised and he is immediately included in the troupe. In the meantime, Stanley's absence is felt by his teachers and friends, who finally spill the beans to Ms. Rosy about the reason behind his nonattendance. Aghast and disgusted, Ms. Rosy confronts Khadoos in front of other staff members asking him to \"have some shame\" since Stanley \"is just a child\". Khadoos begins realising his folly.\nOne fine day, Stanley brings his own dabba to school. He offers it to Khadoos on a platter and asks him for permission to come back to school. Guilt-ridden and shame-faced, Khadoos resigns from his post. He apologises to Stanley in a handwritten letter and promises to never return.\nMeanwhile, the inter-school concert is attended by the entire staff of Holy Family, all of whom appreciate Stanley's performance.

They are going to live in the house of Amy's recently deceased father to allow David to finish a script.\nWhile in town one afternoon, David meets Amy's ex-boyfriend Charlie and his three friends, Norman, Chris, and Bic. David is intimidated by the men, but they have already been hired to fix the roof of the barn on Amy's property. He also meets Tom Heddon, an alcoholic former high school football coach whose 15-year-old cheerleader daughter Janice is in love with a local man with an intellectual disability, Jeremy Niles. Heddon often bullies Jeremy and believes that he is stalking his daughter.\nCharlie and his friends arrive early the next morning to work on the roof. They taunt David, which later escalates into harassment. They also make crude remarks toward Amy and play loud music to distract David while he writes. They often leave early when they want to go hunting, which concerns David because it is taking them a significant amount of time to finish the roof. Amy begins to resent David for not standing up to the men.\nOne Sunday after church, Heddon attacks Jeremy for talking to Janice, and Amy comes to his defense, but David warns her to not get involved. Later that night back at home, David discovers their cat strangled and hung up in the bedroom closet. Amy is positive that Charlie and his friends are to blame as they disappeared from the church barbeque for a few hours earlier, but David is hesitant to confront them. When he does finally question them, the men deny everything.\nCharlie invites David to go deer hunting. While David is out in the woods with two of the men, Charlie goes back to the house and pushes his way inside to confront Amy, because he thinks that she still wants him. He throws her onto the couch and rapes her, while making crude remarks about having sex either with him or with David. Afterwards, he realizes that he raped Amy, and that she did not want any sexual contact, and is stunned. Norman arrives, holds Amy across the top of the couch, and rapes her while Charlie watches. They then leave. When David returns, Amy doesn't tell him what happened. Instead, she encourages David to fire Charlie and his men. The next day David tells Charlie that fixing the roof is taking too long. Charlie insists that they have already paid for the roofing supplies, which David agrees to pay for. Finally, Charlie and his crew leave, celebrating their $5,000 payday.\nDavid and Amy go to a local football game. Janice lures Jeremy into an empty locker room. Heddon notices that his daughter is missing from the game and goes in search of her. Meanwhile, Janice tries to convince Jeremy to let her give him oral sex. They hear Heddon calling for Janice. Afraid of Heddon finding them, Jeremy holds Janice tight against his body with his hand over her mouth and nose, accidentally smothering her to death. Horrified, he runs away from the school. Heddon goes back to tell Charlie and his friends that Janice is missing. They all suspect that Jeremy has done something to her.\nAt the game, Amy has haunting flashbacks about the rapes and asks David to take her home. On the way, she tells him that she wants to return to Los Angeles, surprising him and causing him to accidentally run over Jeremy who is standing in the road, breaking his arm. David and Amy take him back to their home and call an ambulance. Charlie and Norman overhear the ambulance call on a police scanner and inform Heddon. They all drive to David and Amy's house and demand that the couple hand Jeremy over, but David refuses. The sheriff arrives shortly thereafter and tries to calm down the situation. He knocks on the door and tells David to open the door, but David still refuses. Heddon picks up his gun again and shoots the sheriff dead. Having witnessed the murder, David knows now that the men will try to kill not only Jeremy but both of them too. David and Amy barricade the doors shut.

David fights Heddon off and causes him to shoot himself in the foot.

Norman is attempting to rape Amy again when David and Charlie appear. Charlie and Norman draw on each other when Norman threatens to kill Amy. Amy shoots Norman, Charlie assaults and disarms her, then David jumps him. Charlie kicks David down the stairs and beats him severely. As Charlie is preparing to shoot the now-disarmed David lying on the floor, Amy approaches from behind with a shotgun. Charlie turns and tells her the gun is empty. \"I will always protect you, baby,\" declares Charlie, as David rises to slam the open bear trap down on his head, impaling and breaking his neck, and crushing his windpipe.

Sometime later on it is shown that Quintana has become a corrupt cop who regularly extorts a local strip club on the pretext of \"protection\". One night, while collecting his fee, Quintana is suddenly ambushed and killed by a hooded assassin.\nThe day after his funeral, Marty's superior Lieutenant Walker assigned him with a new partner Dan Sullivan to investigate Quintana's murder and to get his killer, dead or alive. They go to the strip club he regularly visited and extorted, and learned from the owner that he used to collect money with his friend whom he describes as \"big, black, and scary\". Sullivan correctly deduces that Fowler was Quintana's friend. He goes to Fowler to ask some questions, but both Fowler and Rogan refuse to cooperate and ominously tell him to leave them alone. Later that night, when Fowler visits a brothel, he's killed by the same assassin who later goes to Rogan's yacht to kill him too.

Sullivan goes to the barn house and discovered Bones' torn fabric cloth.

This was initiated by her stepfather, in an attempt to keep her from talking to the police about how he murdered her sister. Prior to this, the stepfather had murdered the girls' mother and sexually abused them both. He bribes asylum orderly Blue Jones to forge psychiatrist Vera Gorski's signature to have Babydoll lobotomized. Babydoll takes note of four items she would need to escape.\nBabydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she has newly arrived at a brothel owned by Blue, who in this world is a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. Babydoll befriends four other patients: Amber, Blondie, Rocket, and Rocket's sister and \"star of the show\", Sweet Pea. Dr. Gorski is the girls' dance instructor. Blue informs Babydoll her virginity will be sold to a client known as the High Roller, who is actually the doctor scheduled to perform her lobotomy. Gorski has Babydoll perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man. The Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she needs four items to escape: a map, fire, a knife and a key; other than the named items, there is also a fifth unrevealed item that only she can find, which would require \"a deep sacrifice\" and bring a \"perfect victory\". She fights three samurai giants, then finds herself back in the brothel having impressed Blue and other onlookers.\nBabydoll convinces the four girls to join her preparations to escape, planning to use her dances as a distraction while the other girls obtain the necessary tools. During her dances, she fantasizes adventures that mirror the escape efforts.

During the last fantasy, Rocket sacrifices herself to guarantee Sweet Pea's escape from the bomb's blast, paralleled by the Cook fatally stabbing Rocket as she tries to protect her sister.\nBlue overhears Blondie relaying Babydoll's plan to Gorski. He locks Sweet Pea in a closet and confronts the other girls. He fatally shoots Amber and Blondie, and attempts to rape Babydoll, but she stabs him with the kitchen knife and steals his master key.

Eventually, he is found and Na mi goes to visit him. While on her way to see him, she flashes back to the time the group of friends went on a trip together. While on the bus Na-mi draws a portrait of Joon-ho; she later goes in search of him with the intention of giving him the drawing. When she finds him, she is shocked to see him and Su-ji kiss.

Jin-hee is given the position of vice-president; she looks disappointed because she expected something monetary. To that, the lawyer explains, \"You are already rich\" from Chun-hwa.

Jang-mi is elated that she will finally be number one in her sales for that month.

Forgeat arrives, with a fellow officer, and sees Sophie in the street. He gives chase, but Sophie is a keen runner in her spare time, and is able to keep ahead of him. After a lengthy chase through gardens and houses, Sophie reaches a busy road, steals a man\u2019s motorbike, and rides off.\nBy this time, Montreal police have also gone to the house of Claire Marras, and find her lying dead, with her throat cut, in a blood filled bath. It is noted that Claire had paid a large sum of money into her bank account a few days previously.\nAt the Paris police headquarters, a DNA analysis of the headless corpse has been made. The results are surprising; Thomas and Sophie are half-siblings. Forgeat interviews Thomas's parents and his mother explains that she was artificially inseminated, as her husband is sterile. Similarly, Benedicte\u2019s mother admits that she was also artificially inseminated, as she and her husband were not genetically compatible.\nFinding herself once again with nowhere to go, Sophie calls Kourosh, who invites her to stay at his apartment. She tells him the whole story, and he appears sympathetic, but later she hears him on the phone and realises he is in league with B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. She manages to escape from the apartment, but Kourosh pursues her. During the chase, he falls from a balcony into the street and is killed.\nBy now, Detective Forgeat has managed to piece everything together. When Sophie\u2019s parents lived in Paris they were desperately hard up, and her father sold his sperm for extra cash. He thus unknowingly became the father of both Thomas and B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, under an assumed name, took a job at the laboratory in question and discovered the true facts about her parentage.\nSophie returns to Benedicte\u2019s flat to look for clues, but B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte is there and attacks her. Sophie runs off and calls Forgeat, but she has been followed by B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, who overpowers her and knocks her out.\nWhen Sophie wakes, she is at the laboratory in chains. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte tells her that she had the worst childhood imaginable, with a mother who hated her, and when she found out who her biological father\u2019s other children were, she decided to punish them for having been happy when she was not. B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte had cosmetic surgery to look more like Sophie, and she employed Claire Marras, who was a computer expert, to create the Switch website. Claire also deleted the website afterwards, along with Sophie\u2019s flight details.

Two brothers are seen running through a forest from a black wolf. Present in the forest are two hunters in search of hares. While running, one of the brothers stumbles and falls into a creek, and his brother fails to rescue him. The boy is seen drowning.\nThe scene then shifts to a summer day in 1861, where a serf named Tadas Blinda wakes up from dreaming the last scene while washing himself. Then, he and his friend Vincas venture into a forest. While walking, Tadas tells his friend about how the previous landowner Adam Razumowski died during a hunting trip, how his wife committed suicide, and that their money is buried somewhere. Tadas dreams of finding the money and buying his freedom from his master Gruinius. Once they arrive at the forest, they see a young woman by a pond trying to fish out a water lily. The two men think she is a ghost of the late Razumowski's wife and make a scene, frightening the woman so that she falls into the pond. Tadas rushes into the pond to save her.\nThe scene then shifts to a man looking for his wife Konstancija, who is secretly having an affair with a man named Edmundas in the cellar. Konstancija rushes into the hallway and tells her husband, a landowner named Bernardas Gruinius, that she was only looking for the cook. The suspicious Bernardas runs to the cellar to check if someone is there, but finds no one. Edmundas avoids detection by hiding in an old chest.\nIn St. Petersburg, the imperial statesman Mikhail Muravyov informs the Junior Officer of the Imperial Army Janek Razumowski that Czar Alexander II has emancipated the serfs in the Northwestern Krai and commands him to gather his troops to suppress the impending peasant rebellion in that region. On that notice, Janek leaves for Lithuania.\nBack at Gruinius' mansion, steward Edmundas (Konstancija's lover) threatens Bernardas to spill his secret because he is late on his bribe payments. Before a bigger conflict evolves, Janek arrives to the mansion and tells him that he has important news from St. Petersburg. While the serfs are celebrating Saint Jonas' Festival, the Lithuanian nobility (Bernardas included) are discussing the recent Alexander II's Emancipation Manifesto. Janek warns the noblemen that, although the serfs have freedom, they do not have land, which, he cites, is a ground for rebellion.\nMeanwhile, Edmundas tells the serfs that they are free, and directs them to Gruinius's mansion. When the serfs arrive to the mansion, the nobles, feeling threatened, raise arms against them. Bernardas tries to resolve the conflict peacefully, but Janek orders a raid against the peasants.\nDuring the raid, Tadas is captured by Janek's troops, knocked unconscious, and left tied up inside a shack. Later that night, two of Tadas's friends, Vincas and Motiejus, rescue him. While wandering around town at night, Tadas discovers Edmundas making love to Konstancija in the stables. Upon being discovered, Edmundas accidentally knocks a lantern over and causes a fire in the stables, and later, a rebellion.\nIn pursuit by Edmundas, Tadas hides in one of the rooms in Gruinius' mansion. The room happens to be occupied by Kristina, the young woman at the pond whom Tadas rescued earlier. With Kristina's help, Tadas escapes the mansion unnoticed. Outside, Bernardas, Janek and his men try to put out the fire. Tadas chances upon his two friends, Vincas and Motiejus, near the stables, and Janek notices the runaway. Tadas and Vincas attempt to flee from Janek, but Janek shoots and kills Vincas. Before Janek has time to check on the corpse, Tadas is rescued from the scene by Motiejus on horseback.\nAt dawn, an infuriated Motiejus physically chastises Tadas for his lack of gratitude. He is upset about the fact that people have to suffer for him when saving him from trouble, but he does nothing in return for them. While Janek's men search for rebels, Tadas, feeling guilty for his actions, goes back to the village and gives his dead friend a proper burial. While wandering through town, he overhears a rebel interrogation led by one of Janek's men and takes the blame on himself for inciting the rebellion. He also discloses the rebels' hiding location \u2013 the swamp. Tadas is then forced to lead Janek's men to the hiding location. The interrogated rebels are furious at Tadas for revealing their hiding spot, but he saves them by suddenly launching a successful coup de main at the swamp against the troops.\nOnce freed, however, the rebels are ungrateful and even attempt to hang Tadas for his earlier treachery. Motiejus rushes into the scene and saves him. He tells the men that Tadas was the one who incited the rebellion by starting the fire in the stables and the rebels treat him with more respect. Later, more men want to join in to rebel, but Tadas rebukes them, saying that there should not be rebellion, and that he just wants to get back to ploughing the land. Still, the rebels convince him to fight for his freedom from serfdom.\nBack in Gruinius' estate, Bernardas worries about how the world has turned \u2013 how he cannot tell his friends from his enemies anymore. He attempts to murder his steward Edmundas in his sleep, but Edmundas appears on the couch, brandishing a gun. Bernardas tries to throw a burning candle in his face, but ends up being tied up and forced to sign off his estate to him.\nIn St. Petersburg, Statesman Muravyov receives the news that Janek has successfully incited the rebellion, and immediately sends a telegraph to Rittmeister Snegiryov, instructing him to go help put down the rebellion.\nAfter securing the estate, Edmundas begins making plans with Konstancija, and Kristina chances upon both of them kissing. Feeling hurt, she rides off to the forest, where she meets Tadas. He reveals to her his plans to rebel, but Kristina warns him that the Czar's army will be there tomorrow.\nThe next day, Janek goes out to meet the Czar's army led by Rittmeister Snegiryov. As the army makes its way to Gruinius' mansion, Edmundas appears and informs Janek that Gruinius and his peasants are instigating a rebellion. Edmundas and the army continue the journey, but are stopped by Blinda, who has prepared an ambush. Edmundas attempts to run off in the confusion, but is met by two rebels. They are eventually subdued by Janek, who has become highly suspicious of Edmundas' intentions. He threatens to kill him, but Edmundas retorts that if he dies, he will not be able to reveal who killed his father Adam. Then, Tadas starts fighting Janek, and Edmundas uses that opportunity to run away. Later, Janek is seen pursuing Edmundas.\nRottmeister Snegiryov finally arrives at Gruinius' estate, wounded from the ambush. He is apparently angry with Bernardas, and tells him to bring forth Tadas Blinda or else he will have him sent off to Siberia. Bernardas starts to lose hope in the situation, but his daughter Kristina tells him that help will soon be on its way.\nBack at the rebel hideout, Tadas becomes disillusioned once more and tells everyone that if they continue to fight, they will only bring more trouble upon themselves. He doesn't want to accept his status as a rebel. Later, Tadas and Bernardas meet under a tree, and Bernardas recounts his secret that has been nagging him for fifteen years:\nIn the winter of 1846, two noblemen \u2013 Adam Razumowski and Bernardas Gruinius \u2013 went to hunt in a forest. Adam was drinking heavily when Bernardas heard the shouts of a serf kid whose brother was drowning in a creek. He rushed to save him. After dragging the kid out of the water, Bernardas saw the drunk Adam brandishing a gun, ready to shoot the unconscious boy because he thought \"Lithuanian serfs were worthless\". Protective of his serf, Bernardas tried to disarm his friend, and the first shot went into the air. Adam tried to get the second shot as the two noblemen continued to struggle with the gun, but he ended up shooting himself. Soon, the young Edmundas, who had witnessed the whole scene, appeared and told the distraught Bernardas that his secret will be safe with him. Seeing that Adam was still alive, Edmundas dumped his body into the creek.\nAt the Gruinius' estate, Edmundas, who has now been captured by Janek, reveals the secret of Adam's death, twisting the facts to portray Gruinius as a traitor who saved a rebel\u2013turned serf Tadas Blinda in place of his father Adam. Furious at receiving such news, Janek goes off to Gruinius' mansion.\nBernardas returns home only to find his servant dead, and his family held captive by Snegiryov and Janek. Snegiryov tells Bernardas that he will be sent to Siberia for helping the rebels and Janek delivers a knockout to the landowner. Then, Snegiryov threatens to shoot the unconscious Bernardas if the two captives don't tell where Tadas Blinda is hiding. Kristina does, and the army leaves.\nAfter seeing Tadas conversing with their master, the rebels become wary of him. Motiejus suspects that Tadas has switched sides. In truth, after the eye\u2013opening conversation with Bernardas, Tadas no longer believes that the masters are the enemy \u2013 rather, the invading Russian soldiers, who want an internal clash so that they would have an excuse to exercise authority over the two groups, are the adversary. He tells this to the skeptical rebels, and leaves for Gruinius' estate to fight the soldiers alone.\nThe Russian soldiers (headed by Janek and Snegiryov) meet Blinda in the battlefield. Soon, the rebels, headed by Motiejus, join Blinda, and the battle commences. After a while of fighting, the Russian soldiers retreat from the battlefield. Although both sides suffer many casualties, Blinda, Motiejus, Snegiryov and Janek survive.\nWhile the battle is going on, Edmundas sneaks into Gruinius' mansion and takes advantage of the captives. He attempts to strangulate Kristina, demanding her to tell him where they keep their money. Konstancija does, and Edmundas pushes her outside to lead him to the money. Bernardas, regaining consciousness, goes outside and finds Edmundas. Fully cognizant of the misfortune he has brought onto the family, Bernardas forcibly drowns him in a nearby swamp.\nGruinius and his family attempt to flee their estate, but they are met by the retreating Janek and Snegiryov. Janek takes Bernardas out for a sword duel, and Snegiryov carries Kristina away in a carriage. Janek wins the sword duel and is about to kill Bernardas when Tadas shows up with his sword. He subdues Janek and knocks him to the ground. As a last resort, Janek tries to shoot Tadas, but Motiejus sees this and shoots the young officer first, killing him instantly.\nBernardas takes the estate deed from Janek and gives it to Tadas, begging him to find his daughter. Tadas, in turn, gives the deed to the rebels and rides off on horseback in search of Kristina. Meanwhile, Bernardas forgives his wife for her infidelity. Snegiryov throws Kristina out of the carriage in the middle of the field, and Tadas finds her, unconscious. He initially thinks that Kristina is dead, but lets out a sigh of relief after she whispers to him.

He comes to India to find an Indian bride and get married. His parents have already short-listed some girls for him to meet, and they, along with his friend Pappi (Deepak Dobriyal) take him to Kanpur to meet Tanuja Trivedi alias Tanu (Kangana Ranaut). After they land in Kanpur, a bunch of goons grab Manu from the rail station and give him a few slaps, but when Pappi finds Manu he tells him to let it go. At Tanu's house, the two sets of parents find that they get on extremely well with each other, and decide that if Manu likes Tanu, they can finalize the matter immediately. There is one minor hitch: Tanu's mother tells her guests that Tanu has been ill since yesterday and is unable to rise from bed. She asks Manu to go up to Tanu's bedroom and meet her there. She shows Manu to Tanu's room and goes away to the kitchen. Tanu is very unresponsive, and Manu initially thinks that she is shy and bashful. He soon realizes that Tanu is in fact fast asleep. He gazes upon her beautiful sleeping figure, and promptly becomes enamored. He comes downstairs and tells both the families that he is willing to marry her.\nBefore making the engagement public, the families decide to go on a pilgrimage and seek the blessings of God. During the train journey, Tanu finds an opportunity to speak privately with Manu, and tells him that she had intentionally taken sleeping pills to fall asleep, to avoid meeting him. She tells him rudely that she loves someone else, and that she has her lover's name tattooed on her chest; she also tells him that the thugs who had roughed him up when he initially landed in Kanpur had been sent by her boyfriend. She demands that Manu should now reject her. Manu is extremely disappointed because he likes her immensely, but he dutifully does the decent thing. Taking the blame upon himself, and not revealing to anyone the fact that the girl is having a love affair with another man, he tells his father to convey to Tanu's parents that he has decided not to marry her. Tanu's parents are more than a little miffed at this turn of events, but since the forthcoming engagement was known only to them, there is no public loss of face.\nWeeks pass, and Manu's parents bring out other proposals from their shortlist for him to meet. He meets several prospective girls from suitable families, but cannot forget Tanu. One of the girls he meets is Ayushi (Neha Kaul), whose hand has become crooked due to some problem. While the two families are sitting together, Ayushi's brother Raja (Jimmy Sheirgill) comes home, bloodied and disheveled. His father expresses frustration that Raja keeps getting in fights. Later on the roof, Raja and Manu have a conversation where Raja advises Manu to marry his sister despite the condition of her hand as it does not stop her from doing her works properly, and it will heal with proper treatment anyway. Manu agrees that Ayushi is very nice but says he is 'helpless' and cannot marry her. Raja understands something is amiss and respects Manu for being honest.\nLater at home Manu declares he would rather not get married now, and expresses his wish to leave for London. But Pappi informs him about the wedding of another school friend Jassi (Eijaz Khan) and they travel to Punjab to attend it. Upon arriving, Manu finds out that Tanu is also attending the wedding, and that she is a friend of Payal (Swara Bhaskar), Jassi's bride-to-be. Jassi and Pappi advise Manu to try and win her over. Over the next few days, Manu and Tanu strike up a friendship. Tanu still has the boyfriend but enjoys Manu's attention, and when Manu inquires about her boyfriend she jokes that for her any guy (or even girl) would do as long as it is not her father's choice. Manu is encouraged. But someone else at the wedding is also crushing on Tanu, and seeing her and Manu spending time together he calls Tanu's parents with the intention of worrying them about a scandal. Jassi called and invited Manu's parents and incidentally both sets of parents arrive at the same time. Tanu thinks that Manu has called them up and is trying to reestablish their cancelled wedding connection. She is upset. This causes tension among her, Manu, Jassi and Payal; feeling guilty, Manu decides to leave. But Tanu comes to the rail station to stop him and tells him she is on the verge of eloping, that she and her lover are going to get secretly married in a registry office, and then present her parents with a fait accompli. She asks him to stay till the wedding.\nManu is heartbroken. As Pappi and he leave on a train back to Chandigarh, they meet Raja again, and after explaining to Raja how Manu is in love with someone, Raja states they will all go back to Kanpur and promises Manu he will marry him to any girl he falls in love with. Jassi also calls and tells Manu that he will not marry without him being present. As Manu and Pappi reach Jassi's \"baraat\", Manu receives a call from Raja, revealing that Raja is Tanu's boyfriend. Despite Pappi chiding him for it, Manu goes to the registrar's office to be a witness to Raja and Tanu's marriage. The man who is supposed to marry them is busy on the phone and when they are not able to find a pen to sign the papers the man says it is late anyway and they should come back tomorrow for their marriage. While going back, Raja tells Manu that he does not want to be married in this stealthy way, but Tanu's family would never accept him as nobody would recommend him to them properly. Hearing this, Manu later talks to Tanu's father, and convinces him to accept Raja. Tanu's father accepts somewhat unwillingly, and wonders out loud why Manu is doing this. He and Tanu's mother would prefer Manu as their son in law and had been delighted when they got the call about Manu and Tanu being together.\nTanu is scolded by Payal. She accuses Tanu for not being entirely happy with not having to elope- there is no novelty in a proper arranged marriage- not being grateful enough to Manu and not being able to see his love for her. Preparations for Tanu's wedding with Raja begin.  The wedding gift from Manu is a large poster, a collage of numerous photographs of Tanu in her various moods and poses, which Manu had snapped on various occasions, including the one of the first time Manu saw her. Tanu is touched. Later, Raja does not have the time to buy Tanu a wedding lehenga as he has to be somewhere else urgently, so he asks Manu to help him out. It is painful for Manu, but he goes with Tanu to shop for her bridal outfit. While coming back, Tanu asks him whether he actually had a pen with him at the registrar's office. Manu confesses that he did, and lied about not having one like an idiot because he didn't want her to marry Raja. He also talks about his lonely life in London, how he fell in love with Tanu at first sight and how however much he tried to stay away from her it didn't work. Meanwhile, one of the goons who beat Manu up on behalf of Raja has noticed them together in the jeep, recognized him and called Raja. Raja appears, and it is unclear how much of the conversation he has heard, but he takes Tanu away.\nRaja and Tanu have a fight. Tanu confesses she has feelings for Manu. Raja is angry, and demands Tanu still marries him as, a few months of fulfilling her wifely duties will make her forget everything.\nRaja drops Tanu home. She is torn and emotional, and pulling Manu aside she demands to clearly know whether he loves her or not. She will only believe it if Manu puts his palm on her cheek and professes his love. Manu does so. Tanu, relieved and elated, decides to marry Manu, not Raja.\nTanu's parents rejoice at this turn of events. Manu's parents are also on board with this alliance. But when everyone goes to Raja's place to cancel Tanu's wedding with him, a furious Raja threaten them with a gun and warns of dire consequences if Tanu is married to anyone other than him. He promises he will come to marry Tanu at due time. Everyone comes back worried but Manu is adamant on his wedding with Tanu taking place. Tanu's father bribes an Inspector of Police as per the instruction of Pappi and Jassi, and gets Raja arrested on false charges. The plan is that Raja will remain in jail for a few days, during which time Tanu will be married and safely sent away. However, everyone is shocked to see that Raja is arriving with a wedding procession as promised, at the wedding venue at the same time as Manu, the bridegroom. Raja brandishes a gun and creates a scene. Manu however refuses to be scared and begins reasoning with Raja. Meanwhile, Tanu appears at the door, dressed as a bride, and tells Raja she would only be scared for Manu and as he is not scared, she is not either. The two of them begin to walk away together. Raja aims the gun and almost pulls the trigger, but thinks better of it in the end. He says no one wants him to marry Tanu, not even his mother has given him her blessings for it. He then reminds Manu of the promise he had made to him, and he decides to honor his promise, and tells Tanu he might be many things, but he is not a betrayer. Thus Raja decides to do the right thing, and congratulates the couple with quiet pain evident on his face.

However, when Maya arranges a meeting between them, things don't seem to work out because Sanjana happens to rubbish away Kishen's accusations against Raj. This compels Kishen to try exposing Raj by calling all his girlfriends to the New Year's Eve party, but Kishen's plan goes haywire when Vikram steps in and saves Raj.\nConfused to the next day, Raj and Vikram suspect a spy being part of the scandal that was about to occur last night and seek help from friend and Canadian Security Intelligence Service agent KD, who instead suggests hiring a private detective as the matter is too trivial and unprofessional for an intelligence agency to handle. However, as fate would have it, they land up at Kishen's place, and, having recognized him from the party, enlist his help. Kishen, who is apparently crushing on Sanjana, decides to engage Raj and Vikram in a double game, which results in the duo mistakenly assuming Yogi as the informer after Kishen shows them a doctored video of Yogi conversing with Sanjana, and ceasing their friendship with him by exposing him on one of his cheat dates. Later that day, he creates a fracas for Raj by nearly exposing him as a cheater when he is caught in a bathing robe, but Vikram again comes up with an idea, this time about having Raj pose as an undercover cop in the CSIS, who was unintentionally exposed during a \"mission\" for KD, who played his boss, and was responsible for killing dreaded don King's brother.

At a rural bar, he challenges Captain Rochefort, leader of Cardinal Richelieu's guard, to a duel after being insulted by him, but Rochefort merely shoots him while he's distracted. Once in Paris, d'Artagnan separately encounters Athos, Porthos and Aramis and, accidentally offending all three, schedules separate duels with each. Athos brings Porthos and Aramis to the duel as his seconds, causing d'Artagnan to realise their true identities. Richelieu's guards arrive to apprehend them, but, inspired by d'Artagnan, the musketeers fight together and win. All four are summoned before the young King Louis XIII and Richelieu urges him to execute them, but Queen Anne is impressed by their bravery and the king decorates them instead.\nRichelieu instructs Milady, now his accomplice, to plant false love letters among Queen Anne's possessions, steal her diamond necklace, and take it to the Tower of London in order to frame her as having an affair with Buckingham, which would force King Louis to execute her and declare war on England. At this point, the people would demand a more experienced leader: Richelieu himself. In order to secure her own position, Milady demands that Richelieu declare in a written authorisation that she is working on behalf of France.\nThe false letters are found and given to King Louis, who is advised by Richelieu to set up a ball at which Queen Anne would be forced to wear the necklace. If she doesn't, then her affair is real, and there will be war. Queen Anne's lady-in-waiting Constance Bonacieux discovers Richelieu's plan and pleads with the musketeers to stop him.

D'Artagnan is captured, but he is in fact acting as a decoy following the plan Milady would have expected the Musketeers to follow, allowing his associates to hijack Buckingham's airship and rescue him. Milady's getaway coachman reveals himself as the musketeers' manservant Planchet and delivers her to his masters, who retrieve the necklace from her. Athos prepares to execute Milady for her treachery, but she leaps off the airship, seemingly dying on her own terms.\nThe musketeers depart back to Paris, only to be intercepted by Rochefort in a much larger airship, for Milady had given Richelieu copies of da Vinci's blueprints. Rochefort offers to exchange Constance for the necklace, but captures d'Artagnan and mounts an assault as soon as he retrieves the jewels. His superior airship has the upper hand and severely damages the opposing vessel, but the musketeers use the clouds to rally and counterattack. The fight ends when both ships ram each other, crashing onto Notre Dame. On the roof, d'Artagnan challenges and ultimately kills Rochefort, recovering the necklace in the process. Constance is sent ahead to quietly return the necklace to Queen Anne.

Offended, Tomie decides to leave but is prevented from doing so when her father stabs and kills her with a butcher knife.\nThe next morning, Tsukiko witnesses Kimiko dismembering Tomie's body in the bathroom. Kimiko then disposes of Tomie's head by throwing it away in the trash bin and goes to prepare Tsukiko's school lunch, accidentally dropping several chunks of Tomie's flesh and hair in it. At school, Tsukiko notices a girl who looks exactly like her dead stepsister walk into class. Later on, during lunch break, Tsukiko opens her lunch pack and sees several miniature Tomie heads in it. She runs off and throws the lunch pack into the trash. When Yoshie goes to look for Tsukiko, she hears noises in the trash and leans over to investigate. Suddenly, the miniature Tomie heads appear and strangle Yoshie with their abnormally long tongues, killing her.\nMeanwhile, at home, Tomie's head rises from the trash bin and convinces her father to kill his wife and feed her body to her. Back at school, Tsukiko encounters Yoshie with a tumor on her neck similar to the one Tomie had and runs off in panic. When Yoshie enters the Judo club's room while looking for Tsukiko, she is decapitated by the members who mistook her head for the tumor's. Her headless body comes back to life and starts chasing the Judo club members. Tsukiko then walks into Toshio, witnessing him stab a Tomie to death, and a new Tomie forms out of the blood and begins kissing Toshio. Tsukiko kills Toshio and runs off into a locker room and encounters several versions of Tomie.\nJust as she is about to be cornered by the Tomies, she wakes up in her bed. Her parents inform her that she is an only child and that she never had a sister when she asks about Tomie. Tsukiko sighs in relief, believing she just had a bad nightmare which proves to be false when her father starts eating hair and her mother's head suddenly stretches abnormally to the point where it appears to be upside down. Her mother chases her with a knife but is attacked by a carnivorous centipede made out of Tomie's heads. Tsukiko runs upstairs and encounters Toshio and Yoshie who tell her that they never liked her and were pretending to be her friends all along. She pushes them down the stairs and they are both attacked by the centipedes. Tsukiko then encounters a huge giant Tomie head in her living room, and after a brief conversation, the sisters reconcile, and the Tomie centipedes begin crawling over her.\nThe movie ends has Tsukiko is shown walking out of the house, having become another Tomie. As she walks through the streets of Japan, she observes other women she passes by, many of them also being Tomie. She walks up to a man, smiling, and is then shown being murdered by him in an apartment. Lying on the floor, she looks at a mirror, retaining some degree of her original personality.

The film starts with clips of news reports about the mortgage industry crisis and the forced sale of the troubled Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase, with Fed guarantees.\nWith Bear Stearns out of the picture, short sellers have turned their attention on Lehman Brothers. In need of capital, CEO Dick Fuld reluctantly fires COO Joe Gregory and CFO Erin Callan, naming Bart McDade as the new president and COO. McDade begins to successfully negotiate a deal with Korean investors, hinging on the condition that Lehman's toxic real estate is excluded. The deal falls through, however, when Fuld's pride gets the best of him and he tries to coerce the Koreans into accepting the real estate assets.\nPaulson is adamant that the government will not subsidize any more acquisitions, but it becomes clear the most promising buyer for Lehman, Bank of America, is uninterested without Fed involvement. Paulson and President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Timothy Geithner gather the leaders of the biggest banks, including Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, and Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack, to convince them to underwrite the deal themselves. During a break in negotiations, another threatened firm, Merrill Lynch, approaches Bank of America to buy them instead, which Paulson tacitly okays. With Bank of America purchasing Merrill Lynch, the only other buyer is British firm Barclays, but their involvement is blocked by British banking regulators. Lehman collapses and is forced into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, insurance firm AIG also begins to fail.\nLehman's collapse affects the entire financial market, and the stock market goes into freefall. Blankfein, Mack, and General Electric CEO Jeffrey Immelt inform Paulson they are unable to do business, and French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde warns him that he must not allow AIG to fail, as the crisis is affecting Europe as well. Unlike Lehman, the Treasury rescues AIG with an $85 billion loan.\nBernanke argues that the Congress must pass legislation to authorize any continued intervention by the Fed or the Treasury. With the availability of credit drying up, Paulson's plan is to buy the toxic assets from the banks to take the risk off their books and increase their cash reserves. Bernanke and Paulson lobby Congress, with Bernanke emphasizing the potential of fallout worse than the Great Depression if they fail to act. The committee of representatives appear close to agreeing, when U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate John McCain, with great fanfare, announces that he is suspending his campaign and returning to Washington to work on the legislation, polarizing the Republicans and Democrats on the issue.  Paulson has to threaten McCain not to interfere and beg the Democrats, led by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, not to back away from the negotiations. After a wave of panic and personal haranguing from President George W. Bush, the legislation passes on a second attempt and the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) is created.\nPaulson's team realizes that buying toxic assets will take too long, leaving direct capital injections to the banks as their only option to use TARP to get credit flowing again. Along with FDIC Chair Sheila Bair, Paulson informs the banks that they will receive mandatory capital injections. The banks eventually agree, but Paulson's staff laments that the parties who caused the crisis are being allowed to dictate the terms of how they should use the billions with which they are being bailed out. In private conference, Bernanke and Paulson lament that, although the intent of TARP is for the banks to use the loan money to restore credit for ordinary consumers, the legislation stops short of forcing them to do so.\nAn epilogue notes that the banks did not, in fact, use the loan money as intended, but instead returned it at their earliest opportunity, and the stock market still crashed and was followed by a rash of home foreclosures.  Nevertheless, bank mergers continued in the wake of the crisis, and now only ten financial institutions hold 77% of all U.S. banking assets and have been declared too big to fail.", "tmdb_plot": "An intimate look at the epochal financial crisis of 2008 and the powerful men and women who decided the fate of the world's economy in a matter of a few weeks.", "tmdb_id": "65034", "wiki_id": "27810619"}, {"title": "Toomelah", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Daniel is a ten-year-old boy living in Toomelah, NSW.

Lucifer mocks God for the shortcomings of humanity, which he predicts will soon aspire to become God. As the primaeval spirit of negation, he claims to be as old as God and demands his share of the world, which he is granted in the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Immortality.\nLucifer tempts Adam and Eve eat the forbidden fruit. Expelled from the Garden of Eden and abandoned by God, Adam reasons that he is no longer obliged to show God any gratitude. He decides to live from his own strength alone. Lucifer offers Adam to experience his own future, and takes him from the Stone Age into the future, throughout human history.\nIn ancient Egypt, Adam is Pharaoh Djoser in 2650 BC who falls in love with Eve in the form of a slave woman. Adam abolishes slavery, but Lucifer argues that it would be futile, as history would prove. Adam is taken to ancient Greece, where democracy has resulted in corruption and foul political play. Adam appears as Miltiades in 489 BC and is sentenced to death after the masses have been agitated against him. Disillusioned, Adam is taken to ancient Rome in 67 AD where he and Lucifer enjoy themselves with gladiator games and prostitutes. As decadence makes the civilization fall apart, Adam and Eve encounter Saint Peter and then Jesus, and turn to God, who gives them a message of love and fraternity. Adam becomes Tancred, Prince of Galilee in 1096 AD but is disgusted by the East\u2013West Schism and pettiness within the church. He falls in love with Eve who is locked inside a monastery.\nAdam is then Johannes Kepler in Prague, 1608. He seeks eternal wisdom by studying the physical world while his wife is unfaithful. Adam becomes Georges Danton during the French Revolution in Paris, 1794. Eve appears as an aristocrat who is guillotined and as a prostitute who revels in the revolutionary terror. Danton is eventually put before the National Convention and executed for conspiring with the aristocracy. Once again in the body of Kepler, Adam wakes up from a dream. He recognizes that ideas are more powerful and long-lasting than individual men. Adam and Lucifer visit Victorian London in 1897 as unnamed Englishmen, which Adam initially finds impressive but Lucifer argues is decayed on a spiritual level, as everything has become a commodity. Adam tries to court Eve and is eventually able to seduce her, right after World War I, with the help of jewels and a Gypsy fortune-teller. When social unrest erupts in the 20th century, Adam wishes for a society ruled after scientific principles for the common good.\nLucifer brings Adam to a future egalitarianist world state. Although initially positive, Adam immediately regrets the disappearance of nations, as he thinks people should have a past and an identity to hold on to. Animals and plants which are not useful are extinct and the useful ones have been genetically modified. Adam questions the materialist worldview and is arrested for criminal thinking. Eve appears as a mother who is punished for refusing to let society educate her child. Adam and Lucifer travel further to a dehumanized future in space. Adam is at first unsettled, but when the spirit of Earth urges him to return, he proclaims that his spirit can live beyond the body. On the verge of annihilation, Adam changes his mind and promises to keep striving on Earth. He accepts mortality and man's struggle.\nIn a distant ice age, the last remains of humanity are dying. The few people Adam encounters are deformed savages. Lucifer argues that they do not differ in nature from humans of any other era.\nAdam wakes up in his cave 50,000 BC. He joins Lucifer on a cliff, where he argues for the existence of free will, while Lucifer reminds him of the futility of human ambition. Adam argues that he can still go against God by committing suicide. As he is about to leap from the cliff, Eve finds him and tells him that she is pregnant. God urges Adam to keep having faith.

Despite the charming facade, it is immediately clear that the family is dysfunctional and emotionally distant: Avery disrespects her parents and, despite being forbidden to do so, sneaks out of the house to go to a party with her friend Kendra, at the home of a guy named Jake. Sarah appears bored with life as a housewife and yearns for more in her marriage while Kyle seems to harbor a hidden aversion towards his wife. Just as Kyle is about to leave for a business transaction, the house is suddenly invaded by a gang of robbers masquerading as police.\nThe thieves - consisting of leader Elias (Ben Mendelsohn) his stripper girlfriend Petal (Jordana Spiro), his younger brother Jonah (Cam Gigandet) and a large intimidating man named Ty (Dash Mihok) - tell Kyle and Sarah that they have been spying on them for some time and are aware of the large amounts of cash and diamonds hidden in their home. They command Kyle to open a safe hidden in the wall but, despite the threat of a syringe containing lethal injection chemicals, he defiantly refuses, believing that he and Sarah will be killed if he simply gives in to their demands. Meanwhile, Sarah recognizes Jonah through his mask. Through a series of Jonah's flashbacks and a conversation with Elias, it is strongly implied that Sarah and Jonah had a previous affair when the latter was employed as a technician to install the house's security system. Unbeknownst to Elias, Sarah secretly steals the syringe from him during this conversation.\nHaving left her party in disgust (after the host Jake clumsily attempted to seduce her), Avery returns home and, after a brief chase, is also captured and taken to her parents. Elias appeals to Kyle, claiming that he needs money to pay for a kidney transplantation for his dying mother and that, if Kyle refuses to comply, he will instead take one of Avery's kidneys. Sarah catches Elias off-guard and holds him hostage with the syringe. Forced into a Mexican standoff, the thieves compromise by letting Avery escape in exchange for Kyle opening the safe. He does so, revealing it to be completely empty. Kyle explains that he is actually bankrupt and has no money; his house and all of his possessions were bought on loaned credit. Enraged, Elias breaks Kyle's hand and instead demands material compensation by taking Sarah's prized diamond necklace. However, Kyle reveals that this is a completely worthless cubic zirconia replica. Ty recaptures Avery from outside and brings her back into the house. Kyle volunteers for his own kidney to be taken instead of his daughter's, but Elias reveals that it was a ploy and that he hated his mother, who is already dead. Ty grows impatient after receiving a phone call and commands Elias to hurry up; Kyle realizes that the burglars are themselves being coerced into committing the heist against their will.\nThe thieves then separate the Miller family, with Kyle and Avery being tied up and guarded in the living room and Sarah being pursued by Jonah in the kitchen. Jonah states to Sarah that he still loves her and promises that she and Avery will be left unhurt. Meanwhile, Kyle uses a lighter to burn both his own and Avery's binds; they attempt an escape and set off the house's security system. Kyle ends up in a struggle with Ty and, despite Ty's superior strength and fighting skills, Kyle manages to inject a portion of the syringe chemicals into his arm, causing him to fall unconscious.\nThinking that Ty is dead, Elias shoots Kyle in the leg and reveals his true motives; that he is a drug dealer working for an organized crime syndicate. Shortly after being given a job to sell $180,000 worth of drugs, Elias and Petal were carjacked at gunpoint and all of their shipments were promptly stolen. Faced with threats of retribution, Elias was then forced to commit a heist (under the supervision of henchman Ty) to pay off his debt.

Under the threat of her parents being killed, she is forced to answer a call from the security company and successfully convinces them to call off the police. However, a security guard shows up nevertheless, prompting Jonah to kill him, when said guard recognizes Jonah as a former employee.\nKyle reveals to Elias that the only thing of any worth on him is his life insurance. Desperate and out of options, Elias kicks Kyle down and prepares to kill him. At the last second, Avery remembers the money she saw at the earlier party and pleads with the thieves that she can help them steal it from the party if they spare her father's life. Elias reluctantly agrees to the proposition and sends Petal to supervise Avery as she drives to the party house and ensure that she keeps her word (during a conversation between Elias and Petal it is revealed their daughter was taken into foster care). Although Avery's initial idea is to seduce Jake and then steal his money, she is horrified when Petal begins to deliriously proclaim that she plans to massacre all of the party guests and then take the cash. Seeing a swerving road ahead, Avery accelerates the car, unbuckles Petal's seat belt, and intentionally crashes into a telephone pole, incapacitating Petal and allowing Avery to handcuff Petal to the steering wheel.\nBack at the Miller home, Sarah learns that Kyle had discovered a picture of her kissing Jonah from security footage and was suspicious for some time that she had been unfaithful. However, Sarah insists that she is innocent and only loves Kyle; the same flashback is now shown from her perspective, revealing that Jonah is in fact mentally ill (and off his medications) and that the supposed love affair between him and Sarah was all in his head. The \"kiss\" had occurred to Sarah's complete surprise and against her will. At this point, Ty reawakens from his stupor and attacks Sarah. Enraged, Jonah tackles Ty and the two fight. Just as Ty is about to strangle Jonah to death, Elias shoots him in the back for trying to kill his brother. However, in his dying breath, Ty reveals to Elias that he had been set up all along: the \"robbers\" stealing his drug shipment were actually fellow members of the same crime organization and the operation was done in order to blackmail him into stealing more money for them. More damningly, Ty also claims that Jonah had masterminded the entire plan so he could have an excuse to return to the Miller residence and profess his love to Sarah. Elias is shocked by the allegations but refuses to believe them (though doubt about his brother does seem to creep in).\nThrough the chaos, Sarah and a wounded Kyle escape to the tool shed behind the house and are pursued by Elias and Jonah. After a brief fight, the thieves break through a partition in their tussling and to their surprise discover a large amount of money that's been hidden in the shed; Kyle reveals that he had sold Sarah's real diamond necklace and was saving the money as a nest egg for his family when he noticed his business/fortunes declining. As Elias and Jonah begin to collect the cash, Avery appears (having survived the car crash with minor injuries) and points a gun at them. Elias calls her bluff and claims she can shoot but he will still have time to shoot one of her parents, he then aims his gun at Sarah - but he is shot from behind and killed by Jonah for this. Jonah tries again to convince Sarah that she belongs with him but she rebuffs his offers, calling him insane. In an attempt to sacrifice himself, Kyle tells his wife and daughter to run while setting the money in the tool shed on fire. He also shoots Jonah's foot with a nail gun, trapping him in the shed. While Avery goes to call the police, Sarah tries to help Kyle but she is grabbed in a last-ditch effort by Jonah, who is convinced that it is destiny for her to die together with him in the fire. However, Kyle then shoots him in the neck, causing him to fall and become engulfed in the flames. Sarah then carries Kyle away to safety just as the shed collapses.\nIn the backyard, Kyle tries to tell Sarah to let him die so that she and Avery can survive on his life insurance fund but she refuses, stating that she loves him regardless of whether he has money or not.

However, the government suddenly goes cold on the plan, and it does not tell the public why. There is also talk of homeless people who use the tunnel as shelter going missing. This and the silence from the ministers leads a journalist, Natasha, to begin an investigation into a government cover-up. She and her crew Peter (producer), Steven (camera operator), and Tangles (audio engineer) decide to investigate the story and plan to enter the tunnels themselves. After being refused entry by a security guard, they find an alternate entry and make their way inside. They proceed to explore the tunnels and locate various abandoned homeless squats and sections used as air raid shelters in the 1940s.\nThey come upon a huge underground lake; and, while filming, Tangles hears strange noises through the audio headphones. Later, the group heads to the room where the World War II air raid bell is. To get footage of the bell's ringing, Natasha hits it; but Tangles says the sound's loudness is distorting the audio recording. He decides to take the boom-mike into an adjoining room to reduce the sound levels, leaving Peter with the headphones to listen for distortion in the bell volume. Natasha hits it again, and Peter hears something very disturbing in the headphones. Tangles' audio cable is suddenly pulled through the opening, snapping and disappearing. The rest of the crew panics and goes to look for Tangles.\nThe scene switches to the interview, where Natasha is allowed to hear this recording for the first time. As the sound of the bell plays, screams of agony can be clearly heard before the headphone wire snaps. Upon going back to the bell room minutes after they left, the crew finds that all their equipment has disappeared. While searching for Tangles, they find a room blocked off by corrugated metal. Natasha puts down her night-vision camera to help Peter and Steve. They get into the room and are horrified to find large amounts of still dripping blood, as well as Tangles' abandoned torch. At the entrance of the room, Natasha picks up the camera, noticing that it is not where she had left it. Reviewing the footage, it is revealed that something picked up the camera and is stalking them.\nThe crew ventures through the tunnel, trying to find a way out. They hear a person call down to them, and they come upon the security guard who had earlier refused them entry. The group tell him that one of their crew has gone missing, but the guard instead tells them to quickly follow him and get out, ignoring their pleas to help them find Tangles. Something pounces on the guard as he nears a corner, dragging him out of sight into another tunnel with incredible speed. The group flees, screaming in terror through the narrow tunnels. They hide in a room and stay there until they believe whatever the thing that grabbed the security guard has left the immediate surroundings. In an attempt to find a way out, they soon return to the underground lake. Hearing something nearby, they extinguish all light and use the night-vision camera to look toward the sound. There, they discover the security guard, his eyes missing, whimpering in pain in the shallows of the lake. The crew watches in horror as a tall, emaciated, demonic humanoid appears behind him and brutally murders him, slowly twisting his head until his neck breaks. Natasha lets out a scream, attracting the creature's attention; and the terrified group runs with the monster almost immediately giving chase after them.\nThey come to a dead-end with a barred opening into a street above them (which Natasha screams up into for help), but when that fails, the group continues searching for an exit. At one point, the creature attempts to grab Peter from an opening; however, when Steven shines the camera's light on it, the monster immediately retreats. Steven realizes that the beast is vulnerable to or afraid of light. Upon reaching another dead-end, Natasha discovers a side route blocked by planks of wood. Entering this new room, they find signs of some living being, as well as a small pile of human flesh. The main camera loses power, and Steve frantically attempts to replace the battery. Just as the power switches the light on again, the monster attacks, knocking Peter and Steven to the ground. Natasha, panic-stricken, runs off with the night-vision camera. On her own, she stays in silence but is confronted by the monster, who cracks the camera lens as it grabs at her, dragging her as the small camera still records. Steven and Peter follow the sound of her screams and the monster's movements.\nThrough the night-vision camera, it is shown that Natasha was dragged back to the lake. The monster attempts to drown Natasha; but before it can succeed, Steven and Peter use the light to chase it away. As Steven helps Natasha, Peter is heard in the distance screaming and challenging the monster, drawing it away from the other two. Steven manages to drag Natasha to a well-lit tunnel near a train station. They rush back and drag a badly-wounded Peter to the safety of the train platform. There, captured on CCTV, Natasha begs for help, and uses a borrowed cell phone to call the emergency services.

Bobby invites Hall to his home, which contains a miniature model of a machine that would drive a stake into a vampire's heart. Hall is informed that Bobby believes that the machine would be good in the story, which he wants to name The Vampire Executions.

He tells John that the diseased house will keep her spirit alive as long as he can bring her souls that she can feed upon. If she is fed, she will live at night and be able to manipulate and control animals. John takes Charlotte and places her in the grave outside.

The police are called. An identical box is also found in a park. Amputated male arms are found in the boxes, and the case is put onto Senior Inspector J. Krishnan, known as J.K. (Cheran), of the CB-CID. He is a brooding ex-cop who shifted to the CB-CID from law and enforcement and at present is searching for his sister Charu (Ineya), who disappeared six months prior. Prakash (Shankar) and Tamilselvi (Dipa Shah) are two junior officers who are put onto the case to assist J.K.. At the morgue, they meet Judas Iscariot (Jayaprakash), a medical examiner, to investigate the hands. Judas, mildly esoteric, often draws parallels between J.K. and Jiddu Krishnamurthi. J.K. is able to identify one pair of hands as belonging to auto driver Moorthy and follows the lead. Through a local goon named Surendra, they single out a middleman named Rajamanickam.

However, everyone questioned has only nice things to say about the family, while Manikandan is said to be a petty thief and a scoundrel. It is discovered that Manikandan has been missing since November, having disappeared around the same time as John Britto himself.\nNow we are introduced to a mysterious green Qualis, which prevents an autorickshaw driver from kidnapping a drugged woman and abducts him instead.\nTamilselvi, while looking at old case records of the Purushothaman case, finds that Purushothaman had a daughter named Suja (Srushti Dange) who disappeared on the same day as Charu \u2013 September 6. J.K. investigates the Purushothaman family's house, and later goes to a dodgy inspector who handled the Purushothaman case, Isakki Muthu (G. Marimuthu), for details. J.K. prods Isakki to give him details about Duraipandi (Manikka Vinayagam), a textile shop owner and influential businessman who was accused of peeping at girls in the change room of his shop through a hole in his office (one of whom was Suja). J.K. interviews Duraipandi, who was able to get off after his manager Nadhamani took the blame. J.K. is unfazed and undeterred by what Duraipandi has to say and concludes the case is showing resemblances of having the Rashomon effect.

He is able to get a major lead when he finds that there were two people in the auto rickshaw that took Suja from her dance class. The same is established for his sister's disappearance.\nWe then find that ACP Thirisangu (Selva), Isakki Muthu, Duraipandi, Sharif, Inba (Yugendran), Raghu's murderer, and the missing men \u2013 Nagu, Moorthy, and Rajamanickam - are in cahoots. Thirisangu arranges for Sharif and a few men to deal with J.K. and keep his nose out of their business. In the midst of the ensuing fistfight, Sharif is kidnapped by the same Qualis. J.K. deals with the men, and Sharif is tortured and executed (but not before he names a few men).\nA new box with the autorickshaw driver's severed arms appears in a club used by two of the named men, and Sharif's head is found outside Isakki Muthu's police station, minus its eyelids. J.K. triangulates all misdeeds to ACP Thirisangu and Isakki Muthu, as all the severed body parts were found in areas under the ACP's jurisdiction (notwithstanding the fact that the Purushothaman family's cases were handled and closed by Isakki Muthu himself), but his boss Chandramouli (Aadukalam Naren) refuses to have the officers questioned, fearing higher pressure. Unable to take any further action, J.K. requests a gun permit.\nIt is also revealed that Charu is being held captive by Thirisangu. It is discovered she is the woman from the first scene. Although he regrets having kidnapped her, he plans to use her for later. Then, the Qualis appears again and tries to kidnap Isakki, but it is forced to flee when J.K. intervenes. Chasing the Qualis to a darkened underground car park, J.K. and Tamilselvi very nearly corner the Qualis, only for it to broadside their car and make good its escape. Tamilselvi is wounded in the accident; when she comes to at a hospital, she reveals to J.K. and Prakash that there were two black-clad people in the Qualis, both with shaven heads (one of whom was a woman). After rescuing Isakki Muthu, Thirisangu realizes that someone is looking for revenge for Purushothaman's death, and with the help of Purushothaman's ex-classmate, finds out whom. Both Thirisangu and J.K. then understand that the Purushothaman family may not actually be dead (J.K. concluding so when he finds the air-conditioning unit grill in the Purushothaman family bedroom to be tampered with from the outside, and when he learns that three corpses with age ranges and physical characteristics consistent with those of Purushothaman, Annapoorni and their son Nishanth went missing from the morgue where Judas worked at about the same time as the family's \"suicide\"). At a party, Judas comes in and tells Duraipandi & Co. (the men named by Sharif) that he is willing to sell information about their activities. He leads them to a van wherein they are gassed and knocked out, but as they are leaving, a shootout takes place between Thirisangu, J.K., and their comrades, in which Judas dies after confessing.\nJudas says that he is the only one who must confess, as the Purushothaman family will never speak again; the reason he helped the Purushothamans in their grisly deeds was one of pure friendship, love and gratitude, because the doctor (who was also his classmate at Vellore CMC) managed to keep Judas' daughter alive for four years before she finally succumbed to a heart condition. Judas' friendship with the Purushothaman family was so strong, that Suja was like a daughter to Judas.\nThirisangu & Co. are revealed to be running a racket which involves kidnapping and drugging virgin girls, who are then stripped naked and raped before Duraipandi and his friends (all wealthy men in their late 50s and early 60s who are impotent), in return for a huge sum of money. Suja (Srushti Dange) is one such victim (the girl in the auto), apparently having been abducted as revenge for what Duraipandi perceived as public humiliation at the hands of her family. It is during her kidnapping that Charu is also apprehended. Somehow, Suja manages to return home three days after her disappearance. Unable to bear the trauma of the rape, she commits suicide the next morning. Her parents, brother Nishanth and Judas decide to take revenge on all those responsible. They fake their deaths after meticulous planning. Two months after they successfully fake their own suicides, kidnap Britto and the peon Manikandan, and make them confess. Later, auto rickshaw drivers Nagu and Moorthy (as well as Rajamanickam) were kidnapped, tortured, and then had their arms severed.\nThe boy Nishanth (Sunil Choudhary) is caught in the fracas and taken into custody by the police. J.K. receives a call from Inba, who wants to trade Charu for Nishanth. Chandramouli blatantly refuses to do so. However, his subordinates - Prakash, Tamilselvi, and Constable Kittappa (E. Ramdoss) - bring Nishanth to J.K. at the cost of their jobs. Nishanth reveals the location of his parents to be the old Palaniappan Mills. Both parties head there; another shootout occurs. Nishanth is caught by Isakki Muthu but is distracted by the arrival of Duraipandi & Co. (all of whom have had their eyes gouged out), and also Britto and Manikandan, both with their tongues cut off. Isakki Muthu manages to wound Purushothaman with one bullet and tries to finish him off, but before he can do so, Annapoorni rushes out and stabs him in the head, killing him instantly. The couple continues their onslaught, killing Inba and the rest of the gang; although Thirisangu keeps pumping round after round into the duo, his bullets merely slow them down somewhat. Finally, Thirisangu arrives with Charu. Seeing her as their daughter Suja and this as a chance to save her life, they sacrifice themselves for her as J.K. kills Thirisangu.\nDuraipandi is sentenced to 13 years prison. The others are sentenced to seven years each, with the exception of Britto and Manikandan, who are given three years each. Nishanth is asked to be produced in court by the police, but J.K. covertly sends him abroad under the alias of Mahesh Muthuswamy, giving him Viktor Frankl's Man's Search for Meaning, asking him to search for the meaning of his parents' sacrifice.

He then finds his mother's grave in a piece of land near the beach and starts digging for her remains to give her a proper burial. When he finds out that his father's new family is planning to sell the land, he goes all out to prevent this from happening.\nWhen Bakar learns that Aidil is also back in town, he becomes nervous since he fears his younger brother will come to claim his share of the land. Jolok (Hushairy Hussain), the local don agrees to help Bakar take control of the land as long as they can become business partners. Bakar arranges for Jolok to visit his father with a business proposition, all while pretending to not know the man. However, Pok Engs senses Jolok's real intentions and sends him away, claiming the land is merely in his name but is not actually his. Regardless, Bakar hires local thugs to dig out the graves. Ilham follows the thugs into the swamp and kills them, but is injured in the process. He is then rescued by the same woman Aidil encountered earlier in his hallucinations.\nPart of the land is now the site of Pok Wah's fight club, who received it from Aidil's mother while she taught him traditional medicines. Awang Sonar (Soffi Jikan), who is Pok Wah's partner, owes Bakar money. Jolok pays of Awang's debts and now Awang has to repay him with the land. They then organize a match with Aidil against a fighter from Bachok District. Aidil wins the match easily but the money is still not enough to repay Awang's debt.\nIlham and Aidil finally come face to face on their father's land. Ilham almost kills his own brother, albeit reluctantly, but is stopped by Pok Wah. While tending to their wounds, Pok Wah and Jing reveal that contrary to popular belief, Aidil was not born to Mek Na but was born to both Pok Eng and Mek Yah after their divorce, making him an illegitimate child. Ilham starts to have a change of heart when he learns Aidil was born to his own mother and is thus, his biological brother. Finally realizing why Mek Na despised him, he promises to return home to his father for good after one last fight to help Pok Wah and Awang pay off their debts to Jolok and Bakar. Meanwhile, Pok Eng is visited by the spirit lady that appeared before both Aidil and Ilham before. She turns out to be their biological mother, Mek Yah, who is now a guardian spirit of the land. She asks Pok Eng to come with her to her realm, but he refuses, saying that he is not done raising their sons properly and can only join her once his duty is completed.\nBefore the final fight, Bakar goes to meet Muski and pays him to fight Aidil by promising to pay off his sick mother's medical bills. At the same time, Jolok rigs the match by putting poison into Aidil's medication. During the fight, Muski unwittingly kills his own best friend in the ring. Meanwhile, while the entire village is at the boxing match, Pok Wah is conducting a cleansing ritual in his land to ward off evil spirits. Bakar shows up uninvited and murders his own father in cold blood. At the same time, Ilham confronts Peng, who has come to the village, and asks him to let his brother go. Unwilling to let Aidil live, Peng stabs Ilham and leaves him to die at the swamp.

In his exploration of the village on the following days, he reunites with his childhood friend Calisto and with his uncle Evaristo, the latter of whom has been elected both the town's priest and mayor.  Despite being touted as the guest of honor, Tom\u00e1s feels concerned that he is virtually unknown among the locals.  Further adding to his dismay is the sudden appearance of Mario, his shady publisher on the run from the law.\nOn the night of the ceremony, Tom\u00e1s and Mario are brutally abducted by the villagers and taken to a reinforced barn on the village's outskirts.  There, upon cryptic prophecies told by Evaristo, the both of them are dropped into a dark labyrinth beneath the village.  In their search for a way out, they inadvertently awaken the werewolf of legend, who proceeds to give chase.  Meanwhile, Calisto locates a secret way to the labyrinth and pulls Tom\u00e1s and Mario out, leaving the werewolf behind.\nThe group takes shelter in Calisto's house. He explains that the village sought to end a century-old curse by feeding a descendant of the Mari\u00f1o family, lest another greater curse take effect. Furthermore, the villagers have blocked the ways out of the town and disabled Tom\u00e1s' car.  Tom\u00e1s attempts to call his grandmother for help, but his cellphone's reception is too poor for his pleas to go through, and the call drops after a short time.\nUnder suspicion from the village and in light of gruesome deaths having happened the night before, Calisto is sent down into the labyrinth to kill the werewolf as the curse is presumed to have remained in effect.  Instead, he finds a young boy, whom he covertly takes into his home.  Hoping to end the curse, he and Mario feed one of Tom\u00e1s fingers to the presumed wolf-child.\nThe group wanders out at sundown to escape the village on foot but are caught by Evaristo and his mob.  As the confrontation escalates, the sun sets and the second curse takes effect, transforming all the villagers into werewolves - except for Calisto whom despite being a local, was actually born outside of the village.

An injury he received during the Ohio State High School Championship game terminated his scholarship to Ohio State University and his dreams of a professional career in football. It's been twenty years since that game and Scott still resides with his family in the quiet town of Coldwater, Ohio. He has a splinted leg and has been a farmer and volunteer firefighter since high school. Rather than marrying the head cheerleader, Scott marries and has two daughters with a clarinet-playing band member named Macy. A compromised harvest and bank obligations have caused a strain on his farm, which he is in jeopardy of losing. With bad luck around every corner, Scott is not mentally prepared for the game in which he will be honored  (in a halftime ceremony), and the return of his good friend Hall who made the NFL and married Scott's old high school girlfriend only adds to the depression he is feeling. An early frost and a broken soybean header bring Scott to the brink. His wife, Macy, suggests that they could pick the soybeans by hand in order to bring them to market. Scott finds this far-fetched since there are 200 acres to combine (harvest). He decides to kill himself via carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning in his truck. As he passes out, Scott wakes up back in 1991, on the eve of the big game.\nScott embraces his return, as he is able to spend time with his hard-working mother. One last recruiting meeting with scouts from OSU enlightens Scott as the scout admits the game will be hard, and that if he so chooses, sitting out will not impact his invitation to joining the quarterback unit at OSU. Scott introduces himself to Macy and tries to share with her what is happening with him. With the championship game upon him, he informs Coach Hand (played by Kurt Russell) that he will not play in the big game which will undo the events which have directly led to his pain and misery. Coach offers a speech about the merits of the people of Coldwater. Coach Hand shares with Scott how he receives a job offer from OSU annually only to turn it down out of love for Coldwater and its inhabitants. As Scott lives through the events leading up to the game, he decides he will play after all. While Scott's efforts on the field keep the game close, Coach Hand encourages him to share the ball with his teammates. In the second half, Scott mixes it up a bit and with \"the play\" imminent, Scott tells his coach he will not run the pitch-fake which ultimately causes his leg to be broken. Coach smiles and suggests a passing play, but informs Scott that based upon the Chief's defensive formation, he can call an audible as necessary, that it is his decision.\nAs Scott prepares to call for the hike, he looks over at his girlfriend, then looks out into the band bleachers, where he sees Macy. The clock runs down and Scott calls an audible, a running play where he maneuvers himself close enough to jump into the end zone. As he crosses, Scott is hammered by two defensive players, and his leg is shattered at the knee. Coldwater wins the Ohio State High School Championship game over the heavily favored Chiefs. Scott demonstrated that he is an intensely talented football player, as he basically, for the most part, single-handedly, beat a high school team that had eight players on defense already signed to NCAA Division I scholarships.\nScott comes to in his truck, his suicide attempt failed due to his truck running out of gas. As he walks to town, he sees it is desolate \u2014 even the football field is absent of any people or players. As he makes a turn for his farm, he sees his soybean field crowded with all the citizens of Coldwater. They heard about his hardship, his need for his crops to make it to market, and the people of Coldwater have stepped up to return the favor \u2026 in honor of the great Scott Murphy, the exceptional quarterback who gave Coldwater the 1991 Ohio State High School Championship. Scott decides to stop complaining about his life and he is happy about what he has and never regret it. He also decides to be an assistant coach to his old mentor coach. He also reunited with his wife and his two kids.", "tmdb_plot": "A former high-school football star loses his shot at a college scholarship due to a devastating gridiron injury, but gets a second chance at living his dream.", "tmdb_id": "75074", "wiki_id": "35574760"}]
