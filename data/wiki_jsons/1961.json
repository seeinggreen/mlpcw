The Abominable Snowman (whose name is Hugo, but that is not revealed in this short) grabs Daffy, names him George (a reference to Of Mice and Men, casting Hugo as Lennie Small to Daffy's George Milton), and gives him crippling hugs, believing Daffy is a rabbit, when actually Daffy just tied his swim shirt round his head for warmth, with the sleeves on top.

This discovery follows some blackboard scribbling in which he reverses a sign in the equation for enthalpy to energy plus pressure times volume. Professor Brainard names his discovery Flubber, a portmanteau of \"flying rubber\". In the excitement of his discovery, he misses his own wedding to Betsy Carlisle, not for the first time, but his third. Subplots include another professor wooing the disappointed Miss Carlisle, Biff Hawk's ineligibility for basketball due to failing Professor Brainard's class, Biff's father Alonzo P. Hawk's schemes to gain wealth by means of Flubber, the school's financial difficulties and debt to Mr. Hawk, and Professor Brainard's attempts to interest the government and military in uses for Flubber. Shelby Ashton, the other professor who is interested in Betsy, is given his revenge by Professor Brainard, who keeps on jumping on the top of Shelby's car, until it crashes into a police car, where Shelby is given a field sobriety test.\nLooking for backers, Professor Brainard bounces his Flubber ball for an audience, but his investment pitch proves so long-winded that most of the crowd has left before they notice that the ball bounced higher on its second bounce than on its first. For a more successful demonstration, he makes his Model T fly by bombarding Flubber with radioactive particles. He puts Flubber on the soles of basketball players' shoes in a crucial game, giving them tremendous jumping ability; he also uses the substance on his own shoe soles to augment his skills during a school dance. Scheming businessman Alonzo P. Hawk becomes aware of Professor Brainard's flying car and, at Biff's suggestion, switches it for a fake. Professor Brainard's debut turns into a mockery when he finds himself with a fake Model T powered by squirrels and pigeons. Realizing it was Hawk's doing, Professor Brainard plays on Hawk's greed by pointing out that, in the 1960s, only 8% of the world's population uses cars, but nearly everyone wears shoes. Professor Brainard gives Hawk a pair of Flubber shoes; soon, Hawk cannot stop bouncing, and is blackmailed into revealing where he hid the Professor's car. A bouncing Hawk soon attracts everyone's attention, even a news crew, who interviews a physicist who sees Hawk keeps bouncing higher with each jump and remarks \"by 7 tonight, he's going to be in serious trouble!\". The police escort the Medfield football team to tackle Hawk on his way down, stopping his bounces. Hawk and Biff then chase after the Professor, who by now has recovered his car from Hawk's warehouse. Hawk crashes into the same squad car Shelby did, and gets arrested for illegal firearms possession. Professor Brainard convinces Betsy to accompany him to Washington, D.C.

They share a moment while Terry is showing her the antique Japanese artworks on display in the embassy, and after some reluctance, she agrees to allow him to call on her.\nThey begin dating and they quickly fall in love, even though Terry occasionally has fits of anti-Western sentiment. When Terry asks her to marry him, she agrees, much to the chagrin of Aunt Peggy (who was raised in the Jim Crow South), and who sees the relationship as unnatural, especially when there are \"nice clean young men\" available. The Japanese ambassador also calls on Gwen and attempts to dissuade her from accepting, claiming that it would hurt Terry's career by giving him an American bias, and states that even though the two countries are friendly, anything could happen between foreign countries. He seems to hint at possible aggression in the future, even though it is only 1935 and the Japanese have not yet resumed conflicts with China, keeping the countries of Gwen and Terry at an uneasy peace. They eventually marry despite the obstacles and, when Terry is recalled, travel to Japan by ship.\nAlmost immediately after disembarking and arriving in Tokyo, Terry begins to treat Gwen much differently, expecting her to behave according to the male-centric beliefs of contemporary Japan, such as being silent among men, entering doors after the men and virtually bending to every whim of Terry and her male relatives. They continually fight and make up, mostly because of Gwen's outspokenness among men and Terry's strict adherence to the local customs.\nAfter having a fight one night when a general says that Terry should be proud that he may have a son to die for the emperor, they make up and she reveals that she was so offended by the comment because she is pregnant. The baby daughter is named Mako.\nBy November 1941, Terry has been reassigned to the embassy in America. They have Thanksgiving dinner in Washington with Aunt Peggy, as World War II embroils the world around them and the U.S. is one of the few powers of the world still at peace. Terry speaks on the phone with his friend Haro. He mentions that Mako, now about five years old, has an apparent illness involving too many antibodies in her blood. He also mentions a possible upcoming invasion of Thailand by the Imperial Japanese Army.\nSensing that it may be the last chance for peace between the U.S. and the Empire of Japan, Terry attempts to go over the heads of his superiors and have a cable sent directly to President Roosevelt, alerting him to cable the Japanese emperor to seek to preserve the peace. However, the emperor is rapidly becoming the leader of Japan in name only because of a power struggle with the army leaders. Terry's effort is in vain, as December 7th comes and war is declared shortly after the Japanese attack.\nTerry calls Gwen after hearing of the attack and tells her to leave Washington for Tennessee with Mako, but the FBI enter and force her to hang up the phone. She decides to accompany Terry back to Japan, as he is due to be deported in an ambassador exchange. A riot nearly occurs as she leaves with the other Japanese families, because of anti-Japanese fervor sweeping the nation in the aftermath of the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Philippines and other European and American-held colonies and bases in the Pacific and Asia.\nIn Japan, a similar nationalist anti-American hatred is present among the citizens. Terry is less enthusiastic about the war, and attempts to be a mediator for peace, which is dangerous because of the prevailing sentiment and the secret police. Gwen is briefly accosted by a group of soldiers, who try to force her to walk on an American flag. She refuses, and an air raid begins, causing panic in the streets as bombs begin to destroy the area. She sees a crying child and, remembering her daughter, runs to the smoldering school to rescue Mako, who says that children had hit her and called her an American.\nLater, Terry reveals that he is under suspicion for being disloyal because he has an American wife, does not belong to any patriotic clubs, and speaks out against the war. Soldiers enter and search the house, and while they don't arrest him, it is clear that he and his family are going to have a rough time as long as they stay in Tokyo. They agree to stay at a friend's empty house outside of the city.\nAs they leave Tokyo, they run into Terry's cousin, Ishi, who has been one of the few people who has been kind to Gwen. Now a soldier, he informs them that he is captain in a kamikaze squadron, and will soon \"die for a descendent of the sun-god.\" While taking a train, Gwen sees captured American soldiers, possibly on a death march. They arrive at their new home and meet the young girl who lives there. Terry reveals that he is going back to Tokyo, and that he did not tell her earlier because she would not have gone to stay without him. He offers to arrange her passage back to the U.S., but she refuses, wanting to be close to her husband.\nAs the war continues, food shortages and widespread damage make it clear that things are going against Japan. As the years go on, Terry visits less and less, and Mako grows up not knowing any other existence other than one of perpetual war. Terry returns after months and they enjoy a night's sleep together. They awaken to a visit from a military police officer, who is looking for Terry. As the war continues to turn against them, they begin to suspect disloyalty from anyone critical of the government. Gwen manages to convince them that she has not seen Terry, and they leave. Terry reveals that he has brought a radio, and an American news station announces the end of the Battle of Iwo Jima, which will be used as a base to launch bombers against mainland Japan. Later on, the surrender of Nazi Germany, Japan's main ally, is also announced, and it is clear that the invasion of Japan is coming soon.\nTerry and Gwen have a fight one night because he gave away the last of their food.

At the burial, Gwen comments on Mako's jaded reaction, showing no tears or emotion for her friend, because of Japanese customs, as well as growing up during a war.\nOne night, Gwen visits Terry's old friend Hara, who has some power within the party, pleading for him to keep her husband safe. He introduces her to Tokyo Rose, a radio propaganda announcer who tries to lower the morale of enemy armies listening to her broadcasts. They agree to help Terry, but only if Gwen makes an anti-American speech on the radio, recognizing the propaganda value of an actual American denouncing her country. Gwen refuses, and learns that Ishi has been fatally injured and is in the hospital. She visits, and realizing that he is dying, she asks why he had sent his wife away. He reveals that it is because of tradition that he did not want his loved ones to see him die. She returns home in time to see Terry, who had been hiding in the hills to avoid arrest, return.\nThe next day, the entire village arrives at their house, as it is the only one with a radio, for the emperor's radio address. The emperor has never spoken in public before, so they realize he must have major news, possibly of a surrender. As the village listens to the emperor's voice for the first time, the speech starts:\n\nWe are fully aware of the innermost feelings of all of you, however, have resolved to pave the way for peace for all generations to come. By enduring the unendurable, and suffering what is insufferable, let the entire nation unite as one family, from generation to generation, and cultivate the ways of rectitude and nobility of spirit.\nWith the war over, Terry asks Gwen to return to her home of Johnson City, Tennessee to put Mako in an American school while she is young and can lose her prejudices against America, to \"become a bridge between the two nations.\" Gwen vehemently refuses to leave him. Later on, she finds Terry, who has been overworked, malnourished and ill for many months, standing over his parents' graves. She recalls a speech that he once gave her about visiting the graves of ancestors at times of marriage, birth, and death. She also recalls the conversation with Ishi at the hospital before his death when he said that he did not want his wife to see him die. She speaks to Terry's doctor and learns that he has, at most, months to live, and was trying to send his family away because, like his cousin, he didn't want them to see him die.\nDays later, after Gwen agrees to Terry's final wish for her and Mako to depart for America, he sees her and their daughter off at the dock. They kiss and embrace for the last time, and Gwen reassures Terry that they will be expecting him soon, knowing that she will never see him again.\nAs the ship departs, Terry walks down the dock, keeping pace with it until he can go no further. The film ends with Gwen and Terry lovingly meeting each other's gaze for the final time.

Rodrigo, who swore to protect all the king\u2019s children, single-handedly defeats Alfonso's guards and brings the Prince to Calahorra. Sancho arrives to demand Alfonso, but Urraca refuses to hand him over. Rodrigo cannot take a side in the conflict, because his oath was to serve them all equally.\nBen Yusuf arrives at Valencia, the fortified city guarding the beach where he plans to land his armada. To weaken his Spanish opponents he hires Dolfos, a warrior formerly trusted by Ferdinand, to assassinate Sancho and throw suspicion for the crime on Alfonso, who becomes the sole king. At Alfonso's coronation, El Cid has him swear upon the Bible that he had no part in the death of his brother. Alfonso, genuinely innocent (although his ally Urraca was aware of the plot), is offended by the demand and banishes Rodrigo from Spain. Chimene discovers she still loves Rodrigo and voluntarily joins him in exile. Rodrigo makes his career as a soldier elsewhere in Spain, and he and Chimene have twin girls.\nYears later, Rodrigo, now known widely as \"El Cid\", is called back into the service of the king to protect Castile from Yusuf's North African army. However, Alfonso rejects an alliance with El Cid's Muslim friends, and rather than work directly with the king, El Cid allies himself with the emirs to besiege Valencia, where the cowardly al-Kadir has violated his oath of allegiance to Rodrigo and come out in support of Ben Yusuf.\nAfter being defeated by the Moors at the Battle of Sagrajas, Alfonso seizes Chimene and her children and puts them in prison. Count Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez rescues the three and brings them to Rodrigo, wanting to end his rivalry with El Cid and join him in the defense of Spain. Knowing that the citizens of Valencia are starving after the long siege, Rodrigo wins them over by throwing bread into the city with his catapults. Al-Kadir tries to intercede, but the Valencians kill him and open the gates to the besiegers. Emir al-Mu'tamin, Rodrigo's army, and the Valencians offer the city's crown to El Cid,  but he refuses and instead sends the crown to King Alfonso.\nBen Yusuf arrives with his immense invasion army, and Valencia is the only barrier between him and Spain. Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez is tortured and killed after being captured on a reconnaissance mission. The ensuing battle goes well for the defenders until El Cid is struck in the chest by an arrow and has to return to the city in plain sight of the Moorish army. Doctors inform him that they can probably remove the arrow and save his life, but he will be incapacitated for a long time after the surgery. Unwilling to abandon his army at this critical moment, Rodrigo obtains a promise from Chimene to leave the arrow and let him ride back into battle, dying or dead. A guilt-ridden King Alfonso comes to his bedside and asks for his forgiveness. Rodrigo grants it, and Alfonso promises to look after Rodrigo's children.\nRodrigo dies, and a rumor of his death spreads. His allies honor Rodrigo's final wish. With help of an iron frame they prop up his body, its eyes staring straight ahead. Dressed in full armor and holding an unfurled banner, he is strapped to the back of his horse, Babieca. Guided by King Alfonso and Emir al-Mu'tamin riding on either side, the horse leads a mounted charge against Ben Yusuf's now terrified soldiers, who believe that El Cid has risen from the dead. In the panic that ensues, Ben Yusuf is thrown from his horse and is crushed beneath Babieca's hooves, leaving his scattered army to be annihilated. King Alfonso leads Christians and Moors alike in a prayer for God to receive the soul \"of the purest knight of all\".", "tmdb_id": 16638}, "35027707": {"title": "Claudelle Inglish", "plot": "Pretty and shy young Georgia farmgirl Claudelle Inglish (Diane McBain), the daughter of a poor sharecropper Clyde Inglish (Arthur Kennedy) and his wife Jessie (Constance Ford), starts dating the poor neighbor, handsome farmboy Linn Varner (Chad Everett) during the spring of their senior year in high school. Claudelle and Linn instantly hit it off together, and soon they fall in love. Her mother objects to the relationship, fearing Claudelle will end up in the same rut she is, being married to a poor farmer, resulting in a stormy marriage. Claudelle is forced to endure her parents' many arguments stemming from Jessie's unhappiness having to be married to Clyde, a poor but hard-working farmer.\nAt the same time, rich, middle-aged, portly landowner S.T. Crawford (Claude Akins), who owns the farm where the Inglish family live, begins to secretly eye Claudelle. Despite her mother's protests, Linn wins her dad's approval by helping him on the farm. Shortly before graduation, Linn takes Claudelle to a neighborhood carnival, where he wins her a musical dancing doll. That same night, Linn asks Claudelle to marry him and she happily says yes. Linn gets drafted into the army, and he and Claudelle are spending their last night together before Linn's departure at the senior prom. The two leave the dance to go for a walk, where Claudelle tells Linn her fears about him being away in the army for two years and how she is afraid they will never be together again. Linn calms her fears by promising her he will marry her the day he comes home from the service. Claudelle, still fearing about Linn leaving her, has him make love to her that night in the woods.\nClaudelle and Linn exchange letters through the summer, fall, and the following winter, with Claudelle looking forward to the day when he will return to marry her. During the winter, Claudelle makes payments on a trousseau for her wedding at Harley Peasley (Frank Overton) and his wife Ernestine's (Hope Summers) general store. She stays true to Linn, even politely rejecting the advances of Harley's son Dennis (Will Hutchins).\nBy spring, Linn's letters to Claudelle have slowed down causing her to worry, but she tells herself he is just really busy in the army with no time to write. She shares these feelings with her pastor Rev. Armstrong (Ford Rainey), leaving church one Sunday morning. A few days later, a despondent Claudelle waits for the mailman Mr. Gunstom (William Fawcett) on the porch of her house. Just then, Mr. Gunstom delivers a letter from Linn to an ecstatic Claudelle. Her joy is soon turned to sorrow as Linn tells Claudelle in his letter that, sometime back, he met a nice girl who's been very good to him and that he plans to marry her. Jessie hears Claudelle crying and tells her she's glad it happened and she should set her sights on S.T., as she feels having a rich husband brings true happiness. A crying Claudelle rejects this idea and locks herself in her room. When discussing Claudelle and Linn's breakup, Jessie tells Clyde how she wishes they hadn't married so she could be living better.\nClaudelle wakes up the next morning after a bad storm and decides to get revenge on Linn the best way she knows how by becoming the town bad girl and teasing all the local boys. She starts wearing heavy makeup to entice all the boys. The trousseau that was meant for her wedding day, she now wears as an enticement to all the local men. Finding out she is available again, S.T. tries everything to win Claudelle over. He asks Clyde to persuade Claudelle to marry him; but Clyde, not liking S.T.'s intentions towards his daughter, refuses to do so, telling S.T. that no young girl would marry a man their age. S.T. then buys Claudelle a pair of red shoes she has wanted for a long time and proposes to her when he gives them to her, but she laughs him off telling him he is too old and fat and sends him on his way. Her mother tries to force her to marry S.T., but she flatly rejects him and starts having flings with Dennis (making love to him in his car down by the woods the same night she's supposed to go out with S.T.), Dave Adams (Jan Stine), Charles Henry (Robert Logan), and other neighbor boys, gaining herself a bad reputation with the men. At night, she cries in her sleep over memories of Linn and subconsciously realizes that being a bad girl is not going to help her cope with the pain. Nevertheless, she continues down her thorny path, accumulating many nice gifts, necklaces, perfume, etc., from all her male suitors. One night, at a local dance at a local dive, Claudelle meets a husky, rugged, aggressive drifter Rip Guyler (Robert Colbert), who instantly becomes infatuated with her, telling her he'll see her soon.\nOne night, S.T. shows up to take out Claudelle and sees what he thinks is her in the shadows coming to his car and it turns out to be Jessie, who, on a whim, is wearing Claudelle's white dress. S.T. is disappointed when Jessie tells him that Claudelle has stood him up again and gone out with Davy. S.T. tells Jessie how he thought she was Claudelle and how she reminds him of a young pretty girl wearing her white dress and asks her to go riding with him. Jessie, by this time, is completely indifferent to any feelings she had for her husband (who is sound asleep in the house), and she accepts S.T.'s offer. The two of them go riding down to the local make-out place by the lake where they are spotted by Claudelle and Davy, who laughs hysterically at them. Back home, a sleeping Clyde wakes up to find Jessie gone and all the gifts in Claudelle's room from her various suitors. When she returns with Davy, she shows off the necklace he gave her to Clyde, who yanks it off her neck and throws it to Davy, ordering him to leave and never come back. Clyde angrily confronts her about all the gifts on her bedroom dresser and is further angered when Claudelle tells him she and Davy saw S.T. and Jessie down by the lake. In a fit of rage, Clyde slaps Claudelle over her promiscuous behavior.\nA few days later, on Clyde's orders, Claudelle goes to see Rev. Armstrong but finds him to be of no help. She then goes to Harley's store, where she seduces Harley in the back room, only to be discovered by Ernestine, who then leaves her husband to stay with Vestor, her daughter. Claudelle quickly rushes home, locking herself in her room, refusing to talk to Clyde or Jessie. Back at Harley's store, Dennis takes an expensive watch from the display case, planning to give it to Claudelle as an engagement present. Harley tries to stop Dennis from doing this, and the two get into a heated argument over the watch. Harley, not wanting Dennis to find out about his sexual encounter with Claudelle, does everything he can to talk Dennis from going to see Claudelle, but Dennis ignores his dad and drives off, with Harley having a war-weary look on his face.\nDennis arrives at Claudelle's house with the watch he plans to give her as an engagement present. Clyde is in the house telling Jessie his shame over her fling with S.T. when he hears Dennis pull up. Clyde tells Dennis to leave; but, when Dennis tells Clyde his intentions on proposing to Claudelle, he agrees to let her come out to see Dennis. Thinking this may settle her down, Clyde tries to talk to Claudelle. Rip shows up in his big hot rod to take out Claudelle, and he and Dennis get into a bad fight. Clyde breaks up the fight and orders Rip to leave. While Clyde and Jessie help Dennis clean his wounds, bad girl Claudelle takes off with Rip.\nLate that night, when they return, Dennis surprises Rip by tossing a wrench through his windshield. Rip then runs Dennis over and takes off. A tearful Claudelle looks outside as Dennis is taken away in an ambulance, and Clyde talks to the police. Clyde tells Claudelle and Jessie that, from now on, he is going to be listened to in his own house.\nThe next morning, Clyde is shocked when he wakes up and is told by Claudelle that Jessie packed her bags that morning and left. She tells Clyde that she followed her and that Jessie tried to get S.T. to take her in; but, after a bad argument, S.T. shut the door in her face and Jessie took a bus to Santee. Claudelle feels bad about what happened to Dennis and regrets her bad behavior to Clyde, who comforts her and tells her that they will leave the farm and start a new life somewhere else. He assures her she'll find another man she'll love again like she loved Linn. Clyde goes outside to fetch his shovel while Claudelle goes to her room to pack her things, only to be confronted by a crazed, revenge-seeking Harley pointing a pistol at her. He tells her Dennis has died and that he is angry about her still being alive with her painted lips and her wickedness. Harley shoots her in the chest and quickly escapes. Clyde rushes into the house when he hears the gunshot, unaware that Harley's the one that shot her. Harley has escaped by the time Clyde finds Claudelle lying on the floor of her room bleeding from the gunshot wound. Claudelle murmurs \"Papa\" to her dad as she dies in his arms.

While she has no romantic feelings for him, expressing puzzlement as to why she ever married him, she nonetheless is friendly with him and feels sorry for his predicament, so she agrees to consider it.\nIn the meantime, Iris meets Vito Perugino (Scott Marlowe), the 17-year-old son of the superintendent of the apartment building (Joe De Santis) and experiences an instant and powerful physical attraction to him. In their first meeting, she is shamelessly flirtatious; in their second, she completes her sexual seduction of him, marking the start of a passionate affair between the two.

He is in love with his cousin Angela (Stefania Sandrelli), a 16-year-old girl he sees only during the summer because her family sends her away to Catholic school in the city. Besides his wife, he shares his life with his elderly parents, his sister, and her fianc\u00e9, a funeral director; the family share their once stately palace with his uncles, who are slowly but surely eating away the remainders of their once rich estate.\nAware that divorce is illegal, Ferdinando fantasizes about doing away with his wife, such as by throwing her into a boiling cauldron, sending her into space in a rocket, or drowning her in quicksand. After a chance encounter with Angela during a family trip, he discovers that she shares his feelings. Inspired by a local story of a woman who killed her husband in a rage of jealousy, he resolves to lead his wife into having an affair so that he can catch her in flagrante delicto, murder her, and receive a light sentence for committing an honour killing. He first needs to find a suitable lover for his wife, whom he finds in the local priest's godson, Carmelo Patan\u00e8 (Leopoldo Trieste), a painter who has had feelings for Rosalia for years and was for a time presumed killed during World War II. He also procures the State Prosecutor's friendship with a small favor. The final stage of his plan is to arrange for Carmelo's constant presence in his house, which he achieves by feigning interest in having his palace frescoes restored.\nBut Carmelo is timid with Rosalia, and she is initially committed to conjugal fidelity. Ferdinando tapes their private conversations and has to ward off the maid Sisina's infatuation with Carmelo. After Carmelo makes a pass at Sisina, she tells the priest, Carmelo's godfather, at confession, who informs her that Carmelo is married with three children, information she relays to Ferdinando. Rosalia and Carmelo finally give in to their passion but the tape of their conversation runs out just as they are arranging their next meeting. All Ferdinando knows is that it will take place the next evening.\nRosalia feigns a headache and remains home while the rest of the family goes to the cinema to see the local premi\u00e8re of La Dolce Vita, a film so scandalous that no one wants to miss it. Ferdinando sneaks out of the theatre and returns home, arriving just in time to see Rosalia leaving for the train station. He retrieves his gun to kill her, but arrives at the station just after their train departs. He revisits his plan and the Criminal Code. It defines a crime of passion as executed in the heat of the moment or in defense of one's honor, so he embraces the role of a cuckold.\nAll along, Angela has been writing Ferdinando to assure him of her undying love for him. Her last letter is misdelivered to her father, who dies of a heart attack upon reading it. At the funeral, Ferdinando is approached by Mrs. Patan\u00e8, who demands to know what he will do about their situation. After he responds noncommittally, she spits in his face in front of the entire town, which gives him what he needs: an open insult to the family's honor due to his wife's elopement. The local Mafia boss offers to find the lovers within 24 hours, which he does. As Ferdinando goes to the lovers' hideout, he hears Mrs. Patan\u00e8 kill Carmelo. He follows suit and kills Rosalia. At his trial he is defended by the State Prosecutor, who blames the whole thing on Ferdinando's father and his lack of love when raising him as a boy. He spends no more than three years in prison and returns home to find Angela waiting for him.\nIn the film's epilogue, Ferdinando and Angela are happily sailing at sea.

He is a Porthcarron native, and his father, Robert, is the village doctor. A young widowed nurse, Linda Parker, assists Robert.\nPolice Sgt. Cook is investigating the crimes. Peter eagerly volunteers to help search the tin mines for the latest missing man, George Beale. But Peter's motive is not altruistic: he wants to prevent Cook from discovering the lab in the mine, for Peter is behind the thefts and disappearances.\nPeter finds Beale slowly crawling away inside the mine but cannot stop him as Sgt. Cook is too near. Beale drags himself outside. Searchers call Peter to render medical assistance. As Beale mumbles incoherently, Peter injects him with something and pronounces him dead, then offers to do the post mortem. Meanwhile, Robert is unable to analyse the contents of a broken syringe stolen from his office and found in Beale's room. He takes it to Plymouth Hospital for a full analysis. Then Linda finds a curious clay container. Peter explains it as a gift from a schoolmate \u2013 an ancient South American curare container.Peter speaks oddly to Linda about his time in Vienna. He says that he and his supervising professor were on the verge of a controversial medical breakthrough, but the professor refused to continue. Peter calls him rule-bound, superstitious, and ignorant and arrogantly tells Linda that \"no one's going to hold me back now.\"\nBeale's PM is to be done at the village undertaker Mr. Morton's mortuary. But Beale is not dead, and Peter begins to remove his living heart. Morton interrupts Peter's grisly work. Peter tells Morton that Beale was worthless \u2013 sitting around in pubs, never making anything of himself \u2013 and that he will put Beale's heart into someone dead who, unlike Beale, deserves to live. Morton tries to stop Peter, and in the ensuing struggle, Peter accidentally kills Morton. By then, Beale's heart has died.\nPeter takes Linda to the tin mines, where she has never been. Inside, he tells her a weird story that, as a boy, he played there, pretending he was dead and then coming back to life. They're startled by self-employed tin miner Tregaye, who leads them out. Peter later returns, and Tregaye becomes his latest victim. When Peter and Linda attend Beale's funeral, Peter notices that Linda has gone off to gaze lovingly at her husband Steve's grave.\nRobert returns from Plymouth Hospital. The liquid in the syringe is curare. Trying to deflect suspicion, Peter says that, coincidentally, he and Linda had recently been talking about curare. But Linda is growing suspicious. Sgt. Cook arrives, telling them that Tregaye has been found dead, and asks Peter to perform the PM. Tregaye is not at all deceased, though. Peter's curare has immobilised him.\nLinda confronts Peter. He tells her that he will put the living hearts of wastrels into the dead bodies of those who deserve to live, such as great scientists and philosophers. Linda says that only God has the right to decide who lives and who dies, but Peter insists that he too has that right as a doctor. She replies that he may be able to restore \"physical life\", but the result will be an \"evil being\". Linda runs away when Peter says she only loves Steve's memory, not what he is now, \"pinned down by a gravestone.\"\nSgt. Cook and Robert have also realised that Peter is behind the crimes. Peter goes to the cemetery, unearths a body, and hauls it back to his lab, where Tregaye also lies. He transplants Tregaye's beating heart into the body that he's disinterred. The body, of course, is that of Steve Parker.\nSgt. Cook organises a search. Peter forces Linda into the mine, where she encounters her reanimated but decomposed husband.

Eron is rescued, but Erik is left behind in the chaos.\nLater, King Loter arrives on the scene, where he threatens to strip Rutford of his title. Rutford retaliates by having his assassin kill Loter with an arrow. Loter's wife, Queen Alice, runs away and, after finding Erik hiding on the beach, decides to raise him as her own son.\nTwenty years later, the Vikings once again wage war against England. The adult Eron has fallen in love with a vestal virgin named Daya, the identical twin sister of the vestal Rama. They hide their love out of fear of being executed. Eron tells Daya that a king is permitted to marry a vestal. Viking leader King Olaf makes a pact with the kingdoms of Iceland, Norway, and Sweden to invade England once again. Due to his age, Olaf appoints a younger to lead the attack. Olaf chooses Eron, but his choice is contested by Garian. Garian wishes to be elected leader, and a vote by 100 warriors is taken. Olaf declares that they will have to fight to the death. Eron is victorious but refuses to kill his opponent, asking Garian to serve as his right-hand man.\nIn England, the adult Erik is appointed Duke of Helford and leader of the English sea forces, replacing Sir Rutford. Rutford plants an agent on board to set fire to Erik's ship while at sea.\nThe Viking and English fleets meet in the North Sea, and a sea battle begins. Vikings board Erik's flagship just as the agent sets fire to it. In the battle, Erik and Eron meet and engage in a swordfight. Erik's ship catches fire. Erik jumps overboard and later washes ashore in Viking land. Rama finds him. He points Erik in the direction of a local fishing village, where the Vikings accept him as a shipwrecked fisherman.\nIn England, Sir Rutford proposes marriage to the queen, who rebuffs him. Eron and his men arrive. Eron then appoints Rutford as Regent and takes Queen Alice as a hostage back to Viking land. There, Rama is assigned to look after Queen Alice. Rama notices that the queen also wears a cross and mentions this to Erik. Demanding to know the prisoner's name, Erik is shocked to find that it is his 'mother'.\nThe next day, Eron and Daya are to be married. As Erik watches the wedding ceremony, he mistakenly believes that it is Rama who is being married. Enraged by this imagined 'affront', Erik confronts Daya, who doesn't know him. Erik is then locked away by King Olaf to be executed the following morning.\nRama drugs Erik's guards, explains to him that the woman he saw married was her twin sister, and cuts him free. While they flee, Eron and a horde of Vikings give pursuit. Eron nearly falls to his death, but Erik, urged by Rama, rescues him from certain death. Eron continues to pursue them, but Erik and Rama meet up with Queen Alice, and they safely sail to England.\nErik gathers a combined English-Scottish force to attack Rutford's castle but finds that Eron and the Vikings have arrived before him. Erik challenges Eron to a duel. Eron accepts, leaving Daya in Rutford's care. In the ensuing swordfight, Eron catches sight of the tattoo on Erik's chest and recognises him as his brother. He declares a ceasefire, upsetting Rutford, who responds by having his henchman fire an arrow at Erik. Eron throws himself in the path of the arrow and is fatally wounded. The enraged Vikings attempt to storm the castle, but Rutford raises the drawbridge and threatens to kill Daya by the next morning if the Vikings do not disband.\nAs Eron lies dying, he names Erik as his successor. He becomes more delirious and asks to see Daya one last time. Erik determines to do this by breaking her out of the castle. Erik scales the castle wall. Meanwhile, Rama realizes that the dying Eron will not last much longer and poses as her sister to him. Eron is oblivious to the deception and finally dies upon declaring his love for her.\nErik makes his way into the castle, where he rescues Daya. The combined Viking, English, and Scottish armies attack the castle at dawn, scaling the walls and slaughtering the defenders. Rutford's men are killed, with Rutford himself being the last to fall when he attempts to throw a spear at the escaping Eron but is pierced with at least a dozen Viking arrows.\nWith peace restored, Queen Alice reclaims her throne and allows Erik to leave England to claim his title as King of the Vikings.

During a first raid at the professor's home, Arcovazzi does not recognize him and Bonaf\u00e8 can escape to his family residence in rural Abruzzo. The fascist is hence appointed again to capture him there, and to lead him to Rome, momentarily still controlled by the RSI. Primo does not understand that the political situation is changing and his faction is about to lose, and is easily lured by the promise of a promotion; while for his superiors, his tardiness and naive fascist faith make him an ideal expendable candidate for the mission.\nEquipped with a motorcycle-sidecar combination Arcovazzi manages to capture the professor and the two head back towards Rome. Along the way they have a small accident to avoid running over a girl (Stefania Sandrelli), who turns out to be a confidence trickster and petty thief. They share part of the way after the motorcycle is wrecked, but the girl disappears after having scammed the professor out of 150 lire.\nArcovazzi asks for assistance with his vehicle to a truckload of Wehrmacht soldiers passing by. But his sidecar gets confiscated and the two are taken prisoner by the German forces, who immediately recognize the professor for his academic fame and a have him in a Gestapo list of wanted men, due to a publication opposing the Jews'persecution.\nThe couple manage to escape thanks to Bonaf\u00e8's ability to improvise an explosive formula, and taking advantage of confusion during an allied air raid. They don German uniforms to pass unnoticed during the commotion and get momentarily separated. Later they reunite and again, while Arcovazzi is stealing a Schwimmwagen in order to continue his mission of delivering Bonaf\u00e8 to fascist authorities in Rome, the professor tries in vain to desert him.\nThe following night the two men stop to sleep in a barn, and they meet again by chance the thieving girl. She is afraid but the trio eventually reconcile over the attempts to capture and cook a chicken for dinner.\nIn the morning the girl wakes up first and leaves with all of Arcovazzi's and Bonaf\u00e8's clothes and accessories, except for their Schwimmwagen. Depressed by the events but still faithful to his mission, Arcovazzi tries to continue. He attempts to ford a stream, trusting in the Schwimmwagen's amphibious qualities but, due to previous damage or his own ineptitude, the vehicle sinks.\nUpon eventually reaching a village on foot, Arcovazzi tries to ask for help at the local fascist party cell (\"Casa del Fascio\"). The place is however deserted, and the only people around are a couple of teenagers, armed and brain-washed by fascist propaganda. Arcovazzi is questioned to prove his knowledge of fascist lore, and kept at gun point until able to prove his trustworthiness. Only professor Bonaf\u00e8's help in answering the last question allows him to answer the last challenge and to avoid being shot. But even after gaining the teenagers' trust, there is no support to be had and Arcovazzi is only able to confiscating a tandem bicycle and a pistol, again to resume his struggle of delivering Bonaf\u00e8 as prisoner in Rome.\nAgain the duo has to stop when bursting a tire, in the neighborhood of the town of Rocca Sabina. Arcovazzi recognizes it as the home of (fictitious) nationalist poet Arcangelo Bardacci, whom he idolizes and whose writings (which he can quote verbatim) prompted him to become a fascist. Upon reaching the poet's house, he is told however that the poet had joined the Royal Italian Army in Albania and perished in the struggle. In reality Bardacci is alive and hiding in the house, biding his time hiding in the cellar until the regime he once endorsed finally collapses.\nArcovazzi is oblivious to the false tale and accepts hospitality in the poet's house, while Bonaf\u00e8 discovers the truth and is allowed to escape in exchange of a promise to assist with Bardacci's political rehabilitation in the future. Despite the head start, Arcovazzi however manages to catch once again his prisoner, and resumes the voyage towards Rome with his captive.\nFor a while the two can travel on a methane powered pullman, but during one of the frequent stops the professor escapes once again. By the time Arcovazzi manages to recapture him, the pullman is long gone and again they must walk, eventually reaching the outskirts of Rome in the dusk hours of early June, 1944.\nUnbeknown to them the Italian Capital has just been conquered by the Allies. As they walk, they see increasing signs of the mutated situation, with groups of GIs celebrating their victory, whom Arcovazzi mistakes for war prisoners. Upon meeting once again the young girl, he demands back his clothes but gladly accepts her \"even better\" mocking offer of a full fascist \"Federale\" uniform, anticipating his promotion for successful delivery of Bonaf\u00e8 as prisoner.\nDespite his new uniform, Arcovazzi is initially just mocked by the U.S. troops that they meet further on within the capital, contrary to fascist propaganda which maintained all allied soldiers were bloodthirsty brutes. He is still continuing his attempt to complete the mission in an increased state of confusion, when he is spotted instead by Italian resistance fighters of the Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale that are also convening into the city. Together with other civilians, they attack Arcovazzi who is about to be lynched by the people. Only Bonaf\u00e8 saves his captor, pretending to shoot him but in reality throwing away his uniform and offering his jacket to allow him to hide his compromised political affiliation.

While asking where to find Madam Fong, Mei Li performs a flower drum song to earn money (\"A Hundred Million Miracles\"). Sammy is the owner of a night club, the Celestial Gardens (inspired by the actual Forbidden City nightclub) and already is romantically involved with his leading showgirl Linda Low. The Lis arrive at the Celestial Gardens during a show (\"Fan Tan Fannie\").\nSammy does his best to dissuade Mei Li from marrying him, introducing her to Madame Liang, the sister-in-law of Master Wang. Liang and Wang bemoan the gap between immigrants and their offspring (\"The Other Generation\") as Master Wang's younger son Wang San gives his own take on the gap to some younger children. Dissolving the marriage contract is harder than either imagined. Master Wang is persuaded by Madame Liang to allow Mei Li to fall in love naturally with Master Wang's eldest son Wang Ta, and the Lis move in with Master Wang. However, Wang Ta is dazzled by the charms of Linda, who flirts with him (\"I Enjoy Being a Girl\"). He asks her to go on a date, and she convinces him to give her his fraternity pin to symbolize they are \"going steady\" during the date.\nWhen Mei Li sees Wang Ta sneaking back in after the date, she mistakes his friendly greeting as a welcome to the household and starts to warm to America (\"I Am Going to Like It Here\"). Linda plans to use Wang Ta to force a commitment from Sammy Fong out of jealousy, but Sammy gets wind of her scheme when Linda attends a party to celebrate both Wang Ta's graduation from university and Madame Liang's graduation from citizenship classes. Madame Liang compares the citizens of the U.S. to a mix of different ingredients (\"Chop Suey\"). At the party, Linda has Frankie Wing, the club emcee, pose as her brother to grant permission for Linda to marry Wang Ta. Mei Li, hearing this, becomes discouraged, and Ta and his father argue over his marriage plans. Ta argues that he is old enough to make his own decisions, but the father says that he will be the one to let Ta know when he is old enough.\n\nAt the New Year's Parade, Linda rides on a float and sings about Grant Avenue, Chinatown's \"western street with eastern manners\" (\"Grant Avenue\"). Sammy, in an effort to keep Linda from marrying Wang Ta, invites Wang Ta and his family to Celestial Gardens, where they see Frankie Wing recall girls he has known (\"Gliding Through My Memoree\") and Linda's nightclub act (\"Fan Tan Fannie\"). Wang Ta is shocked at her performance. He leaves, distraught, accompanied by the seamstress Helen Chao, his friend since childhood. Helen also grew up in the U.S. and deeply loves Wang Ta. Ta becomes drunk in his misery over Linda, and Helen ends up letting him stay for the night in her apartment, where she declares her unrequited love (\"Love, Look Away\").\nIn the morning, Mei Li comes to deliver a burned coat for Helen to mend and becomes distressed when she discovers Wang Ta's clothing in Helen's kitchen. When Wang Ta wakes up (seconds after Mei Li leaves), he still does not notice Helen's affections, even as she pleads for him to stay, and he leaves quickly. He goes to speak with Mei Li, now realizing that she is a better match for him than Linda Low (\"You Are Beautiful\"), only to have Mei Li reject him, saying that she once loved him, but not anymore.\nShe and her father leave Master Wang's house and pursue the marriage contract between Mei Li and Sammy Fong. Sammy has proposed to Linda, who daydreams about wedded life (\"Sunday\"). Unfortunately, now that Mei Li is pursuing Sammy again, he and Linda will be unable to marry as the contract with Mei Li is binding.

However, when a somewhat overbearing and destructively-outspoken classmate informs Michael that Rachel is Jewish and that \"the Jews killed Christ\", an outraged Michael rushes to Rachel at their clubhouse and angrily confronts her, \"Why did you kill Christ?\" Rachel is shocked and insistently denies it: \"I didn't kill him. I don't even know him\". Michael and Rachel conclude that God is angry at them for becoming friends, but they are not sure if He will forgive them. They decide to attend church with each other to see if God is mad at them, believing they will die if He does not want them to go to each other's church.

It is revealed that Miriam and her brother Warren, who has recently returned from Denmark after the death of his last surviving parent, are heirs to Warren's father's estate. The two talk about how Warren's father was abusive to Warren growing up and the details of the will. Miriam stands to inherit the estate if Warren dies before marrying, as Warren's father was a misogynist who went out of his way to make Warren his sole heir so that only a male child of his could inherit. Miriam also confesses to Warren good news of her own, that she is engaged to be married to her boyfriend.\nThat evening, Emily breaks into Miriam's flower shop and wrecks the store.

The secret of the child's gender was known only to the child's mother, Helga the housekeeper, and the county clerk (who later became a justice of the peace), who had been bribed to enter the birth of a boy. This was done mainly to avoid the murderous wrath of Warren's father, who wanted a boy and would have harmed the child. \"Emily\" was an alternate identity Warren had created overseas to be able to live as a woman away from those who knew him.

They also speed up his growth and tell the parents that he will grow by \"hours, not days\". The boy's grandfather comes to visit and tries to give the boy working tools for later in life, but the gifts are refused by the parents and fairies, who tell him that the boy is already promised happiness and will have no need to work.  They magically turn the grandfather into a sheet of paper and send him off to his apartment.  The grandfather, not liking the idea of his grandson having ready-made happiness, breaks out of his magical cage and decides to seek help.\nHe visits a friend of his; a scientist who works in a large laboratory with a collection of amazing inventions such as human-like robots, including one which can compose poetry.  He asks the scientist's robots what will become of a person who is born into ready-made happiness.  Most of them tell him that he will become disagreeable, lazy and arrogant, but the poetry-composing robot tells him that it would be terrible to take happiness away from a child. Unsure of what to do, the grandfather decides to visit the Land of Happiness and see for himself what it is like.  \nThe scientist synthesizes a copy of the magical red ball by using a few fragments that were left on the grandfather's hand after he held it while he was visiting his grandchild.

However, she tells him that if he goes to the \"Kingdom of Quick Feats and Easy Victories\" around the corner, and passes the tests, he will receive a golden key which will open any lock including, presumably, this one.  The boy goes to the kingdom, where he's met at the gates by a four-headed dragon.  While the four heads of the dragon try to reach consensus on whether or not to let him in, the boy sneaks in and fulfills all of the ridiculously easy tests, whereupon he is hailed a hero and given the golden key.  \nWhen he comes back to the gate, he finds that the key doesn't work and begins to cry.  The small robot who put on the lock tells him that the lock can only be opened by a key which he makes with his own hands, so the boy goes to his grandfather to learn how to make a key.  \nHis grandfather teaches him how to properly use tools, and the boy slowly learns.

Jerry wakes up hearing this and goes after Tom by tying a string to his tail, throwing the string over a tree then tying the other end to a telephone pole. After this, he cuts the pole and tips it enough to lift Tom up into the tree. The bird and Jerry then fill a large tub with water, put it on an outside fireplace, light a fire underneath, then the bird loosens the string and lets Tom sling-shot into the tub, where he splashes around yelling, jumps out and bounces away and back (with funny \"boing boing\" sounds). The bird and Jerry laugh at the fact Tom looks bottomless. Tom grabs the hose and chases Jerry and the bird into the mouse hole, and tries flooding them out, as Tom laughs and laughs himself silly, but Jerry and the bird stop the hose with a mousetrap until the water backs up enough and the bird comes out and pops the hose, leaving Tom tied up in the hose.

Bardeman's lavish lifestyle and tax problems have placed him deeply in debt. Angela urges him to solve his money problems by staging a robbery of the syndicate's money, using a man he knows will play the role of armed robber for him. She then visits Ed Rackin (Ken Lynch), a nightclub owner who looks out for the syndicate's local interests and who Henry also visits to collect syndicate numbers proceeds. Their conversation reveals that Bardeman is unaware that they know one another, and that Angela and Rackin are scheming to take Bardeman's money after the staged robbery and run off together.\nBardeman arranges to have the robbery take place at Angela's house during Henry's weekly visit. During the robbery, Henry unexpectedly pulls a gun on the disguised robber, who shoots and mortally wounds Henry. The robber turns out to be Rackin, who drives off in Henry's car with the money and the dying Henry. When the police find Henry's body at the wheel of his car alongside a road soon afterwards, New York Police Department Captain Matthew Gower (Jack Warden) and his homicide squad launch an investigation into his murder.\nGower is an idealistic and honest cop and outspoken critic of the corruption he finds all around him in the city government and police force. He has faced repeated reprimands and disciplinary action, including a demotion from deputy inspector to captain, at the hands of the corrupt Police Commissioner James Deane (David White), who punishes him when he interferes in syndicate activities. When Mayor Harold Emshaw (James Seay), facing pressure from the press to clean up the city government and police department, removes Deane from his position, he appoints Gower as acting commissioner, promoting him over the head of his superior, Chief Inspector Gus Honochek (Arch Johnson). Gower sets about creating a hand-picked team of honest detectives to work directly under him to investigate organized crime activities, including Sergeant Frank Orte (Douglas Odney) and the resentful Honochek.\nGower's men quickly determine that Henry was a syndicate collector, and observe Rackin meeting Joe Selkin (Robert H. Harris), a syndicate troubleshooter, at the airport. They secretly begin to follow Selkin. Selkin visits Bardeman's office, accuses Bardeman of stealing the missing money, and orders him to return it by the following morning.  After Selkin leaves, Angela comforts the panicky Bardeman. She urges him to call Rackin and tell him to bring the money to Bardeman; she tells Bardeman to threaten to tell Selkin that Rackin has the money if Rackin does not bring it. Bardeman agrees to make the call. Meanwhile, when word of Selkin's visit to Bardeman reaches Gower, Gower and Orte begin to suspect that Bardeman is a frontman for the syndicate\nRackin visits Bardeman in his law office that evening without bringing the money and pulls a gun on Bardeman. When Bardeman tells Rackin that he has a way of protecting himself from such threats, Rackin shocks him by replying that he knows because Angela told him; it is the first time that Bardeman realizes that Angela and Rackin know one another. Rackin then shoots Bardeman to death and removes the audio tape from a tape recorder in Bardeman's desk drawer that Angela had told him would be making a recording of the encounter. When Angela arrives at the office the following morning, she enters Bardeman's office, sees his body on the floor, checks to make sure the tape is missing, and then collects a second tape recorder that has been running overnight and was hidden under a statue in the office. She then feigns emotional distress and calls the police.\nThat same morning, Selkin, unaware of Bardeman's death the evening before, calls Rackin and orders him to kill Bardeman for not delivering the stolen money on time. A delighted Rackin agrees, realizing that the syndicate suspects only Bardeman of having stolen its money, and does not tell Selkin that Bardeman already is dead. Immediately afterwards, Honochek brings Selkin in for questioning. Orte reports to Gower that ballistics evidence shows that the same gun killed both Henry and Bardeman, and Gower hypothesizes that someone else was involved in Henry's murder and then killed Bardeman to avoid having to split the money stolen from Henry. When Honochek reports that Selkin had called Rackin that morning, Gower informs Selkin \u2013 much to Selkin's surprise \u2013 that Bardeman had been murdered the previous evening and orders Selkin held on suspicion of homicide. Deciding that Rackin is the man who can tie together Bardeman's death with syndicate activities, Gower orders Honochek to tail Rackin.\nAngela telephones Rackin and plays the second audio tape over the phone to him; it clearly incriminates him in Bardeman's murder. When he expresses gratitude that she found it instead of the police and asks her to erase or destroy it, she informs him that instead she will give the tape to him, but only if he gives her all of the stolen money. They agree to meet at the train station to exchange the tape for the money. Meanwhile, Orte's questioning of Angela's officemates at Bardeman's law firm reveals that she entered his office every morning to retrieve and transcribe audio tapes Bardeman used for dictation, and the tape being missing on the morning Angela found Bardeman's body prompts Gower to order that Angela be brought in for further questioning. Before the police can do so, Honochek, tailing Rackin, telephones Gower to report Angela meeting with Rackin at the train station. Gower and Orte immediately drive to the train station and join up with Honochek.\nWhen Angela meets Rackin, she admits to him that she had been planning all along to double-cross him as well as Bardeman. She orders him to place the money in a locker at the train station, after which she will place the tape in the same locker. Rackin places the money in the locker, and when Angela exchanges the tape for the money, approaches her threateningly. She throws the locker key at him to force him to retrieve it rather than chase her, then runs off and gets into a taxicab, but two of Gower's detectives stop the cab almost immediately and arrest her. At the train station, Rackin gets the tape from the locker, then runs when he sees Gower, Honochek, and Orte approaching. Cornered, he pulls a gun, and Orte fatally shoots him.\nBelieving that Selkin ordered Rackin to kill Bardeman but unable to prove it with Rackin dead, Gower orders Selkin released. Gower tells Selkin to take word back to the syndicate that with him as police commissioner, organized crime activities were going to become very difficult in the future, and that the syndicate would be wise to pull out of town. Dropping Gower off at his home that evening, Honochek calls Gower \"Commissioner\" with a smile, demonstrating that Gower has earned his respect as a leader and that he no longer harbors any ill will about Gower's promotion."}, "22076195": {"title": "L\u00e9on Morin, Priest", "plot": "Barny is a young mother raising her daughter, named France, in a small town in the French Alps during the Occupation of France.

Some time afterward, Barny impulsively enters a church in town to make a fake confession. She decides to talk to L\u00e9on Morin, who, being a young curate with a name that does not strike her as bourgeois, seems most likely to take the joke in good humor. In the confessional, she attempts to provoke L\u00e9on by questioning and criticizing Catholicism, but, instead of getting offended, he engages her in a calm theological discussion. The altruistic priest offers to lend Barny some books, and they arrange a time to meet. Barny exits the church in a daze.\nFor France's protection, Barny sends the girl to live on a secluded farm.

Eventually, he knocks on Barny's door and proceeds to talk about theology as though nothing happened. She cannot focus and reaches out to touch his arm, causing him to jump out of his chair. Before leaving, he tells her that he will return for more conversation, but she must come to him at the church to confess and receive penance for trying to lead a priest astray.\nL\u00e9on learns he is being transferred to another parish, and he tells Barny.

Wile flips the signs to read \"Road-Runner\" and \"Fastius Tasty-us\", and winds up his legs, followed by his body, and chases the Road Runner. When the Road Runner sees the Coyote chasing him, he taunts him and gears into superspeed (leaving a \"TOING!\" in his wake). This causes the road to roll up, a tunnel to turn inside-out, and a bridge to compress itself as he puts his would-be predator far behind. Wile E. stops short of the chasm from the latter, panting, and two light bulbs appearing in place of his eyes signal his new-found idea.\n1. Wile E. prepares himself to chase the Road Runner with his new roller skis, and skis off the plateau down the mountain and onto the road that the Road Runner is dashing over. As the camera cuts separately to Wile and the Road Runner, the bird turns across a U-turn at the end of a cliff, while Wile speeds off. When Wile E. realizes his mistake, he drops the ski poles, and soon slams into the side of another cliff. The Coyote looks up and down, trying to figure out how to escape, until he hears and sees the Road Runner at the top of the cliff. The skis provide a rather convenient \"spring\" for Wile E., who uses them to get closer and closer to grabbing the Road Runner. On his fourth jump, he is within millimeters of his opponent; but unfortunately, the downward force proves to be too much for a fifth, and the skis snap, causing him to succumb to gravity yet again.\n2. The Road Runner beeps at Wile E. from across the canyon, and the camera pans to the Coyote attempting to shoot himself over the canyon with a bow. Before he can fire, the very end of the cliff crumbles and the bow tips over the side. Wile E. flips himself over in the air, but this causes him to bounce up and get his head stuck inside the edge of the cliff.\n3. Wile E. lights a needle-nosed dart bomb and throws it at a target attached to a cactus, exploding all three items. He then gets in a hot air balloon with an artillery of dart bombs. Once Wile E. sees the Road Runner zipping over the road he lights the darts and releases them. The bombs circle in the air but the last one lands in the Coyote's balloon, blowing it up. He waves at the camera and falls toward the ground but stops himself by releasing a parachute. Unfortunately, another dart blows this up and Wile E. is left to wave at the camera with an AGAIN sign before resuming his plummet to the bottom. After the crash landing, a third dart follows him to the ground and explodes.\n4. The darts continue to plague Wile E. from this point onwards. Wile E. gives the Road Runner a snack while he awaits with a sledgehammer behind a turn. The Road Runner is heard approaching and the Coyote gets ready to strike, but another dart plants itself into the hammerhead and blows up the handle. The hammerhead lands on the Coyote's head, causing his eyes to register \"TILT\" like a pinball machine.\n5. The Coyote hurls a boomerang at the passing Road Runner but it misses, disappears behind a rock and comes back around with another dart attached. Wile E. starts to run from the boomerang which passes him when he isn't looking. Thinking he has outrun the bomb, Coyote stops but the boomerang also stops and hovers next to him. He turns and reacts with his eyes just before it detonates.\n6. Wile E. attempts a simple gun-in-the-woods trap which fails when once again another dart plugs the barrel and explodes. Adding insult to injury, yet another dart explodes under a huge boulder which flies through the air and flattens the Coyote.\n7. As the Road Runner traverses another road, the Coyote is shown at the top edge of a cliff, getting ready to drop an anvil. Another dart takes out a third of the cliff's edge and two more darts pepper the floating end. Wile E. jumps onto the \"secure\" main cliff, but the entire cliff falls down. The Coyote pulls himself on top of the anvil to avoid getting bonked on the head with it. The anvil smashes through the ground, followed by Wile E. and the floating end of the cliff with the two darts. The Coyote prepares for the worst, but instead of exploding the darts unfurl into \"THE\" and \"END\" signs.

Bamforth realises Tojo is just another soldier, bonding over pictures of Tojo's family. Johnstone, enraged, tries to destroy the pictures but Bamforth, his frustrations boiling over, beats him up, risking a court martial. Mitchem sends Mac and Smudge to reconnoiter.

The friendly Guido tells Roslyn and Isabelle about his unfinished house in the country by Pyramid Lake. Later that day, the group drives out to the unfinished house Guido has built for his late wife. After drinking and dancing, Roslyn has had too much to drink, so Gaylord drives her home to Reno.\nEventually, Roslyn and Gaylord move into Guido's half-finished house and work on finishing it. One day, Gaylord tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his children, whom he has not seen for years. Later, he discovers rabbits have been eating the lettuce in the garden they have planted. Gay wants to kill the rabbits with his shotgun, an idea that Roslyn opposes.\nWhen Guido and Isabelle show up, Guido suggests that they round up wild mustangs to sell. They go to a local rodeo to hire a third man. They run into Perce Howland, a cowboy friend of Gaylord's, who wants to compete in the rodeo. Gaylord offers to pay the broke Perce's $10 entry fee if he will help round up mustangs the next day.\nAt the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap.

She avoids the issue.\nThe next day, Gaylord, Guido and Perce go after the mustangs, with Roslyn reluctantly tagging along. Guido uses his biplane to flush out the horses from the mountains, and it turns out that there are only five of them, a stallion and four mares. Perce says that it is barely worth it to pursue so few horses.\nRoslyn becomes upset when she learns that they will be slaughtered for dog food. Gaylord tells Roslyn that he has always caught mustangs and that they used to be in immense herds, and that they made fine riding horses.

Spillet expresses a sense of respect and admiration for Nemo's genius and principles against war, while Harding derides him for being a madman, someone who killed numerous sailors during his crusade. Using one of the charts, the castaways are able to determine their location and proceed with the construction of a boat on which they can escape the island.\nOne day, Mary, Elena and Spillet encounter a giant flightless bird, belonging to a prehistoric species called Phorusrhacos. Spillet and the women retreat, while the bird attacks. As it tries to eat Elena, Herbert arrives and apparently kills the creature. Later, as they consume the bird, they discover it was actually killed by a bullet none of them had fired.\nA few weeks later, Herbert and Elena are sunning outside when they notice a rivulet of honey. Atop a rocky bluff, they come across a hive of giant bees. While escaping from the hive into a large flooded cave, Herbert and Elena spot the Nautilus. They enter the vessel, but knowing that it belongs to someone else, retreat, swimming out of the cave. Meanwhile, Harding, Spillet, Neb, Mary and Pencroft spot an approaching pirate ship. They try to hide, but are discovered, and a fight ensues. The castaways prevail only after an explosion mysteriously sinks the pirate ship with all hands aboard.\nOnce outside, the castaways reunite and meet Captain Nemo, who is living aboard his disabled submarine. Nemo has been watching the castaways and secretly assisting them by sending the chest, shooting the giant bird, and sinking the pirate ship. He invites them to dinner aboard the Nautilus. There, they find out that the giant creatures are results of Nemo's genetic experiments to enlarge the world's food resources, thereby eliminating hunger and economic competition which he sees as prime causes for the wars he was striving to end all his life. Due to their fortitude, he has selected them to assist him in his efforts to make his achievements known to the world, especially since the Nautilus is incapacitated beyond repair and the volcano will soon erupt, destroying the island.\nWhen time runs out, the castaways discover that Nemo has invented an air-filled raising system which can refloat the pirate ship, the only readily seaworthy vessel on the island. Nemo teaches them to breathe underwater using his special \"shell\" air tanks, and they work to raise the ship, despite interference by a giant Ammonite. With the pirate ship raised and seaworthy, the castaways set sail. The volcano erupts and Nemo is killed as the Nautilus is buried.

However, the most vital detail \u2013 that Ernie will serve as a decoy target for German intelligence \u2013 is conveniently withheld from him.\nThe situation gradually begins to unravel when Lady Margaret (Dana Wynter), MacKenzie's wife, returns prematurely from a war bond tour in Canada to inform MacKenzie of her intention to divorce him, having tired of his neglect of her and his womanizing. As the result of Ernie's attempts to greet her with innocent marital affection, Lady Margaret quickly recognizes him as an impostor and is out of necessity made familiar with the situation. Taking pity on Ernie, she tells him more private details about MacKenzie which help complement his disguise. However, German intelligence continues its liquidation attempts, which result in Twickenham getting poisoned and a sniping attempt during a rallying speech to the troops, prompting Margaret to tell Ernie the entire truth. However, while trying to hand in his resignation from the project, Ernie and Margaret learn that the plane MacKenzie was travelling on was shot down by the Germans, with all hands lost, forcing Ernie to carry on the charade.\nAt a regimental party where Ernie is supposed to participate, the Secret Service intends to expose and apprehend a traitor who has been feeding information about MacKenzie to the Germans; one of his agents is revealed to be Captain Patterson (Allan Cuthbertson). During the party, Ernie is very nearly exposed as an impostor by his usual blunders and MacKenzie's aggressively domineering aunt, Lady Vivian (Margaret Rutherford). Acting upon Lady Margaret's advice, he pretends to be drunk and have a fight with his wife in order to have an excuse for leaving the party early. Afterwards, in private, Ernie and Margaret confess that they have developed feelings for each other, but then Ernie receives a message that the traitor was apparently caught and that he is ordered back to Headquarters. On his way there, he is kidnapped by Captain Patterson and Sergeant Bridget Stanhope (Diana Dors), MacKenzie's driver and mistress as well as Patterson's accomplice.\nErnie is flown to Berlin and interrogated about the Allied invasion plans, and his German captors refuse to believe his desperate attempts to explain that he is a mere decoy. Forced to go along with the game, he begins to blab about non-existent invasion plots, which the Germans readily take for the truth. Once left alone, Ernie acquires a list of German agents in Britain and facilitates his escape from German Headquarters. Chased through the streets of Berlin in the midst of a nocturnal bombing raid, he keeps changing disguises on the proverbial run, including a brief stint as Adolf Hitler and a subsequent cabaret act in a Berlin nightclub as \"Fr\u00e4ulein Lilli\" (in the style of Marlene Dietrich as Lola-Lola in The Blue Angel, singing a mash-up of the various running gag catchphrases that have been in use throughout the film in a Germanicized English word salad, all to the tune of the 1934 song Cocktails for Two.)\nFinally, disguised as a pilot, Ernie boards a German bomber bound for England and manages to parachute out. Captured, he is brought to General Wiffingham (Rex Evans), a friend of MacKenzie's, but as he reads him the names on his list, Ernie discovers to his dismay that Wiffingham is the chief Nazi infiltrator within the British Secret Service. Somerset has in the meantime figured out Wiffingham's true allegiance on his own, and rescues Ernie before Wiffingham can have him silenced via summary execution by firing squad for espionage. The invasion proceeds smoothly, and what appears to be MacKenzie surprisingly returns from the dead, only to reveal himself to Margaret as Ernie, and the two end the film confessing their love for each other.", "tmdb_id": 55863}, "19233591": {"title": "On the Fiddle", "plot": "During the Second World War, spiv Horace Pope is taken to court for street peddling.

Ray Makonnen are ordered to investigate.\nDuring the search, their spaceship suffers damage from a meteor shower, requiring that both men go outside to make repairs. A bullet-sized particle, however, pierces the air hose on Chapman's space suit, rendering him unconscious. Makonnen is able to repair the hose, but as he opens the airlock hatch, he is fatally struck by a similar particle. Makonnen's last act before being propelled into deep space is to push Chapman inside and close the airlock hatch. Chapman comes to and finds Makonnen gone and himself unable to communicate with the lunar base. He records a log entry about the preceding events, noting that he now must make a forced landing on an asteroid, that it is somehow pulling in his Pegasus spaceship.\nExiting his ship while still feeling the effects of the accident, Chapman collapses and sees tiny humanoids about six inches tall approaching. Once his helmet visor is opened, he can breathe but shrinks to their size due to the asteroid's atmosphere. He is taken underground.\nSesom, the aged and wise ruler of Rheton (the native name for the rocky and seemingly lifeless planetoid where Chapman has landed), explains that though his craft was brought down safely by their gravitational tractor beam, they had not been able to do same with the preceding Earth spaceships that came near, which were completely destroyed, along with their crews, when they crashed on Rheton's surface. He informs Chapman that he never can leave but will have all the rights of a citizen of Rheton. As he slept, Chapman's spaceship was sent into space to keep Rheton's existence a secret, and more importantly, their world's gravitational technology, which allows the Rhetonians to navigate their world through space.\nChapman meets two beautiful women: Sesom's smugly spoiled blond daughter Liara and the gentle but mute black-haired Zetha. Liara is more than willing to answer his many questions about Rheton. Sesom informs Chapman that he later may marry one of the women once he has become accustomed to living on Rheton.\nLiara, after following and engaging constantly with Chapman, declares her love for him, but Chapman, still eager to return to his own people, quietly rejects her. Herron, a young man who is in love with Liara, attempts to win her for himself by lying to Sesom, telling him Chapman is attempting to win over both women.\nStating that he believes this to be a crime against the people of Rheton, Herron requests a duel to the death. Chapman agrees, and the two engage in a form of combat where opponents must push each other onto gravity plates that cause immediate disintegration when touched. Just as Chapman is about to push Herron onto a plate, he lets Herron go, stating that he cannot kill someone for no reason.\nAs time goes on, Chapman and the mute Zetha become acquainted and eventually fall in love. Herron comes to Chapman late one night and offers to help him escape.\nAny plans for the future, however, are put on hold when Chapman discovers the reason for Rheton's erratic course through space: It is because the planetoid is being attacked by the Solarites, an alien race of \"fire people\" from an unidentified \"sun satellite\". They want to destroy Rheton with their flaming fighter craft so they can steal its secret of gravitational control.\nWith Chapman's help, Sesom and Herron destroy the enemy fleet using a gravity beam. During the battle, a giant 7-inch tall Solarite prisoner, captured during a previous raid, escapes when the gravity barrier holding him fails. Stalking corridors, the creature captures Zetha, who previously had been traumatized into silence by a childhood encounter with the savage species.

Tetsuji shows up, having discovered earlier that there was a medical mix-up and that he only has a mild ulcer, and Wang arrives, causing Tetsuji to run away, although he is in no danger because Wang discovered that he was paid in counterfeit money and would therefore not kill the boss.

As he remonstrates with his copy of Van Gogh's self-portrait on his wall, the floor creaks and the statue falls through, luckily missing his landlady below.\nIn his office attire he goes to a local cafe seeking a coffee \"with no froth\". This annoys the owner, who tells Tony he has just bought an expensive froth-making machine. Inspired by a poster on the wall Tony decides to go to Paris. He takes a train to Dover with his Aphrodite on a flat-bed wagon to the rear. She loses her head as the train goes through a tunnel. When, on arrival at the port, Tony sees the headless statue he is furious, but worse is to follow. While being loaded onto a ship it proves too heavy for its net, bursts through the bottom and is lost in the sea. Forced to accept the inevitable, he resolves to start again in Paris. On the ferry he throws his bowler hat and umbrella into the sea. Unfortunately it is raining heavily when he arrives in France.\nArriving in Paris, Tony walks along the River Seine and looks at the artists. In the evening he goes to a cafe in Montmartre and meets a group of English-speaking artists. Here he meets Paul, who speaks passionately about art. He orders a half litre of vin ordinaire and they drink together. Paul invites Tony to share his studio and flat, just up the road. The landlady Madame Laurent hears them enter and demands the rent. Tony loves the atmosphere in the studio. Tony is asked to critique Paul's paintings ... \"Your colours are the wrong shape\" he says.\nPaul admires the childlike style of Tony's work: \"infantile art\". Josey, a red-haired, blue-lipped beatnik visits and invites Tony and Paul to a very large mansion, filled with artwork. Here the Dal\u00ed-esque owner, Jim Smith, is sleeping on the bookcase (because he is writing a book). At a party a group of young people all dressed alike hang on Tony's every word. They all think he is fantastic.\nInspired by Jim Smith, Tony starts sleeping on top of the wardrobe and brings a cow to live in the flat. He then tries his first Action painting. Paul decides to leave, and gifts Tony his art.\nAs his reputation spreads he is visited by Sir Charles Broward, an art collector and buyer who is attracted to Paul's work. Sir Charles asks Tony if Paul's works are his and Tony says they were \"a gift\". This is misinterpreted. Tony's own work is labelled awful. After the first exhibition he goes to a posh restaurant with Sir Charles. He orders egg and chips... when pushed to choose something more he orders snails, egg and chips and a cup of tea. Sir Charles takes Tony to Monte Carlo, where he goes to dinner with a number of rich guests. One wife, Mrs Carreras, wishes to be painted by Tony. Her husband, after some debate, commissions a sculpture.\nTony injures his fingers while hammering and later at dinner the wife hand feeds him, much to the embarrassment of all. Carreras offers to buy Tony's entire art collection for \u00a350,000.\nOn the Carreras yacht, Tony dresses as a bird for the fancy dress party. Mrs Carreras dresses as a cat. She tells him she loves him. He rejects her and she threatens to shoot him. On deck, he unveils the statue to the horror of all - it turns out to be a copy of his Aphrodite - and Mrs Carreras accuses him of assaulting her. The statue drops through the ship and Tony escapes on the yacht's launch.\nStill dressed as a bird, Tony goes to the airport and says he wants to fly to Britain. \"Wouldn't you rather take a plane?\" the attendant quips.\nHe returns to Mrs Cravat's, now finding Paul living with her and working in an office, though still painting as a hobby. Tony persuades Paul to lend him some new paintings, promising to explain later. Showing these paintings at the London exhibition, Tony reveals that Paul is the true artist and \"the rubbish\" is Tony's work. Leaving Paul to enjoy his newfound fame and fortune Tony returns to Mrs Cravat's and resumes work on his Aphrodite - with Mrs Cravat as the model.", "tmdb_id": 87977}, "39561870": {"title": "The Red Detachment of Women (1961 film)", "plot": "In September 1930, the Communist Party of China set up a division in Hainan Island, which contained a company of female soldiers called the Red Detachment of Women.

The Inspector gets word from Washington D.C. that a female representative of the Syndicate, Mrs. Pizarro is currently in Europe to meet up with the European criminals, and that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is sending Special Agent Joe Como to liaise with the German authorities. Lohmann visits a prison to have a meeting with one of the prisoners, Alberto Sandro, who was a member of the European criminal organisation in an unsuccessful bid to learn more about the upcoming events.\nMrs. Pizarro is murdered by a flame thrower with Inspector Lohmann dodging questions from female reporter Maria Sabrehm who happens to be near the location of the murder, as is Joe Como. The only witness is a blind man who recalls the distinctive sound of a man with a wooden leg before he felt the heat of the flamethrower. Lohmann discovers a book on the charred body of Mrs. Pizarro called The Devil's Anatomy written by Reverend Briefenstein of St. Thomas Church.

The brainwashed manager then proceeds to rob the bank, as Campos monitors the happenings. It later unfolds that Campos has a liking for Elisa; he then asks his henchmen to kidnap her.

While Jaffe is working, his superior Johnny Ryde brings orders from their boss, Gloria Henderson. She wants their smut inventory moved to a safer location than Jaffe's storeroom. Jaffe promises to do so after finishing that day's shoot. However, almost immediately after Johnny leaves, the police raid his studio, arrest everyone, and seize all the films and pictures.\nBack at the police station, Carson and Stone are berated by their superior, demanding quicker action in exposing the racket.

Shaken, Romaine leaves thinking of his own two daughters.\nGloria is visited by Johnny, who informs her of the recent police raid.

The fight moves outside, surrounded by onlookers. Dirk observes from afar. Back inside, Jake negotiates the purchase of more smut pictures from Janet, an agent of the pornography ring.

He is flirting with a woman, and the two kiss, but then he strips off her clothes and stabs her to death.\nIn the police station, Carson and Stone talk about the type of women who get mixed up in pornography rackets: 'Mary Smiths' from 'Everywhere, USA' who graduate at the top of their class, were once great in a school play, come to Hollywood seeking stardom, and are afraid to return home a failure. The film follows the path of one Mary Smith. Before being offered work by Johnny Ryde, the inexperienced actress was rejected by film studios and talent agents. Excited, Mary agrees to work for him. She receives money for her expenses long before filming starts. One day, she's called to \"audition\" for a hostile Gloria, who criticizes both Mary and Johnny for wasting money to trick Mary into agreeing to do any work to pay back the debt.

He offers them a \"sentimental\" Priceline for the ship. And they give Captain Haddock fifteen days to think it over.  \nWhile touring Istanbul, there are several attempts on their lives, and determined to find out what is going on Haddock decides to keep the ship. One of the clauses of Paparanic's will was that on accepting the ship, they also fulfill its current obligations so after hiring 3 crewmen - Angorapoulos, Attila and Yefima, they set off for Athens to deliver the cargo. During the journey Tintin catches Angorapoulos (Marcel Bozzuffi) searching through the papers Tintin found. Tintin beats him up, and locks him in a room. But then later, they find that one of the lifeboats has gone, and Anorapoulos escaped.\nIn Athens, Tintin and Haddock go to the carpet seller Midas Papos (Dar\u00edo Moreno), who turns out to be another of Paparanic's old shipmates. Grief-stricken to learn of his friend's death, he is shot by a man through the window before he can relate any information. Caught holding the gun, Tintin and Haddock are arrested but released thanks to the arrival of the policemen Thomson and Thompson, and on Papos' word, who is alive and recovering in hospital.\nTintin finds an old newspaper article showing that in their youth, Paparanic, Papos, Karabine, plus two strangers, were adventurers who were involved in a coup in the Latin American republic of Tetaragua, and formed a short-lived government. The article includes a photo of the five men.\nTintin later spots Angorapoulos in a barber's shop and follows him to the local offices of Karexport, which is run by Karabine. Trailing him by car, Tintin, Snowy and Haddock follow him to a village in the countryside where Angorapoulous and some accomplices kidnap a musician at a wedding. Chasing them on a motorbike, the crooks' car is forced off the road, and the villains flee on foot. Saving the kidnap victim, Scoubidouvitch (Dimos Starenios), he is revealed as the fourth man in the photo. He suffers from \"memory loss\", but for 1000 drachmas reveals that a large amount of gold is involved, and suggests that Tintin and Haddock consult the fifth man in the photo, Alexandre (Charles Vanel) who now lives in a monastery in Meteora.\nTravelling there, they find the former adventurer is now Father Alexandre, as he has repented and become a monk. He reveals the rest of the Tetaragua story: when forced out, they'd taken a large quantity of gold from the central bank, and that Captain Paparanic had kept half while the others split the rest. Before departing, Father Alexandre gives Tintin and Haddock a bottle of wine which Paparanic gave him while visiting him last Christmas, and told him to drink only after his death. When Haddock accidentally breaks the bottle, the label is discovered to be a map to the location of Paparanic's gold.\nTintin and Haddock return to the Golden Fleece, where Professor Cuthbert Calculus has arrived to join them. Secretly, Yefima drains the fuel to prevent the ship from leaving port, but Tintin discovers him and throws him overboard in another bout of judo. Fortunately, Calculus has invented a special tablet called \"Super-Cuthbertoleum\" which, mixed with the remaining fuel, is more than enough to enable the ship to reach their destination, the island of Thassika.\nThe map includes an X just off the island's coast and, using his pendulum, Calculus locates the gold's location. Diving underwater, Tintin discovers a sea-chest filled with long, oddly shaped bars of gold. No sooner have the members of the Golden Fleece got the chest out of the water that they are held at gunpoint by Karabine, Angorapoulos, Yefima and their men who'd snuck aboard. Haddock gets caught up in a fishing net, Snowy gets tied up and Tintin is shot at and falls back into the water, left for dead. The companions are locked in a cabin, and explosives placed to blow up the ship.\nKarabine and his men take the chest back to their helicopter only to come under attack by the police, including Thomson and Thompson, led by Attila who is revealed to be an undercover police officer. Karabine gets aboard the helicopter, which suddenly takes off; Tintin has dispatched the pilot and is flying. Karabine pulls a gun, but Tintin disarms him. Beaten, the crook declares that no-one will get the gold, opens a hatch and lets the chest fall into the sea. \nThe rest of the gang surrender to the police. Aboard the ship, Snowy manages to get loose, and rolls on the fuse to put it out, saving the companions.\nWith Tintin back on board, Calculus, using his pendulum, insists that the gold is still right below them, despite the sea-chest being too deep to recover.

Meanwhile, sixteen-year-old local Fr\u00e4ulein Karin Steinhof (Christine Kaufmann) has a quarrel with her 19-year-old boyfriend, Frank Borgmann (Gerhart Lippert), on the banks of the same river. She swims back to her starting point, lights up a cigarette and strips out of her wet bikini when she is confronted by Sergeant Chuck Snyder (Frank Sutton) and gang-raped by him, Corporal Birdwell Scott (Richard Jaeckel), Private Joey Haines (Mal Sondock), and Corporal Jim Larkin (Robert Blake). (A blatant production error can be seen in the film during the rape scene when a body double substitutes for Kaufmann; the \"victim\" has short, fluffy dry hair in contrast to Kaufmann's long, straight, wet hair.) Borgmann hears her screams for help and swims across the river to help her, but he is knocked out by Snyder. After three of the men start to leave the scene, the guilt-ridden Larkin lingers behind; he covers Steinhof with his shirt before he finally flees with the other three men.\nThe men are quickly apprehended. To appease the anger and outrage of the Germans, Major General Stafford, the division commanding general, orders that their court martial be held in public in the local high school gymnasium. The prosecutor, Lieutenant Colonel Jerome Pakenham (E. G. Marshall), seeks the death penalty. Major Steve Garrett (Kirk Douglas) is assigned to defend the accused rapists. After interviewing his clients, Garrett tries to plea bargain for long sentences at hard labor, but Pakenham feels he has a strong case. Garrett starts investigating, questioning the residents. He is followed by Inge Koerner (Barbara R\u00fctting), a hostile German reporter from what Garrett considers to be a scandal-seeking newspaper.\nAt the start of the trial, three of the men plead not guilty. Larkin tries to enter a plea of guilty but is overruled by Garrett. Garrett produces an army psychiatrist who had been treating Larkin before the incident. The witness testifies that Larkin is impotent for psychological reasons. Larkin violently denies it and has to be forcibly removed from the courtroom. After the first day, Garrett pleads with Karin's bank manager father, Karl Steinhof (Hans Nielsen), to withdraw her from the trial before it is too late, stating that he will have to break her down on the stand to save his clients. He advises Herr Steinhof to take his family and leave town, but Steinhof refuses.\nAs the lead defense counsel, Garrett has no choice but to show that Karin is not as innocent as she first appeared, nor is she well liked. He also destroys the credibility of Steinhof and Borgmann by catching them in pointless little lies. As Garrett continues his cross-examination of Karin, she eventually collapses under the strain. Her father withdraws her from the trial; this action ensures that the defendants cannot be executed. The four men are convicted of rape. Three are sentenced to long terms at hard labor, and Larkin is given a shorter sentence of six years. The damage has been done, however, and the townsfolk turn against Karin.\nThough Frank Borgmann attacks him with a whip, Garrett tells him to take Karin and leave town forever. The young man takes his advice, but to raise money, he forges his mother's signature on a check. Determined to keep her son under her control, she sends the police after the couple. While Borgmann argues with the policemen, Karin runs away. Koerner, the reporter, later informs Garrett that Karin drowned herself in the river near where she had been violated.

Seaview is designed and built by scientist and engineering genius Admiral Harriman Nelson (USN-Ret). Captain Lee Crane  is the submarine's Commanding Officer. One of the on-board observers is Dr. Susan Hiller, studying crew-related stress. The mission includes being out of radio contact for 96 hours while under the Arctic ice cap. The polar ice suddenly begins to crack and melt, with boulder-size pieces sinking into the ocean around the submerged submarine (no explanation is given as to why the ice sinks). Surfacing, they discover the sky is on fire. After rescuing scientist Miguel Alvarez and his dog at Ice Floe Delta, Seaview receives a radio message from Mission Director Inspector Bergan at the Bureau of Marine Exploration. He reports that a meteor shower has pierced the Van Allen radiation belt, causing it to catch on fire, resulting in a deadly increase in the global temperature. Nelson's on-board friend and scientist, retired Commodore Lucius Emery, concurs it is possible.\nThe President summons Admiral Nelson to a UN Emergency Scientific meeting. Nelson and Commodore Emery have devised a plan to end the catastrophe. Seaview arrives in New York Harbor two days later. Nelson informs the UN that, according to their calculations, if the increasing temperature is not stopped, it will become irreversible and the Earth will die in about three weeks. The Admiral and the Commander propose extinguishing the fire by launching a nuclear missile at the burning belt from the Mariana Islands. A nuclear explosion should overwhelm and extinguish the flames, \"amputating\" the belt from the Earth. Seaview has the capability of firing the missile. The chief scientist and head delegate, Vienna's Emilio Zucco rejects the Admiral's plan as too risky. He believes the composition of the belt's gasses will cause the fire to soon burn itself out when reaching 173 degrees. Nelson disagrees with Zucco's theory, claiming that his estimated burn-out point is incorrect. Nelson and Emery's plan is rejected. The Admiral and the Commodore quickly leave the proceedings intending to get authorization directly from the President himself.\nThe Seaview races to reach the optimal firing position above the Pacific Ocean's Marianas trench in time for the needed angle of trajectory. Nelson and Crane attempt tapping the Rio-to-London telephone cable in an attempt to reach the President. During the cable tapping attempt, Crane and Alvarez battle a giant squid. They can only tap into the London cable, and Nelson learns there has been no contact with the U.S. for 35 hours.\nAn unsuccessful attempt on the Admiral's life indicates a saboteur is aboard. The rescued scientist, Miguel Alvarez, a religious zealot regarding the catastrophe, is the suspected saboteur. Dr. Hiller, who privately supports Dr Zucco's plan, is another suspect.\nOther obstacles present themselves. The Seaview's main generator is sabotaged by a crew member who lost his mind, forcing Nelson to order Crane to proceed while repairs are made despite the risk of proceeding without power for the sonar and radar. As a result, the sub narrowly escapes a minefield left over from World War II. The crew are near-mutiny, to the point that when the Seaview encounters a motor ship whose crew is dead, Captain Crane and the Admiral allow any crew members who wish to leave rather than continue the mission to leave the sub and sail the derelict home.\nCrane begins doubting the Admiral's tactics and reasoning.  A hostile, unidentified submarine pursues them, diving deep into the Mariana Trench, exceeding its crush depth; the sub implodes before it can destroy Seaview.\nThe saboteur has shut down the sub's power. Crane encounters Dr Hiller, the saboteur, atop the shark tank, as she exits the restricted nuclear reactor core. Her radiation detector badge has turned red, showing she has been exposed to a fatal dose. When asked why, she says to prevent the sub from reaching its target. Suddenly an explosion rocks the sub, throwing Dr. Hiller into the shark tank. She is killed by the sharks.\nSeaview reaches the Mariana Islands in time to carry out the Admiral's plan. He learns that temperatures are rising faster than projected, proving Zucco's theory is incorrect. Alvarez, believing it is God's will for the Earth to be destroyed, attempts to sabotage the mission by threatening to explode a bomb. The nuclear missile is launched toward the belt by Captain Crane, who launches the nuclear missile from outside the sub before Alvarez is aware.
