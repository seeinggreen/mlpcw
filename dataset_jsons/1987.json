Witek 'loses' his calling after the death of his father. Witek decides to catch a train to Warsaw. There he crashes into a fellow drinking beer. Three different outcomes are shown, each depending on how Witek deals with the obstacles on his way to catching the train and whether or not he catches the train.\nIn the first scenario, Witek almost crashes into the fellow drinking the beer. He runs after the train at the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna railway station and is able to grab onto the last car's handlebar just in time to pull himself aboard. On the train he meets Werner (Tadeusz \u0141omnicki), an old Communist. Witek decides to join the Communist Party. On a walk with Werner, Witek meets up with Czuszka (Bogus\u0142awa Pawelec), his first love. The two meet up and have sex, after which a disappointed Czuszka discovers that Witek is applying to join the party. Witek unsuccessfully tries to solve a problem with an airline mechanic. Witek breaks up a sit-in at a hospital. As a reward, a party leader plans to send Witek on a special mission to France. On a walk with Czuszka, a policeman asks them for their papers. Since Witek is a Communist, he is allowed to go on his way, while Czuszka is detained. He attempts to make up with Czuszka, who is speaking at an opposition meeting, but she rejects him. At the airport, Witek is informed that his mission to France has been cancelled.\nIn the second scenario, Witek slams into the fellow drinking the beer with such force that the mug slips from the drinker's hand and falls to the floor, breaking and spilling.

He is baptised and the figure of Christ on the cross becomes a significant emblem for him.  Witek applies for a passport to go to France, but his request is denied because he is known to be an anti-Communist. The authorities offer him a passport on the condition that he discloses the underground's contacts in France. Witek goes home and begins foreplay with Wera, but is called away to the resistance's lair. The place has been ransacked and the one person left there doubts Witek's loyalty.\n\nIn the third scenario, Witek almost crashes into the fellow drinking the beer but stops in time and goes around him, apologizing. He still tries to catch the train but fails. The railway guard shows up a few seconds later but now Witek has stopped to catch his breath.

A staff psychiatrist, Dr. Julio Denis (Lorenzo Quinteros) is surprised to hear that his ward for non-violent delusional cases has one patient too many. Denis finds the patient in the chapel playing the organ like a virtuoso. Summoning him (Hugo Soto) to his office, Denis finds the man's speech is measured and articulate as he explains his presence on Earth as a result of his image being projected from light years away. He introduces himself as \"Rant\u00e9s\" (an exotic-sounding name in Argentina). Dr. Denis suggests that Rant\u00e9s might be a fugitive hoping to hide from the law in the hospital. He lets the patient stay however, after seeing how his caring touch helps the other patients. The doctor is amused by his extraterrestrial claims and he suspects that the man is a genius using his talents as a charade.\nJulio Denis is a highly professional, lonely man, whose recent divorce left him jaded towards his life and work. Since his wife remarried, he settles for weekly outings with his two children and grainy home movies of happier times, which he views every night. Rant\u00e9s, who starts noticing the emotionally wounded Dr. Denis, is as interested in his troubles as the doctor is in Rant\u00e9s, \"the first patient in a long time\" that has interested him at all. Believing that Rant\u00e9s' claim of being a \"projected hologram\" is an allusion to Adolfo Bioy Casares' classic novel Morel's Invention, Dr. Denis concludes that this impressive genius is very well-read. The doctor soon uses his prerogatives to include Rant\u00e9s in several outings, including a visit to a touring Moscow State Circus performance.\nRant\u00e9s is no ordinary man, though. Having a psychokinetic gift, he quickly finds ways to explore the city on his own and without permission. Compassionate to a fault, he uses this gift to the benefit of the hungry, narrowly skirting the law. He spends hours standing in one of the asylum's courtyards, completely motionless, facing southeast. He claims to do this to receive \"transmissions from his planet\" and even implies that he is actually Denis' own hallucination. In narration, Dr. Denis claims that he appears to be the only physician who still notices the polite, unproblematic patient, but it's clear in a subsequent scene that he is not, since the doctor gets Rant\u00e9s a job in the pathology department of the hospital. Because of Rant\u00e9s kindness to everyone, he quickly earns the loyalty of the other patients and Dr. Denis' growing, confused respect. The doctor is aware that Rant\u00e9s has been leaving without permission and has avoided taking his medicine; nevertheless, he is impressed and he takes Rant\u00e9s' requests seriously, persuading Dr. Prieto, the head of pathology, to hire him as a volunteer assistant. Prieto (Rubens Correa) admits that Rant\u00e9s would be his first assistant in some time (having lost his previous assistant due to budget cuts), and that he finds Rant\u00e9s extremely helpful.\nSurprising everyone, Rant\u00e9s is visited by an attractive young lady, Beatriz (In\u00e9s Vernengo). She and Rant\u00e9s clearly know each other and Dr. Denis hopes she can shed light on his mysterious patient's identity. Dr. Denis introduces himself to Beatriz and quickly becomes attracted to her. She tells Denis of Rant\u00e9s' work among children in a slum, where they met while working for an evangelical mission, and especially his devotion to a young child with superior musical abilities; beyond that, she knows him as a \"very good man\" whom she is only casually acquainted with. Dr. Denis is charmed by the woman and asks Rant\u00e9s about her. He responds that she is very special and \"a Saint\".\nBeatriz invites both of them to an outdoor classical concert. During the concert, captivated by the music, Rant\u00e9s asks Beatriz to dance. The audience finds this amusing and exciting, and some of them decide to follow suit and also dance. Rant\u00e9s becomes even more entranced by the music as the orchestra plays Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He eventually persuades the conductor to let him take the baton for the symphony's iconic Ode to Joy, which confuses the musicians, leading to their refusing to play with him. After a few false starts with Rant\u00e9s trying to conduct the orchestra, the musicians eventually decide to play as Rant\u00e9s conducts them. The audience is even more amused and excited by the situation while concurrently at the asylum, the patients start to get excited and agitated and then parade the ground in a state of joy, and eventually into the town where the concert is being held. The police arrive and are about to remove Rant\u00e9s from the conducting podium when the actual conductor convinces them to not remove Rant\u00e9s. Rant\u00e9s finishes and is arrested.\nConfronted by the hospital's angry Director (David Edery), Dr. Denis is less concerned for his job than he is for his impetuous friend, whom the director orders closely monitored and strictly medicated. Dr. Denis fears this could kill Rant\u00e9s' unique personality and intellect. The director is unsympathetic and states: \"Instead of making the police blotter, Rant\u00e9s ends up in the front page next time: LUNATIC ORDERS MILITARY ATTACK\", to which Denis quickly retorts (referring to the Malvinas/Falklands War): \"That already happened, and I doubt Rant\u00e9s had anything to do with it!\".\nAffected by the medication, Rant\u00e9s broods and becomes rebellious. He seems tormented by Dr. Denis' lack of involvement, asking, \"Doctor, why have you abandoned me?\". He is also more upset by the mistreatment of other patients. After escaping again, he demands to see the director about the awful quality of the asylum's food, but is turned away. His complaints are also rejected by the local newspaper. Dr. Denis believes that Rant\u00e9s is disillusioned with mankind and may never recover, but continues the treatment. Denis convinces Beatriz to meet at his home, where they become passionate about each other and have sex. Then she confides to the doctor that she is an alien projection, like Rant\u00e9s, but assures him that she now feels emotion and can love him. Denis is livid and angrily throws her out of his home while accusing her of being a lunatic \"like Rant\u00e9s\".\nAfter Rant\u00e9s starts becoming catatonic, the Director decides to give him electroshock treatment without notifying Denis. Rant\u00e9s doesn't endure anesthesia and dies from a heart attack. The rest of the patients don't believe in Rant\u00e9s' death, as they all hope that he has only gone back to his ship for some time. From then on the patients keep waiting for Rant\u00e9s to return and take them away to his planet.

Amongst them is Sreedevi, who is honoured by the college as the best outgoing student of the year and is adorned with a gold medal. She takes it straight to Haridas, who is a senior doctor and her sponsor, who is sitting and watching the function in one corner. She tells him she is dedicating the award to him. They walk together and decide to visit to the village they belong to. They sit along the river bank and reminisce about their past.\nFlashback\nDr P.K. Haridas and his widowed mother are on their way to his uncle's home. They drive past the Nila river, where they glimpse fleetingly at a stream of devotees in white offering Karkidaka Vavu Bali (a form of Hindu ritual in which offerings are made for the deceased to attain Moksha). His uncle, Kurup, leads the family, which has his four sons, a daughter and a daughter-in-law. Haridas is their poor cousin, the one whose education was funded by the uncle and therefore continually reminded by his meek mother to be indebted to them.\nHaridas is supposed to marry Kurup's daughter Bhanu who is smart and educated. The uncle and his sons think they own him making him uncomfortable, so does their feudalistic attitude towards the lesser privileged. When a Muslim trader lashes at the uncle for using devious methods to get his shop, Haridas is more appalled by how the daughter, Bhanu, springs up in defence of her father. The eldest son, Suku is a real estate contractor, the second one moves around in political circles and the youngest, Raghu runs a medical shop. His cousins and uncle are extremely greedy.\nWhen Haridas starts his practice at the local dilapidated clinic run by his uncle, he realises that he is up against a morally corrupt system, where the facilities are poor, and also that he does not have a say in its functioning. The other doctor at the clinic, Dr. Rajan Thomas cautions him against treating pregnant women, as it's his domain. They are against his honest practice and were disappointed when he denied prescribing unnecessary medicines to the poor because it did not help his brother's pharmacy business. But Haridas is very adamant in not yielding to their dishonesty and malpractices. Even though Bhanu looks at Haridas with stars in her eyes, he dismisses her all the time.\nThe past comes to haunt Haridas when he goes to a patient at her home \u2013 a derelict Namboothiri illam. The patient is bedridden, her husband Ilethu is a temple priest and they have a daughter Sreedevi. It is when Illethu mentions their departed son Unnikrishnan, who was a promising medical student, who had died due to a sudden heart attack in the playground at his medical college, Haridas gets a jolt. Haridas mentions that Unni was a junior of his. That night he injects pethidine to ease his pain and the guilt slowly starts to eat inside him. It slowly grows into an addiction.\nHaridas grows attached to the family, often helping them. He advises Sreedevi to become a doctor, not a nurse. Meanwhile, at his uncle's home, he faces much trouble and shifts his home near the Namboothiri illam, using it as a clinic as well. Patients throng to his home and the bond between Sreedevi and Haridas becomes strong. When Bhanu arrives, she mistakes their friendship for something else and leaves the clinic in anger. But Haridas calms her down and tells her that it is his responsibility to take care of that family, as there is something in his past which she wouldn't understand. She calms down and then Haridas then drops her at her home, in front of her uncle and brothers. Meanwhile, his addiction grows and finally when his mentor, the wise old professor arrives and advises him, it is only then he stops injecting it. He discards the rest of the vials.\nOne night, a low-caste labourer calls upon Haridas as his pregnant wife is experiencing pains. He tells him that all pregnancy cases are undertaken by Dr Rajan Thomas and interfering in his domain would cause problems. But Dr Thomas does not go for the delivery and neglects them, as it is the birthday party of his child. Even after Haridas's request, he doesn't go. At last, Haridas himself tries to attend the case, but in vain. The woman dies due to severe bleeding and medical negligence by Dr Thomas. This becomes a huge issue and  Haridas is made the scapegoat, thanks to a smear campaign by his uncle and cousins. The mob throws stones at his house and breaks the windows and Haridas is injured as well.\nThe next day, Illethu arrives to check on the well-being of Haridas. Haridas learns that they were going to perform the annual funeral of their son. Illethu mentions that death due to unnatural causes need a special pooja, as the aatma keeps lingering around for salvation. Haridas requests that such a pooja be conducted for their son, as he is the one responsible for Unni's death. Haridas then reveals everything to the appalled Illethu about that fateful night.\nBack in college, Haridas was Unni's senior and all the new admissions were ragged by the unruly seniors. When Unni was staying in his room he was forced to come out. He begged them not to harass him as he was tested to have a weak heart. As Haridas wanted to show his power as a senior, he harasses Unni to strip in front of everyone and even mocks him and also the doctor who had diagnosed Unni's heart condition. Haridas repeatedly ignores his pleas. He orders him to carry him on his shoulders and go round the campus. Not able to carry Haridas's weight on his shoulders and due to the stress of ragging, Unni collapses and spits out blood. Unni writhes in pain and then dies. Horrified, Haridas tries to resuscitate him, but in vain. He panics and fumbles all over. All the students run back to their rooms when they see the professor(Haridas's mentor) arrive at the scene. Haridas falls to his legs and pleads with him not to reveal it. The management quickly covers it up as a playground accident.\nCutting to Haridas and Illethu, Haridas falls to Illethu's feet for forgiveness. Unni's family, who had earlier seen him as a saviour, now saw him as the bloodied, remorseless killer. Haridas looks on as the family finishes the last rites but totally crumbles when the mother accuses him of killing her son. Haridas, not able to live with himself tries to commit suicide. As he slits his wrist, writhing in pain and remorse, Sreedevi grabs his hands, her face swimming in tears and everything else she was holding back from him. As days go by, Sreedevi joins the Medical College with Haridas sponsoring her entire education.\nPresent day\nSreedevi and Haridas arrive at the Illam. Illethu had passed away and only the mother stayed there now. The mother extends a warm welcome to them, seeing that everything has become normal. She had forgiven him.

Their late father was a pastor who founded his own Pietistic conventicle. Lacking new converts, the aging sisters preside over a dwindling, but faithful, elderly congregation.\nThe story flashes back 49 years, showing the sisters in their youthful loveliness.

The ingredients are plentiful, sumptuous and exotic, and their arrival causes much consternation and discussion among the villagers. As the various never-before-seen ingredients arrive and preparations commence, the sisters begin to worry that the meal will become a sin of sensual luxury, if not some form of devilry. In a hasty conference, the sisters and the congregation agree to eat the meal, but to forgo speaking of any pleasure in it and to make no mention of the food during the dinner.\nMartine's former suitor, Lorens, now a famous general married to a member of the Queen's court, comes as the guest of his aunt, the local lady of the manor and a member of the old pastor's congregation. He is unaware of the other guests' austere plans and as a man of the world and former attach\u00e9 in Paris, he is the only person at the table qualified to comment on the meal. He regales the guests with abundant information about the extraordinary food and drink, comparing it to a meal he enjoyed years earlier at the famous Caf\u00e9 Anglais in Paris. Although the other celebrants refuse to comment on the earthly pleasures of their meal, Babette's gifts break down their distrust and superstitions, elevating them physically and spiritually. Old wrongs are forgiven, ancient loves are rekindled and a mystical redemption of the human spirit settles over the table.\nBereft, the sisters assume that Babette will return to Paris.

The Canadian Figure Skating Association offers to pay for her training costs and new coach, Bruce Gainor, in Toronto. Laroche's overbearing mom, Carla (Rosemary Dunsmore) is excited, while her dad, Ron (Tom Butler) is less than thrilled at the idea of their young daughter moving away from home in the middle of the school year. Reluctantly, Ron agrees. At the Peterborough Arena, Carla tells Anna Petrie (Patricia Hamilton) about the coaching change. Anna is upset, and she tells Carla both of them have been fired and the CFSA is in charge now.\nGainor's coaching techniques are tough compared to how Laroche was treated by her old coach. No matter what Gainor does, nothing will make Laroche cave to his training methods. He tells David Frye (Stuart Hughes) he's going to \"nuke\" her. Gainor signs Laroche up for Skate Hamilton. After Laroche skaters, Gainor starts to point out the flaws in her program and character until Laroche is crying and screaming. He comforts Laroche after his outburst.\nGainor and choreographer, Denise, come up with a plan for Laroche to do a triple Salchow in her program for Canadians. Even though Laroche protests, Gainor is adamant she does it. When Laroche falls, Gainor tells her, \"if you fall, you repeat the jump again and again until you get it right.\" As Denise is about to leave the ice, Gainor says he'd like to see her in his office.\nLaroche meets Donny Hackett (Stephen Marshall) in school. Laroche is walking out of a classroom after a teacher is reprimanding her for falling asleep in class. Hackett asks Laroche for an autograph, and she scribes down a profane note. Despite Laroche's snubs, Hackett keeps trying to flirt with Laroche.\nLaroche finds out her parents are splitting up after a visit with Carla. Laroche blames her mom for the divorce, and returns to the arena. Laroche walks into Gainor's office and tells him about the divorce. Gainor uses the fact that Laroche is vulnerable to his advantage. He kisses her and makes Laroche believe he is interested in her. Frye catches them just as Laroche is leaving Gainor's office.\nLaroche continues to have trouble with the triple Salchow, and eventually gets injured. Gainor yells at Laroche to try it again, and \"show me some guts for a change.\" Laroche lands it and is showered with attention by Gainor. Tara Lynn sees this and turns away. Tara Lynn compliments Laroche on the program. Then make a comment about Denise and Gainor, and their meetings, indicating they are of an intimate nature. Laroche goes to investigate, and finds Gainor and Denise fooling around. Laroche starts to lose focus and is unable to land her triple Salchow. She shows up at Hackett's garage late one night and kisses him. The next day Laroche is again unable to land her triple Salchow. Gainor starts to yell at Laroche, and Laroche screams back hysterically. After the session, Frye chasing after Gainor, and Gainor ends up firing Frye.\nBefore Canadian, Laroche must make it through sectionals. Members of the CFSA board are concerned about Laroche; however, Gainor calms their nerves about her health and the program. Hackett is in the audience with a friend. Laroche takes to the ice and enters her triple Salchow and falls. She goes away from her choreography, and repeats the jump. Again, she falls. She repeats the jump, again and again until the end of her music.\nGainor storms into the changing room and yells at Laroche. She is stone faced. He tells her she is finished, and nobody will touch her. Tara Lynn comes into the changing room and questions how Laroche could do that. Tara Lynn tells Laroche not to end her career like this. Laroche is greeted on the ice by Hackett driving through the back entrance of the arena. They drive to a motel. At the motel, it's indicated they have sex and smoke pot. The owner of the hotel calls the cops on them, and Hackett and Laroche are allegedly arrest. Gainor and Carmody wait outside the police station arguing about what happened with Laroche's career. Laroche exits the police station, and Carmody begs her not to quit skating. Laroche says just wants to go home.\nLaroche moves back home to live with Carla and her sister, Kyra (Alyson Court) in a two-bedroom apartment. Laroche visits Anne at the Peterborough Arena and tells her what happened. Anne tells Laroche \"they loved the gift, but not the gifted one.\" Laroche eventually goes through a depression and tells Carla it's her fault she doesn't have anything else in her life but figure skating. Carla tells Laroche figure skating destroyed her marriage, so she doesn't have anything else either. Eventually, Laroche starts to work and become herself again. Hackett shows up at the donut show where she works to see if she still is interested in him. They get back together.\nAfter watching the 1986 World Figure Skating Championships, Laroche apologizes to her mom for everything. One night, Laroche goes to the Peterborough Arena to try and skate again. She realizes how much she misses it. Laroche asks Frye to be her coach. He agrees.\nAt sectionals, even though Laroche can land a triple Salchow, she falls on her first jump, a double Axel, in the beginning of her program and becomes injured. As a result, Laroche doesn't qualify for the Canadians. Frye meets with Carmody and Betty Widmer (Wanda Cannon) of the CFSA to see if she can get a bye. Widmer wants her to have the bye; however, Carmody is not so sure.\nLaroche is given the bye and attends the 1987 Canadian Figure Skating Championships. She meets up with Tara Lynn, who is current Canadian champion. Tara Lynn tells Laroche she doesn't stand a chance. Laroche is the last skater, and she is waiting in the changing room when Gainor walks in. At first, he says he's there to wish her luck. Then, Gainor tries to mentally sabotage her. She tells him it won't work and he lost out with one of Canada's top skaters. Laroche tells him after she skates nobody will want anything to do with him. Laroche leaves Gainor in the changing room.\nFrye prepares Laroche to take the ice as Carmody, Widmer, Carla, Kyra, Ron, Anna, and Donny look on from the audience. Gainor, Denise and Tara Lynn are watching Laroche from the Kiss and Cry. Laroche skates her program, and Gainor looks on in amazement at her improvement. Laroche's final jump is a one-foot axel \u2013 split jump \u2013 triple Salchow sequence. Tara Lynn is shown crying into Gainor's jacket while he consoles.

Kavitha and her family are sent out of the village by the brother's mother due to this refusal. She also prohibits her sons to visit that uncle's family on any personal cause.\nWell educated and beautiful, Kavitha is initially arranged to marry a wealthy man, Mohankumar, who happens to be the heir of a rich Garments company in Tirupur, where the brothers work.

Eventually, Kavitha falls in love with the honest Chinna Thambi, meanwhile Periya Thambi happens to rescue a widow Thayamma from dire straits, and falls for her.\nThe mill owner tries to get Kavitha as his concubine and is beaten black and blue by the brothers. Chinna Thambi is jailed for 1 month as a consequence. Periya Thambi arranges for their wedding on the day of Chinna's release, and also Thayamma's family accepts for her remarriage. But on the day of the wedding, Kavitha is kidnapped by the mill owner's son and the local landlord. Periya Thambi goes to rescue her and see the owner's son attempting to rape Kavitha.

Still haunted by the past, Crist\u00f3bal attempts to revisit the event that leads to his friend's murder by talking with those close to Santiago. Their memories take them to the time of the crime.\nOn the day he was eventually killed, Santiago Nasar had a dream about birds that his mother mistakenly took as an omen of good health. Six months before, a handsome, young foreigner had come to the town. His name is Bayardo San Rom\u00e1n. Little is known about him except that he is very rich and in want of a wife. Bayardo is soon smitten by the extraordinary beauty of a local girl, Angela Vicario. She is uninterested in his advances, but Bayardo does whatever it takes to win her approval by showering her with gifts. The next time Bayardo sees her, she is selling tickets for a raffle at a town event. He buys all of the remaining tickets and wins a music box, which he then has delivered to her house as a gift. Bayardo asks Angela what house she likes best, and she replies that she likes the one that belongs to the widower Xius. The widower insists that the house is not for sale, but Bayardo keeps offering more and more money until Xius gives in.\nWhen Angela protests to her parents that she does not love Bayardo, her mother dismissed her argument, telling her that love can be learned. Pressured by her family, she yields and the couple gets married with a lavish party. On the wedding night, Bayardo discovers that Angela is not a virgin and returns her to her bewildered family. Angela is beaten by her mother until she is forced to confess who the man who took her virginity was. She says that it was Santiago Nasar. Angela's brothers (who are twins) are forced by local custom to avenge the honor of the family, by taking Santiago's life.\nThe murder takes place the day after the wedding when the town is in turmoil waiting for the visit of the bishop who is crossing the city by the river. The twin brothers, Pablo and Pedro Vicario, are reluctant to commit the crime, but they have no other choice, they must kill the man who took their sister's honor. They are quite open about their intentions and the rumor about what is about to occur spreads through the town. The twins, with knives wrapped in newspaper, wait for Santiago to appear in Clotilde Armenta's shop, who gives them rum, hoping to make them so drunk that they will be unable to commit the killing. Eventually, many people learn of the murder plan, but nobody does anything to stop the brothers or warn Santiago. People in the town are divided into three sides.

His superior, Inspector Lau, orders Ko Chow, another undercover policeman, to resume the investigations. Ko Chow accepts reluctantly because during his previous undercover mission he had to arrest someone who had trusted him as a friend.\nThe robbers are holding up a jewellery factory, but someone manages to alert the police. One of the robbers, Fu, kills a policeman, starting a firefight with the approaching policemen. The gang barely escapes. The police commissioner sets up a dedicated task force to investigate the gang, under the leadership of the young inspector John Chan. A strong rivalry develops between Lau and Chan; Chan considers Lau old-fashioned and out of his depth, while Lau considers Chan inexperienced and arrogant.\nTo reach out to the gang, Chow offers them weapons for sale through the middle-man Tai Song. During the first meeting with gang member Fu they are tailed by members of the Criminal Investigation Department under the command of Chan (who is unaware that Chow is an undercover policeman). After the funeral of Chan Kam-wah, Chow meets with Lau who hands him a key to a locker in a bowling alley where the weapons will be stashed. Chow advises against handing out real guns, but Lau insists so as not to lose track of the gang.\nChow meets with his girlfriend Hung, to whom he made a marriage proposal shortly before. When Chow asks her to postpone the marriage until his case is closed, she leaves the room hysterically.\nPrior to the handover of the guns, Chow tapes a recorder around his waist. He meets with three of the gang members. Chow is patted down, but manages to distract them from the tape recorder. Fu is satisfied with the sample gun and instructs Chow to meet him again in two days at noon to buy additional guns and ammunition.\nThe next day Chow meets with Lau and asks him for additional weapons. Lau needs time to get them, but assures Chow he will deposit them two hours before the arranged handover to Fu in the bowling alley. Meanwhile Hung packs her bags to take a flight to Canada with Tso, an older business man who had offered before to leave his wife for her. When Chow learns about that on the telephone, he asks her to marry him immediately to change her mind. Hung tells him to prove he's sincere by showing up at the register office at 10:00 am the next day, but the following day she waits there in vain with her friend Rose.\nOn his way to the bowling alley, Chow is tailed by policemen. When he realises this (and since having the guns is a crime) he calls Lau. Lau tells him that the policemen are from Chan's department and orders him to proceed while he would sort out the situation with Chan. When talking to Chan he mentions Chow as an informer, but keeps his status as an undercover cop a secret. Chan refuses Lau's request to call off the tail on Chow.\nNow on his own, Chow shakes off his police pursuers at an MTR station by boarding a departing train. While getting the bag with the guns, he notices Fu at the bowling alley. As he leaves the building, the police arrive. Chow manages to escape by jumping from a window and is picked up at street level by Fu who's approaching in a car. They drive to the gang's hideout since their leader wants to meet Chow. He offers Chow the chance to participate in an upcoming big holdup.\nFu drives Chow to the airport where he meets Hung, who's about to board a plane to Canada with Tso. Chow tries to change her mind, but is arrested by the police for selling weapons (while Hung boards the plane). At the police station, Chow is beat up and tortured by Chan's men who want to know the buyer of the weapons.  Chan's superior enters the room, orders Chan's men to release Chow and calls Chan and Lau into his office. Lau admits to having given Chow the weapons for the weapons deal, but keeps quiet about Chow being an undercover cop. Since illegal possession of a firearm is a minor offense, Chan proposes that Chow participates in the holdup to catch the robbers red-handed. Lau considers that too much of a risk, but ultimately the police chief orders Chow's participation in the planned robbery.\nThere are four possible jewelry stores the gang might rob. All have weak security measures, valuable merchandise and are located at busy roads. After the robbery, the gang plans to drive to a hideout in the harbour area where a boat will pick them up the following day. The police is unaware which store will be targeted, but plans to keep several police teams on standby nearby.\nOn the eve of the robbery, the gang leader orders the participants to gather at an apartment. For security reasons, they need to spend the remaining time before the holdout together and hand in their pagers. Chow writes the address of the hideout on a piece of paper, but is unable to pass it on to his police colleagues. Chow and Fu share a room and talk about their history and future plans \u2013 Fu's wife left him and he never saw his son again, to which Chow tells him that his wife also left him and the men become increasingly close. During the night Chow reads a letter from Hung who tells him that she didn't go to Canada with Tso, but is waiting for him in Hawaii.\nThe next morning the police leadership orders the police teams out of standby since they don't expect the robbery to happen soon any longer. This is a misjudgment, as the gang leader calls his men together and designates the Tai Kong jewellery store as their target. Since the special police teams stood down, the store is only guarded by two plainclothes policemen in a patrol car. The holdup starts when four of the robbers enter the store, draw their guns, and request the jewellery. Fu and Chow wait at the entrance to keep an eye on the street while the gang leader waits in a getaway car. There Chow realises that it was Fu whom eyewitnesses described as the cop killer who started the firefight during the jewellery factory heist.\nWhen the store alarm is triggered, Big Song (one of the robbers) shoots a saleswoman. While they are trying to escape to their cars, the two policemen guarding the store open fire, wounding gang member Bill. One of the getaway cars is stopped by the police. Fu, Chow, Joe, and Big Song need to leave Bill behind under heavy fire. Joe is killed by police while Big Song tries to hot-wire another getaway car. In an audacious maneuver Fu confronts an approaching police car and kills the four policemen inside, although he gets shot into the shoulder. Chow saves Fu's life by killing the policeman who shot at Fu.\nFu, Chow, Big Song, and Bony (the fourth surviving gang member) escape with the stolen car to the hideout at the harbour, where they meet the gang leader who was already awaiting them. Meanwhile, the police find Chow's note with the address of the hideout at the scene of the firefight.\nThe leader suspects a traitor among the gang since the police arrived too quickly at the crime scene. He incriminates Chow since he only recently joined their ranks. Big Song and Fu defend Chow and a Mexican standoff emerges.\nThe police arrives and surrounds the hideout with dozens of men. When Chan requests the men to surrender, Big Song shoots at the police. They open fire and kill him. Bony tries to surrender and is shot by the gang leader for cowardice. When the boss also tries to shoot Chow and Fu, they kill him instead. Chow is wounded by a police bullet and realises his injury is fatal. He confesses to Fu that he's a cop and asks for a quick death, but Fu feels unable to kill Chow. While the police storms the hideout and arrest Fu, Chow dies next to him.

When da Silva subsequently impregnates all three of the Dom's daughters, the sugar baron is furious, but the situation becomes even more complicated when he discovers that da Silva is none other than the infamous Cobra Verde.\nAs punishment, rather than kill him or have him prosecuted, Dom Coutinho decides to send da Silva on the impossible mission of re-opening the slave trade with Western Africa.

He travels by sea to Dahomey, West Africa (present-day Benin), where he must negotiate with the fearsome King Bossa Ahadee of Dahomey (played by His Honour the Omanhene Nana Agyefi Kwame II of Nsein, a village north of the city of Axim, Ghana).\nAmazingly, da Silva succeeds in convincing the King to exchange slaves for new rifles.

As Woods comes to understand Biko's point of view, a friendship slowly develops between them.\nAfter speaking at a gathering of black South Africans outside of his banishment zone, Biko is arrested and interrogated by the South African security forces (who have been tipped off by an informer).

Suddenly a large meteorite crashes onto the property, emitting an eerie glow. Next morning, Alan Forbes, a physician who lives nearby, visits the crash-site, examining the meteorite which is a large sphere with a hard shell from which a noxious liquid oozes out. Before long, the object dissolves into glowing gelatinous liquid which seeps into the soil. Forbes wants to contact the authorities but is dissuaded by Charlie Davidson, local realtor and head of the chamber of commerce, who worries that the event will discourage the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) from building a new reservoir in the area.

Helping himself from the kitchen faucet, he has just started drinking when he is attacked and nearly killed by Frances, who has gone insane and is horribly mutating. Worried that Forbes is going to alert the authorities, Davidson and Esther arrive at the Crane farm looking for the doctor but are attacked by infected dogs who have turned feral. Esther is mauled to death and Davidson hides himself in the cellar only to be killed and seemingly devoured by Frances who had been locked in there by Nathan.  As Nathan and Cyrus examine infected cows in the shed, the cows begin to decay, revealing maggots and worms inside.  The cows explode, covering Nathan and Cyrus in insects.\nBy now Nathan and Cyrus are also infected and beginning to go insane.

There are two major gangs competing for the local drug supply: one led by Ed Zacharias, the other by brothers Jack and Tony Romero. Kersey accepts and White supplies him with weapons and information. Meanwhile, LA detectives Sid Reiner and Phil Nozaki investigate the arcade deaths.\nPaul infiltrates Zacharias' manor as a party bartender. After bugging a phone, he witnesses Zacharias murder a colleague before being discovered by him. He orders Paul to help carry out the dead body while motioning to one of his henchmen to kill Paul when they're done, but Paul kills him and escapes. Paul proceeds to kill three of Ed Zacharias' enforcers, Art Sanella, Danny Moreno and Jack Stein at a restaurant with a bomb in a wine bottle, drug dealer Max Green, and Romeros' top hitman Frank Bauggs. A few days later, White instructs Paul to go to San Pedro, where a local fisherman wharf acts as a front for Zacharias's drug operations. Breaking in, Paul kills the criminals and blows up the drug processing room with a time bomb. Nozaki reveals himself to be a corrupt cop working for Zacharias, and demands that Paul tell him who he works for, but Paul kills him. He lures Zacharias and the Romero brothers into a trap, leading to a shootout in which both cartels are completely destroyed and Zacharias is personally killed by Paul. White congratulates him, but then sets him up with a car bomb, which Paul narrowly escapes. Enraged, Paul returns to the White Manor only to find a stranger who claims to be the real Nathan White; the impersonator who hired Paul was actually a third drug lord who used him to dispose of the rival cartels. Paul is approached by two cops, who arrest him, but he recognizes them as fakes, causes their car to flip over and flees.\nTo get rid of Paul, the Nathan White impersonator kidnaps and uses Karen as a bait. Reiner waits inside Paul's apartment to kill him out of vengeance for Nozaki's alleged murder, but Paul knocks him out. He arms himself with a rifle fitted with a grenade launcher and goes to the meeting place designated by the drug lord, the parking lot of White's commercial building. After killing many of his men, Paul follows White into a roller rink and kills the rest of his gang, before confronting him and Karen on the roof. Karen breaks free and attempts to escape, but White kills her, with Paul firing his last grenade at him in return.

Unknown to the boys, Launch also entered, willing to steal the Sleeping Princess away for herself.\nWhen the gang near the castle as night falls in, the jet is attacked by ogres, causing it to crash down, and Bulma is taken to the Devil's Hand. After waking up in a bedroom, Bulma meets Lucifer himself and his butler Igor who seemingly treat her as a guest and show her to the ogre convention of the Sleeping Princess. Lucifer then revealed his true dark nature to Bulma and have her tied to a chair she sat on with vines, intending Igor to drain her of her blood through a giant syringe in order to awake the Sleeping Princess. Hearing Bulma's screams for help, Yamcha, Oolong and Puar went to the Sleeping Princess' convention, and (in disguise as ogres through Oolong and Puar's shape-shifting) wait for their opportunity to rescue their friend. Goku and Krillin ran into and fight the ogres and monsters, including a giant devil called Ghastel who is then eaten by a swamp monster while attacking them, until they drop in straight onto the bedchamber of the Sleeping Princess which they only find as a giant jewel, disrupting the convention. Then Launch arrives on her motorcycle, takes the Sleeping Princess and drives away. As Goku and Krillin chase Launch without noticing Bulma and the others, Oolong's shape-shifting wears out after five minutes, making Puar change back to herself after she sees in shock that Oolong is back to his normal self. Their disguise ruined, Yamcha, Oolong and Puar are then captured. As Launch blast her way through the ogres by firing her machine gun at them, her hair tickles her nose and she sneezes. Changed into a nice blue-haired version of herself, Launch fell off her motorcycle and landed on the ground, confused of what she is doing. Goku recovered the Sleeping Princess, but Lucifer appeared with the ogres, holding Krillin. After being given a warning which would lead to Krillin's death as a consequence, Goku forcibly returns the Sleeping Princess to Lucifer and demands his friend's release. But instead, Goku gets a beating from the ogres after a pink little devil paralyzed him by biting his tail, the source of his weakness, much to Krillin's despair over him.\nLater, Lucifer uses the light of the full moon to power up the Sleeping Princess, successfully awakening her. Outside the Devil's Hand, the gang including a battered and bruised Goku is encased in a giant wall of rock. But Goku looked at the moon and transformed into a Great Ape, smashing the wall and releasing the gang. The rampaging Goku then chases the gang, picking up Launch and attempting to devour her. Yamcha and Krillin grabbed hold of Goku's tail, weakening the Great Ape and allowing Puar to shape-shift into a pair of scissors and cut it off. Goku returns to his normal but naked self, but he did not remember anything of what he had done in his monstrous form. He also panics when he finds his tail gone, but quickly forgets about it. Back inside the castle, Lucifer inserted the Sleeping Princess in a laser cannon and prepared it to destroy the rising sun despite Bulma's pleas. Suddenly, Goku (wearing Oolong's overall pants), Krillin and Yamcha came to the rescue. While the boys fight Lucifer, Yamcha kills Igor and frees Bulma. Just as Lucifer activates the laser cannon, Goku uses the Kamehameha wave to damage it, causing the castle to collapse in the process. While the gang made a run for it, the falling cannon kills Lucifer by blasting him, the Sleeping Princess disappeared and the Devil's Hand is half-destroyed. After the sun is up with no harm, the gang is saved and Krillin acts contrite, although he does not actually apologize to Goku for his behavior. The gang then posed for peace as the unseen camera photographed them and the Devil's Hand. The two boys return to Kame House with Launch, and Roshi is very pleased. Thinking the boys have passed the test on Launch as if she were a Sleeping Princess, he takes them both on as students while he brought Launch with him to his house. At one moment, Goku and Krillin were happy with their time for training, but it then began wrong when Launch changes into her bad self with a sneeze and drives Roshi out of his house. She fires at Roshi, Goku, Krillin and Turtle until a passing fly makes her sneeze again, turning her back to her good self. Launch apologized for her actions as the surprised group then walked back from her a little bit.", "tmdb_plot": "Goku and Kuririn are given an assignment by Kame-Sen'nin: \"Retrieve the sleeping princess from Lucifer and I will take you as my students.\" But the mission proves to be more perilous than originally thought.", "tmdb_id": "39145", "wiki_id": "2944826"}, {"title": "The Drifting Classroom", "genres": ["Horror", "Science Fiction", "Mystery"], "wiki_plot": "Sixth grader Sho Takamatsu travels to school after a bitter argument with his mother Emiko.

He is going to entrust Andrew with a responsible assignment, during which Harlan should train a student named Cooper with knowledge of the Primitive History (that is, the history of the Earth before the Eternity), which Harlan has been fascinated with since childhood.\nMistakenly, Technician Harlan introduces Cooper to the Time Capsule device, which is strictly forbidden, for which he receives the punishment of being appointed Observer to the Eternity sector of the 48th century where his nemesis, Computer Finge, is in charge. There he meets a regular girl from the 48th century, No\u00ffs Lambent, who temporarily works for Finge as a secretary (this is extremely surprising for Harlan, since there are no women in Eternity). The love of Eternal and Mortal violates all plans of the Computer Twissell, who planned to close the circle of Time \u2014 to send Cooper's student in the 24th century, where he should, under the name of the great scientist Vikkor Mullanson (whom Eternity considered its founder) to open the temporal field and create the first devices that allow one to travel in Time which will create Eternity in the 27th century. This plan matured in Twissell due to the fact that he found in the archives of Eternity the so-called \"memoir of Mullanson\", where he describes his training in Eternity and sending it to the reality of the 24th century, and mentions the names of Twissel and Harlan.\nWhen Computer Finge decides to change the reality of the 48th century, where No\u00ffs comes from, Harlan asks the familiar Sociologist Voy to compute whether she is in a new reality. Learning that she is not there, he hides No\u00ffs in the Hidden Centuries, located after the 1000th, from which there is no way out of the Eternity sectors into the Reality. When the change occurs, Harlan can not get to his beloved \u2014 Time Capsule stops in the 1000th century.\nHenceforth, Andrew Harlan, Eternal to the bone, becomes an irreconcilable enemy of the Eternity and is ready to do anything to return his beloved girl, even destroy Eternity itself.", "tmdb_plot": "Directed by Andrei Yermash, and written by Isaac Asimov, Budimir Metalnikov, and Andrei Yermash, \u00abKonets vechnosti\u00bb is a 1987 Science Fiction film, starring Oleg Vavilov, Vera Sotnikova, Georgi Zhzhyonov, Sergei Yursky, Gediminas Girdvainis and Boris Ivanov.", "tmdb_id": "83005", "wiki_id": "57042881"}, {"title": "End of the Line", "genres": ["Action", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Leo Pickett and Will Haney, railroad workers in Clifford, Arkansas, find out the parent company of the Southland railroad is about to close their yard and layoff the employees, switching all future shipments to the air freight business.\nIn a last-ditch effort to save their jobs, the two men \"borrow\" a locomotive and drive it from Clifford, Arkansas, to Chicago, Illinois, to make their case to Thomas G.

Meanwhile, a man named Will (Parker), a soft-spoken but tough employee of the telephone company, also heads to the building to hook up with his girlfriend and repair the phone lines. Unfortunately for Barry, while inquiring where Elva's apartment is, he taps a boy, Decon (Theo Caesar) on the shoulder and quickly becomes the hated target of a savage, fanatical gang called the Vampires, who run the Towers. They're led by their ruthless but charismatic leader the Count (Tony Todd), who runs his gang like a cult and is seen to be indestructible by himself and his followers.\nAn attempt to kill Barry leads to the deaths of the building's security guard and Decon. With Barry's entrapment inside the building, he crosses paths with Will and makes his first reluctant ally willing to help him. They take safety in Elva's apartment but escape when the Vampires trap them. Leaving Elva behind, they find Elva's determined granddaughter Toni (Stacey Dash), visiting with her neighbors. Toni suggests they go to the apartment of Mr. Parker (Vincent), a bigoted, crippled and unstable but yet still vicious Vietnam vet the gang fears (along the way Barry is forced to kill one of the gang members leaving him with mild PTSD). Paid for his help, Parker lets the trio in (revealing he's modified a wheelchair with an arsenal of concealed weapons). Then Toni leaves to check on her grandmother, but when she arrives, she discovers Elva had been beaten and forced to reveal where Barry and Will are.\nThe Vampires, holding Elva and Toni hostage, arrive at Parker's apartment with Barry surrendering himself to save them. As Barry and Will exit, Parker and the Vampires engage in a shootout. In the midst of the gunfire, Barry, Will, and Toni escape. When Elva and Parker retreat back inside his apartment, Parker is shot in the chest and a short time later dies as Elva struggles to save him. Next, the trio head to the apartment of Chet Cole (Deon Richmond), a little boy, living with his mother, whom they heard is the only one who knows a way out of the building that no one else knows, not even the Vampires. According to Chet, the way out is in the building's basement, with Chet offering to show them, but his mother sends him to bed, leading him to sneak out.\nAfter saving them from being killed by Psycho (Robert Lee Rush), the Count's crazed relative (by knocking said gang member down an elevator shaft with a baseball bat), Chet joins the trio as they descend to the basement through the said elevator shaft. In the basement, Chet shows them the way out, but the opening is too small for either Barry or Will to fit through. Toni, however, is able to fit through (but as she is leaving, gets grabbed by a badly injured Psycho who Barry forcibly finishes off with Chet's baseball bat) and runs to get the police. But when she arrives at the station, the officers refuse to help, due to two cops being shot on a previous visit to the building.\nWhile Barry and Will wait, Will comes up with another plan. Using the money that Elva gave Barry earlier in the film, they send Chet back upstairs. With sunrise approaching, Chet litters the money out a window to the Vampires guarding the basement\ndoor to the outside. At the same time, the Count and other Vampires realize that after checking every apartment in the building the basement is the only place left to look (on entering said basement the Count is stunned to see Psycho is dead). When the money distraction works, Barry and Will escape just as the Count and his remaining Vampires arrive, and Barry is shot in the ankle.\nOutside, Will and a wounded Barry start running as they are being chased and tormented by the last of the gang (with the Count ordering his followers to let him avenge Decon and Psycho). Cornered, Will uses the one and only shot he has left in his gun to protect Barry and himself, he does this by having a final showdown with the Count. As the Count closes in, Will shoots and struggles with him, until he knocks him briefly to the ground. The Vampires are momentarily demoralized when they see the Count is not invulnerable, despite his claims he still is, with Barry using this distraction to slam a swing seat into his head until the Count collapses and dies while the other Vampires, now enraged at their leader's death prepare to gun down Barry and Will. But Elva, using Parker's machine gun, fires shots at them from the apartment window to hold them at bay. Seconds later, Toni and the police finally arrive, with the remaining gang members fleeing.

Head Counselor Tipton assigns Kikakee's most experienced counselor, Ross Stennis, to be the boys' counselor. Stennis is unhappy with this assignment, and he treats the boys harshly. He ultimately goes too far by intentionally causing \"Moose\" Jones, the smallest boy in the group, to nearly drown in the lake while swimming. After Moose is rescued by Ernest, the boys retaliate against Stennis's cruelty by toppling his lifeguard perch into the lake, breaking Stennis' leg in the process. Since Stennis is no longer able to perform his duties as a counselor, and because Kikakee is already shorthanded, Tipton offers Stennis' position to Ernest. The trouble does not stop, as Pennington and his friends, other campers who harass Ernest, also target the new arrivals.\nThe Second Chancers initially give Ernest trouble, but they start to show some respect during a campfire session when Nurse St. Cloud, the Chief's granddaughter, translates her grandfather's description of the warrior initiation ritual for his tribe. The initiate must hold still while a knife, a stone hatchet, and an arrow are thrown or shot at him. The courage of the young warrior apparently alters the course of each weapon to prevent it from striking him. The Second Chancers later build a tepee only to see it get burned. They fight Pennington and his friends, because they were responsible for the fire. Tipton is poised to expel the Second Chancers, but Ernest convinces him otherwise.\nMeanwhile, a mining corporation run by Sherman Krader wants to mine the petrocite at Kikakee, but Chief St. Cloud refuses to sell. Upon realizing that the Chief does not even understand English, Krader manipulates Ernest into obtaining the Chief's signature under false pretenses.

The German Commandant gives them a welcome speech, assuring the new arrivals that the place is a work camp. Other SS officers move along the assembled lines of prisoners, selecting a small number who have trade skills (such as goldsmiths, seamstresses, shoemakers, and tailors). The remaining prisoners are sent away to a different part of the camp from which a pillar of smoke rises day and night. It is some time before the new prisoners realise that Sobibor is a death camp; all of the other Jews are exterminated in gas chambers, and their corpses are cremated in large ovens. The small number of prisoners kept alive in the other part of the camp are charged with sorting the belongings taken from those who are murdered and then repairing the shoes, recycling the clothing, and melting down any silver or gold to make jewellery for the SS officers. Despite their usefulness, these surviving prisoners' existence is precarious; beatings and murders can occur at any time.\nGustav Wagner is the most clever and sadistic of the German officers. When two prisoners escape from a work detail in the nearby forest, Wagner forces the remaining thirteen prisoners of the work gang to each select one other prisoner to die with them (under the threat that if they refuse, he will select fifty) and then executes all twenty six.\nThe leader of the prisoners, Leon Feldhendler, realises that when the trains eventually stop coming, the camp will have outlived its usefulness, and all the remaining Jews will be murdered. He devises a plan for every prisoner to escape, by luring the SS officers and NCOs into the prisoners' barracks and work huts one by one and killing them as quietly as possible. Once all the Germans are dead, the prisoners will assemble into columns and simply march out of the camp as if they have been ordered to, and it is hoped that the Ukrainian Guards, not knowing what is going on, and with no Germans left alive to give orders or raise the alarm, will not interfere. A new group of prisoners arrives: Russian Jews who were soldiers with the Soviet army. Their leader, Sasha Pechersky, and his men, willingly join the revolt, their military skills proving invaluable.\nThe Camp Kommandant leaves for several days, taking Wagner with him, which proves an advantage as the most sadistic of the SS officers will be absent. On 14 October 1943, the plan goes into action. One by one, SS officers and NCOs are lured into traps set by groups of prisoners armed with knives and clubs. Eleven Germans are killed, but one officer, Karl Frenzel, unwittingly evades his killers, discovers the corpse of one of his colleagues, and raises the alarm. By now, the prisoners have assembled on the parade ground and, realising the plan has been discovered, Pechersky and Feldhendler urge the prisoners to revolt and flee the camp. Most of the 600 prisoners stampede for the perimeter fences, some of the Jews using captured rifles to shoot their way through the Ukrainian guards. Other guards open fire with machine guns from observation towers, cutting many of the fleeing prisoners down, and other would-be escapees are killed on the minefield surrounding the camp. But over 300 Jews reach the forest and escape.\nAs the survivors flee deeper into the forest, famed newscaster Howard K. Smith narrates the fates that befell some of the survivors on whose accounts the film was based. Of the 300 prisoners who escaped, only approximately 50 survived to see the end of the war in 1945.

As a joke, Bryan reaches his hands out but fails to pull Keith up as he splashes around. He pokes fun at Keith for being scared, unaware that Keith is not as good of a swimmer has he bragged about. When Gordon and Kate return to the cottage, they find that Bryan has rowed back to shore and called the police, and that Keith has drowned on the lake. Gordon sobs hysterically and hugs Keith's corpse, and the parents are made to take Bryan to a local sheriff's station for questioning. Bryan breaks down and admits to letting Keith die, and is kept in juvenile detention as a result.

Bryan is kept on house arrest until his court trial, and he tries to asphyxiate himself in the family car, only for Kate to rescue him.\nIt is decided that Bryan can return home for good only if his family gets the necessary counselling to deal with the incident. During the counselling sessions, Gordon admits to favouriting Keith over Bryan, an act that he now realizes was child abuse, and that his physical and mental treatment of Bryan had been abusive, as well. He also reveals that his own childhood upbringing was unpleasant and cruel, which may have influenced how he raised his two sons.

After saving Charlene and shooting the pimp, Rizzoli notices all the money used for the buy is missing. Delgadillo retreats to a warehouse in Los Angeles where a family of Asian immigrants is preparing plastic envelopes of imported cocaine stamped with the gang's brand name \"Fatal Beauty\". One worker, however, has been sampling too much of the drug and, in his intoxicated state, prepares envelopes with a fatally high concentration of cocaine and a misaligned stamp. Delgadillo discovers the error but before they can correct it, the house is attacked by two small-time hoods, Leo Nova and Earl Skinner (Brad Dourif and Mike Jolly) who kill everyone within including Delgadillo and steal the lethal product.\nBack at the police station, Rizzoli is chewed out by her boss, Lt. Kellerman (John P. Ryan), for ruining the bust. He receives a call saying Rizzoli is needed at the warehouse where the drugs were being made. At the warehouse Rizzoli identifies Delgadillo (the only victim authorities weren't able to identify because his face was mutilated during the attack) by pointing out the diamond pinkie ring on his finger bearing his initials that he showed Rizzoli earlier that evening. Rizzoli also discovers traces of \"Fatal Beauty\" and Charlie Dawson's body, which was stuffed in a van labeled \"Kroll Enterprises\". The next morning Rizzoli receives a call from Charlene, asking for money. When Rizzoli refuses, Charlene offers some information about the drug-related murder the previous night, hoping to sway Rizzoli to give her the money. Charlene tells Rizzoli that there is a goon squad looking for the killers. She also tells her that the person, to whom all the drugs belonged, drove a \"Rolls.\" That prompts Rizzoli to pay a visit to Conrad Kroll (Harris Yulin), whom she accuses of drug dealing.\nAfter leaving Kroll's home, Rizzoli hears a call for assistance over the scanner involving a police standoff. Realizing that Charlene lives there, she immediately rushes to the location. At the location a man who is hopped up on drugs emerges from Charlene's house and shoots Rizzoli's fellow officer, Shigeda (Steve Akahoshi) in the arm, wounding him. The assembled officers all open fire on the man, but due to the drugs in his system, he doesn't go down right away. After the man finally falls to the ground and dies, Rizzoli runs into Charlene's house, where she attempts to resuscitate her with no success. Rizzoli is told by a boy at the location that both Charlene and the man who was shot, \"Big Bubba\" were both taken out by the new drugs and that they got it from Charlene's new pimp, \"Jimmy\". Rizzoli and her partner Detective Jimenez (Rub\u00e9n Blades) find him in a restaurant, where Rizzoli places him under arrest; when he tries to escape, she shoots him in the buttocks. After hanging him up in the freezer and threatening more bodily harm, Rizzoli gets him to reveal that he purchased the drugs from a buy house from a man named Rafael. Rizzoli heads to the buy house the pimp told her about and is greeted by a man named Epifanio, who tells her he will get her what she wants. She is able to get Epifanio to take her to Rafael, but a hood from the night she staged the bust with Delgadillo recognizes her as a cop and immediately alerts Nova and Skinner. Rizzoli is able to get locked in a room with Rafael, where she gets Rafael to admit he is fronting for Nova and Skinner right as two of his crew members shoot their way inside. Rizzoli dives for safety, but Rafael is killed in the crossfire. Rizzoli shoots down one of the thugs, but the other gets the drop on her, but she is saved by the timely arrival of Mike Marshak, Kroll's bodyguard (Sam Elliott) who shows up at the buy house to help Rizzoli, and admits that he has been following her around since the night before by using a transmitter concealed under her bumper.

When Jiminez goes toward the elevator he notices Nova from the mug shot carrying a package and orders him to freeze. Nova pulls out a shotgun from the package and fires at Jiminez, missing him. After getting into an argument about what Marshak's boss Kroll is allegedly doing, Rizzoli agrees to let Marshak drive her home. Rizzoli notices her cat on the roof and explains to Marshak about her cat's fear of heights and her front door being open. They both go into her residence see Zack Yeager (James LeGros) asleep. Yeager tells Rizolli that all his friends have died from using Fatal Beauty.

Rizzoli takes a shower, during which she receives a call and notices Marshak has left, and that he went through her police files of the suspects she was after. At the point Rizzoli learns that Kroll had sent Marshak not to protect Rizzoli, but to spy on her to find out who ripped him off.\nRizzoli receives a call from Cecille learning that Zack had cut his wrist and was in the hospital. Cecille asks Rizzoli to meet her at the hospital where she reveals who she bought the drugs from and that her supplier, Denny Mifflin (Neill Barry), will be making a pickup from his suppliers Nova and Skinner at Kroll Plaza. Rizzoli and Jiminez head to Kroll plaza and are spotted by Kroll's security team. Rizolli and Jiminez are watching Mifflin and Rizolli orders Jiminez to get the drugs away from some kids that they spotted Mifflin selling to. When Jiminez gets the drugs from the kids he is knocked out by one of Kroll's security men. When Kroll is alerted to Rizzoli's presence, Marshak who is with Kroll notices Nova and Skinner entering the plaza. Kroll orders one of his men to take out Nova and Skinner and then orders Marshak to take out Rizzoli. Rizzoli meanwhile notices Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and his bodyguard, Frankenstein (Mark Pellegrino) meeting together in a mall store to discuss drug distribution and follows them into the store. Rizzoli is followed into the store by Kroll's security team with their guns drawn. Just as Rizzoli is about to bust Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and Frankenstein she is accosted by Marshak who warns her it is a wipeout in which all five of them are going to be killed. Rizzoli then punches Marshak, which frightens Nova, Skinner, Mifflin and Frankenstein. When running in the store, Frankenstein is grabbed by one of the security guards. He then stabs him in the stomach. The security guard falls to the ground knocking over a rack of clothes.

Nova and Skinner race to the back of the store and shoot the fuse boxes, cutting the main power to the store lights (but the emergency lights come on seconds after). Rizzoli cautiously makes her way through the store, but the security guards get the drop on her, but she is inadvertently saved by Nova and Skinner when they gun the guards down. A short gun fight ensues between Rizzoli and the two men, but she runs out of ammunition. Nova and Skinner try to move in and finish her off, but she manages to give them the slip long enough to break into a gun cabinet and get a lever action rifle and some bullets. After Rizzoli kills Kroll's other bodyguard who was poised to ambush her from above and takes his gun, the shelf he was standing on collapses on her and Skinner prepares to kill her; at the last minute, however, Marshak appears and guns him down. Nova wounds Marshak before he, in turn, is wounded by Rizzoli, and retreats from the store. Rizzoli pursues Nova and runs into Kroll, who is about to kill her when Nova jumps out of a hiding place and kills him. Rizzoli follows Nova into a parking garage and shoots him several times, apparently unable to injure him. After Nova reveals to Rizzoli he was wearing a bullet-proof vest this whole time Rizolli pulls out a gun she stole from the dead guard and shoots Nova in the throat, killing him.\nRizzoli meets the paramedics outside the plaza, where Jiminez is waiting along with Marshak, who muses to Rizzoli that he might be going to jail for a long time because of his connection to Kroll.

The children are shut inside one of the mansion's bedrooms, with access only to the attic via a secret stairway.

Returning to the children that night, Corinne is forced to show that she has been bullwhipped by her mother as punishment for marrying her uncle and having children.

Marc Denning becomes the sole survivor of a bloody massacre which claims the lives of his lover, his brother, and three friends. Another of the women is found hung upside down in the living room, her throat cut, while the last woman is dragged out the window by a tree branch, apparently to her death. Something with glowing red eyes attacks the men. After being assaulted by a zombie-like creature whose eye he rips out, Denning stumbles to the nearby highway where he is hit by a car.\nHe wakes up in the hospital with a broken leg and three broken ribs. The police begin to investigate the murders. Shortly after the murders, Denning also begins to look for answers that will explain the slaughter.\nMeanwhile, a red-caped Tarot reader named Brother Magnus reads the cards for an unidentified Southern-accented woman. He tells her she has to leave urgently. As she does so, she is attacked by something. Then a shadowy red-eyed cowled figure appears in the doorway of Magnus's house.  He shoots at it, but the bullets bounce off. The cowled figure zaps Magnus with an energy ray.\nDenning is investigating at the library when a woman, Reggie, a survivor of a previous massacre, introduces herself. These two then travel with the detective, Lieutenant Leo Ball, to the house of a psychic, Ben, who had assisted Leo previously. Ben is identical to Brother Magnus. He has left a box of old books for Leo to examine. These include The Necronomicon, a book called Lost Gods, one called The Gate and the Key by C. D. Ward  and The Chronicles of Yog-Kothag. Denning becomes convinced that the murders are sacrifices rather than serial killings, especially when he reads a letter left by Ben that says \"He's coming back.\" Denning takes \"he\" to refer to the old god, Yog-Kothag.\nReggie and Denning join forces over coffee at Denning's house, where a sinister dog who showed up before shows up again. Leo teaches Denning to use a gun, while Denning shows him a magazine article about quasars. He has a theory that the killings coincide with pulsings of certain quasars in certain years. Leo is skeptical.\nReggie and Denning go to a movie called The Jet Benny Show.  Leo receives a document via mail which he opens and then remails to Denning. As goes to mail the envelope, Leo witnesses a boiling cloud and a ray that zaps a car. Shortly after, he is attacked by something and dies. Denning wakes from a dream, realizing Leo is in trouble and races to the scene. The police are taking Leo's body away.\nDenning maintains contact with a professor via telephone regarding the pulsing of quasars. One is set to pulse on the coming Thursday. He also realizes, after his secretary, Lisa plots the killings on a map, that the killings form a pentagram, which is the 'evil' symbol of Yog-Kothag as depicted in the Yog-Kothag book. At the center of the pentagram lies the Nash real estate agency. Denning explains that Yog-Kothag  was an old god who was 'so bad that the other gods ganged up on him and imprisoned him on a quasar.'\nThe zombie reappears and attacks Denning and Reggie. They try to kill it multiple times, thrusting a firepoker through it, hitting it with their car and finally setting its body on fire, but it comes back to life each time.  Finally, it tracks them and, after Reggie confesses she is in love with Denning, the zombie stabs Denning with a mystical dagger. Denning extracts the dagger and stabs the zombie with it.\nNash seems to witness the reappearance of Holly. She rips open her womb and takes out a baby, which falls to the ground. It appears demonic and has glowing red eyes. Slightly later Nash appears to be attacked by this baby, but then he awakes - it was only a dream.\nReggie goes to confront Nash, witnessing the sinister dog again and soon learns Nash has superhuman powers. He is resistant to bullets and is able to prevent a paperweight that she throws at his head from striking him. Nash shows Reggie the document which Leo mailed to Denning, but which never arrived. It is Nash's birth certificate, showing that he was born over a hundred years ago.  The apparent mysterious and supernatural cult dedicated to bringing Yog-Kothag back to Earth is in fact just ash, and his zombie. Together they committed a series of periodic ritual murders over the last decades. The zombie is now dead, but Nash reveals that Denning has been transformed into a new zombie. Yog-Kothag speaks through Denning with a warning. Denning then asserts himself and stabs Nash with the mystical dagger.\nThe film ends as Nash seems to be drawn screaming into the cosmic void.

Among the dead man's possessions, Preston finds a disk of polonium, which could only be useful as a component of a detonator for a bomb. He informs Harcourt-Smith, but is promptly suspended, as Harcourt-Smith believes that Preston is manufacturing a fake incident to work his way back into MI5. Preston, however has the confidence of Sir Bernard Hemmings, the gravely-ill Director of MI5, as well as Irvine, who is happy to sidestep Harcourt-Smith's directives. Preston sets to work and eventually comes across Winkler, a known Czech KGB agent, and tails him from the airport.\nMeanwhile, Petrofsky meets KGB agent Irina Vassilievna, a bomb expert who is pretending to be his wife. Under her guidance, they assemble the device from the smuggled items and she sets it on a two-hour delay as they agreed on. Unbeknownst to Petrofsky, Vassilievna follows her own orders, resetting the delay to zero. After sleeping with Petrofsky, she finds his own secret order to eliminate her and tries to warn him about the double-cross, but he kills her before she can.\nAfterwards, Petrofsky is observed contacting Winkler. Preston tracks him to Ipswich, loses him, then finds him again. Preston eventually realises that Petrofsky's target is RAF Baywaters, and locates Petrofsky's house, which lies right next to the base.\nWhen Petrofsky starts to activate the bomb, on an impulse, he checks the timer first and realises he has been betrayed. At that moment, an SAS team storms the house and during a struggle, Preston subdues and disables Petrofsky. To Preston's outrage, one of the SAS team cold-bloodedly shoots and kills Petrofsky, explaining bluntly afterwards that he had orders to do so.\nAt Hemmings' funeral, Preston is unsurprised to find Irvine secretly meeting with General Karpov. Preston had become suspicious when known KGB agent Winkler was used as a courier, making it easy to follow him, and also when Petrofsky was killed instead of being captured for questioning. He surmised that discrediting Govorshin would benefit both Irvine and Karpov (sneering to both that keeping hold over their careers is all that matters to them). Preston does not see any point in exposing them and leaves after expressing his contempt for their cynical power play (Irvine secretly assuring Karpov that they have control over Preston, as they covertly observe him reunite with his young son).", "tmdb_plot": "Led by Kim Philby, Plan Aurora is a plan that breaches the top-secret Fourth Protocol and turns the fears that shaped it into a living nightmare.

Glen catches a splinter and leaves a small amount of blood behind.\nGlen's parents leave town for three days, placing his 15-year-old sister Alexandra (\"Al\") in charge. While Al throws a party, Terry and Glen break open the geode after having discovered that it has left strange writing on a notepad, and read the incantations aloud. They go downstairs just as the party-goers are playing a levitation game. Everyone is shocked when they levitate Glen.\nThat night, Glen sees his bedroom wall stretching, and Terry embraces an apparition of his dead mother that turns out to be Glen's dog Angus, who dies as a result. The next day, Terry brings a heavy metal album to Glen's house with lyrics based on \"The Dark Book\". He believes that the hole in Glen's backyard is a gateway to a domain of evil gods, and speculates that their actions opened it. He concludes that the only missing element would be to deposit a sacrifice into the hole. Unknown to them, a friend of Al's dumps Angus's body into the hole, completing the summoning. After having read a section from \"The Dark Book\" that is supposed to close the gateway, the boys find the hole closed and assume that their efforts succeeded.\nThat night, a swarm of moths shatter Glen's bedroom window, and Angus' corpse is found in Terry's bed. Demonic arms try pulling Al under her bed; Terry and Glen barely save her. They try fleeing the house, but are greeted outside by Glen and Al's parents, actually disguised demons. After returning to the house, Al volunteers to inspect the yard, but the others see it swarming with small demons and call her back. Terry leads everyone to the basement to retrieve \"The Dark Book\", but it bursts into flames. They then attempt to stop the creatures by reading the Bible. Terry reads from Psalm 59 and the hole begins to close, but he slips and falls into the hole. Terry is attacked by the small demons before Al and Glen pull him out. Terry reads from Genesis, then throws the Bible into the hole, causing an explosion that appears to seal the hole.\nThat night, a wall breaks open and a construction worker's corpse falls through (Terry had previously lied to Glen that when his house was built, one of the workers died and the other workers had sealed him inside a wall). The worker pulls Terry into the wall, which seals behind him. Upstairs, Al notices a hazy image of the construction worker in her mirror before Glen bursts into her bedroom. Al throws a stereo at the construction worker and he disintegrates into dozens of little demons. Al holds the bedroom door shut while Glen races downstairs to find their father's gun. A demonic version of Terry appears, biting his hand before Al stabs Terry in the eye. Al and Glen hide in a closet, but the construction worker breaks through an interior wall and drags Al away.\nGlen realizes that Terry and Al represent the two human sacrifices that would fully open the gate. He also realizes that the rocket that he had given to Al for her birthday, a symbol of love, light and purity, may stop the rise of the Old Gods. He makes his way upstairs as the floor collapses, revealing a chasm beneath the house. Glen attempts to launch the rocket, but his matches keep blowing out. The wind sucks Glen onto the foyer, where a giant serpentine demon emerges. The demon pats Glen on the head and touches his hand before returning to the hole.

Cultured and well off, he belongs to the city's bourgeois society. While walking around town, Dr Fadigati meets Nora, the only daughter of one of his friends. The warmhearted doctor purchases a painting and gives it to Nora as a gift for her ailing father. Nora is the last member of the Treves, a Jewish family whose fortune has fluctuated through the years. Nora is in love with Davide Lattes, a young literature student at the university of Bologna, who dreams of becoming a writer. Davide is also Jewish and lives comfortably with his parents and young sister. Their way of life is threatened as the fascist regime of Mussolini begins to apply antisemitic measures. Davide is worried particularly after one of his university professor is laid off for being Jewish and none came to his defense. Davide's concerns are not shared by his father, who plays down the news of the persecution of Jews in Germany. The father thinks that something similar could not take place in Italy, where the Jewish community has lived undisturbed for centuries. Nora's father dies and her attitude changes as she takes over her father's business deals. She and Davide are very much in love. One night after making love, Nora is able to tell Davide that she loves him for the first time.\nDavide, as many young students in Ferrara, commutes daily  by train to the university in Bologna. Twice a week, the solitary bespectacled Fadigati takes the same train. Eventually the doctor befriends the students, some of which were his patients when they were children. There are rumors around town that the bachelor doctor is homosexual. One of the students, Eraldo, is certain that the doctor is gay and he is sometimes insolent towards Fadigati. Eraldo, an amateur boxer, invites Dr. Fadigati to see him fight. Although he dislikes boxing, the doctor accepts the invitation. At the end of the boxing match, when he goes to greet the young man, Fadigati finds Eraldo taking a shower. Eraldo is ambitious and befriends Fadigati, sharing his confidences with him. Eraldo comes from a humbler background than most of his friends. He was abandoned by his father, who emigrated to America, but has been spoiled by his mother, a housemaid who has worked hard to give him what he wants. Eraldo has never gone on vacation away from Ferrara and Dr Fadigati, smitten with him, invites him to go together to a nearby resort town.\nAt the sea-side resort town in the Adriatic coast, the pairing of Fadigati and Eraldo arouses the malicious gossip of Signora Lavezzoli, an obnoxious but influential member of  Ferrara's society. Eraldo quickly leaves the doctor alone to pursue girls. Davide, seeing Eraldo's exploitation of Fadigati and the vengeful attitude of Signora Lavezzoli, takes pity on the doctor. Carlotta, a flirty but well-intentioned friend, accompanies Davide while Nora arrives. At a gala, taking place at the local hotel, Nora is invited to dance by a fascist leader, leaving Davide alone and offended. The same night, Fadigati confronts Eraldo, who makes a scene punching the doctor in the face, leaving him bleeding and humiliated. Back in his hotel room accompanied by Davide, Fadigati discovers that Eraldo has stolen all he could. The scandal at the hotel completely destroys Fadigati's reputation.\nBack in Ferrara, the fascist regime's grip over the Jewish community tightens. Davide like all Jewish students is expelled from the university. Nora breaks definitely with him; she chooses survival over love. To escape the persecution of the Jews, she decides to convert to Catholicism and to marry her fascist suitor. Davide is left heartbroken. Marked by the scandal, the life of Dr Fadigati has completely collapsed. He is outcast by his former friends and the society of Ferrara turn its back on him. Fired from the clinic where he used to work, Fadigati is morally and economically in ruins. The doctor befriends a street dog, but he is eventually abandoned even by his pet. Only Davide comes to visit the fallen doctor. They make plans for an excursion to the river Po, but it has to be cancelled due to the rain.

Hauk adheres to strict Army guidelines in terms of humor and music programming while Dickerson is generally abusive to all enlisted men. However, Brigadier General Taylor and the other DJs quickly grow to like Cronauer and his eccentric brand of comedy.\nCronauer follows Trinh, a Vietnamese girl, to an English class; after bribing the teacher to let him take over, Cronauer instructs the students in American slang and profanity. Once class is dismissed, he tries to talk to Trinh but is stopped by her brother Tuan; realizing the futility of pursuing her, Cronauer instead befriends Tuan and takes him to Jimmy Wah's, a local GI bar.

Moments later, the building explodes, killing two soldiers and leaving Cronauer shaken. The cause of the explosion is determined to be a bomb; Dickerson declares the news censored, but Cronauer locks himself in the studio and reports it anyway, to Dickerson's outrage. Dickerson cuts off the broadcast and Cronauer is suspended, to the delight of Hauk and Dickerson. Hauk takes over the show, but his poor attempts at humor and polka music choices lead to a flood of letters and phone calls demanding that Cronauer be reinstated.\nDemoralized, Cronauer spends his time drinking and pursuing Trinh, only to be repeatedly rebuffed. At the radio station, Taylor intervenes, ordering Hauk to reinstate Cronauer, but he refuses to go back to work.

Cronauer and Garlick's Jeep hits a mine, and they are forced to hide from VC patrols. In Saigon, Tuan learns of the trip after Cronauer fails to show up for English class and steals a van to go after them. After finding them, the van breaks down and they flag down a Marine helicopter to take them back to the city.\nBack at the base, Dickerson tells Cronauer that he is off the air for good after Tuan is revealed as a VC operative known as \"Phan Duc To\" and the one responsible for the bombing of Jimmy Wah's; Dickerson has arranged for Cronauer's honorable discharge. General Taylor informs Cronauer that, regrettably, he cannot help him since his friendship with Tuan would damage the reputation of the US Army. After Cronauer leaves, Taylor informs Dickerson that he is being transferred to Guam, citing his vindictive attitude as the reason.\nCronauer chases down Tuan, decrying his actions against American soldiers. Emerging from the shadows, Tuan retorts that the US army devastated his family, thereby making the United States his enemy, but comments that he still chose to save Cronauer's life at An L\u1ed9c, implying that he valued their friendship, before disappearing again.

Mase is answered by Ueno's daughter Chizuko Ueno, who becomes excited to take the puppy in. At her insistence, Ueno adopts the dog, although Ueno's wife disapproves of them getting another dog after the death of their previous Akita, Gonsuke.\nThe puppy arrives at Shibuya Station, having been transported there from \u014cdate via a two-day train ride. Chizuko chooses to go to a concert with her fiance Tsumoru rather than collect the dog. Saikichi, a servant of the Ueno family, and Kiku, who brought Gonsuke to the crematory, fetch the puppy instead. Saikichi and Kiku assume the dog to be dead, but the puppy is proven to be alive when he drinks from a saucer of milk offered by Ueno.

As they prepare to be sent into action again, a platoon of the 3d Battalion, 187th Infantry, 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile), receives five new recruits as replacements\u2014Beletsky, who constantly complains that he won't be able to remember everything he has been taught; Languilli, who is obsessed with sex and annoyed when people mispronounce his name; Washburn, a quiet, conservative man and the only African-American in the batch of replacements; Bienstock, who is outgoing and has volunteered for combat duty in Vietnam; and finally Galvan, the quietest but most promising of the new soldiers.\nTaken under the wing of their war-weary squad leader, Staff Sgt. Adam Frantz, the recruits spend their early days filling sand bags and struggling to sleep before being placed in Frantz's squad. They are then given a crash-course in battlefield skills, including everything from oral hygiene to a demonstration by a Viet Cong deserter on how skilfully enemy troops can penetrate the perimeter of U.S. defenses. Frantz does his best to prepare the new soldiers for combat, but expresses frustration before the VC deserter silently penetrates a barbed wire barrier and aims a rocket launcher at them.\nAside from the replacements, the platoon has a new commander, Lieutenant Eden, and Sergeant First Class Worcester. The platoon's machine gun team is composed of the burly Private Duffy and his mismatched, bespectacled companion, Private Gaigin. There are also three African-American veterans in the unit: Motown, \"Doc\" Johnson and Sgt. McDaniel (who has less than a month left on his tour), all of whom have first-hand knowledge of the racial discrimination still practiced in the army.\nThe new arrivals get their first, sudden taste of war when a quiet spell beside a river is interrupted by an enemy mortar bombardment. Frantz calls for counter battery fire ending the mortar fire. Several civilians are killed in the exchange and one of the replacements, Galvan, is decapitated by a bomb splinter. The death of a soldier further riles up Staff Sgt. Frantz. Soon, the platoon takes part in a major operation and is air-lifted into the A Shau Valley. Shortly after disembarking at the landing zone, they come under automatic weapons fire and a firefight ensues. The North Vietnamese soldiers withdraw after suffering at least one apparent casualty. McDaniel is also killed. This loss provokes considerable bitterness and tension from \"Doc\" Johnson, who blames Frantz for not getting the short-timer McDaniel a less dangerous assignment.\nThe battalion is ordered to reconnoiter a nearby mountain but is unexpectedly diverted and commences an assault on Hill 937 which soon grows into the Battle of Hamburger Hill as unexpectedly determined resistance is encountered. The North Vietnamese, rather than using hit-and-run tactics, as they had in previous engagements, defend well-entrenched positions. The platoon is forced to attack the hill repeatedly against stubborn opposition. Between assaults, US air-strikes steadily strip away all vegetation with napalm and white phosphorus, leaving the hill a barren, scorched wasteland. In one assault, a battle-crazed and wounded Duffy, wielding an M60, seems on the verge of carrying the day as enemy resistance begins to crumble. Botched air support by helicopter gunships causes several friendly casualties, to the horror of Lt. Eden and his radio telephone operator, Murphy. The assault fails and Duffy is among the fatalities.\nIn between attacks, the shrinking platoon tries to rest, chattering about social upheaval and unrest back home. Bienstock is devastated by a letter from his girlfriend, whose college friends have told her that it is immoral to remain with a soldier. Beletsky gets a letter on tape from his girl back home and Frantz is surprised (and moved) that she mentions his name. Sergeant Worcester describes to his comrades the alienation and hostility he encountered on his return from his previous tour of duty, along with the collapse of his marriage and how a good friend, whose son had been killed in Vietnam during the Battle of Ia Drang in 1965, had been driven to an emotional breakdown by cruel phone calls from anti-war college students, gloating over his son's death. Frantz relates a story on how he volunteered for the airborne. \"The only reason I went airborne was Collins\", he said. When orders came down for a dangerous operation, \"Collins\" refused to participate. Later, Frantz also has a confrontation with a TV reporter, telling him that he has more respect for the NVA on the hill than for the reporter.\nThe exhausted platoon continues the attempt to capture Hill 937, to no avail. The tenth assault takes place in torrential rain. Gaigin is killed, Beletsky and \"Doc\" Johnson are wounded. Before he is evacuated, Doc tells Frantz and Motown to capture the hill so that they will at least have something to be proud of but appears to succumb to his wounds moments later as a medevac helicopter lands. Beletsky, despite having received a \"million dollar wound,\" decides to return to his unit.\nThe eleventh and final assault is mounted by the remaining troops, whose bitterness and exhaustion is overcome by desperation and unit pride. The final enemy positions are overrun but the cost is heavy. Lieutenant Eden is seriously wounded, losing his arm. Murphy, Worcester, Motown, Bienstock and Languilli are killed before the few remaining troops make it to the summit. Frantz, stunned by the loss of so many friends, is dazed and wounded by an enemy bayonet. Beletsky, also wounded but enraged, leads the final push to the summit. A bleeding and weak Frantz also makes it to the top and rests by a stump alongside Beletsky and Washburn as the battlefield finally goes silent.

The chase ends when DeVries encounters a police blockade overseen by Detective Thomas Beck (Michael Nouri). DeVries is shot several times, smashes through the blockade and crashes the Ferrari he is driving. DeVries is taken to a hospital, where a doctor informs Beck and his partner, Det. Cliff Willis (Ed O'Ross) that DeVries is not expected to survive the night.\nUpon his return to LAPD headquarters, Beck and his supervisor, Lt. John Masterson (Clarence Felder), meet FBI Special Agent Lloyd Gallagher (Kyle MacLachlan), who informs them that Beck has been assigned to work with Gallagher to track down DeVries. When told of DeVries's condition, Gallagher rushes off to the hospital.\nMeanwhile, at the hospital, DeVries suddenly awakens. Disconnecting his life-support equipment, he approaches the comatose man in the next bed, Jonathan P. Miller (William Boyett). After DeVries forces Miller's mouth open, a slug-like alien emerges from DeVries' mouth and transfers itself into Miller's body. Gallagher arrives to find DeVries dead on the floor and Miller's bed abandoned. Gallagher tells Beck to put out an alert on Miller, but Beck refuses, because Miller has no criminal record.\nMiller goes to a record store where he beats the store's owner to death. He then goes to a car dealership, where he kills three men and steals a red Ferrari. He then visits a strip club, where the alien leaves Miller's body and takes over the body of a stripper named Brenda (Claudia Christian). Gallagher asks police to track Brenda when he sees her picture next to Miller's body. Brenda is then propositioned by a cat-caller, she accepts and follows him to his car. They proceed to have sex in his car which results in his death. She then takes his car. Gallagher and Beck pursue her to a rooftop, where they mortally wound her in a gun battle. As Brenda dies, Gallagher points a strangely-shaped, alien weapon at her; however, she leaps from the roof. As Masterson arrives from his house to take charge of the scene, the alien transfers itself from Brenda's dying body to Masterson's dog.\nFrustrated by Gallagher's continuing refusal to explain the strange phenomenon of ordinary citizens turning into crazed killers, Beck arrests him and puts him in a jail cell. Beck soon learns that \"Gallagher\" is an imposter, impersonating the real agent Gallagher, who is dead. When Beck confronts \"Gallagher\" with this information, \"Gallagher\" admits to being an extraterrestrial lawman and that they are in fact pursuing an alien thrill killer who has the ability to take over other's bodies. Beck dismisses the story as insane and leaves \"Gallagher\" in a jail cell at the police station.\nBack at Masterson's house, the alien leaves the dog's body and enters Masterson. In the morning, Masterson goes to the police station and seizes a number of weapons, sparking a shootout between himself and the station's police officers as he attempts to track down \"Gallagher\". Convinced of \"Gallagher's\" story due to Masterson's immunity to excessive bullet wounds, Beck releases him from jail, and the two confront Masterson. During the resulting shootout, Masterson confirms that \"Gallagher\" is an alien law enforcer named Alhague who has been pursuing the alien ever since it murdered his family and his partner on another planet. When Alhague first came to Earth, he inhabited the body of Robert Stone, a park ranger, then assumed the identity of Lloyd Gallagher after the real Gallagher was killed in a fire. Though Beck manages to stop Masterson, Alhague/Gallagher reveals that his weapon cannot kill the alien when it is inside a human body; the weapon does not work on human skin, thus requiring him to be present when it is transferring hosts. They are unable to stop the alien from abandoning Masterson's body for that of Beck's partner Willis, who then escapes the station.\nUsing Willis' credentials, the alien tries to gain access to Senator Holt (John McCann), a likely presidential candidate. Alhague/Gallagher and Beck follow Willis, and a shootout ensues between Beck and Willis. Beck is severely wounded. As Willis, the alien corners Senator Holt and enters his body before Alhague/Gallagher can stop him. \"Holt\" then calls a press conference and announces his candidacy for the presidency.

She almost sends Billy and Susie away from London but pulls them back at the last second on the train platform, when she realizes she cannot bear to be apart from them. Thus Billy stays in London for the first years of the war. Seen through the eyes of 10-year-old Billy, the \"fireworks\" provided by the Blitz (September 1940 \u2013 May 1941) every night are as exciting as they are terrifying and the ruins they leave behind are a fascinating playground for Billy and other boys his age, who are largely unsupervised.\nHis family does not see things in quite the same way as the bombs continue to drop but their will to survive brings them closer together. The nightly raids do not provide the only drama, as his older sister Dawn falls for Canadian soldier Bruce, becomes pregnant and finding her life turned upside down, soon discovers the value of her family. When their house burns down (not in an air raid but in an ordinary fire), the family moves to the bucolic Thames-side home of Grace's parents. This provides an opportunity for Billy to spend more time with his curmudgeonly grandfather, who teaches him \"the ways of the river\".\nIn the autumn of 1942, Winston Churchill delivers his famous \"end of the beginning\" speech.

The adult Billy recalls, \"In all my life, nothing ever quite matched the  perfect joy of that moment. My school lay in ruins, and the river beckoned with the promise of stolen days\".

Panicked, the cab driver seeks out a police officer to assist in the birth before searching for a public phone to call an ambulance. While he's away, the woman gives birth to a mutant baby. Recognizing it as a mutant child like those from the prior films, the officer tries to shoot and kill the infant, who reacts by killing the officer and mother. The following day, the mutant baby's corpse is found inside a Catholic church, where it dragged itself to die.\nIn a courtroom, Stephen Jarvis is pleading for the court to spare his mutant son's life, who he argues acts aggressively because it's reacting to the hostility of the people and chaos surrounding him. The baby breaks out of its cage, but Jarvis calms it, convincing the judge to spare the child and four others like him by quarantining them on a remote deserted island. After the trial, Jarvis is a social pariah, unable to work his former acting job and the child's mother, Ellen, wants to live her own life without him as if she never gave birth. Jarvis soon becomes remarkably bitter, as he can't pay his legal fees and women want nothing to do with him, afraid that he'll pass on the mutation through casual touch. Aware that the babies are still alive and the mutations were a side effect of a medication his pharmaceutical company produced, Cabot and some of his associates travel to the island. They hope to kill the babies to manufacture the drug under a new label, only for the mutant babies to kill and eat the entire party.\nFive years later, Lt. Perkins approaches Jarvis, telling him that Dr. Swenson has recruited him to launch an expedition to the island to study the babies' growth and wants Jarvis to accompany them. The trip proves to be disastrous; only Jarvis and Perkins survive - Perkins has been deserted on the island while Jarvis remains on the boat as the mutants' captive as they want to travel to Cape Vale, Florida. While traveling, Jarvis realizes that the babies grew quickly and have reached adulthood, as one of them has given birth to a baby, with the father implied to be Jarvis's son. Jarvis discerns that the mutants communicate with each other telepathically. He also determines that the only reason he's still alive is because of the existence of the ship's sailing crew's bodies and because his son has been protecting him. He also realizes that the children are traveling to find Ellen. Eventually, their ship comes across another vessel, at which point Jarvis's son throws his father overboard to save his life, expecting that the ship will pick him up.\nWhen Jarvis awakens, he finds himself held captive in Cuba but manages to convince his captors of his identity, that the mutant children pose a danger to those around them, and to get them to take him back home. Meanwhile, the children arrive in the United States, where they promptly kill several people they consider a threat to either them or Ellen while also defending a woman being attacked by killing a gang of punks. Ultimately both Jarvis and the mutants find Ellen, upon which point the mutants try to get her to take the child. Initially reluctant, Ellen accepts the child after Jarvis convinces that the mutants looked for her out of love for their child, as they're dying of measles and would be unable to care for the child and because they strongly instinctually associated her with motherhood.

In the recently established People's Republic of China, Puyi arrives as a political prisoner and war criminal at the Fushun Prison. Soon after his arrival, Puyi attempts suicide, but is quickly rescued and told he must stand trial.\n42 years earlier, in 1908, a toddler Puyi is summoned to the Forbidden City by the dying Empress Dowager Cixi. After telling him that the previous emperor had died earlier that day, Cixi tells Puyi that he is to be the next emperor. After his coronation, Puyi, frightened by his new surroundings, repeatedly expresses his wish to go home, but is denied. Despite having scores of palace eunuchs and maids to wait on him, his only real friend is his wet nurse, Ar Mo.\nAs he grows up, his upbringing is confined entirely to the imperial palace and he is prohibited from leaving. One day, he is visited by his younger brother, Pujie, who tells him he is no longer Emperor and that China has become a republic; that same day, Ar Mo is forced to leave. In 1919, the kindly Reginald Johnston is appointed as Puyi's tutor and gives him a Western-style education, and Puyi becomes increasingly desirous to leave the Forbidden City. Johnston, wary of the courtiers' expensive lifestyle, convinces Puyi that the best way of achieving this is through marriage; Puyi subsequently weds Wanrong, with Wenxiu as a secondary consort.\nPuyi then sets about reforming the Forbidden City, including expelling the thieving palace eunuchs. However, in 1924, he himself is expelled from the palace and exiled to Tientsin following the Beijing Coup. He leads a decadent life as a playboy and Anglophile, and sides with Japan after the Mukden Incident. During this time, Wenxiu divorces him, but Wanrong remains and eventually succumbs to opium addiction. In 1934, the Japanese crown him \"Emperor\" of their puppet state of Manchukuo, though his supposed political supremacy is undermined at every turn. Wanrong gives birth to a child, but the baby is murdered at birth by the Japanese and proclaimed stillborn. He remains the nominal ruler of the region until his capture by the Red Army.\nUnder the Communist re-education program for political prisoners, Puyi is coerced by his interrogators to formally renounce his forced collaboration with the Japanese invaders during the Second Sino-Japanese War. After heated discussions with Jin Yuan, the warden of the Fushun Prison, and watching a film detailing the wartime atrocities committed by the Japanese, Puyi eventually recants and is considered rehabilitated by the government; he is subsequently released in 1959.\nSeveral years later in 1967, Puyi has become a simple gardener who lives a peasant proletarian existence following the rise of Mao Zedong's cult of personality and the Cultural Revolution. On his way home from work, he happens upon a Red Guard parade, celebrating the rejection of landlordism by the communists.

They both drive back to Washington, D.C., and have a bad run-in with Kleberg's standoffish wife, who thinks he is sabotaging her husband for his own political gain.\nAfter being fired by the Congressman (through his wife's intervention), Johnson wakes up one morning to find that another Congressman has died, leaving the seat vacant. He prods a local judge who is very politically connected, Judge Alvin Wirtz (Barry Corbin), into giving him a chance to run for Congress. Judge Wirtz tells Johnson that the former Congressman's widow might run for the seat, and that he'll need $10,000 just to make it a contest. Lady Bird Johnson's father provides the $10,000, and gets confirmation that the widow will not run. Johnson then tours the hill country of Texas, bringing along his father and his wife to campaign.

The emperor, satisfied with the diplomatic services of the Prince for the country and charmed by his young wife Daisy, offers him a profitable position. The Prince is obliged to choose: either become the Great Huntsman of the Crown and receive additional land for building new factories, coal mines and manufacturing plants, or become an Ambassador of the German Empire in London. Although under the constant pressure of his wife to choose the position of an ambassador, Hans Heinrich decides to choose the position of the Great Huntsman of the Empire. Distressed, Princess Daisy later turns to the Emperor for help in order to escape from her tyrannical, cynical and obsessed husband. Upon the Kaiser's refusal, she becomes involved in a scandalous affair that would later have devastating consequences on the von Teuss family and her marriage. The Prince eventually divorced Daisy in the 1920s.\nUpon receiving the land from Wilhelm II, Hans Heinrich XV, while taking part in an event near his residential palace, decides to give the gained territories to his German loyal servant, court adviser and collaborator, Heinberg. Clever Heinberg, with obvious knowledge of the surrounding natural resources, decides to build a coal mine instead of keeping the forest intact and becomes the initiator of the newly established and later very successful company Heinberg Gruppe. Soon Heinberg exclaims that his ancestors have served the von Teuss family for decades and he shall be the last one to be a \"slave\" at his estate. The Prince, initially shocked but later comfortable with the tight situation, made a mistake that would later cost him his entire investment in the mines and affect his involvement in the Central-Western European and global trade market. Heinberg, upon becoming a shareholder, eventually would take over his entire business.\nIn 1932, the workers and the administration of the von Teuss coal mine factory complex receive distressing news: they believe that the Prince is dying at his palace in Pszczyna which became part of the newly established Second Polish Republic following World War I.

Later the entire staff blames Nelke for this and the diggers demand higher wages for the family of the deceased. The Prince, hearing the noises from the outside, states that he shall not die as more work is to be done around the industry. This worries his youngest son Bolko, who has recently fallen in love with his young stepmother Marisca, a foreign adventuress in search of a profit.\nAt the same time, Franzel, the eldest of the three sons, visits the Heinberg Gruppe manufacturing plants in Westphalia, in Germany. He tries to collaborate with Heinberg in order to win back the lost assets that were sold by the von Teuss family to pay the large debts. To fully gain the trust of Heinberg, Franzel gets secretly involved in Nazi affairs and takes loans from the banks of the Third Reich.\nFranzel and Conrad are later summoned to their father's residence to negotiate the inheritance conflict. Hans Heinrich, already paralysed and of weak health, argues that none of them should inherit such a large amount of debt therefore he decides to have another child with Marisca. This greatly angers his youngest son Bolko (already present at the residence), who is later blamed for spending all the remaining savings in casinos and other public areas. Conrad is blamed for having a homosexual relationship with Zbierski's son, thereby not being able to produce an heir, and Franzel is known to be sympathetic to Nazi policies.

The next day, he is at his parents' home and his brother Vincent, a minister, tries to console him. Elliot says he's had enough and wants to go down to Florida to find work.\nElliot is heading to Florida by train and by the time he stops outside of Atlanta, he is now a penniless vagrant. He joins a group of vagrants around a campfire that intend to rob him, but another man saves him from it. He offers Burns a chance to make some money by robbing a country store. Burns goes with the man to rob it, but tries to back out at the last second. The man holds him at gunpoint to rob the cash register, which contains only $5. The man knocks Burns out with his weapon and runs away, leaving Burns to be apprehended by local police. He is taken to court and his lawyer tells him he should plead guilty. The judge gives him a trumped up sentence of six to ten years hard labor.\nBurns is taken to the Fulton County prison camp.  It is a foul place consisting of wooden shacks, stocks, sweatboxes, and pure filth. He has iron chains attached to his legs and meets the warden, Harold Hardy, a fat, angry, and spiteful man of Irish descent who hates people from the North. Hardy calls him a \"Yankee\" and tells him to feel guilty and get used to chain gang life to make it easier on himself. He has one of his guards, Mr. Trump, escort Burns to his quarters. Burns is introduced to a foul shack of filthy, exhausted men and meets an elderly prisoner, Pappy Glue who laughs at him when he says he didn't commit the crime he was imprisoned for. He is introduced to an inedible meal of pig fat, bitter corn pone, and sorghum molasses and gags trying to eat it and gives his plate to a veteran prisoner enjoying and devouring it.\nThe next morning, the men are awakened at 5 am. Burns sleeps through the removal of the chains and is thrown on the floor by Trump. The men are taken to a quarry to dig rocks out of the ground with pick axes for 15 hours a day, with only a short lunch break of cowpeas and corn mush. A fellow prisoner, George Seals, falls over from exhaustion. Trump kicks him in the face and Seals pleads for water and to not be hit.  That night after work, Seals is hung upside down and beaten several times with a leather strap by Trump and left there overnight. By dawn, he's died from the beatings and overwork and placed in a pine box.\nThe next day, the men are digging out dirt with pick axes and Burns is struggling to \"keep the lick\" towards the end of their shift. A black prisoner sings \"There's Gold in the Ground\" to help the men keep working.  That night, the men are having their chains checked and Warden Hardy wants to smell the men to make sure they put in a good days work. He taunts Burns, asking how much he likes the chain gang, and Burns smarts off to him about Southern hospitality. He is taken by Hardy and two guards and put into a sweatbox until the next night.\nBurns is removed from the sweatbox and thrown onto the floor of the sleeping cabin. He declares to Pappy Glue he needs to get out of there.  Pappy tells him he needs to get used to the life on the chain gang because the only way he is getting out is the same way as Seals.\nSometime later the men are working on the railroad putting metal ties on the tracks with sledgehammers.  Burns notices Big Sam, a towering black prisoner, can really swing the hammer.  During a lunch break, Burns talks Big Sam into bending his shackles with the sledgehammer by hitting it against the track.  That way, Burns can slide the chains off and \"hang it on a limb\" or escape. Sam does it with the guards backs turned and Burns is in extreme pain from it.\nThat night, the men return to camp.  Burns has his chains checked by Trump and they are checked out fine. Hardy again asks Burns if he likes the chain gang, but this time, Burns obediently answers yes. In his bunk, Burns removes the shackles in front of Pappy and invites him to come along.  Pappy declines but gives him $5, wishing him luck.\nThe next day, Burns asks to \"get out here\", to relieve himself in the woods. While doing do, he removes his shackles, then makes a run for it. The guards and dogs run after him but he eludes them and takes a boat in the swamp to freedom.  Warden Hardy is furious, screaming out to Burns that he promises to find him.  Later on that day, Burns is at a train station in Marietta and just before boarding, he thinks the police are about to catch him. But instead they catch a vagrant. He boards the train and makes it across the Tennessee border.\nA year later, Burns is now living in Chicago and rents a room from Emily Pacheco, a Portuguese divorcee. She is very nice and courteous but an overly possessive woman. He types a letter to his brother Vincent about his work status and trying to get authorities to convince them of his innocence. She tells Burns to stop writing and typing so much and they go to a movie together. She keeps trying to get Burns' interest, but he's not in love with her and just doesn't feel the chemistry, but nevertheless, they sleep together after he reveals to her about trying to start a magazine business and be a statesman. He moves forward with starting the business.\nBurns receives a letter from his brother Vincent that their father is dying. He goes back to New Jersey to attend the funeral afterwards. His mother is very upset that he wasn't ever able to come back to visit. Burns arrives home and Emily is all over him begging him to marry her, but he wants alone time.\nOne day while cleaning Burns' room, Emily comes across some papers he's been typing and there are flashbacks to his time on the chain gang being put in a sweatbox and treated like an animal. Emily is disturbed at the writing. Burns makes it home that night after a very successful day of selling his first magazine subscription and she reveals the papers he's written. He's very distressed, but she consoles him and asks him to make love to her and blackmails him into marriage.\nBy 1929, Burns is making it big in Chicago as a magazine publisher and motivational speaker. He's working long hours and neglecting Emily who is becoming increasingly possessive and jealous. While speaking at a dinner engagement, Burns meets a woman named Lilian Salo.  After a few dates, he falls in love with her, much to Emily's dismay. He wants an amicable divorce, but she is furious and refuses.\nA few days later at work, Burns is apprehended by police. Georgia authorities want Burns extradited back, but his lawyer refuses.  They meet with a Georgia prison official in front of the judge assigned to hear the case.  The official says if extradition is granted, he will have to go back to Georgia and serve the remainder of his sentence, plus additional time for escaping.  But if he comes back voluntarily, he can serve a reduced term of 45 days and be paroled.  He would also serve the time as a trustee at one of the honor farms.\nBurns accepts the deal.  However, he is returned to the same Fulton County camp he escaped from where Warden Hardy is waiting for him.  When presented with the court agreement Burns signed in Chicago, Hardy says that \"he is in Georgia now and things will be done Georgia's way.\"  In the chow hall, Hardy berates Burns for his success and tells the prisoners that they are not to ever talk to him.  Hardy also tells the guards to kill Burns if he tries to escape again.\nA month later, Burns is out working and secretly asking prisoners of the whereabouts of Big Sam, the black prisoner, the helped him get away, and Pappy Glue.  It turns out that Big Sam clubbed a guard and was moved to another prison in Southern Georgia and Pappy Glue died from beatings soon after Burns escaped. Burns is angry and pauses for a few seconds and asks to wipe off the sweat, but Trump refuses to let him do so.\nThat night at dinner, Hardy reads out a list of men not doing a hard days work and for them to get their whipping. Burns is included. Burns declares it's a lie, but none of the guards or Hardy defend him. He is tied to a tree and given ten lashes.\nSome time later, Lillian comes to visit Burns assuring him of clemency, parole, or pardon. They embrace and the guards try to remove him, but he resists it and is beaten and placed in the stocks. Warden Hardy assures Burns he won't live to see himself get out despite people from up north trying to do so, and that the parole board turned him down.  Burns realizes he was duped and will have to serve the remainder of his sentence.\nBurns' brother comes to visit sometime later and tells him that his business is gone, but indirectly signals to him that there is money left from his business hidden inside a package of Lucky Strike cigarettes to help him get out. Mr. Rayford, another guard who works with Trump, detects Vincent giving Burns a package of cigarettes and wants to check it, but ends up taking a few of them for himself and gives Burns the package back. Later on, Burns finds over $100 in cash in it and feels it will be his ticket to freedom.\nBurns is back working later on and Trump has made him a trustee. Trump orders Burns to fill up the water pail while he goes in a country store to get a soda pop. While Trump is in the store, Burns talks to a local man that approaches him.  The man says he's read about Burns in the papers  and thinks he's had the short end of the stick on what has happened to him and that he would get him out if he could. Burns shows him a $50 bill and asks him to meet him the next day with his car, a hacksaw, and a change of clothes.  The man is apprehensive, knowing he risks being put on the same chain gang, but Burns promises him another $50 if he can get him over the state line.\nThe next day, Burns is working diligently and the man shows up. He asks to \"get out\" to relieve himself, and Rayford allows him to do so.  Burns immediately runs for the man's car and Rayford shoots at him for trying to escape but misses. Warden Hardy is more furious than ever, telling the guards they will lose their jobs if they don't catch him.\nSome time later, Burns is seen typing his new book which says that he is a fugitive, he moves around a lot and can't keep jobs for long. The book he is writing depicts his time on the chain gang and it's horrific conditions.  He specifically mentions the men who died while he was imprisoned and dedicates the book to them.  Burns briefly visits his brother about his situation, who tells him there are several people asking to have movie rights to the book.  Burns grants his brother Power of Attorney before disappearing into the night.\nSome time later, Burns visits his former love Lilian, who is now married.  She says she had been praying for him the entire time and she is happy to see him alive and well. He later goes to a local library to read his published book and hears on the radio that it will be made into a movie.  Burns anonymously attends a screening of the movie I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang and has flashbacks to his time there. He is satisfied to find that the movie accurately reflects what he has been through.  Phone calls, telegrams, and letters flood the Georgia Department of Corrections demanding a reform of the prison system.\nThe film ends with scenes of the Fulton County Camp now empty and abandoned.

Gwildor, a Thenorian locksmith, reveals that Skeletor has acquired his invention: a \"Cosmic Key\" that can open a portal to anywhere by utilizing musical notes. The device was stolen by Skeletor's second-in-command, Evil-Lyn, allowing Skeletor to breach Castle Grayskull.\nWith Gwildor's remaining prototype of the Key in hand, He-Man and his friends travel to the Castle. They attempt to free the Sorceress but are overwhelmed by Skeletor's army and forced to flee through Gwildor's hastily opened portal, transporting them to Earth. The Key is misplaced on their arrival and discovered by two California teenagers, orphaned high school girl Julie Winston and her boyfriend Kevin Corrigan.

He arrives in Matewan, West Virginia in 1920 to organize miners against the Stone Mountain Coal Company. His introduction to the town is his witnessing of a mob of miners angry at wage cuts beating up black miners who intended to cross the picket line. He takes up residence at a boarding house run by a coal miner's widow, Elma Radnor, and her 15-year-old son, Danny, who is also a miner and a budding Baptist preacher. The miners are reluctant to bring the imported workers, both black and Italian into their union, a cause not helped by C. E. Lively, a spy for the company within the union, who tries to goad the miners into violence and secretly informs the Baldwin\u2013Felts Detective Agency of the \"red\" Kenehan's presence.\nThe next day, two Baldwin\u2013Felts men, Hickey and Griggs, show up in town and take up residence at the Radnor boarding house. Danny at first refuses to give rooms to Hickey and Griggs, but Kenehan voluntarily moves to the hotel, freeing up a room for the two men and averting trouble for Mrs. Radnor. Hickey and Griggs then start their campaign against the union by forcibly evicting miners from company-owned houses in town. Mayor Testerman and Police Chief Sid Hatfield refuse to let them be evicted without eviction writs from Charleston. Hatfield deputizes all the men in town and tells them to go home and come back with their guns.\nThe Baldwin\u2013Felts men then turn their attention on the strikers' camp outside town, where the miners and their families are living in tents. At night, the armed strikebreakers fire shots into the camp, injuring some strikers. The next day, they enter the camp to demand that all food and clothing purchased at the company store with scrip be turned over to them, but are thwarted by the arrival of armed hill people, whose land was taken by the coal company. Expressing disdain for the noise caused by the gunmen's automobile the night before, their presence and sympathy for the miners compels the Baldwin\u2013Felts men to leave empty-handed. The slow arrival of the union's thinly stretched strike funds tests the patience of Danny Radnor and other miners who become disillusioned and turn to violence in spite of Kenehan's warnings. The miners are involved in a night-time shootout with the agents and Sephus is wounded. He is rescued by some hill people but not before he recognizes Lively as the infiltrator.\nLively tries to drive a wedge between Kenehan and the miners by convincing a young widow, Bridey Mae Tolliver, to falsely accuse Kenehan of sexual assault, and he plants a letter which makes Kenehan appear to be the infiltrator, leading the miners to plot to kill Kenehan. Danny overhears Hickey and Griggs talking about the scheme and is discovered and threatened by Hickey. That night, while preaching at the Freewill church, Danny relates a parable about Joseph that convinces the miners that they have been deceived by a false story, taking advantage of the now-inebriated detectives. Lively silently slips out of the back of the church while a miner runs to the camp to stop Few Clothes from killing Kenehan. Meanwhile, Sephus has made his way back to town and informed the others of Lively's betrayal, furiously burning down his restaurant. Lively flees town by swimming across the Tug Fork River.\nLater, while Danny and his friend Hillard Elkins are stealing coal from the mine, they are confronted by the detectives. Danny hides, while Elkins is tortured for information. He provides five names, and is killed by Griggs anyway. Lively mentions that the men he has named died in the mines years ago, and muses that the death of a young boy will complicate things.\nThe situation between the Baldwin\u2013Felts men and Chief Hatfield reaches a boiling point with the arrival of reinforcements with orders to carry out the evictions. The mayor tries to negotiate as Kenehan comes running to try to stop the fight. The sudden movement sets off a climactic gunfight between the exposed mercenaries and the armed townspeople firing from barricades and rooftops. Hatfield shoots two men and survives the battle, but Kenehan is killed and the mayor is shot in the stomach. Griggs is brought down, while Hickey escapes to Elma Radnor's boarding house, where he is shot and killed by Elma Radnor. Seven Baldwin\u2013Felts men and two townspeople are ultimately killed.\nIn the epilogue, the narrator (revealed to be an elderly Danny recalling those days in \"Bloody Mingo\") recounts that Mayor Testerman succumbed to his wounds and the mayor's wife married Chief Sid Hatfield.

Clive falls in love with his friend and surprises Maurice by confessing his feelings. At first, Maurice reacts with horror, but he soon realizes that he reciprocates Clive's feelings. The two friends embark on a passionate love affair but, at Clive's insistence, their relationship remains non-sexual. To go further, in Clive's opinion, would diminish them both.

One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction. With the next day of balance happening within a few days, at the stroke of midnight, the kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet and use it \u2013 with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary \u2013 to open a wormhole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. As shown in the film's prelude, Van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago in order to defeat his old adversary Count Dracula; his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet, where it was out of Dracula's immediate reach.\nNevertheless, Dracula seeks to obtain the amulet so that he can take over the world and plunge it into darkness. To this end, he assembles several of his most dangerous and monstrous allies: The Mummy, the Gill-man, The Wolf Man, and in addition, three school girls whom the Count transforms into his vampiric consorts. Dracula then steals a crate from a B-25 Mitchell in flight, containing Frankenstein's monster, thus completing his army. However, Frankenstein's monster is reluctant to aid Dracula, and wanders into the forest where he encounters Phoebe. Rather than being afraid, she shows him the kindness he has always sought, and they become friends. After Phoebe proves to the Monster Squad that Frankenstein's monster is not evil, he chooses to help the boys instead of Dracula. The Wolfman, when reverting to human form, is a recalcitrant follower of Dracula, and has been making calls to the police about the forthcoming carnage, which are dismissed as prank calls.\nThe amulet is buried in a stone room beneath a house that Dracula and the other monsters now occupy and where Van Helsing's diary was found. The secret room is littered with wards which prevent the monsters from taking it. The Monster Squad break into the house and acquire the amulet and narrowly escape Dracula's grasp. They confer with The Scary German Guy who informs them that the incantation must be read by a female virgin. As midnight approaches, the Squad makes their way to a local cathedral to make their last stand. Meanwhile, Dracula destroys their clubhouse with dynamite, drawing the attention of Sean's father, Police Detective Del, who has been charged with investigating the strange occurrences in town (as caused by Dracula's cohorts), but remains quite skeptical about their supernatural causes until he sees Dracula in person.\nUnfortunately, the doors to the cathedral are locked, so the incantation must be read on the stoop, leaving the Squad vulnerable.

Farrell attends an inaugural ball, invited by his college buddy Scott Pritchard, who intends to introduce him to his boss, Secretary of Defense David Brice. There, Farrell also meets Susan Atwell, and the two leave together, beginning an affair. Soon after, Brice hires Farrell to act as his eyes and ears within the CIA\u2014the agency's senior figures seem to be hiding possible intelligence failures from Congressional and White House oversight. Sam Hesselman, an old friend of Farrell's who now works as a programmer/analyst in the Pentagon's new computer center, is part of his team under Brice.\nAtwell and Farrell's affair continues, even after Atwell reveals that she's also Brice's mistress. After Atwell and Farrell return from a romantic weekend, Brice visits her unexpectedly and becomes suspicious that she has another lover. When Atwell tells Brice to leave, he becomes enraged and accidentally pushes her to her death over an upstairs railing. Brice confesses what has happened to Pritchard. He suggests that Atwell's other lover could be conflated with a suspected KGB sleeper agent, code-named \"Yuri\". For several years, different American intelligence agencies have tried to uncover Yuri within their ranks without success\u2014they and Brice are all convinced Yuri is a myth, designed by the Soviets to sow confusion and mistrust within American ranks. Pritchard argues that Atwell's murder could be spun as a matter of national security, and Yuri could be killed \"in the line of duty\" by operatives under Pritchard's control, clearing Brice from suspicion.\nAt Atwell's house, Pritchard discovers the negative of a photograph she had earlier taken of Farrell. The negative is blurry and does not show a recognizable face, but Hesselman attempts to have the image enhanced by computer, a process that may take days.\nArmy CID officers, commanded by Major Donovan, scour Atwell's apartment for evidence. Meanwhile, as his initial shock begins to wear away, Farrell realizes that Brice is the real murderer and that Pritchard is helping him cover up the crime. He also realizes that the physical evidence will make him the prime suspect. Farrell decides to play along with the bogus investigation until he can develop evidence linking Brice to Atwell, and defend himself against being charged with both murder and espionage.\nFarrell learns that one piece of evidence is a Moroccan jewel box, a gift to Atwell from Brice. As any foreign gift must be registered with the State Department, Farrell gets Hesselman to \"raid\" State's computerized registry of such items, which should link the box to Brice. However, the plan begins unraveling when Pritchard finds Atwell's address book and uses it to track down and question her friend Nina. She pretends not to recognize Farrell, but reveals that she knew that Atwell was dating Brice. Pritchard sends two former CIA assassins to eliminate her. Overhearing this, Farrell delays the assassins while warning Nina, who goes into hiding. This raises Pritchard's suspicions of Farrell.\nFarrell convinces Hesselman to delay the photo enhancement by confiding to him that Farrell is the person in the photo, that he was in love with Atwell, and that Brice killed Atwell. The CID begins a room-by-room search of the Pentagon on the grounds that Yuri is somewhere in the building, but Farrell eludes the search by climbing into a ceiling vent. Believing that Farrell is delusional, Hesselman informs Pritchard about what he knows. Hesselman is then killed by Pritchard. Farrell manages to get into Brice's office, locks the door, and confronts him with the printout of the gift registry data. Brice improvises a different story to buy Farrell's silence: Pritchard, who is gay, killed Atwell out of jealousy of Brice's relationship with her. The devastated and betrayed Pritchard realizes he's cornered and shoots himself. When the guards finally break into the locked office Brice tells them that Pritchard confessed to being Yuri, concluding the search for the spy.\nFarrell quietly sends the printout by courier to the Director of the CIA, a political rival of Brice, then leaves the Pentagon as the finished image enhancement of the photograph positively reveals Farrell as Atwell's lover. Later, Farrell is picked up by two men while sitting despondently at Atwell's grave.

Being the elder sibling, Ti-Hung took care of her younger brother while being under the charge of their aunt and uncle.\nYears passed and Ti-Hung has grown up to be a pretty young lady with excellent embroidery skills and tiny bound feet. Her feet and embroidery works got noticed by a wealthy old matriarch, Lady Li of North Gate, who offered her only grandson, Rui Yu's (Wakin Chau), hand in marriage to Ti-Hung. A fellow villager and poor fisherman, Ah Hai (Simon Yam), who is also a friend of Ti-jiang, is fond of Ti-Hung.\nIt is also made known here that Ti-Hung is born with the \"Cut Palm\" fate through a conversation from Ti-Jiang and his fellow fishermen friends. Men born with such a fate would become an official or a great person. Whereas women born with the \"cut palm\" would be a jinx to the men in their life. Ti-Hung overhears the conversation and appears to be affected by it.\nAt that same moment, Ti-Jiang dies during a drowning accident while out fishing. All alone by herself, Ti-Hung agrees to marry Rui Yu. Being married into the wealthy Hsin family would also pave her way out of poverty.\nLife was rosy for Ti-Hung after marriage and she soon gave birth to a son, Hui Chih. But happiness for her was short-lived. Rui Yu dies of pneumonia and leaves behind his 23-year-old wife with a young 5-year old child. Without the support from old Lady Li, Rui Yu's uncle volunteers to handle the family's account in the absence of his nephew. Being the only kin of Hui Chih, Ti-Hung became an over-protective and strict mother. Ti-Hung blames her bad fate for the cause of Rui Yu's early demise. However, when she found out that her late husband was meant to be short-lived through revelation from Rui Yu's uncle of a monk's predictions of Rui Yu when he was a young boy, she felt relieved.\nFree from guilt, Ti-Hung starts to enjoy her new status as mistress of the family while living off her inheritance. She got addicted to opera and neglected her duties to her family until her long time personal maid, Hsin Yue, hinted to her of the family slowly falling apart. Not only was Rui Yu's uncle the main caregiver to Hui Chih, but he was also heavily addicted to opium. Going through the family's accounts, Ti-Hung realised that Rui Yu's uncle had piled on debts through his unhealthy habit. For the safety of Hui Chih, she sent him away to Japan for further studies while she stayed back to settle issues with her uncle.\nNot long after, Rui Yu's uncle passed away and she attended his wake while feigning sorrow. Ironically, she picked up opium smoking while at the wake. From there, she took a liking to her uncle's personal young servant, Chun Shu (Tuo Chung-hua), and began an affair with him. Noticing that Chun Shu starts getting cocky after their one-night stand, Ti-Hung sets him up for theft and have him put away in a bid to silence him about their affair.\nShortly after, Ti-Hung realises that she is pregnant and tries to hide the pregnancy when a grown up Hui Chih comes back to visit his mother. Eventually, Ti-Hung comes clean to Hui Chih on her pregnancy. Hui Chih accepts it and plans to bring his mother to Japan for a vacation and deliver her child so as not to incite rumours and gossips in their hometown. The newborn is then given up for adoption in Japan.\nBack in her hometown, Ti-Hung worries about Hsin Yue's youth and marriageability.

Unbeknownst to him, the genie is released from inside and possesses the old woman's corpse, violently murdering the three burglars.\nAfter surveying the crime scene, an officer sends the evidence, including the lamp and bracelet, for display at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. From inside the lamp, the genie observes the museum's curator, Dr. Bressling, cataloguing the newly arrived artifacts. Dr. Bressling later determines the brass lamp dates back to 3500 BC. The museum archaeologist, Dr. Wallace, is visited by his teenage daughter, Alex, who surreptitiously tries on the bracelet.

Yiu observes how a member of the gang of triad boss Micky steals scissors from Ching (to use them as a weapon). Yiu notifies Ching who manages to get the scissors back, but as a consequence Yiu gets bullied by the triad members.\nDuring a cell inspection forbidden items (playing cards and improvised weapons) are found and several men from the cell (among them Yiu, Micky and Bill, the boss of another triad) are brought to ranking warden officer Hung for questioning. Hung is nicknamed \"scarface\" by the prisoners due to a characteristic scar. He tries to recruit Yiu as an informant, which he refuses. Following that Hung questions Micky, asking him to let his henchmen search for tools which went missing in the prison work shops (serving as makeshift weapons). In return Hung would transfer one of Micky's rivals to a different prison. Since someone needs to be held responsible for the improvised weapons, Micky proposes to claim that Yiu blamed one of Bill's men. Hung accepts the deal and transfers several triad members to another prison as \"punishment\".\nThe following night Yiu is dragged into the cell's lavatory by Micky's men and beaten up.

However, he was charged with murder. Their son now lives with the grandmother and regularly visits him in prison.\nThe following summer Micky is transferred back to the prison. He's still seeking revenge since being a triad boss he was never assaulted before. Yiu asks Officer Hung to move him and Ching to a different prison, but Hung brushes him off. During the next prison inspection, Yiu approaches the inspector and demands a transfer to protect them from the triads. Hung - who's also present during the inspection - denies the presence of triads among the prisoners and claims the two were having problems due to gambling debts. The warden requests a report, but ultimately Yiu and Ching have to remain in the prison.\nSome time later, the members of Bill's triad initiate a hunger strike to protest against a price surge for cigarettes. Micky's men and the other prisoners join the strike. Hung approaches Micky and demands him to stop the strike, otherwise he'd put all triad leaders in solitary confinement while telling them Micky had accused them of initiating the strike. Micky doesn't want to rat them out and instead defames Yiu as the instigator. In addition Hung whispers to Ching in the presence of the others, alluding Ching would rat on them.

Teri tells Jimmy that she will inform the NSF of the deception, but Jimmy explains that she does not have enough time because Virgil is scheduled to die soon.\nJimmy challenges Dr. Carroll (William Sadler) and others about the project's value by noting that the hypothetical pilot, knowing the implications of the second-strike scenario, would know that he is dying, and would, therefore, be affected by that knowledge. However, the chimpanzees would not be as aware; thus, the project is flawed.

The perpetrator in the hijacking case was one Peter Small, and when the four agents were suspected of having stolen the counterfeit money, they refused a lie detector test and subsequently quit the FBI. It takes Holmes and Jane not long to guess that the counterfeit money was used to pay off Small, and the four FBI agents had kept the ransom for themselves, so Small exacting revenge on his betrayers seems the most logical motive. But Small seems to stay one step ahead of them: their next candidate of the four is murdered as they try to warn him, and when the last survivor finally leads them to the cache where they have hidden the ransom money, it is already gone.\nIn the end, however, Holmes finally deduces the truth of the scheme. The culprit is actually Carter Morstan himself; soon after he and his partners had hidden the money, he had appropriated all of it for his own. Small had been killed during their struggle, and Morstan decided to kill his comrades in crime before they would discover his duplicity, and then frame Small for the murders. The burglary of Jane's office had been staged both to drive Jane into investigating the case and to hide a bug in the office to keep tabs on Jane and Holmes' progress and beat them to his former partners.

The killer was never caught. Several years later, Cosmic Pictures, headed by sleazy producer Harry Sleerek, arrives in Crippen to make a biographical movie about the crimes titled Horror High. To maximize the production's low budget, the cast and crew temporarily move into the real Crippen High School, where they are to film on location; the lead actress, Callie Cassidy, is hired to play multiple roles. In the midst of the film shoot, multiple disappearances and murders occur, which are subsequently investigated by police Chief Deyner and Officer Tyler. While the bodies are recovered from the school, Chief Deyner and Officer Tyler interview the film's screenwriter, Arthur Lyman, outside, and he recounts the events on-set:\nSome days prior, lead actor Oliver informs director Josh Forbes that he is dropping out of the production. Before leaving, he is murdered in an empty wing of the school. Harry immediately replaces Oliver with Steven Blake, a real-life police officer and former Crippen High student. Tensions on set rise when Harry insists Callie show on-screen nudity, while Arthur is forced to repeatedly make script changes to accommodate Harry's requests for more gore. One day, an extra is murdered, followed by Choo Choo, a special effects assistant. Shortly after, cast member Richard Farley is caught in a booby trap that drags his body into a steel-blade industrial fan.\nWhile wandering the high school in-between scenes, Steve recounts to Callie his relationship with his high school girlfriend, Kathy; her father, Crippen's Principal Kastleman, is on-set serving as a technical advisor, but Steve has not seen Kathy in years. Meanwhile, Callie begins noticing that cast and crew are disappearing. Fearing the killer has returned, she and Steve begin their own private investigation. Callie's discomfort is compounded one day while watching the filming of a brutal scene in which the school biology teacher, Richard Birnbaum, is dissected.\nLater, Steve notices a photo of Kathy on the set; when he inquires to Principal Kastleman about Kathy's whereabouts, he claims she is in graduate school. That night, Steve and Callie find a trail of blood in the hallway, and discover Harry and Josh's corpses, as well as a trapdoor leading to a basement. In the basement, they find a classroom full of the decomposed victims of the 1982 massacre, all posed in desks. They are confronted by Amos, the school janitor, who attacks Steve. During their fight, Steve inadvertently removes a latex mask from Amos's face, revealing him to actually be Principal Kastleman in disguise. Kastleman explains how years ago, Kathy discovered she was pregnant with Steve's child, after which Kastleman murdered her in a rage and hid her body in the school basement before killing multiple students. Callie and Steve manage to overpower Kastleman, impaling him with a javelin.\nIn the present, after Arthur finishes recounting the events to Chief Deney and Officer Tyler, the police enter the school to investigate. While they do so, Arthur calls out \"all clear\" outside, upon which all of the victims\u2013who have been laid in the grass and covered in sheets\u2013rise; they have in fact been alive all along. In reality, Callie and Steve uncovered in their research that Kastleman was in fact the true killer in the 1982 massacre, and killed him in the basement. Harry decided to capitalize on this by devising a mock massacre centered around the revelation as a publicity stunt to help promote the film. In the basement, police find Kastleman, still impaled by the javelin, but alive; he lunges at them, leading them to shoot him multiple times. When they return outside and find the bodies of the film crew inexplicably gone, they assume there is still a killer on the loose.\nLater, Arthur sits at a typewriter to compose a new screenplay he has called The Return to Horror High, which he intends as a sequel.

Kwok and Yung get into a massive fight with the local gang running the gambling hall.  The boss threatens to cut Yung's pinky off.  Fortunately Kwok tells a touching tale about how their father is ill and that is why they are gambling to support him.\nThe pair hatch a plan with their nervous cousin Mak Ying Hung (Alan Tam), who has gang connections, to rob some goods from a gang boss, Chu Lo-Tai (Ko Chun-hsiung).

The government pacifies the populace through violent TV shows; its most popular being The Running Man, a broadcast game show, where criminals fight for their lives as \"runners,\" fleeing from armed mercenaries called \"stalkers,\" to earn a government pardon and tropical vacation. \nBen Richards, a police helicopter pilot, observes a food riot in Bakersfield, California. He is ordered to open fire on them, but refuses and is subdued by his colleagues. The media blames Richards for shooting sixty people and he is sent to a prison labor camp. Eighteen months later, he escapes with two resistance fighters, Harold Weiss and William Laughlin, finding refuge in their camp, led by their leader, Mic. The resistance group looks to hijack the ICS broadcast network's uplink facilities to expose the government's lies. Richards declines to help, and then heads to his brother's apartment, only to find it is now occupied by Amber Mendez, a composer, and that his brother has been sent to a \"re-education\" camp.\nWith Mendez's security travel pass, Richards takes Mendez hostage to flee to Hawaii but is arrested at the airport when Mendez alerts security. Meanwhile, Damon Killian, the charismatic, amoral host of the deadly The Running Man game show, becomes enamored by Richards's physical prowess and notorious reputation as a murderous madman. Killian coerces Richards to participate in the show, in exchange for Weiss and Laughlin's freedom. Meanwhile, Amber sees a news report stating that Richards shot people at the airport, which she knows is untrue. As the game begins, Killian sends Weiss and Laughlin into the game-show arena with Richards, in an abandoned part of Los Angeles.

Dynamo electrocutes Weiss, just as he cracks the satellite's security, but Mendez has memorized the access code. Buzzsaw mortally wounds Laughlin, but Richards bisects Buzzsaw with his own chainsaw. Dynamo is incapacitated by Richards, who spares the stalker live on air. Laughlin tells Richards that the resistance has a hidden base in the arena before dying from his wounds. Off the air, Killian offers Richards a position as a stalker, which the enraged Richards refuses. Hunted by Fireball, a stalker with a jetpack and wielding a flamethrower, Mendez finds the corpses of the show's alleged past \"winners,\" revealing that the show's promises of pardons are all false. Richards saves Mendez and kills Fireball by sabotaging his gas tank and setting him alight with a road flare. Immediately afterward, the pair stumbles into Mic's command center.\nWith the viewership now cheering for Richards, Killian asks Captain Freedom, a retired stalker and fan favorite to join the hunt. When Captain Freedom refuses to fight using mechanical weaponry instead of his bare hands, the network doctors old footage to depict Richards and Mendez being killed by Captain Freedom. Mendez and Richards see this on TV, convincing Richards to lead resistance forces to storm the ICS control room.

She looks for the key to the secret garden, but doesn't find it, so she sits down and remembers her childhood.\nThe main story begins in colonial India with the young, neglected, and selfish Mary Lennox (Gennie James) waking in the night to find her servants not answering and her parents having a late dinner party. The dinner guests discuss a cholera epidemic that is infesting the region, but Mary's vain shallow mother cares only about attending another party. Only moments later, Colonel Lennox collapses. The following morning, Mary wakes to find her parents dying and all their servants either dead or fled. She is discovered by English officers and is soon sent to live with a friend of the family named Mr. Craven (Derek Jacobi), even though the two of them have never before met.\nMary is sent to Misselthwaite Manor, an isolated home on the moors of Yorkshire. She is shocked and disappointed when the servants do not defer to her as they did in India. While adjusting to life in England, Mary meets the maid Martha (Cassie Stuart) who tells her the story of a secret walled garden that was locked up, with the key thrown away, after the late Mrs. Craven died there. Mary distracts herself from her loneliness and boredom by searching for the door to this garden. Eventually, she finds both door and key, only to learn that the garden has fallen to ruin. With the help of Martha's brother Dickon (Barret Oliver), Mary works to revive the garden.\nMeanwhile, inside Misselthwaite Manor, Mary frequently wakes in the night to the ghostly sounds of sobbing. The servants insist that the sound is the wind, but one night Mary goes exploring and discovers Mr. Craven's bed-bound son Colin (Jadrien Steele), who weeps incessantly because he is convinced he is going to die. Everyone in the house hates him and hopes he will finally die because of his bad temper. The two gradually become friends as Mary tells him about his mother's garden and how she and Dickon have been restoring it. At last Colin is curious enough that he demands to see this garden.\nWith Dickon's help, Mary take Colin in his wheelchair to visit the garden in secret. Soon Colin declares that the garden must be magic, which inspires him to take his first steps unassisted.  The house gardener Ben Weatherstaff (Michael Hordern), who has been spying on the children, witnesses this and is amazed. Ben offers to help revive the garden as well, and Colin tries to learn to stand and walk by himself.\nFar away in London, Mr. Craven receives a letter from Dickon's mother Susan insisting he return to Misselthwaite Manor at once. Mr Craven arrives to discover the secret garden in full bloom, with the children gathered there. Colin rises and walks to his father for the first time, announcing that he is well now and will live forever.\nWhen the adult Mary finishes remembering her childhood, Ben Weatherstaff greets her and gives her the key to the secret garden. They discuss what happened to Dickon, who died in the war, at the Forest of Argonne. Then the adult Colin (Colin Firth) enters the garden, having been wounded and released from the hospital. He says he has asked Mary to marry him before, but she never answered. She says she has been waiting for him to ask her in their garden. Colin proposes again, and Mary accepts.\nThe film actually caused confusion to some, as at the end of the movie, adult Colin proposes to Mary and the two share a kiss.

They are found by the Dinks, a group of diminutive sparkly brown-clad aliens, and are taken to a cave occupied by the sage Yogurt, who introduces the group and the audience to the film's merchandising campaign. Yogurt later teaches Lone Starr about the metaphysical power known as \"the Schwartz\", and gives him a ring which can be used to control the \"Upside\" of the Schwartz. During this time, Lone Starr and Vespa develop romantic feelings for each other, but Vespa insists she can only marry a prince.\nHelmet and Sandurz break the fourth wall by using a VHS copy of Spaceballs to discover Vespa's location, and Helmet orders Spaceball One to go to the moon of Vega. When Helmet discovers Yogurt's lair, he lures Vespa out by pretending to be Roland and captures both her and Dot, taking them back to planet Spaceball. He then threatens to reverse Vespa's nose job, forcing Roland to reveal the code to Druidia's shield.

When the vacuum bag is almost full, Lone Starr uses the Schwartz to reverse the vacuum, blowing the air back onto the planet.\nThe group then enters Mega Maid and attempts to destroy it. Lone Starr and Helmet fight using lightsaber-like weapons created by their Schwartz-rings, until the former loses his ring. Yogurt speaks to Lone Starr, telling him that the ring was a Cracker Jack box prize and that the real Schwartz is inside him. Lone Starr defeats Helmet, causing him to inadvertently strike the self-destruct button. Lone Starr and his friends escape the ship, while Skroob, Helmet, and Sandurz fail to reach any escape pods in time, trapping them in the robot's head as the ship explodes. They subsequently crash-land on a nearby planet, much to the chagrin of its Planet of the Apes-like population.\nWith Lone Starr's debt to Pizza nullified by the gangster's untimely death, he returns Vespa to Roland and leaves, taking only enough money to cover his expenses. After a lunch break at a diner and a strange incident involving an alien and an astronaut similar to the events in Alien, Lone Starr finds a final message from Yogurt, informing him that the medallion necklace Lone Starr has been wearing reveals that he is a prince, and thus eligible to marry Vespa.

Frustrated and worried about his career prospects, he finally pitches a profile on a real-life street pimp, which Ted finds intriguing but gives him a very narrow deadline to meet. Jonathan pays a prostitute for her time, an upbeat former beautician nicknamed Punchy, but finds himself stonewalled by her fear-based loyalty to her pimp, Leo \"Fast Black\" Smalls, Jr. Across town, Smalls beats up a patron assaulting one of his girls; the patron has a fatal heart attack and Smalls is indicted for second-degree murder.\nAfter an attempt by his girlfriend, Alison, to help approach the nightlife goes disastrously wrong, Jonathan invents the story of a pimp named Tyrone. The story is exceptionally well-received by Ted and the magazine's readership; Jonathan is lured into TV stardom as a result, hosting a news segment called \"Street Smart,\" about people using their \"street smarts\" on the streets of New York City. However, Jonathan soon comes under pressure from Ted, who is eager to meet \"Tyrone\" and publish more stories about him, and from an Assistant District Attorney named Leonard Pike, who visits Jonathan at home, angry that his story is granting Smalls' celebrity just when he is going before the court. Jon denies that Tyrone and Smalls are the same person, but Pike does not believe him, and even Smalls' own legal team believes that Smalls is the subject, so strong are the parallels. Smalls' lawyer subpoenas the notes of Jonathan's article, knowing that Ted, Jonathan and the magazine will refuse, and that their refusal to cooperate will imply to a jury that Smalls should be exonerated of the murder. Meanwhile, Smalls, Punchy, and Smalls' lieutenant, Reggie, start hanging around with Jonathan, even attending a magazine fundraiser in Ted's home as the guests of honour. Jonathan and Punchy have in the meantime become romantically involved, causing Alison to break up with Jonathan.\nDespite his often charming exterior, Smalls is a violent and unpredictable man; he nearly cuts up the face of his favorite prostitute, Darlene, when he believes she is skimming from her earnings. Smalls, who knows that the magazine article isn't about him, asks Jonathan to create notes that show that their interview coincided with the time of the murder, therefore giving him an alibi. Jonathan is subpoenaed to appear at Smalls' trial and ordered to hand over said notes (which only Jonathan and Alison know for certain do not exist). Jonathan declines to comply, is found in contempt of court and summarily held in custody. Jonathan makes bail, and then admits to the magazine's lawyer representing him that he made up the entire story, that the similarities between the Tyrone character of the story and the circumstances of Smalls' life are purely coincidental and tries to back out, but the judge on the case shows him photos Pike had taken of Smalls and Jonathan eating together during their first public meeting, and is held in contempt and remanded into custody once again. Pike then approaches Punchy, who initially refuses to answer his questions and unsuccessfully tries to seduce him, but when she later tries to tell Smalls she wants to stop turning tricks for him, Smalls threatens to cut out her eye and he makes Punchy choose which eye he will take. After she tearfully chooses her left eye, Smalls relents and lets her go. Punchy runs straight back to Pike and tells him Smalls wants Jonathan to fabricate the aforementioned notes, but Smalls kills her shortly after she leaves Pike's apartment. Pike, having identified Punchy's body at the morgue, visits Jonathan in jail to inform him of her murder, and also tells him that he knows about what Smalls wants Jonathan to do, angrily advising him not to do it. Meanwhile, on Smalls' orders, Reggie stabs Alison as she goes shopping and puts her in the hospital.\nTrapped and with nothing left to do, Jonathan changes his story again and declares that he will produce the notes and is released. He meets Smalls and agrees to give him the alibi he needs. Smalls is found not guilty, and a furious Pike tells Jonathan that he'll be pursuing him for fabricating evidence. When Jonathan asks what he would get out of that, Pike replies \"satisfaction\". Despite the criminal charges hanging over his head, Jonathan's journalistic reputation remains intact and he and Alison get back together. In revenge for Alison's stabbing, Jonathan entraps Reggie by videotaping him accepting $200 from Darlene (which was given to her by Jonathan who asked her to tell Reggie it came from Smalls), which makes it look as if Reggie is the one skimming from Smalls. Jonathan then warns a terrified Reggie that he should skip town before Jonathan shows the videotape to Smalls.\nSmalls, unaware of the videotape, has been looking for the recently absent Reggie. He finally locates him, but Reggie, convinced that Smalls is coming to kill him, takes off running. As Smalls gives chase, Reggie trips and falls.

Mr. Warren is a middle-aged man with a generally pleasant demeanor, but he is overbearing when it comes to authority, striving to keep things \"appropriate\" for everyone.

Franklin leads the group in a discussion about how Mr. Warren is ruining their summer, and he proposes staging a coup and shutting away the authority to take control of the camp themselves. When some of the boys appear apprehensive, Franklin assures them it will be like a game, not serious, and Donald helps by relating the \"game\" to capture the flag. Franklin, impressed with Donald, appoints him to the position of captain in the upcoming revolution. Stunned, but easily won over, Donald accepts. Afterwards, the other boys are more easily sold.\nThe next morning, Franklin gets up early and steals a gun the counselors keep locked away for protection. The day begins as an event called Camper-Counselor Turnabout, where the campers and counselors trade places. Everyone is having fun that morning, even counselor Jack, who usually finds it difficult to get along with some of the younger group due to his heavy-duty fitness regimens. At breakfast, camper Shawn poses as Mr. Warren and with his fake authority, he lists several joking changes to the rules that everyone agrees with enthusiastically. However, he is interrupted by a suggestion from Franklin to free Chris from the meditation center, and the suggestion becomes a demanding chant from more than half of the mess hall, startling the counselors.\nFranklin and his group quickly run out the back door, pursued by the counselors, who chase them to the meditation center. Though Mr. Warren appears to have the upper hand initially, when he tries to lock Franklin in the building, Franklin takes control by revealing the gun he stole. The other boys help him get the counselors into the meditation center, changing its name to the \"pen,\u201d and they pull a bewildered Chris out. Chris tries to convince Franklin not to go any farther, but Franklin replies that he has simply made a citizen's arrest. He further states that the \"game\" will only last for twenty-four hours. Paul and Runk stay behind to board up the pen while the other boys run off to begin the revolution. While Franklin and Runk visit the girls' camp to capture the female counselors and take over there as well, the rest of the group take over the main office and disable the phone lines. Donald helps Franklin wire the office's intercom into South Pines, and Franklin announces to the girls what has happened.\nAll the boys and girls gather in front of the rec hall of North Pines, and Franklin explains to everyone that it is time for the campers to have a say in how the camp is run. He appoints some of the boys and girls to ranks and positions, giving them control over certain aspects of the new combined camp. He leads everyone in an oath to the revolution, where the campers all swear not to betray the leaders.\nThat night, a party breaks out in the rec hall, including even the little kids, some of which drink the spiked punch. Chris and his new girlfriend Heather become shocked at how out of control things are, and they carry off the younger kids and put them to bed. Things get worse when John and Runk drag Mr. Warren out of the pen and into the party to see how he will react to it. Everyone laughs to see him with his mouth taped and his hands tied behind his back. He becomes uncomfortable when one of the drunk girls begins dancing sexily in front of him, but Chris runs back in and stops them. He takes the tape off Mr. Warren and tries to free him, but the other boys take charge again and Franklin pulls Chris outside to have a talk.\nRunk leads Mr. Warren back toward the pen, but Mr. Warren starts to struggle. He shows surprising physical strength, twisting away from Runk multiple times and bashing him furiously even with his hands tied. Runk pulls out a knife and threatens Mr. Warren, but Mr. Warren charges Runk and runs right into the knife. Runk becomes shocked as Mr. Warren falls dead to the ground. He runs back over to the main office where Franklin is sitting, and blubbering, he tells Franklin what happened. Franklin almost loses control at the news, but then he pulls himself together and orders Runk to take Mr. Warren out to the caves far behind the camp and leave him in there. He warns Runk to keep the incident a secret and do exactly as he says from now on.\nThe next morning, Franklin announces to the camp that the revolution will continue, and he emphasizes that campers who show courage and dedication to the revolution will be named officers. He also promotes Donald to Minister of Propaganda and appoints him to the Supreme Revolutionary Committee. He goes on to name Chris Wade and Heather Long as traitors, and orders everyone to shun them. He warns that anyone seen associating with them will also be named traitors. When Chris and Heather venture out into the main camp that morning, they are stunned to see everyone running away from them. When Donald nervously refuses interaction with them, Chris realizes the situation is worse than he thought, and he and Heather run off. A girl named Laurie then asks Donald out to the rescheduled dance that will be held that night, and he accepts, but tells her he does not know how to dance. She offers to teach him, and they happily feed the camp animals together.\nThat night before the dance, some of the campers start a bonfire with Mr. Warren's wooden butterfly collection post outside the rec hall. People laugh at it on their way in. Laurie stands with some of her friends, telling them enthusiastically about Donald, and the girls gush when he arrives to dance with her. John leaves the dance with Debbie to go on a walk with her, but he becomes grabby and she tries to leave him. He angrily pushes her to the ground and sexually assaults her, drawing the attention of Donald and Laurie, who are also out walking, and they run to help. They report John to Franklin, and Franklin holds a meeting the next morning with the members of the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, John's friends, and Debbie's. Donald and Laurie attend as well to support her. Treating the matter like a judge in a court case, Franklin demands John tell him the truth, and John claims Debbie went along with the whole thing and is just a dirty little tease. Franklin asks Debbie what she thinks John's punishment should be, and she claims she wants him dead. The meeting erupts into a confused discussion, but Franklin controls everyone and says he will consider this while John sits out in the pen.\nLater, Franklin decides to force John to traverse the rope bridge in a \"trial by ordeal\" arrangement, mimicking older societies who punished criminals by making them perform dangerous tasks that could kill them. When John successfully loops the whole bridge, the girls become angry at him. They wait for the other guys to leave, and then they carry John off and hang him from a tree.\nDonald finds John's body and becomes very upset, deciding things have gone far enough. He jerry rigs the disabled phone lines into the satellite over the main office, using a stolen receiver as a radio. He tries to call through to someone, but only hears static, and he is captured by Officer Blackridge and locked inside the office. Chris visits him and they talk about how the camp has gone nuts, but Blackridge finds Chris and throws him out. The next morning, the camp becomes shocked to learn that Donald will be forced to loop the bridge as well, and some of them begin to realize how dangerous Franklin is. They begin to rally support amongst themselves as the crowd gathers by the bridge in time for Donald's punishment. At first it looks like he might make it, but then Franklin orders Runk to cut one of the ropes on the bridge. The campers realize Franklin wants Donald dead, and they all snap and turn against the Supreme Revolutionary Committee, fighting them off to save Donald.\nThe police arrive suddenly, breaking up the fight, revealing they received Donald's broadcast the previous night. They take Donald's tape recorded diary for evidence, and Donald and Chris are dismissed as unwilling participants. Franklin and Runk are taken into custody by the police. Heather and Laurie wait together by the bus for home, and are both relieved to see Chris and Donald arrive. They all board together, and the bus roars off, leaving the camp deserted.", "tmdb_plot": "At Camp North Pines for Boys, the campers, led by the charismatic Franklin Reilly, stage a revolt against the strict owner, Mr. Warren, and lock him and the rest of the counselors up and take over the camp for themselves.

He finally corners Shoop, blackmailing him into taking the job or lose tenure.\nOn his first day, Shoop meets Robin Bishop (Kirstie Alley), who is teaching American History next door.

When Kwok tries to arrest Ting, Peggy takes the metal pole and hits Kwok's back and she and Ting leave.\nAt the police station, Commander Chan demotes Kwok after knowing about his close relationship with Ting and after reading Shek's report stating he saw Kwok letting Ting go. After leaving his office, Shek comes by and humiliates Kwok, who proceeds to fight with him before being stopped by his colleagues.

Yeung then expresses he does not want Ting to leave and tells him to take care. Ting then tells Peggy his plan to go Brazil and cannot take her with him since he is a wanted criminal and does not know what will happen. Peggy then convinces Ting to take her with him by stating she wants to start a new life with him and if he lives, he would have no friends, and Shek would kill her if he tries to find him. Ting finally agrees to take her with him and tells her he will go pick her up at 3 AM after visiting Uncle Pau.\nAt Pau's house, while he was fixing something, Ting knocks but ignores him to which then Ting climbs in. Ting then apologizes to Pau and gives him a sum of money which Pau refuses and states that Ting needs it more than himself. At first, Pau refuses to let Ting in the house and close the window shades but he was actually trying to hide Ting and lets him in and tells him to leave through the back door as there are people spying on him outside. He tells him to not trust anyone and depend on himself. Before leaving, Ting puts the money on top of a shelf. Then, Shek comes by and attempts to search the house without a warrant.

When the police recognizes him, he runs. Then, Kwok comes into the hospital and was informed by his colleague that Ting brought Pau to the hospital and is running now. Kwok then receives a message from Ting and he calls him back which Ting tells him he needs to take good care of Pau and he has left money at his house while also stating they might not see each other again. In the hospital, Pau asks Kwok to help Ting leave Hong Kong safely.\nTing goes to pick Peggy up but was confronted by Kwok in the parking lot where Kwok questions him how many has he killed. Kwok is determined to arrest Ting for killing people. Peggy then tells Kwok that Ting saved his father's life and risked himself as a wanted criminal to take his father to the hospital. Ting then tells Peggy to shut up stating that it is between him and his brother and is none of her business. Peggy states Kwok is not worthy enough to be Ting's brother since she understand him better than a brother of over 20 years. Ting holds his hands up and Kwok proceeds to cuff him but Peggy takes Kwok's gun and points at him saying this is Ting's last chance and asks him whether he really wants to arrest Ting and have him imprisoned for life. She also states their future is depending on him and begs him to let them go. Ting then takes the gun and tells Kwok that they were childhood friends who both dreamed of being cops. They both joined the police academy together but Ting was unsuccessful. He also tells him he does not want to be a wanted criminal and have no choice but to leave. Ting gives Kwok back his gun and finally agrees to let them go while also offering his motorbike to them since Ting's car is being tracked by the police.\nOn the ship leaving Hong Kong, Ting and Peggy happily talk about their life in the future stating that there will be hardship, but they can start a new life. Peggy then jokingly warns Ting not try to court girls in Brazil since she heard that they are very nice. Ting says Brazilian girls are dark skinned and have body odor and would only love Peggy. Peggy then says she wishes their children in the future to join the Brazilian soccer team and play at the World Cup. Ting then asks Peggy how long have they known and Peggy clearly remembers it has been a month and six days. Ting also asks whether she will worry that he might leave her to which she replies she is the only girl in Brazil without body odor. As they are kissing, Fat Ko comes up and shoots Ting in the back and he falls into the water and the ship explodes which kills Peggy and several of Yeung's henchmen. Yeung watches this on the shore with his lawyer.\nAt Yeung's estate, his lawyer tells him Ting will find out that Yeung was the mastermind behind this and he would testify against him. Yeung then decides to kill him but his lawyer tell him that it is impossible to do so since he is a wanted criminal and he is locked up tightly.\nKwok visits Ting at the hospital and brings him a jar of soup. There, Ting asks Kwok about Uncle Pau's condition and tells him not to tell Pau that he is in prison since it would greatly upset him. Ting then gets angry and upset and Kwok tells him not to be upset and saying he would serve a lighter term if he cooperates with the police. However, Ting states that even so, he would still have to serve 30 to 50 years in prison and would be old when he comes out and would be useless. He is only in his twenties and he is afraid. Kwok then tells him that being in jail does not mean there is no more hope. Ting then says over the past ten years he has not done anything right and is a failure and says he will do something right this time by testifying against Yeung and helping Kwok recover his position. He tells Kwok that he will think it over in prison and is determined to become a good person again. Kwok leaves and steps in to his car but upon seeing Ting's watch, he comes back and gives it to the officers to safely store it for him.\nWhile showering, a prisoner tries to stab Ting but misses and stabs someone else. Another prisoner strangles Ting with a towel and Ting was stabbed. The injured prisoner crawls out calling for help and Kwok sees this and goes in the shower room with the other officers. Kwok sees Ting being tortured by two prisoners and hits one of them to the wall while other smashes his head with a piece of glass which knocks him unconscious.\nAt the hospital, the doctor tells Pau that Kwok's left brain was devastated and dry blood are on his brain stem which causes his brain to be heavily injured. The doctors states that if he does not do surgery immediately, he would become aphasia, if worse, may become hemiplegic. Pau then asks the doctor the probability that the operation would be successful to which the doctor replies fifty percent.\nAfterwards, Pau visits Ting and seeing him all injured, he is sorry to his father. He tells Ting that since he was a child, he treated him very well as his own son and would only beat Kwok for misbehaving and when he wants to beat him, he would think of his father and give him a lot of freedom. Pau now realizes that this is a mistake and saying that he does have much time left but hopes to see the two brothers have a successful career and family. Seeing Kwok being heavily injured in the brain and Ting being beaten badly and in prison, Pau is greatly saddened and has a heart attack and is taken away by the nurse.\nLater, when Ting sees Yeung on the newspaper, he becomes furious and decides to escape from prison by holding a nurse hostage. After he successfully escapes, he goes to an opening ceremony of a Buddhist temple where Yeung funded to build. There, Ting takes out his gun and attempts to shoot Yeung but her daughter Lai-chu blocks him. However, Yeung pushes his daughter away and runs towards Ting was being tackled and cuffed by the police. At that time, Yeung was also informed that her daughter has a miscarriage which makes her greatly mad at her father.\nTing and Yeung were brought to court and were charged for 28 cases of smuggling and 15 cases of instructing murder during 1974 to 1986. Since their crimes were major, they are not allowed for bail. However, Yeung's lawyer tell the judge that his client is a public figure in Hong Kong who must attend public meetings during the week and may not be locked up. The judge then allowed Yeung to be bailed on HK$3 million cash and must give out his travel passports. During the second court trial, Ting's lawyer convinced the judge that Ting lost his parents during childhood and never had a proper education while also being stressed by Yeung while Yeung's lawyer stated that his client is a rich tycoon with a net worth of HK$500 million and would not smuggle for only $3\u20134 million and the lack of evidence against him. In the end, the jury decided Ting to be guilty and Yeung not guilty. Ting was pleaded guilty by the judge and is sentenced to capital punishment since murder is a cruel crime and selling drugs does great harm to the community while Yeung is pleaded not guilty is released immediately. After the trial, Kwok, who is wearing a neck brace comes and gives a hug to Ting while he is actually giving Ting a chance to pull out his gun and shoot Yeung multiple times to death and the bailiffs were trying to stop him.

Owen fantasizes about killing his mother but can't summon the courage to bring his desires to fruition. \nAs a student in Larry's class, Owen is given advice by Larry to view an Alfred Hitchcock film to gain some insight into plot development for his murder stories. He sees Strangers on a Train, in which two strangers conspire to commit a murder for each other, figuring their lack of connection to the victim will, in theory, establish a perfect alibi. Having overheard Larry's public rant that he wished his ex-wife dead, Owen forms a plan to kill Margaret, believing that Larry will, in return, kill his mother.\nOwen tracks Margaret down to Hawaii and eventually follows her onto a cruise ship she is taking to her book signing, where he plans to push her overboard.

With his friend, General Joe Brodsky (John Ratzenberger), McKenzie attends an auction of Wild West memorabilia, where they agree to bid on a pair of steamer trunks and split the contents between them.  As the auction is conducted, flashbacks show the items' histories in the 19th century. At the time a man, Joseph Cole (Klaus Kinski), is looking for a gunslinger who has a pair of distinctive ebony-handled pistols marked with stars. Some cowboys he encounters on the road point him towards the town of Crossfire, California. At the town saloon, he inquires about the man, but is harassed by a trio of local thugs, one of whom shoots at him, hitting instead one of the trunks which Dr. McKenzie is bidding on in the present. Cole quickly shoots all three men dead, an event memorialized by a local photographer. In the present, McKenzie and Brodsky win the trunks at auction and McKenzie begins sorting through the contents, noticing the picture of the men who Cole killed.Under photo enhancement, McKenzie notices Cole in the background of the picture and identifies the gun Cole is carrying as a .357 Magnum from the 1980s.  Despite this, chemical and spectroscopic testing indicates that the photograph is at least 100 years old. McKenzie becomes convinced that Cole is a time traveler. After writing up his findings, he is approached by a woman, Georgia Crawford (Lauren Hutton), who claims to be working on similar ideas. Together they locate Crossfire in the present. When they split up to search the town, Georgia ducks into an old barn and removes a crystalline device which she uses to travel back to the 1880s.

Hurrying back to town, she is followed by Cole, who had observed her from afar.

In the present, McKenzie hears a noise and arrives at the barn just in time to see Georgia return from the past. When he confronts her, she admits to being one of a number of time travelers from the 26th century. Returning to McKenzie's home she explains that Cole is a renegade scientist from her time who she has been sent back to stop. She believes that Cole, who developed the time travel technology with her father, is intending to change history.

He then encounters veteran Irish-American officer Jimmy Malone, who opposes the rampant corruption and offers to help Ness, suggesting they find a man from the police academy who has not yet come under Capone's influence and still believes in the idealistic aspects of law enforcement. They recruit Italian-American trainee George Stone (birth name Giuseppe Petri) for his superior marksmanship and integrity. Joined by accountant Oscar Wallace, assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C., they successfully raid a Capone liquor warehouse and start gaining positive publicity, with the press dubbing them \"The Untouchables\". Capone later kills the warehouse manager with a  baseball bat to warn his other subordinates.\nDiscovering that Capone has not filed an income tax return for four years, Wallace suggests trying to build a tax evasion case against him (as Capone's network keeps him well-insulated from his other crimes). A crooked alderman offers Ness a bribe to drop his investigation, but Ness refuses. After Capone's enforcer Frank Nitti threatens to kill Ness's wife Catherine and their daughter, Ness immediately moves them to a safe house. In a subsequent raid on the Canadian border, Ness and his team intercept an incoming liquor shipment, killing several gangsters and capturing a Capone bookkeeper named George, whom they eventually persuade to testify against his boss. Back in Chicago, Nitti, dressed as a policeman, murders Wallace and George in a police station and leaves a taunting message for Ness. Ness confronts Capone at the Lexington Hotel after the murders, but Malone intervenes, urging Ness to focus on persuading the district attorney not to dismiss the charges against Capone.\nRealizing that police chief Mike Dorsett sold out Wallace and George, Malone forces Dorsett to reveal where Capone's accountant, Walter Payne, is hiding. That evening, one of Capone's men breaks into Malone's apartment; Malone chases him out with a shotgun, but Nitti ambushes him with a Tommy gun. Shortly afterwards, Ness and Stone arrive to find Malone mortally wounded; before he dies, Malone shows them which train Payne will take out of town. As the duo await Payne's arrival at Union Station, Ness sees a young mother with two suitcases and a child in a carriage laboriously climbing the lobby steps. Ness ultimately decides to assist her, but the gangsters guarding Payne appear as Ness and the woman reach the top of the stairs, and a bloody shootout occurs. Though outnumbered, Ness and Stone manage to capture Payne alive and kill all his escorts, keeping both the mother and child unharmed.\nLater, when Payne testifies at Capone's trial, Ness observes that Capone appears strangely calm, and that Nitti is wearing a gun in the courtroom. The bailiff removes Nitti and searches him, finding a note from Chicago Mayor William Hale Thompson which effectively permits him to carry the weapon. However, noticing Nitti possesses a matchbook with Malone's address written inside, Ness realizes that Nitti killed Malone. Panicked, Nitti shoots the bailiff before fleeing to the courthouse roof, where Ness captures him. After Nitti insults the memory of Malone and gloats that he will escape conviction for the murder, an enraged Ness pushes Nitti off the roof to his death, avenging Wallace and Malone.\nStone gives Ness a list, taken from Nitti's coat, which shows that the jurors in the trial are all on Capone's payroll.

Despite unplugging the television, it reactivates and spawns the film's zombies, (Jack, The Bride, Ironhead, Jimmy D. and Half-Creeper), who attack and kill the writer. The next day, the delivery men arrive to claim the set, realizing it was meant to go to the Institute for Paranormal Research; they find only the body of the writer, bound in his front hallway and dressed in party clothes.\nThree months later, teenagers Zoe and Jeff arrive at the house ahead of their parents, who are moving back to the United States after years abroad. Jeff befriends dog walker April and she accompanies him home, where the dog she is watching escapes into the woods. The dog comes upon the zombies that escaped the television set and have since been living in the woods. The zombies kill the dog, meanwhile Jeff and April are searching for it and later find the remains. The zombies follow the pair back to the neighborhood.\nThat afternoon, a man named Joshua Daniels comes looking for the television set, claiming he bought it at a yard sale and mailed it to the Paranormal Institute after it killed his wife. Jeff turns him away but later that night discovers the television set, which has mysteriously migrated to the attic.  A bizarre woman briefly appears on the set, beckoning to Jeff, before a man appears and kills her, revealing her to be a zombie. The man, who calls himself \"The Garbage Man\", says the only way to prevent more zombies from appearing is to tape a mirror to it.\nThe next day, the zombies break into April's house. Ironhead angrily strangles their maid to death before they go upstairs and kill April's father.  Their next-door neighbors also die at the hands of the zombies. Jeff, Zoe, and April barricade themselves inside of their own home, along with Joshua, who has returned to reclaim the television set. Joshua explains the psychology of the zombies: realizing that they are in a liminal state between life and death, the zombies kill humans out of envy. They are repulsed by mirrors because it reminds them of their own hideousness, and attack when they sense fear.  The zombies can be tricked into believing they are dead by wounding and then dismembering them, but they must be left unburied.  They can also be destroyed by trapping them in an enclosed space, which causes them to enter a psychotic state and cannibalize one another.\nDespite the fortifications, Jimmy D. breaks in and incapacitates April.  Zoe and Jeff lock the zombie out of the house after it leaves with April's body.  The next morning, Joshua and Jeff head into the woods to hunt down the zombies.  Joshua sets traps and takes up a sniper position while using Jeff as bait.  Using a bow and arrows, they shoot and incapacitate all the zombies but The Bride, whom they pursue.  Joshua is killed, and Jeff gets trapped in a shed, where he discovers April's dead body.  The  Bride, having armed herself with a chainsaw, kills Jeff inside the shed (not before she is decapitated by Jeff using a hatchet). The other zombie wake up, shaking off their illusions on death, and make their way back to the neighborhood.\nThey return to the house, where Zoe is alone.  Remembering the zombies only attack when they sense fear, Zoe invites the zombies in, and they become docile.  Zoe discovers a mirror on the basement door, tricks the zombies into entering the basement, and they go berserk.  After they consume each other, their remains are sucked back into the television, and Zombie Blood Nightmare finally ends.\nSometime later, Zoe's parents come to visit her in the hospital, where she is being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder.

However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients.\nAfter making a considerable amount of money from the Bluestar tip, Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects by honest research and advice from respected senior broker Lou Mannheim lose money. Gekko offers Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British investor Sir Lawrence Wildman. They deduce that Wildman is making a bid for Anacott Steel. Gekko buys a large block of shares in Anacott, which Wildman is forced to buy off him at a high price, to complete the takeover.\nBud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's East Side.

Even though Bud is unable to persuade his father to support him and Gekko, he is able to get the unions to push for the deal. Soon afterward, Bud learns that Gekko plans to dissolve the company and sell off Bluestar's assets in order to access cash in the company's pension plan, leaving Carl and the entire Bluestar staff unemployed. Although this would leave Bud a very rich man, he is angered by Gekko's deceit and wracked with guilt of being an accessory to Bluestar's impending destruction, especially after his father suffers a heart attack. Bud resolves to disrupt Gekko's plans, and breaks up with Darien when she refuses to go against Gekko, her former lover.\nBud then devises a plan to leak news of Gekko's takeover to drive the price up. This forces Gekko to buy the stock at a higher price, as he tries to secure a controlling interest. Bud then convinces the unions to pull their support, ending any prospect of Gekko completing the takeover, and causing the price to plummet. This forces Gekko to offload his stock at a considerable loss. Bud and the union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy the stock and a controlling interest in Bluestar, at a significant discount, on the condition that he saves the company. When Gekko learns on the evening news that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud has engineered the entire scheme.

However, he is taunted by Chris and George and learns that Vic is deadly serious about his job. On their first night, Alan carves his initials into a tree. After Vic finds out, he calls the others to vote on his punishment. They take away his knife.\nIn another incident, Vic asks Alan to be his bowman while white water rafting. Alan is unprepared and loses an oar. Later, Vic asks the boys to cross a dangerous rope bridge. Alan crosses it with the others but leaves their tent poles behind. Upon realizing this, Vic sends him back to collect them alone. Despite his best efforts, Alan fails to cross the bridge. Embarrassed, he returns and explains that he could not find them, but Vic catches him in his lie; he watched him the entire way and even retrieved the poles.\nThe tension between Alan and Vic escalates when the group goes fishing on an island. Instead of following Vic's lead and catching them with his bare hands, Alan invents a fish trap. Furious, Vic tosses the fish he caught and forces him to clean the others\u2019 fish. Alan refuses and Vic leaves with the group, stranding him on the island until the fish are cleaned. Alan stays on the island for the night and refuses to complete the task.\nThe next morning, the others retrieve him. When they return, they find that Vic has disappeared.

When they reach a gap, Vic creates a pendulum for the boys to swing across. Alan is last to go but is the only one who does not make the jump. Despite the others\u2019 protests, Vic leaves Alan dangling and instructs him to figure his own way out of it.\nChris challenges Vic's leadership and Vic retaliates by holding him over the edge of a cliff. Left to his own devices, Alan creates enough momentum to swing across. He confronts Vic and a foot chase ensues. Furious, Chris throws rocks at Vic and hits him with an oar, sending him over the edge of a ravine. With Vic having broken his leg in the fall, Alan creates a pulley and the group hoist him out of the ravine.\nAs the group's new leader, Alan instructs the others to follow the river to the ranger station. With Vic stable but losing blood, Alan sits him in a canoe and they raft down a wild river. Alan skillfully navigates the rapids but the canoe capsizes after plunging down a small waterfall.

So disturbed, Moley comes above ground for the first time in his life, and is positively amazed by the surface world.

All too soon, Toad returns and recklessly overturns Ratty's boat, nearly drowning Moley, but Ratty saves him and pushes him along to shore.\nRatty, not taking kindly to interference of nature, resolves to have it out with Toad, and he and Moley paddle down the river together (\"Messing Around in Boats\"). On the way downriver to Toad Hall, they pass Badger (voice of Jos\u00e9 Ferrer), who is tending his land on the riverbank. Despite their friendly greetings, Badger gruffly reminds them that he is not the most social of animals and retreats. At Toad Hall, Ratty and Moley find that Toad (true to his form) has tired of boating and instead developed an appetite for overnight wagoneering.

While touring, they were accidentally locked inside the plane. To make matters worse, the dome where the plane was located closed up for the night. Augie Doggie tripped over and opened a door. The gang came to the cockpit. Yogi accidentally pushed a button which magically activated the plane. Soon the gang exited the dome in the plane. In an attempt to avoid a bridge, Yogi pulls back the wheel, causing the Spruce Goose to lift off. After narrowly avoiding colliding with the Queen Mary Hotel, the Spruce Goose leaves Long Beach to take the gang on a magical flight.\nYogi and his friends listen to the radio about a group of arctic animals down at the South Pole trapped by a snowstorm and unable to reach the open sea. So they fly down there to help. While flying over to the spot where the animals are trapped, they meet Bernice, who had been on the Spruce Goose tour with her mom before getting lost herself. Soon they arrive to save the animals. They did that by having the Spruce Goose plow through the ice like a giant icebreaker and open a channel to the ocean. They succeeded, but their mission wasn't finished yet, as the penguins were attacked by sharks. So they got the plane to act as a bridge to get the penguins safely across the water. Bernice slips off the wings and nearly is eaten by sharks before being rescued by Yogi and Quick Draw McGraw, only for Snagglepuss to start the propellers and knock them off the wing onto an ice floe. Luckily, a whale arrives to scare off the sharks by threatening to eat them due to being the bigger fish.\nNext, Yogi and his friends listen to the radio about a bunch of animals trapped on an ocean liner at the Zelman Sea, long after poachers kidnapped them and left them on the boat to die. At the same time, two aliens, who were scared off from launching their invasion back in Long Beach, attempt to try again with the stranded animals. They transform into \"Earth animals\" in an attempt to mingle among them. The gang arrives to save the animals and scare off the aliens again. They tried to tow the ship by tying the ropes to the ship, but the doors opened up and caused the water to enter the ship. Quick Draw McGraw as El Kabong tried to rescue the animals himself but with little success. Then Bernice found a way to save the animals using the Spruce Goose itself due to having been designed as a cargo plane for use in World War II, but they couldn't find the doors since the nose of the plane was altered after its only flight years ago. The doors were finally located and opened up for the animals to enter the Spruce Goose. They then locate an island where they could drop the animals off safely at, noticing the word \"HELP\" carved in the sand. Afterwards, they realize that the \"HELP\" was from someone stranded on the island in need of rescue.\nThe gang starts a search party, but unbeknownst to them, something is lurking in the bushes listening in on them. The thing in the bushes is revealed to be Mumbly, who has crashed on the island along with the Dread Baron. Mumbly awakens The Dread Baron and attempts to tell him of the plane. The Dread Baron realizes the plane is the Spruce Goose and that with it he can become rich. He notices Yogi and his gang and realizes his plans could be foiled by them. But after seeing Bernice with the gang, he devises a plan to get on the Spruce Goose and try to take it over. After being rescued from quicksand, the Dread Baron pleads his case to Yogi, asking him to be merciful and take him and Mumbly off the island, but the rest of Yogi's gang are against it, so Yogi offers the Dread Baron and Mumbly a test: If they can return a bird's egg to its nest, as it was knocked out of the nest earlier, that will prove to Yogi and his friends that they want to become good, and Yogi will agree to take them back to the United States. Dread Baron and Mumbly succeed in their task, and Yogi agrees to take them aboard, but the Dread Baron and Mumbly have other intentions in mind.\nOn the Spruce Goose, Dread Baron and Mumbly did some cleanup work, so that they won't raise any suspicions when Yogi checked up on them and find that they were doing a great job. Then Dread Baron throws a party for the gang supposedly as a matter of thanks. But the party was a trap as Dread Baron traps them in a cargo hold where the party was held. So now Dread Baron takes over the plane and he and Mumbly flew off to where they were supposed to go a long time ago: The island of Moolah Moolah.\nThey reached Moolah Moolah, which is filled with natives who worship an idol that looks like Dread Baron. They called it \"Malagula.\" Dread Baron, posing as Malagula, parachuted down to the ground and surprised the natives. Malagula wanted gold, so they gave tons to him. Meanwhile, the gang, still locked in the cargo hold, found a way to get out by tricking the native guarding the door. The gang confronted Dread Baron, but he captured them and sent them to a hut to imprison them. Malagula and the natives surrounded the gang after they landed on the ground following escaping the hut and were about to decide what to do with the gang next when the volcano started to erupt. With the natives and Malagula in shock, the gang escaped back to the plane. The volcano caused a fault to crack and destroy the Malagula idol. This caused the natives to believe the volcano was mad at Malagula and stop worshiping him and chased Dread Baron and Mumbly back to the plane.\nAfter that, we get one last look at Merkin and Firkin who flew to Moolah Moolah and again failed to invade Earth. But the plane wasn't out of danger yet; for the weight of all the gold that's in there started to bring it down, stalling the engines. So the gang pushed and shoved the gold out of the plane. Naturally, Dread Baron disapproves, and he and Mumbly jumped out to get it. Dread Baron tried to parachute down, but the parachute was taken by Mumbly. As the Spruce Goose flies off, Mumbly becomes the new leader and Dread Baron is now his servant.\nThe gang flew back to Long Beach, California and the dome home of the Spruce Goose. The next day, the gang went home. Yogi and the gang ran into Bernice and her mother and went to say good-bye to them.

An ongoing economic crisis has led to the recycling of aging 20th-century mechanical and technological equipment. Society has also become averse to intimacy, as well as both increasingly hypersexualized and bureaucratic. Robotic technology has produced Gynoids as substitutes for wives. The declining instances of actual sex among men and women is litigious, with one brothel having lawyers draft up contracts detailing the intended sexual rendezvous.\nBusiness executive Sam Treadwell (David Andrews) owns a Cherry 2000 model as his wife. After she short circuits during sex on a wet kitchen floor, Sam is told by a repairman that she is damaged beyond repair, though her rare and valuable memory disk, which contains her entire personality, can be used in a new body if the same model can be found. A Gynoid dealer tells Sam that the Cherry 2000 model is no longer produced and that the only remaining ones are in a defunct warehouse in \"Zone 7,\" a particularly dangerous, lawless area. With Cherry's memory disk stored in a device that plays back Cherry's voice, Sam hires Edith \"E\" Johnson (Melanie Griffith), a tough tracker, to guide him to the factory. They set off in Edith's heavily modified 1965 Ford Mustang.\nEntering Zone 7, they encounter Lester (Tim Thomerson), a wasteland overlord with deranged subordinates. Edith and Sam take refuge in an underground reservoir occupied by Six-Fingered Jake (Ben Johnson), an elderly tracker who was Edith's mentor. When Lester's men attack, the three attempt to escape, but Sam is knocked unconscious and taken to a 1950s-styled motel/village. Ginger (Cameron Milzer), one of Lester's gang, reveals herself as Sam's ex-girlfriend, previously known as Elaine.  Lester decides to induct Sam into the group, and Sam, believing that Edith and Jake are dead, goes along for a while. When he witnesses the group sadistically murdering a tracker, Sam decides to escape and runs into Edith and Jake, still quite alive. Jake, who had earlier led Sam to believe that the Cherry 2000 memory disk had been lost, still has it and gives it to Edith while he stays behind to draw off Lester's gang.\nSam, a veteran of earlier wars, shows that he is a capable fighter, and Edith begins to have feelings for him. Sam's own growing feelings toward Edith, though, are derailed when he hears Cherry's voice accidentally play on the audio device.  Continuing to work their way to the Gynoid warehouse, they arrive at a brothel/gas station owned by Snappy Tom (Harry Carey, Jr.), a friend of Jake's, where a dilapidated Aeronca Champion light airplane is stored. Edith repairs the plane using parts from the Mustang. Jake catches up with the group and reminisces with Snappy Tom, but Snappy's live-in girlfriend (Jennifer Mayo) betrays their location to Lester over the radio and shoots Jake in the back. Edith and Sam manage to escape in the plane.\nSam is almost ready to abandon the quest, but Edith is determined to complete her job as a tracker so Jake's death will not become meaningless. As they land, Zone 7 is revealed to be actually the abandoned ruins of Las Vegas and the Gynoid \"warehouse\" is actually a casino. Sam finally finds a functional Cherry 2000 model (Pamela Gidley) and activates her with the memory disk; however, being programmed only for home life and sex, the robot is incapable of adapting to the current dangerous situation when Lester and his gang attack.\nIn an extended battle, Sam, Edith, and Cherry climb aboard the airplane, but their combined weight prevents takeoff.  Edith jumps out so that Sam and the robot can escape, but Sam realizes that Cherry cannot provide the human interaction that he and Edith have had and turns the plane around.  Cherry, programmed to fulfill Sam's wishes, offers to bring him a Pepsi, so he sends her away as he and Edith fight off Lester's gang and take off in the plane.

They meet their old friend alien archaeologist Gromozeka, who's just discovered an empty space ship called Black Wanderer all inhabitants of which died. Upon investigation of the Black Wanderer they find video evidence that the Black Wanderer was inhabited by Space Pirates, who attacked entire planets at a time to loot their resources. Since they lacked the manpower to physically take over an entire planet they would instead send ahead a scouting ship which would plant a lilac ball on the planet. Lilac balls were storage units for the virus of hate, which would cause all who were infected to attack each other.\nWhen the Black Wanderer would get near the planet, the lilac ball would disperse the virus, causing the inhabitants of the planet to wipe themselves out, allowing the space pirates to loot the planet unopposed. At some point, a slave that labored in the Black Wanderer sacrificed himself and broke a lilac ball, which caused the space pirates to wipe themselves out.
