He is berated by his mother (\"The good die young, and people like you come back\", she says after hearing about the death of the young friend Hans had taken to the army with him).\nHans works as a fruit peddler, calling out his products and diligently making his rounds through the residential streets. Short and stocky, he is married to the slim and taller Irmgard, who helps him with his work. They have a small daughter, Renate. One day Hans sells fruit to an attractive married woman in an apartment building. She asks him to deliver the pears in person and invites him in, but he refuses, saying \"some other time.\" The woman is the great love of Hans's life since his youth. When the suspicious Irmgard questions why it took so long, he escapes her incessant complaints by abandoning his cart and going into a nearby bar. Soon, the sad ritual of his empty existence emerges: arguing with his wife, drinking excessively, lamenting lost personal and professional opportunities. While in the bar, Hans gets sentimental about his golden days as a policeman. In a flashback, he recalls how one day he brought a prostitute to the police station to take a statement, but she lured him into having oral sex. Caught by his superior, this incident got him fired.\nIrmgard appears at the bar to fetch him, but a drunk Hans says he will come home when he wants to. When his wife does not leave fast enough, he throws a chair at her. Finally Hans comes home intoxicated. Irmgard calls him a pig and he beats her up in front of their little daughter. The next morning, Irmgard has disappeared and Hans is desperate.\nIrmgard, fleeing with Renate, finds support with Hans' family. His contemptuous bourgeois mother has always disdained Hans, as she favors her obedient married daughter Heidi and tolerates her outspoken college student daughter Anna. When Hans once dreamed of being a mechanic, his mother demanded that he keep on studying and forbid him from taking a job that would get his hands dirty. Irmgard complains to her in-laws that Hans attacked her the night before. Heidi and her husband agree with the mother that Hans has always been good for nothing. Anna is the lone relative sympathetic to him, saying his family has always despised him and never gave him a proper chance. When Hans arrives, he tries to reconcile with his wife, but Irmgard retreats to a corner of the living room screaming in terror while the brother-in-law stands in front of her. The two men struggle while Irmgard phones a lawyer, saying she wants a divorce. When she puts down the receiver, Hans begins to sing his favorite tune: \"Buona, buona notte, you can't have everything you want.\" Then he has a heart attack.\nWhile Hans is recuperating in a hospital bed, his wife lets herself be picked up by a man in the street and takes him home to bed. But her little daughter catches them having sex, after which Irmgard sobs incessantly. At the hospital, Hans and his wife reconcile; she promises to stay with him. Once he is back home and as they are about to have sex, Irmgard explains that sometimes she finds him funny because he is much shorter than she is and that she only grew interested in him in the first place because he was so comical.\nAfter his heart attack, Hans can neither work nor drink, so Irmgard takes a larger role in the business. No longer able to push the cart around, Hans hires a hard-working and honest assistant, Anzell. He is the same man with whom, unknown to Hans, Irmgard had the brief affair during his hospitalization. Fearing exposure of her indiscretion, she manipulates Anzell into overpricing the produce and afterwards sharing the extra earnings with her. He agrees, but Irmgard knows he will be found out because her husband spies on Anzell when he goes through the courtyards. It happens as planned and Anzell is fired in disgrace, but Hans knows of Irmgard's infidelity.\nWhile dining with a friend, Hans is reunited with Harry, a close friend from his years in the Foreign Legion who now waits tables, and immediately offers him a job. Soon Hans suggests to his wife that Harry move in with them. She protests, but Hans insists. Harry proves to be an industrious worker who takes the cart through the streets and earns more than Hans did. Irmgard tends a fruit stand while Hans sulks with too much time on his hands. Though Harry's professionalism and dedication bring Hans' business profitability and success, they also render Hans obsolete in his own life, leading him further into isolation and despair.\nIn his depression, Hans revisits the great love of his life. In his youth, he courted her with an armful of red roses, but she turned him down because her parents did not want her to marry a fruit peddler. Though married to someone else, she undresses for casual sex, but he leaves. When Hans visits Anna, his favorite sister, she is busy with her studies and has no time for him.\nThe doctor says large quantities of alcohol would be fatal for Hans because of his bad heart, and in the end, Hans deliberately goes to his regular bar. While drinking, he remembers an incident when he was in the Foreign Legion in Morocco. Captured and tortured by an Arab, he was saved by his comrades at the last minute though he really wanted to die. Like then, Hans no longer wishes to live.

By way of remittance, Lurkalot aids his master by selling love potions and chastity belts as well as some unusual inventions in the local village, as Sir Coward is not a particularly successful noble. Lurkalot is also visited by strange \"voices\" in the middle of the night who speak to him and try to tell him who he really is, but get drowned out by events like lightning.\nAll grown up, Richard is bored of ruling England and decides to go on a crusade. Meanwhile, Sir Braggart de Bombast wants to acquire Sir Coward's lands and daughter for himself and makes him an offer. Sir Coward refuses but invites Sir Braggart and his followers to a banquet so as not to offend them, but refuses to toast Prince John.

Once in the Holy Land, he discovers that the \"crusades\" are actually a Bacchanalian orgy, an excuse to leave the wives and families for a few years. Saladin is actually a friend of a crusader and started everything. Richard will not leave the Holy Land, as he is with Scheherazade and insists on trying every position in the Kama Sutra.

Shiva gave the responsibility of balancing the earth to Agathiyar by going to the southern side. Agathiyar is also given the additional responsibility of spreading goodness and equality. He has the additional task of spreading the Tamil language. Many small stories between heaven and earth are interwoven in the movie. The stories teach one to lead a simple existence without ego.

Mount Vindhyan was truly benevolent and promised to not grow until the sage returns from the south. However, after passing through the mount, the sage will not require again to cross over to the northern side of Mount Vindhyan.\nNarathar was speaking proudly to others. He is most reverent to Vishnu (Lord Narayana) because he always thinks and chants about only Vishnu. Agathiyar tells Narathar to watch one day for a potter. Narathar also does that and tells Agathiyar that the potter man chants about \"Narayana\" twice daily. Then, Agathiyar kept Narathar a small bowl full of oil in Narathar's hands. Agathiyar gives a rule asking Narathar to not spill one drop of oil while going around the world, and Narada does the job perfectly. Agathiyar then questions Narathar, \"how many times did you chant \"Narayana\"'s name today?\" for which Narathar answered saying \"how can I even think of revering my name, when I have a burden kept in my hands?\". Agathiyar explains to Narathar, that he has one smallest burden, but even while doing that you forgot to chant your name. But that man has much troubles in his family and many burdens. But he still remembered and chanted Vishnu's name, which makes him the best devotee of Vishnu.\nRavana was in a Yazh competition with Agathiyar Muni, because of taunting comments by the Narathar Muni.

After they eat the mango, Ilavala would call his brother out: \"Vathapi\" , his brother would respond from the belly of the visitor and come out alive in one piece. In the process the guest would be killed. The two demons later would enjoy a curry made of human flesh. One day, Agathiyar happened to pass by, the plan as usual, Vatapi changed into a ripe mango and the other disguised himself as brahmachari (Sage of Bachelor) who invited Agathiyar to eat at the home. Agathiyar knew about the plan due to his immense Vedic Power, he resolves to teach both a lesson. After the meal, Agathiyar simply rubbed his stomach saying \"Vathapi Jeerano bhave\" may Vathapi be digested, while other demon tries to bring his brother life, but in vain.

On learning this, Raghu tutors her and brings her talents to the fore. He also helps in clearing up the misunderstandings and calling truces between the family members. Daduji cannot help but think that Raghu is actually a saviour sent by god. Meanwhile, nobody notices that Raghu is suspiciously eyeing the jewel box the whole time.\nMeanwhile, Raghu learns that Krishna loves a boy named Arun, but the Sharmas are strictly against the union of Krishna with him. The boy also loves Krishna, but is helpless before Krishna's relatives as well. Amongst all the tangle, Raghu suddenly disappears. The Sharmas are also aghast to know that the box is missing as well.\nIt does not take the Sharmas long to put two and two together. At the same time, Arun shows up. The people are already angered at the turn of events and the boy's arrival, but they receive a shock when he shows them the jewelry box. He explains that he saw Raghu in a suspicious condition with the box. When he asked Raghu about the box, Raghu tried to run away. He tried to stop Raghu, even beat him up (the boy is a wrestler), but Raghu somehow managed to escape.\nStunned by this unexpected turn of events, the attitude of Sharmas towards Arun changes and they agree to get him married with Krishna out of gratitude. Krishna, however, refuses to buy the story. When the Sharmas start abusing Raghu, Arun wasn't able to take it anymore and tells them what really happened.\nHe tells them that he met Raghu at his own wrestling ground. He had a little friendly match with Raghu, where he suffered minor injuries from Raghu. He saw the box and asked Raghu about it. Raghu said that the box was the real reason he came there. Raghu had asked him to take the box to the Sharmas and tell them that Raghu had stolen it so that Krishna's lover can get back his place in the house.\nMeanwhile, Krishna sees Raghu outside the house and asks him why did he do all this. Raghu told her that his real name was professor Prabhakar, but he took the fake name of Raghu. He had seen many families like the Sharmas which were on the brink of breaking up and hence decided to use his knowledge to stop this.\nRaghu explained to him that if he lies about the box and what happened between him and Raghu, the boy will be able to marry Krishna. Raghu had promised the boy to secrecy, but the latter couldn't stand up the abuse to Raghu. A stunned Sharma family has to accept that Raghu went out of his way to save several homes like Shanti Niwas. Krishna manages to stop Raghu in time from going somewhere else.\nRaghu tells her that this is his life's mission and now he has to go. The film ends with a scene of him traveling to a new destination and narration from Amitabh Bachchan that \"Raghu is going to a new home. Let's hope it is not yours.\"\nThe movie was a hit.

During a long recovery process, he slowly finds God in poverty, chastity and obedience, experiencing a physical and spiritual renewal.\nHealthy again, Francesco returns to his normal life as a rich young man. However, to the consternation of his parents, he begins to spend most of his time surrounded by nature, flowers, trees, animals and poetry as he becomes more and more reluctant to resume his prior lifestyle. Pietro's obsession with gold now fills Francesco with revulsion, creating an open confrontation between Francesco and Pietro.\nFrancesco wanders into the basement where the family business is located. He feels the heat and humidity of the dye vats, passing through colorful lots of drying cloth, to see the workers with their families laboring in the heat without much rest. Rejecting his father's offer to take over the family business, he instead pulls the laborers out of the building to enjoy the daylight.

Much to the dismay of his family, some of Francesco's friends join him. He gradually gains a following from the sons of the wealthy, who begin to minister among the poor and the suffering.\nThe bishop supports Francesco, since he is rebuilding a church without pay and performing the works of mercy Christ demands of His followers.

(This scene, introduced for dramatic effect, is unhistorical.) That people can hate so much causes Francesco much sorrow. He blames himself but cannot understand what he has done wrong. He then decides to walk to Rome and to seek out the answers from Pope Innocent III.\nIn Rome, Francesco is stunned by the enormous wealth and power shown in the clothing of the papal court surrounding the throne of St. Peter. When granted an audience with the Pope, Francesco breaks from reciting Paolo's carefully prepared script and calmly protests against pomp and worldliness, reciting some of Jesus' words from the Sermon on the Mount praising humility to protest that Christ's teachings are totally opposite to Rome's obsession with wealth. The cardinals, bishops and abbots of the papal court are insulted at having the words of Jesus thrown in their faces. Francesco and his friends are expelled. Finally accepting his admiration toward Francesco, Paolo decides to join them. Francesco tries to protect Paolo, saying that he is not one of them, but his friend insists on joining the friars, convincing Francesco of the sincerity of his conversion, and they are put out with the others.\nOn his throne Pope Innocent, seemingly waking from a dream, orders Francesco and his friends to be brought back. The Pope addresses Francesco: \"In our obsession with original sin we have forgotten original innocence.\" In language from one of the Psalms, Innocent prays that Francesco's order \"flourish like the palm.\"\nThen to everyone's astonishment, Pope Innocent kneels, kisses Francesco's feet and blesses him and his companions, wishing for them a long worldwide society of men and women willing to serve God in humility.

Jill does not realize that Don is blind until she sees him dropping his cigarette ash on the table. Jill has never met a blind man before, so she asks all sorts of questions about how Don manages everyday chores.\nJill tells Don that her favorite quote is: \"I only ask to be free. The butterflies are free. Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies.\" (From Dickens' Bleak House.) She takes him to Asparagus, a bohemian clothing store, on Union Street, where owner Roy helps them pick out some free-spirited fashion. Back home, Don makes up a song and starts to sing \"Butterflies Are Free\" on his guitar. They discover they can unlock the door separating their two apartments.\nSurprising Don with a visit, Mrs. Baker sees that Don has attached himself to Jill. She also encounters them in the apartment partially undressed. She fears that Jill will break Don's heart. She takes Jill out for a lunch at Perry's, on Union Street, and tries to talk her out of Don's life. Jill has strong feelings for Don and tells Mrs. Baker that if there is someone who should get out of Don's life, it is she.\nFollowing Mrs. Baker's input, Jill later breaks a dinner date at Don's apartment, showing up much later with Ralph, the director of the play she has auditioned for. Jill hesitantly announces that she is moving in with Ralph, trying too hard to convince Don, and herself, that it is a great idea.\nWhen Jill goes to pack her things, a heartbroken Don asks his mother if he can move back home. She talks him out of it, pointing out that her Little Donny Dark books had been her way of helping young Don face his fears, and she (sadly) must do the same now. They finally make peace over their new roles in life. Jill and Don fight over her moving out, and Don tells her she is the one who is disabled. She leaves but returns to Don, and the two reconcile.", "tmdb_plot": "Striving to be independent, the blind but determined Don Baker moves away from his overprotective mother.

A reserved academic and writer, Brian must give English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate. Sally tries to seduce Brian, but he tells her that on three previous occasions he has tried to have sexual relationships with women, all of which failed. They become friends, and Brian witnesses Sally's bohemian life in the last days of the Weimar Republic. When Brian consoles Sally after her father cancels his meeting with her, they become lovers, concluding that his previous failures with women were because they were \"the wrong three girls\".\nMaximilian von Heune, a rich, married playboy and baron, befriends Sally and takes her and Brian to his country estate where they are both spoiled and courted. After a somewhat enigmatic experience with Brian, Max drops his pursuit of the pair in haste. During an argument, Sally tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, and Brian reveals that he has as well. Brian and Sally later reconcile, and Sally reveals that Max left them 300 marks and mockingly compares the sum with what a professional prostitute earns.\nSally learns that she is pregnant but is unsure of the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. At first, they celebrate their resolution to start this new life together, but after a picnic between Sally and Brian, in which Brian acts distant and uninterested, Sally becomes disheartened by the vision of herself as a bored faculty wife washing dirty diapers. Ultimately, she has an abortion, without informing Brian in advance. When he confronts her, she shares her fears, and the two reach an understanding. Brian departs for England, and Sally continues her life in Berlin, embedding herself in the Kit Kat Klub.\nA subplot concerns Fritz Wendel, a German Jew passing as a Protestant, who is in love with Natalia Landauer, a wealthy German Jewish heiress who holds him in contempt and suspects his motives. Through Brian, Sally advises him to be more aggressive, which eventually enables Fritz to win her love. However, to gain her parents' consent for their marriage, Fritz must reveal his background, which he does and the two are married by a rabbi.\nThe rise of fascism is an ever-present undercurrent throughout the film. Their progress can be tracked through the characters' changing actions and attitudes. While in the beginning of the film, a Nazi is expelled from the Kit Kat Klub, the final shot of the film shows the cabaret's audience is dominated by uniformed Nazis. The rise of the Nazis is also demonstrated in a rural beer garden scene. A blonde boy sings to an audience of all ages (\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me\") about the beauties of nature and youth. It is revealed that the boy is wearing a Hitler Youth uniform. The ballad transforms into a militant Nazi anthem, and one by one nearly all the adults and young people watching rise and join in the singing. \"Do you still think you can control them?\" Brian asks Max.

In order to deceive the carpenter, Nicholas pretends to be in a holy trance. When the carpenter enters the room to see what is wrong, Nicholas convinces him that a massive flood is about to occur, and claims that he, the carpenter, and Allison should all three wait in buckets tied to the ceiling rafters to escape drowning. The carpenter does as he says and they hide in the buckets. While the carpenter waits in his bucket, he drifts off to sleep. Nicholas and Alison come out of their buckets and sneak away to have sex. Meanwhile, Absolon returns but Alison scolds him and tells him that she does not love him. He accepts but asks only for a kiss. Allison answers him by inviting him to climb up to her window and then when he puckers his lips, she sticks her buttocks out the window and farts in his face (a departure from the original, in which it is Nicholas, not Alison, who farts in his face). Absolon is offended and runs to a blacksmith's shop where he borrows a hot poker, and then returns to the carpenter's house and asks for another kiss. On this occasion, Nicholas goes to the window instead of Alison, and has his buttocks scalded. Nicholas then cries out for water, leading the carpenter to awaken and believe that the flood has arrived. The carpenter then cuts the rope holding his bucket in the air, and violently falls to the ground.\nFifth Tale (The Wife of Bath's Prologue):\nIn Bath, a middle-aged woman's fourth husband falls ill during sex and dies soon after.

She tells him that he must marry her because she had a prophetic dream that he was trying to kill her and that she was covered in blood. Blood means gold.

They bring a sack of grain to a mill to be milled into flour. Simkin the Miller tricks the youths by freeing their horse and switching their flour for bran while they chase after it. When they return with the horse, it is late in the evening, and the students ask to stay the night. The Miller agrees to let them stay, and the two share a pallet bed next to one shared by the Miller and his wife. During the night, Alan seduces Molly, the Miller's daughter, being careful not to wake the Miller. John is angered by this as he is left alone and feels foolish. The Miller's wife, meanwhile, gets up to urinate, and stumbles over the crib at the foot of her and the Miller's pallet. John gets an idea and before she returns, he moves the crib to the foot of his own pallet, tricking the miller's wife into sleeping with him instead of the Miller. Alan finishes having sex with Molly, and she confesses that she and father have stolen his flour. Alan then gets into bed with the Miller and tells him about his exploits with Molly, thinking that the Miller is his companion. The Miller then attacks the scholar, causing his wife and John to come to the scholar's defense in the dark room and knock him out. The scholars then ride away with their flour as Molly forlornly says farewell.\nSeventh Tale (The Pardoner's Tale):\nChaucer sits down to write another story. He has a very focused look on his face.\nIn Flanders, four young men spend their time carousing in a brothel that is full of prostitutes who specialize in BDSM and cleaning smegma. One of the boys, Rufus, is drunk and yells at the other customers for their immorality before urinating on them. The next day, Rufus is killed by a thief. The other boys hear about this and misunderstand the news they are told. They believe Rufus was literally murdered by a man named Death. They agree to seek out Death for themselves and get revenge on him for murdering their friend. The youths then encounter an old man, who they accuse of conspiring with Death in order to kill the young, and demand at knifepoint that he tell them where Death is located.

Martha has long been rendered mute after witnessing both her parents being killed in a train crash when she was a child, her father saving her life by throwing out of a window before the train's worst wreckage. She communicates by hand gestures and tapping on the telephone receiver. Martha deliberately meets Jenny at the station to confront her fears. They see a violent bullfighting event together, but Martha is too distressed to watch and leaves. While Jenny and Martha are travelling to Martha's home, they notice a strange man with pearly eyes who seems to be following them.\nThat night, following a dinner party at Martha's villa, Jenny hears noises in the house and finds a broken vase. When she investigates, she is stabbed to death by an unseen figure. The following morning, Martha finds Jenny's corpse under the car in the garage. The police believe the killing is connected to the death of a teenage girl found in a ditch before, assuming a homicidal sex maniac is at large. Martha sees the strange man stalking her at the cemetery during Jenny's funeral, and when fleeing, he drops his pendant of a goat, revealing him as a Satanist. His hideout is soon found to be an abandoned building littered with morphine, but he's nowhere to be found. Martha continuously flashes back to pieces of imagery in her mind which come from her trauma and seem to relate to the murders. She later sees a cat with their throat slashed and lying in their own blood, the same cat Christina, the adolescent daughter of a family friend, was given as a present. Martha finds some comfort and companionship in her, even accepting a Snoopy necklace from her and giving her in return a Donald Duck wind-up toy.\nOne morning, Martha's housekeeper Annie Britton goes to run errands in town, taking her bicycle. En route back to Martha's house along a wooded road, Annie finds a strange occult symbol rendered in red paint on a tree, the same symbol police found in the ruined building where they suspect the Satanist performed Black Masses. Annie never returns from her errand, and Martha alerts her Uncle Ralph. Late that night, Martha's friend and therapist, Dr. Laurent, visits the villa, and finds Martha in a worried state. Martha notices a spot of blood on his pants, which Dr. Laurent attributes to a patient he treated earlier. Moments later, police phone the house, and Dr. Laurent answers: They inform him that Annie's corpse has been discovered in the woods, her throat slashed. A search reveals nothing, except the goat symbol painted into the tree.\nDuring a rainstorm, police catch the man, British hippie Woody Mason, breaking into a local doctor's office and stealing morphine, but are unable to stop him when he flees. Meanwhile, Martha cares for her Uncle Ralph, who is weakened by a heart ailment. Martha is assaulted in the home by an unseen figure when the power goes out, found with an electrical cord tied around her neck. But when police arrive to perform a wellness check shortly after, they find no one present. Police subsequently find Woody in a nearby cemetery and apprehend him, but he denies any involvement in Annie's murder, nor that of the teenage girl, whom he was dating. When questioned herself, Martha admits that she cannot positively identify Woody as her attacker. Uncle Ralph worries about Martha's mental state, having observed that she has been depressed. At Martha's villa, Christina goes missing while playing a sort of hide-and-seek with Martha involving a blindfold. She is shortly after discovered dead near the house, and it is determined she was strangled to death. Christina's murder prompts police to reopen their investigation, and Woody is ultimately acquitted of his charges when an autopsy proves that his girlfriend, the girl in a ditch, died of a heroin overdose. Uncle Ralph soon after succumbs to a heart attack and presumably dies, only to be revealed as alive later without Martha's knowledge.\nMartha is left alone at the villa one night, and finds herself again presumably being stalked by an assailant. She flees to the nearby cemetery and finds a pistol to use inside a crypt, only to find her chauffeur Marcos was following her. She is confronted by police officers, Dr. Laurent, and Uncle Ralph. Laurent informs Martha he filled her gun with blanks, and that Martha has been committing the murders all along in a dissociated state: Martha killed Jenny out of jealousy of her singing voice, then subsequently killed Annie in the woods to divert suspicion from her. She then strangled Christina to death when the girl had discovered evidence linking Martha to the crimes: the Snoopy necklace was found in the woods, and Uncle Ralph read Christina's diaries that said she found it covered in blood without knowing how it related to the murders.

These events were foretold in 1973 as testimony by two chimpanzee scientists, Cornelius and Zira, before they were killed. Widely believed to be dead, their baby was secretly raised by the circus owner Armando as a young horseback rider. In 1991, now fully grown and named Caesar, the ape is brought to one of the cities to distribute flyers for Armando's circus. During their trip, Armando advises Caesar not to speak in public for fear of his life.\nAfter seeing a gorilla being beaten and drugged, Caesar shouts out \"Lousy human bastards!\". Armando diffuses the ensuing commotion by taking responsibility for the exclamation. He plans to turn himself in to the authorities and bluff his way out while instructing Caesar to hide among the apes for safety. Caesar obeys and hides in a cage of orangutans, finding himself being trained for slavery through violent conditioning. He is then sold at auction to Governor Breck. Caesar is then put to work by Breck's chief aide MacDonald, whose African American heritage allows him to sympathize with the apes to the disgust of his boss.\nMeanwhile, Armando is interrogated by Inspector Kolp, who suspects his \"circus ape\" is the child of Cornelius and Zira. Kolp's assistant puts Armando under a machine that psychologically forces people to be truthful. Realizing he cannot fight the machine, Armando jumps through a window and dies. When Caesar learns of Armando's death, he loses faith in human kindness. In secret, he begins teaching the apes combat and has them gather weapons.\nUnfortunately, Breck eventually learns that Caesar is the ape the police are hunting. Meanwhile, Caesar realizes MacDonald is an ally to the apes' cause and reveals himself to him. MacDonald understands Caesar's intent to depose Breck, but expresses his doubts about the revolution's effectiveness. Caesar is later captured by Breck's men and is electrically tortured into speaking. Hearing him speak, Breck orders Caesar to be killed. With MacDonald's help, the heroes manage to trick Breck into believing Caesar died. Once Breck leaves, Caesar kills his torturer and escapes.\nTo build his numbers, Caesar takes over Ape Management. While setting the city on fire, Caesar and the rest of the apes proceed to the command center, killing most of the riot police that attempt to stop them in the process. After succeeding in this, Caesar has Breck marched out to be executed. MacDonald pleads with Caesar not to succumb to brutality and be merciful to the former masters. Caesar ignores him, deciding to dedicate his life to man's downfall.\nIn the theatrical cut, as the apes raise their rifles to beat Breck to death, Caesar's girlfriend Lisa voices her objection, shouting \"No!\".

Andersen visits the school, but departs, skeptical that such immature boys could handle the job.\nThe next morning, the boys show up at Andersen's ranch to volunteer for the drive. Andersen reluctantly tests their ability to stay on a bucking horse, and as they successively take turns, Cimarron, a boy slightly older than the others, rides up.

The man working there directs James to the address of Carlos's antique store; as Jim exits the mortuary, he fails to notice a coffin being prepared with his name, as well as the corpse of the woman tortured by the coven. Upon entering Carlos's store, James finds Carlos dead, a dagger in his heart, and is attacked by an unknown man, but manages to elude him. The incident prompts James to visit Dr. Dangal, a psychiatrist. During their visit, one of Dangal's other patients, Kitty\u2014the dominatrix coven leader\u2014rambling about being forced to do evil things. After she leaves, James remarks that she resembles the third woman in the painting.\nChris begins to make subtle attempts at murdering James, but none are successful. James discusses the changes in his wife's personality with Dangal, who begins to suspect she may be possessed. James and Dangal notice that the images in the painting seem to reappear at night, when neither Juana, Chris, or Nicodemus are active. Later, Dangal has a vision of the three witches dancing as he drives home. Kitty manifests an explosion that kills him on a bridge. After Dangal's funeral, Kitty attempts to seduce James, and then shows him another painting depicted a different scene of the witch burning, which shows the magistrate Roberson who ordered the execution; James observes that it bears a striking resemblance to himself. Kitty believes Jim is a descendant of Roberson, and that the women he executed have sought vengeance against every subsequent generation in his family.\nLater, the coven convenes in a dilapidated villa. Chris is strung up half-naked and beaten by Kitty, who accuses of her failing to fulfill her task. After she returns home, Chris drugs James, and she, Juana, and Kitty place him in his car atop a precipice with ice blocks beneath the tires. Just before midnight\u2014when the car should plunge over the cliff\u2014James awakens. Meanwhile, Chris, Kitty, and Juana, all gathered at a restaurant, come out of a deep trance. Juana introduces herself to the others as Almina Remundo, a nurse; Chris expresses fear about Jim's whereabouts, after which Kitty urges her to visit Dr. Dangal. Chris returns home by herself, and finds Jim there, alive. Though groggy, he recalls escaping the car before it plunged over the cliff. Nicodemus, who was previously antagonistic to James, is now friendly. Chris continues to feel something is awry.

It then shifts to summer 1942, in the same area, in the midst of World War II some ways behind the Soviet frontlines on the Eastern Front.\nHaving asked for soldiers who don't drink alcohol and fraternize with women, Company Sergeant Major Vaskov is unexpectedly assigned a group of young female anti-aircraft gunners in a railway station far from the front line. Vaskov is not used to commanding women and clashes with them over daily issues. During an air raid, one of the girls, Rita Osyanina, shoots down an enemy aircraft and is decorated for her deeds. Dialogue and flashbacks in color begin to reveal the backstories of the women. It is also shown that Rita regularly sneaks food back to her mother and baby, who are not far from the front.\nOne day, Rita, having secretly carried rations to her family during the night, comes across two German paratroopers on her way back to the garrison. Vaskov chooses five volunteers: Rita, Zhenya, Lisa, Galya and Sonia, to embark with him on a mission to eliminate them. They decide to cross the marshland to intercept the Germans but the going is slow and treacherous, causing Galya to lose a boot. When they finally reach the location that Vaskov knows that the German paratroopers will have to pass, they lie in wait\u2014only to find that there are sixteen German paratroopers instead of two. His soldiers come up with the idea to bluff the paratroopers into thinking that there are a lot of civilians in their path, by cutting down trees and lighting fires, which will cause the Germans to change direction. Though the plan almost fails, Zhenya's last-minute audacity in jumping into the river convinces the paratroopers to take a detour through the forest. Vaskov sends Lisa back to base for reinforcements.\nThe group left in the forest prepare to reroute to avoid direct contact with the German troops. Backs against the wall, they engage in guerrilla warfare with the Germans. Sonia is killed by a knife and Galya is shot and dies immediately from her wounds. Vaskov, to create a diversion, leads the Germans away from the remaining two soldiers, firing at them with his Nagant revolver as they chase him through the forest. Vaskov is shot in the arm but manages to escape from the Germans\u2014realizing that the reinforcements have not come, he hallucinates about Lisa, who tells him that she failed because she went too fast, drowning in the wet marshland.\nHe miraculously comes across Rita and Zhenya but after a tearful reunion realizes that they have disobeyed his orders to retreat. He searches in his bag for a grenade to mount a suicide attack with but finds that the girls have taken the detonator out. Although he threatens to court martial them for continuing to disobey orders, they refuse to leave and instead prepare to ambush the Germans. During a prolonged engagement, Rita is injured by shrapnel from a grenade and tells Zhenya to leave her. Realizing that they are cornered, Zhenya disobeys Vaskov's orders to cover them and instead taunts and lures the Germans away through the forest, as Vaskov did earlier and is killed. Vaskov stays with Rita against her wishes to treat her wounds and promises to take her back to base. She asks him to take care of her son in the neighboring village. After kissing her at her request, he leaves to find a way out, giving her the revolver but soon comes back to find that Rita has shot herself.\nThe desperate Vaskov, armed only with a knife, one shot in his revolver and a grenade without a fuze, returns to the cabin where the Germans are resting from their wounds. By stabbing a soldier, shooting another and bluffing with the grenade, he captures a submachine gun and forces the remaining Germans to drop their weapons. Vaskov threatens to kill them (Five girls... five young girls were here, only five, and you did not pass! You'll croak here, everyone will croak!.. I'll kill each of you with my own hands... with my own hands! And let them judge me...), but a Soviet radio communique calms him, and he eventually takes the three remaining Germans as prisoners back to Soviet lines. The rest of the women of the regiment, who have come to rescue the group, find Vaskov before he passes out from exhaustion.\nThirty years after the war ends, Vaskov visits the area of the battle again with an officer, implied to be Rita's son.

The Stranger frees Jakub in the midst of a riot, tells him to return home, and sends a white-clad nun named Zakonnica (Monika Niemczyk) to accompany Jakub. Zakonnica appears to be a representation of goodness/God and the Stranger a representation of evil/the Devil. Through most of the movie, Zakonnica remains in a state of stunned horror at the things she and Jakub witness.\nAlong the way, Jakub (who is constantly followed by the Stranger) encounters a hedonistic group of actors, all of whom wish to seduce him. He finds that his best friend and co-conspirator told Jakub's pregnant fianc\u00e9e that Jakub was killed and has married her instead (it also appears that Jakub's friend is now working for the King). Jakub returns home to find that his father committed suicide and his sister has gone mad. The household is being run by his half-brother, who mocks Jakub's cause and intends to marry Jakub's sister (whom he mercilessly beats). Jakub also learns that his mother (who abandoned Jakub and his sister as children) actually has lived close by their entire lives, running a bordello. He confronts his mother at the bordello (the mother does not appear to recognize Jakub) where they almost sleep together (intra-family sexual taboos are a theme throughout the film: the sister is betrothed to her half-brother and was seemingly raped by their father after the father went insane; and Jakub appears to have romantic feelings for his mom and sister). Jakub  takes out his rage on a prostitute in the bordello, slitting her throat with a straight razor given to him by the Stranger.\nRepulsed by his actions, Jakub seeks comfort from Zakonnica, but she pushes him away. Jakub appears to go mad. He returns to his friend's castle to try and reunite with his fianc\u00e9e, only to be beaten (and then, kissed) by his former best friend.

Zakonnica helps a delirious Jakub flee into the woods where they are encountered once more by the Stranger. The Stranger demands Jakub sign a document identifying all his former friends and family as conspirators against the king and crediting the Stranger with bringing the conspiracy down (this seems to confirm the Mother's claims that the Stranger is indeed a man working for the government).

Following the ghost's request, the soldier killed the culprit with poison.\nSimone meets Acosta at his apartment.

Barney, unaware that Eddie is planning to use the dogs in his heist, reluctantly agrees to train the six Dobermans, to which Eddie bestows the names of famous bank robbers (Dillinger, Bonnie, Clyde, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson and Ma Barker).

Giuseppe Barra, a local simpleton spying on two locals engaged with visiting prostitutes, is surprised when the three boys who are watching him begin to taunt him. Meanwhile, in the hills surrounding the village, La Magiara, a reclusive Gypsy witch, conducts black magic ceremonies, first by digging up the skeletal remains of an infant and then plunging pins through the heads of three tiny clay dolls. It is made clear that these are the three youths taunting Giuseppe.\nWhen Bruno goes missing, a media circus begins as reporters from all over Italy converge on the town. One of them is Andrea Martelli, a sharp-witted journalist from Rome whose insights into the case are acknowledged by the regional police commissioner working with the collaboration of the village chief of police Captain Modesti. Amid local hysteria, Giuseppe is arrested when he picks up a ransom he demanded from the boy's parents for the boy's return. While he takes police to the buried body of Bruno, he protests his innocence of murder, for he claims to have only discovered the body of the boy and then phoned the parents in a feeble attempt to extract a surprisingly small ransom. When the corpse of Tonino is found, the police realize that Giuseppe is innocent. A few nights later, during a raging thunderstorm, Michele sneaks out of his house to meet with someone he speaks to over the phone, and he too is strangled by an unseen assailant, and his body is found the following morning.\nMartelli soon meets and befriends Patrizia, whom he recognizes from newspapers where he used to work in Milan. Patrizia is living at her father's house in the town as she is lying low after a drug scandal. The rest of the insular villagers ostracize her because of her big-city ways, perceived lack of morality, and modern dress style with halter-tops and mini-skirts. She has various seemingly sinister interactions with several children from the town, including Michele, with whom she seductively teases, then rejects, while nude; Mario, a young boy whom she offers the choice of either payment or a kiss in exchange for fixing a flat tire; and Malvina, priest Don Alberto\u2019s disabled sister, who is dragged by Patrizia across the town square against her will, in order that Patrizia could buy Malvina a doll.\nMartelli also meets with the amiable young village priest, Don Alberto Avallone, and his reserved mother, Aurelia. Don Alberto runs a boys' group at the church, which the murder victims belonged to, and encourages the boys to play soccer on the church grounds to keep them out of trouble. As the local priest, he is well-known and respected in the area.\nMeanwhile, Captain Modesti and his aide visit Francesco, an eccentric old hermit living in a tumbledown stone hut in the hills overlooking the town, who practices black magic, offering charms and potions to the superstitious. He claims he has passed his magical knowledge to his daughter, Magiara, and also spends time with the casual thrill-seeking Patrizia. He is also rumored to have had (and then disposed of) a baby from a tryst with Magiara. Angered by Francesco's unwillingness to co-operate with the investigation, the police proceed to hunt down and arrest Magiara. Under interrogation, the fevered woman gleefully confesses to the murders. However, it appears to Modesti and the Commissioner that she believes her voodoo dolls and incantations have alone brought about the deaths of the three interfering boys, and she professes to have no interest in or awareness of the physical methods used. An alibi provided by a policeman sighting Magiara miles away from the latest murder scene clinches her innocence, and she is released.\nNonetheless, the hostile and superstitious villagers are not convinced: Magiara is shunned by the local women and then attacked in a local graveyard by a small group of men who savagely beat her with heavy chains and then leave her for dead. She manages to crawl to the highway but dies. The following day, another young boy is found drowned in a local stream, which further increases police frustration about the case.\nDuring further meetings with Don Alberto, Martelli learns that Don Alberto's mother has a young child, a six-year-old deaf and mute girl with an intellectual disability. Martelli becomes convinced that the little girl is a witness to the killings after seeing that she compulsively pulls the heads off her dolls as if imitating the strangulations. One doll's head, that of Donald Duck, is found near the latest crime scene. When Aurelia disappears with her daughter, Martelli and Patrizia track her down hiding out at a remote shack on a hill overlooking the town. When they arrive, Aurelia is found barely conscious, begging them to help her stop her crazy son. It turns out that Don Alberto strangled those young boys, not for their sins but to prevent them from sinning when they grow up.

The first story, \"The Heptagon\", opens on a somber note at the funeral of college student Johnny Davis. His friends Dave, Frank and Randy are in attendance at the burial. It is revealed that they played a seemingly innocent phone prank on Johnny, telling him to go to a certain address where a date was waiting. The old woman who lived at the address accidentally shot Johnny to death. As the funeral service ends, Johnny's mother (who is the seventh daughter of a seventh son) recites a cryptic message to the three young men she blames for the death of her son: \"One by land, two by sky...seven times around go the three of you, and may your reward be just and true.\" Later Frank relates this story to a priest, Father Duane, sitting next to him on a plane. He says that Dave was run over and killed seven days after the funeral. The priest tries to ease Frank's anxiety,  assuring him that it's all a coincidence. However, after Father Duane exits the plane, it crashes upon takeoff. On the runway Father Duane attempts to comfort a dying Frank, who tells him that exactly fourteen days have passed since Johnny's burial. The troubled priest\u2014beginning to suspect that there might be more to this pattern of deaths than mere chance\u2014speaks to his superior, who suggests telephoning the remaining young man at the state university. Father Duane tries to call Randy but instead reaches his roommate, who tells him that Randy has gone skydiving. It is now twenty-one days after Johnny's burial, the narrator reminds us, and according to Mrs. Davis's prophecy, two of the young men would perish by sky.\nThe second story, \"The Darkness\", is set in rural Missouri during the early twentieth century and involves the disappearance of a boy's dog in the vicinity of a mysterious hole in the ground. Concerned about the inexplicable moaning sounds coming from the hole, the boy's father agrees to be lowered in on a rope to see if he can recover the dog and to find out what's making the noise. Suddenly a terrifying scream emerges from the depths of the pit and the boy's father, now a raving lunatic, is hoisted back up. The mystery of the hole is never solved, and the story closes with the narrator's revelation that the father spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum.\nThe final segment, \"The Girl on the Bridge\", involves a strange disoriented girl and the Arkansas state senator who attempts to give her a ride home. Most of the story unfolds via the girl's flashbacks; as the senator and his wife arrive at the address the girl had given them, they find that she has mysteriously vanished from the back seat of the car. The girl's elderly father answers the door, telling the senator that his daughter died in a car accident many years earlier when she and her boyfriend were leaving town to get married. The father had disapproved of the relationship and told his daughter that he would rather see her dead.\nAccording to the opening narration, the stories are based on research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rankin, a parapsychologist, but this is evidently a fictional device as no record of the name \"Jonathan Rankin\" exists in the annals of para-psychological research.

Though from a working class background, Michael aspires to a life of luxury and is obsessed with the fine arts. Through his travels as a chauffeur, he discovers a spot along the Devon coast known as Gypsy's Acre, where a dilapidated Victorian mansion sits. Michael fantasizes about one day building a new home on the plot of land and aims to one day have Santonix, a famed Italian architect whom he met through a client, design the home.\nWhile photographing Gypsy's Acre, Michael meets Ellie Thomsen, a young American visiting England, who is quickly taken by Michael's fantastical nature. While exploring the property, the two encounter Miss Townsend, a mysterious old woman who tells Michael that Gypsy's Acre is for sale, but that it is a cursed land. Ellie leaves England and embarks on the remainder of her trip through Switzerland and Italy with Greta, her German language tutor who has taken on the role of a personal assistant. In Ellie's absence, Michael learns that she is in fact one of the richest young women in the world. He confronts her about this when she returns to England, but she explains she did not want to tell him as she thought it would dissuade him from pursuing her. She also reveals that, while visiting Italy, she was able to arrange a meeting with Santonix about building Michael's dream home. Furthermore, she reveals she has purchased Gypsy's Acre.\nThough initially angered by her deceit, Michael eventually relents, and he and Ellie marry in Wales. Ellie attempts to keep the marriage secret, as she fears her stepmother, Cora, and other family members may attempt to bribe Michael to divorce her based on his lower social class, but the union quickly makes international headlines. The family's attorney, whom Ellie lovingly refers to as \"Uncle\" Andrew swiftly attempts to buy Michael off, but he declines, insisting he and Ellie are in love. The couple subsequently purchases a local antique shop to operate.\nAs construction of the home begins, Greta arrives, announcing she has taken a secretary job in London and begins to slowly infiltrate the couple's new life together. Ellie is welcoming of her presence, but Michael dislikes her. Frank and the other family members approach Greta with similar scepticism, and wish to distance her from Ellie. At the house, Ellie becomes unnerved when she notices Miss Townsend staring at the home from the fields below for hours at a time. While Michael attends an auction in the city, Ellie goes missing while out riding her horse. Her body is subsequently found in the woods on Gypsy's Acre. An autopsy suggests she died of unexpected cardiac arrest, but Michael contests this during the inquest, believing there may be foul play. Police attempt to track Miss Townsend but are unable to locate her. After the inquest, Andrew notifies Michael that Ellie made him the sole beneficiary of her estate, and urges Michael to travel to the United States to tend to Ellie's business dealings there. Santonix, meanwhile, dies after a protracted battle with cancer.\nUpon returning to Gypsy's Acre from the United States, Michael witnesses an apparition of Ellie as he approaches the house. Upon entering, he and Greta embrace romantically, and begin to have sex\u2014it is revealed the two lovers had conspired all along, preying on Ellie to take her estate: Greta killed her by lacing her allergy medicine with cyanide and bee venom, which stopped her heart. Michael and Greta's plans of a lavish life together are swiftly interrupted, however, when they receive an envelope postmarked from New York City\u2014sent by Andrew\u2014containing date-stamped photographs of them together long before Michael had met Ellie, serving as evidence of their conspiracy.

Gianni Puppis arrives at Rome's airport to greet the female president of the Republic of Urania. Puppis, a contender for the next Italian Chief (President) of State, is captured on film furtively groping her bottom as she greets the Italian press. No one notices the incident, and the victim is unsure who was responsible due to the crowd gathered around her. The TV film editor studies the film with a colleague and remarks, \"but he's queer!\" Still photos of the incident fall into the hands of a highly unorthodox priest called Father Lucian, an old college friend of Puppis. He arranges a meeting with the bemused politician in a confessional booth and then demands blackmail money for the pictures. Puppis is furious but mystified, for he cannot remember anything about the incident. He leaves the confessional booth refusing to pay. That night, Puppis has a strange dream in which a naked young woman beckons him, superimposed over the circular plaza of St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican.\nPuppis calls the unscrupulous Father Lucian and offers him the money. In return, Lucian offers to arrange a consultation with a German psychiatrist. During the session, Puppis describes his recent affliction: his dreams and waking thoughts are becoming obsessed with behinds, primarily female ones, despite his open preference for fey young men like his personal chauffeur Carmelino. Asses fill his thoughts and even precipitate black-outs, during which he commits terrible acts of bottom-pinching. \"We've got to lick this thing,\" says Father Lucian. Puppis leaves, vowing to maintain his self-control. But later that day, his hands wander while standing behind a young lady in an elevator at the Senate offices.\nThe next day, Puppis announces that he is going on a \"spiritual retreat\" until the results of the elections are announced. Father Lucian drives the frantic Puppis into the countryside, stopping at a filling station to get gas. Puppis experiences a veritable barrage of ladies' bottoms at the filling station forecourt. Before Father Lucian can stop him, Puppis has lurched over to one tartan-frocked figure bent over to examine the a car's engine, only to find himself face to face with a furious kilt-wearing Scotsman. Later that day, Lucian and Puppis finally arrive at a cloister run by his friend Father Schirer, a priest and psychiatrist. However, Puppis is blind drunk after consuming several bottles of liquor he bought at the rest stop. Father Schirer welcomes the esteemed patient and informs the barely conscious man that his many skilled nurses will help him. The clinic is staffed by nuns, all of them young and beautiful. That night, Father Schirer is woken up when one of the nurses assigned to watch over Puppis is grabbed on her bottom by the sleeping man. Father Schirer tells the nun that she must remain still until morning, as waking the patent would be too traumatic, under the circumstances.\nBack in Rome, Senator Puppis' absence is the subject of heated discussions. His political opponents to the more conservative Sen. Torsello have been bugging his telephone and are puzzled over coded conversations between Puppis and Father Lucian. But the Italian Army has been bugging the senate phones in the hope of learning something that will ensure the planned military coup stays on course. The Vatican secret police, led by the persistent Mafioso Don Gesualdo, have been bugging the Army's phones and learning about Puppi's mysterious exit. Cardinal Maravigili, an influential member of the clergy, which has the real power in Italy, is sitting in his office watching the film footage of Puppis at the airport. Cardinal Maravigili is enraged, for apparently, Puppis owes his political success to shady deals with the Vatican and military hierarchy. Maravigili, a manipulative sociopath willing to murder to facilitate divine will, has groomed Puppis for the position of president. Even Puppis' preference for men is tolerated because the Cardinal confides in Don Gesualdo that he prefers that Puppis should be homosexual, expecting minor scandal from this man than the customary womanizing of Italian politicians.\nAt the spiritual retreat, Puppis describes a dream to Father Schirer while under hypnosis, featuring the devout nurses at the clinic and visions of the Garden of Eden where foliage bursts with naked female bottoms. The next night, Puppis sleepwalks to Father Schirer's room and molests him while he is fast asleep. Protecting his vow of chastity, the priest/analyst wakes up the randy senator. Once fully awake, Puppis realizes his actions and professes to feel much better, claiming his dreams have liberated his mind. Puppis returns to Rome full of optimism about his cure the following morning. However, back at the clinic, when Father Schirer takes confession from the nuns, he discovers that Puppis' rampaging sexual dreams have been enacted for real. The libidinous sisters all recount sexual encounters with Puppis.\nAn angry Father Schirer arrives at Puppis' house and demands an explanation. He is forced to hide when Cardinal Maravigili comes unexpectedly to meet Puppis.

Unaware of Schirer's sudden demise, Puppis leaves with Cardinal Maravigili to a garden party before celebrating the Italian Republic's founding. After experiencing erotic visions, Puppis swiftly seduces the French ambassador's wife in the bushes. Back at Puppis' house, Carmelino discovers the dead body of Father Schirer and rushes to tell Puppis, only to be grabbed and taken away by Don Gesualdo, leading the Vatican secret police.\nReturning home that evening, Puppis is met by Sister Hildergardt, the only one of the cloistered order not to have been ravished by him. Begging him to relieve her of temptation and simultaneously scolding him for wickedness, she implores that they whip each for their sins. Just as the twisted couple gets down to it, the Vatican thugs arrive. Puppis and Sister Hildergardt escape through a back window.\nHiding out in a secluded motel room, Puppis and Sister Hildegarde are tracked down, and Don Gesualdo and his thugs take her away. Cardinal Maravigli confronts Puppis in the motel room, and he tells the Cardinal that he wants out of politics. But the Cardinal replies that there will be none of that talk. Too much time and effort have been expended behind the scenes to hoist Puppis into position. The Cardinal takes Puppis into the bowels of the Vatican to view waxworks of recently canonized saints. They include Carmelino and Father Lucian, as well as Father Schirer. The threat to Puppis is made explicit when he is told to look carefully at an unfinished rough wax model. Staring at the shapeless features, Puppis imagines a waxwork of himself.

When Nanny bursts into the office to complain about her eviction, Ganucci, impressed with her accent, hires her despite her protests that she is not a child's nursemaid. Realizing Ganucci is a gangster despite Vito and Mario's insistence that \"There's no such thing as the mafia,\" Nanny accepts the job, but plots with her pianist Luther to kidnap Lewis and demand a $50,000 ransom with which she can set up a new studio. In Naples, Ganucci tries to avoid work and tells Stella that Nanny will lend class to Lewis, whom he hopes will grow up with no connection to the mafia. Despite Ganucci's wishes, Lewis is at that moment pretending to be a mafia boss and groping Nanny, who handles him with aplomb. Luther, who believes Ganucci is a retired soft drink manufacturer, bumbles his way through a break-in and absconds with Lewis, who calmly stops to put on the watch his father gave him. Ganucci has told Nanny to call Benny Napkins, one of his flunkies, in case of trouble, so she now advises him of the \"kidnapping.\" Benny, a cowardly young man, is easily convinced by Nanny to keep the matter quiet and try to raise the ransom money himself. Meanwhile, two con men in Italy persuade Ganucci to purchase some gold medallions for $50,000, and he wires Vito and Mario for the money. The lawyers deliberate endlessly over how to send the money, finally deciding to send Benny to Naples with a bundle of cash.

Nanny bails him out, bathes him and puts him to bed, where he asks her to retire with him to his cottage in the country. After they make love, Mario knocks on the door and gives Benny $50,000 to deliver to Naples. Nanny is thrilled but Benny points out that it is not their money. Meanwhile, the police, realizing that Benny works for Ganucci, return the confiscated money to Vito, who, believing it is the same $50,000 that Mario delivered to Benny, returns the money to Benny's house. Now holding two envelopes containing $50,000 each, Benny breaks down in confusion and tells Nanny he is just an organization man and cannot use Ganucci's money without his approval. Disappointed, she leaves. Taking matters into her own hands, Nanny tells Mario and Vito about the kidnapping, but as soon as they give her the ransom, they hear from Ganucci that he is returning from Italy, and confident that their boss can handle the matter himself, take the money back. At the same time, Dominick, a petty thief, breaks into Luther's house and steals Lewis' watch as the child sleeps. Benny is at his friend's bar when Dominick enters and tries to use the watch as barter. When Dominick reads aloud the inscription on the watch, Benny realizes Dominick robbed the house in which Lewis is being held, and demands that Dominick take him there. They go to Luther's apartment, where Luther has just learned that Lewis is indeed Ganucci's son, and, panicked, is planning to return him to his father. Ida, however, refuses to let Lewis go and escapes with him out the window just as Nanny shows up to bring the boy home. As Nanny and Luther leave to track down Ida, Benny breaks in but, finding the apartment empty, decides to send Dominick to Nanny with one of the $50,000 envelopes so she can pay the ransom.

Carol and Jane are met by fellow actors John and Tony, as well as Mike, the play's director. Inside the theatre, the group find actors Simon and Angela, who arrived prior. Yet to arrive is Julia Dawson, an actress who has recently forged a film career.\nWith local hotels closed due to it being the off-season, the cast are required to stay in the theatre during rehearsals. On the first night, Carol and Tony spend the night together, leaving Jane to room with Angela, who makes sexual advances toward her, which John witnesses. In the middle of the night, Angela goes missing and the group are awoken by the sounds of a woman screaming. Mike finds Angela's severed head in the basement, along with her body, which lay on a prop guillotine. Mike keeps his discovery a secret from the others. Later, a gloved individual fondles Angela's severed head. Mike summons local police to investigate, but when they arrive, they find several mannequin heads, but no sight of Angela's body. Police assume Mike's claim to be imagined. Mike subsequently discovers a note apparently written by Angela in which she states she had to quit the play.\nJulia subsequently arrives at the theatre in the middle of the night. The following morning, she accompanies Mike on a walk, and tells him she feels a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu while inside the theatre. Mike confesses his experience from the night before, when he found Angela's corpse, which then vanished. That night, after getting into a fight with Tony, Carol goes for a walk along the pier. She is approached by what appears to be a cloaked vagrant who begins to sexually assault her. Mike and Julia go to search for her, and hear her screaming. Carol is saved moments after the assailant brandishes a butcher knife, and he flees. Mike realizes after that John is now missing, and suspects he may have been Carol's attacker.\nMeanwhile, actress Sarah Hales, who is staying with her aunt, Mrs. Saunders, nearby, is hired as a replacement for Angela. Sarah's aunt opens her home to the actors, allowing them to dine and bathe there during rehearsals. Mrs. Saunders, along with her friend Major Bell, recounts the Dome theatre's history to the actors, including a story about how actor Harry Mulligan, his deranged co-star Sir Arnold Gates, and Gates's wife, Pamela, all went missing there during World War II. The story piques Julia's interest, and she visits the local library to reviews newspaper articles about the disappearances.\nMajor Bell visits the theatre and startles Sarah in her dressing room. Bell requests to observe the actors' rehearsals, which Mike agrees to at a later date. Meanwhile, Carol goes to retrieve a costume from the basement, and is locked inside by Tony, pulling a prank. A figure with a flashlight approaches her in a corridor, illuminating two skeletal remains, before she is attacked. Two fisherman find Carol floating below the pier, severely injured, and she subsequently dies in hospital.

The crew manages to escape with a bag of money and drives back to Paris, where they put Marc in a private clinic under the name \"Schmidt\".\nCommissaire Edouard Coleman spends his nights driving around Paris from crime scene to crime scene. He also meets with his informants, such as Gaby, a transgender prostitute who is currently feeding him information about an upcoming drug shipment that involves one of her clients. Edouard goes to the nightclub Simon owns just after it closes for the night and plays the piano while Simon's girlfriend, Cathy, watches and the employees clean up. Simon gets back from Saint-Jean-de-Monts, and Edouard greets him with a friendly look before getting called away by his partner, Inspector Morand.\nDeciding they have to get Marc out of the clinic before the police search the facility, Simon, Louis, and Paul get an ambulance and make fake transfer paperwork. A nurse says Marc is too sick to be moved and will not release him to them, however, so they send Cathy into his room dressed as a nurse, and she injects air into his IV, causing a fatal embolism. Edouard catches the case of trying to figure out the true identity of \"Schmidt\", but he does not expect to succeed. He meets Cathy in a hotel room for a tryst and, when she asks if he thinks Simon suspects anything, says he thinks Simon has always known about their affair.\nIt turns out Simon only robbed the bank to fund his plan to steal a shipment of heroin, which just so happens to be the same shipment Edouard hopes to intercept. The mule, Mathieu \"la Valise\", boards a night train from Paris to Lisbon, and his associates deliver the drugs to him in Bordeaux, so Edouard makes arrangements for Mathieu to be picked up in Bayonne. However, Simon's crew have bought a helicopter, which Louis hovers over the moving train once it is out in the country. Paul lowers Simon onto the roof, and Simon breaks into Mathieu's cabin, knocks Mathieu out, and steals the drugs.\nFurious that the drugs were not recovered, Edouard berates Gaby and slaps her around for supposedly giving him bad information. When Morand brings him the news that Marc had a criminal record, so investigators were able to learn his real name, Edouard recognizes it as that of an associate of Louis, who is a known associate of Simon. He calls Simon, who is not available, and then calls his chief to ask if Marc's name can be kept out of the news, but the chief says he is too late.\nEdouard arrests Louis at a restaurant and brings him to the precinct, where he somehow (likely using some form of torture) manages to get the seemingly-indomitable man to name Simon and Paul. He goes to Simon's club alone and asks Simon if he knows Marc, Paul, or Louis, which Simon denies, and then lets Simon know Louis talked before leaving. Simon calls to warn Paul, but Edouard and some of his men arrive outside his building as they talk. While the police burst into Paul's apartment and past his wife, he gets a gun, and Edouard lets him shoot himself in the head.\nSimon takes the drugs and hides out in a hotel, but, when he calls Cathy to pick him up, the police trace the call. As he walks to her car, Edouard, gun drawn, calls his name and tells him not to move. He approaches Edouard and reaches into his overcoat, so Edouard shoots. When no gun is found on Simon's body, Morand asks why Edouard shot so quickly, and Edouard says he was not sure Simon was going to kill himself.

Whilst fabricating he is notified that, that person who seemed dying miraculously survived, leaving his half-done coffin to no use, much to his irritation. However, the Father arrives and informs Anthony that a daughter was born, but also clarifies his half-done coffin was not merely a waste since his wife did not survive the labour. Shadowed with sadness, he raises his daughter, (Named Marie, after Mother Mary) baptised by the father of the church he goes to. Life moves on.\nYears later, his teen-aged daughter, (Marie) sent to the city for pursuing her education, comes home on holiday. The eldest Father blesses both Marie and Anthony and expresses his desire for Marie to reach the pinnacle of her career (that she was doing well) and must be capable of building trust organisations, education systems and hospitals for the well-being of the needy. Anthony desires that his daughter fulfill father's wishes that he even refuses to get her married to someone in near future. Later, Lawrence, a police officer, and Anthony's long-lost childhood friend are introduced to Anthony by the elder Father. A mutual and solid friendship bonds between the two.\nCurious about his friends' daughters' intelligence traits, Lawrence expresses his interest to meet Marie, which Anthony accedes to. Lawrence and Anthony arrive at Anthony's home and both get shocked seeing Anthony's daughter in a prurient position with an unknown male, infuriating Anthony as he always considered her his divine gift from God, and lunges to kill her and her lover. Lawrence confronts Anthony's rage and stops him and gets his daughter to exchange rings as an informal marriage to her male lover in the very place they were caught and makes Anthony swear not to make any worse of the situation in the name of the Lord. Anthony, controlled by Lawrence's deed, informs this quagmire to the Father at the church the next day. The Father, seeking to correct things, makes Anthony arrange formally the marriage between the two. Anthony seeks the male friend who his daughter was caught with.\nTracing the boy as a different religion, Anthony meets a Hindu doctor who the boy claimed to be his father, but is devastated to found out he was a profuse liar. However, finding him, Anthony persuades him gently and pleads him to marry his daughter. But knowing his real playboy attitude, and his atrocity in refusing to marry Marie anguishes Anthony, who forcibly brings the boy to the church in order to do his wedding with his daughter. But things go horribly when he brought the boy to the church. He had accidentally killed the boy in the scuffle even though he didn't wish to.

Attributing his short temper and roguish nature whenever he gets anguished was that which lead him to being guilty despite being innocent by heart, the father gives Anthony a holy candlestick and makes Anthony promise him such that he should become a person of grown wisdom and requests him to act with purity.

He gets shocked to see his own daughter Marie as a teacher in that same church, who he had assumed expired. Before he could confess to Marie that he was none other than her own father, he comes to notice Lawrence was still around. As a guardian of Marie and her family, Lawrence was always around them fulfilling his promise of supporting his friend Anthony's family should he be absent. Anthony's escape led the police department to suspect Lawrence since they were once best friends, and hence his promotion was denied.

He relieves tension by drawing faces on squashes and tomatoes and then crushing them with his bare hands. Gentry also suspects the leader of a radical feminist group that riots in the strip club, carrying banners with catchy phrases like \"Lewd is Crude\", \"Quit with Tit\" and \"Women Right On!\".

Wermeer is holed up in Gila Bend by a swarm of bounty killers, who want his $3,000 reward, posted by Saxon's three sons David, Eli and Adam. A sheriff named Clayton arrives on a stagecoach and bosses his way through the cordon set up by the local lawmen. While walking to the saloon, he performs actions that tip off Wermeer as to where some of the besiegers are hidden (like throwing a lit match so a man hidden in hay has to put it out). Wermeer makes it to the saloon, where Clayton, who has counted Wermeer's shots and knows that he is out of bullets, arrests him. Hole, a spokesman for the bounty killers, calls on Wermeer to surrender. A shot rings out and Clayton emerges dragging the \"dead\" convict. They argue that Clayton is a sheriff and therefore he cannot collect bounty, and that he instead should give up the body. The disagreement develops into a gunfight. Wermeer jumps up on a horse and escapes, pursued by the pack (though not Clayton). Wermeer makes the bounty hunters follow his horse, then hitches a ride with the stagecoach, where he finds Clayton among the passengers.\nWhen the group stay the night at Silver Bells, Wermeer goes for a shotgun hanging on the wall, but Clayton stops him. A drunken stationmaster assures the gun is empty, but Clayton retorts: \"Never consider a gun empty\". Then he and Wermeer play cards, Wermeer betting his $3,000 bounty. Wermeer wins and Clayton promises to take him to Saxon city as he wants. Wermeer steals a revolver from Clayton's bag, but is told that it is empty. Wermeer repeats Clayton's earlier saying and pulls the trigger, but Clayton shows him the bullet, taking it out of his mouth. Wermeer tries to leave, but Clayton shoots the door, this time with the other five bullets. Meanwhile, the bounty hunters led by Hole surround the house. They give Wermeer thirty seconds. He and Clayton are inside with Elisabeth, a female passenger who has earlier shown interest in Wermeer. Clayton tells her that Wermeer is innocent and that he saw who did it, but if Wermeer walks out the door he will never know. Wermeer gives himself up. Hole and two of the bounty hunters now kill the others in their pack, then ride off with Wermeer.\nClayton finds them beating and questioning Wermeer in a waterfall, asking where the silver of his father is and offering to let him go if he tells. Clayton shoots off the rope and liberates him. Wermeer asks if he is still a prisoner. When Clayton says no, he holds a gun against Clayton and rides off to Saxon city on the latter's horse. After arriving Wermeer confronts the Saxon sons, Adam and Eli. He accuses Eli (who is the town's sheriff) and asks who killed his father. We also learn that Hole was sent by Eli to find out who really killed the old man Saxon. Clayton arrives and demands that the Saxons reopen Wermeer's case. Wermeer sends word to his friends and people loyal to his father to gather at the silver mine. A duel between Hole and Wermeer is supervised by Clayton after he reveals that it was Hole who killed Wermeer's father, following orders from Ebenezer Saxon. An ambusher is there helping Hole, but Wermeer shoots him without Clayton interfering. (In a German-language version, the dying Hole says he killed Wermeer because the latter refused to share the silver.)\nDavid Saxon, the oldest of the brothers and the one responsible of running the town, orders Adam to stop the people heading to the silver mine. Shortly after, Adam massacres Wermeer's followers with hidden explosives and a machine gun. He also kills his own men, following his brother David's instructions to not leave any witnesses. Meanwhile David meets with Clayton, who says that they both know who killed the old man Saxon. David offers $25.000 if he and Wermeer leave town. Clayton relays the offer that the charge will be dropped. Wermeer replies that the Saxons made the offer because \"dead people don't need a leader\", and reveals the wagon in which he carries the bodies of those killed by Adam. Adam shoots him from a window, though Elisabeth, who arrived in town to marry Adam, cries out a warning. Clayton escapes during the gunfight.\nIn the morning, Wermeer is to be hanged. Clayton says he knows who is the real killer. David wants the hanging to continue but Eli says that he must know. Clayton confesses that he himself did it, explaining that Ebenezer Saxon killed Wermeer's father, and that David Saxon bought the judge who sentenced Philip Wermeer and stripped Clayton of his title of Sheriff after he stood in trial to declare him innocent, so justice could only be done \"the Saxon way\". Clayton also denounces the massacre at the silver mine, and the Saxons agree to meet Clayton at the cattle pens. At the confrontation, when Clayton approaches, David says that the three must draw first to overcome Clayton's faster and expert gunplay.

He starts out with a .30-caliber Hawken percussion rifle, which he uses as his main rifle until he finds the frozen body of mountain man Hatchet Jack clutching a .50-caliber Hawken rifle. Jack's will gives his rifle to the man who finds his corpse. With his new rifle, Johnson inadvertently disrupts the grizzly bear hunt of the elderly and eccentric Chris Lapp, nicknamed \"Bear Claw\", who mentors him on living in the high country. After a brush with Crows, including Lapp's acquaintance Paints-His-Shirt-Red, and learning the skills required to survive, Johnson sets off on his own.\nHe comes across a cabin whose inhabitants were apparently attacked by Blackfoot warriors, leaving only a woman and her uncommunicative son alive. The woman, maddened by grief, forces Johnson to adopt her son. He and the boy, whom Johnson dubs \"Caleb\", come across Del Gue, a mountain man who has been robbed by the Blackfeet and buried by them up to his neck in sand. Gue persuades Johnson to help recover his stolen goods, but Johnson counsels against violence when they find the Blackfoot camp.\nThe men sneak into the camp at night to retrieve Gue's possessions, but Gue opens fire and the mountain men then kill the Blackfeet. Gue takes several Blackfoot horses and scalps. Johnson, disgusted with the needless killing, returns to Caleb. Soon afterward, they are surprised by Christianized Flatheads, who take them in as guests of honor. Johnson unknowingly places the chief in his debt by giving him the Blackfeet horses and scalps. According to Flathead custom, to maintain his honor the chief must now either give his guest a greater gift or kill him. The chief gives his daughter Swan to be Johnson's bride. After the wedding, Gue goes off on his own and Johnson, Caleb and Swan journey into the wilderness. Johnson finds a suitable location to build a cabin. They settle into this new home and slowly become a family.\nThis idyllic life is interrupted by the arrival of a U.S. Army cavalry rescue party tasked with saving a stranded wagon train of settlers. Although Johnson is reluctant, he is pressed into guiding the rescue party through the mountains, leaving his family alone at their cabin. During the journey, Lieutenant Mulvey orders the party to proceed directly through a sacred Crow burial ground against Johnson's advice. Afterward, Johnson returns home by the same route and notices that the graves are now adorned with Swan's blue trinkets; he rushes back to the cabin, where he finds both Swan and Caleb have been killed.\nJohnson sets off after the warriors who killed his family and attacks them, killing all but one, a heavy-set man who sings his death song when he realizes he cannot escape. Johnson leaves him alive and the survivor spreads the tale of the mountain man's quest for revenge throughout the region, trapping Johnson in a feud with the Crow. The tribe sends its best warriors one at a time to kill Johnson, but he defeats each one. His legend grows and the Crow come to respect him. He meets Gue again and returns to the cabin of Caleb's mother, only to find that she has died and a new settler named Qualen and his family are living there. Nearby the Crow have built a monument to Johnson's bravery, periodically leaving trinkets and talismans as tribute.\nJohnson and Lapp meet for a final time. It is at this poignant meeting between student and teacher that Lapp realizes the heavy toll that fighting an entire nation alone in a vast and lonesome frontier has taken on Johnson.

Sayaka laughs confidently and tells the Kurokawas' leader to send their best man into the room. She then orders that he to try to exit. He tries by grappling onto the ceiling, but the female assassins set upon him and make short work of his efforts, hacking off his ears, fingers, arms, and legs, leaving the swordsman a writhing heap of just a torso and head before he is finally finished off.\nItt\u014d, meanwhile, is hired by a clan that specializes in making indigo dye and has a secret process. One of the clan plans to sell the secret to the Sh\u014dgun. Itt\u014d must kill him.

The first is disguised as an acrobat troupe that turns deadly as their gymnastic moves are combined with blades and turned against Itt\u014d. Next, he encounters a pair of women who, with blades on their straw hats, throw the blades at Itt\u014d. Finally, some women washing vegetables by the river turn out to also be assassins and the daikons they are washing are now wielded as weapons. Itt\u014d quickly dispatches them all.\nHe encounters Sayaka, who captures him, his son, and the baby cart in a thick net. Itt\u014d cuts his way out and engages in a sword duel with her. He delivers what should be a disabling blow to her ankles, but the woman jumps straight up out of her kimono to reveal a tight-fitting body suit. She runs away, bizarrely jogging backwards while keeping him constantly in her line of sight.\nThe Kurokawa clan are waiting for Itt\u014d. He sees them and puts together his naginata (disguised as railing on the baby cart) and gives the baby cart a shove toward the waiting clan. Daigoro, still in the cart, activates blades hidden inside the cart's rolling axles, which slice off the feet of several of the clan. A fierce battle ensues, and Itt\u014d is injured before he has silenced them all.\nWeary from the endless fighting, Itt\u014d struggles along the road and eventually finds shelter in a shack. Daigoro, seeing that his father needs his help, must do what he can. Unable to carry river water in his tiny hands, Daigoro transports it in his mouth. He spits what he is able to carry between his father's lips. For food, Daigoro finds some rice cakes given as an offering to a Buddha statue and takes them to his father, leaving his vest in exchange.\nItt\u014d recovers and finds that his son is missing. Daigoro has been taken by the Kurokawa and Sayaka, and is now tied up and suspended over a deep water well. If Itt\u014d attacks, they will let go of the rope and Daigoro will plunge to his death. Daigoro lets his sandal drop into the well, giving his father a gauge of how far it is to the bottom. Itt\u014d makes his move as the rope unspools, stopping it just in time. He slowly pulls up his son. Sayaka watches silently and makes no move to engage his considerable swordsmanship, perhaps to honor the devotion of a father to his child.\nItt\u014d later finds himself aboard the same ship carrying the three Hidari brothers. Itt\u014d watches silently as members of the indigo-dye clan try to kill the Hidaris, but are bloodily eliminated one-by-one. Another clan member sets the ship ablaze in an attempt to kill the Hidaris, but the three easily escape the fire, jumping into the sea. Itt\u014d tosses Daigoro and the baby cart into the water, the cart easily floating as he pushes it while swimming toward shore.\nSayaka has followed Itt\u014d and his son onto the ship and is in the water with them as the ship burns. She tries to kill Itt\u014d, but she is quickly disarmed. All three find shelter, but they are now cold. Itt\u014d removes his and Daigoro's wet garments and turns on Sayaka, tearing off her clothes. He does not intend to rape her. Instead, he is seeking to get her out of her own cold, wet clothing, while clinging to her and Daigoro. \"Three people are warmer than two\", he unemotionally explains. She considers taking his sword and killing him, but the cozy, now warming scene, with Daigoro sitting between them and playfully fondling her breast, makes her abandon the plan.\nOn a vast area of sand dunes, the Hidari brothers are at the head of a caravan of men carrying a palanquin with the turncoat indigo expert riding inside. The brother with the iron claw runs forward and thrusts his claw into the sand, which boils up with blood. There are men hiding in dunes, as he digs his claw into the sand several more times, each time creating a pool of blood and pulling up a hiding swordsman by his head. The rest of the hidden men emerge from the sand to fight, but the three brothers easily dispatch them all.\nItt\u014d now awaits, alone, atop a large dune. Each brother is killed by him in a high-pressure spray of blood, with the last brother eliminated with a lethal strike along his throat, a cut that sprays arterial blood in a fine mist while making a sound like the \"howling of the wind\". The final Hidari brother says that such a fabled finishing stroke is called the \"Mogaribue\", wishing that the sound had come from one of his own victims. Instead, it is now coming from his own neck as his life slowly drains away.\nItt\u014d approaches the palanquin holding the indigo expert and quickly finishes him before gathering up Daigoro and setting off again. They are now out of the desert and on a coastal trail, followed closely by Sayaka. Aware of her presence, Itt\u014d stops the cart, looking straight ahead while holding out his outstretched dotanuki blade. Sayaka is holding a katana.

Unwittingly, he is surrounded by the flames, but Daigoro proves resourceful by burying himself in the mud in order to survive.\nThe man has been following behind and turns his sword on Daigoro, who raises a stick to defend himself, In that instant the man realizes Daigoro is not just any child, but the son of Ogami Itt\u014d.\nItt\u014d arrives pushing the baby cart, and the two ronin recognize each other. The man, it turns out is Gunbei Yagy\u016b, the outcast son of Retsudo Yagy\u016b. Gunbei and Itto had competed for the post of Shogun's executioner, and Gunbei's fierce swordsmanship surely would have won him the post, but in his over zealousness, he ends up pointing his sword at the Shogun, a taboo sword movement that costs him the job and makes him an outcast.\nItt\u014d and Gunbei now have their rematch, but Itt\u014d is much improved and is more than ready for Gunbei. With a swift stroke, he chops off Gunbei's right arm. Gunbei then begs Itt\u014d to kill him, but he refuses, saying there is nothing to be gained from slaying a man who is already dead.\nWith Gunbei out of the way and father and son reunited, Itt\u014d turns to finding the tattooed killer, Oyuki. He first stops at a settlement of street actors and other performers, of which Oyuki was said to be a member. He talks to the elder and hears more of her story, and it happens that the elder is Oyuki's father, who is opposed to her actions, and cooperates with Itt\u014d.\nItt\u014d finally locates Oyuki at an isolated hot spring and witnesses her in action against more vassals who have come to try to kill her. Then her nemesis, her former instructor who raped her and set her on her bloody vendetta, shows up with his flaming sword and blazing hypnotic eyes. But Oyuki is no longer held in his sway, and when she reveals her shocking tattoos to him, he is distracted and quickly killed by her.\nFinally, Itt\u014d and Oyuki must duel, and he makes quick work of her. She dies an honorable death, as Itt\u014d says, \"without having to disrobe\".\nRetsudo Yagy\u016b, meanwhile, has been playing politics. He manipulates a local daimy\u014d into bringing in Itt\u014d, but he is able to use the baby cart's various hidden weapons to escape from the compound and take the daimy\u014d hostage. As Itt\u014d is leaving the area with the daimyo, he is attacked by the Yagy\u016b. The daimy\u014d is killed by Yagy\u016b musketeers and Itt\u014d plunges headlong into battle with their many swordsmen, telling his son Daigoro that he is entering the \"crossroads to hell\". It is a fierce battle, ending with only Itt\u014d and Retsudo in final combat. They trade sword blows and Retsudo gets a blade thrust into his right eye and Itt\u014d a sword in his back. Itt\u014d easily dispatches the swordsman who stabs him, but Retsudo gets away.\nDaigoro finds Itt\u014d, who commands him to pull the sword from his back. Despite being severely wounded, Itt\u014d carries Daigoro to the cart and slowly pushes it away. Watching over the scene from a distance is the now one-armed Gunbei, who is happy to see the master swordsman live to fight another day.

A young woman at the front of the boat, clearly distraught, accidentally drops a bundle into the water, which Daigoro retrieves for her. Itt\u014d, draws his sword partway and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are trailing the boat, meaning that Itt\u014d is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy, the Yagy\u016b Clan. Later, as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade, Itt\u014d slices at several tall bamboo stalks, causing hidden ninja assassins to fall from their elevated perches and to be bloodily killed by him.\nA group of four watari-kashi (wandering lower-class hired fighters, working from one daimy\u014d to the next), are idling along the road at a rest stop. Hot and bored, they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run to take advantage of the women, but one of their band, Kanbei, a r\u014dnin (a samurai who has lost his retainership) and the more honorable of the four, remains. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole, but is slain by Kanbei, who also slays the two women in order to silence them. Kanbei makes his three companions draw straws, saying the one who draws the short straw will be killed in order to take the blame for the rapes and murders.\nItt\u014d happens upon this grim scene as Kanbei is slaying the losing watari-kashi. Itt\u014d kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him because he can speak to their crimes. Kanbei recognizes Itt\u014d and requests a duel now that Itt\u014d is involved. Itt\u014d accepts, and they prepare to fight, but at the last second Itt\u014d re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw. Kanbei is left to ponder why fate will not let him die honorably as he would like.\nAt an inn, it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution.  Her pimp tries to have his way with her, but she accidentally bites the tip of his tongue off while resisting and the pimp dies from shock. The girl seeks refuge in Itt\u014d's room, who steps in to protect her from the local officials. But the town's real authorities show up, the yakuza, led by a pistol-wielding woman named Torizo, from the Koshio clan. Itt\u014d agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo buri-buri (literally \"angrily\"), a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water, then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes. Itt\u014d endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from becoming a prostitute.\nTorizo asks and Itt\u014d agrees to meet a one-armed man who turns out to be Miura Tatewaki, former first retainer of the Kakegawa clan, whom Itt\u014d recognizes from the time he had to execute the insane daimy\u014d Kakegawa Ujishige. Miura was forced to restrain the struggling daimyou to make him stay still, sacrificing his arm in the process to Itt\u014d's precise killing stroke. Torizo is, in fact, Miura's own daughter, Miura Tori, who because of the taboo of her being a twin was secretly raised by the Koshio clan. The Miuras want Itt\u014d to kill Sawatari Genba, who sold out the Kakegawa clan to become governor of the district of Totomi. He is also the man responsible for her sister's death and the fall of the Kakegawa clan and its 400 retainers.\nSawatari wants to hire Itt\u014d to kill visiting minister Itakura, but he refuses. While giving the slip to Sawatari's retainers, Itt\u014d is attacked by Yagyu ninjas, who have had been following him. The next day, Itt\u014d has to face the governor's personal bodyguards, one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of American revolvers. With the help of his young son Daigoro, who acts as a decoy, Itt\u014d kills the sharpshooter, taking his pistols. The other bodyguard is dispatched in a sword duel.\nItt\u014d's battle culminates in his facing the governor's army, perhaps 200 men, singlehandedly.  For the first time, the baby cart is revealed as holding an entire arsenal of weaponry, including spears, daggers, a bullet-proof shield, and a small battery of guns. All of the governor's men are killed, as Itt\u014d first kills half of them with the baby cart's firepower and the rest with his sword and other weapons. The governor is the last to die when Itt\u014d, losing his sword as he falls down an embankment, takes out the sharpshooter's pistols and shoots him.\nWord of the coming fight has been passed to neighboring districts, and the r\u014dnin Kanbei appears just after Itt\u014d has slain the governor, and again demands a duel. Though battle-weary, this time Itt\u014d accepts. The fight is over in an instant: Itt\u014d is sliced across his back, but Kanbei is mortally wounded, impaled on Itt\u014d's D\u014dtanuki katana.\nAs Kanbei dies, he tells Itt\u014d the story of why he became a r\u014dnin: When his master's convoy was ambushed, Kanbei, seeing his forces outnumbered, seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on, surprising them, and saving the lord's life. However, because he had left his lord's side, he was dishonored and expelled from the clan. When Kanbei asks what is the true \"Way of the Warrior\", and if he had done wrong by attacking, Itt\u014d replies that Bushido is not to simply live or die but to live through death. He confirms that he would have acted just as Kanbei had. The dying Kanbei asks the former Kogi Kaishakunin to act as his \"second\" during his seppuku, which Itt\u014d is honored to do.\nAs Itt\u014d leaves, pushing the cart holding Daigoro, Torizo, who had been watching everything from a distance, begins to run after him.

A sashimono banner hangs off his back: \"Ogami: Suiouryo technique. Sword For Hire. Son For Hire.\" His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and tries to breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after a stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Itt\u014d money, but the stoic r\u014dnin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway.\nAs he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day two years earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three former samurai, ostensibly in revenge for Itt\u014d's execution of their young daimy\u014d, but Itt\u014d soon deduces that it is really a complex plot by the \"Shadow\" Yagy\u016b clan, which controls the sh\u014dgun's spies and assassins, to frame Itt\u014d for treason and take over the executioner's post. He winds up cutting down a senior member of the Yagy\u016b and his men when they show up to finish him as well.\nNow a wandering assassin-for-hire, Itt\u014d takes a job from the chamberlain of a rural clan to kill the members of a conspiracy to assassinate the chamberlain's lord and replace him with their own preferred successor. The chamberlain plans to test Itt\u014d, but a quick slash behind his back with his D\u014dtanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools.\nAs Itt\u014d pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a dog suckling her puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Itt\u014d thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Itt\u014d would put him to death so he could join his mother \u2013 which he secretly hopes for. Instead, the curious child reaches for the sword \u2013 he has chosen to take the path of the r\u014dnin with his father, which Itt\u014d describes as living like demons at the crossroads to hell.\nThe episode takes one more trip back to the past: Refusing to accept death, Itt\u014d forces the leader of the \"Shadow\" Yagy\u016b, Retsudo, to allow him to duel the clan's best swordsman with a promise that he and Daigoro will be permitted to become ronin if he wins. Itt\u014d beheads the swordsman by strapping a mirror to Daigoro's forehead, allowing him to blind his opponent with sunlight.\nEventually, Itt\u014d reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the conspirators have hired a band of ronin who have taken over the town and are raping, looting, and pillaging. As his targets have not yet arrived, Itt\u014d is forced to give up his sword and join several other travelers who have been taken hostage. The ronin leaders discuss killing Itt\u014d and try to provoke him, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with a fellow hostage, a prostitute, while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but when her life is threatened, Itt\u014d steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman.\nWhen Itt\u014d finally reveals his true identity to the ronin after they meet with the conspirators, he pulls out various edged weapons hidden in the baby cart, including a naginata and a throwing dagger, and quickly slaughters the ronin in a gruesome, ruthless manner.

Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a man named The Once-ler, a man in dark green-colored gloves whose face is never seen. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.\nThe land once thrived with Truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage were the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who ate Truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond lived the Humming Fish, and  the Swomee Swans flew overhead. The trees amazed the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon built a small shop in the area. After cutting down a Truffula tree, the Lorax popped out of its stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demanded to know what the Once-ler was doing. The Once-ler explained that he was using the Truffula tree's tufts to make something called a \"Thneed... a fine something that all people need\". He insisted that he was only cutting one tree down and causing no harm, but when the Thneed sold quickly, the Once-ler began cutting down Truffula trees en masse to make more Thneeds. It is also noted that the Truffula tree grows extremely slowly\u2014ten years before the seed even becomes a sapling and at least ten years after that to grow to maturity\u2014making farming the tree impractical. Soon, he called his relatives to help him grow his thriving business into a boomtown. As the Lorax protested against the Once-ler's actions, a bulldozer picked up the Truffula tree where he stood and the Lorax was thrown into a truck with the Truffula tree and caught in an assembly line.\nSome time later, at a major celebration, everybody reminisced about how Thneeds, Inc. started and how famous the Once-ler had become and how it had diversified, showing \"Once-ler Cones\", \"Once-ler Burgers\", a \"Once-lermobile\" and a blimp advertising Thneeds, then a stone with the word \"Thneed\" carved in it. Shortly after Thneeds, Inc. had produced its millionth product, the Lorax got out of the box and, despite his protests, fell back into the box to be shipped off with more finished Thneeds. All the while, the air was becoming increasingly polluted and darker as the industrialization progressed, the countless accumulated garbage was being dumped in rivers, and the few remaining Truffula trees were wilting.\nThe Lorax continued to fight the Once-Ler. By this point the Lorax had to send the starving Brown Bar-ba-loots out of the area in search of food. After this, the Once-ler had his first bout with a guilty conscience; he justified his doubts by remarking \"But if I didn't do them, then someone else would\". The Lorax then protested that the smog was suffocating the Swomee Swans, preventing them from singing, and thus the Lorax also had to send them away. The Once-ler protested that closing the factory would put countless employees out of work; the Lorax conceded that he had no answer to that. Finally, the pond that was home to the Humming Fish was filled with viscous toxic waste clogging the fish's gills and rivaling Lake Erie; they too were sent away over dry land. Confronted by the Lorax, the Once-ler appeared to be ready to act, until his secretary announced that the company's stock had shot upward. The elated Once-ler flipped from empathy to defiance, vowing to ramp up production even further\u2014until at that moment, with the sound of an ax, the last remaining tree was cut down. With no raw materials, the factory was forced to close anyway, and the Once-ler's relatives all sadly departed. The Lorax glared at the Once-ler before he lifted himself by the seat of his pants, and disappeared through a tiny hole in the smog. On the spot where the Lorax last stood sits a small pile of rocks, with a word carved into one of them: \"Unless\".\nThe tale then switches back to the Once-ler talking to the boy. The Once-ler finally figures out that the word \"Unless\" was actually meant for whoever listened to the story and \"cares a whole awful lot\" to undo the damage the Once-ler caused. The Once-ler gives the boy the last Truffula seed and encourages him to help revitalize the long-dead trees by growing a brand new forest, with the possibility that the Lorax and all of his friends may then come back.

Although Stan is eager to get married and to find Susy a flat for them to live in, he is forced to put things on hold when he becomes the main money earner for the Butler household, after Arthur (Michael Robbins) loses his job. While trying to find his brother-in-law employment, Jack reveals news, overheard from Blakey (Stephen Lewis), the company's Bus Inspector, that a new manager by the name of Mr. Jenkins (Kevin Brennan) has been installed into the depot, who seeks to make the buses profitable and has intentions to make reforms at the depot to ensure its staff work harder, much to the dislike of Stan and Jack who enjoy their current layabout lifestyle.\nWhen Jenkins decides to stop the staff wearing casual, scruffy clothing under their uniform, Stan and Jack instigate a mutiny by having the male and female bus crews wear only the company's uniform that they are provided with, and nothing else.

A few days later, Stan discovers that Jenkins is hiring new drivers and realises that this will provide the needed work for Arthur that can allow him to proceed with marrying Susy. In order to ensure this, Stan decides to teach Arthur how to drive a bus. However, his plans to get him properly trained soon become threatened when Jenkins has a new radio control system installed in all the buses, allowing Blakey to ensure that the buses are running on time while keeping the pair working hard.

However, any hope of Stan getting the job are dashed when Blakey informs him that, because both he and the depot manager agree that he is accountable for the mayhem with the fire drill, he will never be allowed to get the job. Later that evening, attending the company's dart competition in the busmen's canteen while debating on how to secure the safari job, trouble arises when he, Jack and Mum are forced to take Olive home, after she starts a fight with Arthur's clippie, Norah (Pat Ashton), for trying to flirt with her husband and getting more attention than herself.

With the family initially sheltering in a shanty, Karl Oskar puts all of his energy and resources into building a more permanent house. He begins clearing the land of the pine trees, and, with the help of Robert, Arvid, and some of their Swedish neighbors, completes a small farmhouse before winter comes. At the housewarming party, the assembled Swedish settlers, which include Danjel, Kristina's uncle, and Ulrika, a woman who has become a very close friend to Kristina, discuss whether they regret emigrating. Kristina, feeling homesick, bursts into tears.\nKristina, aided by Ulrika, gives birth to a son, who she names Danjel after her uncle. Ulrika later marries Pastor Jackson, a friendly Baptist minister who lives in a nearby town. Pious Lutheran neighbors attempt to persuade Kristina and Karl Oskar to shun her due to this, but they refuse.\nRobert takes Arvid to seek their fortune in the California Gold Rush. After being gone for several years, he returns, alone, to Karl Oskar's farm and gives Karl Oskar and Kristina a big stack of banknotes. He has always felt that Karl Oskar looks down on him, so he says the money is only a small part of what he got for the gold he found, but, via a series of flashbacks, we learn that his adventure was plagued by a series of misfortunes. After slowly working their way west, Robert and Arvid got lost in the desert when looking for a stray donkey, and Arvid died after drinking poisoned water. Robert was rescued by their Hispanic guide, who brought him to a village in the Sierra Nevada. The guide caught yellow fever, and Robert nursed him, despite being warned of the risk. Before succumbing to his illness, the guide gave Robert a sack of coins. After spending some time on his own in a small town, Robert exchanged the coins for lighter banknotes before heading back to Minnesota. Karl Oskar discovers that Robert has been cheated, as the banknotes are worthless. Robert is distraught and, having refused to seek medical help for a persistent cough, dies a short time later.\n\nIn the following years, Karl Oskar becomes an American citizen and tries to volunteer to serve in the Civil War, but he is rejected because he walks with a limp. Kristina, who still misses Sweden, is glad that her husband will not be a soldier and become a murderer. She gives birth to two more children, Ulrika and Frank, after which a doctor advises her that, after so many pregnancies, her insides are torn up and another pregnancy will kill her. Ultimately deciding to disregard the warning and leave her fate in the hands of God, Kristina becomes pregnant again. She suffers several miscarriages, and then falls ill just as the Dakota War of 1862, during which the starving Dakota people rose up and killed hundreds of settlers across Minnesota, erupts. Among the murdered settlers are Uncle Danjel, his eldest son, and his pregnant daughter-in-law. Karl Oskar stays by Kristina's bed as she dies, the uprising is put down, and 38 of the Dakota warriors are subject to a mass execution in Mankato.\nOverwhelmed by grief after Kristina's death, Karl Oskar withdraws into solitude as his children grow up and start families of their own. He often visits Kristina's grave overlooking the lake, tending to the plot while, in the distance, hammering sounds can be heard as the other Swedes who have also begun moving into the area in large numbers establish their farms. On Kristina's grave marker, beneath her name, it reads: \"We Shall Meet Again\".\nKarl Oskar dies peacefully in his sleep on 7 December 1890.

When Skorzeny attempts to rob a hospital, the police are called to stop him. Skorzeny is shot multiple times without effect, and manages to escape by outrunning a police car and motorcycle.\nKolchak's girlfriend, Gail Foster, a casino 'change girl', urges him to explore vampire lore. The evidence persuades Kolchak to suspect that Skorzeny is a vampire, much to the disbelief of his boss Anthony \"Tony\" Vincenzo. Following yet another failed attempt to capture Skorzeny despite overwhelming police force, the authorities strike a deal with Kolchak to eschew their traditional investigative methods for his vampire-centric approach in exchange for giving him exclusive rights to the story. Acting on a tip, Kolchak locates Skorzeny's safe house and pursues the story on his own, fearful that the police will renege on their deal. Compromised when the vampire returns, Kolchak struggles to escape and is nearly killed by Skorzeny before his friend FBI Agent Bernie Jenks, alerted to Kolchak's presence in the house, arrives and joins the fight.

Later that afternoon, Professor Lufkin shows Higgins around the science laboratory where Dexter is working on an experiment with invisibility and another student, Druffle, explores the flight of bumblebees. That night, during a powerful thunderstorm, the laboratory is struck by lightning, resulting in the destruction of Dexter\u2019s work. The next day, as Dexter examines his burnt equipment with dismay, Higgins meets with A.J. Arno, a recently released prisoner, who had also purchased Medfield's mortgage. When Dexter accidentally drops one half of his glasses into a container of his experimental formula, it appears as if the substance destroys them, but upon closer examination, Dexter realizes the frames are merely partially invisible. After several tests, Dexter places his fingers in the liquid and they disappear. Schuyler and Debbie arrive and are horrified to see Dexter with a partial hand, but Dexter insists Schuyler test the substance as well - admitting only afterward that he does not yet have an antidote and it adheres firmly to all surfaces tested - but just as quickly learn that it is water-soluble and rinses away cleanly.\nJust then, Higgins brings Arno to visit the laboratory, stunning the students, as only two years earlier, Dexter was instrumental in exposing Arno's crooked gambling scheme. Dexter and the others notice that Arno is more concerned with the campus architecture than Higgins' speech. Curious about Arno's behavior, Dexter convinces Schuyler to use the invisibility formula to sneak into Arno's office that night. Despite several mishaps, the boys get inside Arno's office where Dexter finds a letter detailing that gambling is legal on the Medfield College lands due to a 1912 statute - and Schuyler finds a model of the college renovated into a gambling town.\nThe next day Dexter shows the photos and papers to Lufkin and Higgins. Convinced that Druffle's bumblebee study would draw attention and investments to Medfield, Higgins reacts angrily when Dexter assures him that his invisibility formula could win the top prize money in the upcoming Forsythe science contest. Not having admitted to anyone that Medfield has been dropped from the contest for being too insignificant, Higgins  contacts the contest's sponsor, millionaire Timothy Forsythe, and agrees to meet over a game of golf, despite his inability to play. Upon learning of Higgins' plan and suspecting it must be connected with raising money for the college, Dexter urges Schuyler to volunteer to serve as Higgins' caddy while, hidden by the invisibility formula, he will take control of Higgins' golf ball. At the golf club, Forsythe and the state university dean, Collingsgood, are amazed by Higgins' quirky golfing abilities, which include numerous hole-in-one-shots, as is Arno who is also at the club.\nAfter the game, Forsythe agrees to reinstate Medfield into the competition. Meanwhile, Arno accidentally sees Dexter becoming visible in the club showers and grows suspicious. When the local television news covers Higgins' extraordinary golf game, he is invited to join an exclusive tournament in nearby Ocean City. Convinced that he will win enough money to pay the college's mortgage, Higgins brashly accepts and that afternoon departs with Schuyler. Learning of the tournament too late, Dexter misses the plane and is forced to watch the competition on television where Higgins' game against two professionals is a disaster. Arno and his henchmen also watch the tournament and ponder Higgins' odd inconsistency. Upon returning to the college, Higgins tells Lufkin that Druffle's bumblebee experiment is the school's last chance. Both men are stunned when Druffle appears swathed in bandages after being attacked by the bumblebees, to which he is allergic. Hoping to assuage the crestfallen Higgins, Lufkin suggests that they give Dexter's unproven formula a chance and the dean reluctantly agrees.\nThat evening, Arno\u2019s henchman Cookie, disguised as a janitor, sneaks into the campus laboratory where he witnesses Dexter and Schuyler using the invisibility spray and reports to Arno, who orders him to return and steal it. The following day, Forsythe and members of his committee arrive on campus to judge the best science experiment at the college. Unaware that their spray bottle has been replaced by Cookie, Dexter and Schuyler make their presentation and are stunned when it has no effect. Forsythe and Higgins depart as Dexter remains confused until he chats with Charlie the janitor. Learning that there is no night janitor, Dexter realizes that Cookie likely stole the formula. Concluding that Arno must be behind the theft, Dexter plants a walkie-talkie in his office.\nA couple of days later, Schuyler overhears Arno plotting with Cookie to rob the Medfield Bank by making themselves and the money invisible. Certain that if he could retrieve the formula before the Forsythe Award announcement that night he could still win the contest, Dexter sends Schuyler to the police and goes to inform the bank's president, Wilfred Sampson. When both the police and Sampson dismiss the boys' story about invisibility, Dexter and his friends gather outside of the bank. When an invisible Arno and Cookie knock out the guards and take the money, Dexter unsuccessfully tries to use a fire hydrant to hose the men down as they exit the bank. Sampson contacts the police, who join the college students in a wild chase of the car driven by the invisible robbers.\nAfter a long police chase, Dexter forces Arno's car into a swimming pool where it, the money, and the men become visible. Arno and his henchmen are arrested. Dexter and the others dash to the presentation of the Forsythe Award and plead for one more opportunity to demonstrate their invention. Frustrated by Dexter's determination, Higgins intervenes just as Dexter sprays Schuyler, and, again, there is no result.

When she phones him, she hears a series of disturbing noises and heavy breathing. Concerned, Norah rushes to Joel's apartment building in the East Village. Outside, she witnesses Joel in a rage, being apprehended by police and escorted to the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital.

To his surprise, only one chooses the latter, the quiet and very attractive Vanina, who increasingly absorbs his attention. He talks to her when he can and gives her the book Vanina Vanini by Stendhal. In his free time, he leaves his partner Monica to herself (they sleep apart) while he gets to know a group of local men who enjoy drinking, gambling, recreational drugs, fast cars and easy women.

A woman operating the sausage machine is interrupted by \"Weenie\", who has timed the machine using his watch. He wraps up a string of sausages, then marks the package with an address in Chicago.\nWeenie is the brother of \"Mary Ann\", the crooked operator of the slaughterhouse in Kansas City, Kansas. The particular sausages that Weenie was wrapping were made from the remains of an enforcer from the Chicago Irish Mob sent to Kansas City to collect $500,000 from Mary Ann.\nAfter the head of the Irish Mob in Chicago receives the package, he contacts Nick Devlin, an enforcer with whom he has worked previously, to go to Kansas City to collect the debt. He tells Devlin about the sausages and that another enforcer sent to Kansas City was found floating in the Missouri River.\nDevlin agrees to the fee of $50,000 and asks for some additional muscle. He gets a driver and three other younger members of the Irish Mob as help, including the young O'Brien, who makes Devlin meet his mother as he leaves Chicago.\nIt is later revealed that Devlin and Mary Ann have a shared history involving Mary Ann's wife Clarabelle, who previously had an affair with Devlin. In Kansas City at a flophouse, Devlin finds Weenie in an upstairs room. He beats him up and tells him to inform Mary Ann that he is in town to collect the debt.\nThe next day, Devlin and his men drive to the prairie and find Mary Ann in a barn, where he is entertaining guests at a white slave (prostitute) auction. Devlin demands the money from Mary Ann, who tells him to come to the county fair the next day to get it. Mary Ann tells him Chicago is \"an old sow, begging for cream\" that should be melted down.\nAs they are standing by a cattle pen with naked young women offered for auction, one of them, Poppy, begs Devlin for help. Devlin takes her with him \"on account.\" Back at the hotel, she tells Devlin her history of growing up at an orphanage in Missouri with her close friend, Violet, before they were brought to the slave auction.\nAt the county fair, in the midst of a livestock judging competition, Mary Ann gives Devlin a box that supposedly contains the money. When Devlin cracks the box open, he finds it contains only beef hearts. Devlin is able to escape with Poppy after Violet distracts Weenie, who claimed her after the auction.\nMary Ann's men chase Devlin, his men and Poppy through the fair. O'Brien is killed underneath a viewing stand. Devlin and Poppy run into a nearby wheat field, where they escape detection. When they try to leave the field, they are chased by a combine harvester operator. Poppy falls. They are about to be sliced up by the machine's blades, until...\nDevlin and Poppy are saved by the arrival of Devlin's men in their car, which they abandon and let ram into the front of the combine. Devlin's driver shoots the combine operator. The entire car is demolished by the threshing apparatus and turned into bales of hay and metal.\nThey hitch a ride back into Kansas City on a truck. Devlin jumps off near the river and sends the rest of them with Poppy back into town. He enters a houseboat, the luxurious accommodation of Clarabelle, purchased for her by Mary Ann; she is there alone. He gets information on the whereabouts of Mary Ann while surmising that she was the one pushing Mary Ann to cut out Chicago. Clarabelle attempts to seduce him, but he rebuffs her. Clarabelle tells him she would be perfectly happy being a widow and joining Devlin again. He responds by setting the houseboat adrift on the river, with an angry Clarabelle aboard.\nWhen he returns to the hotel, Devlin finds an ambulance, with one of his men being hauled away. He learns that Mary Ann's men ambushed them and took Poppy.  When he returns to Weenie's hotel to look for him, he finds that Violet has been gang-raped, apparently as a warning of what will happen to Poppy.\nHe and his two remaining men drive out to Mary Ann's farm to finally take care of business. On the way, Devlin takes out a Smith & Wesson M76 submachine gun from a case.\nDevlin stops the car on the edge of a field of sunflowers near Mary Ann's farm. They approach the farm through the field and engage in a long gun battle with Mary Ann's men, a seemingly infinite number of identical men wearing bib overalls. Both of Devlin's men are hit. He tells them to stay behind while he advances with the submachine gun. Unable to get past Mary Ann's men, he stops a truck hauling livestock, commandeers it and uses it to ram the gate and smash into the greenhouse on the farm, demolishing it.\nDevlin kills several of Mary Ann's men, then advances into the barn where Mary Ann and his brother are holding Poppy. From behind an apparently bulletproof bale of hay, he hits Mary Ann, who falls seriously injured down into a pig pen. Enraged at seeing his brother shot, Weenie runs toward Devlin, who kills him. As he dies, Weenie tries to stab Devlin with a sausage.\nDevlin carries Poppy out of the barn. They pass the mortally wounded Mary Ann, flat on his back, next to a sow pen. Mary Ann taunts Devlin to kill him, telling him to finish him off, like he would an animal. Devlin tells him that since Mary Ann is a man, not an animal, he won't do that. He walks away, leaving Mary Ann to die on his back.\nIn the final scene, Devlin and Poppy go back to the Missouri orphanage and demand the release of the rest of the girls.  When the matron resists, Poppy knocks her out, to the approval of Devlin.  As they walk away Devlin tells her they're going back to Chicago, and when Poppy asks what it's like, he replies it's \"as peaceful as anyplace anywhere\".", "tmdb_plot": "A group of ruthless Chicago mob enforcers are sent to Kansas City to settle things with the owner of a slaughterhouse who has taken money that is not his to keep.", "tmdb_id": "27292", "wiki_id": "569790"}, {"title": "The Prince and the Pauper", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Adventure"], "wiki_plot": "The young thief Tom wants to thank the man who paid the ransom for him to the bandits and for this goes to the palace.

The brusque, conservative Martha allows Cheryl to temporarily stay in the King Edward, which she considers one of the \"last respectable hotels in the city\". Martha's central provision for Cheryl's stay is that she not wander the hotel at night. Cheryl soon notices that the guests and residents of the hotel are very unusual.\nSoon after settling into her room, Cheryl senses she is being watched. Judy's boyfriend, Mike, arrives at the hotel searching for Cheryl, and is met by the Reverend Moon, an eccentric guest who dresses as a priest. Mike is attacked in an upstairs hallway by an unseen assailant, who decapitates him before throwing his corpse in the hotel furnace. Later, over dinner, Cheryl inquires about Martha's daughter; Martha states that the child was conceived via artificial insemination, and implies that she is dead.\nCheryl soon takes notice of George, a mysterious, handsome photographer who lives in the hotel, and whom Martha allows to keep a darkroom in the basement. While exploring the hotel, Cheryl realizes there are peepholes throughout, some of which allow a direct view into her room. George begins to leave sexually aggressive notes for Cheryl, which progress to gifts of lingerie which he suggest she model for him. Curious, Cheryl steals the hotel master keys and has copies made, which she uses to enter George's room. Inside, she discovers a transparent inflatable sex doll on his bed, and numerous avant-garde photos of nude women lining the walls. Judy arrives at the hotel searching for Mike and wanting to reclaim her stolen money. Martha directs her to the basement darkroom, where an unseen assailant murders her. That night, Jeff, a young man who works at the locksmith where Cheryl copied the keys, invites her on a date to a rock concert. Meanwhile, George fills his inflatable sex doll with water and affixes a blown-up headshot of Cheryl onto its face. He then draws his own blood into a hypodermic needle, before injecting the blood into the doll.\nGeorge and Martha later get into an argument in which George accuses her of ruining his life by attempting to \"protect\" him from slatternly women. That night, Cheryl dresses in the lingerie George left for her, and erotically undresses in the bathroom, aware George is watching her from a peephole. After she leaves her room, George enters it and takes back the lingerie, which he uses to dress his inflatable doll. Martha finds the discarded doll in the trash the next morning, and orders Cheryl to return home. Jeff arrives later for his date with Cheryl. As they head to the concert, Jeff mentions he previously dated a woman named Alice, a model who disappeared from the hotel, and mentions that she was frightened of George. Cheryl, who feels protective of George, is angered by this and aborts the date, returning to the hotel.\nJeff follows Cheryl to the hotel, and confronts George, who is in his room listening to a taped audio recording of Alice's murder. George bludgeons Jeff with a bottle and drags his body to the darkroom. When he returns to his room, he finds Cheryl posed on his bed in the lingerie. Cheryl assumes the two are going to have sex, but is horrified when George produces a hypodermic needle, which he attempts to stab her with. An altercation ensues in which Cheryl inadvertently kills him by pushing over a large stage light that falls on his head. Martha, alerted by the noise, enters the room. When she unbuttons George's shirt to feel for a heartbeat, she reveals that George has breasts, and is not a man at all, but a woman who has been cross-dressing and presenting as a male. Martha raves that George's spirit has been liberated from his body, and that she raised George\u2014who is her biological child\u2014as a man so that he would not be \"tainted\" by wanton female sexuality.

Their older sister, Franziska, covers up the death, and everyone, including Tobias, is told that Evelyn immigrated to the United States. This doesn't sit well with Kitty, who is willing to allow Franziska to cover up the murder but feels overwhelming guilt. When their grandfather dies from a fear-induced heart attack, a series of murders begin to occur around Kitty, all of which appear to have been caused by a red-cloaked Evelyn. The police begin to suspect that Kitty and her married lover Martin are the perpetrators of the murders, especially after Martin's institutionalized wife is found dead. It's eventually revealed that Kitty had only stunned Evelyn, who was also not her biological sister - Tobias had adopted her as an additional way of ending the hundred year-cycle. Evelyn's true murderer was Franziska, who murdered her at the start of an impulsive plan to be the only person to inherit Tobias' vast fortune.

When Bryant refuses to answer, the younger man strikes him, causing Bryant to fall and strike his head on a rock.\nThe US lawyer William \"Bill\" Mathison (Barry Newman) is on holiday in Europe and visits Bryant's photo shop in Salzburg to ask about a book of photographs of Austrian mountain lakes. He is acting on behalf of publisher James Newhart (Whit Bissell). Bryant's Austrian wife Anna (Anna Karina) hands Bill correspondence from a certain Eric Yates, Newhart's representative in Zurich, including a countersigned cheque for the illustrated book.\nDuring the visit, Anna's brother Johann Kronsteiner (Klaus Maria Brandauer) receives a call from Felix Zauner (Wolfgang Preiss), a family friend, who tells him that Bryant has been the victim of a fatal accident. Johann goes to identify the body at an inn close to the Finstersee. The landlord of the inn, Grell (Helmut Schmid), is the elder of the men who had earlier confronted Bryant.\nNot far from the photo shop, Mathison notices that he is being followed by two men. To lose them, he takes a hackney carriage and is driven through the city. Having shaken off the first tail, a heavy set man with a moustache (Raoul Retzer) also starts to follow him. Bill takes part in a tour of Hohensalzburg Fortress, verifies that he is being followed, and then loses the man.\nWhile admiring the view from the fortress, Bill meets a young American Elissa Lang (Karen Jensen). They strike up a conversation and Mathison invites Elissa for a drink at his Salzburg hotel. It then turns out that she works for Zauner, who is part of the Austrian secret service. Elissa also passes information to KGB agent Lev Benedescu (Mischa Hausserman) and it becomes clear that she is also working for the Russians as a double agent.\nWhile Johann drives to the Finstersee, Bill receives a visit from Anna, who tells him of her husband's death. Anna is firmly convinced that her husband has been murdered. She therefore asks Bill whether Yates is involved in this affair, but he explains that Yates has also mysteriously died.\nAnna reveals that both her murdered husband and Yates had once worked for the British secret service. But she, Anna, had never trusted Yates. She confides in Bill her belief that her husband may have once again got involved in espionage. Later, while Bill is taking Anna home, Elissa breaks into Bryant's now-closed photo shop and steals the photos taken at Finstersee, as well as his correspondence with Yates. \nBill and Anna arrive at the shop and discover that someone is inside. Elissa flees unrecognised, but is pursued by Bill. In a side alley, Elissa is confronted by a stranger, but she is able to overpower and kill him. Bill and Anna find the dead man, who Anna recognises Bernard Dietrich, Zauner's deputy.\nAt Finstersee, where Johann is looking for the missing chest, he is followed by two neo-Nazis, one of whom is Anton (Udo Kier) \u2013 Richard Bryant's killer. Johann discovers the chest at the edge of the forest and is able to escape from the two men. Then he disappears and hides the box at the home of his girlfriend Trudi Seidl (Elisabeth Felchner).\nBill takes the distraught Anna to his hotel and rents a room for her there, because she would probably no longer be safe at home in the shop. At the hotel, her brother Johann visits her the following morning. He tells her that he has found and secured the box and reports that an Israeli had come to see him and offered to buy Bryant's chest. Obviously, its contents must be valuable.\nAnna reminds her brother that Bryant and Dietrich had to die because of this chest and that it would be better to give it to the neo-Nazi Grell, or to destroy it. That same day, Bill meets up with CIA agent Chuck (Joe Maross), who has contacted him through Newhart. On the way to their meeting, Mathison is again followed the moustachioed man, who Chuck arranges to be shot on a chair lift by an assassin (Bert Fortell). According to Chuck, the dead man had been a Polish spy working for the Chinese. Chuck explains to Bill that the CIA had been working with Yates, who had been another double agent. \nIt gradually emerges that the mysterious box contains documents listing former Nazis who are still active, and who have infiltrated the West or are being used by Western intelligence services. The Russians have recently discovered a similar chest in Czechoslovakia, and have the lists already.\nBill cannot understand why the CIA is so desperate to acquire the documents, and Chuck explains that several Germans named in these lists are working in important scientific positions for the USA. They are now vulnerable to blackmail by the Soviets, and it is vital that the CIA knows their identities.\nIn the afternoon of the same day, Johann returns home, where the two neo-Nazis he encountered at the lake are waiting for him. They overpower and kidnap him. At the photo shop, Anna receives a phone call from Trudi, who tells her that Johann has not kept a date with her.\nBill drives Anna to her husband's funeral and waits at the entrance to the cemetery. Two men grab Anna and drag her into a car, which quickly leaves the scene. Bill notices and follows the car towards the city. He is able to get in front of the kidnapper's vehicle, slowing it down and causing enough traffic chaos to ensure that the Austrian police become involved. Anna is rescued and the men are arrested. \nMeanwhile, the neo-Nazis begin to torture Johann. They want to know where he hid the chest. Elissa meets with the Soviet agent Benedescu, who is annoyed that she has so far failed to remove Bill from the scene. Benedescu hands Elissa a bomb with a 10-minute timer. As soon as she verifies that the chest is genuine, she is to use it to destroy the box once and for all. The Russians do not want anyone else to access the lists.\nAnna and Bill, who are worried about Johann, want to meet Trudi in the evening, but see Zauner's vehicle on the road. They find him in his shop and he tells them how to find Trudi. \nThen Elissa suddenly appears on the scene. Bill instinctively senses danger and takes Anna out of the shop. Zauner knows that Elissa is responsible for the death of his colleague Dietrich and makes it clear to her that the Austrian secret service knows about her double agent activity. Elissa assures Zauner that she only wants to destroy the chest, which seems to suit him. \nElissa goes to the inn where she meets a group of neo-Nazis, led by Grell, and makes it clear to them that she is also desperate to get her hands on Johann in order to find out the location of the chest. Grell then makes a brief phone call to Johann's kidnapper Anton.\nElissa pretends to be Anna on the phone and tries to convince Johann, who is already worn down, to hand over the chest, otherwise Trudi's life will be in serious danger. Johann passes on the location of the box, but also manages to reveal where he is being held.\nAt the same time, Chuck shows up in Bill's car and all three go to see Trudi. Trudi hands over the coveted chest. They are about to leave when Elissa and the Neo-Nazis arrive, closely followed by Felix Zauner. Zauner and Mathison interrogate Grell, whose henchmen have mysteriously disappeared, while Elissa attaches her bomb to the chest unnoticed. The explosion comes sooner than expected (as planned by Benedescu) and kills Elissa.\nChuck takes Grell into custody and Zauner tells Bill that he knows where Johann is being held. On the way there, Bill confesses that he and Chuck had swapped the chest for a duplicate. Zauner, in turn, makes it clear why he was so personally interested in getting his hands on the Finstersee find: his name is on one of the lists! He had once served as a Nazi informant to save his wife from deportation to a concentration camp during the Second World War, and the KGB had been blackmailing him. This was why he agreed to help Elissa.\nArriving at the hiding place, Zauner tries to negotiate a deal to take Johann without bloodshed, but Anton shoots him dead. At gunpoint, Bill disarms the neo-Nazis and rescues Johann.

Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. He also has them bury John in the bio-dome. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children.\nHuey is damaged when Lowell accidentally collides with him while driving a buggy recklessly, and Dewey sentimentally refuses to leave Huey's side during the repairs.

But she manages to turn the tables on Dr. Fleming and Victor.\nIn the Philippines, a desperate man takes an identity of a passenger and flies to the US.  During the flight, the man becomes violent and it forces the plane to land in Guam.  Once there, the man, who has now become deformed, is killed by security guards.  After Dr. Alix Pardee examines the body, she becomes interested in his condition and decides to go to the Philippines to investigate.\nDuring the flight, she sits next to a man named Victor, where they exchange pleasantries.  Later, she meets Victor again on a boat that's taking her to Pangan where another man with the same deformities was found.  When Alix mentions Victor to the Captain, he claims there's no other American on board, and when she goes to his room, someone else is residing there.\nIn Pangan, Alix is greeted by Dr. Raul Rojas, who's been studying that man and wants to investigate as well.

During lunch, Alix gives Fleming a drink laced with the serum.  After drinking, Fleming's looks and mannerisms begin to change.

When a French heroin smuggler who has been arrested in New York claims that the drug smuggling was a secret mission on the orders of French Counter-Espionage (actually on Milan's orders), the resulting bad press reflects on Toulouse, who cannot prove that Milan was responsible. In retaliation, Toulouse hatches a plot to deal with his ambitious subordinate: in a room which he knows is filled with hidden microphones, he sends his assistant Perrache to Orly airport at 9:30AM the next morning, making Milan (who has been listening) believe that Perrache has gone to meet a master spy who will expose Milan's treachery. However, Toulouse secretly instructs Perrache to choose someone at random from the crowd of travelers arriving at that time.\nAfter considering several possibilities from the flight arriving at the specified time, Perrache selects Fran\u00e7ois Perrin, an unsuspecting violinist, who is noticeable because, as the result of a practical joke played on him by his fellow orchestra members, he has arrived wearing a black shoe on one foot and a reddish-brown one on the other. Milan takes the bait and immediately begins a series of attempts to discover what Perrin knows\u2014never realizing the fact that Perrin knows nothing at all about espionage (although he is an expert on music). Milan's machinations place Perrin in a series of increasingly peculiar adventures which he either avoids or escapes from by pure luck (which only confirm Milan's increasingly paranoid suspicions), and although Perrin is largely oblivious to the mayhem occurring around him, he cannot help noticing Milan's top agent, the beautiful femme fatale Christine. Adding to the confusion is the fact that Perrin is having an affair with Paulette Lefebvre, the wife of his best friend Maurice (both of whom are musicians in the same orchestra as Perrin), and Maurice, upon accidentally hearing a recording of Perrin and Paulette having torrid sex (made by Milan's agents and listened to inside a floral delivery truck), jumps to the mistaken conclusion that Paulette is having an affair with a florist. All the time, Toulouse and Perrache watch the chaos serenely, although Perrache is troubled by his chief's callousness toward the risk that Perrin might be killed.\nChristine greets Perrin at her apartment's front door in a demure high-necked black-velvet dress, then turns around and shows that the dress is backless, displaying discreet buttock cleavage. A slapstick love scene (watched by Milan and his cohorts on a television monitor) ensues, concluding with Milan's decision (despite Christine's belief that Perrin could not possibly be an agent) to have Perrin eliminated. More mayhem (including Maurice's learning the truth about his wife's affair) and treachery (including Christine's defection from Milan's group to save Perrin, with whom she has fallen in love) follow, climaxing in the deaths of not only agents from both Toulouse's and Milan's groups but also Milan himself, who only learns the truth about Perrin from Perrache just before he dies.

They identify themselves as Baby John's grandparents. There are two other guests as well, both lovely young females named Pamela (Janet Wood) and Edwina (Margaret Avery). Regina asks to use the phone so she can call her mother, but it's out of order. The group sits down to an extravagant meal, during which Evelyn prompts them all to eat more and more.

He is taken to the basement, where the experiment is in fact a two-headed gorilla (Rick Baker) that Dr. Kirshner has created. The experiment is to determine whether two heads can survive on a single body. Dr. Kirshner has done this because he has not much longer to live and wants to transplant his still living head from his lifeless body onto a donor so that he may continue living and continue working as the world's most successful surgeon.\nDr. Kirshner returns to his hospital institute to oversee an operation performed by his close friend and associate doctor, Phillip Desmond (Roger Perry). Dr. Kirshner returns to the basement and his two headed gorilla to remove one of the heads from its body. Kirshner orders his assistants to sedate his creature, but plans go awry when the creature is upset about the needle and knocks Dr. Kirshner out of his wheelchair, hurting him badly. It then proceeds to smash up the lab and escapes. The creature runs away and into a supermarket, chased by the assistants, where he is caught.\nKirshner hires a new doctor, Fred Williams (Don Marshall), to help Desmond but when he discovers that Dr. Williams is African-American he tells Williams that he is no longer needed, to which Williams takes great offense.\nDr. Kirshner successfully removes the second head of the creature, and tells Desmond he is ready for his own transplant to a healthy donor. Desmond is not sure, until Kirshner tells him that the head that is now on the gorilla is in fact the second head he put on. He had successfully removed the original gorilla's head and replaced it with the second transplanted one.\nMeanwhile, on death row, convicts are told that donating their bodies to science will save them from the electric chair. One convict is led to the chair - an African-American himself, named Jack Moss (Roosevelt \"Rosey\" Grier) - and he decides to volunteer for the science experiment because he is innocent of the crime he was supposed to have committed.  The police, including Sergeant Hacker (Roger Gentry), escort Jack to the transplant center for this experiment they have been told about. The doctors are surprised to see a large African-American being brought before them for this experiment, knowing full well that when Kirshner wakes up, he is not going to like what he sees. However, the doctors work around the clock to transplant Dr Kirshner's head onto Jack's body.\nAfter the operation, Kirshner wakes up, and Desmond tells him that the operation was a success.  Desmond tells him that they had no other choice but to transplant his head onto the African-American's body, and that he would not have lived another day if they had not operated when they did.\nAt that moment, Jack awakens and is angry and disturbed that Kirshner's head is on his body and tries to get up from the table, but Kirshner cries out for someone to sedate Jack, which Desmond does.  Desmond tells him that he will keep the 'Jack' side heavily sedated all the time while Kirshner regains the power to move the body. Leaving Kirshner to rest, Desmond meets up with Dr. Williams again and tells him he needs his help. Williams is reluctant at first, but Desmond reassures him that his beliefs are not the same as Dr. Kirshner's and that his help is very much needed.\nMeanwhile, a nurse (Britt Nilsson) comes to administer a sedative to Jack's side of the body. Jack tricks the nurse into thinking he is asleep, and then injects her with the sedative instead and escapes, taking Williams with him/them. Williams drives the car under gunpoint by Jack and Desmond chases after them. Jack asks Williams if he can remove Kirshner's head from his body. Jack takes over driving and accidentally crashes the car, resulting in a flat tire. Kirshner then tries to appeal to Williams by offering him the accolades he has received by performing a successful transplant. Williams refuses the offer, as it would mean that he would have to remove Jack's head.\nJack goes to his wife's house; Lila (Chelsea Brown) is not that pleased to see him because of Kirshner's head on his body. While Jack is sleeping, Kirshner finds out that he can now control the body almost fully. Jack, Kirshner, Williams and Lila sit down for dinner. Lila asks what it will take to take Kirshner's head from Jack's body. Kirshner tells her that without a specially crafted surgical team, it is impossible to do the operation and both of them will die. Williams tells Kirshner that he is dead wrong about that, as the removal procedure is easily done without the aid of the surgical team.\nWilliams drives to a medical warehouse to get what he needs for the operation. Frightened by what Williams has told him, Kirshner manages to take over Jack's body and starts playing around with his face. Jack asks him to stop it and Kirshner knocks out Jack by punching him in the face. Cornered by William, Kirshner calls Desmond for help in removing Jack's head so that he may live. Kirshner manages to get away and drives back to the basement of his house. Before Kirshner can sedate Jack, Williams comes in and stops him. Williams then calls Desmond to get over to Kirshner's house as soon as possible. Desmond arrives with a nurse and an associate, who find Kirshner's detached head lying on the utensil table, hooked up to a heart and lung machine which has his blood constantly pumping through the plastic tubes to keep him alive for a while.

The criminals take advantage of the guards' absence by putting a fake pearl, the same size as the real one, in the shell.  When the guards return with the director and the director sees the fake pearl, he thinks the guards were making it up, but then has second thoughts about the incident as a similar case happened at another museum two weeks before.\nMeanwhile, Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock arrive in Syldavia, a country in the Balkans. They have come to join their friend Professor Calculus who has rented a villa near a lake in order to build his latest invention. At the airport they run into Thompson and Thomson, who are also heading for Calculus on a special mission.\nThe four men and dog fly by hired plane to Calculus' house, but during the flight they get into some engine trouble and the pilot bails out with the only parachute. Tintin attempts to safely land the plane, but it ends up on the edge of a cliff and on fire. They are saved with the help of two local children, Niko and his sister Nushka, and their dog Gustav. But as it turns out, the crash was deliberately set up, as the pilot contacts his superior (\"Mr. Big\"/\"King Shark\") via a walkie-talkie, hidden in his binoculars, to inform him that the plan has failed.\nThe children give their new friends a lift in their wagon, but as they learn of their destination, they warn them that there is a curse on the lake, at the bottom of which is an old submerged town. The party finally arrives at Calculus' villa where he demonstrates his invention: a camera which can project holographic images. His ultimate aim is to create a machine which will make actual copies of physical objects. Later, over dinner, Thompson and Thomson explain that they are Calculus' bodyguards as they suspect that a criminal organization specializing in making art forgeries wants to steal his machine. Eventually, everybody goes to bed. In the middle of the night, Snowy wakes up Tintin at one point after hearing a noise outside, but Tintin shakes it off as bird calls. In fact, the noise is made by Calculus' housekeeper, Madame Flik, who is in league with \"Mr. Big\" as well.\nNext morning, while Tintin explores the local country with Niko and Nushka (unaware that there are cameras spying on his every move), and the Captain and the detectives play a game of golf, Snowy runs into a frogman who has obtained from Madame Black some plans stolen from Calculus' laboratory. The frogman escapes by jumping into the lake, but Snowy manages to bite off a part of one of his flippers. After the Captain and the detectives tell Tintin what has happened, he gives the dogs the bitten-off flipper to sniff. While Gustav leads Haddock to a pile of abandoned tires, Tintin follows Snowy to a buried chain which, when pulled, opens a passage to a hidden cave where the criminals have stashed the stolen art. After getting sealed inside the cave, Tintin finds an underwater tunnel leading out to the lake. On his way through, Tintin gets trapped by a wire net, but Snowy (who remained outside the cave) dives in and chews through the net, saving Tintin from drowning.\nBack at home, Calculus demonstrates his new invention to the children\u2014a machine that can copy any object from a piece of special soap. Unfortunately the effects are as yet short-lived, as the copied objects shortly turn back into their original substance. The criminals attack Calculus and the detectives with laughing gas and take the children away. Tintin and Haddock pursue them but fail to rescue Niko and Nushka. The criminals leave behind a message on a tape player from their leader, \"King Shark\", who tells the heroes (with a voice which is startingly familiar to Tintin) that they will get the children back in return for Calculus' invention. Tintin himself is to do the exchange and is not to call the police.\nTintin, Haddock, Calculus and the detectives search the house for bugs, and Tintin discovers a secret passage that leads to Madame Black's walkie-talkie hidden in the empty well, catching Madam Black in the process. Tintin decides to contact the police and comes up with a ruse to cover his tracks. Tintin and Snowy set off to the local town and just happen to meet their old friend, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who gives him a lift in her car to the town and even helps him in getting to the police. The chief of police listens to his story, but he is limited in what he can do since half the lake is in the jurisdiction of Borduria, a rival nation, and there are thus risks of a diplomatic incident.\nTwo days pass before Tintin finally returns to Calculus' house with the shark-like submarine which Calculus built during the search for Red Rackham's Treasure. The plan is that Tintin will meet the crooks on the beach, and Haddock will follow him in the sub. At the meeting point, criminals pick Tintin up in a submarine, and they head underwater to the flooded city where their base is situated. The mastermind behind this operation is revealed to be none other than Tintin's nemesis Rastapopoulos, now calling himself \"King Shark\"/\"Mr. Big\". Rastapopoulos promises to set Niko and Nushka  free for the device, but, unaware of Tintin's arrival, the children escape from their cell and hijack an underwater tank.\nRastapopoulos takes over control of the tank with his computer, but he then notices Captain Haddock's sub on his monitor and uses the tank to fire torpedoes at Haddock, which provokes a fight between Tintin and the other gangsters as he attempts to stop Rastapopoulos. Haddock's mini-sub is hit, jamming its propulsion, and the tank is returned to the base by remote control. While waiting for the children to return, Rastapopoulos takes Tintin to his office and shows him his art collection, gloating that with Calculus' machine, they can make multiple copies of all the stolen masterpieces and sell them off for huge amounts of money.\nRastapopoulos tries out Calculus' machine by cloning a cigar box, but the imitation proves highly unstable and grows to monstrous size, almost crushing Rastapopoulos and his lieutenant. In a rage, Rastapopoulos locks Tintin and the children in a chamber, but then learns that police boats are patrolling the lake. He therefore decides to evacuate the base and orders his men to take all the art he has in the underwater city to the cave. He then floods the chamber Tintin and the children are in with water. As soon as the water has reached a device high on the wall, the base will self-destruct.\nHaddock manages to regain control of the disabled submarine and makes his way to the surface, encountering Thompson and Thomson and the chief of the Syldavian police in a patrol boat. Down below, with all of his men having evacuated the base, Rastapopoulos and his lieutenant leave the base in the submarine. Tintin and the children manage to get free and escape through an airlock in life jackets, just before the base explodes. They then reach the surface and rejoin their friends and the police. The police have captured all of Rastapopoulos' men, but the mastermind himself has already crossed the border in his submarine. Since they are not Syldavian officials and therefore not bound by international conventions, Tintin and Haddock insist in going after Rastapopoulos in a motor boat.\nIn order to pass the border posts, Rastapopoulos tries to navigate the sub through an underwater tunnel, but forgets to lower the sub's periscope, which hits a low rock and breaks, causing the sub to crash and get flooded. The villains make for the surface, but they are captured by Tintin and Haddock as soon as they attempt to leave the wrecked vessel. In the end, the Thompsons, Calculus, Niko, Nushka, and Gustav welcome Tintin, Snowy and Haddock back from their submarine vessel mission. Finally, Rastapopoulos and his seamen are taken away to Klow Prison by Syldavian Police Officials. Tintin, Snowy and Haddock return to Calculus' villa and are welcomed by a huge party of villagers who want to celebrate the end of the terror imposed by the gang, and Bianca Castafiore, who makes Haddock flee the party.

Their marriage is shaky, so they agree to spend the summer together as a trial period at an isolated beach house on Choke Cherry Bay. They quarrel shortly after arriving and, when Lily threatens to leave, Timothy throws her suitcase into the water. Frustrated with his childish immaturity, Lily gets in the car to drive away, but Timothy jumps onto the moving vehicle, hangs onto the windshield and cajoles her into stopping. Although she is weary of his antics, she is also amused and decides to remain.\nTheir landlord and only neighbor for miles around is Major Evelyn Ritchie (Alan Alda), a Vietnam veteran about 10 years their senior who owns two highly trained Doberman Pinschers and walks with crutches due to one of his legs being amputated. When the Frischers meet Ritchie for the first time, Timothy fires off questions about garbage and other practicalities and repeatedly interrupts Lily. Although Ritchie chuckles at the Frischers' gentle bickering, Lily intuits that he is growing annoyed by Timothy's questioning and apologizes for their enthusiasm. Ritchie seems at first aloof, but surreptitiously watches them through their unshuttered windows. When they start to make love, he raps on the door and offers wine as a welcoming gift. Ritchie compliments the \"feminine touch\" within the beach house and looks troubled when Timothy takes credit for a table decoration. After Ritchie leaves, Lily scolds Timothy for his lack of hospitality and accuses him of needing to brood. Timothy admits he has a bad feeling about their landlord, but Lily disagrees with him. When Timothy tries to drive off in anger, Ritchie's dogs suddenly appear and viciously circle his car, frightening him into honking until Ritchie comes out of his house to call them off. Amused by Timothy's fear, Ritchie says condescendingly that the dogs are unfamiliar with his smell.\nAnother day later, as Lily and Ritchie walk along the beach, she explains that she met Timothy when he jumped out at her wearing a clown nose and made her laugh. Proudly, she explains that Timothy studied mime in Paris, art, photography and drawing. Aware of Ritchie's unspoken disapproval of Timothy, Lily adds that she hopes the beach house will bring out Timothy's good qualities. While talking, she strips down to her bikini in order to get a tan, embarrassing Ritchie. At her questioning, Ritchie admits that Timothy seems younger than his age, but evades answering her direct question of whether he thinks Timothy is immature. Lily points out that, while Ritchie feels certain about himself, Timothy \"does not know who he is yet.\" Meanwhile, as Timothy is taking photographs of himself and the area, he encounters another bay resident, an older veteran named Stanley (Eric Clavering), who simply stares at him in amusement when he tries to start a conversation.\nOne night, Ritchie invites the couple to his house for dinner, where Lily and Timothy get inebriated. Lily asks Timothy to perform mime and his clown act. As Timothy prepares in another room, Lily, sensing Ritchie's disdain of Timothy and wanting his respect, tentatively explains that she is more than she may seem and makes the money in their household. Timothy then bursts into the room, with his face covered in shaving cream to imitate the white makeup of a mime and begins to perform \"the definitive ape.\" This disappoints Lily, who prefers his clown act, but Ritchie comments that Timothy shows more concentration when he does his ape routine than he shows in the rest of his life. He points out that gorillas are usually seen behind bars and, claiming that the experience of prison focuses a person, convinces Timothy to agree to meet him at dawn for a psychological experiment.\nThe next morning, Ritchie wakens the hungover Timothy and, treating him like a subordinate in the military, orders him to carry a pile of rocks to the beach. Timothy treats it as a joke, but Ritchie insists that he carry out the task. Leaving one of the dogs to guard Timothy, Ritchie proceeds to the beach house, where he wakens Lily, and stands at the door to her bedroom until she gets up and dresses. Then, after asking if he can \"borrow\" items, he walks through the rooms and gathers knives, razors, belts and other implements that could be used as weapons. Although bewildered, Lily plays along, acknowledging that they are playing a \"prison game.\" As Timothy continues to move the pile of rocks, Ritchie and Lily sit and watch from the beach house porch. When Timothy starts to take a break, Ritchie orders him to stand and hold a large rock, telling Lily that Timothy is undergoing the most therapeutic experience of his life. Ritchie informs Lily that, during American Revolutionary War battles, families of officers often watched from nearby. He also describes how he collected guns from the enemy corpses in Vietnam and that when he was wounded, someone stole his guns, believing he was dead. Unexpectedly, the dog attacks Timothy, causing him to bleed and, although the wound is minor, both Lily and Timothy panic.\nIn the evening, Timothy paints, ignoring Lily, who resumes a former smoking habit. At the same time, Stanley visits Ritchie, who shares with him military stories of tormenting subordinates, and their loud laughter, amplified by the water, unnerves Lily and Timothy. Later, the Frishers awaken to discover Ritchie towing away their car. When they go out to protest, the dogs threaten to attack them. During the night, Timothy tries to escape using the motorboat, forcing the frightened Lily to join him. However, the boat is cabled to the dock and Ritchie takes them back to the beach house, where he orders both dogs to guard them.\nThe next day, which happens to be the Fourth of July, American Legionnaires ceremoniously present Ritchie with a flag to honor his deceased father, a colonel, as part of an annual ritual. Afterward, while Timothy continues to move the rocks, Lily goes to Ritchie's house to talk. When she admits she is lonely, Ritchie asks if it is because of Timothy and promises that the situation will soon be different. She asks Ritchie's opinion of her and he says she needs a man, not a boy, who will bring her \"peace and pleasure\" that she has never known. Lily agrees that her soul is starved and, as Ritchie confides to her a story about a little girl he knew as a child, she removes her clothing, angering Ritchie. When she begs him to let them leave, he yells at her, forcing her to retreat, naked, to the beach house. Ritchie then shouts at Timothy, who has removed his shirt in the hot sun, and tells him to put it back on and button it up. Almost incoherently, he bellows that buttons are the difference between wild savages and civilization.\nThat night, still out of control, Ritchie prays for God to kill his enemies and burn them. He begs, \"Bring fire on them!\" and, as if on cue, a fireworks display commences, causing Ritchie to rejoice in sardonic glee. Meanwhile, Timothy pens up a dog and tries to barricade himself and Lily in the beach house. In retaliation, Ritchie shouts an attack command to the dogs and while Timothy fends off one dog, Lily manages to stab the other dog to death. Soon after, Ritchie gains entrance through a window and he and Timothy fight in the dark. Their struggling ends and Ritchie, lying on the ground exhausted, catches his breath.

She despairs, but must remain alive to raise their daughter Tomoko alone. In 1952, the Military Family Survivor Benefits Law is enacted, but the government refuses her benefits, claiming that Katsuo Togashi was a deserter in New Guinea in August 1945. All of the military records had been burned at the end of the war, so the Ministry of Welfare sent inquiries to the other men in Katsuo's unit but received no response from four men. Sakie tracks down these four men and asks them to reveal the truth about Katsuo's actions.\nPrivate First Class Tsugio Terajima says that he was never sent an inquiry and tells Sakie how Sgt. Togashi saved his life in 1943 in the fight against Americans and Australians in New Guinea by defying orders and telling the men not to proceed into an obvious trap, then again in 1944 by telling him to flee a sick camp when he learns of a plan to kill the sick. Terajima now lives in a Korean shanty town and is unwilling to visit Tokyo to testify. Corporal Tomotaka Akiba, now an actor playing a comedic caricature of a Japanese holdout on stage, tells Sakie that he remembers a sergeant being shot for stealing potatoes from the military supply, but is not certain if it was Sgt.

P. is ordered to shoot the prisoner. Goto, left traumatized by the incident, had become increasingly hostile and had forced his subordinates into hard labor and had hoarded their rations, so Sgt. Togashi and others had killed him. After the war, one of them had confessed to the killing so Senda had them all killed by firing squad without a court-martial to cover up his botched execution of the Australian.  Sakie confronts Major Takeo Senda, who insists that he followed proper procedure. He tells her that only the three men involved in the murder had been executed but that Terajima had been spared.\nSakie returns to Terajima, who admits that his previous story was a lie but explains that Goto had refused to believe that the war was over and had ordered a new offensive. He had drawn his sword on the famished Terajima, causing Togashi and two other men to kill him to save Terajima. The others then left for HQ while Terajima, unable to walk, cooked and ate Goto to survive. He later confessed the murder but was spared while Togashi and the two others were executed by Military Police Sergeant Ochi. Terajima and Sakie discover that Ochi has been struck and killed by a vehicle while crossing on a red light while intoxicated.

The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by M\u00fcller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the B\u00fcrgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, M\u00fcller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \"the Circus of Night\". After laying his body in the crypt, she escapes through a tunnel as the villagers blow up the castle with gunpowder and set fire to it.\nFifteen years later, Stetl is being ravaged by a plague and blockaded by the authorities of neighbouring towns, with men ready to shoot any villager who tries to leave. The citizens fear that the pestilence may be due to the Count's curse, though the new physician Dr. Kersh dismisses vampires as just a myth. A travelling circus, calling itself the Circus of Night, then arrives at the village, directed by a dwarf and an alluring gypsy woman who are equivocal about how they got past the blockade; the villagers, appreciative of the distraction from their troubles, do not much question the matter. No-one in the village suspects that one of the circus artists, Emil, is Count Mitterhaus's cousin and a vampire, as are the twin acrobats Heinrich and Helga. Emil and the gypsy woman go to the ruins of the castle, where in the crypt they find the Count's staked body still preserved, and they restate his curse that all who killed him and all their children must die.\nWhilst his son Anton distracts the armed men at the blockade, Dr. Kersh gets past them to appeal for help from the capital. At the Circus of Night, the villagers are amazed and delighted by the entertainment. Despite his wife's concerns over their wayward daughter, Rosa, and her attraction to the handsome Emil, the B\u00fcrgermeister takes her to the circus and, at the gypsy woman's invitation, visits its hall of mirrors where he sees, in one called \"The Mirror of Life\", a vision of a revived Count Mitterhaus, which causes him to collapse. Frightened by this event, Schilt tries to flee with his family from the blockaded village with the circus dwarf Michael as their guide, only to be abandoned by him in the forest and mauled to death by Emil, whose shapeshifting form is a black panther.\nM\u00fcller's daughter Dora, whom he sent away earlier for her protection, has slipped past the blockade and is returning to the village to reunite with her father and her beloved Anton when she discovers the Schilts' dismembered bodies, arousing suspicions about the animals of the circus. That evening, Jon and Gustav Hauser, two village boys whose father helped instigate the killing of Mitterhaus, are invited by the gypsy woman to enter the hall of mirrors and are magically drawn by Heinrich and Helga to the Count's crypt, where they are killed and drained. After the boys' bodies are found near the castle, their grieving father and the sick B\u00fcrgermeister begin to shoot the circus animals. After an encounter with Emil the B\u00fcrgermeister dies of heart failure, and his daughter leaves with the vampire. The vampire then kills and drains her in the crypt.\nDora and Anton are lured by the twins into the hall of mirrors where they try to whisk Dora through the Mirror of Life, but the cross she is wearing saves her. Later, the vampires enter the school house where Dora and Anton have taken refuge. Emil, in panther form, kills the boarding students, diverting Anton, while the gypsy woman (revealed to be Anna M\u00fcller and the twins' mother) tears the cross from Dora's neck, enabling Heinrich and Helga to attack her. Dora, however, escapes into the school chapel, where the twins are overwhelmed by a giant crucifix which she topples on them, destroying them. Nevertheless, with the help of the circus strongman, Emil and Anna succeed in having Dora and her guardian, Hauser's wife Gerta, kidnapped and taken to the crypt at Castle Mitterhaus, where they intend to use their blood - just like the blood from their previous child victims - as part of a ritual to restore the Count back to life.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Kersch returns from the capital with an imperial escort and medicines for the plague. He also brings news of vampire killings in other villages, all of them visited by the Circus of Night. The men attack the circus and set fire to it, killing the strongman when he tries to stop them. As Hauser starts to burn down the hall of mirrors, he sees in the Mirror of Life a vision of Emil and Anna bleeding Gerta over the Count's body. This horrifying sight distracts him long enough to be burned fatally by the fire, but he lives long enough to alert Anton and the other men to Dora's plight.\nBack in the castle crypt, the suddenly remorseful Anna is killed when she attempts to save Dora from Emil. Anton, finding his way through the tunnel into the crypt despite a deadly ambush by Michael the dwarf, attempts to rescue Dora but is halted by Emil. Just then M\u00fcller, Dr. Kersh, and a soldier break into the crypt and battle Emil who kills or disables all his attackers, but M\u00fcller pierces him with the stake from the Count's chest just as he is dying from Emil's bite. Revived by the stake's removal, the Count rises from his sarcophagus and advances on Dora and Anton. Anton uses M\u00fcller's crossbow as a makeshift cross, repelling the Count long enough for him to jam the vampire's neck between the weapon's bow and stock and then pulling the trigger, decapitating him.

Convinced that his patient has a maximum of two years to live, Galipeau convinces his brother Emile to use a 'viager' (life annuity) to buy Martinet's lovely country house in the fishing village of Saint-Tropez (at the time, St-Tropez was not the world renowned destination it is today). The 'viager' is a French system whereby someone buys a house from a person, repaying them by instalments until the person's death, only upon which the house finally transfers to the buyer. Thanks to Martinet's declining health, the Galipeau expect to not pay for long and get his house for cheap.\nThinking Dr Galipeau is right, despite the fact that the doctor is always wrong whenever he says something (a running gag throughout the movie), Emile, under the advice of the notary dealing with the life annuity contract, accepts to index the 'viager' each year following the course of aluminium - a popular investment in the 1930s. The Galipeau believe that, even if aluminium's value goes up, it will not amount to much since they expect Martinet to die within a couple years.\nDespite Dr Galipeau's repeated claims that Martinet will soon die, as the years go by the elderly Martinet gets better and better, and the price of the 'viager' keeps getting higher due to aluminium's value constant increase. Finally fed up with this elderly who won't die and after seeing the annuity they must pay go through the roof, the Galipeau family (L\u00e9on, his wife Marguerite, Emile and his wife Elvire) decide to get rid of Martinet themselves.\nIn 1940, the early years of WWII, an attempt to make Martinet pass for a German spy is foiled by bad timing, as it happens on the day of France's surrender. In 1943, they try to make Martinez pass for a Gaullist and a R\u00e9sistant. Unfortunately for the Galipeau, the letter is not delivered until the Lib\u00e9ration, upon which their letter allows Martinet to become a decorated hero as everyone now believes he was a Resistant. A few years later, during a visit of Martinet to Paris, the Galipeau attempt to take advantage of Martinet's old age by making him have a heart attack. They spend the day visiting monuments where they must climb hundreds of steps, they try to lose Martinet in Paris' Catacombs and also have him overeat, overdrink and smoke a lot by taking him to several restaurants and bars throughout Paris. This proves fruitless as the boy is perfectly healthy and more than happy to climb steps (he even counts them for his personal enjoyment), smoke, eat and drink like there is no tomorrow. Their day ends with the group rushing to the station for Martinet to catch his train back to St-Tropez. In a reversal of fortune, Marguerite dies of exhaustion from their day of excessive activity on the platform as the train departs.\nThe years go by, Martinet seems to be tireless. He becomes even more popular locally as he performs shows in St-Tropez as the village slowly grows famous thanks to celebrities coming there. Not willing to give up and after having trouble paying for the annuity, Emile decides to murder Martinet. He invites him for a trip on a paddle boat out to sea where he schemes to shoot him and ditch his body in the water, planning to tell everyone Martinet fell and drowned as a cover-up story. Once again, this plan is foiled as the paddle boat breaks down, prompting Martinet to swim back to shore for help, leaving Emile (who does not know how to swim) alone on the paddle boat. Unfortunately, the manager of the paddle boat rental happens to be Captain Bucigny-Dumaine, the military man to whom the Galipeau tried to denounce Martinet twice during the war (As a result of these two botched denunciations, Bucigny-Dumaine was revoked from the military and now despises the Galipeau whom he blames for it). While pretending to rescue him, the Captain tries to murder Emile but gets shot dead in the process, while Emile falls from the paddle boat and drowns (As their bodies are never found, Martinet never knows Emile had a gun and was here to shoot him).\nSeveral years later, Martinet, now in his 80s, contracts influenza. Hoping to finally see him die, the remaining Galipeau plotters, L\u00e9on and Elvire, visit him in the hospital where they find him healed and enjoying life. Under the disguise of cleaning his house before his return from hospital, L\u00e9on and Elvire sabotage the place to have Martinet fall down the stairs of the balcony to his death. The plan backfires : Elvire dies and L\u00e9on ends up in hospital.\nA few years later, No\u00ebl (Emile and Elvire's son and L\u00e9on's nephew) is now in his late 30s and earns a living by stealing from homes.

Her husband Paul is later remarried to 22 year old Elise. Three months into their marriage, Marcus returns home from boarding school, two weeks before term finals. Elise meets him in the hallway of the house and asks him how he returned home. Marcus replied that he took a thousand pesos from his father's study, prompting Elise into thinking that he stole the money. She later tries to warm up to Marcus and asks him about his early return from school, to which he replies that a chickenpox epidemic broke out there. Elise notices further abnormal behavior from Marcus, who also takes a sexual interest into her.\nDays later, Marcus' father Paul returns and him and Elise discuss about the stolen money from Paul's study at a dinner. Marcus now claims that he took three hundred pesos as he didn't have any pesos on him for the taxi ride home. Elise quickly contradicts this and tells Paul about their first encounter where Marcus claimed he took a thousand pesos, but can't present any proof to Paul. Paul lets the matter slide.\nElise, now fully suspicious about Marcus, begins searching his room for the stolen money. She finds the shredded remains of a letter Marcus received from the mail earlier which he claimed to have come from his school book club. She becomes even more suspicious and decides to pay Marcus' school a visit. There, the Principal Dr. Kessler tells her about Marcus' stalking crimes. He even says about the findings of crude sexual drawings in Marcus' dorm in school, which lead into his expulsion. Kessler also tells Elise about Marcus' obsession of torturing and killing animals. A shocked Elise later tells Paul about this, who admits Marcus' mental disorientation after his mother's death. He reassures Elise that Marcus needs more time and love.\nHowever, Elise still struggles to fully accept Marcus into her life. She later discovers Sarah's clothes hidden in the attic. She confronts Marcus about the finding, but Marcus denies putting the clothes there. Elise later asks Marcus how his mother was like, but Marcus accuses Elise of distrust and leaves.\nOne night Paul takes Elise into a house party, where she feels uneasy among the guests. She then runs into Dr. Viorne in the bathroom, who tells Elise that Sarah, Marcus' mother, had died there. Viorne also tells her that she slipped into the tub and drowned as she suddenly went into a heart attack. A shocked Elise then demands answers from Paul, who reluctantly tells her that the house belonged to them before Sarah died. After her death, Paul sold the house to Viorne and moved to their new home.\nThroughout the film, Elise keeps growing more suspicious about Marcus. She keeps telling Paul about his lies and denials about the crimes he committed, but Paul pays no heed. Before Paul's departure to Paris, a drunk Elise keeps taunting Marcus into admitting his crimes, but Marcus mocks her instead. She then tries to reconcile with Paul, but he ignores her and leaves for the airport.\nAfter Paul leaves, Elise lies in bed until she notices a hole in her bedroom ceiling. She runs to the attic where she finds a hole was dug underneath the floorboards so that she and Paul can be spied upon. Elise then rushes up to Marcus' bedroom and demands answers for everything. She then demands the truth about Sarah's death, as she suspected Marcus killed her. Marcus agrees to answer, only if Elise offered herself to him. Elise then reluctantly strips herself nude while asking about Sarah's death. Marcus then admits to the murder to a nude Elise, who can't believe his confessions. She then rebuffs Marcus' claims and storms off the room. Marcus claims that he was not a child, as children could not murder their mothers.\nA frantic Elise then calls Paul back from the airport about the hole in the attic. She then takes him there, but finds that hole filled in, presumably by Marcus. Elise pleads Paul to believe her, to which Paul doesn't answer, but also doesn't say anything to Elise. A couple of days later, Paul finds their family dog floating dead in the pool. Marcus later takes the carcass and buries it.\nElise then goes to Dr. Viorne's office, who questions her about all the discoveries and accusations against Marcus. By using reverse psychology in a lengthy inquiry, Viorne makes her doubt her claims as she had no proof. Viorne then demands why Elise stripped nude in front of Marcus, who was a minor. She also accuses Elise of killing the family dog. Elise denies the claims and keeps telling that she was made to strip by Marcus in exchange of his confession, but Viorne doesn't believe her.\nElise, now being accused of sexually assaulting a minor, becomes mentally unstable and decides to kill Marcus in his sleep. When she is about to smother him, Paul interrupts and takes her away. Elise is then taken to a mental asylum, where she is given high sedatives. She then starts having nightmares of her killing Marcus, her getting killed by the family dog unleashed by Marcus, and her having sex with Marcus while Paul watches on. \nElise is later released from the asylum after her recovery.

However, Mrs. Kinsolving's car will not start due to the light snowstorm, forcing Francesca to sleep at the home. By the morning, a blizzard has set in, stranding her at the home for a few days. She soon begins to suspect that something is amiss, due to inconsistencies in the information Matthew told her and Mrs. Kinsolving's statements. For example, Matthew never mentioned he had a sister, while Mrs. Kinsolving claims that the mentally challenged and non-verbal Kathleen is Matthew's sister. She also finds a telegraph from Matthew informing his mother of his marriage, contrary to Mrs. Kinsolving's claim he did not.\nAfter Mrs. Kinsolving and Kathleen retire for the night, Francesca sneaks around and discovers in the family Bible that Maria died eleven days after Matthew was killed. From letters of Matthew's she finds, she deduces \"Mrs. Kinsolving\" is actually Maria's sister-in-law Katherine, the mother of Kathleen and Kenny; from a newspaper clipping brought by Kathleen earlier, she finds he is a serial rapist and murderer. In the morning, Francesca goes into labor, but Mrs. Kinsolving refuses to call for an ambulance. She sedates Francesca heavily and delivers the baby herself. When the baby is born, Mrs. Kinsolving announces it is dead and hands it over to Kathleen to bury. She nonchalantly tells Francesca that her baby girl was buried on the grounds.\nThat night, Kathleen rouses Francesca and takes her to the attic, where she finds Kathleen has hidden her baby, who is actually very much alive, in a picnic basket. Mrs. Kinsolving, correctly suspecting Francesca is sneaking around the mansion, locks her in her room. Kathleen is able to locate the key to the room and unlocks it, allowing Francesca to care for her baby. She is also able to tell Francesca that Kenny is hiding in the house; she later overhears him conversing with Mrs. Kinsolving in the basement laundry room. Kenny suspects Francesca knows about him, but is calmed by Katherine, who is focused on getting her out as soon as possible so Kenny can escape the country. After catching Francesca coming down from the attic, she realizes Francesca has gotten a key to the room, but is convinced she does not know Kenny is hiding in the house.\nThe next morning, Mrs. Kinsolving announces that the blizzard has cleared enough for a driver to take Francesca into town to take the bus back to Los Angeles. At breakfast, the \"driver\" arrives \u2014 and it is Kenny. Francesca quickly tells Mrs. Kinsolving that she left her gloves in her third-floor room and she needs to retrieve them. Instead, she gets her baby from the attic, hides the baby under her coat, and flees the mansion. Mrs. Kinsolving spots Francesca running away and sends Kenny to get her. Francesca sees Kenny is quickly gaining ground, and she darts into the carriage house in an attempt to elude him. Kenny locates her and knocks her out cold, while the baby slips from under her coat. Kenny smiles sadistically and covers the crying baby's face with his hand. Suddenly, Kathleen sneaks up behind him and stabs him in the back with a pair of scissors that Francesca was going to cut Kathleen's hair with.

Churchill is a junior officer in India determined to make a name for himself and to become a member of Parliament. As the older Churchill (voiced by Simon Ward) narrates, events shift back to his childhood. As a boy, Churchill is sent to a preparatory boarding school but is unhappy there and is removed by his parents after a particularly vicious caning by the sadistic headmaster. Later, at the entrance examination to Harrow School, Churchill submits a blank paper; however the headmaster, James Welldon, sees Churchill's potential and accepts him. One evening he recites a long poem of 1000 lines at a Harrow presentation. His nanny comes to listen but his parents do not, despite Churchill's express invitation. Churchill would later describe her as the only person who never let him down.\nMeanwhile, Churchill's father Lord Randolph destroys his career by resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer; George Buckle, editor of The Times, refuses to support his position. Doctors Roose and Buzzard inform Lady Churchill that her that her husband has an incurable disease, will probably die in five or six years, and that they must never again have \"physical relations\".One morning, Churchill comes down to breakfast but his behaviour infuriates his father. Lord Randolph angrily sends his son up to his room, but after a conversation with his wife he goes to make up with his son, who is playing with his large collection of tin soldiers. Churchill eagerly accepts his father's suggestion that he go into the army; his father later admits to his mother that he feels Winston lacks the brains for university or a career as a barrister. After three attempts, Churchill is finally accepted by Sandhurst but his father is not pleased because he finished seventh from the bottom of the class and is only eligible to enter the cavalry which costs an extra \u00a3200 a year for a horse. Lord Randolph - clearly ill and making a number of factual errors about his son - scolds Churchill and warns him to face up to his responsibilities at Sandhurst and that if he does not make something of himself by 21 he will no longer support him.\nStill only in his mid forties, Lord Randolph, once a brilliant debater, makes an incoherent speech in Parliament, witnessed by both his wife and Winston. His death spells the end of Churchill's dream of entering Parliament at his side. Churchill graduates from Sandhurst near the top of the class, he becomes a second lieutenant and eventually goes to India and then takes part in the cavalry charge at the Battle of Omdurman in the Sudan. Later, he goes to South Africa to work as a war correspondent during the Anglo-Boer War. While travelling by armoured train, Churchill and soldiers are ambushed by Boers. They try to retreat but crash into a barricade of rocks on the railway track. Churchill courageously organises the soldiers to push the derailed carriage off the track so the train can proceed with the wounded, but the others are captured by the Boers. Churchill escapes, getting help from mine manager Howard, hiding three nights in the mine then riding a goods train into neutral Portuguese territory. He returns to England a hero, stands for the parliamentary seat of Oldham and wins, becoming an MP in a Conservative majority Parliament. With the encouragement of opposition Liberal MP Lloyd George, to the dismay of his mother and annoyance of senior Conservatives, he takes up his father's campaign to limit spending on the military.\nThe film ends with Sir Winston Churchill narrating events that follow including his marriage to Clementine Hozier seven years later.

A key early plot-point is the elegant gown that belonged to Rouvigny's dead mother that he catches Irina wearing which angers him. After his mistress Fausta, a young student and bookstore employee, is found murdered, Oliviero becomes the primary suspect after being fingered by Fausta's  boss Bartello.

Later, Irina investigates the supposed flat tire in the boot of her husbands car but he catches her and angrily beats her. During the night during a heavy thunder storm, Brenda puts on Esther's gown and is silently watched by Oliviero.
