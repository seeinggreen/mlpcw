When Samuel protests, he is struck by an officer and soon becomes delirious with fever, dying shortly afterward.

After some persuasion, Charlie goes along with the plan.\nCharlie allows Rose to navigate the river by rudder while he tends the engine, and she is emboldened after they pass the first set of rapids with minimal flooding in the boat. When they pass the German fortress, the soldiers begin shooting at them, damaging the boiler. Charlie manages to reattach a pressure hose just as they are about to enter the second set of rapids. The boat rolls and pitches as it goes down the rapids, leading to more severe flooding on the deck. While celebrating their success, Charlie and Rose find themselves in an embrace and kiss.

The K\u00f6nigin Luise returns and Charlie and Rose steam the African Queen out onto the lake in darkness, intending to set her on a collision course.

Wolkonska believes Frank to be a good match of a husband for her daughter Olga (Julia Koschka), so she offers to loan the money Frank needs on the condition that he continues his studies at the Sorbonne University in Paris, as a means to keep him away from Alraune.

Though Frank informs her that he'll be leaving for Paris the next day, Alraune wishes to accompany him and leave her father. The two come up with a plan to meet the next day again at the sundial. Once ten Brinken learns of their plan, he changes his mind about the loan, as a way to keep Alraune at bay, to which Frank refuses as confesses his love for Alraune.

She goes horseback riding with Gerald during a rainstorm, carriage riding with Mathieu, ten Brinken's coachman, and poses herself for Ralph to paint her. When one of Alraune's necklace winds up missing, she accuses her teacher, Mademoiselle Duvaliere (Denise Vernac), which in fact was found inside her luggage, who is then fired for theft.

Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer.\n\nAs they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields. Their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire extras to attend his funeral.  Despite the ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood.\nShields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at the funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a $1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to direct. The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel goes to work for him. Amiel becomes an Oscar-winning director.\nShields next encounters alcoholic small-time actress Lorrison, the daughter of a famous actor Shields admired. He builds up her confidence and gives her the leading role in one of his movies over everyone else's objections. When she falls in love with him, he lets her think that he feels the same way so that she does not self-destruct and he gets the performance he needs. After the premiere makes her a star overnight, she finds him with a bit player named Lila. He tells her that he will never allow anyone to have that much control over him.  Crushed, Lorrison walks out on her contract. Rather than suing her, Shields lets her go to another studio. She becomes a top Hollywood star.\nFinally, Bartlow is a contented professor at a small college who has written a bestselling book for which Shields has purchased the film rights. Shields wants Bartlow himself to write the script. Bartlow is not interested, but his shallow Southern belle wife Rosemary is, so he gives in. They go to Hollywood, where her constant distractions keep him from his work. Shields gets his suave actor friend Victor \"Gaucho\" Ribera to keep her occupied.

Nobody could sing in the city unless he or she could sing better than Tansen. If this was not the case, he or she was executed. Baiju Bawra is the story of an unknown singer, Baiju, who is on a mission to defeat Tansen in a musical duel to avenge the death of his father.\nWhen Baiju is still a child, Tansen's sentry tries to stop Baiju's father from singing, and in the ensuing scuffle, his father dies. Before dying, he extracts a promise from his son to take revenge against Tansen. Baiju gets shelter from a village priest and while growing up, falls in love with Gauri, the daughter of a boatman. He continues his musical education on his own, but gets so enamoured by Gauri's love that he forgets the promise made to his father.\nLater, a group of dacoits raid Baiju's village. With his song, Baiju persuades them against looting the village, but the female leader of the dacoits falls in love with him and asks him to follow them to their fort as a condition for their sparing the village. Baiju leaves with her, leaving the wailing Gauri behind. In the fort, the dacoit leader, who is actually a princess living in exile, tells Baiju how her father's serfdom had been usurped and she was seeking revenge because the village too previously belonged to her father. The word \"revenge\" brings all of Baiju's memories back; he leaves the fort greatly agitated, and the princess does not try to stop him.\nBaiju sneaks into the Mughal palace, where Tansen is singing. He is dumbstruck by the way Tansen sings, and the sword that was supposed to cut the maestro's throat fell on the tanpura, saddening Tansen. He said he could only be killed by music, and the pain that accompanies it. \"Dip your notes in melancholy and I'll die on my own,\" he said. Baiju accordingly leaves the palace to learn \"real\" music.\nBaiju remembers that when his father was killed, he was taking Baiju to Swami Haridas. He goes to see the Swami himself and asks for his guidance, informing him of his plan to take revenge against Tansen. Haridas tells Baiju that one must be in love to be a true musician, and thus Baiju must rid himself of all the hatred in his heart, but still gives him a veena and accepts him as his disciple. Baiju again starts his musical training, spending all his time in a Shiva temple, but his vengeful feelings never leave him. Nonetheless, he still reveres his guru, Haridas. After learning that his teacher had fallen seriously ill and was unable to walk, Baiju sings a song that so thrills Haridas that the master gets out of his bed and starts to walk.\nGauri, meanwhile, is so distraught over Baiju's departure that she is about to swallow poison. At that point, the princess who had taken Baiju from the village comes to her and tells her that she knows of Baiju's whereabouts. Gauri meets Baiju and tries to convince him to return to the village so they can be married; Baiju, however, refuses, as he feels he must take revenge against Tansen. At this point, Haridas arrives, and Baiju goes to receive him, once again leaving a crying Gauri behind. Haridas tells Baiju that to be a true singer, he has to feel real pain. Hearing this, Gauri decides to make a venomous snake bite her, thinking that her death would bring enough grief to Baiju that he would defeat Tansen. Baiju sees Gauri's lifeless body and goes mad, with the princess' attempts to get through to him being futile. Baiju instead goes to the Shiva temple and sings a heart-wrenching song condemning the God who had consigned him to his fate; even the idol of Lord Shiva sheds tears at Baiju's grief.\nIn his delirious state, Baiju reaches Tansen's city, singing the whole way. The residents fear for his life and call him bawra (insane), hence the title of the movie. Baiju is caught and imprisoned, but the princess frees him. However, both of them are caught by Mughal soldiers when escaping, leaving a musical duel with Tansen as the only way to save his life.\nEmperor Akbar himself witnesses the competition. For a long time, both the singers prove to be equally good. Then Akbar suggests that whoever could melt a marble slab with his singing would win the duel. Baiju manages to do so and wins the competition, saving his own life and finally avenging his father's death. Tansen accepts his defeat graciously, and is in fact happy that there is someone better than him. Baiju persuades Akbar to spare Tansen's life, to return the princess' land to her, and to allow music in the streets.\nAfter winning the musical duel, Baiju departs from the court. Emperor Akbar is unhappy to see him go and asks Tansen to sing to produce a storm and floods to make him stay. Tansen sings raga Megh and the river Yamuna floods.

During dinner, the guests get involved in a debate about politics. While Irene's cousin Andr\u00e9, a Communist who writes for a political newspaper, predicts peace for the world, a conservative friend of Irene is convinced that the world is heading straight for war. The party abruptly comes to an end when Michel falls down the building's stairs and is hospitalised for a fracture of the hip bone. At the hospital, Irene learns that Michel might have hurt himself by purpose to receive attention. Irene promises Michel that from now on she will always stay with him. When Michel dies shortly after from a blood clot, Irene falls into a crisis.\nAfter a few days, Irene is called up by Andr\u00e9 and agrees to meet with him. Like her husband and mother, he urges her to find a way out of her present state and stop blaming herself for Michel's death. If there were anyone to blame, it was post-war society and the child's growing up in fear during a war. He tells Irene of a young boy doomed to die because his poor family can't afford to pay for the expensive medicine. After paying a visit to the boy's home with Andr\u00e9, Irene, shaken by the poor circumstances which the family lives in, donates the money needed for the medication. On her next visit, she is thanked by the child's family and the neighbours who gather spontaneously. A young woman neighbour, Ines, shows up and complains about the noise which prevents her from sleeping. The neighbours, speaking disdainfully of her, tell Irene that Ines is working as a prostitute during the night.\nIrene meets a young woman living with six children in a small shack by the river. Three of the children are her own, which she had with a lover who left her, while the three others are orphans taken in by her. Asked by Irene to help the young woman, Andr\u00e9 secures her a job at a local factory. Shortly before her first day at the factory, the young woman tells Irene that she wants to meet a man she once knew and can't show up at her job. Irene steps in for her and is concerned about the working conditions. When she later tells Andr\u00e9 of her experience, he argues that the exploited have to be freed, even if it means the use of violence. Irene rejects his view, as for her, love is the only answer to the world's troubles, and says that she is dreaming of a paradise both for the living and the departed. At home, she is accused by George of having an affair with Andr\u00e9.\nAfter visiting a church, Irene runs into Ines, who just had a confrontation with other prostitutes for streetwalking in their district. Irene takes Ines back to her home, where Ines coughs up blood. She has her examined by a doctor, who declares that Ines is in the final state of tuberculosis and that her case is hopeless. Irene watches over Ines, who eventually dies of her illness. When she goes to a neighbour to bring her the news, she is confronted with their armed teenage son, who is on the run from the police after a bank robbery. Irene helps him escape, but urges him to turn himself in by his own free will.\nIrene is taken into custody by the police for helping a delinquent escape. When the teenage robber turns himself in, and George's lawyer appeals to the police arguing that Irene is in a state of shock after her son's death, and that her husband is an important representative of the American industry, she is put under observation in a mental institution. There, she has a discussion with a priest who appreciates her desire to help as being of a true Christian spirit, but argues that all help and acts of love have to follow certain regulations. Irene disagrees, calling these regulations responsible for the evils in this world, which can only be overcome with love and compassion for oneself and everybody else. Shortly after, she witnesses an inmate being rescued from a suicide attempt. She lies down next to the woman, telling her that she is not alone and that she will stay by her side.\nSome time later, Irene is questioned by a committee, consisting of representatives of the law, George's lawyer, and the head of the mental institution. Again, she tries to explain her motives by saying that she simply wants to help those who are in need of help, and that salvation is only possible if everyone is saved. As her explanation does neither suffice from a radical political nor a dogmatic Christian point of view, she is declared mentally unstable and institutionalised.

Instead of being frightened, she climbs onto the dog's back and falls asleep in his fur. Despite wincing at her kneading, Marc instantly falls for the kitten and decides to adopt her, bringing her home with him.\nUpon his arrival, his human owner (voiced by Bea Benaderet), tired of picking up his things, orders him not to bring one more thing inside the house. As she reprimands him, Marc Anthony discreetly hides the kitten under a bowl. Much of the cartoon centers on the kitten keeping several steps ahead of the dog, continually getting into things around the house. Each time she nearly alerts the dog's owner of her presence, he employs various tactics to hide or disguise her as common household items, including a powder puff, much to his owner's confusion.\nAfter a while, Marc Anthony takes the kitten into the kitchen and tries to reprimand her, but quickly forgets his anger when she tries to play with his wagging finger. But when he hears his owner walking toward the kitchen, he hastily hides the kitten in a flour canister and tries to look innocent. Growing tired of his antics, his owner ejects him from the kitchen and tells him to stay out while she bakes cookies. Marc Anthony watches as his owner scoops out a cup of flour, and is horrified to see that the kitten is in the measuring cup. The lady pours the flour, along with the kitten, into a mixing bowl and prepares to use an electric mixer. The dog tries several times to thwart or distract her, finally spraying his face with whipped cream to make himself appear rabid. His exasperated owner sees through his disguise and throws him out of the house. Meanwhile, the kitten climbs out of the bowl and hides out of sight to clean herself up.\nMarc Anthony, unaware that the kitten has escaped, can only watch in horror as his owner mixes the cookie batter, rolls out the dough, cuts it into shapes and places the cookies in the oven.

His mistress comes out a short time later and, believing he is crying over being disciplined, lets him back inside and tells him he has been punished enough. She attempts to console him by giving him a cookie in the shape of a cat. Stunned, Marc takes the cookie and places it on his back where the kitten had slept earlier, then collapses and bawls uncontrollably.\nThe kitten then walks up and meows at him. Marc Anthony, immediately overjoyed to see his friend alive, picks the kitten up and kisses her, then suddenly realizes that his owner is watching. He vainly tries to disguise the kitten like he did earlier, but then begs at his mistress's feet.

Martineau, his wife, and their engineer and friend Peter, set sail on a pleasant day for Doville, however they never arrived. After being unable to contact the Cyclops an enquiry assumed they struck a mine and were lost at sea. A month later three fishermen discover the Cyclops devoid of crew and off course. Another enquiry is held and discovers that the ship must have been abandoned at least three days, the machinery and equipment was in perfect working order, no attempt had been made to contact another ship, and that one of the lifebuoys was missing, however they are unsure if the automatic steering was engaged. A body is found washed up on the beach, however Martineau's housekeeper explains it cannot be him as it doesn't have the burn scar Martineau received on his arm as a student. The enquiry concludes assuming two of those onboard must have drowned trying to save the third.\nThe Yard Manager tells Guy and Margret that the Cyclops has since changed hands many times but has never found a long-term owner. He also tells them that he believes the ship is haunted as he had mysteriously smelt cigar smoke, however Guy believes the Yard master is reluctant to sell as he uses the ship for smuggling. Guy and Margret buy the Cyclops after being told that it is in great shape and working perfectly and move it to a dry dock for overhaul and repainting. Unable to find a local deckhand, Guy reluctantly hires Mansel, who also doesn't believe the yacht is haunted and has been rather poorly looking after the Cyclops for years. Guy and Margret host a house-warming party onboard to celebrate their first successful trip out on the Cyclops, where a guest tells Guy he smells a Havana cigar despite none being present. That night the engineer hired to run the boat quits after claiming that his wife has become ill, however later the Yard Manager tells Guy that he doesn't believe the engineer had a wife at all and that a rumour is spreading that he left after seeing a ghost.\nGuy hires a new engineer but Margret complains that he smokes cigars in their quarters as she can smell the smoke. When Guy goes to confront the engineer he quits, claiming to have seen a ghost on board as well. Margret receives a call from the bridge but hears only breathing, and discovers that Guy is only next door and Mansel has the evening off. When Guy and Margret investigate they find the bridge empty, however Margret smells cigar smoke again and faints. A worried Margret begins to believe something supernatural is happening, however Guy still believes someone is trying to trick them into abandoning the Cyclops. Later, while working in the engine room, Guy sees a man smoking a cigar who disappears when Guy challenges him. Debating whether to sell the Cyclops or not, Margret contacts the Institute for Investigation of Psychic Phenomena (IIPP) to hire a paranormal investigator.\nDr. Fawcett arrives and feels a strong psychic influence onboard the Cyclops after also smelling cigar smoke, although Guy still remains sceptical. Dr. Fawcett invites his medium Mrs. Manley onboard to host a s\u00e9ance where she contacts the spirits onboard. The group discover that Martineau's wife and Peter were having an affair and planned to kill Martineau and push him overboard. As Mrs. Martineau and Peter make their plan however, Martineau is able to hear them after breaking the phone on the bridge. Martineau confronts his wife and Peter and shoots them before hiding their bodies in a disused water tank under the floor boards, taking some money, changing the ship's course, and jumping overboard with one of the lifebuoys. Guy and Dr Fawcett find the water tank to confirm the story but before they can call the police, Mansel commits suicide on deck. After seeing a burn scar on Mansel's arm Guy realises that he is Professor Martineau. Dr Fawcett tells a still doubtful Guy that with Martineau dead the haunting should stop.

Deciding he wants Tweety as his present, he switches the tags on the gifts just as Granny comes downstairs.\nGranny gives the cage to Sylvester and opens the box with the rubber mouse. Believing it to be a mix-up, she goes to give Sylvester his box and correct the mistake, but once she sees a satisfied Sylvester hiccup Tweety's feathers, she immediately gets wise and makes the cat spit up the bird. After a thorough scolding, Granny insists that Sylvester kiss Tweety under a sprig of mistletoe, but the now-sulking cat eats Tweety again instead, leading to another forced regurgitation.\nGranny places Tweety's cage on a pole where she thinks Sylvester won't be able to reach it, but the ever-resourceful feline is determined to get his meal. On his first attempt, Tweety points out a huge present waiting under the Christmas tree.

An angry Granny, armed with a broomstick, is waiting on at the end of the claw instead and chases Sylvester off with it.\nFrom the attic, the cat saws a hole in the floor and then uses a hook to grab the latch at the top of Tweety's cage.

After replacing the wrecked cage, a dazed and blackened Sylvester stumbles down the stairs.\nDuring a Western-style showdown with Tweety, Sylvester-as-Geronimo sneaks up the Christmas tree and snickers as Tweety (playing Hopalong Cassidy) points a pop gun at the cat and says, \"Stick 'em up, Geronimo!\" ... only for the gun to blast a real gunshot in the cat's face when the stopper is pulled out (\"Okay, Hoppy, I'm pullin' ya cork!\"). An irritated Sylvester uses his bow and arrow to capture the bird, but seconds before he can consume his prize, Granny shoots a toilet plunger over the cat's mouth (\"You didn't count on Pocahontas, did you, Geronimo?\").In the final gag, Tweety is playing on his new train set in the living room when Sylvester sneaks in with some spare train tracks and sets them up to point the train toward his open mouth, then sets the train in reverse.

When untangled, he runs after his prey,  but when getting near, he discovers Road Runner can travel even faster and he propels himself far away from the Coyote who is left behind astounded by this pace. Wile E. Coyote thinks hard, and tries using several methods:\n1. As the Road Runner speeds at 130 mph across the mountain roads, the coyote fires a bow loaded with some dynamite attached to an arrow. However, it is just like that \u2014 he fires the bow, and the dynamite explodes on himself. The middle portion of the arrow falls off.\n2. The fuming Coyote loads himself onto a slingshot; however, the support breaks out of the ground and wedges him into a cactus.\n3. Wile E. Coyote now tries covering the ground with quick-drying cement to stop the Road Runner.

Dazed, Wile peeks out to inspect the cause, and the manhole cover, and then the boulder, land on his head.\n5. Wile E. Coyote dresses as an attractive, blond hitch hiker holding a sign that says \"Ole Virginy or Bust\" in an attempt to lure the Road Runner, but the clever bird speeds right past him and uncovers the Coyote. The Road Runner returns with Wile E's wig, holding up a sign saying \"I've Already Got a Date\".\n6. Using deception, the Coyote paints a realistic picture of a bridge and places it at the dead-end of a high-level road as displayed by a sign that the Coyote turns around to make the facade convincing. The Road Runner runs through the trick picture as if it was a real road. As the Coyote looks on, puzzled, he fails to see a truck emerging through the road in the painting, which promptly runs him over. Frustrated, the Coyote starts after Road Runner but tears through the painting and falls into the chasm, leaving dust in the air that spells out \"Oh, no!\"\n7. Wile heaves a large boulder onto the winding mountain roads which the Road Runner is traveling. Eventually, the Road Runner and the boulder approach the same area, but the Road Runner slips just out of the way, while the boulder is pitched into the air, up a serac, and onto a new set of roads.

The boulder is approaching from behind, and Wile E. sees it coming but cannot escape fast enough (this gag is set to Wagner's \"Rienzi\" Overture).\n8. The Coyote, hoping for technology to triumph, uses various ACME devices put together (an anvil, a weather balloon, a street cleaner's bin, and a fan) to create a makeshift air balloon. Floating in the clouds, he sees the Road Runner and releases the anvil, causing the balloon to quickly ascend until it stops. At this point, the string keeping it blown up unfurls, sending it flying through the air until it runs out of air.

Soon they are stopped by a group of drifters posing as a posse looking for the gold thieves. Matt persuades the posse's leader Quincey that they've been caught elsewhere. Matt and his men continue on, but the mules bolt from the wagon and the rebels are forced to commandeer a stagecoach carrying a former Union war nurse, Molly Hull, and her companion Lee Kemper. Quincey's posse chases the stage to a station house, capturing one of Matt's men, Cass Browne, who they take with them. Matt and his men take the stage passengers, the aging station agent Plunkett, and his daughter Margaret Harris hostage.\nMrs. Harris hates the Confederates for her husband was killed at the Battle of Gettysburg and her only son was one of the Nevada Volunteers who the Confederates had wiped out. One of the Confederates, Egon, responds that Jaime watched his parents murdered during Sherman's March to the Sea.\nQuincey's posse surrounds the station house, and Matt tells them the gold was left out on the trail, but they are reluctant to go back unless they are sure of it. As night descends, the posse tries to lure the Confederates out by threatening to hang Cass, but Matt is able to rescue him using the remaining sticks of dynamite from their ambush.\nThe following day, Kemper offers Matt a plan of escape in exchange for two gold bars. Giving Matt an Indian token, Kemper explains that his good trading relationship with the local Paiute Indians and this token will guarantee fresh horses and safe passage out of the territory. He also knows by the approaching clouds that a brief torrential rainstorm will soon arrive and supply Matt and his men cover for their escape. Matt agrees to the plan. Later, while Molly in another room, is caring for the seriously wounded Egon, Rolph tries to rape her. An enraged Matt stops him and beats him in a fistfight. When an angry Rolph tries to shoot Matt, young Jamie Groves shoots him dead, and Molly shows her feelings for Matt.\nDuring the night, Quincey and his men have been digging a short tunnel under the station house. Just when they break through and reach a trap door in the floor, Cass stops them from entering. Frustrated, Quincey decides to burn the station house down and orders his men to torch the roof. As the fire burns through the roof, Kemper's predicted thunderstorm arrives. In the confusion, Kemper tries to escape with his two gold bars and is shot dead by the posse. When Cass sneaks outside to scatter the posse's horses, he is also killed. As Matt and Jamie prepare to escape, Molly begs Matt not to take the gold. Outside in the chaos of the storm, Quincey and his men begin shooting at one another. Believing Matt told the truth about the whereabouts of the gold, the surviving members of the posse race each other into the night.\nWith the posse gone, and respecting Molly's wishes, Matt and Jamie surrender the gold to Plunkett. Margaret and Plunkett offer a home to young Jamie, who promises he will return. Matt also promises Molly that he will return to her after he is repatriated in Virginia, and the two embrace.", "tmdb_plot": "In 1865, a troop of Confederate soldiers led by Major Matt Stewart attack the wagon of gold escorted by Union cavalry and the soldiers are killed.

Hans finally returns to his shop, where his teenage assistant, the orphan Peter, begs him to stop causing trouble.\nWhen the children do not arrive at school the next day, the schoolmaster deduces that Hans is again distracting his pupils.

When Niels ridicules lead ballerina Doro's performance, she in turn complains that her shoes need adjusting.\nDoro gives the slippers to Hans, who is immediately smitten with the ballerina. Peter learns that Niels and Doro are a happily married couple, despite their theatrical quarrels. Hans resists the idea and writes a love letter to Doro in the form of a fable called The Little Mermaid, in which he tells her that she has chosen the wrong man. That night while Peter surreptitiously reads the letter, a gust of wind whisks it from his hands and carries it into the theater, where a stage doorman delivers it to Doro.\nThe next day, the entire ballet company sets off on their annual tour, leaving Hans bereft, but he soon finds comfort entertaining a new group of children with his stories.

When not with the children, Hans counts the days by making pair after pair of brightly colored satin slippers for his absent ballerina.\nOne day, Hans receives an invitation from the Gazette newspaper office, where Lars's father, the publisher, thanks Hans for helping his son overcome his difficulties and offers to publish The Ugly Duckling in the newspaper. Overjoyed by the news, Hans asks that his credit be changed from \"Hans, the cobbler\" to \"Hans Christian Andersen\" and runs down the street singing his full name with pride.\nThat evening, when the ballet company returns, Doro tells Hans that they have created a ballet based on his story The Little Mermaid, which Hans believes is a sign of her love for him. The next evening, Peter warns Hans that Doro will humiliate him. Disappointed by his friend's attitude, Hans suggests that they part ways and leaves for the opening of the new ballet. When Hans tries to deliver Doro's slippers backstage, Niels locks the insistent writer in a closet to prevent him from disrupting the performers. While Hans listens to the music and dreams of his story, the performance opens on stage.\nThe morning after the ballet, Doro sends for Hans and discovers that he is in love with her and has misunderstood her relationship with Niels.

He is looking forward to enjoying a quiet retirement at the family shop, looking after his pet hare, Winston, though his spiritualist sister-in-law Ada has had supernatural visions of \"men in black\" bringing discord.\nTheir plans are disrupted by the arrival of Filch, a senior civil servant dressed in a black suit. He announces that he is overseeing work on the Festival of Britain, due to begin in just six weeks. He explains that, due to an error by one of the planners, the Lords' shop and house will have to be demolished to allow an entrance route to be built, assuring them that they will be financially compensated and will be moved to a new house in South Harrow.

However, the Lords are reluctant to leave their house, with Henry demanding \u00a36 million if he is to move; an amount he calculates by Mr Filch's account of the estimate of the monetary value the Festival of Britain will bring.  Filch goes away, hoping either to buy them off eventually or to forcibly evict them.\nFilch has underestimated how attached they are to their property, which is a symbol of security and family to them after their years of hardship during the Great Depression and the Second World War, where they lost a son. In an attempt to halt their eviction, the Lords appeal to a series of politicians, including their councillor, mayor and MP. They are eventually sent to the official in charge of the work, who insists it must go ahead. They are served with eviction notices, and demolition is due to begin in a few days.

Before Bugs can protest, Sam threatens to shoot him. Bugs succeeds in finding the ignition button, and the plane sets off down the runway and flies over a busy traffic intersection.\nRacing toward a skyscraper, Bugs pulls the plane up into outer space, sending Sam falling to the plane's tail.

Jenny wishes to marry engineer David (John Gregson), who is bound for South America for five years, but she cannot leave her father unless her sister or one of her aunts agrees to look after Martin.\nTensions arise after the family assembles.

Jack reveals that he is in love with Algy's cousin, Gwendolen, and Algy reveals that he is in love with Jack's ward, Cecily. Both gentlemen begin to scheme the pursuit of their love. At tea that afternoon, Jack and Gwendolen secretly reveal their love for one another. Gwendolen makes it known that her \u201cideal has always been to love someone by the name of Ernest.\u201d Jack fears she will find out his true identity. Lady Bracknell inquires as to Jack's pedigree. Jack confesses that he does not know who his parents are because, as a baby, he was found in a handbag in a cloakroom at Victoria Station. Lady Bracknell will not allow her daughter \u201c\u2014a girl brought up with the utmost care\u2014to marry into a cloak-room, and form an alliance with a parcel.\u201d\nAt the manor house in the country, Cecily is daydreaming as her governess, Miss Prism, tries to teach her German. Uninvited, Algy arrives from London and assumes the role of Ernest. While Algy and Cecily are getting acquainted with the parlor, Jack arrives in black mourning clothes and informs Miss Prism that his brother, Ernest, is dead. When Algy and Cecily come out to see him, the sad news loses its believability as everyone now thinks Algy is Ernest. In pursuit of Jack, Gwendolen arrives from London and meets Cecily. They both discover that they are engaged to Ernest, not realising one is Jack and one is Algy. When the men arrive in the garden, the confusion is cleared up. The ladies are put off that neither one is engaged to someone named Ernest.\nLady Bracknell arrives, by train. As everyone gathers in the drawing room, Lady Bracknell recognises Miss Prism as her late sister's baby's governess from twenty-eight years before. Miss Prism confesses that she inadvertently left the baby in her handbag at Victoria Station. Jack realised they are talking about him. He retrieves the handbag from his private room and shows Miss Prism. She acknowledges that the bag is hers. Lady Bracknell then tells Jack that he is her late sister's son and the older brother to Algy. Unable to ascertain who his father was, Jack looks in an Army journal, as his father was a general, and realises that his father's name was Ernest.  Thus it becomes apparent that his real name is also Ernest \u2013 as Lady Bracknell says, being the eldest son, he must have been named after his father.\nThe film ends with Jack saying, \u201cI\u2019ve now realised for the first time in my life the vital importance of being earnest.\u201d", "tmdb_plot": "Algernon Moncrieff is surprised to discover that his affluent friend -- whom he knows as \"Ernest\" -- is actually named Jack Worthing.

She tells Kees that within a couple of days Louis will provide Kees with fake papers so he can leave the country.\nKees is suspicious enough to hide the money, in an abandoned car near the tracks, before Louis is able to search his effects.

At knifepoint, Louis phones Michele and asks her to come.  Kees confronts Michele and threatens to prove his worth by killing her\u2014and then he does.

He dotes on her, but Marie takes advantage of him; one night, after staying out all evening, Henri waits for her return and angrily tells her to leave, and though they make up, Henri remains distrustful of Marie. When Marie insults the portrait Henri has made of her, he throws her out and then sinks into alcoholism so deeply that his landlady notifies his mother, who suggests he find Marie to dispel his depression.

She is Myriamme, Jane's friend who, unlike Jane, lives on her own earnings and not the patronage of rich lovers. Myriamme is a great admirer of Henri's paintings, and Henri is shocked to discover that she bought the portrait of Marie Charlet years before in a flea market. She reveals that the key she threw into the water belonged to a wealthy suitor, Marcel de la Voisier, who asked her to be his mistress but not his wife. While Henri continues to bitterly decry true love as an illusion, he falls in love with Myriamme. One night the two see dancer La Goulue on the street, washed-up, drunkenly insisting she was once a star, causing Henri to realize that the Moulin Rouge is now respectable and no longer caters to bohemians and misfits.\nMyriamme informs Henri that Marcel has finally asked her to marry him. Henri, certain she loves the more handsome man, bitingly congratulates her for trapping Marcel. Myriamme asks Henri if he loves her, but, believing that she is only trying to spare his feelings, he lies and tells her he does not. The next day Henri receives a letter from Myriamme telling him that she loves him, not Marcel, but she believes Henri's bitterness over Marie has poisoned any chance for them to be happy together. He rushes to Myriamme's apartment, but she is already gone.\nA year later, drunk in a dive bar, Henri still obsessively reads Myriamme's note. He is carried home, where delirium tremens make him hallucinate cockroaches, and in trying to drive them away, Henri falls down a flight of stairs.

When his friends stand up for him, they too are discharged. As the newly unemployed men are drowning their sorrows in a bar, Steve Brodie (George O'Hanlon) rushes in, claiming to have survived a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge and insisting that Mitchell write an article about it and make him famous. Mitchell tells him he no longer has a newspaper job.\nThen acquaintance Charles A. Leach (Forrest Taylor) tells Mitchell that he had always dreamed of going into journalism. Leach makes a startling proposition: that they become partners and launch a new newspaper. Leach has a printing press, vacant offices and enough money to get started. Mitchell accepts and hires his friends on the spot, including aged but veteran reporter Josiah Davenport (Herbert Heyes) and eager youngster Rusty. He decides to name the newspaper The Globe. When a policeman comes looking for Brodie, Mitchell drags the hiding fugitive out from behind the bar. Now Mitchell has the front-page story for the first issue.\nCharity Hackett (Mary Welch), the young, ruthless publisher of The Star, at first dismisses her new rival, but soon becomes concerned. Mitchell has many revolutionary ideas. Despite The Globe's precarious finances (it is printed on cheap materials at hand, including butcher paper), it instantly becomes very popular for the subjects it fearlessly tackles. When she visits its offices, she encounters Ottmar Mergenthaler, who is busy inventing the Linotype machine to automate the slow, laborious process of setting type by hand. She tries to recruit Mergenthaler for The Star, but fails.\nEventually, Hackett visits Mitchell, working late at the office, and proposes a merger. Mitchell takes her in his arms and kisses her, but rejects her offer. She orders the second-in-command at her publication to cut off supplies of ink and paper to The Globe. He goes further than she had intended: men are beaten up, and Rusty is run over by a heavy wagon. Mitchell confronts Hackett and tells her that Rusty may have to have his legs amputated. He does not believe her when she claims she did not mean for things to go this far, and that she has fired the man responsible.\nWhen Mitchell learns that France's gift of the Statue of Liberty has not been erected because of lack of funds to build a pedestal for it, he launches a public campaign to raise the money, promising to print the names of all the donors. However, he later discovers that con men are collecting money in The Globe's name. The government steps in and orders him to return all the funds.\nMitchell finds out that the fraud was concocted by The Star and writes a scathing article, but finds his press room has been vandalized, with all the type spilled from the cases and glue poured over it. But Mergenthaler declares his machine complete and soon the paper is ready to print. However, at this point a bomb is thrown into the office, destroying the printing press. Devastated by the loss of everything he has built, Mitchell drinks himself to sleep.\nThe next morning, he is puzzled to find his story being read by everyone. Mergenthaler had used his machine to typeset the paper again, and Hackett herself had provided the press and paper to print it while Mitchell's men worked late into the night.

Shortly after arriving, he meets and falls in love with fiery, red-headed Mary Kate Danaher, the sister of bullying Squire \"Red\" Will Danaher. Will also wants to buy the old Thornton property, and is angered when the current owner, the wealthy Widow Tillane, accepts Sean's bid instead of his. Will then retaliates by refusing consent for Sean to marry his sister.\nSome village residents, including Father Peter Lonergan and local matchmaker-cum-bookmaker Michaeleen \u00d3ge Flynn,  trick Will Danaher into believing that Widow Tillane will marry him if Mary Kate is no longer under his roof. He gleefully allows the marriage, but is furious upon discovering the deceit and refuses to give Mary Kate her dowry. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry is a matter of pride and represents her personal value within the community and her independence. She insists the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing her and Sean to become estranged. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate's furniture, but Will withholds the monetary portion of the dowry.\nMary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will. Sean goes to the local Protestant minister and fellow former boxer, Rev. Cyril Playfair. Sean reveals he gave up boxing after accidentally killing a younger, married opponent in the ring. Mary Kate also confesses (in Irish Gaelic) her part in the quarrel to Father Lonergan, who berates her for being selfish. Mary Kate and Sean partially reconcile and share the bedroom for the first time since their marriage.\nHowever, early the next morning, Mary Kate leaves the cottage and boards a train for Dublin, hoping the pretense of leaving will spur Sean to action. Sean soon learns from Michaeleen where she is and races on horseback to the train station where he pulls her off the train. Followed by a growing crowd of villagers, Sean forces Mary Kate to walk with him the five miles (8 km) to the Danaher farm. There, Sean confronts Will and demands the dower-money. When Will refuses, Sean throws Mary Kate back at her brother, declaring he will abide by the Irish custom of \"no fortune, no marriage\". The ultimatum shocks both Mary Kate and Will, who finally pays the \u00a3350 (over \u00a317,000 in 2022). Sean immediately burns it in the boiler, abetted by Mary Kate, who proves it was about her pride and not money. She proudly leaves for home, but a humiliated Will takes a swing at Sean, only to be knocked down by Sean's defensive counter-punch.\nA donnybrook ensues, then evolves into a long Homeric fistfight between Sean and Will after they insincerely agree to adhere to the Marquess of Queensberry rules. This much-anticipated match attracts more and more spectators as it continues for miles across the landscape. The fighters finally pause for a drink inside Cohan's Bar, where they begrudgingly admit a mutual respect for one another. As they argue over who will pay for the drinks, Will tosses a brew into Sean's face. Sean punches Will, sending him crashing through the bar doors to lie unconscious in the street, ending the fight.

Nevertheless, the ship heaves off and they begin to head back while the father scans the lands around him for a scarlet flower.\nA storm strikes and the father is washed overboard.  He wakes up on a strange island which is full of all sorts of wonders.  He explores, and eventually finds a flower just like the one Nastenka described.  The instant that he plucks it, however, a great storm comes upon him and the owner of the island \u2013 a hideous monster \u2013 makes his presence known.  He tells the father that he will let him keep the flower, but in return he must send one of his daughters to live with him.  The father refuses, and the monster gives him a ring, telling him that whoever puts it on will be teleported back to the island, and that if his daughter doesn't come then he himself must come and be killed.\nIn the morning, the crewmembers of the father's ship (who had been searching for him) see him on the island and rescue him.  Back home, the father prepares to put on the ring and meet his fate.  However, Nastenka overhears a conversation where he reveals this to his friend when asking the friend to take care of his daughters once he had died, and she secretly puts on the ring herself.\nThere, she expects to be killed but instead finds herself on a beautiful island and welcomed for by a kind, unseen host.  She accidentally catches a glimpse of him eventually, and is mortally scared at first.  He allows her to go home to visit her family, but tells her that she must come back by putting on the ring by 8pm or he will die of loneliness.\nNastenka comes home dressed in splendid clothes and with presents for her sisters.  Her sisters, however, become jealous that she lives in a magnificent palace with untold wealth, and secretly turn all of the clocks in the house back one hour.  Nastenka looks outside and hears the clock chiming 8pm, and quickly goes back, only to find the monster near death.  She is very saddened and vows to never leave him again, and with those words the scarlet flower which she holds reattaches itself to its original stem and the island fills with light again.

Don barely tolerates his spoiled and conniving costar Lina Lamont, though their studio, Monumental Pictures, links them romantically to increase their popularity. Lina is convinced that they truly are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise.\nAt the premiere of their latest film, The Royal Rascal, Don tells the gathered crowd a version of his life story, including his motto: \"Dignity, always dignity.\" His words are humorously contradicted by flashbacks showing him alongside his best friend Cosmo Brown (\"Fit as a Fiddle\"). To escape from his fans after the premiere, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden. Because of his shabby look thanks to being manhandled by the fans, she thinks him a vagrant trying to rob her, but Don's identity is proven by a policeman Kathy tries to get help from. She drops him off at where he needs to go but not before claiming to be a stage actress and sneering at his \"undignified\" accomplishments as a movie star.\nLater, at an after-party, the head of Don's studio, R.F. Simpson, shows a short demonstration of a talking picture, but his guests are unimpressed, claiming it will never amount to anything. Cosmo however warns, \"That's what they said about the horseless carriage.\" To Don's amusement, Kathy pops out of a mock cake right in front of him, revealing herself to be a chorus girl (\"All I Do is Dream of You\"). Furious at Don's teasing, she throws a cake at him, accidentally hitting Lina in the face when Don ducks, and then flees. Don becomes smitten with Kathy and searches for her for weeks, with Cosmo trying to cheer him up (\"Make 'Em Laugh\"). While filming a romantic scene, a jealous Lina reveals that her influence is behind Kathy's loss of work and subsequent disappearance. On the studio lot, Cosmo finally finds Kathy quietly working in another Monumental Pictures production (\"Beautiful Girl\"). Don sings her a love song, and she confesses to having been a fan of his all along (\"You Were Meant for Me\").\nAfter rival studio Warner Bros. has an enormous hit with its first talking picture, the 1927 film The Jazz Singer, R.F. decides he has no choice but to convert the next Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, including the actors being unfamiliar with the recording technology used and Lina's grating voice and strong Brooklyn accent, driving poor director Roscoe Dexter to tears. An exasperated diction coach tries to teach her how to speak properly, but to no avail. In contrast, Don fares far better when taking diction lessons (\"Moses Supposes\"). The Dueling Cavalier's preview screening is a disaster; the actors are barely audible thanks to the awkward placing of the microphones, Don repeats the line \"I love you\" to Lina over and over, to the audience's derisive laughter, and in the middle of the film, the sound goes out of synchronization, with hilarious results as Lina shakes her head while the villain's deep voice says, \"Yes! Yes! Yes!\" and the villain nods his head while Lina's squeaky soprano says, \"No! No! No!\"\nAfterward (\"Good Morning\"), Kathy and Cosmo help Don come up with the idea to turn The Dueling Cavalier into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier, complete with a modern musical number and backstory. The three are disheartened when they realize Lina's terrible voice remains a problem. Still, Cosmo, inspired by the scene in The Dueling Cavalier where Lina's voice was out of sync, suggests that they dub Lina's voice with Kathy's (\"Singin' in the Rain\"). After hearing Don and Cosmo pitch the idea (\"Broadway Melody\"), R.F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina that Kathy is doing the dubbing.  Having learned the truth, an infuriated Lina barges in on a dubbing session, and becomes even angrier when she is told that Don and Kathy are in love and intend to marry, and that R.F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup. Lina threatens to sue R.F. unless he makes sure no one ever hears of Kathy and that she keeps dubbing for the rest of her career. R.F. reluctantly agrees because of a clause in Lina's contract which holds the studio responsible for positive media coverage.\nThe premiere of The Dancing Cavalier is a tremendous success (\"Would You\"). When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don, Cosmo, and R.F. tell her to lip sync into a microphone while Kathy, concealed behind the curtain, sings into a second one. While Lina is \"singing\" (\"Singin' in the Rain Reprise\"), Don, Cosmo and R.F. gleefully open the curtain, revealing the fakery. The defeated Lina flees in humiliation, and a distressed Kathy tries to run away as well, but Don proudly announces to the audience that she's \"the real star\" of the film (\"You Are My Lucky Star\").

Whitney is named recruit company commander after saving Mary Kate from drowning during swim training. Whitney and Una adapt well to the rigors of boot camp; Mary Kate does not, suffering from severe homesickness to the point she winds up facing an elimination board which can discharge her from the Navy for inadaptability. While Whitney advocates for her, Mary Kate's former fiance shows up and tries to convince her that she will be better with him than in the Navy.  She becomes angry, and goes before the board and convinces them to allow her to continue in the Navy.\nGranted a pass midway through their training, the trio go to Chicago looking for a good time. They learn to their displeasure that while the sailors have no trouble meeting girls, it is harder for the WAVES to meet guys. On the advice of a waiter, Una and Whitney go to a newly-coed bar in a downtown hotel, where Whitney picks up a man a year or two older. Unbeknownst to her, he is the newly assigned doctor of the WAVE training battalion in civvies. They have a cordial dinner, with an ending spoiled by three WACs.

Her bacon is saved by the testimony of LT Dr. Paul Elliot, her date from the night before, who after the board dismisses her without disciplinary action rebukes her for her behavior.\nOn the way back to her barracks, Whitney passes the base swimming pool, where a young brother and sister are arguing. She takes them in hand, and the three of them spend a happy hour swimming, diving, and playing in the pool.

Una asks Dr. Elliot to dance, and tries to maneuver him to where Whitney is standing. He resists, and Whitney leaves the dance. Her big night finishes with her dancing with Pops, the civilian plumber who spends his time trying to keep the barracks plumbing from being clogged by half-eaten all day suckers.\nStill attracted to Dr. Elliot, Whitney trails him to a moviehouse one Saturday night. The two of them hold a whispered, intense discussion about their characters, with Elliot throwing Whitney's history of 12 engagements in her face and her ripping him for his air of superiority in social matters. She storms out of the theater, and a crusty Navy captain whose medals are headed up by the Navy Cross and the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, who had overheard their argument, tells Elliot that he'd be a damned fool to let that one get away.

Rogers.\nWill joins a Wild West show and tours the world, then meets up with Betty at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair and proposes to her. After they are married, they combine their honeymoon with one of Will's rodeo tours, which ends in New York's Madison Square Garden. There he becomes a hero by lassoing a dangerous bull that gets loose during a performance. The newspaper coverage draws the attention of Bert Lynn, who runs a talent agency. He talks the reluctant Rogers into performing in vaudeville, but his rodeo act does not interest the audience. After six months of unemployment and with a baby due soon, Will goes on stage as a last-minute replacement and is forced to do his act alone, without his horse. After some rope tricks flop, he resorts to talking to the audience; his down-home comedy chatter is a big hit. This wins him a place in the Ziegfeld Follies; he becomes one of its star attractions. He adds political commentary to his act and becomes famous as a \"cowboy philosopher\" known for witty remarks about politicians and issues of the day.\nLater, Will goes to Hollywood to work in films, meets and befriends aviator and fellow Oklahoman Wiley Post. He becomes a strong proponent of aviation. He goes on a European tour, meeting and amusing heads of state.\nAfter the Great Depression strikes, Will works long hours flying around the country to perform benefit shows lifting the spirits of the American people and raising funds for the poor. At the 1932 Democratic National Convention, Will is nominated as a presidential candidate as a \"favorite son.\"\nLater, Will takes off with Wiley to Alaska.

However, Drake, is only interested in inquiring about the murder.\nDrake immediately accuses her of hating the deceased and drawing her \"little pistol\" out of her bag (the gun is a revolver with a very long barrel but somehow fits inside a change purse), pointing it at him and slowly squeezing the trigger, tighter and tighter and tighter...until six rounds plug Drake right in the face. At first the bullets appear to have decapitated him until his head sticks out from his jacket with his beak full of holes and proclaims loudly \"Not so TIGHT!\" He then elaborates (after she hikes up her skirt to reveal her long curvaceous legs, turns the lights out and plants numerous kisses on him) how 'Shapely Lady Duck' grabbed the deer rifle off the wall, prompting the man (having apparently survived the pistol shots) to run screaming from the room then letting him have it when he tries to sneak out. Drake is shot multiple times while mimicking a game dummy so that the scoreboard goes from 5 to 200 before eventually saying \"Pretty good shooting, sister\".\nThe woman insists that he searches her and kisses him on the lips two more times. Amazingly, the target is still alive and kicking so the next scene involves her crushing him with a grand piano suspended from the ceiling. Drake predictably ends up on the receiving end of this reenactment after startling the woman into releasing the rope holding up the piano, which falls and crushes him through the floor, leaving him with piano keys for teeth. Even though the victim has been shot twice and squished by a piano, he is still defiantly clinging on to life, with the love struck duck getting another chance to kiss him on the cheek. This results in a last desperate attempt to kill him by moving nearby train tracks to the front door because the victim always watched the 5:15 express go past every day.

He gets the idea that because Frisky has not eaten his dinner yet, he can eat the dog's food. Sneaking over to the dog's food dish (the end of his tail is shown as a devil's pitchfork to represent the devilish idea he has), he arrives at the dog dish and is about to take a bite when Frisky sneaks up behind him and barks. Claude is seen flying upward out of the scene. A moment later, we see him with his claws stuck into the ceiling, shaking like a leaf. Frisky downs his dinner in a flash of a second and runs off. Claude becomes disgusted with the dog and begins murmuring while looking at the audience.\nFrisky is seen running through the hallway where he sees his ball, and pounces on it causing it to roll under the carpet. He goes after the ball by crawling under the carpet, but he is not quite sure where it is, so he takes a sniff, bites down on the ball and comes out from under the carpet, the ball held tightly in his teeth. He throws the ball up into the air and tries to catch it in his teeth as it falls back to the floor but he misses, and his empty jaws snap shut. He throws the ball up in the air again, but this time it does not come down right after. As he is trying to figure out where the ball is, it drops out of the air and hits him on the head. He gets scared and scampers off behind a wall, yelping all the way. Angrily, he jumps out at the ball and barks at it and walks away, but has to stop for a moment, as he has to scratch. A flea falls to the floor as he looks down at it and gives it a sniff. It jumps at him and he yelps, but as he walks away, the flea jumps back into his fur and he begins scratching again. Frisky's mistress (Bea Benaderet) notices him scratching away and says, \"So, Mr. Frisky - I see YOU need a bath! Well, there's no time like the present.\"\nAs his mistress carries him, they pass Claude who is watching and sticks out his tongue at Frisky. Frisky escapes and his mistress yells, \"Frisky, you come back here this minute!\" Frisky hides under the couch, and Claude goes over to the couch skirt and lifts it up with his hind leg as the mistress asks herself, \"Where is that dog?  Oh there you are, you naughty thing!\" and carries him back to the wash tub. We see her pouring boiling hot water into the wash tub when the phone rings. She says, \"Oh dear, that phone again!  Now you stay right there till I get back!\" Frisky is backed into a corner and cannot escape. As Claude tests the water to see how hot it is, Frisky sneaks up behind him and lets out a loud bark. This scares Claude and again he is seen leaping upward out of the scene, and as he falls, he lands in the tub of hot water.\nMad at the dog for scaring him, Claude picks up a pail and fills it with the hot water, and runs through the house after Frisky. He pauses for a moment when he cannot find the puppy, but Frisky sees him and barks loudly again, sending Claude and the hot water bucket hurtling toward the ceiling. Claude lets go of the ceiling, and you know that they say - cats always land on their feet, and just as he is about to hit the floor, he stops in mid-air, the bucket turns upside down and he lands normally on all fours. What is left of the hot water in the bucket empties out on to the floor, and he walks on with the bucket hanging over his body.\nFrisky is outside now, and Claude sneaks behind a tree to spy on him. It happens to be the same tree that Frisky is behind, but he does not notice. Frisky lets out a loud bark, sending Claude sailing through the air, and he lands in a watering can. Back inside, Frisky is chewing on part of the carpet and Claude is seen with a bone attached to the line of a fishing rod. He casts the bone to Frisky, but he lets go of the bone and the hook ends up hooking the rim of the fish bowl. It lands on a pillow on the floor and as Claude reels it in, he thinks Frisky is at the end of it and he leaps from behind the wall to scare him, landing with a splash into the fish bowl.\nNow Claude is really angry. He sharpens an ax and runs through the house like an ax-wielding maniac. Frisky watches from the upstairs hallway and Claude notices. Claude runs up the stairs toward Frisky, but Frisky sneaks up behind Claude and lets out a loud bark, sending Claude and the ax skyward. Holding onto the ax which is stuck in the ceiling, the handle comes out of the ax, and Claude lands on and starts sliding down the banister. He lands on a roller skate, which sends him wheeling through the house at breakneck speed. As he holds on for dear life, he craftily avoids any furniture in the way and in a chain reaction, he gets shot out the front door and into a children's wagon at such speed, the wagon starts rolling and then hits a brick wall, sending him sailing through the neighbor's upstairs window, freaking out the lady of the house who lets out a blood-curdling scream. She kicks him back out the window and he lands in a rain barrel at the bottom of a downspout. Frisky notices Claude in the barrel and lets out a bark, sending him airborne again. This time Claude has nothing to hold on to, and he falls into the chimney on the way down, clumsily landing on some fire logs which roll across the room. He grabs on to a water dispenser, and he and the logs and the water dispenser fall down the basement stairs with a crash. Claude comes back up the stairs, but he is inside the water bottle; only his feet are outside the lip of the bottle. Frisky reappears and barks at Claude, sending him shooting toward the ceiling again. As he hits the ceiling, the glass water bottle smashes open and what is left of the water falls toward the floor, sending a frightened Frisky out of the scene.\nClaude chases Frisky outside again and into a laundry truck. Frisky gets caught in a sweater, but before he can get away, Claude latches on to the sweater with a claw and Frisky runs away, leaving a trail of wool string. Claude ties the string to the truck (thinking that when the truck takes off, it will take Frisky with it) and he follows the string to where he believes Frisky will be when he gets to the end. The string is everywhere - through the banister rails, in and out two mouse holes, through the handles of a vase, in and out of a kettle, through the hot and cold water taps, and into a tipped over trash can. Claude investigates the trash can, but Frisky is nowhere to be found. As Claude grabs the end of the string, the truck's engine starts and it drives off, sending him back the way he came through all of the objects, all the while holding onto the string! (at this point you have to ask yourself, why he did not just let go of the string?) As he exits the house, he is hurtled into the air and lands on a swimming pool diving board in a neighboring yard. As he bounces up in the air, he holds his nose as if he is going to plunge into the water, and as he falls, we see there is no water in the pool and he lands with a thud at the bottom of the dry pool, cracking the cement.

The village council, however, are eager to put him out of the way before the Prime Minister arrives. When Dan leaves the pub without paying his bill, the landlord and councillor Eric Hace reports Dan to the village's only policeman, Police Constable Tumball, who arrests Dan. Sir Digby Montague, the head of the council and one of the local magistrates, plans to sentence him to a week in gaol.\nWhen Sir Digby finds that his maid Sally, who is Dan's granddaughter, has been giving Dan Sir Digby's leftovers for dinner regularly, he promptly sacks her. The official reason that all get in trouble is theft of a fork.\nMiss Mouncey, another councillor, comes up with the idea that Dan should be sent to live in one of the almshouses, which have been empty for 50 years. Vicar Reverend Simpson informs the Crouches, the custodians, that the regulations are to be strictly enforced, even though they are 400 years old. Among other things, the rules dictate that he be washed by the matron every night and wear a uniform  in the manner of a Chelsea Pensioner. When Dan returns drunk the next night, he is put in stocks.

He discovers that the rents for the extensive lands indicated on a map are supposed to go to the upkeep of the almshouses, with any remainder distributed between the inmates daily.

Dan rushes back to the almshouse just in time.\nBill Jordan goes out on a date with Peggy Stebbins and, at her insistence, kisses her. Then he quickly drives over to Sally's lodgings and, without a word, kisses her, but when he admits Peggy put the idea into his head, Sally becomes annoyed and slams the door on him.\nWith the council elections coming up, Mr. Spink, who owns the local factory, suggests that Dan run for office. Dan is uninterested at first, but soon decides he will, and he is joined by Bill Jordan, Spink and Mary Wade, the shopkeeper who now employs Sally. Hace comes up with a scheme to make Dan look foolish by recruiting 11 tramps for the almshouse, but Soater cites a regulation that the additions must be approved by the residents, and Dan rejects them.\nThe new candidates are all elected, displacing the previous councillors. Sally is overjoyed and kisses Bill. Dan rushes back to the almshouse at 9.00, where he exacts revenge on the Crouches and then heads back to the festivities.

From this point, the film follows a series of vignettes showing Goofy's many travel problems, all accompanied by sarcastic comments from the narrator. The first problem Goofy faces is getting stuck behind a white slow-moving travel trailer pulled by a yellow car that he can't seem to pass. The same trailer continues to follow Goofy, yet always remains one step ahead of him and causes most of his problems.\nThe first time Goofy tried to pass it, a milk bottle falls off the trailer's platform and damages his car's tire and motor and is forced to go to a workshop to get it fixed. The owner digs through the car's engine, throwing out random parts until he takes out the motor and claims that he needs a new one before throwing it into a trunk. After the motor is fixed, Goofy pays the owner, but the workshop then closes for two weeks before Goofy can ask him to fix the tire and is forced to do it himself. The trailer comes by while he's working.

Goofy passes a traffic light which is on \"stop\". He managed to stop a few distances behind it and quickly goes back in front of it. While waiting, a rain cloud shows up and pours water over Goofy's car. At the same time, the traffic light switches to \"go\" and the trailer passes him. In response, Goofy tries to pass it a second time, but dust is swept out the trailer's door, clouding Goofy's sight. This also causes him to drive off the road and into a tree, allowing the trailer to pass him again. It was then nighttime and Goofy tries to find a place to sleep. He comes across a sign and after striking a match in an unsuccessful attempt to read the sign, he lifts his car with a carjack to shine it's headlights on the sign so he can read it. The signs points out that there are hotels further down the road and further back the way he came. He then chooses to turn around and notices that all hotels have no vacancy except one. However, his car runs out of gas before he can reach it and worst of all, the trailer has taken the extra spot in the hotel. Goofy pushes his car to a gas station, but it suddenly rolls down a hill, leading him to a hotel that has a beautiful designed house which reveals to be a fake display in front of a plain cabin. He stays there for the night, but was forced to leave when a train wakes him up. A really tired Goofy travels through the night, being stunned by passing cars along the way. He once again encounters the trailer and can see people partying inside of it and is nearly hit by a truck when he tries to pass it again. He is finally able to pass the trailer by driving on a cliff wall, but when he yells at the driver, he is alarmed to see no one driving the car.

Flagg realizes Quirt's value in battle and takes him to the front lines.\nAt the front, Flagg's attempts to capture a live German officer lead to the death of Lieutenant Moore, after which a wounded Aldrich goads Flagg and Quirt in attempting to capture the officer themselves. On their way behind enemy lines, they both realize they love Charmaine, which once again re-heats their rivalry.  The two do manage to capture a German colonel, but as they are bringing him back to the American lines, they are hit by a German barrage, killing the colonel and wounding Quirt. Quirt taunts Flagg with the fact that he will be going back to the village first, giving him the first shot at Charmaine. Right after he leaves for the base hospital in the village, Lewisohn brings a German lieutenant he has captured to Flagg.  The joy is short-lived however, as Lewisohn is almost immediately killed by a German barrage after handing his prisoner over.\nFlagg calls Cokely to tell him of the officer's capture, only to have Cokely renege on his pledge to withdraw Flagg's company from the front.  As Flagg leads his Marines deeper into enemy territory, Quirt begins to woo Charmaine.  Before the two can marry, Flagg returns from the front, confesses to her that he is not married, and proposes to her.  Charmaine cannot decide between the two men, leading to a fight between them.  The two decide to play cards for the right to marry Charmaine.  Flagg wins, after bluffing Quirt, but before he can marry Charmaine, Sergeants Lipinsky and Kiper arrive and let Flagg know they have been ordered back to the front.  After initially balking at the order, Flagg realizes he cannot desert his men.\nAs the Marines move out, Flagg tells Kiper that he has been discharged, and that he has kept the discharge hidden from him for over a year.  Rather than become angry, Kiper slings his weapon over his shoulder and joins the Marines marching out.  Quirt, meanwhile, can stay behind, due to his injury, but he also picks up his rifle and joins his company.", "tmdb_plot": "Two military men, Captain Flagg and Sergeant Quirt, who are rivals to begin with, grow more at odds with each other when Quirt is made Flagg's top sergeant.

Halligan is a Catholic Priest visiting Rome for the 1950 Holy Year.  On the long voyage from New York City to Genoa, he makes friends with his cabin mate, Joe Brewster. Unknown to Halligan, Brewster is a career criminal wanted by American authorities; he faces a life sentence.\nThe ship docks in Genoa. When he sees police waiting, Brewster steals Halligan's clothing, cassock, hat and passport in order to evade arrest. Two priests appear to welcome  \u201cFather Halligan\u201d. When Halligan disembarks, wearing Brewster\u2019s flamboyant clothes, he is arrested. The Genoa Commissario of Police believes his story when he chants a portion of the Mass.\nMeanwhile, Brewster makes friends with an Irish priest and ends up staying with him in Rome, at the Monastery of the Three Saints. At a concert, he remembers his days as a choir boy.\nNow dressed in borrowed clothes, Halligan reluctantly promises to aid the police. In Rome, he meets the cynical Commissario of Police. On the way to headquarters they stop for a procession. Halligan sees Brewster in it and says nothing. The Commissario tells Halligan that he will meet him the next morning at the Monastery of the Three Angels, where he is registered. Halligan, who actually has no place to stay, realizes that this must be Brewster and finds him there. Brewster asks for just one day. Halligan agrees\u2014and prays for guidance. Once he is gone, Brewster follows suit.\nThe detective shadowing Halligan for his protection invites him home to supper, but they hear sirens. The Monastery of the Three Saints is on fire. Halligan runs back to rescue Brewster, who is fine. A beam falls, and he rescues Father Halligan. They clean up in the fountain of Trevi, then go to the deserted Coliseum, where Halligan asks why Brewster needs the whole day. Brewster wants to earn the total indulgence proclaimed by the Pope for the 1950 Holy Year. He starts by making his first confession in 20 years to Halligan. The two then make their way to the sites, with Halligan \u2014and the audience\u2014learning more and more about Brewster.\nHalligan is still debating what to do when police see them. He helps Brewster evade arrest by ducking through an ancient door into a cloister where monks are working in the garden. In this order, the men remain enclosed for life and never talk to anyone except a superior. They are atoning for their own sins and the sins of the world. Brewster finds himself drawn to the place during his brief visit: \u201cWhere I was, you could feel the hate in the air, but here...\u201c As they leave, the abbot writes a note apologizing for everyone staring at them, but the iron latch that opened so easily for them has been corroded shut for 100 years.\nHalligan and Brewster head to the train station while the streets fill with police. Once there, they become separated, and the Commissario finds Halligan. When he insists that Brewster is on a pilgrimage, the Commissario goes to the last stop, St. Peters, where they take him into custody and send him off in a van. Halligan, miserable at having inadvertently betrayed his friend, is convinced that the man is reformed: Then the news comes that Brewster has somehow escaped, which leaves Halligan unsure of himself and his judgement.\nRetracing his steps, Halligan returns to the monastery. To his surprise, Brewster is there, wearing monk\u2019s robes. He asks the abbot: Did Brewster tell him his whole story? Is he a worthy penitent? The abbot nods. Brewster writes to Halligan: prison was all past and no future, and this place is all future and no past. He asks when the next Holy Year will be. Halligan answers: in 25 years, and promises to visit then. A bell sounds, and they shake hands. Brewster steps back into the cloister and bolts the gate.

Her father does not have a very good opinion of Alex because he is more interested in baseball than in farming. He is worried for his daughter's future.\nThe game between the farmers and the team is a betting place. Many come to see this game and they know that with Alex pitching they can't lose. Alex strikes out everyone in this game. When he wins the game he returns home.\nAimee is at home waiting for Alex. Aimee's father offers to put a down payment on a farm for his daughter. After a small argument Aimee switches to her father's side and promises that Alex will not play baseball.\nNow we go forward to a Church meeting where an invited guest was to show film shots of his recent journey to Norway. As he begins his presentation the first film is upside down and way out of focus. He begins to speak about that film once it has been fixed to the screen when a noise is heard. It is the sound of a backfiring automobile. The car drives up to the front door of the chapel. The driver gets out and opens the door which causes the light from outside to blur out the picture on the screen. Then the driver announces that he is looking for Alex. After walking from the back of the chapel to the front, he finally sees Alex and asks him to come outside with him, where he asks Alex if he can really pitch like he did at the earlier game or was it a fluke.\nThe next scene shows Alex pitching to this driver who is the manager of the team he beat. Aimee is shown inside and listening to the presentation which is now interrupted by the sound of a ball hitting a glove over and over again. Alex is offered fifty dollars a month if he will consider playing for his team. Alex agrees to play and is shown playing baseball with the new team, the Galesburg Boosters. He sends a baseball card with his picture along with money on a regular basis so he can buy the farm for him and his fianc\u00e9e.\nDuring one of the games Alex gets on base after being walked. When the next batter makes a hit Alex runs toward second base. The second baseman catches the ball to get Alex out and then throws the ball to first base but it hits Alex in the head. He wakes up three days later in the hospital with Aimee and his mother by his side. The injury ends his 1909 season of baseball.\nDuring the off season between 1909 and 1910 he now has enough money to buy that farm and to marry Aimee. After arriving at the farm he goes out back while his wife is changing and starts chucking mud balls at a fence. His eyes are out of whack and he sees everything in double. He hires a catcher to catch for him and he is always just a bit off because of his eyesight.\nIn 1910 he returns to baseball after he wakes up one morning and his eyes are perfect again.  His record during that year is 29-11 playing for the Syracuse Stars in the class B New York State League. Then he is sold to the Philadelphia Phillies for 750 dollars.\nThe scene turns to what Doris Day is known for. The scene is a Christmas at the farm where the family is gathered around and Aimee sings. The movie returns to baseball.\nThe first game with the Phillies is the 1911 City Series. He throws five innings of no-hit, no-run baseball.  His official Major League baseball debut is on April 15 of that year. During one game he is facing Rogers Hornsby. The catcher passes on a tidbit of info that if Hornsby strikes out he will be booted off the team. Alex tells the catcher what the next pitches will be and Hornsby is able to connect with one of them.\nAlex spends most of 1918 in France as a Sergeant with a Field Artillery unit where he is exposed to mustard gas, and a shell that explodes near him causes partial hearing loss as well as epileptic seizures. He has also developed a drinking problem. He returns to the states and continues pitching in 1919.\nHe is traded from Philadelphia to Chicago and pitches for the Cubs during the 1920 season where he wins the pitching triple crown. While playing a Game at Forbes Field his hearing problem returns.  In the sixth inning while on the mound, Alex falls down and his teammates carry him off the field.  It turns out to be an epileptic seizure.\nAlex's doctor tells him that if he wants to live he should probably go back to farm life. Alex will not hear of that. He tells the doctor that he really does not want his wife Aimee to know.\nAs Alex is walking down the street, he passes a bar and the doorman recognizes him and invites him in for a drink \"on the house.\" He becomes totally inebriated. As he lays his head down into his arm a customer is seen walking to a telephone booth. He asks for the sports desk and tells the person who answers that he knows why Alex fell at the ballgame today: \"He's a lush.\" The papers are filled with stories of the drinking problems of Alex. The scene changes to a baseball game where Alex fields a ball and basically throws it away to the first basemen. He is removed from the game.\nAlex is next shown where drinking seems to be his new pastime. He is shown stumbling down an alley and then falls as he reaches the end. He is removed from the Cubs and sent to a team playing for the House of David. All this time his wife is trying to find him because she lost track of where he was.\nAimee is finally told where \"Alexander the Great\" is. He is now a main headliner at a circus. He is touted as the man who can answer all your questions about baseball - and specifically about pitching. Aimee buys a ticket, but when he comes out from the rear of the tent she hides. He spews out many facts and figures about his own career and then asks if anyone has any questions. Aimee leaves without contacting him.\nWhen Aimee does get in touch with him she tells him that she knows of his medical conditions. He is contacted by his old friend Rogers Hornsby, at the request of Aimee, and is offered a pitching job with the St. Louis Cardinals.\nWe are now taken to the World Series of 1926 when the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees are squaring off. Alex pitches the second and the sixth games of the series and they win both of them. At the conclusion of the sixth game Alex and Aimee have a conversation in the tunnel of the stadium. It is here when she learns that he looks to her for strength while pitching during this season. He also tells her that she looks tired because he has relied on her so much.\nThe Cardinals tie up the series at 3-3. It is now the seventh game. Aimee is not at the stadium because she is packing their stuff for a vacation that will start as soon as the game is over. Alex is not expected to pitch today at all. It is a close game. They are at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis and in the seventh inning the pitcher of record has allowed the bases to be loaded. Player-manager Rogers Hornsby pulls the pitcher. He gets a message to the bullpen for Alex to come out and pitch them out of the mess. When Alex gets to the mound he looks and finds that Aimee is not there.

Don Carlos ultimately lives, and Rosario refuses to go with Julio, unable to separate Carlitos from his father, who had grown close since his illness.\nThe film skips about 20 years into the future, where Carlos, and his younger brother, Miguel (not introduced in the first part of the film), have graduated from medical school. One day, news arrives that Julio Mistral has died and decided to will all of his money to Miguel. Initially, everybody is perplexed at this action, as Julio had never met Miguel.\nThough it is not explicitly stated in the film, Carlos soon pieces together that Miguel was willed this money because he is the illegitimate child of Julio and his mother, Rosario. Carlos refuses Miguel's offer to share his inheritance, which he uses to build a new clinic, and begins acting bitter towards his mother and brother. Miguel becomes engaged to be married to a woman who Carlos is convinced wants to marry him for his money. At his wedding, Don Carlos collapses and dies from a heart attack.\nThe film comes to a conclusion as Carlos finally discloses the truth about the inheritance to Miguel, who becomes very angry and fights Carlos. Rosario breaks up the fight, and confirms what Carlos has said. Miguel is distraught, and Rosario unapologetically tells them that Julio was the only man she ever loved. The brothers reconcile their differences at the sight of their emotional mother, wrought with sadness. Carlos leaves for the tropics to do research, and the film ends with Rosario placing a picture of Julio on her mantelpiece.", "tmdb_plot": "After indulging in an affair with a man (a friend of the family) she truly loves, a woman returns to her young son and husband for good, and loses contact with the man.

Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link (George Mathews), who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another.\nOnce the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link.\nWithin days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies.\nLink is drunk and reported missing from his duty, and when Farragut searches the island's jungle for him, he is captured by natives. They bring Farragut to Portuguese countess Margarita La Raguna (Suzan Ball), who is in hiding. She insists at gunpoint that he take her back to the ship, but once there, she hides the pistol, causing Porter to scoff at Farragut's claim that he was forced to bring her. Margarita reveals that she and her countrymen now live in Rio de Janeiro and wish to use their gold to establish a trade route between Brazil and England. However, the newly reinstated Portuguese king has demanded that his subjects and their riches return to Portugal and abducted her ship while it was en route to England. Her father was killed and the sailing instructions for the Brazilian fleet were stolen, and she needs passage to Brazil to warn the fleet. Porter, as captivated by Margarita's beauty as is Farragut, agrees to take her on board, and as the days pass, the two men vie for her attention.\nOne day, a Portuguese ship appears. Porter waits until the last possible moment to fly the pirate flag but is shocked when the Portuguese captain, Poulini, responds in a friendly manner. However, Margarita is furious to learn they are pirates because the Caribbean pirates, led by Scarjack, are working together with the Portuguese and the corrupt island governor, Count Domingo Del Prado, to steal her people's gold. Porter decides to return Margarita to the islands for her protection, and when she begs Farragut to try to change the captain's mind, Farragut agrees and gives her his medallion as a good luck piece.\nAs they near the island, Margarita overhears Porter and Farragut discussing their camouflage strategy and, assuming they are in league with Del Prado, jumps off the ship and swims ashore. She is immediately captured, as is Farragut when he takes a crew to the island for more supplies. Brought before Del Prado, Margarita denounces Farragut as a pirate and throws down his medallion. Immediately recognizing it as American, Del Prado imprisons them all and tortures Farragut to reveal the ship's plans.\nBack on the ship, Link urges Porter to rescue Farragut, and although he risks being court-martialed for defying his orders, Porter finally agrees. The whole crew infiltrates the island and, disguised as Del Prado's soldiers, attack the dungeon. After freeing Farragut and Margarita, Porter overpowers Del Prado in a sword fight and brings him back to the ship.

Churches in Lisbon and the rest of Portugal are boarded up. Many priests, nuns, monks and friars are shown being fingerprinted, photographed and registered as possible criminals before being jailed. The rural town of F\u00e1tima is small enough to have escaped much of this persecution; their church remains open, and most of the people are reasonably devout.Watching their flocks and playing in a field outside town on May 15 (the actual date of the first apparition was May 13), L\u00facia Santos (Susan Whitney) and her cousins, Jacinta Marto (Sherry Jackson) and Francisco Marto (Sammy Ogg) decide to pray their version of the Rosary by yelling out, \"Hail Mary!\" but not finishing the prayer.
