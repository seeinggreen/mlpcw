While they wait for the power to return, Peter decides to retell the story of Star Wars beginning with \"Part IV\".\nA Rebel ship is captured by a Star Destroyer. On the ship are the droids C-3PO (Quagmire), R2-D2 (Cleveland) and the rebel leader Princess Leia (Lois). While the ship is boarded by stormtroopers, Leia tries to send an MPEG to Obi-Wan Kenobi through R2, but encounters so many complications that R2 offers to deliver the message himself. Leia is captured by Darth Vader (Stewie) while R2 and 3PO flee to Tatooine in an escape pod, where they are captured by Jawas (one of whom is Mort).\nThe droids are sold to a family of moisture farmers, whose nephew Luke Skywalker (Chris) wishes to join the Rebellion and fight the Empire. While cleaning the droids, Luke stumbles upon Leia's message inside R2, who later decides to leave the farm. Luke and C-3PO pursue him, but are attacked by Sand People. Luke is knocked out by one of them (Opie) and is found by Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), who takes them to his hut. Leia's message explains that R2 contains the plans to the Death Star, which must be sent to her father on her home planet of Alderaan and asks Obi-Wan to help. Obi-Wan tells Luke that he must learn the ways of the Force and accompany him to Alderaan, and gives him his own lightsaber. Realizing that the Empire must be looking for the droids, Luke returns home to discover that his home has been destroyed and his aunt and uncle killed, along with John Williams.\nLuke, Obi-Wan, and the droids travel to Mos Eisley to find a pilot to take them to Alderaan. At a local cantina, they hire smuggler Han Solo (Peter) and his Wookiee co-pilot Chewbacca (Brian), who agree to take them with their ship, the Millennium Falcon. The group is soon spotted by stormtroopers and they flee into space, evading the pursuing Star Destroyers before jumping into hyperspace. Leia is imprisoned on the Death Star, where commanding officer Grand Moff Tarkin (Adam West) has Alderaan destroyed. The Millennium Falcon exits hyperspace and is captured by the Death Star's tractor beam and brought into its hangar bay. Disguising themselves as stormtroopers, Han and Luke along with Chewbacca set off to rescue the captive Princess while Obi-Wan goes to shut off the tractor beam and R2 and C3PO stay behind. Han, Luke and Chewie rescue Leia, and the four of them dive into a garbage chute to escape stormtroopers and find a couch in the garbage masher below. As they flee the Death Star, Obi-Wan turns off the tractor beam before being confronted by Darth Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader strikes Obi-Wan down as the others board the Falcon, taking the couch with them.\nThe Falcon journeys to the Rebel base at Yavin IV, where the Rebels analyze the Death Star plans and find a weakness. Luke joins the assault team while Han collects his reward for the rescue and prepares to leave. The Rebel fighters (who also include Simply Red, Helen Reddy, Redd Foxx, Red Buttons, the Red October and an anthropomorphic pack of Big Red gum) attack the Death Star but suffer heavy losses during the assault. During his run, Luke hears Obi-Wan's voice telling him to use the Force, and he turns off his targeting computer. Vader appears with his own group of fighters, and is about to fire at Luke's starfighter when Han arrives in the Falcon and attacks Vader and his men, sending Vader's ship off into space. Guided by the Force, Luke fires into the port, destroying the Death Star, and he returns to the Rebel base with his friends to celebrate their victory.\nBack at the Griffins' home, Peter wraps up the story as the power comes back on.

She and Anja then set out to relocate their camp. On the way, they almost get caught by Soviet/Russian soldiers. Fearing the worst, Saiva ventures out with Anja into the far north to the arctic tundra, passing abandoned telephone wire trees and to the area  where she believes no one would ever find them. After a long paddle north, they pitch camp on a beach, where they set up their yurt.\nWhile sleeping in the night, Saiva has a flashback to her past among the reindeer tribes, after being shunned by her own tribe. In her flashback, she encounters a man who invites her into his tribe to help with the reindeer round-up. The two fall in love with each other, and after a time he gives her a wolf claw necklace. Going back to the present, Saiva and Anja live a harsh brutal life in the tundra hunting animals for their survival. One day while hunting alone, Saiva encounters a badly wounded man nearly frozen and starved to death. After his collapse, she tries to loot him, but the man regains consciousness briefly and asks for her help. Accepting him, Saiva brings him to the yurt and cleans his wounds.\nLater the man claims the name of \"Loki\".  The next day on a hunting trip with them, Loki asks what he can do for them in return for their kindness and Saiva asks him to bring a reindeer. After a failed seal hunt, Loki tells Saiva in their yurt that he was an escapee from soldiers that came to clear out the tundra, and that if they find him they will shoot him. He then shows them his portable hand-cranked radio, one of several clues that the story takes place in the last decades of the 20th century. Later, Loki tries to keep his promise by bringing them a reindeer. But as he is about to shoot one, he is detained by a couple of Soviet soldiers. Just as they are about to put him in their boat, he fights back and kills both of them. He then comes back with their looted supplies and gives them to Saiva and Anja.

Other days, Luke simply avoids Meat; once, he even gets revenge on Meat by tying an industrial cord to a porta potty Meat's using, and the other end to a departing truck.\nWorrying more about Diana's warning, fearing he may be left behind soon, Luke focuses less on his friends and more on the skate park, where the \"cool\" people are. He begins to ditch A.J. and Riley every morning, and they always find him later at the park.\nAfter the repeated day has accumulated over several months, Luke finally has developed enough skill that he beats Gus at the Pound tryout, and his friends are shocked when he abandons them to eagerly join the impressed members of the skate group. Diana steps in and tells Snake Luke is too young to join their group, but Snake insists that Luke can never be too young for the three N's: \"hangN, rideN, and partyN\". Luke, surprised that The Pound is nothing like his real friends, realizing maybe he isn't cut out for the group, returns to the carnival to find them. A.J. and Riley are angry with him for his lies, and blow him off.\nThe next morning, Luke is gone when A.J. and Riley wake up in the tent. He is sitting on a park bench crying, when Diana shows up and comforts him. Luke swears he's been repeating the same day, and he manages to prove a skeptical Diana by taking her to the carnival and pointing out numerous random events before they occur. Diana sympathizes with his situation, telling him she didn't mean to scare him with her warning about friends, but was only teasing him. She tells him that maybe the reason he's stuck is because he needs to change his day for the better; when his crush Alice walks by and says hi to him, Diana smiles at Luke, suggesting he begin there. She encourages him to be ready for the approaching school year and be more confident.\nLuke confronts Meat again, this time warning him against bullying, and claiming he'll tell the whole middle school Meat's real name is Melvin if he doesn't start being nicer to people. Confused, Meat agrees, and leaves. He makes a positive effort to communicate with Mr. Molesky, a teacher for the upcoming year whom Luke has previously not done a good job making an impression with over the repeated cycle. He manages to admit his feelings to Alice, and she tells him she's glad they're going to be in class that year.\nWhen Luke and his friends are waiting backstage before the concert, Luke retrieves the Frisbee that resets the cycle. However, nothing happens to him; unexpectedly, he makes it to the talent show, and though their introduction is shaky, Diana encourages Luke on; Snake joins in, and soon the crowd is cheering them on. The boys eagerly begin their song, The Last Day of Summer. Steel Monkey's performance is received warmly. However, right after they finish, Luke is knocked out again, this time by a chipmunk that falls from the top of the stage.\nLuke wakes up on the first day of school, but discovers he has to stay home due to his head injury.

The tribe is led by a hunter who has killed a mammoth single-handedly and earned the White Spear, and venerate Old Mother, an elderly woman with shamanistic powers. The mammoths begin to dwindle, and the village chief finds a young girl named Evolet who survived a massacre of her village, perpetrated by what Old Mother calls \"four-legged demons\" who will come when \"the Yagahl go on their last hunt\". She prophesies that whoever kills the leader of the \"demons\" will win both Evolet and the White Spear, becoming the next village chief. The tribe believe that the \"demons\" are mammoths, whose return will save them from starvation. The chief, however, does not believe the prophecy and leaves to find another way to save his people. He entrusts the White Spear, his son D'Leh, and the true purpose of his quest to his friend Tic'Tic. The rest of the tribe, including D'Leh's rival Ka'Ren, believe that D'Leh's father was a coward and fled. Over time, D'Leh and Evolet fall in love.\nWhen the mammoths finally return, D'Leh hunts them with the men of the tribe under Tic'Tic's leadership and manages to kill one by accident, inadvertently winning both the White Spear and marriage to Evolet. The village believes Old Mother's prophecy is coming true, but D'Leh is consumed by guilt for not earning the White Spear fairly. After speaking with Tic'Tic, he gives up the White Spear, forfeiting his marriage to Evolet. The next day, horse-raiders attack the camp, enslaving Evolet and several others, and killing many of the tribe. D'Leh, Tic'Tic, Ka'Ren, and young boy Baku set out to rescue their fellow Yagahl, but Evolet is recaptured with Ka'Ren and Baku during an attack on the slavers by terror birds, and Tic'Tic is wounded. While hunting, D'Leh falls into a pit, where he rescues a Smilodon (saber-toothed tiger) before escaping himself. After Tic'Tic recovers, they make their way to a village of sedentary farmers and learn of a prophecy from the Naku, another tribe; whoever talks to a Smilodon they call the \"Spear-Tooth\" will help free their people. D'Leh realizes the prophecy is about him when the Smilodon he rescued arrives and refuses to kill him. They also learn that D'Leh's father was a guest of the Naku until the slavers captured him. Tic'Tic finally reveals to D'Leh that his father did not abandon the tribe. Rather he set out to save it, but let the others believe he had fled to prevent them from following him.\nSeveral tribes form a coalition to pursue the raiders with D'Leh as their leader. They find the ships holding Evolet and their families but fail to reach them before the raiders cast off. The war party nearly dies out while journeying through a treacherous desert, but D'leh learns to use the North Star to navigate the dunes. On the other side of the desert, they discover an advanced civilization, ruled by an enigmatic god-king known as the \"Almighty\". Here it is discovered that the kidnapped Yagahl are used as slave labor to build a pyramid. The warlord who kidnapped Evolet tries unsuccessfully to win her love, only to be arrested by the Almighty's priests when they find he has taken her without permission. During a night scouting raid, D'Leh learns of the Almighty and the fate of his father, who perished as a slave. The party is spotted by the guards, who are killed by Tic'Tic before he succumbs to his wounds. Meanwhile, the Almighty's priests believe that Evolet is destined to kill The Almighty, based on the whip scars on her hands matching the stars they call the \"Mark of the Hunter\" and an ancient prophecy foreseeing their civilization's downfall. The Almighty deduces that Evolet is merely the herald of the true Hunter, which leaves him and his priests unsettled. D'Leh starts a rebellion among the slaves, killing many of the Almighty's forces, though Ka'Ren is killed.\nThe Almighty offers Evolet and the other hunters to D'Leh in exchange for abandoning his rebellion. D'Leh feigns acceptance but kills the Almighty with a spear, breaking his illusion of godhood. During the ensuing battle, Evolet is killed by the warlord who is then killed by D'Leh, but is restored to life when Old Mother sacrifices herself. With the Almighty dead and his civilization destroyed, the Yagahl bid farewell to the other tribes and return home with seeds given to them by the Naku to start a new life.", "tmdb_plot": "A prehistoric epic that follows a young mammoth hunter's journey through uncharted territory to secure the future of his tribe.", "tmdb_id": "7840", "wiki_id": "4223800"}, {"title": "21", "genres": ["Drama", "Crime"], "wiki_plot": "Ben Campbell, a mathematics major at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is accepted into Harvard Medical School but cannot afford the $300,000 tuition.

Evading German spies (Werner Daehn and Peter Stark), Scudder (Eddie Marsan) pushes himself into Hannay's flat and reveals himself to be a betrayed freelance British Secret Service Bureau agent, who has been on the trail of a German espionage ring with headquarters in Scotland. He has heard rumours of a plot to assassinate a high-ranking European royal, which could lead to war.

The next day, Arjun leaves to survey the vast property for a few hours and Lisa has Father Thomas bless the house, during which he discovers the manor is cursed and has held onto its dark past \u2013 later that night, Father Thomas is tormented by a spirit whispering in Latin. He rushes to the church archives where his colleague discovers the phrase means the house and its spirit are warning the church away.\nThe next day, he rushes to the manor to warn the occupants but discovers Arjun has taken Lisa to Delhi for a few weeks for a high-profile meeting with the project suppliers. Father Thomas begs Balwant to pass on a message to Lisa and Arjun that it is dangerous for them to stay in the house, and he promises to do so. On the road to Delhi, Arjun's carriage is stopped by soldiers who inform them the roads are dangerous due to rebel fighting further down the roads. As Arjun cannot afford to waste time, he leaves Lisa at home and proceeds on with his trip with armed guards. Balwant refuses to pass on Father Thomas\u2019 message when Lisa comes home, and she falls badly sick after a night of terrors. The church windows begin to bleed and Father Thomas fears Lisa is at great risk.\nWhen Arjun comes home to a gravely ill wife, he enlists a doctor's help who urges him to get her admitted to the hospital. Father Thomas tries to tell Arjun that Lisa is possessed but he is not believed \u2013 at the hospital Lisa's condition worsens as the spirit finally manifests itself. When the doctor and his staff attempt to sedate her, the spirit informs everyone of how the doctor raped his superior's young daughter by sedating her in that very room. Shaken by his secret being let out, the doctor agrees to let Arjun try religious methods to save Lisa. Arjun visits MK and forces him to tell him the truth \u2013 but as the owner had only purchased the property two years prior, MK can only give the name of the prior caretaker \u2013 Radha, who left to live in Naya Nagar when the property ownership changed.\nArjun leaves Lisa in the care of church members and goes to Naya Nagar where he tracks Radha, now old, down. Radha reveals that the house was once owned by Rai Bahadur, a wealthy Indian of royal descent. In 1857, when Radha was a child, he was away fighting the British, leaving his daughter Gayatri and her maid servants Kesar Ma and Radha to run the estate with two old male servants. One night, the manor occupants are disturbed by screams and find a man in the Indian Army uniform, staggering around the property badly wounded. He states his name is Mohan Kant and that he barely escaped the slaughter of his unit \u2013 one of the groups Gayatri's father was leading, where over 90 men died to the British. The family sympathise and dedicate their time to getting him better, believing he is a patriot. During this time, Mohan becomes infatuated with Gayatri's beauty and she grows close to him.\nA few days later, Kesar Ma catches him secretly liaising with a British soldier during the night and confronts him. He kills and dumps her body in the well and lies to Gayatri, stating she has gone home to her village where a relative was badly ill. Gayatri becomes suspicious but is interrupted by Radha's terrified state. Following her to the well, they discover Kesar Ma's body. Gayatri then searches Mohan Kant's belongings, discovering to her horror that he was a British spy who was responsible for the death of the unit as he leaked information to his commanding officer, betraying the Indian patriots and that he was waiting to go undercover for his protection.\nGayatri sends Radha with the messages to her father's outpost in order to get help, she chooses to stay behind to seduce Mohan to delay his departure. She consummates the farce in the library long enough for her father to arrive with his troops and hang Mohan in the same room. He vows to haunt the manor awaiting her soul so he can take it with him to hell. Rai Bahadur refuses to acknowledge his daughter's sacrifice, sealing the room and disowning her for bringing shame to the family for sleeping with a traitor \u2013 banishing her to her grandmother's where she dies unwed and alone on 18th November 1896. Arjun surmises that this was the same night that Lisa was born, deducing that Gayatri and his wife share the same soul hence Mohan's current obsession in possessing her, the spirit was attempting to kill Lisa in order to fulfil his vow. He ruminates on Lisa's experiences in the house with regret, stating that his wife tried telling him many times that something was wrong with the house, but he had rebuffed her fears as baseless and silly, then rushes home.\nFather Thomas tells Arjun he now has less than 24 hours to oust the spirit as the next day was the night of the new moon at which time the spirit would have full control of Lisa's soul thus killing her. He suggests an exorcism. The church refuses to authorize the procedure without the bishop's permission but this would be no later than two weeks by which time it would be too late. Father Thomas defies his superior's orders and proceeds with the ritual. During the exorcism, Balwant and Father Thomas die due to the strength of the spirit, Arjun takes up the process but is forced to re-evaluate his atheist stance in renouncing his faith. Finally he is able to succeed by using the Hanuman Chalisa. The spirit of Mohan is destroyed and Lisa is free.\nAfterward, Arjun completes the project and he acknowledges his faith stating that Gayatri's soul was reborn looking for the love she was denied and now she and the manor were at peace.", "tmdb_plot": "The year is 1920 and the house isolated in the wilderness has a secret.

She invites Robbie's best friend, Dave, to a concert by Robbie's band, the Stiff Dylans. Upon seeing Georgia and Dave dancing and laughing, Robbie tries to talk to her but is stopped by Lindsay.\nAt school, Dave confronts Georgia about using him to make Robbie jealous. Upon learning what Georgia did to Dave, Robbie severs ties with her. Georgia discovers it was Jas that accidentally leaked this information. After Georgia kicks Jas in the shin during an argument, they vow never to speak to each other again. Shortly afterwards, Robbie tells Georgia he was considering breaking up with Lindsay before becoming involved with her, but now he is disappointed with her recent behaviour.\nDevastated, Georgia decides that she would like to move to New Zealand. She stops by her father's workplace and breaks down in tears with a woman who works with him, telling her she does not want her family to be apart from each other. She later goes to the beach, knowing Robbie would be there, and apologises to him. Robbie reveals he ended things with Lindsay and admits he still likes Georgia.\nOn Georgia's 15th birthday, Connie takes her to a nightclub for the first time. The place initially seems empty, but Georgia's friends and family soon show up to reveal a surprise birthday party, which Jas secretly organised with Connie. Georgia and Jas make amends.

Sathya is a rowdy, wasting his time drinking merrily and getting involved in fights. Though he and Kripa pass college with a first-class degree, Sathya has no interest in joining the police force. Kripa studies hard to become a Sub-Inspector and challenges Sathya to do the same. Just a day before the exam, Sathya decides to take up the exam as well, much to his friend's surprise. Owing to his uncle's political connections, he passes the physical, written, and interview and becomes an SI. However, Kripa does not make it through despite being straightforward; this creates a rift between the two. Kripa's father lies to Sathya that he has gone to Mumbai, but Sathya finds him in the local bar, having become a drunkard.\nThe parallel is the story of Deena Dayalan and Loganathan, who extort money from businessmen through kidnappings. Before Sathya becomes a policeman, he beats up Daya for attempting to molest Kripa's sister Uthra, though none, including Kripa, knows of this.\nSathya gains fame by holding off knife-wielding men who come to kill an injured man at a hospital, though the man is killed later in the night. As a result, Sathya is drafted into a special task force to catch the gang members related to the crime. Meanwhile, Daya and Logu carry out two kidnappings, rape the victims on both occasions, and release them for ransom money. Kripa is beaten up by the police for a skirmish at the local bar; his father suffers a heart attack after getting his son back from the police station. At this point of time, Kripa is employed by Daya, mainly because the former is distraught and will fall easily to the lure of money and booze. In the third time, however, the police are informed, but the kidnappers find out by chance and change the drop off point at the last moment. They give the police the slip but narrowly avoid capture, with Kripa providing shelter for them in his house. Kripa joins along to get money for his father's angioplasty, though he does not realize until it is too late that he is doing illegal things and harming young children.\nMeanwhile, Sathya identifies Daya from the characteristics, with a background check revealing that Daya was accused of raping his senior's wife in the army. Daya, Logu, and their accomplices are again almost caught when the police trace one of the accomplice's families. Daya kills his own man during this raid to avoid information being passed, and hatches a plan to escape to Bihar in a poultry van. Logu is killed by Daya upon learning that the former had hatched a plan to kill him. However, to escape to the city outskirts to rendezvous with the van, they hijack the Inspector-General's car with his two daughters inside. Switching soon to a disguised-dog van to get past check-posts with the two girls, Daya, Kripa, and another accomplice arrive at a sugarcane field. Sathya recognizes Kripa's voice from the ransom call he makes to the IG, and follows Uthra from the hospital, who has been instructed to bring a bag full of cash from their home (kept there by Daya), to the sugarcane field.\nThe plot to kidnap the IG's daughters is an elaborate ruse to divert the police force to the south of the city while they escape from the north. The special task force, who are in the south of the city, realize the plot and, upon learning that Sathya is alone in the north of the city, head in that direction. In the sugarcane fields, Kripa shows compassion towards the two girls, treating them softly. Upon hearing some noise in the field, Daya splits the group, doing so to meet up directly with Uthra, who has the money. He tries to rape her, but Sathya intervenes. A fist fight ensures, but the special task force comes upon them and kills Daya by setting it up as an encounter.\nThe two girls split and escape from the third accomplice, only for one of them to be recaptured by him, but is let off being too tiring to carry. Kripa and the third accomplice try to run away, with Uthra behind him. Just as he leaves her to escape, she reveals that she is in love with Sathya and uses the situation to handcuff herself to Kripa to avoid him from escaping. In the end, Sathya shoots Kripa in self-defense and to save one of the IG's daughters from being shot. When Kripa lies on Sathya's lap shot, Kripa finds a ring he once gifted to Sathya on his birthday, which Kripa believed was thrown away by Sathya when he was drunk while partying at the bar, which in turn wets Kripa's eye and dies.

Angered at his policies in governing Iran, members of the West German student movement protest. The police and the Shah's security team attack the protesters, and unarmed protester Benno Ohnesorg is fatally shot by Officer Karl-Heinz Kurras.\nOhnesorg's death outrages West Germany, including left wing journalist Ulrike Meinhof, who claims in a televised debate that the democratically elected government of West Germany is a fascist police state. Inspired by Meinhof's rhetoric, charismatic radicals Gudrun Ensslin and Andreas Baader mastermind the Frankfurt department store firebombing of 1968. While covering their trial, Ulrike Meinhof finds herself deeply moved by their commitment to armed struggle against what they see as a Neo-Nazi Government. She secures a jailhouse interview with Ensslin and the two strike up a close friendship. Soon after, Meinhof leaves her husband for journalist Peter Homann, an associate of the radicals.\nMeanwhile, Ensslin and Baader have been released pending an appeal and attract various young people, including Astrid Proll and Peter-Jurgen Boock. After spending some time abroad, Baader, Ensslin and Proll return to West Germany and begin living with Meinhof. Increasingly bored with her middle-class life, Meinhof longs to take more violent action. Even though Ensslin tells her that sacrifices must be made for the revolution, Meinhof does not wish to leave her children. But then, Baader is arrested. Using her connections, Meinhof arranges for him to be interviewed off prison grounds, where Ensslin and the others spring him from custody. While the plan called for Meinhof to look like an innocent journalist caught in a prison break, she flees with Baader and Ensslin, thereby incriminating herself in the attempted murders of an unarmed civilian and two policemen.\nAfter leaving Meinhof's two children in Sicily, the group receives training in a Fatah camp in Jordan, where the egotistical and promiscuous Germans enrage their Muslim hosts. Homann leaves the group after overhearing Meinhof, Baader, and Ensslin asking Fatah to kill him. Having also learned that Meinhof wishes to send her two children to a training camp for suicide bombers, Homann informs Meinhof's former colleague Stefan Aust, who returns the children to their father.\nReturning to Germany and styling themselves the Red Army Faction (RAF), Baader and his followers launch a campaign of bank robberies. In response, BKA chief Horst Herold orders all local police to be put at Federal command for one day. During that day, RAF member Petra Schelm drives through a roadblock and is chased by two cops. When cornered, she initiates a gunfight and is fatally shot by their return fire. Regarding this as murder, Baader and Ensslin overrule Meinhof's objections and begin systematically bombing police stations and United States Military bases.

Herold replies, \"A myth.\"\nMeinhof, suffering from depression and remorse over the deaths caused by their bombings, is subjected to sadistic emotional abuse by Baader and Ensslin, who call her a traitor and \"a knife in the RAF's back\". In response, Meinhof hangs herself in her cell. The imprisoned RAF members accuse West Germany's Government of murdering her during their trial and are widely believed.\nUpon completing her sentence, Brigitte Mohnhaupt takes over command of the RAF. She informs Boock that Baader has forbidden any more attacks on \"the people\" and enlists his help smuggling weapons into Stammheim. In retaliation for the \"murders\" of Meins, Hausner, and Meinhof, the RAF assassinates West Germany's Attorney General, Siegfried Buback. Mohnhaupt, Christian Klar, and Susanne Albrecht, also attempt to kidnap Dresdner Bank President J\u00fcrgen Ponto, who fights back and is shot dead.

Toorop, the girl, and her guardian Sister Rebeka (Yeoh), travel from the Noelite Convent in Kyrgyzstan to reach New York via Russia.\nUnlike in the technologically advanced U.S., war and terrorist activity have transformed Russia's cities into dangerous, overpopulated slums. The stress of humanity's situation causes Aurora to act out in strange ways and display clairvoyance abilities. On one such occasion, Aurora, seemingly for no reason, panics and runs from a crowded train station, just before it explodes in a terrorist attack.\nThe protagonists must also evade an unknown group of mercenaries claiming to have been sent by Aurora's supposedly dead father. Later, they board a submarine that carries refugees to Canada. To avoid satellite detection, the Captain of the submarine orders his crew to dive and he shoots some of the refugees still trying to get on board. Aurora, infuriated by the loss of life, operates the 30-year-old submarine without training.

Toorop manages to destroy all the drones, but also gets wounded. These perils cause Finn to betray the group, so Toorop shoots him dead.\nOnce in Harlem, a news broadcast about the bombing of the Kyrgyzstan convent causes the group to realize there is more going on than they know. The Noelites have become a major new salvationist religion, which vast numbers of people cling to as the world spirals out of control. However, in private meetings, it is seen that their High Priestess (Charlotte Rampling) only desires power and uses invented miracles to court converts. Gorsky, working for the Noelites, had planted a tracking device in Toorop's passport and bombed the convent when he knew they were in the United States. The doctor who earlier saw Aurora examines her again in a hotel room. When he leaves, Aurora reveals (without being told) that she is pregnant with twins despite being a virgin.\nLooking outside the hotel, Toorop sees Gorsky's men and the Noelite group, heavily armed and waiting for them on the street. The High Priestess calls Toorop and asks him to bring Aurora outside. Just before they take her away, Toorop changes his mind and starts a firefight with the two groups to get the two women to safety. Gorsky's men fire guided missiles at Toorop that track his subdermal passport. Rebeka gets killed defending Aurora, who in turn shoots Toorop, saying, \"I need you to live.\" Toorop's clinical death causes the guided missile to go off target (missing Toorop) and explode near Aurora instead; she inexplicably survives.\nDr. Arthur Darquandier (Lambert Wilson) revives Toorop using advanced medical techniques, but several of Toorop's body parts are replaced with cybernetics to undo the damage of being dead for over two hours. Darquandier explains that when Aurora was a fetus, he implanted a supercomputer into her brain. It is also implied that the Noelite group had him create Aurora to become pregnant at a certain time to use her as a \"virgin birth\". After she was born, the Noelites hired Gorsky to kill Darquandier, but he failed.

Score one for Alpha, until they realize that the person they hit isn't part of either team.\nWhile attempting to make it back to camp, the Beta team comes across an abandoned house. Inside they are attacked and kidnapped by men with axes and bows. The men who kidnapped them are part of an overzealous religious group, who have mistaken the team for FBI Agents, and believe they've come to claim their land. The Alpha group return to their camp and find it ransacked and their gas siphoned off. As they try to find some gas, Johnny spots two men across the lake from their campsite. One points and the other shoots Johnny through the neck, killing him instantly. The others try to make a break for it and manage to escape.\nAdam then attempts to contact the Park Ranger, but his call is intercepted by one of the cult and he and the others are captured by a man posing as a Park Ranger. Maggie (the only girl in the Beta group) is shown with the leader of the cult (called \"Mother\"), who tells her the cult's camp is her home now. When Maggie resists, she is taken away and raped by Mother's biological son, a large beast-like man. Gwen, the woman who was captured at the beginning of the film, is now shown to be pregnant, and a servant to the cultist group. Lee (the only girl from Group Alpha) is also taken and prepared to be used as a vessel for Mother's son's \"seed\", while the boys are put into cages and brutally abused by the males in the cult.\nThe fake ranger, who appears to be Mother's husband and the Cult's protector, takes Adam and tortures him, attempting to get information about the FBI's plans. When Adam resists, he sends one of the other cult members to finish him off. As his throat is about to be slit, Adam breaks free of his ropes, and attacks and kills his would-be murderer. He then sets the surviving team members (Perry and Basso, the only two have survived the brutalizing) free. They escape, killing several cult members along the way, and rescue the girls. Maggie is hysterical after her ordeal. The group escapes with Lee, who seduced Mother's son into setting her free with touches and kisses, and a good kick in the face.\nThe survivors are pursued by the cultists. After setting fire to the compound, they are cornered outside it. As they are about to be executed, they turn the tables, taking Mother hostage. Basso is killed and the others escape, severely injuring and killing several cultists, including Mother. Later, Perry falls prey to a tripwire-rigged trap, impaling him through the gut. Although painful, he manages to survive long enough to kill off several more cultists and give the others the time they need to get away, after which his head is bashed in by Mother's son.\nLee, Maggie and Adam make it up to a mountain where Maggie, who is now delusional from the trauma, commits suicide by jumping off the cliff. Lee and Adam escape by jumping into a river and swimming to the shore, where they meet the real Park Ranger. Then Mother's husband, her son, and another cultist arrive in a truck and shoot the Ranger with an arrow. Adam then takes his gun and shoots both the cultists. Mother's husband attempts to run Adam down, but collides with the Ranger's truck. Adam shoots him as he begs for help.\nMuch later, the FBI and the Police arrive, giving medical attention to Adam and Lee. Adam is disturbed to hear that only two bodies were recovered from the final confrontation.\nAn FBI team treks through the forest, searching for the cult, when Gwen comes out of a cave, having finally escaped herself. As the agent leading the group walks toward her, Gwen shouts for her to run.

He uses multiple aliases and also has middlemen between him and his handlers. He also carries a watch to perform a hit in specific time and correctly visualizes his every target.\nAfter completing a hit in Prague and killing his current help, Joe travels to Bangkok for an assignment to assassinate four people for notorious Bangkok crime boss Surat, whom he never meets. Joe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. He hires a local Thai pickpocket named Kong, who has simple English knowledge, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe.

In return, Erzsebet must sacrifice both love and her reputation. Darvulia becomes Erzsebet's companion. Meanwhile, maidens in the area have been dying of seemingly unrelated causes, and Erzsebet is seen bathing in a large tub of red liquid as the girls' now-mutilated corpses are buried nearby. Two monks later conclude that the water is not blood but is simply colored red by herbs.\nAfter her husband Ferenc N\u00e1dasdy's death, Erzs\u00e9bet quarrels with his scheming friend Gy\u00f6rgy Thurz\u00f3, who tries to proposition her at her husband's funeral.

In one of these, she stabs a woman to death with scissors. Afterwards, she confesses to Darvulia that she can no longer tell dream from reality. Darvulia discovers that someone has been placing hallucinogenic mushrooms in Erzs\u00e9bet's drinks; Erzs\u00e9bet cannot remember clearly and believes Darvulia responsible. She has the woman thrown out. Thurz\u00f3 and his wife then capture Darvulia and torture her, cutting out her tongue. Before she dies, she writes Thurz\u00f3's name in blood on her cell wall. Erzs\u00e9bet swears vengeance on him.\nThurz\u00f3 enlists Erzs\u00e9bet's sons-in-law and other allies to prosecute her for witchcraft. When their plans repeatedly fail, they nonetheless capture the Countess and torture members of her household to try to obtain incriminating information. The servants are then executed for their alleged crimes, and Erzs\u00e9bet is imprisoned. Despairing over her separation from her son, she lies on her bed and begins to sing a hymn; the flames from her candles rise and engulf her in flames.

It begins with Charlie, his autistic brother, banging a wooden spoon on the grass with neighbours staring and pointing. Then, it cuts to the house where there are locks on the drawers and Maggie, their mother, locking star-shaped stickers in her bathroom cabinet. Thomas is anxious because he has to start at a new school, and make new friends. All he wants to do is fit in and be regarded in the same way as everyone else. However, it seems he struggles to achieve this goal. Although his family appears to be a fairly happy one, Thomas often feels isolated; it seems as if his mother only dotes upon his brother, Charlie (Luke Ford), and does not pay any attention to him. However, Thomas is devoted to his brother and shows affection for him. Charlie is Thomas's older brother who lives with severe autism, as well as attention deficit disorder. Charlie enjoys dressing up like a monkey, playing computer games using a Commodore 64 and receiving gold stars for good behaviour. Charlie communicates with the rest of his family by using sign language.\nWhen their heavily pregnant mother, Maggie (Toni Collette), must take a rest owing to a recommendation by her doctor as a consequence of Maggie's high blood pressure, Thomas is put in charge of Charlie. Thomas finds this task difficult and onerous. For example, when Charlie flees from the house in a high-spirited mood, Thomas runs after him to ensure the safety of his brother, but he cannot keep up with Charlie. Matters become even more problematic when Charlie expresses the urge to go to the bathroom and enters the nearest house to use the toilet. When he does so, the brothers encounter Jackie (Gemma Ward) who is taking a shower. The fact that both brothers are only wearing their underwear is a source of severe embarrassment for Thomas.\nJackie exhibits her interest in Thomas when she attends a CPR class at school and visits Thomas at his home to return Charlie's monkey hat that he accidentally left behind when he used Jackie's toilet. Thomas's first response is to ensure that his brother is hidden away from Jackie. However, Maggie is less than thrilled when she discovers that Thomas has locked Charlie in his bedroom. She then sees Charlie proceeding to rub his own faeces into the carpet. After Maggie attempts to clean up the floor, (despite being ordered to stay in bed) Thomas becomes frustrated and tells Maggie that Charlie is her responsibility and she slaps him after he calls him a freak. Maggie replies that Charlie will never be able to have a job, nor a family and he will be unable to look after himself. He will be more likely to remain living with his parents for the rest of his life.\nThis latest episode proves too much for Maggie. Her husband, Simon, insists that she spend the rest of her pregnancy in the hospital instead, leaving Thomas to become the primary caregiver for Charlie. Thomas begins to enter into Charlie's world when he rides the school bus for children with various special needs with his brother. In addition, Thomas is seen dealing with Charlie, who has a meltdown due to Simon not buying some more items at a local supermarket since he does not have enough money. This again causes severe embarrassment for Thomas. That same evening when the trio return from the supermarket, Thomas, who was annoyed by the meltdown, rips up Charlie's star chart. This causes things to become worse when the brothers fight and Charlie throws a stool through the window. The next day, when Thomas attends his swimming class, Jackie wears Charlie's monkey ears, which pleases and amuses him. When Jackie meets Charlie, she makes a concerted effort to know and understand him, as well as to use Sign Language as a means by which to communicate with him.\nThomas and his father both endeavour to care for Charlie together. Simon tells Thomas that his mother is grateful to have Charlie as a child because she feels that the family is strong enough to be able to look after him. Representatives from Youth and Community Services visit the house and state that they have received multiple complaints about Charlie. Simon is furious at his neighbour whom he attributes responsibility for the invasive visit. Thomas also displays his loyalty to his brother. Charlie accompanies Jackie and Thomas to swim in a river. When it rains, they all shelter in a nearby drainpipe where Jackie and Thomas share their first kiss. When the boys arrive home, there is a note taped to the television which states that Maggie has given birth to a girl.\nWhen Thomas sees Charlie at his school, Charlie becomes the victim of malicious taunting and harassment. Jackie tells Thomas that he needs to quit wishing that Charlie was \"normal.\" Tensions flare when Jackie eats a roast dinner with the family in order to celebrate Thomas's sixteenth birthday. Jackie wonders whether or not Charlie will ever speak again. Thomas is confident that Charlie will if everyone will stop communicating with him using Sign Language. After Thomas blows out the candles on his cake, Charlie begins masturbating at the table, causing Jackie to become extremely uncomfortable. In response, Thomas becomes irate and in anger, smashes Charlie's Super NES console (which Charlie had earned for getting enough stars on his good behavior chart earlier), leading to a fight between the brothers. After a frightening physical altercation between the two brothers, Maggie exhibits sympathy for both of her sons. In spite of his mother's commiseration, Thomas still feels as if he behaved badly, while Jackie comforts him by kissing his forearm, indicating she loves him nonetheless. In the morning, Thomas joins Charlie in his morning activity: sitting in the backyard while banging a wooden spoon on the ground. He then learns how to drive with his dad, and picks up an ecstatic Jackie with his new car.\nThe family and Jackie attend a musical production in Charlie's special school entitled \"Animals Afloat,\" (a musical based on Noah's Ark) in which he portrays a monkey. After Charlie's theatrical partner, Russell, has a meltdown on stage and has a falling out with Charlie backstage, Thomas decides to fill in for Russell so that Charlie doesn't have to go on stage alone, and the brothers both don monkey costumes and give an outstanding performance. The brothers celebrate their success by taking a bubble bath together. Thomas confesses to his brother that when he was little, he used to fall asleep at night, wishing that Charlie would be normal.

Barrett wants no part in it, believing it to be a set-up designed by the French to humiliate New World wine producers. Barrett's son, Bo (Chris Pine), secretly passes Spurrier a couple of bottles of the Chateau's chardonnay for the competition. Comely and nonconformist university graduate student Sam Fulton (Rachael Taylor) arrives at Chateau Montelena seeking an internship, and is promptly put to work while stirring up interest among Bo and vineyard foreman Gustavo (Freddy Rodriguez).\nDue to reductionist techniques in wine making (the absence/reduction of oxygen during the wine making process), the chardonnay has turned brown in the bottles, causing Barrett Sr. to call for the whole vintage to be carted away for dumping. But Bo discovers the brown color is only temporary and races back home. On the way back to Chateau Montelena, however, Bo's truck runs out of gas, forcing him and Sam to find someone to help them out. After several unsuccessful attempts on Bo's part, Sam takes over and gets a driver (who turns out to be a police officer) to pull over by exposing her breasts.

Increasingly interested in Julia, Charles surreptitiously kisses her in a dark alley, unaware that Sebastian can see them from the other side of a canal. Jealous of his attention to his sister, Sebastian sets out to end this friendship, and on their return to Britain, Lady Marchmain makes it clear that Charles cannot marry Julia since he is not Catholic and professes to be an atheist.\nSebastian's mother, concerned about his increasing alcoholism, cancels his allowance.

Cass is forced to endure racist bullying on a daily basis from local children, who also ridicule his feminine-sounding name, \"Carol\", a name given to him at birth. Cass finds through violence the respect he never had and becomes addicted to the buzz of fighting. Cass leads the Inter City Firm to victories against large hooligan firms, such as Leeds in 1980, but becomes frustrated with the lack of publicity the ICF are receiving. So he creates cards with the infamous slogan, \"Congratulations, you have just met the famous ICF\", and gives a TV interview, increasing the firm's notoriety for humiliation, their speciality. However, the government under Margaret Thatcher begins to come down hard on hooliganism, and after an organised attack on a group of Newcastle United supporters, Cass is imprisoned for four years. Whilst in Wormwood Scrubs, Cass begins writing his autobiography, in the hope he can generate some income upon the book being published; however his writings are confiscated by the prison upon his release.\nCass is delighted to receive a hero's welcome upon his return, and begins dating Elaine (Natalie Press). This, as well as Cass's rejection of his biological parents after their attempts to contact him, improves his relationship with his adoptive parents after they began to disapprove of his violent lifestyle. Despite having a good relationship with Elaine, Cass is still lured to the violence of hooliganism, and when one of his best friends, Prentice (Gavin Brocker), is attacked by Arsenal supporters with knives, Cass seeks revenge. He is stabbed in the following fight, and Elaine is disgusted, fearing he is returning to his old ways, as she reveals she is pregnant with his child.\nAs time progresses to the early 1990s, the ecstasy era takes over, and hooliganism becomes less of an attraction for Cass, and for many other hooligan firms.

Cass gets a job as a bouncer outside nightclubs, working for Ray (Tamer Hassan), a long-time friend from his ICF days.

Davis. Several months after Walter's disappearance, the LAPD tells Christine that the boy has been found alive. Believing the positive publicity will negate recent criticism of the department, the LAPD organizes a public reunion. Although \"Walter\" claims he is Christine's son, she says he is not. Captain J.J. Jones, the head of the LAPD's Juvenile Division, insists the boy is Walter and pressures Christine into taking him home \"on a trial basis.\"\nAfter Christine confronts Jones with physical discrepancies between \"Walter\" and her son, in particular that her son was several inches taller and uncircumcised. Unconvinced by her statements, Captain Jones arranges for a medical doctor to visit her. The doctor tells Christine that \"Walter\" is three inches shorter than before his disappearance because trauma has shrunk his spine and that the man who took Walter must have had him circumcised. A newspaper prints a story implying that Christine is an unfit mother; Briegleb tells Christine it was planted by police to discredit her. Both Walter's teacher and his dentist give Christine signed letters asserting that \"Walter\" is an impostor.

Clark tells Ybarra that Northcott forced him to help kidnap and murder around twenty children and he identifies Walter as one of them. Jones tells Briegleb that Christine is in protective custody following a mental breakdown. Jones orders Clark's deportation, but Ybarra takes Clark to the murder site and tells him to dig where the bodies are buried. Clark hesitates, but he soon uncovers body parts. Briegleb secures Christine's release by showing Steele a newspaper story about the Wineville killings that names Walter as a possible victim. Under interrogation by Ybarra, Walter's impostor reveals that his motive was to secure transport to Los Angeles to see his favorite actor, Tom Mix and says the police told him to lie about being Christine's son.

They fail to purchase S-Bahn tickets and a frustrated Rudi snaps to Trudi, who suggests they go to the beach. The following evening, Trudi, Rudi, and Franzi attend a Butoh performance - Trudi and Franzi watch the show while a bored and frustrated Rudi waits outside.\nThe elderly couple travel to a beach resort and spend a couple of days walking by the shore. On the third day, Rudi finds that Trudi has died in her sleep. He is joined in the beach town by his children and their partners; Karl flies in from Tokyo. Behind Rudi\u2019s back, his family discusses his noticeable grief and struggle to cope. Rudi, distraught, finally gets back home and resents his new solitude. Trudi\u2019s ashes are buried in a ceremony which only Franzi and Rudi of all the family attend.\nAfter some time, Rudi suddenly flies to Tokyo to visit Karl, who takes him in his small flat but has no time to show him around. Initially, Rudi stays home with little to do with his time, and takes a liking to wear Trudi\u2019s clothes to remember her the better. Soon he ventures outside and gets lost in the busy, vibrant Tokyo streets, but eventually gets to know some quiet spots while wearing Trudi\u2019s jumper and skirt underneath his coat to feel that he is showing Japan to her; one day he spots a young lady in a park dancing what appears to be Butoh. Karl grows increasingly annoyed because of him, as Rudi learns when he overhears a conversation with him and Klaus.\nSoon afterwards, Rudi sees the dancing girl again and approaches her to enquire about Butoh. She explains to him the nature of Butoh and they develop a friendship; thus he learns that she has been an orphan for one year and dances Butoh to cope with the loss of her mother. The girl, whose name is Yu, helps him get into the train back to Karl\u2019s, and over the following days they see each other every day, while Rudi starts to notice his health deteriorating. One day Yu tells him that she lives in a tent; moved, Rudi follows her as she goes back home and learns that she is homeless, so he takes her home much to Karl\u2019s irritation; hearing them argue while she is taking a shower, she discreetly leaves back to her tent.\nThe following morning, Rudi grabs his belongings and discreetly leaves. He asks Yu to join him to a trip to Mount Fuji to fulfil Trudi\u2019s dream and they take the train to a mountain resort. Yu explains to him that Mount Fuji is \u2018very shy\u2019 and remains veiled by the clouds most of the time, which they see for themselves upon arrival. They register in a ryokan and spend the following days waiting for the weather to improve, with Rudi\u2019s patience and health wearing out. One night he wakes up in fever; Yu looks after him and soothes him back to sleep. Before dawn, Rudi wakes up again and, looking out of the window, finds that the sky is clear and Mount Fuji perfectly visible. He puts on Trudi\u2019s kimono and paints his face, then rushes out to the lakeshore to dance in Butoh style; Trudi\u2019s spirit joins him and they both dance, before he collapses and dies.\nShortly after Rudi\u2019s death, a deeply saddened Yu goes over his belongings and discovers an envelope in which he had left her all his savings. Karl arrives and he and Yu perform a traditional ceremony after Rudi\u2019s cremation to place his bones in an urn. They drive back to Tokyo and part outside Karl\u2019s building.\nBack in their parents\u2019s home, Klaus, Karolin, and Karl grimly discuss both sudden deaths, to which Franzi states that \u2018he probably was happy in the end.\u2019 Yu, for her part, is seen back in the park under the cherry blossoms, dancing Butoh with Rudi\u2019s hat and other belongings.", "tmdb_plot": "After finding out that her husband, Rudi, has a fatal illness, Trudi Angermeier arranges a trip to Berlin so they can see their children.

In 1938, a year after the Japanese invasion of northern China and occupation of central coastal areas, he sneaks into Nanjing, China, by pretending to be a Red Cross aid worker. Arriving in Nanjing, Hogg witnesses and photographs the poverty, ruins, and corpses on the streets.  He proceeds to write a daily journal about his findings when he is interrupted by the sounds from outside. Upon peering outside the window, Hogg witnesses Japanese soldiers round up Chinese refugees and proceed to massacre the group. He anxiously takes photos of this event by the window. Later at night, Hogg is captured by the Japanese while photographing them committing atrocities. He is about to be executed when Chen Hansheng (Chow Yun-fat), a Chinese communist resistance fighter, saves him. While hiding in the rubble with Hansheng, Hogg witnesses the execution of two of his colleagues by the Japanese. Overwhelmed by shock, he inadvertently reveals their presence. A firefight ensues, and Hogg is wounded. He wakes up to Lee Pearson (Radha Mitchell), checking on his wounds and discovers he has been brought to a rebel camp. With nowhere to go for now, Hansheng tells Hogg, on Lee's suggestion, to rest at an orphanage housing 56 young boys and only an aged grandmother to take care of them. However, on the night of his arrival, Hogg is called out by one of the boys to a strange location, and he is savagely attacked with sticks by the orphans.  Thankfully, Lee arrives just in time and threatens to abandon the boys, leaving them without medical supplies or food. Lee explains to Hogg that she runs the orphanage and drops by from time to time with supplies.\nThe next day, at Lee's insistence, Hogg helps her to convince the boys that the treatment of lice by flea powder does not hurt. Lee's demonstration of the treatment on a naked Hogg, in the middle of the courtyard, manages to convince the boys and they all promptly accept treatment. However, Lee asks Hogg to take care of the boys and states that she will be leaving for two months from March to May. Lee also leaves Hogg and the orphans with a mule. However, Hogg replies that he has no intention to stay at the orphanage, but instead wants to go to the front lines to write, and spread the word about the war. As Hogg is leaving, he spots the grandmother looking down at him, and he reflects on his short memory at the orphanage. Reluctantly, he returns to take care of the children. Over the course of the next few days Hogg gains the boys' respect by repairing the lighting, cleaning up the old school (which is the orphanage), and being their teacher. However, as for food, the grandmother had previously shown Hogg with a handful of maggot-infested rice, that there was close to nothing to feed the boys.\nHogg makes a trip to town with one of the boys to seek a well-known and wealthy lady, Mrs. Wang (Michelle Yeoh), with a business deal in mind. Aware that Mrs. Wang only wanted to deal with cash transactions, Hogg still proposed to Mrs. Wang that he'd be able to provide her with vegetables if she supplied him with food and seeds for now. (A later scene would reveal that the war made Mrs. Wang flexible and compassionate toward others and therefore privately willing to barter without cash) Mrs. Wang tested Hogg to see if he possessed the agricultural knowledge so by asking him to identify certain seeds. Hogg passes the test easily and returns with the boy to the orphanage leading his mule full of food and seeds. He starts to plow the land beside the orphanage and with the help of one of the orphans, successfully grows a flourishing vegetable garden along with beautiful and tall stalks of sunflowers.\nFleeing from the Nationalists who want to conscript the boys into their army to fight the Japanese, they make a three-month journey across the snow-bound Liu Pan Shan mountains to safety on the edge of the Mongolian desert, the first 900 km on foot.

On Christmas Day, Abel and Elizabeth discuss Elizabeth's longstanding depression, and Abel reads her the prologue to Friedrich Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality about how well we know \u2013 or don't know \u2013 ourselves.

Not much is known about Dicky's mother, other than the fact she had died when Dicky was young upon Dicky being questioned by Ms. Yuen, Dicky's teacher, one morning as to where his parents were.\nDicky is often bullied by other children, in particular by a boy named Johnny. Johnny is the son of a rich family and bosses other students around at school. He also has other students as his henchmen. Dicky is also chided by his teachers at school because he is poor and wears shabby clothes. Ti often helps Dicky to obtain things from the junkyard as they are too poor to afford certain items, such as his shoes that are tattered. During P.E class, Dicky is punished for wearing torn up shoes and is to stand away. He is sad as he really enjoys doing sports, hoping to have a pair of better shoes soon. Maggie, a large girl in his class joins him as she did not want to participate in P.E class. She also develops a crush on Dicky.\nOne day, while at a department store, Dicky begs his father to buy him a popular robotic toy called CJ1. Ti cannot afford it, and the situation ends badly when Ti smacks the stubborn Dicky in front of other customers. Dicky finds comfort in Ms. Yuen who is passing by. That night, Ti visits the junkyard where he often picks up home appliances and clothes for Dicky. He finds a strange green orb left by a space saucer and takes it home, telling Dicky that it is a new toy. He is hesitant at first, but later accepts it. The next day, Dicky brings the orb to school and gets beaten up by the other children only to get injured and scolded by Ti. The following evening, the green orb transforms into a cute and cuddly dog-like alien creature that befriends Dicky. After playing with the alien, he learns that it is capable of restorative powers after it restores a rotten apple that fell to the ground. Dicky is very thrilled and names the alien \"CJ7\", and then falls asleep dancing in happiness.\nThat night, Dicky dreams that the alien will help him gain popularity and good grades at school. In his dream, he asks the alien of some tasks. First, CJ7 defeats a fierce stray dog in an alley as requested by Dicky. It also helps him score on his exam (by creating a orange pair of glasses to help him cheat with tiny drones with cameras). During this scene, Johnny swats at the drones and Dicky is temporarily unable to see the answers on his paper. Backup drones fly out and they fly towards Mr. Cao, whose glasses lenses get broken as Johnny and a female classmate both swat at the fly-drones. In P.E class (with dream CJ7 constructing a pair of red boots with special powers), he outdoes his classmates in various sports scenes. Eventually, policemen and teachers including Mr. Cao and Ms. Yuen to try and subdue his superhuman powers. He jumps high into the sky thanks to the springs on his shoes. He then jumps off a flying eagle and sees a big cloud in the shape of CJ7.\nUpon waking up, Dicky tries to relive his expectations and demands for CJ7 to carry out the tasks again, but CJ7 is unable to be of help. CJ7 does not understand what Dicky asks of him and defecates on his hand, which Dicky has to deal with during his exam. The class bully jeers at him for holding a stool in his hand and shoves it onto Dicky's face. Later, Dicky expresses his anger towards CJ7 and claims he wants to kill it by forcing it to drown in the toilet bowl. He demands CJ7 to help him fix his sports shoes, but out of stress and fear, it projectile defecates onto Dicky. Then in P.E class, Dicky is being hosed down by the schools' gardeners in front of his class and his P.E teacher. His teacher says he brings great shame to the school for his dirtied uniform as his classmates laugh at him. After school, Dicky lures CJ7 from behind a tree, telling it how much he loves it until it is coaxed out. He uses a bag to entrap CJ7 and catches it. Dicky pulls CJ7 out and angrily tells it how it is a useless space dog and only caused trouble for him at school. He tosses it into the garbage bin but soon after questioning his own behaviour admits his own faults, rushing back to try and recover CJ7 from the bin. Dicky finds that the trash has been emptied by a garage truck to his dismay and tries to chase after the truck to save CJ7 but is already too late. Going home, he is dejected and sad to have lost CJ7. Dicky cheers up and runs to hug CJ7, apologizing and saying how much he misses it after seeing Ti sitting with it.\nTi is in awe as to how \"high tech\" CJ7 is as a play toy, twisting and pulling it to admire its malleability as Dicky watches in great discomfort, with CJ7 writhing and squealing in pain. Dicky begs his father to stop yanking its body around as he has to return his toy to a classmate, lying that he borrowed it. Later in that same night, as Ti and Dicky are asleep, CJ7 wakes up from the cooking pan it was resting in to repair the electric fan that Ti bought, fixing and turning the fan on with its special antenna. It is exhausted and uses up its energy as the ball inside the antenna becomes red. The next morning, Dicky goes to school with CJ7 in his backpack.\nWhen a group of students see the alien with Dicky they forcibly take it and try to cut it with tools but nothing seems to work. At last they try to use a drill and Dicky jumps on them. CJ7 scurries into some nearby bushes. Dicky tries to hit one of the students but a fat boy stops him who in turn is stopped by Maggie. They are all punished for fighting and demanded to explain the situation. When the teacher, Mr. Cao, leaves, CJ7 comes out from hiding and Dicky gets it to perform tricks for the other students and they are awed. Dicky thanks Johnny for not letting Mr. Cao know about CJ7. They shake hands and agree to not let the adults know about it and buy the group one.\nAt the construction site, Ti randomly shows everyone Dicky's test paper in which he scored 100 until his boss tells him that Dicky changed the marks from 0 to 100 and is a cheater. Then Ti threatens his boss that if he continues saying his son cheated he will hit him. This results in a fight that leads to Ti running off while his boss shouts after him that he is fired. Ti meets Dicky at home and gets angry with him for lying. He takes CJ7 from him and shoves it into his messenger bag, saying he does not get to play with CJ7 since he does not work hard so this upsets Dicky. When Dicky tells Ti to leave him alone, he promises he will if Dicky can score more than 60 on his own.\nThe following day, Ti comes to Dicky's school to give him his lunchbox. There he meets Ms. Yuen, who offers to help Dicky study. He shakes her hand gratefully and leaves on his bike as Ms. Yuen watches on before leaving. Ti goes back to his boss and apologizes; his boss apologises for calling his son a cheater in front of the other workers. He gives him his job back and his salary as well as a bonus (inside a red packet) so that Ti may buy Dicky new textbooks. Ti remarks of his great luck to the woman operating the lift on his way up to the building he is working on but is shut off with her sliding door. During work, an accident happens with Ti knocking some canisters over, trapping Ti's legs with ropes and pulling him close to the edge. Ti attempts to grab onto a bamboo pole for dear life and a worker asks where his safety harness is. Ti is unable to retrieve it and in doing so loses grip on the bamboo, falls down further to grip some mesh netting, suspended by the canister's weight. Another worker in a lower floor sees him and tries to help by telling Ti to stretch his free hand out along with other workers. Unfortunately, Ti cannot reach his hand and the netting tears apart. Ti falls to his death from the building's scaffolding.\nBack at school, Ms. Yuen calls Dicky from his classroom just as he gets his test result in which he scores 65. Dicky is seen sitting at the hospital, clutching onto his paper as he looks on the scene between the doctor, Ti's boss and Ms. Yuen in the door window near him. She goes home with Dicky and tearfully breaks the news to him that his father has passed away. Dicky begins to cry; telling her to leave and pushes her out and locks the house door to sob. In his bawling state, Dicky says that Ti will come back tomorrow and apologises to Ms. Yuen, telling her he is going to sleep as she listens on outside, sliding down to a sitting position as she cries with him out of sympathy.\nCJ7, still in the messenger bag which is now under the table on which Ti's dead body is lying, wriggles out of the bag and uses its repairing powers on Ti's body, even though it knows it will take its full power and it will die.\nThe next morning Dicky finds Ti sleeping next to him. Ti awakes and questions why he is still in his uniform. Dicky rushes to embrace his father and sobs that he will be a good son, repeating Ti's words on not cheating, lying and stealing and to do well at school. They share a loving moment. Then, CJ7 crawls out exhaustedly out of Ti's messenger bag and lies on the bed, powerless and drained from using all its energy on Ti's rejuvenation from the night before. The ball inside his antenna falls and disintegrates, and he transforms into a small doll with cross eyes. They try many ways (using batteries, electric shock and injecting glucose) to get CJ7 back but are unsuccessful.\nIn the end, it is shown that everything is back to normal. A scene in a park unfolds; the fat boy is in love with Maggie who is in love with Dicky who is in love with another girl who is taken by the bully, Johnny. Ti is in love with Ms. Yuen but is \"not funny enough\" for her. Dicky wears the alien doll as a neck pendant all the time, hoping that it to come back to life when he closes his eyes, counting to three and opens them. He hears a whimpering sound, only to find a small white dog to be the source of the sound. The dog is quickly lifted away by a classmate. Dicky is sad that CJ7 is still not alive.\nIn the end, Dicky sees a UFO descending onto the bridge in front of him.

Bob has promised his son, Kit-kit, and his sister, Jeannie, that he will meet them at an airport, before Kit-kit boards a flight to Australia.\nWhile talking to Grace on his cellular phone, Bob agrees to help Grace and hands his phone to patrol officer Fai, who believes that the distressing phone call is a prank, due to Bob's reckless driving. Grace is interrupted from the call when Fok and his men enter the room, having abducted her brother's friend, Joe. Fok forces Grace to contact her brother, Roy. After listening to Roy's answering machine, Fok kills Joe and leaves with his men, now planning to go after Grace's daughter, Tinker. Grace persuades Bob to head to the school and find her daughter before Fok's men do.  When Bob arrives, he is distracted by the school's headmaster, and minutes before the school's class dismissal, he finds Tinker too late, when she is abducted by Fok's men. Bob goes after the abductors, but winds up losing sight of them in the struggle. After crashing through a truck, Bob later finds a handgun left in his car by a fellow debt collector.\nRealizing that his phone has a low battery, Bob heads to a phone store to buy a cell phone charger. After losing his patience with the flirty service clerk, he holds the store at gunpoint and pays for the charger.  After Bob is caught on camera at both the school and the phone store, Fai heads to Grace Wong's residence.  He is still convinced that the kidnapping situation is a prank, having talked to Michelle, a woman impersonating Grace. Fok then decides to go after Grace's brother, Roy, who is in a hospital.\nFai decides to call Grace's house, after realizing the real Grace Wong is a Mandarin-language speaker, while the impersonator he met speaks Cantonese. At the hospital, Bob manages to distract Grace's abductors, who are revealed by police to be Interpol agents. The agents, however, succeed in kidnapping Roy and take him to a hill where he has hidden a camcorder. Bob intervenes, grabbing a hold of the camera and fleeing from the agents; unfortunately, he loses connection with Grace.\nFai heads to Grace's house, where he confronts and kills Michelle, realizing she was also an Interpol agent working for Fok. As Grace tries to contact Bob, she is caught by one Fok's henchmen. Grace kills the henchman and manages to find her daughter. However, while planning to escape, Grace and Tinker are caught by Fok. Bob looks at the evidence on the camcorder. The footage, captured by Roy, reveals Fok brutally executing several American drug dealers and stealing their contraband, exposing them all as dirty cops. Bob calls Fok, and tells them to meet him at the airport in an exchange for the evidence and the hostages, while attempting to keep his promise to his son.\nAt the airport, Bob's plans to meet his sister and son are foiled as Fok conveniently stands between them and Bob's hiding place. After telling Fok to go towards the parking lot, he demands that Grace, Roy and Tinker be released. They flee to a patrol car that is also in the lot. Unfortunately, Bob is caught by Fok and his men, and fights against them until Fai catches up to them. Fok and his men are arrested by Detective Cheung and his Serious Crimes Unit. After Bob hands the videotaped evidence over to Detective Cheung, Fok and Tong, one of Fok's henchman, appear, and Cheung reveals that he was working with Fok. Fok deletes the footage on the videotape, and a violent confrontation ensues in a loading dock in the airport where Fai and Bob take on Fok, Cheung and the corrupt Interpol agents. Cheung is shot to death by Fai after attacking the patrol officer with a forklift truck.\nBob confronts Fok on a scaffolding. After Bob reveals he still has videotaped evidence on his cell phone and threatens to send it to the police, Fok kicks Bob off the scaffolding. A net manages to save Bob's fall, but sends Fok falling to his death. While this was going on, a member of Fok's team rekidnaps Grace and her family and prepares to kill them, but Grace manages to defend her family long enough for the police to arrive. When Bob returns, Fai talks to him, feeling the glory he once had as a police officer, and wishing that they never meet again after their ordeal.  Bob then meets Grace for the first time in person. Grace thanks him, and Bob concludes their meeting by saying, \"If you're gonna call for help, no thanks! If you want dinner, then I'll consider.\" Bob is then reunited with his son, who is happy that his father kept his promise.", "tmdb_plot": "A debt collector receives a call from a woman who is kidnapped by an unknown gang.

David manages to get her off him and has to fix Peter's now bloody and broken nose after tying her to the bed frame. The pair hold her for ransom in a secluded country cottage. Things begin to go wrong when Arnie's dimwitted son and stepbrother of Tracey, Andrew, delivers the ransom. Instead of money, the bag is filled with napkins. David and Peter realize that not only have they been deceived, but Arnie knew about Andrew's involvement in the scheme all along.\nAfter Peter breaks David's phone by accidentally dropping it in water, David goes down to the village to use a telephone box to call in another ransom. While there, he happens across some sinister locals who, upon learning that he and his companions are staying at the Barnarby Cottage, warn him to keep his doors locked and not to wander. Disturbed, David returns to the cottage to find that Tracey \u2014 who has proven to be highly intelligent and resourceful, albeit foul-mouthed and somewhat psychopathic \u2014 has incapacitated Andrew and abducted Peter.\nSome distance away, Peter and Tracey arrive at an ominous-looking farm. Upon entering the house, they soon discover it to be the home of an insane and hideously deformed serial killer known only as the Farmer.\nAfter opening a trapdoor in the kitchen to reveal a secret staircase leading down into the cellar, Tracey is stabbed through the stomach by the Farmer. Terrified, Peter flees upstairs and jumps out of the bedroom window. Tracey survives her injury and calls out for Peter to help her escape, too, with the Farmer in pursuit. Peter incapacitates the Farmer with a shovel, saving Tracey's life. Tracey then urges Peter to kill the madman before he regains consciousness, but he is reluctant.\nAs the two of them argue, the Farmer comes to and quickly amputates the end of Peter's foot with the shovel. As he is about to kill Peter, Tracey begins mocking him, ordering him to hurry up and do it. Frustrated, the Farmer suddenly turns around and gruesomely decapitates her at mouth-level with the shovel. He then knocks out a hysterical Peter and hangs him by his jacket from a meat hook in the shed.\nMeanwhile, Andrew and David discover Andrew's hairdresser Steven, dying from being disemboweled before setting off through the woods in search of Peter and Tracey, when they stumble across the dead body of one of Arnie's henchmen, who has had his throat slit. Soon after, they arrive at the farm, where they discover a shed full of severed heads. David and Andrew hurry outside, where the Farmer pins David to the ground with a pickaxe through his leg. He then chases Andrew into the nearby horse stables, where he viciously attacks him with a hunting knife before ripping his spine out.\nPeter comes to and manages to release himself from the hook and crawl across the ground to David. After making up for a lifetime of squabbling, they vow to fight on and drag themselves back into the farmhouse in search of a phone. The Farmer soon reappears, tossing Andrew's severed head and spine through the window. David attempts to defend his brother, only to be suddenly impaled by The Farmer with the pickaxe. Outraged at seeing his brother murdered, Peter begins to throttle the Farmer to death by strangling him with a length of rope.\nThe Farmer manages to toss Peter down into the cellar and slam the door shut. But Peter still has the end of the rope, and he continues tugging on it, eventually causing the Farmer to collapse on top of the trap door.

Ratter brought Paul along as a get-up to convince the crew to take over Leo's business turf, especially Ged, who is the crew's boss. When Paul starts talking about how much money they could make, the crew gets interested, but when Ged arrives and Paul and Ratter tries to pitch the sale to Ged, he doesn't buy into it. Ged is old-school when it comes to his crimes, and he won't mix in with the drug business because he knows that drugs is always the most riskiest of crimes; people always get caught or end up dead. Ged won't have anything to do with drugs, and throws Paul out of the bar. He wants to just stick with his truck heists, and he displays his disappointment in Ratter.\nGed meets up with Jimmy, the driver that was in the dummy truck. Jimmy provides info to Ged about his truck routes and shipments and gets a cut in on the deal. Jimmy's truck company is unaware because Ged and his crew always makes the robbery authentic, even knocking out Jimmy and his co-driver. Jimmy tells Ged that there will be three shipments going out soon from his company, the new PlayStations, about 20-30 thousand of them per truck. They decide to let the first two shipments go so that the company won't be alerted, and to rob the third and last shipment. Jimmy gives Ged all the info; routes, times, destination, etc. He also warns Ged that these shipments will all have GPS on them, and that they will have about ten minutes to carry out the heist before the company calls it in. Jimmy tells Ged that since this is a huge heist that he's giving to Ged and his crew, that he wants to be square away with him, and that he wants out after this last heist. Ged tells him that if the heist goes good, he'll think about it, as Ged, too, wants to get out of the game.\nAt a barbecue that is being hosted by Ged and Debbie at their home, the whole crew is there with their wives and children. Ged tells the crew about the PlayStation job; and also informs the crew that Franner (Francis), is looking for who killed Leo, as well as hosting Leo's funeral. Franner is apparently a big-time crime boss, on top of the underworld game, and Leo was one of his big guys in the business. Pam and Keith arrive at the party as well, on the invitation of Deb. Ged is distressed about this, as he doesn't want Keith and Pam, who appears to be legit businesspeople, to mix in with the crew. However, an intoxicated Ratter, upon talking to Keith, finds out about Ged's land investment. This leads to tension, with Keith and his wife leaving the party after only being there for a few minutes. They invite Ged and his wife to a party at their house that they're having next week before they leave. Ratter confronts Ged about his land deal that he has on the side that he's keeping from the crew, and after much taunting, Ged knocks out Ratter.\nMobey, a member of the Brennan crew, has his son's communion coming up that he and his wife are preparing for, and annoys the crew with reminders for them to attend. The communion is on the 20th day of the month. Mobey visits a gentlemen's club frequently, that is owned by a Serbian criminal that is in the drug business, Lepi. Mobey has an outstanding tab at the club for 900 pounds, and Lepi's man, Dusan, brings it up to Mobey's attention. Ratter and Paul are also in the club, because they want to land a deal with Lepi to take over Leo's business; which Lepi was Leo's biggest customer. Instead of the supplier dealing directly with the customer, they want to be the middleman, which was what Leo was. However, they need Lepi to front up the money for them to buy the drugs from the supplier, which is the \"Irishman\", Dermot. Ratter tries to get a business trade for the front-money by telling Lepi about the PlayStation job; but when Lepi finds out that his brother, Ged, isn't okay with the drug deal, Lepi doesn't want to do business. However, even without Lepi in on it, Ratter is sure that he can get him on board later on, and tells Paul to set up a meeting with the Irishman anyway. As Paul and Ratter are leaving, they see Mobey there. Mobey tells the two to forget about the whole drug deal because Ged is against it, and they pretend as if they have.\nRatter and Paul drive to a warehouse, where Ratter meets with the Irishman, the drug supplier. He asks Ratter if Franner knows about this, and Ratter reassures him that he will talk to Franner and that he'll get the okay. The Irishman tells Ratter that Leo's business was a big deal to handle, and that if he knows how to work the business then he'll go in on it, but that it's money upfront, and to talk to Franner first.\nMeanwhile, Franner and his man are going around the area asking Ged and his crew if they know anything about Leo's death, as well as asking Ritchie and his young crew what they know - everyone tells Franner that they are hearing that it's the Serb gang that did it. Franner tells his man to keep an eye on Ritchie; which Ritchie informs Franner about the PlayStation heist coming up, because he gets paid by Franner for info.\nMobey gets beat up by Lepi's man, Dusan, at the club over the 900 pound tab that is still outstanding, and Ged gets a call about it when he's at the Thompson's party. Deb is upset over the loyal attention that Ged has to give the crew, and when he leaves to go see Mobey, Deb and Pam go upstairs to the bedroom where they snort lines of coke and then have sex with each other. Deb has a lesbian infatuation with Pam, a mix from the cocaine and the alienation she feels from Ged as the crime business seems to be taking its toll on him. Ged goes to Lepi to square away their two men's beef.\nBefore Ged goes to Lepi's club, Ratter and Paul are there first. They try to make a deal with Lepi again for him to front up the money so that they can get the drugs from the Irishman, the supplier. In return for the upfront money, Ratter tells Lepi that he will give him what he wants - Ged Brennan and his crew. Just then, Dusan tells him that Ged is outside and wants to see him. Paul starts flipping out, worrying that Ged is on to them, and keeps on trying to find a back door exit because Ged is outside the front door. Ratter keeps trying to calm Paul down, who is getting hysterical. Outside, Ged tells Lepi that it ends two ways, either they have an all out war with their crews, or their men go at it one-on-one. Lepi agrees that their men go at it one on one, and they arrange to meet at 8 o'clock in the morning the next day. After Ged leaves, Lepi flips out on Dusan for having Mobey beaten up over a 900-pound tab. He also tells Ratter and Paul to get out, that they don't have a deal with him.\nAt the funeral that is being hosted by Franner, Mobey is not allowed to drink at all because of his one-on-one fight in the morning with Dusan. Ged even sends him home early so that he can get rest up, but instead Mobey goes to one of the prostitutes that he frequently visits for one of his many fetishes. At the funeral reception, Franner makes it clear that he will find out who killed Leo and that he will avenge his death. Ratter asks Franner for his approval to take over Leo's business, which Franner gives him the okay for; despite asking him if Ged was in also, and Ratter telling him no. Ged sees Franner and Ratter talking and becomes suspicious and weary of the both of them.\nGed picks up Mobey in the morning and they drive out to a dock, where they wait for Lepi and Dusan to show up. Ged asks Mobey if he ever wanted to do anything else, and Mobey confides in him that he wanted to open a pet shop at one time, but that as time went on he gave up that idea. Ged tells him that he's getting out of the business, that the PlayStation is his last job, and then he's getting out. Lepi and his man show up, and then Mobey and Dusan fight their one-on-one, with Mobey winning. After Lepi's man is beaten, with the deal being that the tension is \"over\" between the two crews after their men fight it out; Lepi calls Ratter to tell him that he'll accept his offer and front him the money.\nDuring Mobey and Dusan's fight, Pam and Keith are at Ged's house. Keith tells Deb that it's the last day for the land investment, and that all of the investors have to have the money in by noon. Deb tries to call Ged, who does not answer his phone because of the fight going on, so instead Deb gives Keith all of their money that they have in the house, which was 108,000 pounds. Deb and Pam goes upstairs to celebrate the deal by having sex and doing lines of coke again. Ged comes home and sees that the safe is empty and wakes up an intoxicated Deb. He is suspicious, and drives over to the Thompson's house, where the whole house is emptied except for a bottle of champagne. Deb and Ged realizes that they were scammed, and that the Thompson's were planning it for months, a wife and husband team that shafted them; clearly something that they are professionals in.\nGed tells Jimmy that he needs to move up the heist and that he's going to take one of the early truck shipments of PlayStations instead of the third one. He moved the date up to the 20th, which is Mobey's son's communion date. Ged gathers his men together to tell them about the new date and apologizes to Ratter about what happened at the barbecue. He then gets a phone call from Franner to meet him.\nHe meets up with Franner and two of his men in the woods, and they are beating Ritchie, who is nailed to a tree trunk by his hands. Ged tells the men to let Ritchie go. Franner tells Ritchie to tell Ged what he told him, which was that Ratter had him (Ritchie) kill Leo. Ged doesn't believe it and points his gun at Ritchie and then at Franner; which Franner and his men have their guns aimed at Ged as well. Ged is distraught because he knows that Ratter will be killed, and he tells Franner that he saw him give Ratter the nod at the funeral reception, that he gave Ratter the okay; which Franner replies that he gave him the okay for the business, not to kill Leo. Franner then asks Ged if he's his brother's keeper, which Ged remorsely says no. Franner tells Ged that the Serbs will be involved as well, and that it will be a whole big mess. Ged confides to Franner that he has to do the job because he was scammed out of all his money on the \"land deal\", that he had checked up on Keith and Pamela, and they seemed legit; and he felt that he was losing his touch. Franner asks him who scammed him, and Ged tells him that it was a husband-and-wife team, and the guy went by the name of Keith Thompson. Franner tells Ged again not to do the job, and then leaves him there with Ritchie, for Ged to kill him. Ged is distraught over having to kill Ritchie, especially since Ritchie keeps pleading with him, telling him that he's just a young kid; but Ged has to kill him because he was the one that killed Leo, and Franner is going to kill Ratter.\nOn the 20th, Ged and his men wait for Jimmy's truck, which is a last-minute change for the crew. Everyone is there except for Ratter, and Ged tells one of his guys, George, that Ratter isn't coming. In flashbacks, it shows Ged and Jimmy planning out the heist, and Jimmy telling Ged that the truck company will be sending out dummy trucks as well. Ged tells Jimmy that he wants all the info on the dummy trucks as well as the shipment trucks. When his crew sees Jimmy's truck, they hijack it, beating up the co-driver, and knocking out Jimmy after they open the trailer, which is loaded with PlayStations, to the relief of Ged.\nRatter and Paul go to meet Franner and the Irishman. When they are all standing before each other, Franner confronts Ratter about Leo's death, which Paul panics and runs, but the Irishman shoots him dead with a sniper rifle, and then Franner shoots Ratter in the head at close range with a pistol. Meanwhile, Franner's men and Lepi and his men are trying to hijack the same truck, which they think is the PlayStation job as they only knew the details from the original information that Ged gave to his crew; which Ratter gave to Lepi, and Ritchie told to Franner, but it turns out to be one of the dummy trucks instead. Franner's men kills all of the Serbian crew, including Lepi, and then Franner's man calls him to tell him that the truck was a dummy.\nFranner meets Ged at Mobey's son's communion party, where Franner gives Ged a piece of paper and tells him to take care of himself, knowing that Ged wanted out. The piece of paper is information to the location of \"Keith and Pamela\".

She reveals that Mr. Gateau made it as a memorial for those who lost their sons in World War I, including his own son. Daisy then asks Caroline to read aloud from Benjamin Button's diary.\nOn the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and maladies of an elderly man. His mother, Caroline, dies soon after childbirth and his father, wealthy manufacturer Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Caretaker Queenie and cook Mr. Tizzy Weathers find the baby, and she raises him as her own, naming him Benjamin. As the years pass, Benjamin physically blends in with the elderly residents but has the mind and curiosities of a child. Aging in reverse, he eventually transitions from a wheelchair to crutches and learns to walk. He befriends a visiting African Pygmy named Oti, who teaches him to look beyond the physical, and resident Mrs. Maple, who teaches him to play the piano.\nOn Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets seven-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home and they connect instantly. Later, he accepts work on the tugboat Chelsea captained by Mike Clark. Thomas Button introduces himself to Benjamin, but does not reveal his true identity. In autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew and travels around the world. He sends Daisy hundreds of postcards, and learns that she was accepted into a ballet company in New York City.\nIn Murmansk in 1941, Benjamin becomes smitten with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of a British trade minister.

The center is owned by a pharmaceutical company called Neurinos and directed by a man named Charon, with the assistance of psychiatrist Dr. Pers\u00e9phone and two security guards called CR and BR.\nOne day, a Neurinos shuttle arrives with a new scientist named Elisa, carrying a new prisoner of unknown origins who was found as the sole survivor in a shipwreck and wakes up from hypersleep severely disoriented and unable to speak. He is introduced to the other inmates: their leader C\u00e9sar; his right-hand man Lazare, who developed the ability to hold his breath to escape the gas with which the prisoners are sedated; the large and violent Moloch, who's C\u00e9sar's enforcer; the reclusive Bouddha, who has the habit of trying to murder whoever is in pain out of misguided compassion; the deranged anarchist hacker Attila; and Raspoutine, a deeply religious man who claims the new one was sent by God to save them, and starts calling him \"Saint-Georges, the Dragonslayer\", because of a tattoo on his arm.\nElisa and Pers\u00e9phone are at odds over their research methods, since the latter advocates a humanist approach to the prisoners' mental issues, while Elisa has been sent there to experiment with a new nanotechnology that directly modifies the patient's DNA, eliminating the genetic component of their antisocial behaviors. Charon asks Attila to hack into Elisa's files to discover the extent of her orders. Much to his horror, Attila finds out she's authorized to kill them all for the sake of her research.\nAs expected, Bouddha attempts to strangle Saint-Georges in order to alleviate his suffering. This leads to infighting amongst the prisoners, so they get gassed, and Bouddha becomes Elisa's first subject. She injects him with nanites and returns him to the prison hold. Bouddha is immediately wracked by unbearable pain from the nanites bonding with his DNA, but Saint-Georges is somehow able to remove them from him (from his point of view, he's removing some kind of energy creature from Bouddha and eating it), so Bouddha becomes well again and as convinced as Raspoutine that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker, so he befriends him, swearing to protect him from the others. Later, Moloch attacks Saint-Georges, but Raspoutine intervenes, causing Moloch to accidentally slit his own throat with the shiv he was holding. Gas pours in to knock the group out again, but not before Saint-Georges had run over to assist Moloch. The prison guards rush in only to discover, to their amazement, that Moloch has no wound on his throat, and is alive and well. On their way out, they inject C\u00e9sar with the nanites.\nPers\u00e9phone's assumption that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker is scoffed at by Elisa, but Moloch's own doubts prompt an increasingly debilitated C\u00e9sar to fear an impending usurping of his authority, so he commands Lazare and Moloch to get rid of Saint-Georges. While Bouddha and Raspoutine are distracted, Saint-Georges is stabbed to death by Lazare. However, while the staff is examining his corpse, Saint-Georges wakes up completely healed, grabs Elisa and uses her as a hostage to reach the prison quarters before releasing her.\nC\u00e9sar is now in severe pain from the nanites, but Saint-Georges cures him as well. Attila appears and tells the others of his plans to destroy them all out of spite, by making the space station crash into the planet, triggering the rage of the other prisoners. Attila manages to run away, only to be found later in a shaft, having hanged himself.\nWith Attila dead, the only way to save the station is to activate the manual override located under a trapdoor below the prisoner's quarters. The prisoners agree to let the staff through, but Elisa refuses to accompany the others inside the prisoner area. As all the station inhabitants work together to open the hatch, the gas goes off, knocking everyone but Lazare out.\nElisa prepares to escape via shuttle, but Lazare ambushes her, forcing her to let him in the shuttle as well. As the others awaken, one of the guards finds out about Elisa's betrayal, but also that Attila had messed with the shuttle controls as well, resulting in the shuttle burning through the planet's atmosphere. After having finally opened the hatch, the group finds the cooling system overheated so now the corridor that leads to the manual controls is filled with boiling coolant. C\u00e9sar realizes he is the only one slight enough to fit into the little space, and volunteers to descend, wrapped in some protective fabrics.

Watching all these events from the outside the middle of the religious festival happening in the street, Jasmine goes near the idol and looks for a minute to get the idol on hand, while suddenly, an elephant who is a part of the religious festival is inadvertently freed by Fletcher, who shoots the elephant to distract Naidu, and it goes mad with total chaos in the street. In the chaos, the elephant gets hold of Jasmine and throws her. She gets impaled on a blade on the wall. Knowing that her injuries are too fatal, Fletcher in an urge to get hold of Govind who in the middle of the chaos took the idol with him shoots Jasmine. Andal desperately runs behind Govind for getting back the Perumal idol into which Krishnaveni put the vial. Govind and Andal run away from Fletcher with the idol with several chaos and arguments between them. Her anger about taking the idol away from Chidambaram and him being worried about saving the vial from Fletcher which is into the idol now. They arrive at a ground where illegal sand miners are working. The miners try to molest Andal, but Govind defeats them and they sneak out after the interference of Vincent Poovaraghan, a social activist, and drive away from the place with one of the trucks that belong to the miners. Andal in an urge to get back to Chidambaram, forces Govind to turn the vehicle and they end up crashing a van opposite that has a large Muslim family. Andal and Govind recover from the truck and saves the family where an unnaturally tall man named Khalifulla is seen. Khalifulla's mother faints suddenly and is taken to a hospital, where Govind procures a cooling box to store the idol, as it is unstable and its temperature needs to be maintained. Avtar Singh is also there with his family for the treatment of his throat cancer. His prescription drugs are in a similar-looking box and before leaving the hospital, his family unknowingly switches it with Govind's box. Govind unaware of this goes to the police station to let them know of all the chaos happening.\nKnowing this meanwhile Fletcher who spots Andal in the hospital takes Andal and Kalifulla's family hostage in their house, and Govind is blackmailed to bring back the box he is carrying. With no choice, he reaches the place only to discover that Avatar must have the vial box as the medicine box is with him. The police surround the house, and Fletcher forcefully takes away, Govind and Andal, and a small boy from the Muslim family to flee in a jeep. Shingen Narahazi (who mistakes Govind as the killer after being misled by Balram) follows them. Avatar finishes his last performance and meanwhile, Fletcher along with Govind, Andal, and the boy reaches the place for getting the box that contains the idol. In a fight between Fletcher and Govind in the place to take away the idol, Avatar is shot by Fletcher. While Avatar's wife pulls Fletcher and fights in anger for shooting her husband, Andal runs away with her idol and Govind goes behind her.\nGovind and Andal flee to reach a construction site, where a chasing happens between Fletcher who reaches as soon. In the chaos and chase, the vial from the idol comes out and Govind gets hold of it. Fletcher who is unaware of this catches Govind at a point and Govind gives away the idol to Fletcher and moves from the place immediately with Andal who is unhappy that Govind has given away her idol to Fletcher. The sun dawns on 26 December 2004 and Govind gets an idea from some drainage workers to immerse the virus in a large quantity of salt to destroy it. He goes to the beach, only to be stopped by Fletcher who finds out the vial is not inside the idol. Shingen Narahazi arrives and apologises to Govind for misinterpreting him as the murderer. Narahazi fights Fletcher and defeats him. During the fight, Govind gets stabbed by Fletcher. At the same time, Balram Naidu arrives in a helicopter and asks Fletcher to surrender. At the end of the moment, Narahazi asks Fletcher how he wants to die. Caught between Narahazi and Balram Naidu, Fletcher opens the vial and bites it, getting infected and vomiting blood. Govind and Balram Naidu, who is aware of the consequence, stare helplessly at the situation when suddenly, a tsunami strikes, washing away Fletcher, and causing great destruction along the coast while stopping the impact of the vial which would have destructed the entire state.  Govind, Narahazi and Andal gets into a boat on the coast.\nAfter the chaos Krishnaveni Paatti arrives later and cries after perceiving deceased Poovaraghan as her long-lost son (who had died 50 years ago). Khalifulla and his family as well as neighbors are safe as Balram took all of them into a far away Masjid for questioning. After relief measures are taken, Andal argues that God had sent forth the tsunami to get rid of the weapon. Govind responds by asking if God would destroy hundreds of lives to save millions. Later, they unite and expresses feelings for each other, while it's revealed that they're in front of the same idol of Vishnu that was submerged in the 12th century (which has ultimately been brought back from the ocean). Rangarajan Nambi's bones are seen on the idol.\nThe scene shifts to the stadium, where Avatar, who had his cancerous growth taken away by Fletcher's shot, along with all the others, listens to the speech by Govind followed by the former president George W.

It is moving at 30,000 kilometers per second, fast enough that its impact would destroy all life on Earth. The United States government hastily assembles a group of scientists, including Helen Benson and her friend Michael Granier, to develop a survival plan.\nThe scientists travel to New York City to await the object's collision with Earth. As it nears the planet, the object slows down just before impact. Revealed to be a large spherical spaceship, it lands gently in Central Park and is quickly surrounded by NYPD and heavily armed US military forces. An alien emerges and Helen moves forward to greet it; but amidst the confusion, the alien is shot. A gigantic humanoid robot appears and temporarily disables everything in the vicinity by emitting a high-pitched noise before the wounded alien voices the command \"Klaatu barada nikto\" to shut down the robot's defensive response.\nThe alien's exterior is found to be a bioengineered space suit, composed of placenta-like material covering a human-like being. After the bullet is extracted during surgery, the being quickly ages into Klaatu, who looks like the mountaineer from 1928. Klaatu informs Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson that he is a representative of a group of civilizations, sent to talk to the leaders of Earth about saving the planet. When Jackson instead sends him to be interrogated, Klaatu escapes and reconnects with Helen and her stepson, Jacob, telling them that he must finish his mission to \"save the Earth\".\nThe presence of the sphere and other smaller spheres that begin to appear all over the world cause widespread panic.

The military takes a weapons-free approach, cautiously enclosing the robot, soon nicknamed \"GORT\" (for Genetically Organized Robotic Technology), and transporting it to the Mount Weather underground facility in Virginia.\nKlaatu meets with another alien, Mr. Wu, who has lived on Earth for 70 years. Wu tells Klaatu that he has found the human race to be destructive, stubborn, and unwilling to change, which matches Klaatu's experiences. Klaatu orders the smaller spheres to collect specimens of animal species, to preserve them for later reintroduction to the Earth. He clarifies for Helen that he means to save the Earth from destruction by humankind. When a New Jersey State Trooper attempts to take them into custody, Klaatu kills him and then promptly revives the officer, telling Helen and Jacob that he did this to simply disarm an obstacle to his mission.\nHoping to persuade Klaatu to change his mind about humanity, Helen takes him to the home of Professor Barnhardt, a Nobel Prize winner. They discuss how Klaatu's race went through drastic, collaborative evolution to prevent the demise of their planet. Barnhardt pleads that Earth is at the same precipice, and humanity should be given a chance to understand that it too must change. While the adults are talking, Jacob calls the authorities to come and arrest Klaatu.\nWhile the military is examining GORT, the robot transforms into a swarm of winged insect-like nano-machines that self-replicate as they consume every man-made object in their path. The swarm soon devours the entire facility, emerging above ground to continue feeding.\nThe military captures Helen while Klaatu and Jacob escape on foot.

Decades later, the sea bed surrounding the Truk Islands is still littered with the remains of more than 60 warships and airplanes.\nAmong Yamagami\u2019s crew is the cantankerous Divisional Officer Noboru Osako (Yukijiro Hotaru) and the young Ensign Takeshi Kaido (Taiyo Sugiura). Unsure of what the future may bring, Kaido went off to war without declaring his intentions for his childhood sweetheart, Chie Kojima (Mai Nanami). He always carries her photo in his coat pocket, while Chie longs for his return to their seaside hometown.\nWhen the Yamato arrives at Truk, the married Osako decides to ease his worries over leaving behind a pregnant wife by sneaking an island woman named Momoka (Yumika Hayashi) aboard ship for some private recreation. But to Osako\u2019s annoyance, Momoka brings along her elderly grandfather (Mickey Curtis) who insists on telling him a local tale about monsters that has been passed down for generations.

He encounters three thugs named Blackie (French Stewart), Bud (Kevin Farley) and Arty (Kelly Perine) who have a mistreated dog and Owen's life changes.\nUnbeknownst to Owen, the thugs have previously committed a diamond heist and supposedly hid the stolen diamonds on the dog's collar. With Owen's help, the dog escapes from the thugs and Owen bonds with the golden retriever whom he names Diamond. When he reads a newspaper account about the thugs' diamond heist, he soon realizes about how they are the chief suspects and how they hid the diamonds on Diamond.\nHe takes her to the police, but the police believe that the story is not true, thinking that Owen might be telling stories about the \"Mad Man\" making friends with a bigfoot. So Owen decides to look after Diamond. He hides her at his forest hideaway and visits her often to feed her and comfort her. Meanwhile, the thugs are searching for Owen and Diamond. They attempt to confront him personally by showing up at his house after getting the location from Dexter. Owen escapes into the woods but the thugs catch up with him just as Diamond escapes. As the thugs explore the woods he warns them about the \"Mad Man\" and shows them some of the inventions he built for the \"Mad Man\". Owen then escapes the thugs and rigs his hideaway in the forest with booby traps for them. As he heads back to his house, he is caught by the thugs again, but Owen manages to escape from their grasp. He runs into the woods with Diamond and the thugs give chase. They trace Owen to his hideaway and search the whole area from him, but end up setting  off Owen's booby traps one by one. At one point, Blackie finally catches Owen.\nThe thugs tie Owen to a chair at the hideaway, while the thugs inspect Diamond for the diamonds. Blackie notices a band-aid on Diamond's stomach that Owen previously put on her and suspects Owen did something to Diamond. When Blackie orders Owen to show him where he hid the diamonds, he leads them to a canoe trailer, which belongs to the \"Mad Man\" and claims he hid them in it. Bud and Arty jump into the canoe to find the diamonds and become glued to their seats of the canoe, as part of Owen's booby traps. But the two find the collar in the canoe and toss him to Blackie, but he becomes annoyed. He tells Owen he actually hid the stolen diamonds in Diamond's stomach and that the collar had fake diamonds on it so they could celebrate the diamond heist. Diamond becomes sick when the diamonds in her stomach fall down to her intestines. Owen lets Diamond escape from Blackie, leaving him alone to fight for himself. Before Blackie gets a chance to hurt Owen, he ends up being thrown into the canoe with Bud and Arty by the \"Mad Man of the Mountain\" and the thugs roll down the hill in the trailer into town. Along the way, they encounter Dexter riding his bike and ends up landing in a nearby trash bin where he is presumably thrown into a garbage truck.

After spending the day at the resort together, the girls are invited to the men's yacht, where they plan to party out at sea. While aboard the boat, they take drugs and the conversation turns to sex, and in particular, types of sexual acts. Bluey describes a sex act called a \"donkey punch\" which involves punching the female in the back of the head while having doggy style sex in order to increase the sexual pleasure for the man.\nMarcus, Bluey, Kim, and Lisa go to the master bedrooms, where they begin having drug-fuelled sex. They are watched by Josh who, known to all involved, lingers furtively in the darkness recording the action with a camera. Bluey, who is copulating with Lisa, asks Josh to film the action and then both of them beckon Josh to have sex with Lisa. Immediately prior to ejaculation and with Bluey's encouragement, Josh donkey punches Lisa but uses excessive force, breaking her neck and killing her instantly. To cover up the incident, the men decide to throw the body overboard while the women want to report it to the authorities, and argument ensues about what to do with the tape. Bluey continually insults Tammi and in a fit of rage, she stabs him in the chest with a knife, and the women escape in the yacht's tender. However, the girls soon realise that the tender's outboard motor is missing (a cut scene shows it still attached to the yacht). In a fit of despair, Tammi fires a flare, attracting the attention of the men. They quickly locate and pick up the women.\nAs the men attempt to get the women aboard, threatening them with a shotgun, Kim shoots a second flare directly at Marcus. The flare explodes into Marcus's torso and slowly burns him to death. Josh locks the recaptured women in one of the rooms below. Sean asks Josh to \"call in\" and request medical assistance for Bluey. However, knowing that Bluey still has the tape that contains footage of him dealing the earlier fatal blow, Josh instead decides to discover its whereabouts by torturing Bluey. He does this by withholding pain numbing drugs from him. Bluey reveals the location of the tape, beneath the bed in the state room. Tammi escapes the room by smashing through the glass door and cutting herself, and overhears Bluey mention where the tape is. She frantically roams the boat trying to locate it. She does this just moments before Josh attempts to retrieve it. Unable to find the tape, Josh returns to Bluey, stepping up the torture by turning his attention to the knife which still protrudes from the wound. Josh ultimately takes this too far and, following Bluey's pained protestations that he has already revealed the location, he twists the knife further into the wound before pulling it out, causing Bluey to die.\nSean tries to bring the situation under control by retrieving a shotgun from Josh. He then tries to calm both Josh and Tammi from a frantic argument about the whereabouts of the tape. Kim notices Sean holding a shotgun with Josh and Tammi visibly upset from an adjacent room. She misinterprets his intentions towards Tammi and Josh, and brutally kills Sean with the propeller of an outboard motor. After realizing her mistake, she manically commits suicide by jumping overboard, leaving Josh and Tammi as the only ones left. A distraught Tammi decides that she cannot remain on the boat any longer. Josh agrees, and readies the tender. His plan is to leave the yacht, get back to shore and claim that there was an accident. As Josh pushes the tender away from the yacht, Tammi quietly takes hold of the end of the mooring rope at the stern.\nOnce the tender has floated some distance from the yacht, Josh pulls his hunting knife from his shorts and points it at Tammi. He demands the incriminating tape from Tammi and, fearing for her life, she obliges, throwing it on the floor of the tender. As a distracted Josh reaches for the tape, Tammi quickly throws the looped end of the mooring rope around his neck. The rope immediately reaches the end of its tether and Josh is wrenched into the sea, snapping his neck and killing him.

Unable to contain the outbreak or cure the infected, the British government builds a massive 30-foot wall that isolated Scotland from the rest of Great Britain. Whilst the quarantine was deemed a success, the extreme method employed by the government destroys diplomatic and economic relations between the UK and the rest of the world, turning the state itself into a pariah state. This led to massive unemployment, civil unrest and extreme economic turmoil, causing the UK to collapse into a dystopia.\nIn 2035, 27 years after the start of the quarantine, a group of armed police officers discover several people in London infected with Reaper virus during a routine investigation. Prime Minister John Hatcher shares satellite footage of survivors in Scotland with domestic security chief Captain Nelson. Believing a cure may exist, Hatcher orders Nelson to send a team into Scotland to find medical researcher Dr. Kane who was working on a cure when Scotland was quarantined. Nelson chooses his top police officer, Major Eden Sinclair, to lead the team. According to Nelson, Sinclair also hails from Scotland, where she escaped from when the quarantine began at the cost of her right eye. For Sinclair the mission is also personal, as she hopes to learn if her mother survived or not.\nSinclair's team crosses the wall to Glasgow, Dr. Kane's last known location. In Glasgow, while searching the local hospital for survivors, Sinclair and her team are ambushed by a group of marauders. Sgt. Norton and Dr. Stirling manage to escape, while the team suffers heavy casualties. Sinclair and Dr. Talbot are captured by what turns out to be a huge gang of brutal cannibals, led by the power-hungry Sol, who plans to use her as leverage to cross the wall, allowing his army to start their invasion on England. He then leaves for the sacrificial ceremony to join the rest of his gang, who burn Dr. Talbot and eat him alive. With the help of Cally, another prisoner, Sinclair escapes and kills Viper, Sol's second-in-command. She meets with Norton and Stirling, and the three escape on a train. Cally reveals that she and Sol are Kane's children.\nMeanwhile, back in London, the increasingly violent riot occurs on the streets. Hatcher plans to evacuate the central London area because of the infection when one of the infected breaks into Hatcher's office and tries to kill him. Nelson shoots and kills the infected man to save Hatcher, but his infected blood suddenly splatters all over the prime minister. As a result to Hatcher's unexpected infection, he is soon quarantined by his right-hand man, Michael Canaris, who also takes his place as de facto prime minister. Hatcher later commits suicide, knowing that his exposure to the Reaper Virus means an almost-certain death sentence from the virus.\nAfter leaving the train, Sinclair's group is spotted and kidnapped by soldiers armed with archaic weapons and armour. They are taken to a medieval castle and imprisoned. Their leader, who is really Marcus Kane, tells Sinclair the truth: there is no cure\u2014only people with a natural immunity. Originally a medical researcher, he was devastated when his family was left behind during the quarantine. After losing his wife, Kane became a twisted, sadistic lord and sentences her and her group to death, pitting Sinclair against Telamon, his executioner, in a small fighting ground to entertain his followers. During the duel, Sinclair subdues and kills Telamon while the rest of the group escapes, retrieving their equipment and rescuing Sinclair.\nSinclair, Norton, Stirling and Cally escape to a fallout shelter entrance on horseback. They locate an underground facility in the forest and find an intact 2007 Bentley Continental GT. Kane's medieval knights arrive and kill Norton. Sinclair and the others drive the Bentley back to the quarantine wall. On the way, they are intercepted by Sol's gang, who seeks to avenge Viper once and for all. After a high-speed chase, Sol and many of his men are killed and Sinclair's group escape.\nUsing a phone retrieved from the fallout shelter, Sinclair calls Canaris, who later arrives in a government gunship. Canaris then tricks Sinclair into trading Cally to develop a vaccine, revealing himself as the creator of the Reaper virus, which is, in fact, a bioweapon that can spread all over the UK as both a form of population control and shady profit.\nCally and Stirling board the gunship with Canaris while Sinclair returns to her old house in search of her mother, followed by Nelson, who flew into the quarantine zone to speak with her. While Sinclair learns that her mother perished during the quarantine, she is able to retrieve a picture of her. Sinclair gives Nelson a recording of Canaris' scheme to take over the UK, the evidence that would save everyone from this state-wide pandemic once and for all. The recording is later broadcast to the rest of the country, much to Canaris' dismay as it spells doom to his career and subsequential criminal conviction, which will lead to his death penalty.\nMeanwhile, Sinclair retrieves Sol's head and returns it to his gang; she throws the head onto the ground, announcing to the marauders, \u201cIf you're hungry, try a piece of your friend\u201d.

Her sisters are told to be alert to suspicious activity in the school.\nSister James, a young and naive teacher, receives a request for Donald Miller, an altar boy and the school's only African-American student, to see Flynn in the rectory. When he returns to class he's upset and she smells alcohol on his breath. Later, she sees Flynn placing an undershirt in Donald's locker. Reporting her suspicions to Aloysius, she says such suspicions disquiet her faith. Aloysius tells her that when you address wrongdoing, you take a step away from God, but in His service.\nAloysius and James invite Flynn into the office supposedly to discuss the school's Christmas pageant. During their discussion, the women express drastically different perspectives on how the church should function with regard to the working class: Flynn believes they should relate to their parishioners more actively through shared interests and community activities, while Aloysius believes that clear boundaries set by the clergy facilitate the relationship with the parishioners.\nEventually, Aloysius brings up Donald Miller, noting that he is the only Black child in the school, at risk of being singled out. She states that even Flynn gave him special treatment, like the private meeting they had last week. He becomes defensive over her insinuations and eventually reveals he called Donald to the rectory because he had been caught drinking Sacramental wine. Flynn had been keeping it quiet to protect Donald, but now that Aloysius has forced it out, he must be removed as an altar boy. James is greatly relieved to hear the explanation.

When describing the potential abusive relationship between Donald and Flynn, she is shocked by Mrs. Miller's seeming ambivalence. Finally, the mother tearfully admits that Donald is gay, and fears his physically abusive homophobic father would kill him if he knew. She describes her difficult position: unable to protect her son from his father's violence, Flynn is the only male figure who has shown Donald any kindness. His position at the school shields him from bullies, and leaving the school now could compromise the better socioeconomic future the school can give Donald. She begs Aloysius to solve the situation by removing Flynn over Donald, but she is unsure of what she can do, given Flynn's entrenched position within the patriarchal senior clergy.\nKnowing she has spoken with Donald's mother, Father Flynn threatens to remove Aloysius from her position if she does not back down. She informs him she contacted a nun from his last parish, discovering a history of past infringements. He demands to know what proof she has, and she admits that all she has is her certainty. Flynn accuses her of insubordination and acting outside her duties. She threatens she will do whatever it takes to force him out, even if it means being thrown out of the church herself.\nDeclaring his innocence, Flynn pleads, asking if she herself has never committed a mortal sin. Aloysius rejects his claims of innocence, threatening blackmail if he does not resign immediately. Acknowledging his downfall would be inevitable should he ignore her threats, he maintains he did nothing wrong, and her own certainty of wrongdoing is fallible.

Her endeavor is encouraged by a paw print that was discovered by her older sister in a remote area of the island before her body was mysteriously found in the Pieman River several years before. Matt's friend, Jack, and his girlfriend, Rebecca, help pay for the trip and accompany the fellow couple. When they arrive, Matt sees a small girl on the boat playing a game with yellow-tinted teeth. When Matt asks what she is doing, she recites a rhyme, then bites Matt's hand. They spend a night in a dingy motel located next to a meat pie factory, meeting the eccentric and creepy locals.\nThe next day, the group goes out on a boat in the river along the forest. They decide to camp in a cave out in the woods, and later that evening Matt and Nina discover one of the Tasmanian tigers creeping through the bush. Nina rushes to get her camera to take a picture of the marsupial, but it has run into the woods. The group goes into the dark after the animal using their cell phones as light because capturing proof of its existence is critical to Nina's research. Unbeknownst to the rest of the group, Rebecca is captured and eaten by a cannibal. When the other three re-group, they realize that Rebecca is missing and that Nina has blood on her pant legs.\nDesperate to find Rebecca, the group searches through the forest. The local ferryman tries to help them but is murdered by one of the cannibals. Reaching an old mining site, they find Rebecca's remains strung up on meat-hooks and Jack is killed by an animal trap. Matt flees underground and finds grisly evidence of the cannibal's past exploits. Nina reaches a railway bridge over a fast-flowing river but is cornered by a pair of cannibals. She deliberately throws herself off the high bridge. The ferryman's wife then kills one of the cannibals and then slits her own throat after apologizing to Matt. That night, the police arrive at the hotel but there is no sign of any of the missing people. As the police depart, a sad and weary Matt prepares to leave but is suddenly attacked.\nHe is later seen paralyzed in a chair while one of the cannibals explains that their settlement, much like the Tasmanian tiger, must stay hidden to survive. The cannibal then opens a door exposing a still-living Nina tied to a table, about to be raped for breeding purposes. While Matt watches, the young girl who was actually Nina's niece approaches him, removes a set of dentures, thus exposing a set of sharp deformed teeth. As the police drive away, Nina's mobile phone (which Matt had given them) displays a photo of the Tasmanian Tiger.", "tmdb_plot": "An extinct species, the Tasmanian tiger.\r A long-forgotten legend, \u201cThe Pieman\u201d aka Alexander Pearce, who was hanged for cannibalism in 1824.\r Both had a desperate need to survive; both could have living descendants within the Tasmanian bush.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Eddington is appointed chief astronomer at Cambridge by Sir Oliver Lodge and instructed to research Einstein's work and defend the Newtonian status quo. Meanwhile, Einstein is lured back from Z\u00fcrich to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin in an attempt to aid the war effort by embarrassing Britain by disproving the work of its great scientist Isaac Newton. In Berlin, with his marriage already under tension, Einstein falls in love with his cousin Elsa.\nA Quaker and therefore unable to go to war, Eddington sets out to bid farewell to his love interest William Marston, as the latter goes off to war as an officer, but just misses Marston's train. He then presents his lecture to his fellow astronomers at the university\u2014defending Newton, but still thinking Einstein might be right\u2014and takes the German M\u00fcller family into his home after saving them from a violent anti-German mob. When Einstein's wife arrives in Berlin, she discovers Einstein's affair and leaves him, whilst Eddington faces down protesters who despise his status as a conscientious objector. Einstein arrives late at a demonstration of Fritz Haber's poison gas and is so disgusted by this application of science to murder that he rejects an offer to convert his citizenship back from Swiss to German and refuses to sign the \"Manifesto to the Civilized World\", a list of prominent German scientists, artists and academics supporting the war.\n\nEddington finds his research into Einstein's work obstructed by a British ban on the circulation of German scientific literature. Realising that Mercury's orbit is precessing slightly less than it should be according to Newton's laws, he writes to Einstein despite the ban to inquire into his view on the problem. Einstein's relationship with Elsa deepens, and on receiving Eddington's letter he starts work on this new avenue with Max Planck, whilst consoling colleague Planck on the loss of his son in the war despite Einstein's lack of belief in a human-like God or an afterlife. They find that Einstein's work agrees with Mercury's orbit where Newton's does not, and send this reply back to Eddington.\nAt the same time, Eddington grieves over Marston, among the 15,000 killed by German use of chlorine gas at the Second Battle of Ypres, causing doubts in his faith, but leading him to fight all the more loudly against an expulsion of German scientists from the Royal Society. The expulsion has been initiated by Lodge, whose son was also among the killed and who clings to Newton as a consolation of \"order in the universe\", but Eddington is unable to admit to Lodge that he too is grieving for a loved one.\nNews of the gas attack also leads Einstein to an outburst against his fellow scientists, which leads to his being cut off from the university, and\u2014overworking\u2014he falls sick and Elsa leaves him. Even so, he manages to complete his work on general relativity and on how starlight bends and gets this result through to Eddington via Planck. Eddington realises he can prove that space and light are being bent by observing the solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 on the west African island of Pr\u00edncipe, and with Dyson as an ally, manages to gain funding for his expedition, despite Lodge's initial opposition. As the war ends, Eddington's sister and housekeeper, Winifred, sets off to help the Quaker relief effort in war-shattered Germany despite her fears as to Eddington's waning faith.\nThe action returns to the Pr\u00edncipe expedition, delayed by bad weather until the last moment, while Einstein briefly returns to his ex-wife and children. Bringing back two photographs from the eclipse to compare to photographs of the night sky in normal conditions, Eddington compares them in public, with Lodge and Winifred in attendance, and not only proves Einstein right but also finds this confirmation reaffirming his faith\u2014as he states, \"I can hear God, thinking\". News of his vindication reaches Einstein, and crowds of press arrive at his door just as Elsa returns to him.  A year later, in the closing scene, Einstein visits Cambridge and meets Eddington.

For years, Niko has dreamed of joining his father in the Flying Forces, but he himself is unable to fly and even has a fear of heights. While trying to fly with the encouragement of Julius, a flying squirrel, the other young reindeer teased Niko. To avoid further teasing, Niko and his friend Saga leave their protected valley so Niko can practice without any disruptions. However, they are spotted by wolves and flee back to the herd in panic, but wind up luring the wolf pack to the valley. As the herd flees, Saga's father, the herd's leader battles and defeats a wolf, but is wounded in the process. Later, Niko overhears others talking of how his actions have damaged the herd, and decides to leave the herd in an attempt to find his father and Santa's Fell.\nWhen Niko is discovered missing, Julius chooses to look for Niko, since he can search without leaving a trail as fresh snow is falling. Once he finds him, Julius is unable to convince Niko to return to the herd, and reluctantly joins him in the search for Santa's secret location. Meanwhile, Essie, a lost pet poodle, stumbles upon the wolf pack and is about to be eaten, but suggests to Black Wolf, the alpha wolf, the idea of killing Santa's reindeer. Essie is considered Black Wolf's good luck charm for this idea and is spared, but is also forced to join the pack. Niko and Julius discover Wilma, a weasel, stuck in a small tree branch and rescue her. She reluctantly joins Niko and Julius, believing she is indebted to them. Julius and Niko later get separated in a sudden blizzard and Niko wakes up under a pile of snow, unnoticed by the nearby wolf pack. Niko overhears Black Wolf resolving to kill Santa as well and take his place so he could also eat children.\nWhen Niko is discovered, he flees and finds Julius, but the two are cornered between rock cliffs. Wilma saves them by triggering an avalanche with her singing, then guides Niko and Julius to safety. She then continues to follow them, since she knows the way to Santa's home due to having previously worked there as a singer. Eventually, Niko tries to cross a dangerous river by flying with Wilma's help, but fails and falls once he looks down. Thinking they are dead, the wolves head for Santa's home. At the same time, Julius and Wilma save Niko from going over a high waterfall.\nWhile waiting for Niko to recover, Julius recounts how his real family was taken by wolves, and says that he has viewed Niko like a son now. Once they arrive at Santa's place, Niko is almost hit by the Flying Forces while standing on the runway. Niko tells them of Black Wolf's plan, but they doubt a wolf would discover Santa's secret valley. As they celebrate at their bar before heading out on Christmas Eve, Wilma sings them a song that asks them the identity of Niko's father. None of the reindeer respond, but they decide to do a \"flying test\" to see if Niko has the genetics to fly and thus prove if his claim is true. Upon realizing the potential danger of this, Julius yells at Niko while he is in midflight, so he falls again but is saved by Dasher. After this, the wolves find their way into the valley and the scared reindeer lose their power of flight. Black Wolf chooses to pursue Niko and corners him up a tall tree.\nMeanwhile, as the other reindeer are cornered on the runway by the other wolves, Julius convinces the reindeer that they can fly, allowing them to save Niko using the sleigh. Black Wolf latches onto the sleigh, but Julius dislodges the part he is holding on to. In order to save Julius from falling as well, Niko jumps off the sleigh, only to realize that he can finally fly, and successfully saves Julius as Black Wolf falls to his seeming death.

In 1961, when NASA was putting a monkey named Enos aboard Mercury Atlas 5, astronaut Yuri Gagarin became the first person to go to space. Feeling the sense of urgency to overtake the Soviets in the space race, U.S. President John F. Kennedy made a statement toward a joint session of Congress on May 25, 1961, stating that before the decade is out, he plans to launch a man to the Moon and return him safely to the Earth.\nEight years later, in 1969, an 11-year-old fly named Nat and his two best friends, I.Q. and Scooter, build a \"fly-sized\" rocket in a field across from Cape Canaveral, Florida, where Apollo 11 sits on the Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39. From his earliest memory, Nat's grandfather, Amos, often tells him of his many adventures such as his daring rescue of Amelia Earhart when she crossed the Atlantic Ocean on her historic 1932 solo flight. Wanting to be an adventurer like his grandpa, Nat tells his friends his plan to get aboard Apollo 11 and go to the Moon. They, with some reluctance, are in. The next morning, the three flies make it in to Launch Control and stow away inside the space helmets of astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins. Moments later, Flight Director Gene Kranz in Houston's Mission Control Center gives the go for launch. As the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere and reaches its Earth parking orbit, Nat, Scooter and IQ's mothers faint upon hearing from Grandpa that their sons will be in space for a week.\nGrandpa, Nat's mother, and the others watch TV to get news of their offspring's adventure. As the astronauts appear on camera, the heroic flies wave in the background, visible to other flies but barely seen by humans \u2013 except for the attentive NASA flight controller Steve Bales, who informs Armstrong of the \"contaminants\" on board. In the Soviet Union, there are other flies watching TV \u2013 Soviet flies who cannot tolerate the idea that American flies might get to the Moon first. Special Soviet operatives are enlisted to interfere with the American mission, including an operative named Yegor. Fortunately, Nadia, a Soviet fly, hears Scooter calling out the name of Amos, who she met in Paris and loved many years ago.\nOnboard the Command Module Columbia, as the burn cycle to enter the Moon's trans-lunar injection orbit begins, the spacecraft is violently rocked. There's a short circuit in the service module that must be fixed manually or the ship won't be able to complete its mission. Nat and I.Q. fly through a maze of wires, find the problem, and repair it just in time. Unaware of the flies' aid, the ship enters orbit and the astronauts perform the maneuver to turn Columbia around to dock with the Lunar Module Eagle and pull it away from the spent S-IVB rocket. Just as the flies congratulate each other, they are sprayed with a numbing aerosol and held captive in a test tube.\nThe flies manage to break the vial. Nat sneaks into Armstrong's helmet as he enters Eagle, which lands on Mare Tranquillitatis. From inside Armstrong's helmet, Nat beams with every awe-inspiring historic step.

Among those watching is British journalist David Frost, who is recording a talk show in Australia at the time, and who decides that day to interview Nixon.\nNixon's literary agent, Irving Lazar, believes the interviews would be an opportunity for Nixon to salvage his reputation and profit financially. Lazar demands $500,000 and ultimately secures $600,000 after Frost accepts.\nAfter persuading his friend and producer John Birt that the interviews could be a success, Frost travels with Birt to California to meet with Nixon. On board the plane, Frost flirts with a young woman named Caroline Cushing, and the pair begin a relationship as she tags along for the trip.\nFrost struggles to sell the interviews to American networks, and decides to finance the project with private money. He brokers his own deals with advertisers and local TV stations to syndicate the broadcast of the interviews. He and Birt hire two investigators \u2014 Bob Zelnick and James Reston Jr. \u2014 to help Frost prepare. Frost is unsure as to what he wants from the interviews; Reston encourages him to aim for a confession from Nixon.\nUnder scrutiny by Nixon's post-presidential chief of staff, Jack Brennan, Frost and Nixon embark on the first three recording sessions. Frost is restricted by an agreed-upon timeframe and, under pressure from his own team, attempts to ask tough questions. However, Nixon dominates the sessions regarding the Vietnam War and his achievements in foreign policy. Behind the scenes, Frost's editorial team is nervous about Frost's capacity as a journalist and angry that Nixon appears to be exonerating himself.\nFour days before the final interview, which will focus on Watergate, Frost receives a phone call from an inebriated Nixon. In a drunken rant, Nixon declares that they both know the final interview will make or break their careers. He compares himself to Frost, insisting that they both came from humble backgrounds and had to struggle to make it to the top of their fields, only to be knocked back down again. Frost gains new insight into his subject, while Nixon assures Frost that he will do everything in his power to emerge the victor of the final interview.\nThe conversation spurs Frost into action. For the next three days, he works relentlessly to prepare as Reston pursues a lead at the Federal Courthouse library in Washington.\nAs the final interview begins, Frost ambushes Nixon with damning transcripts of a conversation between Nixon and Charles Colson that Reston dug up in Washington. As his own team watches in horror from an adjoining room, Nixon admits that he did unethical things, adding, \"When the President does it, that means it's not illegal.\" A stunned Frost is on the verge of inducing a confession when Brennan bursts in and stops the recording. After Nixon and Brennan confer, the interview resumes.

Frost thanks Nixon for the interviews and Nixon, graciously admitting defeat, thanks Frost in return and wishes him well.

There is constant pressure on the King both from the Yuan emperor and his own counselors to produce a crown prince and ensure the continuity of the royal dynasty. The King's palace guard is composed of thirty six young soldiers, led by military commander Hong-rim (Zo In-sung), who is also the King's lover. The King finally decides to charge Hong-rim with a strange commission: penetrate the Queen to impregnate her. Hong-rim and the Queen are uncomfortable accepting the royal order, but they finally comply. However, their relationship does not stop at procreation, but an intense romance soon blossoms between the two, and in this strong intimate relationship there is no place for the King.\nThe two passionate lovers surpass their \"official mission\" and continue to meet each other at midnight in the library in secret. The King begins to suspect Hong-rim's infidelity and soon gains evidence through his junior commander. To punish them and to also gauge the depth of Hong-rim's affection for the Queen, the King calls the two together to his chamber. The king tells them that he has decided that the Queen will continue to try and beget an heir, but only with another subordinate. The King remains firm in his decision, despite entreaties from both the Queen and Hong-rim.\nIn despair, the Queen attempts to kill herself by slitting her wrists, but fails. In a last-ditch effort to change the King's mind, Hong-rim asks the Queen to stay away from him, and goes to the King to offer his own life in exchange for forgiveness. The King pardons him, believing Hong-rim's claim that his involvement with the Queen was purely lust. He decides to overlook everything that had happened, and instead orders Hong-rim to go away for a while to clear his mind and settle his emotions.\nThe night before Hong-rim's departure, the Queen's personal maid secretly informs him that the Queen wishes to meet him one last time. She also bears news that the Queen has finally conceived a child. Hong-rim sneaks out from the King's bedside to meet the Queen in the library. They end up having passionate sex in the library, but the King realizes what is happening and catches them in flagrante delicto. When the two lovers attempt to save each other by begging the King to kill them and not the other, the King realizes how strong their romantic love for each other is. In a jealous rage, he has Hong-rim castrated and sent to prison.\nThe Queen now realizes that the King will eliminate everyone who knows their secret, so she sends her maid to warn Hong-rim's loyal subordinates, and they manage to free Hong-rim from prison and flee the city with him.\nUpon learning of the escape, the King demands to know Hong-rim's whereabouts from the Queen, but she refuses to answer. In response, he kills her maid. The King is then informed that the Queen is pregnant, and as the Queen had predicted, he then orders the execution of everyone who knows that he is not the child's father. Only his junior commander, who took over from Hong-rim, is spared.\nSome time later, and having recovered from his wound, Hong-rim realizes that the Queen is still in the palace and not on the run, as his subordinates were ordered to tell him. Furious, he starts out for the city on horseback, despite their protests, but then he stops in his journey, realizing how futile it would be. However, on returning to the refuge, he finds that his men have been tracked down and captured.\nAt the palace, the King tortures the subordinates to discover the whereabouts of Hong-rim, but they remain silent, so the King has them executed and their heads put up on posts on the palace gates, along with that of the Queen's maid. Her head bears the Queen's necklace, in order to trick Hong-rim into believing the queen is dead and forcing him to return to exact revenge. When Hong-rim returns to the city, he indeed becomes enraged by this sight and determines to kill the King. Disguising himself as a soldier, he enters the palace grounds during the celebrations for the soldier who came back from war and hides out, awaiting his chance to reach the King and kill him.\nMeanwhile, as the King returns to his private quarters, he encounters the Queen, but he snubs her, and orders his junior commander to escort her back to her room. As the commander is about to leave the Queen's chamber, she warns him that the King will surely have him killed as soon as the baby is born; she then says that if the commander assassinates the King, and her father takes over the throne, she will guarantee that his life will be spared. The junior commander then calls a meeting of his most trusted subordinates and reveals the truth about the King, the Queen and Hong-rim. However, before they can carry out the Queen's plan, Hong-rim goes into action.\nIgnoring the palace guards, who plead with him to leave before he is captured and killed, he fights his way to the King's quarters, cutting down all who oppose him. Reaching the King's chamber, Hong-rim confronts the King and demands that he fight him. An intense duel ensues, during which Hong-rim slashes through the King's favorite painting, which depicts him and Hong-rim hunting together. As the desperate duel continues, the junior commander and his men arrive (their intentions not entirely clear), but the King orders them not to intervene, and the junior commander holds them back and awaits the outcome of the fight. At the climax of the duel, the King manages to break Hong-rim's sword, and stabs him in the shoulder. While Hong-rim is pinned by his sword, the King asks him a last question: whether or not Hong-rim had ever felt love for him. Hong-rim replies, \"No\". Hearing this, the King is shocked, giving Hong-rim time to throw himself forward on the blade and kill the King with the remaining half of his own sword.\nAs the King dies, Hong-rim staggers to his feet, pulls the King's sword from his shoulder and charges at the guards, but he is fatally stabbed by the junior commander. Moments later, the Queen arrives at the scene with the guards at her heels, who try to hold her back. Horrified, she tearfully calls out for Hong-rim. As she is taken away by the guards, Hong-rim realizes that the King had not killed her after all. He turns his head from her and dies facing the king, his eyes filled with realization of his test. The junior commander then declares that the King has been killed by an assassin, and he orders his men to quickly remove the bodies, and to tell no one of what has transpired.\nThe final scenes of the film show a flashback to when the King showed young Hong-rim the view of the city and asked if Hong-rim wished to live with him, to which the young Hong-rim replied \"Yes.\" The film ends on a montage of the King and Hong-rim happily hunting together, referring back to a dream the King once had, as depicted in the King's painting.", "tmdb_plot": "A historical drama set in the Koryo dynasty and focused on the relationship between a king and his bodyguard.

Lodge explains to Joanna the reasons why he keeps the other players on such a short leash: if he does not, they will kill, plunder, and impregnate the fantasy world. The following week, the players continue the campaign by facing Drazuul in the town of Westhaven. Due to his character's weak traits, Leo goes through multiple copies of the character until the players are able to cleverly defeat Drazuul by hiding behind \"the mound of dead bards\". Torturing Drazuul with holy water, they learn of Mort Kemnon's location.\nMaking their way through an abandoned mineshaft, they find a henchman from the previous campaign and recover their previous party's equipment. The battle goes poorly for the players, until Lodge's cat messes up the floor-tiles and Cass distracts Lodge while they place their characters in preferable positions. After a lengthy battle with Kemnon (with Silence using a lightsaber, shotgun, chainsaw, and dynamite which he claimed to have \"found\" in the trunk), Kemnon is defeated and cryptically implies there is another enemy. It is revealed to be the Hierophant, who intends to use the Mask to rekindle the Light of Therin. The group then realizes that the \"Heart of Therin\", the church's most sacred relic, is actually a prison housing the deity. During a battle with the Hierophant, Leo finally proves to be of use as he awakens Therin from her prison, allowing Daphne to release her (though Osric is killed in the encounter).\nAfterwards, Daphne is offered an unlimited wish by Therin. After the other players recommend she wishes herself immortal, she uses it to resurrect Osric, much to the extreme disapproval of Cass, who insults her and storms out. The other three continue playing, and Therin provides rewards for each: Flynn becomes a herald, Luster is stripped of her powers and becomes a cleric, and Osric becomes Lord High Marshal of the Paladins. The campaign ends, and with positive comments from Gary and Leo, Lodge is inspired enough to write his module and has it published. Sometime later, Cass apologizes for his behavior and the group begins another adventure. Lodge wants to send his group through the adventure module that another group was playing in the first Gamers film, but upon mentioning 'The Shadow', Mark\u2014the lone survivor of that campaign\u2014screams in fear and runs from the gaming store.

Afterwards, Shiki is sent to Azaka's school, the Reien Academy, during winter break in order to help investigate a series of reports of fairies stealing the student's memories, and a suspicious attempted suicide of Kaori. The two immediately clash as Azaka is in love with her brother (Mikiya) and considers Shiki a love rival.\nWhile walking around the school, Shiki notices a fairy, and chases after it. Azaka, who cannot see the fairies, is left alone and attacked by an unknown person and has her memory stolen, waking up in the evening with no memory of what has occurred. They discover the magus using the fairies is trying to erase everyone's memories of Kaori's suicide attempt, but the school has a written record of the investigation.\nAzaka goes alone to check out the suicide site in the old building, as Shiki does not want to wake up this early. While there, Ouji finds her and requests that Azaka pray with her in the chapel. After praying, she reveals she is the one using the fairies to erase everyone's memories. She was friends with Kaori, and did not want anyone to remember the disgrace of her suicide, so she acquired magic for her sake. Ouji also wants to punish the other students, who looked the other way after Hideo Hayama (the teacher who went missing) forced Kaori into a relationship with him, driving her to suicide. She killed Hayama and used his body to create the fairies (as you need a corpse to create a familiar). She then tries to erase Azaka's memory. Azaka is knocked unconscious from behind by one of the fairies.\nAzaka is found by Satsuki Kurogiri, the teacher replacing Hideo Hayama, strangely still possessing her memory. Shiki arrives and tells Azaka the students of Kaori's class have disappeared. Azaka says she is going to check out the suicide site, but Kurogiri strangely tells her that there is nothing there, and upon arriving there she finds a large section of the building has disappeared without a trace. Unable to find Ouji, Azaka falls asleep, and is woken some time later by the dog left by her roommate. Shiki tells her  a message from Mikiya: Kurogiri's real identity is a magus known as \"God's Word,\" who can control people's recognition using words, a counter measure to his ability, as well as the cause of Hideo Hayama's death.\nTaking Shiki's walkman and earphones to ignore his words, Azaka runs past Kurogiri without being affected by his ability, and heads to the suicide site to discover all the students there in a trance with lighted matches and open canisters of fuel, Ouji intending for them to commit suicide in the same manner as Kaori attempted. Azaka and Ouji face off in the chapel, while Shiki faces off with Kurogiri. Azaka tries to convince Ouji to stop, revealing Hayama died from a heart attack due to his drug abuse, and the information about Hayama forcing Kaori into a relationship was just a rumor the fairies overheard from the students. Kaori learned Hayama was a drug addict and he injected her with drugs to prevent her from telling one, making her become an addict in the process. The side effects before her suicide were withdrawal, and Kaori couldn't forgive herself for becoming addicted. Nobody killed anyone, but Kurogiri had stolen Ouji's memory to make her come to the wrong conclusion. Ouji refuses to stop, preferring to believe her belief of events to avoid besmirching Kaori's memory, and tries to kill her with the fairies. Eventually they rebel against Ouji and Azaka destroys them and the source of the magic before they can kill Ouji.\nKurogiri reveals Araya Soren requested he return to Japan to restore Shiki's memory from before her accident and subsequent two-year coma. Shiki tries to kill him, but Kurogiri simply says \"You'll lose sight of me\" and Shiki becomes unable to see him.

When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by the terrorist organization KAOS, almost all of CONTROL's agents' identities are exposed, leaving only Agent 99 as a viable field operative. Smart is also promoted to field agent as Agent 86, but the experienced 99 is reluctant to partner with him due to his inexperience.  On the first day of his new job, Smart receives a Swiss Army knife which includes special add-ons like a miniature flamethrower and a crossbow that shoots darts attached to spider web thread.\nWhile on a plane to Moscow, Agent 99 spots a threatening looking man in the back. She suspects he is an assassin, but Smart brushes it off as profiling.  Max notices gum on his shoe and tries to remove it with a matchstick.  When passengers assume Max is attempting to blow up the aircraft, he is tackled by an Air Marshal and his hands are put into zip ties. Max requests to use the bathroom, and while inside attempts to break his zip ties using the crossbow on his pocketknife. He does finally break the zip tie, but one of the darts hits the \"eject\" button and leaves him plummeting towards the earth with no parachute. Agent 99 follows with a parachute, as does the assassin. The latter is prevented from making all three crash when Agent 99 kisses him, surprising him enough for her to deploy the parachute. The assassin crashes in a barn, and Agent 99 and Smart assume he is dead, though he is berated by her for the incident.\nThe two arrive at the mansion of KAOS' chief bomb-maker, Ladislas Krstic, during a party. Upon the completion of an intense dance-off they infiltrate the main office and trace nuclear material to a KAOS nuclear weapons factory disguised as a Moscow bakery. They are caught by Krstic and his men, but eliminate all of them successfully. In the bakery, Smart meets with KAOS boss Siegfried and his second-in-command, Shtarker, only to learn that a double-agent has compromised their identities. Smart manages to escape and destroy the weapons factory, but he and Agent 99 are confronted by the same man that they had assumed dead earlier. All seems lost, but Smart recognizes the man as Dalip, who was in a recording taken during Smart's time as an analyst. He gives Dalip advice on fixing his failing marriage, and Dalip promptly lets them go.\nThe Chief sends Agent 23 to observe the cleanup of the factory, but KAOS sneaks the weapons out through the Moskva River beforehand, leaving Agent 23 convinced that only a bakery had been destroyed. Realizing that Smart was alone during his key discoveries, CONTROL believes him to be the double agent. Agent 99, who has gradually been developing feelings with Smart, is heartbroken but takes him into custody, just when he starts suspecting that she is the double agent.

While Smart is in a CONTROL holding cell, Dalip sends him a coded message via the radio show American Top 40 posing as his girlfriend, alerting him to Siegfried's plan. Smart escapes and arrives in Los Angeles to reunite with the Chief, Agent 99, and Agent 23. He convinces them that he is not the double agent. Meanwhile, as the President arrives at the Disney Hall for a concert, Siegfried, Shtarker and Dalip plant the bomb in the concert hall.

After a chase, Smart manages to rescue Agent 99, but in the struggle, the car is set on fire and forced onto railroad tracks. Smart kisses Agent 23 to distract him, a trick learned from Agent 99. He and Agent 99 are thrown off the vehicle before it collides with a freight train, killing Agent 23.

Harold seems to cope all right in his hometown of Douglas, until his mom, Maureen, announces that the family is moving to a new house in Fredericksburg due to a promotion at her job. Harold panics, because he had somewhat fit in with everyone at his old school, despite his baldness.\nWhen he arrives in his new house, Harold is met by an elderly new neighbor, Maude, who assumes Harold is older because of his baldness, and starts flirting with him. Harold starts at his new school, and because he initially wears a hat into class, he is seemingly accepted, especially by a girl, Evelyn, whom he briefly flirts with. When the teacher, Ms. Vicki Norris, notices him wearing a hat, he is forced to take it off, thus revealing that he is bald. Instantly he is ostracized by the other students, including Evelyn, and especially the school bullies\u2014including the ringleader, Brad Denison.\nHarold sees that some of the students ride go-karts to school, including Brad, and he asks his mother for one for his birthday; however, he instead receives a battery powered riding cart (the kind elderly people use) given to them by Maude, who had recently bought a newer model for herself. Harold is disappointed, but uses it anyway.\nHarold's older sister, Shelley, has started high school in the new town as an immensely popular and flirty cheerleader. She meets a boy named Patrick and they quickly start dating, which leads to Patrick assuming that Harold is Shelley's father. Harold initially uses this to prank Patrick, threatening him should he mess with Harold's \"lovely daughter\" on their date, but Shelley angrily reveals the truth to Patrick. At first Patrick and his friends are mad at Harold, but Harold offers to make up for it by buying the boys some beer. When it works, Patrick's attitude toward Harold eases up.\nHarold is bullied relentlessly by students. One of the few nice people is Cromer Styles, the school janitor. While in gym class, the bullying rears its ugly head and the coach joins in. Cromer comes to the rescue when he announces Harold is wanted in the office. That was just a decoy \u2013 Cromer and Harold watch TV in the janitor's room.\nHarold returns home, angry and upset, and decides to go back to his old home, where everyone liked him. He leaves late at night so that his Mom and sister won't get suspicious. He only makes it as far as a strip bar. Harold thinks that because he looks older, he may pass for legal age, but Cromer is there as well, and he takes Harold home. He gives Harold words of encouragement, and then drops him off at home.\nThe next day in gym class, Harold is asked to take his shirt off as part of the Skins and Shirts team. He has a big strip of hair on his back, and everyone starts laughing at him. He talks to Cromer, and they decide to pull a prank on the coach, flushing the locker room toilets to overheat the water when the coach is in the shower.\n\n \nNot wanting to go back to school, Harold buys a few beers for himself, and is followed by Maude, who still thinks that he is much older. When he tells her he is 14, she thinks that means the size of his manhood. When he explains he is only 14 years old, she is shocked, thinking he simply had good skin for an old man. She tells him to come back in a year.\nPatrick and his buddies ask Harold for one more favor: to get them some beer for a party. Harold agrees, but only if they allow him to join them at the party, which they accept. Harold buys the beer, but while chatting with the boys at the party he is arrested by police, who believe him to be a major selling beer to minors. They do not believe him when he tells them that he is only fourteen. He is taken to the local police station and locked up with other inmates.\nLater that night, Patrick encounters Shelley and tells her what happened to Harold. She is shocked and gets angry at Patrick for not helping Harold. She refuses to stay at the party with him, instead rushing off to get her mother and help her brother. Before she reaches the house, however, Harold is given a phone call, and talks to Cromer at the strip bar. Cromer bails him out, and drops Harold off at home, where Harold finds Shelley trying to decide whether or not to tell their mother about Harold or try helping him on her own to avoid getting him in trouble; she is relieved when she sees he is all right, and promises to keep it secret from their mother. The two become more friendly after this.\nPatrick apologizes to Shelley the next day at school for what happened, and woos her by saying he is falling in love with her. Secretly betting with his friends about whether he can get Shelley to have sex with him before the school dance, it looks like the odds are in his favor again when Shelley falls for his romantic words. However, in the coming days, it is clear Shelley's under a lot of pressure when Patrick reveals his intentions. He threatens to take another girl to the motel room he's booked if she doesn't go with him. Harold finds Shelley crying in her room later, and she tells him the truth. Shelley tells Harold she doesn't really want to have sex, and is feeling too pressured by Patrick. Harold, recognizing Patrick the same way he sees Brad and his pack at school, decides to get revenge on him with Cromer for using Shelley. Shelley tells Patrick she has decided to go with him to the motel after all, pretending to agree to sleeping with him; they arrive there at night with Harold and Cromer waiting off to the side in the shadows. While Patrick is off to get sodas for them, Cromer helps Shelley out a back window, and when Patrick returns, the lights are off, and he has no idea that they have replaced Shelley with Maude. Patrick ends up having sex with her, and then runs out screaming when she turns on the lights and reveals herself. Patrick's friends, watching from a car out front, laugh at him.\nSome of the kids at school hear how Harold was arrested and he begins to have it a little easier. However, Brad and his crew aren't finished; they write Harold a fake note from Evelyn, asking him out to the upcoming dance, and then they humiliate him when he shows up. Evelyn, none the wiser, reveals in confusion that she was supposed to meet a high school boy named Kevin at the dance. Harold walks out in a funk and snaps at Rhonda, a classmate who genuinely likes him, when she runs out to try to talk to him, and he leaves on his cart.\nThere is a go-kart race coming up, and Cromer decides Harold should enter. He soups up Harold's riding cart, adding a real engine to it which he removed from a school tractor. After they test it and balance out the defects, it's all ready for the race. The coach tries to tell Cromer that Harold can't enter due to safety regulations as his cart does not pass, but Cromer retaliates by threatening to tell the principal about some \"funny things\" Cromer found on the coach's browsing history in his office. Even though he's just making that up, the coach falls for it and backs off, allowing Harold in.\nThe bullies have entered the race and see that Harold is competing. They decide to sabotage his cart so he will crash; they secretly loosen the lug nuts on one wheel. During the race, the wheel pops off and the lug nuts all scatter; Harold and Cromer are shocked and think there's nothing they can do, but Shelley steps in and simply tells them to remove a single lug nut from the other three wheels and put them on the fallen wheel. Cromer does this, and Harold enters the race, still maintaining his balance. Brad, close to winning the race, sees Harold back in action and puts a dent in Harold's cart in order to slow him down. Rhonda, seeing this, comes up from behind and bashes the rear of Brad's cart, causing him to crash into the haystacks at the edge of the track. Brad is out of the picture, and Harold has pulled ahead of most of the contestants except for Brad's friends. A lady from the crowd, who happens to be a stripper at the bar Harold went to, shows her breasts to the bullies in order to distract them, enabling Harold to win the race, and, ultimately, the respect of the school. Harold receives a trophy, the coach congratulates him, and one of Brad's friends apologizes to him.\nMaude meets one of the men cheering Harold on, who turns out to be Reedy, one of the regulars at the strip bar, and the two become enamored with each other. Evelyn kisses Harold and congratulates him, but Harold turns away from her, telling her to save that for Kevin. Back at home, he sees Reedy has moved in with Maude.

Not only does Eleanor agree, but Lawrence and Alison are pressured to leave the magazine by Clayton, as a result of Lawrence's divorce, leading to Sidney's promotion.\nSidney works hard, writing to please others rather than criticize, and earns several more promotions within a short time, as well as gaining access to the highest celebrities and most exclusive social gatherings. On the night before a prestigious film-awards ceremony, Sidney attends an informal party led by Sophie, and is pressured into surrendering his gold ring, which was a gift from his late mother.\nHe regains his contempt for high society, and the next evening, as Sophie is approaching the stage to claim her award, he seizes her to take back the ring, cursing, and confessing that he killed her dog.

Life is sweet as their promising careers now seem to be nicely complemented by domestic stability.\nCracks start appearing in their ideal existence when Raj who is light sleeper is disturbed by noises at nights. The noises wake him several times in the nights. Abha gave headphones to Raj and mouthing random things. But the idea failed when the doorbell rang. Finally one night, Raj goes down to investigate and discovers that it is the night watchman blowing the whistle periodically in the night to scare thieves away. Raj scolds the watchman and forbids him from making any further noise but the secretary, Janardan (Rajat Kapoor) insists on the whistling continuing for building security. Raj goes to the police station and filed a complaint. But the secretary sweet talks to the police officers and they told Raj that it was necessary to make those noises for security.

Moreover, to his great irritation, no-one really sympathizes with his problem - not Abha, not Dev (Vrajesh Hirjee) - his friend at work, not any of the neighbours. It annoys Raj immensely, because he genuinely believes that this nightly noise-making is an illogical, uncivilized act. He did a drastic act. At the end, Raj due to lack of sleep by mistake sells a share in bulk in which the secretary had invested and both incur heavy losses.

He is given failing grades on his final exam by his professor, who also happens to be his father. Unable to graduate, he becomes bitter and disillusioned. He then meets up with the actress who played the part of his patient in his final exam, the free-spirited part-time jazz singer Bogart. The two of them go back to her apartment after a night at a jazz club and have casual sex. Afterwards she gets up to go for a drive and asks Peter if he'd like to come, to which he agrees. The two of them drive north through the night and Peter eventually dozes off. When he wakes up, he finds that Bogart has driven all the way to Humboldt County. It is here that he meets her family. Jack and Rosie took her in when her family abandoned her, and they became her surrogate parents. He also meets Max, Jack and Rosie's son and Charity, Max's daughter.\nAfter an uncomfortable night in which Peter finds out that they are all involved in growing pot, he finally manages to go to sleep. The next morning he is woken up abruptly by Max. When he gets dressed, he finds out that Bogart has left. Stranded and unwilling to call his father for help, Peter's only choice is to take the bus, which won't come for another day. With nothing else to do, Max enlists him to help with his marijuana crop, which Peter reluctantly agrees to do. After a day of working on some irrigation problems, they relax back at Jack and Rosie's house. Bob and Steve, friends of Max, arrive bloodied and dirty. Some local hicks found their garden, roughed them up and took their plants. The next day, Peter helps Max with his plants again. He becomes so focused on the work that he misses the bus. It is after this that he begins to bond with Max and the rest of his family. He quickly falls in love with the natural surroundings and the residents of the rural community and stops trying to leave. He begins to understand empathy and love (the thing he previously lacked, which caused him to fail his final exam in the first place). When Jack asks him what he plans to do after this, Peter is shocked to realize that he'd never considered an \"after this\".\nHis sudden fear that he would never leave is further solidified by a conversation that he has with Bob and Steve in a bar later that night. Steve explains that almost everyone who lives in Humboldt County now came from somewhere else and never left, including Rosie and Jack (who used to be a Physics professor at UCLA). He also reveals that he was in Peter's shoes a few years earlier; he was a student at Stanford and followed a girl out to Humboldt county and never left. When Peter expresses doubts that their situations were similar, Steve also mentions that the girl he followed was Bogart. When they get up to leave, Bob refuses because he notices the guys that stole their plants sitting at a table behind them. While he and Steve argue about whether or not he's actually going to confront them, Peter drunkenly walks over and starts accusing the men and admonishing them for their cowardice. He then throws his drink in one of their faces and they all run out of the bar with the hicks in pursuit. They get away and are walking through the woods, laughing about what Peter had just done when Steve says that he wants to show them something. He takes them up to an unfamiliar area of the woods where there is a massive plantation, at least fifty plants. Steve and Bob start to steal a couple because they figured that no one would notice. At this time, Peter sees a sleeping bag on the ground just seconds before someone fires a shotgun at them. As they run away, Peter stops and looks back at the person chasing them, it is Max. It's revealed that this is his secret garden. Max is furious with Peter for trying to steal his plants and he yells at him to leave, brandishing the shotgun.\nWhen Peter gets back to Jack's house, Jack is in the living room waiting for him. He confronts Peter and asks him how many plants Max has. At first, Peter is hesitant to answer, so Jack takes him out on a nature walk and explains to him the dangers of having more than a few plants. He believes that by growing only twenty plants, he makes enough to get by and keeps from attracting the DEA's attention. He warns Peter against letting greed run his life, because doing so destroys the entire reason they came out to the lost coast in the first place; to find salvation. After this, he goes to Max's trailer and asks him why he didn't tell him about the other plants. Max angrily fumes that he was planning on telling Peter as they got closer to harvest time. It's at this time that a federal SUV pulls up and Peter and Max are taken into custody. Peter is interrogated about Max's purchase history which includes fertilizer and water tubing, but he says nothing and they are let go due to a lack of any solid evidence against them. Afterwards Peter starts to question why he is still there. The next day, Jack has a BBQ. He confronts Max about his secret crop. Avoiding a direct question from Jack, Max instead mocks him, saying that the presence of the Federal police is probably due to their eagerness to steal Jack's extensive research on physics. Jack angrily storms off and Rosie begins to tell Peter about Max's real father. Jack, Rosie and her then-husband, Charlie were all friends when they worked as professors at UCLA and they decided to move to Humboldt County together.  However, eventually Charlie, who had been a long time alcoholic and drinking buddy of Jack's, died in a car accident while suffering from an episode of extreme alcohol withdrawal.\nPeter decides that he can't be a part of Max's operation any more and he tries to leave. Max gets angry and tells him that this isn't a game and he can't back out, but Peter starts walking away anyway. Max then starts to cry and tells Peter that if he doesn't pull this off, Charity will end up just like him. While this affects Peter greatly, he continues to walk off. Charity then finds Peter crying by a tree and asks him what's wrong. He asks her what she wants to be when she grows up and she says an astronaut. When she asks him what he wants to be, he says that he no longer knows, and she says that that's all right, which comforts Peter.\nThe next day, Peter's father shows up at the house, using Star-69 and MapQuest he managed to find where Peter was. After a brief visit with Jack and Rosie, where he is greatly put off to find that this is where his son has been all this time, he tells Peter that they're leaving, and Peter reluctantly goes with him despite his new-found bond with Jack and Rosie. As they're driving, his father tells Peter that he decided to pass him, but this news doesn't affect Peter much. He then sees Bob and Steve speeding down the road in the opposite direction, followed by Max and then by a federal helicopter. Peter realizes that they must have found Max's secret crop and are on their way to raid it. He gets out of the car and tells his father to head for the beach (advice that Max had told him earlier) and he runs off to stop Max from trying to save his crop.\nPeter's father gets to the beach, where he finds Jack along with all of the other local pot farmers. He informs him that Peter took off. Jack hadn't seen Max anywhere and he connected the dots and headed off towards Max's crop. When Peter gets there, he finds Max trying to save as many of his plants before the DEA gets there and Peter begins to help. Then the feds show up and Peter and Max narrowly manage to hide themselves. Then Jack shows up and leads them both back to the beach, where Charity happily reunites with Max. Peter says that he's sorry to Max for his loss and Max tells him not to take it so seriously. That night, Max is at the bar drowning his sorrows when his drunken behavior gets him kicked out. He is then seen driving down the highway and laughing to himself. The scene then cuts to the next day when a sheriff shows up at Jack and Rosie's and informs them that Max is dead.\nThey then call Peter, who is staying at a hotel with his father, and tell him. He attends the funeral and afterwards finds Jack in his study, weeping to himself. Jack is ridden with guilt. Jack says that it was his idea to come up to Humboldt County and he blames himself for the deaths of Charlie and now Max. He breaks down saying that he has nothing left. In response, Peter tells Jack that has so much left and that he had not yet reached the event horizon (a concept of physics that Jack had described to Peter as the point of no return).

Arthur denies that he is a murderer, a crime for which his former partner, Willie Grimes (Larry Fessenden), has already been executed by guillotine. However, Blake freely admits to being a grave robber, and begins to recount his career with Willie.\nArthur became Willie's apprentice following the death of Blake's father, forcing the young man to find a job to support his family. Willie quickly taught him the skills necessary to steal corpses, both from graves as well as more risky locations, such as wakes. The job proved profitable on its face, but both Arthur and Willie's ability to make money was severely hampered by the interference of Doctor Quint (Angus Scrimm), who frequently blackmailed the two into obtaining corpses for free under threat of notifying the police of their activities. This blackmail continued for numerous years.\nWillie and Arthur's career changed abruptly when procuring another corpse for Quint. Digging up a corpse buried at a cross-roads, the two were confused when they found a garlic wreath around the body's neck and a wooden stake in its chest. Arthur dismissed these things as superstition, and removed them against Willie's protests. Moments later, while the two were clearing their cart, the dead woman rose and walked away. Willie and Arthur attempted to flee, but came across the undead woman, who attacked Arthur. Willie was able to fend her off briefly with a shovel, and when she attacked him he managed to plunge the stake back into her chest, causing her to go immediately limp. Willie and Arthur delivered the staked body to Doctor Quint and departed quickly. The doctor removed the stake, awakening the undead woman, who killed him.\nFreed of their blackmailer and now aware of a new market for their skills, Arthur and Willie shifted their career towards the supernatural side of grave robbing. During one such job (retrieving a body resembling a Grey alien) they were stopped by Cornelius Murphy, main spokesperson for the House of Murphy, an infamous and vicious band of grave robbers led by Cornelius' unseen father, Samuel. Cornelius demanded the body at knifepoint; though Willie advised him to cooperate, Arthur refused, and the three scuffled over the body until it vanished in a burst of light.\nAt this point in Arthur's narrative, Father Duffy asks him if he had any further encounters with the House of Murphy. Arthur is reluctant to speak of the matter, but finally relents, discussing the next\u2014and last\u2014time he encountered the Murphys.\nDrinking at a local pub with their new apprentice (and Arthur's girlfriend) Fanny, Arthur and Willie received word from pub owner Ronnie about a possible job: a local mortuary had been reported as receiving crated shipments of the undead. However, their most recent shipment was incomplete, two of the crates lost in a shipwreck and believed to be located on a nearby island. The catch was that the mortuary had already hired someone to retrieve the missing undead: The House of Murphy. Willie and Arthur initially turned down the job, not wishing to cross paths with the Murphys, but at Fanny's insistence the two reluctantly agreed.\nOn the island the crates, are guarded by Bulger, House of Murphy's enforcer. Fanny slit his throat (to Arthur and Willie's surprise), then the three rounded up one of the undead, Willie suffering a bite during the effort. Before they could get to the second, Fanny was killed by a knife thrown by Cornelius, who then tied the remaining two to the cage containing the captured undead. The two were only saved from death when the captured undead tore free of its cage and attacked Valentine, Murphy's disfigured female assassin. Cornelius attempted to save Valentine, only to be attacked by the second undead. Willie and Arthur freed themselves, then escaped in the confusion. Afterward, the two argued bitterly over the botched job, resulting in the end of their partnership, and friendship. A week later, the two were arrested.\nAt the conclusion of the tale, Father Duffy asks whether it was Arthur or Willie who murdered Cornelius, but Arthur reiterates that the two simply left him to his fate. When Father Duffy expresses a surprising amount of anger at this, as well as the sentiment that Willie was \"lucky\" to have been killed before Duffy could meet him, Arthur realizes the priest's true identity: Samuel Murphy. The elder Murphy then attempts to kill Arthur with a mace, but, before he can, he is struck down by an unseen rescuer. When he is able to look up, Arthur is surprised to discover his rescuer is Willie\u2014more accurately, the decapitated body of Willie. Holding his head in one hand, Willie explains that the bite he suffered on the island seems to have rendered him undead following his execution. As the two make their way out of the prison cell, Willie remarks that being undead is the best thing that ever happened to him, and even suggests that Arthur himself get bitten. When Arthur rejects the idea, Willie claims he's starting to feel \"ravenous\", and jokingly chases after Arthur as they leave the prison.\nUnknown to them, Cornelius rises from his underwater grave.", "tmdb_plot": "18th century justice catches up with a pair of grave robbers.

Why Juliette was in prison is revealed slowly throughout the film: first, that she was in prison for 15 years, then that her crime was murder, then that the victim was her 6-year-old son Pierre, and finally the reason why she killed him.\nL\u00e9a, a college professor of literature, is considerably younger than Juliette. Because of the nature of Juliette's crime, their parents denied Juliette's existence and refused to allow L\u00e9a to visit her. In addition, Juliette had refused to speak throughout her trial. As a result, L\u00e9a knows nothing about the circumstances surrounding the crime and, when pressed for details, Juliette refuses to discuss what happened until the end of the film.\nWhile struggling to find employment, Juliette enjoys platonic companionship with two men, a probation officer who understands how prison can damage the human spirit, and Michel, one of L\u00e9a's colleagues, who is sympathetic to her ordeal of having been imprisoned.\nGradually, Juliette begins to fit in with L\u00e9a and her family, makes friends, and finds a permanent job as a secretary at a hospital.

They travel to a town run by the Shirakawa, a Yakuza family who are plagued by the Banki-to, a group of mercenaries. This group is led by Banki, an evil man who is excellent in sword fighting but who has a disfigured face. Ichi is befriended by Kotaro, a boy who lives with his drunkard father.\nAfter Ichi helps Toma win money from Ch\u014d-han, they are followed by five Bankito who demand Toma's money. After Toma refuses, he is challenged to a fight but he is unable to draw his sword. Ichi slays the gang.

The two had fought but Zatoichi would die in battle because of a fast acting disease. She is thrown into a locked ditch and left to die. As she loses consciousness, Ichi drops the bell given to her by Zatoichi.\nWe then see Ichi's backstory. She was born blind. While she was still a young girl, Zatoichi rescued her and left her in the care of a group of goze, giving Ichi a small bell to remember him by. Zatoichi visited her as she grew and secretly taught her the fighting techniques Zatoichi had mastered. Ichi grew up to be a musically talented and beautiful woman, as well as an accomplished sword-fighter. After one of her goze group's performances, she was raped by one of the patrons. Goze were strictly forbidden to marry and required to be celibate so she was later expelled from the goze household, even though it broke the other members' hearts. She pleaded with the man who had raped her to talk to the leader of the goze so she could go back to the group, but instead he mocked her and tried to attack her again. She was able to draw the sword she kept hidden in her cane and killed him. Ichi then travelled Japan to look for Zatoichi, who she believed was her father, and this was how she met Toma.\nToma is attacked by the members of the Yakuza clan because of his deceit, but Toraji rebukes the attackers, stating that they still need Toma's help to defeat the Bankito. Toma goes with Kotaro's reformed father to the Bankito hideout and saves Ichi. Banki swore revenge. While recovering, Ichi explained that she is searching for Zatoichi because she wanted to see him one last time before she commits suicide. Toma is able to convince her to give up the idea.

At this same moment, King Malbert arrives to see Glockenstein and demand that he builds an invention that could defeat Schadenfreude, who Malbert fears will replace him as king due to his popularity. Unable to tell the truth of Glockenstein's death and seizing the opportunity, Igor boldly claims that Glockenstein is creating life, which greatly pleases Malbert, who proclaims that such an invention would make its creator the greatest evil scientist of all time. After the king leaves, Igor reveals to Scamper and Brain his project to create a huge and monstrous being from human remains.\nWith Brain and Scamper's help, he assembles the giant, and adds an \"evil bone\" that will make it pure evil. It first seems his experiment failed but seconds later, the monster reveals to have come alive and later escapes. They later find the giantess in an orphanage playing with blind orphans. At the same time, Schadenfreude sneaks into Glickenstein's castle to steal his invention, but he not only discovers that Glickenstein is dead, but his Igor had created a living monster, which he believes will be his key to taking the throne.\nIgor manages to lead the giant back to the castle with flowers that she likes. There, he discovers that the evil bone he gave her was not activated, making the monster sweet, friendly and gentle despite being hideous. Igor attempts to activate the evil bone by commanding the monster to kill a fly, but she instead catches it and sets it outside. Igor tries to convince the monster that she is evil but fails as the gentle giantess misinterpreted it as \"Eva\", thinking that's the name he gave her. Igor later attempts to brainwash Eva into becoming evil by bringing her to a brainwashing salon. Brain also decides to get his brain cleaned and to watch TV but breaks the remote to his TV, so he takes the remote from Eva's room and, in an attempt to change the channel, inadvertently changes the monster's TV channel from a horror movie marathon to a talk show whose topic of the day is the history of acting. She ends up watching the talk show for several hours and upon leaving the salon, she can speak proper English and aspires to be an actress.\nIgor then reluctantly takes his creation back to the castle in their car, bemoaning his failures. On the way back to the castle, Schadenfreude chases after Igor in an attempt to steal Eva by using a shrink ray, only to fail and end up shrinking himself. Igor and his friends nearly go over a cliff, but Eva saves them all, showing her appreciation of all life. Brain then brags on about how he changed the channel for Eva's TV, thus admitting that he made her what she is. Upon learning this, Igor attempts to kill Brain with an axe in anger for ruining his monster. When Eva questions this, Scamper sarcastically tells her they're practicing for a play and the monster believes that they're performers. Igor then gets the idea to exhibit Eva at the science fair while lying to her that the fair is an \"Annie\" audition with a few differences. While helping Eva with the \u201cplay\u201d, Igor slowly starts to fall for her, who tries to convince him that its always better to be good than evil, no matter how much more successful evil is.\nDr. Schadenfreude takes Igor to his home revealing he knows about Glickenstein's death and Eva, so he offers a compromise, if Igor gives him Eva to overthrow King Malbert he will make Igor Malaria's number one scientist, but Igor refuses forcing Schadenfreude to refute to blackmail. Igor narrowly escapes but is too late to stop Schadenfreude from exposing Igor to the King who sends him to the \"Igor Recycling Plant\". Schadenfreude tricks Eva into coming with him by having Jaclyn (again disguised as Heidi) pretend to kiss Igor.\nAt the fair, Schadenfreude manipulates Eva into striking him, activating her evil bone and turning her into a mindless killing machine. He unleashes the monster on the Science Fair where she destroys all the Evil Inventions whilst singing a rendition of \"Tomorrow\". Brain and Scamper help Igor escape from the plant and learn that Malbert had deliberately killed Malaria's crops with a weather ray that created the storm clouds so he could implement his \"Evil Inventions\" plan, thereby keeping himself in power. Rushing into the arena, Igor tries to reason with the enraged Eva while Brain and Scamper power down the weather ray. Eva roars furiously at Igor until the sunlight begins to shine once again on Malaria, which permanently deactivates her evil bone and returns her to her sweet and gentle self.\nIgor exposes Malbert's lies to the public, telling them they do not need to be evil. The crowd boos at Malbert for his treachery before the damaged weather ray falls and crushes him to death. Dr. Schadenfreude attempts to take power, but Eva humiliates him. Malaria returns to its sunny peaceful ways with the monarchy dissolved and replaced with a republic with Igor as the president. Schadenfreude is reduced to a pickle salesman and Jaclyn, who's revealed to be a female Igor, loses her shapeshifting ability and becomes a pretzel saleswoman (while starting a relationship with Schadenfreude's Igor) while the annual science fair becomes an annual musical theatre showcase. Igor reveals his plan to build a dog to Eva, with her remarking that they'll just adopt if it doesn't work out.

Ray is attracted to Chlo\u00eb, a local drug dealer moonlighting as a production assistant. He takes her to a restaurant, where he gets into an argument with a Canadian couple (mistaking them for Americans) and punches them. Chlo\u00eb takes Ray to her apartment where they begin to have sex, but her ex-boyfriend Eirik appears and threatens Ray with a handgun. Ray disarms him and fires the gun, loaded with blanks, in Eirik's face, blinding him in one eye. Chlo\u00eb admits that she and Eirik rob tourists, but insists she had told Eirik that Ray was not a target. Ray and Ken spend a debauched night with the dwarf actor, Jimmy, who takes cocaine and rants about a coming war between blacks and whites.\nHarry calls Ken and orders him to kill Ray, on the principle that killing a child, even accidentally, is unforgivable. With a handgun supplied by Harry's local contact Yuri, Ken tracks Ray to a park and reluctantly prepares to kill him. Ray, however, distraught at his killing of the boy, prepares to kill himself with Eirik's loaded gun. Seeing this, Ken stops Ray, informs him of Harry's order and tells him to leave Bruges to have a fresh start. He gives Ray some money and puts him on a train to another city, while confiscating his gun to prevent a further suicide attempt. Ken reports the truth back to Harry, who immediately sets out for Bruges, furious at the insubordination. He picks up a gun at Yuri's, and Eirik, Yuri's son, learns of his intention.\nOn the train, Ray is identified by the Canadian couple he attacked in the restaurant and is escorted by the police back to Bruges. Chlo\u00eb bails him out and the two share a drink on the market square beneath the Belfry of Bruges. Harry arrives in Bruges and rushes through the streets towards Ray's hotel, but spots Ken sitting outside a cafe. As the two have a drink, Harry boasts that if he himself had killed a child, he would have immediately taken his own life. Ken argues that Ray is trying to better himself and deserves a chance at redemption. Harry is sceptical, so Ken suggests they ascend the bell tower for a shootout away from witnesses. At the top, Harry pulls his handgun on Ken, but Ken refuses to retaliate. Confused, Harry cannot bring himself to kill Ken, so he shoots him in the leg as punishment for not killing Ray.

Denis Belliveau and Francis O'Donnell, of Queens, New York, sought to retrace the entire 25,000 mile route of Marco Polo, eschewing aircraft and \"going only by land or sea\", even making a pact to return either \u201cdead or successful\u201d. Their main goal was to prove the validity of Marco Polo's account by capturing images of what Polo described in his Book of the Marvels of the World, or also known as, The Travels of Marco Polo.\nThe pair started out in Venice, Italy and then sailed to Israel, where in Jerusalem they obtained holy oil from Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the site of Jesus' burial, during the Eastern Orthodox Christian celebration of Easter, as Marco Polo had. Belliveau and O'Donnell then sailed to Turkey, landing in Aya\u015f, a small fishing village, although in Polo's time it was a large port. The duo made appearances in several local newspapers, which opened up doors with the local population. Denis and Francis then tried to enter Iran but were prohibited from doing so by the Iranian government. As a result, they picked up the trail traveled by Marco Polo's father, Niccolo and his uncle Maffeo, to Bukhara, hoping to visit Iran on the way back. The Polo brothers had opened up the land route to China, known as the Silk Road years before Polo.\nIn Uzbekistan the two were required to have a visa for every city that they visited. Belliveau and O'Donnell, however, initially faced difficulty from the Federal Security Service (the successor of the Soviet KGB) in crossing the Friendship Bridge into Afghanistan, but were able to do so after waiting approximately three weeks, forging their visas and paying a $100 bribe. The two noticed the stark difference between this former Republic of the Soviet Union and Afghanistan\u2014the lack of roads, goods and electricity. To get across Afghanistan, Belliveau and O'Donnell were inspired by a plan implemented by Marco Polo: Kublai Khan had provided  Polo and his companions with a golden tablet or paiza on which was written that they should be given all the \"lodging they might need and horses to escort them from one land to another.\" The American adventurers similarly received a letter from a comrade of an Afghan warlord that enabled them to obtain twenty-five heavily armed bodyguards. While traveling to Balkh, the group was ambushed and held captive by ethnic Hazaras, the direct descendants of a tribe that attacked Polo's caravan. Denis and Francis then made their way to the Wakhan Corridor in far northeastern Afghanistan. The narrow corridor has been described by the two modern explorers as being the jewel in the crown of their achievement. The leader of the Wakhi people, a living remnant of the days of feudal lords, Shah Sayid Muhammad Ishmael, told the travelers that they were the first Westerners to traverse the legendary corridor in a generation. Belliveau and O'Donnell then crossed the Pamirs into Tajikistan on horseback, passing structures made of sheep horns (ovis poli), that guided the sojourners along the snowy trails just as described by Marco Polo and dictated by local custom.The first city that the duo encountered in China was Kashgar, where they resupplied their caravan for an arduous six week horse and camelback crossing of the Taklamakan Desert. In 1994, when they finally arrived in Dunhuang, a city in the Gansu Province, Belliveau and O\u2019Donnell treated themselves to their first shower and hotel room after months of arduous travel. Marco Polo had written about the Reclining Buddha in Zhangye, which the pair dutifully recorded. When traveling to Mongolia, they lived in \u201ccircular houses covered in felt\u201d called gers. They ceremoniously drank fermented mares milk called airag and partook of  other various milk products used in the diet of the nomadic people residing there. The journeyers traveled throughout China visiting close to 200 places described by Polo, including Yunnan and Tibet. Finally, from Hong Kong in August 1994, they sailed on a container ship to Sumatra, where they lived with the Mentawai people and O'Donnell received a tribal tattoo, according to local tradition. They then sailed to Sri Lanka, known as Ceylon to Polo, and then at the beginning of November, they arrived in the Indian city of Madras, where they set off into the Indian subcontinent, documenting all Polo had correctly noted, including the ancient practice of astrology.\nThey then traveled from India to Iran, called Persia by Polo. Despite the devastating refusal of entry into Iran at the start of their journey the two adventurers were finally granted a one-month visa for entry, and told they were the first Americans to receive this freedom of passage since the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Belliveau and O'Donnell were thankful for the incredible hospitality of the people they met there.\nWhen the duo arrived back in Venice in March 1995 they were sailed down the grand canal in a royal regatta of gondolas, landing them in St Mark's Square, where the church bells of St Mark's Basilica rang in honor of their return.

When Spalko arrives and replaces the skull, the skeletons telepathically offer to give a reward to the group, using Oxley as a translator. Her gift she wants is to simply know all the knowledge of the aliens; the aliens reanimate and transfer an overwhelming amount of knowledge into her mind, killing her. A portal to their dimension is activated, and Mac and all of the remaining Soviets are drawn in, while Jones and his team escape. As the city crumbles, a large flying saucer rises from the ruins and departs for another dimension, and the waters of the Amazon flood the hollow left by its takeoff.\nThe following year, Jones is reinstated at Marshall College as its associate dean, and marries Marion, with Oxley, who has regained his sanity, and Mutt as witnesses.", "tmdb_plot": "Set during the Cold War, the Soviets\u2014led by sword-wielding Irina Spalko\u2014are in search of a crystal skull which has supernatural powers related to a mystical Lost City of Gold.

The officer calls for backup.\nThe narrative then shifts to Van Damme's point of view. He goes into the post office to receive a badly needed wire transfer but finds that the bank is being robbed. He is taken hostage along with the other customers. The police mistakenly identify Van Damme as the robber when he is forced by the actual perpetrators to move a cabinet to block the window. Van Damme finds himself acting as a hero to protect the hostages by engaging with the robbers about his career (one of them being a fan of his), as well as both a negotiator and presumed perpetrator. While speaking by phone as the ringleader of the robbers, Van Damme even goes so far as to demand $465,000 for the law firm handling his custody case.

After this happens, a scuffle ensues and in the resulting conflict, the head robber is shot by his partner. The police, after hearing a gunshot, storm the building. The police shoot another one of the thieves, and Van Damme is held at gunpoint by the final one.

However she offers to help them climb up to the instrument that has suddenly started sending data again. While hiking the mountain, a lightning storm forces the three into a cave. The cave entrance collapses, trapping them, so they have no alternative but to go deeper in the cave, which turns out to be an abandoned mine.\nTrevor, Sean, and Hannah investigate farther into the mine until they fall into a deep hole, taking them to the \"Center of the Earth\". They all continue until they discover a cave-dwelling that Max lived in.  Trevor and Sean find Max's old journal. Hannah and Trevor discover Max's dead body and bury him. Trevor reads a message from Max's journal that was written on Sean's 3rd birthday (8.14.97). Trevor continues to read Max's journal until he realizes from his notes that they must quickly leave, as the temperature is steadily rising.\nTrevor figures that they must find a geyser that can send them to the surface. They must do this in 48 hours or all of the water to create the geyser will be gone. They also figure that they must get out before the temperature rises past 135 degrees. They start building a raft to cross the underground ocean, and then the two adults become separated from Sean. Sean's guide is now a little glowing bird who has been present since the trio entered the center, and it takes him towards the river. However, he encounters a Giganotosaurus, and Trevor \u2013 who desperately is searching for him \u2013 saves him. When they arrive at the geyser it is all dried up. All the water is on the other side of the walls.\nTrevor uses a flare to ignite the magnesium in the wall and causes a geyser to shoot them through Mount Vesuvius in Italy. When they destroy the home of an Italian man, Sean gives him a diamond that he had found earlier. Trevor sees that he has many more in his backpack, and he uses them to fund his brother's laboratory. Throughout the adventure, Hannah and Trevor gradually become so attached to each other that they share a kiss. On the final day of Sean's visit with Trevor (and now Hannah), he is leaving their new home, which was purchased with some of the diamonds Sean took from the cave, and Trevor hands Sean a book titled \"Atlantis\", suggesting they could maybe hang out at Sean's during Christmas break.", "tmdb_plot": "On a quest to find out what happened to his missing brother, a scientist, his nephew and their mountain guide discover a fantastic and dangerous lost world in the center of the earth.", "tmdb_id": "88751", "wiki_id": "9617369"}, {"title": "Journey to the Center of the Earth", "genres": ["Family", "Action", "Adventure", "Science Fiction"], "wiki_plot": "Heiress Martha Dennison seeks out professor Jonathan Brock to help find her husband, Edward, who disappeared four years earlier on an expedition towards the center of the Earth. At first Jonathan is hesitant to go despite Martha's offer to handsomely pay him, giving him the opportunity to pay off the debts left to him by his recently deceased father, while his nephew and aspiring journalist Abel is excited for the opportunity to get real life journalistic experience.  After reviewing Edward's notes Jonathan is persuaded to go along.  The two of them, along with Abel, go to the newly acquired Alaskan territory to gather information about Edward and his expedition and find a Russian guide, Sergei, to aide their search of her husband.  They struggle to cover a large amount of ground in only 10 days based upon information recovered from a crudely drawn map.  They find and enter a mine shaft in a volcano, venturing deep into the center of the earth.  Along the way small signs are found of the previous expedition along with the skeleton of Mikael, a friend like a brother to Sergei, and see it as an ominous sign of what's ahead.  Abel constantly lags behind taking notes and pictures of the journey and discovers a passage to a strange new land.\nThey come out into a world that, at first, seems much like the surface except that it never gets dark despite there being no sun with a lush forest land and a large lake-like sea. Soon they encounter many prehistoric creatures and the adventure really begins.  While Martha takes a bath and short swim she is attacked by some sort of creature in the sea, at the same time Jonathan and Sergei find some logs that were clearly cut down by a person using an axe to make a raft to cross the sea. They use the left over logs and their supply of rope to make a raft of their own and notice several dinosaur-like birds (Archaeopteryx) flying above their heads in a vulture like fashion. As some of the birds move into attack they notice a very, very large pliosaur in the water heading for their raft. Jonathan suggests shooting the birds to distract and accidentally feed the dangerous and lethal marine reptile in the water.\nThey then discuss the nature of the creatures that they encountered noting that they seem to have come from different eras of development and may have escaped to this region to survive Ice Ages and other dinosaur-killing phenomena.  They then find another damaged raft, believed to be Edward's, and decide to make camp.  While Abel goes exploring alone, Sergei reveals to Jonathan that he did not go along with Edward when he first came to Alaska because he did not trust him and blames himself for not stopping Mikael from joining the expedition that led to his death.  Abel encounters two native women in the forest and he gathers the rest to follow a trail that may lead them to more answers.\nWhile crossing a rather well-made bridge a group of hostile natives surround them and bring them to their village to meet their leader who is Edward himself, who acts rather coldly towards them and forces them to bow and give up their weapons as a native custom.  Edward elaborates the nature of his conditions, that the villagers believe him to be some kind of a god who has brought them prosperity and safety by sharing his wisdom which are actually ideas of indigenous survival he got from studying other civilizations.  In a private discussion with him, Martha admits that she was expecting him to be more happy to see her; he then admits that he had never expected her to come for him and intends to stay there where he has power and influence compared to the world above where he found her power threatening.  Edward makes a pass at Martha and she rebuffs him and he goes to the village priestess whom he regards as a new wife. While they are talking a group of natives join forces and free some prisoners.  When Edward leaves his tent and finds these people he begins to shoot at them and kills one young man in front of all the others claiming that he is a traitor.  Martha slaps him causing him to bleed planting seeds of doubt that he is a god; he then explains that their leader (who escaped with help from Jonathan) has doubted Edward from the start and started a resistance to his rule and that the presence of the renegades has undercut Edward's power and so the resistance must be destroyed.  Martha explains that Edward has always been this way and that his arrogance is what attracted her to him in the first place.\nEdward then loses his power and influence over the tribe as he has been revealed to be a false god and all of the villagers leave him.  He then leaves all of his village gear behind and states that they must now leave and that their raft has been destroyed so they must take an ancient passage; meanwhile the resistance is hot on their trail to stop them.  When the resistance advances upon them Edward holds out a single piece of dynamite to ward off their attacks and when they reach the cave he lights the dynamite with the hope that it will seal the entrance to the cave that leads to the surface.  When it fails to ignite, Edward leaves the cave and shoots the dynamite sealing the rest of the group in, and him out with the violent resistance.  The team then struggles through water filled passages that lead them up through to the lake on the surface, where they originally found the entrance to the cave.\nOn the surface they make a small memorial for Edward, who is presumed dead, and decide not to tell the secret of the world below, and to continue their adventures to the East Indies with Martha and Jonathan (most unpredictably) as an item.  Abel then writes at the end of his diary that everything he has written and drawn about is only a figment of his imagination so as to discredit their discoveries.", "tmdb_plot": "Set in the late 1870's - A woman hires an anthropologist/adventurer to track down her husband, who has disappeared while searching for an elusive passage to the center of the earth", "tmdb_id": "16929", "wiki_id": "20119087"}, {"title": "Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead", "genres": ["Crime", "Thriller", "Horror"], "wiki_plot": "Melissa Scott and her fianc\u00e9 Bobby Lawrence are on a cross country road trip to Las Vegas to get married.

The taunts \u2013 which laud the killings of the Pinochet years\u2014take Guzm\u00e1n back to the hatred and chaos of the Allende period, the 1973 Pinochet coup, and ensuing terror.

Judges of that court had to decide on thousands of habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of victims, many of whom had disappeared into secret detention centers. Nearly all the petitions were denied, and Juan Guzm\u00e1n wrote some of those denials. Had they been granted, many lives would have been saved. Viewers watch as he struggles with this memory and describes how his investigation made him realize how \"blind\" he had been. \" I would say it opened the eyes of my soul,\" he says.\nGuzman's colleagues, attorneys and judges, had doubted Guzman's competence and his willingness to pursue Pinochet.

A fortnight before her eighteenth birthday, she picks an argument with her mother about her coming home late after the Christmas Party. Her mother tells her to stay within limits and arrive home in time. She is reluctant to abide by the rule and after much negotiation demands that she would listen to everything if she gets to meet her father. Then she leaves home and goes swimming in the sea to vent out. Far into the sea, she vanishes underwater.\nShe wakes up in the evening in a cottage which has no exit. At first she doesn't believe that she has been abducted and thinks that her friends are playing a prank on her. The abductor tells her how she came there. When she went swimming in the open sea, he pulled her below the water surface and knocked her unconscious using a bottled chloroform.\nMeanwhile, everyone is worried at her home. Next morning, her mother receives a call from the abductor wherein he says that he is interested in speaking to Sonia's father, Vikrant Raina (Sanjay Dutt), a New York-based Indian business tycoon, with whom he has an old score to settle.\nVikrant is introduced as a cruel and heartless but a very wealthy man, worth USD 51.7 billion. He is in India because he believes someone has emptied a large share of his money. Mallika meets him and tells him that Sonia has been abducted and that the abductor wants to speak only to him.\nIt's around 3 p.m. when the abductor calls again. Vikrant and Sonia speak to each other for the first time in eight years. The abductor tells Vikrant that the emptied money is safe in his account. Vikrant wants to know the reason behind the kidnapping. The abductor tells him that he has to do a few things as ransom to release his daughter. The very first of them is saying \"Sorry\" to Sister Margaret whom he would find on a train from Panvel at 4 pm. Vikrant thinks of it as a crazy idea to reach there in half an hour. But the abductor tells him that she has a clue of how they can meet. Vikrant is determined to reach the place by 4 p.m. and he has to overcome unwarranted circumstances. Sister Margaret hands over a piece of paper which has a poem written on it. Vikrant knows there is something in it so he involves a detective Irfan (Rahul Dev) who has solved many corporate kidnapping cases successfully in the past.\nBut the abductor is interested in playing a dangerous game with Vikrant. He is asked to perform daring tasks which would reward him with a clue to identify the abductor and the motive of abduction. At the same time the abductor starts to lose control emotionally with Sonia but stays away from her.\nOn the other hand, it is hard to believe for Sonia that she has been abducted. Initially the abductor is good with her but when she tries to stab him by pretending to flirt with him and hurts his leg, he becomes furious, corners her and manhandles her, but remembers that this is not his aim and leaves her, but not without tying her up.\nOnce Sonia realises that the abductor is probably frustrated but not a bad human being she gets a little comfortable with him. She subsequently realises that she is being kept in a bungalow which was once owned by her father. On inquiring further, the abductor reveals that several years earlier Vikrant had falsely accused him of kidnapping Sonia when in fact he was trying to save his injured friend by escorting him to the hospital in a car he tried to steal. Consequently, he spent his formative years in jail where he underwent undue mental and physical torture and suffered pangs of revenge for 15 years. He was simply out to get even with Vikrant by kidnapping her for real, so that he could teach Vikrant a lesson, because his friend suffered a huge injury, while Sister Margaret was forced to leave the place and retire. Sonia realizes she knows the abductor, and empathizes with him.\nMeanwhile, based on the clues he already has, Vikrant figures out that his daughter's kidnapper is actually Kabir Devendra Sharma (Imran Khan), who he realizes he had wrongly framed for \"intentionally\" hurting Sonia, blinded both by love for his daughter and his power of wealth, when in fact the two kids were actually unintentionally hurt after they crashed the stolen car into a tree. Meanwhile, unable to reach Vikrant over the phone, Kabir decides to pay him a visit. As planned, Vikrant and Irfan intercept him and a chase ensues. Eventually, Kabir leads Vikrant to Sonia. After meeting Sonia briefly, Vikrant is told to dismiss Irfan from the case and he hands Vikrant the task to free a prisoner from jail. Vikrant follows the command and succeeds in saving the prisoner who, it turns out, is Kabir's friend who he wanted to save, but shortly after the assignment, Irfan intervenes and shoots Kabir, who has already bidden farewell to his friend. Angered, Vikrant threatens Irfan to stay away from now on.\nAn injured Kabir is nursed by Sonia when he reaches the bungalow.

Visiting Carmen's office to ask for a job, Wayne is mistaken for Davies by Richie and Blackbird. Richie demands the money at gunpoint, but Wayne fends them off, throwing Richie out a window.

King has a younger brother Ajay, a mother, a maternal uncle, and his late father's three sisters, who are married. Their husbands are Appaji, Kona Venkat, and Gopi Mohan. The uncles steal money that is for the workers. They make it look as though the employee Chandu is responsible. King believes and fires Chandu. Suddenly, King knew the uncles had hidden the money in their room. He kept quiet because of his aunts.\nBefore King leaves the airport, this mysterious guy is after King. A few days later, King and Swapna discuss something next to a graveyard. The same mysterious guy from the airport tries to shoot King but misses. King chases the shooter to the graveyard, but the shooter suddenly disappears. Munna calls King's cell phone. King tells Munna that he's in a graveyard. Munna asks if King is OK, to which he says yes. Unfortunately, Swapna shoots King from behind. He sees her face and realizes that she is working with the shooter. Swapna shoots King again. King is presumed dead. Munna tells the police that King went missing. At least one day later, when the police take Munna to a hospital morgue, a dead body looks like King. Munna lies to the police that none of the corpses are King's body. Kona Venkat and Gopi Mohan say that Appaji's responsible for King's disappearance. Appaji escapes, and it is assumed that he is responsible. King's mother believes that her son is safe.\nAnother story thread is incorporated through the introduction of gangster Bottu Seenu, who falls in love with singer Sravani. Sravani does not care for a wastrel like Bottu Seenu, so he poses as a software engineer named Sarath to impress her. Bottu Seenu meets the real Sarath. Sravani's elder brother Gnaneswar knows Bottu Seenu, but he would get mad at Bottu Seenu for loving Sravani. Bottu Seenu pretends to be Sarath, who wears a tie, shirt, and pants. Gnaneswar gets fooled too. The real Sarath imposes Bottu Seenu in front of a cop by mistake. The cop mistakes Sarath for Bottu Seenu and beats him up badly in a hilarious way.\nMeanwhile, Appaji sends goons to look for King, thinking he's still alive. They run into Bottu Seenu, who thrashes them. Appaji proposes a deal to Bottu Seenu and asks him to pose as King and return to the palace. After Munna informed King's family that King had disappeared, Appaji tried to escape, but he got picked up by Munna. Munna gave a picture of King's corpse, time, and date to Appaji. Appaji had nothing to do with King's murder. Once Bottu Seenu gets access to King's bank accounts, Appaji can repay his debts because he borrowed a lot of money from goons. Sravani and Gnaneswar mistake Bottu Seenu for Sharath again. They accompany Bottu Seenu to the palace. The first twist: Swapna is none other than Chandu's daughter, but Chandu committed suicide because nobody believed that he did not steal the money; Bhagath Seth hired Swapna and the mysterious shooter; the mysterious shooter is Baba, and Swapna's real name is Pooja.\nBhagath hires Pooja to kill King's brother Ajay. Ajay brings his girlfriend Pooja to his home. Suddenly, Bottu Seenu attacks Pooja, but a few seconds later, he has no idea what happened. Gnaneshwar believes King's spirit came to get revenge and control Bottu Seenu. Bottu Seenu gets engaged to Sravani. Pooja knows that it is not the King who is living in the palace right now. Bhagath hires a bunch of guys, including Baba, to dress up in black and kill King's impostor and Ajay in the palace during the night. Bhagath Seth thinks that he shouldn't trust girls, including Pooja. Bottu Seenu is controlled by King's spirit and saves Ajay from Pooja. Another twist is that Ajay met Pooja right before she killed King. She feels Ajay depends too much on his brother, so he tells her to kill King. The third twist: Bottu Seenu/Sharath is revealed as King.\nMunna captures Baba, who reveals his motive for planning to kill Swapna, who is Chandu's daughter too. Pooja said what happened that day but doesn't kill King. The father and friends who cared for Bottu Seenu were Munna's people. Munna's real name is Bottu Seenu. King says that Ajay's mistake is unforgivable. King's family members are feeling sad, so he decides to leave. He dies in an explosion that takes place in his car. King's mother leaves and doesn't want anyone to look for her. Everyone else is probably still mad at Ajay. The fourth twist is that King is still alive.\nHe reveals his plan only to Shravani: King asks Bhagath's henchman (who kidnapped Kittu at the beginning of the movie) to tell him about Bhagath's evil plans. After King got shot, Munna took him to the hospital. Swapna's details were fake so they couldn't find her. He decided to play this double role drama. Bhagath's henchman/King's informer reveals the shooter is working for Bhagath, too but didn't find details about Swapna. When King met his uncles again, none of them had anything to do with it. King realized that Kittu was behind everything. King's informer blew up King's car after he escaped. This was King's plan too. The informer puts a bomb inside Bhagath's car too, so King talks to Bhagath on the phone before Bhagath dies. King pretends to be Sarath in front of everyone else.\nThe final twist: Bottu Seenu/Munna's father and friends were responsible for messing up lights and pulling tables with rope in King's palace.

Flynn deftly defends the stone and races to meet Katie: She has flown home.\nMeanwhile, in Carpathia, a group of former KGB agents led by Sergei Kubichek (Dikran Tulaine) plot to bring back the defunct Soviet Union by resurrecting the famous vampire, Prince Vlad Dracula, using the \"Judas Chalice.\u201d In  Bucharest, they kidnap Professor Lazlo (Bruce Davison), a genius historian with a penchant for vampire lore who has searched for the chalice for years. The elderly, disabled professor joins them unwillingly and directs them to New Orleans.\nIn the Library, Charlene chastises Flynn for going over budget. Combined with the loss of Katie, this is the last straw: He has a full-blown meltdown. Judson (Bob Newhart), Charlene (Jane Curtin), and the sword Excalibur (his best friend) suggest that Flynn take a vacation. Charlene wonders if he'll come back, and Judson replies that the Library has plans for him.\nCharlene drops by Flynn's apartment after her combination-speed-dating-and-wine-tasting to give him some travel brochures and advice: \u201cFollow your dreams.\u201d. That night, Flynn's strange dreams point him to New Orleans. There, he meets Andrew ( pronounced Andr\u00e9) (Werner Richmond), a guide. In a church-turned-nightclub, he encounters singer Simone Renoir (Stana Katic), the woman in his dreams. She guards the first marker for locating the Judas Chalice. After narrowly escaping Kubichek's men, Flynn and Simone do the town and spend the night together.\nIn the morning, Flynn has a magical encounter with Judson, who explains that the Judas Chalice is the vampire version of the Holy Grail, formed from the 30 pieces of silver given to Judas Iscariot after he betrayed Jesus Christ. Judson tells Flynn to intercept the chalice and gives him crucial information about staking vampires: The stake must be of aspen wood because Judas, the first vampire,  hanged himself on an aspen.\nFlynn deciphers the clues on the first marker. Andrew takes him to the tomb of Marie Laveau, the \"voodoo queen\" of New Orleans, where he discovers the second marker, only to be grabbed by Kubichek's men. Kubichek introduces Professor Lazlo. They poison Flynn with a hallucinogen so that they can stage an accident. Before it kicks in, Flynn escapes his bonds. He and  Professor Lazlo, working in nearly perfect synchrony, decipher its clues.  It is a lens with a map inscribed on it. The professor tells Flynn to run. He flees through a Carnival-style street party until Kubichek's men corner him. Simone attacks the henchmen, turning into mist and exerting inhuman strength until one blasts her in the chest with a shotgun. Flynn causes a gas fire, giving him time to carry Simone's dead body outside. Flynn grieves\u2014until she rises.\nHe passes out and wakes in Simone's home. She is a vampire, born in Paris, France in 1603, and turned at age 25. She had been a promising opera singer, deeply in love with a university teacher (played by Noah Wyle), until a chance encounter with a vampire changed her. She wants to destroy her maker so she can die in peace. When she learned of the Judas Chalice, she vowed to protect it and aid the monks who hid it in New Orleans. She has done so for two hundred years. Simone shows Flynn a 1,000-year-old painting that represents the fight of the Library against Evil. It shows the Scholar, the first Librarian, builder of the Library. The Knight/Scholar's shield is blazoned with the Tree of Knowledge.

They are again overtaken by Kubichek and his men, with Lazlo in tow. They leave Flynn and Simone trapped on board. Simone is too weak to break free because she has not fed. Flynn uses a ship's cannon to blast down one of the doors. Once free, Simone steals Andre's boat, abandoning Flynn for his own good. Hurt but determined, he makes his way back to the mainland and finds Kubichek's hideout.\nSimone arrives at the same time, and they are captured. Kubichek performs the ceremony on Vlad Dracula's body amidst gusting wind and thunder\u2014with no result. Laughing, Professor Lazlo drinks from the chalice and is transformed. He is Vlad Dracula, the vampire who turned Simone. His handicap was not a lie. He was infected during a cholera outbreak. He has been feeding on  Kubichek's henchmen, turning them into a new army of vampires.\nKubichek and his remaining henchmen, Flynn, and Simone battle the vampires. Flynn follows Vlad outside to retrieve the chalice. Kubichek sends Simone after them and blows up the hideout with a grenade. Flynn literally runs into an aspen tree and tricks the overconfident Lazlo into coming close enough to be staked. He dies in a pillar of fire. At peace, Simone asks Flynn to help her watch one last sunrise. They kiss goodbye, and she gently dissolves in a drift of sparkles.\nFlynn remembers Simone's words about living with purpose and passion and returns to the Library to resume his duties. He gives Charlene the first marker on a cord. He starts to read the inscription but instead tells her that it says \"follow your dreams\"\u2014her advice to him. Where did your dream take you? she asks. Home, he replies.\nJudson will not admit to Flynn that he is the scholar/knight in Simone's painting, Yahuda.

Having tried to forget about her warnings, he conducted an internet search that led him to drive all the way from New Jersey to the town of Bennell, New Mexico in an attempt to visit the Army base Fort Lambert. After being turned away he is forced to break through the gates of the base and is detained, at which point he explains his story to Carrie Freeborn (Erica Leerhsen) and her wheelchair-bound husband Glenn (Jason Wiles): his mother once worked at the base and warned him that something terrible was stored there, in \"Sublevel 3, Vault 12.\" The Freeborns find no evidence of Elenore Sears in their records, and their documents of the base's decontamination indicate that the vault was empty.

During the election campaign, she meets Edward Heath, candidate for the key marginal seat of Bexley. He is suspicious of her populist and publicity-seeking style, but less overtly hostile to her than more reactionary figures in the party such as Waldron Smithers.\nOverall national party strategy is for Roberts to draw Labour attention away from Bexley and Chislehurst (also being fought by a woman, Patricia Hornsby-Smith) to enable these two key marginal seats to be won.  This Margaret does, and Bexley and Chislehurst are duly won, but Margaret herself is beaten at Dartford by the Labour candidate (despite reducing his majority).  Her relationship with Denis founders and she decides that she must improve her chances of finding a new and winnable seat. To this end she decides to leave science and study for the Bar.\nAt a Conservative ball, Miss Hornsby-Smith engineers a meeting between Margaret and the shy and (it is implied) possibly homosexual Heath. Margaret flirts with him in an attempt to better her political career, and asks him a question which the audience does not hear (though they do hear Heath stating \"we must never speak of this again\").

Frustrated at the shattering of her dreams of a political career being meritocratic, Margaret is in despair.

Margaret takes up his suggestion, going blonde and\u2014through a show of tears in an interview with Kaberry, chairman of candidates\u2014receiving information of a possible candidacy in Finchley. The seat has a safe Conservative majority, but its present holder John Crowder is not managing that majority well and an alternative holder is being considered.\nThatcher is shortlisted for the candidacy and, though the misogynistic Crowder tries to convince Heath (now Chief Whip) to oppose Thatcher, she retains Kaberry's support.  She hopes Denis will accompany her to the selection panel, but goes ahead without him when he cannot return from Africa in time.  She reaches the final two and on the way to this final hustings silences Crowder's open contempt for her and her chances by pouring scorn on his unremarkable political career.  Her speech wins over even the woman in the audience whom Crowder had primed to oppose her and Margaret wins the candidacy.\nCrowder takes his complaints as to Margaret's takeover of the constituency to Heath, but Heath reveals that instead of warning the Finchley Conservatives off supporting Thatcher as Crowder had asked, he instead threatened them with dire penalties if they did not support her, partly in response to Crowder's slights against her working-class parentage (Heath's father was also working class).

The paycheck for Selina, the housecleaner, bounces again. Selina confronts Bridget and suggests she take a job as a janitor at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.\nOn her first day on the job, Bridget hatches a scheme to steal worn-out dollar bills slated for destruction. For her team she chooses Nina, who works the dollar bill shredder, and Jackie, who takes bill carts from the Secret Service room to the shredding room. It takes some work to persuade Nina to join, but Jackie joins them quickly.\nThe plan is that in the Secret Service room Bridget will switch a cart's official Master-brand lock with a near identical lock she purchased at Home Depot. Bridget will tell Jackie the cart number and give Nina the official lock. When Jackie gets the chosen cart, she dumps some bills from the cart into a trash can before taking the cart to Nina, who then uses Bridget's key to open it and restores the official lock, and then proceeds to shred the remaining bills.

It is revealed to be a spaceship that resembles a human, controlled by 100 tiny humanoid aliens. Its Captain pilots the spaceship from the command deck located in its head, with the help of his second-in-command Number 2, and researcher Number 3. The spaceship looks very human, and displays numerous superpowers, but the aliens don't know how to make the \"ship\" act like a human. A superstitious cop named Dooley desperately searches for the alien.\nThe aliens need to save their planet, Nil, from an energy crisis. They need salt, which they plan to take by draining the Earth's oceans using the metal ball, so they have to recover the ball.

In the meantime, Number 17, a young, fun-loving alien, jumps out of the \"ship\" while drunk from the alcohol Dave has imbibed. The Captain apologizes to Number 3 for ignoring her. He admits that he too loves her and wants to be with her. Back at the police station, Dooley discovers Number 17 in his coffee and interrogates him to find out where Dave is going.\nNumber 2 takes Dave to the harbor, where he tries to throw the metal orb into the ocean, but is stopped by the Captain and Number 3, both of whom managed to gain reentry back onto the ship.

Knowing he must fulfill his promise after Mary Alice tells him about her sick foster mom and busy foster dad, Drake attempts to break out Josh to help him, only to get caught and arrested. Acting as Drake and Josh\u2019s lawyer, Helen informs the judge of Drake\u2019s promise to Mary Alice, who decides they will not be sent to jail as long as they fulfill it. Afterwards, they meet their cruel and embittered parole officer Perry Gilbert, who says he will take a vote from Mary Alice\u2019s foster family if they had the best Christmas ever; if any of them vote \u201cno\u201d, Drake and Josh go back to jail.\nThe duo meet Mary Alice\u2019s foster family, which include frequently feuding twins Lily and Violet, foreign boy Zigfee who speaks an unknown language, know-it-all Trey, and Mary Alice\u2019s rebellious, loner older brother Luke. Gilbert sabotages the duo\u2019s attempts to give Mary Alice\u2019s family the best Christmas ever, so Drake bribes Megan with his friend Trevor\u2019s rare Royal Smith oboe passed down from his grandfather. Megan agrees, but reneges upon discovering it was a lie.\nAfter receiving several more tickets from Gilbert, the brothers find that he wanted a live pet chimpanzee for Christmas, but it attacked him and fled when he was a child, causing him to hate Christmas ever since. Drake and Josh then attempt to get the children into caroling, leading them to enter a Christmas parade Drake had shunned earlier. At the parade, Gilbert tricks Josh\u2019s co-worker Crazy Steve into loudly reminding them to keep their promise or else they\u2019ll be arrested; believing Drake and Josh were only being nice to avoid punishment, Mary Alice and her family leave, heartbroken.\nStill determined to keep their promise, Drake and Josh borrow Steve\u2019s woodchipper (\u201cSally\u201d) to make it snow in front of Mary Alice\u2019s house by putting ice in the machine, but they inadvertently shoot large chunks across the neighborhood. In trying to stop the machine, the brothers are knocked unconscious, but are brought home by Gilbert, who was gifted a nice chimpanzee secretly by Josh and had become nicer as a result.\nThe brothers enter the living room the next morning, where Mary Alice\u2019s family surprises them, having learned the truth from Gilbert. Everyone votes \u201cyes\u201d, and the charges against Drake and Josh are dropped. Bludge, dressed as Santa, comes down the chimney to deliver gifts to everyone, including a real Royal Smith oboe for Megan.

Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days (November 18, 1978) before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk's 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, Scott Smith.\nDissatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working-class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones. Early on, Smith serves as Milk's campaign manager, but he grows frustrated with Milk's devotion to politics, and he leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira, a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk's devotion to political activism, and eventually hangs himself. Milk clashes with the local gay \"establishment\" which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse.\nAfter two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and the third openly homosexual politician in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White, a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes.\nMilk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White's first child, and White asks for Milk's assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White's district, possibly in exchange for White's support of Milk's citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by John Briggs, a conservative state senator from Orange County, Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians (in addition to anyone who supports them) from working in California's public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by Anita Bryant and her organization Save Our Children in Dade County, Florida to repeal a local gay rights ordinance.\nOn November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. A desperate White favors a supervisor pay raise, but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition, resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks to be reinstated. Mayor Moscone denies his request, after being lobbied by Milk.\nOn the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters City Hall through a basement window to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for appointment to his former seat. Enraged, White shoots Moscone in his office and then goes to meet Milk, where he guns him down, with the fatal bullet delivered execution-style.

As the football team begins harassing Charlie, Virgil comes to his defense only to get bullied as well. Virgil and Charlie are forced to dress like cheerleaders and are hung from the school mascot's statue by their underwear.\nThree years later, Virgil and Charlie are outcasts because of the incident despite Derek claiming that he had tried to stop the bullies from humiliating them. Charlie informs Virgil that he has invented a time machine. After enlisting grease junky Zeke (Nicholas Braun) for his mechanical skills, the time machine is built, and they test it out by attempting to purchase a winning lottery ticket in the past. Forgetting that they are underage, they ask a local street performer to buy it for them but are forced to return to the present early. This, in turn, causes the street performer to win the lottery using the numbers they provided. After this failure, Charlie comes up with a plan to only use the machine to undo embarrassing mistakes made by their classmates. The group asks classmate Jeanette (Kara Crane), who has a one-sided crush on Charlie, to oversee the time machine whenever they travel to the past, and she provides them with white snowsuits to protect them from the portal's freezing temperatures.\nThe trio soon become known as the \"Snowsuit Guys\" (though they themselves prefer to be called the \"Minutemen\") and are named local heroes by the students, but labeled as troublemakers by the vice principal (J.P. Manoux) because of them accidentally breaking his diorama of the school. Virgil, Zeke, and Charlie soon realize that the behavior of the teenagers they saved have changed, as the formerly bullied have become bullies themselves. Charlie reveals that in order to get the time machine to work, he had to hack and steal files from NASA. To avoid attracting unwanted attention, Charlie warns Zeke and Virgil to refrain from using the time machine for a while. Virgil later sees Stephanie with a broken leg due to a cheerleading injury that caused her to lose her scholarship to her dream college. Despite Charlie's protests, Virgil convinces the group to travel back in time and prevent Stephanie from getting injured, revealing his identity to her in the process.\nAfter Derek experiences a humiliating loss at the state championship, Stephanie asks Virgil to change the past so Derek can win; in turn, the former friends are reunited. After hanging with the popular kids, Virgil begins to abandon Charlie and Zeke in favor of Stephanie and Derek. However, Stephanie eventually learns that Derek is cheating on her with his tutor Jocelyn. Derek pleads with Virgil to change the past so Stephanie never finds out, but Virgil is reluctant, having realized he has his own feelings for her.\nThe FBI comes to town after monitoring suspicious activity and interrogates Charlie, Zeke, and Virgil. The trio bitterly disbands due to Virgil's repeated use of the time machine to help his own popularity. After consulting with the government's top scientists, Charlie learns that their trips to the past have damaged the space-time continuum, thus creating a black hole. With only hours to live, the trio reunites and is forced to venture into the hole and close it.\nOnce they have entered the black hole, they are transported back to their first day of high school, as the key component from the time machine was in Charlie's rocket cart. Virgil realizes that he can undo the events that caused him to lose his popularity. Charlie admits that although Virgil hates this day, it's his favorite as it's the day he finally got a real friend. Charlie and Zeke leave Virgil to make a decision, but as Virgil watches the incident unfold, he discovers that Derek didn\u2019t defend him at all.

At Negron's apartment, Boyle, Ricci and other officers discover a finely carved statue head, the head of the Primavera, a long missing segment from the Ponte Santa Trinita. Also found is a Purple Heart and a photograph revealing that Negron was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross and Silver Star.\nNegron, in a flashback, tells of his war experiences as a young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy, late 1944 during the Gothic line phase of the Italian campaign. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to believe their reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded on the wrong side of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. He and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure.

A local Italian Partisan group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema were killed by German forces following a betrayal by an Italian partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead.

While attempting to retreat, Negron is shot in the back, but is saved by his backpack radio. After Angelo gives him the Primavera's Head, Negron gives the boy his rosary and tells him to leave. Angelo is led away by the spirit of his brother Arturo, who had been killed during the massacre at St. Anna.

The building still contains numerous mirrors from the store.\nOn Ben's first night of patrol, he finds a mirror that appears covered with handprints, but only on the reflected side of the glass. He sees an open door in the reflection while it is actually closed. Over time, Ben begins to see more intense visions, which he initially shrugs off as hallucinations. He soon finds the wallet of Gary Lewis, the previous night guard (from the beginning of the film) who supposedly killed himself. Inside is a note that says \"Esseker\". After noticing the absence of blood on the mirror shard in Gary's crime photos, Ben is convinced that the mirrors make people do things to themselves that they are not actually doing.\nMeanwhile, Ben's sister, Angie, is killed by her reflection as it grips its jaw and slowly pulls its mouth apart, causing her to bleed profusely. Ben is distraught when he finds her body. In anger, he attempts to destroy the mirrors at the Mayflower, but they are impervious to damage.

She was taken in by a doctor, Dr. Kane from St. Matthew's Hospital, who believed that she had a rare personality disorder. His treatment was to confine Anna to a chair surrounded by mirrors, believing this would cure her disorder by forcing her to confront her own reflection. Ben is told by Anna's brother Robert that when she returned, apparently cured, strange things started to happen with the mirrors in their home. As a result, her family sent her to a convent, Saint Augustine's Monastery, where mirrors are forbidden.\nBen visits the convent and finds Anna alive and well, who explains that she was actually possessed by a demon, which was drawn from her and became trapped in the mirrors. She explains that it collects the souls of those it kills and if she were to return, it would make it possible for the demon to be brought back into the mortal world. She refuses to go back.\nMeanwhile, Amy discovers that Mikey is missing at home, and a thin reflective layer of water is completely covering the floor.

After breaking the sculpture, Zach blames it on her three-year-old son and the couple soon leave.\nIn the car, Georgina gets upset with Zach over the statue and she is about to ask him a question before he cuts her off saying, \"I do not hate babies.\"  Georgina jumps to the conclusion that he does hate babies and demands that he pull over and lets her out. Zach goes to a friend's house to 'crash' while Georgina heads home.\nPrior to this event, Georgina had gone to the clinic to see how many eggs she had left; her best friend Clem goes with her and receives the call that the two of them are to return. The doctor informs Georgina that she only has one egg left and that she'd be ovulating for four days.  The two women go out on a 'date' with a young man named Justin, who is completely taken aback when Georgina announces that she has one egg left.\nClem and Justin help Georgina form a plan to sleep with a random stranger.  On day one, Georgina has an \"open house\" to rent out her apartment in order to lure men inside. The first few are turned away due to their looks or their orientation. Finally, a man of great quality comes along, however just before he and Georgina kiss, Zach calls.\nGeorgina kicks the man out and talks to Zach, but then hears a woman's voice saying, \"Zach, darling, will you zip me up?\" An angry Georgina hangs up the phone and Zach isn't too pleased with the woman - Alexandra. Alexandra is the daughter of a rich man who is funding Zach's latest documentary; she is also the reason why Georgina was unable to speak to Zach before he left for a trip.\nOn day two, Georgina goes to a funeral to pick up a man overcome with \"emotions\" and isn't thinking too well. She takes him back to her apartment, leaves to get wine and as she is in the kitchen he discovers her \"PLAN\" sheet that has all the details about her seducing him on it.  He is disgusted and leaves, as Georgina tries to explain herself.\nDay three, Georgina finds herself with Clem at a night club. They see a very good looking young man, dancing very seductively and attracting all the girls' attention, and Georgina goes to seduce him. Before successfully seducing the man, she rips her dress in several places to make herself more sultry.\nAt the hotel, Georgina is about to go all the way with him, before she excuses herself to go to the bathroom. While she is taking out her breast pads and washing her mouth out, he steals some of her money and a card before leaving.  Georgina comes out to find the lights off and him gone. After cursing her stupidity \u2013 and noticing her money and card gone \u2013 she goes home.\nDuring this time, Zach is seen trying to hurry back to London and has to take the ferry because Alexandra had taken the last ticket going to London. Georgina and Clem purchase sperm from the Internet and go out to buy a turkey baster.  At this time, Georgina reveals to Clem that she only wants Zach, before she says that she can't believe that the future father of her child is a turkey baster.\nGeorgina, seeming desperate at this point, turns to one of her employees who reveals that he is infertile just before the two of them can have sex.  She then plans to go through with the artificial insemination, reading the directions as the sperm arrives.  Her mother arrives with a birthday cake and Georgina accidentally squirts the sperm on the cake. Clem intends Justin, her so-called pet, to impregnate Georgina. A nervous Justin doesn't seem to want to go through with it. They go to a hotel room and Justin can't seem to get off, nor is he comfortable with this idea. Justin can't do it and backs out.\nShe begins to spank him, before she is thrown out of the hotel by the staff. She runs into a friend of Zach's and is comforted by him.  While hugging him, Zach walks in and assumes that they are having an affair and slaps his friend before leaving. Georgina runs after him, but loses him. She misses her chance to get pregnant and mopes around because she lost both her chance to have a baby and Zach.\nBen, Zach's friend, comes over to check on Georgina and the two begin to talk about how awkward the situation was just as the doorbell rings. Clem gets it and turns out that it's Zach, who is outraged to find Ben and Georgina holding hands. He slaps Ben again, who, in turn, punches Zach. The two have a scuffle, during which Ben tells Zach that while Georgina is OK, she isn't Clem.  Clem, hearing this, asks him to repeat that and after establishing that he likes Clem and not Georgina, he gets off Zach and goes to Clem.\nGeorgina asks about Alexandra, who Zach admits is beautiful, but says that isn't all he looks for in a person. She isn't impressed by his reasoning, however Zach continues on trying to explain that he loves her and had never stopped.  Zach reveals that he wants children too, however an upset Georgina leaves and Ben has to explain to Zach what had been going on.  At work, Georgina's worker reveals that he understands why she left and leaves before Zach comes in with a dozen roses.\nFour months later, while Georgina is running her breasts and belly feel sore and goes to a clinic for a pregnancy test.

However, the national park has undergone security measures while F\u00e9lix was gone. Mysterious animal kidnappings have occurred at other national parks and animal preservations, which had caused the shelter to be turned into a prison-like structure, leading F\u00e9lix's paranoid chameleon friend, Gus, to believe that their human caretakers are in a conspiracy to keep the animals locked up for experiments. While the others are skeptical of Gus' claims, a female lynx, Lincesa (Lynxette in the English version), is brought to the shelter; she and F\u00e9lix begin to form an attraction to each other.\nIn the dead of night, the shelter is infiltrated by mercenaries led by Newmann, the self-titled \"greatest hunter in the world\", hired by an eccentric millionaire, No\u00e9 (Noah in the English version), who has created a sort of Noah's Ark for threatened species. Due to the antics of two bumbling mercenaries, F\u00e9lix is able to escape from his cage and free his friends from the transport trucks, with the exception of Lincesa being hit with a sedative dart by Newmann. With some encouragement, Astart\u00e9 is able to fly back to the shelter and set off the alarm, alerting the humans to their disappearance. F\u00e9lix and his friends set out to find the kidnapped animals and stop No\u00e9's plans, later accompanied by their mole friend, Rupert, who escaped from the ship. They enlist a pack of wolves to help them evade Newmann and the pursuing mercenaries; however, the wolves are caught, along with a few other animals, and F\u00e9lix starts to believe that it's his bad luck to blame for them being followed. They meet Diogenes, a vulture with a mission to clean the environment, who supplies the group with materials to build a makeshift transport to outrun the mercenaries. However, F\u00e9lix abandons the group to protect them from his bad luck.\nOn No\u00e9's ship, Lincesa discovers that No\u00e9 has the ability to speak with animals. He tells her that he was once locked up in an insane asylum for claiming to talk with animals, but after being released, he used his communication skills to amass a large fortune (e.g., horses at the racetrack, moles finding oil pockets underground, fish guiding him to sunken treasure). His plan to collect endangered animals and bring them to an island refuge is his way of thanking them by saving them from extinction, for helping build his fortune. \"What's the point in being free if you're not alive?\", he tells Lincesa. However, she turns his words on him saying, \"What's the point in being alive if you're not free?\" After hearing this and being reminded of how terrible it was for him to be locked up, No\u00e9 becomes disillusioned with his plan.\nAfter F\u00e9lix finds Rupert, who had mysteriously disappeared, it turns out that Rupert is responsible for Newmann and the mercenaries tracking them. After the events at the animal center, No\u00e9 implanted Rupert with a microchip and set him free in hopes of finding the escaped animals, in exchange for the safety of Rupert's family (moles aren't endangered, after all). Realizing that it's not his bad luck to blame, F\u00e9lix returns to his friends in time to save them from being caught by Newmann. The hunter underestimates F\u00e9lix, and this results in him being scratched in the face by the lynx. He becomes mad with rage at this, and attempts to fire a lethal shot at F\u00e9lix, but is interrupted by a call from No\u00e9, telling him to call off the hunt immediately. Further enraged, Newmann decides to take over the ship, lock No\u00e9 in a cage, and set up traps in the ship's hangar for F\u00e9lix.\nWhile Gus and Beeea free No\u00e9 from his cage, Newmann tries to draw F\u00e9lix to him using Lincesa as bait. Unexpectedly, Newmann causes an explosion that starts to flood the ship, beginning an evacuation protocol of the caged animals. While fighting Newmann, F\u00e9lix has an epiphany that, by holding on to the hunter, he will be prone to injury by his own traps, thanks to F\u00e9lix's bad luck.

Due to this reason, Owais Hussain (Suniel Shetty), a senior producer at the controversial news channel Al Johara, offers him a job as the head of the channel's India bureau. Vikas is going through a divorce with his wife Anjali (Shriya Saran), and getting his mind off things, Vikas accepts the offer and flies to Istanbul to start work for Al Johara. Vikas then meets Dr. Lisa Lobo (Shweta Bhardwaj), at a party, Lisa who is headed to Istanbul to attend a medical convention, it is later revealed that Lisa is a R.A.W. agent looking forward to recruiting Vikas.\nOnce in Istanbul, Vikas meets with the head of Al Johara, Ghazni (Nikitin Dheer), who has business interests all over the world but whose obsession these days is Al Johara as an instrument to shape world events. There is only one word of caution to Vikas, and that's never ever to venture onto the 13th floor known as the Catacomb. He once again meets Owais, who tells him that he is looking forward to quitting his job and settling down with his Irish girlfriend. Ghazni sends Vikas and Owais on an assignment to cover kidnapped journalists in one of terrorist Abu Nazir's terrorist-camps in Afghanistan.\nThe two meet Abu Nazir's brother, Khalil (Shabbir Ahluwalia), who tries to scare Vikas by killing one of the kidnapped journalists and is later revealed to be Ghazni's right hand. Vikas, shocked, takes action and fights Khalil's thugs. Khalil then shoots Owais multiple times leading to his death. Vikas jumps on a helicopter and rides away, seeing Owais get killed. Reeling at this close encounter with terrorism and watching a brutal killing, Vikas arrives in Istanbul in a daze. Ghazni finds out about Owais' death and holds a funeral. At the funeral, Vikas is approached by a former Turkish commando, Rizwan Khan (Vivek Oberoi), who hints that no senior employee has ever quit Al Johara and rattles off a list of Al Johara employees who had been killed in terrorist attacks within days of there being of rumours of their plans to quit or their resumes circulating in the job market.\nVikas remembers Owais telling him that he wants to quit his job. This makes Vikas suspicious about Al Johara being connected to terrorism. Before asking any more questions, Rizwan Khan disappears. Vikas discreetly runs a check on the names rattled off by Rizwan and discovered he was indeed telling the truth. Five Al Johara reporters before Owais had either died in a car bomb explosion, abducted and killed or simply found dead. He slowly notices that not everything is as simple as it looks in the offices of Al Johara, especially when he seems to bump into strangers whose faces he soon recognizes as suicide bombers in a couple of terrorist attacks.\nVikas, confused, accidentally goes to the forbidden 13th floor of the building and is tortured by Al Johara's staff. Lisa arrives and saves him by taking him away. Vikas goes back to his apartment only to find his passport, documents and money all missing. Later on, while buying a falafel roll, he finds a note in his pocket telling him he is being followed by Ghazni's men. While running from Ghazni's men, Vikas bumps into Rizwan, who tells him he is being tracked wherever he goes and what he does, so then Rizwan beats up Ghazni's men and removes the trackers. Rizwan tells Vikas that Abu Nazir is actually dead but being kept alive by Al Johara through videotapes by using digital images of the terrorist and doctoring old footage because the man who killed Abu Nazir was indeed Rizwan himself as he had lost his family in a blast.\nRizwan and Vikas plan to expose Al Johara by breaking into the 13th floor. First, they break the hands of a man who Vikas had seen authorising the special lift. Rizwan shoots numerous guards on his way to the 13th floor while covering Vikas. Once they reach the 13th floor, Vikas finds out the truth about how Al Johara helps terrorism increase and what they do and saves it on a pen drive while subsequently erasing the data and leaving a virus on Al Johara's computers. At the same time, Rizwan is covering Vikas by shooting any guards that come their way. Lisa helps them escape the Al Johara building and tells them that she informed Ghazni about Vikas' activities earlier so that he could trust her, but actually, she is working for RAW. Ghazni sends his men to get the pen drive back, but his men are brutally beaten up by Vikas, Rizwan and Lisa. Ghazni kills Zahir (a man that came to retrieve the pen drive) and frames the trio for the murder and putting a bounty on their heads.\nVikas calls Anjali, who tells him that she is coming to Istanbul to pick him up. This call allows Ghazni to track Vikas, and hence he and Rizwan are forced to fend off the police. Rizwan disappears, while Vikas is repeatedly chased by cops but manages to escape. On one occasion, he meets the Indian Ambassador and tries to tell her the truth, but she does not seem to believe him because Ghazni is a very respected man in Turkey. While escaping, Vikas runs into Rizwan, who takes him to the airport where Anjali is coming. Rizwan forces Vikas to let Anjali to go with Ghazni and his men because his informants are everywhere, and Vikas will probably get killed by Ghazni if he is spotted. Rizwan realises that Lisa has not yet called them and hence goes to her house with Vikas only to find her killed by Khalil. While dying, she gives her boss' contact to them, but by the time Vikas and Rizwan get there, he too is dead. Vikas then meets Ghazni and his men who are holding Anjali hostage. Anjali is tortured by Ghazni, and his men, and so is Vikas, especially when he refuses to give the pen drive. Eventually, he gives it to them because Khalil was about to shoot Anjali. After the pen drive download was complete, Khalil attempts to kill Vikas and Anjali, but an explosive fitted by Rizwan blows up, allowing Vikas to free himself. Vikas and Ghazni engage in a lengthy fight as well as Rizwan and Khalil, where Vikas and Rizwan manage to kill off their opponents.

Thereafter, he and his family purchases other luxuries such as a MioTV pay television and a ticket to the Singapore Grand Prix.\nHuang is caught in a police for speeding in Pan Island Expressway; the blame is then placed on Yang and afterwards, Yanyan covers up by telling she was the driver and was escorted to the police station; this and Huang visiting a nightclub strains their marriage. Shortly after, they are prosecuted, while Hui fails to sue the carpark management after they were issued a summon; a situation worsened by a language barrier and is possibly charged for contempt. Later, while Hui took his friends for a lunch and promoting the supplement, he sees a news broadcast that about tens of patients who were admitted to hospital showed signs of poisoning due to the supplements. After trying to claim that these were imitations, Hui called Huang to sought help but was taken by the mob somewhere to watch a viral YouTube video uploaded by Chen on promoting the supplements. An infuriated Huang called Chen to explain the matter, to which Chen reveals that he borrowed $80,000 from a loan shark to initiate a business, and now demands $100,000, with a $20,000 increase due to interests.\nDumbfounded on what to do with the remaining batches of supplements, Hui and Huang are then confronted by a few disgruntled employees; Huang told the employers to trust them and wait for the laboratory results to be released. Soon after, Huang calls Hui's friend, Mindy, for an invite; it was later revealed to be a trap set by Chen, and offered Huang to swallow a bowl of supplements as proof, but ended up in a scrawl and beaten up by Chen's henchman, before he dismisses Huang by demanding a $100,000 payment as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Qiang lodged a police report when the lawyer representative took the money from the client, but not before they received another phone call informing that their en-bloc sales failed after their committees have rejected his project proposal. To no avail, they failed to pay their mortgage loan for the bungalow and wind up settling at a house flat instead, much to Stella's chagrin.\nAt a coffee shop, the three brothers discuss their next course of action to try to rack up money; however their efforts was to no success. After meeting up again, the brothers saw Hui got a sum of money, which they realize was actually retrieved from Yang because of the scent of the crackers. After giving her entire life savings to the brothers, she was depressed but upon her friends' encouragements, acts as a beggar, but is caught and taken to custody. After the brothers learned on her misdeed and took her home, Yang suddenly collapses and was warded to a hospital. A doctor informed that Yang was still recuperating in a hospital and was discharged the day after.\nPressured by Chen's debt, Yanyan gave a $100,000 cheque to Huang to repay the debts, while he and Hui were able to dispose the supplement stocks safely. However, they are visited by the officers of Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, who ask to bring Yanyan for investigation. Huang initially denies Yanyan of any wrongdoing, after which Yanyan reveals that the $100,000 cheque was not from her father as mentioned earlier, but actually from company's funds. As she is then arrested, Huang lashes out at her. Yanyan is eventually jailed for a year for embezzlement, while Huang is found guilty of food poisoning and ordered to pay a fine.\nShortly after the arrest, Huang and Hui began their fresh jobs as a taxi driver and a cleaner respectively, while Qiang continued his en-bloc sales, happily settling their new lives. Qiang was able to rack up at least $300,000 for the sales, and some more money for Ling and Stella's involvement in a getai concert as Ghost Festival was underway.\nSoon after, Yang began to urinate whenever she goes, raising concerns to the brothers on deciding who to be the caretaker for the week. The brothers decide to take turns for caring for their mother for a week, during which they face problems (Yang's short-term memory leads to confusion on where she placed her bra and if she knew Hui had eaten, to Huang and Hui's chagrin, while Qiang had difficulty trying to find where she would sleep). Afterwards, the brothers decided to let Hui bring Yang to a retirement home. There, she collapses in shock, after seeing Hui run away and then back to his mother's side, before she is warded to the hospital's intensive care unit. Hui then admonishes Huang and Qiang for the idea, before they get concerned about the hospital expenses. The trio negotiated with the hospital's management to downsize the class, but the current condition and the risks involved lead to the management denying their request.\nThe brothers then received a talisman to burn in-front of Yang, so she would pass on quickly. Hui then burns the paper, but a frightened Qiang stops it midway, unable to bear the loss of Yang. Coincidentally, the monitor bleeps and the nurse asks them and Xiuyun to wait outside. Meanwhile, Lingling, Stella and the singers are involved in a car accident - leading to them sustaining minor injuries and putting Stella in critical condition.\nWith the accident, both Yang and Stella need blood to undergo surgery: both patients share the same blood type of O-; only two O- blood bags are left, one that has been given to a patient, and getting a new supply of bags would take time. While Qiang and Lingling share the same blood type and were eligible to donate blood, they could not due to separate reasons (Qiang's poor liver, and Lingling's anemia). Qiang then figures out that the one who got one blood bag was Yang, after which Qiang and Lingling quarrel with Huang and Hui over who to save, and Lingling racing to Yang's ward to snatch a box of blood bags, leading to a fight between them. Yang, who overheard the argument, cries and pulls the life support to end her life, to everyone's shock, and is pronounced dead soon after.\nSeven weeks following Yang's funeral, the family visited for another pot dinner while praying Yang to repent for their misdeeds and telling that they have learned a lesson on money, while thanking her for winning the first prize in a 4D lottery as forgiveness, with the winning number based on the registration number of the van which used for the transport of her coffin. The family, including Yanyan, who is released, all thank her for her guidance, while Stella thanks Yang for making the sacrifice. While eating, Huang introduces a safely-tested Supifen bark powder supplement, which becomes the key to their financial recovery later on.\nDuring the credits, Huang met his friends and discussing on the parking coupons.", "tmdb_plot": "3 brothers live in Singapore, each leading a different lifestyle.

The disturbances are originally thought to be aftershocks left over from a supposed massive earthquake on the Kanto Fault that occurred two years previously, causing hundreds of thousands of casualties and several hundred billion dollars in damage (possibly referencing the real-life Fukuoka earthquake or the Miyagi earthquake), although careful analysis of the evidence suggests otherwise.\nAs time goes on, all of Tokyo begins to suffer from abnormal earth tremors similar to those registered in 2005. The tremors are found not to be caused by an earthquake, but by a gigantic octopus that has been dormant for centuries. It has since been awakened by mankind and now sees Tokyo as a new feeding-ground; the filmmakers document the catastrophe as it unfolds.\nIt starts as Erin and Sarah are talking about filming Tokyo. The scene then switches to the interior of Erin's car as the two drive to LAX, to catch their flight to Tokyo. In Tokyo they rent a hotel room, and, the next day, Sarah films Erin talking with the global warming minister.

After leveling the city, Guilala transforms into a giant ball of fire and flies across Hokkaid\u014d, making its way to the G8 Summit. The Prime Minister of Japan proposes cancelling the summit for the safety of all involved, but the President of the United States convinces the other world leaders to personally stay and fight. Shortly after forming a world alliance, each leader stays to fight for their own reasons:\n\nUnited States - To boost his ratings in the polls.\nFrance - To make a move on a pretty Japanese interpreter.\nGreat Britain - To assist their ally, the United States.\nGermany - To put an end to sexism by the German Parliament.\nCanada - To accompany the German leader for her safety.\nItaly - Believes that Ancient Roman philosophies will stop Guilala.\nRussia - Feels left out by the group and because Russia is close to Japan (where Guilala might head for next.)\nJapan - Joins the group majority agreeing to stop Guilala.The leaders soon discover the reason for Guilala's appearance on Earth was due to a Chinese satellite that fell out of orbit and was the crashed \"meteorite\" in Sapporo. Assisting the leaders is Dr. Sano, a Japanese scientist who discovers that Guilala is actually a cosmic spore attached to the probe that was exposed to Earth's atmosphere, causing it to grow into the monster. He also figures out that the crash caused Guilala to lose a lot of energy and it is searching for \"high temperature\" energy to recharge. The doctor does not think the monster will leave Japan until it finds the energy it needs. Meanwhile, Guilala arrives at the Noboribetsu power plant and sucks all of the energy out of the plant.\nHoping to trap Guilala, the Japanese set up an earthquake generator near Sh\u014dwa-shinzan to draw Guilala to a magma flow and destroy him with a super missile known as the Vulture. Guilala arrives to feed, but he swallows the missile whole when it is fired at him. Soon, other countries are scrambling with their own \"super\" weapons, but each one fails in comedic fashion. In the middle of all this, the Japanese Prime Minister is waylaid by diarrhea and is replaced by Junzaburo Ohizumi, a former Prime Minister and a friend of the U.S. President. He arrives to help in the battle, but seems shifty. Ohizumi even suggests using nuclear weapons, but is stared down by the other leaders.\nWhen Guilala's mind is damaged by a British brainwashing weapon, the monster begins a wild rampage. Ohizumi suddenly reveals that he is in fact the Supreme leader of the \"North Country\" (North Korea's Kim Jong-Il). He stole Ohizumi's identity during a state visit. He reveals that the Japanese interpreters attending the G8 Summit are all his spies and they all draw weapons, taking the world leaders hostage. He also announces that he plans on using a \"limited\" nuclear warhead to destroy Guilala. Meanwhile, President Sorkozy (sic) of France has finally bedded the translator, who confesses her true identity. Clad only in a towel, Sorkozy creates a distraction, which allows Japanese soldiers to rush the spies. The North Country leader is captured but not before managing to launch the nuclear missile at Guilala. Dr. Sano announces that Guilala's spores are re-energized and that if the missile strikes, it will spread Guilala spores worldwide.\nMeanwhile, two Japanese journalists named Sumire Sumidagawa and Sanpei Toyama discover a hidden village full of worshipers. They are driven out as outsiders intruding on a sacred ceremony. Shortly afterwards, Guilala lands and begins searching for energy. Sumire and Sanpei are sent to get news on Guilala's rampage. However, their efforts prove unsuccessful, as other news groups are looking for big news on Guilala. During the G8 Summit's efforts to stop Guilala, Sumire encounters a boy she saw at the village's ceremony. Believing that the village might know how to stop Guilala, Sumire and Sanpei return for answers.\nThey find a carving of Guilala which they also notice is battling another monster. That figure is known as Take-Majin, a deity that the villagers worship. An ancient prophecy predicted that Guilala was going to destroy the world, but he would be stopped by Take-Majin, who would awaken to save mankind from Guilala. The little boy Sumire met earlier worshiped Take-Majin, after his father was killed in a landslide. Concerned with the planet's safety over their own, Sumire and a reluctant Sanpei participate in Take-Majin's awakening ceremony. Just when Take-Majin is about to wake up, the entire village is evacuated by the army when the nuclear missile launched by North Country begins to approach Guilala.\nJust in time, Take-Majin suddenly awakens and stops the missile by catching it with his buttocks, allowing it to explode inside his body harmlessly. He then confronts Guilala, preparing for battle. After a long battle, Take-Majin is victorious, decapitating Guilala and saving all humanity as prophesied. Take-Majin then returns into his shrine to sleep once again.

A visibly shaken Santiago warns Gauge that Shadow Rock's leader, Colonel Briggs, is involved in the plot; however, once assured that Briggs has been detained and Gauge is now Shadow Rock's commander, he details his activities, which included planting wire taps and spying on the operations of Just Rite. Santiago berates himself for following his orders \u2013 to spy but not get involved \u2013 too closely, as he could have stopped the plan before it progressed to its current stage, which he claims could be the extinction of humanity.\nPrior to this, Just Rite security officials pursue an escaped girl, Hannah (Jessica Heap) through a seemingly abandoned mill, capturing and killing her before disposing of her body in a boiler.\nJust Rite CEO Braylon (Richard Zeringue) meets with his security commander, Sykes (Tony Senzamici) who informs him of the events at the mill. Braylon entrusts Sykes with cleaning up the situation, as some potential investors in his new sugar formula will be visiting the mill soon. It is revealed that Braylon intends to create a new type of sugar with an additive more addictive than crack cocaine and heroin combined, and to that end, he has hired Sergei (Armando Leduc) to conduct experiments in the mill. The men under Sykes's command were directed to abduct addicts and homeless people for Sergei's experiments, reasoning that nobody would be looking for such people if they disappeared. He is more enraged by Sykes's men accidentally abducting Ryan (Derrick Denicola), the brother of Braylon's secretary Erin (Sharon Landry), in the course of abducting Hannah, than he is by Hannah's escape and death. It is revealed that previous batches of sugar devised by Sergei caused infections in their test subjects, and even though Hannah was previously designated \"status clear,\" Braylon and Sergei are confident she was an anomaly, as no other subjects from the most recent batch became infected.\nRyan and Erin's father Griff (Louis Herthum), a Just Rite security guard dealing with alcoholism following his wife's death, discovers strange shipments being made to a supposedly abandoned sugar mill \u2013 which is also being observed by Santiago \u2013 and learns that Braylon has hired Shadow Rock to guard it independently of his usual security team. Meanwhile, Erin begins receiving strange e-mails at her desk from a mysterious figure calling themselves \"Cinderella.\" Apparently a mole within Just Rite, Cinderella first sends Erin financial documents showing money being spent on the abandoned mill, then a photograph of Ryan in his holding cell. Together, Griff and Erin realize that Ryan must be at the mill, and resolve to rescue him.\nSergei makes an ominous discovery \u2013 the latest batch of sugar, which was shipped out when it was verified clear, actually is infected as well, with the infection manifesting three months after ingestion. Upon receiving this news, Sykes gives up on the plan and decides to call in Shadow Rock's extermination team. Sergei pulls a gun, but Sykes kills him.\nErin and Griff infiltrate the mill by hiding inside a truck. While roaming around searching for Ryan, they encounter Sykes and prepare for a confrontation. However, Sykes reveals that he is Cinderella and joins them, escorting them to Ryan's cell. While they are reunited, Braylon escorts his potential investors around the mill, proudly showing them some of the test subjects. He explains while showing them one failed subject that the infection in the previous sugar batches attacks the victim's brain and breaks down their body, a point made clear when he shows them the longest-surviving subject, whose body has melted in many places. However, when Braylon opens the door of a subject he believes is \"status clear,\" the subject is actually infected and attacks them. While one of Braylon's guards kills the infected subject, it is not before a security alarm is tripped that puts the entire mill on lockdown. This leaves Erin, Ryan, Griff and Sykes to escape through the ward where the most dangerous subjects are kept; meanwhile, Braylon and his investors escape and when the investors refuse to play any role in Braylon's plan, Braylon kills them both.\nThe Shadow Rock forces led by Gauge arrive at the mill and begin exterminating the infected. Erin, Ryan, Griff and Sykes manage to escape, but Sykes is shot and gets separated from the group in the confusion, and Ryan discovers that despite being \"status clear\" earlier, the boils characteristic of an infection have developed on his arm. Colonel Briggs (Marc Gill) suddenly appears and begins killing Gauge's men after freeing the trapped Braylon. He ambushes Gauge and shoots him in the shoulder, and the two briefly exchange gunfire while discussing the internal coup Gauge staged against Briggs. Gauge gives up when his gun runs out of bullets and steps out, inviting Briggs to shoot him; however, Briggs discards his gun and rushes Gauge, allowing Gauge the chance to stab him in the stomach with his knife. Gauge then finishes the injured Briggs off with the bullet remaining in his gun's chamber.\nRyan, Erin and Griff reunite with Sykes outside the mill, who reveals that he has rigged the entire mill with a self-destruct mechanism that he needs to be close to the building to activate. Revealing his infection, Ryan volunteers to drive the dying Sykes back into the mill.

He has a rising reputation with the students of his new school due to an internet video of him when he was a football player at his previous school fighting with a frustrated opponent player who makes derogatory remarks about Jake's father. Initially Jake has trouble fitting into his new school and while walking he sees Max Cooperman supposedly being beaten up by bullies. When Jake tries to intervene, he is told off by Max and his friends as the \"bullying\" was actually a consensual mixed martial arts fight. Later on, Jake is invited by classmate Baja Miller (whom he develops a crush on) to a party where he is unwillingly pulled into a fight with the MMA champion at the school, Ryan McCarthy, who is also Baja's boyfriend.

In retaliation, the United States bombs Venezuela, accusing that country of instigating the attack.\nRachel Armstrong (Kate Beckinsale), an ambitious reporter for the Washington D.C. paper Capital Sun-Times, is preparing to publish a report that alleges that the Lyman administration knowingly lied to Congress and the American public by blaming Venezuela for the assassination attempt, and that the Administration received a CIA report by an operative who had investigated the Venezuela connection and found that they were not at all linked to the assassination attempt. The report also reveals that the CIA operative is Erica Van Doren (Vera Farmiga), whose daughter Alison attends the same school as Timmy, Rachel's son. Rachel confronts Van Doren at a soccer match, and requests confirmation. Erica refuses to cooperate but gives herself away by losing her temper over \"irresponsible journalists\". Rachel, who has no doubts about the veracity of the report, publishes her story and it becomes front-page news with the full support of editor Bonnie Benjamin (Angela Bassett) and legal counsel Avril Aaronson (Noah Wyle).\nBecause revealing a covert operative's identity is a treasonous offence if committed by a government employee, and because any individual leaking such sensitive and secret information constitutes a threat to national security, special Federal prosecutor Patton Dubois (Matt Dillon) convenes a grand jury to identify and prosecute that person. But when Dubois asks her to name the government employee who was her source, she refuses to give any answer at all. A high-profile attorney, Albert Burnside (Alan Alda), who was hired by the newspaper to defend Rachel and boasted that his personal friendship with Judge Hall will facilitate matters, is shocked when his client is jailed for contempt of court for failing to answer. Burnside admonishs the judge for making \"a big mistake\", warning \"sometimes a mistake is like wearing white after labour day, and sometimes a mistake is invading Russia in winter\".\nDays become weeks, weeks turn to months, and in the meantime Van Doren is murdered in front of her home by a political fanatic with a gun. Rachel is aggressed by inmates in prison, but still steadfastly defends the principle of confidentiality, a position that eventually estranges her husband Ray (David Schwimmer) who like Dubois imagines that she's protecting a government employee, alienates her young son Timmy (Preston Bailey), and costs her embattled newspaper millions of dollars in fines and legal fees. However, Dubois is only interested in Armstrong's original source. Armstrong pleads to Dubois that she could never give up her source as they would now be seen as responsible for the murder of Van Doren. Burnside even appeals her case before the Supreme Court, arguing that without protection of sources then there is no freedom of the press, perhaps ultimately no democracy, but the court decides against him 5\u20134, citing the overriding concern of national security.\nEventually, Judge Hall accepts that Armstrong will never give in and divulge her source. And so, convinced that incarcerating her can serve no useful purpose, and since she has not been convicted of any offence, decides to release her from jail. On the day she is released, Dubois has the U.S. Marshals arrest her, and charges her for obstruction of justice, and convinces her to take a deal for a shortened sentence rather than go to trial. She agrees to two years in prison, with the possibility of early parole for good behavior.

As the Marines leave, one Marine remains and makes his way towards the exit. The Marine's name is Jesse Rodriguez (Freddy Rodriguez). The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return.\nBack at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzm\u00e1n) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce. While at the park, Ozzy spots Alexis (Manny P\u00e9rez), the man who killed his brother, recently been released from prison. Ozzy stares at Alexis, and Alexis stares back, however, before Ozzy is able to make his way to Alexis, both Jesse and Johnny hold him back then they make their way to Edy's store.\nJesse's sister Roxanna (Vanessa Ferlito) arrives by taxi, although everyone assumes she came in a limo because they all assume that she made it big in Hollywood as an actress. Jesse's Brother Mauricio (John Leguizamo) also arrives, along with his wife Sarah (Debra Messing). Sarah greets Anna and it is evident that she is not exactly comfortable around her in-laws but she is making an effort, even speaking a bit of Spanish. However, the topic drifts towards children and Anna makes it very clear that she wants grandchildren, but Sarah is a very business driven woman and isn't ready for kids, this causes some tension between Sarah, Anna, and Mauricio. After things settle down, everyone sits down and begins to catch up and each person\u2019s story is brought up: Jesse has just returned from a three-year tour in Iraq and is being prepared by Edy to take up the family business; Roxanna is waiting on news regarding a new TV deal; and Mauricio is an attorney and Sarah is in finances and making a great deal of money, but don't have time for much else. The conversation moves towards Jesse's experience in Iraq, but he does not want to talk about it (important later). Soon after, Marissa (Melonie Diaz), her son, and her boyfriend Fernando (Ramses Jimenez) arrive. Marissa is Roxanna's best friend from childhood, and Jesse's ex-girlfriend. It is evident that Jesse still has feelings for Marissa and vice versa, but there is much tension in the air.\nAfter everyone has arrived, they all sit down for Christmas dinner. Everyone is digging into an abundant pile of food, chatting away, while Sarah sits there with a look of awe on her face as she has never experienced the holidays with Mauricio's family. Edy is about to give a toast to everyone but gets a call, it seems that Edy has been getting a lot of calls, and often runs out when he does which gets Anna suspicious that he is having an affair, and cheating on her again (there was one previous incident in the past). Well, when the phone rings during Edy's toast, he stops to answer the call, and having broken the last straw, Anna proclaims that she is divorcing Edy. At first everyone thinks this is a joke, but it is soon evident that Anna is dead serious. Edy reacts with little emotion, saying that if it is what Anna wants then he can't really do anything about it. Mauricio is vehemently against this and tries to get some support from Jesse, whose response is similar to his father's, which angers Mauricio further. At this time, Johnny, Ozzy, Marissa and Fernando excuse themselves as it is a family matter. After more arguing, everyone leaves to vent, except for Sarah, who stays at her seat and continues eating, sort of a gesture of comfort/support to Anna; and the two have a somewhat awkward yet endearing bonding moment.\nLater that night, Mauricio is up in the attic thinking about the night's events when Roxanna shows up. The two share a drink and Jesse shows up. The siblings reminisce about their childhood and what the future will be like after their parents divorce. Both Roxanna and Jesse are relatively neutral on the matter, but Mauricio is very against them. Being the only one of the three to be married, he believes that after 36 years of marriage, their parents have to have at least some love for each other, and that there is always a chance to salvage what remains of their marriage and he says all this while in his underwear (humorous scene).\nIn the morning, Jesse catches up with Marissa while she is walking to work. She still hasn't forgiven him for leaving her several years ago. As it turns out, Jesse didn't want to stay in town and follow in his father's footsteps and ended up enlisting in the Marines. While in Iraq, his unit was holed up in a building for the night, Lenny offered to take Jesse's watch so he can grab something to eat. While Jesse is getting some food, a rocket propelled grenade is shot into the building and Lenny is killed, while everyone else is injured. Ever since then, Jesse blames himself for Lenny's death since it was supposed to be his watch, and his life that would be lost. Marissa sympathizes and forgives him.\nBack at the house, Mauricio is attempting to get Anna and Edy back together by bringing over their priest, Father Torres (Manny Sosa). Anna returns home and Mauricio brings her into the kitchen. Anna is clearly drunk and is very upset. Another argument ensues and everyone is at each other's throats. Mauricio argues with Anna regarding having children, Roxanna reveals that shes not a star and can barely make ends meet. Both Mauricio and Roxanna think Jesse has it easy, since he gets the store to manage as soon as he returned. However, Jesse doesn't want to manage the store and his guilt over Lenny's death has been haunting him since his return. After more arguing, everyone leaves. Roxanna, Jesse and Mauricio end up in a bar to drink/party to vent off some tension.\nSarah gets back to the house and finds out that everyone has left. Edy offers to give her a ride to the bar where everyone is. While driving Sarah to the bar to meet the others, Edy appears to have a heart attack and stomps on the brakes. Luckily, they skid into a parking area and no one is injured; Sarah is able to fetch Edy's medication from the glove box in time. As Sarah looks at the bottles, she realizes that Edy is really very ill and that that's the reason he's getting those phone calls (the doctor). Edy makes her promise to not tell anyone, since he doesn't want anyone to worry so they can enjoy the holidays.\nAt the bar, everyone takes the chance to have some fun, drinking and dancing. Sarah gets hammered and starts dancing with Mauricio. Everyone is having a blast and Jesse takes the time to talk to Marissa. Roxanna, receives a call from her agent (with no actual news regarding the new part), goes outside to answer the phone and have a smoke. While Roxanna is out having a smoke, Ozzy comes out to talk to her. Ozzy likes Roxanna, but she is a bit apprehensive as she sees him as a gang-member type person, although Marissa has noted that he hasn't been part of that crowd for quite some time.\nRoxanna and Ozzy go to the local ice rink to talk, and Roxanna tells him that she really isn't much of a star since she has only had a few small roles on TV and in commercials and can't really get a big part. Ozzy assures her that she will get her big break, but she is not so sure. Roxanna mentions returning home since her career isn't going anywhere, and her mom may need her around during the divorce. Ozzy is happy that Roxanna may stay, but is supportive of her career.\nThe next day, everyone prepares to have a little Christmas carol parade, where people travel from house to house caroling, and people join along the way until nearly the entire neighborhood has joined in. The parade ends with everyone arriving at the church for a big party/dinner. Everyone is dancing and having fun. Fernando goes off to get something to drink and Jesse asks Marissa for a dance. The two begins to get close and Jesse leans in to kiss her, just as Fernando lunges in and hits Jesse. Jesse pummels Fernando before his friends drag him off. While this is happening, Ozzy can't take it anymore and leaves to confront Alexis. Alexis is returning home with his mother and sees Ozzy. Knowing what Ozzy has come to do, he tells his mother to go into the house and make dinner, while he goes outside with Ozzy. Outside, Alexis tells Ozzy that he's ready to die, and has been for many years while in prison. Ozzy is visibly struggling to decide whether or not to kill Alexis, just then, his phone rings, it's Roxanna. Ozzy gives up, and lets Alexis live, and leaves to meet Roxanna. Ozzy and Roxanna go to the river, where he gets rid of the gun, and the two kiss.\nEdy is now alone in the kitchen, drinking. Jesse and Mauricio return home and join their father, each drinking to their own little problems. Edy, decides to do one last thing for Anna and finally cut down that tree so the three go outside and secure the tree to a chain that is connected to the rear bumper of Edy's car. Edy guns the engine but the rear bumper comes off and he crashes into a parked car, injuring himself.\nAnna calls the ambulance and Edy is rushed off to the hospital. Before the ambulance leaves, Sarah runs out to Anna and hands her all of Edy's medications since she's the only one who knows how serious his health is. The whole family is at the hospital to check on Edy. It turns out that Edy has cancer, it's serious but he's being treated for it. Anna finally realizes that Edy was not cheating on her, and that the Susan that Edy was talking to was actually his oncologist. The couple make their peace and profess love for each other, and then Anna smacks Edy for being stupid and not telling her sooner.\nBack at the house, Anna is teaching Roxanna and Sarah how to cook with moderate success. Roxanna gets a call from her agent, and when she returns, it appears as she has not gotten the part. Outside the house, Ozzy comes by to talk to Roxanna and she reveals that she actually did get the part, but it wasn't a very big part anyway, and she thought it would be best to stick with her family during these times, so she turned down the part.\nJesse visits Marissa to drop off some Christmas presents and to apologize for his behavior the previous night. She forgives him, but she has a relationship with Fernando now and a happy family life. Jesse concedes and wishes her a happy life. After leaving, Jesse sits on a park bench, making a call to Lenny's parents to tell them about their son and how he died so he can get closure and move on.\nAfter discharge from the hospital, Edy takes Jesse to his store, Jesse has decided to take up the family business instead of going back to Iraq.", "tmdb_plot": "It\u2019s Christmastime and the far-flung members of the Rodriguez family are converging at their parents\u2019 home in Chicago to celebrate the season and rejoice in their youngest brother\u2019s safe return from combat overseas.", "tmdb_id": "25852", "wiki_id": "17203681"}, {"title": "Novel", "genres": ["Family", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Sethunath (Jayaram) is a prosperous business man and also a writer.

Hamer, briefs the men to be ready. After being inserted, the team finds a local guide, Abdul, in a village in Southern Afghanistan, where Aban is from. Together, they go to the mountains, where the cleric has a reputation for hiding.\nAs they go further into the mountains, they begin to have strange encounters. First, they are ambushed by gunmen who kill Trinoski. The team returns fire, killing multiple gunmen, but when they check the bodies, they have disappeared. That night, the team spots headlights of a vehicle approaching. However, the two lights separate and then speedily fly into the sky and disappear. After speculating on what the lights may have been, they radio for a helicopter to resupply them. The next day, they cannot get reception on their radio or GPS. Their truck, damaged from the ambush, is struggling to move up the mountain. At night, the team hears a helicopter approaching, though they cannot spot it. As their radio is not working, they attempt to signal the helicopter. As the helicopter, still unseen, seems to be directly on top of them, the noise abruptly stops (something that shouldn't be physically possible). Meanwhile, the radio picks up what sounds like Persian or Arabic, but no one can understand it. They cache Trinoski's body so that they can move to a safer position for the night. The next morning, the team finds parts of Trinoski's body strewn out across rocks. Further up the mountain, they spot strange, triangular markers made of sticks across the mountain's surface. As they continue on foot with their mission in the rocky and barren landscape, fatigue, frustration and confusion take their toll on the members of the team and they come across a cave. Inside, they find an old man who gives them shelter and refills their canteens. Sergeant Sadler notices that under the man's robes, he appears to be wearing a nineteenth-century British army uniform. Sadler tells the others of a legend of how a British regiment disappeared in Afghanistan's mountains, leaving only one survivor. In the morning Sergeant Cole observes the old man apparently talking to himself, but when Cole looks through his night vision goggles, he sees a group of men with swords in black robes. Panicking, the soldier opens fire, accidentally killing the old man. Abdul says they must bury the body, but Keynes orders the team to move on in case the enemy heard them. Degeteau develops horrible stomach pains. As he tries to drink from a canteen, he finds that it is filled with sand, as are the containers of everyone else. Further on, Abdul is surprised to find that there is an entire valley that wasn't there previously. Tensions further increase when the team encounters a bright light at night. As Tanner and Cole try to flank the light, they're immediately vaporized. The next morning, Abdul warns Keynes that they are dealing with something that is beyond human conception; he then commits suicide by stepping off a cliff.\nAs the team progresses further, the remaining soldiers confront Keynes and demand the truth. Keynes shows them a recording from his thermal imaging camera and informs them about the real motive. The thermal video shows a triangular object in the desert. Being nearly invisible to the naked eye, it lifts off the ground after three (supposed) men, including Mohammed Aban, walk to it and vanishes right in front of Keynes' eyes. It was this object that killed the men. The CIA has been monitoring this since 1980 and sent Keynes and the team there to further investigate it. The whole time, Keynes has been recording with his special thermal camera and sending the images to Langley via an advanced laser aimed at CIA satellites. Keynes theorizes that this object originates from an ancient Indian mythology called 'Vimanas', a sort of UFO-related phenomenon that occurred when Alexander the Great rode through this area of land as he was conquering, and the bright lights and the ghostly gunmen are associated with it. He also explains that the team is 'expendable', and they will not be rescued, which causes a brief scuffle with the agitated team leader, who disappears the next morning.\nRunning out of ammunition, water and food, the team wanders further into the desert where they finally encounter the vimanas at what appears to be the location that the British regiment was destroyed. Sadler, overwhelmed with fear, opens fire upon the seemingly invisible vimanas only to be vaporized. Keynes flees with Degetau and abandons him later, as he is too sick to continue, and later hears his screams before being obliterated by the objects. Exhausted and traumatized, Keynes searches for water. He encounters an oasis and drinks water from it only to discover the body of Hamer lying next to the water. Unable to grasp the horror, he passes out. When he wakes up, he hears the distant sound of a helicopter and fires his flare gun. Simultaneously, several flares fire up from the valley. The bright light he encountered earlier re-appears and two beings from it approach him. As it touches his forehead, he sees visions and hallucinations of various objects and landscapes from his previous encounters, causing him to go into a trance. He is shown floating several inches above a bed with a talisman he took from Aban's home in his hand, inside a hospital room, where doctors and a military colonel are watching him through a glass window.

The remaining crew decide to recover the Hellfire Cross as part of their plan to relaunch their ship.\nAfter receiving visions from Athena (Sonya Salomaa), Odysseus realizes the mysterious woman is not what she seems. She uses her powers to transform into Odysseus's wife Penelope (Leah Gibson) and seduces him. Her failure to account for Penelope aging since the last time Odysseus saw her makes him realize the illusion, but only after he has sex with her. Odysseus and his remaining men realize her true identity: Persephone, the wife of Hades who has been banished to the Isle of the Mists and sealed there by the Hellfire Cross. Persephone reveals that the winged creatures are her children by Hades, and that she plans to escape the island with them to rule the world. Furthermore, she is now pregnant with a son by Odysseus.\nOdysseus and his men escape to the cave where the Hellfire Cross is sealed and obtain it, however, all but Odysseus and Homer die. They are confronted by Persephone, who thanks them for her freedom and attempts to convince Odysseus to serve her, as the Hellfire Cross cannot be wielded by a god. When he refuses, she tells them she will merely wait until her mortal son is born and ages instead. She starts to set the winged creatures free on the world and attempts to force Odysseus to cut his own throat, but he overcomes her power and impales her through the stomach, killing Persephone, their son and all the creatures. Some time after Persephone's death, Odysseus and Homer return to the sea and continue back to Ithaca.\nCompleting his story, the aged Homer muses about the origins of the winged creatures, how they could only be killed by a stake through the heart, and how they fear the sign of the cross.

They have not felt ready to get married until now, Johnny asking her which coincides with his announcement that he has been accepted into the FBI training program in Washington, DC. Rain isn't sure if she is prepared to move, since her mother, Irene, has long been institutionalized in a local psychiatric institution diagnosed as schizophrenic, she inching closer to being in a vegetative state. Under this circumstance, Rain was raised by her Aunt Barbara (\"Auntie Apple\"), a devout Catholic who has long assimilated into western society and who turns to local priest Father Bartoli for any guidance. One day, after Rain swerves to avoid some children in the road and winds up in a car accident, Johnny swears there were none. What Rain eventually confides to Johnny is that she of late has been seeing visions of things she doesn't understand, she fearing that she may be going the way of her mother. She is later transferred to a psychiatric institution; when Johnny challenges Auntie Apple and tries to force his way to her, his hotheadedness gets him arrested. Rain eventually finds out the children she's been seeing running around the community are not living children, but the spirits of dead children. Through visions and investigations she discovers these unquiet dead are the little girls and boys who were murdered at the Indian boarding school that used to kidnap, institutionalize, and abuse children in the community. She realizes that the spirits of the children are speaking to her so the truth can come to light and that, maybe, the community can finally find healing.In Story Two, Luke Patterson (Bradley Cooper), a government geologist, has come to the area to investigate a reported earthquake - if it be the case, a rare earthquake - on the reservation. Beyond Johnny helping him get a city hall permit to investigate on the reservation, Luke befriends Johnny and his family during his extended stay in the area and begins to learn more about the history behind the reservation and the local boarding school from Johnny's father Pete.\nIn Story Three, Steve Klamath is running for mayor against the long time incumbent, Paul Gunderson, who has always been pro-development on the reservation. As the campaign progresses, Steve, who wants to fight for indigenous rights from the inside of the establishment, seems to be waging a losing battle both within the Native population as they historically stay home on voting day, and with the non-Native population who largely viewing him with contempt for his policies. Local radio talk show host Richard Two Rivers (Wes Studi), who is seen as the voice of the reservation, outwardly gives Steve's campaign airtime if only because it is Steve's side who contacts the radio station about the campaign, although his background shows Richard may not be who he is as perceived by the public.", "tmdb_plot": "The truth of the past come to light in a series of haunting visions in this drama.

After six hours of questioning, the cop, Officer Gina Santer, and Detective 'Bub' Bailey let him go, but instruct him to turn over any information he obtains on the client that claimed Santer was his wife. Most of the info on file at Strachey Investigations about this mystery client is fake. Meanwhile, at the home of Dorothy 'Dot' Fisher and her partner Edith Strong, Dorothy chases out a vandal after he breaks into their home and spray paints homophobic graffiti on their wall. The next day, Andrew McWhirter, close friend of Fisher and Strong\u2014and Timmy Callhan's former boyfriend\u2014introduce Donald and Timmy to the lesbian couple after a contentious school board meeting at which Dorothy, a guidance counselor at the school, is placed on paid leave due to objections from a homophobic parent whose gay son Derek has been counseled by Fisher. The two are invited by the women and houseguest Andrew back to their home in Hollis, but the socialization is interrupted when the returning vandal throws a brick through the window. Strachey chases him back to his car, but the license plate is obscured by mud.\nThe following day, Kenny gives Don pictures he obtained of the mysterious \"client\", and his e-mail address, the one piece of info he offered about himself that is at least a marginal lead. With no other pressing cases, Strachey returns to Hollis, investigating motives for the vandalism. Dorothy suspects the homophobic Joey Deems, who attends the school he works at, but his father Carl tells Donald that he believes the motive is more likely a resentful backlash against Fisher's decision not to sell her house to Millipond Realty, who wants to build a large mall along Moon Road, the street the Deems, Dot & Edith, and other residents, who all received offers on their properties, live on.\nStrachey manages to discover a connection between Millipond and Colter Investigations, a rival P.I. firm. That night, after an abortive attempt by Andrew to seduce Donald, close to the Fisher home, a fire breaks out inside their barn. Upon investigation, Donald also discovers a body in the barn, which later turns out to be that of Leo Colter, the head of the aforementioned P.I. firm. Strachey sneaks into the Colter offices and purloins some sensitive files. Later, he exchanges the faux client's e-mail address for a copy of the autopsy report on Colter's body, courtesy of Bailey.\nIn Hollis, a distraught Derek visits Dorothy in a desperate plea for help, but his father Jonas arrives, and informs Fisher she can now expect to have her position with the school fully terminated. Donald discusses the results of the autopsy report with Dorothy and warns her that he suspects foul play, and that Dorothy may have to contend with even more than the loss of her job and the barrage of vandalism and arson. Strachey's visit is cut short by a call from Kenny, who has been tailing Santer as part of his field experience requirements. He discovers that Santer has been having coffee with the same mysterious \"client\" that hired Donald to track her under false pretenses. Donald returns to Albany in time to observe both participants in the coffee date going their separate ways. Kenny manages to stick with Santer, but Strachey's attempts to tail the mystery guy are derailed by one of his former disgruntled clients. Coming up with a Plan B, Donald joins Kenny at Sturgis Development, which was Santer's destination. She is working undercover, investigating allegations of fraud. She tells him his mystery client's name-Peter Garritty, who is also in the real estate business.\nSensing that things aren't adding up, Donald interrupts a lunch date between Tim and his former flame, outright accusing Andrew of being involved in the shady dealings he's uncovered. A defensive McWhirter denies knowing Garritty, and shoots back that Donald is still pissed for the pass Andrew made earlier. Tim, who was unaware of the incident until now, runs out of his office, but Donald assures him that the attraction\u2014and \"action\" the previous night\u2014weren't mutual, and that he doesn't even trust McWhirter, let alone like him.\nBack in Hollis, Strachey presses Dorothy on the lack of records about \"Edith Strong\" before 1972. Later, Strachey talks to \"Edith\" alone; she breaks down and confesses the details of her past to him. Her birth name was Laura Whitaker. As a young girl, she, like Dorothy, was an activist. During an attempt to protest the Vietnam War, a planned bombing of an empty courthouse went terribly wrong, accidentally killing a close friend of Laura's. Furthermore, Edith/Laura knows that Joey Deems has been vandalizing her and Dorothy's home\u2014because she asked him to do it. Not too long ago, a man called her and threatened to expose her to the police and Dorothy if she failed to convince her stubborn partner to sell their home. Later, Edith finds out that Dorothy has already known about her past as Laura for some time now, and it changed nothing as far as Dot's feelings for her or their relationship was concerned. Dot suddenly yells for help, letting Strachey know that Andrew has apparently been kidnapped, as per a video clip e-mailed to her showing him being held hostage and ending with a demand for a $500,000 ransom. Strachey, with Santer's assistance, arranges for Sturgis to buy out Dot and Edith's home at the steeply overvalued price of half a million dollars, which would enable the couple to meet the ransom demand.\nStrachey then breaks into Garritty's office, uncovering a much broader conspiracy that is appearing to link all the players he has met so far in some way, one centered on various parties outmaneuvering each other until the winner is able to cash in on the lucrative deal to sell all the properties along Moon Road\u2014a deal worth a total of $40 million\u2014but his research is interrupted by Garritty's arrival. Strachey surprises Garritty and persuades him to answer many of his questions, but this is also interrupted\u2014by gunshots fired by an unknown assailant. Garritty uses the distraction to evade further interrogation by the P.I.\nAfter another session with Carl Deems in which he is more forthcoming about his frustration with Fisher's resistance to the Moon Road real estate deal, blocking his ambition to sell his own property, Donald discovers Carl's clearly closeted son Joey being intimate with his openly gay classmate Derek. Joey confesses to vandalizing Dorothy's house, but truthfully denies being involved with the later fire, let alone Colter's murder.\nGame time arrives. As the midnight deadline for the ransom money approaches, Santer arrives at Dot and Edith's place with the money in cash, courtesy of Sturgis. Strachey catches Santer off guard, tricking her into admitting (with a nearby Garritty listening) that she plans to cut him out the profitable real estate deal. Garritty emerges from hiding amongst the bushes, objecting to the ad hoc ruse, after which Santer reveals herself as an undercover cop. Strachey then confronts her with his knowledge of her attempt on Garritty's life hours earlier, as well as her murdering of Colter. The P.I. then exposes Andrew's collusion with Garritty as well, having unearthed that the kidnapping was entirely staged, leading McWhirter, who is also hiding nearby, to show himself. The greedy Santer and Garritty, both armed, shoot each other, leaving McWhirter to take the cash. Strachey chases him into the barn and confronts him for hurting Dot and Edith\u2014he was the mystery blackmailer. McWhirter gets the drop on Strachey and is about to shoot him, but Dot is close by, and hits him from behind with a softball bat.\nThe next day Donald finally breaks through to Jonas by showing him autopsy pictures of young suicides, warning him that Derek could wind up the same way without his help. Strachey gives him a card for The Trevor Project, which Jonas rejected as a recruiting tool for homosexuals when Dot referred Derek to it earlier, but now accepts as a valid source of psychological assistance, leading him and his son to reconcile and likely avoiding the fate Donald warned of. Back home, as Donald and Tim put this latest case behind them, they discuss Dot's reinstatement to her position at the school and a plea bargain that should make it so the worst Edith will have to endure is a year of house arrest, which she will get through fine with Dot by her side.", "tmdb_plot": "Donald Strachey is a gay private investigator who learns of a local school's decision to chastise a lesbian teacher for speaking openly about her sexuality.

After asking Bertrand to describe his experience in the coffin, the man eventually takes him to a countryside mansion, the headquarters to a cult called The Kingdom.\nBook I \u2013 The Nature of War\nThe cult's leader, Uma (Asia Argento), a young woman who tapes her breasts and wears conservative clothing, tells Bertrand that if he wants \u201cpleasure\u201d, he must join them in their \u201cwar\u201d. Although initially uncomfortable about being denied access to a phone, and unsettled by the sexual advances of a younger member, Maria (L\u00e9a Seydoux), Bertrand soon befriends a fellow member called Rachel and finds himself taking part in activities designed to bring him closer to the \u201cpure existence\u201d experienced by people like the Native Americans (photos of whom line the walls of the mansion).\nThese activities include: trust exercises; crawling up and down a sand patch on all fours; touching, and being touched by, a partner; wandering the woods in animal masks; simulated sex; receiving a form of communion from Uma; and listening to Uma read pornography. After the group spend a long evening dancing in the woods, Bertrand watches a woman in a Venetian mask strip naked and drift into the river. Unable to swim, he sits on the bank and watches.\nHis two-week trial period with the cult complete, he returns to the city and attempts to explain what he's been through to his girlfriend, Louise, making mention of his transcendent moment with the woman in the river.

Around this time, he also starts to move in and out of a dream-state, imagining that he's a soldier in a trench fighting against an unseen enemy. His \"beautiful\" performance in the trenches earns him Uma's praise.\nLouise visits the mansion but, unable to understand the cult, simply ends up wandering its grounds. Shortly after, a concerned friend of Bertrand's visits but is promptly expelled by him for suggesting that he leave the cult.\nMeanwhile, a young man, Pierre, who was being groomed by Charles to \u201ccarry the sword\u201d as a lieutenant in the organisation, accidentally shoots himself in the head with a rifle. Uma, distraught, consults with an authoritative older man, Le Grand Hou, possibly a former leader of the group. After reminding her that she's a good \"warrior\", he enigmatically asks her if she'd ever hoped that the sky would rend before her eyes. Her answer is \"Yes, often\".\nBook VII \u2013 Attack\nIn his dream-state, Bertrand is now a lieutenant and carries a sword. Hunting through the forest for animals (which we hear but don't see), he tells us in a voice-over that his task now is to kill Colonel Kurtz, which is the same task given to Martin Sheen's character in Apocalypse Now.

She is also pursued by Yamada, a colonel in the Japanese military police, who is jealous of Kanemura's affections towards her. The owner of the nightclub and his chef, Hee-bong, secretly work for the Korean independence movement.\nAfter a twenty-year search, the Japanese Chief of State\u2014a high-ranking official in Korea\u2014has recovered the \"Light of the East\", a 3,000 carats (600 g) diamond and lost treasure from the ancient kingdom of Silla. Receiving orders to send the diamond to Japan, a lavish send-off party is arranged. Kanemura attends the event with Haruko; he plans to steal the diamond, but she has the same idea, and both are surprised to see the other when they get to the safe where it is kept. After a brief struggle, it is Haruko who makes her escape with the diamond, leaving Kanemura to face the authorities. But the nightclub owner and his chef are also at the party, and their bungled assassination attempt on the Chief of State results in a fire, allowing Kanemura to slip away in the confusion.\nYamada is given the task of retrieving the diamond, much to the chagrin of Suzimura, the chief of police, who feels that he has jurisdiction. Hasekawa, a police inspector, immediately suspects Haruko, but Yamada won't hear of it, blinded by his feelings for her. Meanwhile, Kanemura manages to track down Haruko, finding her on a train to Soviet Russia disguised as a geisha.

Kanemura is also unsuccessful in getting Haruko to give up the diamond, so he allows her to slip away and then secretly follows her.

An acetylene tank explosion from the adjacent construction site launches debris into the air, and rebar impales Brian's torso. A red candy is ejected from his mouth, and he collapses.\nThe next day Beth seeks aid at a police department and is introduced to detective Jack Andrews. He mentions that his sister Jean interned with Shelley Baum at Saint Luke's hospital and died two days prior. They discern an indeterminate interrelation between the events, and Andrews provides his contact card. Beth arrives home and finds her friend Taylor Anthony distraught by a premonitory feeling of being the next victim. As a consolation, Beth removes the batteries from their cellphones to render them unreachable. That night, Taylor's cellphone rings. She raises it and views a video of her apparent demise. The following morning Andrews and Beth set off to research geriatric nurse Marie Layton, originator of the calls. Via the morgue's database, they find Ellie Layton's autopsy report, her eldest daughter. The registered mortality cause is an acute asthmatic episode, mentioning \"no bruising but evidence of past scars\" with an attached CPS file for further consultation. The file indicates that Mrs. Layton got questioned by psychiatric nurse Jean Andrews at Saint Luke's infirmary. Moreover, Jean notes nine admissions between April\u2013May for Marie's children (Ellie and Laurel) concerning several causes, leading Beth to assume that the mother is affected by FDIA.\nMeanwhile, a TV producer that approached Taylor a day prior prepares to record her exorcism. The exorcist explains that spiritual energy operates in the same electromagnetic spectrum as light/microwaves. Hence it is transmissible via cellular phones from which manifests as hallucinations. Beth views the show's advertisement on TV and races to the site. She arrives in time to witness an unseen force choking Taylor to death. Beth's phone sounds with a voicemail dated for tomorrow. Assuming that finding Marie will settle the matter, she resolves to venture to Saint Luke's. At the desolate infirmary, she attempts to escape due to startling visions but runs into Andrews, and they decide to progress. They enter an operating room, and Marie's spirit propels Jack outside, knocking him unconscious. Beth remains locked inside, and a phone begins to chime, displaying her diminishing time. She launches it fiercely across the room, where it impacts the air duct's grill cover making it fall, allowing access to a crawlspace. Beth bends and crawls forward toward a potential exit. After a while, she turns to her left and notices Marie's charred corpse clutching a cellphone. Marie's corpse rises and proceeds to pursue her. When she intercepts her, she weeps and murmurs, \"Forgive me.\" Subsequently, she reunites with Andrews and states that Marie might have brought her there to protect her.\nAndrews heads to Laurel's foster home to declare her mother's death. There he finds a compact disc from the nanny cam embedded in the eye of Laurel's teddy bear. The footage reveals Ellie incising Laurel with a knife in their bedroom. Marie enters shortly thereafter and realizes that Ellie was the abuser all along. She rushes with Laurel to the hospital, locking Ellie within. Ellie began pressing wheezingly on the inhaler but was overtaken and fell on the floor facing the future curse's constituents: millipedes, an uncanny doll of a mother with baby in a perambulator (hallucinations theme), and the lullaby-Esque music emanating from the teddy, audible during every victim's call. She died from asphyxia while dialling her mother's phone number. The video concludes, followed by a thunder crash. The door creaks behind Andrews, and Laurel imparts that though Ellie injured her, she always provided candies. He apprehends that Ellie is the causal agent, and while driving homeward to apprise Beth, gets informed by a colleague of a new voicemail. Succeeding his ingress into Beth's house, somebody knocks on the door. As Andrews peers through the peephole, a knife stabs through it, killing him. Ellie appears and reaches out to murder Beth, but Marie's spirit intervenes and bounds Ellie in Andrews's phone. After banishing Ellie, she gazes briefly at Beth before evanescing.

In that job, Rosario meets Morsa, with whom she starts a carnal relationship.\nRosario lives with her mother, being witness to several instances of strange behaviour from her mother compatible with a condition of Alzheimer.

Thomas's wife, Lady Elizabeth disapproves, but Anne is agreeable after Norfolk promises that being the king's mistress will lead to marriage with a high-ranking nobleman.\nWhile visiting the Boleyn estate, King Henry is injured in a hunting accident indirectly caused by Anne's recklessness.

He idolises Seldom and has learned all about him. He takes accommodation in Oxford at the house of Mrs. Eagleton (Anna Massey), an old friend of Seldom. Also in the house is her daughter, Beth (Julie Cox), who is her full-time caregiver \u2013 which she resents bitterly \u2013 and a musician by occupation.\nIn a public lecture, Seldom quotes Wittgenstein's Tractatus to deny the possibility of absolute truth. Hoping to impress his idol, Martin disputes this, asserting his faith in the absolute truth of mathematics: \"I believe in the number pi\". Seldom humiliates him, ridiculing his arguments and making him look foolish in front of the audience. Disillusioned, Martin decides to abandon his studies and goes to his office to collect his belongings. There, he encounters his office-mate, a bitter mathematician Podorov (Burn Gorman), who also failed to become a student of Seldom's.\nMartin then returns to his residence, where he finds Seldom arriving to visit Mrs. Eagleton. The two men enter the house together and find Martin's landlady murdered. Seldom tells the police that he had received a note with his friend's address marked as \"the first of a series\". As Seldom is an authority on logical series, he argues that a serial killer is using murder as a way to challenge his intelligence. According to Seldom, \"The only perfect crime that exists is not the one that remains unsolved, but the one which is solved with the wrong culprit.\"Martin and Seldom discuss how easily the murder of the old lady might have been overlooked, particularly as she already suffered from terminal cancer. Martin suggests that the murderer is committing \"imperceptible murders\", meaning that the killer is choosing victims who are already dying therefore meaning that the police would be less likely to suspect foul play.\nMartin goes to the hospital where his girlfriend Lorna (Leonor Watling) works. There he meets a religious fanatic (Dominique Pinon), who has a daughter in dire need of a lung transplant. He also runs into Seldom, who is visiting Kalman (Alex Cox), a former student who went mad and suffers from a debilitating cancer, with bone involvement. Soon after, the patient who shares the room with Seldom's friend dies of an apparent lethal injection and the authorities receive a second symbol: two interlocking arcs.\nMartin and Lorna's relationship becomes strained as he becomes more obsessed with Seldom and the murders and discovers that Lorna had once been Seldom's lover. At a Guy Fawkes Night concert, Martin sees Podorov acting suspiciously and the police give chase, only to discover that Podorov had merely intended to hang an insulting banner from the school roof. While they are distracted a member of the orchestra collapses and dies from respiratory failure. A drawing of a triangle is found on his music stand. Afterwards, Seldom tells Martin a story about a nineteenth century man who had written a diary listing ways to kill his wife. When the wife discovered the diary she killed her husband but was acquitted by a jury on grounds of self-defence. Decades later, the diary was discovered to have been forged by the woman's lover. Seldom uses this story to explain that the perfect crime is not one which is never solved, but one which is solved incorrectly.\nAll of Oxford's mathematics community is excited as a local researcher claims to have solved Fermat's Last Theorem. The mathematicians, including Seldom and Martin, board a bus to travel to the conference, but Martin jumps out after seeing Lorna passing on the street. The two reconcile and agree to take a long holiday away from Oxford, mathematics, and Seldom. After making love with Lorna, Martin realises that the sequence the killer has sent them all consist of Pythagorean symbols and that the fourth one will be a tetractys, consisting of ten points.\nThe police, thinking that the killer is obsessed with Seldom, believe that he means to target the bus which Seldom and the other mathematicians are travelling in. However, the killer, as Martin realises, is actually the man he had met at the hospital. The man is a bus driver for a school for developmentally challenged children. Seeing the students as unfit to live and wanting to provide organ donors to save his own daughter's life, he blows up the bus, killing the children and himself. Afterwards, the police theorise that he had planned to escape the blast alive and had committed the other murders to present the deaths of the schoolchildren as the work of a serial murderer, thus shifting any blame from himself.\nAfterwards, Lorna and Martin prepare to leave Oxford. However, Martin realises that Seldom has been lying to him the entire time. As Lorna leaves in disgust, Martin travels to meet Seldom. He explains what he has worked out.\nBeth, wanting to be relieved of the responsibility of caring for her mother, had murdered the old woman as the police had initially suspected. In a panic, she had called Seldom, who came over to help cover up the crime. But Seldom arrived just as Martin did and so could not clean up the crime scene. Instead, he invented the story about receiving a note from the killer to direct suspicion away from Beth. The man at the hospital had died of natural causes with Seldom merely creating a false injection mark and leaving a symbol behind. The death of the musician at the concert was a fortuitous accident which Seldom took advantage of.\nSeldom argues that while he did indeed lie, his actions resulted in no deaths. However, Martin points out that the bus bomber took his inspiration from Seldom's string of murders. Seldom counters that all actions have consequences, some unintentional, and that one of Martin's casual remarks to Beth had led to her murdering her mother.", "tmdb_plot": "At Oxford University, a professor and a grad student work together to try and stop a potential series of murders seemingly linked by mathematical symbols.", "tmdb_id": "12245", "wiki_id": "7225213"}, {"title": "Oye Lucky!

Peirong approaches Pang Yong for help. In the meantime, Pang Yong meets Xia Bing, a young and inexperienced demon hunter, and befriends her. The murders were actually committed by Xiaoyi, a chameleon spirit who shows unrequited love towards Xiaowei and helps her obtain the human hearts she needs. Xiaoyi fought with Pang Yong and the soldiers on a few occasions and was nearly captured by Pang Yong but he always managed to escape.

Having shown improvement, he is released after serving just two years of a five-year sentence.\nUpon his release in 1952 he joins a boxing gym in St. Louis, Missouri, run by Caesar Novak at the recommendation of Father Alois. His fellow inmate Catfish later arrives to act as his cut man. During this time Liston takes part in several matches and meets his future wife Geraldine. He visits Father Alois, now working in a church, to thank him and tell him about Geraldine. Sitting in a parked car with Geraldine at night he is told by a policeman to move his car along, which escalates into a fistfight and another prison sentence for Liston. Geraldine greets him at his release in 1957 and invites him to live with her at a house being rented to her by her cousin after getting married at a justice of the peace on the way. Liston experiences nightmares remembering abuse suffered at the hands of his father.\nCaesar Novak takes Liston back in his gym as a fighter and asks him to stay out of prison. One night the policemen from the previous altercation stop by Liston's house and threaten him, telling him that he has to throw any future fight against Floyd Patterson.

The irritant works but Liston nevertheless gives up the fight. Geraldine surprises Sonny and Farah with a gun at their next rendezvous and tells Farah to leave then tells Sonny that she hopes Cassius Clay beats him again.

Her mother, Hillary, and father, Peter, misinterpret Phoebe and her younger sister, Olivia, as child prodigies; Phoebe's mother, an author, pretentiously remarks that her daughters' poetry is reminiscent of E. E. Cummings. Phoebe tries to fit in with the other kids at school, befriending an effeminate boy named Jamie who is frequently bullied, but teasing on the playground leads to an incident where Phoebe spits at another student's face.\nPhoebe's parents dismiss the spitting incident after they are called into the principal's office. They take Phoebe and Olivia to watch a live performance of the ballet Swan Lake, where Phoebe becomes entranced by the fashion and music. She also takes an interest in her school's eccentric drama teacher, Miss Dodger, whom the other teachers regard with disdain. Phoebe seeks a role in Miss Dodger's school play, Alice In Wonderland. Miss Dodger initially dismisses her for her lateness, but becomes more accepting after learning that Phoebe has compulsive hand-washing rituals. Phoebe flourishes on stage, but her impulsive speech and behaviour persist off-stage. Convinced that she will be \"fired\" if she does not get her patterns and lines exactly right, Phoebe spends hours at home jumping off the stairs until she bruises her ankles, while using her afternoons to step on every cobblestone in her household garden in the right order.

Her parents hire a therapist for her, but after he proposes medication, Hillary fires him. When the principal questions if Phoebe behaves oddly outside of the classroom, Hillary denies it even though she has many times witnessed her daughter's self-destructive rituals at home. Phoebe becomes an increasing embarrassment to Olivia, particularly after calling an obese woman a \"fat pig\" while trick-or-treating on Halloween.

Hillary meets Miss Dodger for the first time, and is stunned when the teacher claims that Phoebe exhibits no inappropriate behaviors or patterns during the play rehearsals.

Seeming to reconcile with Olivia at home, both daughters cheerfully run around the house and play together, failing to notice how stressed Peter is by Phoebe's latent mental problems.

She talks with Miss Dodger about her behaviour, and Miss Dodger suggests that as she grows older, she'll one day learn to admire herself for who she is rather than who the world wants her to be. After seeing her imaginary friend Alice again, Phoebe breaks her wrist jumping off the catwalk onto the stage, and Miss Dodger is fired when the principal suspects that she may have prompted Phoebe's act.

En route, they stop at a gas station/general store for directions and encounter a van of hippie women and their cult leader, the Hippie Stranger, (Bryonn Bain) who live in a commune in the woods, presumably raising emus for meat. From the store owner, they learn about a local legend called \"The Ripper,\" a legendary killer hog which supposedly weighs several thousand pounds. After obtaining some supplies and directions, they make their way to the cabin, passing through a hillbilly homestead belonging to the Tibbs clan, all of whom drop what they are doing to watch them pass by.

Z\u00fa\u00f1iga was given the sentence of 20 years in prison for a crime that was impossible for him to have committed. Three witnesses explained that he was at his place of work during the time of which he was accused of murder. However, the man was a close relative of the victim who had no firm evidence against Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, while the accused produced several witnesses able to place him far from the scene of the crime at the time of the murder.

Bond chases Mitchell and eventually kills him; in the confusion, White escapes. Searching Mitchell's flat in London, Bond and M discover Mitchell had a contact named Edmund Slate in Haiti. Bond learns Slate is a hitman sent to kill Camille Montes at the behest of her lover, environmentalist entrepreneur Dominic Greene. Observing her subsequent meeting with Greene, Bond learns Greene is helping exiled Bolivian General Medrano, who murdered Camille's family, to overthrow the government and become the new president in exchange for a seemingly barren piece of desert.\nAfter foiling Camille's assassination attempt on Medrano by \"rescuing\" her, Bond follows Greene to a performance of Tosca in Bregenz, Austria.

A shocked Taani faces a dilemma despite Raj assuring her that they can still remain friends if she does not reciprocate his feelings.

While dressing Surinder's injuries at home, she demands to know the reason behind his actions and begs him not to keep showering his care on her as she would not be able to repay him. Surinder understands that true love cannot be repaid and is disappointed as Taani cannot see it in his original form, but only in Raj. Later that night, Taani reunites with Raj in a garage and emotionally explains her dilemma to him. Seeing her distressed, he asks her to elope with him after the competition. A heartbroken Surinder then reveals to Bobby that he has decided to exit from Taani's life by sacrificing his cravings for her love, leaving her his property and applying for a transfer to Delhi so that she can find some suitable \"Raj\" for herself.\nThe next day, Surinder takes Taani to the Golden Temple to make her receive blessings from God for her performance and internally, also for her life without Raj. While there, Taani believes God has shown her a sign that her marriage with Surinder is divinely inspired. For the first time, she reflects on Surinder and has the realization of the strength and integrity in his character, something which she grows into love. That night, Taani confesses to Raj that she loves Surinder and tells him that she cannot choose him over her husband as it is equivalent in leaving God which is impossible.

His younger brother Rajiv Singh (Akshaye Khanna) is an alcoholic. Ronny is dating an upcoming model Sonia Martin (Bipasha Basu), while his personal assistant Sophia (Katrina Kaif) appears to be secretly in love with him. Ronny is also involved in a competition with his business rival Kabir Ahuja (Dalip Tahil), who is also a horse race fixer. \nThe film opens with a murder plot involving a car accident that Ronny narrowly survives. Ronny later kills his unfaithful jockey, who had been bribed by Kabir, and destroys Kabir when the latter offers to buy his company, which is in debt.\nRajiv drunkenly confesses to Ronny that he likes Sonia and would quit drinking for her. Ronny stops dating her and Rajiv and Sonia begin dating until, in a twist, Rajiv reveals that he knows of Sonia's shady past and plans to use her. His father had secured huge life insurance policies on each of the sons and he wants to kill Ronny and inherit $100 million in insurance payments. Sonia agrees to help in exchange for $20 million. \nThey pretend to get married; as per Rajiv's instructions, Sonia seduces Ronny, who confesses he loved her all along. Rajiv's plan is to threaten suicide, in response to Sonia and Ronny's affair by leaping off a tall building and get Sonia to push Ronny off. It turns out Ronny was aware of the plan as Sonia had been keeping him updated, having always been in league with him. They scheme to kill Rajiv.\nSonia double-crosses Ronny and pushes him off instead, saying she loved him, but the money was more important. As RD investigates the death, Sophia reveals that she was married to Ronny, leaving Sonia shocked since Sophia is now the heir to the insurance money. In another twist, Sophia was in on the plan too and is Rajiv's secret collaborator. Rajiv plans to bump off Sonia after he and Sophia get the money. RD figures out that Sophia had faked her marriage with Ronny and he had been tricked into signing the marriage certificate. RD confronts Rajiv and agrees to remain silent in exchange for $25 million. \nRajiv hires the same hitman who had attempted to murder Ronny in the beginning to kill Sonia, revealing that he had been behind the first murder attempt too. However, Ronny reappears and rescues her, killing the hitman.\nRonny confronts Rajiv and Sophia. He had overheard Rajiv discussing the failed murder attempt with the hitman and had been playing along the whole time so he could get the insurance money from his own faked death along with the insurance money from Rajiv's death. He allows Rajiv one last chance to win by agreeing to a car race. Ronny and Sonia show up in a yellow Toyota Supra and Rajiv and Sophia in a blue Nissan Skyline. When Rajiv protests, he switches cars with Ronny. Rajiv anticipated the switch and had destroyed the Nissan's brakes. In the middle of the race, Ronny tells Rajiv that he planted a bomb in his car and it will detonate if Rajiv slows below 100 kmph. \nAs the race continues, the two cars dodge obstacles (a boat hitched to a car, a group of cyclists, two trucks in a line, etc.). As they reach a parking lot, Rajiv attempts to cross a ramp, in order to overtake Ronny. This causes the Supra to crash into a caravan, topple over and knock into a petroleum tank, killing Rajiv and Sophia. After Ronny and Sonia narrowly escape death, Ronny confesses to Sonia that there was no bomb in the car and Rajiv killed himself. He also expresses his grief in realising to what extent did Rajiv go, even destroying the brakes, to deceive and kill the former.\nIn the end, Ronny collects the insurance money from Rajiv and Sophia's death, along with the money from his own 'death'. He attempts to flee the city with Sonia but RD stops them. The two are revealed to be childhood friends, and RD was working with Ronny all along, in exchange for more money.

One of the students, Jason, pulls a sword from a stone, unwittingly reviving a giant monster whose body is composed of rock. The monster goes on a killing spree, regenerating and blending in with mountain and stony hill features. Later at night, the one of his friends, Warren, having an injured ankle, goes missing alone in the woods and gets killed by the Rock Monster. Jason learns that an ancestor of his, Knight Jakivar Lazar, had slain a similar monster, as the evil Wizard Elas's spirit was imprisoned of the earth and stones from 800 years ago before their time, using the same sword.\nJason attempts to call the police for help in finding Warren at Cassandra's father's office, but the phone line is cut by criminal gypsies. On the way to another town to make a phone call, Jason and his friends see the gypsies laying dead on the road. The Rock Monster reforms and reveals itself before rising to attack them. They escape back to the village before the car explodes. Surrounded by an angry mob, Toni defends Jason by telling everyone that he is sorry for everything. During a meeting in the town city hall, the Colonel gives a speech to the villagers that inspires them to fight back against the monster together. The Colonel tells Jason that his sword is actually a powerful weapon capable of killing the monster when the latter doubts its powers.\nEventually, Jason decides to stay to help them destroy the monster. Toni reveals to him that she truly likes him, leaving for Jason to say goodbye to Benny, and that he will not leave Cassandra and Toni to fight the monster alone. Back on the main road, they learn that the monster grows stronger after feeding on the blood of its victims, and that Dimitar has been using black magic from Elas's spell books. Jason's friend, Benny, is killed by the monster while walking alone in an attempt to go home. The rock monster approaches the villagers in the woods as they begin to fire at it. It starts to go after Jason, but Toni distracts the monster using a bomb launcher so that Jason can kill it. Eventually, Jason defeats the rock monster by stabbing it in the ankle, and it shatters into pieces on the ground.\nAt night, back in the village, at the pub restaurant, the mayor and the villagers are celebrating Jason's triumph against the monster. Jason explains to everyone how he defeated the monster, then goes outside where he and Cassandra share a kiss. Drinking with the Colonel and the mayor, Jason confesses that he loves his daughter, leading for him to ask the mayor for her hand in marriage. Dimitar tries to kill Jason with the sword at his great-aunt Sophie's cottage while sleeping, but Toni and her farm boy lover, Johan have come to save him by knocking Dimitar unconscious.\nIn the jail cell bound with shackles on his hands and ankles, Dimitar tells Jason that he cannot kill the monster without a red jewel keystone. Jason punches him and leaves while Dimitar laughs with a red jewel keystone around in his neck. The next morning, in her father's office, Jason asks Cassandra to come back to America with him. Later, Jason looks at his ancestor with the sword and keystone on the ground in a portrait hanging on a wall before packing their belongings. Jason and Toni hear gunshots firing, and see Cassandra holding her dead father in her arms. The Colonel tells Jason that the monster came back to open the jail cell and free Dimitar. Jason realizes that Dimitar was telling the truth the whole time, warning that the monster will return to kill everyone until Jason dies, and he inherits the sword. As the rock monster returns to the village, Toni and the Colonel use a tank to fire at it. After another attempt, both Jason and the monster are buried beneath rocks in the mountain. Cassandra, Toni, and the Colonel decide to go back the village sadly after Jason's supposed death, and the male barkeeper becomes the new mayor. The Colonel mentions that they have run out of shells for the tank, there is no army, and they need to contact the other villages. Without any other choices, the new mayor makes a deal with Dimitar for peace. Cassandra refuses to accept this bad idea because Dimitar will enslave the village and offer the villagers to the monster either way. Meanwhile, Dimitar summons the monster to get Jason out of the rocks.\nLater at night, Jason, unconscious but still alive from the rocks, is brought to a secret lair in a mountain cave. Dimitar takes the sword and adds the red jewel keystone. He reveals that he has decided not to kill him yet and that the monster's soul will be freed from its stone prison and transferred into him to make him into a powerful sorcerer. Dimitar tells him that he is the last descendant of the Lazar family to witness for Elas's evil soul of his new ultimate abilities and immortality. Leaving Jason behind at his lair as he is getting away, he returns to the village with an injured leg. The new mayor, with two men, makes a deal with Dimitar to have peace. Dimitar debates on either sparing the village and the people, or killing them. Cassandra is kidnapped, knocked out, and carried away from her father's house by the new mayor, revealing him to be a traitor. He ties her up and leaves her alone in the woods. Jason angrily asks where Cassandra is and punches him, before discovering that Cassandra's has been carried away into Dimitar's lair. Toni tells Jason that if Dimitar wants an audience to see him at the sunrise tomorrow. Cassandra refuses Dimitar's proposal.\nThen, the monster follows Dimitar to the village with Cassandra, to begin the soul transference. In the midst of the process, Jason reacquires the sword and kills Dimitar with it. With the sword having little effect on the creature in combat, Jason, remembering the painting depicting his ancestor impaling the ground, does the same thing and opens the ground under the monster and later stabs it in the chest; defeating the creature and sending both it and Dimitar to Hell.\nJason departs the village along with Cassandra while Toni stays behind with Johan, who proposed to Toni earlier, which she accepted.", "tmdb_plot": "A college student, traveling with his friends to a remote eastern-European village, unwittingly releases the Rock Monster from it's ancient slumber to wreak havoc on the surrounding countryside", "tmdb_id": "59229", "wiki_id": "16527949"}, {"title": "Rock On!!", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Rock On!! begins in Mumbai, with the rock band Magik, in 1998.

Debbie is also rejected as the band's stylist without even being called for any demonstration. Later, when filming the music video, the band are forced to wear clothes they do not like, and the cameramen focus only on Aditya. Joe becomes furious at Aditya and the director, hitting them both before leaving with Debbie.

Outside, Hoffman delivers Corbett, the kidnapped daughter of Jeff, to the police and claims they are the only survivors. Strahm, having survived the trap by performing a tracheotomy with his pen, is brought out alive as well, much to Hoffman's shock.\nHoffman is promoted and credited with closing the Jigsaw case. Hoffman later finds a note in his office reading \"I know who you are,\" and learns of Agent Lindsey Perez's death while taking Strahm's cell phone from the police evidence room. At the hospital, Strahm tells Hoffman that Perez's last words were \"Detective Hoffman\" and questions how he escaped the plant. After being put on medical leave by his boss, Agent Dan Erickson, Strahm, suspicious of Hoffman, decides to uncover his involvement with Jigsaw and takes case files of past Jigsaw victims to research them.\nIn an underground sewer, Ashley, Brit, Charles, Luba and Mallick awaken with collars locked around their necks, connected by cables to a set of blades mounted on the wall behind them. The keys to the collars are in individual glass boxes across the room. A videotape informs them that they are all connected and that they must \"do the opposite\" of their instincts if they are all to survive the tests ahead of them. Ashley fails to retrieve the key and gets decapitated. In the second room, which is filled with explosives on a timer, Charles first attacks Mallick and then Luba, but she, Brit and Mallick each to retrieve keys to bomb shelters set in the walls. Charles is left to die when the timer expires and the explosives detonate. In the third room, Brit kills Luba and she and Mallick connect her corpse to five cables to complete an electric circuit that unlocks the next door. In the final room, Mallick and Brit find a machine fitted with five saws and a beaker requiring ten pints of blood to open the final door. They realize that all prior tests could have been completed without casualties if they had worked together, and figure out their connection: they were all involved in a building fire that killed eight people. Mallick and Brit concede a truce and each slice an arm in the saws to provide the blood needed to open the final door.\nStrahm learns that Hoffman killed Seth Baxter, who had killed Hoffman's sister, years prior. John Kramer abducted Hoffman after the fact and blackmailed him into helping him set up his future \"games.\" Strahm concludes that everyone was meant to die at the plant except for Corbett and Hoffman. John's ex-wife Jill Tuck claims Strahm is stalking her. After Hoffman tells Erickson about Strahm's theory of a second Jigsaw accomplice, Erickson tries to call him. Hoffman answers on Strahm's phone and hangs up. Erickson has one of his agents track the phone's signal.\nFollowing the signal to the sewer observation room, Erickson finds the phone and his own personnel file, both planted by Hoffman. He also finds the still-living Brit and Mallick and calls for medical attention, before putting an all-points bulletin on Strahm, convinced that he is Jigsaw's successor. Meanwhile, Strahm follows Hoffman to the renovated nerve gas house and finds a tape. In the tape, Hoffman urges Strahm to enter the box, but he stops it short and ambushes Hoffman, whom he seals in the box. Strahm believes he has finally caught Hoffman, but the door to the room suddenly shuts itself and the walls begin to close in as the box is lowered beneath the floor. Strahm finishes playing the tape, which warns him that if he does not enter the box, he will die and be framed as Jigsaw's apprentice.

He auditions for roles by day and works as a bartender at night.  He lives with his lifelong best friend, Sal.  As a child, Rey's father taught him that he should marry a Pakistani woman and follow a Muslim morality.  However, Rey only dates white women and is only vaguely Muslim.  He also leads his father to believe that he is an investment banker, though his mother knows the full truth about his career and his love life.\nRey proposes to his girlfriend, Noelle, and despite insisting that she wants to say yes, she tells him that she has to put off her answer until after a family vacation so that she can get her parents to agree to the marriage.  Ray is disappointed but optimistic.  When he comes home one evening, his father has come all the way from New Jersey and is sitting on his porch.  Ray learns that his mother threw his father out.  He insists that his parents try to reconcile, but his father says he will only agree to if Ray agrees to meet with the daughter of one of his Pakistani friends living in LA.  Irritated and promising nothing, Ray agrees.\nDuring the course of the dinner, which includes Ray, his father, Sana (the daughter) and Sana's parents, Ray and Sana go outside and soon discover that they have a lot in common, not the least of which is their half-white, half-Pakistani heritage.  At the close of evening, Ray's father concludes that Ray does like Sana, a fact that confuses and frustrates Ray; he reveals to his father that he has proposed to Noelle and is awaiting her answer.  Ray and Sana then meet by chance in a bookstore, and they connect further.  While Ray and his father are golfing, Noelle calls and tells Ray that she is tired of trying to please her parents and that she will marry him, to Ray's delight.\nMeanwhile, Ray's parents have some contentious phone conversations, sparked by Ray's pleas for a reconciliation.  Ray's mother surprises everyone by appearing on Ray's doorstep, and the parents work to make amends.  Tensions flare, however, when the mother finds out that the father put Ray up to seeing Sana.  As they argue, Ray gets a text message from Sana and they tacitly agree to meet up again.  Ray's mother finds him and tells him that she apologizes if she ever discouraged him from meeting girls that were more like him; they hug and he goes to work.  Noelle suddenly comes to visit Ray, but finds his parents home instead.  She casually mentions that Ray works at a bar, which infuriates Ray's father.  Meanwhile, at work, Sana comes to visit Ray; she is tipsy and very flirtatious and encourages him to take his break.  She pulls him into the men's bathroom and begins to caress him; he mildly protests, saying he needs to tell her something, but eventually concedes to a kiss.  He then suddenly shouts \"I'm engaged\" to a stunned Sana, before he apologizes profusely and exits the bathroom to find Noelle standing there.  Moments later, a breathless Sana exits.  Noelle storms out.  A little later, his father appears, furious about Ray's deceit.  Ray explains that he does not know how to do the things his father wants, namely, make a lot of money and marry a Pakistani woman.  Ray also accuses his father of hypocrisy, as he did not conform to Pakistani ideals either.\nAfter work, Ray finds a very angry Noelle at her home.  After he assures her that he didn't have sex with Sana, he hesitantly agrees to never see Sana again and the couple agrees to never discuss the incident again.

During the court-martial, the circumstances leading up to the fratricidal murder are gradually revealed.The film opens with a sequence where a group of Indian Army Soldiers cordons off a Village; as a part of Counter-Insurgency Operation; in the Punj Area of Pulwama Dist in Kashmir Valley. After numerous chase sequences, the shot ends with an army officer being shot by his colleague. The offending officer instead of escaping promptly surrenders and is then taken into custody by his colleagues.\nThe film then shifts to New Delhi, where we are introduced to best friends and Army Lawyers Major Siddhant Chaudhary and Major Akash Kapoor. While best friends, they both have contrasting personalities, with Akash being a dedicated Army Lawyer and Sidharth being an immature and care-free Army Officer. Siddhant (fondly called Sid), being the son of a highly decorated army officer, often feels compelled to live up to his father's legacy and therefore he reluctantly chooses to join the army. However, he himself has no plans for an army career and is therefore on the lookout for any chance to quit the army for an adventurous life.\nIn the present day, Akash is marrying his fianc\u00e9e Nandini, with Sid as his best man. Post-wedding, Akash informs Sid that their postings are now due; with Akash himself expecting to get posted in Srinagar. A rather excited Siddhant asks Akash to swing his posting too so that they both could be posted together. Akash, despite his misgivings, agrees to Sid's demands and thus makes an official request to the Army HQ, thus ensuring the same posting for Siddhant.\nA week prior to departure, Siddhant becomes aware of him being appointed as a defence lawyer and Akash being appointed the prosecuting lawyer, in a murder case involving two army officers, both belonging to the elite Rashtriya Rifles. On being aware about the nature of his new posting, Siddhant, who had the hopes of a tension-free tenure; throws a childish fit, but ends up getting shut up by an annoyed Akash.\nMeanwhile, a young aspiring Srinagar-based journalist Kavya Shastri, in the hopes of a big story; chances upon the murder case involving two Army Officers. On further research, Kavya gathers that their names were Capt. Javed Khan and Major Virendra Singh Rathore; who, when deployed for a CI operation; got into an argument, which ended with Javed fatally shooting Rathore. An army inquiry deems Javed guilty of insubordination and murder and is then to be subjected to a General Court Martial after a show trial.\nAn enthusiastic Kavya attempts to approach Javed, to get his side of story, but her efforts fail as the army authorities flatly refuse her request. Meanwhile, both Akash and Sid arrive in Srinagar, post which the duo get briefed by their CO, about the case. After the briefing, Siddhant heads out to meet Javed, for a better understanding of the case.\nJaved and Sid meet at the Barracks, where Sid makes a poor attempt at interrogation. Javed, unimpressed with Siddhant's immaturity, refuses to acknowledge him and continues maintaining a stoic silence. Javed's behavior angers and frustrates Siddhant, who ends up leaving in a huff.\nSid later confides his fears and doubts about the case to Akash; who is understanding of Sid's dilemma. Akash advises Sid to just plead guilty on Javed's behalf, while he promises to take care of all the prosecution work. To cheer up Sid, Akash points out the absurdity of the case, terming it open and shut. According to Akash, Javed is the guilty party and the case itself is unsubstantiated, thus making prosecution a cakewalk.\nMeanwhile, Kavya, on hearing about the trial, tries to reach out to Siddhant. Sid, on meeting Kavya, gets attracted to her and relentlessly tries to flirt with her. He even attempts to bluff his way through the case; despite not having any idea himself; just to impress her.\nHis efforts however miserably fail as the unimpressed Kavya calls out Sid and exposes his lies about the case. She further points out that as the defence lawyer it's Sid's responsibility to properly analyze the case and present the facts. Before leaving she further tries to make Sid realize the consequences of his decisions and their impact on his life. However while flirting, Sid accidentally mentions a senior army officer Brig Pratap; who happens to be Javed's and Rathore's commanding officer. Kavya gets intrigued and presses for more information but Siddhant hastily covers up, thus prompting a disappointed Kavya to leave.\nAfter the meeting, however, Kavya heads to her office where she writes and later publishes a slanderous article about Brigadier Pratap in a local daily; with naming Siddhant as the source of information. The article spreads like wildfire and ends up causing huge embarrassment to the Army, thus leading Siddhant to get hauled up by his superiors.\nA furious Siddhant later confronts Kavya and accuses her of betrayal and cheap sensationalism, at the cost of his reputation. Kavya instead hits back and accuses Siddhant of negligence and immaturity. She further tells him to focus on his job rather than worrying about a silly article.\nSiddhant's superiors reprimand him for his actions as Brigadier Pratap is later revealed to be a highly decorated officer with a spotless reputation. Siddhant wishes for a meeting with Brigadier Pratap so as to apologize to him in person. The authorities grant him the permission and Sid heads out to meet Pratap, who is deployed at a forward area near the LOC.\nSid, on meeting Pratap, gets intimidated. He profusely apologizes for his actions but Pratap simply brushes the incident away. Seeing Pratap's jovial mood, Sid tries to press Pratap for more information regarding the Rathore murder case; but a dismissive Pratap coldly rebuffs him. Sid then tries to get access to the scene of the crime and to his relief Pratap accepts his request. Siddhant analyzes the scene of the crime and suspects something amiss. He tries to reach out to the local populace but he encounters their distrust towards army personnel. Vowing to get to the bottom of the case, Sid heads back to Srinagar. He then meets up with Javed, informing him of his meeting with Brigadier Pratap. Javed, for the first time, speaks; and asks Sid whether he thinks Javed is innocent or guilty. A baffled Sid tells Javed that he will inform his decision to the court along with presenting all the necessary facts.\nLater in the evening Siddhant and Kavya run into each other. Despite a rocky start Sid becomes warm towards Kavya, who herself starts appreciating Sid's honesty and commitment. Kavya informs Sid about a major cover-up regarding the Rathore murder case, involving Brigadier Pratap and cautions him to be careful. Sid privately agrees and tells her about his meeting with Pratap, with Kavya promising to help Siddhant in every way possible. She later hands him several documents crucial for the case. A grateful Sid thanks her and heads back to further analyze the case. After spending the whole night studying the case, Sid concludes that Javed may actually be innocent and instead be a victim of a  cover-up.\nA now-matured Siddhant decides to take the case head-on. On the day of the prosecution, Siddhant blatantly goes against Akash's advice and to the surprise of many (including Javed himself), declares Javed as not guilty. His actions earn Akash's ire who calls him irresponsible. Sid however maintains his decision and vows to prove Javed's innocence. This causes a frosty relationship between the two best friends; which lasts for some time.\nMeanwhile, Javed, after witnessing Siddhant's genuine efforts, decides to completely open up. He not only answers all of Siddhant's questions but also provides him with documents that prove Javed's innocence; thus helping him prepare a strong defence. Kavya, meanwhile, pays a visit to Javed's ancestral village, where she meets Javed's mother. Kavya gathers the necessary information and heads back to Srinagar. She then meets up with Siddhant and the duo chalk out a plan to prove Javed's innocence.\nOn the day of the trial, Sid presents a credible defense that effectively counters Akash's narrative. While questioning the witnesses who were present at the time of the incident, Sid finds one witness, Capt R.P. Singh, to be suspiciously evasive. However, before he could probe any further, the session ends in a stalemate. Sid later meets up with Kavya and informs her about the day's trial.\nKavya then suggests paying Maj. Rathore's family a visit. The next day both Sid and Kavya visit Rathore's home and meet his widow Neerja and her son Kshitij. Kavya attempts to press Neerja for valuable information, while Sid snoops around the house for clues, but both end up empty-handed. Sid remarks that it was indeed odd that both Neerja and Kshitij failed to turn up for Maj. Rathore's funeral; but Kavya reveals that their marriage was an abusive one and Rathore's death seems to have sort of liberated her from some sort of bondage. While heading back, Sid comes to startling conclusion that not only proves Javed's innocence all along but also proves Maj Rathore's guilt.\nKavya comes across evidence of the Indian Army's human rights violations. She, on further analysis, concludes that both Brigadier Pratap and Maj. Rathore; who were known to be very close; also have numerous complaints of human rights abuses against them. Kavya sends the necessary proofs to Siddhant but is arrested for trespassing on army area and trying to access sensitive information without due authorization. Sid tries to bail out Kavya but fails. Kavya conveys her suspicions to Sid and tells him to focus completely on the case.\nOne night Javed's mother pays Siddhant a visit. She pleads Sid to fairly judge her son; whereupon Siddhant promises a fair trial for Javed. Meanwhile, Neerja post several documents to Siddhant, after getting his address in his own sent gift to Neerja's son, that were important for the case. Sid on further probing finds a strong connection of the murder case with Brigadier Pratap. He then meets Pratap at his official residence. Pratap reveals that he was friends with Brigadier Shashank Chaudhary, Siddhant's father, for a long time. He further tells Siddhant not to spoil Brigadier Chaudhary's legacy. It's there when Sid becomes aware of his father's valor.\nHowever, Siddhant's troubles increase when an important witness, Capt. R.P. Singh mysteriously vanishes without a trace. Sid concludes that R.P. Singh is a prime witness as he was the one to arrest Javed, thus it was important that R.P. Singh be found. A few days later, Sid gets carjacked by a masked individual, who later reveals himself to be R.P. Singh. He informs Sid that it was actually Maj. Rathore who was the guilty one while Javed was actually innocent. On further coaxing, R.P. Singh reveals the actual sequence of events of that night of the operation.\nAccording to R.P. Singh, during the operation, Maj. Rathore brutalized several villagers and charged them of supporting Pakistan and being terrorist sympathizers. He further tortured a young boy in falsely accepting the charge of hoarding weapons. The sadistic Rathore, still not satisfied, shot the boy in cold blood, terrifying the villagers and horrifying the soldiers. Javed, on witnessing the killing, tries to appease an enraged Rathore, who instead accuses Javed of treason and tries to brutalize a young girl. A fed-up Javed promptly shoots down Rathore; thus saving the girl and the villagers. Here, R.P. Singh points out that despite a golden chance of escaping undetected and fully evading capture, Javed instead chose to surrender and accept his punishment.\nSid, satisfied with R.P. Singh's explanation, asks him to give his confession in the court, but to his great dismay, R.P. Singh refuses and instead runs into hiding, where he then kills himself. Thus with no credible witnesses available, Sid decides to take Brigadier Pratap to court. His decision shocks Akash and Kavya, both of whom caution Sid about the consequences of his actions.\nSid stands by his decision and on the day of the trial, Pratap makes an entry and heads towards the witness box. The trial begins poorly with Sid fumbling and Pratap getting the upper hand. A frustrated Siddhant decides to beat Pratap at his own game.\nIn the guise of a memory quiz, Sid reveals to everybody attending the trial that Brigadier Pratap's eight-year-old daughter and his wife were raped and murdered and his elderly mother burnt alive by their Muslim servant during a communal riot and coaxes Pratap into revealing his involvement in the Rathore murder case. Siddhant calls Pratap a coward and provokes him into launching into a fiery tirade that inadvertently exposes his anger towards Muslims and hatred for democracy.\nPratap justifies his actions in the name of nationalism and patriotism, but Sid calls out his bluff thus exposing Pratap's lie. In the end the Army Court declares Javed innocent, clearing him of all charges and restoring his rank and honours.  They simultaneously order an inquiry against Brigadier Pratap.\nIn the final conclusion, a grateful Javed finally acknowledges Siddhant as an officer.

The homestead also has dried up because of a dam built nearby and owned by the private corporation Del Rio Water.

Upon arrival, the Buddies meet Shasta, a Siberian Husky puppy whose 11-year-old owner, Adam Bilson, is determined to win the Alaskan sled dog race because of what had happened to his father, due to a tragic accident a year prior. The puppies decide to help Shasta pursue his dreams as well as get to the airport, located at the finish line. Unfortunately, as Shasta's parents are both dead, this puts the puppies in a predicament as there is nobody to teach them how to become snow dogs. Fortunately, Shasta manages to persuade a legendary Alaskan Malamute named Talon, who had taught Shasta's deceased father, into teaching the puppies.\nWhen Shasta introduces Adam to his new sleigh team, the child is delighted at the prospect of his dreams finally coming true and the team pursue vigorous training routines. Adam begins building a new sleigh with his team of hard-working puppies. Talon proudly watches as the team's efforts come to fruition and it seems as though they are cooperating as a team. The older town huskies, however, are not impressed and begin to plan their downfall. Two of the huskies Francois and Philippe, reveal to the Buddies that Shasta's parents were killed during a dog sled race  (sitka) last year when the ice beneath them shattered to dishearten them.\nTalon calls the puppies to the mountain lake one night to view the Northern Lights (juno) before he goes of telling Shasta that he knows all he needs to know and that he can become the great leader that his father once was; once all the puppies say their goodbyes to him,  Talon disappears into the lights. The following morning, the puppies enter the race with Adam. But everyone else laughs at the thought of a little boy and puppies entering a race. The sheriff goes over the rules and sees Adam wrote his own name in the entry list. After being reminded how treacherous the race is by the sheriff, the puppies begin their track while Jean George III, an unscrupulous and arrogant French musher-(who is hated by nearly everyone in town) and last year's champion, cheats his way through every race by sabotaging the other mushers' sleds or pushing them off their sleds. Soon only young Adam and Jean George are left but news of a terrible blizzard arrives and it's too late to call off the race as the racers have already gotten past the midway checkpoint.\nMeanwhile, the puppies' parents, Buddy and Molly follow the puppies to Alaska, after being tipped by Himalayan cat Miss Mittens, where the Saint Bernard dog Bernie informs them of their participation in the race. Sheriff Ryan gets a message sent by Fernfield's Deputy Dan asking for any information on the Buddies. The Sheriff immediately phones Deputy Dan to inform him that the Buddies are in Alaska, who then goes to inform their owners at their treehouse about the good news, much to their delight. A dangerous blizzard forces Adam and the team to take shelter in an igloo provided by an Inuit until the storm subsides. They come head to head with Jean George, and Adam gets injured.\nAdam then recovers while Francois and Philippe, the lead dogs of Jean George's team, get into trouble when the ice beneath them shatters. Jean George continues and abandons his dogs while Adam and the puppies begin a rescue operation despite Shasta's fears of his parents death, revealing that they had died from drowning. The puppies pull Francois and Philippe out of the icy waters and Jean George continues the race without any gratitude and abandons their rescuers. Francois and Philippe realize they owe nothing to their owner for leaving them to die, and everything to Shasta and the Buddies for rescuing them, and so, decide to \"go on strike\". They stop and refuse to run any further, causing Jean George to lose the race.\nAdam is victorious and the Buddies reunite with Buddy and Molly. Jean George scolds his dogs for embarrassing him, and they respond by chasing him around the Arctic. The Buddies sadly say goodbye to their new best friend, Shasta, as well as Adam, and both groups promise that they will stay in touch with each other. All seven Buddies return home via airplane and are greeted by their owners Sam, Bartleby, Billy, Alice, Pete, Henry and Noah; who were waiting for them. Budderball and his owner, Bartleby, are watching the news the next day and Bartleby is completely dumbstruck when he watches the part about the Buddies, Adam, and Shasta winning the race. That night, Buddy and Molly sit on the roof of their house and discuss their puppies' accomplishments, while wondering if they will ever outgrow exploring. The film ends with Adam and a now nearly full-grown Shasta hiking through Alaska on a cold, winter night with five new adult huskies, while Talon narrates a reminder for the audience that \"life may lead you where you least expect, but have faith, and you'll know exactly where you were meant to be\".", "tmdb_plot": "Dylan Sprouse, Jim Belushi and Kris Kristofferson lend their voices to this family-friendly tale about a feisty pack of golden retriever puppies that embarks on an Alaskan adventure.

When Jared explains his discovery of the Book and the existence of magical creatures, his family doesn't believe him.\nThe next morning, Jared meets a brownie named Thimbletack, who is initially angry with Jared for having opened the book that Thimbletack was supposed to be protecting from Mulgarath. Jared placates him with crackers and honey, and Thimbletack gives Jared a holed stone that allows Jared to see the normally invisible faeries by looking through it. Thimbletack tells him about the protective mushroom circle surrounding the house.\nJared then witnesses Simon's abduction by goblins, led by Redcap. Simon is taken to the goblins' campsite where he is confronted by Mulgarath who is disguised as an old man. Jared sneaks into the campsite to save him where he meets Hogsqueal, a hobgoblin, who gives Jared the ability to see faeries without the stone by spitting in his eyes so that he can help him get revenge on Mulgarath for killing his family. Mulgarath releases Simon so he can fetch the Book for him. Jared finds Simon and both fight over the Book before they are chased by the goblins. The twins flee back to the house, and Mallory, upon almost being ambushed by the goblins, which cause her to realize Jared was right, fights them off with her fencing sabre.\nAfter failing to try and burn the Book due to a protective spell over it, the children decide to visit Arthur's daughter, their great-aunt Lucinda Spiderwick, for advice. While Simon distracts the goblins, Mallory and Jared, taking the Book with, escape through an underground tunnel. Chased by a troll sent by Redcap, they narrowly escape when it is struck and killed by an oncoming truck. Jared and Mallory meet the elderly Lucinda in the psychiatric hospital where she lives, surrounded by sprites. She tells the children that they need to find her father and have him destroy the Book and that, for eighty years, Arthur has been held captive by the sylphs. At that moment, Redcap and his goblins attack them through the window and manage to tear off several pages from the Book before being driven off. Among the stolen pages, Mulgarath is pleased to find information on how to break the protective circle.\nWhile Helen is driving Jared and Mallory home, she and Jared argue over her disbelief; Jared angrily tells Helen that he hates her and doesn't want to live with her anymore. Later, Hogsqueal, having overheard Mulgarath's plan, informs the children while also giving Simon and Mallory the ability to see faeries as well. Jared then tries to call his father again, but a sympathetic Mallory tells him that their father has moved in with another woman after his and Helen's divorce and won't be coming for him, causing a heartbroken Jared to regret his angry words to Helen earlier. Jared, Simon, and Mallory then use the Book to summon a griffin, which takes them to the sylphs' realm. There, they meet Arthur, who has not aged and is unaware of the time he has spent there. Jared asks him to destroy the Book only to find out that Thimbletack had switched the pages with a cookbook and kept the real Book. Arthur is relieved until Jared tells him that Mulgarath knows how to break the protective circle. Arthur informs Jared that the sylphs won't allow them to leave as they, like him, know too much about the faeries. Arthur helps them escape by distracting the sylphs with the fake book.\nAt home, the children finally convince Helen of the truth when they save her from the goblins' attempted ambush and then her seeing Thimbletack upon her return home. Meanwhile, the goblins finish spreading their potion, which successfully breaks the circle as the full moon rises. The family defend themselves with kitchen knives and tomato sauce/salt bombs (ingredients deadly to goblins) that Simon and Thimbletack made earlier and manage to kill Redcap and the goblins in an explosion of tomato sauce. Suddenly, Richard appears, claiming that he has decided to come back and stay with them; however, Jared, having remembered what Mallory told him earlier, stabs him, revealing him to be Mulgarath in disguise. Mulgarath then pursues Jared and the Book throughout the house before cornering him on the roof. Jared outwits the wicked ogre by tossing the book over the side of the roof. Mulgarath transforms into a crow to catch it, but he is suddenly grabbed and eaten by Hogsqueal. Afterwards, Jared and his mother reconcile, with Jared deciding to live with her and they help Simon, Mallory, and Hogsqueal gather the Book's scattered pages.\nSeveral weeks later, the family brings Lucinda to visit Thimbletack and the house. The sylphs then arrive with Arthur, allowing him to briefly visit now that the Book is safe. However, Arthur cannot stay long as he will turn to dust if he remains. Lucinda asks to go with him and is transformed back into a child.

One day, after returning home from work, Carla sees Smithy wiping blood off his hands and stashing a duffel bag full of cash into their ceiling; presumably the loot from an armed robbery conducted by Smithy's gang. Carla tells Ray, insisting this to be the end of their financial troubles, and although he is initially hesitant she finally persuades him to steal the money.\nRay devises a plan.

Shocked at the death of their Prior, the Ori soldiers surrender with Tomin returning to Earth with SG-1 where he resides at the SGC for a time.\nBack on Earth, General Landry and Mitchell meet James Marrick, an IOA representative sent to interrogate Tomin, because the original IOA representative, Richard Woolsey, is now working for the Atlantis Expedition. When Daniel Jackson realizes that the Ark is still in the Ori galaxy, Marrick is assigned to accompany them on board the Odyssey through the Supergate. In the Ori galaxy, a member of the anti-Ori resistance tells the team that according to legend, the Ark is on Celestis, the Ori capital. When SG-1 beams down to the planet, Marrick activates the Asgard computer core which alerts the Ori to the ship's location.\nUpon being alerted by Major Kevin Marks of what is going on, Mitchell and Carter beam back to the Odyssey and discover that Marrick has used the core to build a Replicator, intending to plant it on an Ori ship and let it spread to their entire fleet. When Mitchell attempts to destroy it with an anti-Replicator Gun, the replicator escapes, and Marrick reveals that the IOA removed that weakness from the design, although conventional weapons are sufficient to destroy individual replicators. Marrick implies that a shutdown code has been included as a failsafe, but claims he does not know what it is. He is placed in the ship's brig and falls victim to the Replicators, when they make their way into the brig, resulting in Marrick becoming a Human/Replicator hybrid.

When General Landry refuses to even listen to him, the Apollo detects a fleet of Ori motherships waiting on the edge of the Solar System. On the Odyssey, Marrick is attacked by Replicators who infest his body.  In the ensuing battle, Mitchell is able to briefly disable the Replicator connection to Marrick's brain, who then informs Mitchell the shut down code for the Replicators is on the other side of the crystal used to create them.  Mitchell activates an explosive charge which kills Marrick.  Mitchell informs Carter, who activates the shut-down command, deactivating the Replicators.\nWhen the Ark is activated and opened, the Doci is caught by the beam and made to see that the Ori are not gods and spreads this belief to all of the Priors in the Ori galaxy and through them their followers.

He longs for his stay here to be over quickly so that he can reunite with his daughter, Josefine, who has been told he is in Australia.\nIn Skarrild, Robert meets some of the unusual locals, Dr. Zerleng and his two cronies, the grocer and the priest, who are looking for him to become the fourth player in their regular card game. He also meets Ingelise Buhl, a victim of marital abuse, who sets about insinuating herself into Robert's daily life. Robert also visits the local bicycle shop, but no one is there, and he is told the owner suddenly disappeared some time ago.  Following a few minor incidents, it becomes clear to him that the residents prefer to mete out justice in their own way, rather than involve the authorities in Tonder.\nIn an effort to be protective of Ingelise, Robert develops feelings for her, and after an instance of abuse by her husband, J\u00f8rgen, he goes to her home to check on her.  He enters through an open door, to find J\u00f8rgen passed out on the stairs leading up to their bedroom.  He finds Ingelise lying in bed, somewhat battered, and she begins to seduce him. He succumbs, and when Ingelise's moans threaten to rouse J\u00f8rgen, Robert muffles her with a pillow, accidentally suffocating her.

When the doctor arrives to examine the body, Robert makes a vague attempt at telling the truth, but is coerced by the doctor, who declares the death is due to cardiac arrest. He doesn't want the Tonder authorities in on this, even though he believes that J\u00f8rgen actually killed his wife, and says he doesn't want their daughter, Dorthe left an orphan.

At the funeral luncheon, he is advised by the priest to keep an eye on J\u00f8rgen because the townsfolk don't like wife-killers, and they all believe that J\u00f8rgen is guilty.  That night, Robert parks outside J\u00f8rgen's house and in the morning, sees several men in two cars taking him away, and follows them to the outskirts of town, where they are forcing J\u00f8rgen at gunpoint to enter the bog.  For the first time, Robert pulls out his pistol, aims it at the men and tells them to desist.  He is then able to get J\u00f8rgen out of the bog and takes him home. He finds Dorthe hiding at the grocer's, where she tells him that she saw him leaving her house the night Ingelise died.  He is able to convince her it is a misunderstanding, and takes her back to her father.\nLater, J\u00f8rgen goes to the bar and challenges Robert to a drinking duel. After six beers and five shots each, the two end up at Robert's apartment, where J\u00f8rgen pulls out Robert's missing uniform button.

The story is not structured chronologically. It opens with a sequence that rapidly crosscuts between shots of a chanting priest who is shrouded in sheer muslin fabrics and a badly injured man being wheeled down hospital corridors on a stretcher. There is also an image of a child that appears multiple times during this opening sequence; it becomes clear later on in the film that this child is a visual hallucination. The priest is ordering someone to wake up and get up. Then there is a shot of a village with a vast landscape is shown. There is a priest playing a traditional harp at the edge of a cliff while watching the sunrise. An elder woman (later revealed to be Anberber\u2019s mother) is sitting by wood fire in a tiny mud hut wondering if the direction of the smoke indicates an imminent arrival. \nIt is 1990 and Anberber has returned to his poor village located far away from the metropolis of the country. He is greeted warmly by his mother and his brother. But he looks dazed and disoriented. A group of dejected young men in handcuffs look on as the family reunites. A very crowded and vibrant party is thrown to welcome Anberber. He is bombarded by questions from well-meaning party guests, but he simply stares back at them in confused shock. Soon the festivities are interrupted when a young man is violently drafted to fight on behalf of the national government. Other young men can be seen discretely sneaking out of the party before they are also spotted.\nAt sunrise, there is a mesmerizing view of lake Tana and a canoe floating near the horizon. Anberber wakes up screaming. Seemingly the whole village gathers outside his hut to stare at him. Anberber has on prosthetic leg but admits that he has no memory of losing his leg. After following his mother - who is visiting a church to give thanks for his return - Anberber walks into the church with shoes on (something that forbidden in the Ethiopian Orthodox tradition). Everyone is scandalized and shouting at him to take off his shoes. However, he is too unsettled by his hallucination of the child to even processes what they are saying to him. By now, people of the village are convinced that Anberber is possessed by evil spirits \u2013 probably as a result of having gone abroad, to a foreign country. Anberber follows his \u201cvision\u201d of the child to a statue erected by Mussolini\u2019s regime, during the Italian invasion. Anberber remembers his father who lost his life fighting the Italians. There is another sunrise and another beautiful view of lake Tana. Fog rises out of the ground as children run to school. The village teacher comes to school riding a bike. Class commences with the children being thought the national anthem.\nA young man working on a farm is ambushed by soldiers and drafted. His mother is distraught. Anberber tries to console her. Anberber is unsettled by how things have changed in his village. He bitterly questions the point of educating the young children when all they have to look forward to is war and death. But the teacher counters Anberber\u2019s disillusionment by stating the power of education, especially in repressive times like this. \nAnberber wakes up screaming once again after getting a series of flashbacks. He goes to the shore of lake Tana to stare at the horizon. He remarks how that horizon used to be the edge of his world as a child. But now, he has no recollection of where he had been in the intervening years. The people of the village bring him patients to treat because they heard he was a doctor. Yet he remains as quiet and as confused as the beginning of the film. \nAnberber talks to his hallucination out loud in the presence of his mother. She becomes even more alarmed and worried about him. The family decides he needs to be taken to a holy water bath as part of an exorcism ritual. Anberber does not fight them but he tells the priest that the ritual will not work because his mind has been locked. The priest comments that even Western medicine will not be effective if the patient does not believe in its efficacy. As soon as the holy water is splashed on him, his first memory of his past life comes back to him.\nIt is 1970 and young Anberber is living in Germany as a graduate student. At a party, he meets Cassandra \u2013 a Black woman, who accuses Ethiopians of not wanting to date dark-skinned women. He disagrees and tells her he is interested in her. He goes on to declare himself a socialist, whose research work is motivated by his desire to alleviate the suffering of poor people in his country. Back in the present day, the liberation fighters warring with the government have come into the village with rifles. They are asking the people to tell them about their poor living conditions under the current government. The village people are terrified to say anything at all. As the flashback to early 1970s continues, Anberber participates in a political meeting of socialist Ethiopian students, who are all studying in Germany. In the present day, he simply stares at the liberation fighters in a daze when they ask him political questions. Later on, he compares the liberation fighters with communist government that was in power at the time; they both claim to be for the people but the people\u2019s lives have barely changed.\nThe village teacher takes Anberber to the cave where all the young men of the village are hiding in order to avoid conscription. On another day, soldiers are tipped off about a young man visiting from the cave. They chase and kill him in front of the villagers. Anberber tries to stop them but he does not succeed. To Anberber, the murdered young man now blends with his hallucination of the child. He tells his mother that the soldiers killed his childhood and his memories when they killed the young man. \nAnberber is taken to another exorcism session, where another set of his memories come back to him. Cassandra is now Anberber\u2019s girlfriend. His best friend \u2013 Tesfaye \u2013 and his White German girlfriend announce they are pregnant. Cassandra gets upset. It is later revealed that her own father was a Cameroonian man who had a child with a White German woman. Her father was eventually deported by the German government. Her mother struggled to cope with the racism and committed suicide. Cassandra had to grow up, not only with the sense of abandonment, but the racism without the support of either parent. She fears Tesfaye will not stick out to raise his child as well. In the present day, Anberber watches Azanu washing up in Lake Tana. She is a scorned woman who had been taken in by his mother. The film crosscuts between the two women multiple times. Anberber\u2019s brother tries to rape Azanu. She calls out for help. When people arrive, they all blame her rather than the brother \u2013 that is, everyone except for Anberber, who is furious on her behalf. \nBack in the 1970s, at another student meeting, a more radical member in the group criticizes another female member for buying into imperialist ways of being because of the way the woman was dressed. Present day Anberber reflects on his youthful infatuation with the anti-imperialist socialist movement as the magic solution to Ethiopia\u2019s problems. In present day, the men of the village have arranged for Anberber to consider a young teenage girl for marriage because they are worried he is falling for Azanu, the scorned woman. Anberber is disgusted by their suggestion.\nIt is 1974 and the Ethiopian students have gathered in a bar to celebrate the deposition of Emperor Haile Selassie. The leftist White Germans who are gathered with them also cheer as one of the most prominent Black Monarchs in history is brought down. The Ethiopian students start discussing the idea of going back to their country to work for the people. Cassandra is pregnant but she hasn\u2019t told Anberber, fearing he might not stick around to raise his kid. As the others celebrate the fall of the monarchy, Anberber is more somber, wondering who would be able to fill the power vacuum that has been created and if the next government would be any better. \nTesfaye has finally decided to leave his kid behind in Germany to work under the new communist government. Anberber criticizes Tesfaye for abandoning his child, citing Cassandra\u2019s experience. Tesfaye then retorts by revealing Cassandra\u2019s secret abortion to Anberber. Cassandra eventually disappears because she is convinced Anberber will also not stay in Germany for too long. Back in the present, Azanu is singing about finding love again while she canoes across lake Tana. Anberber and Azanu consummate their love. \nAnberber walks into his bedroom to find his brother going through his suitcases, which is full of books. His brother is disappointed in Anberber for not lifting the family out of poverty, despite all his education. He says they cannot eat books.\nIt is now the 1980s Anberber has also finally returned to Addis Ababa as a PhD holder. He encounters soldiers stationed throughout the airport as soon as he arrives to Ethiopia. Anberber wants to return to his village to visit his mother but he is told the conditions in the country are too unstable for travel and that he is urgently needed to work as a pathologist. Despite all this, Tesfaye and Anberber feel optimistic about all they will be able to do for the poor people of Ethiopia. But as time goes on, the two increasingly clash with the government cadres, who accuse them of being elitist intellectuals who are do not support the revolution. \nAnberber witnesses a military raid for the first time and is horrified by level of brutality that has become commonplace under the current regime. He and his companions comment on how they now live in luxury houses that the government has confiscated from people as a way to reduce wealth inequality. That is, they recognize the paradox of being radical leftists who also benefit from luxuries that the new system has afforded them. \nThen one of Anberber\u2019s close friends, who returned to Ethiopia around the same time as him is murdered right in front of Anberber because some opposing political group suspected him of working with the government. By this point Anberber is trying to distance himself from politics. However, that makes the cadres even more furious because they think he believes he is better than them. One day, the cadres want him to sign saying that a murder they committed was an accident. He tells them he is a PhD holder not a medical doctor. The blood dripping from the murdered man then morphs into the leaky faucet in Anberber\u2019s bathroom, which haunts him all night long. On another day, Anberber becomes furious at the cadres for missing work in order to attend a revolutionary meeting. He gets accused of being an imperialist and anti-revolution. He struggles to accept this accusation and refuses to engage in the communist practice of self-criticism. He is eventually forced to self-criticize.\nTesfaye reveals he is planning to not return to Ethiopia after leaves for an upcoming work trip to Germany. He is frustrated by his inability to bring about any real change under the current political conditions. He finally wants to settle down and help raise the son he abandoned years earlier. But before he could return, the cadres \u2013 who had increasingly started to resent him \u2013 beat him to death. They also come for Anberber, but he narrowly escapes. Anberber is then asked to go to Germany on Tesfaye\u2019s behalf. While there, he struggles to fit back in with the Ethiopian diaspora living there. They think he is working as a spy for the Ethiopian government, so they do not trust him. Besides, they resent him because they think their lives as immigrants living in Europe is much harder than his. When he finally meets with Tesfaye\u2019s son and wife. The son is really struggling with the racism around him, now that he is a teenager. He is angry at his mother because she does not understand his experience of racism. He longs for his father so much that Anberber cannot bring himself to tell them about Tesfaye\u2019s death. Eventually Anberber musters the courage to share the sad news, but before he could meet them again, he is beaten up by a racist German mob, who eventually throw him out of the window. He is injured very seriously and loses his leg.\nBack in present day, after witnessing one of the conscripts coming back from the front badly injured, he realizes that he may never fully remember or understand what happened to him when he was away. But, he could not just sit idly waiting for more clarity; it is more pressing to be of service to the community to the best of his ability. He helps dress the wound of the returned soldier. Then, the villagers bring him teacher\u2019s bike. They report that the teacher has disappeared, and they choose him to be the new schoolteacher for the village.\nAzanu is pregnant. This time, Anberber knows about it (unlike when Cassandra was pregnant) and is excited. But when he tries to focus on her pregnant belly, the voices in his head get louder. Eventually the \u201cvision\u201d \u2013 which he was previously getting glimpses of through his dreams \u2013 becomes clear. There is a traditional grain bin. It has many holes that are rapidly leaking grain. Anberber is panicking and trying to fill all the holes with crumpled up paper that he tears off of his books. But it is all futile because the sea of grain eventually swallows him. The priest interprets this vision/dream for Anberber. The grain bin represents country. The grain represents the people who are dying like flies. The constant leakage is the county\u2019s chronic problems that are seemingly unsolvable. The priest believes that Anberber is finding his education useless in bringing about the kind of changes he wanted to see in his country. \nA radio interview with the liberation fighters is being broadcast by a foreign radio channel.  The fighters are convinced that their version of socialism is the purest compared to the current government\u2019s.\nAs Azanu prepares to give birth, Anberber settles into his new role as the village teacher. He finally seems lucid enough for job and finds joy in teaching the children how to ride the bike. By the end of the film, Azanu gives birth to baby at the turn of the year, just as the New Year song is being sang and the indigenous yellow flowers of New Year blooms.

With the exception of newcomer supporting actor Kevin Sandusky, the cast\u2014fading action hero Tugg Speedman, overbearing five-time Academy Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus, loudmouthed rapper Alpa Chino, and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy\u2014all cause problems for the inexperienced director Damien Cockburn, who cannot control them, resulting in a million-dollar pyrotechnics scene being wasted. With the project months behind schedule, studio executive Les Grossman gives Damien an ultimatum: get the cast under control or the project will be cancelled.\nOn Four Leaf's advice, Damien drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film \"guerrilla-style\". The actors have guns that fire blanks, along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unknown to the actors and production, the group has been dropped in the middle of the Golden Triangle, the home of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Just as the group is about to set off, Damien inadvertently steps on an old land mine and is blown up, stunning the actors. Tugg, believing Damien faked his death to encourage the cast to give better performances, assures the others that Damien is alive, and that they are still shooting the film. Kirk is unconvinced but joins them in their trek to get out of the jungle.\nWhen Four Leaf and pyrotechnics operator Cody Underwood try to locate the deceased director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon. Four Leaf is revealed to have hands; he confesses to Underwood that he actually served in the Coast Guard, has never left the United States, and that he wrote his \"memoir\" as a tribute. As the actors continue through the jungle, Kirk, who has become convinced that Tugg's ineptitude is putting them in jeopardy, and Kevin, the only actor who bothered to properly prepare for his role, discover that Tugg is leading them in the wrong direction. The resulting argument results in Kirk leading the rest of the cast back toward the resort they are staying at as an increasingly delirious Tugg is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their base, Tugg believes it is a POW camp from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the box-office bomb Simple Jack, and forces him to reenact it several times a day, leading him to become brainwashed.\nMeanwhile, in Los Angeles, Tugg's agent, Rick \"Pecker\" Peck, confronts Les over an unfulfilled term in Tugg's contract that entitles him to a TiVo. Flaming Dragon calls during the discussion and demands a ransom for Tugg, but Les instead delivers a profanity-laden death threat. Les is uninterested in rescuing Tugg and is instead delighted at the prospect of a large insurance payout if Tugg dies. He attempts to convince Pecker to play along by promising a Gulfstream V jet and \"lots of money\".\nKirk, Alpa, Jeff, and Kevin discover Flaming Dragon's heroin factory. After witnessing Tugg being tortured, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film's script. Kirk impersonates a farmer towing a \"captured\" Jeff on the back of a water buffalo, distracting the armed guards so Alpa and Kevin can infiltrate and find the prisoners, but a combination of broken Mandarin Chinese and inconsistencies in his story sets off the gang's boss. The actors, knowing their cover has been blown, begin firing, fooling the gang members into surrender. Their control of the gang falls apart when Jeff grabs the leader and heads for the drugs, and the gang, realizing the guns fire blanks, recover their guns and fight back.\nThe four actors locate Four Leaf, Underwood, and Tugg and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to Underwood's helicopter. Tugg initially remains behind, believing Flaming Dragon to be his \"family\", but runs back screaming, chased by an angry horde. Four Leaf destroys the bridge, rescuing Tugg, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang boss fires an RPG at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle and saves them by throwing a TiVo box into the path of the rocket.

The wife attempts to call the police to resolve the situation, but Smith shoots her and then the husband, and Jessica and Tanner flee again. The men catch both of them and torture Tanner first.

His battalion comes under attack by P-40 fighter-bombers of the No. 3 Squadron RAAF, Desert Air Force. Stauffenberg is severely injured in the air raid and is evacuated home to Germany, where he loses his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left hand.\nMeanwhile, Hitler visits his military headquarters on the Eastern Front. General Henning von Tresckow attempts to assassinate Hitler by smuggling a timebomb disguised as a box of Cointreau onto his plane. The bomb fails to detonate, and Hitler's plane lands safely in Berlin. Shortly afterwards, resistance member General Hans Oster is arrested by the Gestapo. While recuperating, Stauffenberg is recruited by General Friedrich Olbricht to take Oster's place in the German Resistance, which includes Tresckow, General Ludwig Beck, Dr. Carl Goerdeler, and Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben.\nStauffenberg proposes using Operation Valkyrie, which involves the deployment of the Reserve Army in a national emergency, as a means to take control of the country. The plotters redraft the plan's orders to dismantle the Nazi regime after assassinating Hitler. Stauffenberg's promotion within the Reserve Army grants him direct access to Hitler, who approves the redrafted plan without fully examining the modifications. Realizing that only General Friedrich Fromm, the head of the Reserve Army, can initiate Valkyrie, they offer him a position as head of the Wehrmacht; but Fromm, although agreeing to remain silent on the matter, declines to be directly involved.\nStauffenberg is ordered to assassinate both Hitler and Himmler at the Wolf's Lair. He persuades General Fellgiebel to cut off communications after the attempt. On July 15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at the Wolf's Lair with a bomb, but does not receive permission to proceed as Himmler is absent. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht. Stauffenberg leaves with the bomb and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down. Fromm threatens Olbricht and Stauffenberg that he will arrest them if they try to control the Reserve Army again; Stauffenberg berates the plotters for their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.\nOn July 20, 1944, Stauffenberg and his adjutant Lieutenant von Haeften return to the Wolf's Lair. Due to the warm weather, the conference is being held in an open-window summer barrack, minimizing their bomb's potential effectiveness. Stauffenberg places the briefcase containing the bomb close to Hitler before leaving. Officer Heinz Brandt moves the case behind a table leg, inadvertently shielding Hitler. When the bomb explodes, Stauffenberg is certain that Hitler is dead and flees, managing to bluff his way past security checkpoints and returning to Berlin.\nOlbricht refuses to mobilize the Reserve Army without confirmation that Hitler is dead; but Colonel von Quirnheim, one of the plotters, forges his signature and issues the orders. With Valkyrie underway, the plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup, and soldiers begin to take control of the ministries. Rumors surface that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Having learned from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive, Fromm refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him.\nMajor Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but he's stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler. Recognizing the voice on the other end, Remer realizes that the Reserve Army has been duped. Soon, SS officers are released and the plotters are besieged inside the Bendlerblock. The headquarters staff flees, but the resistance leaders are arrested. Attempting to save himself, Fromm convenes an impromptu court martial, during which he places Beck under arrest, and sentences von Quirnheim, Olbricht, von Haeften, and Stauffenberg to death.

The mayor of Salamanca introduces the President, who is shot twice as he reaches the podium, soon followed by an explosion outside the plaza. Moments later, a secondary explosion at the podium kills and injures numerous people.\nBefore the President takes the stage, Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in an allegedly vacated building, and observes American tourist Howard Lewis filming the audience. After the President is shot, Barnes tackles a man named Enrique rushing to the podium. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN studio to view their footage. He receives a call from another Secret Service agent, who reports he is pursuing the suspected assassin; Barnes is then startled by an image from GNN's live feed.\nEnrique, a Spanish police officer guarding the Mayor, overhears his girlfriend Veronica being embraced by a stranger and plan to meet later under an overpass. Enrique confronts Veronica, who assures him of her love as he hands her a bag. When the President is shot, Enrique rushes to protect the Mayor but is tackled by Barnes.

They find the woman's wedding ring and take it down to Sheriff Tom Hendricks who walks in on Jack, who owns the local inn, and Georgie, who owns the car rental, flirting around and asks Georgie to check on the info for the found jeep.

Doc leaves town to take Jake to a hospital with Cal subbing in for him, and Nicky is taken to prison for growing pot. Meanwhile, Vera Collins tells Burton she only has a limited supply of C12 which will immobilize the snakes only for a short period, but she does not know the effects it will have on enhanced snakes, and points out that C12 will also kill humans. Burton tells Vera there has been a snakebite incident and she needs to examine the child bitten and determine if it is one of their vipers, and to contain the problem on Eden if so.

On Eden, Jack drives Maggie back to the inn, and promises she can be ungrounded around him, but she gets angry when Georgie shows up and storms off.

When they get off the phone, Vera Collins and Staffin ask to speak to Doc. Jack and Georgie, who have just finished sexual intercourse, are in the inn and Georgie is attempting to sleep while Jack showers. Georgie thinks Jack is teasing her again, but is attacked by the vipers and killed. Tom takes Cal to examine Nicky, still in prison. They speak about Joey, and Nicky shows remorse and sorrow about his death and the fight they had before he enlisted and left, ultimately leading to his death, then Cal exits, leaving his tools which Nicky uses to pick the lock and escape.

Cal and Nicky stumble upon Jack in a panic state, and Cal narrowly saves Nicky from a viper. They carry Jack's body away as fast as possible because Georgie's body is covered in vipers.\nDown at the lake, Tom finds more vipers, and unknowingly tells everyone to run for the hotel, however Maggie runs the wrong way in fear and does not reach inn. The snakes intrude the inn lobby where everyone is hiding, but Cal scares them off with a fire extinguisher. Against Tom's orders, Ellie leaves to find Maggie. She finds her, but they get surrounded on the bridge with no way out. Tom shows up and saves Maggie, who can not walk, and locks her in the safe room at the sheriff's office. Tom is killed by the snakes and Jack saves Ellie. They get cornered outside the office, but Cal and Nicky once more use the extinguisher to deter the snakes while they all hide in a van. Cal jumps out of the van and uses the extinguisher while rescuing Maggie and returning to the van, but Cal gets bitten in the process. The van refuses to start and they have to run for the closest place, the cafe back entrance, but Ellie gets attacked, and Cal barricades himself, an upset Maggie, and Nicky into the back room of the cafe using ice, inferring that they do not like the cold. They all bond over grievances of losing somebody they loved as Maggie mourns the supposed loss of her parents while Doc, Staffin and Vera show up to the island and are horrified by the scene they find, dozens of snakes still eating the bodies of dozens of corpses. They use grenades of C12 to subdue the snakes while making their way to the inn, while Jack is shown to be alive and finds Maggie, Nicky and Cal to take them to the inn also. One of the men with the rescue, Simpson, is taken down by a snake, and Vera is repulsed by Staffin's order to move on.\nEveryone meets up at the inn, and Vera tells everyone to go inside. Vera explains that rescue is not coming until morning, but the townspeople are restless and try to leave using the boat Bio Tech arrived on. This leads to a physical altercation in which Jack gets shot. The townspeople angrily leave the inn while Maggie has to be pulled away by Cal. Several people are attacked as they attempt to make it to the boats, and the remainder retreat back to the inn. Cal tries to save Jack, who is rapidly bleeding out, but Jack succumbs to his injuries despite Cal's efforts, and Nicky comforts Maggie. While in the bathroom, Cal finds Vera sick to her stomach and sobbing. Cal snaps at her, but she claims it is not her fault. Nicky bursts in and states that the snakes are all trying to get in now. Doc kills one, and they try to barricade the doors. One of Staffin's men, Lewison, cracks and tells the truth, that they were not there to rescue the town, they were sent to gather a few of the vipers and take them back, and that aircraft were coming in the morning to gas the entire island, killing everyone and everything left by then. Vera is shocked to hear this news, along with everyone else.\nCal, Doc, and Vera concoct a plan to lure the snakes off the boat so they can call off the airstrike and escape. Staffin secretly scolds Lewison for revealing plans, and tells him there is a contingency plan, as long as he can trust Lewison. Doc leads everyone in prayer as Cal and Nicky share a kiss in the backroom. Maggie guides everyone downstairs to where her dad stores a truck, and they attach any heat sources they can to it. Maggie wants to help, and Cal tells her to help Doc get to the boats so he can call off the airstrike. Lewison drives the truck while Cal, Staffin, Nicky, Vera and Brownie attract the snakes with heat and guide them to the greenhouse, where Cal plans to trap and kill them. Doc guides the rest of the townspeople to the boats, but when he tries to get ahold of the truck over the walkie talkies, he does not get a response and suspects something is wrong. Maggie takes off but Doc can not chase after her and departs with the boat. The truck has succeeded in guiding the snakes to the greenhouse, and they rush inside. Lewison is bitten, and Maggie shows up with more C12 to temporarily subdue the snakes, saving Cal. Vera uses fertilizer and gasoline to create bombs while the snakes slowly weaken the glass until they eventually get in. Staffin gets bitten and goes down. When he dies, they realize he had a radio on him the entire time, disproving his earlier lies that he did not have means of communication to call off the airstrike and realize he was planning to escape by himself and leave everyone else to die. Vera demands Burton call it off, but he thanks her for her scientific sacrifice and turns his radio off. Cal tries to radio Homeland Security, but they tell him Eden is under quarantine and the radio gets jammed by Bio Tech. Brownie accidentally shoots and cracks the glass roof and the snakes begin climbing in, killing Brownie.\nNicky and Vera use flares and propane tanks to ignite the greenhouse, causing a huge explosion. In the distance, they see the aircraft coming, but are relieved to realize Doc got through when they do not gas the island. Meanwhile, Burton is giving a speech about Bio Tech's profits to interviewers when his walkie talkie conversation with Vera admitting his plan to kill everyone to cover himself is played over the intercom. Burton is arrested, with Vera watching. It is revealed that Cal made the recording and was playing it over their speaker system through his computer.

Seven hundred years later, in 2805, the cleanup has failed and the last remaining active robot, named Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth Class (WALL\u00b7E) has developed a personality. WALL\u00b7E is able to remain active by salvaging parts from other inactive robots and lives in a large truck designed to carry the robots. \nOne day, WALL\u00b7E's routine of compressing trash and collecting interesting objects is broken by the arrival of an unmanned probe carrying an egg-shaped robot named Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator (EVE) who is sent to scan the planet for signs of sustainable life. WALL\u00b7E is smitten by the sleek, otherworldly robot, and the two begin to connect, until EVE goes into standby mode when WALL\u00b7E shows her his most recent find: a living seedling.

Ari is surprised to find that, although he had also fought in the conflict during his stint as an infantry soldier in the Israel Defense Forces, he recalls nothing of his deployment.

One evening, Wesley is told by a woman named Fox that his recently murdered father was an assassin, and the killer, Cross, is now hunting him. When Cross and Fox engage in a shootout, Wesley panics and is pursued by Cross. Fox flips Wesley into her car and then executes an escape. Wesley awakens in a factory surrounded by Fox and other assassins. The group's leader, Mr. Sloan, forces Wesley at gunpoint to shoot the wings off of several flies, which he does, much to Wesley's shock. Sloan explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually a rare ability that allows him to produce massive amounts of adrenaline, slowing his perception of his surroundings and granting him superhuman strength and speed. He reveals that Wesley's father, as well as Cross, were members of the Fraternity, a society of assassins that maintains balance in the world. Sloan wants to train him so that he may help kill Cross.\nA panicked Wesley leaves the building and awakens the next morning in his apartment. He discovers that his bank account now contains $3.6 million. Filled with new confidence, he insults his boss in front of the whole office and hits Barry in the face with a keyboard. Fox, waiting for Wesley, chauffeurs him to the Fraternity headquarters, a repurposed textile mill. Wesley trains under the Fraternity's cruel tutelage, learning to control his abilities; Fox teaching him speed, the Gunsmith teaching him marksmanship, such as curving a bullet, the Butcher teaching him hand-to-hand combat, the Exterminator teaching him explosives, and the Repairman teaching him pain resistance. When his training is complete, Sloan shows him the \"Loom of Fate\", which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code. Fox reveals that, her father was a judge, and his defendant hired a sadistic hitman who made her watch as he burned her father alive. When she later joined the Fraternity, she learned the hitman's name appeared in the Loom before he killed her father, but a member refused to kill him, which has made her a devote follower of the Fraternity's code.\nAfter several successful missions, and dumping his girlfriend with the help of Fox, Wesley has an unexpected shootout with Cross, where he accidentally kills the Exterminator.

Sloan grants Wesley's wish to avenge his father and sends him after Cross\u2014but then secretly gives Fox a mission to kill Wesley, saying that his name has come up in the Loom.

When Wesley faces Cross alone on a moving train, Fox crashes a car into the train, causing a derailment. While Cross saves Wesley from falling, Wesley shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this and explains that Wesley was recruited because he was the only person Cross would not kill. As Fox prepares to shoot Wesley, he shoots the train window below him and Cross, causing the men to free fall into the river. Wesley is retrieved by Pekwarsky, who takes him to Cross' apartment (which is located just opposite Wesley's) and explains that Sloan started manufacturing targets for profit after his name appeared in the Loom. Cross discovered the truth, went rogue, and started killing Fraternity members to keep them away from his son.\nPekwarsky departs, stating that Cross wished Wesley a life free of violence. Wesley, however, decides to kill Sloan in order to finish what his father started.

Entering Sloan's office, he is surrounded by Fox, Gunsmith, and the remaining assassins. Wesley discloses Sloan's deception, to which Sloan admits his name appeared in the loom alongside the names of those present, and that he had acted to protect them. He gives the members a choice: kill themselves, per the code, or kill Wesley and use their skills to control the world.

When his students, the third generation after the Second World War, do not believe that a dictatorship could be established in modern Germany, he starts an experiment to demonstrate how easily the masses can be manipulated. He begins by demanding that all students address him as \"Herr Wenger\", as opposed to Rainer, and places students with poor grades beside students with good grades \u2014 purportedly so they can learn from one another and become better as a whole. When speaking, they must stand and give short, direct answers. Wenger shows his students the effect of marching together in the same rhythm, motivating them by suggesting that they are superior to the anarchy class, which is below them. Wenger suggests a uniform of a white shirt and jeans, to remove class distinction and further unite the group. A student in the class named Mona argues it will remove individuality, but she is dismissed. Another student in the class named Karo shows up to class without the uniform and is ostracized. The students decide among themselves they need a name, deciding on \"Die Welle\" (The Wave). Karo suggests another name, but she is the only person in the class who votes for it.\nThe group is shown to grow closer together, and former bullies Sinan and Bomber are shown to reform, protecting Tim, the class outcast, from a pair of anarchists demanding he sell them drugs. Sinan also creates a distinctive logo for the group, while Bomber creates a salute. Tim becomes very attached to the group, having finally become an accepted member of a social group. He burns all of his brand-name clothes, after a discussion about how large corporations do not take responsibility for their actions. Karo and Mona protest the actions of the group, and Mona, disgusted with how her classmates are embracing fascism, leaves the project group. Her other classmates do not see the connection with fascism and continue attending the class. The members of The Wave begin spray-painting their logo around town at night, having parties where only Wave members are allowed to attend, and ostracizing and tormenting anyone not in their group.\nWhen Tim and his group of new friends are confronted by a group of angry punks (including those that Tim faced previously), Tim pulls a Walther PP pistol, causing them to back down. Tim explains to his shocked friends that the pistol only fires blanks. Tim later shows up at Wenger's house, offering to be his bodyguard. Although he declines his offer, Wenger still invites Tim in for dinner; this puts further strain on his already tense relationship with his wife, Anke, who thinks his experiment has gone too far. Wenger finally asks Tim to leave his house, only to find the next morning that Tim had slept outside on his doorstep. Anke, upset upon learning this, tells Wenger to stop the experiment immediately. Wenger accuses her of being jealous and insults her dependency on pills. Shocked, Anke leaves him, saying the Wave has made him into a terrible person.\nKaro continues her opposition to the Wave, earning the anger of many in the group, who ask her boyfriend, Marco, to do something about it. A water polo competition is due to happen later that day, and Wenger asks the Wave to show up in support of the team. Karo and Mona, denied entry to the competition by members of The Wave, sneak in another way in order to distribute anti-Wave fliers. Members of the Wave notice this and scramble to retrieve the papers before anybody reads them. In the chaos, Sinan starts a fight with an opposing team member, the two almost drowning each other. Members of the Wave in the stands begin to violently shove one another. After the match, Marco confronts Karo and accuses her of causing the fight. She replies that the Wave has brainwashed him completely. He slaps Karo, causing her to get a nosebleed. Unsettled by his own behaviour, Marco approaches Wenger and asks him to stop the project. Wenger seemingly agrees and calls a rally for the Wave members for the following day in the school's auditorium.\nOnce in the rally, Wenger has the doors locked and begins whipping the students into a fervour. When Marco protests, Wenger calls him a traitor and orders the students to bring him to the stage for punishment. However, Wenger turns out to have been acting and was using this meeting to test the students and to see how extreme the Wave has become. Wenger declares that he is disbanding the Wave, but Dennis argues that they should try to salvage the good parts of the movement. Wenger points out there is no way to remove the negative elements of fascism. Seeing the movement falling apart right in front of his very eyes, Tim suffers a mental breakdown and pulls out a gun, refusing to accept the Wave is over as he does not want to lose all that he's gained. When Bomber says the gun only fires blanks and tries to take it, Tim shoots him, revealing it has live rounds. When Tim asks why he shouldn't shoot Wenger too, Wenger says that without him, there would be no one to lead the Wave and it would just die anyway. Utterly consumed by despair, Tim abruptly shoots himself in the head, preferring to commit suicide than go on living without the movement.\nHorrified, Wenger cradles his corpse and looks on helplessly at how his own vanity and foolishness have resulted in his whole class being scarred for the rest of their lives. The film ends with Wenger being arrested by the police and driven away, Bomber being taken away to the hospital, and Marco and Karo being re-united; the final shot shows Wenger in the back of a police car, staring blankly into the camera, a look of distress on his face.", "tmdb_plot": "A school teacher discusses types of government with his class.

In Georgia, he is met by his pickpocketing cousin Reggie, accompanied by his girlfriend Amy; and arrives at the family home to greet his parents, Roscoe Sr. and Mama Jenkins; his brother Otis, the town sheriff; Otis' wife Ruthie and their overgrown kids, Junior and Callie; and Roscoe's rowdy sister Betty.

Having spent nearly nine years away from his family, Roscoe attempts to impress his family and friends with his newfound wealth and success but fails.\nThroughout his stay, Roscoe endures much self-humiliation: he accidentally hits his mother in the head with a softball during a game, is beaten up by Otis and Betty after insulting them, faces constant blackmail by Reggie, inadvertently ruins the family fish fry by getting into a physical fight with Clyde, and is sprayed by a skunk while sleeping.

Stunned by this admission, Roscoe Sr. realizes he himself is the reason his son left home and walks off feeling guilty and ashamed.

Thus, the residential facility is hesitant to recommend him to the group home for adults and Joe must take his son home, at least for a few weeks.

At school, he falls in love with the beautiful Ada (Tanya Ilieva), later nicknamed \"Mantis\". Out of a desire for money, he agrees to work for a shady neighbour known as Slug (Vladimir Penev). The two plot the theft of a black diamond from the white \u00e9migr\u00e9 jeweller Vlad the Bijou's house. The robbery ends in failure as Moth is wounded by The Bijou and captured by the police; Slug manages to escape and is never charged. There is no trace of the diamond, and as Vlad is killed by Slug during the robbery, the police never get to know of its existence.\nIn the Sofia prison, Moth, besides working out to patriotic Soviet music, also befriends his older roommate Van Wurst the Eye (Mihail Mutafov), so nicknamed because he has been wearing an ocular prosthesis after losing one of his eyes during a robbery in Barcelona. Besides being an avid boxer and arm wrestler, Van Wurst also has his philosophical views on life, such as a theory about the destructive power of women, which he shares with Moth.

Outside, Moth is picked by a warrant officer and a younger soldier who drive him in a Chaika to the Baths. In the damp basement of the Baths, he is interrogated and tortured by Slug, now a locally influential member of the communist nomenklatura, who believes Moth knows the location of the black diamond. Moth denies and even doubts the diamond ever existed; he later manages to escape, but not before he consumes iridium-poisoned wine offered to him by Slug.\nWandering drunk and intoxicated around Sofia and seeking his old girlfriend Ada, Moth gets to witness the new socialist reality he had only heard about on the prison radio: the look of the city has changed with The Largo and the Georgi Dimitrov Mausoleum, but the nature of the people has remained essentially the same. The protagonist meets a variety of bizarre characters, such as drug-doing medics, weird patients and local drunks.

He later reveals to Ada that he is aware of the diamond's location: in Vlad the Bijou's coffin. The two go to the graveyard, where Moth first insists to visit the grave of his son. However, he realizes that it is another Leonid's grave (his mother had been buried in the same grave very recently) and that he never actually had a son. At the same time he notices Slug standing behind him with Ada, who had apparently betrayed him.

A small group of exotic dancers team up with the prostitutes' former pimp to defend their strip club, the Grindhouse, against a horde of blood-thirsty zombies.\nFour strippers in a nightclub, after their dance routines are over and the club is closing for the night, walk over to a nearby cafeteria for breakfast, when some hookers turn into zombies and attack them. Except for one stripper Pandora, played by Juliet Reeves, who couldn't make it till the end, the other 3 ladies manage to fight and decimate all the zombies and survive through it all.\nThe prettiest and tallest of the 3 surviving strippers is Dakota, played by Playboy playmate Jessica Barton. She is the most popular (and most tipped) stripper of the club, but that comes with quite some attitude. During the course of the movie, she gives a lap dance to one of her lovers, but then he gets bitten and turns into a zombie. Dakota has to blow this lover-turned-zombie (as well as her boyfriend cop-turned-zombie) with her gun.\nThe second stripper is Dallas, played by Miss Oahu Lyanna Tumaneng. She is clearly the most courageous of the trio, as she braved zombie attacks to get the zombie antidote from the laboratory. The male lead Chris, played by Sean Harriman, was on the same mission alongside Dallas and managed to inject himself with the zombie antidote that they found in the lab. Eventually, Chris falls in love with her.\nThe third stripper is Chris' sister Harley, played by Playboy playmate Hollie Winnard. She is a single mom of a little daughter and they stay with Chris and their grandmother. This was Harley's very first night at the club, where she plays a nervous rookie and she performs a quick but funny tease.\nDuring the beginning of the film the strippers have a difficult time identifying themselves to each other. They awkwardly introduce each other by their stage name, and their real names. Their indecisiveness in their career lead to differences in how strippers should be treated by themselves, others, and of course zombies.\nAs the battle between the zombies and the remaining survivors heats up, the zombies start to get the upper hand. Though the survivors are locked inside a safe room, the buxom hooker-turned-zombie named Pamela, as played by Stephanie Miller, manages to get inside. In the skirmish, Chris loses to her strength, as Pamela bites him and takes a chunk off his forehead. But thanks to the zombie antidote in his blood, Pamela is soon blown to smithereens. Harley and Dakota do not understand what happened, so Dallas explains that exposing Chris' blood to the zombies is a sure way to destroy them all. To test the idea, Chris offers his right hand to a zombie outside the door, and upon biting Chris, that zombie is blown apart as well.\nSeeing the plan work so well, Dakota suggests that they should let 2 zombies into the room. The plan works well for the first couple of times, as 2 zombies are let into the room at a time, and after biting the shoulders of Chris, they are blown apart. But soon, a very weakened Chris collapses on the floor. Hell breaks loose, as all the remaining zombies manage to break into the room and attack them. With no other option to save the 3 girls, Chris gets up for his final action. He requests his sister Harley to take care of her daughter Jenna, whom Chris used to babysit back at home. He then gives a farewell kiss to his love interest Dallas. Chris offers himself to the pack of zombies, with the girls making no effort at all to stop him from doing so. At the outset, the zombies cut through Chris' ribs and eat up his heart, as the girls look on. Within a very short time, the zombies finish him off and then blow themselves apart as expected. The devouring of Chris by the zombies happens at a pretty high speed, instead of his arms, legs, torso, etc. being chomped step-by-step. Finally, all that is left of Chris are just some blood and flesh splattered on the club floor, along with that of the exploded zombies.\nWith all zombies finally eliminated, the 3 girls wipe the goo off their hair and walk out of the nightclub in supermodel catwalk style, smiles of victory writ large on their face. Their outfits are still smeared with flesh and blood of zombies and Chris alike. Out in the open daylight, Dallas smilingly comments to Harley that they had a rough last night.
