After the competition, David approaches Jill's similarly attired opponent from behind and flirts with her, thinking she is his girlfriend. Intrigued, she kisses David, and Jill storms off angrily after walking in on them. Later, David meets with his friend Teddy, a sex-obsessed student who tells him that Jill will attend a house party later. Hoping that she will speak with him in person, David attends the party, too.\nA meteor lands near the site of the party, and electrical arcs cause a momentary blackout. The wild revelers do not notice brief, anomalous phenomena that occur during the blackout, such as a mirror image out of sync, but a drug dealer's girlfriend outside the party becomes spooked. As the raucous party proceeds, David searches the house for Jill, and Teddy attempts to charm Melanie. To Teddy's surprise, Melanie invites him to join her upstairs in ten minutes. Meanwhile, David spies on Jill as she flirts with a friend, and Allison, an outsider, unsuccessfully attempts to fit in. David attempts to apologize to Jill, but she becomes more angry with his fumbled apology and says that he makes her feel replaceable. The party moves outside, and the house empties except for David, Teddy, Allison, and Melanie.\nWhen Teddy joins Melanie upstairs, he finds her naked on a bed. They proceed to have sex, and she steps into the shower afterward. During a second blackout, a duplicate of Melanie appears on the bed, surprised to find Teddy in the room. When the original Melanie exits the shower, the two Melanies come face-to-face, and Teddy flees the room in a panic. David confirms that the house has filled with duplicates of the party-goers, who repeat the actions their originals took ten minutes ago. Outside, the drug dealer and his duplicate get into a violent confrontation, and David watches as one of them murders the other. Worried that the duplicates may be hostile, the originals attempt to hide. Eventually, the duplicates disappear.\nWith each blackout, the duplicates momentarily reappear and reenact increasingly more recent actions. David becomes convinced that he can save his relationship if he crafts a better apology to Jill's duplicate, Allison befriends her duplicate, and Teddy accidentally ruins the rendez-vous between his and Melanie's duplicates. Teddy warns the others that his duplicate will now become belligerent, and he convinces the party-goers, most of whom are still skeptical, to hide from their duplicates in a pool house. When the duplicates reappear, David knocks his own duplicate unconscious and charms Jill's duplicate, and Teddy's duplicate attempts to convince the skeptical crowd of duplicates to attack the originals.\nWorried about their safety, several of the originals sneak out and murder their duplicates, which turns the enraged duplicates hostile. The originals retreat back to the pool house, and the duplicates lay siege. The next blackout causes the duplicates to appear inside the pool house. The crowded room erupts in violence, and several people die, including Teddy. David tracks down the original Jill, who had wandered back to the house, and he murders her so that he can be with her duplicate. Allison seduces her duplicate, and they share a kiss. The final blackout causes the duplicates and originals to merge. David and Jill leave together and make their way to the pool house and have a make-out session. The confused party-goers stagger out of the pool house, and they begin to disperse.

However, after much pestering, the local inspector has one of his men take Ram and Lizzy to the slums in north Chennai to meet a petty criminal, Nayanar, who knows about all the crimes done by the dwellers in his area. Initially, he pretends not to know anything. However, after Lizzy begs at his feet, he finally reveals that Gautham might have been taken to Nagari in neighboring Andhra Pradesh to be sold to a local pimp, Krishna Rao. Ram then leaves for the pimp's brothel with two friends but finds that Rao only deals with grown women and not little children.\nBack in Chennai, Ram goes to meet Nayanar, who accidentally let slip that Gautham might have been taken to another town in Andhra Pradesh although he is unsure of it. Coincidentally, the taxi driver, Rangan, who drove Ram and Lizzy to the slums, earlier meets Ram and tells him he has driven a businessman from that town back to his home after meeting Nayanaar a few years ago. The driver reluctantly agrees to take Ram there. Back in Andhra Pradesh, Ram and Rangan meet the businessman, Nallama Reddy who claims to lead an honest living by selling rice. However, Ram realizes Reddy is lying as the temple board states he is a quarry dealer. Ram holds Reddy's grandson at gunpoint and forces Reddy to reveal where Gautham is. Reddy then tells Ram his son might have been taken to a butchery at a nearby town.\nAt the butchery, the local gangsters already know that Ram is coming for them. Ram is prepared to face their attack. While struggling with the gang, its leader tells Ram that he already killed Gautham and sold the other children he abducted to a child trafficker in Bhopal named Nikhil Motwani after Reddy told them Ram is coming. Once the gangsters are defeated, Ram searches for Gautham's body but instead finds the corpse of another boy. Realizing that the gangsters killed the wrong boy, Ram is confident that Gautham is being taken to Bhopal and leaves immediately.\nAt Bhopal, Ram and Rangan manage to arrange a meeting with Motwani by posing as businessmen, but the human trafficker recognizes Ram from the news. He tells Ram that Gautham is being held by his henchman, Diwakar, and they can only release the boy if they are paid 1 crore. With no other choice, Ram calls up Lizzy to prepare the money and is taken to Diwakar's hideout. Unable to control himself after seeing a young schoolgirl almost being raped, Ram saves her by fighting off Diwakar's men and taking her to the Times of India's headquarters. When Ram and Rangan return to the hideout, they find it empty. As they explore the place, they discover that Gautham and many other abducted children have been kept prisoned there all along.

Ram survives, but Rangan is fatally shot. Before dying, Rangan reveals to Ram that he was the driver hired to drive Gautham's abductors around Chennai in search of victims.

Despite being erratic, odd and tyrannical with Natascha, in public Wolfgang is socially awkward and very lonely, with his only contact being his mother, who occasionally comes to visit and bring meals to him. Witness descriptions of the van lead police to interrogate Wolfgang, but do not find anything suspicious.\nFor the next four years Natascha is forbidden from leaving the cellar. Malnourishment, boredom, despair and Wolfgang's incessant psychological manipulation bring her down, giving up any intentions of escaping. Only when Natascha begins menstruating is she allowed to leave the cellar and shower, and from then on, she is allowed to be out more often.

The pair quickly fall for one another, leaving quite a few of the boys heartbroken.\nDespite repeated pleas for peace in the studio, the two main gangs continue to clash, driving Vishnu to his wit's end. However, the students seem to improve and as a reward, he gives them money to buy new speakers, but they nearly lose it all when Rhea takes them to an elite dance club where they challenge the resident champions, a professional dance crew called \"Fictitious Crew\".

Faced with ridicule and the idea that they are a joke and not true dancers, Vishnu asks Rocky and D to do a step that requires a great deal of trust from both, but they cannot muster the trust to manage it. Vishnu has them choose the people they would trust to perform the step with, but then tricks both dancers by blindfolding them and having them attempt it again; this time, they are successful. Vishnu then states that unless the two manage to do the step without blindfolds none of the dancers would be allowed to go home for the night.

Bhavana and D get together, D completes the move successfully with Rocky, and the two factions begin to trust each other and work together.

They are assigned the unpopular late-night timeslot while obnoxious rival anchorman Jack Lime is put in a primetime slot. Meanwhile, Burgundy finds that Corningstone has started dating psychologist Gary.\nAs GNN launches, Burgundy decides to broadcast what the people want to hear, rather than what they need to hear. He and his team devise a sensationalist and patriotic newscast. Their new approach proves to be a hit, beating Lime in ratings massively, and the other news networks scramble to emulate them. Ron also wins a bet with Lime forcing him to legally change his name to Jack Lame. \nBurgundy and his team are promoted to primetime, where they enjoy fame and fortune. Burgundy's success excites GNN's manager, Linda Jackson, and they begin seeing each other. Tamland meets similarly eccentric GNN office worker Chani and immediately falls in love. Burgundy lets his newfound fame get to his head and neglects his parental obligations to Walter, angering Corningstone. He also alienates Fantana, Kind, and Tamland, claiming he is tired of carrying them.\nDuring a party celebrating GNN's success, Lame causes Burgundy to slip and suffer a head injury, resulting in him becoming blind. Unable to read the news, Burgundy isolates himself in a lighthouse, unable to adjust to his loss of vision. Corningstone arrives with Walter for a visit, announcing that she has quit her own job, and Burgundy bonds with his family, gradually adjusting to his disability. Burgundy and his son rehabilitate a small shark, naming him Doby before setting him free. \nLater, Burgundy discovers that Corningstone was concealing messages from his eye doctor regarding an experimental procedure, as she thought his blindness has been significant in the family rebonding. He leaves angrily, gets his vision restored, and returns to GNN.\nBack in New York, Burgundy is once again approached by Corningstone, who pleads with him to attend Walter's piano recital. At the same time, an exclusive news story comes in, requiring him to cover it. However, on live television, Burgundy instead admits that news is supposed to inform, not entertain, and takes responsibility for the mistakes he made, following it up by quitting and walking off. \nBurgundy leaves for Walter's recital but is intercepted by an angered Lame and his team and several other news teams, all of whom want to kill him due to his fame. Kind, Fantana, and Tamland arrive to defend him and a massive battle ensues. Burgundy's old arch-rival Wes Mantooth arrives in time to save him from Lame's news crew, before Tamland accidentally sets off an explosion. \nBurgundy reaches Walter's recital in time, and reconciles with Corningstone. Later, attending Tamland's and Chani's wedding on the beach, Ron spots Doby in the water.

His father, police inspector Vijaykant Phogat (Anupam Kher), had lost interest in life years back, after messing up an operation to kill Yashvardhan Singh (Jackie Shroff), due to lack of evidence against him. Yashvardhan's wife, Veera (Tanvi Azmi), had become a police informer against her own husband and had to run away from him with one of her twin children Vishal (Arjun Kapoor) while Ajay is left with Yashvardhan.

Years later, just before he dies, he reveals to Arya that he has another wife and kid but doesn't reveal their real identity. Vijaykant dies a few days later, and Arya goes to meet Veera. There he is shocked to see Vishal, who is the exact replica of Ajay (Arjun Kapoor), and there is a revelation that both lookalikes are actually twins.\nRavikant, who is corrupt to the core, hatches a plot to expose the criminal activities of Yashvardhan, a mission left incomplete by his brother Vijaykant. He joins forces with nephew Arya and convinces Vishal to enter Yashvardhan's house, posing as Ajay. To facilitate matters, Ajay is kidnapped by Ravikant and Arya and held captive by them, paving the way for Vishal to take his place and leak information about Yashvardhan's illegal activities to the police. Vishal has to pose as Ajay not just in front of his own father, Yashvardhan, but also in front of Neena Wadhwa (Amrita Singh), Yashvardhan's paramour and business partner, while also having to feign an affair with his twin brother's girlfriend, Ritu (Zara Khan). As days pass, Vishal falls in love with Ritu. One night they strip each other and it is implied they had sex. Vishal keeps leaking information about his dad to Ravikant and Arya, who move forward in their expos\u00e9 with the help of the incriminating evidence.

He also wins the confidence of his father, who is unaware that Vishal has replaced Ajay in the house. Calamity befalls Yashvardhan because of the action initiated by Ravikant, and he has to be hospitalised. Vishal manipulates things in such a way that Neena has to resign from Yashvardhan Singh's company. Even as the tension between Arya and foster-brothers Ajay and Vishal refuses to be diffused, the task before Ravikant and Arya becomes very difficult. To make matters more difficult for Ravikant, his son-in-law, Vishnu (Sumeet Vyas), lays his hands on evidence against Ravikant's equally corrupt police officer-son, Inspector Dev (Sikandar Kher). Since Vishnu is the only honest cop in the family, he threatens to expose brother-in-law Dev, and in order to prevent this, Ravikant kills Vishnu. Ravikant also plans to take over Yashvardhan's empire with help from Neena, and orders Arya to kill Veera and Ajay. Arya, disillusioned by Ravikant's inhuman attitude, finally understands the choice his father Vijaykant made earlier to protect Vishal and his mother.\nMeanwhile, Vishal is called for a meeting by Neena and her new partner, Bilal. Ravikant wants Vishal to use the meeting to give him more information about Yashvardhan, and plans things in such a way that Yashvardhan would be killed once the meeting between Vishal and Neena is over. Arya realises that Ravikant wants to eliminate Yashvardhan not as much to complete brother Vijaykant's mission as to take over Yashvardhan's business empire. Also, Vishal has revenge written all over him because Neena's son, Inder (Kavi Shastri), had killed Ritu. Here, Ajay finally relents and agrees to help Arya, but he also wants his dad, Yashvardhan's safety. Arya asks Ajay to attend the meeting in place of Vishal.  Ajay kills Inder, and when Inder's gang tries to kill Ajay, Arya's police team encounters all. Meanwhile, Arya has sent Vishal to the hospital to save Yashvardhan.

His mother, Lady Zheng, commissions Yu Xiufeng, a craftsman from Mount Meicen, to create a porcelain figurine of Guanyin so that she can pray to the bodhisattva to bless her son with good health. On the day the figurine is completed, Yu Xiufeng and his grandson, Haisheng, discover a baby girl in a lotus pond. Yu Xiufeng adopts the baby girl as his granddaughter and names her \"Lianmei\" (\"lotus sister\"). The figurine is taken to Mount Wutai and enshrined in a Buddhist temple there.\nIn 845 CE, Emperor Wuzong orders the Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution because he thinks that Buddhism is corrupting the masses. He also senses that Prince Guang will become a threat to him, so he sends General Yuchi to assassinate the prince. At the same time, the Reverend Wuchen asks Yu Xiufeng to collect the figurine from Mount Wutai and hide it at Mount Meicen. During the journey, Yu Xiufeng and his grandchildren meet Egaku, a Japanese Buddhist monk sent by Empress Tachibana to find and bring the figurine to Japan. As Lady Zheng had secretly tasked General Yuchi's deputy, General Sima, with protecting her son, Sima saves Prince Guang when Yuchi is about to kill him. Sima defeats Yuchi in a duel and wants to finish him off, but Lianmei stops him and asks him to spare Yuchi. Prince Guang and Sima accompany Yu Xiufeng, Lianmei and Haisheng as they bring the figurine back to Mount Meicen. Egaku finds out later and makes his way to Mount Meicen too.\nYuchi tracks down Prince Guang with the help of the governor of Mingzhou. Lianmei and Haisheng disguise themselves as Prince Guang and Sima in order to lure Yuchi to chase them, while the real Prince Guang and Sima use the opportunity to escape.

Haisheng sees Egaku fleeing and immediately suspects that Egaku killed his grandfather and stole the figurine, so he chases Egaku, catches up with him, and starts beating him. Lianmei stops Haisheng and tells him she believes Egaku when he claims he is innocent. However, she refuses to let Egaku take the figurine with him. Egaku feels so ashamed of himself that he gives up and returns to Japan.\nLianmei and Haisheng are captured later at a roadblock in Mingzhou by the governor, who seizes the figurine from them. The governor then tries to bribe Yuchi to help him cover up for his failure to hunt down Prince Guang, but Yuchi refuses and accuses him of corruption. Meanwhile, Haisheng escapes from the prison and drags Lianmei along with him. Yuchi is furious when he learns of their escape and orders the other prisoners to be executed. However, Lianmei succeeds in convincing Haisheng to go back to the prison with her because she knows what would happen if they escaped. Yuchi is so impressed by Lianmei's act of self-sacrifice that he spares the prisoners.\nYuchi sets a trap to lure Prince Guang out of hiding. He announces that Lianmei and Haisheng will be executed for helping a fugitive escape, and predicts that Prince Guang will come to save them. As expected, the prince appears and turns himself in to Yuchi in exchange for Lianmei and Haisheng's release. However, Sima also shows up and fights with Yuchi and his soldiers to save Prince Guang.

A fierce storm suddenly breaks out and causes the figurine to be cast overboard. When the storm has subsided, Egaku is deeply saddened to learn that Lianmei and the figurine are lost at sea. Just then, lotuses appear all over the water surface. Egaku sees a vision of Lianmei as Guanyin on Mount Meicen, and realises that he is not destined to bring the figurine back to Japan.

When the cousins reach adulthood, the Mansfields commission an oil portrait of their two great-nieces, but Dido fears she will be portrayed as a subordinate, similar to other portraits she has seen depicting aristocrats with black servants.\nDido's father dies, leaving her a vast sum of \u00a32,000 a year, making her an heiress. Lady Elizabeth, by contrast, will have no income from her father, as his son from his new wife has been named sole heir. Arrangements are made for Elizabeth to have her coming-out to society, but Lord and Lady Mansfield believe no gentleman will agree to marry Dido because of her mixed race. Fearing lower-ranking men will only marry her for her wealth, and that a marriage to a lower-status man will reduce her rank and shame the family, Lord Mansfield decides she will travel to London with her cousin but will not be \"out\" to society, and he asks her to take her spinster great-aunt Mary's place as the keeper of the house, with the implication that she will not marry.\nLord Mansfield agrees to take the vicar's son, John Davinier, into a law pupillage.

Oliver, who is without fortune, proposes to Dido and she accepts, although she continues to see John in secret. James takes Dido aside, tells her she will disgrace his family's name, then insults and gropes her.\nDido later tells Elizabeth of James' true character, offering to give her part of her inheritance as a dowry so she can find a different match.

Sometime later, she meets Oliver and breaks off their engagement.\nDido is relieved when the painting is unveiled, she is shown as Elizabeth's equal. She tells Lord Mansfield that the portrait commission proves that he can defy convention.\nDido sneaks into the balcony of the Inn of Court, to hear Lord Mansfield narrowly rule that the Gregson slave-trading syndicate is not due insurance payments for the slaves the crew threw overboard during the voyage. The ship's officers claimed they ordered this action because they were out of potable water, but Lord Mansfield had discovered that the Zong passed by many ports without stopping for more water, before murdering the slaves. The slaves' quarters were overcrowded, making them sick and not likely to fetch a high price at auction, so the officers had decided they would be worth more in insurance payments after their \"loss\", and so threw them overboard.

The story revolves around Virgil Oldman (Geoffrey Rush), an ageing, wealthy, and esteemed, but somewhat standoffish and eccentric, managing director of a preeminent auction house. Oldman is hired by a mysterious young heiress, Claire Ibbetson (Sylvia Hoeks), to auction off the large collection of art and antiques left to her by her parents. Claire always refuses to be seen in person, suffering from severe agoraphobia and never leaving her room. She decided to trust Oldman though as he suffers himself from OCD. Soon enough Virgil, a lifelong bachelor who is able to relate to her reclusiveness, understands that he has fallen in love with her.\nAn astute young artisan, Robert (Jim Sturgess), who has a shop repairing and restoring clocks, aids Oldman in restoring and reassembling some odd mechanical parts that he finds among Claire's belongings, which appear to be from a potentially valuable historic automaton, while also giving him advice on how to befriend her, and how to deal with his feelings towards her. Oldman's poise and prestige are counterpointed by an ongoing scam whereby his friend Billy Whistler (Donald Sutherland) helps him acquire a large private collection of master portraits worth many millions, by presenting them at auction as the work of other artists.  Billy is an aspiring artist himself, but Oldman does not take Billy's work seriously.\nA side narrative involves Virgil discovering a mouldy, charred piece of wood at another client's mansion.  Professional restoration reveals a painting underneath which Virgil falsely states is by a 16th-century forger who, unable to reveal herself as female, simply signs paintings as \"V.\"  Virgil notes to these other clients that all forgers are irresistibly tempted to modify the original, which reveals the forger's own artistic sensibilities.  At auction, the painting is sold for \u00a390,000, but after Virgil explains to Billy he knew that it was, in fact, an original worth some \u00a38 million, Billy buys the painting for Virgil from its original buyer for \u00a3250,000.\nOldman eventually begins a relationship with Ibbetson, compromising his work. At the peak of the relationship, Claire overcomes her fear of the outside world and Virgil lays aside his gloves. Claire goes on to live with Virgil, who trusts the fragile Claire enough to show her his secret priceless collection of female portraits. Overcome with emotion, Claire tells Virgil that no matter what may happen to the two of them, she does love him.  \nVirgil returns home one day to find that his entire collection and Claire are gone. In the vault is the completed automaton constructed from the mechanical parts Virgil gave to Robert, which plays a message from Robert saying there is something real in every forgery and that is why Robert will truly miss Virgil. He also discovers that a supposed portrait of Claire's mother was in fact painted by Billy and has been left to him with a telling inscription. Virgil realizes that he is the victim of an elaborate fraud conducted by Robert, Claire, and Billy, but is unable to go to the police due to the illicit means by which Virgil himself acquired the works. He also discovers that the real \"Claire,\" owner of the villa and its contents, is a young savant, disabled and confined to a wheelchair, who has been watching him visit the villa on numerous occasions from a caf\u00e9 across the street in which Virgil has himself spent time. She reveals that she has hired the villa out to some film directors for this whole event to be staged, and has seen the supposedly agoraphobic, fake \"Claire\" come and go from the villa hundreds of times. \nWe (the audience) are not told explicitly who is behind the \"sting\" or scam, but at one prior point Claire, unaware that she is being observed by Virgil, talks to someone on the phone who she calls the \"Director;\" if this is Billy, a possible motive is that he too is an artist but has never received any encouragement or appreciation from Virgil, and the sting is an act of revenge on his part. \nAn alternative suggestion by some viewers is that Billy, and possibly Robert, wish to draw Virgil out of his previous life in which he had little real contact or empathy with other humans, and the loss of his possessions may be a price he has to pay to gain the insights he has hitherto avoided.\nAfter months of recovering from the betrayal in a mental institution, Virgil takes a trip to Prague, where he spends time sitting in a restaurant that Claire had once suggested.

His memories are full of the chaos surrounding the 1947 Partition of India, which resulted in mass religious violence in Punjab and the killing of Singh's parents. The flashback shows Singh reaching Delhi alone, where he later meets his sister. Living in impoverished refugee camps, Milkha makes friends and survives by stealing with them. Now grown up, he falls in love with Biro, who asks him to live a life of honesty.\nMilkha soon finds himself in the army. There, he wins a race in which the top 10 runners are rewarded milk, two eggs, and are excused from fatigue duty; his running skills are noticed by a havaldar (sergeant). He gets selected for service commission, where he is miffed. On the day before selection of the Indian team for the Olympics, Singh is beaten up by senior players whom he had defeated earlier. Despite being injured, he participates in the race and overcomes his pain; he wins the race and breaks the national record. Proud of his achievement, Milkha goes back to Delhi to ask Biro's hand in marriage. However, his friend informs him that Biro was married and left Delhi.\nDuring the Melbourne 1956 Olympics, Singh is attracted to Stella, the granddaughter of his Australian technical coach. After a frolicking night in a bar, they have a one-night stand. The following day, he feels exhausted from the night's activities and loses the final race. He realises his mistake and, suffering from guilt, he even slaps himself in front of a mirror. On the flight back to India, he asks his coach what the world record is for the 400m race and learns that it is 45.9 seconds. A montage of tyre training in the cold desert of the Himalayas is depicted, wherein Milkha Singh pushes himself to the brink of absolute exhaustion. He subsequently enters the 1958 Asian Games with the hope of winning Gold for India. He then sees Abdul Khaliq, dubbed the \"Fastest Man of Asia\". After Abdul wins his race, Milkha Singh approaches him to congratulate the victor. However, the Pakistani coach and his athlete shun and disrespect him. But in the 200m, he defeats Khaliq by a considerable margin. Moving to the Commonwealth Games, he wins another Gold in the 400m and is named \"The King of England\" by various newspapers. After celebrating his victory along with his teammates in the army, he burns the paper on which the time of 45.9 seconds was written, indicating that he was ready to break the world record of 400m. He finally achieves his life-long dream by breaking the 400m world record.\nInvited by the prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, to lead the Indian team in Pakistan for a friendly race with Abdul Khaliq, Singh adamantly refuses to go due to the trauma of having to flee his home in the newly formed Pakistan as a child. The prime minister learns of Singh's opposition but ultimately convinces him to go. Arriving in Pakistan, Singh misses the press conference and goes to his village where, in a flashback, it is shown how his parents were murdered and the last words of his father were \"Bhaag Milkha Bhaag!\". He starts crying and is comforted by a boy who turns out to be the son of his childhood friend, Sampreet. He then meets Sampreet, who evidently survived the chaos of partition.\nIn the games, initially, Khaliq is winning, but Singh takes the lead after overtaking opponents one by one. Impressed how easily Singh passed the Pakistani athlete and won by a humongous margin, the president of Pakistan, General Ayub Khan, gives him the title of \"The Flying Sikh\". Jawaharlal Nehru declares a day in the name of Milkha as a national holiday as requested by Singh himself.

He tells her that she can no longer reveal to anyone that she is a Jew, and he tells her that her new name will be Esther. He also says that their being related must also be kept a secret, because his dream foretold of terrible things to come.\nApproximately 20 years later, we see Esther as an adult in the Persian capital. There is an air of great excitement, as King Xerxes is passing through the marketplace, en route to the feast he is hosting in his palace. Esther goes to speak with Mordecai, who is also getting ready for the feast. She tells him that she's envious of Xerxes, not because he's rich and powerful, but because he's married. Mordecai assures her that her time will come, when God decides it the appropriate time. While at the feast, Haman, one of the kings advisers displays anger that Mordecai is there, saying that it would give him great pleasure to see all the Jews eradicated. During the feast, the attendees notice that Queen Vashti is not present. Xerxes' commander, Sardar, reports this to him, and he has Vashti summoned. However, she refuses to come, saying that she is too busy to come and dance for him, and tells Sardar that his army can dance for the king. She says that even if the king himself would summon her, she would not come. Xerxes does not allow this impertinence to stand, and has Vashti banished from the palace, and nullifies his marriage with her.\nJudith, a friend of Esther, relates the news to her. Esther replies that if she were summoned to dance, she wouldn't come either. Haman, seeing an opportunity to become closer with the king, devises a plot in which his eunuch, Gasparif will speak up at the kings meeting, and suggest his daughter, Zara, to be the next queen. In a conversation with Mordecai, Esther expresses that she would have acted the same way that Vashti did, reminding him that even if the king commanded them to break the sabbath, they would disobey him. At the meeting, Gasparif suggests Haman's daughter to be the future queen. Mordecai then speaks up, and says that he has a worthy candidate as well. The king then decrees that there will be a contest to see who will be the next queen. Haman, in a private meeting with Gasparif declares outrage over the kings decision, and tells him that he will pay dearly for causing this situation.\nLater that night, Mordecai tells Esther that she has been suggested as a possible future bride for Xerxes. Esther is initially hesitant, but Mordecai warns her that if Haman's daughter were to become queen, it would be a travesty for the Jewish people. Haman returns to his home, and speaks furiously to his wife, Zaresh, saying that Mordecai will ruin his plans. His wife assures him that despite their daughter's homely appearance, she will make her presentable to the king.\nEsther beseeches God, saying that she has a great challenge ahead of her, and begs Him to give her answers. The voice of God is heard, and He tells her that there will be a time for her to keep quiet, and also a time for her to speak out. At the same time, Haman sees his daughter, and expresses disgust at seeing her. Zaresh assures him that she will cover her face with a veil, to obscure it. The next day at the palace, the candidates are presented to the king. Xerxes has Esther and Zara sent to his private chamber, to await his decision. Xerxes tells Sardar that he will go to eavesdrop on their conversations, in order to figure out their true intentions. Esther inquires as to why Zara has her face covered, and she tells her that it is to hide her ugliness. Esther asks that she remove the veil, and tells Zara that she is beautiful, and that her parents have been lying to her. Zara admits that her father only wants her to be queen in order to control the king, and that she will be banished if she doesn't become queen. Esther assure her that she will have a place in the palace, as her lady-in-waiting. The next morning, the king announces his decision that Esther shall be the new queen, making his decision based on what he heard the previous night. Haman returns to his house in a fury, and tells Zaresh that he will wage a war against Mordecai and his people.\nEsther is summoned by Xerxes, and has her sit by his feet, explaining that since she's not of noble birth, she has to sit below him. Esther tells him that as the king, he is the one who makes the laws, and Xerxes comes to sit beside her to talk. Sardar is seen plotting with Xerxes' bodyguard, Teres, saying that they will assassinate Xerxes that night, saying that he is too incompetent to serve. Mordecai overhears their plot, and rushes to tell the king, who has just been pulled into a meeting with Haman. Haman complains to Xerxes that since his daughter wasn't made queen his honor has been diminished, and asks to be made prime minister. Xerxes acquiesces, but tells him that it is merely another title. Mordecai arrives immediately afterwards, and tells the king about the plot to end his life. Haman demands that Mordecai bow to him, as befitting his new title, but Mordecai refuses.\nHaman returns home enraged, and tells his wife that he will find a way to show the Jews as treasonous, and have them and Mordecai eradicated. Zaresh suggests that they have a gallows built, in order to hang Mordecai on it.\nHaman again calls Xerxes to another meeting, and says that there is a threat to his kingdom from within. He says that the Jews are plotting treason, and quotes Hebrew scriptures, which state that God is the true king of the Jews. Haman tells him that he has selected the 13th day of the 12th month to slaughter all the Jews, and Xerxes decrees that it shall be so. Judith goes to visit Esther, who asks why Mordecai isn't there. She tells here that Mordecai is at home, mourning because of the decree. Judith tells her that she must appear before the king, and beg him to reverse the decree. She initially is hesitant, but Judith says that Mordecai has said that there is a time to keep silent, and a time to speak, but if she is silent now, she and all the Jews will surely be killed. Esther tells Judith to ask all the Jews to fast on her behalf, for since the king did not summon her, she might be put to death upon her unannounced arrival.\nEsther appears before the king, and finds favor in his eyes. She requests that the king and Haman come to a feast that she will be preparing the next day. Haman returns to his home, giddy that all of his plans are going well, and that he is the only other person who is invited to Esther's feast. While at the feast, Xerxes says he will grant Esther any request, even up to half his kingdom. Esther beseeches the king, telling him that there is a great enemy in his palace, because Haman has ordered the slaughter of her and her people. Esther reminds him that Mordecai once saved the king's life, and Xerxes declares that there will be a trial held to verify whether Mordecai is innocent or not. At the trial, Xerxes again asks Haman to show his proof, and he does so willingly. Mordecai replies that God also appoints kings, and that to disobey the king would be to disobey God. Haman asks Mordecai whom he would obey in a situation where the word of God conflicted with the word of the king. Mordecai replies that long before Xerxes was even born, the Jews had worshiped the God of Israel. The people at the meeting are outraged, and call Mordecai a traitor. Esther then speaks up on behalf of Mordecai, reminding Xerxes that he once provided Mordecai with a royal horse and clothes for saving his life. She asks the same question to Xerxes that Haman asked to Mordecai, who declares that he would have the man follow his own conscience, for even a king can make a mistake.\nThe king absolves the Jews of all counts of treason, saying that none of them will be harmed. Xerxes then declares that Haman shall be hanged on a gallows, and Haman's eunuch tells the king that Haman has already constructed a gallows. Xerxes states that that day shall be a day of happiness and great joy for the Jews for all of history, and that the events shall be recorded in writing.

When the teacher asks Liesel to write her name on the chalkboard, she is only able to write three Xs, revealing to her classmates that she is unable to write. She is taunted by her schoolmates who chant \"dummkopf\" (\"dunce\") at her. One of the boys, Franz Deutscher, challenges her to read just one word to which Liesel responds by beating him up. She impresses Rudy, and they become fast friends.

When the bonfire ends and everyone leaves, Liesel is still there and she grabs a book that has been only singed. She is seen by Ilsa Hermann, wife of the Burgermeister (mayor). When Rosa asks Liesel to take the laundry to the mayor's spacious, gated house, she realizes that the woman who saw her taking the book is the mayor's wife. Instead, Ilsa takes her into their library and tells Liesel she can come by anytime and read as much as she'd like. One day Liesel is found reading by the mayor, who not only puts a stop to her visits but dismisses Rosa as their laundress.\nDuring Kristallnacht, Max Vandenburg and his mother, who are Jewish, are told by a friend that only one of them can escape, and Max's mother forces him to go. Max's father had saved Hans' life in World War I, and hence he goes to the Hubermanns' house, where Rosa and Hans give him shelter. Max initially stays in Liesel's room while recovering from his trip, and they begin to become friends over their mutual hatred of Hitler. World War II begins, initially making most of the children in Liesel's neighborhood very happy. Max is moved to the basement so that he can move around more, but it is cold and he becomes dangerously ill. Liesel helps him recover by reading to him at every spare moment books \"borrowed\" from the mayor's library.\nOne day while \"borrowing\" a book from the mayor's home, Liesel is followed by Rudy. He discovers the secret of Max, whose name he reads on a journal Max gave to Liesel for Christmas. Rudy guesses that her family is hiding someone, and he swears to never tell anyone. Franz overhears Rudy's last words and violently pushes Rudy to reveal the secret. Rudy throws the journal into the river to keep it from Franz. After Franz leaves, Rudy plunges into the icy river to rescue the journal, and Liesel realizes that she can truly trust him. Soon, a local party member comes by to check the Hubermanns' basement, and they have to hide Max.\nWhile working, Hans sees a neighbour and friend named Lehman being taken away by the police because he is a Jew. Hans tries to intervene, telling the officer that Lehman is a good man, but Hans's name is taken by the soldiers and he is thrown to the ground.

Hans then receives a telegram that he has been conscripted into the army and must leave immediately.\nOn the way home from school, Liesel believes she has seen Max in a line of Jews being forcibly marched through town, and she begins screaming his name, running through the line.

One night the city is bombed by accident, and the air raid sirens fail to go off. Hans, Rosa, Rudy's family and Franz are killed in the blast. Liesel is spared from the bombing because she fell asleep in the basement while writing in the journal given to her by Max. She sees her foster family on the ground, dead; she cries and hugs them. Soldiers bring Rudy out of his house alive, but he dies a few moments later after almost telling Liesel he loves her. Liesel begs him to wake up, and kisses him on the lips as a goodbye. Liesel passes out, and one of the soldiers carries her to a stretcher. When she wakes up, she sees a book among the rubble and picks it up. She then sees the mayor and Ilsa drive up.

After the fight moves to the rooftop of a skyscraper, Drifter disposes of his intended target and saves Mary from falling to her death.\nIn the bustling town of San Dalloosa, Drifter and Mary arrive at Daft Willy's Chop Shop and Bounty Supply, a converted jet fuselage from the Corporate Wars where bounty killers exchange the bodies of slain targets for cash.

Jack vows to stay.  Suddenly, out of the darkness, Drifter is approached by a skull-faced assassin who holds a knife to his throat.  This is a Gypsy.\nDrifter and Jack are tied to a pole in the middle of a rambunctious celebration at a Gypsy camp.  Heavy drinking, fire dancing and other revelry surround the two prisoners.  From the largest tent enters the Gypsy Queen, Mocha Sujata (Eve Jeffers).  Mocha interrogates Drifter, wanting to know the location of Nuri, a Gypsy girl who escaped their camp many years ago.  \u201cShe mentioned the name Drifter.\u201d  Mocha, not happy with Drifter's refusal to give up any information, orders another Gypsy to burn him with her fire wands.  Despite the extreme torture, Drifter keeps his mouth shut.  Mocha calls off the interrogation for the night, leaving the prisoners alone.  Drifter confesses to Jack that the Gypsies are looking for Mary.  Jack doesn't understand why Drifter would risk their lives for a woman who tried to kill them, but then realizes that Drifter must be in love with Mary.  Drifter explains how he first met Mary many years ago when she lived her life as a Gypsy named Nuri.  Nuri approached him while he was in the company of a prostitute Estelle (Mindy Robinson) and demanded he teach her how to be a bounty killer.  While training her, they fell in love.  But the relationship ended when Drifter suggested they get a place together and settle down.\nAt daybreak, the Gypsies are all passed out from a hard night of knocking back pots of roach liquor.  Drifter and Jack have cut themselves free from the pole.  They climb atop a Gypsy coach (an Airstream trailer pulled by three motorcycles) and make their escape from the camp.

A bazooka finishes them off and allows the guys to ride off into the desert.\nMary arrives at the Thirsty Beaver, the bounty killer training facility and tavern where she lived during her training with Drifter.  Inside she finds the Beaver's owner, Lucille (Beverly D\u2019Angelo).  Lucille helps Mary get cleaned up and back on the road with her old Gypsy bike.  She makes sure Mary leaves with her chest-plate armor, telling her \u201cSometimes it pays for a girl to be practical.\u201d\nJack and Drifter pull the Gypsy coach up to a small shack in the middle of what appears to be a junkyard.  Outside the shack is a Chevy Nova painted up in Pabst Blue Ribbon race car livery.  Drifter tells Jack they need the help of the car's driver, a coyote named Jimbo (Abraham Benrubi), who will help them get across the Badlands and over to the Council building.  Jimbo tells the guys there's too much risk and that he's not willing to do the job no matter what price they're willing to pay.  Drifter convinces Jimbo by offering him a six-pack of Pabst Blue Ribbon, Jimbo's favorite drink and a rarity in the post-apocalyptic world.\nMary is lost in the Badlands, a war-torn city engulfed by a violent nuclear storm.  She sees a beacon that leads her to Azimuth's map shop.  Inside she meets the mapmaker and pleads with him to help her find her way out of the Badlands and over to the Council building.  He refuses to help her until he looks up and realizes she's the famous Mary Death.  He then offers to help in exchange for an autograph.\nJimbo successfully makes his way through the Badlands in record time.  To celebrate, he cracks open a can of Pabst.  \u201cNow I can die a happy man.\u201d  Just then Jimbo is shot in the arm by an unseen assailant.  The car takes several more hits from a sniper in the hills while Drifter, Jack and Jimbo take cover.  Drifter soon realizes the shooter is Mary.  He convinces her to come down from the hill and talk it out.  Mary points a gun at Drifter and tells him he's a dead man.  Jack has had enough.  He loses it, exclaiming that he's sick of all the guns and the Badlands and Gypsies trying to eat them.  He tells Mary that Drifter was beaten to hell by the Gypsies but never gave her up because he loves her.  He also points out that Mary could have easily shot Drifter, but she didn't because she loves him.  Mary drops her gun and agrees to let them use her map to get to the Council.\nThe group arrives at the Council building and finds the village destroyed by an army of yellow-ties.  Inside the Council chamber are the slain bodies of the Council judges.  Drifter explains how he knew there must be something wrong.  He knew the Council personally.  In fact, he was offered a position to be the tenth judge but refused in order to become the first bounty killer.  Mary is distraught by the Council's death, but agrees they must go after those responsible\u2014Second Sun.

Catherine explains her plan to pin the death of the Council on Mary Death so Second Sun can step in and promise a better life to the survivors of the Thrice Burned Lands.  Just when we think all is lost both groups are attacked by Gypsies!  During the fight, Jimbo is shot again but saved by Jack who hides him in the trunk of the Nova.  Mary leaves Drifter to fight with Mocha.  Then Jack leaves Drifter to fight with Van.  Drifter is then knocked unconscious and taken aboard the Second Sun helicopter with Catherine.  They fly away as the battle rages on.  Mary kills Mocha, but is severely injured in the process.\nMary awakes in a Gypsy tent to find Jack at her bedside.  He tells her the Gypsies are now under her control because she killed their queen.  They make a plan to free Drifter from Second Sun with the help of Mary's new Gypsy army.\nInside Second Sun we find Drifter shaven and wearing a suit.  He's tied to a chair in a glass office.  Catherine enters and tells him she'd like to reinstate his position as CEO of Gorman Enterprises, now owned by Second Sun.  She thinks his \u201cDrifter\u201d celebrity will inspire market confidence.  \u201cRun this company with me, Francis.  It\u2019s the only thing you\u2019ve ever been good at.\u201d  Just then Mary and Jack burst into the office bullpen with their Gypsy army.  They knock Catherine unconscious and rescue Drifter.  Jack, now a quick and precise gun caddy, assists Drifter and Mary as they unleash their fury upon the employees of Second Sun.  Just as they're about to make their escape, Mary is shot down by Catherine.  Drifter kills Catherine and runs to Mary's lifeless body.  He then realizes Mary is wearing a chest-plate.  Jack and Drifter carry Mary to safety.\nMary and Drifter spend two weeks naked in each other's arms back at the Thirsty Beaver.  Jimbo gives Jack his last can of Pabst to thank him for saving him from the Gypsies.  Mary, now in a new black leather get-up, comes down the stairs and hops into her new cherry-topped death machine, a gift from Jack to make up for blowing up her old one.  She tells Jack she's off to do battle with another branch of Second Sun then hits the gas and takes off.  Drifter runs out, stabbed again in the spleen by Mary.

During the drill, the captain notices that the vessel is being followed by Somali pirates in two skiffs, and Phillips calls for help.

Phillips offers Muse the $30,000 in the ship's safe, but Muse's orders are to ransom the ship and crew in exchange for millions of dollars of insurance money from the shipping company. While they search the ship, Shane sees that the youngest pirate Bilal does not have sandals and tells the crew to line the engine room hallway with broken glass. Chief Engineer Mike Perry deactivates the power to the ship, plunging the lower decks into darkness. Bilal cuts his feet when they reach the engine room, and Muse continues to search alone. The crew members ambush Muse, holding him at knifepoint, and arrange to release him and the other pirates into a lifeboat.

Muse agrees to board Bainbridge, where he is told that his clan elders are arriving to negotiate Phillips's ransom. In the lifeboat, Phillips prepares a goodbye letter to his wife in case he is killed, while Najee decides to take full control. Najee spots Phillips writing the letter and snatches it. Phillips retaliates by beating Najee until Bilal subdues Phillips by striking him in the back with his AK-47.

As Najee prepares to shoot Phillips, Bainbridge's crew stops the tow, causing Elmi, Bilal, and Najee to lose balance.

This is refuted immediately with an interview with Clark's art manager, J.C. who states that he's not been able to get work out of Clark for months other than crude sketches of penises. J.C. reports that he supports the artist financially and expresses his frustration and that his plan is to feed Clark drugs so that he can control him and get him to produce. This is followed by the director of \"Clark: The Webseries,\" Daniel, who explains how difficult it was to film the webseries.\nThe next scene shows J.C. introducing Daniel to Clark, who is sitting naked in a bathtub with empty bottles of beer and alcohol. Clark is resistant and belittling to Daniel's intrusiveness, while Daniel is obviously uncomfortable with the scene, J.C. insists that filming Clark in his current state is \"where the real art is happening.\"  Clark begins to become agitated and has a rambling fit about his father. They move to another room where Clark is asked to explain his art but is shown that he can't, rambling incoherently and is interrupted by J.C. who gives him alcohol and oxycontin.

J.C. explains on camera that he wasn't sure what Daniel was doing with the silent film style with music from Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, claiming Daniel had become \"artsy-fartsy,\" a claim that Daniel responds by saying he had no choice but to make a silent episode because Clark wouldn't read any lines anymore or speak in English for days, we then see footage of Clark speaking gibberish. Clark is shown struggling with homelessness while J.C. realizes that managing a mime isn't going to be profitable, so he gives her a newspaper classified article implying she should get a job in the porn industry. J.C. goes to search for Clark and finds him 5 feet outside of his door, where Clark shows J.C. his new creation, penis sculptures made out of trash.\nAnother character, Tito, is introduced as J.C.'s drug dealer, who he calls to get \"fuel\" to keep Clark awake all night to produce art for an art show that is scheduled for the next day.

Pebbles brings Rozonda to meet Lisa, Tionne, and music producer Dallas Austin, who is Tionne's longtime friend. The girls become fast friends and at their audition, where they perform \"What About Your Friends\", L.A. gives them the green light to cut their first video and record. However, Pebbles points out a naming problem as she intended to call the group TLC after Tionne, Lisa, and Crystal; and Rozonda is rechristened \"Chilli\" for the group at Lisa's suggestion. Pebbles also envisions the girls wearing high-heels and skirts, but Tionne affirms their preference for baggy clothes and dancing, to which Pebbles concedes but warns the girls they have to work hard in order to succeed. After the audition, Chilli asks Tionne about Dallas, and she states that he is a player - a non-committal man who has flings with several women.\nPebbles takes the girls out to lunch to sign the contracts, telling them that they have a weekly stipend of $25.00 and will only get paid when they have sold records and tickets to shows. The girls are given studio sessions, where Pebbles forces the girls to do sections of their dance routines repeatedly to get them right. During the rehearsal, Pebbles notices Chilli seeing Dallas, who is producing some tracks for the album, and Lisa complains she is hungry whilst cursing. She pulls all the girls aside and tells them that they will not swear or be loose, which seems to offend them, but they get back to work. Pebbles later leaves the girls during a studio session to attend a meeting. She tells Dallas to keep the girls working, but instead, a fun food fight breaks out between the girls and Dallas. Dallas chases Chilli into one of the sound booths and proceeds to kiss her. After re-entering the studio, Pebbles sees the two lip-locked lovers and begins to reprimand the girls and Dallas for their behavior. After docking the girls two weeks' pay, she suspends Chilli from the group and insists on holding auditions to see if there is another singer who fits her vision, despite Tionne and Lisa both telling her that they want Chilli to stay.\nWhile Tionne and Lisa sit through a day of bad auditions, an upset Chilli is with Dallas, who comforts her by kissing her, which leads to them having sex. After Pebbles decides to let Chilli stay in the group, Lisa and Tionne call Chilli to tell her the news. Right after Chilli gets that call, she looks down at a positive pregnancy test that she has just taken. She tells Dallas that she is uncertain what to do, despite her desire to be a mother, and Dallas says that he will support her in whatever decision she makes. Chilli decides to get an abortion in order to save her fragile career. Tionne and Lisa come to visit Chilli after the operation to cheer her up. After Chilli has recovered, they are seen working on their first music video for their song \"Ain't 2 Proud 2 Beg\" from their debut album, Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip. During the video shoot, Chilli begins to suspect that Dallas is cheating on her when she sees him talking to another girl. Later in a car, Lisa proposes that they do a video and an album with a futuristic theme, but Tionne says that they should wait until they get recognized. The girls are then ecstatic when they hear \"What About Your Friends\" on the radio for the first time.\nThe girls begin their first nationwide tour as an opening act for MC Hammer in 1992, and their first concert is met with rousing acclaim from the stadium audience. Midway through the successful tour, during which their album and singles also sell well, the girls learn that they will only get paid once the label is reimbursed for the costs spent on them, and ask Pebbles if they can review their initial contracts. A hurt Pebbles, who thinks that the girls do not trust her, storms out, so they decide to wait before pursuing the matter any further. Backstage following a concert, Chilli eyes Dallas talking to yet another girl, arousing her suspicions, and Tionne collapses on the floor and is taken to the hospital. A doctor informs Lisa, Chilli, and Pebbles that Tionne's collapse was due to a crisis from her sickle cell anemia, a fact previously unknown to them, and she needs two weeks to recover, resulting in several canceled shows. Tionne's mother complains to the doctor about not being given reassurance on the ongoing prognosis, but Tionne says that as long as she is living her childhood dream of performing in front of thousands of people, she will be okay.\nAfter the girls return home from their tour, they receive their platinum records for 1 million copies sold of their album, and they receive their brand new cars but still wonder where the rest of the money is. They go to their attorney so that they can go over their contracts, only to find out that their attorney works for Pebbles. The attorney tells them that L.A. has all their money, and they are only to get a stipend while the rest goes into an account so that they do not spend it all. They talk to L.A. and tell him that they do not want Pebbles on their second album because they want more artistic freedom. L.A. tells them that since Pebbles owns the trademarks and copyrights of the name TLC, they will either have to buy her out or change their name. They decide to buy her out in order to achieve the creative freedom that they need.\nIn 1993, the girls begin working on their second album CrazySexyCool, believing that their new creative freedom will come with more rights to their money. When Chilli refuses to go on a night out with Tionne and Lisa to get some rest at home, the two go clubbing at a nearby nightclub. However, Lisa gets drunk and dances on top of the bar, and she hits the bar owner in the head with a champagne bottle when he tries to get her to stop, causing her to be banned from the club. Tionne takes her to a hotel, where she has a nervous breakdown about people taking things away from her. The same night, Chilli confronts Dallas for throwing a party at her house and not inviting her, but he calms her down by kissing her. The following day, Chilli admits to her mother that she is uncertain, saying she should not be with Dallas, but she cannot let him go. During the recording of \"Diggin' on You\", Tionne notices Dallas talking to another woman and scolds him for his behavior while he is still dating Chilli, who walks in, witnesses the confrontation, and sees the woman. During a night of clubbing with her friend, Lisa complains about a man watching her from afar. Her friend says that the man is Andre Rison, a wide receiver for the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. Andre walks up to Lisa, proclaiming that he is her biggest fan, and requests that she honor him with a dance, to which Lisa obliges. Later, as Lisa and her friend are leaving the club, Andre picks a reluctant Lisa up and carries her in his arms, and persuades her to come home with him. As they arrive at his house, Lisa asks him why there is no furniture inside; he says he was waiting for her, and they kiss passionately.\nIn 1994, Lisa moves in with Andre, and Chilli is horrified when another woman announces that she is pregnant with Dallas' child, so she pours her heartbreak into the recording of \"Creep\". Later that night, Lisa comes home and finds Andre cheating on her with another woman; she slams the woman against the wall, slaps him, and storms out. On June 8, 1994, Dallas arrives at Chilli's house to apologize to her, and they have sex. At the same time, Lisa and her friend notice newly-bought tennis shoes on her and Andre's bed. Realizing that Andre did not buy her any, she throws them in a bathtub and sets fire to them to get back at Andre. However, the fire quickly spreads and his entire house is burnt down, which makes the news. Lisa flees, and Tionne and Chilli find her in a forest, coming to terms with all that she has been through. Eventually, Lisa turns herself in to the police and is charged for first-degree arson and sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine. She spends time in rehab, and is only released during her stay for two recording sessions with Tionne and Chilli, during which she contributes an introspective rap verse to what will become the group's biggest hit, \"Waterfalls\", after seeing a rainbow on the way to the studio. During the video shoot for \"Creep\", Lisa complains to Tionne that no-one ever wants to do her futuristic idea and threatens to wear tape on her mouth, and Lisa and Chilli complain that they spoke with L.A. who has denied having control of their money and is urging them to speak to Clive Davis about the money. Tionne then urges them not to fixate on it, as she believes that getting rid of Pebbles is supposed to fix their problems in the first place.\nIn 1995, after receiving awards and other acknowledgements, they still do not see any money come in. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, they announce that they are broke because of greedy people at their record company. The film flashes back to 1995, where they complain to each other about only receiving $50,000 a year, whereas most people make more money than they do. So the girls band a group together to go storm the record label's building to speak with Clive, who is in the middle of a meeting with Sean Combs. Clive tells the girls that they will get the attorneys and the accountants in a meeting and see what the record label owes them. They are all cut small checks of $15,000, and Lisa reveals in an on-air radio interview that due to an unfair contract, the group owes $200,000 that they lack in order to pay back managers, lawyers, and damages that Pebbles is suing them for. The group then file for bankruptcy and find a new manager, Bill Diggins, who gives them a worldwide headlining tour, the Budweiser Fest Tour, and an improved profit margin after they record their next album.\nIn late 1996, following the tour, Chilli announces to Tionne and Lisa that she is pregnant with Dallas' baby. By 1997, the girls are recording their third album, FanMail, dedicated to their fans whose letters they have received, and Chilli gives birth to her and Dallas' son, Tron. In 1998, during a sickle-cell scare in hospital after being comforted by her mother, Tionne writes a poem dealing with a woman's struggle with her self-image and unrealistic concepts of beauty portrayed in the media, which Dallas helps her adapt into \"Unpretty\", an empowering song for the group's female fan base to overcome feelings of physical inadequacy. During the recording of \"Unpretty\", Chilli breaks up with Dallas, saying that even though they have a son together, they are still very different people, and they are not right for each other.\nIn October 1999, the girls are about to go on tour to support FanMail. However, by this time, friction between the girls has increased because Lisa is complaining to her new boyfriend Larry about Tionne and Chilli rejecting her ideas and apparently plagiarizing them, and she has challenged Tionne and Chilli to make their own solo albums in a bid to see who is the most successful member of the group. Following a confrontation between Tionne and Bill and Lisa and Larry before a scheduled appearance on TRL, during which Tionne reveals that Larry is married, Bill urges Lisa to resolve her issues with Tionne and Chilli before going on tour, or they will all fall back into bankruptcy.\nIn February 2000, Bill offers the girls ten shows in Europe for their tour the following week with estimated earnings of $25,000,000, which Tionne and Chilli are ecstatic about, but Lisa declines, stating that she is going to Honduras that week for spiritual healing and she is beginning work on her debut solo album. Later, while Lisa is in Honduras, Tionne learns in a hospital that she is pregnant with her first child and chooses to keep the baby, despite the risks for her and the baby. Shortly after, Bill urges the girls to do another album and another tour, but Tionne, due to her pregnancy, and Lisa, awaiting the release of her album Supernova, are reluctant. Later, Lisa learns that her record company is not releasing Supernova in the U.S. due to poor sales and reception overseas, so she has a nervous breakdown at the 2000 Grammy Awards. After she admits to Tionne and Chilli that she feels that the numbers are not aligning properly, they comfort her and urge her to go back to Honduras for more spiritual healing and work on her second solo album in addition to working with them on their next album. Tionne then gives birth to her daughter, Chase.\nBy early 2002, the group is recording their fourth album, 3D, with Tionne and Chilli adjusting to life as mothers with growing children and Lisa contributing raps to some of the songs before heading to Honduras. Lisa promises to record more songs with them when she gets back from Honduras and vows that there will be no more friction between them. However, on April 25, 2002, a devastated Tionne and Chilli learn that Lisa has been killed on impact in a car accident in La Ceiba, Honduras, while filming her documentary. During a radio interview, Tionne and Chilli vow always to stay together despite Lisa's death, although they are uncertain about the group's fate.\nThe film ends ten years later, with Tionne and Chilli reuniting in the studio to begin recording their next album. The film then transitions into real-life studio footage of Tionne and Chilli recording \"Meant to Be\" in the studio with singer-songwriter Ne-Yo, as vigils in the career of TLC play during the song.", "tmdb_id": 229580}, "40277856": {"title": "Cristo Rey (film)", "plot": "Haitians and Dominicans are living in the Santo Domingo slums, where the two groups are at violent odds in a turbulent political and social climate.

After a great deal of confusion regarding the Croods' first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log so he can guide them somewhere safe. To appease Grug, Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves, though in reality he and the other Croods doubt the wisdom of this.\nDuring the journey, Guy is eventually trusted enough to be allowed out of the log. Grug attempts to steal a bird's egg for dinner, but catches a scorpion instead, and Guy teaches Eep how to lay a trap for the bird itself. Guy endears himself to most of the Croods by inventing rudimentary shoes for the family, and other \"ideas\" which help them along the way.

This in turn catches the attention of an investigatory television program, which sends several popular actresses to document the subsequent exorcism.\nThe actresses Yu Abiru, Mayuko Iwasa, and Mari Iriki are nervous and suspicious, they decide to go to the Kaneda's home to meet the mother, daughter, and the Buddhist priest Unsui. The priest explains that the energy around the house is impure, and performs several purification gestures, chants, and rituals. However, several strange incidents occur. After one such ritual, where he places a small dish of salt on the floor to help cleanse the area, the dish flies up into the air of its own accord and seemingly vanishes, leaving behind only the salt on the floor in a strange, spiral-like geometric pattern. Miho then displays a large piece of the shattered plate, which she says suddenly appeared in her hand. In another demonstration, a tennis ball rolls along it of its own accord. Unsui explains that this is the route of evil energy near the home. He instructs everyone not to eat any meat until after the house is fully exorcised, lest they attract negative spirits.\nLater, during the exorcism, it is revealed that one of the actresses sneakily ate a hamburger. The exorcism seems to fail, and the family dog is lured upstairs to Miho's bedroom, where Miho herself enters, in a feral trance, and eats the pet. Unsui is barely able to subdue her. The trio of actresses returned to the house, this time with Unsui and his superior, the more powerful Ryugen. They first show another dish of salt, which burns Miho's hands when she touches it. The priests explain that this is because an evil spirit is still attached to Miho. The actresses, however, all find the salt to be room-temperature, except Mari, who jokes that it is hot, only to be chided by the others for joking about something that is becoming more and more serious. Mari apologizes and becomes silent with guilt.

It approaches him, fills his lungs, and causes a seizure which ultimately kills the priest.\nMeanwhile, a new exorcist has joined the actresses, the eccentric and arrogant Neo, who self-styled after the main character from the Matrix. He is disappointed that Mari is still absent, as the only reason he is offering his assistance is that he wants to meet her after seeing her on television.

Nica hears Barb's scream and, having crawled up the stairs to warn everyone, attempts to make it to Barb, only to have Barb\u2019s disembodied eyeball thrown at her, followed by Barb\u2019s dead body. Chucky proceeds to torment Nica who finds Jill\u2019s body in her search for help. Nica wakes Ian up in a panic, alerting him of the deaths that have taken place, and they begin a search for Alice. Nica is left in the garage, once more warning Ian about Chucky before he continues searching for his daughter.\nChucky sneaks into the garage and starts the car, filling the garage with carbon monoxide which begins to choke Nica. She breaks the window with an axe to stop Chucky, but he swallows the keys and assumes a lifeless position as Ian rushes into the room. Ian disarms Nica, believing her to be responsible for the murders. As she falls faint due to a medical episode, she asks Ian to administer her medicine, but he refuses. Instead, restraining Nica until she comes back to, further accusing her of malfeasance.\nNica tries to explain that Chucky is alive, but Ian decides to review the footage from the nanny cam that he planted on Chucky earlier (to get evidence of Barb's sexual affair with Jill) and learns that Alice is locked in a closet and that Chucky truly is alive. Exposed, Chucky kills Ian by chopping off his lower jaw with a hatchet. Nica manages to break out of her restraints and avoids the hatchet by blocking it with her legs. The axe gets stuck, allows Nica to grab it and behead Chucky. As Nica wraps her wounded leg, Chucky reattaches his head and pushes Nica off the balcony onto the ground floor.\nNica lays unable to move and asks Chucky why he is murdering her family. He explains through flashbacks that as Charles Lee Ray, he was a friend of her family and obsessed with Sarah. Ray killed Nica's father and kidnapped Sarah while she was pregnant with Nica. While Sarah was captive, Charles brought dozens of flowers to her\u2014the same sort of flowers that Sarah compulsively painted. The cops find Ray\u2019s hiding spot and blaming the discovery on Sarah, stabs her in the stomach (resulting in Nica being born paraplegic) and escapes. Ray's escape from the police ultimately led to his death as a human, which is why he came back to Sarah for revenge. Nica, after stalling by taunting him about his inability to kill former target Andy Barclay, manages to retreat into her home elevator, manages to disarm Chucky after he briefly chases her through the house. Nica plunges the knife into Chucky\u2019s back. Chucky remains motionless for a while before springing back to life.\nOfficer Stanton, the same officer who found Father Frank's body, arrives at the house and sees Barb's body. Nica holds a bloody knife alone in the elevator while Chucky sits motionless in the corner of the room. \nIn her court hearing, Nica is found guilty of the murders and remanded to a mental asylum. Chucky is retained by Stanton after being used as an exhibit at her trial. Stanton, having been offered a fee to deliver Chucky to an unknown client, is ambushed and killed by Tiffany, when she springs from his back seat and slits his throat. A callback to her entrance into the franchise. Tiffany, still in Jennifer Tilly's body collects Chucky and goes to a packaging center to ship him off to a new victim. \nChucky arrives to the new home of Alice, who is now living with her paternal grandmother. She comes home from school to find Chucky waiting for her. He explains to Alice that her grandmother is busy in the basement and suggest that they play a game called \u201cHide the Soul\u201d. Chucky starts the voodoo chant to transfer his soul into Alice's body, while in the next room, her grandmother suddenly sits up, with a bag over her head. As she gasps for air, the screen goes black.\nIn a post-credits scene, Chucky, still in his doll body, is delivered to Andy, now an adult. When Andy turns his back to answer a phone call from his mother, Chucky cuts his way out of the package with a knife.

One day he notices Goldman talking about his son's wedding cards to people in the mosque where he prays and learns that his son is getting married and Goldman is breaking his security protocol to attend that. The same is confirmed by an ISI operative who works part-time as Goldman's bodyguard and is a neighbor and friend of Wali though he doesn't know the truth about Wali's connections to Indian Intelligence. Sensing a chance to nab Goldman alive, he informs Ashwini about the same who assembles a team quickly - Ex-Indian Army officer and mercenary, Rudra Pratap Singh, RAW's explosives expert, Zoya Rehman, and Aslam, a Mumbai thief and a murderer who was given a chance at freedom by participating in this mission.\nOn the day of the wedding, Wali sees his wife and son off at the airport, as they are to fly to London. Wali goes home and stages his family's death in the hopes that the ISI will not put them in harm's way and he can join them after the mission is accomplished. However, all flights to Europe are cancelled, stranding Wali's wife and son at the airport. When Wali's wife calls up Wali, his phone is switched off, and she learns her house is on fire. Disturbed and upset about not being able to locate Wali, she informs the airport security about the same. The airport security personnel runs a check to see and discovers that three bodies have been recovered. Suspicious at the coverup, he summons the ISI. The ISI, while questioning Nafisa and her son Kabir, notices Kabir holding pencils that belong to the same hotel where Goldman's son is about to get married. When asked, Kabir informs that the pencils were given to him by Wali a few days ago. Realizing that Wali is an operative out to get Goldman, ISI alerts their counterparts at the wedding. As a result, Wali, Rudra, Zoya, and Aslam's plan to capture Goldman is in jeopardy. Goldman escapes unscathed, and the four agents have to go into hiding. Embarrassed at the failure of their operation, the Indian government disavows the four agents; only Ashwini stands by them, but he is forced to resign. Aslam is captured and tortured by Goldman's nephew when he tries to escape through the Karachi docks. He is rescued by Rudra, who was trying to take revenge on Goldman's nephew for murdering Rudra's lover, Suraiya, a Pakistani prostitute. Upon hearing that Wali's wife has died and that his son is in ISI custody, the four agents decide to find a way to complete their mission, despite the government having abandoned them.\nThe ISI decides that Goldman is too much of a liability to continue protecting further, so they decide to kill him. Before they can, the four RAW agents take out the ISI and take Goldman hostage. Wali notifies Ashwini, who works to find them a safe route out of Pakistan. Goldman taunts Wali by telling him that his wife and son are actually still alive, and that he can arrange their reunion. Wali is torn between accepting Goldman's help and completing his mission, to the point where he shoots Rudra to take control of the group. Ashwini asks them to be at Checkpost 35 before 6 AM. At the same time, Wali arranges a meeting with ISI, proposing an exchange of Goldman for his wife and child. After tying Rudra up and disarming Zoya, Wali leaves with Goldman. Zoya then frees Rudra, and they follow Wali.\nWali drives to Checkpost 40 but is shot dead by Pakistani forces, who, unbeknownst to Wali, have poisoned and killed his wife and son. As Wali's car is examined, it is revealed that Wali did not actually bring Goldman with him; he had apparently anticipated the Pakistani betrayal, and had left Goldman in the car that Zoya and Rudra had taken. Through flashbacks, it is revealed that this was a plan hatched by Wali and Rudra in order to get Goldman to cooperate and give Rudra and Zoya time to get Goldman across the border to India. The Pakistani forces give Rudra and Zoya a chase and barely miss them before they bring Goldman over the border, where Ashwini is waiting. Once across, Goldman taunts them by saying how nothing has changed in India and he will be released soon and will be able to continue his criminal activities.

Ebru is a psychiatrist, K\u00fcbra's childhood friend from K\u0131bledere village. Ebru wants to observe K\u00fcbra and film the actions of so-called djinn exorcists in an attempt to prove whether djinns exist or not. Ebru and a djinn exorcist, Faruk, head to K\u00fcbra's village. They visit a cursed tree at the village entrance, hear stories about creepy events from K\u0131bledere's past and see a strange code, 7175, engraved in the tree.\nEven with proof, Ebru isn't convinced about the curse, not even after Faruk performs exorcism on K\u00fcbra in her bedroom, then performs it alone in a room with two mirrors which are supernaturally smashed and give them a sign towards a toilet outside the house, which makes Faruk suspect that black magic tools are hidden under the toilet, which he finds. Faruk tells about Dabbe to Ebru, claiming he doesn't know what it means, but it is an apocalypse mentioned in the Quran which will cover the whole world like a web. Faruk thinks it refers to the internet; the World Wide Web. With just one click, the most dangerous spells of black magic can be found and thus, internet is the main issue here.\nThe story continues with Faruk performing exorcism in an even bigger warehouse and warns the djinn, Sare, inside K\u00fcbra to leave otherwise he will kill it. The exorcism ends in success with the djinn violently killed by Faruk. \nEveryone assumes that K\u00fcbra is healed, however with a strange turn of events, she tries to kill her aunt that same night and runs out to the cursed tree. Sick of Faruk's supposed exploitations, Ebru leaves him at the tree and takes K\u00fcbra to a hospital for medical and psychological assistance.\nThe next morning, K\u00fcbra's injured aunt reveals to Faruk that K\u00fcbra's father died on the night of her birth, assumingly while being possessed by Sare. Faruk, still not satisfied about his discoveries, rings his friend outside town and asks him about the 7175 code. Meanwhile, Ebru returns and they both agree to visit \u0130lyas, a man who resides in an abandoned village and supposedly knows about Sare.\nThe two hunt the village for \u0130lyas\u2019 house all to no avail, when suddenly Faruk finds it at the very edge of the village. They are welcomed by \u0130lyas, who explains that this all is due to a curse placed on the village by K\u00fcbra and Ebru's father. Ebru is shocked on the revelation and tries to defend her deceased father when \u0130lyas elaborates that the two were poor, but greedy men who sought the help of djinns for finding treasures. On finding it, they killed the djinn and buried it but it came back and haunted K\u00fcbra. Ebru seemed to have been left alone because her family shifted to \u0130zmir. Faruk and Ebru ask how \u0130lyas knows all this on which he reveals his wife told him about this. They ask about where she is, and he tells she is right here, watching all of them. Revealing that his wife isn't human, but a djinn, with whom \u0130lyas even has a child. Frightened, \u0130lyas yells on them both to leave, saying the djinns of Sare's clan will try to harm him and his wife. He tells Faruk that the only way to lift the curse is to dig up Sare's dead body from under the cursed tree and bury it somewhere else in peace.\nFaruk and Ebru drive back and do as \u0130lyas had instructed and Faruk, after burying the vase with the supposed dead body of Sare, tells Ebru that her clan has decided to leave the village in peace. They return with the good news to K\u00fcbra's family and everyone is delighted. K\u00fcbra seems to have become healthy and normal and an obviously confused Ebru records all of her findings from the past days on camera, saying she still doesn't know whether to believe in all this or not.\nThat night, K\u00fcbra's mother suddenly tells Faruk that \u0130lyas called him for a very urgent matter. Ebru follows but is stopped by K\u00fcbra's mother, pleading for her to stay with K\u00fcbra. Ebru agrees but asks Faruk to take her camera and record his conversation with \u0130lyas. Ebru returns to her room and discovers a strange spell tucked inside her bra, while Faruk is stopped on his way by a call from his friend outside town. Faruk pulls over and the friend explains that 7175 is an ancient code originating from the Muslim tradition that believes Jesus wasn't killed but instead, saved by Allah and lives on to this day. The numbers 7175, in Arabic numerals are written as \u06f7\u06f1\u06f7\u06f0 which, if read in Latin, spell \u201cVIVO\u201d. The word means \u201cI am alive\u201d and is used by djinns to signal they aren't dead. Upon the shocking revelation, Faruk realises Sare wasn't killed by K\u00fcbra and Ebru's father, but buried alive, which means he repeated the same deed as the last time.\nHis thoughts are interrupted by a frightened, injured \u0130lyas banging on his car's window. Faruk hurries out and \u0130lyas yells at him why he did that to Sare, for his wife has been captured by Sare's clan in revenge. Ebru, on the other hand enters K\u00fcbra's room as she sees K\u00fcbra in black clothes and a completely disfigured face, possessed completely by Sare. She screams and tries to escape but is suddenly trapped and beaten by K\u00fcbra's mother and sister. Injured and unable to understand the situation, Ebru faints.\n\u0130lyas on the other side reveals to Faruk that it was all a trap set to lure Ebru back to this village. There is absolutely no way to get rid of Sare, however she could be passed from one body to another. Hence, K\u00fcbra's family planned to save her daughter and make Ebru suffer for her father's deeds. As \u0130lyas also, is captured by the djinns of Sare's clan, Faruk rushes back only to find the house empty and K\u00fcbra's aunt killed by her mother and sister. Panicking, he drives to the cursed tree, yelling Ebru's name when he is suddenly hit by someone and thrown into a well. He looks up to see the cunning faces of K\u00fcbra's mother and sister who throw heavy rocks on him. Unable to take the injuries, Faruk passes out. Ebru wakes up in a grave, seeing K\u00fcbra's mother and sister who tell her that they have suffered long enough and now it's Ebru's turn to have her soul devoured by Sare. An injured Ebru tries to plead and get up but is unable to do so. She is buried alive alongside several live snakes and after desperate cries for help, she starts to choke when suddenly the screen cuts to black, leaving her fate uncertain.\nIt is revealed in the credits that the film is based on a true story. Faruk was rescued by the villagers next morning, but the injuries to his head caused him amnesia. People tried to find Ebru and rescue her as well but she was never found. K\u00fcbra's family estate had been sold before Ebru and Faruk had arrived, hence after burying Ebru, the whole family escaped the village that night.

At first, he refuses to accept the diagnosis until he remembers having unprotected sex with a prostitute who was an intravenous drug user. Woodruff's family and friends ostracize him, mistakenly assuming he contracted AIDS from gay sex (he is straight). He is fired from his job and evicted from his home. His doctor, Eve Saks, tells him an antiretroviral drug called zidovudine (AZT)\u2014the only drug yet approved for testing in human clinical trials by the FDA\u2014is thought to prolong the life of AIDS patients. Saks informs him that half of the trial patients receive the drug and the other half a placebo since this is the only way to determine if the drug works.\nWoodroof bribes a hospital worker to get him AZT which, exacerbated by his cocaine use, causes his health to deteriorate. Recuperating in the hospital, he meets Rayon, a drug-addicted, HIV-positive trans woman to whom he is initially hostile. As his health worsens, he drives to a makeshift Mexican hospital to get more AZT. The facility is run by an American, Dr. Vass, whose medical license was revoked because his work with AIDS patients had violated US regulations. Vass warns Woodroof against AZT, telling him it is \"poisonous.\" Instead, he prescribes a cocktail of drugs and nutritional supplements centered on ddC and the protein peptide T, which are not yet approved in the US. Three months later, Woodroof finds his health much improved and realizes he could make money by importing the drugs and selling them to other HIV-positive patients. He is able to get the drugs over the border by masquerading as a priest and claiming they are for personal use. Saks starts to notice the adverse effects of AZT, but her supervisor, Dr. Sevard, tells her the trials cannot be discontinued.\nWoodroof starts selling the drugs in Dallas on the street, at gay nightclubs, and at discotheque bars. He reluctantly sets up a business with Rayon since she can bring in more customers. The pair establish the Dallas Buyers Club, charging $400 per month for membership. The club is extremely popular, and Woodroof gradually begins to respect Rayon as a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by an overdose of recently acquired interferon from Japan, Sevard learns of the club and its alternative drugs and is angry that they are interfering with his trial. The FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Saks agrees that there are benefits to clubs for HIV drugs but feels powerless to change anything. The process the FDA uses to research, test, and approve drugs is considered flawed and part of the problem for AIDS patients. At that time, the United States and its FDA were particularly conservative by international standards in testing and approving anti-AIDS drugs and hostile to imported drugs to the point they were made contraband. Saks and Woodroof begin a friendship.\nThe FDA gets a warrant to raid the buyers club but can do nothing but fine Woodroof. The FDA changes its regulations in 1987, making any unapproved drug illegal. With the club strapped for cash, Rayon begs her father for money and tells Woodroof that she has sold her life insurance policy to raise money. Woodroof travels to Mexico and gets more peptide T. Upon his return, Ron finds that Rayon has died in the hospital. Upset by Rayon's death, Saks is asked to resign when the hospital discovers she had been sending patients to the buyers club, but refuses, insisting that she will have to be fired instead.\nWoodroof shows more compassion towards gay, lesbian, and transgender members of the club, and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority becomes providing the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly challenging to acquire. Woodruff files a lawsuit against the FDA in late 1987, seeking the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not FDA-approved. The judge is sympathetic toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the power to do anything. The FDA later allows Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use.

Sammy suffers a fit while at the park, and Lacy is shocked when hundreds of birds suddenly crash into the house.\nOne night, Lacy is awakened by a sound from Sammy's room. When she checks on him, through the darkness she sees a figure standing over his bed. She turns on the light to find an empty room. Sammy is found walking away from the house but cannot remember leaving. Lacy, Daniel and Jesse each suffer catatonic episodes and regain consciousness with no memory of their experiences. Sammy's discovered to have marks on his body at a pool party while Jesse experiences an episode in the woods and is admitted to the hospital where geometric shapes are also discovered on his body, prompting the doctors to alert Child Protective Services.\nGreatly disturbed by the various phenomena afflicting the family and the house, Lacy begins to search online for answers and finds articles attributing some of what they have experienced to UFOs and reports of alien abduction. Daniel installs security cameras throughout the house. Daniel reviews the night's footage and frame-by-frame analysis reveals 3 dark figures standing over their beds as they slept. Now believing that there's an extraterrestrial force at work, Lacy and Daniel seek the help of a specialist, Edwin Pollard, who calls the beings \"the Greys.\"\nPollard informs them that many others have suffered the same fate as the Barretts, with most cases ending in a child abduction. Edwin warns the Barretts that the person who the Greys first show interest in is usually the one who is abducted and that they should be highly protective of Sammy, who he believes has been \"chosen.\" Daniel buys a shotgun while Lacy adopts an aggressive guard dog. The family spends July 4 boarding up the windows and front door of the house, then eat dinner, as Daniel flips the TV on to a program showing fireworks and playing patriotic music, while they reminisce about happier times.\nSuddenly, the TV fills with static, and the house lights begin to flicker, while the dog starts barking ferociously towards a boarded up window. Daniel sends Lacy and the boys upstairs to Jesse's room, as he arms himself with the shotgun. A bright light starts to shine outside of the window, towards Daniel. Upstairs, Lacy instructs both boys to not open the door under any circumstance. The power in the house goes off, as Lacy stands guard outside the bedroom door, armed with a kitchen knife. She hears the TV in her bedroom turn on, she walks towards it, unaware of a being standing directly behind her, and becomes trapped in the room. Daniel gets Jesse and Sammy into his and Lacy's room where they barricade themselves inside and huddle together on the bed. The TV begins to flicker again and the beings \u2013 now revealed to be Greys \u2013 materialize in the room.\nJesse blacks out and experiences a hallucination in which his father commits suicide alongside his mother's bloodied body. Seeing his brother, Jesse chases after Sammy before reawakening in the upstairs hallway of his house. The Greys appear in front of him, and he disappears with them in a flash of light, the rest of the family powerless to help. Three months later, Lacy and Daniel are suspects in Jesse's disappearance case and have moved into an apartment. Pollard balefully cuts out a newspaper article about Jesse's disappearance and hangs it on his wall with other pictures of missing children. As Lacy is going through old things, she finds pictures that Jesse drew as a child that shows the Greys surrounding him. She belatedly realizes that it was Jesse, not Sammy, in whom the Greys first showed interest, and that he was the one who had been chosen. Feedback then emanates from a nearby walkie-talkie as Lacy and Sammy both hear Jesse's faint voice calling Sammy's name.", "tmdb_id": 145135}, "40864846": {"title": "Dasavala", "plot": "Dasavala is about two tourist guides - Prem and Rangayana Raghu.

She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead.\nAnnie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister\u2014breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all the accompanying difficulties, soon follow. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne\u2019s closest friend Louise, and leaves her. Paul is soon diagnosed with cancer and expires shortly before she is diagnosed with a second cancer.\nWhile Annie struggles, King is pursuing her belief that some forms of breast and ovarian cancer have a hereditary basis. While she captures headlines for her work applying DNA fingerprinting to help reunite \"the disappeared\" with their families in Argentina, her priority is to map the breast cancer gene. King focuses on collecting families with a particularly high incidence of breast cancer, suspecting that these cases are most likely to reveal any genetic predispositions. Advances in genetic mapping through the 1980s gradually allow her team to embark on studies to map the location of the BRCA1 gene. Finally, in 1990, King and her team find conclusive evidence linking DNA markers on chromosome 17 with an inherited flaw in a gene dubbed BRCA1. The work was presented at the American Society of Human Genetics conference in Cincinnati, and published in Science a short time later.Mary Claire King ended up on the cover of Time, and Anne Parker finally had the answer she herself had long sought. Anne Parker happily remarried, and a few years later contracts cancer for a third time. And survives again.

Basant realises he saw Vasant so when the father sees him he will know it is not the guy who donated blood. At the airport, Priya and Ajit are waiting for the flight but secretly Basnat sees them.

Still, Paganini cannot control his lust for gambling and begins to challenge even Urbani's ability to finance him. At one gambling house, he empties his pockets from his losses and then even wagers his violin for the table stakes in a card game. The proprietor offers him the option of simply playing something on the violin for the patrons of the club in order to cover the stakes of the bet, but Paganini refuses out of his own 'ethics' of \"not playing as anyone's slave\".

Saffet claims to be related to a Turkish star, Emel Say\u0131n and can get her for the wedding entertainment, but she ignores his calls; and \u00c7etin volunteers his old mother to make the dresses and food, but each assigned task by the four friends fall through one-by-one; including a scheme that involves the village conman, Y\u0131lmaz, making fake currency. \nHowever, Ismail's wife, Hatice and the other women of the village all come together after the friends realize that they need help. Hatice also persuades Ismail to invite his estranged older brother to the wedding, despite having a falling out with each other. The preparations for the wedding starts at the center of the village, with everyone helping out as a community.\nOn the wedding day, Ismail requests a camel for the bride, Marika, to ride on, as he says it's part of the village tradition, so Y\u0131lmaz gets a camel somehow to the surprise of everyone. The camel takes off with the bride though, and gets accidentally knocked out when she falls off of it. \nThe men bring the unconscious Marika back to the wedding celebration, where they hide her away from the guests and the groom. The wedding ceremony is about to begin and Marika is still unconscious, so Y\u0131lmaz wears her gown and veil to pretend to be the bride, because he's the only one who fits in the dress.\nAll is going well until Ismail's brother dies after eating a piece of \u00c7etin's cake that he made. He gets carried into the same room that Marika is in, as does his deceased wife, who also drops dead after learning from Saffet that her husband just died. \u00c7etin wonders if his cake is poisonous because two people died after eating it. \nMarika's friend/bridesmaid calls her boyfriend, Victors, in Latvia to tell him everything worked out as planned, and it is revealed that Marika is actually engaged to someone else and eloped with Tarik instead. The real fiance and Marika's brothers goes to Sivas to bring Marika back.\nUpon finding out what happened, Y\u0131lmaz, Tar\u0131k and the bridesmaid escapes the wedding when the group shows up. Yilmaz reveals his identity, which causes the bridesmaid to start freaking out and Y\u0131lmaz knocks her unconscious; eventually the three of them are able to escape the group when \u00c7etin shows up and beats everyone up with his boxing skills.\nThey return to the celebration, now with two unconscious women and two dead bodies in a room, and Y\u0131lmaz in a wedding gown. Hatice shows up and deduces everything that has happened and tells everyone to handle it and not cause a scene in front of the guests.\nThe police arrive because of Y\u0131lmaz's fake currency, which Ismail had thrown out to the children during the wedding celebration. Everyone is taken in for questioning and Tar\u0131k reads out bits of his statements, which is the voice-over in the beginning of the movie.\nThe movie ends with Ismail saying goodbye to Tar\u0131k and handing him an envelope with money, telling him to have another wedding since the one Ismail gave him was such a disaster. He also gives him the key to his lime green car. They embrace each other and Tar\u0131k and his friends drive off.", "tmdb_id": 246524}, "49042507": {"title": "The Dune (film)", "plot": "A man without identity papers who doesn't speak a word is found on a beach of the Landes.

The boy pushes past him into the apartment and proceeds to chide him for allegedly inviting him, a minor, to his home for sex. A while later the door knocks again and the boy lets in two other Eastern European young men. Soon, to Daniel's horror, they are joined by the rest of the gang, including 'Boss', their Russian leader. Daniel stands by helplessly as the men mount a full-fledged invasion. As they disperse around his well-appointed apartment, helping themselves to its facilities, Boss taunts Daniel about his helplessness and repressed homosexuality, before suggesting to him that it was he who invited them over. He soon launches a raucous party in Daniel's living room, as the other young men strip the apartment of his belongings.\nLater in the evening the real Marek arrives, and joins in the dancing, seemingly unclouded by guilt. The next day, Daniel wakes to a trashed and emptied apartment.\nAs Daniel slowly begins refurbishing his home, and life seems to be returning to normal, Marek visits again. After Daniel yields to his repeated entreats for entry, and opens the door, the young man bluntly offers sex. Daniel agrees after some hesitation. They move to the bedroom, where Marek coldly lies on his side, as Daniel thrusts into him before quickly finishing. Daniel hands Marek a 50 euro note before he hurriedly leaves.\nTo his surprise, Marek returns a few days later. This time, after they undress, Daniel brings Marek to climax, before he silently climbs under the covers, and goes off to sleep. Daniel wakes to find Marek no longer beside him, but finds him in the kitchen, eating leftovers. Wordlessly, Daniel gathers items from the refrigerator, and they end up sharing a meal.\nOver the following weeks, Marek becomes a regular fixture in Daniel's life, and gradually learns to speak French. While grocery shopping one evening, Marek tells Daniel that he grew up in Chechnya, that both of his parents were casualties in the war, and reveals that his name is actually Rouslan. Back at the apartment, Rouslan tells Daniel that he trusts him, before accusing him of not caring enough to trust him in return. That night, Daniel refuses Rouslan's advances for the first time. When that makes him upset, he tells him that he's 'such a kid'.\nShortly after, Daniel suggests that Rouslan look for a job, saying that he can't live only on his 50 euros. He asks Rouslan to begin sleeping in a bed in the office, rather than in his own. Rouslan grudgingly complies but has a nightmare triggered by fireworks going off nearby. He wakes fearfully, and Daniel finds him dazed, in the living area. Rouslan breaks down, demanding to know why Daniel no longer wants him and afraid that he will make him leave. Daniel assures him that he will not, that he merely wants them to stop sleeping together. He reveals that he wants Rouslan to begin a new life, one that he can help establish. He invites Rouslan to move into his apartment and tells him to break ties with the gang.\nRouslan's passport (along with other gang member's papers) is held by Boss at a cheap, city-limits hotel that serves as the gang's base.

When the concierge is unable to confirm Rouslan's whereabouts, Daniel takes a room, at her suggestion, on the second floor, where the immigrants are housed. As she escorts him to the room, they both hear a faint groaning coming from the storage room. Although the concierge brushes this off at first, when Daniel calls down to the front desk shortly after, she explains that the immigrants are managed by Social Services and, as such, are out of her jurisdiction. As Daniel becomes increasingly concerned, she suggests that they call the police. Daniel explains that he must find another way that will not result in Rouslan being arrested and deported.\nDaniel ventures back into the hotel corridor and calls out to Rouslan at the door to the storage room. Rouslan, bound and gagged, responds with muffled cries. Realising he must act swiftly, Daniel moves his car into the underground parking lot, then uses the stair access to return to the front desk. With a sense of unspoken agreement, he and the concierge return to the second floor, where she uses her pass key to unlock the storage room. Having played her vital role, the concierge quickly returns to her work, as Daniel moves Rouslan, still tied-up, to his hotel room before the gang members can discover them.\nWhen Boss discovers that someone has unlocked the storage room door and allowed Rouslan to escape, he accuses a junior hotel staff member, before punching him.

Over the course of 50 years, gifted children are trained by the International Fleet to become commanders of a new fleet for this counterattack.\nCadet Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin draws the attention of Colonel Hyrum Graff and Major Gwen Anderson because of his aptitude in simulated space combat and is recruited into Battle School.\nGraff brings Ender to Battle School and places Ender with other cadets his age, but treats him as extraordinary, thereby subjecting him to being ostracized by the others. The cadets are placed in squads and perform training games in a zero-gravity \"Battle Room\". Ender quickly adapts to the games, devising new strategies older students have not yet seen.\nGraff reassigns Ender to Salamander Army, led by Commander Bonzo Madrid. Bonzo, believing that Ender is inept and a liability, prevents him from training with the rest of the squad. Another cadet, Petra Arkanian, takes Ender under her wing and trains him privately.  In the next match, Bonzo benches Ender while the rest of the Salamander Army fights another team. However, seeing the team losing and Petra in trouble, Ender comes to her aid and helps Salamander Army win.\nMeanwhile, Ender plays a computerized \"mind game\" set in a fantasy world, which presents difficult choices to the player. In one situation, Ender creates an outside the box solution to overcome a seemingly unsolvable problem. Later, he encounters a Formic in the game, and then simulated images involving his siblings. These are noted as unusual additions to the game, which is seemingly altered by Ender's interaction with the computer.\nGraff promotes Ender to lead his own squad, which is made up of students who have gained Ender's trust. They are put in increasingly difficult battles. In a surprise match against two other teams, including Bonzo's Salamander Army, Ender devises a novel strategy of sacrificing part of his team to achieve a goal, impressing Graff.\nBonzo attacks Ender in the bathroom after the match, but Ender fights back. Bonzo falls during the struggle and suffers a head injury. Distraught, Ender quits Battle School, but Graff has Ender's sister  Valentine convince him to continue.\nGraff takes Ender to humanity's forward base on a former Formic planet near their homeworld to meet with an elder Rackham.  Rackham explains that the Formics share a hive-mind mentality and how he exploited it to win the battle. Ender finds that his former squad members are also there to help him train in computerized simulations of large fleet combat; Rackham puts special emphasis on the fleet's Molecular Detachment (MD) Device that is capable of disintegrating matter. Ender's training is rigorous, and Anderson expresses concern over this, but Graff notes they have run out of time to replace Ender.\nEnder's final test is monitored by several fleet commanders. As the simulation starts, Ender finds his fleet over the Formic homeworld, vastly outnumbered. He orders most of his fleet to sacrifice themselves to protect the MD long enough to fire on the homeworld. The resulting chain reaction burns over the surface of the planet, killing the entire population. The simulation ends, and Ender believes the test is over. The commanders restart the video screens, showing that Ender's fleet actually participated in live missions and destroyed the Formic homeworld.  Realizing he became a murderer for destroying the planet as well as feeling guilt for the Formics, Ender storms off only to be tranquilized by staff.\nWhile asleep, Ender is awoken by the Formic Queen and is directed to a Formic structure nearby as being similar to the ruined castle from the game. The Queen acknowledges Ender's role in the genocide and moves to kill him, but when Ender shows remorse, she spares his life. It is determined that the Formic were only seeking a source of water and did not want conflict. The Queen gives Ender a Queen egg that she has been protecting.\nWith the war ended, Ender is promoted to admiral, given a small ship, and left to his own devices.

Although this violates his principles, Breslin agrees, allowing himself to be captured under the identity of a terrorist-for-hire. The plan goes awry when his captors remove a tracking microchip he had implanted in his arm and drug him, preventing his colleagues from knowing where he has been taken.\nBreslin wakes up inside the prison and realizes that the warden, Hobbes, is not the same warden who was supposed to release him in an emergency. He befriends another inmate, Emil Rottmayer, who claims to be a security expert for Victor Mannheim, a faceless Robin Hood-type figure who steals from the wealthy. In order to be intentionally subjected to solitary confinement, Breslin and Rottmayer stage a fight. Breslin quickly learns the cell in question is intended to disorient and dehydrate prisoners with high-powered lights. Realizing the cell floors have rivets of steel instead of more secure aluminum, Breslin has Rottmayer acquire a metal plate from Hobbes's office floor, before they and an inmate named Javed are again consigned to solitary cells.\nUsing the metal plate, Breslin focuses the reflection from the lights onto the steel rivets, heating them so that they loosen when the steel expands. Following a passageway below the floor, Breslin discovers he is aboard a massive prison ship somewhere in the middle of an ocean. Breslin and Rottmayer continue to study the complex and learn the guards' routines. However, Hobbes then reveals to Breslin that he is aware of his true identity, has assigned his head of security Drake to monitor him at all times, and will ensure Breslin spends the rest of his life in the prison. Breslin offers Hobbes information on Mannheim from Rottmayer in exchange for his release; Hobbes agrees.\nWhile Breslin feeds Hobbes false information about Mannheim, his colleagues, Abigail Ross and Hush, grow suspicious of Clark when Breslin's paycheck for the job is frozen.

From this, Breslin and Rottmayer deduce they are somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean near Morocco. Breslin convinces the prison physician, Dr. Kyrie (who is also a prisoner), to help him and Rottmayer escape by sending an email to Mannheim, and transmits a false tap code message from his cell, convincing Hobbes that a riot will occur in Cell Block C. However, Javed instigates another riot at Cell Block A, allowing him, Breslin, and Rottmayer to flee to the top deck while a lockdown is initiated. Breslin kills Drake when he tries to stop them, but Javed is gunned down by Hobbes and his men.

At the beginning of the movie, she is about to be released from a psychiatric hospital, where she has been for some time, due to very intense conditions of PTSD and agoraphobia. It is soon revealed that prior to her admittance to the hospital, she had fallen in love with Mario (Alfonso Herrera), an architect visiting her shop, who after a few, completely innocuous dates, suddenly appeared in a parking facility, looking very disturbed, and subsequently raped her violently, traumatizing her severely.\nWe see in flashbacks that she has had her special ability since early childhood, apparently inherited from her mother, who explains its nature to her \u2013 including the fact that \u201cNo one can see everything\u201d, i.e. that some things will remain hidden even from Marta. In the course of the movie, we learn that Marta's father died when she was very young \u2013 but that even with a photo of him, and his ghost (smiling lovingly at Marta) sitting nearby (and visible to Marta's mother), Marta cannot see him.\nFurther flashbacks, and press clippings, gradually reveal that she can see and communicate with ghosts, sometimes simply comforting them, sometimes helping police uncover what was actually murder.\nIn the present, her friend Monica (Johanna Murillo) helps Marta settle into a small apartment (in a building belonging to Monica's uncle), since Marta refuses to go home because Mario knows her address. Monica has brought some things from her home and her shop, but Marta instructs Monica to burn the clairvoyance paraphernalia, embittered that in spite of her gift, she never had an inkling about Mario's dark side. Monica explains that Mario is in prison, but Marta still feels very uneasy. Shortly afterwards, Marta is looking out her kitchen window, seeing her neighbor's kitchen window across a very small inner courtyard. Her neighbor, visited by a lesbian lover, ominously takes a kitchen knife, at the same time noticing Marta, who is obviously frightened by the incident. After a little while, the neighbor knocks on Marta's door, alternately saying that she just wants to talk and yelling, \u201cWhat did you see?!\u201d, meanwhile brandishing a knife.\nMarta gets glimpses of her new apartment showered in blood and of a presence, seemingly a woman who might have come to a violent end in that very apartment. Marta asks Monica to ask her uncle about it, and does some searching on the internet on her own, discovering that a woman seems to have been killed in the building, with Marta's frightening neighbor as a prime suspect, but never charged. Marta also uses the internet to check up on Mario, discovering to her horror that Mario was acquitted of the rape charges and is therefore on the loose. Later that evening, looking through her living-room window down in the street, she sees someone looking uncannily like Mario. Terrified, Marta calls the police, who tell her that they cannot help her. In a subsequent conversation, Monica admits to having lied about his imprisonment to Marta, in order to make her feel safe.\nMarta then covers her windows with newspaper pages and orders surveillance gear via the internet. She instructs the delivery man to leave the things at her door and barely manages to retrieve the material before her scary neighbor comes running out on their shared landing. Marta installs surveillance cameras in her home and cameras overlooking the street and the landing. The cameras capture another appearance in the street of Mario, another angry outburst from the neighbor, and many appearances inside the apartment of the ghost of the woman who has apparently been murdered in a horrible fashion. Marta also has these visions on her own, but in a phone conversation Monica reports back from her uncle that Marta's apartment has been empty for months, and that no one has ever been murdered there.\nSuddenly, while Marta is standing in her bathroom, she is attacked by Mario who stabs her with a pair of scissors while trying to rape her once more. Badly wounded she fights him off momentarily, slowly dragging herself from room to room, trying to reach the landing. Every instant is identical to her visions, and she realizes that her visions were not visitations from a ghost in the past, but her gift trying to warn her about her own imminent future.

The story then moves to a press conference with reporters asking questions about the massacre to the lead Detective Burquez, who states that the police are looking into the matter. After the conference, a disheveled Detective Reese asks to be put on the case, to which Detective Burquez assents.\nThey move to a situation room with a TV and multiple computers going over information from the case. Here we learn that there were four video cameras found at the crime scene and two survivors. They load up the first video camera and begin to watch.\nWe see a woman practicing lines for a play, then the video jumps to a man playing guitar and a surprise party for the woman celebrating getting a part in a play. This is Leann, and her friend Rachel is behind the camera.\nThe video shows Leann and her boyfriend Tyler at Leann's play, where he proposes; she declines and he walks off stage angry. The video shows the girls making a video to Tyler to apologize for the proposal and to continue with a trip that was previously planned. The three are shown getting onto a shuttle bus heading to Las Vegas, driven by Ben. Along the way we see people being picked up and we meet Vicki, a dancer, and Steven, a 16-year-old runaway.\nWhile watching the video the detectives notice another person on the bus, a woman. Zooming in, they notice that she is carrying a military duffle bag full of money. Focusing on the bag, they get the name Fleishman.\nWhile en route to Las Vegas, some of the passengers notice that they're not on any main roads, but dirt roads. Rachel is asking where they are going when the bus hits something and flips; they find that what they hit was barbed wire. Ben mentions he saw a truck repair shop a few miles back, and the group begin to walk back to the repair shop.\nAt the shop where Ben looks around for a phone, and locates a damaged service phone. Back with the group, he asks Rachel if her camera has a light, since the sun will be going down, and Vicki opens a gift box with a small hand held camera, also with a light. Ben tells the women to gather everyone together.\nAs Rachel goes looking for Leann in one of the buildings, the lights flicker on and Steven stumbles out of a room covered in blood. Chasing after him, the others find Steven and Rachel. Leann believes she sees someone and they all run into one of the buildings.\nThe video pauses and we watch as the detectives contemplate Steven as the first victim. We also find out about the mystery woman on the bus, Katrina Fleishman. Katrina is married to a military man hospitalized with posttraumatic stress disorder. Katrina withdrew her husband's savings worth $90,000 in cash and left town.\nThe detectives begin looking at camera number two, from Ben's perspective. He locates a fuse box and is able to get the electricity turned on; the camera shifts to another person in the group. A woman walks towards a bundle of debris, looking for a flare gun, but she is not able to reach it as she is grabbed from behind, and her face is smashed into the debris as she screams and fights; she has her arm burned off by a cutting torch and set on fire.\nDetective Reese sees a reflection in a pane of glass when the woman is grabbed. Using a computer to focus, a welding mask can be seen. Detective Burquez makes a connection to Katrina Fleishman's husband, a machinist in the military, and wants his picture publicised. Detective Reese continues to watch the remaining video.\nBack to camera one: Rachel is heard crying and everyone is frightened after Steven's death. Moving to one of the empty buildings they calm down, and discuss how to get out of the area.\nThe video jumps to Rachel and Ben going to the bus for tools with Leann and Tyler looking out. Ben looks for tools to help fix the phone they found earlier and finds a flare gun. They hear a noise outside and Ben gets out and is presumably murdered by the killer, who tries to get to Rachel with his welding tool, but she runs back to the repair shop.\nHere she learns from Vicki that Leann and Tyler went looking for her and have not returned. Katrina tells the other women \"He's here\" and Rachel uses her camera's night vision to look outside. They see a person in a welding mask, who shoots the flare gun at them. hitting Katrina in the stomach. All the women run to a nearby building, where they find Leann, she explains that Tyler was taken and she doesn't know what happened to him. Rachel uses her camera's night vision again and sees the flare gun out in the yard. Vicki decides to make a run for the gun, Leann gives Vicki her ring for luck and Vicki leaves to get the gun. They watch as Vicki goes towards the gun but once there they watch as the killer murders Vicki. Leann and Rachel huddle together after watching Vicki die when they hear someone outside the building and Ben stumbles in. Ben was left to die but was able to make it back to the repair shop with the wires needed to fix the phone.\n\nThe frame pauses and the technician tells Detective Reese he was able to find footage on Katrina's phone camera, Detective Burquez comes in with the news that Katrina's husband has been located in a Hollywood hotel and is going to be arrested. We then see what is on Katrina's camera.\nKatrina, looking in the camera,  begins talking about how the police will be scrambling over the scene to find out what is happening. She makes a dying request to be with the one she loves, Gerry Fleishman, her husband, and asks to be buried in the plot next to his. She goes over some of her husband's mental and physical disabilities after he came back from war, about celebrities being famous for no reason, and she speaks of God; the camera then stalls and flickers to a new image of the killer, we watch as Katrina's neck is sliced and she is killed while her camera records.\nThe detectives receive a call from a police officer in Hollywood, who explains to Detective Burquez that Gerald Fleishman has been dead for approximately a week, having shot himself and left only a note telling Katrina to withdraw their savings and go to Las Vegas to enjoy life. \nNow without a suspect, they attempt to figure out who the killer might be. \nOn Katrina's phone footage they read something the killer wrote on a mirror, \"Fear me like you fear God,\" and realize that the crime was planned and staged for them to figure out, and that the murderer had killed before. They begin to focus on Ben, the bus driver, since the trip was non-stop and Ben had mentioned a stop while driving down the gravel road. The detectives begin watching Rachel's video again.\nWe see Ben, Leann and Rachel move to another building, where Katrina is found dead. They move to a barn where Ben barricades the door, but while the women aren't looking, he disappears. Leann is grabbed and pulled from behind by someone unknown, and the camera goes dark as Rachel hides, turns the night vision on and sees Ben come towards her and fall. Taking the wire from him she attempts to re-connect the phone, but the killer appears with the welding torch. As she escapes from the barn it explodes, knocking her down; the killer catches her and sets her on fire with the cutting torch.\nThe video freezes, as  no more footage is left from this camera. Finally, Steven's cell phone camera shows the truck stopping.\nSteven begins talking to his mom about running away and scanning the scene in front of him, as he turns he sees Leann turn down  Tyler's proposal; as Steven becomes angry and walks out, the video flickers out.\nThe detectives turn to the technician, who tells them that the memory card in the phone is missing, Detective Reese notices the news on one of the screens and asks for the volume to be raised. The media have gotten the footage from the crime scene and released it to the public. Now they attempt to figure out how the footage was leaked and Burquez is called to her superior's office.\nOfficer Jenson comes in with the background requested on the bus driver Ben, whose real name is William Gentry. It shows he had been convicted of attempting to rob a bank in the past. Reese has an idea while looking at the case photos and leaves to speak with one of the survivors. \nWe watch through the interrogation room camera as Detective Reese begins speaking to Leann.\nDetective Reese begins to explain to Leann that Tyler is in the hospital and doctors are caring for him. They begin to discuss grief and Reese tells Leann his history with grief, how his daughter had been abducted and later found murdered. He explains that a serial killer kills for attention and sport; they like to play god. He begs Leann to try to remember the events from the crime. Reese begins to ask about Ben and Leann explains what happened just after Rachel, Ben and herself entered the barn to fix the damaged phone. She tells of being grabbed and later coming to and watching Rachel fight the killer, she was able to crawl out of the building before the explosion, and saw Steven choking on something and covered in his blood. Detective Reese realizes that the time line is mixed up, and tells Leann to go home and rest. \nAt the morgue, Reese asks about the autopsies on the bodies, and specifically about Steven. Steven was still alive before the building exploded and had been dragged to the building to be burned when it exploded. Leann had mentioned him choking on something, and Reese finds the missing memory card lodged in his throat.\nThe memory cards resolution is degraded but Reese clears the few frames they have and reveals Tyler wearing the welders mask. Detective Burquez releases his identity to the press as the killer.\nIn the office, Detective Reese continues to watch the video from Rachel's camera, here he notices glitches in the video. \nWhile Burquez is speaking at the conference, the reporters begin receiving messages and Burquez is told of a new development. Reese realizes that the videos have been edited for the police to view, with the edits being released to the media. The video now shows Rachel and Leann carefully planning the massacre and framing Tyler for everything. We watch as both women murder each person and stage fake evidence for what they call their \"first movie together\". The police realize they have been duped and manipulated. In the last scene both women come on screen and tell the camera and audience \"Remember the next time someone's filming you, you could be in the sequel.\"", "tmdb_id": 198210}, "37501742": {"title": "Evil Dead (2013 film)", "plot": "In 2008, a teenage girl runs through the woods until she is caught by two pursuing hillbillies.

He digs a grave and heads into the cellar to retrieve Mia, who attempts to drown him. Eric intervenes but is fatally stabbed. David sedates and buries Mia, and after hearing her heartbeat stop, quickly digs her up and attempts to use a homemade defibrillator to resuscitate her. After several seemingly failed attempts, David covers his sister and says she's \"at peace\". Returning to the cabin, he hears a voice behind him and finds Mia alive. David enters the cabin to retrieve his car keys, but Eric's possessed corpse stabs him. David locks Mia out to protect her and shoots a gasoline can, killing both him and Eric in the resulting blaze.\nWith David's death being the fifth claimed soul, blood begins to rain down from the sky and Mia is attacked by the Abomination in the form of her demonic doppelg\u00e4nger.

The gang grows progressively in stature until a girl falls into a coma and later dies after taking a \"pure\" ecstasy pill.\nEnraged, Tucker and Tate visit Steele and threaten him. To repay them, Steele tells them of a job in Amsterdam, which Nicholls, Tate, Rolfe and Steele successfully complete. Nicholls, however, is wracked with guilt after killing three men.  Meanwhile, Tate sees himself as \"unstoppable\" and cheats on his partner Karen, only for her to leave him for Steele. He also brutally assaults a pizza restaurant employee because the employee refuses to make a bespoke pizza for Tate's new partner, giving the police solid charges against a member for the first time. Despite this, Stone tells the employee to drop the charges as he knows a longer-term conviction is needed. Nevertheless, he comes under scrutiny from his superiors for this decision.\nThe now wealthy gang approach veteran criminal Billy Carmichael and, despite Tucker arguing with Carmichael, they secure a share of a lucrative shipment of guns and drugs going into Rettendon. They then recruit former associate of Carmichael, Ronnie Walsh, who is described as psychopathic and \"would eat your face for a fiver and a gram of coke\".  Nicholls, knowing the power and influence they would hold if the job was successful and fearing for his life, informs Steele of the shipment and Steele duly puts into motion a plan to kill Rolfe, Tucker and Tate.\nOne night, Tate, Tucker, Rolfe and Walsh drive to a farm track in Rettendon. On the way they snort cocaine and joke about why Walsh ended his association with Carmichael. They meet a gate, and Walsh exits the car to open it. As he approaches it, two masked gunmen approach the dealers' Range Rover and shoot dead Rolfe, Tucker and Tate but spare Walsh. Shortly afterwards Steele and Whomes arrive and find Rolfe, Tucker and Tate dead. The next morning, the bodies are found and Stone acknowledges that it was the result he wanted.\nSteele and Whomes return to Steele's home with Nicholls, who drove the shooters to the location. Steele is suspicious of Nicholls and persuades him to come in, only for Nicholls to call the police and report the crimes. Whomes discovers this and approaches Nicholls with a shotgun, but Nicholls surprises the two and escapes to a nearby field. Steele orders Whomes to return to the house and follows Nicholls to a farm, where he assures Nicholls \"you're dying today\". After a brief chase, Steele corners Nicholls and as he is about to kill him, the police arrive to apprehend him.

The family belongs to the Kaikadi community, an oppressed caste, and earns its living by doing menial jobs. Owing to the caste-ridden power structure of the village society, the boy's father has a fearful and submissive personality which is exploited by upper-caste villagers.\nJabya is disillusioned by the predicament of his family and shows interest in school where he has also fallen in one-sided love with a forward caste girl named Shalini (nickname: Shalu) (Rajeshwari Kharat) who he has never talked to but tries desperately to get her to notice him.\nThe plot opens with Jabya and his school friend Pirya (Suraj Pawar) armed with a slingshot trying to catch a bird (the Black Sparrow) in the wilderness.

Daniel begins to fear that Assange may be closer to a con man than a mentor. He also notices that Assange constantly gives different stories about why his hair is white. Assange at first tells Daniel that WikiLeaks has hundreds of workers, but Daniel later finds out that Daniel and Assange are the only members. \nMost importantly to Daniel, Assange frequently claims that protecting sources is the website's number one goal. However, Daniel begins to suspect that Assange only cares about protecting sources so people will come forward and that Assange does not actually care who gets hurt by the website, though Assange claims that the harm the website may cause is outweighed by good the leaks create. Daniel's girlfriend tells him that she believes in his cause, but that it's his job to prevent Assange from going too far.\nThe tensions come to a head when Bradley Manning (later known as Chelsea Manning) leaks hundreds of thousands of documents to WikiLeaks, including the \"Collateral Murder\" video of an airstrike in Baghdad, the Afghan and Iraq War Logs, and 250,000 US Diplomatic Cables. Assange wants to leak the documents immediately, but Daniel insists that they review the documents first. Later, several major newspapers agree to cooperate with WikiLeaks in releasing the documents while spinning WikiLeaks positively. However, both Daniel and the newspapers require the names in the documents be redacted both to protect sources and to assist in the media spin, to which Assange reluctantly agrees. \nDaniel realizes that Assange has no intention of following through on this promise and is grooming a right-hand man to replace Daniel. The newspapers release the redacted documents. The resulting media and public uproar forces informants to flee from their countries of residence and many U.S. diplomats to resign. Before Assange can go further, however, Daniel and the other members of the original WikiLeaks team delete the site and block Assange's access to the server.\nDaniel later talks with a reporter from The Guardian, and the two fear that giving Assange such a large platform was a mistake. The reporter tells Daniel that while Assange may be untrustworthy, he had done a good thing by uncovering secret dealing in the government and business world and attempting to protect sources. Daniel also reveals the real reason for Assange's hair colour\u2014that it had been a custom of the cult he had been part of in Australia\u2014and reports that he once accidentally discovered Assange dyeing it that colour.\nIt is revealed that WikiLeaks is continuing to leak information (with Assange implied to have either regained the site or rebuilt it), and the Manning documents were released with no redactions. Daniel has written a book on his involvement with the organization on which this film was based, and Assange has threatened to sue in retaliation. Assange is shown to be living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London to avoid arrest on an outstanding warrant for alleged sex crimes. In an interview, he denounces the two upcoming WikiLeaks films, stating that they will be factually inaccurate (having been partly based on Daniel's book).

Interviewed separately, Venkenheim's girlfriend Anne reveals that he's been suspended and scoffs at his theory. This view is shared by the film crew, though Vicky, the director, stands up for her friend. In their next interview with Venkenheim, he discusses how the Illuminati were trying to discover the secret of life when Johann secretly founded genetics. However, because Johann destroyed his notes, Venkenheim has no proof.\nVenkenheim and the film crew leave for Canada, stopping along the way to meet Clarence, who survived an encounter with the monster. Clarence identifies his attacker using a sketch of what Venkenheim claims is a nineteenth century murderer. Clarence, a meth dealer, reacts erratically to this claim. Shaken and scared, the crew quickly leaves and berates Venkenheim while picking up their guide, Karl. Citing his obsession, Anne breaks up with Venkenheim, but he remains undeterred despite Karl's reluctance. Along the way, Venkenheim reveals the monster is an experiment in longevity and argues that the monster can unlock many scientific mysteries. The group eventually abandons their car in favor of snowmobiles. Eric, the producer, shoots footage of a mysterious figure, while Venkenheim claims to feel the monster's presence. The group hears wolves howling, though Karl mocks their concerns.\nAt their destination, they find an old yurt and some bones, seemingly validating Venkenheim's theories. Luke, the camera man, briefly sees something moving in the distance. Venkenheim produces a map, theorizing the monster follows a large herd of caribou and kills in self-defense when he approaches civilization. The crew reacts with fear and anger, and Brian almost gets into a fight with Venkenheim; Vicky defuses the situation. Karl disputes the existence of a monster and instead suggests a bear, telling them a story about a friend who was terrorized by a polar bear. Karl concludes by warning them not to mess with the forces of nature. At night, they hear wolves howling again, but a monstrous growling cuts them off. Venkenheim thinks it's the monster, but Brian disagrees.\nIn the morning, they find a snowmobile vandalized and another stolen. Karl leaves to hunt down the vandal, despite Venkenheim's protests. Brian and Eric eventually discover Karl's body and freak out, insisting that they all leave immediately. Venkenheim refuses and argues that the creature killed Karl because he felt threatened. Luke leaves on the remaining snowmobile, seeking help. A day later, Vicky reports that Luke has not returned, a storm has arrived, and no help will come. They discuss the possibility that the monster is responsible for Luke's disappearance; Venkenheim suggests they appeal to the monster's humanity, as the monster is intelligent and seeking companionship, which Vicky doubts. At night, they hear the monster growling again, which Venkenheim interprets as a warning to leave \u2013 something they can't do.\nIn the morning, the group sets out on foot, following Luke's tracks, and finally spots his abandoned snowmobile.

After completing the objective, the squad receives a Soviet distress call that repeats without any response to their queries; at the same time, they lose radio contact with high command. Although the soldiers are skeptical of the presence of Soviet forces in the area, the team leader Novikov orders them to investigate. Meanwhile, Dmitri interviews the soldiers and documents the mission under orders to create a Soviet propaganda film featuring the heroic exploits of the Red Army.\nAs they draw closer to the designated coordinates, Dmitri takes an interest in, and films, several odd occurrences, such as unexplained dead Nazis, a burnt convent full of massacred nuns, and strange machinery. When the soldiers arrive at their destination, they find an abandoned church where they accidentally activate a 'zombot' - a reanimated corpse with mechanical implants fused onto its body. The zombot kills Novikov by disemboweling him before being killed by the rest of the men. Following this, Sergei takes charge as the new commander and though Vassili challenges his authority, the rest of the squad sides with Sergei.\nThe soldiers see an elderly caretaker enter the church and ambush him. He is interrogated by Dmitri, who asks for the location of the stranded Soviet soldiers they heard on the radio. The caretaker insists that the village is abandoned, with everyone killed or scared off by the creatures created by \"The Doctor\", but Vassili becomes impatient and cuts off his finger. Coerced by the torture, the caretaker agrees to lead them to the source of the Soviet distress call, but instead leads them into a zombot trap where Ivan is mortally wounded. The squad manages to escape, and back at the church they encounter a group of German survivors - Fritz, young boy Hans, and nurse Eva - that had been hiding from the zombots. Vassili suggests killing them, but Eva convinces the Russians to spare her and her fellow survivors by offering to help the wounded Ivan. When she is unable to save him and he dies of his injuries, Vassili attacks her and knocks her unconscious. Suddenly, Alexei is ambushed and killed by a zombot as more enter the church and close in on the group.\nThe survivors manage to escape into the church's catacombs, where Sergei discovers that Dmitri has been deceiving the squad by using a radio jammer to both block contact with high command and transmit the fake distress call they received. Dmitri reveals that he has a secret mission from the Soviet government to capture or kill the Nazi scientist who created the zombots, and to document their mission in case they cannot capture him. Furious that they were deceived and led unprepared into this mission, Sergei and Vassili threaten to kill Dmitri, but he asserts his authority by revealing that he is a Captain in the Red Army, outranking both of them, and threatens their families with retribution. As Dmitri leads the group deeper into the catacombs, they encounter increasingly bizarre aberrations and eventually find a chute which goes deeper into the factory. Sergei and Vassili force Hans to go down the chute to investigate and the boy is quickly killed by a zombot which then climbs up the chute and attacks the group; though they manage to destroy it, Fritz is killed in the struggle. Sergei, Vassili, and Sacha then stage a mutiny against Dmitri and throw him and his film equipment down the chute.\nUnable to climb back up, Dmitri goes deeper into the facility, eventually being discovered and chased by a multitude of zombots. While trying to escape, he encounters, and is knocked out by, Ivan who has been converted into a zombot. When Dmitri regains consciousness, he finds himself taken prisoner by the caretaker, who reveals himself to be Dr. Viktor Frankenstein, a deranged descendant of the original Victor Frankenstein, and creator of the zombots. The doctor gives Dmitri a tour of his facility, explaining how he created the zombots based on his grandfather's work, and how he went rogue from his Nazi superiors. Along the way, Dmitri sees Hans, converted into a zombot, and Sergei and Vassili, both captured, with the latter partially dismembered. Dmitri and Frankenstein then hear distant artillery fire, which Dmitri reveals is the approaching Red Army. Dmitri attempts to recruit Frankenstein on behalf of the Soviet government, but instead, he proposes an experiment that he believes will end the war: fusing together one half each of a Soviet and a Nazi brain. To this end, Frankenstein lobotomizes a kidnapped Nazi soldier, and then Sergei, who swears revenge on Dmitri before Frankenstein begins operating on him; during the surgery, Frankenstein is assisted by Eva, who has also been turned into a zombot. Frankenstein removes half of Sergei's brain and grafts the removed half of the Nazi soldier's brain into Sergei's head and then reanimates him with his generator. Frankenstein restrains Dmitri onto a table to begin experimenting on him, but the Red Army's artillery suddenly begins bombarding the factory. Frankenstein quickly gathers his documents and prepares to flee, but Sacha, who managed to evade capture, appears from behind and shoots him dead. Dmitri orders Sacha to free him, but Sacha ignores him, instead removing Frankenstein's head and taking it with him as proof that he succeeded in his mission, along with Dmitri's camera.

There, he encounters Yukari Yukino (\u96ea\u91ce \u767e\u9999\u91cc, Yukino Yukari), a 27-year-old woman who is skipping work. Yukari bids him farewell with a tanka (a form of Japanese poetry), leaving Takao puzzled as to its origin and meaning. The two continue to encounter each other and socialize in the park on rainy mornings, but never formally introduce themselves. Takao decides to make a pair of shoes in her size. With the end of the rainy season, he stops visiting the park and focuses on his work.\n\nFollowing summer break, Takao returns to school and spots Yukari, discovering that she is a literature teacher and had been the target of gossip and bullying. To avoid further confrontation, Yukari opted to avoid work and retreat to the park, hoping she would learn to overcome her fears. However, she quits her job and leaves the school. That afternoon, Takao meets Yukari at the park and greets her by reciting the 2,514th poem from the Man'y\u014dsh\u016b Japanese poetry collection, the correct response to her tanka, which he found in a classic Japanese literature textbook. After getting soaked by a sudden thunderstorm, both head to Yukari's apartment and spend the afternoon together. When Takao confesses his love, Yukari is moved, but reminds him that she is a teacher and that she is moving back to her hometown on Shikoku. After Takao excuses himself, Yukari realizes her mistake and runs after him. Still upset, Takao angrily takes back what he had said and criticizes her for being so secretive and never opening up to him. Yukari embraces him and the two cry while she explains that their time together in the park had saved her.\n\nThe credits show Takao barely passing his final exams, but still working towards his goals, while Yukari moves back to Shikoku and resumes her teaching career.

In the manga illustrated by Midori Motohashi, scenes were either added or slightly modified from the anime version. For example, after the conclusion of the rainy season, Takao was unable to visit the park during the only rainy morning that summer because he had scheduled to visit the footwear college he wanted to attend, disappointing Yukari who had hoped to see him. At the conclusion of the story, Yukari is seen wearing the shoes Takao had made for her. In the novel, Takao prepared to study abroad in Italy for his cobbling, and had a party with his family. Before he was in Italy, he exchanged letters with Yukari every month or so, and ended up leaving his email address in one of them.

Confronting a group of tin knights called Swordmen of the Wind (\u98a8\u306e\u5263\u58eb, Kaze no Kenshi) escorting a picture frame, Kouga obtains a sword when they are attacked by a formless monster, a Nanashi (\u30ca\u30ca\u30b7). Once the two surviving knights run off, Kouga sees a blue skinned girl emerging from the picture frame. The girl introduces herself as Meru and that she is like every resident in the Promised Land: A living object. Meru proceeds to explain that she was captured to be taken to Green Castle (\u7dd1\u30ce\u57ce, Midori no Shiro) as an offering to Queen Judam. Despite being warned of the danger, Kouga is guided to the Temple of Wisdom (\u77e5\u6075\u306e\u7960, Chie no Hokora) by Meru to find out where to find the Fang of Sorrow.\nOnce there, Kouga encounters a fading scarecrow-like entity that transforms into a human-like form when he unintentionally named him \"Kakashi\". After Kakashi takes his leave, learning that he is in the Hill of Nothingness (\u865a\u7a7a\u306e\u4e18, Kok\u016b no Oka) graveyard of those who lost their names and forms, Kouga and Meru are forced to run from the Nanashi reacting to the event.

Eventually, Zaruba remembers Kouga and revert to original form. Zaruba proceeds to reveal that Kouga's arrival has caused a time dilation and that he has served as the guardian for centuries before being reunited. Before anything else can be settled, Kouga calls out the mysterious gnome-like object that has been following them. Introducing himself as Kiria from the Land of Bliss (\u81f3\u798f\u306e\u5927\u5730, Shifuku no Daichi), he pleas Kouga for his help. Learning about the Maryu, a dark dragon that creates nothingness in its path and would emerge once the moon is completely black, Kouga and the others come to the suspected conclusion that the monster's fang is also the Fang of Sorrow. However, Kouge feels that finding his items should be his first priority before defeating the Maryu.\nOnce at the Land of Bliss, finding himself dancing with Meru, Kouga encounters Kakashi who provokes him into a duel before the harpy-like White Bird (\u767d\u30ce\u9ce5, Shiro no Tori) appears. Revealed to be Kouga's coat, the harpy flies off with Kouga in pursuit while Kakashi follows after him. However, the three are captured by the Green Castle with Kouga meeting Judam and voicing his opinions on her heartless behavior for what she considers ugly and lustful greed for beautiful things. By then, thanks to Kakashi's trusted canine companion Kuromaru steering their Halloween-ish Blue Palace (\u9752\u30ce\u9928, Ao no Yakata) house into the Green Castle, Kouga frees his coat and Kakashi so they can escape.

Seeing a ghost of Taiga appearing before him while regaining his coat, Kouga arrives to save Kakashi after his house is destroyed before making his way to the Green Castle to face Judam. Seeing her memory wiping against the human, Judam battles Kouga as she reveals that she will merge with the Maryu to enter the human world and destroy humanity for discarding her into the Promised Land. Kouga attempts to reason with Judam, but she refuses to listen as she uses the Maryu's scale transform into a small dragon. Despite its size, the Maryu quickly creates a giant mechanical construct around itself.\nDonning Garo, Kouga chases after the Maryu as it attempts to transverse into the human world with his friends helping out.

As Judam accepts Kouga's apology for humanity's discarding nature, the Maryuu dissolves with only a fang from its construct body remaining. Back in the Promised Land, Kouga finds Kakashi dying from his self sacrifices and learns that he was a training dummy Kouga sparred with as a child. After Kouga tells him that he was one of many who made him, Kakashi fades away with Kuromaru crying over his friend's departure. Once he arrives with Meru, revealed to be a pen in the human world, Kiria fades once his owner finds him alongside Kuromaru, who is a stuffed animal.\nDestroying the Maryu's fang to Meru and Zaruba's shock, Kouga explains that he himself is the actual Fang of Sorrow. Meru is confused and Kouga explains to her that Gajari was a product of the Makai Knights' imagination and that the whole quest was for Kouga to understand the symbiosis of the dreamers and the dream. Gajari appears and congratulates Kouga for reaching that conclusion before transforming into a portal to send Kouga back to his world.

Now raising their two children alone, he is also facing friction at work around funding and support. His work up to this point - centering on aspects of the Oseberg Ship - has exhausted all of the available physical evidence. A meeting with funders in the Viking Ship Museum in Oslo intended to increase support for ambitious fieldwork that isn't well substantiated in Finnmark ends badly. However his enthusiasm is undimmed, partially out of loyalty to his wife. He refers often to a notebook she kept, filled with maps, drawings and rune symbols related to the Norse culture.\nA breakthrough takes place when his co-worker Allan brings to him a stone tablet he found in Finnmark - the particular area in Northern Norway they've been focusing on. They determine that it holds a code, and identify an empty space in the center of the stone as exactly fitting a remnant from the ship. After they retrieve the ship remnant from the museum, they're able to break the code enough to translate most of the runic symbols on it and interpret it as a map of an island in a lake which may hold extensive relics and/or treasure. He decides to start his kids' (Ragnhild and Brage) summer vacation with them up in that area - doing on a smaller scale the work that they had been pursuing, with Allan and a small crew from the region.\nWhen Sigurd and Allan in Finnmark they meet up with Allan's field partner Elisabeth and hired guide Leif and set off hiking, eventually cutting an opening in a WWII-era fence erected by the Russians filled with signage warning against entering.  As they continue and Sigurd and Allan attempt to retrace the ancient journey, Leif brings them to the only lake for miles around, which surrounds a small island - identified as the \"Eye of Odin\". They are able to get across the water by means of a makeshift raft and oars, and they start to search for metal remnants. Exploring farther, Ragnhild finds a Russian barracks and Brage finds an immense cave.\nThe party all descends via ropes into the cave and easily find a Vikings helmet and other objects.  Brage finds an interesting ovoid object in the shallow water and stows it in his rucksack for later.  The group's excitement is cut short when Leif demands the pieces at gunpoint and leaves, stranding the rest of the group  in the cave.  As he is paddling back across the lake in the raft he gets taken from below by an unseen thing.  Elisabeth climbs up the cave wall just using the crevices in the rock, and re-establishes the ropes so the others can climb out. Ragnhild asks Sigurd about the notebook and what is going on, and Sigurd explains that they think the King's daughter \u00c5sa left the message on the stone about the events that took place here.\nWhile Elisabeth, Brage and Ragnhild sleep in the bunker she found, Sigurd and Allan decide not to give up, and to go back in the cave alone.  They discover mass graves - not only of ancient skeletons but also including a Russian soldier - and realize that the stone tablet was not in fact a map but a warning, written by \u00c5sa, who refused to take part in her father's attempt to kill the still-living creature. The creature appears out of the water - a huge pebble-skinned sea serpent - reminiscent of the dragon heads of Viking ships. Sigurd understands the last bits of the message that had not made sense before - it was this creature that was being described.\nMeanwhile, Brage's \"rock\" is shown to be a hatching egg, from which emerges a baby serpent.  Elisabeth manages to capture it in an old metal box and latch it in.  The infant animal's squeals transmit down the bunker's cable into the water and alert an adult serpent who hauls the bunker into the lake, trying to rescue the baby.  Elisabeth and the children barely escape with everyone's efforts, inadvertently keeping the box with the baby creature with them.\nAllan finds the box as he gathers tools for their escape from the island, figures out how momentous it would be to bring it back alive, and decides to try and secretly keep it while they escape. Elisabeth shoots a zipline across the water to the mainland, and they take turns crossing it. They barely escape another serpent attack by Allan shooting it in the eye.  They find that the serpents are not exclusively water bound as they continue to attack the group,   barely escaping back into the underground Russian bunker system. They find a ceiling door out and Allan is first through the door, but then demands that the box be handed up to him before he passes down the rope. Sigurd, horrified, tries to argue but is complying when the serpent bursts from the background and takes Allan, then crashes down into the bunker tunnels.  The children, who were farther from the ceiling opening, run out of sight, but Elisabeth and Sigurd are knocked out cold.\nAs the serpent eventually corners Sigurd's children, he comes to and realizes that returning the baby serpent will end the danger.  The sound of the baby's squeals distracts the adult serpent from the children and it accepts the infant serpent from Sigurd, slithering off without further harm.

Tim is a lifelong gay man who has never had sex with a woman, but is persuaded to lose his heterosexual virginity. The filmmakers aim to explore whether or not \"everyone is bisexual\", as is the case in some animal species, as well as what the boundaries of gay male sexuality are. Tim wants to find out if his sexual orientation is as fixed as he believes it to be or if he might not be as gay as he thinks.\nThe documentary opens with Nicolaas interviewing Tim about the issues of homosexuality and sex with women. Nicolaas questions Tim, asking him what it means to be \"gay\" and what Tim's own \"gayness\" entails. Nicolaas asks Tim if he sleeps with women or has in the past. Nicolaas encourages Tim to experiment with his sexuality. Nicolaas relates to Tim that, while he identifies as gay, sleeping with women was surprisingly enjoyable and that trying sex with women helped him realize he was not as exclusively gay as he believed himself to be. Nicolaas tells Tim he wants him to have sex with a woman, causing Tim to decline the suggestion and claim he would never sleep with a woman. Nicolaas insists that Tim should sleep with a woman, engaging in a debate with Tim about the merits of sex with women, with Tim eventually agreeing and coming to the conclusion that gay men having sex with women is the correct thing to do. Tim further adds that he has no reason not to try it and that sleeping with a woman would give him a better understanding of his own sexuality. Nicolaas relates that after trying so hard to be gay, including coming out to parents and society as well as being involved in the gay community, it can be very difficult for a gay man to \"go back\" and start sleeping with women again, but that the stigma shouldn't deter gay men from heterosexual experimentation.\nDuring the documentary, Tim and Nicolaas visit a sex coach to give them lessons on heterosexual intimacy and female sexuality and help prepare Tim. They also visit a bonobo habitat to learn about the bisexual behavior exhibited by bonobos. They visit with science journalist Asha ten Broeke, who offers her view that all human beings are bisexual. Tim arranges to meet a pornographic film actress in France who wants to have sex with an openly gay man. The porn actress, Judy Minx, tells Tim she has only had sex with straight men, but is enthusiastic about sex with a gay man in order to explore the boundaries of homosexuality and go beyond homosexuality's binary limitations. The film culminates with Tim losing his heterosexual virginity by having unsimulated sexual intercourse with Judy Minx, while Nicolaas films the sexual encounter. During their encounter, Tim tries vaginal sex, performs cunnilingus, and receives heterosexual fellatio for the first time. Afterwards, Tim high-fives Judy and gives the thumbs-up sign to Nicolaas, excited that he has just finished having his first straight sex. Nicolaas is smiling and asking how things went, while Tim explains to Nicolaas that the sex was excellent and he was surprised by how easy it was for him to perform. One month later Nicolaas interviewed Tim again, with Tim reiterating that he was glad he tried heterosexual sex and still considered it to have been a very enjoyable experience. However, Tim makes clear that his homosexuality has not been \"cured\" as he is still sexually and romantically attracted to men.\nIt was the goal of Tim and Nicolaas to reject the compartmentalization of human sexuality into the categories of \"gay\" or \"straight\" by exploring sexual fluidity and bi-curiosity. Tim believes the film was a success because he accomplished what he set out to do by answering whether a gay man could have satisfactory sex with a woman. The answer was \"yes\", because Tim was able to perform readily and enjoy the experience.

She quits her job to become a dance teacher, but is soon recruited again for a secret mission, and shipped off to a small remote island.\nOn the island she finds out the secret mission is an investigation into the alien spacecraft that was found orbiting Neptune. She discovers two aliens were found; one small, one larger and of a different species, with the smaller alien (which looks somewhat like an underdeveloped foetus with typical 'grey alien' large eyes) controlling the much larger and robust one through telepathy. The team has nicknamed the larger alien 'Spike' due to its spiky and ominous appearance. Later, in attempting to escape or explore her surroundings, Lisa has a surprise meeting with her old friend Manning whom she had thought was dead. After a discussion with Colonel Cencula (Lance Henriksen) it comes to light that Lisa's sister also worked on the alien investigation but was killed through unknown circumstances (later revealed to be due to a mistaken overdose of the serum they're trying to develop), and that Lisa was chosen because of the natural psychic/telepathic link she shared with her twin sister.\nAfter seeing the smaller alien, which is imprisoned in a glass chamber, and forming a chance telepathic connection with it, Lisa is tested for a mental connection with her twin sister by Dr. Bainbridge (Dave Vescio). During the investigation Lisa meets Plummer (Brian Krause) and builds a friendship with him which soon blossoms into romance.

Later, Murray observes the mayor surreptitiously leaving town with his family for a job in St. John's, as well.\nIn St. John's, Dr. Paul Lewis, a plastic surgeon, is flying home when a security agent finds cocaine in his luggage. The agent, the former mayor of Tickle Head, makes a deal with Dr. Lewis. In exchange for overlooking his possession of cocaine, Dr. Lewis agrees to live in Tickle Head for one month. Murray arranges for the \"seduction\" of Dr. Lewis to a long-term contract, lying to the townspeople this will guarantee the choice of Tickle Head as the location for the new factory. As part of the ruse, he convinces the townspeople to pretend to play cricket, the doctor's favourite sport, and also he taps the doctor's phone to learn more ways to entice him to stay.\nThe petrochemical company executive visits the town and tells Murray, who posing as the mayor, the rival town of St. Anne has made a more attractive offer, including a bribe. The executive demands a bribe of $100,000 before the plant will be awarded to Tickle Head, as well as, expressing concern about the population in Tickle Head is too small for a factory.\nMurray goes to bank to apply for a loan. Henry denies the loan. But, Murray presses the issue, and tells Henry that he could be easily be replaced by an ATM. Henry reconsiders the loan against bank instructions knowing that he will be fired.\nMeanwhile, the town's deception and favourable attention persuades Lewis to stay, helped by the discovery that his fianc\u00e9e, Helen, has been cheating on him with his best friend. But when he accepts the position in front of the whole town, in a speech praising their authenticity and integrity, Murray shamefully lies and tells him that another doctor has already accepted the position. Afterwards, Kathleen tells Dr. Lewis the truth, causing him to  confront Murray angrily just as the executive is signing the paperwork for the factory. After an impassioned speech by Murray, Dr. Lewis agrees to stay. The company agrees to build the factory.\nLater, the factory has opened, bringing dignity back to the town again. Murray reunites with his wife, and Henry has a new job, since he has been replaced with an ATM.

He then concedes that the South should have its own heir. A fight erupts as various masters attempt to challenge Gong, but they are deterred by Ma San. As the Southern masters deliberate on a representative, Gong Yutian's daughter Gong Er (Zhang Ziyi) arrives and tries to convince her father not to continue the fight, as she feels the Southern masters are unworthy. Meanwhile, the Southern masters decide on Ip Man to represent them, and Ip proceeds to be tested by three Southern masters before he challenges Gong Yutian.\nThe \"fight\" between Ip Man and Gong Yutian turns out to be an exchange of philosophical ideas using a crumbled flat-cake as a metaphor for Chinese unity. Gong proclaims that Ip has shown him the limits of his knowledge and declares Ip the winner. As Gong returns to the North, Gong Er sets out to regain her family's honor by challenging Ip Man. As they agree that \"Kung Fu is about precision,\" whoever breaks a piece of furniture during the fight will be the loser. An intense fight breaks out between Ip Man and Gong Er, which concludes with victory for her after Ip breaks a stairstep while saving her from falling. Ip and Gong Er part on friendly terms, with Ip saying he wants a rematch in the future. They keep in contact by exchanging letters, and Ip intends to bring his family with him to northern China. His plans are soon disrupted by the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.\nDuring the war, Ip Man and his family descend into poverty and he loses his two daughters to starvation. Meanwhile, in northern China, Ma San betrays China in favor of the puppet government in Manchuria and kills Gong Yutian as a hanjian. When Gong Er returns, Mr. Jiang (Shang Tie Long), the family servant, tells her Gong Yutian's final wish was for her to be happy and not to seek vengeance. Gong Er refuses to accept this, and instead makes a vow to Buddha to never teach, marry, or have children, devoting her life to vengeance against Ma San.\nIp Man moves to Hong Kong in 1950 in the hope of starting a career as a martial arts teacher. He spars with and defeats other martial artists, soundly earning a reputation. The Chinese government closes the border with Hong Kong in 1951 and Ip never sees his wife again. He meets Gong Er again on Chinese New Year's Eve 1950 and asks her for one more contest while implying that she should rebuild her martial art school. Gong Er refuses, stating that many martial arts have disappeared throughout the course of history, and that her family's would not be the only one. A flashback 10 years earlier shows a confrontation between Gong Er and Ma San at a train station on Chinese New Year's Eve 1940, in which Gong Er defeats Ma San using one of her father's special moves that Ma San had failed to learn. Gong Er loses her desire to use martial arts and moves to Hong Kong with Mr. Jiang to open a clinic.\nIn 1952, Ip Man and Gong Er meet each other for the last time. Gong confesses to Ip that she has harbored romantic feelings for him since their first fight. She dies in 1953, taking her father's secrets of the Baguazhang to the grave. A voice-over from Ip reveals that the fight with Ma San left Gong badly injured, and she turned to opium to help with the pain.

During a spacewalk, Mission Control in Houston warns Explorer's crew about a rapidly expanding cloud of space debris accidentally caused by the Russians having shot down a presumed defunct spy satellite (see Kessler syndrome) and orders the crew to return to Earth immediately. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter as more communication satellites are disabled by debris.\nDebris strikes the Explorer and Hubble, tearing Stone from the shuttle and leaving her tumbling through space. Kowalski, using a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), rescues Stone, and they return to the Explorer, discovering that the Shuttle has suffered catastrophic damage and the rest of the crew are dead. Stone and Kowalski decide to use the MMU to reach the International Space Station (ISS), which is in orbit about 1,450 km (900 mi) away, Kowalski estimating that they have 90 minutes before the debris field completes an orbit and threatens them again.\nOn their way to the ISS, the two discuss Stone's home life and her daughter, who died young in an accident. As they approach the station, they see that the ISS's crew has evacuated using one of its two Soyuz spacecraft, the remaining Soyuz spacecraft exhibiting damage with its parachute having been deployed in space rendering it unable to return to Earth. Kowalski suggests using it to travel to the nearby Tiangong space station, 100 km (60 mi) away, in order to board the Shenzhou spacecraft to return safely to Earth. Out of air and maneuvering fuel, the two try to grab onto the ISS; the duo's tether snags on one of the station's solar panels. Stone's leg gets entangled in the Soyuz's parachute cords and she grabs a strap on Kowalski's suit, but it soon becomes clear that the cords will not support them both.

Stone is pulled back towards the ISS, while Kowalski floats away.\nStone enters the space station via the airlock of the Pirs module. She cannot re-establish communication with Kowalski or Earth, and concludes that she is now the sole survivor. Inside the station, a fire breaks out, forcing her to rush to the Soyuz. As she maneuvers the Soyuz away from the ISS, the tangled parachute tethers snag, preventing the spacecraft from leaving; Stone performs a spacewalk to cut the cables, succeeding just as the debris field returns, destroying the station. Stone angles the Soyuz towards Tiangong, but soon discovers that the Soyuz's engine has no fuel.\nAfter an attempt at radio communication with an Inuit on Earth, Stone resigns herself to her fate and shuts down the cabin's oxygen supply to die by suicide. As she begins to lose consciousness, there is a knock on the window, and Kowalski enters the capsule. Scolding her for giving up, he tells her to rig the Soyuz's soft landing rockets to propel the capsule toward Tiangong, before himself disappearing. Realizing Kowalski's appearance was a hallucination, Stone regains the will to go on, restoring the spacecraft's oxygen flow and rigging the landing rockets to propel the capsule towards Tiangong.\nUnable to dock with Tiangong, Stone ejects herself from the Soyuz and uses a fire extinguisher as a makeshift thruster to travel to the rapidly deorbiting Tiangong.

Despite the appreciation and the many awards he received, Jep has not written other books, not only for his laziness but above all for a creative block from which he cannot escape. The purpose of his existence has been to become a \"socialite\", but not just any socialite, but \"the king of society\".\nJep is surrounded by several friends: Romano, a playwright who is perpetually on the leash of a young woman who exploits him; Lello, a mouthy and wealthy toy seller; Viola, a wealthy bourgeois and mother of a son with serious mental problems named Andrea who will commit suicide by crashing voluntarily with his car; Stefania, a self-centred radical chic writer; Dadina, the dwarf editor of the newspaper where Jep works.\nOne morning, he meets the husband of Elisa, a woman who has been Jep's first and probably only love: the man announces that Elisa has died, leaving behind only a diary in which the woman tells of her love for Jep; thus, her husband discovered that he had been a mere surrogate for 35 years, nothing more than \"a good companion\".

They rescue Vali, but Hagen and Jokul demand he be killed for his cowardice and treachery, forcing Steinar to kill Hagen by duel to protect his brother.\nNow down to four, they head into an eerie forest and are captured again, this time by a tribe who dwell deep within a nearby cave. Taken there, Jokul is killed and later served up as the tribe's banquet, Vali again switches sides, while Agnes is claimed by the tribal chief, Steinar's older brother Hakan, who the tribe worship as a god.\nDuring the tribal festivities, Steinar encounters his mother Astrid, whom he believed dead, and who is also deluded by Hakan's megalomania. Further shocking revelations are made as Steinar finally learns the truth behind Hakan's exile. To his disgust, his mother and brother openly share a passionate kiss, revealing their incestuous relationship.\nAfter Hakan kills Vali to further his dominance over the tribe, he and Steinar are lowered into a dark pit to fight to the death. Despite Astrid secretly handing Hakan a knife to win, Steinar emerges the victor. The tribe bow in submission while Astrid, in an attempt to kill Steinar, is thrown into the pit by him.\nSteinar later returns to Bagsecg's camp with Agnes, and presents Hakan's head to his father. Harold argues he was supposed to bring Hakan back alive. But Bagsecg responds \"He was sent to find a king\" seeing that Steinar is now ready to lead their people and gives him full command of the Nordic Army.\nSteinar then kills Harold for his treachery and weakness, much to Bagsecg's applause who can now rest easy knowing the kingdom is in good hands.

The scene shifts to her teacher from her current school, Lee Nan do (Jo Dae Hee), helping her pack her luggage as she is about to be transferred to another school in a different town. As they eat lunch he tells her that it was not her fault but to wait for the results of the trial before deciding what to do next and meanwhile not to answer any phone calls. Lee manages to make her school transition as smooth as possible despite it being mid semester. He then brings Gong Ju to the convenience store owned by his mother, Mrs. Cho, for possible boarding in her house. Initially the mother refuses but eventually allows her to stay.\nIn a flashback to the past, Gong Ju is working as a cashier at a convenience store when a friend/classmate and son of the store owner, Dong Yoon (Choi Yong Jun), walks in visibly beaten as he grabs some food and heads back out to see his friends. The next day at school she meets her friend Hwa Ok (Kim So Young) and they talk about the incident.\nOne day at school in the present, Gong Ju is walking down the hall and peers through a classroom window where a small group of girls are rehearsing an a cappella song. When the leader of the group, Eun Hee (Jung In Sung), sees her she quickly walks away. Gong Ju attends swimming lessons and meets Eun Hee who tries to befriend her after hearing her sing in the changing room. Eun Hee asks Gong Ju to join the a cappella group. Although Gong Ju is not interested, she asks Eun Hee for the loan of her phone to help with directions so she can find her mother. They take a bus and Gong Ju goes to her mother's work but ultimately, she is rejected and dismissed. Eun Hee overhears the conversation. Gong Ju confronts her and recalls her friend Hwa Ok. Afterwards, she angrily visits her mother's boyfriend's shop and forcefully kisses and bites him before running away.\nGong Ju stops by the empty music room at school and starts to sing where she is heard by Eun Hee and her friends. Slowly, she begins to open up to the girls and shares with them that her goal is to learn to swim at least 25 metres. Gong Ju's friends decide to post a video of her singing and details about her on the Internet so she can start a fan club, but upon hearing this Gong Ju becomes angry and demands that they remove the video immediately. Her friends are puzzled by her reaction and an argument ensues. \nShortly afterwards, a cluster of angry parents barge in and interrupt the class to harass Gong Ju for having put their sons in jail. Gong Ju runs away and hides in an empty room.\nAnother flashback is shown where Hwa Ok is being gang raped in Gong-Ju's house. Before that, Gong Ju arrives at her house where Dong Yoon, Hwa Ok and at least 15 guys are hanging out and drinking. Dong Yoon is shown being bullied by his friends. Although Gong Ju does not drink, Dong Yoon insists she drink a beer that, unbeknownst to her, has been drugged. Gong Ju takes the drink as Dong Yoon reassures her that the guys will leave if she does so. Under the influence of the drug, she is gang raped as well. The \u201cparty\u201d ends when Dong Yoon's father arrives and takes Dong Yoon, who was just in the midst of his turn of raping one of the girls, home; his father notices but ignores that the other girls is currently raped too.\nSoon afterwards, Hwa Ok commits suicide by jumping off a bridge. The scene returns to the present where Gong Ju is sitting with the principal as he advises her he will discuss the situation with the board, not having known about her past. Mrs. Cho's boyfriend doubts her innocence and urges her to kick Gong Ju out of the house but Gong Ju leaves willingly, after telling them Hwa Ok was pregnant but she did not do anything to help her.\nGong Ju's friends at school find out about the rape, they text her to ask where she is and to say that it is not her fault. Eun Hee and her friends are horrified after seeing the video of Hwa Ok being raped, but she does not immediately answer a call from Gong Ju. Meanwhile, Gong Ju is seen walking towards a bridge where she jumps into the water; an underwater shadow is then shown swimming away, swimming much more adroitly than she ever managed.

He tells them that a few weeks after their shenanigans in Las Vegas, Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist, and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to communicate with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that they could locate him and retrieve the gold.

Stu catches up to Chow and locks him in the trunk of Marshall's limousine. They take the gold and meet with Marshall, who releases Doug when they reveal they cannot secure the original half as Chow lost it all in Bangkok. Although Marshall had promised not to harm Chow, he shoots up the trunk of the car, presumably killing him.\nHowever, Alan had given Chow the means to escape from the trunk through a backseat compartment just moments earlier. Chow emerges from the limo and kills Marshall and his bodyguard, but spares Phil and Stu because Alan saved his life. He offers Alan a bar of gold as a gift, but Alan turns him down and ends their friendship because of Chow's unhealthy influence on the group. As Chow sadly watches them leave, they go to retrieve Phil's minivan from the pawnshop and Alan makes a date with Cassie.

Around thirty Earthling scientists are sent to the planet incognito, in order to observe the outcome of this society. However, they are barred from influencing the local civilization or interfering with the city's natural course. One of the Earthlings has been living on the planet for twenty years, in a large house filled with his multitudes of slaves and servants. Disguised as a Noble Don named Rumata of Estor, he has become known among some of the townspeople as the son of Goran (a local pagan god). In duels, Rumata does not kill enemies, but only cuts off their ears, as it is forbidden for him to kill. At night, he dreams of murder. He is tasked with saving the intellectuals of this society - bookworms and wisemen, who are constantly persecuted by the so-called Gray troops under the leadership of Don Reba, who has usurped power in the state.\nFrom Muga, his head slave, Rumata learns of a certain tobacco-grower from Tobacco Street who is supposedly one of the clever inhabitants of Arkanar. On rocky islets among the swamps that surround the city, Rumata hides Arkanarian scientists to safety. From time to time, other Earthlings also gather in these swamps, more and more alienated from each other, and constantly drunk (as is Rumata). A doctor named Budakh, who was supposed to be taken to shelter, had disappeared along with his escort.

After a drunken night, Rumata is suddenly arrested in the palace by Grays and taken to Don Reba for interrogation. Reba informs him that he has become the Master of the Order, a militant religious sect from across the country, and tries to find out if Rumata really is a God or not.

Pampa, trying to escape from the city, is killed by being shot from arrows. Afterwards, Rumata talks with Budakh, trying to figure out what the scientist would advise God on how to fix the state of affairs in the world of Arkanar.

Right then, soldiers of the Order burst into Rumata's house in search of heretics, guided by a certain crippled monk, in whose description it is easy to guess Arata. Furious at the murder of Ari, Rumata informs their leader, a former university student named Arima, that he will kill them all, and soon turns his threat into reality. He kills Arima first.

The real Arcadia ambushes the fleet, rams Isora's flagship, and Harlock takes the crew hostage.  Once at Earth and past the great illusion, the crew is horrified at Earth's fate.  Isora reveals Harlock's true plan: Harlock intends to destroy the current universe and rebirth a new one.\nShocked, Yama sides with Isora, and the Arcadia moves away from Earth, apparently of its own volition.  Yama helps Isora and his crew take over the Arcadia.  With the ship and crew imprisoned, Isora confronts Nami, who informed Yama of his tactical plans.  Nami realizes that she is the source of Isora's torment, not Yama.  Nami provokes Isora into causing her life support to fail.  As Nami dies, she admits to loving him and sacrificing herself to bring him peace.\nIsora lies about Nami's death.  Disbelieving Isora and haunted by Nami's death, Yama returns to Earth, where he finds a meadow of flowers.  Yama interrupts Harlock's public execution and releases the Arcadia's crew.  Yama says both he and Harlock were wrong, and he shows them a flower.  Overcome by the possibility of a peaceful \"starting over\", Harlock abandons his previous plans and decides to expose the Gaia Sanction.\nThe Arcadia evades the Gaia Fleet and destroys Earth's hologram emitters.  The exposed truth of Earth's condition destabilizes the Gaia Sanction, which depended on a quasi-religious veneration of Earth to legitimize their rule.  Desperate to contain the situation, the Gaia Sanction's leader decides to use a doomsday particle cannon to destroy the Arcadia.  Realizing Earth could be destroyed, too, Isora rams the Arcadia and pushes it away from Earth.  Both ships board each other, causing many casualties on both sides.\nYama confronts Isora.  Isora shoots at Yama's face, scarring him similarly to Harlock.  Harlock mortally wounds Isora, saving Yama.  When Isora warns them about the particle cannon, Harlock remarks that Isora was the only one to remain faithful to Earth.  Harlock again unleashes the Arcadia's dark matter.  With the Arcadia moved further from Earth and protected by a dark matter shield, both Earth and the Arcadia survive the cannon's blast.  As Isora dies, he explains that he saved Earth because he knew Nami and their mother loved flowers.\nAfter the Arcadia crash lands on Earth, Harlock sets the final detonator and says another Homecoming War is inevitable.  Believing Earth is a gift from Nami and Isora, Yama refuses to destroy it.  Liking his answer, Harlock gives the detonator to Yama and says the universe needs the myth of Captain Harlock.  As the Gaia Sanction fleet confronts the Arcadia, the crew wakes up, seemingly healed by the dark matter, and the ship escapes, now commanded by Yama who then becomes the new Captain Harlock.", "tmdb_id": 192577}, "38319541": {"title": "Harmony Lessons", "plot": "Harmony Lessons is set in a small Kazakhstan village, where Aslan, a thirteen-year-old boy living with his grandmother is a diligent student, bullied by an older boy Bolat and his gang connected with adult criminals and prisoners.

When he asks her about it, she says that Mr. Gordy says that some people are coming.\nThese people turn out to be Mama Kay and her grandson who buy a quilt from Joyce that she had found at the old station. Mama Kay tells Heidi that she is special and to be careful of what she sees, while her grandson tells Andy the true story of the stationmaster. He was primarily a taxidermist and would enlist the help of guides called conductors to help guide slaves to a meeting place. He would hold them somewhere secret, then when it was safe, he would move them to the next location. Two of the slaves he had hidden were Mama Kay's ancestors, Nell and Levi, but they were never heard from again after they stopped at the station. When the townspeople found out about his involvement, they blindfolded him, filled his abdomen with stuffing and hanged him from the tree where the swing once was that Heidi had seen.\nAndy relays this information to Joyce and Lisa, who then relays it to Heidi, but tells her that the stationmaster was a good man and helped a lot of people.

Heidi begins to climb and then is pulled up through the ground. When Lisa attempts to follow her, she is pulled back down by the stationmaster. She is confronted by the ghost, but experiences a vision of her mother who tells her to \"let them in\". She finally embraces her visions and finds out that the stationmaster had told Nell, Levi, and the conductor that he would be back for them, but traps them instead, leaving them to starve so that he could stuff them. Learning the truth, it allows their spirits to be freed and have their vengeance on the stationmaster. The stationmaster's death is revisited, but instead of it being the townspeople who murder him, it is the spirits of all those he had killed. This allows Lisa to escape and the stationmaster's spirit to be destroyed. It is then revealed that the person who had pulled Heidi through the ground was actually the spirit of Mr. Gordy, who was the stationmaster's descendant and was acting as a protector of the Wyrick family.\nTwo weeks later, Andy attempts to hang a tire swing for Heidi. Lisa and Joyce speculate about why Mr. Gordy hadn't wanted people on his land and come to the conclusion that he wanted his ancestor to be remembered for the good that he did and not the bad. Meanwhile, Heidi is struggling to ride her bike when it suddenly straightens up. She turns around to see Mr. Gordy and he sends her off to ride happily where she sees the spirits of Nell, Levi, and the Conductor heading off into the woods, finally free. She turns around and sees Mr. Gordy waving goodbye to her before he turns and walks away into the afterlife, satisfied that the Wyricks are safe.\nIn a text epilogue, it is revealed that the Wyricks remained in that house for another five years, Lisa's visions have not returned, and that Heidi never saw Mr. Gordy again.

He's living with his partner Camilla, an assertive aspiring young doctor who is pretty much the driving force (not to mention, main financial supporter) of their otherwise contented life together. And even though he lives in a house bought and paid for by Camilla's wealthy father, still Jack struggles to afford an engagement ring to go with the very proposal he's just sprung on his tearfully accepting now fianc\u00e9e. Camilla not only jumps straight into reception planning, but having previously suffered a problematic miscarriage, pregnancy preoccupation and planning has shot to the top of her priorities list. Jack, though terrified at the idea of becoming a father, is nevertheless even more fearful of losing the only thing truly stable and loving in his life, so silently acquiesces to his fianc\u00e9e's wishes. Little does he know just how much his life is about to change when he answers the door to someone he doesn't immediately recognise, but who certainly seems to know him.\nThe incessant ringer at the door is Anna (Anna Friel). Soon, Jack is reminded that Anna is someone he drunkenly hooked-up with at some concert 8 years previously - a one-night stand as it happens - and informs him that they have a seven-year-old son called Phoenix. At first Jack is rude and dismissive, clutching at denials and misremembered snippets of having worn a condom. But Anna's insistence on a paternity test soon sets him on the right path to accept and meet his son. Jack begins to spend time with Phoenix but is reluctant to tell Camilla about everything that has been going on, unsure how to juggle both sides of his life at once. Meanwhile, Camilla's meticulous ovulation tracking soon means that Jack is about to be father for a second time. Fearful of losing out, Jack mishandles the situation by not being honest with either party. Camilla however soon finds out the truth when Phoenix needs to be rushed to the hospital she's working at after a nasty fall from a jungle-gym at the playground during one of their weekly visits. Consequently, feeling lied to and betrayed, Camilla kicks Jack out the house, cancels their wedding plans and wants nothing to do with him. Jack is devastated and attempts to explain and set things right, but ultimately understands that the right choice is actually making his son his priority and to just give the situation some time.\nLater, it is revealed that Anna has a terminal illness (ovarian cancer) and that Anna's awareness of doomed fate is what prompted her to seek out Jack in the first place. In order that Phoenix not be left alone in the world after such a traumatic event as losing his mother, she asks Jack to promise to care for Phoenix as he'll be needing his father more than ever once she's gone - which Jack immediately agrees and promises to do. In the end, Anna dies and Phoenix goes to live with Jack, who eventually makes things right with Camilla too. The film ends just before Camilla is due to give birth to their baby.

Ig meets Lee by the docks and pulls off Merrin's necklace. He realizes Lee was unable to see the horns because he was wearing the necklace. Exposed to the horns, Lee falls under their influence and admits to killing Merrin. In flashbacks, Lee was also in love with Merrin and was deeply jealous of Ig throughout their childhood. Lee followed Merrin into the woods, thinking that Merrin had been sending him signals for a long time and that she had broken up with Ig to be with him. When Merrin insisted that she loved Ig more than anyone in the world, Lee raped her in a jealous rage and killed her with a rock, stole her necklace, and planted the bloody rock on Terry. In the ensuing confrontation, Lee overpowers Ig and lights him on fire in his car, causing Ig to drive into the bay. Lee claims that Ig confessed to the crime and committed suicide. The horns allow Ig to survive, horrifically burned and disfigured.\nMerrin's father, who does now believe Ig is innocent, gives him the key to Merrin's lockbox. When Ig puts on Merrin's cross, his body is restored and the horns disappear. In the lockbox, he finds a note from Merrin explaining that she knew Ig was going to propose, but she was dying of cancer and did not want him to suffer, so she pushed him away under the pretense of loving someone else.\nIg confronts Lee, who does not remember their earlier fight, and leads him into the woods where Merrin was killed. Eric and Terry arrive to arrest Lee. Lee confesses to the murder, but then gleefully kills Eric and injures Terry. Ig tears off the necklace, sprouting a pair of wings and bursting into flame, transforming into a demonic monster. Despite Lee fatally wounding him, Ig impales Lee on one of his horns and telepathically forces a snake down Lee's throat, killing him. Saying that his vengeance was all-consuming, Ig dies from his injuries and his smoldering corpse turns to hardened ash, and he appears to be reunited with Merrin in the afterlife.", "tmdb_id": 149509}, "40145808": {"title": "Horror Story (film)", "plot": "Vikrant Nerula enters alone the deserted Grandiose Hotel.

One day, while going through menopause, she discovers that the local breast cancer screening unit is closing due to a lack of funding. Beth is upset as her friend Tess Muldoon, who died from breast cancer three years ago left the center her money and the state was going to match it. Beth then discovers that there was a mix-up when she filed the paperwork and that she had to reapply yearly. She later calls the state health department which tells her that she needs to raise $25,000 within two months to keep the clinic open.\nBeth gets in contact with some other women from the Burning Bush High School's 1980 basketball team. Ginger Peabody, who owns a car dealership, Florine Clarkston, who's running for mayor, Roxie Rosales, a pothead and Clementine Winks, a multiple divorcee. Beth tells them they can get the money if they can make $15,000 on concessions and admissions, as well as a betting pool on themselves for three games against the state champions the Lady Armadillos, for which her daughter Jocelyn is a member.\nAlong with their new team manager Laurie, they show up for practice, Florine tries to talk Beth into think of other ways to get the money, but Beth convinces her that she's still capable of playing and appoints her as starting lineup. Beth then names the team the \u201cHot Flashes\".\nAt the Post office where Beth's husband Lawrence is the Postmaster, Beth puts up posters for the event while the church Secretary Kayla Rash, whose daughter Millie is one of the Lady Armadillos, assumes the church will receive the money and split half of it with the School's marching band. Beth tells her the proceeds are going to the mobile unit. Kayla tries to convince Beth otherwise, but Beth stands with her choice.\nBeth then asks Paul Lazarini, a veterinarian who lost his license for committing a minor felony and a friend of Tess to coach the team, to which he agrees. The team starts off rough with infighting among Clementine and Roxie, but Paul manages to get all of them to stop and reminds all of them to use their innate abilities and to use it to their advantage. He even manages to get them more focused with playing. Roxie designs the team's uniforms which Ginger prints up. Roxie then goes to her friend Roy and asks him to serve as Referee for their games as he has taken it up as a second job due to money being tight for him.\nBeth later discovers that no one's betting in the pool and that they have less than $200. While meeting with the others and telling them about these new problems, Beth tells them that she doesn't know if her marriage is good. Just then Millie and her friends come by and deliver backhanded complements to them.\nThe first game has very few spectators and the betting pools now has $400. Paul convinces them to go and play and tells them that his Aunt died of Breast Cancer as her town didn't have a mobile unit to treat her. Roy is unable to referee the game due to food poisoning, but the Hot Flashes manage to score 18 points, despite losing to the Lady Armadillos who score 37, as well Clementine pulling a muscle and some harassment from the Lady Armadillos' coach Slaughter, who is also one of her ex-husbands. As the Hot flashes leave, Millie lies by saying that Ginger tried to feel her up.\nAs Kayla and Millie leave, Kayla gives Beth a back handed complement and makes a homophobic insult about Ginger. Beth then gets into an argument with them, with Kayla saying that Millie has followed and respects the bible. Beth rebukes them by telling them that Millie and another boy were making out at the miniature golf course a week earlier and blackmails them to not insult Ginger, or she'll put it on Facebook. Kayla then insults Beth and says the Hot flashes are a bad influence and believes that everyone in town will listen to her instead of Beth.\nAs Beth does some more practicing for the other games, Lawrence believes she would by tired of this, but Jocelyn is sure that the Hot Flashes are taking these games and the donations seriously. One day, when Beth comes home, she discovers a hair pin that doesn't belong to her or Jocelyn in Lawrence's truck and believes that he's having an affair. When he comes home, he denies it and says something misogynistic to her. When Jocelyn comes home, she's angry at Beth for listening to her phone calls, which is how she found out about the golf course incident. Even though Beth wasn't eavesdropping to get Millie grounded and says that Millie deserved it for what she did to Ginger, Jocelyn's teammates are barely speaking to her.\nAt game 2, the Hot Flashes are more focused and are no longer in-fighting. There's also $1,500 in the betting pool. Roy has recovered from his food poisoning and manages to let the Hot Flashes get away with dirty techniques, which makes Kayla angry. Millie attempts to insult Clementine, only for Clementine to insult her back. Coach Slaughter also threatens Roy for allowing the Hot Flashes to get away with their dirty playing. The Hot flashes then win 39 to 38.\nWhile celebrating their win at a local bar, Paul notices that Lawrence has left. Beth tells Paul that ever since the Post Office had to lay off several workers, Lawrence has been working overtime every night. Roxie and the others convince her to go down and temp him with a \"special delivery\". A newspaper reporter comes by for Photos and Clementine offers a story on how the team got started as Ginger tells them that she sold her pickup truck and got them some money.\nBeth asks Roxie to drop her off at the Post Office so she can visit Lawrence. When Beth Visits, she hears Kayla and discovers that Lawrence is having an affair with her. They then discover that Beth has found them out. The next morning, Jocelyn is still mad at Beth, while Lawrence says that Beth being with the Hot Flashes makes her feel 18 again and that's how he feels with Kayla. Heartbroken, Beth doesn't want to attend the game. When her teammates show up at her house, they tell her that they didn't know about the affair either. Beth feels that Lawrence will leave her and that she'll be completely alone when Jocelyn goes to college and that she also hoped that playing again would make Lawrence see her the way he used to. However, the other women tell her that they're standing by her. Beth then tells them that she was the reason the mobile unit ran out of money as she forgot to re-apply and that she was too ashamed to tell them. Florine reads the newspaper article on them and the praise they're receiving, telling Beth that she would be quitting on all of them. This gets Beth back on her feet to practice for the last game.\nWhen they arrive at the high school, Slaughter says that the school board has banned the whole team for believing them to be bad influences. Beth decides to go to the school board's meeting the next night. She learns that they were banned from playing due to smoking, bribing Roy, \"promoting homosexuality\" and \"excessive\" profanity. Beth looks at the letter and discovers that Kayla filed the complaint. Beth offers to have the team improve their behavior, but the men still refuse. Beth tries a new approach, telling them that their wives were high school cheerleaders and called all of them on her way to the meeting and offered them to do a halftime performance. The men call their wives and after hearing that Beth was telling the truth, decide to lift the ban. When Beth comes home, she tells Lawrence not to come to the last game if he wants to continue his affair.\nOn the day of the last game, Paul tells them that the betting pool has been raised to $25,000, their newspaper interview went viral and that Good Morning America wants to do a pregame interview with one of them. The women vote Roxie to give the interview and she does well. Before the game begins, Beth notices that Jocelyn is still mad at her and that Lawrence hasn't shown up, while Roxie's husband Tito and Ginger's girlfriend Jewel have.\nDuring the halftime performance, Kayla's husband returns, having decided to work back home, while Lawrence shows up near the end of the final quarter, in which Millie trips Beth. During a time-out, Beth notices that Lawrence has shown up while Paul successfully asks Laurie out. When Jocelyn asks Millie why she tripped Beth, Millie says it was accidental. Jocelyn then tells three of her other teammates that Millie was having sex with their boyfriends, causing them to ignore her and play in a new manner. Beth scores the winning shot and reconciles with Jocelyn, while Clementine is now on better terms with Slaughter.\nAfterwards, Lawrence tells Beth how proud he is of her, but when she asks why he came so late, she realizes that Kayla left him instead of the other way around and kicks him out. Lawrence says that Beth can't make it alone at her age, but Beth tells him that her teammates have been there for her, while he has been completely unsupportive. With the new money, the clinic remains opened.\nSix months later, Laurie is working at the clinic and is engaged to Paul, while Florine is now the Mayor of Burning Bush. Even though Kayla is still working at the church, her reputation has been destroyed as Millie has gotten herself pregnant.

He then learns that his newborn baby needs to be kept in a ventilator for the next two days before she can breathe on her own. The only problem is that the hurricane is beginning to flood the hospital and the ventilator can't be moved.\nWhen the hurricane becomes too strong, everyone in the hospital, including the doctors and nurses, evacuate the building, leaving only Nolan and his baby (whom he names Abigail, after her mother) in the empty hospital. One of the nurses promises to bring back help and leaves, because Nolan is unwilling to abandon his baby. The power then goes out and Nolan is forced to find a way to keep his baby alive. He finds a hand-cranked generator in a storeroom and is able to manually charge the ventilator battery, but it only holds a charge for three minutes. He also finds some more IVs for the baby to keep her nourished, and some food and drinks for him to stay alive as well. With each charge the battery life gets shorter. Using only that amount of time, Nolan tries to juggle trying to get help outside of the hospital and rushing to help his baby before her timer runs out. Sometimes, Nolan sits down with his baby and tells the story about how he met her mother, to help keep himself preoccupied. (The two met after stopping a bank robbery together.)\nAfter this, Nolan finds a stray dog hiding in the hospital and takes care of it. He names the dog Sherlock while also having illusions of talking with his late wife. Nolan goes to the rooftop to find helicopters flying around the building.

Nolan barely returns to the room in time to charge the battery again. Despite being awake for over 36 hours without power and running low on food, (his hand cut from cranking the generator), Nolan continues to come up with more clever ways to charge the battery (i.e. using his foot and later a rod). He also plays games with Sherlock, like playing fetch with him and sharing his lunch meat given to him by one of the hospital cooks.\nLooters soon start to break into the hospital and steal food, drug and saline water for the baby. One comes in Nolan's room and tries to steal food but gets attacked by Sherlock, who runs him off. Nolan later realizes that this man had robbed and killed the nurse who was bringing back supplies (as she promised earlier). Since he hasn't slept in almost two days, Nolan takes a shot of some adrenaline to keep himself awake. Two more looters later break in the hospital and try to steal drugs to get high with and sell. When Nolan finds that they are both armed with guns, Nolan takes two shots of the adrenaline and sneaks up on one, injecting him with it and giving him a fatal overdose. Nolan takes his Marlin 336 lever-action rifle and surprises the other thug, who has discovered his baby. Nolan shakes his head \"no\" while holding the rifle on him, trying to get him to leave them alone.

Peeta and Katniss subsequently announce their engagement in an attempt to quell the Districts. At an upper-class party concluding the tour, Snow publicly toasts them but subtly signals to Katniss that he remains unconvinced.

The adult tributes, accustomed to a safe and comfortable life as victors, are openly angry about being forced to return to the Games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna sets it to transform into a symbol of a mockingjay. As an effort to stop the games, Peeta lies during his interview, saying that he and Katniss have married in secret and are expecting a child, which leads to fruitless protests from citizens for the Games to be stopped. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is beaten to death by Peacekeepers in front of her as punishment for tampering with her dress.\nIn the Games, Katniss and Peeta ally themselves with the District 4 tributes, playboy Finnick Odair and his elderly mentor Mags.

The lightning is conducted along the wire, causing the arena shields to fail and the roof to fall, and Katniss is knocked unconscious.\nKatniss awakens in an aircraft with Haymitch, Finnick, a still-unconscious Beetee, and Heavensbee, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow.

He waves to his wife Jessi (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), who is towing a luggage cart across the tarmac. The distraction causes her to crash into another ground technician who was checking Twitter. Le\u00f3n checks on his wife to make sure she is okay, and she reveals that she is pregnant.\nOn board the aircraft, a flight attendant drugs all the passengers in Economy class with a muscle relaxant. She also sedates herself and the other flight attendants in Economy. First Class is tended to by Joserra (Javier C\u00e1mara), Fajardo (Carlos Areces), and Ulloa (Ra\u00fal Ar\u00e9valo). They take shots of tequila as they prepare service for the passengers and the cockpit. One of the first class passengers, Bruna (Lola Due\u00f1as), observes that the Economy passengers are asleep, and she visits the cockpit. She informs Joserra, Captain Alex Acero (Antonio de la Torre), and co-pilot Benito Mor\u00f3n (Hugo Silva) that she is a psychic and a virgin.\nBruna makes vaguely ominous warnings about the flight. Joserra asks her if they will all die. Bruna does not think so, because she retches whenever death is imminent. Benito changes his drink order from wine to tequila at Bruna's news. Two more passengers from First Class come to the cockpit: Norma Boss (Cecilia Roth), and Infante (Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Yazpik). Norma is outraged at Peninsula's treatment of its passengers, particularly the fact that the First Class attendants are not serving the passengers. She is organizing a complaint against the airline. During her visit, Joserra reveals that he is the captain's lover, but with two daughters, aged 11 and 13, the captain is reluctant to come out of the closet and leave his wife. The co-pilot admits that he tried giving fellatio to the captain to see if he was gay, but he retched from the experience.\nMr. M\u00e1s (Jos\u00e9 Luis Torrijo), another First Class passenger, visits the cockpit to offer his help, because he knows that something is wrong with the plane.  Le\u00f3n forgot to clear all the chocks after Jessi's accident, and one of them has gotten tangled up with the landing gear. The plane will not be able to land with its wheels down.\nWhen Norma finds out that the Economy passengers have been drugged, she becomes more determined to lodge a formal complaint. She wakes a sleeping passenger, Ricardo Gal\u00e1n (Guillermo Toledo), and asks him to sign her letter of complaint. Ricardo asks to use the phone, and he calls Alba (Paz Vega). The plane's phone is malfunctioning, however, so everyone can hear the other side of the conversation over the cabin's speakers.\nAlba has climbed onto the ledge of the Segovia Viaduct in Madrid, when her phone rings with Ricardo's call. She is relieved to hear from him, but as she tries to climb back to safety, she drops her phone. It falls into the basket of Ruth (Blanca Su\u00e1rez), who is riding a bicycle under the viaduct. She picks up the phone and is astonished to hear the voice of her ex-lover Ricardo. She had worked very hard to overcome the heartache of their breakup. Ruth realizes that Alba had thrown all of Ricardo's things out of her apartment window before attempting suicide. Ruth gathers Ricardo's things while Alba is taken by ambulance for psychiatric treatment.\nOn board the plane, the flight attendants try to distract the passengers, who know that their lives are in danger. They perform a dance routine to The Pointer Sisters' \"I'm So Excited\", and then they mix a batch of Valencia cocktails. One of the passengers is smuggling a drug-filled condom in his anus. He gives the flight attendants some of his mescaline, and they put it into the cocktail. Norma enjoys her cocktail and reveals that she has a thriving dominatrix practice. She is horrified to learn that she has been drugged and that one of the side effects of mescaline is sexual arousal.\nThe passengers act on their drug-induced sexual urges, including the passenger who had provided the drugs who sexually assaults his sleepwalking wife. Norma has sex with Infante. The Captain joins Joserra in the bathroom. Bruna goes back to economy class and loses her virginity by sexually assaulting one of the passengers who has an erection in his sleep. Ulloa performs fellatio on the co-pilot.\nThe plane finally gets clearance to land at La Mancha airport, which is a boondoggle engineered by Mr. M\u00e1s. As they prepare to jettison the 40 tons of fuel on board, the co-pilot tells the captain that he and Ulloa 69'ed each other. The captain explains that the co-pilot is in denial about the fact that he is gay. Bruna confesses that she feels like retching, which means death must be near. She narrows the sensation down to one passenger in particular: Infante. He confesses that he is a hit man. He was hired to kill Norma by the wife of one of her clients, but refuses because he won't kill a woman.\nThe aircraft successfully makes a crash landing at the airport. Norma and Infante leave the tarmac arm in arm while he plots how he can escape from his contract and his life as a hit man. Ruth meets Ricardo with a suitcase full of his things that she recovered from Alba. Mr. M\u00e1s calls his wife, who has reunited with their estranged daughter, and vows to join the reunion, even though he knows he will be arrested. Bruna and the passenger she seduced are happily walking side by side. The captain tells Joserra that he will leave his family to move in with him, but Joserra reveals that he and the captain's wife are in constant contact, and that it is not necessary to break up the family.

Hallucinating from the injection, Elias begins seeing Sc4rlet, who leads him to the roof of the building next door to his apartment, where she tells him that they will \"die together, like he wants to\".

Stefan then spots Elias alone on the next door roof, and comes to his rescue just in time.\nElias wakes up in the hospital, where Stefan angrily berates him for not telling him about the bullying and the drugs. Stefan asks Elias what he can do to help, and Elias asks him that there's only one thing he wants to do. After being discharged from the hospital, Elias records a suicide letter on video and says goodbye to his friends and family. That night, Sc4rlet appears in his room, and we realize that she never stepped off the train in the beginning, and that Elias has been envisioning her to help him.

As the students struggle to grasp with what they have seen, Elias appears on the gallery behind them, alive and well. A quick flashback reveals that Elias had jumped to a deck below, where his father caught him. They then faked the disappearance and suicide, with the faked suicide video as \"evidence\", in order to bring attention to the bullying.\nSome time later, Stefan, Elias and Jonas, a family once again, is watching an interview with Stefan on television, where he is questioned about the ethics of Elias faking his death like he did. Stefan then responds that bullying is never taken seriously, \"not until someone dies. We needed someone to die, so that the world could see the truth.\" A vision of Sc4rlet appears once again, smiling to Elias, who, for the first time, can smile again. He decides to find her; and using the number she texted him from earlier in the film, tracks her down, learning that her real name is Scarlet Friedmann. The film then ends with Elias finally meeting Scarlet, who recognizes him from the train and tells him that she waited for him at the station and was sad when he never showed up, but is glad that he finally had the courage to meet her."}, "22144990": {"title": "Iron Man 3", "plot": "At a New Year's Eve party in 1999, Tony Stark meets scientist Maya Hansen, the inventor of Extremis, an experimental regenerative treatment that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist Aldrich Killian offers them a place in his company Advanced Idea Mechanics, but Stark rejects him. Thirteen years later, Stark is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and has frequent panic attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion of New York. He has built dozens of new Iron Man suits to cope with his insomnia, creating friction with his girlfriend Pepper Potts.\nMeanwhile, a string of bombings is claimed by a terrorist known as the Mandarin. Stark's security chief Happy Hogan is badly injured in one such attack and is put into a coma, prompting Stark to issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his artificial intelligence J.A.R.V.I.S. pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional and lacks sufficient power to return to Malibu, leaving the world to believe that he died.\nWith the help of Harley Keener, a local boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack, although it occurred years before any known attack by the terrorist. He discovers the \"bombings\" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot to cover up Extremis' flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents Savin and Brandt attack him: Stark kills Brandt and incapacitates Savin. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts with assistance from Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin, with James Rhodes\u2014the former War Machine, now re-branded as the Iron Patriot\u2014lured into a trap to steal his armor.\nTracing the Mandarin to Miami, Stark infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside, he discovers the Mandarin is an English actor named Trevor Slattery, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian then captures Stark. He reveals he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope Stark will help fix Extremis' flaws while trying to save her. When Hansen betrays Killian by threatening to jeopardize his operations, Killian fatally shoots her.\nStark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard Air Force One, using the Iron Patriot armor, controlled by Savin. Stark kills Savin, saving the passengers and crew, but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis. At an impounded damaged oil tanker, Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President would then become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders, in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. Stark and Rhodes infiltrate the platform, aided by the remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S.. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure. Before he can save her, a rig collapses around them, and she falls to the platform below, causing Stark to believe her dead. Stark fights Killian but finds himself cornered. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive the fall, kills Killian to save Stark.\nAs a gesture of his devotion to Potts, Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to destroy all the Iron Man suits. The Vice President and Slattery are arrested, and Happy awakens from his coma. With Stark's help, Potts's Extremis effects are stabilized; and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea.

For Jack, his father has been missing since birth, but Newald swears he has only been gone a few days. He is surprised that his son is now a legal adult but accepts that it must be true. He further deduces that the following must be true: one day in this land is equivalent to one year on Earth. Newald is still only twenty-nine. Jack explains to his father that Jess gave him the beans, and Newald fondly recalls that his friend never forgets a promise. Jack then suggests they go back down the beanstalk together, but Newald points out that \"only he who plants the bean can travel the stalk\".\nJack and his father explore the Land of the Clouds and visit the mysterious sorceress Selina in hope of finding a solution to their problem. Newald confronts Selina as she is taking a bath in the middle of an empty room.

Selina is coming to Earth to find her.\nThe British Army steps in (dressed in the uniforms of World War II soldiers). They declare the beanstalk as a public menace, but their military weapons - including rifles, tranquilizer bullets and rubber bullets - are ineffective against the beasts. Lisa, Newald and Jack drive the floating castle off the edge of the world and Newald admits that he has no idea what is going to happen. Luckily, the castle seems to be holding up quite well. The castle spins off the edge of the world and they land safely on a creature. General O'Shauncey has seen many things in his army career, but he exclaims that this \"takes the biscuit\". Meanwhile, Jess pretends to be the prime minister.\nNewald nabs Selina's necklace as he believes it will stop her control over the giants. He cites the law that \"they will become peaceful beasts of the fields\". Unfortunately, the giants do not become peaceful beasts of the fields and become evil, attacking everyone in sight. Newald takes Selina into a car and introduces her to his friends. The driver is squashed by a giant.\nThe British Army defeats most of the monsters but one remains. Jess sacrifices himself to distract the beast with his motorcycle, and is tragically squashed underfoot.

As it rains, one of the beans takes root and grows into a massive beanstalk that carries the house and Isabelle into the sky as Jack falls to the ground.\nJack, Roderick, and Roderick's attendant Wicke join the king's knights, led by Elmont and his second-in-command, Crawe, climbing the beanstalk in search of Isabelle.

He tells the giants they will attack Cloister at dawn, and gives them permission to eat Isabelle and Elmont. \nOne of the giants prepares to cook Elmont as a pig-in-a-blanket and is about to chop Isabelle up when Jack impales his neck with a kitchen knife from above. The trio races to the beanstalk, where Jack causes the giant guarding it to fall off the realm's edge. Seeing the giant's body, Brahmwell orders the beanstalk cut down to avoid a giant invasion, putting the safety of the Earth ahead of Isabelle's possible return.\nJack and Isabelle head down the beanstalk, during which they admit their growing feelings, while Elmont stays to confront Roderick. He kills him, but Fallon takes the crown before he can, so he is forced to escape down the falling beanstalk or be trapped in the giants' realm. Jack, Isabelle, and Elmont all survive the fall after the beanstalk is cut down. As everyone returns home, Jack warns them the giants used Roderick's beans to create beanstalks to descend down to attack Cloister.\nThe giants chase Jack, Isabelle, and Brahmwell into the castle, where Elmont fills the moat with oil and lights it. Fallon falls into the moat and breaks into the throne room from below. As the siege continues and both sides struggle for control of the drawbridge, Fallon captures Jack and Isabelle, but Jack throws the final bean down Fallon's throat before he can eat him, causing a beanstalk to rip apart his body. Jack takes the crown just as the giants break into the courtyard, he takes control of them, sending them back to their realm to cut down the beanstalks themselves.\nBrahmwell abolishes the law that the princess can't be with a commoner, so Jack and Isabelle marry and tell the story of the giants to their children.

Jayanta did the deed on the promise that his status within the don's gang will be elevated once he is released, but the promise was reneged. Though Simran is initially disdainful of Jayanta's roguish behavior, she gradually warms up to him after he takes her to a hospital all the way on his back when she overdoses of vitamin supplements and passes out in her room. Realizing Jayanta's friendly, caring and humorous nature despite his gangster background, she begins to develop romantic affections for him. Their relationship nurtures to the point that they end up getting intimate one day while drunk.\nFacing pressure from her father over her career and wedding, Simran introduces Jayanta to him as her boyfriend who is a successful manager in an IT firm. Her father decides to fix their marriage but changes his mind after seeing Jayanta thrashing a man at a party, realising that he is a rowdy. He bars Simran from returning to Mumbai, even forbidding her to attend an important job interview. Meanwhile, Jayanta starts a gang war by beating up the henchmen of a rival gangster Alex Pandian, who is a former police officer. Althaf Bhai decides that Jayanta should murder Alex. After ensuring that Simran attends her interview, Jayanta proceeds with the plan to murder Alex. Jayanta succeeds in killing Alex, but gets stabbed with a rebar and is left to bleed to death.\nTwo years later, Simran has become a director in her company and has moved out of the housing colony. She constantly thinks about Jayanta, whom she had never seen again after her interview. Simran yearns to show Jayanta her new life, knowing that he is the one person who will be happier than even herself in her having achieved her dreams. She soon finds Jayanta working at a petrol bunk, having survived his murder attempt and abandoned his rowdy past.

As he goes about carrying boxes into their new apartment, Masashi feels a mysterious presence in the room.\nThe next day, upon returning home from visiting the new elementary school, Masashi encounters a strange creature that looks like a jellyfish. Masashi names the adorable creature, which loves chee-kama (cheese-and-fish-cake sticks) and freely flies around, Kurage-bo (Jellyfish Boy). Despite the lack of a common language, they take to each other immediately and become friends.\nMasashi goes to school with Kurage-bo hidden in his backpack. He is anxious that someone might find out his secret, but then is astonished to discover that everyone in his new class has one of these strange creatures, which they call F.R.I.E.N.D.s, as his or her companion. The minute the teacher turns her back to the classroom, the children take out their controllers, called Devices, with which they generate and manipulate their F.R.I.E.N.D.s.

She retorts with anger, \"You want us out of here?\" Later, Naoto makes Masashi promise to report to him if he notices anything strange. Although Naoto takes note of Kurage-bo in Masashi's backpack, he doesn't bring it up.\nOne day on his way home from school, Masashi comes across his classmates playing on the grounds of a shrine, making their F.R.I.E.N.D.s fight one another. The boys try to force Masashi to join the battle, but Kurage-bo is nowhere to be seen and the F.R.I.E.N.D.s are upon him. At the crucial moment, enormous and powerful Luxor appears together with Kurage-bo and they fight the F.R.I.E.N.D.s off. Luxor, Masashi finds out, is his classmate Saki (Himeka Asami)'s F.R.I.E.N.D.\nSaki reveals to Masashi that her Device was given to her, at a time when she was feeling down about family problems, by the top-level members of the research center. Cloaked in black, the four told her that the Device would give her \"a friend who will never betray.\" They gave out Devices to all the elementary school students in town. Soon the children started pitting F.R.I.E.N.D.s against F.R.I.E.N.D.s in battle, and now these battles take place all over.\nMeanwhile, a school festival is going on at the University, where Naoto's research center is located. The cult group to which Saki's mother, Shizuko (Asuka Kurosawa), belongs claims that the research going on at the University is evil and dangerous. They have organized a protest. When Shizuko presses Saki to pray with her, Masashi and Saki run away hand-in-hand and end up stepping into the midst of the research center. The Black-Cloaked Four, seeing the powerful energy in Masashi, start plotting to trap him in their hands.\nHaving shared their problems with one another, Masashi and Saki start to develop a bond.

It seems to be fall time. The few minutes of the movie are shots of animals accompanied by the same music. A praying mantis is the first animal that appears, followed by a turtle, a grasshopper, the sounds of birds chirping, a male deer and a gecko. The sound of the chirping birds is the first \"nature\" sound heard in the film as opposed to the music which opens the film.\nA woman appears behind the leaves of trees of the mountain forest. It is not easy to identify any of her characteristics other than the fact that she is wearing a red scarf on her head. The peace is suddenly disrupted by explosions and gunfire. The gecko and the snake go into hiding. Shots of people (later revealed to be the Kurdish guerrilla's living in the mountains) running away from the explosions and gunfire follow. The convoy vehicles from which the gunfire was coming from drive away. The Kurdish guerilla's are now more clearly in view and are seen wearing the same items of clothing (nude colored jumpers and boots). Night falls and the guerilla's are in a cave. This is the first point in the movie where human speech is first heard in the form of a Kurdish song:\nMy lovely mother\ntell me how are you\nregards to my father\nand to my brothers.\nYour father and I have grown old\nlife is bitter to us\nenough sweetheart come back.\nAfter singing this song, the main character (J\u00een) is seen running away from the armed organization she was previously fighting and living in the caves with. She runs away in the cover of the dark. The reason for her fleeing is unknown. At approximately the 13 minute mark of the movie, J\u00een's face is clearly revealed for the first time. She runs into the deer, decides not to shoot it, and the two make eye contact. J\u00een is now wandering alone in the forest, searching for food. She hears a bird screeching (presumably a hawk), climbs into the tree its sounds are coming from, and goes to steal the bird's eggs from the nest. There are three eggs and although initially she plans on taking all three, she returns two and eats only one upon hearing the crying of the bird. It is as if they have a mutual understanding of each other's needs and they come to a compromise (J\u00een needs to eat, the egg's belong to the bird). After eating her \"meal\" she is ready to climb back down to the forest floor and continue her journey on foot. However, she quickly climbs back upon seeing the Turkish soldiers coming into her area and setting up camp. One of the soldiers sings.\nWere you the one who always cried and burned\nI couldn't laught either in this world of lies\ndid you think I was happy\nin a world that stole my life over nothing.\nOh in this world of lies, world of lies\nin this world that fakes a smile to your face\nyou cried dear and I burned\nI though the world would be how I wished it\nI believed for no reason I was tricked over nothing\nIn this world that takes its color from the sky.\nThis is the second time in the movie there is human speech. Up to this point however, it has only been in the form of song. The soldiers are alerted by something and  leave in a hurry.\nJ\u00een, now safe, continues her journey. The first person she interacts with after being alone since fleeing the guerrillas is a shepherd boy. He gives her bread and calls her sister. She asks where the nearest village is and he points her in its direction. This is the first appearance of human speech in the movie.  As she is walking away from him, someone fires shots at her (probably a Turkish soldier). The gecko appears again.\nShe sees a house in the distance and waits for its owners to leave. Upon seeing them leave in a green truck, she goes inside and starts taking items like clothes, food, books, and money. She is in a girls room indicated by the girls clothes and the framed picture on the desk. J\u00een does not seems scared that she will be caught. Suddenly, inside the house, she hears an elderly woman calling for her granddaughter Leyla. J\u00een talks to the grandmother and helps her take her medication. The grandmother believes that J\u00een is her granddaughter Leyla. J\u00een takes this opportunity to call her mother, telling her not to cry or worry. The grandmother calls from Leyla (J\u00een) again for help to take her medication. In this moment, J\u00een realizes that the grandmother does not remember just having taken her medication. Considering the home owners were just in the house, they probably gave the grandmother her medication. J\u00een realizes that she accidentally gave the grandmother a double dose of medication. \"Grandma, what have you done?\" J\u00een says before leaving.\nWith her new acquired items, J\u00een changes her boots to the shoes she took from Leyla's house. Bombs start falling and J\u00een runs for cover in a cave. She is not alone. There is a black bear in the cave with her, taking cover from the bombs too. The bombing ends and J\u00een tells the bear \" Its finished, don't fear\". She gives the bear an apple and says \"Bye, bye compadre\". J\u00een now sits alone, trying to read a geography book she took from the house. It is obvious she has some trouble reading. \"Which part of the world do you live in? What part of Turkey do you live in?\" the book reads. This is the first time in the movie that the audience learns where the movie is taking place (Turkey). This point of innocence and a failed attempt at reading indicate to the audience that although J\u00een is very independent and tough, she is really just a young girl. \nShe changes over to commoner clothes but still keeps her red scarf on her head. She goes to a river to fill her canteen and the shepherd boy who she had met earlier sees her and approaches her. Due to her new outfit, he doesn't recognize who she is and starts asking her \"what a beautiful girl like her is doing all alone\". It seems like he is about to take advantage of the situation but J\u00een embarrass and intimidates him, yelling at him telling him who she is and how they had met earlier. She leaves him and continues her journey.\nShe runs into the bear again telling it \"Sorry compadre, no more apples\". The next scene shows her sitting alone in the dark, eating bread by a small fire. She is still in the mountainous forest and can hear the hawks over head. She tries to sleep but cannot. She continues her journey and comes upon a road. She sees a car coming and she hides in a ditch. A purple flower is shown. The next car that passes, she stands up to be seen. It seems that she wants to hitchhike but the car does not stop for her. She sleeps in the ditch, waiting for the next car. It is very windy. The snake appears again. A truck finally stops for her. It is green. The driver is an older man and they refer to each other as sister and brother. The driver asks her the reason for her travels, presumably she lies, saying that she is going to see her sick grandmother. The driver inquires more about her: says that she is from Varaptil, reveals her age, she does not have a dad and that her name is Leyla. The truck driver laughs at the irony that his daughter is also named Leyla. (The audience may presume at this point that the truck driver is from the same house, J\u00een was in earlier with the sick grandmother). The driver drops her off at her destination and gives her a chocolate. J\u00een tells the driver to say hi to Leyla for her. It is windy and the snake is shown again.\nJ\u00een gets on a bus with other people. In their journey, the soldiers stop them asking passengers where they are going. J\u00een seems afraid and mimics the response of the other passengers: she is going to go work. A woman on the bus asks J\u00een if she ran away from home. J\u00een says she is going to visit her sick grandmother. The two exchange a mutual smile as if they both understand the true reason. Ironically, J\u00een does end up going to work to make money for a bus ticket. She is with the same woman from the bus. It is at this point in the film (approximately the half way mark) when J\u00een first reveals her name. The woman's name is Zivar (which means ornament or jewelry). J\u00een shares her chocolate with Zivar. The truck J\u00een, Zivar, and the other workers are on finally arrives at the work field. The boss there tells the group that women hoe for 25 liras a day and men break rocks for 35 liras a day. When the man asks J\u00een for her papers, she says she forgot them at home. Zivar backs her up by lying that J\u00een is the neighbor's daughter. The man seems to believe the lie. In order for J\u00een to make money for her bus ticket quickly, she asks to break rocks instead. She lies to the man telling him that she wants to buy medication for her sick grandmother. She presents herself to him as 17 year old Leyla. The man allows her to break rocks and tells her to come by his quarters later to pick up her payment. She works hard for the next days breaking rocks. The task is difficult for her but she does not give up. When she has worked as many days she needs to, to collect money for her bus ticket she goes to visit the man. He invites her to his home and serves her tea. J\u00een, clearly uncomfortable and predicting what will happen (he will try to rape her) tries to not stay for too long, telling him she is only there for her payment. As soon as he gives her the money, he tries to rape her inside his home. She runs away and he chases behind her and catches up to her. He beats her briefly unconscious and starts dragging her back to his house. He rests for a second at which moment, J\u00een wakes up, takes a rock and knocks him unconscious in the head. She runs away and goes to the bus station purchasing her ticket.\nOn the bus she sits next to a young girl who asks J\u00een what happen to her face. J\u00een's face has some cuts and bruises. J\u00een responds by saying that a dog attacked her but she fought back, it got scared and ran away. Soldiers stop the bus, asking for IDs. J\u00een is taken off the bus since she doesn't have one along with an old insisting that he just left it at home and can go get it if need be. The two get taken to a Turkish compound where they are questioned. She speaks only in Kurdish while the soldiers speak only Turkish. A Kurdish interpreter comes to speak for he. She says she is from Gevez. She is put in a holding cell along with the old man. A helicopter flies in carrying a wounded Kurdish guerrilla. He is put in the holding cell with her. It seems as if she recognizes him. He asks her to kill him, likely because he will be interrogated by the Turkish soldiers. Upon his request, J\u00een kills him. While she is in the holding cell, bombs are falling outside. The Kurdish interpreter comes in and tries to violate her. However, because of the bombings, both she and the old man are released. She runs away but the Kurdish interpreter follows behind her. Eventually, she loses him.\nShe tries again to hitchhike but the cars don't stop for her. The turtle crosses the road. A car stops and two men get out. It seems that one of them is the Kurdish interpreter. J\u00een runs away from them back into the mountains. In the mountains, she find a mule with an injured leg. The mule is carrying food. She takes the mule to the river, cleans and ties its wounds. She takes the food its carrying, takes the mules reins off and sets it free. As she is walking away from the mule, bombs start falling. She runs for cover and later discovered the mule has been killed by one of the bombs.\nShe returns to the cave where she initially started. She finds her geography book there. She sees a mountain tiger. Bombs start falling again, the purple flower is shown again. There is repeat imagery of the same scenario happening (bombs dropping) with J\u00een in different locations. The different animals are also shown (bear, deer, snake etc.). The animals are shown as going into hiding when the bombs are being dropped. Also interesting to note is that despite all her travels, J\u00een's white shoes are clean.\nJ\u00een finds a wounded Turkish soldier and she takes care of him. They have a brief conversation. He tells J\u00een he only has 7 months of active duty left, perhaps implying that what he is doing is out of requirement and not purely driven by desire. He tells her he comes from \u00c7anakkale and his family (mother and siblings but no father). Upon saying that he never saw his father, J\u00een get angry saying that they (likely Turkish soldiers) took her father away from her and she never saw him again. When the soldiers says \"may he rest in peace\", J\u00een responds by saying \"what peace? He has no peace\". The next morning he leaves. He calls his mother to tell her that he is okay, J\u00een also calls hers, telling her mother that she decided not to go (to Izmir).As a token of gratitude, the soldiers offers his cellphone to J\u00een but she refuses it. He asks J\u00een for her name and despite official hesitation, she eventually tells him. He is the second person in the film to know her true name.\nAs she continues on her journey, she starts getting shot at again. She climbs into a tree for safety but she is shot and falls from it. She is shown lying on a huge rock, blood stains her once clean white shoes. All the animals shown throughout the movie surround her (bear, mule, mountain lion, deer etc.). She seems alive but it is uncertain.

The high tuition forces Jobs to drop out, but Dean Jack Dudman (James Woods) allows him to sit in on classes. Jobs is particularly interested in a calligraphy course. Jobs meets up with his friend Daniel Kottke (Lukas Haas), who is excited to see Jobs with a copy of Be Here Now by Baba Ram Dass. Influenced by this book and their experiences with LSD, Jobs and Kottke spend time in India. His philosophical ideas also lead Jobs to the decision not to wear any footwear.\nTwo years later, Jobs is back in Los Altos, California, living with his adoptive parents Paul (John Getz) and Clara (Lesley Ann Warren). While working for Atari as a video game developer, Jobs develops a partnership with his friend Steve \"Woz\" Wozniak (Josh Gad). Jobs is charged by his boss Al Alcorn (David Denman) to re-develop an arcade video game (Breakout), which he ends up having Wozniak build in his place. The job is such a success that Alcorn presents it to President Nolan Bushnell, but Jobs inequitably distributes the salary for the game development between Wozniak and himself.\nLater, Jobs discovers that Wozniak has built a prototype for a \"personal home computer\" (the Apple I), which he expresses interest in commercialising. They name their new company Apple Computer, though there is another company called Apple Records that is owned by The Beatles (Wozniak teases Jobs that this symbolizes his preference for Bob Dylan). After a failed sale at his employer company HP, Wozniak reluctantly demonstrates the Apple I at the Homebrew Computer Club to a bored audience. Jobs is later approached by store owner Paul Terrell (Brad William Henke) who shows interest in the Apple I. Jobs persuades his father Paul to let them set up their new company in the family's garage workshop. Jobs also recruits Kottke, fellow engineer Bill Fernandez (Victor Rasuk), and young neighbour Chris Espinosa (Eddie Hassell) to the Apple team.Terrell's disappointment in the Apple I (in his opinion, being only a motherboard and not a full computer as promised), inspires Jobs to restart with a second model. He hires Rod Holt (Ron Eldard) to re-conceptualize the power supply for what will be called the Apple II. Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney), a venture capitalist, notices Jobs and Wozniak's work, and also joins Apple. The Apple II is released at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire where it is a remarkable success.\nApple's success eventually causes Jobs to distance himself from his friends. Upon learning his high-school girlfriend Chrisann Brennan (Ahna O'Reilly) is pregnant, Jobs ends their relationship. Brennan gives birth to Lisa Brennan whom Jobs denies is his child. Kottke (now an Apple II Plus repairer) meanwhile leaves the company after acknowledging that his friend Jobs (who hardly even has any time to talk to him) is not rewarding the Apple I team with any Apple stock. John Sculley (Matthew Modine) is recruited as CEO of the company. As Jobs' behavior grows more erratic, Jobs is moved from the Apple Lisa development team to the Macintosh Group where he works with Bill Atkinson, Burrell Smith (Lenny Jacobson), Chris Espinosa, and Andy Hertzfeld (Elden Henson). Despite the change, his behavior does not change: he forces out Jef Raskin, the original Macintosh group leader, and then takes his place. Later, he  phones Microsoft founder Bill Gates, legally threatening him because their Word software is, in his opinion, a plagiarism of his team's word processor. Wozniak, still part of the Apple IIe team, decides to leave the company, feeling it has lost its way.\nThough the Macintosh is introduced with great fanfare in 1984, including a high-budget television commercial, it is seen as a failure due to the disproportionately high cost (as compared to the competitor IBM's DOS-based PCs). Jobs, convinced that the error is the limited random-access memory of the system, launches a new, more advanced version, but Scully forces him out of the company in 1985.\nThe film jumps to 1996.

He and his team of graduates try to contest against more experienced politicians who capture the people by giving freebies and money.

Sulaiman, though interested in Puja, finds his mother's wish much important and starts playing various plans to intimate feelings on Saraswati in Aditya's heart but all go vain. Meanwhile, Aditya's opponent Natawar Mondal (Supriyo Datta) attacks Puja but Sulaiman saves her. Puja falls for him and Aditya Choudhury feels that the attack was done by Mohsin Ali.\nNow for Sulaiman, things go much worse as Jhimli (the Daughter of Dayashankar and the girl who is loved by Krishna Bhattacharya) returns to the palace, proposes to him, and warns him that if he refuses to love her, she would reveal the Secret. Meanwhile, Pulok Purohit, who is in deep frustration as Dayashankar made him not to perform the \"Yogga\", wants to take revenge on him. Sulaiman plays a very clever game to hide his skin playing with the weaknesses of everyone. Everything goes smooth till Puja tells about her proposal of marriage with Krishna Bhattacharya to her dad and her dad sends his brothers to talk with Krishna's parents. Sulaiman reveals his identity to Puja and sets to Krishna Bhattacharya's House. There too he plays a game with the weaknesses of Krishna Bhattacharya's mother so that she would refer to Sulaiman as her son before Aditya Choudhury's sons. Things get on the right path and marriage planning activities took place on full swing.\nNatawar Mondal's son wants to marry Puja so that he can torture her to the core. This plan disturbs him and Natawar Mondal threatens Aditya to leave her or else his son aka Krishna Bhattacharya would be killed. Thus Aditya Choudhury summons Krishna Bhattacharya and finds that he neither loved Puja nor he performed the \"Yogga\". Sulaiman enters the scene, plays a game again, forces  to misrepresent Sulaiman as Krishna Bhattacharya at that place. Sulaiman makes Aditya Choudhury to invite Saraswati for the marriage and Mohsin says that he would come to the marriage only for Puja. Thus when the family along with Sulaiman visits the temple, Natawar Mondal attacks Aditya Choudhury's family and Sulaiman makes a call to Basha that he is attacked. Mohsin Khan reaches there with his men and in an emotional juncture, he saves Aditya Choudhury's family and Aditya Choudhury saves Saraswati. After knowing the truth that Sulaiman acted as Krishna Bhattacharya, he asks about the reason for the fraud and Sulaiman tells that it was to unite the two families.

Rumors that the strange foal is cursed spread and before long he is blamed for the drought that sets into the Great Karoo. As he matures, Khumba is picked on and remains ostracized by most of the herd with the exception of Tombi, a young female zebra friend close in age - whom Khumba has a crush on - and uncomfortable in the herd due to her tomboyish manners.\nWhen a mystical African mantis appears to Khumba, he draws a map to what could be interpreted as either water or stripes between it. Khumba jeopardizes the herd and gets into trouble when he attempts to admit several gemsbok into the watering-hole enclosure when their wise elderly healer needs water. A murderous African leopard, Phango, warns Mkhulu that he and the herd can't stay in their enclosure forever. Seko berates and scolds Khumba for putting the herd at risk and for the next week, he'll drink half of his rations. Lungisa tells the story of how a white horse got its stripes by swimming in a magic river and other horses wanted to have stripes like him, making the zebra we know today. Shortly after, Lungisa succumbs to her disease and dies. Then, Khumba leaves the confines of his home knowing that he cannot survive in the herd where it is viewed as only \"half-a-zebra\".\nKhumba ventures beyond the fence and once outside, encounters an opportunistic African wild dog named Skalk who nearly leads him to his doom when Skalk's pack try to eat him, even though he tries persuading his pack not to. He is saved by a maternal wildebeest named Mama V who is a self-confessed free spirit who does not want to be the average stay-at-home mom, like other wildebeest, & had lost her child to Phango. & a flamboyant British ostrich named Bradley who is mothered by Mama V & possesses a histrionic diva-esque attitude. The duo join Khumba on his quest in the hope that their own search for a safe waterhole is over. On their journey, Khumba aids a migrating herd of springbok in opening a hole in a great fence to continue journeying forward. Curiously, the springbok are all so similar that they cannot even differentiate among one another.\nKhumba thinks his journey is over when he wanders into a new age, bohemian community living safely within the confines of Ying's National Park. There he meets a colorful group of individuals like a family of Meerkats, an Ground Pangolin, two bushbucks, a bat-eared fox, and an Australian endangered riverine rabbit who has survived extinction by mastering a myriad of skills ranging from impersonations to beat-boxing. After narrowly escaping capture by an opportunistic group of park rangers who tranquilizes Bradley and traps Khumba in a cage, he wanders to a nearby mountain to speak to the mighty Black Eagle under the advice of the riverine rabbit.\nKhumba encounters a group of fanatical rock hyraxes who worship the Black Eagle and stymie his advance. From the albino Black Eagle, he learns the way to the watering hole and that it lies in Phango's cave. The Black Eagle also reveals that Phango is obsessed with being whole and murdered his whole clan, as revenge for being rejected when he was a cub, due to the fact he was born with one eye blind, which gave him a sense of smell like no other leopard, which turned him into a powerfully & endlessly killing hunter. Unbeknownst to Khumba, Phango is trailing him because of an ancient predator myth that says consuming the half-striped zebra will make whoever ate it the most powerful hunter that ever lived. As Khumba journeys onwards, Seko becomes withdrawn and is remorseful that he has let his herd down. He would have never been so hard on Khumba if it never happened. With Tombi\u2019s help, he realizes that if he does not lead his herd in search of another waterhole, they will all die and sets out to follow the trail of Phango. He is prompted by evidence that Khumba may be alive.\nTensions between Khumba, Mama V, and Bradley escalate as they move on. While slaking their thirst at a well on an abandoned farm, they are driven away by Nora, a loony, solitary Merino who lost her husband to Phango, and Khumba reveals that the watering hole is in Phango's cave. The trio has an argument and a fall-out and Khumba continues on alone. Lost and delirious in a saltpan, Khumba is rescued by the same gemsbok healer that he tried to help and wanders the remaining distance to the mountain, and Phango's lair. Meanwhile, Phango intercepts Mama V and Bradley and discovers that Khumba is fortuitously heading straight to him and returns to his cave. Concerned for Khumba's safety, Mama V and Bradley decide to intercede and warn him. Meanwhile, determined to find the waterhole and get his stripes, Khumba ventures into the leopard's lair. At the same time, Seko and the zebras journey to Phango's lair where they are joined by the springbok herd, the animals from Ying's National Park (all except the pangolin), the rock hyraxes, Skalk (who left his pack due to \"creative differences\"), and Nora (who was let out of the farm by Skalk).\nWhile Khumba wanders the depths of the dark cave, his herd arrives at the base of the mountain, along with many of the other animals he has encountered along his journey. Within the cave, Khumba finds the watering hole and upon reflection of his mother's words and all of the interactions he has had, he realizes that diversity is essential for survival and that would can be one's difference can, in fact, be one's strength. As Phango closes in, he ends up chasing after Khumba. Khumba races to escape the leopard's clutches as the cave starts to collapse. Part of the cliff gives way which forms a water hole outside Phango's cave. The assembled animals watch the fight between Khumba and Phango, which results in both of them falling due to the collapsing cave. Phango falls off the cliff where he is killed by two large rocks falling on him, while Khumba falls into the water and his body washes up on the shores. As it starts to rain, everyone begins to mourn Khumba until he suddenly awakens from his apparent death. As Khumba gets up, Tombi notices the scratch marks that Phango left on his right side during the fight.\nWith Phango dead and the zebra herd now having a new home, Khumba celebrates with his herd, Mama V, Bradley, Skalk, Nora, the gemsbok herd, the springbok herd, the animals from Ying's National Park, and the rock hyraxes, who all now live together & engage in different activities around the waterfall.", "tmdb_id": 172391}, "37086759": {"title": "Kick-Ass 2 (film)", "plot": "Four years after the death of Damon Macready / Big Daddy and defeating Frank D'Amico, Dave Lizewski, bored after having retired from fighting crime as Kick-Ass, begins training with Hit-Girl (Mindy Macready) to become a real hero.

Cliff (Timothy Dillard) is watching and is fascinated by the speed of Jake's signing and seems unaware of the nature of the conversation. Cliff identifies as hard-of-hearing and has only recently begun learning ASL as he was brought up orally and was mainstream schooled. He is a nerdy guy, technology-addicted, and wears a hearing aid. At the beginning of the movie, he tries to align himself with the hearing people, to the annoyance of Jake. During the campfire that night, the two hearing guys sit around one side of the fire chatting. Cliff joins them and tries to follow their conversation but gets confused. Keith (Will Sanders), the hearing guy, gets annoyed with him and Cliff wanders off to the other side of the fire where the deaf men are chatting. The two deaf guys, Matt (Christopher B. Corrigan) and Jake, chide Cliff for trying to be part of the hearing world, while they were laughing at him. They play a trick on Jake by giving him a sign name.

His wife has never learnt to sign, and it seems that she has played a part in Drew's disconnect from the rest of his family. Matt tells Drew that their mother has stage-2 breast cancer and he is shocked.\nIn the morning, Keith and Drew take the boat and go fishing in the lake without telling the others.

Matt and Keith are reasonably adept at shooting but Cliff has never fired a gun before, so he messes it up. The guys go off down a forest track to explore. Cliff needs a bathroom break, so he steps out behind a tree. Right at that moment, Jake spies a deer in the woods and decides to shoot it. Matt tries to stop him. Just as he is about to press the trigger on the rifle, something happens and they are flung to the ground. The world spins around them and the birds fly up. When Matt and Jake pick themselves up, they see the deer lying on its side, apparently dead. Jake checks his gun and, to his surprise, finds that the shot had not been fired. The deer suddenly gets up and runs into the clearing. Jake reloads, takes a few hurried shots at the deer and misses. It's then that they realize that Jake has accidentally shot Cliff in the lower left abdomen.\nThey eventually go back to the lake, where they meet up back with Keith and Drew.

Directed to the basement to help dig a tunnel, he almost causes its collapse as he panics over the fate of his girlfriend Julia, who was staying at his apartment at the time of the catastrophe. When they break through to a neighboring building, he meets his former boss Enrique, who tells Marc that they can talk later. A flashback reveals that Marc, working as a computer engineer, faced possible termination by Enrique. Afraid of losing his job, Marc resists Julia's desire to have children. The following morning, Marc watches a video of a boy who dies from suicide because his father could not understand or believe in his acute agoraphobia.\nIn the present, three months after the unspecified event, Marc and Enrique discuss leaving the building together. Enrique, who has a working GPS device, requests that Marc not tell the others about it; Marc reveals that he has stolen supplies formerly owned by Rovira, a dead coworker. Enrique is initially dismissive of Marc's scavenged supplies and declines to partner with him, but Marc blackmails Enrique into helping him search for Julia. The two set out into the subway system, where a young pickpocket steals the GPS device. After a chase and fight over his possessions, Enrique kills Javier, the pickpocket's brother after the power goes out. Although worried that Enrique will continue without him, Marc is relieved to find that Enrique is willing to continue their partnership.\nAnother flashback shows that Marc's neighbor has not left the building for months. At work, Rovira, revealed to have been covertly living in the office, is forced to leave. Once thrown out, he convulses; when dragged back in, the convulsions end, but he still dies from the trauma. Discussing these strange events at home with Julia, Marc notices that increasing numbers of people are refusing to leave their homes. In the present, Marc grows frustrated with Enrique's refusal to reveal why he wants to go to the Olympic city with a bag full of seeds. When they believe they have reached Marc's apartment building, they blast their way in with explosives. There, they learn that Julia, now pregnant, is not in the building.\nFlashbacks depict a growing trend of agoraphobia called \"the Panic\", a disease of unknown origin that kills anyone who goes outside through convulsion. Julia and Marc fight again over whether to have children, and Julia accuses Marc of using the Panic as an excuse to avoid it. After Marc leaves for work, Julia refuses to speak to him, and he becomes stranded in the office building when he suddenly becomes agoraphobic. In the present, Enrique tells Marc that since they have reached his apartment building, he will no longer accompany Marc. Enrique reveals that he is attempting to reach the hospital where his comatose father is at, which prompts the two to reconcile somewhat. At a church, a bear nearly mauls Enrique to death, but Marc manages to kill it. While the two eat the bear, they bond over their pasts and fears.\nA group of survivors inform Enrique that the hospital burnt down; since his father was in a coma, it is unlikely that he survived. Enrique falls into a deep depression and gives Marc his seeds, telling him to find Julia and save the baby. On his own, Marc ends up in a shopping center where Julia worked. He looks in the supermarket and finds a band of survivors but they are raided by another group. He finds Julia's coworker, Andrea, but she is killed by debris.

However, despite Zenigata's precautions, Lupin, disguised as Takagi, manages to steal the gem and get away.\nSimultaneously, Italian pop singer Emilio Baretti arrives in Japan to conduct a concert tour; but amidst the news coverage Conan notices Daisuke Jigen among Baretti's entourage. Ran Mouri's friend Sonoko Suzuki arranges for a pre-concert meeting with her idol in his hotel, but upon arrival they stumble upon Megure and the police in Baretti's suite, along with his manager, Claudia Belucci, and his producer, Luciano Carnevale. Baretti has received a threatening letter ordering him to cancel his concert or be killed. Despite the danger to Baretti's life, Carnevale insists that the concert take place as scheduled. When Ran and Sonoko decide to leave, Conan stays behind to look for Jigen, whom he finds acting as Baretti's bodyguard, although he evidently pursues yet another agenda.\nIn the meantime, Ran and Sonoko are suddenly joined by Baretti for a clandestine tour of Tokyo Skytree. Once there, he climbs to a high rampant in a desperate attempt to see the concert cancelled; when Ran finds him there, she begins reprimanding him, thinking he wants to commit suicide. A wind blast nearly blows them both off the tower, but they are saved by the combined efforts of Conan, Jigen and Sonoko. Chastised, Baretti confesses that Carnevale, who is affiliated with the Italian Mafia, uses his concerts as a cover to conduct illegal dealings, and therefore Baretti made up the threat to his life in order to have the Japan concert, an anacrusis for yet another deal, called off.\nEventually, Baretti's concert starts as scheduled. However, Carnevale manages to evade police surveillance and make his way to Haneda Airport, where he meets with Smithee to conduct the deal. However, it is revealed at this point that the middleman who arranged this meeting and the owner of the Cherry Sapphire were Jigen and Goemon Ishikawa; Lupin has been in fact hired by the Vespanian government to retrieve a rare piece of ore stolen by Carnevale, a mineral which enables the construction of ultimate stealth technology. Smithee, a native from the (fictional) country of Gillanba, intended to use the ore to offset the military might of a neighboring country, a purpose neither the late queen of Vespania, Sakura, nor her daughter and successor Mira have been endorsing.\nHowever, Smithee has brought heavily armed reinforcements, and despite the help of most of Conan and Lupin's friends, Smithee finds an opening which enables him to take Conan as a hostage. Smithee and Carnevale attempt to escape by plane, but Lupin boards the craft, and he and Conan prepare to take down Smithee for good. Carnevale arrives and wildly fires a minigun at them, damaging the flight controls, mortally wounding Smithee and puncturing the hull, causing himself to be sucked out by the sudden decompression. When military jets attack, intending to destroy the ore samples before they can leave the country, Lupin reveals that the Cherry Sapphire is also made from a piece of Vespanian ore. After using it successfully to thwart the missiles shot at them, Conan and Lupin abandon the crashing plane via parachute and are subsequently picked up by a submarine temporarily appropriated by Fujiko and Ai Haibara. In a post-credit scene, Conan, Ran and Haibara see Baretti off safely as he departs Japan. Lupin, in the meantime, tries to steal a national treasure from a Kansai temple, only to find Kaito Kid having already beaten him to it and alerted the police as payback for dressing up as him.", "tmdb_id": 239529}, "38094936": {"title": "Maach Mishti & More", "plot": "The film looks at a Bengali joint family of Kolkata in the present time.

The priest of that church, who seems to have known him for the past three years, asks him about his \"conspiracy\" when he says, \"Our Prime Minister could have been saved from the conspiracy\". Vikram starts narrating his story to the priest.\nThe film then moves five years back, when the continuous battle between the  Sri Lankan military forces and Tamil militant  groups had reached a dangerous level. The Tamil youth have taken weapons and joined the Liberation Tamil Front (LTF) leader Anna Bhaskaran (a character based on the real-life LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran). The Indian Prime Minister (Sanjay Gurubaxani) decides to sign a peace accord with Sri Lankan Government and said that the elections should happen there peacefully before Diwali. However, Anna refuses to accept the accord, and the Indian Peace Keeping Forces are forced to withdraw from the island.

After reporting to his senior Balakrishnan (based on real-life person K V Unnikrishnan), he tries to find someone who may help to find Shri, the only man who can withstand and oppose Anna. After meeting with an informer called Narayanan, Vikram manages to visit Shri. Vikram promises Shri to help him rise against Anna by providing him with arms. The arms deal date is decided at 6 July.

An angry Balakrishnan tells Vikram to go to Colombo Safehouse. Vikram meets Jaya to seek her help. Jaya tells him that they know his next step even before he can implement it.

The Indian government sends forces and rescues Vikram, who is badly injured. Balakrishnan tells him to leave Sri Lanka as he is on the hit-list of both camps. Vikram feels suspicious about Balakrishnan. He calls SP, one of his associates, and tells him to report all activities of Balakrishnan to him. Vikram, posing as a war correspondent, manages to reach Mallayya (based on real-life LTTE member Gopalaswamy Mahendraraja), second-in-command of Anna and persuades him to meet RD in Colombo. RD tells him that the only way this war could be won is by a political solution. He instigates Mallaya to stand up as the only champion of his people, thus dividing the LTF in two. Vikram and Indian forces then launch a massive attack on the LTF base camp where Anna and his men (minus Mallayya) were discussing strategy. A devastating gun battle begins, and Vikram returns home.

She agrees to help and later consoles Vikram about his wife.\nAs told by Jaya, Vikram reaches Bangkok, where a source of Jaya (Dibang) tells him that he has a tape. Vikram is shocked to see that Balakrishnan was honey-trapped, forcing him to divulge all the information about their movements. Balakrishnan later commits suicide by shooting himself. Back in Delhi, R&AW had decoded the intercepts and had also found out about Balakrishnan's fake passports and unknown bank accounts. RD realizes that this might be a Code Red, to assassinate the ex-Prime Minister. He asks Vikram to take care of this and tells his team to seal the coastline.

A few days later, RD too resigns, and Vikram, after taking voluntary retirement, comes to Kasauli.\nThe film comes back to the present, where the priest asks Vikram who won the battle.

He quits his job, buys his parents presents, and begins having the temple repaired. With time, Tiger develops a more efficient and brutal style. Noticing the change in him, Master Yang warns Tiger; however, intoxicated with the new life, Tiger ignores the warning. In the Wu Lin Competition, Tiger viciously injures his opponent and is disqualified. When Tiger comes back to train at the temple, a fight ensues and Master Yang is forced to use his internal Chi energies to palm-strike Tiger, reminding him that he is yet to completely master tai chi. Tiger ignores his advice to meditate, and finds out that the authority has rejected his petition to gain historical protection for the temple due to his actions at the Wu Lin Competition, which are against his temple's philosophy. An enraged Tiger demands a fight and Donaka has him face a mercenary named Uri Romanov. Using his rage, he quickly defeats Uri and almost kills him, but relents at the end. Donaka finishes off Uri. Realizing how much he has changed, Tiger declares his intention to stop participating in underground fighting and contacts Sun-Jing, unaware of the constant surveillance Donaka had put him under for a long time.\nDonaka sets up a private tournament for a death match, in which Tiger is to participate. Sun-Jing trails Tiger's escort, but her car is run off the road. Surviving the crash, Sun-Jing calls for assistance and discovers Superintendent Wong had been working for Donaka. At the tournament, Donaka plays a video composed of surveillance footage, revealing how Tiger had been manipulated, \"corrupted\" and transformed from an innocent martial arts practitioner to a ruthless fighter. Tiger refuses to fight his assigned opponent, and challenges Donaka instead. The fight is interrupted by the HKPD, who storm the compound and arrest participants and audience. Fleeing from the scene, Donaka arrives at the temple and starts fighting with Tiger. Donaka initially has the upper hand, but Tiger re-embraces his tai chi training and manages to palm-strike Donaka despite getting stabbed. A dying Donaka smiles, pleased for having pushed Tiger to become a killer. Tiger and his master then reconcile, Sun-Jing gets promoted to Superintendent and Tiger reaches an agreement with both Qing Sha's law firm and the real estate developers.

He is normally a shrewd, sophisticated and composed individual, but whenever drunk, he turns into an advocate of equality and betterment of the villagers, but regrets these thoughts when sober. When he chooses not to drink he hallucinates, as a withdrawal symptom, about a pink buffalo 'Gulabo/Aditi Arora', the mascot of the brand of alcohol he enjoys.

Not wanting to seem uncool, Kaitlan allows the boys to stay and party.\nEventually Shane suggests that they play The Midnight Game, where participants confess their deepest fears while performing a strange ritual. Anyone who performs the ritual inaccurately runs the risk of running into the Midnight Man, a terrifying figure that can bring the participants' fears to life. They must carry candles, and if the candle extinguishes then they must relight it in ten seconds or surround themselves instantly with a circle of salt, or the Midnight Man will catch them. The teenagers originally think the game sounds fun and do not take the idea of the ritual seriously, beginning the game gleefully.\nNothing happens for the first hour and a half, yet just as the group is starting to become complacent they begin to hear noises, and their candles start to go out. The boys decide to explore upstairs where they can hear unusual sounds, whilst the girls remain downstairs. Jeff and Shane discover a crucifix upstairs which unnerves them, and they are drawn back downstairs by the sound of the girls screaming; they saw a dark figure moving around outside the house. The candles all start to go out, and the group panics. Kaitlan attempts to end the game by turning on the lights, only to find that they do not work even though the power for the house is still running.\nAfter some time has passed, they eventually draw a circle of salt around themselves and huddle together, eventually falling asleep. At 3:33 AM the lights turn back on and the group awakes, thinking that the game is over. They do not realise that having failed to relight their candles in ten seconds and drawing the circle of salt well after they needed to, the Midnight Man has won the game.\nThe next morning, Rose awakes to find Jeff is gone. She goes downstairs to the kitchen, and finds that no one knows where Jeff is; Shane assumes that he has gone to basketball practice and texts him, with no response. Jenna, unprovoked, begins to verbally abuse Rose in a bout of sudden anger, accusing her of wanting to steal Shane and always trying to copy her. The others are stunned by Jenna's sudden moodswing, and later she apologises.\nShane, Kaitlan and Jenna decide to go for a hike, whilst Rose chooses to stay at the house and take a nap. On the hike, Jenna begins accusing Shane of cheating on her and acts extremely angry for no reason, until her mood suddenly changes and she is abnormally happy, seeing shapes in the clouds that do not exist and skipping along. Meanwhile, back at the house, Rose begins to hear strange noises and hallucinate unnerving things. Eventually, she walks into a room and sees the Midnight Man, a demonic pitch black figure.\nOn the hike, Shane receives a text from Rose begging him to help her, and despite Jenna screaming for no reason when he suggests they go back, he and the others return to the house to find Rose huddled in the kitchen, clutching a knife and having a panic attack from seeing the Midnight Man. Shane coaxes Rose to drop the knife, and as she does Jenna begins panicking and acting paranoid. The group deduces that this must be because of the Midnight Game, and Rose decides to go home.\nOn her way home, Rose starts to hallucinate the Midnight Man again. She sees Jeff at the side of the road and pulls over to talk to him, only to find that he is undead. Rose backs away, and is hit by a car. She then wakes up in the car and realises that this was a hallucination, and decides to go back to the house. Back at the house, Jenna has been growing increasingly panicked and paranoid, hallucinating that Shane cheated on her with Kaitlan. She breaks down, and Shane attempts to comfort her.\nThe group realise that the reason these things are happening to them is because they did not follow the rules of the Midnight Game, and they decide to play again to see if that will end the chain of horrific events. As they begin the game for the second time, Shane recalls a blog he read on the internet about a boy who did not follow the rules of the game and ended up reliving his worst fears over and over until his death, and the theories he has read that people get trapped in an endless cycle of reliving their death over and over. He fears that this will happen to them.\nAs they play the game, the candles blow out and they are unable to relight them. They intend to surround themselves with salt, but accidentally spill the salt, leaving them trapped to face the Midnight Man. Jenna goes upstairs, where she is taunted by a hallucination saying that everyone is against her and is driven to hang herself. Kaitlan is pushed off the balcony by the Midnight Man. Shane receives a text from Jeff stating he is in the basement, and discovers Jeff's corpse in a casket. When he returns to the house, Rose states that \"he is behind you'\", and he turns to see the Midnight Man.

He is instructed in how to work undercover by Special Agent Kazumi Akagiri and sent to an illegal casino run by the Akogi-gumi, an arm of the Sukiya-kai. He intentionally gets caught cheating in order to meet the boss Masaya Hiura, a.k.a. \"Crazy Papillon\", who is impressed by his humor and exchanges vows of brotherhood with him, bringing him into the Sukiya-kai. Kazumi informs Reiji that he is sure that the Sukiya-kai makes its money from selling MDMA but he cannot connect the street dealers to the yakuza. Reiji asks Hiura if the Akogi-gumi is clean and Hiura explains that his father Masayoshii Ako says that \"drugs are the root of all evil.\"\nJunna, another policewoman on the force, is upset that Reiji is not responding to her texts and angrily texts that she will not pop his cherry if he does not respond soon. Kazumi sends her to a brothel called True Love in Kabukich\u014d, where she and her fellow policewoman are recruited as escorts.

Amadeu's friends were shocked by this, especially Jorge, who at that time was already in the resistance. Later, Amadeu confronted Jorge and declared that he too would join the resistance.\nJorge introduced Amadeu to Jo\u00e3o and to his girlfriend Estef\u00e2nia, a beautiful woman with a photographic memory who helped the resistance by memorizing people's names and contact information. But Amadeu and Estef\u00e2nia were instantly attracted to each other. Jorge discovered that Estef\u00e2nia loved Amadeu and was crushed by her betrayal. When the revolution against Salazar began, Amadeu fled to Spain with Estef\u00e2nia but she refused his offer to start a new life together in Brazil. Raimund learned where she went to live and went there to find out if she was still alive. They talk and Raimund tells Estef\u00e2nia that Amadeu's death had nothing to do with her leaving Amadeu.\nThe suicidal woman from the bridge in Bern has tracked Raimund down and waits for him in the lobby of his hotel in Lisbon. She came to thank Raimund for saving her life. She tells him that she felt suicidal because she had just learned from the book that her beloved grandfather was the Butcher of Lisbon, but she is learning to accept this. Raimund had brought with him the red coat she was wearing that day in Bern and he gives it back to her.\nThe events have become a catalyst to Raimund's sedate life, in a gentle sort of way. Yet he informs the school that he will now return to his job. Mariana accompanies him to the railway station and, at the last moment, suggests that he could instead stay in Lisbon.

A year later, at the MGM Grand Las Vegas, they perform as \"The Four Horsemen\" in a show funded by insurance magnate Arthur Tressler. Their final trick appears to transport an audience member inside the vault of the Cr\u00e9dit R\u00e9publicain bank in Paris. Stacks of euros are drawn into the vault's air vents and showered on the Las Vegas crowd; the trick is shown to have actually happened as the Paris vault is found empty of its recent shipment of Euros.\nFBI agent Dylan Rhodes and French Interpol agent Alma Dray seize and interrogate the Horsemen about the robbery but, having no evidence to hold them, have no choice but to release them. They turn to Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician turned magic debunker. Thirty years ago, Lionel Shrike, a magician exposed by Thaddeus, attempted to relaunch his career, but died inside a safe during a failed escape trick. Thaddeus demonstrates how the Horsemen used a mock vault under the Las Vegas stage, and explains that they stole the money before it arrived at the bank, replacing it with flash paper designed to look like the money, which ignited when the vents were activated without creating any smoke or residue. He reveals that they manipulated the audience participant (who was intentionally selected beforehand) to attend the show, where he was hypnotized into helping to perform the final trick, also revealing that he was actually dropped into the duplicate vault below the stage.\nThaddeus and the FBI follow the Horsemen to their next show in New Orleans, where the magicians transfer more than $140 million from Tressler's private accounts to certain members in the audience, composed of people whose insurance claims were denied by Tressler's company in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Rhodes attempts to capture the magicians, but members of the audience who were hypnotized tackle him when he says a certain word, allowing the magicians to escape, and a vengeful Tressler hires Thaddeus to expose them for robbing him. Alma suspects the Horsemen are connected to \"the Eye\", a Freemason-like, elite group of magicians so skilled that many think they have access to real magic, who steal from the rich to give to the poor.

They converge on the Horsemen's final show at 5 Pointz, where the magicians appear with a farewell message to the crowd. As they leap off the roof, Alma disrupts Dylan's attempt to shoot them; the Horseman disappear in a shower of counterfeit money.\nThe real money from the Elkhorn safe is found in Thaddeus' car and he is apprehended, presumed to be an accomplice with the Horsemen. Dylan visits him in jail, and Thaddeus deduces that the Horsemen duped the FBI into following the duplicate safe, allowing Jack, who faked his death using a decoy car and a cadaver stolen from a morgue, to break into the real safe (which was in fact never stolen but was actually hidden behind a giant mirror to trick the FBI into thinking that it was indeed missing) and frame Thaddeus with the stolen money.

When Coronel and his partner, Bernabe, arrive at the local precinct, they clash with PNP Sergeant Joaquin Acosta, who believes that the case was taken from him for political reasons.\nMario and Daniel carry out a hit on a woman named Linda, whose husband Pol seeks help from Acosta, his former colleague. Pol reveals that Tiu's murder is one of several assassinations ordered by Manrique's close friend Pacheco, a military officer campaigning for the Philippine Senate. Acosta agrees to protect Pol and heads to the station; along the way, he encounters Coronel and Bernabe. Meanwhile, Daniel shoots Pol, but his pistol jams before he can fire a fatal shot. The three officers converge on them, forcing Daniel and Mario to flee, although they manage to locate and kill Pol at a hospital. As they split up to escape, Bernabe is shot and Acosta catches a glimpse of Mario's face.\nCoronel confronts Manrique and tells him that he intends to arrest Pacheco. Manrique warns Coronel that Pacheco's indictment will cause their downfall, as he considers Pacheco his last resort after having exhausted all his other options to remain affluent. Meanwhile, Acosta relays Mario's composite sketch to be broadcast on television before deciding to work with Coronel. When Coronel discovers Mario's identity, he visits Lulette and sees her flirting with Mario's friend, Boy.

Mario then phones Tina, who tells her father that she saw his police sketch and that she intends to live independently.\nTiu's father tells Acosta and Coronel that he has evidence that they can use to arrest Pacheco. Coronel goes to visit Pacheco, who admits to killing Coronel's father to \"save the country\". Coronel then uses his cellphone to secretly record a conversation between Pacheco and his men about the murder of Tiu's father.\nSoon after, Daniel kills Coronel in front of police headquarters, causing an enraged Acosta to attack Pacheco and Manrique's security detail. Meanwhile, a disheartened Mario realizes that he has no reason to leave prison since his family no longer wants anything to do with him, and stabs Daniel to death to remain incarcerated. Coronel's death prompts an investigation of Acosta, who is relieved of duty, and Pacheco, who tells journalists he is ready to be investigated. After attending Daniel's wake from afar, Mario goes home, kills Boy in front of his family, and returns to prison.\nSometime later, a recovered Bernabe looks through Coronel's possessions and requisitions the phone Coronel used against Pacheco as evidence.", "tmdb_id": 190754}, "38575912": {"title": "Onaayum Aattukkuttiyum", "plot": "A man with a gunshot wound collapses on the side of a road, where passers-by notice him but avoid taking any action.

He was wounded during a battle and sent to a medical camp, where he met fellow soldiers Ter, Puak, Shin and Aey, who later became his best friends after he had saved them from certain death.\nMeanwhile, in Phra Khanong, Nak struggled alone painfully to give birth to the baby; she calls out for help, but she is too weak to be heard. Shortly after, rumors started circulating the village that Nak had died in labor and was now a ghost of a very powerful form haunting the house. The villagers in the neighborhood then heard her singing lullabies to her baby, terrifying them and forcing them to cower in fear.\nWhen Mak and his friends arrive back in Phra Khanong in the evening, they find the town completely silent. The five soon arrive at Mak and Nak's house during the night, and Mak introduces Nak to them. As it is now too dark to continue traveling, Mak's friends decide to stay.\nThe following day, the men visit the village market but are shunned by the fearful community who refuses to sell their goods to Mak and runs away. A drunk villager attempts to shout out a warning to Mak but is forced down and hushed by her son. Mak's four friends then discuss what they had heard, but dismiss the rumors as ridiculous.\nShin, however, while he was sent to fetch Mak, saw that the house was a dilapidated wreck that hadn't been maintained for months as one of the stairs broke, that the baby cot that Mak and Nak's son, Dang, was supposed to be sleeping in, was rocking by itself, and then he saw Nak extending her arm to an unnatural length to retrieve a dropped lime under the house.\nThe following day, Ter accuses Shin of being delusional, however, while taking a dump in the forest, Ter discovers a decomposed corpse behind the house wearing exactly the same ring as Nak. The drunk villager who had also tried to warn them earlier also turned up mysteriously drowned.\nMak invites his four friends up to eat supper, in which they are given leaves and worm made by Nak. They later play charades. One of them involve a wordplay \"Phi Sua\" lit: \"Butterfly\", that requires Nak to be described as a ghost \"Phi.\" Mak then dismisses all of their warnings, proclaims that they are no longer his friends, and kicks them out of their accommodations.\nLater, Mak and Nak go out on a date in the town, visiting an amusement park. Mak's friends attempt to convince Mak that Nak is a ghost at the ferris wheel, but they and the waiting queue were chased away by Nak. They attempt the second time by capturing Mak while they were in the haunted house. This time, they were successful and capture Mak into the forest.\nSuddenly, in the forest, Mak's old wartime wound reopens. His friends express surprise at how slowly it has healed, but Shin and Ter become convinced that he, not Nak, is the ghost, and their fears are seemingly confirmed when Mak reacts in pain when they attack him with holy rice. The friends then flee from their wounded friend and rescue Nak since Phueak desires Nak's beauty.\nWhile escaping in a boat, Mak 'returns' to them, walking into the river to them, but ends up almost drowning when he suffers cramps. As ghosts are not supposed to feel cramps, Mak is revealed to not have been a ghost, and he is rescued. When asked why he screamed when hit by the holy rice, he reveals that the rice had riddled his wound, making him yell out in pain. In the following confusion in which they don't know if either Mak or Nak are ghosts or not, Aey drops a ring identical to the one Mak, Nak, and the body behind the house had been wearing. Aey is immediately pronounced a ghost and kicked off the boat. The others then try to escape, but, as they had lost the paddles to the boat earlier, they cannot move. Nak then somehow produces a soaking wet paddle and hands it to Ter, who suddenly recalls that all of them had been thrown overboard, and had already drifted too far away for a normal person to recover. Ter then stands up on the boat to look between his legs at the group; Nak is revealed to have been the ghost all along as she has extended her arm to place on Mak's shoulder.

Mak at first doesn't want to leave Nak alone but his friends knock Mak unconscious, the carry him to the temple.\nThere, the men come under the protection of the local monk, armed with holy rice, holy water, and the temple is fortified with an enchanted 'safety ring.' Nak quickly appears, in her terrifying ghostly form, and attacks. Initially, the holy 'weapons' successfully keep Nak at bay, but, in a panic, coupled with Mak's struggle to get back to his wife, all of the holy rice and water are wasted, and the monk was accidentally kicked out of the \"safety ring.\" The monk then fled the temple, leaving the four, who had since destroyed the 'safety ring' while trying to run, to face the angry Nak. A pale Aey then reappears, and it was revealed that he is also human; he was in possession of the ring because he had stolen it off of the corpse behind the house to finance his gambling. With that topic settled, they finally remember that they were supposed to flee from Nak. Nak angrily shouted at the five that she just wanted to be with her loved one, which the four friends argued against since they didn't believe the living can be with the dead, and accuse her of killing the drunk; Nak furiously denies her involvement and says that the drunk had drowned herself. Nak, in a combination of sadness, anger, and desperation, then threatens to kill Mak and take him to live with her, but stops when she sees how much she had been scaring her husband. Mak then revealed he knew the truth about Nak all along, having had his suspicions raised during the game of charades. He had already looked at Nak between his legs, which revealed her ghostly form, and found her decomposed corpse. However, even then, he is far more afraid of living without her than of her being dead. The two tearfully reconcile.

The killer makes himself known and ties Sara to her bed, asking for \"the diamond\" which Ryan stole from him. Sara is shocked by the revelation that Ryan is not the man he made himself out to be. She offers the killer, now known as Chad, the diamond, but then knocks him out and escapes the apartment. She hides in her building's basement where her friend Antonio hears her calls for help. He tries to save her but Chad slits his throat. Sara escapes to the street when she trips into the arms of Robert Hollander, who promises to keep her safe.\nThey retreat to her building and it is revealed that Chad knows Hollander and they are working together to find the diamonds.  They find a case of hundreds of thousands of dollars hidden behind a canvassed photo that Sara took. Having confirmed that Ryan was a crook, Hollander and Chad renew their efforts, certain that the diamonds are hidden somewhere in the penthouse. Hollander throws Sara's cat over the balcony in a fit of spite before locking Sara up again. She tries to reason with Chad, then turns her attentions to Hollander, desperate to end the torment.\nBlake, Sara's sister, comes over with her husband, Danny, for the party Sara was preparing for earlier. Sara gets them to leave with a story that she and Ryan are fighting, and coincidentally Blake, who is heavily pregnant, starts having contractions. Hollander sends Chad to fix him a drink while he takes Sara out to the balcony. Chad discovers the diamonds hidden within the ice cubes and hides them away before offering Hollander his drink. Chad attempts to kill Hollander but is shot by Hollander. With Hollander's attention on Chad, Sara stabs Hollander in the back with a garden shear. As Hollander grapples with Sara, Chad revives and attacks Hollander, who grabs Chad's blade and stabs him to death. Hollander searches for Sara, who has found Hollander's gun. She tries shooting him using her sense of sound, but New Year's Eve fireworks dull her senses, giving her a flashback to the moment she lost her sight in Afghanistan.\nSara manages to shoot Hollander in the arm. With the gun pointed directly at him she starts throwing the diamonds over the balcony, threatening to throw all of them away. When Hollander reacts, she is able to hear him and shoots him in the chest before pushing him off the balcony to his death.\nIt is revealed that Sara had kept the diamonds in her hand.

Her father Zeus honored her sacrifice by turning her into a tree, which forms a protective barrier around the camp, keeping everyone within a safe zone. In the present day, Percy's quest for Zeus's bolt has faded in popularity and he is called a one-quest wonder by camp bully Clarisse La Rue, but is still supported by Annabeth and Grover. He is joined at camp by a young cyclops named Tyson, a previously unknown son of Poseidon, and therefore his brother, albeit the son of Poseidon and a sea-nymph, rather than a human.\nAfter an attack by a Colchis bull, the campers discover Thalia's tree has been poisoned by Luke and the barrier is vulnerable. Percy consults the Oracle, who tells him of a prophecy of a half-blood of the eldest gods either saving or destroying Olympus. Chiron tells Percy that he is the only living human half-blood of the eldest gods, so the Prophecy may refer to him. Annabeth and Grover learn about the Golden Fleece, which has the power to heal anything and propose a quest to retrieve the Fleece and use it to heal Thalia's tree. Counsellor Mr. D claims the idea as his and chooses Clarisse to lead the quest.\nPercy and Annabeth set off without being chosen, joined by Tyson. They leave camp on the Chariot of Damnation (a New York City cab), where the three drivers (the Graeae) tell Percy more about his prophecy and coordinates for the Sea of Monsters (the Bermuda Triangle). The group are ejected in Washington D.C. for lacking drachmas, where Grover is kidnapped. The others, with the help of Hermes, track him down to Luke's yacht, the Andromeda, which they reach riding Hippokamposes. On board, they meet Luke (joined by other disillusioned demi-gods,) who reveals his plan to have Kronos the titan destroy Olympus by reviving him with the fleece and locks the group in the brig, but Percy uses his ability to manipulate water to break them free.\nEscaping the yacht, they are consumed by Charybdis, where they discover Clarisse also in the monster's stomach. They work together to escape by shooting a hole through Charybdis's gut, then chart a course to Circeland, off the coast of Florida. There they discover Polyphemus's lair, where the fleece is kept and Grover is in disguise working for the cyclops. They rescue Grover, retrieve the fleece and trap Polyphemus in his cave. Luke ambushes them and shoots at Percy with a crossbow for not handing over the fleece, but Tyson takes the bolt and falls into a roaring stream. Luke takes the fleece and the group hostage.\nAs Luke begins reviving Kronos from his sarcophagus, Annabeth encourages Percy to take leadership. The team escapes and Percy fights Luke over the fleece. Luke defeats Percy but he is saved by Tyson, who survived his injury by being healed by the water, as he is Poseidon's son. Kronos rises from the sarcophagus and consumes Luke, Grover and several other demi-gods before battling Percy. Percy realizes that his sword is the \"cursed blade\" of the prophecy and slices Kronos into pieces imprisoning the titan in the sarcophagus once again. Those eaten are regurgited with Luke landing in Polyphemus's Lair and is presumably eaten. Annabeth is impaled by the Manticore and dies in Percy's arms, but is resurrected by the fleece.\nPercy gives the fleece to Clarisse and they return to Camp Half-Blood, where she places it on Thalia's tree.

He notices this for the first time when he feels it as a little boy when his sick mother is dying of side sickness, a disease of which he was unaware. The young orphan joins an itinerant barber-surgeon who calls himself Barber. Barber teaches him the basics of medieval medicine, with services such as cupping therapy, bloodletting, and dental extraction. Even as an apprentice Rob recognizes the limitations of these simple practices. When Barber suffers from a cataract, Rob consults a Medicus for him. This Jewish doctor completely heals Barber of his cataracts. He learns a little bit of Jewish culture. He speaks with two children, Jesse and Benjamin. There, Rob sees for the first time a world map, and learns of the famous Ibn Sina, who teaches medicine in distant Kakuyid Persia. So he decides to train there to become a physician. During the Islamic Golden Age, the medicine in the medieval Islamic world is far more advanced than in Europe. The doctor, scientist and philosopher Ibn Sina teaches in Isfahan, the most important school for aspiring practitioners in the world at that time.\nRob is told Christians are forbidden to enter Muslim lands while Jews are tolerated. Upon arriving in Egypt, Rob therefore circumcises himself and calls himself Jesse ben Benjamin, pretending to be a Jew (Rob is, in fact, a Christian). In a caravan he meets Rebecca who reads to him from a book about Aladdin and Sinbad the Sailor. The caravan experiences a sandstorm, so Rob almost dies.

Lying in the street with a cut and a concussion he is found by the Guardian, so then he is taken in as a patient.\nIn a bimaristan (hospital) and madrasa (college), he is treated by Ibn Sina and admitted as a student to learn the basics of scientific medicine as well as other sciences and philosophy (including Aristotelian and Islamic philosophy). Rob learns to perform a medical history and medical examination including pulse diagnosis, the leech treatment, the use of opium, including the analgesic effect, and surgical procedures. After the Shah refuses a peace treaty with the Seljuks, the Seljuks send a man infected with the Black Death to deliberately infect the city. Thousands begin to die after being cared for by Ibn Sina and his students. Only by Rob's discovery and rapid application of basic hygienic principles, the plague is overcome. Rob suggests that oriental rat fleas may be the carriers of the Black Death, and with rat poison the pest may be suppressed. Rob is reunited with Rebecca, who has come down with the plague, and is able to bond with her since her husband temporarily abandons the city, leaving her to become sick. Rob nurses her back to health, Rebecca makes a full recovery, and she and Rob become romantically involved and engage in extramarital sex right before Rebecca must return to her husband, who has returned to the city. Rebecca is impregnated as a result, and her husband eventually discovers this, which leads to her being sentenced to death by stoning.\nThe Christian, Jewish and Islamic religions influence the evaluation of medical science, and a conflict is sparked by the ethical assessment of the autopsy on the human body. As a Zoroastrian dies of side sickness, Rob learns from him that Zoroastrianism does not prohibit an adherent from undergoing autopsy after death. Rob secretly performs an autopsy on his body to deepen his knowledge of anatomy and to discover the inflamed vermiform appendix.

Frustrated, Jebin furiously tries to complete his second novel. When Aarthi returns from Chennai, Jebin tells her about his discovery. They decide to burn all the paintings in the secret room. But almost instinctively, the secret room defends itself by toppling furniture and fittings to block their entry.\nJebin's best friend advises him to consult a renowned parapsychologist, Devanesan to find a solution. Devanesan conjectures that the villa may have the left-over negative energy of prior owners as symptoms manifest psychic phenomena. Jebin also finds the identities and whereabouts of prior owners. But all report similar grim events in their lives like infanticide, lunacy, fratricide, disease, insolvency, death, et al. Devanesan also suggests that Jebin's father may have found an outlet, in his passion for paintings, to survive this negative energy which can neither be created nor destroyed but only transferred. He then begins to conduct more experiments using a tuning fork within the villa compound. But all hell break loose midway and apparitions begin to appear. In the chaos, Jebin's best friend loses his legs. Jebin even finds some paintings depicting a man and a woman getting married, and the man eventually killing the woman. Assuming that his father predicted that he would end up killing Aarthi, Jebin sets fire to himself and the villa to prevent him from harming the girl he loves.\nWhen Aarthi sees that Jebin has taken his own life before legally marrying her, she realises she has no claim over his estate. It is then revealed that Aarthi's true intentions were indicated by the dual faced painting she liked when she visited the villa. She had hoped to secure the money Jebin would gain from his book sale and selling the villa. With Jebin dead, Aarthi quickly seduces and marries an up-and-coming movie director.\nHowever, it is revealed that Aarthi's killer in the painting that Jebin assumed was him is actually Aarthi's new husband, the movie director. Thus, it can be understood that Jebin did not realise that he too inherited his father's gift, with his second novel depicting that a \"director\" character would soon appear in the prophecy..", "tmdb_id": 236808}, "33619581": {"title": "Planes (film)", "plot": "Dusty Crophopper is a young crop duster plane who works at a cornfield in Propwash Junction, Minnesota, and practices aerobatic maneuvers in his spare time, dreaming of becoming a racer.

Dusty and Chug train for qualifiers for the upcoming Wings Around the Globe Rally. On the night before the qualifiers, Dusty asks an elderly navy war plane named Skipper Riley to teach him how to fly well, but Skipper declines. Dusty qualifies for the race on a legal technicality, as one of the planes in the qualifiers was disqualified for using an illegal fuel intake.\nSkipper decides to mentor Dusty, and discovers Dusty has a fear of heights. With training complete, Dusty travels to New York City for the race. There, he befriends a Mexican racer named El Chupacabra, who falls in love with a French-Canadian racer named Rochelle but consistently fails to woo her. Three-time defending champion Ripslinger rudely dismisses Dusty. Dusty falls in love with an Indian plane named Ishani, who becomes supportive of him. During the first leg of the race from New York to Iceland, Dusty's refusal to fly high causes him to finish in last place.\nDuring the second leg of the race to Germany, Dusty shows good sportsmanship by saving another racer, Bulldog, from crashing, winning Bulldog's respect but finishing last again. After the third leg of the race to Agra in India, Ishani invites Dusty to fly around the Taj Mahal and advises him to fly low through the Himalayas by following some railroad tracks. After flying through a tunnel (and narrowly missing a train), Dusty is in first place at Upper Mustang in Nepal, but he is upset to discover that Ishani set him up in exchange for a new propeller from Ripslinger's team, and he shuns her.\nThe fifth leg is over the Hump (the mountains between northeast India and south China) to Shanghai, where Dusty gets into first place again. He manages to help El Chupacabra win over Rochelle with a romantic song.\nIn the sixth leg of the race across the Pacific, Ripslinger, refusing to lose to a crop duster, has his minions Ned and Zed clip off Dusty's navigation antenna. Lost and low on fuel, Dusty comes across the USS Dwight D. Flysenhower, which allows him to land and refuel. On the carrier, Dusty discovers that contrary to Skipper's own descriptions, he only flew one mission during war. Before he can obtain answers, a thunderstorm strikes, and he is forced to depart by the carrier crew. However, he ends up crashing into the Pacific Ocean and is severely damaged.\nDusty is salvaged and transported to Mexico where his concerned friends are also present. Skipper confesses about the disastrous recon mission which killed the rest of his squadron when he was coaxed to lead an attack by one of the fighters. He never flew again after the navy salvaged him. Dusty considers dropping out of the race but is encouraged to continue many of his fellow competitors, who donate parts to repair the damage he sustained. Ishani also gives Dusty her new propeller, reconciling their friendship.\nRacing back to New York, Ripslinger plots to finish off Dusty again but is thwarted by Skipper, who regains his courage to fly. Dusty conquers his acrophobia when he rides a jetstream. Nearing the finish line, Ripslinger slows for the cameras, which allows Dusty to pass him and win, and Ripslinger crashes into portable toilets.

He tells his wife that he is confident the next child will be a boy, but Mehar is unsure and fearful that if she has another girl, Umber will leave her. During the birth of their fourth child, Umber takes the child from the womb and declares with happiness that it is a boy. Mehar checks the gender of the child and realizes the child is in fact a girl. Umber is declaring child to be a male because of his strong desire to have a son. She tells Umber that it is better to kill the girl child than enforcing his desire for a son on the child. Umber ignores her and happily, in his own denial, declares the new child a boy named Kanwar Singh.\nUmber fosters Kanwar as a son and wants her to gain strength, endurance and the ability to shoot a gun like a son. Kanwar has lapses of normal behavior for a girl, including crying, giggling and having her first period, which her father tries hard to repress and ignore. One time, when Kanwar goes out to play with her sisters, they end up fighting and Kanwar falls to the ground and breaks her leg. Once home and given proper medical treatment, Umber is blindingly furious at his three daughters for hurting his only \"son\".

Soon, after the wedding ceremony, Neeli learns that Kanwar does not have a penis, though she doesn't know that he is actually a girl. Umber tells her that Kanwar had an 'accident' when he was younger. Neeli is disheartened knowing that she will never be able to have children with Kanwar.

Kanwar hears the commotion and comes outside to see her father trying to rape Neeli. Kanwar cries, trying to stop her father, but Umber tells her \"it is the only way to have a son in the family\".

The torture depicted includes beatings, food deprivation and waterboarding. Apparently, he had fallen under suspicion of being a spy, for supposedly using the British news broadcast receiver as a transmitter of military intelligence.

Chin learns from the apartment's security guard, Uncle Yin, that Yang and Pak previously lived in the unit he now occupies, and that the twin ghosts haunting the apartment were students being tutored there by Yang's husband. The husband raped one of the twins and was then stabbed by the other, who herself received mortal wounds in the scuffle. The remaining twin, distraught, hung herself. These ghosts caused Yang to flee the apartment. Chin resolves to banish the ghosts so that Yang and Pak can move in with him.\nAfter Yau refuses to help, Chin returns to his room, and is ambushed by Gau, who performs a ritual on him that summons the twins. They possess Chin again and attack Gau. Yau rushes in, and together, Gau and Yau exorcise the ghosts from Chin, binding them in a cabinet. Yau instructs Gau to burn the cabinet: Gau promises to, but instead secretly keeps the cabinet.\nMeiyi, frustrated that her husband Tung has still not resurrected, demands more help from Gau. Gau admits that virgin's blood might speed the resurrection process. Uncle Yin, investigating Tung's absence, interrupts their discussion as he is suspicious of Gau's knowledge of black magic. When he asks Gau about Tung, Meiyi beats Yin to death with a pot. Later, young Pak visits Meiyi alone. Meiyi hesitates only briefly before locking the virginal Pak in the bathroom with Tung's monstrous corpse. Against Gau's instructions, Meiyi has removed the warding mask from Tung's face. Tung revives and horrifically murders the child as Meiyi listens, tears streaming down her face.\nSensing powerful evil, a vampire hunting artifact on Yau's wall begins to react. Yau rushes to Gau's apartment. He finds Gau mortally wounded, savaged by the revived Tung. Gau confesses that Tung has risen as a jiangshi and will haunt the apartment complex. Moreover, Gau was responsible for Tung's original death, having thrown him over the rails after it turned out Tung had survived the initial fall. Gau explains that he is terminally ill, and he had planned to bind the twin ghosts' souls in Tung's soulless body to gain power and extend his own life. By removing Tung's mask, Meiyi has let the jiangshi run amok. Yau alerts Chin, who rushes off to find Yang.\nYang, searching for her missing son Pak, unwittingly opens the cabinet containing the ghost twins. Invisible, they escape. Yang encounters Pak, who to her dismay is now a ghost. Enraged, she tracks down the jiangshi and attempts to destroy it using an improvised mace, but she is severely outmatched and it ultimately kills her. Chin arrives seconds later and sets the jiangshi aflame with a Molotov cocktail; while this appears to barely damage it, in the ensuing struggle the jiangshi crashes into a store of rice, and is immobilized. However, the twin ghosts appear and eagerly possess Tung's corpse. Revived, the powerful ghost-infused jiangshi easily impales Chin through the stomach with a pole and leaves him for dead.\nChin, terribly injured is found by Yau as he prepares to battle the jiangshi. Yau uses a spell to stop Chin's bleeding. Chin insists on helping, even though Yau warns him he will die. Using vampire hunting tools, Yau sets a trap that temporarily binds Tung to that location, allowing Chin to fight him. Yau uses his tools to weaken Tung, but Chin is unable to gain the upper hand before the trap expires. Yau sees that it is now dawn and drags the entangled Chin and Tung out a window, where they fall into the courtyard. The sunlight immediately begins to burn the vampire and the twin spirits are forced out. As Tung crumbles to ash, his humanity briefly returns when he witnesses Meiyi slit her own throat. Chin and Yau collapse from exhaustion.\nIn the final sequence, the audience learns that Chin was actually successful in committing suicide, and that the events the film chronicles were created by Chin's dying mind in the process leading to rigor mortis. In reality, the film's characters are people Chin passed on the way to his apartment: Yang and Pak are friendly neighbors, Meiyi is a widow admiring a picture of a late Tung, and Yau is a neighbor who rushes in too late to save the hanged Chin.

Believing her sole living son to be blessed, Mali refuses to kill him and so, she and Taitok keep it a secret from her husband, Toma (Sumrit Warin).\nSeven years later, the living twin named Ahlo (Sitthiphon Disamoe) learns that a second dam is being built, so Toma takes Ahlo to see the dam, where a video is shown, revealing that the people of Ahlo's village will have to be relocated since the valley that they live in will be flooded between the two dams. So Ahlo and his family move through the woods, taking his boat with them, after much dispute. With the help of a ploughing buffalo, they manage to get the boat half way up the hill, only for the ropes to snap, sending the boat crashing into Mali, killing her. Furious, Taitok reveals to Toma that Ahlo is a twin and that \"he should have died\".\nAfter burying Mali, Ahlo and his family ride a bus to their new village, which Taitok doesn't much like due to the running water and electricity that replaces their \"traditions\". Here, Ahlo meets a girl named Kia (Loungnam Kaosainam), who has lost her entire family (due to malaria) and now lives with her uncle, Purple (Suthep Po-ngam), who is a fan of James Brown. Kia shows Ahlo soft land for him to grow mangoes on, which he wishes to do in honour of his mother, but Toma forbids Ahlo from associating with them, making Ahlo destroy Toma's model house out of anger. He then visits Kia and Purple again and learns that all the electricity that was promised to the people are being used by the \"hydro bosses\". The following night, Ahlo sneaks out and attempts to get electricity for the people by hooking up some cables to the main power source, but owing to his bad luck, he ends up causing a blackout for everyone else except for Kia and Purple, who have electricity for their television set. The next day, Ahlo tells Kia about his tribe's tradition about being a cursed twin.

Along with Kia and Purple, they all sneak out of the village in a cart filled with undetonated bombs from the war or UXO.\nThey journey for days and eventually arrive at Purple's village, which they call Paradise, which seems to have no other inhabitants. Ahlo and Kia run off into the bushes to play, but Ahlo almost sets off a bomb in the event of smashing fruit that Kia threw to him. Toma proposes moving again due to the land being surrounded by these dangerous bombs (which explains why there are no other inhabitants). While journeying for yet another home, Ahlo and company cross paths with a parade of travelers, where he hears an announcer mention a rocket competition that gives out cash prizes. While settling down, they are met by the village chief who tells them that the purpose of the contest is to launch them into the clouds in which they'll explode and produce rain. Believing this could break his curse, Ahlo announces his intentions to build a rocket and enter the contest to earn the money for them to buy a new home, but Toma and Taitko won't allow him, due to his presumed bad luck. Ahlo nevertheless still decides to build his own rocket and runs off.\nWhile walking through the woods in search of things to build his rocket with, Ahlo comes across another unexploded bomb, but its hard casing proves to be usable for a rocket, but blows up seconds after Ahlo hits it with a rock; he survives. Later, Ahlo manages to get Purple (who turns out to be a former soldier) to help him build the rocket. Purple takes Ahlo to a bat cave to collect bat droppings that, according to Purple, can be used for blasting up the rocket. Inside the cave, Ahlo comes across a woman who considers him to be an evil spirit, causing him to run out of the cave screaming.\nThe rocket festival begins the next day. While some people are launching their rockets, Ahlo is still in the woods trying to put his together. He grinds the bat droppings into powder, but tests it out on a few mini rockets, to no avail, so Ahlo tries urinating on the bat dropping powder (advised by Purple, who said that can make it work better). In the contest, Toma launches his rocket, named Lucky, but lets go of it too soon and launches it poorly. A champion rocket named The Million is launched afterwards which successfully reaches the clouds. Ahlo brings his rocket in, which he calls The Bat, but the announcer tells him that kids aren't allowed to launch. Ahlo asks Toma to launch it, but Taitko doesn't allow him to, believing that The Bat will blow everyone up because of Ahlo's bad luck. Nobody else volunteers to do so and Ahlo then runs off. Toma decides to launch it anyway. Kia catches up to Ahlo and tells him what his father is doing, and so he runs back to the contest, thinking the rocket will kill Toma, and shouts his apology over the loud roaring of the rocket.

As they are surrounded, the man Paul reassures his companion that Gwendolyn will be safe, that Grace will protect her. Just as the men are about to kill them, Paul and the young woman activate the device and disappear in a swirl of energy.\nWe fast-forward sixteen years to the day before Gwendolyn \"Gwen\" Shepherd's sixteenth birthday. Gwen belongs to a very snobbish aristocratic London family. Most of the family members dress as if it were the nineteenth century, and they don't believe in associating with \"commoners.\" This makes them look down at Gwen, because Gwen and her mother Grace and brother Nick are the only \"normal\" members of the family.\nThe family is gathered at her grandmother's London castle giving a party to honor Gwen's cousin Charlotte, who is one day older than her. The family has always regarded Charlotte as something very special, as she had inherited a genetic mutation that for some secret reason makes her extremely valuable. Gwen's great-aunt Maddy says that the gene is a hereditary ability to travel back in time, inherited by only one female per generation, but Maddy's obsession with the supernatural makes Gwen not take her information very seriously.\nAt the party, Charlotte is even more snooty than usual and taunts Gwen that she will never get a date for the school ball. Gwen is attracted to the \u00fcber-handsome Gideon de Villiers, but he brushes her off and only has eyes for Charlotte. When Charlotte suddenly suffers from dizzy spells and everyone makes a big fuss about her. Charlotte's mother has her wrapped in a special dress and Gideon rushes her off to the mysterious secret society. Great-aunt Maddy tells Gwen more about the Order of Count Saint Germain and the time travel gene. Gideon apparently is a carrier of the same gene. Charlotte is inducted by the Guardians into the Order. They think she is the \"Ruby,\" the long-prophesied last time traveler.\nShortly thereafter, Gwen also starts having fainting spells and begins seeing ghosts. She goes out to get some fresh air and literally stumbles into the nineteenth century. The only person she tells about this brief leap in time is her best friend Leslie, who quickly recognizes that Gwen must be the one who inherited the time travel gene, instead of Charlotte. Gwen makes several more uncontrolled leaps in time and begins to learn about a conflict between her family and the members of the Order. Gwen finally tells her mother Grace about her time travels, who recognizes that she is the Ruby and immediately brings her to the Order to get help in controlling her time travel.\nThere, Gwen is not believed. Her aunt, Charlotte's mother, thinks that this is a desperate attempt to be the center of attention, and the Order's guards, in turn, fear a conspiracy, since decades ago Grace helped the previous time travelers, Lucy and Paul, escape. But most importantly, Gideon de Villiers, the male gene carrier of her generation, also known as Diamond, clearly does not want to work with Gwendolyn because he and Charlotte are close and they have been training together for years for their mysterious \"mission.\" Only Mr. George, a formerly close friend of her deceased grandfather, and Madame Rossini, who makes the authentic costumes for the planned time travel, are friendly and understanding toward her. Charlotte is also extremely upset about being replaced by Gwen.\nEventually it is confirmed that Gwen is the last of a total of twelve time travelers, the so-called Ruby. But Gwen has doubts about the Order and the mission and the Chronograph, with which the Order can control the time traveling of the twelve travelers. Apparently Lucy helped steal the Chronograph because she was afraid of a terrible power it held. Gwen still is unsure what exactly is going on, but at the Order, she is given an unlimited spending account, and Gideon is warned to keep an eye on Gwendolyn, and is also warned against any love affairs between the two time traveling families. Gwen overhears him say that she is definitely not his type.\nDue to the theft of the previous chronograph by Gwen's cousin Lucy, blood samples have to be collected from all of the formerly living carriers to finish a second device. But Gideon was unable to collect blood from Lady Tilney, Gwen's great-great-grandmother, as she knows Gwendolyn's name and will only cooperate with Gwendolyn. When Gideon and Gwen visit Lady Tilney in 1912, Lucy and Paul suddenly appear, warning Gwendolyn of the dangers of finishing the Chronograph and of the Count's plans to sacrifice her life to achieve his goals. Gideon overpowers Paul and the butler and runs away with Gwen. Back in the 21st century, Gwen takes Gideon out to a \"common\" restaurant for some Indian food, which is a new experience for him.\nBack at headquarters, only Gwendolyn believes in Lucy and Paul's sincerity, while the Guardians are convinced of a plot by the Florentine Alliance that has been fighting the Count of Saint Germain for centuries. Falk de Villiers, grandmaster of the lodge, wants to control Gwen and is worried about her curiosity, but Gideon starts having some twinges of doubt. Charlotte taunts Gwen with her close relationship with Gideon. Gwen breaks the Order's vows of secrecy and shares about her experiences with her friend Leslie. Charlotte recruits a teacher at the school, who is a secret member of the Order, to stop them. Gideon picks Gwen up at the school with a limo, which impresses her classmates.\nGwen goes to meet with the Count of Saint Germain in 1782. He is able to read minds but is not impressed with Gwen and will not answer her questions. The Count wonders what the Ruby's special magic is. Gwen does not know. When she talks about the future to his companions, he chokes her Darth Vader style and warns her not to break his rules. Gwen questions Gideon about his blind obedience to the Order even though he knows little about their goals.\nOn the way back, their carriage is attacked in Hyde Park. During the fight, Gwen saves Gideon's life, and he is forced to reevaluate how he sees her. Gwen wants to run away from the Order but Gideon says they can't because the Order \"owns\" them. Ultimately he decides to search with her for answers. He kisses her as thanks for saving his life, which Charlotte observes from a window.\nAt night, they sneak into the Order's archives to find an ancient prophecy about themselves, but the secret documents were transferred to a bank years ago. Using a note from Gwen's grandfather, they convince Mr. George to help them travel to 1942 to find the documents. In 1942, they read the prophecy about how Gwen's death as the Ruby (a.k.a. \"the Raven\"), bleeding out in the snow, will bring the circle of the twelve to completion. The last part of the prophecy is torn off and missing. Security guards break in, and in trying to escape, Gwen falls many stories to the ground from the top of the observatory tower. After being unconscious for some time in the snow-covered courtyard, Gwen wakes up in a pool of her own blood. The Count then comes in spirit form to confront her. Meanwhile, Gideon is thrown into the dungeon. The ghost of a little boy whom Gwen has been seeing throughout the movie appears and helps keep Gwen discover that Lucy's talisman she has been carrying is actually a key to help her get into the building and stay alive.\nAgain in the present, Gwen is found unconscious from hypothermia. Falk de Villiers quotes the prophecy of her icy death and tries to prevent any efforts to save her life. But Gideon defies this instruction and carries Gwen in the doctor's room. When she recovers, he promises her to always take care of her.\nGwendolyn goes to the big school ball wearing her cousin Lucy's dress and being accompanied by Gideon. She discovers from a family photo that the little boy she has been seeing is her grandfather's dead younger brother, and she concludes that her ability to see ghosts could be the special \"magic of the raven.\" At the ball Gideon and Gwen share a kiss while a ghost dances nearby.

Alex sees the poster in the police station and notices the picture bears a striking resemblance to Katie. He confronts her, causing a huge fight which ends in their breakup and her moving out.\nAs Katie is about to leave town, Alex intercepts her, saying he has fallen in love with her, begging her not to leave and promising to keep her safe. Katie reluctantly returns his love, and decides to stay in Southport (though still apprehensive of bringing danger upon his family). She tells him that she fled there to escape her abusive and alcoholic cop husband. They got in a big fight and she stabbed him in self-defense before fleeing in a panic.\nMeanwhile, Kevin is suspended for creating the false wanted posters - for crimes that were not committed - and for drinking on the job. He turns out to be Katie's (Erin's) husband, still alive and well. A flashback reveals that on the night Katie ran away, she stabbed Kevin with a knife when he attacked her in a drunken rage. Enraged, he breaks into Katie's former neighbor's home in Boston and gets the phone number to the restaurant where Katie works. Arriving in time for the town's Fourth of July parade, a severely intoxicated Kevin sees Katie kissing Alex, which enrages him. That evening, Katie has a dream that she is standing on the docks watching the fireworks when Jo comes up and tells Katie that \"he\" is here. Katie wakes up in the convenience store next to a sleeping Lexie when Kevin suddenly appears and confronts her, demanding that she go back with him. She refuses and tells him to leave. Kevin pulls a gun and pours gasoline all over the store, with the intent to burn it down.\nKatie buys time by faking sympathy and agreeing to go back with him. When he lets his guard down, she pushes him into the water. A firework spark lands on the gasoline, igniting a fire that engulfs the store. Alex sees the burning store, quickly crosses the harbor by boat, and saves Lexie. Meanwhile, as Katie tries to fight off Kevin, the gun goes off and kills him.\nAfter the fire, Alex recovers several letters written by his late wife Carly before she died. They were prepared ahead of time for memorable events such as Josh's eighteenth birthday and Lexie's wedding day. He also reconciles with Josh.\nJo later tells Katie that she will be leaving Southport soon. Katie thanks her for being a good friend and Jo tells her, \"You deserve this, Katie. You belong here.\"\nAlex gives Katie a letter with the words \"To Her\" on the envelope. It explains that Alex must be in love to have given her the letter and she hopes that she feels the same, wishing that she could be there with them. Enclosed with the letter is a photo of Alex's late wife. Katie realizes that her neighbor \"Jo\" was the ghost of Carly watching over them.", "tmdb_id": 112949}, "37327415": {"title": "Sahasam (2013 film)", "plot": "2003: A Pakistani archaeologist, Dr. M. Alam Siddiqui, after seeking permission from the Government of Pakistan, starts researching the hidden treasure of King Kanishka, whose treasure map is hidden in an old box whose key is a Garuda locket, which was last seen in the research books of David, a British archaeologist. His team, led by Siddiqui and Dilawar, tries hard to search for the key as they find the box in an old market in Pakistan. Fate takes a reverse turn as a dreaded terrorist named Sultan, along with his men visit the archaeology department. Sultan coerces Siddiqui, takes the box away from him, and makes all the people his slaves until Siddiqui finds the treasure and hands over it to Sultan.\n2013: In Hyderabad, Gautham Kumar Varma is a brave money-greedy security guard, who wants to make easy money and settle in life. His motto is that he would not take even a crore if it is not his, but would never let go of even a penny if it is his. Gautham spends his time testing his fortune by buying lottery tickets and using gadgets that bring luck, but sadly, both end up giving nothing to him. His friends, who are four kids, live along with him in the slum colony. Once they ask him to show a 1000 rupee note out of curiosity, to which Gautham agrees. The next day the ATM's cash cartridge is being refilled, and Gautham requests the officials to show a 1000 rupee note to the kids. They accept and show a note. \nMeanwhile, a gang of thieves comes and robs the ATM. Gautham catches the criminals and hands over the money, but since the CCTV footage shows that Gautham's request was the reason for it, he is posted to a dumping yard, where he would work for nearly 12 hours. The night when Gautham returns from his duty, a heavy rain drenches the colony and the roof in his room falls. From the roof, he finds a diary, an old empty bag on which \"Pushkalavathi Jewelers, Peshawar\" is printed, a Garuda locket, two magnifying lenses, and a small stone with a design. He opens the diary and starts reading, which is narrated by his grandfather Satyanarayana Varma. On the day of India-Pakistan, partition activists were attacking rich men and looting them. \nAfter finding no resort to hiding, Satyanarayana Varma packs all his jewelry and diamonds and rushes out to a cave which is rumored to be a king's escape runway. After reaching the spot, he rests at a place keeping his bag on a door of an inlet. A bag with diamonds falls into one of the birds attached, thus opening the inlet and the bags entering the inner space. He tries hard to get it back but removes the bird from there and falls into an abyss. However, he survived. There was a promissory note that 900 Diamonds of his would-be inherited by his grandson. Gautham sets to Pakistan with the help of Sreenidhi, an ardent Hindu devotee who wishes to visit the Hinglaj Mata temple in Pakistan.\nThere, Gautham and Sreenidhi, along with Indian security contractor Khayamat Raju, reach the Hinglaj Mata Temple. There, Gautham finds his grandfather's name on a slab and two dwellers inform him that archaeologists searched for this person. He goes to the archaeology department, where Thilavar is now in charge after the brutal murder of Siddiqui, shows the empty bag to them, and finds that the address would be in Peshawar. Meanwhile, Gautham sees the Garuda locket sketch on the research papers and shows the locket to them. Thilavar offers him money, gold, and many things in return for this locket as per Sultan's orders, but Gautham neither accepts to take any one or all of them nor accepts to give away the locket concerning his motto. He escapes from them, and along with Sreenidhi and Khayamat Raju, goes away to a safe place.\nMeanwhile, Sreenidhi is made prey to a Buzkashi game with a rule that the one who parks her in the goal would marry her. A masked Gautham joins them, and after stiff competition, he wins the match by parking her, thus making her fall for him. They move to Peshawar to a local hospital, where they join Khayamat Raju with fake injuries and rest there that night. The next morning, Gautham starts searching in the streets of Peshawar Markets for his grandfather's address only to be kidnapped by terrorists. Then he is brought before Sultan, who asks Gautham to submit the Garuda locket to which he responds, saying that he would not give it to Sultan or anyone as it is his. They torture him, trash him, and injure him severely, only to make him much more determined not to give it to Sultan. \nSultan orders Thilavar and his men to take him away to Peshawar and kill him. In transit, Gautham kills most of them, leaving Thilavar and three others and escaping to Peshawar in a bus. He reaches to the hospital, where he learns from Khayamat Raju that a girl kidnapped Sreenidhi and gave her an address to meet her. He goes to the address and frees Sreenidhi. He then ties up the kidnapper with a rope, only to know that she is Siddiqui's daughter Zara whose ambition is to hand over the treasure of Kanishka to the Pakistan Government as per her father's wish. Now, Gautham, Zara, and Sreenidhi learn that the box containing the map is in Sultan's house, where Gautham goes along with Zara. There, Gautham breaks the power supply, kills a Jihadi, wears his dress, and finds the box.\nHowever, the power is on now, and Thilavar takes Gautham to the living room, where Sultan and his men are waiting. They dress him with a bomb with a piston to activate it. They remove his mask and find out that it was Gautham, only to be threatened by him to leave him or else all would be destroyed along with the box. He reaches out, ties the piston with a wire, carefully removes the bomb from his back with the help of Zara, and both escape from there with the box. They use the Garuda locket and take the map, which indicates a place near Hinglaj Mata Temple. The trio reaches there, and according to the map, there were five wheels to be arranged in a particular order. After arranging them correctly, the water in the well goes down through a spiral staircase, leading to a huge old door. \nSultan arrives at the spot, and to save themselves, Gautham throws the map into the abyss, thus making the trio the only source to reach the place. Gautham removes a metal flower from one of the wheels, and all go into the door with some of them dying to fall into the abyss. They reach an old bridge which starts breaking while all are in a midway. The bridge breaks into nearly two parts, one on which the terrorists are there, one on which Gautham is there, and the last on which Zara, Sreenidhi, and Sultan are there. To sustain on the bridge, Sultan kicks Zara into the abyss with the flow of water, and she is pronounced dead. Gautham connects the two bridges with the help of a rope, and all of them, including Sreenidhi and Sultan, enter the next phase. The next phase is the way to the inlet where the bird used to be there. \nUsing two metal flower arrangements, a way is made due to movements of levers and wheels, and all go to the inlet. Gautham keeps the bird there, and a circular door with a small hole appears. The metal flower of the previous wheel is arranged there as a key, and all of the people enter the next phase: walking through a deep tunnel behind the circular door. They enter another room with a drum surrounded by nearly hundreds of metal chains surrounded in a circular curtain fashion with sharp metal weapons, and they start rotating round as they are sound-sensitive. Gautham, after severe struggles, enters the middle chain and removes the trident lock, making a metal ball fall on the drum. Due to opposite vibrations, the chains restore their position. They enter the last phase by a circular staircase.\nGautham, Sreenidhi, Sultan, Thilavar, and some terrorists enter a room. The tiles are arranged with a land mine system where some creatures are painted. If one would stand in the wrong place, then they would be killed by the sharp arrows projected from the mouths of sculptures on both walls. Gautham arranges the trident on a platform, due to which the land mine system is deactivated and the mouths of the sculptures are sealed by metal plates. Everyone goes toward the room, and a fight starts between the terrorists and Gautham. While most of the terrorists die, one accidentally kicks the trident, once again reverting the changes. Thilavar and Gautham are on the sculptures, and at the right time, Gautham attacks Thilavar with war equipment, thus deviating him from the place and resulting in his death due to the arrows. \nGautham then risks reaching Sultan, who threatens to kill Sreenidhi and attacks him. By the time Sultan raises a sword on Gautham, Zara shoots Sultan with a gun and rearranges the trident. She tells later that she fell in a place where there were no rocks and reached the other shore of the flow and reached the chamber through another stairway. The trio rejoices as they see the treasure in front of them. Gautham becomes the proud owner of 900 diamonds of his grandfather, and Zara fulfills Siddiqui's last wish by handing over the entire wealth to the Pakistan Government after Gautham refuses to take any one single coin of it as it belongs not to him, but the Government of Pakistan.", "tmdb_id": 208417}, "37969677": {"title": "Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster Returns", "plot": "The Royal Scandal, the war for power, and fight for money continue with the return of Saheb Biwi Aur Gangster.

Sakthi is a jungle trekker who spends his time bringing groups of tourists on trips into the jungle.\nAlmost immediately, the story changes track and introduces Sakthi\u2019s girlfriend, Rupa. The lovers soon part ways, citing compatibility issues where Rupa complains that Shakthi is not the loving boyfriend she wanted. Sakthi's character is as such that he does not remember even a single detail in their love life that Rupa deems important. Rupa tells Sakthi that he does not seem to have the time for a girlfriend and that he does not even care to do so. Rupa further aggravates the situation by asking Sakthi to close his eyes and tell her the colour of the dress she was wearing right then, but Sakthi finds that he could not. Grieved, Rupa leaves Sakthi, saying this was his character and that he would not change.\nAfter three months, Sakthi still had not recovered from his break-up. However, he receives a courier from his girlfriend saying that she misses him, and a flight ticket to Bangkok, where she resides now. Sakthi is overjoyed and leaves for Bangkok. Being his first trip to a foreign country, Sakthi seeks help from his co-passenger Maya. They end up becoming friends, and Sakthi tells Maya about his lady love.\nIn Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, Sakthi and Maya part ways, and Sakthi makes his way to the Buddhist Temple where Rupa had written in the letter that she would meet him at. Although he waits for hours, Rupa doesn't turn up. At night, IPS Officer Muthumaran checks on him, saying that he wasn't allowed to stay at the temple at night. Upon learning that Sakthi is a Tamilian just like himself, he offers him a place to stay while Sakthi finds his girlfriend. However, Muthumaran does imply that he does not trust women and that Sakthi should not get his hopes up high that Rupa will come looking for him. Another day, in a case of mistaken identity, Sakthi gets caught up in the middle of a shootout between two gangs, one intent on protecting him and the other seemingly hell-bent to riddle him full of holes. As the gang protecting Sakthi gain the upper hand in the firefight, they whisk him away to a posh hotel in a luxury car. Sakthi is confused and doesn\u2019t understand why he was dragged off.\nA magazine in the seat next to him in the car attracts his attention, and to his shock, Sakthi sees an exact look-alike on the cover of the magazine. It turns out that his doppelg\u00e4nger, remarkably also named Sakthi, is a multi-millionaire tycoon who is adored by many and targeted by a few in Bangkok. He doesn\u2019t know how to prove his identity as everything stands against him. Things get bizarre as Trekker Sakthi has been forcefully dropped into the role of Tycoon Sakthi and situations seem to prove him as someone he was not.\nIn the hotel, Trekker Sakthi argues with the Tycoon Sakthi's personal assistant Manohar about his true identity. He takes out his passport and shows it to Manohar. An amused Manohar gives the passport back to Trekker Sakthi and asks if it was true that he was merely the son of a forest ranger, why would he have multiple visas of so many countries, which was expected in a businessman's passport. To his horror, Trekker Shakthi finds that his ordinary, rarely travelled Indian passport has inexplicably turned into a Thai passport with visas to several countries like Australia, New Zealand and the United States. Sakthi enlists the help of Maya, who brings him to a branch of Bangkok Bank to recover his details, hoping there would be a discrepancy somewhere to help Trekker Sakthi prove he was not Tycoon Sakthi.\nIn a turn of events, when Trekker Sakthi signs his signature to access the Tycoon's bank account balance hoping that his different signature might be proof enough, the bank's security system shows that his signature was an exact match \u2013 and that he had a little over half a billion US dollars in his account. At this juncture, even Maya starts to suspect that both Sakthis are the same person. Sakthi gets further and further mangled in more trouble with his assumed identity.\nAfter a long cat and mouse game, Sakthi spots Manohar again, not in a business suit as before, but as a pimp in the streets. Sakthi gives chase and beats him up enough to find out the truth \u2013 that he was being played by two ruthless, psychotic businessmen watching his every move through hidden cameras, who have orchestrated all the bizarre situations Sakthi had found himself in before Manohar reveals the names he is shot and falls into the hole. Shakthi is blamed for the murder, and the police do not believe his situation. Shakthi learns that Rupa had never written the letter.

The following morning Yang and Pan meet with the emperor about the issue; Yang executes 30 whiplashes to his young sons as punishment. Later, Song's border stations are burned, signaling an invasion from the Khitan-ruled Liao regime.\nThe Khitan army hopes to take its revenge on the Yang Clan and their followers for a past defeat that killed a Khitan general ten years previously. It was noted that the leader of the invading Khitan army is Yel\u00fc Yuan, son of the deceased Khitan general. Due to politics and Pan Bao's death, Pan Renmei is awarded with 50,000 troops to repel the Khitan army. As punishment, Gen. Yang is given a lesser task\u2014to lead the charge and be the scout. When the two armies meet, Pan Renmei's lack of experience and inept leadership causes chaos among the Song army, and the Khitan forces emerge with a decisive victory. All the while Gen. Yang is trapped behind enemy lines in an abandoned town in front of Wolf Mountain. The Khitan army surrounds the town, allowing no one to leave. Pan, however, refuses to send troops to rescue Yang as revenge. This leaves Yang Ye's wife, She Saihua, devastated as she sends her seven sons to rescue him.

Lamon was a tall, boisterous Southerner who liked to drink whiskey, tell jokes and stories, play the banjo, and wrestle. Despite some pronounced differences between the two men, they shared a fondness for telling jokes and stories, and both felt slavery should be eliminated. Lamon often served as Lincoln's private confidant.\nThe film jumps from their initial meeting to Lincoln's presidency and the repeated attempts that were made on his life. Many well-known incidents are recounted, including the plot to kill Lincoln in Maryland, while he was traveling to Washington, D.C. after his first election \u2013 Lamon worked with Allan Pinkerton, who founded the famous Pinkerton Detective Agency, to thwart that plan. Other events include the time a bullet went through Lincoln's hat while he was riding his horse late one evening \u2013 he blamed it on a hunter firing an errant shot, but Lamon saw it as a sign that Lincoln was in mortal danger and needed even tighter security. Lamon was said to sometimes sleep by Lincoln's bedroom door, a striking image that appears in the film.\nThemes in the story involve Lincoln's anguish over Civil War casualties, his conflicts with members of his cabinet, and the death of the Lincolns' son Willie, which drove Mary Todd Lincoln to the depths of despair.

L.\" Travers to travel to Los Angeles and meet with Walt Disney, who has pursued the film rights to her Mary Poppins stories for twenty years after having promised his daughters to produce a film based on the books. Travers has steadfastly resisted Disney's efforts, fearing what he will do to her character. Having written nothing new and her book royalties dried up, she risks losing her house. Russell reminds her that Disney has agreed to two major stipulations (no animation and unprecedented script approval) before she finally agrees to go.\nFlashbacks depict Travers' difficult childhood in Allora, Queensland, Australia in 1906, which became the inspiration for much of Mary Poppins. Travers idolized her loving, imaginative father, Travers Robert Goff, but his chronic alcoholism resulted in his repeated dismissals, strained her parents' marriage and caused her distressed mother's attempted suicide. Goff died from tuberculosis when Travers was seven years old. Prior to his death, her mother's stern, practical sister came to live with the family and later served as Travers's main inspiration for the Mary Poppins character.\nIn Los Angeles, Travers is annoyed by what she perceives as the city's unreality and the overly-perky inhabitants, personified by her friendly limousine driver, Ralph. At the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, Travers meets the creative team who are developing Mary Poppins for the screen: screenwriter Don DaGradi and songwriters Richard and Robert Sherman. She finds their presumptions and casual manners highly improper, a view that she also holds of the jocular Disney.\nTravers' working relationship with Disney and his team is difficult from the outset, with her insistence that Mary Poppins is the enemy of sentiment and whimsy. Disney and his people are puzzled by Travers' disdain for fantasy, given the nature of the Mary Poppins story, as well as Travers' own rich imagination. She particularly objects to how the character George Banks, the children's estranged father, is depicted, insisting that he is neither cold nor cruel. Gradually, the team grasp how deeply personal the Mary Poppins stories are to Travers and how many of the characters were inspired by her past.\nThe team acknowledges that Travers has valid criticisms and make changes, although she becomes increasingly disengaged as painful childhood memories resurface. Seeking to understand what troubles her, Disney invites Travers to Disneyland, which, along with her developing friendship with Ralph, the creative team's revisions to the George Banks character and the addition of a new song and a different ending, help dissolve Travers' opposition. Her creativity reawakens, and she begins collaborating with the team. Soon afterward however, Travers is enraged to discover an animation sequence has been added. Travers confronts Disney over this and returns home without signing the agreement.\nDisney learns that \"P. L. Travers\" is a pen name, taken from Travers' father's given name. Her real name is Helen Goff and she is Australian, not English. That gives Disney new insight into Travers, and he follows her to London. Arriving unexpectedly at her home, Disney shares his own less-than-ideal childhood but stresses the healing value of his art. He urges Travers not to let deeply-rooted past disappointments dictate the present. That night, after Disney has left, Travers finally relents and grants the film rights to Disney.\nThree years later, in 1964, Travers has begun writing another Mary Poppins story, while Mary Poppins is to have its world premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood. Disney has not invited Travers, fearing how she might react with the press watching. Prompted by Russell, Travers shows up unannounced at Disney's office; he reluctantly issues her an invitation. Initially, she watches Mary Poppins with a lack of enthusiasm, particularly during the animated sequences.

Her defense lawyer Zhou Li and prosecutor Tong Tao gains in-depth understanding through cross-examinations in court.\nIn the first act, when Yang Dan's personal chauffeur, Sun Wei, was examined by Zhou Li, she lured him to confess that he was actually the one that killed Yang Dan. This allegedly happened after Lin Mengmeng had fled the scene after knocking Yang Dan's down with her red Cayenne SUV. Zhou Li got him to confess through a series of questions that got him to also confess his wife was having an affair with Meng Meng's father, Lin Tai. Everything seems logical at that time and the court and media were satisfied that the chauffeur Sun Wei was the killer.\nHowever, Tong Tao, who had been going after Lin Tai ever since he was called to bar as a legal prosecutor, found something to be amiss. He got his staff to verify that Sun Wei was terminally ill with brain cancer and hence surmised that Lin Tai must have bribed Sun Wei and got Zhou Li to lead everyone to believe Sun Wei was the killer.\nIn the next court session when Lin Tai was examined, Tong Tao and his staff got an anonymous email that claimed that the sender had video evidence of the murder of Yang Dan. The video was sent over just as Tong Tao and his team came into court for the cross-examination of Lin Tai. But the video self-deleted, hampering it from being presented in court. Tong Tao immediately asked for a recess on the pretext that he had new evidence to reorganise and present to the court. When the court session resumed, Tong Tao took an aggressive stance to cross-examine Lin Tai, and used the infidelity of Yang Dan to spite Lin Tai, insinuating that Lin Tai was made a cuckold by Yang Dan. Surprisingly, this tactic worked and in his agitated state, Lin Tai shouted that he was actually with his daughter in the SUV at the day of the murder. While his daughter had knocked down Yang Dan, it was Lin Tai that got off the car and pushed Yang Dan against the wall, and her head went onto a nail, which killed her. The whole court was in an uproar. Lin Tai was hence detained. His daughter, Mengmeng was also released, having been acquitted of her crime.\nNearing the trial of Lin Tai, Zhou Li revealed to the audience that her team was the one that had gotten hold of the video and had sent it to Tong Tao's team. This video was in turn given to her team via an anonymous source. As she was comparing this video, which was shot at an angle different from the security camera feed that was overlooking the scene, she noticed that the movement of Sun Wei's leg was inconsistent. This led her to believe that the video was shot after the murder had happened. She immediately asked her staff to investigate whether Lin Tai had carried out a massive renovation job within the last few months and also whether he had purchased a lot of second-hand vehicles. Her line of query turned fruitful and led her to a deserted factory in the Su Province. She transgressed into the factory and discover the interior had been modelled after the car park where the murder of Yang Dan had happened. This confirmed her hunch that Lin Tai shot the video in the aftermath of the murder to stage the idea that he was the one that committed the murder instead of his daughter.\nTong Tao also has his suspicion when he revealed the court footage of Lin Tai confessing the murder of Yang Dan. Lin Tai, at that time, made reference that he would not allow himself to be convicted by Tong Tao in front of the \"Dragon Back Wall\". Unable to fathom what this meant, Tong Tao visited Lin Tai's hometown and spoke to an old villager. The old person explained the significance of the \"Dragon Back Wall\", telling the story of how, in ancient China, the local dragon king took the place of his dragon son that had committed grave atrocities, and gave himself up to the heavenly warriors that were there to punish the young dragon son. The local mountain where this allegedly happened was hence referred to as the \"Dragon Back Mountain\". When Tong Tao was returning to town, he received a call from Meng Meng and the audience was led to note that the call was from Meng Meng, who supposedly called to confess her father's plot to save her.

However, Suspicious Smurf begins to wonder where Brainy is, since he hasn't shown up with his bucket of smurfberries. Realizing that he may be found out for cheating, Gutsy goes out into the forest alone to find Brainy, but is soon joined by Smurfette (Voiced By Melissa Sturm), who finds out from Gutsy that Brainy is in Smurfy Hollow. They both go together and find Brainy in a cage trap set up by Gargamel, only to soon join him in cage traps of their own. Azrael (Voiced By Frank Welker), who was prowling the forest by himself, is soon alerted to the Smurfs' presence and goes to get his master to inform him of the captured Smurfs.\nGutsy, Brainy, and Smurfette work on a plan to get themselves out of their cages, and soon Gutsy swings his cage repeatedly until it bumps into Brainy's, which then bumps into Smurfette's, and the cages continue to bump into each other until Gutsy's and Brainy's cages break, freeing them. However, Smurfette is still stuck in her cage, and Gutsy and Brainy try to figure out how to get her out of there when Gargamel appears with Azrael, and so they go into hiding while the evil wizard opens the cage to deal with the one Smurf that is still captured.\nBut soon the five of them have a new problem to deal with\u2014the presence of the Headless Horseman, who rides around looking for his next victims. They start running for their lives toward the covered bridge, which legends say is the only thing that keeps the Headless Horseman trapped in Smurfy Hollow. But as the Smurfs see that they would not get to the covered bridge in time to escape from the Headless Horseman, they hitch a ride on the back of a bat and fly to the top of the covered bridge, safe from the spectral rider's grasp. Gargamel and Azrael soon reach the bridge that the Headless Horseman cannot pass through, and safe inside the bridge, the evil wizard taunts the ghost, who then responds by throwing a flaming pumpkin that causes the floor beneath him and his cat to break, sending them down the river and over the waterfalls.\nWith the three Smurfs returning safely home, Gutsy and Brainy begin to apologize to each other for what they did, with Gutsy admitting that he was jealous about Brainy always winning and Brainy admitting that he was selfish in keeping the secret patch of smurfberries all to himself. Glad to see that two of his little Smurfs have learned their lesson, Papa Smurf proceeds to reward Gutsy with the medal, but Gutsy decides to give it to Brainy instead, who then insists that Gutsy should have it, and so the two Smurfs fight over who should get the medal when it flies out of their hands and lands looped around Lazy's neck, thereby declaring him to be the winner. As the Smurfs gather around the stage to see Gutsy and Brainy dance with each other, Papa Smurf goes out into the forest to thank the Headless Horseman, who turns out to be a goat that he used his magic on to make him appear as a ghost.\nWith Narrator Smurf's ghost story now over, Hefty claims that he wasn't scared, but finds himself jumping into Narrator Smurf's arms at the sound of a bat screeching. Clumsy sees that they are now surrounded by bats, which scares all four Smurfs and sends them running back to the village.", "tmdb_id": 220845}, "37256481": {"title": "Snitch (film)", "plot": "Jason Collins is a college student, who is persuaded to allow his friend Craig to ship drugs to his house. Jason signs for the package which contains pills and a tracking device. DEA officers break into the house; Jason flees but is chased down and arrested by Agent Cooper. While at a barbecue, John Matthews, Jason's estranged father and owner of a construction company, is called by his ex-wife Sylvie about Jason being arrested. John and Sylvie meet with an investigator who says that Craig set Jason up to reduce his own sentence. Jason's charges carry a minimum of 10 years in prison. He is pressured to inform on one of his own friends to reduce his own sentence. \nUsing his connections, John arranges to meet with local US Attorney Joanne Keeghan, who is running an aggressive anti-drug campaign. Keeghan agrees to reduce Jason's sentence if John will inform on a drug dealer. Cooper leads a task force which will monitor any dealings John arranges to use as evidence for an arrest. John searches through his employee records and finds that Daniel James, a new employee, has two prior distribution convictions. Daniel is currently leading a clean life to avoid a third strike. John offers $20,000 if Daniel will simply introduce him to a dealer; Daniel agrees, though he is unaware that John is acting as an informant. Daniel introduces John to Malik, an extremely dangerous, high-ranking local drug dealer, who also has two strikes. \nExplaining that his construction business cannot stay afloat in the current economy without a supplement to its revenues, John offers to run nearly limitless amounts of drugs at almost zero risk in his freight trucks. Malik agrees under the condition that John and Daniel drive the initial run themselves. John and Agent Cooper arrange for several wire taps, where he drives to the pick-up point near the Mexican border when a rival gang ambushes the pick-up, but John escapes, impressing cartel kingpin Pintera, whose men fight off the hijackers. John then makes the deal, delivering the drugs to Malik while under surveillance by Cooper. Malik mentions a meeting with cartel members higher than himself. \nHoping to catch the higher priority targets, Cooper does not move to arrest Malik as agreed. Keeghan claims Cooper did the right thing and reneges on her promise to reduce Jason's sentence unless John cooperates in the second meeting. Outraged, John demands that Jason be released when the job is completed. Daniel learns of John's arrangement with the DEA and is furious, saying that the cartel will kill John, Daniel, and their families if they are exposed to the truth. John and Daniel send their families into hiding, where John meets with Pintera, who wants him to run nearly $100 million in drug profits into Mexico and offers to make John as a member of the cartel's inner circle if he succeeds. Keeghan relishes the prospect of arresting such a high-profile dealer, but Cooper has a change of heart and tries to talk John out of doing the run, suspecting the cartel will kill him afterwards. \nJohn devises a plan to free himself and Daniel from both the government and the cartel. During the run, John is able to escape Cooper's surveillance. At the same time, Daniel sneaks into Malik's house, killing his guards and mortally wounding him. Before dying, Malik reveals Pintera's cell phone number to Daniel. John calls Cooper and has him track both his new cell phone and Pintera's phone, effectively giving Cooper both the money and the kingpin at once. The cartel realizes John is an informant which leads them on a highway chase and shootout before escaping. The cartel members and the money are seized by Cooper's men.

The passengers on the train are segregated, with the elite in the extravagant front cars and the poor crammed into squalid tail compartments overseen by armed guards.\nUrged by his father-figure, Gilliam, Curtis Everett and his second-in-command, Edgar, lead the tail passengers in a revolt after they realize the guards' weapons have no ammunition; bullets are believed to be \"extinct\" due to a previous revolt. They free Namgoong Minsoo, a captive security specialist, who insists that his clairvoyant daughter, Yona, be freed as well. Namgoong helps the tail mob progress forward, but they find themselves facing guards with melee weapons, overseen by Minister Mason. During the battle, the train goes into a tunnel, causing total darkness. The guard force, who have night vision, begin picking off the blind rebels. However, the tail-sectioners launch a counterattack with torches and push the guards back. Edgar is held hostage, but Curtis abandons him to capture Mason, forcing her to order the remaining guards to surrender while Edgar is fatally stabbed. The tail army stays back, holding the guards captive, while Curtis takes Mason, Namgoong, Yona, skilled fighter Grey, and Tanya and Andrew (two parents who have had their children taken from them) toward the front of the train.\nCurtis's group travels through several opulent cars. Namgoong and Yona recognize a landmark outside and consider that the ice may be thawing. The group reaches a schoolroom, where a teacher is indoctrinating the children on Wilford's greatness. A bald man brings eggs for the children to open to celebrate the eighteenth circumnavigation of the Earth. The bald man goes to the tail army and shoots them with loaded automatic guns hidden under the eggs, revealing that bullets still exist. The captured guards are freed, as is Mason's henchman Franco. The teacher, who received a gun from the bald man, kills Andrew before Grey kills her. Franco broadcasts to the classroom his execution of Gilliam, which prompts Curtis to kill Mason. Curtis's group moves on, but Franco catches up with them, killing Grey and Tanya. Franco is then seemingly killed by Curtis and Namgoong. The two, along with Yona, continue onward.\nIn the last car before the engine, Namgoong reveals that the reason he collected the drug Kronole was to use it as an explosive to escape the train with Yona, believing they can survive. Curtis stops them, as he wants to meet Wilford; Curtis explains that in the early days of the train, 17 years before, the tail section had resorted to cannibalism, and he had been ready to eat the infant Edgar but Gilliam offered him his arm instead. Curtis wants to face Wilford to ask why he created this closed ecosystem. The engine door opens, and Wilford's assistant Claude emerges and wounds Namgoong before inviting Curtis inside.\nCurtis meets Wilford and, to his shock, learns that he and Gilliam conspired to stage Curtis's rebellion to reduce the tail section's population to sustainable levels. Wilford orders 74% of the tail passengers killed. He then offers Curtis his position leading the train. Curtis appears ready to accept when Yona overpowers Claude, rushes in, and pulls open a floorboard to reveal Andrew and Tanya's children, Andy and Timmy, working the engine as slaves.

When Wei visits Jing at his dormitory, however, she is told that Jing left for America. Unable to understand why Jing left so abruptly, Wei is confused and heartbroken. Back in her own dormitory, Wei becomes close friends with her three roommates: Ruan Guan, the most beautiful and popular girl in the class; Li Weijuan, a realistic girl who comes from a poor town but is determined to marry well; and Zhu Xiaobei, a tomboy. The four girls talk about their goals in life and all cheer to Ruan Guan's ambition\u2014to have a youth that never fades away.\nWei is befriended by architecture majors Lao Zhang and his roommate Xu Kaiyang. Kaiyang comes from a well-to-do family and pursues Wei romantically, but Wei only regards him as a friend. One evening Wei goes to Lao Zhang and Kaiyang's dorm room to borrow a DVD. Wei is disgusted by the messy condition of the male dorm room, except for one bed that is neat and clean, which Lao Zhang says belongs to their roommate Chen Xiaozheng. Wei sees a building model on the table and fumbles with the parts. At this moment Xiaozheng comes back and yells out, \"What are you doing?\" Startled, Wei knocks the model off the table. Xiaozheng manages to save his model by shoving Wei out of the way, who falls in a mess on the floor.\nEnraged in humiliation, Wei angrily demands an apology from Xiaozheng, but Xiaozheng coolly replies that he has nothing to apologize for and that it was her fault for touching his model. From this moment, Wei is determined to repeatedly humiliate and pester Xiaozheng until she gets her apology. Through her attempts, Wei comes to the realization that she likes Xiaozheng. From Lao Zhang and Weijuan, Wei learns that Xiaozheng comes from a poor family and was raised by a strict mother, hence his disciplined personality. Wei declares her interest in Xiaozheng, and then relentlessly stalks Xiaozheng to get his attention, much to his annoyance. Eventually, Xiaozheng finds himself to like Wei too, and the two start dating.\nDuring the rest of their college life and relationship, Xiaozheng and Wei find that they have starkly contrasting personalities. Although he appreciates Wei's enthusiastic personality, Xiaozheng also reprimands Wei at times for her laid-back and undisciplined attitude towards her coursework. Wei asks Xiaozheng why he is always so serious about everything. Xiaozheng replies, \"My life is like a building that can only be built once, so I cannot afford any margin of error, not even a centimeter's width.\" Due to his family's modest financial circumstances, Xiaozheng feels that he needed to do everything he can to ensure the best possible professional future for himself.\nEventually graduation comes upon Wei and Xiaozheng. At the on-campus recruitment and interview fair, Wei hopes she and Xiaozheng can work at the same company and thus remain together. Unbeknownst to Wei, Xiaozheng had applied to and obtained a graduate fellowship to study architecture in America. When Wei finally learns of his plan, she confronts Xiaozheng to ask why she was the last one to know. Xiaozheng explains that he could not tell her because he was afraid of hurting her and reiterates that he could not make any mistake in his life, so he had to make the choice to leave her to make a better future for himself.\nA few years later, Wei has become a mature professional who excels in her work, much different from her bygone youthful days. One day she suddenly encounters Lin Jing. Jing explains that he left abruptly then because he learned his father was having an affair with Wei's mother, so he could not face Wei. He never went to America, but avoided contact with Wei. The one time when he saw Wei on at her campus, she was happy with Xiaozheng. Now, however, he wants to come back and rekindle their friendship and romance. At the same time, Xiaozheng has also returned from America as an accomplished architect.

The former explains Checco that he and Juliette, despite of Zoe's intentions, want to buy FidoFly, but Zoe succeeds in nulling the affair when Checco convinces them that the company is about to fail due to people that \"has to pay forty-eight rows\" like himself) and the fact that FidoFly later finds itself in that situation impresses Manieri and Bollini, who ask him what is his enterpreur field, and, as he answers that it is the \"cleaning\" field, they misunderstand that he \"cleans\" \"dirty\" (illegally earnt) money and reveal their true nature, starting to plan a co-operation with Checco's company: they are dishonest Freemasons constantly tracked by the Guardia di Finanza, but both Checco and his boss, Dr. Surace, do not understand their dishonesty, then the former can be sure of not being fired.\nChecco soon falls in love and with Zoe, becoming her lover despite already being in love with Daniela, whom, when she sees Checco on television with Manieri and hears about his relationship with Zoe, she forces a syndicalist from her factory to become her sexual partner. Checco discovers this and, feeling extremely sad (with the excuse of not having had any sexual intercourses with Zoe), returns to Milan, where he realizes that Daniela divorced because of his making her work too much.

Nambikkai's contractor brother has been arrested for attempted bribery by State Minister Gnanodayam, a honest politician. Impressed with Das's kidnapping skills, Nambikkai asks him to kidnap Gnanodayam's son Arumai Pragasam as revenge and offers to pay Das up to \u20b920 million. Das initially hesitates, but eventually agrees after being convinced by Kesavan, Sekar and Pagalavan.\nThe next day, the Das gang set out to kidnap Arumai but are astonished to see him be kidnapped by another group. They kidnap Arumai from the other kidnappers and discover that the first kidnapping was staged by Arumai himself to extort money from his father. Arumai manages to convince Das and his men to collude with him to obtain ransom money from his father. The group demands \u20b920 million from the minister and receives the money.\nAn argument over splitting the cash arises between Arumai and the rest during which their van loses control and falls from a bridge.

Arumai returns to his house and hides the money in his room. Das devices a plan to kidnap Arumai again to retrieve the money. They accidentally meet Arumai and successfully kidnap him again. Das lets Arumai go free, after making him promise that he should not tell anything about them to the police. Arumai also promises to return their share of the money. Bramma learns that Arumai staged his own kidnapping and uses this information to threaten Arumai into testifying against the Das gang.\nArumai perjures that the Das gang did not kidnap him, leading to their acquittal. Enraged, Bramma takes the gang to a remote location, brutally beats them in a dark room with the aid of NVG, and raises his department gun to kill them. Instead of shooting them with the officially issued gun, he goes out and retrieves from his police jeep an illegal homemade gun that he had seized from a crook. When he inserts it behind his back in his pants, the rusty gun misfires into Bramma's buttocks, allowing the Das gang to escape. Arumai's father breaks in and takes the money bag to the chief minister, who provided the ransom money.

The chief minister praises Arumai's shrewdness and believes that he can rake in a substantial income of \u20b93 billion in five years for the party, as a young minister. Arumai wins the elections, becomes MLA, immediately gets a minister post, and appoints Sekar and Kesavan as his personal advisers, while Pagalavan becomes an actor.

Back at the morgue, a Dr. Darnoff, working in cooperation with the Russians, examines Jimmy's body and the eggs.

As emergency personnel work to reach some victims trapped underground, one rescuer tries to keep the victims calm by telling the story of how he came to have five fathers, all killed during the Great Patriotic War (World War II).  The trapped victims are young German students and the rescuers are Russian.\nIn 1942, after the initial attack on Stalingrad, a small group of Russian soldiers take cover in a large five story residential building that happens to provide cover for a Russian crossing point on the Volga River. Five of these soldiers become the five fathers in the story: Polyakov (\"Angel\") who had become embittered when his wife and daughter were killed in an air raid; Chvanov, whose hatred of the Germans comes from their cruel treatment and methodical murder of his family; Nikiforov, a talented tenor singer before the war, who had become a cruel and vicious fighter; Sergey, drafted into the war as a spotter; and Captain Gromov, a veteran and hero who leads the group after finding them.

She at first detests him, but soon begins to reciprocate his love, although they cannot speak each other's language. Oberstleutnant Henze arrives to take command of the Germans. He chides Kahn both for his attraction to Masha, as well as his failure to eradicate the Russian soldiers. Henze decides to set an example by rounding up the Russian civilians living in the bombed out buildings, then burning a woman and her daughter alive. This enrages the Russian soldiers who ambush the Germans, killing several, but losing several of their own men in the process. The Germans and Russians then retreat to their own shelters to wait the others out. One afternoon, Chvanov teaches Katya how to aim her gun at a German washing himself at a water faucet and startled, accidentally shoots him, which causes retaliation that injures Chvanov.\nDuring one of his visits to Masha, Kahn promises to take her to safety when the time comes. On her 19th birthday, Katya is presented with a handmade cake from the soldiers, with a song by Nikiforov, whom she had earlier recognized as a famous singer. She is then given the gift of a bathtub filled with hot water, a luxury no one has experienced since the siege began.  Sergey takes Katya to his old lookout spot, located in a building not occupied by either the Germans or the Russians.

As she begs him to stay with her, she is shot by Chvanov for being a collaborator, enraging Kahn. Nikiforov is taken captive by the Germans, where he manages to brutally stab Henze before being killed himself. Henze's death puts Kahn back in charge.\nGerman reinforcements arrive with tanks that have the range to take out the Russian soldiers and their building. They open fire, fatally injuring Chvanov. Kahn and his soldiers attack, shooting Polyakov to death. Kahn then finds Gromov on the second floor trying to use a radio. The two of them shoot each other several times before collapsing.

She is then contacted by the visitor from before, revealed to be Suzuha Amane, who came from the future using a time machine Kurisu built. She explains to both Kurisu and Rintaro that all the memories of World Lines Rintaro had visited is overloading his Reading Steiner, causing him to fluctuate between the current world line and the \"R\" world line, the only other world line where neither Mayuri nor Kurisu die. Suzuha states the only way to save him from vanishing completely is to use a time machine to travel to the past, but Rintaro ostensibly refuses, as he feels neither time machines nor time leap machines should exist and doesn't want Kurisu to go through the same suffering he went through, saying he would rather disappear to allow her and Mayuri to live in peace. He instead urges Kurisu to forget about him, leaving her with a kiss.\nAs Rintaro disappears once again the next day, Kurisu breaks down in tears before grudgingly deciding to accept his wish and try to forget him. Later, on August 13, as the Future Gadget Lab gets word that it might have to close up, Kurisu is once again approached by Suzuha, who tells her that she is not being honest with her own feelings, eventually convincing Kurisu to go with her in her time machine. In order to keep Rintaro in the Steins Gate world line, he must be implanted with a powerful memory that helps distinguish it from other world lines. The two travel back to June 30, 2005, where Kurisu attempts to talk with the young Rintaro, only to result in him getting into a car accident instead, leaving her too afraid to attempt another trip to the past. Back in the present, Kurisu discovers Mayuri and the others also possess faint memories of Rintaro, which are soon awakened when she does an imitation of his persona, Kyouma Hououin. Encouraged by everyone's feelings, Kurisu returns to the past, this time succeeding in her mission by implanting the concept of Kyouma Hououin into Rintaro's mind and giving him his first kiss, which led him to take on his 'mad scientist' persona to protect Mayuri. With this, Kurisu manages to bring Rintaro back to the Steins Gate world line and the movie ends with Rintaro asking Kurisu if she will return his first kiss to him. Smiling, Kurisu says \"Never\".", "tmdb_id": 225745}, "50885109": {"title": "Stigma (2013 film)", "plot": "Ibiso (Hilda Dokubo) is responsible for delivery of babies in her community.

Most cases are open-and-shut due to lack of leads, but when heirs are located, he regularly finds them hesitant to organise funerals for the deceased and so has taken to the practice of organising the funerals, writing eulogies for each deceased and attending the funerals himself, usually as the only mourner. His boss finds this practice time-consuming and expensive and so has decided to close his office down once he completes one final case: the death of William \"Billy\" Stoke. When Mr. May, as he is called throughout the story, asks the man's address, he finds out that the deceased was a neighbour he never knew, who lived directly across the apartment building from him, in direct view of his window.\nInspecting Stoke's apartment, his sole lead is a series of photographs, one of them being of a pork pie factory. Most of the photographs are of an adult woman and a young girl. The many photos of the young girl stop abruptly; there are empty pages in the album and no photos of a girl much older than ten. John surmises that Stoke once had a wife and daughter, but there are no records or leads, no names, dates or labels, no identification of any kind.\nHe visits the pie factory and finds one of the workers who was friends with Stoke at the time. He asks the man if he had ever spoken of a wife or daughter to which the man replies that Stoke had never spoken of a family and that he left the factory for a lady who owned a fish and chips restaurant that Stoke frequented. John travels to where Stoke was living at the time and checks all the fish and chip shops in town until he locates Stoke's former lover, Mary, her adult daughter, and granddaughter. Mary discloses that Stoke is the father of her daughter, but that he left before he knew of her existence.\nMary tells John that they cannot be considered Stoke's kin as \"he never wanted a family.\" She does, however, tell him that after Stokes abandoned her he probably landed himself in prison.\nJohn manages to locate the prison Stoke was incarcerated at. At the prison a guard leads John to some letters Stoke never mailed where he finds a letter from the young girl in the photo album, making it apparent that she is a daughter who was once part of Stoke's life and family. It contains the name \"Kelly\" and an address. Another involved search is fruitful: May finds Kelly Stoke, Stoke's other daughter, the daughter he knew. Kelly is taken aback to hear her father is dead, but shows hard feelings from her father's wild ways and his abandonment of her and her mother when she was young. Kelly discloses that her mother, the woman in the photo album and Stoke's former wife, had died three years ago.\nWhen May invites Kelly to the funeral, she displays hurt and resentment that are strong enough for her to decline. She gives him a photo of her father with Jumbo, taken when they were serving in the military in the Falklands. Jumbo remembers Stoke fondly but shows no interest in the funeral. Jumbo refers John to several parks and shelters where he had seen Stoke last. There John meets two homeless men there who agree to talk to him in exchange for a drink. However, they too show no interest in the funeral. Considering this the end of the line, John returns to his office to ready it for decommissioning. He receives a phone call there from Kelly who has accepted to be Stoke's next of kin.\nThe later part of the film shows quiet scenes that depict John making small changes in his rigid routine: trying new foods and drinks, walking new routes and being inspired by a story of Billy Stoke's bravado.\nJohn meets with Kelly to inform her of what she has inherited and enthusiastically discusses the funeral arrangements he has made for Stokes, including allocating his grave on John's favourite resting spot in the cemetery. Kelly invites John to join her for tea after the funeral, which makes John smile for the first time in the film, under the promise that his loneliness will end. After shopping for some small gifts, he is hit by a New Routemaster bus and bleeds to death on the asphalt.\nHowever, there is no one to locate his next of kin, since the office has closed down. No one shows up to his funeral.

Kelly occasionally looks around for John but does not recognise his coffin as it passes by. As Stoke's funeral party leaves Kelly looks over and sees attendants putting the last dirt on a new grave, again not knowing that it is John's.\nAfter May's funeral attendants depart, the ghost of Billy Stoke and of the other people whose cases John worked on while he was still alive begin to appear in the cemetery en masse and walk towards John's grave.", "tmdb_id": 216156}, "32954280": {"title": "Stoker (film)", "plot": "On her 18th birthday, India Stoker, a girl with a strong acuteness of the senses, is left with her unstable mother Evelyn after her loving father Richard dies in a car crash.

Charismatic and caddish AJ is close friends with the gentlemanly and shy land agent Gilbert Evans, an army officer who formerly served in the Boer War and socialises with the various Lamorna artists.\nLate one night, a beautiful young woman arrives at the local pub, and introduces herself as Florence Carter-Wood. She has come to Cornwall to study painting with the Lamorna artists and to join her brother, Joey, while also escaping the iron grip of her father. Gilbert is captivated by her straight away.\nFlorence wishes to study sketching with AJ, and models on horseback for one of his paintings ('The Morning Ride'). She forms a bond with Gilbert, even inviting him to meet her father when he visits. Gilbert writes in his diary a record of all his meetings with Florence, and invites her to the races. Not long after Gilbert decides to propose, but he is interrupted by AJ before he is able to ask Florence to marry him. A few days later, AJ himself proposes to Florence, who accepts excitedly.\nAs the wedding approaches, AJ starts to be unkind to Florence. AJ invites Florence and Gilbert to an exhibition at the Royal Academy, where his portrait of Florence is displayed alongside two other paintings of his: a gypsy woman, and of Dolly, a local woman who models frequently for the Lamorna group. Florence is embarrassed to see her painting so prominently displayed next to portraits of other women, and she confides in Gilbert that she might now regret having accepted AJ so lightly. At the wedding ceremony, she asks AJ to remove her portrait; he refuses, even gloating in his wedding speech that the portrait will remain in the Royal Academy.\nDespairing, Florence leaves the reception and goes up to her room, where she drinks cyanide poison. She staggers downstairs and collapses in front of her wedding guests. Gilbert attends to her; Florence survives the suicide attempt. Once she and AJ return to Cornwall, she asks Gilbert to look for a private studio space for her. Gilbert finds an abandoned cottage on the cliffside.

Intercepting it, Superman learns the meteor is actually a robot that he promptly defeats before activating its beacon and taking it to the Fortress of Solitude. With help from a fearful Supergirl, Superman learns the robot is actually a drone controlled by a being named Brainiac, a Coluan scientist who subjected himself to extensive motor, skeletal, and cybernetic enhancements, turning him from a human-like, thin, and hairless being to a muscular, red-eyed giant with computer-like components and enhanced physical abilities comparable to Superman's. Supergirl, horrified at seeing Brainiac, reveals her experience with the monster. Brainiac had seized and miniaturized Krypton's capital city of Kandor prior to the planet's destruction with her father and mother attempting to track him down before they mysteriously lost contact with Krypton.

Inside Kandor, his strength waning due to the artificial red sun, Superman meets his uncle Zor-El and aunt Alura. They explain that Brainiac was instructed to learn all that is knowable about the galaxy. Being a cyborg, Brainiac interpreted his directive literally and realized that he could not achieve this goal because life keeps changing. His knowledge of one world would become out-of-date as soon as he moved on to the next world. Brainiac therefore destroys civilizations after studying them so that they cannot change further, thus leaving him with literally complete and up-to-date knowledge of them.\nSuperman formulates a plan and escapes Kandor using the subjugator robots. From there, Superman disables Brainiac's ship and takes Kandor with him back to Earth. At that time, Lois learns from Supergirl why Superman left and alerts the Pentagon of a possible invasion by Brainiac, who eventually repairs his ship and arrives in Metropolis.\nDespite everyone, including Supergirl, doing their best to fend his drones off, Metropolis is encased in a bottle and both Superman and Supergirl are captured. Having hooked Superman up to his ship, Brainiac reveals that Earth offers nothing to him, tortures Superman by overloading his mind with data to obtain Kandor, and attempts to destroy the planet. However, telling his captor what Earth means to him, Superman breaks free and then frees Supergirl and convinces her to stop the Solar-Aggressor from hitting the sun.

Rushing to the pawn store, they choose not to look up its actual worth and decide to sell it to Paul Swindell (Fred Ewanuick), a collectibles reseller who agrees to buy the card for $350.\nThe next morning, Griffin and Ben discover on the news that Swindell has claimed to have found the card himself and plans to sell it for  $1.2 million. The two angrily head back to Swindell, who refuses to return the card. As a result, Griffin bands together a team to take the card back in an elaborate heist. In addition to Griffin and Ben, the team consists of cheerleader Amanda Benson (Ariana Grande), actress Savannah Westcott (Jennette McCurdy), and \u201cthe muscle\u201d Darren Vader (Noah Munck). Griffin's younger sister, hacker Melissa (Ciara Bravo), also attempts to join the team, but Griffin rejects her.\nTogether, the team attempts to sneak into Swindell's shop and steal the card. Griffin finds the card but has second thoughts, worried that they would be the prime suspects in an investigation of the robbery. After Melissa saves the team from being caught by hacking into the shop's alarm system, Griffin lets her join the team. Griffin then plans to have Swindell hand over the card to them. Subsequently, Anton Lefevre, a wealthy businessman, invites Swindell to auction off the card to him. Using video camera glasses with an earpiece, Amanda goes to the house of Eddie, a nerd at their school and a rare item collector, to find and obtain a rare red-headed \"Captain Cybertor\" action figure, which is commonly meant to have blue hair, but a handful of red-headed versions were accidentally released. Her earpiece switches off and, believing she cannot be heard, unknowingly reveals her true nerdy nature to the group (who can still hear her). Ultimately, Eddie lends the toy (and its common counterpart) to Amanda in return for a date with him.\nThe team plans to get the card at the Lakeshore Hotel, where Swindell is planning to sell it. After arriving, Savannah pretends to be Swindell's bratty daughter and asks for his crown suite room key. Melissa hacks into the hotel's system and gives Swindell a cheap, horrible room. Savannah and Darren pretend to be two German kids who let Swindell lie to them about the red-headed Captain Cybertor's actual price, and sell it to Swindell for $10. Swindell then goes to a massage with Griffin, who is disguised as Lefevre. During the massage, Griffin informs Swindell of a collector named Ivan Volkov who has been searching for a red-headed Captain Cybertor.\nAmanda swaps the Cybertor figures from their boxes, unbeknownst to Swindell. He sells it to Volkov for $80,000 and later sees through Ben's mustache disguise, finds Ben's room card, and enters the gang's room. Expecting this, the gang confronts him and tells him about the Cybertor switch. They offer him the red Cybertor in return for the Honus Wagner card and show him footage of Volkov furious at Swindell for giving him the blue one. Swindell lunges for the red toy, so they throw it around until Ben accidentally throws it off the balcony and onto a couple's wedding cake. They all chase after it. Meanwhile, Ben's dad is at the hotel and is showing off his new invention, called the \"iGotit\", hoping to win a cash prize on an invention game show.\nAfter disrupting the wedding, the gang retrieves the Cybertor and again offer it to Swindell in exchange for the card. After Swindell gives the Cybertor to Volkov and flees under his orders, it is revealed that Volkov is actually Savannah's father, who, with two other men, were enlisted by Savannah to help Griffin. The gang reveals themselves as the actual owners of the card to Lefevre, who invites them to the auction. When Swindell attempts to leave the hotel, he bumps into an employee, who spills his case and reveals a load of fake Honus Wagner cards with Swindell's face on them. A hotel employee gives Swindle the $35,000 bill for the Crown Suite.\nAt the end, Griffin rewards the gang with $25,000 for their help. Ben explains his family did not need the money because his dad had earned money off of his invention, which briefly stopped Swindell at the hotel. Ben uses the money to send the deserving wedding couple on a real honeymoon. He also pays for the group's college and lets himself and his team spend the rest.

Instead, he sets up a makeshift television studio from his radio station, and negotiates with his former boss, the profit- and ratings-obsessed news producer Cha Dae-eun who'll do anything to beat the other TV stations in their coverage of the bombing.

When a dare to get the numbers of two nearby girls, Jayley and Hayley Woo, went awry, the boys ran away. Jiaming bumped into the twins' friend, May (Julie Tan), while doing so, consequently dropping his Xinyao booklet.\nAfter receiving their O-Level results, Jiaming decided to drop out of school, having already retained for two years, while the rest of the boys moved on. Coincidentally, they were placed in the same Junior College as the three girls they had met earlier. On the first day of school, the boys started a short-lived pornographic magazines business and were suspended from school for a month's time. Meanwhile, Jiaming visited the junior college to hang out with his friends and was attracted by a familiar music tune into an empty school assembly hall. There, he discovered May playing the song on the piano from the Xinyao book that he dropped earlier. He confronted her to repossess his book but was interrupted by three school bullies, whose leader said that May was his. Jiaming left the scene after a conflict with the bullies. Eventually, he met up with his three friends and learned about their suspension.\nThe boys became aware of Xinyao singing contest with a winner's purse of $5000. Jiaming suggested that they form a band and join the contest. After their auditions, the boys bumped into the girls, who had also tried their luck in the contest but lost because of technical difficulties. They decided to work together with the boys, forming a collaborative band. Subsequently, they were asked to perform at and advertise Dream Boat.\nDuring a gig later on, Jiaming was hounded by a pack of bullies, headed by James (Xavier Ong), for his close relationship with May.

On the night before leaving for the United States, May ran in the rain to flag a taxi to get to Jiaming's house.

Before May entered the departure gate, she whispered to her mother that going to United States to study would be the last time that she would ever listen to her.\nJiaming visited May once in the United States with money pooled together by his friends, and after returning, he and his friends performed during the finals of the Xinyao competition.

She has been invited to stay there and help Vida write her biography before she dies of cancer.\nMargaret is hesitant, as Vida is known for telling a different story each time she is asked about her background in interviews, so she requests some verifiable information from public record. Vida tells her that her birth name was Adeline March and the local newspapers wrote about a fire that burned down her family home when she was seventeen, of which she bears proof in the form of a key-shaped burn on her palm. With Margaret satisfied that she is telling the truth this time, Vida begins to tell her the events leading up to the fire.\nShe grew up at Angelfield, the decaying family estate, with her identical twin sister Emmeline. Their mother Isabelle was distracted by the abuse she suffered at the hands of her unhinged brother, Charlie, and eventually taken away to a mental asylum, so the girls were mostly left to their own devices, becoming unruly and anti-social. The only adult supervision they had came from the two servants, nicknamed \"Missus\" and \"John-the-dig.\" A governess is hired, Hester Barrow, who has little effect on the girls' behaviour. Hester speaks to the local doctor about the girls and proposes they are separated as an experiment to see if their behaviour improves. It doesn't, as they are both heartbroken at their forced separation. Adeline will not speak and Emmeline weeps constantly. Hester and the doctor are caught kissing by the doctor's wife, and they both disappear from the village. Vida tells Margaret it's thought they went to America.\nBy the time the twins were seventeen, they were all alone at Angelfield. Isabelle had died in the asylum and soon after that, Charlie also disappeared. Missus and John-the-dig agreed not to tell anybody, so that they and the girls could continue as they always had. Adeline discovered Charlie's body in the woods, where he had apparently shot himself, but she said nothing to the others. Both Missus and John-the-dig fell to their deaths; Missus over three flights over a banister, and John off an insecure ladder. Though it looked like an accident, Adeline could tell the ladder's safety catch had been tampered with. Fearing what might have happened if she told the authorities they were alone, Adeline pretended Charlie was merely on holiday in Peru. She was assisted in this lie by Ambrose, a boy John had hired to help out after Missus died.\nJohn's death troubles Margaret, as the younger Vida had insisted that Emmeline and Ambrose could not have done it, leaving her as the only possible suspect. Between interviews she goes to explore Angelfield, and is frightened away by someone. She later learns this is Aurelius Love, a harmless man who occasionally camps out at the house. When Vida asks her about her own life, Margaret breaks down and admits that she, too, had an identical twin who was fatally struck by a car as a child, for which Margaret has always blamed herself as much as their mother had.\nMargaret hears noises and weeping in the house at night and sees a woman in white roaming the garden, Margaret confronts her and asks what she wants, but her speech is unintelligible. She then sees Vida go to the woman's room and feed her. Margaret then realizes there weren't two girls at Angelfield, but three. Vida confirms this, revealing she wasn't Adeline, but presumably the daughter of Charlie, abandoned at the estate by her unknown mother. Missus and John-the-dig kept her existence a secret from the world, as she was probably the product of rape. The real Adeline was dangerously violent and insanely jealous of anyone who got Emmeline's attention. She pushed Missus over the stairs and meddled with John McDigg's ladder to make it unsafe for him. \nAmbrose was fired after Vida discovered he had gotten Emmeline pregnant. She gave birth to a baby boy at Angelfield, and it was obvious Adeline was jealous of him. Vida caught her preparing to burn the newborn illegitimate boy alive, and managed to sneak him away and later left him on a doorstep in the nearby village, where he was taken in and named Aurelius Love. When Vida returned to the house, the room was ablaze and Emmeline was fighting Adeline, thinking her illegitimate child was in danger. Vida managed to drag Emmeline out of the room and lock it, leaving Adeline inside. The key-shaped scar on Vida's palm was a result of her locking the door of the room whilst the key was red hot. When the fire brigade arrived, they assumed Vida was Adeline all along.\nEmmeline is the woman in white in the garden, and the events of her girlhood had further induced insanity, but Vida has felt honour-bound to care for her despite her illness. Margaret makes a final journey to Angelfield, which is in the process of being demolished. There she finds Aurelius Love, whom Vida's doctor told Margaret used to camp out in the abandoned house. He apologizes for their previous encounter, stating that he did not mean to frighten her. There are police cars outside the house, and Aurelius tells her that a skeleton has been found during the demolition, presumably the remains of Adeline.

Tensions rise due to various conflicts, including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the Apocalypse predicted in the Book of Revelation. Emma Watson makes her way back to James' house. However, she misinterprets an overheard conversation and, believing the group intends to rape her, flees with their remaining water.\nCraig goes for water stored in James' cellar, but finds the doors locked. Outside, he encounters an unknown being, causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite, and the others kick him out of the house. Before leaving, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months prior, but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship. Jonah annoys Jay, who then punches him in the face. That night, Jonah prays for Jay to die and is possessed by a demon. While Craig and Jay venture to a neighbor's house to scavenge for supplies, the possessed Jonah attacks Seth and James. Jay and Craig return and help subdue Jonah, tying him to a bed. During an exorcism attempt, Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle, starting a fire that engulfs Jonah and the house and forces the others outside.\nJames suggests driving to his home in Malibu, but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into Heaven when the plan succeeds; the others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. On the way to Malibu, the three encounter cannibals led by Danny and his sex slave, Channing Tatum. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny, the beam vanishes, and Danny and the other cannibals eat James alive while Seth and Jay escape and encounter Satan. Jay apologizes to Seth for his wrongdoings, while Satan attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay, and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand, but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven; Seth forces Jay to leave him behind, after which another beam appears around Seth, inadvertently skewering Satan and castrating him.\nThe pair arrive in Heaven and are reunited with Craig, who tells them that any wish comes true.

Sir Robert wishes to restore the ruins of King Godred\u2019s Castle at Ulfstead.\nThomas arrives at Ulfstead with crates of building materials, where he meets a French narrow gauge engine named Millie. Thomas remarks that he hasn't seen her before to which she responds, explaining that she was kept in her shed when the Earl was on his travels around the world.\nSpencer returns to the island and stays at Tidmouth Sheds for the night, where he argues with Gordon about who is the fastest. The two engines race the next day but Spencer abruptly leaves in between the race, claiming that he has to help the Earl.\nAfter Henry has a fault with his bursted safety valve, Thomas, Percy and James are assigned to pull his heavy goods train to the castle. Once there, Thomas meets Jack the Front Loader who informs him of The Earl's plans to restore the castle. The Earl tells Thomas that one of the flatbeds (containing a crate on top) should have been taken to the Steamworks. Out of curiosity, Percy and James follow Thomas as he transports the flatbed.\nWhen the engines arrive at the Steamworks, the crate is removed from the flatbed to reveal an old and rusty engine: Stephenson's Rocket, referred to as Stephen. The engines ask the Earl why Stephen has been brought to Sodor. The Earl claims that he has a \u201cspecial job\u201d for him but asks the engines not to tell him that. That night at Tidmouth Sheds, Thomas, Percy and James told the other engines about Stephen.\nThe next morning, all the other engines visit the Steamworks to have a look at Stephen. Stephen explains that he is one of the first steam engines ever built in the world. Back when he was built, engines were typically pulled by horses and steam engines were new and experimental. He was contested in a race against the other existing steam engines at the time, which he won.\nAfter a while, Stephen is restored and repainted. Sir Topham Hatt informs Thomas, Percy and James of a new job at Ulfstead. On hearing this, Stephen feels disheartened at not having a job of his own, thinking that the newer engines are more useful than him. Thomas tries to cheer him up by telling him about the Earl's special job for him.\nAs expected, Stephen gets very excited and starts searching Sodor to find out what his new job is. First, he visits Brendam Docks, then the Blue Mountain Quarry and finally decides to visit a old, abandoned mine that is located downhill at Ulfstead.\nUphill of the mine, Thomas, Percy and James are still helping rebuild the castle when the Earl tells them that the castle will be opened to the public as a tourist attraction and that Stephen's special job is to be their tour guide.\nMeanwhile, Gordon and Spencer try having another race after their previous attempt failed. They are passed by two speedy streamlined tender engines, who introduce themselves as Connor and Caitlin, who have come to Sodor to take passengers to the castle from the Mainland.\nStephen reaches the mine but is disappointed to see that the entrance to the mine is blocked. He begins to think that Thomas was wrong about him having a job.\nThomas and Percy get ready to push some Troublesome Trucks containing dirt away, but the Earl says that the train would be too heavy for them and that they should wait for James to return from having a wash. Thomas does not want to wait, instead he wants to tell Stephen about his job. He insists that they can take the train themselves.\nWhen Thomas and Percy climb up the slope, they realize that there should be an engine in the front to control the trucks. However it's too late and the trucks push themselves downhill. The trucks collide with Stephen and cause the entrance of the mine to open, sending Stephen inside and causing his funnel to fall off. The impact causes a shower of rocks to block the entrance of the mine once again - this time with Stephen stuck inside. Thomas and Percy, who were at the back of the train, did not see this.\nThomas visits the Steamworks, unaware that Stephen left, to tell him about his special job. He is shocked on finding that he isn't there and the engines begin searching for him.\nInside the mine, Stephen tries finding his own way out. He eventually finds an old wooden chest, which he tries bumping out of the way. The chest tumbles over and opens up. Stephen is amazed by what he finds. By the next day, he is still looking for a way out when he finds himself in the same place he started.\nWhile the engines are searching for Stephen, Thomas reaches the entrance of the mine. At first he thinks that Stephen wouldn't be inside but notices his funnel lying on the ground. Thomas shouts Stephen's name, who whistles in response.\nThomas brings Jack the Front Loader to the mine, who clears the fallen rocks. With the entrance now unblocked, Thomas finds Stephen and pulls him out of the mine to safety.\nThe next day was the grand reopening of Ulfstead Castle and the Earl declares while delivering a speech that Stephen found King Godred's golden crown while inside the mine.\nAs Stephen and Millie give tours of the castle, Connor, Caitlin, Spencer and Gordon all have a race.\nAccording to concept art, Colin was originally meant to appear in this special, based at Ulfstead Castle.

The Asgardians soon learn that the Convergence, a rare alignment of the Nine Realms, is imminent; as the event approaches, portals linking the worlds appear at random.\nIn London, astrophysicist Dr. Jane Foster and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where, beyond Heimdall's near all-seeing vision, she absorbs the Aether. Heimdall alerts Thor, leading him to Earth.

At an inn in Meung-sur-Loire, an older man derides d'Artagnan's horse. Insulted, d'Artagnan demands a duel with him. The older man's companions beat d'Artagnan unconscious with a cooking pot and a metal tong that breaks his sword. His letter of introduction to Monsieur de Tr\u00e9ville, the commander of the Musketeers, is stolen. D'Artagnan resolves to avenge himself upon the man (later revealed to him as Comte de Rochefort, an agent of Cardinal Richelieu, who is in Meung to pass orders from the Cardinal to Milady de Winter, another of his agents).\nIn Paris, d'Artagnan visits de Tr\u00e9ville at the headquarters of the Musketeers, but the meeting is overshadowed by the loss of his letter, and de Tr\u00e9ville politely refuses his application. He does, however, write a letter of introduction to an academy for young gentlemen, which may prepare him for recruitment at a later time. From de Tr\u00e9ville's window, d'Artagnan sees Rochefort passing in the street below and rushes out of the building to confront him, but in doing so he separately causes offence to three of the Musketeers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, who each demand satisfaction; d'Artagnan must duel each of them in turn that afternoon.\nWhen the three friends learn that d'Artagnan is a virgin they refuse to fight him. At this point, Cardinal Richelieu's guards appear and try to arrest d'Artagnan and the three Musketeers for illegal dueling. Although outnumbered, the four men win the battle. D'Artagnan seriously wounds Jussac, one of the Cardinal's officers and a renowned fighter. After learning of this event, King Louis XIII appoints d'Artagnan to des Essart's company of the King's Guards and gives him forty pistoles.\nD'Artagnan falls in love at first sight with the pretty, young and married Constance Bonacieux. She works for the Queen Consort of France, Anne of Austria, who is secretly conducting an affair with the Duke of Buckingham. The Queen has received a gift of diamond studs from her husband Louis XIII.  Anne gives the diamonds to her lover as a keepsake. Cardinal Richelieu, who wants war between France and England, plans to expose the tryst. He persuades the King to demand that the Queen wear the diamonds to a soir\u00e9e that the Cardinal is sponsoring.\nConstance tries to send her cowardly husband to London, but the man is manipulated by Richelieu and does not go. D'Artagnan and his friends intercede. En route they are repeatedly attacked by the Cardinal's henchmen, and only d'Artagnan and Planchet reach London. Before their arrival, d'Artagnan is compelled to assault and nearly kill the Comte de Wardes, who is a friend of the Cardinal, a cousin of Rochefort, and Milady's lover. Although two of the diamond studs have been stolen by Milady, the Duke of Buckingham is able to provide replacements while delaying the thief's return to Paris. D'Artagnan is thus able to return a complete set of jewels to Queen Anne just in time to save her honor.  He receives from her a beautiful ring as an expression of her gratitude. Shortly afterwards, d'Artagnan begins an affair with Madame Bonacieux. Arriving for one of their assignations, he notices signs of a struggle and discovers that Rochefort and M. Bonacieux, acting under the orders of the Cardinal, have assaulted and imprisoned her.\nD'Artagnan retrieves his friends, who have just recovered from their injuries, and brings them back to Paris.  D'Artagnan meets Milady de Winter officially, and recognizes her as one of the Cardinal's agents from Meung, but this does not deter him.

Entering her quarters in the dark, he pretends to be the Comte de Wardes and trysts with her. He finds a fleur-de-lis branded on Milady's shoulder, marking her as a felon. Discovering his identity, Milady attempts to kill him, but d'Artagnan eludes her.  He is ordered to the siege of La Rochelle. He is informed that the Queen has rescued Constance from prison. In an inn, the musketeers overhear the Cardinal asking Milady to murder the Duke of Buckingham, a supporter of the Protestant rebels at La Rochelle who has sent troops to assist them. Richelieu gives her a letter that excuses her actions as under orders from the Cardinal himself, but Athos takes it from her. The next morning, Athos bets that he, d'Artagnan, Porthos, and Aramis, and their servants can hold the recaptured St. Gervais bastion against the rebels for an hour. They resist for an hour and a half before retreating, killing 22 Rochellese in total. They warn Lord de Winter and the Duke of Buckingham. Milady is imprisoned on arrival in England but seduces her guard, Felton (a fictionalization of the real John Felton), and persuades him to allow her escape and to kill Buckingham himself.\nOn her return to France, Milady hides in a convent where Constance is also staying. The naive Constance clings to Milady, who sees a chance to avenge herself on d'Artagnan.  Milady fatally poisons Constance before d'Artagnan can rescue her.\nThe Musketeers apprehend Milady before she can reach the protection of Cardinal Richelieu.

The Cardinal laughs at this arrogance, but he is impressed with d'Artagnan's wilfulness. Secretly glad to be rid of the treacherous Milady, the Cardinal destroys the letter and writes a new order, giving the bearer a promotion to lieutenant in de Treville's company of musketeers, leaving the name blank.

The thieves are unable to find the painting in Simon's apartment or car, so, after he is released from the hospital, they kidnap and torture him. It becomes clear that Simon was involved in the heist as an \"inside man\" and double-crossed the other thieves, but the blow to the head has left him with a case of amnesia, and he does not remember where he hid the painting. Franck decides to send Simon to a hypnotherapist to try to help him remember.\nSimon chooses Elizabeth Lamb (Dawson) from a list of hypnotherapists. Using a fake name, he tells her he is looking for some lost keys, hoping he can secretly get her to lead him to the painting instead. While he is in a hypnotic trance, Simon gives Elizabeth his real name as the name of an alter ego who will help them find the keys, and she notices Simon's injuries from being tortured and sees a wire sticking out from under his shirt from the covert listening device he is wearing so the other thieves can hear what he says during the session. When there are only keys in the location Elizabeth helps Simon remember, Franck sends Simon back to Elizabeth. By their second session, she has researched Simon and the theft, and she starts by silently asking him if he is in trouble. When he says he is, she says she can help and tells the other thieves she needs to talk to them.\nIn exchange for a cut of the proceeds from the sale of the painting, Elizabeth hypnotizes Simon again, this time with the other thieves present, but she is unable to get him to remember the location of the painting. Afterward, she asks him how he got involved with Franck, and Simon confesses that he has a gambling problem and convinced Franck to settle his debts in exchange for help stealing the painting.\nDuring the next hypnosis session, Simon remembers that, before encountering Franck during the heist, he had cut the painting from the frame and hid it in his suit, and he attacked Franck because Franck was about to look at the painting. Shortly after the blow to his head, he awoke alone and left the auction house. While crossing the street, he was distracted by a text message on his phone and got hit by a red car. He remembers the driver as having been Elizabeth, who he accuses of making him forget something before lunging at her, in the memory as well as in real life. The other thieves restrain Simon, and Elizabeth brings him out of the trance.\nThe next morning, Simon wakes up to find that Elizabeth has slept on his couch because she was worried about him. He says he had a strange dream, which she says was not a dream, in which she and Franck put him in a fMRI and ran a test that indicated he has an obsession with her. Elizabeth explains to Franck that this is due to transference and Simon's attempts to fill the gaps in his memory from the brain trauma, but she can use it to seduce Simon and get him to tell her where the painting is. When Simon apologizes to Elizabeth, she acts understanding and agrees to go to out with him.\n\nAt dinner, Simon abruptly cools toward Elizabeth and goes home. She tells Franck this happened because Simon is jealous of him, and Franck and Elizabeth argue and then have sex. One of the other thieves sees this and tells Simon, who is waiting for Elizabeth when she gets home. She is able to trigger his lust for her to calm his jealousy, and then surreptitiously hypnotizes him. By leading Simon through an imagined narrative in which Franck is planning to kill him, Elizabeth is finally able to get Simon to reveal to her where he hid the painting, but she is caught by the other thieves when she leaves to go retrieve it. Simon and Franck are sent to get the painting, while the other thieves stay behind in Elizabeth's apartment to rape her. Franck is distracted by her screams as the thieves draw closer to her, and Simon overpowers Franck and kills the other three thieves.\nElizabeth convinces Simon to spare Franck and bring him with them to get the painting. The trio go to a parking garage and collect a red car, which they drive to a warehouse. During the trip, Elizabeth reveals that Simon had previously come to her for help with his gambling addiction. They started an affair, but he became obsessed with her, jealous, and, eventually, abusive. Fearing for her life, she re-directed the hypnosis to make him forget her. Unfortunately, when Franck hit Simon on the head, it brought back a vague sense of his memories of Elizabeth, and, in his confused state, he imagined the driver of the car who hit him as Elizabeth and strangled the woman to death.\nAt the warehouse, Elizabeth finds the painting and the body of the driver in the trunk of the car. Simon gives Elizabeth the painting and then douses the car in fuel. Because Franck is still zip-tied to the steering wheel, Elizabeth begs Simon to not set the car on fire, but to no avail.

However, his obsession with racing makes him an outcast in the slow and cautious snail community, and a constant embarrassment to his older brother, Chet.\nAfter nearly getting killed by a lawnmower in an attempt to retrieve a fallen tomato, Theo wanders onto a freeway to admire the traffic and wishes upon a star, which is actually an airplane, that he could be fast. Suddenly, he is sucked into the supercharger of a Chevrolet Camaro, fusing his molecules with nitrous oxide. When he wakes up, he possesses superspeed and other characteristics of a real car. However, his first attempt to try out his new powers ends with him crashing a boy's tricycle into the garden in which many other snails worked at, resulting in him and Chet getting fired from the garden crew.\nChet angrily scolds Theo for his recklessness, and is snatched by a crow, but is pursued and rescued by Theo at a rundown strip mall called \"Starlight Plaza\".

He throws the piglets into a burlap sack and tosses them into a river. This event coincides with Jeff and Kris feeling an extreme sense of loss and frustration, and both act as if something terrible is happening to them; Jeff spontaneously picks a fight with two of his co-workers while Kris frantically searches as if she'd lost something. The two, in their panicked state, reunite and travel to Kris's house, where they gather supplies, including a gun, and make camp in her bathroom's tub, expecting the worst. Meanwhile, the sack of piglets is seen rotting away and a blue substance bursts from the piglets' open wounds, filling the surrounding waters, from which orchids have emerged. The orchids eventually turn the same color blue and are collected by farmers, who sell the plants in the neighborhood where the Thief operates.\nThese events seem to mark a change in the state of things. Kris and Jeff begin to remember each other's personal histories as their own. Jeff discovers Kris mumbling the text of Walden while swimming. It is while performing this ritual that Kris comes to sense things that the Sampler has sensed, and it is this moment that the two start to piece together what happened to them both. In a dreamlike sequence, Kris, Jeff, and the Sampler all sit down at a table in a bare, white room where Kris reveals to the Sampler that she is aware of him; the Sampler collapses from an apparent heart attack. The scene then cuts to a parallel shot at the pig farm, where Kris shoots and kills the collapsed Sampler. Kris and Jeff collect a box of written records detailing others who were similarly drugged; they summon these other victims to the farm by sending them copies of Walden. The farm is thereafter remodeled and the pigs are better cared for; as a result, no more pigs are drowned, the orchids in the river no longer turn blue, and the Thief is deprived of the larvae for his drug.

Their father Bulldust is the leader of the Pachyrhinosaurus herd. Alex, who is Patchi's mentor, protector and teacher, tries to help Patchi impress a female Pachyrhinosaurus named Juniper, but her herd migrates south without him. Patchi is also attacked by a troodon, which attempts to eat him, but he is saved by Bulldust, resulting in Patchi having a hole in his frill as an injury which Alex claims that Patchi is \"destined for greatness\". \nLater, Bulldust moves his herd south as well, but when they try to pass through a forest, they are forced to flee when a storm strikes, and a fire erupts. Taking advantage of the chaos, a pack of ferocious Gorgosaurus attacks the scattered herd. They kill the rest of Patchi and Scowler's family while their leader and alpha, Gorgon, fights and kills Bulldust, while trying to defend Patchi and Scowler. Afterwards, Patchi's herd, which is now led by Bulldust's rival Major, combine with Juniper's as they continue their migration where Gorgon's pack attacks them again. In the ensuing chaos, Patchi, Scowler, and Juniper fall into a river and are swept downstream to the ocean, with Alex following them from above. At a beach, Scowler follows a herd of Edmontosaurus to find food, callously leaving Patchi and Juniper behind. The two make their way through a forest and eventually are able to find their herd and Scowler.\nAfter years of making the same migration from north to south and vice versa, a grown up Scowler becomes the herd's new leader after defeating Major and chooses Juniper to be his mate, much to Patchi's disappointment. Scowler recklessly leads the herd onto a frozen lake, but Patchi is able to lead the majority of the herd to safety. Enraged and believing that Patchi is going to be usurping him and also trying to take Juniper from him, Scowler confronts his brother and challenges him for a battle in exchange for leadership of the herd. Scowler, since he is a lot taller and stronger than Patchi, quickly gains the upper hand and defeats his brother by trapping him under a tree before disowning him and ordering Juniper along with the rest of the herd to leave Patchi behind. Despondent and heartbroken, Patchi, who is now trapped underneath the tree and unable to do anything, attempts to accept his fate by allowing Pterodactyls to kill and eat him, but Alex convinces him to die for something worth dying for as Bulldust did.\nReinvigorated by the advice, Patchi escapes and fights off the Pterodactyls, before catching up to the herd, only to find them confronted by Gorgon and his pack again. As Gorgon easily overpowers and injures him in battle, a repentant Scowler orders Patchi to save himself and lead the herd to safety. However, Patchi leads them into fighting Gorgon and his pack to save Scowler instead of fleeing. The herd successfully drive off the Gorgosaurus pack while Patchi defeats Gorgon by dislocating his arm that had gotten caught in the hole of Patchi's frill before knocking out some of Gorgon's teeth with a headbutt, saving Scowler's life and avenging Bulldust's death. \nThe brothers reconcile before Scowler concedes leadership of the herd to Patchi, who goes on to have Juniper as his mate and has a family with her, with Alex acting uncle.

He works with DS Sarah Hawks, with whom he is on good terms. While escorting a prisoner, Dean Warns, an ex-soldier suspected of being involved in an illegal arms trade, they are met by ambitious Commander Thomas Geiger and DCI Nathan Bartnick who inform them that Warns is to be released due to lack of evidence. Warns had been seen by a security guard in a container yard in connection with the offence but now the guard has retracted his statement.\nLewinsky learns that Sternwood's son, Ruan, has collapsed on an aircraft runway while travelling under an alias and has been hospitalized.

The police ignore Lewinsky's doubts; they go to Iceland and surround Sternwood's property but he escapes, leaving behind a booby trap bomb which kills several policemen. Lewinsky suggests that Ruan's location be made public to draw Jacob out of hiding, and offers to stay in the hospital with Sarah to await Jacob's appearance. Jacob goes to the hospital to confirm his son's situation and manages to leave without being caught. Ruan dies shortly afterwards but it is decided not to reveal this on the off-chance that Sternwood will return to try to free his son.

Lewinsky complies without revealing that Ruan is dead, and takes Sternwood to the hospital mortuary. Sternwood is heartbroken and incensed by the realisation that his son is dead. Whilst at the hospital mortuary Lewinsky discovers that Sarah is dead when he comes across her body on a stretcher.\nSternwood and Lewinsky now confront Warns at his house. Warns is told that his collaboration with Geiger is known, along with the details of the gunrunning trade.

Lewinsky and Sternwood force Warns to go with them to the meeting. When Geiger arrives they ambush him. Lewinsky blames Geiger for Sarah's death and accuses him of complicity in the arms deal among other criminal dealings. Geiger admits \"turning a blind eye\" on many occasions.

An archival clip is shown of Julian Rose, performing with a thick accent as \"Our Hebrew Friend\", denigrating his own show, \"I think it's rotten\". The film's opening credits play.Berman and other comedians of his era disagree with Zweig's notion that Jewish humour is unique, arguing they did not use their culture for laughs. A television clip shows Alan King providing a Jewish perspective on a domineering wife. Shifting to the following generation, there is a change in perspective. David Steinberg states, \"Jews owned humour\", while Mark Breslin states, \"The history of 20th-century humour is Jewish, period.\" Breslin compares comedy to Jewish jazz and other interviewees say the rhythm of Yiddish has a comedic timing. Several comedians note that, as children, they had at least one older Jewish relative they consider to be as funny as modern professional comedians.Several of the interviewees opine Jewish humour resulted as a survival mechanism. They suggest that, as Jews were a long-oppressed people, they became frequent complainers, which became a way of life. The interviewees suggest the older generation of Jews they knew were so used to bad times they felt guilty or uncomfortable in good times. Rather than admit positivity, Jews used sarcasm, returned questions with questions, and employed a hostile passive-aggressiveness. The interviewees suggest comedy became a way for Jews to express themselves; they had an outsider perspective that helped find jokes and a sarcastic edge that could address taboo subjects. It is further noted the critical nature of Jews made them tough audiences, so the Borscht Belt provided venues for Jewish comedians to hone their acts.The Jews' tight-knit community and shared experience began to disappear with assimilation, and success within North American society removed their reasons to complain or be fearful. Zweig states humour was his strongest connection with Jewish culture and is concerned he will lose this connection once the older generation of Jews are gone. Some interviewees suggest solutions; Howie Mandel says of Jewish humour; \"it's still there, we just have different accents\".Zweig's motives are called into question throughout the film. Marc Maron suggests Zweig is nostalgic for the older Yiddish mannerisms that made him laugh and feel comforted as a child. Zweig notes his wife is not Jewish and that he has become concerned about their young daughter's upbringing, worrying his mother-in-law will secretly have her baptized. Cory Kahaney notes Judaism is about the freedom to ask questions, that there is no single approach to being a Jew and that Zweig can find a way to raise his daughter that works for him and his wife.Berman notes the connection he feels while speaking with someone in Yiddish. While recalling his dead son, he becomes moved to sing a song in Yiddish, which he explains means \"the town I grew up in, I'm missing\" \u2013 that the past cannot be revisited, but can be recollected in sharing stories of it.

Finnerty escorts Raphelson to an underground command center in the Pentagon, while Vice President Alvin Hammond is taken aboard Air Force Two. At the same time, a paramilitary team of mercenaries led by ex-Delta Force and CIA operative Emil Stenz infiltrate the White House and overwhelm the Secret Service, seizing the building. The tour group is taken hostage in the Blue Room by white nationalist Carl Killick, but Cale escapes to search for Emily, separated during the tour. Retiring Head of the Presidential Detail, Special Agent-in-Charge Martin Walker brings Sawyer to the PEOC beneath the White House Library. Inside, Walker kills Sawyer's detail, including fellow agent Ted Hope, revealing himself as the leader of the attack, apparently seeking vengeance against Sawyer for his Marine son, Kevin Walker, who was killed in a botched mission in Iran the year prior.

It is later revealed that Paraiti trains pregnant young women in birthing procedures and secretly uses a variety of herbs and plants to apply ancient healing methods to her patients.On a rare visit to town, Paraiti is approached by Maraea (Rachel House), the M\u0101ori housekeeper of a wealthy white woman named Rebecca Vickers (Antonia Prebble). Rebecca is pregnant and seeks to terminate the pregnancy before her wealthy husband, a businessman, returns from an extended absence in Europe. Paraiti would be paid handsomely for her services and discretion, provided she could perform the abortion in less than a week's time. Initially, Paraiti refuses to help, but changes her mind when a young M\u0101ori girl and her unborn baby die at the hands of a white nurse. The scene has been described as a harrowing turning point for Paraiti, as she is forced to retrieve the whenua (placenta) of the stillborn child from a rusted garbage can in order to return it to her land and people. Paraiti decides to help Rebecca as her way of \u201crestoring some justice\u201d, although it is unclear exactly what she means.  \nMrs Vickers is an \"imperious snob\" who shows obvious disdain towards Paraiti and her \u201cancient ways.\u201d Maraea proves an even greater adversary, refusing to speak to Paraiti in their native language and speaking down to her. Nevertheless, Paraiti remains stoic. As the week progresses, Paraiti begins to uncover hidden secrets within the house, while revealing her own plan for justice. The pivotal turning point occurs when it is revealed that Maraea is Rebecca's mother and has been bleaching her skin daily since childhood to ensure her survival in a white world. The birth of the baby would reveal her true identity to her husband and to society.\nThe final scene of the film depicts Rebecca giving birth on clay under the house, surrounded by Paraiti and Maraea.", "tmdb_id": 204397}, "44428235": {"title": "White Rabbit (2013 film)", "plot": "Harlon Mackey has been tormented by visions since his alcoholic father forced him to kill an innocent rabbit while hunting as a boy.

Left with nothing but his own thoughts, Bruce practices his statement to the police. During the imaginary conversations, he becomes overcome with emotion when told that his victim had children.\nAs Bruce wrestles with his guilty conscience, flashbacks reveal that the dead man, Paul, was Bruce's \nhouseguest. Leaving a convenience store and coming across Paul in his vehicle attempting to commit suicide by inhaling vehicle exhaust fumes, unplugging the hose, Bruce starts conversation with Paul, admiring his vehicle and eventually commandeers the vehicle, driving around casually with Paul, developing a casual friendship, though Bruce becomes frustrated when Paul takes advantage of his hospitality and requests a loan. Bruce, a widower who has fallen on hard times after he lost his job due to drunkenly crashing his snowplow into a restaurant, explains that he can not help Paul.

The plight of the two gamers and the insular world of  multiplayer online gaming, is documented by two young film-makers, Joe (Joe Stretch) and Chris (Chris Killen), who hope to make an award-winning film about the gamers' social failure and the demise of Wizard's Way, an antiquated online multiplayer game with a rapidly dwindling fanbase. Even with Barry's guidance, the workings of the early-generation game remain somewhat obscure, involving Medieval wizards, dragons and various rural townsfolk competing for points in an extremely rudimentary game, characterized by poorly pixilated imagery, limited color options and painfully slow game action.\nThe film-makers are especially keen to find the game's undisputed master, known as \"Windows,\" who happens to live in the same town.

Bernardo reveals that he strongly suspects it was the work of a woman named Rosa, with whom he'd been carrying an affair for some time. Rosa is taken in for questioning. At first, she is reluctant to speak, and tells the police that she was blackmailed into taking the girl at the behest of a woman named Bete, whose husband was supposedly involved in an affair with Sylvia. This is exposed as a lie by the police after an investigation of the neighborhood reveals that no such woman exists, and after the police officer threatens her, Rosa confesses everything.\nRosa and Bernardo met a train station after the latter saw on her the train and followed her.

After belittling and insulting Mick, the two officers give him a speeding ticket and an order to get rid of his truck. Soon after in retaliation, Mick shoots O'Connor in the head as the officers drive away, causing the car to crash in a gully. Despite Bulmer's desperate pleas, Mick breaks his leg, stabs him in the back with a bowie knife and places the mortally wounded officer back in the car before dousing it with petrol and setting it alight.

They recruit several of Jordan's friends, whom Jordan trains in the art of the \"hard sell\". Jordan's tactics and salesmanship largely contribute to the success of his pump and dump scheme, in which misleading, positive statements inflate a stock's price so it can be sold at an artificially high price. When the scheme's perpetrators sell their overvalued securities, the price plummets, and those who were conned into buying at the inflated price are left with stock that is suddenly worth much less than they paid.

Jordan proceeds to Switzerland to forge her name and save the account. To bypass border controls, he orders his yacht captain to sail to Monaco, but the ship capsizes in a storm. After their rescue, the plane sent to take them to Geneva is destroyed when a seagull flies into the engine; Jordan takes this as a sign from God to address his worsening drug addiction and attempts to sober up.\nIn 1998, the FBI arrests Jordan because Saurel, detained for an unrelated offense, has informed the FBI about Jordan. Since the evidence against him is overwhelming, Jordan agrees to gather evidence on his colleagues in exchange for leniency.

One of these children, K-29 ( Huzi) who has the power of the '17-seconds-deadly moves' (also known as the wrath of Vajra), grows up to be an especially gifted assassin. There's no one at Hades who could defeat him, except Daisuke Kurashige whose powers were an equal match to that of K-29. However Daisuke lacked the true power of Vajra that K-29 had. The cult grows evil in its ways where the children are made to fight each other and in this process, K-29's brother ( K- 31) who fights against K-29 supposedly dies. Unable to bear the guilt for his brother's death, K-29 swears a secret oath of revenge against the Hades cult. So now, K-29 who's the greatest assassin in the temple and who is rightfully the Vajra king defeats his counterparts  including Daisuke- where K- 29 gives Daisuke a scar on his face while defeating him. But K-29 doesn't kill them, and moves to Shaolin to begin his peaceful life along with his very young brother Qinquong. There he is guided by a monk. \nHowever, he still waits for an opportunity to destroy the Hades cult that was responsible for making him a living weapon. As time grows the cult gets dissolved   and as many years pass, the legend of the king of Vajra becomes a myth faded into obscurity and the wrath of Vajra becomes a mystery. In the meantime, the ruling prince of that land visits the founder of the hades cult - Sensei Amano (who is now in prison and has grown old) and tells him to revive the cult once again so that fear can be instilled among the people. The cult leader agrees and entrusts this revival task to his most trusted and talented pupil- Daisuke Kurashige ( who being a child of the Hades cult has now become an exceptionally great warrior and has not given up the principles of Hades unlike K-29) to resume the cult at hades shrine by beginning a game of death where renowned warriors are summoned from all over the globe and made to fight against the Hades warriors and the ones who emerge victorious will be proclaimed to have the Vajra in them. Daisuke agrees to this and also wrongfully acknowledges himself to be the Vajra king and he makes the people believe that his counterparts- Tetsumaku ( a great fist warrior)  and crazy monkey ( a blood thirsty hyper- flexible warrior) to also have the Vajra in them. However the people there including some of Daisuke's servants fail to believe Daisuke for they know for sure that this is a false propaganda, and they also know that the one who has the real power of Vajra is K-29. This enrages Daisuke and Amano and so they device a plan to somehow bring back K-29 to Hades shrine so that Daisuke could kill him ( K-29) and shatter the people's belief that K-29 is the real king of Vajra (Moreover Daisuke was also eagerly waiting for 12 years to avenge K- 29 for the scar he had given him earlier). \nSo they kidnap K-29's younger brother- Qinquong and forcefully add him to the rest of the cult children- who will be later mindwashed to accept Hades cult. The news reaches K-29, which angers him and so he returns from Shaolin (after getting the blessings of his chief monk) to Hades shrine to avenge the abduction of his younger brother (Qinquong). There at the Hades shrine, he (K-29) is given an open challenge by Daisuke that if he defeats Tetsumaku and crazy monkey, then he (K-29) would have a chance to fight against him (Daisuke). K-29 agrees to this and defeats Tetsumaku and crazy monkey with exceptionally talented skills. Daisuke realises that K-29 has saved his Vajra stance during these fights and has not revealed them, only to defeat him (Daisuke) in the last moment, as both were equally matched. Seeing this many warriors join hands with K-29 and the cult of hades gets splitted into two factions- the one that supports K-29 and the one that supports Daisuke. A rebellion ensues between them and Daisuke is surprised to find out that Hades warriors are using weapons instead of fighting by hand. It's now that he (Daisuke) realises that the cult of Hades is a hoax just to instill fear in the minds of people. During this coup, Amano's daughter- Eko ( who was sent by Amano to report the events at Hades shrine) gets killed while trying to save the children. Meanwhile K-29 and Daisuke enter into a duel combat where K-29 defeats Daisuke by unleashing the wrath of Vajra through his '17- second deadly moves'. Before dying, Daisuke proclaims K-29 as the King of Vajra and then succumbs. K-29 also realises that the undertaker there, who was taking care of the dead was in fact his elder brother- K-31 whom he thought was killed by him (K-29) during his childhood. However K-31 reveals to him that he had not died but was saved by some good people and that he had been waiting in disguise all these years for K-29 to return and avenge Daisuke.

Eventually, the two did finally engage in sex, but, the morning after, the Star's son vanished, and she has been searching for him ever since.\nThe experience is interrupted by the Slut calling out for her mother to return as Matthias did for Ali, which prompts the arrival of a hooded figure with a mirror for a face. At first, the figure speaks with the Slut's mother's voice, giving her name, age, and cause of death, but quickly begins speaking in countless other voices, telling of hundreds of people and how they died. Furious, Ali punches the mirror, and sees Matthias' face behind it. Rushing to their bedroom, she finds him, having slit his throat with the mirror there. Despite her best efforts, Ali cannot revive him. The group, now all racked by grief, then engages in their orgy in the living room.\nAfterwards, Ali and Udo escort the guests out. Udo consoles the Slut to find joy in her nymphomania, while the Teen and the Star exchange jewelry as tokens of affection, and the Stud offers his jacket to Ali. Ali goes over to the Teen, and places her fingers in his mouth, realizing he is the driver from the motorcycle. Concerned for where he will next go, Udo and Ali walk with the Teen for a while, before he goes to depart as the sun rises. Ali asks what the Teen's name is, which he reveals as Sacha. Tearfully, Ali and Udo express that they have come to care for him greatly, and offer immortality and the chance to stay with them, not as a replacement for Matthias, but as a new family.

Lonely and often ignored and belittled by the people around him \u2013 even his own teacher, who envies the boy's talent \u2013 T.S. spends most of his time playing, making amateur inventions, and meandering around the ranch with the family dog, Tapioca. T.S. reveals that he had a fraternal twin brother, Layton, who was much more into cowboy-themed things, like his father, but not as scientifically inclined as T.S. was. A tragedy unfolds as T.S. describes how he and his brother were out playing in an old barn on the property.\nT.S. receives notice from the Smithsonian Institution, all the way across the country in Washington, that he has won the Baird Award for inventing a perpetual motion machine. Ms. Jibsen, the museum director, believes that T.S. is a grown man, and that the little boy on the telephone is the son of the prize-winner. Initially reluctant, T.S. decides that the best course of action is to run away from home to receive the prize. Before leaving, he packs a suitcase and takes one last look at Layton's old bedroom, a shrine of dusty toys and furniture that his parents are unable to bring themselves to throw away. T.S. passes his sister and his father upon leaving, who are both too wrapped up in their own daily routines to notice him.\nThat day, T.S. travels initially by train, hitching a ride in one of the rail cars, where he plays and imagines that Layton is still there with him, clear enough for a conversation. After nearly being caught by a guard at the train station, T.S. realizes that he needs to be careful, opting to sleep in an auction show camper that's being transported (there's a life-sized cardboard stencil of a family eating dinner that he can mimic so a guard looking in thinks he's just part of the art). He only leaves the camper at night, in search of food, where he meets a hobo going by the moniker \"Two Clouds\". Two Clouds tells the boy a whimsical story of a sparrow and a pine tree, suggesting that everybody reaches the right destination for themselves eventually. T.S. contemplates using a nearby payphone to call his family, but he can't bring himself to do it.\nThe next day, T.S. walks along the railroad tracks with his backpack (having stored his suitcase in a nearby electrical grid box), when a fat, mean-spirited policeman begins chasing him and shouting profanities at him. T.S. is forced to climb atop a separating bridge where a boat is passing through. Realizing that maybe he went too far, the policeman panics when T.S. nearly falls to his death, instructing him on how to climb back up to safety, but once T.S. is safe, he goes right back to chasing him again. T.S. eventually loses him, where he hitchhikes with a friendly trucker named Rick, a man who enjoys meeting people and chronicling this in photography. T.S. realizes, after inquiring about a photo of Rick in military garb pointing a machine gun at an Arab man's head, that Rick was a soldier post-9/11. Rick tries to downplay the experience with dark humour. Allowing T.S. to sleep on the truck, he notices that the boy is injured from nearly falling off the bridge earlier that day, and advises him to see a doctor.\nAfter Rick drops him off in Washington, T.S. meets Ms. Jibsen at the Smithsonian. Skeptical that the boy could possibly be the one who invented the motion machine, T.S. proves her wrong by describing his scientific process. T.S. fibs and says he's an orphan, fearing that his parents will show up and be angry at him if they discover where he is. Ms. Jibsen, basking in T.S.'s spotlight, insists on being his new guardian and accompanying him to the conference where he'll be given the Baird Award. She often speaks over him though, much like most of the adults in his life do, which annoys him. He sits at a table alone during the conference, but is suddenly swarmed by a crowd of admirers when it's discovered that he's the boy who made the prizewinning invention.\nT.S. gives a speech, where he eventually reveals that Layton shot himself in the barn, bringing his audience to tears. He admits, sobbing, that nobody ever even talks about Layton anymore, as if his brother never even existed. Unbeknownst to him, his mother watches from the rafters, having driven to Washington to find him. When T.S. appears on a sensationalist talk show later on, the host, Roy, is interrupted by T.S.'s mother, much to Ms. Jibsen's anger when she realizes that she can't be in charge of T.S. anymore. After a tense reunion, T.S. hugs his mother, but as they both leave, Roy and Ms. Jibsen chase after them. Ms. Jibsen, having gotten herself drunk, swears at T.S. and insults him. T.S.'s father appears and punches out Roy for harassing his son, while T.S.'s mother punches Ms. Jibsen. T.S. apologizes for hurting his father's feelings, but his father smiles at him and gives him a piggyback ride, letting the boy wear his favourite cowboy hat.\nBack at home, it's revealed through T.S. in an epilogue that his mother just gave birth to a new baby.

When Qohen goes to Bainsley's website at an unplanned time, he discovers her performing as a webcam stripper and logs off abruptly. He later returns to the site and finds his access has been blocked.\nWeeks later, Bob returns with Qohen's VR suit, which he says he has turned into a \"prototype soul-searching device\". Bob gets Dr. Shrink-Rom to confirm that the phone call Qohen is waiting for is a delusion but says the upgraded suit has the ability to connect Qohen with his soul, assuming he has one. Bainsley arrives and says that, while she initially agreed to seduce Qohen because Joby said she could keep her VR suit if she did so, she developed real feelings for Qohen. She offers to run away with him but Qohen turns her down. He and Bob take a break from work and go to a park, where Qohen reveals he was once married.\nBack at the church, Bob's health declines rapidly, and Qohen cares for him. Once Bob is asleep, Qohen finds and smashes the cameras Management hid throughout the building. Two of Management's employees break in and take Bob away and, later, Joby drops by to blame Qohen for getting him fired. Once alone, Qohen dons his upgraded VR suit and tries to connect to his computer but there is a problem and he is electrocuted.\nFinding himself in front of the Neural Net Mancrive, a massive supercomputer that is the destination for all of the entities crunched by the employees of Mancom, Qohen is greeted by Management, who tells him Bob has been hospitalized due to a chronic illness. Qohen asks if Management is real or just in his mind and is told that it does not matter, as he is now part of the Neural Net. He asks what the point of his life is but Management says he does not know, as Mancom is still crunching the data but he believes the Universe came from and will return to chaos. Management states his goal was never to prove life has no meaning but to improve his models so he can make more money by bringing order to the natural disorder. The reason Qohen was chosen to work on the Zero Theorem is that he is a man of faith, which represents the antithesis of Management's project. Unfortunately, Management says, the faith that led Qohen to spend his life waiting for the phone call he believed would give his life meaning caused him to live a meaningless life.\nAfter saying he no longer requires Qohen's services, Management disappears. Qohen destroys the Neural Net, which blows open, revealing the black hole vortex from his nightmare inside, though now there are countless pictures, including one of Bainsley, swirling toward the center. He begins to walk away, but turns back and smiling, jumps into the vortex. Alone on the virtual beach, a calm, naked (and still-bald) Qohen stands looking out to sea. He goes over to where he had a picnic with Bainsley and picks her bikini top up off the sand. A beach ball floats by, and he throws it up in the air a few times before he does the same thing with the Sun, which then sets. Mixed in with the music as the credits begin, Bainsley can be heard calling Qohen's name and laughing.", "tmdb_id": 157834}, "71060411": {"title": "Ziddi (2013 film)", "plot": "Krishnakumar is a resident of Theerthahalli.
