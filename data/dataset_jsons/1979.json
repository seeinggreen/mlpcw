He meets an old friend from the underground communist movement, Zolt\u00e1n D\u00e1niel, now a government official who fishes at the Danube, near the dike.  D\u00e1niel falls in the river, and Pelik\u00e1n rescues him and invites him to his home. While the two reminisce old times at Pelik\u00e1n's home, the \u00c1VH suddenly appears. They received a \"serious anonymous report\" stating Pelik\u00e1n committed an illegal act of slaughtering a pig for food.  D\u00e1niel tries to save him by demonstrating to the \u00c1VH thugs how the loyal Pelik\u00e1n hid him during the purgings years before, but he unknowingly reveals the basement, where all the pork had been hidden.  Pelik\u00e1n is taken to prison though later released, on \"higher command\".

The film transitions to still images and begins the narrative that is told entirely through the voice of a narrator (Robert Darmel). The narrative begins with little girls at a school playground. One young girl, Monique (Silke Humel), is told by another that the women she thinks is her mother is in fact not her mother. Monique goes home to Madame Duvivier who she thinks is her mother to discuss this new information.

She has been with many men, which was a trend that began when she became sexually intimate with one of her patients at a hospital. There is then a transition to Christmas Eve 1966. Monique goes out to a bar with her friend and is asked to dance by a rich man. After having some drinks, he drives her home. She sees this man for months because he financially supports her. Monique, haunted by her upbringing, eventually resorts to prostitution.\nThere is an insert of footage of tied up dogs barking in the streets.

Monique is visited by her old friend Alice (Marie Christine Poisot), who threatens to reveal Monique's past if she doesn't receive money and a place to stay from Monique. Monique provides Alice with what to had requested. With the sound of dogs barking in the background, Alice begins to feel attracted to Henri. Henri too, falls in love with her. Monique forgives him for being disloyal. One day at a park while Henri and Alice play ball, Monique kills herself and her three-year-old son.\nOver an insert of barking dogs behind a gate, the narrator reveals that Henri marries Alice. Later discovering Alice is more similar to Monique than he thought, he seeks revenge and kills Alice.

After getting involved in illegal work, Henri gets put in jail. Repeating a similar scene from earlier in the film, a sick man in prison calls for Henri's help and they become sexually involved. After being released he becomes a suspect in the murder of Alice. There is then another insert of city street scenes. Returning to still images, Henri undergoes a sex change to disguise himself.

Gradually it becomes apparent that the source of this rift is an abortion that Marcia had, possibly in secret, because of it being the result of an affair with another man. As tensions between the couple escalate, nature is not pleased with their environmental wrongdoing and starts to strike back, first by an eagle and possum attacking Peter, and then through more insidious means.

Unbeknown to him, he has failed to observe the proper bureaucratic procedures when bringing his film reels into the country, which forces customs officials at Nice Airport to seize them until further notice. In another queue at the airport is Maria Barone, a glamorous former actress and the wife of leading Italian film producer Federico 'Freddie' Barone. Maria's dog Mortimer is also retained at customs, after she is found to have concealed the animal in her hand luggage.\nThe following day, Hal returns to the airport to attend an interview at the customs agency with Lt. Montand, who tells him that the reels will not be released until the film censor has viewed them, which may not happen for another month. Leaving the office in a fury, Hal bumps into Maria, who has just been reunited with her dog. Informing her of his plight, she encourages him to persevere. The following day, Hal again encounters Maria in the lobby of the Hotel Carlton and invites her to lunch. Charmed by the young man's attention, Maria reckons that she can persuade her husband to contact the customs authorities and intervene on Hal's behalf. She then takes Hal to meet Freddie, who graciously agrees to phone the airport immediately.\nIn gratitude, Hal asks them both along to a party in Nice being hosted by his friend, Andrew Jackson \u2013 a sardonic director-producer, in town to publicise his own blaxploitation film. Although a visibly flustered Maria declines the invitation, when the party is in full swing later that evening she suddenly turns up unannounced. Hal and Maria dance and talk, later going back to Hal's room at the local Novotel to make love. Lying in bed afterwards, Maria admits that this is the first time she has cheated on her spouse.

As they are entering the hotel Hal spies Montand sitting at a nearby restaurant, who delivers the good news that the censor will now view his film.\nHal and Maria then enjoy a blissful day out in the country, at the end of which he complains about not being able to spend an entire night with her. Although distressed at having to deceive her husband, Maria asks Freddie if she can spend two days away in Paris prior to his film's gala premiere \u2013 a request to which the latter agrees without complaint. Hal, meanwhile, having already found that Jackson has muscled in on his film and taken control of its publicity campaign \u2013 including changing the title from the bland \"Choice of Ending\" to the more lurid \"Shoot Me Before I Kill Again\" \u2013 now has to endure the censor's screening before he and Maria can meet for their planned few days together. After nervously introducing it to a seemingly nonplussed audience, Hal finds his film has inspired positive reactions \u2013 Jackson pronounces it \"sensational\", while Montand reports that the film can finally be brought into the country. But Maria, who is also in attendance, is much less enthusiastic about what she has seen, and upon being forced to reveal her true feelings in the car afterwards she and Hal have a row, causing him to petulantly abandon her and hitchhike alone back to Cannes.\nHal is overcome with remorse by the next morning and returns to the Carlton, where he is able to follow Maria's limousine as it heads to the Barone family yacht for an outing prior to Freddie's evening gala premiere. Pursuing her onto a speedboat, Hal manages to separate Maria from her companions and drives the boat out into the middle of the bay, where it runs out of fuel. In an effort to prove his love, he throws his precious film reels into the water. Maria is unimpressed, however, pointing out that he still has the original 16mm negative, so the gesture means nothing. Only after Hal begrudgingly proclaims out loud that he loves her more than his film are the two reconciled. Eventually whisked away to attend the gala premiere by her security detail, Maria leaves Hal to make his own way back to the shore. Realising that Maria is set to leave the festival for good after the premiere is over, once on land Hal persuades Jackson to drive him to the airport. There he stops Maria and Freddie before they board their private jet. Maria explains that, although she loves him, she needs someone who considers her \"more important than anything\".

Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Although there is strong new evidence that McCullaugh is innocent, Fleming refuses to consider his appeal due to its late submission, so he remains in prison. Kirkland then starts a new case, defending Ralph Agee, a young black cross-dresser arrested for a robbery, who is terrified of being sent to prison.\nKirkland pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam, in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Kirkland was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Kirkland also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer.\nKirkland has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford, who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter.

Rayford, a Korean War veteran, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse and an M1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times. He even eats his lunch on a ledge outside his office window, four stories up.\nOne day, unexpectedly, Kirkland is requested to defend Judge Fleming, who has been accused of brutally assaulting and raping a young woman. As the two loathe each other, Fleming feels that having the person who publicly hates him argue his innocence will be to his advantage. Fleming blackmails Kirkland with an old violation of lawyer-client confidentiality, for which Kirkland will likely be disbarred if it were to come to light.\nKirkland's friend and partner, Jay Porter, is also unstable. He feels guilt for gaining acquittals for defendants who were truly guilty of violent crimes. Porter shows up drunk at Kirkland's apartment, after one of his (guilty) clients kills two kids following his acquittal. After a violent breakdown inside the courthouse \u2013 wherein he ends up throwing dinner plates at everybody in the hallway \u2013 Porter is taken to a hospital. Before leaving in the ambulance, Kirkland asks another partner, Warren Fresnell, to handle Agee's court hearing in his absence. Kirkland gives Fresnell a corrected version of Agee's probation report and stresses that it must be shown to the judge so that Agee will receive probation, rather than serve jail time. Fresnell shows up late and forgets to give the judge the corrected version, causing Agee to be sentenced to jail time. Kirkland is livid and attacks Fresnell's car, revealing that 30 minutes after he was sentenced, Agee committed suicide. Meanwhile, Jeff McCullaugh, who has been sexually and physically assaulted by other inmates, finally snaps and takes two hostages. Kirkland pleads with him to surrender, promising to get him out, but a police sniper shoots and kills McCullaugh when he moves in front of a window.\nA clearly disturbed Kirkland takes on Judge Fleming's case. He tries to talk the prosecuting attorney, Frank Bowers, into throwing the case out but Bowers, who recognizes the prestige that convicting a judge would earn him, refuses to back down. Kirkland meets with another client, Carl Travers, who offers photographs proving that Fleming engaged in BDSM acts with a prostitute. Gail Packer warns Kirkland not to betray a client, revealing that the ethics committee has been keeping their eye on him ever since the contempt of court incident. Kirkland shows the pictures to Fleming, who freely admits he is guilty of the rape.\nAs the trial opens, Fleming, while looking at the victim, makes a casual remark to Kirkland that he \"wouldn't mind seeing her again sometime.\" Kirkland's face indicates his disgust. In his opening statement, Kirkland begins by mocking Bowers' case while speculating on the ultimate objective of the American legal system. He appears to be making a strong case to exonerate Fleming \u2013 but then, unexpectedly, he bursts out that the prosecution is not going to get Fleming, because he is going to get him and declares that his client is guilty. Judge Rayford yells that Kirkland is \"out of order,\" to which Kirkland retorts, \"You're out of order! You're out of order! The whole trial is out of order! They're out of order!\" Kirkland is dragged out of the courtroom, venting his rage all the way and condemning Fleming for his and the legal system's abuse of the law.

During this time Rand's personal physician, Dr. Allenby, becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that the mystery of his identity may have a more mundane explanation. Dr. Allenby considers telling Rand this, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days.\nThe dying Rand encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey\". She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, which happens to be showing on the TV. When the scene ends, Chauncey stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but decides she is willing to masturbate for his voyeuristic pleasure, thereby not noticing that he has turned back to the TV and is now imitating a yoga exercise on a different channel.\nChance is present at Rand's death and shows genuine sadness at his passing. Questioned by Dr. Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener.

(\"Vital Information Necessary CENTralized\").\nAs it is returning to Earth, the Palomino discovers a black hole with the apparently abandoned and long-lost USS Cygnus nearby, the same ship that McCrae's father was aboard when it vanished 20 years ago. (Cygnus X-1 is the first-known black hole, discovered in 1964, after which this scientific vessel is presumably named.) The Palomino decide to investigate and finds that there is a mysterious null gravity field surrounding the Cygnus that allows it to defy the massive gravitational pull of the black hole. The Palomino briefly strays outside the field and is damaged by the intense gravity, forcing it to emergency dock with the Cygnus, which no longer appears abandoned.\nThe cautious Palomino crew soon encounter Dr. Hans Reinhardt (one of Earth's most brilliant scientists, according to Durant). Reinhardt explains he has been alone on the Cygnus since it encountered a meteor field and was disabled. He ordered the human crew to return to Earth without him, but Kate's father chose to remain aboard and has since died. To replace the crew, Reinhardt built faceless, black-robed drones, sentry robots and his sinister bodyguard robot, Maximilian. Reinhardt says he intends to fly the Cygnus through the black hole because 20 years of study has shown that it's possible. Only an enamoured Durant believes him and asks if he can accompany Reinhardt.\nHowever, the rest of the Palomino crew start to become suspicious of Reinhardt. Booth sees a drone limping, while Holland witnesses an android funeral and discovers personal items in the Cygnus crew quarters. V.I.N.CENT. meets a battered earlier model of his type named BO.B. (\"BiO-sanitation Battalion\"). BO.B explains the drones are actually what's left of the human crew, who mutinied when Reinhardt refused to return to Earth after the Cygnus was damaged. McCrae's father was killed leading the mutiny, and the crew was lobotomized and \"reprogrammed\" to serve Reinhardt. V.I.N.CENT. uses telepathy to tell Kate. After she informs Durant what really happened, he removes a drone's faceplate, revealing the zombie-like face of a crew member. Durant tries to flee with Kate, but is killed by Maximilian.\nReinhardt orders his robots to lobotomize Kate, but just as the process begins, she is rescued by Holland, V.I.N.CENT. and BO.B. Harry Booth tries to escape alone in the Palomino, but is shot down and fatally crashes into the Cygnus. A subsequent meteor storm and the explosion of the ship's overstressed main power plant cause the anti-gravity generator to fail. Without its null-gravity bubble, the Cygnus quickly starts to break apart under the black hole's huge gravitational forces.\nReinhardt and the Palomino survivors separately plan their escape in the probe ship used to study the black hole. Reinhardt orders Maximilian to prepare the ship for launch, but then a large viewscreen falls on Reinhardt, pinning him to the deck, surrounded by his lobotomized crew.

Now turning 19, they all graduated from high school the year before and are not sure what to do with their lives. They spend much of their time together swimming in an old, abandoned water-filled quarry. They sometimes clash with the more affluent Indiana University students in their hometown, who habitually refer to them as \"cutters\", a derogatory term for locals related to the local Indiana limestone industry and the stonecutters who worked the quarries. (The term \"cutters\" was invented for the movie, because the real name \"stonies\u201d was deemed unusable because of its perceived link to marijuana.)\nDave is obsessed with competitive bicycle racing, and Italian racers in particular, because he recently won a Masi bicycle. His down-to-earth father Ray, a former stonecutter who now operates his own used car business (sometimes unethically), is puzzled and exasperated by his son's love of Italian music and culture, which Dave associates with cycling. However, his mother Evelyn is more understanding and prepares Italian dishes for him.\nDave develops a crush on a university student named Katherine and masquerades as an Italian exchange student in order to romance her. One evening, he serenades \"Caterina\" outside her sorority house by singing Friedrich von Flotow's aria \"M' Appar\u00ec Tutt' Amor\", with Cyril providing guitar accompaniment. When her boyfriend Rod finds out, he and some of his fraternity brothers beat Cyril up, mistaking him for Dave. Though Cyril wants no trouble, Mike insists on tracking down Rod and starting a brawl. The university president (real-life then President Dr. John W. Ryan) reprimands the students for their arrogance toward the \"cutters\" and, over their objections, invites the latter to participate in the annual Indiana University Little 500 race.\nWhen a professional Italian cycling team comes to town for a race, Dave is thrilled to be competing with them. However, the Italians become irked when Dave is able to keep up with them. One of them jams a tire pump in Dave's wheel, causing him to crash, which leaves him disillusioned. He subsequently confesses his deception to Katherine, who is heartbroken.\nDave's friends persuade him to join them in forming a cycling team for the Little 500. Ray privately tells his son how, when he was a young stonecutter, he was proud to help provide the material to construct the university, yet he never felt comfortable on campus. Later, Dave runs into Katherine, who is leaving for a job in Chicago; they patch things up.\nDave is so much better than the other competitors in the Little 500 that, while the other teams switch cyclists every few laps, he rides without a break and builds up a 3/4 lap lead. However, he injures his leg in a crash. Bleeding and in pain, he comes in for a rider change. After some hesitation, Mike, Cyril, and Moocher take turns pedaling, but their dithering has cost them the lead. They fall further and further back. Finally, Dave has them tape his feet to the pedals and starts to make up lost ground; he overtakes Rod, the current rider for the favored fraternity team, on the last lap and wins.\nRay is proud of his son and takes to riding a bicycle himself.

Branwell is a painter and a self-portrait with his sisters is worthy of the general admiration of the family. He wants to pursue a professional career, but only goes as far as to establish a friendship with Leyland, a sculptor. Emily's favorite pastime is to walk across the bleak moors that surround the village dressed as a man. Anne, the youngest of the siblings, is her companion. Charlotte, more ambitious than the others, convinces their reluctant aunt to give her money to go to Belgium in order to study French. Her idea is to eventually come back and open a school. With their aunt's money and permission, Charlotte and Emily go to Brussels. Once there, Charlotte falls secretly in love with her teacher Monsieur Heger, who is already married. Emily plays the piano at school, but has a hard time there and is teased by her classmates for being English and Protestant in a Catholic country. Meanwhile, in England, Anne finds employment as a governess, taking over the education of the daughter of a wealthy family.\nWhile his sisters are away, Branwell deals alone with the death of their aunt. Her death makes Emily and Charlotte come back home. Emily is relieved and helps Branwell to find solace, taking him to the Black Bull Inn, the tavern and hotel of the town. Charlotte, on the other hand, lovesick, returns as soon as possible to Brussels to be reunited with Monsieur Heger, but her love is unrequited. Thanks to Anne, the aimless dreamer Branwell finds a steady job as the teacher of Edmund, the young son of the Robinson family, Anne's wealthy employers. Mr Robinson is strict, and, with his air of superiority, humiliates both Anne and Branwell. Mrs Robinson, flirty and unsatisfied, starts an ill-fated affair with Branwell. When Anne finds out about their relationship, she quits her job and returns home. Both Branwell and Charlotte have to deal with their broken hearts. After the death of her husband, Mrs Robinson sends Branwell a letter ending their affair.\nBranwell's life takes a dark turn. He gives himself over to drinking and becomes addicted to opium. During a windy night, a fire starts in his bedroom and he has to be rescued from amongst the flames by his sisters. Sneaking into Emily's bedroom and searching amongst her things, Charlotte discovers Emily's poems. Deeply impressed, she finally is able to convince the reluctant Emily to have them published. Soon the three sisters have their poems, and later a novel each, published. Reviews of Emily's novel, Wuthering Heights, are particularly harsh. However, the novels of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell, the pen names adopted by the three sisters, are the talk of London literary circles.

One of his patients is Nola Carveth, a severely disturbed woman who is legally embattled with her husband Frank for custody of their five-year-old daughter Candice. When Frank discovers bruises and scratches on Candice following a visit with Nola, he informs Raglan of his intent to stop visitation rights. Wanting to protect his patient, Raglan begins to intensify the sessions with Nola to resolve the issue quickly. During the therapy sessions, he discovers that Nola was physically and verbally abused by her self-pitying alcoholic mother while neglected by her co-dependent alcoholic father, who refused to protect Nola out of shame and denial.\nMeanwhile, Frank, intending to invalidate Raglan's methods, questions Jan Hartog, a former Somafree Institute patient who is dying of psychoplasmic-induced lymphoma. Frank leaves Candice with her maternal grandmother, Juliana, and the two spend the evening viewing old photographs. Juliana tells Candice that Nola was frequently hospitalized as a child and often exhibited strange unexplained wheals on her skin that doctors were unable to diagnose. While in the kitchen, Juliana is attacked and bludgeoned to death by a small, dwarf-like child. Candice is traumatized, but physically unharmed.\nJuliana's ex-husband Barton returns for the funeral and attempts to contact Nola at the Somafree Institute, but Raglan turns him away. Frank invites Candice's teacher, Ruth Mayer, home for dinner to discuss his daughter's performance in school. Barton interrupts with a drunken phone call from Juliana's home, demanding that Frank and he go to the Somafree Institute to see Nola. Frank leaves to calm Barton, leaving Candice in Ruth's care. While he's away, Ruth answers a phone call from Nola, who, recognizing her voice and believing her to be having an affair with Frank, insults her and angrily warns Ruth to stay away from her family. Meanwhile, Frank arrives to find Barton murdered by the same deformed dwarf-child, who dies after attempting to kill Frank.\nThe police autopsy of the dwarf-child reveals a multitude of bizarre anatomical anomalies: the creature is asexual, supposedly colorblind, naturally toothless, and devoid of a navel, indicating no known means of natural human birth. After the murder story reaches the newspapers, Raglan reluctantly acknowledges that the deaths coincided with his sessions with Nola relating to their respective topics. He closes the Somafree Institute and sends his patients to municipal care with the exception of Nola. Frank is alerted about the closure of the institute by Hartog.\nMike Trellan, one of the patients forced to leave the institute, tells Frank that Nola is now Raglan's \"queen bee\" and in charge of some \"disturbed children\" in an attic. When Candice returns to school, two dwarf-children attack and kill Ruth in front of her class before absconding with Candice to the Somafree Institute, with Frank in pursuit. Upon arriving at the institute, Raglan tells Frank the truth about the dwarf-children: they are the accidental product of Nola's psychoplasmic sessions; her rage about her abuse was so strong that she parthenogenetically bore a brood of creatures resembling children who psychically respond and act on the targets of her rage, with Nola completely unaware of their actions. Realizing the brood are too dangerous to keep anymore, Raglan plans to venture into their quarters and rescue Candice, provided that Frank can keep Nola calm to avoid provoking the children.\nFrank attempts a feigned rapprochement long enough for Raglan to collect Candice, but when he witnesses Nola give birth to another child through a psychoplasmically-induced external womb, she notices his disgust when she licks the child clean. The brood awakens and kills Raglan. Nola then threatens to kill Candice rather than lose her. The brood goes after Candice who hides in a closet, but the brood begins to break through the door and tries to grab her. In desperation, Frank strangles Nola to death, and the brood dies without its mother's psychic connection. Frank carries a visibly traumatized Candice back to his car and the two depart.

They plant a homing beacon aboard Buck's shuttle to track a way through Earth's planet-wide defense shield. Buck is escorted through the defense shield by Colonel Wilma Deering of Earth's military forces. He lands in the futuristic city of New Chicago where he is interrogated and learns that Earth has been rebuilt in the centuries during his absence following a nuclear holocaust, and now much of the Earth outside of the city is a desolate, radioactive wasteland.

Shortly afterward, one of the heads of the Praetorian Guard, Naevius Sutorius Macro, tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at Capri, where the Emperor lives with his close friend Nerva, dim-witted relative Claudius, and Caligula's adopted son (Tiberius's grandson) Gemellus. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave but his sister and lover Drusilla persuades him to go.\nAt Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced venereal diseases, and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading sex shows that include deformed people and animals. Caligula observes with fascination and horror. Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus. Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve. Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness.\nAfter Tiberius' death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the Roman Senate. Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula sets up a mock trial in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro's wife Ennia banished from Rome. After Macro is executed in a gruesome public game, Caligula appoints Tiberius' former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator Chaerea as the new head of the Praetorian Guard.\nDrusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the cult they secretly practice. Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister. Instead, Caligula marries Caesonia, a priestess and notorious courtesan, after she bears him an heir. Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage. Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities. Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla.\nAfter discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula develops a severe fever. Drusilla nurses him back to health. Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, Julia Drusilla. During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he had had. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird.  Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever. Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula has a nervous breakdown and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla's body.\nNow in a deep depression, Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla. After a brief stay in a city gaol, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe.

The crew urgently pumps water back in and celebrates in relief at bringing the reactor back under control.Adams has surreptitiously filmed the incident, despite being asked not to film for security reasons. Wells' superior refuses her report of what happened. Adams steals the footage and shows it to experts who conclude that the plant came perilously close to meltdown \u2013 the China syndrome.\nDuring an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. He pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent wants nothing standing in the way of the restart.\nGodell finds that a series of radiographs supposedly verifying the welds on the leaking pump are identical \u2013 the contractor simply kept resubmitting the same picture. He brings the evidence to the plant manager, who brushes him off as paranoid, stating that new radiographs would cost $20 million. Godell confronts Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan who built the plant, as it was he who signed off on the radiographs. Godell threatens to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but Royce threatens him; later, a pair of men from Foster-Sullivan park outside his house.\nWells and Adams confront Godell at his home and he voices his concerns. Wells and Adams ask him to testify at the NRC hearings over Foster-Sullivan's plans to build another nuclear plant. Godell agrees to obtain, through Salas, the false radiographs to take to the hearings.\nSalas' car is run off the road and the radiographs are taken from him. Godell is chased by the men waiting outside his home. He takes refuge inside the plant, where he finds that the reactor is being brought up to full power. Grabbing a gun from a security guard, he forces everyone out, including his friend and co-worker Ted Spindler, and demands to be interviewed by Wells on live television. Plant management agrees to the interview in order to buy time as they try to regain control of the plant.\nMinutes into the broadcast, plant technicians deliberately cause a SCRAM so they can distract Godell and retake the control room. A SWAT team forces its way in, the television cable is cut, and Godell is shot. Before dying, he feels the unusual vibration again. The resulting SCRAM is brought under control only by the plant's automatic systems, and the plant suffers significant damage as the pump malfunctions.\nPlant officials try to paint Godell as emotionally disturbed, but are contradicted by a distraught Spindler on live television saying Godell was not crazy and would never have taken such drastic steps had there not been something wrong.

Flight 820, a Concorde test flight, is sabotaged which forces the plane to crash land in the ocean off coast of Martinique in the French Antillies of the Caribbean. The only survivor is a Jean Beneyton (Mimsy Farmer), a French hostess on the flight. Two fishermen find her, but then are soon killed off by a group of suited corporate agents who ride out in a speedboat, because they were witnesses to the crash.\nIn New York City, an American investigative reporter, Moses Brody (James Franciscus), receives a phone call from his ex-wife Nicole (Mag Fleming), who runs a local restaurant in Martinique, who tells him about an \"important story\". But upon arrival in Martinique, Brody learns that Nicole has died from an apparent \"heart attack\". Brody is devastated. Later that evening, while wandering the streets of the town, Brody is attacked by a gang of thugs, but is rescued by a mysterious local man named George, who owns a fishing trawler and tells him that Nicole was a friend of his and she was killed because she knew that the crashed Concorde flight landed on a reef nearby and the two of them decide to investigate.\nMeanwhile, a shady businessman named Milland (Joseph Cotten) and his business partner Danker (Edmund Purdom) learn about the Concorde crash and after consulting with their associate, Martinez, plot to cover up any evidence involved with the crash. It becomes apparent that Milland and Danker are behind the events.\nBrody and George are in a boat when they see Jean Beneyton jump off of the henchmen's boat and attempts to swim away before she is recaptured. Later, they arrive at the crash site and after donning scuba gear they find the wreck of the Concorde submerged under 100 feet of water in the Caribbean. While Brody goes inside the wreck, George gets his arm stuck in a jagged part of machinery and Brody has to amputate George's left arm to free him. Moses discovers explosive charges on the downed plane which were planted earlier by Milland's henchmen to destroy any evidence of foul play.\nUpon surfacing, George gets hit in the goggles by a bullet as several henchmen in a speedboat appear and attack. Brody is forced to go back down under the water with two scuba men in chase. Brody outwits them by hiding in an underwater cave in which he goes back to the surface and pulls out the henchman who remained behind in the speedboard and steals it.\nBrody then goes to the United States Consul of Martinique, and wants to start an investigation. He then takes them to the site and finds nothing. They call off the search for the missing Concorde. Brody then says that he saw Jean on a yacht. The Consul then says that if he knew it was Brody, he would have gotten him off the case as Brody was reporting a scandal concerning a Congressman.\nMeanwhile, Milland and his men watch a video as the submerged Concorde explodes. They then find out that Jean is alive and being held for a $1 million ransom. At the same time, another L.P.A. Concorde plane lands in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil which prepares itself for a flight from Venezuela to London.\nThat evening, Brody sneaks on board the henchmen's boat, where he overhears them saying that they want to get rid of Jean and also overhears them talking about their superiors taking down a second Concorde flight. Brody rescues her and they escape from the boat. After reaching the shore, Brody tries talking to Jean about the crash, but she is so shaken by the traumatic experience that she can't remember very much. In the morning, they hitch a ride on a banana truck driven by a local farmer. But soon Milland's henchmen, led by Forsythe (Venantino Venantini) find Brody and Jean again and give chase, but they are cut off by a construction vehicle.\nOn board the airborne second Concorde, L.P.A. Flight 128, a crew member turns on one of the inboard engines on the plane. Up in the cockpit, the pilot Captain Scott (Van Johnson) discovers something which same thing happened as with the first attack: loss of power. This is because a henchman puts vials of acid in the food of the flight which breaks upon being heated up and acid breaks through the microwave ovens and severs the electrical lines in the cabin.\nIn Martinique, Brody calls the Consul and has Jean begin to tell her story about it, but they are cut off as the henchmen are back. As the Consul calls up his associates in London with his ideas to what might be happening, the chase continues. The Concorde then loses radio contact with London control, and the cabin lights begin to flicker. Captain Scott soon regains contact with London, who suggests they run a circuit control. The London air traffic controller (Robert Kerman) also gets a call from Jean. The controller then reports they can't reach the Concorde. On board the plane, the navigator (Roberto Santi) then reports that pressure in the main cabin is dropping.\nOn the ground, Jean contacts the American Consul at a bank, but Forsythe and his henchmen arrive again, and she and Brody have to run. This time, the police are there and enter a shootout with the men in which all of the henchmen are killed.\nMeanwhile, London Air Traffic Control gets radio contact with the Concorde on a VHF frequence. Captain Scott on the Concorde then descends the aircraft to a lower altitude below 12,000 feet, but London now can't get Concorde on the VHF frequency, either. Brody and Jean reach the American Consul and she begins describing what happened.\nThe Concorde banks and the number one engine overheats. London control reports that the crash began with overheating of the oven. The crew discovers the number one engine is now on fire, and they quickly extinguish it. The Concorde continues its descent, as one passenger becomes hysterical.\nThe plane then levels out at 9,000 feet. London control can now see them on radar, and proceed to clear a runway. Concorde then makes a beautiful landing. Brody is relieved.\nThe next day, Milland contacts Brody by phone where he wants to offer him a shady contract after reading the headline \"Concorde Passengers Saved by Journalist\". Jean thinks that he'll get a big welcome in New York. Brody jokingly states that he doesn't have to go, and they laugh. He says he has to pay a visit \"to a certain bigshot\". Jean then gets on an Air France flight to return to Paris, but before she leaves he says he'll give her a call.\nBrody then calls his friend Alfie and says that he wants to \"push a certain Humpty Dumpty off his wall\". He says he wants to know the heads of the top corporations in New York City, heavily involved in aircraft sales to South American countries, specifically those most hurt by competition from Concorde.

A man named Carl Parker shows up to Maggie with a claim about documentation of illegal arms deals, but is shot by an assailant who chases Maggie throughout the house before a passerby triggers a fire alarm, scaring the assailant away.\nMaggie is told by Harrison someone is framing him. He sends Maggie off in a limo, then plots to destroy the Concorde with Maggie on it by reprogramming an attack drone test with the Concorde as the new target.\nCapt. Joe Patroni and Capt. Paul Metrand board the Concorde, where they are joined by Peter O'Neill, the 2nd officer and flight engineer.\nHarrison surprises Maggie at the airline check-in desk to see her off. He asks whether the documents have shown up, but they have not. As he is walking away, Parker's wife delivers the documents to Maggie as she steps into the mobile lounge. She looks them over and realizes that Harrison has lied to her.\nThe Concorde takes off for Paris. Unbeknownst to the flight crew, an off-course surface-to-air missile is headed straight for them. At his company headquarters, Harrison tells his controllers to alert the government. The USAF scrambles F-15 fighter jets to intercept the missile as it locks onto the Concorde. After several evasive maneuvers by the passenger plane, an F-15 shoots down the missile.\nAs the Concorde is approaching the European coastline, an F-4 Phantom II sent by Harrison engages the Concorde as French Air Force Mirage F1s scramble to help. The Concorde evades the F-4's missiles, but the explosion of one of them damages the plane's hydraulics. The Mirages shoot down the F-4 before the Concorde reaches the French coastline to continue towards Paris.  Due to hydraulic system damage, the plane lands at Le Bourget Airport instead of Charles de Gaulle.  The Concorde barely stops at the last safety net. Metrand and Isabelle invite Patroni to dinner.\nHarrison promises Maggie to go public with the documents but attempts to bribe her into \"polishing\" his statement. After being paid by Harrison, a mechanic, Froelich, places a device in the Concorde's cargo door control unit, timed to open during flight.\nAs the passengers board, Froelich is in line at the security checkpoint when some of his money falls out of his trouser leg. The X-ray technician attempts to return it, but Froelich pretends not to hear and runs off. On the runway, where the Concorde is taking off, the aircraft's exhaust renders Froelich unconscious and scatters the money he received from Harrison.\nEn route to Moscow, the automatic device opens the cargo door. Metrand sees the carpet tear down the middle of the aisle, signifying the fuselage is under tremendous stress and the aircraft is about to break apart. The cargo door is ripped off, damaging the aircraft and ripping a segment of the floor as it spirals towards the ground. The airline founder's seat lodges in the hole, acting as a plug. The pilots attempt to fly to Innsbruck, Austria, for an emergency landing, but they are losing too much fuel and do not have enough to make it there. Metrand realizes they are flying towards a ski area he knows along the Alps in Patscherkofel; they could make a belly landing on a mountain-side.\nThe aircraft approaches the landing site while the ski patrol marks a runway, landing successfully. While passengers are being rescued, Maggie reports on the accident to a news reporter and mentions a major story she is about to release.

The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward, whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, especially Lucy. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker, Lucy's fianc\u00e9.\nLater that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone.\nAt a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls in Mina's father, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, who suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. He begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and Van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin, leading them to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina and it is up to a distraught Van Helsing to destroy what remains of his daughter.\nLucy has in the meantime been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home. She reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride.

They manage to locate his coffin within the grounds of Carfax Abbey, but the vampire is waiting for them. Despite it being daylight, Dracula is still a very powerful adversary. Dracula escapes their attempts to kill him, bursts into the asylum to free the captive Lucy and also scolds his slave, Milo Renfield, for warning the others about him. Renfield apologizes and pleads for his life, but Dracula kills him by breaking his neck. Dracula makes preparations to return to Transylvania with Lucy.\nHarker and Van Helsing board the ship carrying Dracula and Lucy as cargo bound for Romania.

Van Helsing uses his remaining strength to throw a hook attached to a rope, tied to the ship's rigging, into Dracula's back.

One evening, Robert Acton who has been away a few days (and is beginning to believe he is in love with Eugenia even though for him love is an overrated feeling) goes late to visit her. Clifford was with Eugenia at the time and she makes him hide in a back room. When Clifford comes unexpectedly out of his hiding place, there is a very awkward moment. Clifford leaves and Eugenia lies about why the young man was at her home. Later, in talking with Clifford, Mr. Acton realises she had not told the truth, and Eugenia's lies begin to weigh upon his thoughts, and he loses interest as Lizzie outflanks the baroness in her attempt to win her brother.\nMeanwhile, Felix tells his sister he wants to marry Gertrude; Eugenia lies to him claiming Robert Acton asked to marry her, but she is not sure she wants to. Felix makes a visit to his uncle and asks for Gertrude's hand. Mr. Wentworth is bewildered at first, but his other daughter, Charlotte, speaks in favour of the match, then Gertrude comes in and declares she will marry Felix, and finally Mr. Brand comes in to say he would like to marry the young couple. Understanding that her goal of finding a wealthy man in the United States has failed, Eugenia decides to go back to Germany. She makes a farewell visit to Mrs. Acton, sees Robert as she is leaving and lies to him claiming to have sent the annulation papers to Germany. Mr. Acton expresses regret that she has decided to leave and offers his carriage to Eugenia for her use at her departure. Felix will stay in America and will marry Gertrude. Clifford would be paired with Lizzie Acton. Mr. Brand and Charlotte will also later marry, far more suited to one another than Gertrude was to Mr. Brand. The final scene shows all of the paired lovers - Felix and Gertrude, Mr. Brand and Charlotte, Lizzy and Clifford - walking together to various destinations, while Eugenia, having availed herself of Acton's offer of his carriage to take her to the boat, travels alone one way, and Acton, on horseback, rides alone the other way.", "tmdb_plot": "A New England household is upset by the arrival of two cousins from Europe.", "tmdb_id": "42175", "wiki_id": "6031602"}, {"title": "Every Child", "genres": ["Comedy", "Animation"], "wiki_plot": "This animated short tells the story of a child rejected from every home, then found by two tramps who give her love and tenderness.", "tmdb_plot": "This animated short follows an unwanted baby who is passed from house to house.

Eight days later, Germany invades Poland, and the six are forced to go their separate ways.\nIn the spring of 1940, Germany conquers France.

Although the process of mechanization is expensive, there are rumors that anyone who makes it to the last stop of the Galaxy Express 999, an advanced intergalactic transit system resembling a passenger train pulled by a JNR Class C62 steam locomotive, can get a machine body for free. To get there is the goal of twelve-year-old street urchin Tetsuro Hoshino, living in the slums of Megalopolis City, where the 999 makes its stop on Earth for one day of each year.\nTetsuro attempts to swipe a pass for the train with the help of his friends, only to be apprehended by mechanical policemen and losing a scarab-like locket in the altercation. Before fleeing the scene, he meets a mysterious woman who bears a striking resemblance to his late mother, who collects his locket. With the police in hot pursuit, Tetsuro sees the woman again later on a balcony and faints trying to reach her. She saves him from the police and uses a device to look into his dreams, where she watches a young Tetsuro lose his mother to the villainous Count Mecha, who hunts humans for trophies. Tetsuro awakens to the sound of the woman seemingly talking to someone else in the shower, only to find her alone. He shortly thereafter learns the woman's name is Maetel and explains to her he wants a mechanical body so he can kill Count Mecha in revenge. Returning his locket, revealing it to house a photograph of his mother, Maetel offers him a ticket for the 999 under the condition that they travel together, to which Tetsuro agrees. They narrowly avoid the police once more and go to Megalopolis Station, where the train departs Earth for its journey to the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe train's Conductor announces the first stop of the journey to be Saturn's moon Titan, which has been terraformed to have a hospitable atmosphere, with a layover of sixteen Earth days (roughly one day on Titan). Upon arriving, however, Tetsuro witnesses a man get murdered in broad daylight and Maetel gets kidnapped by bandits, before he himself gets knocked out. Awakening in the house of an elderly woman who saved him, Tetsuro learns that Titan is governed under \"paradise law\", essentially an anarchy where everyone can do as they please, and that Maetel was kidnapped by the Grape Valley Bandits. Though initially telling him not to pursue her, the old woman helps Tetsuro rescue Maetel by providing him with a hat and poncho to shield him from Titan's intense sunlight as well as a gun for self-defense, all of which belonged to her son, Tochiro \u014cyama. With this, Tetsuro sets out to find Maetel and meets Antares, the leader of the Grape Valley Bandits, after saving a young girl in his care from a machine man. Antares tells Tetsuro that the gun he carries, the Warrior's Weapon, is highly effective against mechanized people and upon hearing Tetsuro is traveling on the 999 to get a machine body and kill Count Mecha, takes him in and checks him, as well as the captive Maetel, to make sure they are not mechanized. After discerning they are not, Antares shows Tetsuro and Maetel unexploded bullets still inside of him, and then shows them the many children he's caring for, all orphaned by Count Mecha. They speculate on where Count Mecha's hideout, the Time Castle, will appear next, and Antares tells Tetsuro the one person who may know is the space pirate Emeraldas, and tells Tetsuro to show no mercy when meeting Count Mecha. He lets them go free, and Tetsuro thanks the old woman who helped him before he and Maetel return to the train. She tells him to keep her son's clothes and gun, and Tetsuro promises to tell Tochiro that she is still waiting for him if he should happen to encounter him while traveling.\nThe next stop on their journey is Pluto, a planet where the bodies of people who died or gave up their humanity for machine bodies are kept locked in solid ice. From here, Tetsuro witnesses Maetel looking at someone under the ice, and meets a faceless machine woman named Shadow, the caretaker of the icy graves. She shows Tetsuro her original body, kept in an elegant glass casket, and reveals that her machine body is faceless because she knew no other face could be as beautiful. Then Shadow nearly freezes Tetsuro to death, clinging to him for his warmth, before Maetel intervenes and saves him, rebuking the sorrowful Shadow for being unable to decide between life as a machine woman and life as a human woman. They depart Pluto, and back on the train, make the acquaintance of a young waitress named Claire, who has a machine body made of crystal glass. Tetsuro, enamored by her beauty, strikes up a friendship with Claire, and she explains she obtained her glass body at the behest of her mother, but hopes to buy back her old body from Pluto. Shortly after this, the train is passed by the Queen Emeraldas, the spaceship of Emeraldas. Tetsuro, out of desperation, fires his gun at the ship to get Emeraldas's attention, causing her to board the ship and hold Tetsuro at gunpoint. Emeraldas stops short of killing Tetsuro after seeing Tochiro's gun in his possession, and relents completely when Maetel appears with Tochiro's hat. Tetsuro learns that Maetel and Emeraldas know each other, and that Emeraldas and Tochiro are lovers. The space pirate reluctantly informs Tetsuro that the Time Castle will appear next near Trader's Fork, a waystation on the arid planet Heavy Melder, the train's next stop. Claire pleads to the Conductor to pass Heavy Melder, but he refuses, knowing he would be fired for negligence if he did, while also recognizing Claire's concern for Tetsuro's well-being, much to her embarrassment.\nAt Trader's Fork, which resembles an Old West frontier town, Tetsuro finds his way to a saloon where a beautiful machine woman named Ryuzu performs a song before a tearful crowd. Tetsuro, having made a friend in the sympathetic bartender after being taunted by some of the other patrons for ordering milk, asks if the old man might know where the Time Castle will appear, sending the entire saloon into silence. The bartender cautiously takes Tetsuro into a storeroom and, after trying to warn him of the danger, tells him to venture out a ship near Mt. Gun Frontier where an eccentric who knows the answer lives. Tetsuro travels there on a ramshackle motorized bicycle and discovers a downed ship at the base of the mountain, where he encounters Tochiro living alone inside of it, with his only company being the bird Tori-san. Seeing Tetsuro with his clothes and gun and learning he knows his mother, Tochiro invites Tetsuro inside, telling the young boy that he will soon succumb to an illness he contracted while trying to chase Count Mecha across the galaxy himself. Before he can die, however, Tochiro informs Tetsuro that the Time Castle will next appear on the other side of Mt. Gun Frontier and warns him to shoot Count Mecha in his weak point; his head. Following this, he enlists Tetsuro in helping activate a machine mere moments before his death, which vaporizes his body and transfers his consciousness into the supercomputer of the Arcadia, the ship of his best friend and Tetsuro's hero, Captain Harlock. Tetsuro then erects a memorial to Tochiro and tries to make his way back to Trader's Fork, but gets assaulted by thugs from the saloon working for Count Mecha, who steal his gun and leave him for dead.\nReturning to Trader's Fork, the badly beaten Tetsuro attempts to reclaim his gun, but gets pinned to the saloon floor by the largest of the thugs. However, before they can harm him further, Harlock enters the saloon and saves Tetsuro by overpowering the thug and forcing him to drink milk, which kills him by rusting him from the inside. Harlock tells Tetsuro that he saved him in return for what he did for Tochiro, and they meet up with Maetel and Emeraldas, the latter of whom leaves the scene in silence after Harlock informs her that Tochiro has died. Tetsuro then makes his way over Mt. Gun Frontier to the Time Castle, a giant technologically-advanced floating castle that can travel through space and time. He discovers, much to his horror, the taxidermied remains of his mother mounted on a fireplace inside, before encountering Count Mecha, who was alerted to Tetsuro's arrival by Ryuzu, his lover. The confrontation is briefly interrupted by a cloaked figure revealing himself to be Antares, who came to help Tetsuro fight Count Mecha in the name of his orphaned wards. The bandit buys Tetsuro enough time against Count Mecha's men for him to chase the mechanical count to the Time Castle's central computer chamber, where Tetsuro shoots off one of Count Mecha's arms before the latter calls down a glass capsule to try and safely move the Time Castle forward through time and escape. However, as Ryuzu suddenly hesitates to advance time, Antares enters to help Tetsuro, sacrificing his life when the bullets inside of him go off after being shot by Count Mecha's gun, killing him and shattering the capsule. Before he dies, however, the bandit warns Tetsuro not to trust Maetel. Tetsuro shoots Count Mecha in the head just as he attempts to advance time, killing him. Ryuzu reveals that Tetsuro reminded her of what it was like to be human, and this caused her to betray her Count Mecha, who only became a monster after being mechanized. Tetsuro then flees the Time Castle as it crumbles into dust and Ryuzu dies, her body rusting away.\nOutside, Tetsuro meets with Harlock and Maetel, who question what he will do now that his mother was avenged. No longer wanting a mechanized body and seeing what rejection of one's own humanity can do to others, Tetsuro explains that his revenge will not be complete until he stops mechanization once and for all, and thereafter thanks Maetel for helping him onto the 999. The two barely make it back to the station before the train departs, and as they approach the last stop, Tetsuro asks Maetel if he can come live with her when they return to Earth. Maetel sadly reflects to herself that Tetsuro's feelings will change when he realizes who she really is. At last, the train arrives at the final station on the mechanization homeworld in Andromeda, also known as Planet Maetel. Tetsuro, horrified upon hearing the planet's name, learns why Maetel brought him to the planet; the free mechanical body offered there is that of a mechanized component of the planet itself, and Tetsuro was selected to become one, in a process Maetel, the planet's princess, has done many times over the years with countless other humans. Betrayed, Tetsuro angrily slaps Maetel, but gets incapacitated by guards who take him below the planet to be mechanized in the presence of Maetel's mother and ruler of Andromeda, Queen Promethium. However, before this can happen, Maetel, desperate to save her young companion, enters the room and reveals that she intends to destroy the planet with her pendant, which contains the consciousness of her father and Promethium's husband Dr. Pan (Dr. Ban in the English dub), a traitor who opposed the mechanized empire and also the mysterious voice Tetsuro heard back on Earth. Dr. Pan explains that the pendant contains enough energy to disrupt the planet's mechanized counterparts, all of whom were transformed willingly in the hopes of someday destroying Promethium's empire.\nThough Maetel initially hesitates due to her connection to the planet, Tetsuro takes the pendant and launches it to the core of Andromeda, setting off its self-destruction. At this same time, outside, the Arcadia and Queen Emeraldas have arrived and fight back against the forces of Andromeda, as both Harlock and Emeraldas intend to ensure Tetsuro's survival. Maetel and Tetsuro barely escape with their lives aboard the 999, as Maetel explains her body is an organic copy of his mother's, and that she travels through time through cloning. Suddenly, the enraged Promethium appears and tries to strangle the life out of Tetsuro, but is interrupted by Claire, who grabs hold of the queen and self-destructs in an act of sacrifice to save Tetsuro, seemingly killing Promethium. The 999 returns to Earth, where Maetel tells Tetsuro that she will return to Pluto to be reunited with her original body and tells him that when next they meet, he may not recognize her, thereafter kissing him.

His goal is to put his rival out of business.\nIt seems like fate might be working in the villain's favor. Uncle Joe has been struck by a heart attack and can no longer run the business. When Uncle Joe's doctor tells him he must sell the gasoline station that he has operated for more than 20 years, June decides to take it over and get her friends to work for her as gas-pump attendants.

Without a product to sell, the station is out of business, until June finds a way to get more fuel to sell; they visit their competitor, asking to have the gas tank of Michael's car filled. As the vehicle is refueled, one of the boys, hidden beneath the car, siphons the gasoline into a storage tank, so that the car seems to hold much more fuel than it needs. By making two visits, using the same vehicle, the friends are able to obtain more regular and high-octane gasoline to sell at their own station.

The alien demonstrates its shapeshifting ability by transforming into the same gendarme it is talking to. The gendarme runs and tells Cruchot, who doesn't believe him. In the midst of the racket, the chief comes and sends the gendarme away. The chief reveals that he is actually an alien disguised as the chief, and when Cruchot doesn't believe him the alien becomes agitated and uses laser vision to cause damage to Cruchot's room. He relents when a watch on his hand flashes red and drinks something out of a flask. The alien begins coughing and upon hitting it on the back, Cruchot discovers it makes a metallic sound. Later on when the real chief arrives, Cruchot stabs him with a screwdriver thinking that it is the alien. The chief orders Cruchot out, since the supervisor will come in tomorrow to check up on the station. During the check up, Cruchot notices the same watch on the supervisor as on the alien he saw last night and attempts to attack him.

He encounters another alien on the beach during the day, which manages to run away to avoid being exposed. This alien labels Cruchot a threat and orders him eliminated.

They encounter the flying saucer within the woods, which Cruchot's wife insists he enters. Cruchot realizes the woman next to him is actually an alien in disguise and manages to flee. Some of the gendarmes who were searching for him happen to witness this encounter and now believe Cruchot and agree to help him find the aliens. The next day at a restaurant, they encounter 2 aliens who they identify by them drinking machine oil. They attempt to ambush the aliens, and during the scuffle one of aliens is doused in water from an aquarium. The other flees but not before telling the gendarmes to stop their struggle.

He observes the hippies panhandle from a trio of horseback riders including Short Hills, New Jersey debutante Sheila Franklin (\"Sodomy\") and later catches and mounts a runaway horse, which the hippies have rented, exhibiting his riding skills to Sheila (\"Donna\") before then returning the horse to Berger, who offers to show him around.\nThat evening, Claude gets stoned on marijuana with Berger and the tribe. He is then introduced to various race and class issues of the 1960s (\"Hashish\", \"Colored Spade\", \"Manchester\", \"I'm Black/Ain't Got No\"). The next morning, Berger finds a newspaper clipping which gives Sheila's address in Short Hills, New Jersey. The tribe members\u2014LaFayette \"Hud\" Johnson, Jeannie Ryan (who is pregnant), and \"Woof Dacshund\"\u2014crash a private dinner party to introduce Claude to Sheila, who secretly enjoys her rigid environment being disrupted (\"I Got Life\").

His mother gives him enough cash to bail out his friends. They subsequently attend a peace rally in Central Park, where Claude drops acid for the first time (\"Initials\", \"Electric Blues/Old Fashioned Melody\", \"Be In\"). Just as Jeannie proposes marriage to Claude, in order to keep him out of the Army, Sheila shows up to apologize. Claude's \"trip\" reflects his inner conflict over which of three worlds he fits in with: his own native Oklahoman farm culture, Sheila's upper-class society, or the hippies' free-wheeling environment.\nAfter his acid trip, Claude falls out with Berger and the tribe members, ostensibly due to a practical joke they pull on Sheila (taking her clothes while she's skinny-dipping, which forces her to hail a taxi in just her panties), but also due to their philosophical differences over the war in Vietnam\u2014and over personal versus communal responsibility. After wandering the city (\"Where Do I Go?\"), Claude finally reports to the draft board (\u201cBlack Boys/White Boys\u201d), completes his enlistment, and is shipped off to Nevada for basic training.\nIt's now Winter in New York when Claude writes to Sheila from Nevada (\"Walking In Space\"), who subsequently shares the news with the others.

Sometime later, Sheila chats up army sergeant Fenton at a local bar, using sex to lure him to an isolated desert road and acquire his uniform.

The company regime, represented by \u00e9minence grise Dr. Percival (Robert Morley) and agency higher-up Sir John Hargreaves (Richard Vernon), advise newly appointed security chief Daintry (Richard Attenborough) that analysis of intel from a double-agent they have planted in Moscow indicates there is a leak in Castle's department.

They quickly decide the most likely candidate for the traitor is Arthur Davis (Derek Jacobi), Castle's red brick\u2013educated playboy office partner.\nPercival plants a seemingly tantalizing intelligence tidbit with Davis (which he and Hargreaves assume will be passed on only to the Soviets) as a means of smoking him out. Instead, unraveled by the intensive security scrutiny he's being subjected to, and utterly clueless why, Davis idly shares it with Castle. When the telltale bait shows up in Moscow Percival concludes with myopic certainty Davis was its source.

It was he, it is revealed, who had tormented Castle after Castle met and fell in love with Sarah. Operating under his cover as a writer Castle had been tasked by MI6 with observing the local Communist movement. He befriended its white leader, Matthew Connolly (Tony Vogel), who introduced him to the beautiful, sophisticated Bantu, Sarah. The couple fell for one-another and soon became intimate. Caught in a South African surveillance sting intended to compromise him into doing Muller's bidding, Castle fled the country to avoid arrest and exposure, then awaited Sarah - pregnant by a previous, then-deceased boyfriend - being smuggled to him by Connolly.\nEver since Castle has been repaying the favor by passing information on to the Soviets via a contact in London, and flinches when Muller casually drops that Connolly had recently \"accidentally\" died in police custody. Shortly after he learns in an agency briefing given by Muller of a plan for the South Africans to use U.S.-supplied tactical nuclear weapons to eradicate the nation's Communist insurgents en masse. Although he is not a Communist, Castle feels compelled as a humanitarian to pass a warning on to Moscow, no matter the risk of shining MI6's counterintelligence security spotlight on himself.\nHe does. Seeking to stay one step ahead of Percival and Daintry, he surrenders himself into the hands of underground Communist operatives in Britain, who successfully smuggle him to safety in the Soviet Union.

They are also ordered to kill a woman named Barbara Gibson, a scientist who once worked with Kraspin but who realized the horrendous potential of the element and had Kraspin committed to a mental facility. Kraspin had escaped the facility two years earlier and seeks revenge against her. Barbara leaves before the slaughter when she is summoned home by her mysterious pupil, a boy named Tom Tom who exhibits powers of mental suggestion.

Instead, Golob says he will rescue Barbara himself. Nick joins him and he and Golob take a ship to Noxon. Along the way they discover Tom Tom stowing away and wanting to help. Nearing the planet, their ship is attacked by Graal's fighters and crash lands. Near the crash site, they encounter Kip who Golob excitedly remembers as his old companion. Kip then helps them sneak into Graal's base.

Barbara is saved last minute when Nick and Golob burst in and free her from the machine. Kraspin and Agatha then attempt to flee to Graal's ship.\nWith Barbara's help and assistance from the mysterious travelers, the heroes launch an attack on the missile launch bay.

He coldly suggests that Ida earn the money, which she is not sure how to do. But then her mother calls to Ida about the junk she left all over the attic, when she was searching for the camera. She says that she will throw it all away unless Ida cleans it up, which gives Ida another brainstorm: a garage sale.\nThe sale goes well, to the point where Ida is even able to talk Fred into paying 75 cents for an old soldier's helmet that he finds (even though it's already theirs). Irritated, he calls into question whether Ida even knows how to use a camera, prompting Ida to admit that she has to learn. So when Ida successfully pays for the camera with her funds from the sale, she makes sure to ask the salesman how to use it.\nFilming starts, with Ida, Cookie, and even Fred all decked out: Ida has borrowed a fancy-looking beret from her mother (\"All directors wear them! I saw it in a book!\"), Cookie in a long dress (she is practicing a dance she will do), and Fred refusing to take off his soldier's hat. Ida and Cookie persuade Fred to join the filming, a story about the importance of picking up garbage and keeping things clean. Since it's garbage pick-up day in Ida's neighborhood, Fred will make a show of picking up trash bags and taking them to the curb, while Cookie will dance about and plant little flowers, to \"make the yard look nice.\" A simple enough plan, but it rapidly goes wrong: just as the garbage men arrive on the street,  Fred picks up one of Cookie's dolls by accident, and they get into a tug-of-war over it, on camera. Cookie falls down as the doll is thrown into the garbage truck and is crushed in its compactor and the camera catches that, too. Nonetheless, Ida is sure that the film turned out great, consoling Cookie over the loss of the doll as Fred goes back inside, insisting that no one will want to watch the film.\nTwo weeks later, Ida gets a letter from the film board (addressed to \"Ida T. Lucas\"), telling her that her powerful film about \"the effect of war on children\" has been selected as a finalist, and that she and her family should come to the awards ceremony on the 2nd of September. Ida is thrilled, despite the misunderstanding, while Cookie is bothered by the idea of accepting an award for the film under what seem to be false pretenses, while Ida insists that it's not lying... especially if no one tells.\nIda is talking about the award with her mother, an artist who is making a drawing. Ida tries to conceal the misunderstanding by saying she has lost the letter, but is forced to reveal that she still has it: already, her cover story is falling apart. Her mother reads the letter and expresses surprise (and perhaps, a note of skepticism) that Ida would take on a profound topic like war in her amateur film.\nFinally, awards night arrives, but Ida tries to chicken out, claiming that she's sick. (Comically, she claims to have an ulcer, and that she's afraid it's contagious.) Clearly guilt-stricken over her lie of omission, Ida asks her mother a veiled question: if someone misunderstood one of her mother's pictures, but still liked it, is it right to correct them? Her mother insists that it's the right thing to do, especially since she'd be the only person who could reveal the truth. She also reassures Ida that she'll always be proud of her, even if she doesn't win. Suddenly, Ida's \"ulcer\" miraculously clears up, and she's eager to go to the awards.\nAt the ceremony, the award is presented by the kindly Mr. Druffle, who announces that Ida's work, on \"how devastating war is to children,\" is the winner. The film is then shown, with Ida and the kids then realizing how, with Fred and Cookie fighting, and him wearing the helmet, the film could be misinterpreted as a powerful anti-war statement. So when Ida reluctantly takes the podium, she tries to decline the award in a fit of conscience, explaining to Mr. Druffle how the mistake came about. Clearly taken aback, by the confession, Mr. Druffle then decides that since she did win the award on merit, and since honesty should be rewarded, that the Board will allow Ida to keep the award anyway. He then encourages a round of applause for Ida's film, on \"how to wage war... on garbage.\"", "tmdb_plot": "The National Film Board of Canada is sponsoring a movie festival.

He asks Shelly for help with a five-minute errand: breaking into Vince's office safe. Shelly reluctantly agrees. After retrieving a mysterious black bag from Vince's cramped office in an old Herald Square office building, two armed hit men surprise Sheldon. After a chase and shootout, Vince explains to the frightened Shelly he has worked for the CIA since the Eisenhower administration and robbed the United States Mint of engraving plates to crack a worldwide inflation plot hatched in Central America.

Various individuals want the jade from Mao Kai Yuan for their own purposes (to get rich or to return it to its owner), particularly the con-woman Peng Shuang Shuang (Shirley Yu) and her hired help, who wants to get it played in a gamble game at Mo Jun Feng's (Lo Mang) small hotel, along with Xiao Qiang (Lin Chen-Chi) and her hired help Xiao Tang (Chiang Sheng), as well as the handless off and on villain Yan Zi Fei (Lu Feng); previously Xiao Qiang and Xiao Tang offered a duel to Yan Zi Fei to defeat his new sword technique, and if he lost he would lose his hand. The sword was made by the blacksmith Qiu Zi Yu (Kuo Chui), who formerly made weapons for kung fu experts with his only payment being for every expert to teach him his kung fu style, and therefore Qiu Zi Yu himself is an expert at various forms of kung fu. However, he retired from making weapons after Yan Zi Fei used his new sword to try to kill Qiu Zi Yu.\nYan Zi Fei indeed lost his hand and lived as a reformed vagabond until hearing about the jade, so he approached Qiu Zi Yu to apologize and ask for a new weapon to replace his hand but Qiu Zi Yu refuses. Peng Shuang Shuang and Mo Jun Feng approach Mao Kai Yuan about the jade and offer him a price (basically give it up or die), however Yun Xiang hears this and challenges Mo Jun Feng who is also a knife expert to a duel which ends up a draw when Mao Kai Yuan intervenes. Xiao Tang approaches Peng Shuang Shuang in private and she seduces and then murders him. A police captain and his daughter Xiao Hong (Kara Hui) arrive and suggest that Peng Shuang Shuang can be absolved of the murder and claim it was self defense if she helps the police officer sneak Xiao Hong into the gambling event.

At this Bruce Tong approaches Qiu Zi Yu and asks why he \"does\" have weapons (his tools to make things: such as a hammer, a shovel, etc.) and kills a bunch of thugs who also came looking for Qiu Zi Yu to make weapons. Lastly another individual, the nobility member Master Nan (Li Yi-Min) arrives and explains he is the owner of the escort party who lost the jade and asks for Qiu Zi Yu\u2019s help in getting it back. Qiu Zi Yu offers to help but gets assistance from two individuals, he makes an iron hand with darts for Yan Zi Fei if he offers to help Zi Yu and goes straight, he also makes replacement knives for Mo Jun Feng if he also helps and offers to go straight in which both of them agree. At this point everyone flocks to Mao Kai Yuan\u2019s place to get the jade, Peng Shuang Shuang, Mo Jun Feng, Qiu Zi Yu, Yan Zi Fei, and Xiao Qiang, with Xiao Hong and Yun Xiang already on the scene and the police captain waiting at the hotel.\nEveryone arrives and the 4 original thieves end up dead thanks to Wag Lung Wei's fixed gambling device.

Yan Zi Fei grabs the jade and returns to his usual self (villain) and threatens to kill everyone with his new iron hand if he doesn\u2019t get the jade. Mo Jun Feng attempts to apprehend him but Yan Zi Fei catches his knives with his iron hand and kills Xiao Qiang. Yan Zi Fei tries to fire another dart which backfires and kills him as Qiu Zi Yu rigged his iron hand to need to be \"reset\" after the fourth dart is fired or it will backfire. Mo Jun Feng and Yun Xiang then get into another knife contest to settle the previous duel which was a draw, this contest ends up being another draw until Yun Xiang throws a magnetic knife which catches Mo Jun Feng knives and kills him.

As the guards are being served tea and stew, Wahroonga causes the cockatoo to fly toward the line of soldiers and cause them to scatter in all directions, then commands the dingo to snap and snarl at the soldiers' horses causing them to bolt toward the bush. As the soldiers set off in pursuit, Jack and Toby head for the storehouse. They find no tools there, only barrels of rum and oil. Jack gets Toby to open the oil barrels while he takes the rum.\nThe soldiers return to the settlement and drink the tea, getting drunk on the rum Jack had put into it. Jack sends Toby to collect Silly Billy while he heads for the guardhouse to get the keys to Big George's cell. Toby and Billy take the key and unlock the punishment cell. Billy yells to awaken George, but is heard by Bully. Jack hurls the oil to the ground, causing the pursuing soldiers to slip and fall to the ground. Despite his drunken state, Bully aims a rifle at Jack. A boomerang thrown by Wahroonga hits Bully on the back of his neck, sending his gunshot through a window of the Governor's house (causing a frightened Polly to drop the oil lamp she is carrying) before he falls unconscious to the ground. But the flame of the dropped lamp ignites on the now-spreading oil, causing a fire which engulfs the house so fast that Polly and Augusta are trapped inside.\nAs the four convicts begin their escape, Wahroonga sees the flames coming out of the house and signals to them. Big George leads a mad dash toward the building. Jack, Toby, George and Billy are able to smash the door down and guide Polly and Augusta out safely. A couple of hours later, the four convicts explain their actions to Colonel Lightfoot. Toby tries to introduce Wahroonga, only to discover that he has disappeared into the shadows of the bush.

The two meet in the Ch\u00e2teau de Vaux-le-Vicomte, where Lauren's mother is becoming romantically interested in George, the sleazy director of a movie being filmed there, and where Daniel is taking a school trip, and they fall in love. Lauren and Daniel soon meet Julius Santorin (Laurence Olivier), a quirky but kind elderly man, literally by accident. Daniel is unimpressed by him, but he fascinates Lauren with stories of his life, telling of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever. At Lauren's birthday party, Daniel punches George for making a crude suggestion about Lauren, and the two are forbidden to date by Lauren's mother.\nTold her family will be returning to America soon, Lauren hatches a plan to travel to Venice with Daniel. Though they have money from a horse race (in which Julius actually loses the money betting on their chosen horse, but steals the money to take the trip by picking the pockets of the racegoers), they cannot cross the border without an adult.  With Julius's help, the pair travel by train but miss their connection to Verona after Julius gets into a conversation during the stop at the Italian border. In the meantime, Lauren's family spark an international investigation, believing she has been abducted.\nThey hitch a ride with a couple of American tourists, Bob and Janet Duryea (Andrew Duncan and Claudette Sutherland), who are headed to Venice. In Verona, the travelers go out to dinner together, where Bob discovers that his wallet has been stolen. Even though their winnings from the horse race were left on the train in Julius's vest, Julius offers to pay the bill with cash, perplexing Lauren and irritating Daniel, who suspects he stole it. The following morning at breakfast, the Duryeas notice Lauren's picture in an Italian newspaper, revealing her as a missing child. Julius has also seen the paper and intercepts Lauren and Daniel on their way back to the hotel, angry that Lauren lied to him about their true reason for going to Venice and that everyone will think he's a kidnapper.\nBecause they cannot go back to the hotel, they join a local bicycle race to escape Verona. Julius soon falls behind and Lauren persuades Daniel to go back for him. They find him collapsed from exhaustion. Daniel worms his background out of Julius, who also confesses that he both picked Bob's pocket and stole the money for their train tickets, disappointing Lauren. Lauren then reveals that she will be moving back to the United States permanently in two weeks. She wanted to take a gondola to the Bridge of Sighs and kiss Daniel so they could love each other forever. She berates Julius by dismissing all his stories as lies. Julius admits he lied about some things but insists the legend can be true. Daniel decides he still wants to go to Venice with Lauren, and Julius joins them.\nIn Venice, they spend the night in St Mark's Basilica, until a chance meeting with the Duryeas sets them on the run again hours before sunset. Julius hides them in a movie theater and gives them his remaining cash, promising to return a half-hour before sunset. As soon as they are inside, however, Julius turns himself in to police searching for them; despite being slapped around by an inspector, he refuses to reveal Lauren and Daniel's whereabouts. The two children fall asleep during the film and wake with just a few minutes remaining. Lauren and Daniel run to find a gondola, but most are already taken. They finally find an available gondolier; he takes them within sight of the bridge, but refuses to go further just as sunset arrives because they didn't pay him the full amount. Daniel pushes him into the canal and, as the bells of the Campanile begin chiming, the two pull the gondola by hand along the pilings toward the bridge, enabling the gondola to glide underneath. While the bells are still pealing, Lauren and Daniel kiss and embrace. In the police station, Julius finally reveals the two children's whereabouts, assuming they will have accomplished their goal.\nAfter a few days pass, Lauren is preparing to leave Paris for home with her mother and stepfather. Moments before she's about to enter the car to depart, Lauren notices Daniel standing across the street, waiting to say goodbye to her. Her mother quickly objects to his presence, but her stepfather having warmed to the boy, allows her to go ahead and say her goodbyes.  Pledging not to become \u201clike everybody else,\u201d Lauren and Daniel share a final kiss and embrace.  She looks up and notices Julius waving to her from a nearby bench.

In a plot to defame Chen as a master of Kung Fu, ruin Chen and his sister's opera troupe and gain Miss Chen as a brothel worker, the villainous gangster and brothel-owner Tuan (Lo Lieh) along with his wife whom acts as the brothel Mistress, frame a drunken Chen for the rape of Tuan's wife, and inform Chen and his sister that the punishment for his \"crime\" is death, however Chen's sister offers herself to be Tuan's concubine and work in the brothel indefinitely in exchange for her brother's life. Getting exactly what he and his wife wanted, Tuan's agrees, though only with the addition of being able to cripple Chen's hands, knowing he will have ruined Chen's status as a master of Kung Fu in doing so.\nYears pass by, and after the tragedy that befell he and his sister, Chen comes to terms with his alcoholism, and maintains a life of sobriety. Chen also gives up opera performing and practicing monkey style Kung Fu, as he is haunted by a regret and shame that he is to blame for his sister's life due to his previous inability to maintain sobriety. Chen struggles as a street entertainer and candy salesman (now somewhat of a local celebrity due to his kind and giving nature) to make ends meet, performing with his beloved trained monkey Ah Mao.\nA young thief, albeit with a good heart, named Monkey, (Hsiao Ho) watches on with a group of children at Chen and Ah Mao's entertainment showcase, until it is interrupted by a group of the town's thugs and extortionists. When Chen barely affords to pay them, they retaliate by destroying Chen's set and throwing his candies across the town square. Monkey steps in to help Chen clean up and collect his things as the extortionists storm off through town. Monkey cracks up a plan to steal back the money that the extortionists had taken from Chen and gift him with a warm meal for dinner.\nAfter successfully stealing the money back from the local extortionists, Monkey later visits Chen at his home on the outskirts of town with an expensive meal and wine to enjoy, knowing Chen likely lost all of his money to the extortionists earlier. Chen, who believes Monkey has sought him out for a show, asks the young man's name, to which Monkey explains he doesn't know his own name, but is called Monkey. Chen remarks that he ...\"does act like one.\" and tells him that no show will be going on that night, and he begins to return to the paltry meal he's made for himself. Monkey begins to unpack the meal he's brought for Chen, waving the expensive wine he's purchased under Chen's nose. Chen starkly refuses the wine at first, even attempting to kick Monkey out for tempting him. Chen soon apologizes for his brash action after seeing Monkey meant no harm, and accepts the meal, offering to dine with Monkey. He then inquires how Monkey could possibly afford the expensive meal he's offered. Monkey reveals he's stolen the money for it, and from the thugs that extorted Chen earlier at that, stating, \"...After all, if you're not strong, you have to steal.\" Chen realizes Monkey has been dealt a bad card, and comments on the cruelty of the unforgiving world they live in, and agrees to eat the gift of a meal with Monkey, and Ah Mao at his side.\nThe two bond over the meal and soon begin an odd friendship, where Monkey occasionally visits Chen for advice and guidance. Monkey continues to steal for a living, until he is caught by the local thugs who beat him up and run him out of town. Monkey seeks solace with Chen who reprimands him for his continued stealing, warning him that if he continues, he'll likely end up dead. Monkey refutes Chen's notion with the statement that if he does not steal, he'll die from starvation anyhow, to which Chen states: \"I don't steal... I don't starve.\" Though true, Monkey sees his situation different from Chen's and remarks: \"You're different, you've got a monkey show! I'm different, I HAVE to steal!\". Chen pities the young man and the bad card he's been dealt in life, and offers him respite in his home for the night, allowing Monkey to sleep alongside Ah Mao.\nThe following day, the local thugs again attempt to extort what little money Chen earns from selling candies and doing street entertainment shows with Ah Mao. The extortionists throw Chen's candies across the town square again to distract him, then brutally murder Ah Mao, swinging him in circles from his leash and smashing the small monkey against a tree. Monkey \nvisits Chen at his home later that night after hearing the horrific story of what happened earlier, and offers to get revenge for Ah Mao and Chen, but Chen refuses, as Monkey would surely be risking his life attempting to go against the local extortionists. Monkey instead goes into business with Chen as a stand-in for the late Ah Mao using his natural Monkey like traits and acrobatic skills to put on a compelling and lucrative show for the townspeople. However, once again, the thugs return for more extortion money from Chen, and while Monkey becomes immediately frustrated and attempts to attack the thugs, Chen is able to easily hold Monkey back and keep him grounded so he does not fight back. Chen's pockets are turned out and he is once again robbed of his earnings by the extortionists, which gravely angers Monkey.\nWhen Monkey questions Chen why he does not act when the extortionists come around, Chen's passive attitude angers Monkey and he attempts to storm off for revenge. Chen however stops Monkey in his tracks with relative ease, exclaiming that Monkey would have no chance against them, which makes Monkey highly suspicious of the seemingly helpless old man. Monkey then argues with Chen pointing out that he knows Chen is hiding the fact he knows true Kung Fu rather than the monkey tricks he's been taught for their street performances. Chen disregards this and leaves Monkey bound so he can not act on his anger stating, \"Now listen kid... Stick to monkey tricks, and LIVE. You got that!?\"\nMonkey, feeling his pride stomped on by repeated extortion from the local thugs, confronts the men at a local restaurant. Exclaiming he no longer wants to be called \"Monkey\" but \"Monkey King\" by the thugs. He uses his monkey tricks and acrobatics to embarrass the thugs, however they quickly overpower him and quickly beat him to a pulp, leaving him for dead outside of the restaurant. When Monkey returns to Chen, he maintains his stance that he was fighting for justice rather than for violence, and that if he wouldn't have been beaten as badly if Chen had taught him true Kung Fu. Chen reluctantly agrees to this and begins to lightly train Monkey in his unique style of Monkey Kung Fu, far off in the mountains outside of town. Months later, although the training is not quite complete, Monkey believes he is strong enough to defeat not only the extortionists, but the boss they work for, and leaves Master Chen to enact his revenge against them all.\nMonkey travels back into town and fights the extortionists, easily defeating them and forcing them to bring him to their boss. Monkey is led to the extortionist's boss, an older man who runs the local brothel and happens to be, the villainous Tuan. Tuan laughs at Monkey's unpolished Monkey style Kung Fu, mockingly suggesting he knows what real Monkey style Kung Fu looks like, and knows how to defeat it. Monkey eagerly confronts Tuan, believing himself to be the better skilled martial artist, but is badly beaten by Tuan, nearly to death; however a suspicious concubine of Tuan's recognizes the distinct style of Kung Fu that Monkey is using, to be that of her own brother's. Revealing herself as Miss Chen, she steps in to assist Monkey in the fight against Tuan; though her efforts merely buy Monkey enough time to escape and she is killed brutally, albeit reluctantly, by Tuan.\nMonkey returns to his Master, Chen, bruised and beaten, and details his naive attempts to beat the extortionist's boss, the meeting with Chen's sister, and her death. Chen, tempted to flee into town and avenge his sister, is halted and reminded of his crippled hands by Monkey. With no hesitation, Monkey offers himself to be the hands of his master, and complete his training in Monkey style Kung Fu, to avenge everyone who has befallen the fate of crossing paths with Tuen, and protect the town from his devious acts of extortion and villainy. Chen agrees, and trains intensely for an unspecified time with Monkey, who uses the time to bond with his master in a unique and congruent fashion, coming to model himself as a fighter and a man on a whole, after Chen. Monkey's training concludes after a sparring match shows Monkey has grown fast and strong enough to finally land not only his first, but a nearly unexpected strike on his master, even though Monkey is using Chen's own Monkey style Kung Fu to compete against him. Chen can only smile as he is amazed how quickly Monkey has adapted to and learned his cherished style of martial arts.\nShortly thereafter, Monkey returns to the brothel in town with a new approach. Quickly working his way through all Tuan's henchmen with relative ease, Monkey's temper boils inside and he falters, getting physically trapped in a net by a group of Tuan's henchmen, who attempt to drag Monkey off and execute him. Chen appears just in time, and saves Monkey and they fight side by side thinning out the herd of Tuan's henchmen. When Monkey and Chen prove to be too much for the countless men Tuan throws at them, Tuan challenges them both head to head, and engages in combat with the Master and student. Tuan manages to hold his own against the crippled master and gains the upper hand. Monkey, eager to get revenge steps in to take his master's place and be his hands, and quickly turns the tables on the villainous Tuan. As Monkey fights Tuan by himself, his focus grows, and while calm and collected he clearly outclasses the older man with his youth, let alone sheer skill in martial arts. Seeing that he can't possibly win, Tuan tries to flee the fight, however Monkey doesn't let him, and cripples Tuan's hands by sending them through a thick paned glass lantern, as payback for his master. Chen watches on and excuses the aggressive action as he believes justice has been served, though before he can intervene, Monkey still fueled by rage and not forgetting the lives lost at the hands of Tuan, drags him up a tall balcony in the brothel and jumps off, leaving Tuan to fall to his death on the concrete floor at Chen's feet. As Monkey drops down to return to his master, the remaining staff of the brothel, including Tuan's wife peer down at Monkey and Chen in fear. As Monkey jumps up to teach them a lesson as well, Chen catches him and calms his rage, leaving the brothel and ending their quest of revenge.", "tmdb_plot": "A disgraced former Kung Fu expert makes a living as a merchant with the help of a hot headed friend.

Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretense of being on leave.\nBond survives attacks by Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival and on the Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, a young woman, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid indigenous to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River and comes under attack from Drax's forces, before eventually locating his base. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole back the loaned Shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead are locked in a room under the launch platform, and narrowly escape being burned alive by the exhausts of Moonraker 5, which is carrying Drax, and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.\nBond and Goodhead disable the radar jamming cloaking device; the United States sends a platoon of Marines aboard another shuttle to intercept the now-visible space station. Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would disperse the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life, their descendants a \"new master race.\" Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including him and Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines. Drax's forces are defeated as the station is destroyed, while Bond shoots and ejects Drax into space. Bond and Goodhead use Drax's laser-armed Moonraker 5 to destroy the three launched globes and return to Earth. Jaws and Dolly, who ejected themselves in one of Drax's escape pods, are recovered by the Marines. Bond's superiors get a video feed of Moonraker 5 and are bemused to see Bond and Goodhead making love in zero gravity.", "tmdb_plot": "After Drax Industries' Moonraker space shuttle is hijacked, secret agent James Bond is assigned to investigate, traveling to California to meet the company's owner, the mysterious Hugo Drax.

The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in Vietnam) shot hand-held on grainy  super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage.  The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt. One character burns his draft card, showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police overreaction during an anti-Vietnam protest.\nThe storylines and fates of the main characters include the following:\n\nNew Year's Eve 1964: John Milner is a drag-strip racer and falls in love with Eva, an attractive young woman from Iceland who speaks almost no English. Regardless, Milner does his best to communicate with her. He is briefly visited at the dragstrip by Steve, Laurie, Terry and Debbie, with Laurie pregnant and Terry in a military uniform, going to ship out to Vietnam the same night. Epilogue: Milner wins the final competition of the season on New Year's Eve 1964. Later that night, he is shown driving his trademark yellow deuce coupe down a long, hilly road with another vehicle's headlights coming the opposite direction. After disappearing over a small hill, neither Milner's taillights nor the approaching car's headlights are seen again, hinting that this may have been the crash in which Milner was killed. The anniversary of Milner's death is mentioned in both the 1965 and 1966 sequences.\nNew Year's Eve 1965: Terry \"The Toad\" Fields is in Vietnam and wants desperately to get out of the war and the abuse of his superiors, attempting to injure himself to do so. His desperation escalates after Joe Young (the leader of The Pharaohs, the lowrider gang of the previous film) is killed by a sniper in Vietnam, after promising to make Fields a Pharaoh once they return to civilian life. Epilogue: Fields fakes his own death and deserts for Europe; his superiors believe him to be dead in 1965, as do Debbie in 1966 and Steve and Laurie in 1967.\nNew Year's Eve 1966: Free-spirited Debbie \"Deb\" Dunham has switched from Old Harper whisky to marijuana and has given up her platinum blonde persona for one as a hippie/groupie. She misses Terry, mentioning that they were planning to get married before he went MIA in Vietnam. She is currently dating another hippie, Lance Harris, and wants to get married, but he isn't interested. At the beginning of the storyline, as they drive around San Francisco, they get pulled over by Bob Falfa, the drag racer from the first movie who has gone on to become a SFPD motorcycle patrolman, and arrests Lance for possession of a marijuana joint. She bails him out, but he still isn't interested at the idea of marriage, and acts distant towards her. She then joins some hippies of the band \"Electric Haze\" on a long, strange trip running over garbage cans, and they end up in a country-and-western bar. Epilogue: Dancing at the country-and-western bar, Debbie sees Lance dancing with another woman, so she hits him in the face and dumps him, causing a bar fight, and later joins the Electric Haze on another trip, as they go to watch the sunset. She ends up getting a full-time job as lead singer of a country-and-western music group.\nNew Year's Eve 1967: Steve Bolander and Laurie Henderson are now married with two children (it is implied they married because of Laurie's unplanned pregnancy), and living in the suburbs, but their relationship is strained by her insistence that she start her own career. Steve forbids it, saying he wants her to be a mom to their young twins.  Way beyond the end of her rope, Laurie leaves Steve and goes to stay with her brother Andy, who with his girlfriend Vicki (played by Cindy Williams' real-life sister, Carol-Ann Williams) is participating in an anti-war protest on a college campus, and is unsympathetic to her concerns. However, as Andy goes to the protest, he forgets his wallet behind and calls her to ask her to retrieve it. However, when she finds out that Andy is going to burn his draft card, she refuses to give it to him, just as the campus is surrounded by the police, and attempts to leave. She criticizes Andy's anti-war protest actions, saying that if the war was ended, Terry would have \"died\" for nothing. As they evade the police on the campus, Steve arrives, they embrace and he agrees to let her work, albeit in a few years, causing another argument between them and they are detained by the police. Epilogue: As the night falls, with Laurie, Vicki and all the female detainees held in a prison bus, Steve talks to her through the bus window bars, agreeing to let her work if she wants and they reconcile. However, as they attempt to convince the police that they are not demonstrators, a policeman hits the bus window bars with a truncheon, barely missing Laurie's fingers. When Steve tries to intervene, the policeman hits him in the chest, sparking a riot, and Steve and Andy escape, driving the bus off the campus. Steve, Laurie, Andy and Vicki watch the Times Square Ball drop on a TV in a store window. Steve continues to work as an insurance agent and Laurie becomes the head of a consumer group.The final scene of the movie shows Steve, Laurie, Andy and Vicki in front of the television store, Debbie and the Electric Haze in the band's van and Terry walking alone AWOL, all singing \"Auld Lang Syne\". Also, Milner is seen driving in his deuce coupe, listening to it on the radio, as he drives down the long, hilly road.\nWolfman Jack briefly reprised his role, but in voice only.

Inspired by the idea of \"making millions of people happy\", Kermit sets off on a cross-country trip to Hollywood.\nKermit meets Fozzie Bear, who is working as a hapless stand-up comedian, and Kermit invites Fozzie on his journey. The two set out in Fozzie's 1951 Studebaker, but are soon pursued by entrepreneur Doc Hopper (Charles Durning) and his assistant Max (Austin Pendleton) in an attempt by Hopper to convince Kermit to be the new spokesfrog of Hopper's struggling French-fried frog legs restaurant franchise. Horrified, Kermit kindly refuses and he and Fozzie drive away. Unwilling to accept Kermit's refusal, Hopper resorts to increasingly forceful means of persuasion. In an old church, Kermit and Fozzie meet the rock band Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, and the band's manager Scooter, who help them disguise their car.

When her father drops dead at the mill of a heart attack\u2014a death that could have been averted had he been allowed to leave his post early instead of waiting for his allotted break\u2014she is more determined to continue the fight.\nManagement retaliates against the organization efforts, first by rearranging shifts so that workers are doing more work at less pay, and then by posting fliers with racial invective in the hope of dividing white and black workers and diluting the momentum. Warshowsky demands Norma copy down the racist flier word for word in order to use it as evidence for government sanctions against her mill. When she attempts to transcribe the flier, management attempts to stop her, then fire her on grounds of creating a disturbance, and call the police to remove her from the plant. While awaiting the sheriff, Norma Rae takes a piece of cardboard, writes the word \"UNION\" on it, stands on her work table, and slowly turns to show the sign around the room.  One by one, the other workers stop their mill machines, and eventually, the entire room becomes silent. After all the machines have been switched off, Norma Rae is taken to jail but is freed by Reuben.\nUpon returning home to her family, Norma decides to talk to her children and tell them the story of her life, their questionable parentage, and recent arrest, so that they are prepared for any smears that may come from those hoping to discredit her efforts. After a tense exchange with Reuben, Sonny asks her if they have been intimate; she says no, but acknowledges \"he's in my head.\" Sonny, in turn, tells her there's no other woman in his head and he will always remain with her.\nAn election to unionize the factory takes place, with Norma and Reuben listening as best as possible from outside the mill as reporters and TV cameras observe the vote count. With a difference shy of 100 votes, the result is a victory for the union. Shortly after, Reuben says goodbye to Norma; despite his being smitten with her, they shake hands because he knows she is married and loves her husband, and Reuben heads back to New York.", "tmdb_plot": "Norma Rae is a southern textile worker employed in a factory with intolerable working conditions.

Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund, which consisted of $1,206 ($4,967 in 2022 dollars). It turns out being an awful mistake, because she has a husband who is a reckless gambler.\nOn his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop owned by Sam the Tailor (Carl Ballantine), and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse, Sundae Treat, loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed.\nThat evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast.  He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \"jazz up\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken). They want Hill to help them close down the gambling racket by recruiting some men from the church to place bets that the agents will watch. Hill cannot find any men to help, but hits upon the idea of using women.  Five women from his congregation attempt to place bets in the company of the Treasury agents, but ending up in some kind of disastrously clumsy result.\nThe team changes tactics to try to go after the \"bank\" that the gangsters use, tailing the mob's deliverymen through town while Hill coordinates using a map at the church office.\nTwo gangsters subsequently appear at the church during services and identify one of the women, Claire Porter (Cloris Leachman).

They do so, and continue to hammer the gangsters' movements around town. Meanwhile, Hill receives word that the pulpit has been declared vacant and North Avenue will be discontinued as a church entity.\nDr. Victor Fulton (Herb Voland), a representative from presbytery, arrives to discuss the closure with Hill. Anne picks up two more presbytery representatives at the airport, Dr. Rheems (Ruth Buzzi) and Reverend Wainwright (Ivor Francis), but while bringing them to the church, she recognizes one of the mob's deliverymen and realizes she may be able to find the bank.

Elliott and popular quarterback Seth Maxwell are outstanding players, but they characterize the drug-, sex-, and alcohol-fueled party atmosphere of that era. Elliott wants only to play the game, retire, and live on a horse farm with his girlfriend Charlotte, an aspiring writer who appears to be financially independent due to a trust fund from her wealthy family and who has no interest whatsoever in football.\nThe Bulls play for iconic Coach Strother, who turns a blind eye to anything that his players may be doing off the field or anything that his assistant coaches and trainers condone to keep those players in the game. The coach is focused on player \"tendencies\", a quantitative measurement of their performance, and seems less concerned about the human aspect of the game and the players. One player, Shaddock, finally erupts to assistant Coach Johnson: \"Every time I call it a 'game', you call it a 'business'. And every time I call it a 'business', you call it a 'game'.\" The coaches manipulate Elliott to convince a younger, injured rookie on the team to start using painkillers.\nElliott's nonconformist attitude incurs the coach's wrath more than once, and at one point, the coach informs Elliott that his continuing attitude could affect his future career with the Bulls. In the final game of the season, Elliot catches a touchdown pass with no time left on the clock to get North Dallas to within one point of division rival Chicago, but the Bulls lose the game due to a mishandled snap on the extra point attempt. In a meeting with the team owners and Coach Strother, Elliott learns that a Dallas detective has been hired by the Bulls to follow him. They reveal proof of his marijuana use and a sexual relationship with a woman named Joanne, who intends to marry team executive Emmett Hunter, the brother of owner Conrad Hunter. It is loosely implied that Emmett might be gay, and it is why she went to Elliot for her sexual needs. Although the detective witnessed quarterback Seth Maxwell engaging in similar behavior, he pretends not to have recognized him. They tell Elliott that he is to be suspended without pay pending a league hearing, and Elliott, convinced that the entire investigation is merely a pretext to allow the team to save money on his contract, quits the team, telling the Hunter brothers that he does not need their money that bad.\nAs he is leaving the team's headquarters in downtown Dallas, Elliot runs into Maxwell, who seems to have been waiting for him. Elliot informs him that he quit, prompting Maxwell to ask if his name came up in the meeting. Elliot deduces that Maxwell knew about the investigation the entire time.

Leaving his young wife Lucy behind in Wismar, Harker travels to Transylvania, to Count Dracula's castle, in a journey that lasts four weeks, carrying with him the deeds and documents needed to sell the house to the Count. On his trip, Harker stops at a village inn, where the locals plead for him to stay away from the accursed castle, providing him with details of Dracula's vampirism. Ignoring the villagers' pleas as superstition, Harker continues his journey, ascending the Borgo Pass on foot and eventually arriving at Dracula's castle, where he meets the Count, a strange, almost rodent-like man, with large ears, pale skin, sharp teeth, and long fingernails.\nThe Count is enchanted by a small portrait of Lucy and immediately agrees to purchase the Wismar property, especially with the knowledge that he and Lucy would become neighbors.

Simultaneously, in Wismar, Lucy is tormented by night terrors, plagued by images of impending doom. Additionally, Renfield is committed to an asylum after biting a cow, apparently having gone completely insane. To Harker's horror, he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, confirming for him that Dracula is indeed a vampire. That night, Dracula leaves for Wismar, taking several coffins filled with the cursed earth that he needs for his vampiric rest. Harker finds that he is imprisoned in the castle and attempts to escape through a window via a makeshift rope fashioned from bedsheets. The rope is not long enough, and Jonathan falls, severely injuring himself. The next morning, he awakes on the ground, stirred by the sound of a young Romani boy playing the violin. He is eventually sent to a hospital and raves about 'black coffins' to doctors, who assume that the illness affects his mind.\nMeanwhile, Dracula and his coffins travel to Wismar by ship via the Black Sea port of Varna, thence through the Bosphorus and the Strait of Gibraltar and around the entire west European Atlantic coast to the Baltic Sea.

Now aware that something other than plague is responsible for the death that has beset her once-peaceful town, Lucy desperately tries to convince the townspeople, but they are skeptical and uninterested. From a book given to Jonathan by the people in Transylvania, she finds that she can defeat Dracula's evil by distracting him until dawn, at which time the rays of the sun will destroy him, but only at the cost of her own life.

Oakes approaches the prison's 'Mr Big', (Genial) Harry Grout (Peter Vaughan), and using a cut from his last job before being caught, asks for his escape to be arranged. Grout sets the price, then begins making arrangements.\nGrout starts by forcing Fletcher (Ronnie Barker) to persuade the prison Governor to allow an inmates-versus-celebrities football match, to boost prisoner morale and 'put Slade on the map'. Fletcher successfully manipulates new prison officer Mr Beale (Christopher Godwin) to make the suggestion to Senior Officer Mr Mackay (Fulton Mackay), who approaches the governor and is approved, although all three claim the idea was theirs alone. Fletcher then becomes the prison team's manager and Grout next insists that Oakes be on the team.\nThe celebrity team arrive in a coach. The prisoners are notably underwhelmed when it is explained that their hopes for one of The Goodies on the team have not been met, the nearest they have to a famous face being a weather presenter from Anglia Television (Duncan Preston). During the match, Oakes feigns an injury and is taken to the changing rooms where he meets the coach driver, revealed as an accomplice. They exchange clothes and Oakes ties the coach driver up to throw off any suspicion. Shortly afterwards, Godber (Richard Beckinsale) is concussed on the field so Fletcher takes him to the changing rooms, where he sees the ruse unfolding. Taking no chances, Oakes, now disguised as the coach driver, forces Fletcher and a dazed Godber into the coach's luggage compartment at gunpoint then drives out of the prison under the guise of topping up the fuel.\nOut into the country, Oakes meets further accomplices and they drive Fletcher and Godber away in another vehicle. Meanwhile, the prison officers have discovered the escape and the police and the Home Office are informed, both searching for the coach, though the prison officers' attempt to help isn't well met with police, as no one can explain how they let three inmates drive out of the gates. Fletcher tells Oakes that they don't want to escape as he and Godber only have a short time left to serve, and that they won't tell anyone about Oakes's plan because it's 'Them and Us'.\nOakes relents and releases them and they find a barn to hide in and catch their breath. They help themselves to some apples.  Fletcher explains to Godber that there is no possible way that being caught outside ends well for them, as any policeman they approach will claim the find for himself. Furthermore, he realises that once the Governor, Mackay and Beale start passing the idea of the match back down the line, it'll end up with Fletcher looking like the responsible one and he'll serve more time, meaning the only solution is to break back into prison.\nMaking their way through fields and villages, they steal a sexton's bicycle, and manage to sneak back into the coach just as the police let the prison officers take it back to the prison. Once inside the prison walls, both convicts slip out of the coach and smuggle themselves into the prison officers' club storeroom, where Fletcher quickly consumes several bottles of alcohol to become inebriated enough to make their story pass: they stumbled on Oakes tying up the bus driver and he forced them down the delivery hatch, where they claim to have been since.\nThe story is believed by all, and life seems to return to normal. As the other inmates question Fletcher on what really happened, Grouty subtly tells him that he will be rewarded for his efforts and keeping his mouth shut. Later in their cell, Godber laments that Oakes got away, though Fletcher assures him that it won't matter: Oakes will hate being on the run. Fletcher reminds Godber that in a few months, he'll leave prison as well: the difference being he'll be free and clear.\nMr Mackay visits them and tells them that, while the Governor believes they have been locked in the storeroom all day, it doesn't explain the mysterious UFO Sightings in the village (Unidentified Fleeing Objects), and the various happenings they created on their journey.

They are traveling north, where Essex hopes to reunite with his brother, Francha (Thomas Hill).\nEssex and Vivia eventually find Francha's apartment, but the reunion is short-lived. While Essex is out buying firewood, a gambler named Redstone (Craig Richard Nelson) throws a bomb into Francha's apartment, killing everyone inside, including Vivia. Essex sees Redstone fleeing the scene and chases him to the sector's \"Information Room.\" Essex witnesses the murder of Redstone by an Italian gambler named St. Christopher (Vittorio Gassman). When St. Christopher leaves, Essex searches Redstone's pockets and finds a piece of paper with a list of names: Francha, Redstone, Goldstar, Deuca, St. Christopher, and Ambrosia.\nPuzzled by the mystery, Essex discovers that Redstone had previously checked into the Hotel Electra, a gambling resort in another sector. He visits the hotel and assumes Redstone's identity. Immediately after checking in, Essex is given an unexpected welcome by Grigor (Fernando Rey), who is the dealer in the casino. Insisting that he means no harm, Grigor invites Essex (as \"Redstone\") to the casino, where gamblers are now heavily involved in a \"Quintet\" tournament. While there he meets Ambrosia (Bibi Andersson), who always assumes the role of the  \"sixth player\" in the game.\nEssex is unaware that the current Quintet tournament is a fight for the survival of the fittest. Those who are \"killed\" in game are executed in real life. Grigor and St. Christopher are aware that Essex is not the real Redstone, so they ignore him and focus on the other players. Goldstar (David Langton) is the first killed, followed by Deuca (Nina Van Pallandt), until the only two players left are St. Christopher and Ambrosia. Ambrosia, however, insists that Essex be counted as a player in the game since he has assumed Redstone's identity. Grigor agrees and informs St. Christopher that he has to eliminate Essex before he can face off against Ambrosia.\nEssex and St. Christopher have a showdown outside the city, where St. Christopher is killed by falling into a rupture of the ice sheet. Essex returns to Francha's apartment and finds the same list that Redstone had. Ambrosia follows Essex to the apartment. Essex slits her throat moments before her attempt to slit his throat.\nReturning to the Hotel Electra to cremate Ambrosia's body, Essex confronts Grigor to demand his \"prize\", since he was the winner of Quintet. Grigor reveals that the only prize is the thrill of the game itself. Grigor insists he stay and participate in future tournaments, but a disgusted Essex condemns Quintet and leaves the hotel for good.

Colombo lives in a battered but lively palace with a railing; he has for neighbors a woman who is perpetually pregnant, the members of the theater cooperative \"Quelli di Grock\", a girl always intent on carrying heaps of rags and a ramshackle dance school attended by a student he is in love with, but she won't even look at him.\nHe is, in his own way, a genius of electronics and automation (he has built a contraption that prepares his breakfast and brings it to him in bed, and which hands him his clothes for the day), however his job is that of a waiter at a remote drinks kiosk at the top of Montagnetta di San Siro. The owner is a fat and alcoholic hag who is the only customer of herself and spends her days being served beers by Colombo. The routine is interrupted when the wheelchair bound manager of an international summit has a heart attack: one of those present at the summit calls a nearby bar to bring a glass of water, but by mistake dials the number of the kiosk.\nColombo finds himself having to run across Milan carrying the glass of water on a tray, which during the journey suffers a sequence of ridiculous accidents: it is first poured into the helmet of a traffic cop, then some painters accidentally dip the brushes in it, it is soiled by the unloading of a truck, pigeons eat birdseed in it and finally an insect falls into it. Once at its destination, the concoction is still drunken by the now cyanotic boss, who not only recovers, but miraculously gets up from his wheelchair laughing and hopping. It would therefore seem that Colombo's life is at a turning point: at the kiosk a long line of paralytics is queuing to drink the miraculous concoction, which Colombo prepares by skilfully reproducing on the spot all the previous misadventures. But then the boss buys the entire kiosk with millions to turn it into a sanctuary.\nThe hag, who now advertises herself as a saint, is enthusiastic about the project while Colombo is suddenly unemployed. The engineer, to make ends meet, improvises himself as a violinist for the deranged theatrical cooperative which is based in his condominium. His life, however, does not improve much: the impresario, strict and grim, comes to the courtyard to gather the actors and leave for a show but, not seeing them arrive, goes up to the messy apartment where they sleep and wakes them up with a trumpet; they rush to wash up the dishes, throwing them from one part of the kitchen to the other in a sort of hilarious assembly line, and are finally loaded badly into the van.\nColombo, who finds himself sleeping in the condominium garbage can, is also awakened abruptly. After grotesque incidents along the way, the company arrives in the courtyard of a rural town scattered in the fog, where it sets up a pathetic show (the improbable Magic Show) in the midst of chickens, geese and cows. In the meantime, the impresario does nothing but devour everything that comes his way, even the flowers that the local children give him. The spectators, at first only perplexed by the insipid staging, then take up shovels and pitchforks and force the actors to a long and ruinous escape on foot.\nBack home exhausted, Colombo is again snubbed by the dancer he is in love with, who instead rushes to help a neighbor. He then decides to take action but, too shy to woo the girl himself, builds a remote controlled automaton made in his own image. The animatronic is sent to the balcony, and Colombo finally manages to attract the attention of the dancer. The two go to the disco; Colombo, who remains at home to pilot the automaton, follows the evening on a screen and all seems to go well until the control system explodes: the automaton is jammed and continually orders the waiter two drinks, sitting next to the now completely drunk girl.\nAlerted by the explosion, the girl who constantly collects rags rushes to Colombo's house.

He and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Despite their mutual agreement not to seek a rematch, Apollo challenges Rocky again to prove that Rocky going the distance with him was a fluke, but Rocky declines and retires from professional boxing. Balboa's girlfriend, Adrian, supports his choice as do his doctors who go on to reveal that Rocky will require surgery for a detached retina, a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response to his question of whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Creed confirms that he did. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his newfound celebrity status. An agent sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after Adrian reveals that she is pregnant.\nMeanwhile, fuelled by hate mail claiming he fixed the fight in order to protect his reign as champ, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish Apollo demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement, despite the pleas of his friends and family that Rocky's ability to absorb punishment is too dangerous for his chances to successfully defend the title a second time.\nRocky at first seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After several unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of fighting again. Mickey declines out of concern for Rocky's health, but he changes his mind     after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky insists that he knows nothing else so this is the only way he can provide for them. Adrian, disappointed at the fact that Rocky broke his promise, refuses to support him.\nRocky and Mickey begin training but Rocky is unfocused due to Adrian's disapproval.

Despite being born premature the baby is healthy, but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what happened and refuses to leave her bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until the baby can be together with his mother. When Adrian comes out of her coma she finds Rocky by her bedside, and the couple are soon shown their new baby, a boy, which they name Robert \"Rocky Jr\". Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch and Rocky quickly gets into shape for the fight.\nOn Thanksgiving, the night of the match, Apollo makes a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the distance was a fluke. In order to protect his vulnerable eye Rocky opts to fight right-handed rather than his natural southpaw, leaving him at a major disadvantage. Knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight, Rocky still manages to fight hard enough to win one round. Going into the fifteenth and final round Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. However Creed wants to win by knock-out in order to erase any doubts about his superiority and ignores his trainer's pleas to stay back.

The cloud easily destroys three Klingon warships and Epsilon Nine on its course. On Earth, the starship Enterprise is undergoing a major refit; its former commanding officer, James T. Kirk, has been promoted to Admiral. Starfleet Command assigns Enterprise to intercept the cloud entity, as the ship is the only one within range, requiring its new systems to be tested in transit.\nCiting his experience, Kirk uses his authority to take command of the ship, angering Captain Willard Decker, who has been overseeing the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of Enterprise's new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the ship's Vulcan science officer Sonak, are killed by a malfunctioning transporter, and improperly calibrated engines nearly destroy the ship. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the ship's new systems increases the tension between him and Decker, who has been temporarily demoted to commander and first officer. Commander Spock arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge himself of emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud, making him unable to complete the ritual because his human half felt an emotional connection to it.\nEnterprise intercepts the energy cloud and is attacked by an alien vessel within. A probe appears on the bridge, attacks Spock, and abducts the navigator, Ilia. She is replaced by a robotic replica, sent by the entity, which calls itself \"V'Ger\", to study the \"carbon units\" on the ship. Decker is distraught over the loss of Ilia, with whom he had a romantic history, and becomes troubled as he attempts to extract information from the doppelg\u00e4nger, which has Ilia's memories and feelings buried inside. Spock takes an unauthorized spacewalk to the vessel's interior and attempts a telepathic mind meld with it. In doing so, he learns that the entire vessel is V'Ger, a non-biological living machine.\nAt the center of the massive ship, V'Ger is revealed to be Voyager 6, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost in a black hole. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey, the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved sentience. Spock discovers that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a purpose other than its original mission; having learned everything it could on its journey home, it finds its existence meaningless. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the \"Creator\" come in person to finish the sequence. Everyone realizes humans are the Creator. Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new life form that disappears into space.

One day, as Don scurries across a kitchen floor, he is suddenly crushed by a foot. The narrator Gilliam remarks that this does not matter, as cockroaches are not very interesting.

Eventually the chain of interconnected people reaches a cleaning lady who is involved in a search-and-destroy mission against a colony of cockroaches, one of whom is named Don. The film then loops back to Don, replaying some of the earlier events until a gruff voice interrupts the narrator with \"You already said that!\" and the sound of a punch.

However, they once stayed out late at night, carousing, misbehaving, and even cheating on their owner by shaking other hands. One of the hands was once seen out with a foot, causing a scandal in the upper-class society of hands, who were prejudiced against feet.

After he explains how it works (including a \"non-return key\" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a \"vaporizing equalizer\" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables  arrive at the house searching for Jack the Ripper. A bag with blood-stained gloves belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson, leads them to conclude that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone.\nStevenson has escaped to the future, but because he does not have the \"non-return\" key, the machine automatically returns to 1893. Herbert uses it to pursue Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine has ended up on display at a museum in San Francisco. He is deeply shocked by the future, having expected it to be an enlightened socialist utopia, only to find chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed.\nAt an antique shop, Herbert exchanges some British bank notes for present-day American money. Growing hungry after a day without food, he enters a McDonald's and is alternately puzzled and pleased with 1979 dining options, noting the similarity between 1890s pommes frites from France and modern French fries. Wells is still ruffled by the idea of dining without tableware.\nReasoning that Stevenson would also need to exchange his British money, Herbert asks about him at various banks. At the Chartered Bank of London, he meets employee Amy Robbins, who says she had directed Stevenson to a local hotel.\nConfronted by his one-time friend Herbert, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society to be pleasingly violent, stating: \"Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Today, I'm an amateur.\"\nHerbert demands he return to 1893 to face justice, but Stevenson instead attempts to wrestle the time machine's key from him. Their struggle is interrupted by a maid and Stevenson flees, getting hit by a car during the frantic chase. Herbert follows him to the hospital emergency room and mistakenly gets the impression that Stevenson has died from his injuries.\nHerbert meets up with Amy Robbins again and she initiates a romance. Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money. Suspecting that it was Amy who had led Herbert to him, he finds out where she lives.\nHerbert, hoping to convince her of the truth, takes a highly skeptical Amy three days into the future. Once there, she is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the Ripper's fifth victim.\nHerbert persuades her that they must go back \u2013 it is their duty to attempt to prevent the fourth victim's murder, then prevent Amy's. However, they are delayed upon their return to the present and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Herbert is arrested because of his knowledge of the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless, and at the mercy of the \"San Francisco Ripper\".\nWhile Herbert unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amy's peril, she attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally do investigate her apartment, they find the dismembered body of a woman. Now convinced of Herbert's innocence, the police release a now-heartbroken Wells. However, he is contacted by Stevenson, who had actually killed Amy's coworker (revealed to be the dead body in Amy's apartment) and taken Amy hostage in order to extort the time machine key from Wells.\nStevenson flees with the key \u2013 and Amy as insurance \u2013 to attempt a permanent escape in the time machine. Using Amy's car, driving the unfamiliar machine erratically, Herbert manages to follow them back to the museum. While Herbert bargains for Amy's life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine, Herbert removes the \"vaporizing equalizer\" from it, causing Stevenson to vanish while the machine does not. As Herbert had explained earlier, this causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent traveling endlessly through time with no way to stop; in effect, he is destroyed.\nHerbert proclaims that the time has come to return to his own time, in order to destroy a machine that he now knows is too dangerous for primitive mankind.

As it so happens, Guido lives estranged from his wife Petula, the other patent holder to the glass, who would be more accessible to the insurance companies' offers. Her condition for the divorce from Guido would be that he should transfer all his exclusive rights to the production of the Quiller glass - and thereby his whole fortune - to her, whereupon she would sell them to the Swiss Assurance and gain a princely monetary compensation in return.\nThe day Guido announces the news that he will lose all his money to his wife, his young lover Maggie leaves him, as she was only after his money.

Their grandfather had earlier attempted to break into a jewelry shop, only to be thwarted by the Quiller glass, and was arrested by the police.

Guido eventually confides in his faithful butler, Benny, about his growing affection for Tilli and his issues concerning his true identity, whereupon Benny suggests that Guido should become a thief himself. Using his intelligence, Guido, who publicly \"borrows\" his butler's name to remain anonymous, bails Tilli's grandfather out of prison, becomes a highly successful master thief and gradually gains Tilli's affection.\nIn order to win Tilli over for good, Guido stages a breakin into his own villa, where he presents her with a ring and prepares to reveal his true identity.

Cyrus proposes to the assembled crowd a citywide truce and alliance that would allow the gangs to control the city together, since they collectively outnumber the police by three to one.\nMost of the gang members applaud this idea, but Luther, the unbalanced and sadistic leader of the Rogues, shoots Cyrus dead as police officers arrive to raid the summit. In the ensuing chaos, Luther realizes that one of the Warriors, Fox, appears to suspect him, and makes a false accusation which leads the vengeful Riffs to attack the \"Warlord\", Cleon. Meanwhile, the other Warriors escape, unaware that they have been implicated in Cyrus's killing. The Riffs put out a hit on the Warriors through a radio DJ. Swan, the \"War Chief,\" takes charge of the group as they try to get home.\nThe Turnbull ACs spot the Warriors and try to run them down with a modified school bus, but the Warriors escape and board an elevated train. On the ride to Coney Island, the train is stopped by a building fire alongside the tracks, stranding the Warriors in Tremont. Setting out on foot, they encounter the Orphans, who are insecure about their low status in the gang hierarchy as they were excluded from Cyrus's meeting. After Mercy, the girlfriend of the Orphans' leader, instigates a confrontation, Swan throws a Molotov cocktail and the Warriors run to the nearest subway station. Impressed, and desperate to escape her depressed neighborhood, Mercy follows the Warriors.\nWhen the group arrives at the 96th Street and Broadway station in Manhattan, they are pursued by police and separated. Three of them, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt, escape by boarding a subway car. Fox, struggling with a police officer, is thrown onto the tracks and is fatally hit by a passing train as Mercy flees the scene. Swan, Ajax, Snow and Cowboy are chased by the Baseball Furies into Riverside Park but defeat them in a brawl. After the fight, Ajax sees a lone woman sitting on a park bench and leaves the group despite Swan's objections. When Ajax becomes sexually aggressive, the woman, revealed to be an undercover police officer, handcuffs him to the bench and arrests him.\nUpon arriving at Union Square, Vermin, Cochise and Rembrandt are seduced by an all-female gang called the Lizzies and invited into their hideout. They narrowly escape the Lizzies' subsequent attack, learning in the process that the gangland community believes the Warriors murdered Cyrus. Acting as a lone scout, Swan decides to return to the 96th Street station, where Mercy joins him (although he spurns her promiscuity). After reaching the Union Square station, they reunite with the remaining Warriors and engage in a fight with a roller-skating gang, the Punks, which allows Mercy to prove herself in combat. Meanwhile, an unidentified gang member visits the Riffs and tells them that he saw Luther shoot Cyrus.\nAt dawn, the Warriors finally reach Coney Island, only to find Luther and the Rogues waiting for them. Swan challenges Luther to single combat, but Luther pulls a gun instead. Swan dodges his shot and throws a switchblade (taken from one of the Punks) into Luther's wrist, disarming him. The Riffs arrive, acknowledging the Warriors' courage and skill before apprehending the Rogues. As the Riffs descend upon him, Luther screams.

A subsequent federal investigation named the sole perpetrator to be a lone gunman named Willie Arnold, who is murdered by nightclub owner Joe Diamond before he can stand trial.\nNineteen years later, Nick Kegan, half-brother of Timothy and heir to the wealthy Kegan dynasty, is on his father's oil tanker when a helicopter lands carrying Keifetz, a family associate, and a heavily-bandaged man named Arthur Fletcher. Carried into sick bay, Fletcher tells an orderly that in 1960 he and another gunman were hired by a man named Casper Jr. to assassinate President Kegan, with Arnold set up as a patsy. Fletcher claims to have stashed the rifle used in the assassination in room 903 of the Engleson Building in Philadelphia. Before Nick can question him any further, Fletcher dies of his injuries.\nNick, accompanied by his friend Miles Gardner and Police Captain Heller, travels to Philadelphia; uncovering the rifle from its hiding place. As the three are leaving, a young woman on a bicycle passes by and seconds later an unseen sniper shoots and kills Nick's companions. In a panic, Nick rushes to a payphone and tries to call his father, but is instead connected to his chief accountant John Cerruti. When Nick reports the incident and his whereabouts, Cerruti promises to send help, but the rifle is stolen by an unseen person as Nick waits.\nNick travels to his father Pa's California desert estate, only to be promptly rebuked for leaving the tanker. When Nick reports Fletcher's confession and the incident in Philadelphia, Pa initially storms off, but later resolves to help Nick expose the assassination conspiracy. Nick learns that Captain Heller has been dead for over two years, the one killed in Philadelphia was an imposter.\nPa sends Nick to meet his former political rival and one of the wealthiest men in the U.S., Z.K. Dawson. Threatening Nick with a tank, Dawson maintains his innocence, but implicates the real Heller and his right-hand man Lt. Roy Doty. Pa calls Nick to tell him that Keifetz and the orderly that recorded Fletcher's confession have both died under mysterious circumstances.\nNick meets Doty, who remembers that the man implicated in Fletcher's confession, Casper, Jr., was connected to the Philadelphia police through Joe Diamond. According to Doty, Diamond bribed Captain Heller for access into the police station so he could kill Willie Arnold after the presidential assassination. Gangster Gameboy Baker arranged the assassination because the president did not return favors for the mafia's $2 million campaign contribution and Arnold was their scapegoat. Diamond died in prison four years after the killing of Arnold.\nNick asks his girlfriend Yvette Malone to help him track down information about Joe Diamond through her employer, National Magazine. She directs him to a Cleveland, Ohio diner, where he meets gangster Irving Mentor and bribes him for information. Mentor reports that Casper, Jr., figured in the assassination because he was connected to a Hollywood studio that lost $50 million when one of their stars killed herself over an affair with the President. Just then, the same woman on the bicycle who appeared before the shootings in Philadelphia brings a dead cat into Mentor's diner and Nick chases after her as the restaurant explodes from a bomb, the woman escaping.\nNick returns to New York, where Pa debunks Mentor's story and orders Nick to meet with imprisoned gangster Frank Mayo, who was given special leave for the interview. When Mayo suggests that Nick is being misled, Nick heads to National Magazine headquarters and learns that Yvette is not actually an employee. Later, the hostile doorman at Yvette's apartment insists that she does not live there.\nReturning home, Nick finds Keifetz, who admits that he faked his death and encourages Nick to use Cerruti's intelligence connections to find Yvette. At Pa's financial headquarters, Cerrutti tells Nick that Yvette was kidnapped by Casper Jr., and recounts a new version of the assassination. According to Cerruti, a Washington, D.C. madam named Lola Comante, who obliged the president's fondness for sex, offered him a $2 million campaign contribution from Mayo and his mafia associates. When the president discovered that Pa was behind the deal, he ended their relationship, leaving Pa financially and emotionally devastated.\nChanging the story yet again, Cerruti confesses that he arranged for Nick to meet a fraudulent Z.K. Dawson in Tulsa. The real Dawson and his daughter, Yvette, were the true perpetrators of the assassination; Yvette, formerly known as Maggie Dawson, was the president's mistress. Nick discounts Cerruti's story and insists on learning Yvette's whereabouts. As Nick assaults and fractures Cerruti's arms with a baton, he breaks down. Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette. When Cerruti says that Jenny is \"tied up\" at Kegan Medical School, Nick leaves to find her body in the morgue.\nSometime later, Nick confronts his father in his office, but Pa claims that Cerruti masterminded the assassination to augment the Kegan coffers and blackmailed Pa into keeping quiet. When Nick attempts to call the police, Keifetz and an officer break into Pa's office and Nick thinks the men are there to back him up; however, Pa announces that Keifetz is an assassin with orders to kill Nick. Defending himself, Nick grabs the officer and uses his gun to fire at Keifetz, who shoots back at the officer as he dies.

They hire a boat and two guides\u2014Brian Hull (Al Cliver) and his girlfriend Susan Barrett (Auretta Gay)\u2014to reach Matul.\nMeanwhile, on Matul, British doctor David Menard (Richard Johnson), and his wife Paola (Olga Karlatos) have been researching the phenomenon of zombie reanimation. Paola wishes to flee the island, but Menard insists on staying. That night, Paola is alone in the house when a zombie tries to enter; she pushes the door shut but it breaks through with one arm. Paola is dragged through the hole and killed, with her eye being gouged out by splintered wood.\nApproaching Matul, Barrett dives in the ocean around the boat. She encounters a shark, and flees behind a reef only to be accosted by a submerged zombie. Surfacing, she reaches the boat while the shark and zombie attack each other. Eventually, the boat docks at Matul.\nMenard is alarmed to find that one of his colleagues, Fritz, has died of the zombie infection. He tells his remaining staff to shoot all the dead bodies in their heads. While digging a grave for a body, he hears a signal flare and follows it to discover the boat group. Menard sends them back to his mansion in order to fetch his wife, where they discover Paola's corpse being eaten by zombies. The group fends off an attack against them and escapes in a jeep, with West suffering an ankle injury when the vehicle veers off-road after slamming into a zombie. Resting in a jungle clearing, the group realize they have encountered a Conquistador-era graveyard; Barrett is killed when one of the corpses rises from the earth and bites out her throat.\nAs more corpses reanimate, the group flees to the local hospital, where Menard explains that the dead are rising as a result of a voodoo curse which he has been trying to stop. The hospital is besieged by zombies, and Menard is killed by a reanimated Fritz. As the zombies attempt to enter, those being treated for infection inside the hospital also reanimate, killing several hospital staff who have stayed behind. As the dead outside breach the door, Bowles and Hull set the building on fire; the undead Barrett bites Hull but is shot in the head by West. Bowles, West and Hull escape to the boat and leave the island. At the sea, Hull dies of his infection, and his body is locked in a cabin to be used as evidence of what has happened.

Eager to bring the war to a swift conclusion, the British become increasingly frustrated as the Zulu military adopted a Fabian strategy, refusing to engage in a pitched battle; a few skirmishes occurred between British and Zulu scouts with indecisive results. Three Zulu warriors allowed themselves to be captured in a skirmish and are interrogated by the British, but refused to divulge any information and eventually escape, informing their commander of the British dispositions. Halfway to Ulundi, Lord Chelmsford, ordered the British force to make camp at the base of Mount Isandlwana, ignoring the advice of his Boer attendants to fortify the camp and transform his supply wagons into a laager.\nUpon receiving inaccurate reports from his scouts concerning the Zulus' dispositions, Lord Chelmsford leads half the British force on a wild goose chase far from the camp against a phantom Zulu force. The next day, the British camp receives reinforcements led by Colonel Durnford, who dispatches scouts to reconnoiter the surrounding area before leaving the camp to personally scout the region. One of the British scouting parties discovers a Zulu force massing at the bottom of a nearby valley. The Zulu force quickly attacks the British camp, but are initially repulsed; however, they spread out and adopt a strategy of encircling the British, who are eventually pushed back after they run out of ammunition. A massed infantry charge by the Zulu force breaks the British lines, causing them to retreat back towards their camp. Overwhelmed by the attacking Zulus, the British force collapses and is quickly massacred.\nZulu warriors quickly hunt down any British survivors fleeing the battle, while several British soldiers attempt an unsuccessful last stand.
