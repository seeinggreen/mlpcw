He gives life to a creature built by mixing different chemicals, and the monster follows Frankenstein back to his parents' house. The conclusion, completely different from Mary Shelley's book, shows the creature disappearing after seeing its own reflection in the mirror, and without killing Victor's younger brother or his fianc\u00e9e Elizabeth, as happened in the novel.The film's plot description in a 1910 issue of the studio's trade periodical Edison Kinetogram provides considerable detail about the company's screen adaptation:\nFrankenstein, a young student, is seen bidding his sweetheart and father goodbye, as he is leaving home to enter a college in order to study the sciences. Shortly after his arrival at college he becomes absorbed in the mysteries of life and death to the extent of forgetting practically everything else. His great ambition is to create a human being, and finally one night his dream is realized. He is convinced that he has found a way to create a most perfect human being that the world has ever seen. We see his experiment commence and the development of it. The formation of the hideous monster from the blazing chemicals of a huge cauldron in Frankenstein's laboratory is probably the most weird, mystifying and fascinating scene ever shown on a film. To Frankenstein's horror, instead of creating a marvel of physical beauty and grace, there is unfolded before his eyes and before the audience an awful, ghastly, abhorrent monster. As he realizes what he has done Frankenstein rushes from the room, only to have the misshapen monster peer at him through the curtains of his bed. He falls fainting to the floor, where he is found by his servant, who revives him.\n\nAfter a few weeks' illness, he returns home, a broken, weary man, but under the loving care of father and sweetheart he regains his health and strength and begins to take a less morbid view of life. In other words, the story of the film brings out the fact that the creation of the monster was only possible because Frankenstein had allowed his normal mind to be overcome by evil and unnatural thoughts. His marriage is soon to take place. But one evening, while sitting in his library, he chances to glance in the mirror before him and sees the reflection of the monster which has just opened the door of his room. All the terror of the past comes over him and, fearing lest his sweetheart should learn the truth, he bids the monster conceal himself behind the curtain while he hurriedly induces his sweetheart, who then comes in, to stay only a moment. Then follows a strong, dramatic scene. The monster, who is following his creator with the devotion of a dog, is insanely jealous of anyone else. He snatches from Frankenstein's coat the rose which his sweetheart has given him, and in the struggle throws Frankenstein to the floor, here the monster looks up and for the first time confronts his own reflection in the mirror. Appalled and horrified at his own image he flees in terror from the room. Not being able, however, to live apart from his creator, he again comes to the house on the wedding night and, searching for the cause of his jealousy, goes into the bride's room. Frankenstein coming into the main room hears a shriek of terror, which is followed a moment after by his bride rushing in and falling in a faint at his feet. The monster then enters and after overpowering Frankenstein's feeble efforts by a slight exercise of his gigantic strength leaves the house.\n\nHere comes the point which we have endeavored to bring out, namely: That when Frankenstein's love for his bride shall have attained full strength and freedom from impurity it will have such an effect upon his mind that the monster cannot exist. This theory is clearly demonstrated in the next and closing scene, which has probably never been surpassed in anything shown on the moving picture screen. The monster, broken down by his unsuccessful attempts to be with his creator, enters the room, stands before a large mirror and holds out his arms entreatingly. Gradually, the real monster fades away, leaving only the image in the mirror. A moment later Frankenstein himself enters. As he stands directly before the mirror we are amazed to see the image of the monster reflected instead of Frankenstein's own. Gradually, however, under the effect of love and his better nature, the monster's image fades and Frankenstein sees himself in his young manhood in the mirror. His bride joins him, and the film ends with their embrace, Frankenstein's mind now being relieved of the awful horror and weight it has been laboring under for so long.", "tmdb_id": 2929}, "5615055": {"title": "A Fresh Start", "plot": "Though the film is presumed lost, a synopsis survives in The Moving Picture World from September 3, 1910.

The film departs significantly from the original plot, such as in the omission of the double-wedding scene. It begins with Dr Charles Primrose, the vicar of Wakefield, attending a picnic with his landlord Squire Thornhill. The vicar does not like Squire Thornhill, who is reputed to be a degenerate young man, but he has no reservations once he sees Thornhill's interest in his daughter, Olivia. The next scene shows Squire Thornhill convincing Olivia to elope with him, so the two can be married. But Squire Thornhill has no intention of marrying her, and commissions a farmer to arrange a fake wedding ceremony. The farmer accepts, but shakes his fist in anger at the squire after he has departed.Squire Thornhill leaves in a carriage with Olivia, whose departure is soon reported to the rest of the family. Stricken with grief, the vicar heads off to reclaim his wayward daughter. At the end of the marriage ceremony the farmer receives his payment, and the squire and Olivia embrace. The vicar arrives shortly afterwards, but after failing to persuade his daughter to return home with him leaves in despair. Olivia learns later that the marriage was a sham, but continues to live in Thornhill's house until he offers her as a prostitute to an acquaintance of his. Olivia flees in a rage and returns home, where she is reunited with her family. Thornhill, now out for revenge, has the vicar arrested and thrown into jail for unpaid debts.Olivia goes to meet her father in prison, and upon exiting the farmer who had arranged the marriage between Olivia and Thornhill appears and gasps in shock. The vicar explains that Olivia is his daughter, and the farmer reveals his role in the plot, but that out of hatred for Thornhill he procured the services of a real priest to officiate at the wedding. The farmer heads to Thornhill's house and reveals that the marriage was in fact legitimate. Thornhill's uncle, Sir William, forces him to take responsibility for his actions and beg Olivia's forgiveness. Olivia accepts Thornhill's apology and the couple embrace and kiss. Although not in the surviving print, the synopsis concludes with \"Sir William then discloses his identity and asks for the hand of Sophia [another of the vicar's daughters].

Millie plucks the petals off of one to divine whether he loves me... he loves me not.  The girls part ways; Martha's next stop is the vegetable patch in which a lanky farmhand diligently labors with a shovel.  She passes up the farmhand's polite offer to become sweethearts and promptly steals away to town to get her palm read by a woman fortuneteller.  There, a mustachioed gypsy catches her eye, and he tells her a fortune in which he \"plans her future to his liking\".  The pair run off together, crossing a brook into which he saves her from falling.  They arrive at a waterfall where he \"induces her to believe his prophecy must be true\".  After that brief exchange, Martha jubilantly skips home, passing the lanky farmhand who pays her no heed.\nArriving at the homestead, she immediately resolves to return to the waterfall.  At their second meeting, the gypsy greets Martha with open arms and after some animated entreaties she meets his embrace.  In a brief cutaway, Millie looks for Martha at the orchard, but can't find her.  Martha reluctantly bids the gypsy adieu\u2014after she is gone, he laughs and struts confidently.  Martha's stealthy return escapes the notice of Father and Millie who are sitting on the porch of the homestead.  They seem to accept the explanation of her absence when she motions to the second story of the house.  Martha then talks Millie into getting her own fortune read and they slip away, hand in hand, over a rough-hewn fence, through the field of daisies, and into town.  While the fortuneteller is examining Millie's palm, Martha is distracted by one of the townswomen.  The crafty gypsy then swoops in and charms Millie into accompanying him to the romantic waterfall.  When Martha returns to the fortuneteller's tent, Millie is nowhere to be found.\nMillie, in the meantime, has bounced home and back to the waterfall, where the gypsy bids her to sit on a conveniently-placed bench.  Martha wanders back to the waterfall (via the orchard), where she is horrified to find the gypsy with his arm around Millie and observes them long enough to witness him kiss Millie on the cheek.  Heartbroken, Martha returns to the orchard to weep.  To complicate things, Father departs the homestead and his route takes him by the waterfall where he discovers his daughter in close personal contact with the gypsy.  In a fit of rage, the old man tears the gypsy from his daughter and reproves him wildly.  Father raises his cane to strike the gypsy, but the gypsy impulsively fells him with a two quick blows to the torso.  Aghast at what he's done, the gypsy escapes just as two passersby arrive on the scene.\nThe gypsy flees through the field of daisies as a growing mob of farmhands set out looking for him.  After passing through an overgrown field and over the brook, the gypsy arrives at the orchard.  Martha, unaware of his wrongdoing, yields to his pleading and successfully conceals him in a barrel underneath potatoes she empties out of a bushel basket.  After the farmhand posse passes, and just as Father is recovering with the help of Millie and a passerby at the waterfall, the gypsy emerges from the barrel and bids the jilted Martha a hasty and perfunctory farewell.  The posse eventually catch up with the gypsy back at the fortuneteller's wagon, where they warn him in no uncertain terms to leave town, which he does with a bindle over his shoulder.  The dejected Martha, sitting on some wooden steps leading up from the road, looks up to find the posse marching the gypsy out of town.  She wanders off to the vegetable patch where she finds solace in the arms of the lanky farmhand she had rejected earlier.
