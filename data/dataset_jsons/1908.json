A large crowd, including a Salvation Army brass band, sees off the six racecars, including a De Dion-Bouton driven by Georges Bourcier de Saint-Chaffray, a Motobloc, a steam automobile, and even a kitchen on wheels, where a black visitor is hurried out before the race begins. The cars speed over the precipices of the Rocky Mountains, where they navigate a rickety bridge over a torrent; though the De Dion-Bouton speeds easily over the bridge, it breaks under the weight of the next car, hurling it into the water. The other four cars, going too fast to be able to stop, follow it over the precipice. The De Dion-Bouton, now alone, continues its journey as far as the plains of California, where it suffers a breakdown just as it is being attacked by a group of Iroquois. The abducted travelers, about to be scalped, escape by getting their captors drunk on gasoline. They regain their car only to realize that, having used up their gasoline in the ruse, they cannot start the engine. Taking some feathered Iroquois headdresses to use as sails, they convert the automobile into a sail wagon and travel on the wind.\nThe weather gets worse, and a cyclone carries the car into the sky. It flies over Canada and finally makes a crash landing on a frozen Alaska river. Finding a horse to pull the car, they reach a gold mining camp. In welcome, the miners take them on a tour of a glittering mine and give them two boxes of gold. The travelers set off again with sled dogs pulling their car. They make it as far as the Bering Strait before the dogs are tired out and can go no further. An ice avalanche sends the car into the sea, where a whale accidentally swallows it. The whale spits out the car on an ice field, where the travelers see a pack of polar bears approaching. Just when an attack seems imminent, it becomes clear that the bears come in peace, thinking the fur-covered travelers are bears as well. Humans and bears exchange hearty handshakes and conversation, until they notice that the airship Patrie is being blown toward them by the strong wind. The travelers make a dash for the airship, managing to fasten one of its guide ropes to the car.\nThe airship carries the car to Siberia, where some poor serfs agree to pull the car over the ice. They pass through villages, where the travelers are greeted with welcome, vodka, and displays of ice skating. Reaching Germany, the travelers are still unable to make their car work, and call upon a caravan of Romani people to pull it onward for a while. At last, their car in shambles, carried along by a Paris coachman's nag, they reach the finish line at the Place de la Concorde, where the police chief Louis L\u00e9pine and the President of France have arrived to greet them. The travelers, distributing their souvenirs of the journey to the crowd, are carried in triumph through the streets of Paris.", "tmdb_plot": "", "tmdb_id": "372941", "wiki_id": "56749757"}, {"title": "The Red Girl", "genres": ["Action"], "wiki_plot": "An Indian girl helps a Mexican woman who has stolen a bag of gold nuggets belonging to a girl miner.
