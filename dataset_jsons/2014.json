Meanwhile, on the planet Tatooine, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher live with their parents as contented moisture farmers. Darth Vader's Star Destroyer intercepts Leia's ship, forcing her to load the disc into R2-D2, but she is observed by a trio of Imperial stormtroopers, including Candace Flynn. Candace attempts to report the actions of the Rebels to the empire but is put down by her commanding officer. After seeing R2-D2 and C-3PO entering an escape pod, the trio decide to pursue them in a second escape pod and prove their worth by recapturing the lost plans, with Perry secretly hitching a ride with them.\nElsewhere, Darthenshmirtz arrives with his robotic underling Norm-3P0 at the Death Star. He reveals that he has a new invention that is even more evil, but that requires the Force to power it. Candace and her companions are on the trail of the droids until their commander sends them into Mos Eisley. Perry continues trailing the droids as they are seized by Jawas and sold to Owen Lars, and eventually absconds with R2-D2. They run into Phineas and Ferb on their way to Obi-Wan Kenobi's, whom Phineas and Ferb are acquainted with as he has given them instruction in the Jedi arts. Despite their offer of a ride, R2-D2 continues on his own while Perry remains unseen by the duo, unaware that their collision has resulted in the Death Star disc remaining in the back seat of Phineas and Ferb's speeder.\nUpon discovering the disc, Phineas and Ferb set out to return it to R2-D2, which takes them to Mos Eisley where they encounter Watto's son Blatto. With Blatto's help they discover that the disc contains the Death Star plans, and they are pursued after being spotted by Candace's trio. The brothers just miss R2-D2 departing with Luke, Obi-Wan, C-3PO, Han Solo, and Chewbacca aboard the Millennium Falcon. Determined to return the disc, the pair travel to the Mos Eisley cantina and are introduced to Isabella Garcia-Shapiro, captain of the Centennial Chihuahua and an rival of Han Solo's. Isabella agrees to transport them; meanwhile, Candace returns to the Death Star. Meanwhile, aboard the Death Star, Darthenshmirtz learns that he can extract Force energy from Darth Vader's trash just before the planet Alderaan is destroyed. The Chihuahua catches up to the Millennium Falcon, but both end up caught in a tractor beam; the Chihuahua is freed after Phineas and Ferb modify the ship so that it can take on the appearance of a doughnut-selling spaceship.\nOnce aboard the Death Star, Phineas and Ferb are surprised and delighted to run into Perry, who was their pet before they discovered him to be a rebel agent, an event that initially upset them but that they have come to terms with. Perry makes his way to Darthenshmirtz's lair, only to end up encased in carbonite and left helpless as Darthenshmirtz unveils his new Sith-inator, a machine that will make him a Sith Lord even more evil than Vader. Ferb, sensing through the Force that Perry is in danger, leaves Phineas and Isabella to go to his aid, unknowingly passing Obi-Wan Kenobi on the way. He then knocks Perry's carbonite slab out of the way of a blast from the Sith-inator only to be hit himself, which begins his transformation into a Sith by giving him yellow irises (identical to Anakin Skywalker's transformation in Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith). Elsewhere, Isabella and Phineas run into Candace, who pursues them, only to be saved from a fatal fall by Phineas, which causes her to rethink her stance on the Rebels. Darthenshmirtz is then attacked by a freed Perry, while Phineas gives Isabella the Death Star disc to take to the Rebels while he goes looking for Ferb.\nEntering Darthenshmirtz's lair, Phineas discovers an upgraded Sith-inator and Ferb, who has taken on an appearance similar to that of Darth Maul. Upon learning that his brother intends to create an army of Sith and rule the dark side, Phineas reluctantly confronts him in a lightsaber duel, in which both of them upgrade their lightsabers to possess multiple blades. Isabella travels to Yavin and delivers the Death Star plans, but despite the appeals of the Firestar Girls (Rebel versions of the Fireside Girls) refuses to join the Rebel Alliance. She changes her mind after a tense conversation with Han and Chewbacca, also convincing him to return to the rebels to help Luke; back on the Death Star, Candace and her two comrades likewise decide to join the rebellion. The battles between Perry and Darthenshmirtz and Phineas and Ferb continue and intersect, until Candace comes to Phineas' aid. Together they manage to destroy the Sith-inator, which restores Ferb to normal, and the trio-along with Baljeet and Buford-depart to get to the bus that brought the stormtroopers to the Death Star, but it leaves before they can get on it. Perry also leaves with a carbonite-encased Darthenshmirtz, while the rebels begin their attack on the Death Star.\nLeft stranded on the doomed battle station, Candace learns that Phineas is her baby brother and that their mother remarried, making Ferb their stepbrother. Before Phineas can expound on the subject, the Death Star detonates (a nod to the creator's decision not to touch on the history of who Phineas' father is). Fortunately, Isabella returns in the nick of time and saves the group, while the Firestar Girls rescue all of the civilian personnel from the Death Star.

While filming near the India-Pakistan border, the crew encounters Indian police officers patrolling the area. After the American director unsuccessfully argues that he has obtained official permission to film anywhere in Rajasthan, Sunny entertains the chief officer and plays to his desire to be exalted and filmed. Impressed and in a happy mood, the officer allows the crew to continue their work.\nLater in the night, as Sunny is busy changing the tire of his car, the rest of the crew leaves in another vehicle. On his drive back, he encounters a cyclist lying on the road and checks him out, but soon realizes from the shadows that it's a ruse. A terrorist Muslim Jihadist group kidnaps him and brings him and his camera equipment to Pakistan. The group leader is disappointed that their original plan to kidnap an American crew-member didn't occur. He says that holding an American hostage would force the government to meet his demands to avoid international backlash, but an Indian hostage would be worthless. He instructs Mehmood and Jawaad to keep him hostage in a village while the others attempt another kidnapping.\nSunny wakes up to find himself in an unfamiliar house. He demands to be let go, but after Mehmood gives him the opportunity to walk out, he stays realizing they will kill him if he did. The house where he is confined belongs to Aftaab, a Pakistani Muslim whose trade stems from pirated Hindi films, which he brings back every time he crosses the border. Aftaab gets enamored by Sunny's camera equipment as he too loves movies. Aftaab plays Sunny's favorite film Maine Pyaar Kiya from a pirated DVD for the villagers to watch. Sunny wants to watch it too, but Mehmood doesn't allow him to leave. Sunny loudly mimics the dialogues of the film in his room and this forces Mehmood to let him join the villagers and watch it.

He gathers the village children and entertains them with mimicry of how Bollywood actors would shoot their guns. Mehmood and Jawaad sneak up on him thinking he is attempting to escape. Though Mehmood has a clear shot to kill Sunny, he realizes that Sunny is just entertaining the kids but shoots a bullet to graze Sunny's arm to teach him a lesson.

Sunny tells him that he reminds him of his grandfather who also wanted to visit Lahore as he once could.\nAfter learning that India is playing against Pakistan in a cricket match, Sunny makes a deal with Mehmood that he would allow him to leave if India wins. The villagers gathered around a truck's radio to hear the match. Though it appeared that Pakistan had a chance, India wins with a six-run hit.

Aftaab hopes that Pakistan's Lollywood would also make similar blockbuster movies that Bollywood wants to copy, instead of the B-movies it currently makes.\nAftaab promises to help Sunny escape with his knowledge of the border. They devise a plan where they will invite men of the village to audition for a movie. While shooting a scene for the movie, they enact an escape scene together, raising suspicion of Mehmood but soon dispelling it when they returned.

But later he realizes it is Sunny's watch and Sunny had escaped in a burqa.\nAftaab and Sunny attempt to escape on a motorbike but are soon stopped by Mehmood. He locks both of them up after Aftaab promises to help Sunny escape as long as he is alive, and questions why people like Mehmood are destroying Pakistan in the name of Allah.

He reluctantly agrees realizing that the village could turn against them if he didn't oblige.\nMehmood and Jawaad bring Aftaab and Sunny to a barren land near the border. Mehmood stops the vehicle and claiming that he has orders, he prepares to kill Aftaab and Sunny. However, Jawaad disbelieving him points his gun at Mehmood.

Elliot receives a mysterious phone call that offers him $1,000 to assertively kill a fly that has been harassing him.  After Elliot checks his bank account online and sees that he has been credited, he accepts the next challenge: to eat the dead fly.  The caller explains that he will be offered a series of thirteen challenges, each of which will result in greater rewards.  If he fails to complete any of them, interferes in the game, or reveals the game, he will forfeit all the money, including any he already won.\nThe next few challenges attract police attention: making a young girl cry, arson, and scamming a homeless person with an ostrich.  When the child identifies Elliot in the police station based on wanted posters, Detective Chilcoat takes over the case.  Shelby becomes concerned about Elliot's secretive and odd behavior, and he explains that he is planning a surprise.  For his sixth challenge, Elliot is forced to take a corpse of a man who committed suicide out for coffee.  Given a strict deadline, Elliot panics and brazenly steals a cup of coffee from a table of on-duty police officers. When confronted, Elliot notices that they are drinking alcohol and threatens to file a complaint which forces them to back off. Elliot is rewarded two challenge completions for this feat.\nAfter he flees the scene, the caller tells Elliot that he has left behind his library card as evidence; however, if he wins the game, his record will be purged.  At the same time, Chilcoat follows Vogler, a conspiracy theorist that has been investigating the game. Paranoid, Vogler flees Chilcoat but advises him to kill Elliot at his first opportunity. Chilcoat eventually tracks down Vogler at a bar and discuss that the game's sole purpose is turning players into monstrosities at the promise of millions of dollars. Vogler states his wife once played the game, resulting in her eating their dog. For his next challenge, Elliot receives no instructions and is taken to a rural motel.  There, a man identifies himself as a former childhood bully, and the caller tells Elliot to sever the man's arm.  Elliot initially refuses but does so once the man taunts him.  After driving the man to the hospital, Elliot beats the man's brother with a chair as revenge for him bullying Elliot and Michael, including urinating in Michael\u2019s face. As a result, he is credited with two more completed challenges.\nWhen the police arrive at the banquet hall where Elliot and Shelby are having their rehearsal dinner, Elliot is surprised to discover that they are interested in Michael, who says he revealed himself to a young woman partially due to his medication being cut off. To give Michael time to escape, he accepts his next challenge, to destroy the banquet hall while singing The Internationale.  Disappointed in his reluctance to break social norms, the caller then instructs Elliot to surrender to the police, from whom Elliot learns that another person has been playing the game while committing other acts such as pushing an elder down the stairs and burning down an entire shrine.  Elliot takes and accidentally wounds a hostage to escape and complete the game before the other competitor. As he escapes, he's forced to leave behind his cell phone.  Desperate, he takes an old woman hostage when she shows up, sure that she is involved in his next challenge.\nAfter feigning ignorance, the old woman reveals his next challenge: to set a stainless steel wire across the road.  Elliot is horrified when he realizes that a group of bikers have been instructed to speed down the road.  Although he disarms the trap in time, the other competitor arms a similar trap down the road, and the cyclists are decapitated.  Disgusted and mortified, Elliot quits the game, tossing the phone away before he's told the last challenge and, when he returns home, discovers that Michael is the other competitor.  Michael reveals that the final challenge is to kill a family member.

To prevent his sons from experiencing the horror of losing everything closest to them from winning the game, Samson slices his neck and commits suicide.\nHowever, Michael refuses to stop playing the game and attempts to kill Elliot.  Elliot kills Michael in self-defense, though he is stabbed multiple times.

The unit provides support for the Royal Ulster Constabulary as it inspects homes for firearms, shocking Hook with their rough treatment of Catholic civilians. A crowd gathers to protest against the search; the soldiers, who were ordered to leave riot gear behind, are ordered to keep the crowd back, but the latter turn violent when the RUC start beating homeowners in the street.\nOne soldier is hit by a rock and drops his L1A1 rifle to the ground. In the confusion, a young boy seizes it and runs off through the mob. Hook and another soldier, Thompson, pursue him. As the crowd's protest escalates, the soldiers and police pull out, leaving the two soldiers behind. Hook and Thompson are severely beaten and disarmed by a mob, until a sympathetic woman manages to calm things down. However, Thompson is suddenly shot dead at point-blank range by a Provisional IRA gunman, Paul Haggerty. Hook flees through streets and back alleys and hides in an outhouse until dark.\nAfter Hook leaves, he wanders into the Shankill Estate. A foul-mouthed Protestant youngster takes Hook to a local pub that serves as a front for Loyalists. There, Hook glimpses a Loyalist group in a back room constructing a bomb under the guidance of Sergeant Lewis, a member of the Military Reaction Force (MRF), the British Army's covert counter-insurgency unit. Hook steps outside the pub just before an enormous explosion destroys the building, killing or injuring many of those inside, including the young boy who brought him there. Unaware that the Loyalist bombers have blown themselves up accidentally, the Provisional IRA and Official IRA factions accuse each other of being responsible for the bombing.\nHook staggers away and again gets lost in the streets, eventually collapsing.

Eamon, a former army medic, stitches Hook's wounds. Despite the Provisional IRA having recently taken control of the area from the OIRA, Eamon contacts senior OIRA officer Boyle for help, expecting a more humane solution than the Provisional IRA faction would allow. Boyle, less radical and violent than the younger Provisional IRA members, tells Captain Browning, leader of the local MRF section, of Hook's whereabouts and asks in return that Browning kill James Quinn, a key leader of the younger Provisional IRA faction.\nQuinn and his squad have tailed Boyle since the pub explosion and saw him visit Eamon's flat without knowing why he was there. Sensing danger, Hook flees the flat, taking a large knife he finds in a bag. Hook eludes Quinn's men but, unable to evade Haggerty, stabs and kills him. Quinn's group captures Hook and takes him to a hideout. Quinn orders Sean, the young boy who, in the early neighbourhood persecution, had hesitated to kill Hook, to murder him. When Sean hesitates, Quinn prepares to execute Hook, only to leave when Browning's group arrives. Sergeant Lewis of Browning's group shoots Sean, to Hook's horror. Lewis then attempts to strangle Hook to prevent him from informing others about the bomb. As Lieutenant Armitage and his men enter in support of Browning, Armitage sees Lewis's attempt to kill Hook.

He led only 12 ships, which remained in his command, to a heroic victory against an invading Japanese fleet of 333 vessels.At the onset of the battle at their base in Haenam, the Japanese invaders under T\u014dd\u014d Takatora are confident that their planned expedition to Hansong to capture King Seonjo will meet with success. However, they remain reserved over the news that Joseon's greatest admiral, Yi Sun-sin, has been restored to his former command after the disaster at Chilcheollyang, which has reduced the Korean navy to a mere dozen battle-ready ships. To ensure the success of the operation, Hideyoshi sends one of his finest naval war leaders to Joseon, Kurushima Michifusa, the commander of the Murakami Clan Navy who is an expert in naval combat but enjoys a shaky reputation among his fellow daimy\u014d as a pirate. One of the admirals of the Japanese Left Army, Wakizaka, first meets Kurushima and his lieutenant, Kimura, while he finishes off the remnants of a group of Joseon soldiers. He especially distrusts Kurushima and draws his sword on him several times, especially after the latter insults him by shaming his defeat at Hansan Island. Later, Kurushima and Haru, his sharpshooter, drink sake as Kurushima elaborates on his personal vendetta against Yi Sun-sin, stating that his brother Michiyuki had been killed by the latter earlier in the war.\nIn the meantime, Yi Sun-sin is facing the despair mounting among his officers and troops. Facing an enemy force that far outnumbers them and seeing no reasonable chance of success in the inevitable clash even with one single turtle ship remaining, many consider the fight lost before it has even started. Despite his outwardly indifferent demeanor, Yi is hard-pressed to maintain morale among his men and desperate to find a solution for his problem. However, the breaking point seems reached when General Bae Seol, the deserter of Chilcheollyang, burns the turtle ship and has his men try to assassinate Yi. Although Yi escapes and Bae is killed for his act of treachery, the ship is lost, which boosts confidence among the Japanese and further dispirits Yi's troops. To seek an answer, Yi travels to the Myeongnyang Strait, an area notorious for its strong and treacherous currents, which the Japanese intend to cross on their way to Hansong. Later, he confides in his son Hoe that to win the fight, he must turn the fear paralyzing his men into courage.\nUpon hearing that the departure of the Japanese attack fleet is imminent, Yi abandons his base and moves to Usuyeong after burning the naval facilities to the ground. The next morning, Yi's fleet arrives in the strait and is shortly met by the Japanese, who are using the morning tide to move into the channel, with Kurushima leading the vanguard. Yi engages Kurushima's fleet in battle, but as the other Korean commanders are still hesitant to involve themselves, Yi's flagship is quickly surrounded and attacked by boarding parties. In the apparently hopeless situation, Yi commands several cannons to be fired from the rower deck's port hatches in a concentrated volley, to use their recoil to blast the ship free of its encirclement. As Yi had hoped, this bold act of survival inspires the rest of his countrymen to take the fight to the enemy.\nWhen the tide turns and forms a whirlpool in the middle of the channel, thus solidifying Yi's defensive position, Kurushima orders an all-out attack with the rest of his ships. Despite the efforts of Haru and a ship loaded with black powder charges, the renewed courage of the Koreans prevails, though heavy sacrifices are made. Kurushima's desperate situation is observed by Todo, who merely laughs at Kat\u014d's suggestion of reinforcing him.

Defensive satellites are thought to protect Earth from a second invasion. In 2033, two embedded journalists accompany reinforcements to a demilitarised zone between Pakistan and Afghanistan, where Outpost 37, one of the last USDF outposts in the region, is located. After a hazing period, the reinforcements settle into life at the outpost.\nLocal villagers assault the outpost, and a soldier explains they had no problems until recently when he believes that the continued violation of their sovereignty has soured relations. Although the soldiers are victorious over the villagers, one soldier is wounded and sent off to recuperate. Their requests for supplies are denied, but they receive a replacement for the injured soldier in the form of Hans, a German national who volunteers to serve with the primarily American group. Later, Saleem, a loyal local to Outpost 37 after they rescued him, reports that villagers complain of animal mutilations. The captain sends several soldiers back with Saleem to determine the cause.\nAn angry villager says mortar fire killed his animals, but the soldiers deny this. As Saleem translates for them, a seemingly dazed villager approaches despite the warnings. He explodes when the herder speaks to him. A Heavy opens fire from a hill above them, and the soldiers fall back. Saleem notices that North, one of the soldiers, is missing, and they mount an unsuccessful search. Video evidence from North's recovered helmet reveals that the Heavies abducted him.

Unable to mount their own rescue mission, they deploy a drone and, during routine reconnaissance, discover that Saleem is in danger. They disobey their orders to save him and take a Heavy prisoner in the process. The captain is furious when he returns; he executes the Heavy and demands they cease their attempts to save North, an action that violates orders. Saleem volunteers to help. When he visits the base, Saleem seems dazed and uncommunicative. He opens fire on the soldiers and kills one before the captain kills him. In interviews, the soldiers express shock that Saleem would betray them. Omohundro, the medic, discovers an incision at the back of Saleem's head.\nTo find answers, the soldiers leave for Saleem's village. There, they discover North, near-unconscious and wounded. They take him back to the base, where he falls into a coma. One of the soldiers recognises his rhythmic blinking as a code, and they translate it as a series of coordinates. When they attempt to question North, he wakes and chokes the captain, hysterically demanding that the captain kill him; he does. Omohundro discovers an incision at the back of his head and recovers an implant, which he suspects may have been a mind-control device.

Shortly after Henriette begins to suffer from spasms and fainting fits.\nHeinrich continues to visit with Henriette during her illness and finds her life mediocre and conventional as she will not even allow him to visit her alone in order not to raise gossip. He continues to hope that she will consent to die with him.\nFor a while Henriette's doctor cannot find the cause of her illness which he assures her is likely not serious. However, after sending samples of her urine and her medical file away for a second opinion he learns that she has a fatal tumour that will kill her before long. After learning of the news Henriette calls Heinrich to her home where she allows him to be alone with her for the first time. She tells him she is dying and admits that now she feels alone and unloved just as he described her. She tells him that she would like to enter into the suicide pact with him. Heinrich receives the news rather coldly telling Henriette he hoped that he would meet someone who was willing to die because he wanted to die and not for her own reasons. Reluctantly Heinrich and Henriette head off into the country together hoping to complete their pact.

The trip is a failure and the two return home.\nHeinrich then goes to visit his cousin Marie again who has returned from Paris newly engaged.

She agrees.\nMeanwhile, Henriette's husband, Vogel, returning from a trip to Paris tells Henriette that he showed her file to another doctor who believes she might not have a tumour after all. He asks her to accompany him to Paris where she can receive more advanced medical treatment. Noticing how close Henriette has become to Heinrich he also tells her that he would respect her choice if she decided to leave him for Heinrich. Henriette dismisses the idea calling Heinrich selfish.\nHeinrich arrives at the Vogel house in order to usher Henriette away so they can die together. Henriette is reluctant to go but Vogel insists that the exercise and fresh air will be good for her. They tell Heinrich that there is a possibility that Henriette will live as they are planning to go to Paris to see another doctor.\nHeinrich and Henriette go off together and stay the night at an inn where Heinrich reads a poem to Henriette and apologizes for ever doubting her. The next day they head off into the woods. Henriette begins to tell Heinrich that she had something to say the previous day but before she can finish her thought he shoots and kills her. Preparing to shoot himself in the head he fires twice only to have the gun not function both times.\nAfter learning of the death of his wife Vogel searches his desk for a letter and eventually finds the note that Henriette wrote to him before her first planned suicide attempt hidden in a drawer.

One policeman in the station named Sarathy (Vaibhav Reddy), decides to help her realizing that she was coming here for a huge reason; and the search for her missing husband begins. She goes to the hotel where her husband last stayed. The hotel manager is insistent that her husband had never stayed there. She proves that he did by discussing the state of a particular room in detail, based only on the description Ajay had given her. While staying there, she makes the acquaintance of a little boy named Raju who familiarises her with the local area.\nShe goes to places with Sarathy in search of her husband. She visits the local branch of the company for whom her husband worked. From the HR manager, she finds out that her husband had resigned two weeks prior to her coming to Hyderabad. Sarathy arrives at the branch and Anaamika informs him of her discovery.\nOn the morning of the next day, Raju is helping Anaamika in the hotel. He recognises a photo of Ajay and tells her that Ajay did indeed stay at the hotel. Anaamika learns from Raju that ten days prior, he saw Ajay being kidnapped by four goons. She informs the police of this and upon returning to the hotel, the manager presents her with Ajay's clothes. The manager said that he misled her in order to protect the reputation of his hotel. Raju and Sarathy then head to the police station so that Raju can try to identify the goons from a line-up - though this is unsuccessful. Later, Sarathy and Anaamika visit a mortuary where Anaamika confirms that an unidentified body held there is not Ajay. In the evening, Anaamika and Sarathy visit a Durga pooja where a set of bangles and a dress are blessed. Sarathy promises to take Anaamika to an informant the next morning.\nAfter some difficulty, they find the informant who informs them that some students of the local Imam were discussing a kidnapping a few days ago. Sarathy and Anaamika then head to find the Imam. The Imam refuses Sarathy the opportunity to speak to his students, citing the effect such questioning will have on them. The Imam laments the negative opinion that many in the area seem to have towards madrassas. Despite Anaamika's pleas, the Imam says that he can only pray for her. They both return to Anaamika's hotel where Anaamika is consumed with grief. At the same time, the Imam feels that he can't ignore her pleas and telephones Sarathy. Sarathy learns that a wedding is to take place the next day with most of the Imam's students due in attendance.

Anaamika is to meet the kidnappers at midnight on the Clock Tower bridge. As Anaamika prepares for this meeting, Sarathy continues investigating. He finds the family of a kidnapper with Raju's help. The kidnapper's sister suspects a Datasoft employee coerced her brother into the crime and Sarathy brings her to Datasoft. There she identifies an employee, Laxman, and Sarathy heads to his home. There, Sarathy finds the same photo the Imam had in the album.\nFinally, midnight arrives and Anaamika meets the kidnappers. Police have surrounded the bridge, though Anaamika is unaware of this.

In the present day, game executive Mandi (Sarah Glendening) of Cockburn Industries, Inc. proposes to her bosses creating an intentionally bad sequel, EeeTee 2. Thanks to the popularity and success of the Angry Video Game Nerd, sales of poorly made video games have increased dramatically, and a review of EeeTee 2 by the Nerd would drive his fans to buy the game.\nThe Nerd (James Rolfe) and his sidekick Cooper Folly (Jeremy Suarez) are working on a video game review. The Nerd has become disheartened over the years, as his fans continue to buy and play the games he reviews and warns people to stay away from. On top of this, the Nerd must promote and sell bad video games as part of his job at GameCops. When he discovers marketing for EeeTee 2, his fans encourage him to review ET, something he has stood against for years because the game scarred him as a child. After some personal thought, the Nerd decides to go to Alamogordo to debunk the conspiracy theory surrounding the buried cartridges, promising to review the game if the theory proves to be true. He is accompanied by Cooper and Mandi, and the trip is completely funded by Cockburn Industries.\nWhile filming their expedition, Cooper reveals that he believes in a super-being known as Death Mwauthzyx, who has the power to destroy all existence. Sergeant McButter (Helena Barrett) and the legless General Dark Onward (Stephen Mendel), thinking the trio is looking for extraterrestrials, attempt to capture them. Onward accidentally blows his right arm off with a grenade, giving the trio enough time to escape.\nThe Nerd, Cooper and Mandi search for the creator of ET, Howard Scott Warshaw, for answers. They instead stumble across the home of Dr. Zandor (Time Winters), who tells them that ET's level design is an exact map of Area 51. Dr. Zandor gave the code to Warshaw to help him meet the five-week deadline Atari set for ET's completion, and to exact revenge on the government for kidnapping and holding hostage an alien he was attempting to free. The government ordered the burial of the cartridges, while Zandor escaped with the metallic material Area 51 was researching at the time in an attempt to reassemble the alien's spaceship, replacing it with tin foil. Mandi is captured by McButter while wandering outside of the house. The Nerd and Cooper, believing she is a double agent, do not go after her.\nGoing back to the Alamogordo site, the Nerd and Cooper discover a large crowd of fans and the head of Cockburn Industries promoting the release of ET 2 with the promise of digging out a copy of the original ET from the site. The Nerd tells his fans there are no cartridges buried there, but Warshaw himself appears and tells fans the opposite. Annoyed, the Nerd breaks into Area 51 disguised as an alien. He is captured, and General Onward attempts to force him to play ET. Onward launches a missile at Mount Fuji, the basis for the Atari logo, and while leaving the room, gets his left arm cut off in the door. During the launch countdown, an alien resembling the one in ET grabs the Nerd and pulls him to safety.\nThe destruction of Mount Fuji releases Death Mwauthzyx, who was trapped inside the mountain. Meanwhile, Mandi keeps McButter away from the Nerd and Cooper's location, eventually leading them to a confrontation on the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas.\nThe Nerd and alien escape in a fighter jet similar to one in the NES Top Gun video game, while the alien reveals Death Mwauthzyx can destroy all existence by turning the satellite dish on his head. Cooper is captured by Death Mwauthzyx and brought to Las Vegas, where Mandi knocks McButter off the Eiffel Tower to her death. Mandi is also captured by Death Mwauthzyx.

A smashing noise is heard upstairs and Hiroshi goes up to check by himself.\nExcept Shun, they all receive unknown calls simultaneously, but no one is speaking. It is shown that the signals are gone. Right afterwards, something seems to pass them in the next room. Takeshi becomes paranoid and starts running around the house to hide. Shun encounters Anna and they move together to find a way out, while Shun points out that he feels that he has seen that something before but can't remember.\nTakuro and Mika open the door to the basement, then Takuro goes down, while Mika waits upstairs. Hearing something, Mika checks on the room next door and notices an opening, where she looks directly into a very big eye. Terrified, Mika runs away and is found by Hiroshi. They both check around and find Takeshi hiding in a cupboard. Takeshi mumbles about Naoki's death, but is cut-off by Mika, saying that he will be killed by Takuro as he talks about it again. Takeshi refuses to move, so Hiroshi suggests that he stays there and they will pick him up when they find the way out.\nAs Hiroshi and Mika go out of the room, they meet up with Anna and Shun. Mika questions Anna's presence, but Hiroshi diverts the questions. They then go together to check around the house. Meanwhile, Takeshi gets a phone call, but no response from the other end. He then hears Takuro calling him from outside the cupboard, so he opens the door as a big blue hand grabs his head. The group hears Takeshi's scream and come back to check on him.\nAs they reach the room, they see the door open and Takeshi, bleeding, is thrown out. He asks for help before being dragged back, and the door closes. As the group enters the room, they finds Takeshi's dismembered body. Anna and Hiroshi pressure Mika about Takuro's whereabouts and about Naoki, but Mika refuses to tell them and runs away, chased by Hiroshi. Anna confronts Shun who describes that this event is the same as the game he created.\nMika goes back to Takuro and begs him to leave immediately, which he takes lightly. Mika then goes to Takuro and seemingly seduces him just to steal his keys for the house. Takuro ignores her and continues on with his work. Mika rushes to the main door, but the key doesn't seem to work. As she hears noises, she goes to check and encounters the Blue Demon, which then kills Mika.\nWith Shun's knowledge of the game, they continue on finding the keys and items to move forward inside the house. They eventually reach a room with a blood-stained piano. As they observe the piano, Mika is heard calling Shun through the door. Anna stops him from opening the door, saying that Mika will not call him. Shun is puzzled as the door gets smashed and the Blue Demon is seen. The Blue Demon enters the room, so the two flee. Shun goes to a room with chained drawers locked with number combinations. He manages to grab the handkerchief as the Blue Demon enters from another door. They run away to go back to the piano room. Shun says that they have to use the handkerchief to wipe off the blood for the combinations of a safe.\nAs they outrun the Blue Demon, Anna is stunned upon seeing the remains of Mika. As they sit and calm themselves, Anna talks about her brother Naoki, the same boy who was killed in a traffic accident, as mentioned in the beginning of the film. The accident was called suicide with the assumption of his inability to withstand bullying. Anna refers to how Shun is similar to her brother. The door then opens as Hiroshi is seen standing on the door. They then go to the piano room, then retrieve the code to get the key to eventually reach the basement.\nAs they reach the basement, they find that it has been opened by Takuro. As they go down, Takuro strikes Hiroshi, rendering him unconscious. Anna confronts Takuro and believes that Takuro is responsible for killing her brother, which he lightly denies. As Anna begins mentioning Shun's name, he gets annoyed. Puzzled by the conversation, Shun reaches the box Takuro carried and opens it, revealing his own lifeless body inside.\nShun then realizes how the group, except Anna, has been ignoring him the whole time, how Takeshi got so scared when Shun was with him (for Takeshi cannot see Shun), and why Anna said Mika will not call him, because he is already dead and cannot be seen by everyone, except Anna. He then flashbacks to the time Takuro bullied him in the riverbank. Takuro hit Shun in the head, killing him. It is then revealed that Takuro went to the empty house to hide Shun's body. Takuro then explained that Shun used Takuro's name in the game and got mad. Shun is terrified with the truth and finally disappears as Anna apologizes to him.\nTakuro plans on killing Anna since she knows too much, but suddenly gets caught by the Blue Demon, and is eaten off-screen. Anna then wakes Hiroshi up, and they both flee. The Blue Demon notices them and chases after them. Hiroshi, knowing that he can't move so easily and will slow Anna down, insists on staying to buy Anna some time to escape. The Blue Demon stomps on him as it chases Anna. Anna finally reaches the same room she was in as in the beginning of the movie, but instead of her brother, Shun is calling her from the door. Anna, confused about what to do next, opens the door into the shining light, where she is greeted by Shun.\nThe scene goes back to the river, as Shun asks Anna whether she is okay. Shun then explains about the dynamics of the game as Anna notices his scar and holds his hand, telling him to speak whatever troubles him to her, as she can't help her brother and hopes that the same thing will not happen to Shun. Shun replies by holding Anna's hand back, with the screen on the laptop says that they've cleared the game.", "tmdb_plot": "Shun is a transfer student who can't seem to adjust to his new class and falls into mild depression.

The pair, along with their late elder brother's son Murali and his new wife Madhavi, have gathered to sell their palace off to Ayyanar. Meanwhile, Paalsamy sneaks into palace under the guise of a cook, to find a photo that is the sole evidence that he is also an heir to the palace, so he can claim his share of the money.\nStrange events begin to happen during their stay at the palace. Madhavi sees a servant's daughter talking to a mysterious girl called Selvi who no one else can see. The girl's mother explains that she is mentally impaired. Mishaps continue to happen, delaying the sale of the palace and the family extend their stay. Meanwhile, two other servants have also gone missing. Now Ravi, Madhavi's elder brother, comes to the palace to meet his sister. Later, Madhavi and Maya tell Ravi of the strange happenings, so Ravi sets cameras up around the palance with Maya's help.\nWhile watching the camera feed, Ravi sees a worker backing away from something, but the camera's feed suddenly dies.

Ravi is shocked and visits the fortune teller, who reveals he witnessed a worker being killed by a woman possessed by a vengeful spirit. The fortune teller gives him an egg and tells that when the possessed person is near the egg, it will start spinning. To Ravi's horror, the egg reacts to Madhavi.\nSince the little girl always speaks of a woman named Selvi, Ravi sets out to investigate. Ayyanar becomes angry when mentioned about Selvi, who stole the temple's jewels and ran away from the village. However, Selvi's friend Ramya tells Ravi that Selvi was a good person and not a thief.\nA few years back, prior to his marriage, Murali came to the village and fell in love with Selvi. Selvi also liked him, but she is a girl who is often possessed by the goddess and predicts the future. Wishing to maintain her holiness, and wary of the difference in their statuses and lifestyles, she is reluctant to accept his confession. On the day Murali planned to leave the village, he asked her to meet him at the palace if she wanted to leave with him. With Ramya's encouragement, Selvi leaves to confess her love to Murali, but disappeared before reaching him.\nAs per Ravi's plan, Ramya comes to meet the possessed Madhavi. Selvi, recognising Ramya, tells her all that happened that day. It had been Ayyanar and his friends who had stolen and replaced the temple jewellery with fakes. When Selvi had touched one of the fakes, she received a premonition, and confronted the culprits. When they attacked her, she fled to Murali, but narrowly misses him. Ayyanar and his accomplices, the dead servants, killed and buried her inside the palace.\nSelvi tells Ramya that she intends to live on with Murali in Madhavi's body.

If they cannot consummate their relationship, she will kill Murali, so that they will be together in death.\nAfter hearing the story, Ravi meets a priest, who says there are only 2 ways to stop Selvi: use a strong emotion to bring Madhavi to her senses, or bring Murali to the river junction where a holy ritual will take place, generating a powerful energy that will lay Selvi to rest. Selvi's attempts to become intimate with Murali is being disrupted by the inhabitants of the palace, while Ravi attempts to find a way to bring Murali to the river junction without tipping off Selvi.

Things go well until Anamika gets kidnapped by two men. Arjun, who was in the bathroom when Anamika was kidnapped, immediately lodges a complaint at the Besant Nagar police station. Sub-Inspector Arumugam, who is assigned the case, then goes to Anamika's apartment along with Arjun, but finds that the apartment is cleaned up and there seems to be no sign that a kidnapping has taken place, while the apartment's watchman insists that Anamika had not returned to her apartment for three days. The CCTV camera installed at the apartment does not show any men arriving and taking away Anamika, prompting Arumugam to suspect that Arjun has lodged a false complaint as he is drunk. \nHowever, when Arumugam calls up Anamika's father Raghunath Kumar, the chairman of the TV news channel Channel 24, he merely replies that he doesn't know anything about the kidnapping and that Anamika is holidaying in Goa, at which Arumugam suspects something amiss, realising that Arjun had not lied after all. Arumugam and Arjun rush to Raghunath's mansion, where they see him being threatened by the two men who had kidnapped Anamika as well as the police inspector of Besant Nagar to give them a SD card which has some critical information. Raghunath calls up his editor and asks him to give the SD card to the three men, after which he is killed by them. Arjun and Arumugam pursue the three men.

After learning the situation, Rishi Dev decides to rush to Chennai within the next three hours. Having got the SD card as well as its password, Arjun inserts the memory card into his mobile phone and sees that it has only one file in it; a video. The video shows the murder of model-turned-actress Megha Sharma at the hands of Rishi Dev two days ago and how he had fabricated the incident to make it look like the actress died due to a gas leak at her mansion. Arjun and Anamika, horrified on seeing this and also on the extent to which Rishi Dev's henchmen went to keep the video from being seen, decide to expose Rishi Dev by uploading the video on YouTube. \nThis backfires when Arjun's friend Raj, brings Rishi Dev's henchmen to the hotel room where Arjun and Anamika are staying, having been bribed by them. They manage to subdue Raj as well as Rishi Dev's henchmen and go on the run. Meanwhile, Rishi Dev arrives in Chennai, and after finding out that Arjun and Anamika attempted to upload the video on YouTube, blocks Internet access in Chennai. Rishi Dev also lodges a false complaint against them to the police commissioner Arulraj, claiming that they killed Raghunath to get his money and also to fuel Anamika's \"drug-addiction\". This makes Arjun and Anamika fugitives, with every movement of them now being tracked by the police. Anamika, in incognito, manages to contact every leading media house to assemble at the Forum Vijaya Mall (where they are hiding) at 3 pm as there is going to be a \"sensational event\" there.

At the airfield, he tries to force Rishi Dev to reveal the truth about Megha Sharma's death, using his mobile phone to record the meeting. But before he can get out the truth, the police arrives, following which Rishi Dev destroys the mobile phone and beats him up, all the while revealing that he killed Megha Sharma, but he cannot do anything about it because he is going to be arrested for the attempted murder of a Union Minister. Unfortunately for Rishi Dev, Arjun had organized their entire meeting, as well as Rishi Dev's revelation, using a button camera, with the video having been shared using 3G connectivity to Anamika, who then ensured that the video was broadcast live by all leading TV news channels, thus exposing Rishi Dev, who is soon arrested.

George initially refuses to enter, but when a policeman confronts them, the group escapes into the caves. They encounter singing female cultists, including a woman they saw at the party.

The students have to all answer the white bear's questions honestly, otherwise, they will be forced to single out the one that they suspect to be lying to be killed. Shoko and Yukio get killed, and Shun soon realizes that the bear is the true liar and that its real color is black, therefore winning the game and surviving with the other four students.\nThe final game, presented by a Matryoshka doll, is a game of kick the can that must be completed before sundown. The remaining five each pick a stick, and who gets the red one plays the \"Devil\". Whoever's face is seen and gets called out by the \"Devil\", is caught and thrown into a cell.

While Squaronthehypotenus is reluctant to allow their stay, Senator Prospectus allows them to stay as part of Caesar's plan.\nCaesar then enacts the next phase of the plan by offering free apartments to the Gauls. In another attempt to make the Roman civilians leave, Asterix has Cacofonix to sing deafeningly loud outside the mansions. This almost works until the rest of the Gauls shows up to silence Cacofonix and move into their new apartments.\nCaesar begins the final part of his plan, razing the village. The legion, however refuses to cooperate with Getafix and Obelix still at large. Getafix, Mischiefus and Dogmatix are captured and held in the Mansions' reception, while Obelix faints from hunger next to the Roman legion while searching for the three, and is thrown into a chamber beneath the Mansions.\nAsterix awakens the next day to find the village being besieged, and the Gauls are brought along to watch the village's destruction. The Gauls keep the Romans at bay by pretending to still possess the magic potion, while Asterix makes his way to the Mansions.

The survivors gather in a network of safe cities and build primitive humanoid robots, called Pilgrims, to help rebuild and operate in the harsh environment. These robots have two unchangeable protocols: they cannot harm any form of life and may not repair, modify, or alter themselves or other robots in any way. Initially seen as mankind's salvation, they are relegated to manual labor when they fail to stop the advance of desertification. Society has regressed due to lack of technology besides the Pilgrims, as a lack of functional aircraft or other transport prevents travel and cars are a rare commodity, and humanity is on the brink of extinction.\nIn 2044, Jacq Vaucan\u2014an insurance investigator for ROC, the company that manufactures Pilgrims\u2014investigates a report from Wallace, a police officer who shot a robot he claims was modifying itself. As Jacq looks for a robot they suspect was stealing parts, it leads him outside the city. When he finds it inside a shipping container, it sets itself on fire. As he and a team open up the burned robot to see what it was hiding, they discover the robot had a rare nuclear battery that could power a robot indefinitely. They are able to power up the robot once more, but when he asks it why it set itself on fire, it burns out again.\nJacq salvages the remains and speculates to his boss, Robert, that there may be a \"clocksmith\", someone who illegally modifies robots, who is overriding the second protocol. Incredulous, Robert rejects this possibility but offers Jacq a transfer out of the city if he can find evidence. Jacq's pregnant wife initially rejects his plans but she eventually relents.\nJacq and Wallace investigate a brothel, where they find Cleo, a modified robot that Wallace subsequently shoots in the leg. When Jacq objects, Wallace says that Cleo's owner will lead them to the clocksmith; Wallace also threatens to kill Jacq if he does not split the proceeds of the battery on the black market. Jacq follows Cleo's owner to a clocksmith named Dr. Dupr\u00e9, who claims not to know who altered Cleo, an action that would destroy Cleo's CPU. Jacq leaves the burned robot's CPU with her and offers to give her the battery if she can locate information on the clocksmith. When Dupr\u00e9 installs the modified CPU in Cleo, Cleo begins self-repairing. Dupr\u00e9 contacts Jacq, who alerts Robert; however, ROC intercepts Jacq's message and sends a team of assassins to Dupr\u00e9's lab.\nDupr\u00e9 is killed, but Jacq escapes in a car driven by Cleo. When Cleo takes them into a maze of stanchions, both cars crash; the assassins are killed, and Jacq is injured. Cleo takes Jacq with her into the desert, where they are joined by three other robots, none of whom will obey Jacq's orders. However, the first protocol forces them to prevent his death. Desperate to return to the city to be with his pregnant wife, Jacq makes contact with Robert, who sends Wallace to recover him. Wallace threatens Jacq's life and destroys two of the robots, who have objected to his actions; Jacq kills Wallace with a flare gun before he can also destroy Cleo. Wallace's partner flees after taking a battery from one of the robots.\nRobert's boss discloses that the predecessor to the first Pilgrim was a quantum mind created with no security protocols and no artificial restraints on its computational power. Before they deactivated it, its makers tasked it with designing the security protocols that govern Pilgrims. Robert's boss informs Robert that no one has been able to break Pilgrim security protocols because they were created by the unrestricted quantum mind and ROC purposefully limited the computational power of all subsequent AI. ROC forces Robert to accompany a team sent to kill Jacq and the unknown clocksmith before the robots can evolve further beyond human understanding. When Robert objects to their kidnapping Jacq's wife and baby daughter, Conway, the leader, shoots him and leaves him for dead. Meanwhile, Jacq meets the robot responsible for modifying the others. The robot says that he and the other robots plan to go to the radioactive area where humans cannot go. Initially skeptical, Jacq eventually accepts that the robot naturally evolved, like humanity. After a series of philosophical discussions, Jacq gives them his battery, which they use to complete a new design, a sort of dog/insect robot. The robots repair a vehicle for Jacq, and he leaves for the city.\nWhen Conway reaches the robot outpost, he destroys two of the four robots. Jacq finds the dying Robert and returns to the outpost as Conway wounds Cleo and kills the evolved robot. Jacq kills all ROC assassins but Conway, though he is further wounded in the battle. As Conway prepares to kill Jacq, the new robot saves his life by pushing Conway off a cliff.

Her late husband, Oskar, was killed in a car accident that occurred as he drove Amelia to the hospital during labour. Sam begins displaying erratic behaviour: he becomes an insomniac and is preoccupied with an imaginary monster, which he has built weapons to fight. Amelia is forced to pick up her son from school after Sam brings one of the weapons there. One night, Sam asks his mother to read a pop-up storybook called Mister Babadook. It describes the titular monster, the Babadook, a tall pale-faced humanoid in a top hat with taloned fingers which torments its victims after they become aware of its existence. Amelia is disturbed by the book and its mysterious appearance, while Sam becomes convinced that the Babadook is real. Sam's persistence about the Babadook leads Amelia to often have sleepless nights as she tries to comfort him.\nSoon after, strange events occur: doors open and close mysteriously by themselves, strange sounds are heard and Amelia finds glass shards in her food. She attributes the events to Sam's behaviour, but he blames the Babadook. Amelia rips up the book and disposes of it. At her birthday party, Sam's cousin Ruby bullies Sam for not having a father, in response to which he pushes her out of her tree house; as a result she breaks her nose. Amelia's sister Claire admits she cannot bear Sam, to which Amelia takes great offence. On the drive home, Sam has another vision of the Babadook and suffers a seizure, so Amelia gets some sedatives from a paediatrician.\nThe following morning, Amelia finds the Mister Babadook book reassembled on the front door step. New words taunt her by saying that the Babadook will become stronger if she continues to deny its existence, containing pop-ups of her killing their dog Bugsy, Sam, and then herself. Terrified, Amelia burns the book and runs to the police station after a disturbing phone call. However, Amelia has no proof of the stalking, and when she then sees the Babadook's suit hung up behind the front desk, she leaves. That night, Amelia tries to fall asleep and watches the Babadook open her bedroom door, crawl up the ceiling and attack her. She then turns on all the lights in the house and falls asleep with Sam downstairs. After the attack, Amelia starts to become more isolated and shut-in, becoming impatient, shouting at Samuel for 'disobeying' her constantly, and having frequent visions of the Babadook once again. Her mental state slowly decays and she exhibits erratic and violent behaviour, including cutting the phone line with a knife and then waving the same knife aggressively at Sam without realizing it. This devolves into disturbing hallucinations, in which Amelia violently murders Sam.\nShortly after these visions, Amelia sees an apparition of Oskar, who offers to return to her if she \"brings the boy\" to him. Realizing that he is a creation of the Babadook, Amelia flees and is stalked through the house by the Babadook until it finally possesses her. Under its influence she breaks Bugsy's neck and attempts to kill Sam. Eventually luring her into the basement, Sam knocks her out. Tied up, Amelia awakens with Sam, terrified, nearby. When she tries to strangle him, he lovingly caresses her face, causing her to regurgitate an inky black substance, which seemingly expels the Babadook. When Sam reminds Amelia that \"you can't get rid of the Babadook,\" an unseen force drags him into Amelia's bedroom. After saving Sam, Amelia is forced by the Babadook to re-watch a vision of her husband's death. Furious, she confronts the Babadook, making the beast retreat into the basement, and she locks the door behind it.\nAfter this ordeal, Amelia and Sam manage to recover. Amelia is attentive and caring toward him, encouraging him with building his weapons and being impressed at Sam's magic tricks. They gather earthworms in a bowl, and Amelia takes them to the basement, where the Babadook resides. She places the bowl on the floor for the Babadook to eat. The beast tries to attack her, but Amelia calms it down and it retreats to the corner, taking the earthworms with it.

Dragna is unsympathetic when Jack calls him and instructs Jack to stick to the plan.\nAt the motel, Jack meets several people: Ned, the desk clerk who uses a wheelchair; Rivka, a tall hooker; and Lizard and Guano, a pair of pimps. Jack requests room number thirteen, and Ned cautions him that it is a deathtrap, as it is unconnected.  When two suited men become curious about Jack, he abruptly breaks into their room and kills both. A subsequent search reveals FBI badges and a briefcase. Jack sets the briefcase aside and leaves to dump the corpse stored in his car, but promptly returns upon being spotted, only to discover that Rivka has broken into his room.

Somewhat mollified, he retrieves the bag and waits in room fourteen. Dragna finally appears, disappointed in Jack's apparent lack of trust. Nonetheless satisfied that Jack has not looked in the bag, Dragna explains that the whole situation was a test of Jack's skills and character, as he doubted Jack's resolve in the wake of Jack's fiancee's unsolved murder some months earlier.

Hassan (based on the late M.F. Husain). The piece was gifted to Jeetu as a sign of their close friendship, before Hassan's rise to prominence and eventual death. Upon learning that Jeetu's tea stall painting is highly coveted, Tino comes up with another idea to secure an investment with The Other Side: secretly replace the painting with an identical fake one, and then loan the original for cash. Initially hesitant but desperate, Chako assists in the plan along with their friend Uday (Kavin Dave), an avid painter who begrudgingly agrees to compose an exact copy of the piece himself.\nWith the switch successful, Chako and Tino mortgage the original painting to a local art dealer, Y.B. Gandhi (Manoj Joshi). Shortly thereafter, however, Gandhi informs Chako that the painting he received is fake and that someone else had tried to sell the same painting to another dealer. Gandhi convinces Chako that either Tino had double-crossed him, or that his father had been lying about the painting's authenticity. Chako returns the money back to Gandhi, and angrily confronts Tino, who indeed went to a separate dealer, but was sent by Uday for an art survey only.

Hassan painting, however, was an original all along, and Gandhi - whom Hassan hated and never lent his work  to - had cheated Chako and Tino out of the painting. Gandhi then publicly humiliates Jeetu by telling the press he never had a friendship with Hassan, and that the stories of him making his paintings at the tea stall are all false.\nHoping to redeem themselves, Chako and Tino devise a plan to take advantage of Gandhi's own greed in order to get the painting back for Jeetu.

He confronts the place of the fake NGO but encounters Chako, Tino, and Jeetu. Chako and Tino demand that he publicly retract his earlier statements about Jeetu, or else be arrested for selling fake paintings and creating the fictitious \"Prabodh Gupta\" himself (since Gandhi was tricked earlier into funding the fake NGO). Realizing his defeat, Gandhi tries to offer money, but Jeetu declines and chastises him for his greed being the reason Hassan never worked with large art curators.\nGandhi holds a televised news conference the next morning, apologizing for his previous accusations against Jeetu.

Dilip lives in the slums near the plant with his wife, a son and his sister. He obtains a job in the plant as a labourer, and is happy since his daily wage is restored.\nThe plant's revenues drop due to lower sales of pesticides, and in order to reduce costs the officials neglect safety and maintenance. Questioning the chemicals used in the plant, Motwani (Kal Penn), a tabloid reporter, publishes reports on his printing press which are disregarded by most of the officials and workers. Roy (Joy Sengupta), the plant safety officer, expresses his concerns. The officials however ignore his warnings, and a worker is killed when a drop of methyl isocyanate leaking from a pipe lands on his arm. The officials deem the worker's irresponsibility as the cause of the accident and the plant continues to function. Dilip is given a better-paying vacant job in the plant despite lacking the skill to operate the machinery. A gas leak is prevented by Roy when water is mixed with methyl isocyanate, and in an attempt to stop people from panicking, the official in the plant disables the warning siren.\nWarren Anderson (Martin Sheen), the CEO of Union Carbide, visits the plant to inspect its functionality, where he is briefed about a plan to connect two additional tanks for storage of methyl isocyanate to increase the output of the plant, ignoring the deteriorated condition of the tanks. Motwani meanwhile meets Eva Gascon (Mischa Barton), a reporter for Paris Match, and persuades her to interview Anderson. She falsely claims to be an Associated Press reporter, but her lie is exposed during the interview. Motwani convinces Dilip of the danger posed by the chemicals.\nAs the date of the disaster nears, Dilip arranges a loan for his sister's wedding. Roy later explains how the company is ignoring safety standards and that a future leak might become uncontrolled as the officials had turned off safety measures to reduce maintenance costs. Roy gives his resignation to the company and advises Dilip not to talk about the plant's safety if he wishes to retain his job. Dilip makes a phone call to Motwani describing what Roy just said, and expresses his fear about the plant's safety, saying he will return to the rickshaw-pulling business as soon as his sister is married.\nTo overcome the increasing revenue loss, the officials shut down the plant, firing most of the workers, including Dilip. The plant officials then order the use of the remaining methyl isocyanate as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Dilip is busy with his sister's wedding, and Roy has a final look of the control room. The safety measures fail and a runaway reaction follows. The faulty tanks cause the gas to start leaking, and an attempt to contain the leak fails. The gas escapes to the surroundings and is carried east by the wind. Motwani rushes to alert the people in the vicinity of the plant to vacate and head west, since the warning sirens were previously sabotaged. He meets Dilip, who ignores the warning and asks Motwani to leave the area without causing any hindrance to the wedding. Meanwhile, the guests experience irritation in the eyes and discomfort in breathing. Dilip senses the danger and visits the plant, realising that the plant had been compromised. He rushes back to his residence where he finds his family and relatives dying from acute exposure to the toxic gas. He carries away his son, paying farewell to his wife's corpse and flees the slum.\nAs the gas shows its effects, a nearby hospital is filled with hundreds of patients reporting cyanide poisoning, and the lack of antidote results in most of the patients' death.

After playing volleyball and drinking some beer, the teens separate. Moments later, they are attacked by Bigfoot. Some (but not all) of the campers are killed on screen. The next day, Sheriff Jim Taylor and Deputy Walton arrive to investigate the murders. While there, an unidentified police official arrives on the crime scene and informs the sheriff that one of the victims (Steve McTee) is the son of a local oil tycoon, who is putting pressure on the department to solve the murder.

Reporter Sharp fires several shots at Bigfoot with Aaron's handgun and fails to kill the beast, but then the sheriff and his posse arrive and Deputy Walton shoots Bigfoot several times with a tactical shotgun, killing it. The deputy then turns around and is impaled by a spear thrown by someone/something off screen.\nZeke performs a Bigfoot call and a second Bigfoot emerges from the woods, which Zeke promptly shoots in the head. During a long speech, Zeke explains to the sheriff and the reporter that all female Bigfoot have gone extinct, and Bigfoot must now survive by kidnapping human females and impregnating them. Back at the hospital, Dr. Evans discovers that Dakota is indeed pregnant.

Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star, Ralph. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over replacing his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and complains that the prop gun does not look natural. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, culminating in a brawl after Riggan reads a New York Times interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play.

The world contains two major powers: the West, ruled by the Queen, and the East. The Queen manipulates events worldwide using operatives called the Queen's Watchdogs. The film's protagonist, Earl Kiyoharu Genpou (replacing Ciel Phantomhive from the anime), is a Queen's Watchdog in an unnamed Eastern metropolis. A large automobile is careering through a docks area. The man driving is rapidly desiccating, his face wrinkling, its skin crumbling. As he dies, the car crashes to a halt. A warehouse echoes with screams as dark-clad men herd young women around. The chief thug questions one young woman for carrying photos of desiccated bodies. A young man in a formal black butler's uniform suddenly appears in the warehouse, identifying himself as a servant of the Genpou family. The thugs attack. Most are disabled or killed quickly. Only the chief thug remains conscious for questioning.\nThe next day, the young woman earlier questioned in the warehouse appears dressed as a young gentleman, in the role of Earl Kiyohara Genpou, the only son and heir of the Funtom Toy Company fortune. The earl's servants are present, including Sebastian Michaelis (the Black Butler from the previous night's battle), the clumsy maid Rin, and the house stewards Tanaka. The Earl speaks with the Queen's personal secretary Charles B. Sato about the death of the Queen's ambassador Anthony Campelle, found overnight on the docks, mummified in his car. The unusual cause of death, and the presence of a card depicting a devil, mark it as the eighth similar mysterious death of a powerful citizen in a case called the Devil's Curse. All victims have some connection with the human smuggler from the warehouse. No motivation for the deaths is apparent, however, nor is a root cause of the desiccating symptoms. The Queen demands a quick close to the case.\nAt the Eastern Ministry for State Security, Bureau of Foreign Affairs, a senior official greets the visiting policeman Tokizawa. A coat button found at the warehouse massacre implicates a Watchdog of the Queen in the fracas. Tokizawa is told that if a Watchdog exists, he represents a danger to the nation and should be disposed of. Tokizawa is then warned to pretend he heard nothing about the connection between the warehouse and the Watchdog, nor about the Watchdog's proposed elimination or else the Queen will know about it. Tokizawa and a few officers learn that the Genpou Family were once called the Phantomhive family from England before the family moved to Japan and change their family name to Genpou. The Earl and Sebastian examine Campelle's corpse. Clues found there lead them to an underground club of the wealthy. The Earl infiltrates the club using help from her aunt, with the maid Rin posing as her escort. Sneaking behind closed doors, the Earl and maid are captured and subdued by Shinpei Kujo, CEO of Epsilon Pharmaceuticals, host of the party.\nKujo talks with a hooded figure about Necrosis, a poisonous new drug. Party guests begin inhaling Necrosis. After a brief moment of euphoria they begin bleeding from nose, ears, and eyes as desiccation sets in. A henchman displays a familiar devil card, along with a bowl of red capsule, consuming two of which will cancel the effects of the Necrosis poison. The hooded figure suddenly kills Kujo and leaves. At the same time, Sebastian searches a series of darkened laboratories. A booby trap explodes near him, destroying the side of the lab building. The butler survives and rescues the Earl and the maid Rin from the scene of the Necrosis poisoning. Tokizawa takes Sebastian for interrogation; however, Sebastian beats up the police and escapes. The Earl travels with her aunt to a room near the exorcism ceremony. The aunt admits to being the hooded figure who killed Kujo, as well as the masked figure who years ago killed the Earl's parents and the bio-terrorist who will soon kill the gathered elite with a Necrosis bomb.

It is debatable whether the Chinese version is censored or simply a different cut for a different audience. \nIn Heilongjiang Province, 1999, the dismembered parts of a human body appear in shipments of coal in different cities. Detective Zhang Zili (Liao Fan) is assigned to investigate. The dead man is identified as a coal worker named Liang Zhijun, according to an identification badge next to some of the remains. Zhang and his partners (including Wang) go to interview a potential suspect and his brother. The suspect kills two of Zhang's partners before Zhang shoots the brothers while getting shot by one of them. Zhang survives. Wang and Zhang return the ashes of Liang to his widow Wu (Gwei Lun-mei), an employee at Rong Rong Laundry. Wu buries the ashes at the base of a tree just outside Rong Rong Laundry.\nBy 2004, Zhang has quit the police force and become a drunken security guard, having been traumatized by the prior events. During a chance encounter with Wang, Zhang learns that two additional murders have occurred by the same modus operandi. The common thread is that both of these men had dated Wu. Both men were wearing ice skates when they were killed. Zhang feels intrigued and begins to investigate. He becomes a customer of Rong Rong Laundry and tries to follow Wu at night, but she easily detects him. One day, the owner of the laundry (Wang Jingchun) explains to Zhang that he employs Wu out of sympathy, even though she does not do her job properly. In fact, five years before, Wu had damaged an expensive jacket and was unable to provide compensation, although a few days later the jacket's owner stopped complaining and disappeared.\nZhang tries to make friends with Wu, and eventually invites her to go ice-skating at an outdoor rink. Wang is secretly following the pair when he notices that a truck driver is also following them. He follows the truck driver, but while arresting him, the truck driver kills him using the blades of a pair of ice-skates as a weapon. The murder of his former partner makes Zhang even more determined. He follows up on a license plate number written on a pad of paper (presumably by Wang). While on the bus Zhang is followed by a man with a pair of skates. He goes into a restaurant and notices the man following him. He loses the man at a dance hall. The next day he follows the truck and sees the man dispose of wrapped packages from an overpass onto a passing coal train. He then follows the man to the outdoor ice skating rink. To test his new theory Zhang asks the service desk at the rink to page Liang Zhijun (the first murder victim from 1999). The man Zhang was following reacts by immediately leaving the rink.\nThe police confront Wu regarding the murders. She insists on speaking to Zhang. She tells him that Liang is alive and had killed someone during a robbery. She tells Zhang that Liang switched identities with the man and that Liang is alive and following her since 1999 and killing any man with whom she is involved.\nZhang gets Wu to help the police catch Liang. She reveals his location and arranges to meet him. They meet in a hotel and later go out to buy cigarettes. Liang notices the police and runs. Liang is armed with a gun, the police give chase and eventually kill Liang.\nThe police ask Wu for the ashes from 1999. She says that she threw the ashes in a river, which makes Zhang suspicious (he had seen her burying the ashes under a tree outside the laundry). He returns to the laundry and persuades the owner to sell him the damaged jacket that the customer had abandoned. After a search for the jacket's owner, Zhang arrives at the Daylight Fireworks Club. (The film's name in Chinese is \"Daylight Fireworks\".) He meets the owner of the club and asks if she recognizes the jacket. She says that her husband owned a similar jacket. She also says that in 1999 he left the club with another woman and she has not seen him since. Zhang asks the owner whether she would recognize the woman her husband left with, and she says yes. She offers to pay Zhang for the woman's whereabouts while appearing to fall into her bathtub fully clothed, indicating that she is possibly mentally unstable. Zhang says he only came to deliver the jacket.\nZhang goes back to the laundry to invite Wu to a performance at an amusement park. The next evening, on a Ferris wheel, Zhang asks Wu to look over the city. The neon lighting of the Daylight Fireworks Club is visible. Zhang asks Wu what she sees, and she admits seeing the club. Zhang wants Wu to tell him the truth before the police find out. Wu instead kisses Zhang and they end up having (awkward) sex while still on the Ferris wheel.\nPolice then question Wu and confront her with the jacket. Wu admits she killed the owner of the jacket. When she had not been able to afford to pay the value of the jacket, the owner of the jacket had forced her into an ongoing sexual relationship. Wu therefore killed the owner of the jacket. Wu said Liang had not been involved and that he had sacrificed everything for her, becoming a living dead person. She admits betraying Liang.\nZhang returns to his former life.

Meanwhile, logger Vick put his new lumbering tools to test, spooking the Bear Brothers - Briar and Bramble - into pursuit, and successfully steal the tool crate from Vick. Maurice and Arnold scramble to recover the case, but are steamrolled by the bears who confuse them with Vick. With his tools destroyed by the bears as well, Vick ends up taking the other suitcase before savagely beating the criminals, believing they are the bears. Vick and the bears then return to their respective homes.\nOn the next day, Vick discovers that a baby girl in a bear suit was inside instead of his tools. Noticing she was kidnapped from a police alert on TV, he set off to find the authorities and return her. The baby's interference causes Vick's pickup to behave erratically, alerting a police officer and getting the truck stuck. After freeing his vehicle with a scarecrow and securing her with tape, he was mistaken as the culprit by the officer pursuing him. Attempting to explain his circumstances and cut off the tape, the baby bites Vick, who inadvertently launches his knife into the officer. Now a wanted criminal, Vick barely escapes pursuit in his slightly crippled vehicle.\nEnraged by the trouble she warranted, Vick seals his house and angrily scolds her for trashing his place. Instead of silencing the baby, her cries penetrate the entire forest. He later successfully pacifies her with a water gun, and learns her nickname \"Lola\" while washing her suit. Gradually, he becomes a fatherly figure to her. On a bicycle, Vick sets off to procure supplies for Lola when they are running short, only to be arrested by the officer. Maurice and Arnold happen to be illegally attaching missing person posters nearby in an effort to find Lola. Stopping to warn them, the officer is knocked out by the duo and they steal his patrol car. In the ensuing scuffle, Vick sneaks away undetected.\nSuspecting Vick in possession of threatening gizmos, Briar invades Vick's house with Bramble, but the mission goes off-course when Bramble insists on acquiring food instead. While they empty Vick's stash, Lola almost reveals herself to Briar, who was jump-scared several times, unable to determine the cause nor convince Bramble. Lola sneaks into Bramble's bag and the brothers depart. At their treehouse, after Bramble almost mistakes her for an apple, the bears were confused and terrified by her appearance, having almost zero contact with humans other than Vick. They warm up to each other quickly and begin to hang out.\nVick, who was devastated when he discovers his house ransacked by bears, was relieved to have Lola gone. His past animosity against them gets the better of him in a nightmare, and he storms off to rescue her, unaware of the events occurred in his absence. The bears and Vick have a tense standoff and brief scuffle inside the tree while Lola suddenly succumbs to a fever, forcing Vick to rush her home. The brothers attempt to help Vick also, with Bramble inadvertently thwarting Maurice and Arnold. After repeated failures, Arnold and Maurice' unseen employer decides to take matters into his own hands.\nVick and the Bears come to an alliance with Lola's presence as the three constantly organize activities to entertain her, with the former even constructing an aerial bicycle while the bears follow them around in Vick's truck. Soon, mercenaries appear and attempt to capture Lola. While Vick attempts to dodge them, Briar and Bramble make use of their pyrotechnics and appropriate enemy equipment to fight them off, with Briar even indirectly incinerating a hostile blimp. Despite their best efforts, Vick and Lola were knocked out, snagged by Maurice and Arnold. The bears notice the stolen police car driving away and follow them in Vick's abandoned bike.\nVick was taken to the headquarters of a corporate enterprise, where their leader reveals himself as the mastermind behind Lola's disappearance: Lola was an orphan adopted by his deceased father, his predecessor. He desires to reclaim the inheritance passed to Lola, having sensed the fortune sealed in a  vault only unlocked by her. Maurice and Arnold were amongst many working for him. Lola ends up tearing off his toupee, and Vick mocks him for being bald.\nBriar and Bramble, having pursued the thugs to company grounds, sneak into a nearby warehouse. While mostly silent, the brothers accidentally alert a group of armed guards playing Majong and barely survive the ensuing pursuit under gunfire. Defeating them with disguises and a duet, the bears discover Vick and Lola's location. Briar sends Bramble to alert the authorities, and a nearby crane catches his eye. Bramble smashes the wrecking ball and Briar into the building, then slides down to assist. The CEO, Maurice and Arnold flee, leaving the bodyguards to stop the trio. Vick frees himself, and the bears easily pummel their opposition.\nBriar, Vick and Bramble pursue them to a catwalk. Briar seizes Maurice, but the CEO retakes Lola by collapsing the bridge and an active turbine. Maurice escapes, and Arnold threatens to kill Briar if they approach. Using Briar's aerial advantage point and the turbine's winds keeping him airborne, Vick gets Bramble to launch himself. With the help of air currents fueling his spin, Briar viciously throws Vick at Maurice and Arnold, defeating them instantly.\nThe CEO eventually reaches the Vault, tricking Lola into unlocking its digital security measures with her hands. However, he is frustrated when he finds nothing but his legacy items from his youth and a letter from his father to Lola. The trio storm the vault, and while the boss makes his escape on a reinforced elevator, Briar finds a window of opportunity to advance.\nStill in disbelief, the CEO flees in a helicopter. Briar and Bramble grapple onto its landing skids, with Vick catching up by pole-vaulting. In the cabin, Lola messes with the controls, and the chopper flies erratically, forcing the three to also dodge various hazards ad eventually storm the vehicle. The bears' weight cause the aircraft to tilt, and Vick jumps out to save Lola, while Bramble and Briar grab him, holding onto the left access. In order to rid the intruders, the CEO activates autopilot but fails to evict Briar due to the latter's extreme mass. As they approach a chimney, at Vick's urging, they all bail and land safely in a towering industrial water tank moments before the collision. The CEO, having survived and clinging on a parachute, swears revenge at them but was cornered by a group of responding officers.\nWith the true mastermind imprisoned and Lola rescued, Vick was exonerated and declared a hero for his part, with everyone returning to their normal lives, though he remains confused to the chain of events that occurred. Disturbed by his boss Mr. Li in a snowy morning, an irritated Vick promises to continue supplying timber. As he hangs up, Vick discovers a parcel mailed to his doorstep. Inside, he discovers various repaired items photographs of Lola with the old man who adopted her, as well the reconstructed letter, in which he proclaims her importance to him as he was dying.

But at one time children used to play hide-and-seek around that banyan tree on the public land, on scorching hot days cowherds dozed in its soothing shade, peasants working in the fields cooled their perspiring bodies under its leafy branches while eating the lunch brought by their wives or daughters. But in a few days time, the cursed tree claimed its second victim, the carpenter Tulsi's old mother (Dilara Zaman) who went gathering dry leaves under it. Tulsi's wife Durgarani (Sohana Saba) told everyone that tree was indeed the killer of her mother-in-law.\nThe newly qualified doctor Abir Ahmed at the village health centre examined the dead woman and said that she had died of a heart attack.\nThe Hindus refused to accept his verdict. Overnight the tree turned into a deity. Illiterate and superstitious Hindus began to worship the tree from a safe distance, the over-zealous among them even dared to decorate the trunk and branches of the tree with red pennants. The Brahmins began to proclaim that the tree deity could only be appeased by performing puja under it and offering human sacrifice.\nThe time of Durga Puja, the biggest Hindu festival, drew near. Muslims too prepared to rejoice in the festivities of their Hindu neighbours. The image of goddess Durga was being constructed in the temple. Arati \u2013 ritualistic worship with oil lamps and burning sense accompanied by the loud ringing of bells and beating of gongs \u2013 was performed every evening in the temple till late, although worshippers were careful not to begin it until the Muslims had ended their namaz. This was a familiar daily scenario in Mohanpur.\nMohanpur has a small marketplace consisting of only a handful of shops. Protul Nag is the night watchman, appointed by Gour Biswas, the head of the temple committee. It is said that he had murdered his wife. Protul patrols the market area every night, shouting \"Beware, all honest people!\" although his own honesty is subject to question. One night a thief broke into a shop and tried to escape carrying a sackful of rice. But he ran into Protul and dropping the sack ran off to hide under the banyan tree on the public land. There were heavy rains and thunderstorm that night and the next morning the thief was found lying stone dead under the tree. After examining the corpse the qualified doctor Abir Ahmed said the man had been murdered.\nThe Hindus refused to accept the doctor's opinion. They said: \"The deity is demanding human sacrifice. Such incidents will not stop until the deity\u2019s demand is met.\" The veteran homoeopath Araj Ali asked: \"If the man has indeed been killed by that tree, why is there a vicious bruise on his head?\" But no one paid any heed to his question.\nTulsi was dumbfounded with grief at his mother's death. He had the lurking suspicion that the members of the temple committee might have \npersuaded his wife Durga to poison the goat. Were they responsible for his mother's death as well? His mother and Durga had never been on very good terms with each other, so he could not help suspecting his wife. So he withdrew into a shell and simply stopped talking. Meanwhile, a clandestine relationship developed between Durga and the new doctor Abir. This gave rise to covert whisperings in the village.\nThe homoeopath Araj Ali repeatedly sent applications to the district town praying for the interference of the authorities to resolve this situation. One day a Police Inspector arrived to make inquiries into the questions involving the banyan tree. Both Hindus and Muslims gathered at the spot. The Inspector carefully examined the tree. Araj Ali's letters had already appraised the Inspector of the dirty politics behind the incidents taking place in the village. An elderly Hindu villager came forward and said: \"Inspector Sir, this tree is not a mere tree, it\u2019s a deity. It\u2019s demanding more blood.\" The Inspector replied: \"So you\u2019re advocating human sacrifice here! You want a temple where you can worship. But was there ever a temple at this spot?\" An old Muslim gentleman shouted: \"There has never been a temple here. Why is it necessary to preserve this tree? Let\u2019s cut it down!\" These heated arguments created considerable excitement among the crowd and led to skirmishes. Finally, the police managed to disperse the crowd by wielding sticks and the Inspector even had to fire a few rounds. The police force left without taking a decision.\nThe next day a bagful of money reached the Inspector. The authorities shook their hands off the matter. And the mosque committee discovered that their agitation was about to fizzle out since their community had suffered no loss of life or property. Meanwhile, the temple committee arranged to guard the tree lest someone tried to destroy it. In spite of that one night, some men wearing caps managed to tear off the red ribbons hung from its branches. Coming to know of this Araj Ali rushed there and re-fastened the red ribbons, two village communities.\nThe same night the dead body of Araj Ali was found at the bottom of the tree. The fingers of one of his lifeless hands were clutching a cap. The mosque committee placed the blame of Araj Ali's death squarely on the temple committee while the latter accused the former of the same crime. The two sides began taking out processions, in turn, protesting against this heinous act and demanding justice.\nApprehending that the situation was quickly going out of control, the doctor Abir Ahmed petitioned the higher authorities. The government responded with strict orders that neither side was to erect any kind of structure in the vicinity of the disputed tree. Hindus and Muslims then joined hands to drive the Doctor Abir out of the village. They chose Tulsi's beautiful wife Durga as the instrument for making their plan work.\nTheir plan was successful. Answering the coquettish call of Durga, the doctor came to see her behind her house in the dead of night. He was caught red-handed by vigilant villagers. The same night both Hindus and Muslims gathered in the courtyard of Haji Sahib where the doctor was put on trial. Their verdict was that Doctor Abir must leave the village by the first light of dawn. Progressive ideology was thus defeated by dirty politics.\nBut will this politics of religious dogmatism, of vested interests ever come to an end? Or is it to continue as long as the human race lasts? But that banyan tree is still standing on that same public land, and politics is still being played around it.\n\"O Brihonnola Tree, may you survive forever because you too have the right to live.\"", "tmdb_plot": "Religious prejudice and racial dogmatism are the curse of Mohanpur, a backwater village out of touch with progress in the contemporary world.

She is called to check in on elderly Delia Chandler and finds the woman nearly decapitated in her living room. Chandler's mouth is twisted as if she was screaming. The police encounter another gruesome murder where a man's stomach has been fed to some dogs. His face was also twisted into a scream. After a third murder, the police come to believe they are dealing with a serial killer.  They discover that the mouths have been positioned to form the syllables of the word \"L\u00edbera\".\nMicallef consults Father Price (Donald Sutherland), a priest in the nearby Catholic church who specializes in Latin. Price explains the various meanings and uses of \"libera\", including a \"Resurrection Prayer\", which supposedly holds the power to raise the dead. He claims that Jesus was resurrected through the sacrifice of 12 willing souls. Micallef deduces that the serial killer she is pursuing is contorting his victims' faces into the 12 syllables of the Resurrection Prayer.\nMicallef's deputy, Ben Wingate (Topher Grace), uses his mother's travel points to fly to British Columbia to follow a lead from the Delia Chandler killing.  He finds a woman at a trailer in the middle of the forest and learns that she is delivering gifts from \"the disciples\" and begs him not to enter the trailer. Inside, Wingate discovers more packages and a body wrapped in formaldehyde-soaked bandages.\nAt a local coffee shop, a mysterious man (Christopher Heyerdahl) enters and chats with the waitress (Kristin Booth).  Because he seems to be carrying a doctor's bag, she tells him that her daughter (Ella Ballentine) has terrible seizures, and he offers to help. At her house, he brews the child some tea and appears to smother her. When Micallef later visits the waitress, she learns that the daughter nearly died from the tea she drank but that a recent MRI revealed she is now symptom-free. The young girl revealed that the mysterious man's name is Simon. Micallef consults the Coroner's Reports on the local victims and realizes that they were all poisoned. She also discovers that they were all terminally ill. She deduces that Simon is gathering his victims from an on-line forum for terminal patients. She tracks down his next victim and sends Wingate to prevent the murder. Wingate is not in time, and Simon grabs him from behind, injecting Wingate with a powerful sedative.\nSimon next turns up in Fr. Price's church, where they talk briefly about Simon's mission. It becomes clear that Simon is attempting to resurrect the body in his trailer and that Fr. Price will be his next victim, because he, too, is terminally ill. Fr. Price is willing to be a sacrifice, but he begins to doubt that they are doing the right thing. Wingate and Micallef arrive too late to save Fr. Price. A nun informs Micallef that Simon's real name is Peter and that he and his brother were orphans under Fr. Price's care. One of them was adopted while the other was left in the orphanage. The dead body in the trailer is Peter's brother, who had committed suicide a year earlier.\nMicallef's superiors have deduced who Peter's next victim will be, and they have already secured him. Micallef resents being left off the team that will arrest Peter. She finishes off a bottle of whisky and goes home in a stupor. Peter is waiting for her there. He drugs her and takes her to a farmhouse, where he brews her some of his tea. He explains his mission to her, but she remains confused about why he would want to resurrect his brother, who did not want to live. Peter gets her to admit that the true source of her pain is the loss of her baby, and she nearly agrees to be his 12th victim. As she is about to drink the poison, she decides against it.

James has a week to arrange his affairs. His bishop leaves it to James to decide whether to notify the police.\nJames' daughter Fiona has attempted suicide after feeling abandoned following her mother's death and her father's entry into the priesthood. Their reconciliation is a principal theme of the film.\nLocal butcher Jack Brennan has hit his unfaithful wife, Veronica, and James confronts him. Jack denies it, blaming Veronica's lover, Simon. James goes about his pastoral duties, and obtains a revolver for an elderly American writer who is contemplating suicide to thwart senile decay.\nMillionaire Michael Fitzgerald's family has deserted him and he feels directionless and detached from reality. At the hospital, following a car crash, James performs the last rites for the Italian driver, and comforts the widow, Teresa. She bravely accepts her husband's death, believing life with love lost better than life without knowing love. James visits Freddie Joyce in jail, a killer who ate his female victims and now, asking for forgiveness, cannot recall where one particular victim is buried. James initially accuses him of insincerity, but later remarks that if God cannot understand Freddie, nobody can. Through James's dealings with Freddie, Michael, another potential suicide (Milo), Teresa, and Fiona, the film reflects on guilt, sin, virtue, depression and suicide.\nThat night, James witnesses the burning down of his church. He later tells Fiona he will never abandon her, spiritually at least, and she reciprocates. Finding his dog dead with its throat cut, he buries it, weeping, but keeps the death from his daughter the next morning as she leaves. Walking a country lane, James chats innocently with a young girl when the father drives up, orders her away from him and rudely questions his motives. At the pub, the doctor/pathologist tells James a horrifying story about a small child rendered deaf, mute, paralyzed and blind after botched anaesthesia, and contemplates the ineffable terror of such sensory isolation. James, angered, gets drunk, argues with cynical publican Brendan Lynch and empties the revolver into the furnishings.\nBrendan wields a baseball bat and later, a beaten-up James is recovering at home. He violently berates his house guest Father Leary who, offended, leaves the next morning. James decides to fly to Dublin, but returns from the airport after meeting Teresa and seeing her husband's coffin disrespected by the airport staff. Heading to the beach on the fateful Sunday, James chats with the ageing writer en route, then by phone to Fiona, saying sin is considered too much and virtue not enough. He stresses the importance of forgiveness and they forgive one another.\nAfter James throws his revolver into the sea, a distressed Michael walks up and James promises to visit him. Later, the altar boy, painting a seascape at the top of the beach, witnesses James waiting on the beach as Jack Brennan strides along the shore towards James, a revolver outstretched. Jack confesses to the arson and to hitting Veronica but denies killing the dog. Jack, hearing that James shed tears over his dog, asks if he cried similarly over news reports concerning children abused by priests. James says no, he had felt detached from such stories\u2014whereupon the enraged Jack shoots James in the side. The boy runs towards them but James shouts at him to flee. Jack says it is too late to stop, telling James to say his prayers.

After a while, he starts to worry: He does not know the number to call to check on rehearsal, so he asks the car's passengers. Junior, the front passenger, offers to type in the number for him.  When Reagan hands him his cell phone, Junior does not hand it back, instead he pockets it and does not give it back when Reagan asks.\nThey speed up and stop in front of a shack out in the middle of nowhere. Pulling Reagan out of the van and throwing him to the ground, Mike, the driver, punches him in the back of the head repeatedly until Reagan passes out. The two men carry him into the shack. Reagan's phone rings back in his hotel room, but he is not here. The film crew cannot find him for the movie.\nIn the shack, Reagan wakes up. His feet are being tied together. His hands are already chained. They dump out his belongings and walk out of the shack. Reagan realizes the chain on his hand is also fastened to the wall, and he cannot leave.\nReagan tries to talk to Mike about ransom, saying he can get him at least a million dollars and no one would ever know what happened.

But first, he is going to re-record Reagan's cell phone voicemail \u2013 making Reagan read it out loud, and he better make Mike \"believe it\". Reagan reads it to himself and tells him \"it's weak, no one talks that way\". Then he says that if he wants it to sound crazy, he'll make it crazy. He records a message that says \"don't call me anymore, f*** off everybody.

Mike leaves, and Junior stays behind.\nJunior walks in the shack and sees blood pooling on and leaking through the floor. Junior sees a pool of blood by Reagan's face and finds a tooth. It looks like Mike pulled Reagan's tooth out of his mouth after tasing him. Junior puts the tooth into his pocket.\nReagan wakes up to see a gator inches from his face with Junior on top of it, saying he just saved his life. He \"ain't ever seen a gator come all the way inside the shack before. He probably smelled all that blood\" and heard Reagan thrashing around. Junior then shoots the gator in the head and drags it out. He puts Reagan on a cot and wipes some blood off his mouth from where his tooth was pulled. \nJunior gets a phone call from Mike. Junior tells Mike that \"He is still alive\".\nCut to Mike in town at a security checkpoint.\nCut to Junior skinning the gator. He snorts some cocaine and is out around the woods. Reagan tries to get a knife off the wall, but falls, making noise. Junior hears it and comes in checking on the noise. Reagan admits he made some noise, accidentally. Junior just says \"mmhmm\". Reagan asks to piss, and asks him not to make him pee on himself again. Junior agrees, but says he has to keep his hands tied. He unhooks him from the wall. Reagan says he cannot walk. Then tells Junior he cannot run, even if he wanted to, his legs are messed up and he does not even know where they are. Junior agrees, but says if he tries to run, he will snap him down. Junior takes him to the \"bathroom\" where there's a hole in the floor. Reagan thinks about jumping through the hole. Instead, he just pees and comes back out to Junior. The phone rings, and Junior say he has to answer. He is trying to get Reagan back on the cot immediately, so he can answer the phone, since Mike is checking in. He gets to it. Reagan asks what Mike is going to do to him. He tries to tell Junior that Mike is crazy.

Mike is laughing hysterically.\nThe next day, Junior is grilling gator meat. He comes in and tells Reagan some sun might do him some good. He pulls him outdoors and tells him he'll help him take his shirt off and put sun cream on him.

He is heard masturbating in a room in the house.  the phone rings, and Junior comes out to answer it. Reagan is still chained to the cot outside. Mike says he is at work, creating his alibi and should return around 1:30\u1d00\u1d0d. Junior questions his own alibi. Mike says he does not need one. They hang up.\nMike visits his ex-wife, Diana.

She asks for the cat and he grabs the cat off the porch, and hands it to Diana. Diana closes the door.\nBack at the shack, Junior tells Reagan he loves his movies. That he used to be so cool, but he still loves his movies. Junior tells him he must take care of himself to look younger. Reagan tells Junior he looks pretty fit, asks if he works out; Junior is flattered.\nThe TV news posits the photo leaks and tweets may not be what they seem, as there is surveillance video of Reagan getting into a van at the hotel, but all his belongings are still in his hotel room. Also, the voicemail he recorded is actually a verbatim quote from a movie he was in, where he was a kidnapped soldier. 'Kristy' was the name of Reagan's character in that movie.\nThe police are now looking for the van and the whereabouts of Reagan Pierce. They're not sure if it is some sort of code or a suicide threat. \nBack at the shack, Junior gives Reagan some gator meat. Reagan says it is good. Junior tells him he has a nice smile. Looks like he is flirting a little. Reagan picks up on it and asks if he has a girlfriend. Junior says no. Asks if Reagan has a girlfriend. Reagan says no, he just ended things. Then says, maybe it is time for something different. Junior offers him some more gator meat. Reagan says yes. While Junior walks away, Reagan grabs the extra length of his chain and puts it under his leg. Junior asks him if he ever tried it on with a dude. Reagan says if he gets drunk enough he is typically down for whatever. Junior tells him he has some whiskey. He goes to get the whiskey and does a little cocaine. Junior pours some whiskey into his mouth. Reagan says \"it's working already.\"\nJunior says his heart is beating fast.\nJunior starts kissing his neck. Reagan freaks out and says to get off him. Says he cannot. Junior walks away upset. Reagan tries to calm him down. Junior says it is alright, because he 'roofied' [drugged] his gator stew. Junior \"just has to wait a bit, and then he can get him at night.\" Reagan starts to feel the effects of the roofie, and seems to pass out. Junior walks over puts his hands in his mouth, getting aroused. He pulls off Reagan's pants. He takes off his own pants, and is about to rape Reagan when the phone rings. Reagan head-butts him and takes the chain, wraps it around Junior's neck, and strangles him.\nReagan is overcome by the drug and passes out. Mike tries to call back again, and sees in a google search there's a \"mystery vehicle\" the authorities are looking for in connection with Reagan's disappearance. Mike freaks and is driving there and calling over and over. Reagan wakes up to a gator snapping at Junior's legs. It bites Junior and carries him out the shack. Reagan can see the phone continues to light up with Mike calling. Reagan is able to get the chain off the wall, but cannot undo his wrists.\nMike drives to Junior's mother's house looking for Junior; Junior is not there. He mentions that the road to the shack is flooded, and that he is going to take a boat. \nMeanwhile, Reagan walks out of the shack to a car in the yard and sees keys in the vehicle. He gets in and tries to start the car, but it does not work.\nMike drives the boat up and gets out. He slips and sees Junior's dead body on the edge of the water and he gets angry. Mike goes to the shack and looks around for Reagan in there. There are no lights, so he is walking around with a flashlight. Mike says \"oh, he's outside\" after he cannot find him in the shack and starts to walk back to the door. He sees Reagan and says he has \"got him\". Reagan says \"yeah, you got me\", and shoots Mike with some sort of spear gun. Mike drops and Reagan takes the gator thumper and beats Mike to death.\nLater, a reporter is interviewing Reagan, with his arm in a cast; she asks when did he think he was going to live. He says he did not at first, because even though the kidnappers were both dead, he still had to get to a boat, and he knew alligators were roaming around. So he thought to wait until morning. Reagan was pretty incoherent in the morning but he got in the boat. He was yelling, and men who were out fishing heard him. They found him and carried to land and got him to a hospital.\nReagan has returned home and gets a phone call from his manager, who says that his interview got amazing views. Everybody wants him in their movies.That night, Reagan pulls up his e\u2011mails on his computer and finds an e\u2011mail from Junior, apologizing for the way they met but reminding him that there was some good in it.

Years later in Las Vegas, Dale moves across the street from married couple Sarah and Josh, who introduce themselves by bringing over cookies.  Josh explains that he is a croupier and Sarah a graduate student who is working on her dissertation on the effects of pornography.  When Sarah questions Dale as to why he is staring at her, he says that she reminds him of someone, later revealed to be his mother.\nWhile Josh takes additional shifts at work, Sarah passes out and experiences a highly realistic dream in which she is murdered.  Confused by the fact that her clothes are different and the room cleaned, she investigates further and discovers her original shirt in the laundry, bloodied.  Josh suggests that she talk to her friend Leslie, a pregnant doctor.  Leslie, who experienced similar issues in the past, diagnoses her with night terrors and prescribes a hypnotic.

In the process, she loses her memories of the event.  Disturbed, she researches Dale online and finds that his mother has been institutionalized.  At the hospital, she learns from Eileen that Dale has a long history of murdering and resurrecting neighbors.

He advises Lei to surrender, but Lei refuses.\nTong runs into a checkpoint guarded by the 108th Division and realizes that they have defected to the Communists. He convinces them not to kill him or hold him hostage, quickly returning to the rest of the 12th Army. When he goes to make his report, his companion, who has also defected, holds him at gunpoint. Tong turns his back to his companion and encourages him to shoot, but his companion cannot do it.\nLei finally receives the order to break out. He gathers his officers and announces that no one is obligated to stay and fight, but they all choose to remain with him. As the fight begins, sergeant Tong reports to General Lei and asks to be court-martialed. Lei doesn't understand why until he mutters that they can win if the 108th joins the fray now, and Tong explains that the 108th has deserted. Lei pulls his FN Model 1910 and holds it to Tong's temple, but ends up handing Tong's rifle back to him and exhorting Tong to fight on. As the Communists burst through and start to overrun the Nationalist positions, Tong is badly burned pushing Lei out of the way of an exploding truck. Lying together injured, Lei asks Tong why he came back. Tong confesses that he lied about having a wife and kids and felt guilty about how much Lei trusted him. Lei entrusts Tong with his diary of writings addressed to his wife Zhou and orders Tong to make sure she receives the diary. Lei then returns to his command post to look upon his wedding photo and dream of his wife and children at a country estate.

They go to Auckland, and all the members of Eastern Knights lose their games apart from Michael and Mana. That night, Mana reveals that he knows Genesis lied about him having permission to come, but that Mana knows his father is dying.

Footsteps are heard from above, and then several men find them, severely assaulting the man and then dragging them both away as the woman screams.\nSometime later, a young stranger rides into a remote town somewhere in the Austrian Alps. Having introduced himself as a photographer, Mr Greider, he becomes the lodger of a widow whose husband and son suffered an untimely death. Soon, the newcomer learns that the entire town is firmly under the dominion of an aged rich man named Old Brenner and his six power-drunk sons. One day, the widow sends her daughter to town to run some errands. Greider is invited and decides to accompany young Luzi. As Luzi does her shopping, Greider asks for coffee and horseshoe nails. The brothers discover him at her side within the store, and command him to drink their schnapps. When he politely refuses by stating that he \"doesn't drink,\" one of the brothers beats him into compliance. Later, one of the Brenner brothers dies in what looks like a freak logging accident. Soon this same fate befalls another of the brothers; he falls off a cliff having been blinded by a branch with nails on it. Old Brenner finds nails in his dead son's eyes. Since Greider is suspected to have had his hand in these accidents, he hides.\nMeanwhile, it is revealed that the Brenners walk in the footsteps of their father. At every local wedding they claim the (fictional) medieval prerogative of Primae noctis; only Greider's parents (the young couple from the opening scene) had refused to comply. For that defiance, the Brenners crucified Greider's father, but his mother managed to escape and find refuge in America. The local priest still supports what the Brenners do. Greider confronts the priest in private, revealing that he's come to crack down on the Brenners. He admits that he did kill the two Brenner sons. After telling the priest that he's next to die, Greider shoots him.\nGreider rescues Luzi from the grasp of the Brenners after she marries Lukas and is abducted. Greider challenges them to a duel on the next day. Rather than waiting for the appointed duel, the brothers try to ambush Greider at the remote mountain cabin where he is holed up. At dawn they come after him, attacking all together. A shootout ensues. Greider is outnumbered four-to-one, but he has the advantage of a Winchester lever-action repeating rifle, while the Brenners all wield two shot side-by-side and breechloading rifles and are unfamiliar with a repeating rifle. Skillfully leveraging this edge, Greider kills or leaves for dead the remaining four brothers. He then seeks to deliver the message of their deaths to their father, but discovers that some citizens of the town remain loyal to Brenner senior.\nAs Greider approaches Brenner's home he is attacked by the blacksmith, a hulking giant brandishing a large iron log hook. Lukas manages to save Greider by shooting the blacksmith, but not before the hook finds its way through Grieder's shoulder. After the fight, Greider storms Old Brenner's house and finds him in his bed. Greider gives Old Brenner a picture of his mother, explaining the reason for killing Old Brenner's sons and now him. Old Brenner reveals to Greider that he is Greider's father (a product of his mother's rape by Brenner on her wedding night) and so therefore he has murdered his own half-brothers. Brenner asks him \"to make it quick\" and Greider obliges by shooting him in the heart. Greider recovers for three weeks from his wounds.

Unable to contact them the Foreman goes searching for them, finding only a logger's severed arm. He is then violently killed in his truck by an unseen creature.\nLater in town Sheriff Paul Shields and his new deputy from New York, Donny Saunders, speak to farmer Ron who insists one of his valuable horses has been stolen, though without evidence of theft it is assumed the horse merely escaped through an open gate. Paul then leaves to pick up his son Adam from his wife Susan who no longer lives with him after the accidental death of their other son, Tim. That night Adam sees a creature in the back yard and when Paul investigates he hears but does not see a large creature in the trees.\nThe next morning Paul finds large footprints in the snow around his house that appear to come from an animal with hooves that walks on two legs. Donny informs him the footprints are around everybody's houses in the entire town. Paul and Donny follow the footprints into the woods where they also find large claw marks on the trees where the footprints disappear. After hearing from park rangers that no known animal with hooves could walk such a distance on two legs Paul assumes the whole thing is a prank. Paul later hears from the town priest that his dog and a lot of other animals have gone missing. Paul then goes to a local store where Ron's daughter Clair and several hunters confront him with their fears about old Indian stories of creatures living in the woods, though Paul dismisses this. Earl, another hunter, informs Paul that even though it is hunting season, all the deer and other forest animals have disappeared, meaning a large new predator may be in the area.\nAs Paul drives Adam home they both see a very large creature in the back yard, but when Paul investigates, all he finds is a bridle up a tree that he confirms is from Ron's missing horse. The next day Paul and Susan meet Adam's teacher to talk about how Adam is not dealing with his brother's death, during which Susan becomes angry and upset. Paul meets Donny where they both witness a very large flock of birds in the sky flying south when they should be flying north. Susan tells Donny how Paul was watching their son Tim when he fell, hit his head and died and how he still blames himself even though she doesn't. That night Paul is called to Ron's farm where he sees the creature attempt to enter the horses stables before it flees, leaving behind more footprints showing the hoof is split into 3 sections, even though most cloven hoofed animals only have 2. That night Paul discovers a dead deer that had been mauled in the road but before he can move it the creature suddenly appears and takes the body with it. Donny wonders if it is not simply a forest predator that had not yet been discovered, similar to large fish species thought to be extinct that actually still exist deep in the ocean.\nThe next day three hunters are attacked by the creature in the woods. Two are killed and one makes it back to town. The bodies of the two dead hunters are later found hidden high in the trees. Paul bans any more hunters from entering the forest and orders everybody in town to stay indoors at night. He also reports the two deaths and calls in 2 dozen park rangers to hunt and kill the creature within 24 hours. That night a heavy snow storm hits the surrounding area and most of the town evacuates. Paul theorizes that the creature had been pushed from its territory by the logging company and is looking for a new home and sees humans as a threat. One of the hunters shows Paul film footage of a large creature walking on two legs. As the storm gets worse the creature breaks into Paul's house, where Paul barricades himself and Adam in the bathroom until the arrival of Donny scares it away.\nPaul gathers everybody who did not evacuate into the church, saying it is the safest place for everybody to stay until the park rangers arrive in the morning to hunt and kill the creature. However, the creature attacks the church and Susan manages to motivate Paul into forgiving himself for Tim's death. As the creature breaks into the church Paul leads everybody into the church's basement storm shelter. He tasks the hunters to guard the door then takes Donny to kill the creature.\nAs they follow the creature through the church Paul and Donny split up.

Paul realises it can climb as it suddenly drops down from the ceiling. As it rushes towards him Paul shoots it once again but drops his pistol as it overpowers him. He instead draws his hunting knife and stabs the creature to death.\nReturning to the basement Paul tells everybody the creature is dead and leads them back into the church.

Afterwards, Tuffnut has just finished his new creepy-looking face paint which shocks Astrid, Hiccup and Toothless. Tuffnut says that at least his doesn't look like a target, mocking the new pattern Fishlegs has applied; Fishlegs explains that it's actually the Ingerman family crest.\nSnotlout arrives cheering that his new Sheep Launcher finally worked, which Astrid points out that it took him thirty-two tries to get it right. It then cuts to a sequence of sheep launches, which makes it seem that the sheep, wearing a helmet that Snotlout put on it, is invulnerable to pain as it lands on several different locations. Snotlout decides that the sheep launcher is ready for the Dragon Race. Astrid complains and asks since when did he get to make such a decision; Snotlout states it's because he created the sport. Hiccup and Astrid quickly deny that claim, saying that's not how they remember it. Astrid tries to recall the events of how and who invented Dragon Racing.\nIt cuts to a flashback, shortly after the events of the second season where the Riders are still in their early teens. Berk is getting ready for the traditional annual boat race called the Regatta which starts in a few days, when suddenly a herd of sheep run throughout the village, causing minor trouble. Hiccup asks Gobber what's happening, and Gobber explains that after Silent (now dubbed Not So Silent) Sven broke his silence, his sheep ran out of their pens because they're afraid of his new voice. Stoick and Gobber struggle to gather the sheep, so Stoick orders Hiccup and the gang to round up the sheep as he gets ready for the Regatta; if he has to hear Sven scream any more, he'll put a hook through his own head just to end the torture.\nWhile in the process of catching the sheep, the Riders end up turning it in to an impromptu competition against each other in getting as many sheep as possible; they all arrive back at the pen and discover they all got three sheep each. Astrid points out that there is no winner in this 'competition'. Sven then cries out, alarmed that his prized black sheep is still missing and hoping that it didn't fall down the well again. At the mention of this, the Riders declare the black sheep as a tiebreaker. Hiccup states that it isn't a competition, but it falls on deaf ears: with the exception of Fishlegs, the others have already taken off. Moments later, Snotlout and Hiccup both spot the sheep, and they race towards it head on. Just as Hiccup is about to grab the sheep in his clutches, Gobber blocks his path and they collide, allowing Snotlout to claim the black sheep. Hiccup asks Gobber what's so urgent, and as he tries to remember Stoick calls Hiccup to come meet him, which was what Gobber was about to inform Hiccup about.\nStoick is preparing to set sail down at the docks, and informs Hiccup that he will be gone for several days to get wood from Loki Island: the lumber is lighter and stronger than any other wood they know of, and building their Regatta ship with it will be their secret weapon. He appoints Hiccup to oversee the preparations for the Regatta in his place, which Hiccup isn't excited to hear about due to the fact that he sees boats slowly moving across the harbor to be 'boring'. Stoick justifies that the Regatta is tradition and claims that it is a good way to 'blow off steam'; if Vikings aren't fighting against any enemies they need to fight against each other in competition, illustrated by two Vikings on the next dock over whacking each other with fish. Just as Stoick leaves, Fishlegs creeps in on Hiccup, saying that he is happy for Hiccup, as he considers being in charge of the Regatta as an honor. Fishlegs then helps Meatlug board a ship covered in a big cloth, which is hiding what he is working on. Fishlegs considers himself to be a sailor at heart and is excited that he is now finally old enough to compete; he and Meatlug will be working on their ship until the Regatta.\nMeanwhile, at the Academy, Tuffnut is plotting out some rules for the Riders' sheep competition, but is interrupted as Hiccup arrives reluctantly prohibiting them to carry on with their plan as he has Stoick's strict orders to prepare for the Regatta. The next day, Hiccup discovers that the Riders' have disobeyed his order and have carried on the sheep catching. Down below, the villagers are enjoying the Riders' sheep catching competition and say that it is much better than the Regatta. Later, the villagers gather at the Great Hall, growing restless for entertainment and they want to see the Dragon Race again. Hiccup has Toothless quiet down the crowd, then tries to regain their enthusiasm for the Regatta but is unsuccessful.\nInspired by the twins, the crowd wants another Dragon Race. Astrid then says to Hiccup that Stoick isn't going to be back for a few days and points out that the Dragon Race is also a great way to blow off steam. Seeing no other option, Hiccup agrees to have one Dragon Race. As Hiccup points out the starting location of the race, Snotlout and the Twins suggest they should have teams. Snotlout says the teams are already decided, with Snotlout and the twins on one team and Astrid, Hiccup and Fishlegs on the other. The twins then mention their team name, 'Snotnuts'. Hiccup and Astrid then go to get Fishlegs, but after mocking the name 'Snotnuts' he declines joining the race as he and First Mate Meatlug are still too busy getting ready for the Regatta, refusing to back down on his family tradition.\nThe race starts as Gothi drops the flag signalling the start of the race. They all immediately set off, and a Viking signals Sven to release the sheep. Early in the race, Hiccup manages to get one sheep but the Twins manage to get two. Meanwhile, Astrid and Snotlout both spot one sheep and race head on to get it first, and both of them are relentless to turn around only until Snotlout backs off, fearing collision, allowing Astrid to get the sheep. Late in the race the scores are tallied and the teams are all tied up. As soon as it is stated by Mulch, the Riders head of to get the black sheep as it is the tiebreaker. Both Hiccup and the Twins fail to capture the sheep, and shortly after Astrid and Snotlout spot the black sheep creating another head on race. Just as the two Riders are seconds away from the black sheep, it faints, unexpectedly becoming a static target.\nShortly thereafter, Astrid and Snotlout collide as neither of them backed out, and this causes Astrid's arm to be injured. Snotlout flies off to go get Gothi, but he is still thinking about the game and he grabs the black sheep. Snotlout then runs into a branch and is knocked off Hookfang; the sheep safely lands on top of him. Sometime later at the Great Hall, the uneventful Dragon Race causes the villagers to demand another Dragon Race, but Hiccup tells the villagers the deal was only one Dragon Race and then on to the Regatta. The villagers however are unsatisfied with that and continue to shout for another Dragon Race. Suddenly Snotlout announces that Hiccup is right, but mocks him by saying that it's not like he will beat team Snotnuts anyway.\nAstrid wants to back up Hiccup, but she is still injured and cannot take the risk. Snotlout points out that there's no rematch anyway as Hiccup has no teammate, but Hiccup is still determined to continue the Race, so he once again asks Fishlegs to join his team. At first Fishlegs refuses as he is putting the finishing touches on his ship. After he unveils the small ship with a flourish, Toothless can't help but laugh at the decorations. Fishlegs slowly sails out to sea with Meatlug, but Meatlug quickly begins to feel sea sick and vomits lava, causing the ship to immediately sink. Fishlegs quickly changes his mind about accepting the offer.\nThey both head off to the Academy where the competition is about to start. Just as the flag is about to be dropped, Stoick is suddenly heard screaming Hiccup's name: he has returned earlier than expected. Stoick appears to be in shock to see that this is not the Regatta he'd expected. Hiccup explains that he sometimes has to make difficult choices for the good of the people, and one of those difficult choices is replacing the traditional Regatta event with Dragon Racing. Stoick asks if he did this all by himself, and Hiccup, seeing the other riders awkwardly looking away, has no choice but to agree. Instead of punishing Hiccup for contradicting his order, Stoick allows him to proceed with the event but only if they do it right. Both teams put on face paint, with green paint for team Snotnuts, and red paint for team 'Hicclegs' (which Fishlegs came up with). Stoick explains that it gives the competitors and the game a warrior's feel to it.\nStoick announces to the crowd around the academy the start of the first annual Berk Dragon Race and explains that each white sheep is worth one point, while the Black Sheep is worth five. To make sure no cheating happens (looking particularly at the twins), Stoick appoints Astrid as the referee. Stoick then proclaims that the team who wins the race will have their portrait hung in the Great Hall, and a feast thrown in their honor. Gothi drops the flag and the race is started.\nSnotlout quickly manages to grab one sheep, while Hiccup grabs one as well, and the Twins grab two and boast about it to Hiccup. But Fishlegs arrives bringing two sheep. Both teams drop off their sheep at the Academy. Hiccup spots a sheep placed on a raft out on the water, but Snotlout arrives to grab it. Hiccup quickly sets Toothless' tail to boost their speed and is able to snatch the sheep before Snotlout does. Meanwhile, the twins attempt to cheat by stealing sheep that are not Silent Sven's to quickly double their points, but Astrid arrives before they can grab any. Tuffnut protests that \"not cheating is not trying\"; Astrid has Stormfly drive them off.\nMeanwhile, Fishlegs and Hiccup spot a sheep on a mountain and Fishlegs attempts to grab it, but it jumps down causing it to slide down the side. It falls into a crevasse, but luckily Hiccup and Toothless were already there to rescue it. When it is proclaimed by Astrid that the teams are all tied up, Stoick announces that whoever finds the black sheep wins. The Twins quietly talk to each other about putting their 'Super Secret Plan' into action. Fishlegs then has an idea where the black sheep might be, recalling what Sven said earlier about the black sheep always falling into the well. Fishlegs volunteers to go down the well and look for it, while Hiccup waits overhead. The Twins then fly by with the black sheep which shocks Hiccup.\nThis causes team Snotnuts to win the race, and Snotlout cheers excitedly over his teams' victory. Although disappointed, Hiccup applauds with the crowd. Hiccup congratulates Snotlout, who gloats about it and mocks Hiccup. But just as they are about to take their victory, Fishlegs arrives with the real black sheep, confusing everybody. Sven tells Stoick that there is only one black sheep and Team Snotnuts claims that they have it. Tuffnut then nuzzles the sheep's side with his face and reveals that they had cheated, by painting a regular sheep with black paint. A reversal is announced by Astrid, swapping the victory from Team Snotnuts to Team Hiclegs, making them the first official champions in Dragon Racing. The event closes when Toothless shoots three plasma blasts overhead, dazzling the crowd. Then Stoick finally relieves Hiccup from being the 'acting chief' and Hiccup quickly sets off before his father can change his mind.\nThe flashback ends and it goes back to the present time, with Hiccup concluding that it technically was Tuffnut who invented Dragon Racing (because he was the one came up with the concepts of the rules) humiliating the three of them, especially Snotlout, who is deeply depressed. Hiccup tries to cheer up Snotlout by saying that he played a part in it, and that the cheating was all him. As Snotlout happily claims that he did cheat, the Twins interrupt that Snotlout actually did not know what they were doing, and knew nothing about the secret plan. When Hiccup just tells them that they should say that they all invented Dragon Racing the Twins reluctantly accept, but Tuffnut still claims that Snotlout did nothing. Furious, Snotlout launches a sheep at Tuffnut, and points out that at least he invented the Sheep Launcher. Then a horn is heard, signalling that it is time for the Dragon Race and all the Riders quickly set off to start.\nHaving gone from being Dragon Riders to Dragon Racers, thanks to them a new generation of Berk's traditional events was born.", "tmdb_plot": "A hunt for a lost sheep turns into a competition between Hiccup and friends as they compete to become the first Dragon Racing champion of Berk.", "tmdb_id": "298115", "wiki_id": "44031959"}, {"title": "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes", "genres": ["Science Fiction", "Action", "Drama", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Years after the global pandemic of a deadly Simian Flu, the worldwide human population is drastically reduced, with only about one in 500 genetically immune. This causes societal collapse among humans. The apes, all bestowed with genetically enhanced intelligence by the virus, establish a colony in the Muir Woods near San Francisco.\nA group of humans, led by a man named Malcolm, trespass the apes' territory, in search of a hydroelectric dam that would restore power to San Francisco. An encounter with the apes, ends with a man named Carver badly hurting the ape Ash. Malcolm manages to prevent further escalation, and Caesar, the apes' leader, orders the humans to leave. Prompted by Koba, a scarred bonobo, Caesar brings his army to the humans' community as a display of strength. Caesar announces to the community that, despite the apes not wanting war, he will fight the humans if he is forced to. He demands the humans to stay in their territory. Malcolm convinces his fellow leader Dreyfus to give him time to take a small team to the forest, reconcile with the apes and access the dam. Eventually, Caesar allows them to work on the generator on the condition that they surrender their guns. While working together, Malcolm, his wife Ellie, and his son Alexander bond with the apes. The fragile relationship briefly falls apart when Carver is discovered to have kept a hidden gun and is thus forcibly sent away, but it is greatly restored when Ellie, a nurse, effectively treats Caesar's wife Cornelia's illness.\nDreyfus arms his community with the Fort Point armory. Koba, who has a vendetta against humans for his mistreatment as a laboratory test subject, discovers the armory and confronts Caesar, accusing him of loving humans more than apes. Caesar beats Koba in response but refrains from killing him. Koba later returns to the armory, kills two guards, and secretly kills Carver after the humans succeed in repairing the generator. Koba takes advantage of their celebration to covertly set fire to the apes' home. He then shoots Caesar, who falls into an underbrush. Koba frames the humans for Caesar's apparent death and the fire to justify war. Taking command, he leads the ape army to San Francisco, where they plunder the armory and mount a full-scale assault on the humans. Despite taking heavy casualties, the apes breach the building and imprison the humans as Dreyfus flees underground. While refusing orders to kill unarmed humans, Ash cites Caesar's teachings, and Koba throws him to his death. He also has any other ape who is loyal to Caesar imprisoned, including Maurice, Luca, and Rocket.\nMalcolm's family finds a severely wounded Caesar and transports him to his former house in San Francisco. After sneaking back into the settlement to find medical supplies, Malcolm encounters Blue Eyes, Caesar's son. Blue Eyes spares him before learning that his father is still alive and accompanies Malcolm to Caesar's place. After learning that it was Koba who shot Caesar, Blue Eyes reconciles with his father, returns to the tower and frees every human and ape imprisoned there. After escorting the apes into the tower, Malcolm finds Dreyfus. Apparently, the return of electricity allowed Dreyfus' men to make radio contact with survivors from a military base, who are now coming to fight the apes. Caesar confronts Koba at the top of the tower; as they fight, Dreyfus, in a suicide mission, detonates bombs that destabilize the building in a failed attempt to kill the apes. Willing to shoot at the apes that want to help Caesar, Koba eventually loses. While clinging to a metal girder, he is disowned as an ape by Caesar and dropped to his death.\nMalcolm warns Caesar of the approaching human military.

On the way, he discovers that Wirepa and his men have entered the Dead Lands, an area where any who venture in are believed to be killed by a monster known as a Taniwha in Maori mythology. Hongi, suspecting that the monster is in fact a man, tracks him down and, although reluctant, the monster agrees to help Hongi hunt down Wirepa. The monster is in fact a warrior (who is never named in the film) who murdered all the men of his own tribe, and he kills anyone who ventures there to prevent his tribe's historic lands from being occupied. The warrior is motivated by a desire to redeem himself and thus be led to the afterlife by his vengeful ancestors.\nWhile tracking down Wirepa, Hongi has a series of visions of his long dead grandmother, who helps them on their way. Hongi and the warrior track down Wirepa and kill several of his men before Wirepa flees with his surviving warriors.

The zombies chase after him, and their commander, Herzog, tenaciously holds on to Martin's car as he flees. An oncoming truck slices off Herzog's arm, which remains in the car with Martin.\nAfter Martin passes out at the wheel and is involved in an accident, he wakes in a hospital. The police disbelieve his wild stories about zombies and charge him with the murder of his friends. To his horror, Martin finds that a surgeon has attached Herzog's arm to his stump (believing it to be Martin's). The zombie arm goes berserk and attacks everyone within reach. After Martin kills several people against his will, he is sedated and strapped tightly to the bed. In the meantime, Herzog has his lost arm replaced and begins to conscript more zombie troops by resurrecting freshly killed locals.\nBobby, a young American tourist, sneaks into Martin's room when he hears rumors of a zombie attack. Impressed with Martin's zombie arm, Bobby frees Martin and tells him about the Zombie Squad, American professional zombie hunters. Before Bobby can contact them, the zombie arm throws Bobby out a window. Panicked, Martin follows and administers CPR, but the zombie arm instead crushes Bobby's chest, killing him.

In the meantime, they ask Martin to find out what Herzog wants.\nAt a World War II museum, Martin meets Glenn Kenneth, the souvenir shop's clerk. After the zombie arm intimidates him, Glenn takes Martin to the museum, where they read about Herzog's history: Herzog was originally tasked by Hitler himself to wipe out Talvik for their anti-Nazi sabotage. As Martin realizes Herzog intends to carry out his orders, Herzog and his Nazi zombies attack a group of tourists outside, and following the slaughter, Herzog has his troops arm themselves with old weapons from the museum, including a World War II-era Tiger tank.

After shooting at them with the tank gun several times, Herzog continues on his way, believing Blake, Glenn and Monica to be dead. Meanwhile, the others discover the graveyard, and Martin raises an entire troop of loyal Russian zombies. All converge at the town, where Martin confronts Herzog. Martin points out that they have evacuated the townspeople and thus prevented Herzog from completing his orders, but Herzog does not care and attacks them.\nThe battle goes well at first, but the Nazi zombies eventually overpower Martin's Russian zombies after Herzog kills the Russian Commander, Lt Stavarin. As the Nazi zombies close in on them, Daniel tells Martin to kill Herzog, as it is their only chance. Daniel attempts to take control of the Nazi zombie's tank, Martin directly confronts Herzog, and the others fight Herzog's remaining zombies.

During the police chase, they get separated; Babban escapes, Khalujaan is injured, and the necklace seemingly lost. Babban goes to meet his boss Mushtaq Bhai (Salman Shahid), who disbelieves him, accuses him of double-crossing his boss in cahoots with his uncle Khaalujaan, gives him a death sentence, and orders him to dig his own grave. Babban duly begins to dig a grave under supervision, but manages to escape, with the promise that he will bring back both the necklace and Khaalujaan.\nMonths later, Babban comes across Khalujaan, who is posing as a Nawab and attending a poetry contest. It is a mushaira (gathering of poets) organised by Begum Para (Madhuri Dixit), the widowed Begum of Majidabad, supposedly in compliance with the wishes of her deceased husband. The winner of the poetry contest will not only win the widowed Begum as his bride, and also become the Nawab of Majidabad.\nBabban confronts Khalujaan on the opening night of the contest, and tries to get him to return with him. However, Babban himself delays departure after falling in love at first sight with Muniya (Huma Qureshi), Begum Para's beautiful maid and constant companion. Meanwhile, Khalujaan has his task cut out. He needs to fool the gathering into accepting him as an aristocrat of high lineage, win the poetry contest if possible, and seduce the Begum whether or not that happens. One of the other contestants is a local politician and gangster named Jaan Mohammed (Vijay Raaz), who is holding the poet Nawab Italwi (Manoj Pahwa) in captivity, forcing him to write poetry for Jaan to recite at the contest. The contest proceeds; while Khalujaan has his heart set on Begum Para herself, Babban is smitten with Muniya. Khalujaan tries to impress the Begum by gifting her the prized necklace which he had stolen earlier, but on the final day, Begum declares Jaan Mohammed to be the victor. She declares that she will marry Jaan Mohammad and that he will become the new Nawab of Majidabad.\nSince the necklace has clearly failed to move the Begum, Khaalujaan decides to see if a gun will serve the purpose better. However, even as he approaches the Begum brandishing his chosen instrument of persuasion, he finds the dowager being hustled away at gunpoint by a masked man. Khalujaan chases them and blocks their way only to discover that the masked man is none other than his nephew Babban. It turns out that the Begum had plotted her own kidnapping in order to extort money from the nawab-elect (Jaan Mohammad). More twists are then revealed: the Begum was nothing but a dancing-girl (courtesan) who had seduced a middle-aged nawab and married him, only to find that the nawab was actually a pauper who supported his lavish way of life by selling his inherited properties and jewels. He also neglected his wife, who (it is very strongly suggested) developed a relationship of intimacy with a sympathetic maid-servant, Muniya.\nBy the time the nawab died of good living, he had become completely bankrupt and even his palace had been mortgaged to the money-lenders. After his death, the penniless Begum had been helped financially and courted actively by Jaan Mohammad, who was besotted with her. He also wanted the title and status of being the \"Nawab of Majidabad.\" If a mere dancing-girl could marry an aging nawab and swan around being feted and fawned over as Begum of Majidabad, then Jaan Mohammad, of a similar social background, could likewise climb into the same status by marrying the same girl, now a dowager. The Begum was appalled by this idea. Jaan Mohammad is a man of low birth and uncultured mannerisms, a former street-thug turned politician, with an entourage of sycophantic hoodlums. The idea of marrying such a man was repellent to the Begum, who was anyway in love with her maid-servant. Yet, Jaan Mohammad's debt and his persistence leave the Begum with no choice but to announce a competition for her suitors, as a tactic to delay responding to Jaan's advances.\nThus, the mushiara was conceived of an elaborate hoax: the late Nawab had never wanted that his widow should marry someone else, much less that the winner should be recognized as \"Nawab of Majidabad.\" It was the Begum's own idea, the purpose being to snare a rich man and marry him. The Begum did not want to marry Jaan Mohammad, but she wanted his money, therefore she was staging a kidnapping in order to receive a ransom from Jaan Mohammad. She has employed Babban to act as her kidnapper and extort a hefty ransom from Jaan Mohammad, who was expected to pay up because otherwise he would never fulfill his dream of becoming a Nawab.\nBabban duly phones Jaan Mohammed (who is by now aware of the Begum's cunning plan) to bring a ransom of Rs. 100 million (100 million rupees, about $2 million in 2014) in cash to the railway station. All four of them (Begum, maid, and the uncle-nephew duo) reach the railway station to collect the money, but find that they are surrounded by Jaan Mohammad's goons. To their good fortune, Nawab Italwi arrives with a police force and cross-firing ensues. Begum and Muniya escape from the situation, leaving Babban and Khalujaan behind to be arrested.\nTwo months later, the uncle-nephew duo get bail and, as they leave the jail, they are given a letter from Begum and Muniya. It is a cheeky letter of thanks and goodbye from the women, informing the men that they have sold the priceless necklace and used the proceeds to buy a house and settle down in a faraway town whose name they withhold.

Waterhouse then holds Proctor at gunpoint and demands he get rid of his badge, telling Proctor that he's no longer fit to be sheriff. Proctor throws his badge over the cliff.\nIn the 1970s, Jacqueline Mathers, called Jake, and her brother Sean head to the quarry. Sean insists she get over her fear of jumping into the water below and offers to jump with her. Sean jumps but Jake becomes scared and lets go of Sean's hand at the last second. Jake watches as her brother plunges into the water below but doesn't resurface. In a panic, she runs for help, tripping along the way and gashing her forehead, which leaves a large scar. Deputy Freeman informs Waterhouse, now the sheriff, that his grandson has drowned in the quarry.\nJake suffers from survivor's remorse and falls into depression.

Wyeth tells her he has the power to bring her brother back but someone will have to die in his place. The brothers take her back to their cabin on Proctor's property and make a blood oath with Jake - they'll bring her brother back if she pushes Willie Proctor over the quarry edge. She agrees. When she returns home after dark, her parents question her about where she's been. She tells them three men took her to their cabin. Waterhouse takes Jake to the cabin and asks Jake to identify the three brothers but, remembering her oath, Jake says she's never seen them before.\nJake convinces Willie to follow her to the quarry. She's about to push him over but is filled with guilt and decides not to. Jake's mother attempts to make Jake feel better by taking her to dinner where Jake is confronted by Wyeth.

She becomes frightened and blood begins to pour from between her legs. Later, Waterhouse is told by the doctor that his daughter will live but the baby can't be saved. Filled with remorse, Jake brings the necklace to Wyeth who tells her she can only bring Sean back if she sacrifices Willie. He puts the necklace around her neck. Waterhouse arrests the three gypsy brothers and takes them to jail. A desperate Jake convinces Willie to follow her to the quarry one more time.

Proctor returns to the cabin with food only to be confronted by the husband who beats him and runs him off. Proctor returns with Waterhouse and kills the father. As Waterhouse protests, the mother shoots at the two policemen. Waterhouse shoots back and fatally wounds her. Proctor shoots the father in the head and aims at Wyeth before Waterhouse stops him. Wyeth kneels over his mother, who whispers something to him before dying.

Upon turning 16, children undergo a serum-induced psychological aptitude test which indicates their best-suited faction, but can choose any faction as their permanent group at the subsequent Choosing Ceremony.\nBeatrice Prior was born into Abnegation, which runs the government. Her father Andrew serves on the ruling council along with Abnegation's leader Marcus Eaton. After her test results show equal attributes of multiple factions (Abnegation, Erudite, and Dauntless), marking her as Divergent, her proctor Tori Wu, a Dauntless woman, records her results as Abnegation, warns her to conceal her true results, and says that because Divergents can think independently and sense any serums injected into them, the government feels they threaten the existing social order.\nThe next day, at the Choosing Ceremony, Beatrice's brother Caleb chooses Erudite, while, after some hesitation, she chooses Dauntless.

Sawyer, now aged fourteen, is offered a scholarship to the elite SEA Semester program, which involves three months at sea doing marine mammal research, after impressing his cousin Kyle's advisor Dr. Miguel Arroyo when champion surfer Bethany Hamilton swims with him and Winter. Sawyer is reluctant to go because he is concerned about leaving Winter.\nWinter needs attention and shows signs of stress and loneliness, especially after her older companion, Panama, dies from old age. Acting on Rufus's erratic behavior one morning, Sawyer and Hazel find and rescue a sea turtle from some fishing line. Rufus becomes obsessed with the sea turtle, named Mavis, to the point he even watches her during a CT scan at the hospital where Lorraine works.\nGeorge Hatton, a USDA inspector, insists that Winter must be matched with a new companion within 30 days or be transferred elsewhere. However, Winter's behavior has become unpredictable, even dangerous; when Sawyer tries to get her out of the tank to prepare to make her a new prosthetic tail, she becomes aggressive and knocks him into the water, injuring him. Dr. Clay prohibits Sawyer from swimming with Winter until further notice. Winter spends weeks in isolation, and despite people not being allowed to visit her, Sawyer allows Susie, a new volunteer, and her grandfather to see her. Hazel, who has feelings for Sawyer, becomes slightly jealous due to Sawyer getting attention from another girl.\nSawyer and Hazel hope Mandy will become Winter's companion. Mandy's rehabilitation at CMA goes well, so Clay contemplates releasing her soon, causing alarm for Hazel in particular.

Hazel assertively yet respectfully asks Clay to let her view Mandy's medical records, which he does. Clay, Sawyer, and Hazel test Mandy's readiness by giving her three live fish, which she catches effortlessly, so they reluctantly decide they must release her. Clay puts Hazel in charge of her release.\nSawyer and Hazel break the rules and swim with Winter, who appears to be feeling better. Clay finds them doing so and scolds them, but then states that it does not matter, because George issued an order that Winter be transferred to a marine park in Texas. Meanwhile, Lorraine and Sawyer's friends arrange a going-away party for Sawyer's anticipated participation in SEA Semester, although he still cannot decide whether to go. Dr. McCarthy shows him an old watch which must be tapped to keep ticking, and so encourages Sawyer to \"shake it up now and then\" and try new things in life.\nDuring the party, Clay is informed that another female dolphin has been rescued and is headed to CMA; one so young that she has not yet learned how to hunt and cannot return to the wild. This offers new hope of companionship for Winter, so they name her \"Hope\".

He was called \"Vlad the Impaler, Son of the Dragon\", after slaughtering thousands by impaling them on spears, but became sickened by his own acts and abandoned his past.\nNow ruling his domains in peace, Vlad and his soldiers discover a helmet in a stream and fear that an Ottoman scouting party is preparing the way for invasion. The stream leads to Broken Tooth Mountain, the top of which has a cave carpeted in crushed bone. Within the cave, they are attacked in the dark by an inhumanly strong and fast humanoid creature, killing Vlad's retinue. Vlad barely escapes and returns to his castle, where he learns from a local monk that the creature is a vampire, a Roman from the days of the Empire named Caligula, who was tricked by a demon for personal success and great powers, but was trapped in the cave as the price for this. Vlad celebrates an Easter feast with his wife Mirena and son \u00cengera\u0219, when an Ottoman contingent arrives at the castle.

If he resists the intense urge to drink human blood for three days, he will turn back into a human. Otherwise, he will remain a vampire forever, and the ancient vampire will be freed, the seal on his cave broken by having given the darkness a worthy offering to plague the world like himself.

However, with the beasts vanquished, the humans and elves eventually came into conflict with each other, thereby remaining unaware that evil begins to thrive and gain strength again within the Dark Mountains, all centered on a gem of power embedded in the chest of the sleeping Black Dragon Karas, under whose influence the beasts have united into an army.\nA cocky, adventurous human boy named Lambert and his dogs One and Two have a run-in with a large beast band on a raid. Just before they end up killed, they are saved by a trio of famous adventurers: Barnac, a famous mercenary and captain of a flying ship; Geraint, a famous dragon fighter; and Argenta, Geraint's sister. They proceed to the human kingdom of Saint Heaven, to which two Elven maidens, Princess Nerwin and her companion Liya, have secretly travelled to beseech the king for an alliance against the beasts. While trying to get himself a sword, Lambert encounters Liya and ends teaming up with her and his heroic companions against a band of beasts attacking the city, holding them off until the Imperial Knights under Velskud can bring the situation under control. With evidence of the new threat on his literal doorstep, the terrified king finally agrees to the alliance.\nWhile the newly-found allies gather their forces, Liya spots a shadow near the king's dining hall and follows it, accompanied by Lambert. There, they sneak into a meeting between the king, Terramai (his priest and advisor), Karacule (a sorceress), Nerwin, Barnac, Geraint, Argenta, and Velskud discussing the threat of Karas and the gem forming both his base of power and his most vulnerable spot. An argument over who should assume custody of the gem breaks out until Lambert interrupts them with a plan for a combined diversionary attack and infiltration, upon which - although the plan is accepted - he and Liya are kicked out. However, by listening in they learn that the gem's dark power corrupts those of weak heart and will therefore have to be destroyed.\nLater that night, Velskud is joined by Princess Elena, a Dark Elf who desires the gem for herself and the infiltrator Liya saw earlier. Velskud, seduced by Elena's promises to be made ruler of all Alteria, kills the king before joining the other heroes for the secret mission. Lambert, who also comes along with Liya, receives a sword from an old blacksmith in return for holding onto One and Two until his return.

Forced to cross them following one of Lambert's mishaps, they are discovered and taunted by a bat scout serving the Black Dragon. When Velskud attacks it, it tries to slip away to the Dark Mountains before the heroes manage to kill it. As the journey continues, Lambert and Liya develop a romantic interest in each other, and Geraint and Argenta are shown to hide a secret connected to the Dragon's gem. Using this link, Geraint finds and unseals a secret entrance to the Dragon's lair in the wall of a glacier, but while traversing the ice ravine beyond the door, they are ambushed by Karas' beast guardians. They escape by collapsing the exit, but Geraint and Argenta stay behind, and Geraint uses the power of the gem in his chest to awaken a giant beast frozen in the ice. They escape and reunite with the others.\nThe companions do not make it in time before the Alliance begins its attack, causing Karas to awaken. The beasts fighting against the Alliance retreat but run into Lambert's group. In the ensuing confusion, Liya and Lambert are left behind and forced to fight the monsters by themselves. When Lambert is about to get eaten by a beast, Liya uses her last arrow to save him, sacrificing herself.

Geraint uses his secret power to transform into a Golden Dragon and save his companions, but accidentally hurts Karacule in the process.

The others, seeing Geraint's dragon form, start to distrust the siblings, claiming that dragons need to be killed.\nKaras appears and attacks, and is immediately engaged by Geraint. As they fly above Lambert, he notices the glowing gem on Karas\u2019 chest, and remembering what was said about it - including that it holds the power to raise the dead - he decides to get it for Liya. He jumps onto Karas as he flies past and climbs his way up to the chest. The others join in to dislodge the dark gem, and Argenta transforms into a Silver Dragon to help her brother. By combining their powers, they are eventually able to detach the dark gem from Karas, killing the monster at last.\nLambert demands the gem from Geraint in order to resurrect Liya, but Geraint warns him from touching it, for fear that its power will corrupt him, and instead gives him his own gem.

Instead, he becomes an instructor at a driving school, while waiting for an investment opportunity to open a racing school. After he drops his daughter off to school and learns that he can no longer afford her private school tuition, he takes a fellow American as his first client. The man, Simon Keller, reveals that he has investigated Roberts' finances and personal life. Disturbed, Roberts insists on ending the lesson and returning to the school. Keller agrees but requests that they stop at a bank first, so that he can pay Roberts.\nAs Keller exits the bank, he opens fire on the guards, drops a bag into the car, and demands that Roberts serve as his getaway driver. Roberts protests in disbelief and attempts to surrender to the police, who open fire on him, too. Roberts reluctantly drives off and evades the police. Keller offers to share a percentage of his loot, but the panicked Roberts insists that he is now going to end up in jail. Keller assures him that the police will not pursue them, as the bank is owned and managed by a criminal syndicate with connections to the local police. Rossi, Keller's former associate, had previously betrayed him in the United States and then joined the Australian syndicate.\nRossi calls off the police and hires mercenaries to kill them. However, Agent Walker of the Australian Federal Police takes charge of the investigation over the objections of the corrupt Detective Chief Inspector Smith. Walker immediately threatens Rossi and Smith, both of whom she suspects to be part of the syndicate. Meanwhile, Keller and Roberts argue over Roberts' disappointment in his life, which Keller states is the result of giving up on his dreams. Upset, Roberts refuses to drive any further, and Keller shoots him with a rubber bullet.

In response, Roberts briefly holds Keller at gunpoint with the elderly woman's pistol, but he surrenders it when he realizes that it is empty.\nResigned to his fate as the getaway driver, Roberts offers to drive Keller to his final destination, a marina.

When Roberts antagonizes a motorcycle gang, they become hostile and threaten to kill him. Keller saves his life, and, during the confrontation, the gang reveal themselves to be mercenaries in Rossi's pay.

As a result of the trauma he sustained under torture, Lake is now suffering from early stage frontotemporal dementia, and his boss considers him a liability to the agency.\nIn Bucharest, police tail a Kenyan national, Abdi, carrying a mysterious USB drive. A car chase ensues, and rather than giving himself up, the courier throws himself and the drive off a bridge.

Milt gets a hit on large quantities of an experimental drug treating thalassemia, information corroborated in the USB data. The drugs are for an anonymous Kenyan client, and are coming from a University of Bucharest clinic run by Professor Dr. Iulian Cornel. Since thalassemia is hereditary, Milt concludes that Banir is ordering shipments of the drug through a middleman, Dr. Wangari. He tells Lake, who asks his superiors to go after Banir.

By 2020, the United Defense Force (UDF), a global military alliance established to combat the alien threat, finally achieves a victory over the Mimics at Verdun using newly developed mech-suits. In Britain, the UDF plans a major invasion of France, and General Brigham orders recently attached public affairs officer Major William \"Bill\" Cage to cover it. Cage, having no combat experience, objects and threatens to blame Brigham if the invasion fails. Brigham has Cage arrested and sent to Heathrow Airport, now a military base. Cage awakens to find Brigham has demoted him to a private and falsely labelled him a deserter. He is assigned to Master Sergeant Farell and the misfit J-Squad, all of whom dislike and belittle him.\nOn the morning of the invasion, Farell and J-Squad are quickly killed by the Mimics who were somehow aware of their planned invasion and ambushed them. Cage uses a Claymore mine to kill an unusually large blue Mimic but is mortally wounded by the explosion and covered in the alien's blood. Cage jolts awake to find himself back at Heathrow, reliving the previous morning. His attempts to warn Farell against the invasion are ignored and he experiences the loop of dying on the beach and waking at Heathrow repeatedly.

Upon seeing his preternatural talent, Vrataski realizes Cage can loop time and orders him to find her the next time he wakes up.\nCage reawakens and locates Vrataski, who takes him to Dr. Carter, an expert in Mimic biology. He explains that the Mimics are a superorganism in which the \"Omega\" controls the cerebrum, while the \"Alphas\" behave as the ganglia through which the Omega controls ordinary Mimics; if an Alpha is terminated, the Omega resets the day and adjusts its tactics until the battle is won. Cage inadvertently \"hijacked\" their ability to reset time through his exposure to an Alpha's blood. Vrataski had this ability at Verdun, using it to win the battle before she was wounded and received a blood transfusion, losing the power. She tells Cage to locate and kill the Omega to end the alien invasion.\nOver many more loops, Vrataski trains Cage to excel in combat. After a frustrating lesson, Cage escapes to London, only to discover that the Mimics will attack there next after the invasion. After seeing visions of a dam in Switzerland where the Omega is hiding and spending many loops figuring how to escape the invasion and reach the dam, Cage grows closer to Vrataski, but she is only interested in the mission. Cage flies to the dam alone upon reaching a point where Vrataski is killed no matter what they do. The Omega is not there and he is ambushed by an Alpha who attempts to strip him of his ability to reset time, but Cage deliberately drowns himself.\nCage and Vrataski infiltrate the Ministry of Defence, where Cage convinces Brigham to give him Carter's prototype device (which he had confiscated from him and had him sent to a psych ward) that can locate the Omega, but they are pursued by military police on leaving. During the ensuing car chase, Cage uses the device and discovers the Omega is under the Louvre Pyramid in Paris.

After hours, an unknown killer sneaks into the studio and kills lead actor Claudio Calvetti and his girlfriend Veronica while they view a workprint of the film. Actress Margarit Porfiry stumbles upon Veronica's hanging body and is stricken with hysterical blindness. Her husband, Police Inspector Peter Porfiry, interviews studio employees.\nClaudio's co-star Cal Konitz has his dreams of a larger role in the film are dashed when Mancini introduces Cesare, a lookalike stand-in to replace Claudio. Meanwhile, Police Chief O'Connor pressures Porfiry into closing the case, since Margarit is his daughter. Porfiry begins suspecting Rey, since the victims' fingers were crudely severed in much the same manner as Rey's. Porfiry interviews Mancini, and learns that Rey was once instituted in an asylum.\nBack at the studio, Cesare is murdered in the shower and his fingers are severed. With Cesare dead, Francesco instructs Rey to re-cut the film to make Cal the new star. Porfiry questions Rey about his time in the asylum, and Rey recounts how his start in the business as an editor for acclaimed art house director Umberto Fantori, Bella's father, whose debut film The Mirror and the Guillotine earned him critical acclaim and introduced him to his wife, star Josephine Jardin. When his wife was fired by Mancini on her next film, the pressures of editing Fantori's next project, the world's longest film, mounted and Rey accidentally cut off his own fingers in a fit of madness. What Rey doesn't tell him is that he's found what appears to be footage of the murders, taken by an unknown third party. The interview over, Rey returns to work in the editing suite with Bella, where she confesses her love for him, but Rey resists her because he is married. Porfiry, meanwhile, is introduced to Cal's girlfriend Jasmine, who reveals that the two were once lovers. Porfiry remains oblivious to the bladed instruments in Cal's car.\nThat night after another argument with his wife, Rey has a vision of a dark man with bright blue eyes stalking him from the shadows in his room. Porfiry, meanwhile, infiltrates the asylum where Rey was institutionalized, and meets the director Dr. Casini. Casini tells Porfiry that Rey attempted to kill his assistant Giuseppe, who is now a patient at the asylum himself, his head mysteriously wrapped in bandages. Casini explains to Porfiry Plato's Allegory of the Cave; of men who spend their entire lives believing shadows on the wall to be living, breathing beings.\nPorfiry returns him to find that Margarit now has a seeing-eye German Shepherd named Rolfie. After the two make love, the killer breaks into their home and traps Porfiry outside of his room, separated from Margarit. Porfiry break the door down using an axe, but the killer throws Margarit in the way as a body shield, killing her. Porfiry stages the scene to exonerate himself, cutting off Margarit fingers and feeding them to Rolfie. Giancarlo arrives and holds Porfiry at gunpoint, but the Porfiry feeds him alcohol and confuses him into supporting Porfiry's narrative about the incident.\nO'Connor berates Porfiry over Margarit's death, and the killer calls him at the station to taunt him. Porfiry convinces O'Connor into supporting a plan where Giancarlo goes undercover as the new editor on Tarantola. Rey meanwhile, has been suffering from blackouts and hallucinations, and finding a bloodied shirt in his editing suite, begins to suspect himself as the killer. Mancini fires him and replaces him with Giancarlo, Rey dejectedly returns home to find Josephine obsessively watching Cal's demo tape. Burning the bloodied shirt in the kitchen sink, Rey begins having strange, otherworldly visions involving Bella; glimpsing a Lovecraftian netherworld filled with massive film reels and boiling tar.

He rushes to the studio, but arrives too late.\nTrying to complete the film without any prior filmmaking knowledge, Giancarlo is beset by venomous tarantulas in the editing suite and is disemboweled by the killer. Over-schedule and over-budget, Mancini rehires Rey to finish the film, Rey revealing that he'd already completed his assembly cut before being fired. Mancini is ecstatic and the film is saved. Porfiry, convinced Rey is the killer, confronts Father Clarke, who tries to tell him his conviction is misguided. He explains an old, Roman-era superstition that editors were believed to be bridges to the netherworld.\nCal, learning that Rey has cut him from the film completely, threatens to kill Rey with a chainsaw. Rey points out that Cal blinks incessantly whenever he tries acting, which lets Rey know that Cal's bluffing. Cal leaves in a huff, but vows to still have his revenge. He tells Porfiry that Rey is a madman, and Porfiry mentions his suspicion that Rey may have ties to the occult, telling Cal that the best way to get to Rey is through his wife. Rey returns home to a ransacked living room with only the television intact. Viewing Cal's demo reel, the Betamax tape suddenly comes to life and begins breathing. Cal kidnaps Rey and forces him to watch him rape Josephine despite Rey's pleas, but Josephine reveals that she's been having an affair with him and plans to leave Rey. That night, Jasmine and Cal are killed during sex by a chainsaw.\nWhile researching the occult at the library, Porfiry is beset by tarantulas. Porfiry brings his findings to Father Clarke, insisting that Rey is the killer. Clarke retorts the Rey is a righteous man, who volunteered to fix the masonry in the broken church bell tower years ago, allowing the bell to keep ringing. Porfiry stumbles across Cal's dead body, and breaks into Rey's house in a fit of rage, only to find occult literature and a film reel filled with severed fingers. Taking this as confirmation of Rey's guilt, Porfiry sets out in search of Rey. Rey is struck by another vision, crawling out of his editing machine covered in tar with bright blue eyes, thus matching the appearance of the killer in his dreams. Porfiry chases Rey by car over a cliff. Rey flees on foot and makes his way to Mancini's mansion, but Porfiry catches up and holds him at gunpoint. Porfiry shoots Rey, but upon turning around is shocked to find Josephine performing an occult ritual; sacrificing Mancini and revealing herself as the true killer. Josephine proclaims herself an incarnation of Death, Porfiry tries to shoot her but she causes his gun to backfire, blowing off the fingers on his right hand. Rey lights his wooden hand on fire and grabs Josephine, setting her ablaze and killing her. In the aftermath, Porfiry reveals that Cal confessed to killing Cesare for a better part in the film, and the two go their separate ways on good terms.\nThe next day, Porfiry returns to work at police station, but quickly becomes confused by strange incongruities surrounding him. Dr. Casini is the staff psychiatrist and Jasmine is his nurse, Josephine and Rey were never together, Giancarlo is alive and a full Inspector who solved the case, and Porfiry's injuries are now only minor. Confused, Porfiry rushes to the church to speak to Father Clarke, who tells him that the belfry has remained damaged and the bell hasn't rung in over 100 years. Porfiry runs to the top of the tower, and digging through the damaged masonry finds a skull atop a stack of film reels.

When asked about the crime, Alice continually insists that she is innocent, a victim of Ronnie's machinations, including Ronnie planting her jack in the box at the scene of the murder to frame her. In flashback we see the girls walking home from a pool party, when Ronnie sees the baby unattended in a stroller on a porch. Despite Alice's pleas not to, Ronnie takes the baby and runs off with her, insisting to Alice that they can take better care of the baby and that it is theirs now.\nIn the present Ronnie is working at a bagel shop in town, while Alice spends most of her days apparently aimlessly walking around town eating junk food, but lying and telling her mother she is searching for employment as per her request. Alice also secretly dreams of finding validation through reality TV stardom, and is shown several times practicing a speech about being a \"victim\" of the justice system. Alice's mother Helen Manning is a teacher at the elementary school, and it is apparent she and her daughter have a contentious relationship. Helen is ashamed of Alice being overweight, her unsophisticated tastes, and her lack of interest in the kind of things Helen likes. It is also shown in flashback that before the kidnapping Alice and Ronnie were forced to hang out and go to the pool party together by Helen, who showed favoritism toward Ronnie in front of Alice.\nTwo weeks after Ronnie and Alice return home a couple are shopping in a furniture store with their young bi-racial daughter, Brittany Lyttle. While the couple are arguing about couches their daughter goes missing, prompting panic. The two detectives assigned to the case that come to visit the parents include detective Nancy Porter, who worked on the Fuller/Manning case, which still haunts and traumatizes her. Soon the connection between the current case and the previous kidnapping becomes apparent, including the resemblance between Brittany and the previous kidnap victim. Porter and her partner question both Alice and Ronnie. Ronnie is evasive and withdrawn, while Alice tries to subtly suggest Ronnie is responsible.\nPorter and her partner then dig into the girls' lives during juvenile hall and discover some disturbing truths. Ronnie tried to kill herself several times and frequently got into fights. But more alarmingly, it turns out Alice gave birth to a young bi-racial baby girl in prison. Bringing in both Alice and Helen for questioning, the truth begins to unravel. It turns out at age 15 in Juvenile Hall Alice fell into a sexual relationship with a janitor named Rodrigo who worked there, and who was eventually fired when their affair was uncovered. By the time Alice realized she was pregnant it was too late for her mother to force her to get an abortion, so instead she forced her into relinquishing the child for adoption. According to Helen, Alice remained fixated on her child, obsessing over it endlessly. In an attempt to placate Alice, Helen lied to her, saying that she had seen her child living with a family in a nice part of town. She said that the girl had beautiful curly hair, and had a heart shaped birthmark on her back. However, unknown to Helen, upon being released from prison, Alice reconnected with Rodrigo, the janitor who had previously impregnated her. Alice\u2019s supposedly aimless \"walking\" had actually been her combing the town, searching for her child. Upon seeing Brittany in the furniture store Alice took her and found that she had a heart-shaped birthmark on her back. Believing Brittany to be her child, Alice took her with the help of Rodrigo, who then took the child to stay at his mother\u2019s house. Their plan was to keep Brittany there while Alice framed Ronnie for the crime, after which they would go be with their child. After being shown birth certificates that proved Brittany was not her child, Alice was convinced by Porter to take her to Rodrigo's mother's house, where Porter collects Brittany. This is intercut with Ronnie at home in her bathroom, where still overwhelmed by guilt over the original kidnapping and murder, she commits suicide by slitting her wrists in the bathtub. Porter returns Brittany safely to her grateful and tearful parents.\nIt is revealed shortly after that Alice made a deal with the district attorney, and that all charges against her have been dropped while Rodrigo is arrested for the kidnapping and statutory rape. Porter and Jones watch in disgust and Alice revels in the media attention, and gives the speech she practiced about being an innocent victim of the justice system for the news cameras. Finally, the details of the ending of the first kidnapping are revealed. It shows Ronnie worrying about the baby, and begging Alice to let her take the baby back. Alice is then shown manipulating and forcing Ronnie into strangling the baby, running away as Ronnie does it. Horrified, Ronnie goes to Helen and confesses what has happened. Helen says that she can make sure that Alice is punished equally along with Ronnie, and we discover that it was Helen who gave Ronnie Alice's jack in the box, telling her to plant it at the scene of the crime.

She tells the two men of the prophecy, in which \"a leader\" (either Moses or Ramesses) will be \"saved\" and the savior \"will someday lead.\" During the battle, Moses saves Ramesses's life, leaving both men troubled. Later, Moses volunteers to go to the city of Pithom in place of his cousin to meet with the Viceroy Hegep, who oversees the Hebrew slaves. Upon his arrival, he encounters the slave Joshua being lashed and questions the vicious lashing. Moses is appalled by the horrific conditions the slaves must toil in. Moses meets with the slave elders to see if the slaves are planning on sedition as claimed by the Viceroy. After said meetings, Moses receives a message via Joshua that Nun is looking for him. Moses finds Nun in the prayer house where he informs him of his true lineage; he is the child of Hebrew parents who was sent by his sister Miriam to be raised by Pharaoh's daughter (he was born during the extermination of the Jewish heirs). Moses is stunned at the revelation and leaves angrily; during which he is attacked by two guards whom he quickly kills. However, two Hebrew spies overhear Nun's story and report their discovery to the Viceroy.\nMoses returns home where soon after Seti dies, and Ramesses becomes the new Pharaoh (Ramesses II). Hegep, the viceroy reveals Moses's true lineage to Ramesses, but Ramesses is unconvinced. At the urging of Queen Tuya, he interrogates the servant Miriam, who denies being Moses's sister. When Ramesses threatens to cut off her arm, Moses intervenes saving her and confirms he is a Hebrew. Although Tuya wants Moses killed, Ramesses, still unwilling to believe the story, exiles him instead. Before leaving Egypt, Moses meets with his adopted mother and Miriam, who refer to him by his birth name of Moshe. Following a journey into the desert, Moses comes to Midian where he meets Zipporah and her father, Jethro. Moses becomes a shepherd, marries Zipporah, and has a son, Gershom.\nYears later, Moses is injured in a rockslide. He encounters a burning bush and a boy, a messenger of the God of Abraham. While recovering, Moses reveals his past to Zipporah and reveals what God has asked him to do. This drives a wedge between the couple, but Moses leaves anyway. In Egypt, Moses reunites with Nun and Joshua, as well as meeting his brother Aaron for the first time. Moses confronts Ramesses, demanding the Hebrews be released from servitude. Ramesses refuses to listen, insisting that freeing them is economically impossible. Upon Moses threatening Ramesses's life, Ramesses orders Moses's death, as well as killing random Hebrew families until Moses is found. Using his military skills, Moses trains the slaves and leads them in an insurgency, prompting Ramesses to retaliate harshly. God's messenger appears to Moses and explains that ten plagues will affect Egypt. The first nine plagues deal massive damage to Egypt and its people, but Ramesses does not back down, even oppressing his own people to maintain his position. Moses is horrified to learn from God that the tenth plague will be the death of all firstborn children but follows through with the plan, instructing the Hebrews to protect themselves by covering their doors with lambs' blood. That night, all of Egypt's firstborn children die, including Ramesses's infant son. Ramesses, devastated, surrenders, allowing the Hebrews to leave.\nDuring the Exodus, the Hebrews follow Moses's original path through the desert towards the Red Sea. Still grieving his son, Ramesses assembles his army and gives chase. After making their way through a dangerous mountain pass, Moses and the Hebrews arrive at the edge of the sea, uncertain about what to do. In despair, Moses flings his sword into the sea, which recedes and clears a path to the opposite side. Ramesses and his army continue the pursuit, but Moses stays behind to confront them. The Red Sea reverts back, drowning the majority of the Egyptians who are still crossing. Moses survives and rejoins the Hebrews. Ramesses also survives, but is distraught and stunned over the destruction of his army, and with no apparent way to return to Egypt.

Terry has dropped Roth as a client and wants Roth's debts paid back within a week. Evelyn and Paul again request his help, and he agrees to listen to their story when they offer to buy him breakfast. Roth offers to deprogram Claire, a risky process that involves abducting her and confronting her with the truth about the cult. Roth hires two men to help him abduct Claire; one of them strikes her during the abduction. They take her to an isolated motel and prevent her from sleeping.\nAfter paying the men, Roth begins the process of deprogramming. Excited that she is being cooperative, he lets Claire momentarily see her parents, who are in an adjoining room, then lets her sleep (to go from \"feeling\" while sleep-deprived to \"thinking\" when well-rested and awake). When questioned the next day, Claire reveals that Faults has taught her how she exists separately from her body, and that members of the group advance to successive levels; she explains that their leader, Ira, has evolved to its top level and is \"no more.\" Paul becomes increasingly demanding and controlling of both the situation and his daughter, and Paul becomes enraged when Roth mediates. The deprogramming is interrupted when Mick locates Roth and again demands payment. Roth awkwardly requests half of his fee from Paul, who reluctantly agrees.

Roth is surprised to find Claire unconscious outside the hotel room. When he brings her back inside, her parents say she was locked in the bathroom; Claire claims to have teleported herself using meditation techniques learned from the cult.

Like the others, she sought treatment from Dr. Andover (Robert Englund), a brilliant scientist and doctor that developed a new way of treating fear-related ailments by way of his \"Fear Chamber\". Initially the treatments seemed to be a success, but years later the patients have all returned to the clinic due to their fears re-emerging worse than they had before. After urging from her best friend Megan (Cleopatra Coleman), Sara returns to the clinic as well. Andover is reluctant to resume treatment because one of his previous patients, Paige (Bonnie Morgan), died as a result of her treatment in the Fear Chamber. He ends up giving in due to both the patients and his assistant Osborn (Felisha Terrell) insistence that this is the only way to solve their problems. However he finds that his reluctance may have been well-founded as one of the patients, Caylee (Angelina Armani), vomits a black substance that gives Andover a strange vision once he touches the fluid. The vision shows a monstrous version of Paige that states that Andover's treatments opened a passage for a sinister being to come over and that all that it needs to finish its travels is for Andover to resume treatment and \"open the door\". Realizing that this is not Paige but the creature itself, he is shocked back to consciousness.\nWhile settling in, a new patient by the name of Blake (Thomas Dekker) arrives in the clinic. His mother reveals that he was also one of the victims of the shooting, but that he had only recently began to develop severe night terrors that she believes are related to the attack. Blake is unable to communicate with others due to a head wound that left him with a brain injury that has limited his mobility and made him need a wheelchair. Andover begins treatment on Blake, which they discover has the unintended side effect of healing his brain injury and giving him the ability to speak once more. This, along with his earlier vision of Paige, makes Andover believe that something sinister is at work and that Blake's miraculous healing only occurred so he could once more feel fear, which the creature needs to exist. Megan, who had previously checked  herself in the clinic before and has now done it again to be with Sara, has a small cyst on her back and has Osborn cut into it. Osborn sees that the same black fluid that Caylee vomited earlier is leaking from Megan's wound. Andover begins to suspect that Blake is hiding something, as Blake is reluctant to discuss some elements of the shooting during a therapy session. This proves to be the case after Blake discovers a mask identical to the one worn by the shooter. A series of flashbacks reveals that Blake was not a victim of the shooting but the perpetrator himself and that his head wound was a botched suicide attempt. Wandering through the building, Sara discovers Andover's records where he states that the creature is actually a manifestation of fear and that his Fear Chamber was effectively starving it of what it needed to survive: more fear.\nAndover is pulled into a strange cocoon-like structure on the wall, which enables the fear creature to take over his body. Meanwhile, Blake ended up succumbing to the influence of fear and becomes the shooter once more. He then proceeds to murder one of the clinic's employees while the fear creature incapacitates or kills several of the clinic's inhabitants through its influence. Sara encounters Blake, who chases her until she remembers a statement Andover made about Paige- that her time in the Fear Chamber incapacitated her but that she did not die until her eyes were closed. Sara realizes that although this killed Paige, it also deprived the fear creature of its food source. She manages to close Blake's eyes. She then does so to Caylee, Bauer (Corey Taylor) and Osborn, but the creature attacks her before she can get to Megan. Dylan (Brandon Beemer) kills himself, depriving the creature. Sara saves Megan's life and closes her eyes, after which Andover is freed from the influence of the fear creature- only for him to say that this is not over and that the creature will only return and try to open the door once more.

Left alone, Robert finds a ventilation duct in the top of the ceiling that appears to lead to the fans inside the locker. Just then, he finds a ringing cell phone on the floor and speaks with Detective Al Dorian, who first addresses him as \"Sam\". Robert explains that he was having dinner in a restaurant with his girlfriend for his birthday before being knocked unconscious and thrown into the freezer.

Despite this, he is knocked out and Sam is killed. \nUpon waking up, Robert makes Alisa believe that Stepan is the real thief and Robert is being framed, since Stepan was responsible for both the death of Sam's informant and identifying Robert as the thief. Robert kills Kiril with a meat hook, but is incapacitated by Stepan before he can escape. Alisa, now clearly shaken, tells Stepan that Robert accused him of taking the money.

At this juncture, Baahubali defeats one of the strongest warriors of Verma. Saddened at this, Verma resorts to a cunning way and makes Baahubali's close friend poison Baahubali. When he is poisoned, Verma attacks him with his army along with the traitor minister of Karunadu. In spite of his dying state, Baahubali single-handedly defeats the entire army of Verma and kills them. In this fight, Baahubali loses his pet elephant, \"Balarama\" (this is the elephant which has incarnated as Kalinga), who kills some of the enemy soldiers and dies. Finally, Baahubali dies, and the king of Karunadu awards the title of \"Gajakesari\" to Baahubali for his meritorious act of bravery and his service to the Motherland.\nNow, Krishna, having known his past life, faces Rana and his henchmen and is almost killed.

Annwn was once populated by eight tribes, known as Garms. Long ago, the planet was at peace, as all the different races of Annwn were united by their collective servitude to their creator, a Goddess name Danaan. Unfortunately, violence broke out when Danaan left, setting all the tribes against each other in a never ending war for supremacy. The war proved devastating to the planet's atmosphere, resulting in near annihilations of most of the tribes on the planet, though three remained- the Briga, the Kumtak and the Columba. During this time, the Druids, who previously conveyed the words of Annwn's Gods, disappeared. The Briga tribe lives on the ground and dominates in military superiority through the use of hybrid-powered tanks and cybernetics weaponry, while the weaker Kumtak tribe, facing near extinction, is forced to submit to the Briga by offering advance information technology in their war against the Columba. The Columba rule the sky through the use of mechanized air forces and live in a fortified airship-like carrier.\nThe film itself is divided into three different acts. In Act 1, The Exile of the Three Magi, a Kumtak man named Wydd (Lance Henriksen) is captured by the Columba, along with a dog resembling a basset hound who he refers to as a 'Gula' (a holy creature to all the tribes) and a mysterious being who is identified as Nascien (Summer Howell), the last of the missing Druids. During his interrogation aboard the Columba airship, Wydd claims that he fled from the Briga people because the Kumtak are enslaved, and offers his services and the Druid's power to fight against his people's oppressors. When the airship is eventually destroyed during a Briga attack, Wydd reveals his true purpose, which is to travel to the lands of the Druids with Nascien and find out why Danaan created the Garms, if she intended to leave. He then recruits Khara (Melanie St-Pierre), the Columba clone-soldier that interrogated him, and Skelling (Kevin Durand), the Briga officer who led the attack on the airship, before setting off on this quest.\nIn Act 2, Passage to the Other World, Wydd and his companions continue their journey to the land of the Druids. As the journey draws on, Skellig and Khara both learn that they are quickly running out of mana, the life-energy that sustains then. Despite this pressing concern, the party travels in a Briga tank across war-torn wastelands and seas. Upon witnessing the devastation and brutality of the war, Khara begins to question the worth of the war, but Skellig does not appear to share these concerns.\nIn the final act, Sacred Grove, the party finally arrives at the land of the Druids. Unfortunately, the Briga tank breaks down, forcing Skellig to stay behind and repair it as Wydd, Khara and Nascien continue onward. During their exploration of the sacred grove, Wydd accidentally activates the Druids' defence systems and awakens giant robotic defenders. Skellig manages to repair the tank and hold off the defenders while the others escape, but loses his life in the process. When the group finally arrives at the source of the Druid's knowledge and power, Nascien kills Wydd and reveals her true purpose: to take control of the Druid`s guardians and destroy all the Garms. While the guardians are awoken and set against the Garms, Khara manages to destroy Nascien before she escapes. Khara then asks the dying Nascien why the Garms were abandoned by the Gods. Nascien reveals that the Goddess Danaan left because she feared the destructive potential of the Garms, which is why Nascien took it upon herself to destroy them.  Nascien then says the God's true name to satisfy Khara's curiosity, claiming that \"They\" are a jealous God. Khara then shoots Nascien and falls into a state of sorrow.  As she looks up to the dispersed clouds, Gaia is revealed to resemble Earth, indicating that Annwn was once the Moon, and these \"Gods\" and the Goddess Danaan were responsible for the creation of mankind.

His mother eventually leaves and becomes a prostitute. His father joins the Army, leaving James in the care of his brothel-running aunt. He is fascinated by the shout music at a black church. Later, he fights in a \"battle royal\" boxing match for the amusement of a white audience. Imagining the jazz band breaking into a funk style inspires him to win the bout. He spots his mother on the street one night, but she denies knowing him.\nIn 1949, 17 year-old James is imprisoned for stealing a suit. When Bobby Byrd and his gospel group perform at the prison, James is inspired. He impresses Bobby with his singing, and Bobby's family supervises his parole. James establishes himself as a lead singer and shifts the group's sound toward R&B. He leads them to jump onstage at a Little Richard show, introduces them as \"the Famous Flames\", and they perform a rousing rendition of \"Caldonia\". Richard gives James advice and warns him of the \"white devil\". James marries Velma Warren, and they have a son, Teddy. In 1955, Ralph Bass signs the band to King Records and records their first single, \"Please, Please, Please\". Ben Bart becomes James' manager; he and label executive Syd Nathan relegate the rest of the band to salaried employee status, and they quit.\nBy 1962 James and Bobby have re-formed the band, and James finances the recording of the hugely successful Live at the Apollo. After the show he is approached by his mother, who apologizes for leaving him. He wants nothing to do with her, but gives her financial support. In 1964 James upstages the up-and-coming Rolling Stones on the T.A.M.I. Show with his high-energy performance and dance moves. By paying young radio DJs to promote his shows, he is able to avoid promoter fees. He divorces Velma and marries Deidre Jenkins, but becomes abusive toward her. He treats his new backing band like lackeys, fining them for various infractions, calling rehearsals on their days off, and berating them for questioning him. He develops a signature groove, laying the foundation for funk.\nWhen the King-assassination riots break out in 1968, James convinces the mayor of Boston not to cancel his show at the Boston Garden. Tensions are high between the police and the black audience, but James calms the crowd and issues a plea for togetherness. He records \"Say It Loud \u2013 I'm Black and I'm Proud\" and pitches President Lyndon B. Johnson his idea to perform a series of USO shows for American troops in Vietnam. Though their plane is nearly shot down, the band survives and their performance is well-received.\nJames suffers several setbacks, beginning with Ben's death from a heart attack. He starts several businesses and is investigated by the IRS for back taxes. His band presents a list of demands; when James rebuffs them, all quit except Bobby, who helps him assemble a new band. After a 1971 concert in Paris, Bobby proposes doing a second solo album. James considers this a betrayal; they argue and Bobby quits. James' eldest son, Teddy, dies in a car accident.\nIn Augusta in 1988, James gets high on marijuana and PCP and visits one of his businesses, finding that someone from a neighboring seminar has used his private restroom. He confronts the seminar carrying a shotgun, which he accidentally fires into the ceiling before forgiving the offender. The police arrive and James flees in his truck, crashing through a roadblock before being apprehended and imprisoned.\nIn 1993, James meets Bobby for the first time in 20 years and gives him tickets to his concert at Atlanta's Omni Coliseum. As he takes the stage, he reflects on the cost he has paid for success.

Amid reports of reindeer wandering the streets of London, Steve is surprised when his son, Tom, calls him to claim that he has found Santa in his family\u00b4s garden shed. Steve responds to the call, but although Santa mentions a time Steve saw a shooting star as a child, he dismisses 'Santa' as a madman and sends him out of the shed. Alone, Santa tries to retrieve his reindeer from Battersea dogs home, but is caught when he tries to catapult one of them out and is sent to Lambeth prison.\nThe next morning, Steve appears for his first scheduled day with Tom, but Tom refuses to go anywhere but to see Santa at prison. Santa instructs Steve on how to find his reindeer, and hence his crashed sleigh, and in return Steve sends him to the barber who provides him with a few pointers on how to cope in prison. While Santa is asked to act as the Father Christmas for the local prison party, Steve finds the field in Richmond Park where the reindeer have been taken, with Tom establishing which reindeer is the leader, Dasher, as Dasher communicates through flatulence. They are able to find the sleigh, but when Steve calls Santa to update him, he accidentally releases all of the bright green magic dust the sleigh needs to fly.\nStuck for options, Steve agrees to go to Hermey's Tower in Suffolk, where Santa informs him that he will find help, based on a book in the sleigh's glove compartment, despite this trip meaning that Steve will miss his parole hearing. Despite such delays as difficulty hitch-hiking and a close call that forces them to steal costumes from a pantomime, they are able to reach Hermey's Tower, but are unable to work out what to do next.\nBack at the prison, Santa manages to convince the other prisoners of his identity when they see letters hit the window addressed to Santa, followed by Santa recounting some of the last presents he left for the prisoners when they were children. However, when parole officer Ruth comes to prison to report Steve has missed his parole hearing, she not only identifies him as the man who stole Dasher, but also identifies Santa as 'Harry Mitchell', who was arrested while trying to climb down a chimney over twenty years ago but escaped en route to jail. However, the prisoners begin to acknowledge the truth when an emergency news report reveals that Australian children have woken up with no presents in their stockings.\nWith Santa transferred to solitary, Steve contemplates giving up, but Tom is able to translate a clue in the book to work out how to open Hermey's Tower, which is one of several receiving towers that pick up the letters to Santa and divert them to Lapland. Travelling through the letter-tunnel, Steve and Tom reach Elf City, where Steve convinces the elves to let him use an old sleigh to rescue Santa from prison while deploying a squirrel called Oswald to release the other reindeer, Steve arguing that those children who have woken up without presents may simply find them in other areas. They see that the green magic powder is used for creating the northern lights, that the reindeer walk on in the skies. Reaching the prison, they are able to use a magic slinky to enlarge a small chimney so that Steve and Tom can enter the prison.\nAt the same time, Santa is about to be transferred to solitary, but attempts a break-out with the aid of a dwarf prisoner known as 'Sally', culminating in a fight in the prison gym that ends when Santa punches the guard responsible for supervising the transfer when he says he hates Christmas. As Santa and Sally attempt to break out through a tunnel, Steve writes a letter to Santa so that it will lead him and Tom to Santa, where they intercept Allison, Tom's mother, as she drives to the prison looking for Tom. When the police discover the car, Allison is forced to go along with the request to take them to a park, Santa buying time by using a gun loaded with reindeer droppings as a distraction.\nThey reach the park where Oswald has reassembled the sleigh and the reindeer, Santa inviting Sally to accompany him, just before the police and Ruth arrive. As Ruth asks why Santa would choose Steve to help him, Santa notes that Steve is commendable because he never stops trying, and reassures Tom that adults can make mistakes but just need a chance to believe in the magic of Christmas. With that, Santa takes off in the sleigh and departs for his night's work, wishing them all a Merry Christmas and thanking Steve and Tom for their help, expressing faith that the police will let him off once they see the truth.

Nuclear tests in the 1950s were attempts to kill him; when this did not work, Project Monarch was established to study Godzilla and similar monsters secretly.

Godzilla arrives, causing a tsunami in Honolulu, and briefly engages the MUTO in battle until it flees. Serizawa deduces Godzilla was only listening as the MUTO was communicating with something else, prompting the military to investigate the other spore stored in the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada. However, a second, bigger, wingless MUTO has already emerged and attacks Las Vegas. The scientists deduce that it is female and was what the male was communicating with, their signals being a mating call.\nOver the scientists' objections, Stenz approves a plan of using nuclear warheads to lure all three monsters out into the open ocean and destroy them. Returning to the U.S., Ford joins the team delivering the warheads by train, but the female MUTO intercepts them and devours most of the warheads. The remaining warhead is airlifted with Ford to San Francisco, where the monsters are converging, and activated after Godzilla appears at the Golden Gate Bridge, only for the male MUTO to snatch it and take it to the female, who forms a nest around it in the Chinatown area.\nWhile Godzilla and the MUTOs battle, Ford and a strike team enter the city via HALO jump to find and disarm the warhead before it detonates. Unable to access the timer, the team gets the warhead onto a boat for disposal at sea while Ford destroys the nest. Godzilla defeats the MUTOs and collapses on the shore from exhaustion.

The offer comes with a lucrative incentive of a million-dollar contract if she accepts his offer for the starring role. Princess Grace is intrigued by the offer. Her role as the wife of a head of state has been limited in scope and dealing mostly with charity work for hospitals and humanitarian efforts. She asks her husband for permission and he initially appears to be agreeable to her taking the role if she wants the part.\nIn the meantime, tensions between France and Monaco are growing due to the dependence which France associates with the trade favors it has been offering to Monaco throughout the 20th century. France initiates diplomatic measures to get Monaco to accept a position of being a province within France, in the hope that Prince Rainier will give up his sovereign control over Monaco. The Prince is reticent to accept any such offer. This, in turn, provokes France to begin initial steps toward a trade embargo against Monaco. The French government also initiates clandestine contact with close members of the prince's family, namely his sister and her husband, to help expedite the prince's capitulation to French demands in exchange for favors. The tensions also created differences in opinions of the prince and his wife, which cause the prince to wish to take back his offer to allow Grace to accept the film offer from Hitchcock. The princess appears to need to take stock of her responsibilities and re-evaluate her priorities.\nShe decides to increase her concern for her participation in the improvement of local hospitals and Red Cross aid throughout Europe, and she organizes a charity ball to take place in October for the purposes of fund raising and improving the prestige of Monaco in the process.

Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients, including the 84-year-old dowager Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly two-decade affair. She mysteriously dies a month after her last hotel visit. Gustave and Zero visit Madame's Schloss Lutz estate, where they encounter surviving relatives for the reading of her will by her attorney Deputy Vilmos Kovacs.

Kisha starts making a fuss and fights Malcolm, then breathes into Ray's face. He passes out at the wheel and collides with a truck. Somehow, everybody is okay, but Malcolm and Ray leave an unconscious Kisha in the backseat and run away.\nA year later, Malcolm moves in with his girlfriend Megan, an insecure woman with two kids, her bratty and promiscuous teenage daughter Becky and effeminate son Wyatt, who has a stereotypically black imaginary friend named Tony. The family moves into a new home with their dog, Shiloh Jr. After the movers hang a safe next to the lawn, an invisible force unties the rope tied to a support beam, causing the safe to fall on the dog and crush him. Malcolm dramatically cries all the way to when they bury the dog.\nMegan then puts a creepy looking doll named Abigail on a chair by their bed. Malcolm messes around with it until he starts having sex with it. Malcolm carries his camera around to record everything he sees. He meets the neighbor, Miguel, who jumps at every chance he gets to call Malcolm racist whenever he comments on something related to a Mexican stereotype, though all of it is in jest. Weird things start happening again. Malcolm records himself having sex with Megan and notices the Abigail doll turning its head. He also finds old videotapes with a demonic being in it trying to kill a family of three, but it fails every time.\nAdditionally, Becky finds an old box and develops an attachment to it, and Wyatt continues to hang out with his imaginary friend. Malcolm seeks help from a paranormal psychologist named Professor Wilde. He deduces that Malcolm must have had a previous encounter with a demonic force. Malcolm thinks it has to do with Kisha. Wilde then proceeds to cook meth with some prostitutes, but then gets arrested by the police. Malcolm finds himself being terrorized and taunted by Abigail, as he is getting sent crude photos from her to his phone. She also ends up burning his clothes. Later, Malcolm sees a box moving in the dark and begins to attack it in every possible way he can. Megan and the kids run downstairs and tell Malcolm that what was in the box was supposed to be a surprise for him to make up for Shiloh Jr. Malcolm reaches into the box and pulls out a horribly mangled dog. He then takes a shotgun and blows its head off to put it out of its misery.\nAmong other weird scenarios that plague the family is Becky opening her box and having a whole swarm of moths fly out. Malcolm fixes this by installing bug zappers to attract the moths to their doom. He also notices the demon, which Professor Wilde says is named Aghoul, taunting him in the videos. Although he tries to explain the weirdness to Megan and the kids, they don't believe him. To make matters worse, Malcolm comes home the next day to discover Kisha talking to Megan, looking very much not possessed. She has told Megan that Malcolm left her in a ditch to die, and she leaves after flashing him some scary black demon eyes. Later, Malcolm sees Abigail wrote \"Miss me?\" in red crayon all over the walls. He tries getting rid of her by burying her, sending her to Taiwan, chopping her up and barbecuing her, but she comes back each time.\nMalcolm resorts to seeking help from the insane Father Doug Williams. He finds the crazy priest in a church, shanking another priest for absurd reasons. When Malcolm asks for his help, Doug only makes weird comments about the Kardashians coming after him and other men. Malcolm leaves when he thinks he sees demons surrounding a church, but they're really just church women who make comments about Malcolm being with a white woman. Miguel comes over and offers a chicken to be used as a blood sacrifice, but the chicken becomes hysterical and fights back. Malcolm ends up wrestling the chicken all across the kitchen, ending with him throwing the chicken up into the ceiling fan where it is decapitated. He and Miguel fry the remains and eat it with waffles.\nAs a last resort, Malcolm goes to find Ned and Noreen Swanson, a sort of racist and sexually frustrated paranormal investigative husband and wife duo. He brings them to his house, where they determine that the demonic presence has attracted the family to it, explaining Becky's need for the box, Wyatt's imaginary friend, and Malcolm's sexual attraction to Abigail. They take hits from a bong mask and go downstairs to find Becky fully possessed. She flails around and gets thrown everywhere. Malcolm calls upon Doug to come by, but he has a mental breakdown along with the ghost possessing him and ends up shooting himself in the head. Becky runs upstairs and Malcolm chases after her. After some reluctance, he gets the demon to transfer itself to himself by having Becky regurgitate red goo. Everybody runs upstairs to find Malcolm possessed. He too pukes up the goo back into Becky's box. The Swansons take the possessed items, including Abigail so Ned can have sex with her. Everything seems okay until the next night when Malcolm and Megan are watching TV and Kisha shows up behind them.

He wants her to hand the sword over or be killed like her father and Kai, her sister. Nariko never knew that Kai was her sister. Apparently, on the night of Nariko's birth, Shen left the fortress to impregnate many women to correct his mistake: having Nariko. Months later, Kai was born, another failure.\nBut there is another surprise. Two days before Christmas, one of the women Shen impregnated gave birth to a son, unbeknownst to him. The woman faked her own death and escaped to a fishing village in the north. The son is the chosen one. Bohan spent twenty long years searching for him.\nWhen Nariko was about to give the sword to Bohan, she changed her mind. Since she has nothing to live for, she grabbed the sword and jumped down the ravine.\nAs the year of the Firehorse began years ago, Nariko was born. No one knew that firstborn child would be a daughter instead of a son. Disappointed in having a daughter, Shen sent Nariko to live far away, in the forest. Prophet Takashi took this opportunity to train her to become a warrior in secrecy.\nAs Nariko wakes up, she finds that she is in front of a campfire. The person who fished her out is Kai. Kai knew that Nariko is her sister but didn't say anything because Shen didn't want to be Kai's father. They decide to travel north to find their brother.\nAs they traveled, Nariko learned about Kai's mother. Her mother was strong and funny. When Shen visited, he would bring gold \u2013 \u201cto help\u201d. One day, Flying Fox came. When her mother saw him, she hid Kai in a cave. He had come to get Kai. Fox and his men killed her people and mother.\nBefore they reached the fishing village in the dead marsh, General Whiptail's soldiers killed many villagers. With the help of Nariko and the Heavenly Sword and Kai and her crossbow, they helped some of the villagers and got directions to their brother. But when they reached the hut that their brother, Loki, should have lived in, they learned that he left a year ago for the northeast. He wanted to become a blacksmith for a foreign king.\nWhiptail overhears this and orders her soldiers to kill them. When Nariko and Kai kill her, they are informed that Whiptail already told the villagers that whoever tells Bohan of Loki's whereabouts will be rewarded beyond their wildest dreams.\nBut when Nariko and Kai reached the fortress in the northeast, Bohan's soldiers were already coming. The effects of the Heavenly Sword start to show in Nariko. It is slowly draining her soul, trying to kill its bearer. From deduction, they find out that the king Loki is trying to work for is none other than Bohan and the fortress in the northeast is Bohan's as well. They see Shen getting dragged to a cage and that Bohan lied to them about Shen and their people.\nIn the fortress, they find and rescue Takashi and the other clan members. They learn that Kyo, the person who bullies the sisters, rode to Bohan's army after the sisters left but dies fighting them. They told Shen about their brother and that he is the chosen one. Shen said that he was doing the right thing when he impregnated many women. He learned the errors of his ways and his daughters forgave him. As Shen was about to die, Nariko used the Heavenly Sword's power to bring him back but the effects start to get worse.\nNariko and Kai arrive to Bohan's blacksmith forge but are too late. The couple they helped earlier when they arrived at Loki's village sold him out. There were others after them but since they were the first, they get the gold. Nariko and Kai rescue Loki and killed Bohan's son.\nAfter Nariko gives the Heavenly Sword to Loki, he is killed by Flying Fox. He does the same to Kai. During a difficult battle, Kai, who was just unconscious and badly wounded, killed the real Flying Fox. Kai stops Nariko before she could use the sword's healing power.\nThe sisters spend three days traveling back to their homeland, all while Bohan's army follows on their trail. Nariko fainted when they arrive home. She tells Shen that his son is dead and Bohan is coming. She isn't going to fight for her people but for Kai, her only real family.\nWhen Bohan's army arrives, Nariko learns that Kyo, who is supposed to be dead, is alive. He was the one who told Bohan where the Heavenly Sword was. He did it because he knows that Bohan was always coming and once the sword is given to him, the clan will be free. She refuses so Bohan commands his army to rain arrows on them. She uses the sword's power to shield her against them but Kyo isn't so lucky \u2013 he dies.\nNariko is one woman against Bohan's entire army. She uses the Heavenly Sword power as seen in the beginning of the film. After using its power, she is transported into the sword. It hates her. She tells it that Bohan will melt the sword and that it needs her. The sword gave her its power which she uses to defeat Bohan's army.\nBohan, having seen the sword's power, sacrifices his soul to the Raven King. She defeats him. The Raven King abandons Bohan's body and plucks out his eyes. Roach, Bohan's son, was alive and tells her to leave or else he will kill her.\nNariko returns to her home and tells her father that the sword didn't choose her, she chose it. She uses the sword's healing power to resurrect a dying Kai. Nariko entrusts the sword to Kai, as deities cannot stay. Upon her dying breath, she tells Shen to love Kai as he never did to Nariko.\nIn Nariko's narration, she knows Kai will master the Heavenly Sword and that they will meet again in a better world. The sword might be forgotten but Kai will still be remembered.\nDuring the end credits, Kai is seen picking up the sword and grins at the audience implying she will carry on Nariko Legacy as the new owner of the sword.", "tmdb_plot": "The film's plot follows that of the game closely.

He and his parents (Joseph Gian and Lucie Arnaz) are major fans of the New York Yankees and have attended many of their games. As he and his father are called to dinner, Jack goes through a temporary state of anemia and drops the ball. His parents are convinced that something is terribly wrong with their son, much to their horror.\nThe scene switches to Jack in the hospital, where he has contracted cancer to the point where he is completely bald. As he is carted away for an operation, his parents stay behind, and his chaperone Nurse Cyndi (Cyndi Lauper) sings a jaunty tune of \"Take Me Out to The Ball Game\" to no avail of lifting the boy's spirits. She leaves Jack outside the room, but not before she treats Jack with a sedative to give him \"sweet dreams\". Unhappy with the hardships brought upon by his newly contracted illness, Jack contemplates the (seemingly) final moments of his life until he is greeted by a guardian angel taking the form of a Yankees executive named Henry (Richard Gere). At first, Jack is hesitant to watch the game while he waits, but unwittingly accepts Henry's offer and the man takes him into an imaginary plane of existence where the 20th century is timeless, illness has no existence, the Yankee players of the past are alive and well and most of all, his hair is back.\nHenry and Jack's first stop is early 1930, where they meet Babe Ruth (Chazz Palminteri) in a small field surrounded by corn. He convinces Jack to take the bat, and after a nervous fib about a peanut allergy, strikes out three times. Babe convinces him to try again, yet this time, his teammates laugh Jack off for his age. After successfully stealing home run, Jack bids goodbye and rides off in Henry's 1935 Cord 810 convertible for a fun-filled drive into the skies.\nJack and Henry's next stop is mid-1960, where, to Jack's surprise, the original Yankee Stadium is still standing next to the new one. Then in the Yankees' locker room, he meets Lefty Gomez (Luis Guzman), Mickey Mantle, Bobby Murcer and Thurman Munson. Again, Jack is forced into a position on the team, this time to throw the ball from the pitcher's mound. When an actual game ensues, Munson encourages Jack to pitch the ball to Mantle, but he refuses (by saying that he is not a real pitcher). Despite Jack's inexperience, Munson and Jack continue with an upbeat exchange of words until Jack's blood pressure starts to drop, realizing that the game he is fighting for is his life in the physical world. A short montage set to a ballad version of \"Time After Time\" shows Jack in what appears to be Heaven, watching several moments of his life up to the hospital with other kids, and making him concerned for his parents. When he asks Cissy, a girl he met on Henry's subway train, if she misses her mother and father, she replies \"every day\", implying that she too is dead and is living in the imaginary world as a spirit. Cissy and some other baseball kids bid Jack goodbye, but not before she shouts back \"We're all rooting for you!\" With that, Jack wins the battle, and the game.\nAutomatically transported to the present, Jack meets the elderly George Steinbrenner, who offers him a place on the team. With the permission of the other team members, among them Yogi Berra, Reggie Jackson and \"Goose\" Gossage, encourage him to be a winner. Magically outfitted with a real Yankee uniform fit for his size, Jack soon finds himself playing alongside Curtis Granderson and Hideki Matsui in a large scale game against the nondescript Boston Red Sox. After the Sox pitcher tips the pitch, causing Matsui to hit the ball into the team bench, Jack quickly whispers Babe Ruth's words into Matsui and later on, he bats the ball so hard it goes straight into Monument Park.\nNighttime falls and Jack asks Henry if he can meet Joe DiMaggio, Roger Maris and Billy Martin, but Henry suggests saving it for another time and decides to have Jack return home. With an impending rainstorm reflecting the borderline of his decision, Jack is unwilling to return to his unhealthy life and considers staying where he can give his body all the health and exercise he deserves. After running off, leaving his cap behind, Jack is found by Henry in his chair and reveals that he is Lou Gehrig, another player stricken by disease. Taking his advice that he should keep playing for his life, Jack finally gives in and waves goodbye to Henry, Lefty and Babe Ruth, who arrive just in time to see the boy leave into the real world.\nNow back in the hospital, Jack wakes up to the joy of his parents and to his surprise is visited by the team.

Hercules is said to be the demigod son of Zeus, who completed the legendary Twelve Labors after being betrayed by Hera, who drove him insane and caused him to murder his wife and children during a visit to King Eurystheus. It remains unclear whether Hercules is truly the son of Zeus and many are skeptical of the claim as well as of the stories of his Twelve Labors. Despite this, Hercules displays unusual inhuman strength and nigh-unmatched skill in combat. He is also frequently haunted by the memory of the deaths of loved ones, as well as visions of Cerberus.\nOn the Macedonian Coast in Northern Greece in 1358 BC, Hercules and his team are approached by Ergenia. Her father, King Cotys, wants Hercules to train the armies of Thrace to defend the kingdom from bloodthirsty warlord Rhesus. Hercules accepts after being offered his weight in gold, and the band is welcomed to Thrace by Cotys and General Sitacles, leader of the Thracian army. However, when Rhesus reaches Central Thrace, Cotys insists that Hercules lead the army into battle to defend the Bessi tribe there, despite Hercules's objections and the army's lack of training. However, they are too late as Rhesus' supposed sorcery has turned the Bessi against the Thracians. After the Bessi are defeated following a long and disastrous battle which results in at least half the Thracian forces being killed, Hercules and his allies properly train the army. When the training is complete, Hercules and Sitacles confront Rhesus' army before Mount Asticus. After an arduous battle, Hercules' side wins.\nRhesus is taken back to Thrace as a prisoner, where he is publicly humiliated. Taking pity, Hercules stops the townsfolk from throwing more objects at him. When Hercules mentions Rhesus' actions of burning down villages, Rhesus tells him it was not him or his army that committed those atrocities. Later, in the palace hall, Rhesus is chained up and left on display. Noticing that Ergenia has taken pity on him, Hercules confronts her and finds out Rhesus was telling the truth. He was merely retaliating against Cotys' attempts to expand his kingdom. Ergenia does not agree with Cotys's methods, but goes along out of fear, as her cruel father already poisoned her husband, the previous king. Furthermore, Cotys threatens her son Arius, the true heir to the throne.\nAfter receiving their reward, the mercenaries are ready to leave, but Hercules decides to stay behind and stop Cotys. All but Autolycus choose to follow him. However, they are overpowered and captured by Sitacles and his men. While chained, Hercules is confronted by King Eurystheus, who is in league with Cotys. Eurystheus reveals that he drugged Hercules the night his family died, viewing him as a threat to his power. Hercules' family was actually killed by three wolves sent by Eurystheus, resulting in Hercules' constant hallucinations of Cerberus. When Cotys orders Ergenia to be executed for her betrayal, Hercules is encouraged by Amphiaraus to believe in himself. In a show of superhuman strength, Hercules breaks free of his chains, saving Ergenia and defeating the wolves single-handedly. Hercules releases the prisoners, including Rhesus, and then confronts Eurystheus, killing him and avenging his family; however, he is ambushed by Sitacles, who is then stabbed to death by Iolaus. Outside, Hercules and his forces battle Cotys' army. Arius is taken hostage, but rescued by Autolycus, who has decided to return to help his friends. In the ensuing battle, Tydeus is mortally wounded while protecting Arius, but fights on, slaughtering numerous soldiers until he falls; later dying in Hercules's arms. Again using inhuman strength, Hercules pushes a massive statue of Hera from its foundations and uses it to crush Cotys and many of his soldiers.\nImpressed by this feat, the surviving soldiers bow to Hercules, recognizing him as a demigod.

As the days go by, Veera finds peace and a new-found freedom, which confuses and frustrates Mahabir. Veera becomes comfortable with her captors, to the point that she confides in Mahabir the horrors of her childhood, when she was sexually abused by her own uncle as a nine-year-old. She views the abduction as a blessing in disguise, since she finally has the chance to experience life and find herself. Slowly, she unravels Mahabir's story in bits and pieces. His father abused both, him when he was a young child, and his mother who was used as a sex slave by the rich landlords. Mahabir escaped and has never returned.\nMahabir slowly lets down his guard and begins to care for Veera, and his anger fades away slowly. He tries to leave her at a police station in one of the small mountainous towns they stop in. However, Veera refuses and insists on staying with Mahabir. Together, they travel and he starts to fall in love with her. They stay in a hilltop house and Veera reveals that one of her many crazy dreams was always to have a small home in the mountains. Mahabir becomes emotional seeing the way Veera cares for him, reminding him of his mother. Both sleep peacefully that night, free from their respective haunting pasts. But the very next morning, police arrive and, during the chaos, shoot Mahabir, to which Veera reacts emotionally and strongly. It is later revealed that Mahabir is killed on the spot. \nShe is later brought back to her parents' house, where she recovers from the emotionally draining experience while surrounded by her family members, including her fianc\u00e9. Finally she feels physically better and confronts her uncle who molested her as a child, in front of her family. She yells and breaks down as she asks her father why he warned her only about dangers posed by outsiders, while the real threat was from insiders, the people who had surrounded her since childhood. She leaves the house and goes to live in the mountains where she starts her own factory, buys a house and lives there. The film ends with Veera looking at the mountains, then the sky (remembering Mahabir). Closing her eyes, she sees her nine-year-old self playing happily on the hillside.

Benjamin tries his best to reassure him and prescribes him analgesics but, because of the misfunctions of the device, he cannot do an ECG. The morning after, a colleague tells him that Mr Lemoine is dead.\nBenjamin is, then, summoned by his superior, Dr. Denormandy (Marianne Denicourt) to review with her about what happened yesterday. Benjamin confesses he couldn't do the ECG. Dr. Denormandy tells him that, if someone were to ask him about the matter, he must reply that he actually did the ECG and didn't notice anything abnormal. This case put a strain on Benjamin's relationship with Abdel, as Benjamin told Mr Lemoine's widow that it was actually Abdel who took care of her husband, not him.\nMeanwhile, Benjamin and Abdel are also taking care of another patient, Mrs Richard (Jeanne Cellard), an 80-year-old woman, who used to be a gymnast, and now, suffers from a metastatic cancer and had to go recently through a femur neck surgery. While they are discussing about the appropriate treatment to deliver as well as the level of pain Mrs Richard feels, Abdel decides to install a morphine pump so that she won't suffer anymore.

When Mrs Richard's family, who has been informed by a nurse, arrives, Abdel and Benjamin discuss with them about the possibility to put an end to the life of the patient, in accordance with the Leonetti law. The family accepts, as there is no point in persisting any further and making Mrs Richard suffer. \nHowever, Abdel and Benjamin were not supposed to take this decision by themselves, in the middle of the night. Consequently, they are summoned for a disciplinary hearing, attended by Dr. Denormandy, Dr. Barois and the critical care team leader. After discussion, it was decided that Benjamin won't be punished due to his age as well as his emotional state during the events. However, a misconduct statement will be added to Abdel's file, much to the latter's dismay. Indeed, it could probably prevent him from doing other internships, putting an end to his goal of obtaining a certificate of equivalence for his Algerian qualification and so, being allowed to practice as a doctor in France. \nBenjamin, who, meanwhile, has ended up befriending Abdel, is distraught by this decision, claiming that everything is his fault. One night, after getting drunk, he goes to Mrs Lemoine's place and confesses that they haven't conducted all the necessary examinations that could have prevented the death of her late husband.

Upon returning to the main area of the mansion, Gen pushed out a wheelchair and explained that Huo Lianqi has returned after the tragedy only to find the house empty. Huo Lianqi had been waiting at the house for the return of Xu Ruoqing, and Gen wanted the mansion for him and Huo Lianqi as he believes Huo Lianqi is the rightful owner of the mansion.

After being carried off during a dragon raid, she spent 20 years rescuing dragons from Drago and bringing them to an island nest created out of ice by a gigantic, ice-spewing alpha dragon called a \"Bewilderbeast\", which is able to control smaller dragons by emitting hypnotic sound waves. Stoick and his lieutenant Gobber track Hiccup to the nest, where Stoick discovers his wife is alive. Meanwhile, Astrid and the other riders force Eret to lead them to Drago, who captures them and their dragons and, learning of Berk's dragons, sends his armada to attack the dragon nest. He also attempts to execute Eret, but Astrid's dragon, Stormfly, saves him. A grateful Eret later helps her and the others escape.\nAt the nest, a battle ensues between the dragon riders, Valka's dragons, and Drago's armada, during which Drago reveals his own Bewilderbeast to challenge the alpha. The two colossal dragons fight, ending with Drago's Bewilderbeast killing its rival and becoming the new alpha. Drago's Bewilderbeast seizes control of all the adult dragons. Hiccup tries to persuade Drago to end the violence, but Drago orders his Bewilderbeast to have Toothless kill him. The hypnotized Toothless fires a plasma bolt toward Hiccup, but Stoick pushes him out of the way and is killed instead. The Bewilderbeast momentarily relinquishes control of Toothless, but Hiccup drives Toothless away in a fit of despair over his father's death. Drago maroons Hiccup and the others on the island and rides Toothless, again under the control of the Bewilderbeast, to lead his army to conquer Berk. Stoick is given a Viking funeral, and Hiccup, having lost both his father and dragon, is unsure what to do. Valka encouragingly tells him he alone can unite humans and dragons. Inspired by her words and his father's, Hiccup and his allies return to Berk to stop Drago by riding the baby dragons, which are immune to the Bewilderbeast's control.\nBack at Berk, they find that Drago has attacked the village and taken control of its dragons. With a heartfelt apology, Hiccup frees Toothless from the Bewilderbeast's control, much to Drago's surprise. Hiccup and Toothless confront Drago, but the Bewilderbeast encases them in ice. However, Toothless blasts away the ice and enters a glowing super-powered state, where he is immune to the Bewilderbeast's control, enraged that the Bewilderbeast tried to hurt Hiccup. Toothless then challenges the Bewilderbeast to protect his rider, repeatedly shooting it in the face, which breaks its control over the other dragons, who side with Toothless as the new alpha. All the dragons continually fire at the Bewilderbeast until Toothless fires a final massive blast, breaking its left tusk. Defeated, the Bewilderbeast retreats with Drago on his back.\nThe Vikings and dragons celebrate their victory, and Hiccup is made chieftain of Berk, while all the dragons from both Berk and Valka's sanctuary bow before Toothless as their new king.

The men-behaving-like dogs are taken to a mental asylum for treatment. In the asylum, the lady doctor, Dr. Shivani, soon realizes the truth and promises to discharge them. But fate takes an even stranger twist because, in the same asylum, there are two identical lookalikes of Ashok and Kumar who are being treated in the 'B' ward. They work for Bijlani, a cocaine smuggler. The lookalikes are accidentally released instead of the real Ashok and Kumar. Shanaya and Mishti, who come to pick up their boyfriends from the asylum, take away the duplicates instead, without realizing anything. All of them go to Ashok's mansion. Here, Mamaji understands the whole mix-up and plans to use the duplicate Ashok to become the owner of the whole business empire. \nBy now, the true Ashok and Kumar also come to know of Mamaji's evil plan, but they are still stuck in the asylum.

Marguerite, a local woman, passes by and helps tow the van to town. She invites the family into her apartment while they deal with the auto repair shop and arrange lodgings for the night, and she treats them to a tray of delicious food she made using fresh, local ingredients.\nThe next morning, Hassan follows his father, Abbu, to an abandoned property they passed the night before. A restaurant had been there, but it failed because Le Saule Pleureur (\"The Weeping Willow\"), an upscale French restaurant with a Michelin star, is located just across the street, a hundred feet away. Abbu buys the land anyway, as he is confident the Indian food Hassan will cook for their restaurant will attract customers.\nNaming their restaurant Maison Mumbai, the Kadam family renovates the property. One day, Madame Mallory, the proprietor of Saule Pleureur, visits and asks to see their menu. Abbu hesitates, but Hassan gladly gives it to her in case she wishes to dine with them sometime. When she buys all of the ingredients the Kadams need from the local market on the day of their grand opening, a war of sabotage and complaints to the mayor of the village erupts between Abbu and Mallory. While this is going on, Hassan asks Marguerite, who is a sous chef at Saule Pleureur, to help him learn about French cooking, and they develop feelings for each other.\nThe war between the restaurants peaks on Bastille Day, when one of Mallory's chefs, Jean-Pierre, and two others spray-paint \"La France aux Fran\u00e7ais\" (\"France to the French\") on the outer wall of Maison Mumbai and firebomb the covered outdoor eating area. Hassan catches them in the act and scares them off, but his hands get burned. Mallory, deducing who is responsible, dismisses Jean-Pierre and personally scrubs the graffiti off the wall. While she is cleaning, Hassan offers to make her an omelette, which is how Marguerite said Mallory interviews potential chefs. As his hands are bandaged, Hassan instructs Mallory how to make the omelet his way, which uses unusual spices and ingredients. She is so impressed by the result that she invites him to work at Saule Pleureur so he can get a more classical training to supplement his natural ability. Abbu is initially against the move, but ultimately allows Hassan to go.\nMarguerite accuses Hassan of using her to help him get his new position, and they compete for Mallory's approval in the kitchen. Hassan outshines Marguerite, and his cooking, which evolves into a unique French-Indian fusion, results in Saule Pleureur receiving a second Michelin star. The award gets him national attention, and he accepts a job at a fancy Parisian molecular cuisine restaurant.

After her parents see that Mia is passionate about the cello, they hire a teacher to help her play. Kat is shown pregnant with Teddy, whom Mia thinks is the reason for her father's departure from his band.\nYears later, an adolescent Mia is still passionate about the cello and is playing at school in the band room where Adam Wilde, a popular student and up-and-coming rockstar, peeks in on her playing. This leads him to ask Kim, Mia's best friend, about her.

During his interrogation by Nock, Turing tells of his time working at Bletchley Park during the Second World War.\nIn 1928, the young Turing is unhappy and bullied at boarding school. He develops a friendship with Christopher Morcom, who sparks his interest in cryptography. Turing develops romantic feelings for him, but Christopher soon dies from tuberculosis.\nWhen Britain declares war on Germany in 1939, Turing travels to Bletchley Park. Under the direction of Commander Alastair Denniston, he joins the cryptography team of Hugh Alexander, John Cairncross, Peter Hilton, Keith Furman, and Charles Richards. The team are trying to analyze the Enigma machine, which the Nazis use to send coded messages.\nTuring is difficult to work with, and considers his colleagues inferior; he works alone to design a machine to decipher Enigma messages. After Denniston refuses to fund the construction of the machine, Turing writes to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who puts Turing in charge of the team and funds the machine. Turing fires Furman and Richards and places a difficult crossword in newspapers to find replacements. Joan Clarke, a Cambridge graduate, passes Turing's test but her parents will not allow her to work with the male cryptographers. Turing arranges for her to live and work with the female clerks who intercept the messages and shares his plans with her.  With Clarke's help, Turing warms to the other colleagues, who begin to respect him.\nTuring's machine, which he names Christopher, is constructed, but cannot determine the Enigma encryption settings quickly enough; the Germans reset them each day. Denniston orders it to be destroyed and Turing fired, but the other cryptographers threaten to leave if Turing goes. After Clarke plans to leave on the wishes of her parents, Turing proposes marriage, which she accepts. During their reception, Turing confirms his homosexuality to Cairncross, who warns him to keep it secret. After overhearing a conversation with a female clerk about messages she receives from the same German coder, Turing has an epiphany, realising he can program the machine to decode words he already knows exist in certain messages. One German coder always opens his first message with a standard plaintext German script. That reveals enough of the day's Enigma code that Christopher can quickly decode all the day's messages. After he recalibrates the machine, it quickly decodes a message and the cryptographers celebrate. They learn a convoy is about to be attacked, but Turing realises that if they suddenly reroute the convoy and attack the U-boats, the Germans will realize Enigma is compromised and change the machinery. Therefore, the team at Bletchley Park cannot act on every decoded message. Turing creates a statistical model to indicate which warnings to send to maximize destruction and minimize discovery.\nTuring discovers that Cairncross is a Soviet spy. When Turing confronts him, Cairncross argues that the Soviets are allies working for the same goals, and threatens to retaliate by disclosing Turing's sexuality. When the top MI6 agent Stewart Menzies appears to threaten Clarke, Turing reveals that Cairncross is a spy. Menzies reveals he knew this already and planted the messages Cairncross leaks to the Soviets for British benefit. Fearing for her safety, Turing tells Clarke to leave Bletchley Park, revealing that he is a homosexual. Clarke states she always suspected but insists they would have been happy together anyway. Turing then tells her he never cared for her, and only used her for her cryptography skills.  Heartbroken, she decides to stay anyway, deeming this the single most important task she will undertake, and she now refuses to cow to what Turing or her parents want her to do, or think of her decisions.  After the war, Menzies tells the cryptographers to destroy their work, because MI6 wants governments to think they had unbreakable code machines. He tells the team that they should never see one another again or share what they have done.\nIn 1952, Turing is convicted of gross indecency and, in lieu of a jail sentence, undergoes chemical castration so he can continue his work. Clarke visits him in his home and witnesses his physical and mental deterioration. She comforts him by saying that his work saved millions of lives.\nThe epilogue reveals that after a year of government-mandated hormonal therapy, Turing committed suicide on June 7, 1954.

Passing her breaking point, Agn\u00e8s attempts to commit suicide with an overdose of pills. Ren\u00e9e goes to the hospital to visit her, but Agn\u00e8s refuses to see her mother. Maurice installs Agn\u00e8s back in her apartment, but he is indifferent as she is despondent over him. Shortly afterwards, Agn\u00e8s disappears without a trace.

Her mother, having lost everything, takes on a 20+year crusade to prove that Maurice killed her daughter or had her killed by someone else.\nNow elderly and frail, Ren\u00e9e finally succeeds in having the investigation into her daughter's disappearance reopened.

The trio decide to go to Australia to visit Jay. Upon arrival, they discover that Jay works as a night club toilet attendant and lives in his uncle Bryan's front garden. Whilst at the night club, Will is reunited with Katie, his first love from private school, who is backpacking. At her request, Will agrees to join her at Byron Bay. When the boys return to Bryan's house, Simon attempts to break up with Lucy over Skype, but Bryan tricks her into thinking Simon is proposing and Lucy agrees to marry him.\n\nThe four boys travel to a youth hostel in Byron Bay and meet the backpackers, with member Ben taking a disliking to Will for being a holidaymaker.

Marco admits he does not have one and attempts to take them to the police station at gunpoint.\nThe brothers overpower Marco and flee down their apartment complex's stairwell. While chasing them, Marco shoots Carlos in the leg but seems surprised by his own action. They are then startled by a loud explosion in the distance just before they realize that the stairs turn out to be endless, looping in on themselves. As Marco goes through the items in his wallet, he finds a miniature playing card he does not recognize. He tears the tiny card into pieces and does not pay it any further attention. Oliver applies first aid to his brother but can only watch as Carlos bleeds to death the next day.\nBefore he dies, Carlos urges Oliver to appreciate the present, something he could never do. As Oliver mourns Carlos' death, Marco becomes shaken when he sees that a vending machine on the stairwell has become restocked, precisely as it was 24 hours ago. Enraged by Marco's callousness, Oliver disarms him and threatens to kill him with his pistol. Marco insists that he did not consciously choose to shoot Carlos and the two argue over the metaphysics of their situation.\nElsewhere, Sandra and her two children, Daniel and Camila, prepare to visit her ex-husband. Although her new husband, Roberto, is anxious about the trip, Sandra reassures him the long drive will give him a chance to bond with her children. Daniel packs a deck of miniature playing cards, just like the one Marco found in his wallet. On the way, they stop at a gas station where Roberto carelessly offers fruit juice to Camila, who has an allergic reaction to it and slowly starts having an asthma attack.

After Skylark and his crew celebrate producer Aaron Rapaport's 1,000th episode, Rapaport is upset by a producer peer who criticizes the show as not being a real news program. He voices his concern to Skylark, urging change. Skylark agrees and later discovers that Kim Jong-un is a fan of their show, prompting Rapaport to arrange an interview for him. Traveling to the outskirts of Dandong, China, to receive instructions from the North Korean chief propagandist Sook-yin Park, Rapaport accepts the interview on behalf of Skylark.\nFollowing Rapaport's return, CIA agent Lacey shows up, requesting they assassinate Kim with a transdermal strip of ricin via handshake to prevent the country from launching a nuclear missile at the West Coast; they reluctantly agree. Skylark carries the strip inside a pack of gum. Upon arrival in Pyongyang, they are greeted by Sook and taken to the palace. They are introduced to Kim's personal security officers Koh and Yu who are immediately suspicious of the duo; when Koh finds the strip, he chews it mistaking it for gum. After making a secret request for help, Lacey airdrops them two more strips via an UAV, but to get it back to their room, Rapaport has to evade a Siberian tiger and hide the container in his rectum before getting caught by security.\nThe next day, Skylark meets Kim and spends the day playing basketball, hanging out, riding in his personal tank and partying with escorts. Kim convinces Skylark that he is misunderstood as both a cruel dictator and a failed administrator, and they become friends. At a state dinner, Koh has a seizure from the ricin poisoning, accidentally shooting Yu before dying. The next morning, Skylark feels guilty, discarding one of the ricin strips and thwarts Rapaport's attempt to poison Kim with the second strip. After a dinner mourning the deaths of the bodyguards, Skylark witnesses Kim's malicious self as he threatens war against South Korea, the West and everyone who tries to undermine him. Skylark leaves and discovers that a nearby grocery store is fake, realizing Kim has been lying to him. At the same time, during an attempt to seduce Rapaport (who still has the ricin strip on his hand), Sook reveals she despises Kim and apologizes for defending the regime. Skylark returns and tries to get Sook's support to assassinate Kim, but she disagrees, suggesting to instead ruin his cult of personality and show the North Korean people the dire state of the country. The trio secretly devise a plan to expose him on air and arm themselves with guns. Before the broadcast begins, Kim gives Skylark a puppy as a symbol of their friendship.\nDuring the internationally televised interview with Kim, Skylark addresses increasingly sensitive topics (including the country's food shortage and US-imposed economic sanctions) and challenges his need for his father's approval. Meanwhile, Sook and Rapaport take over the control booth to fend off Kim's guards trying to cut off the broadcast. Despite his initial resistance, Kim eventually cries uncontrollably, soiling himself after Skylark sings \"Firework\" by Katy Perry (knowing of Kim's fondness of her music), ruining his reputation. Enraged at Skylark's betrayal, Kim shoots him and vows to get revenge by launching the nuclear missile. Skylark, whose bulletproof vest saves him, regroups with Rapaport and Sook to escape (alongside the puppy) with the help of a guard. The trio hijacks Kim's tank to get to their pickup point, killing several more guards in the process. Kim chases the group in a helicopter but is shot down and killed by Skylark before he can issue the command to launch the missile.\nWith the missile launch thwarted, Sook guides Skylark and Rapaport to an escape route, explaining that she has to return to Pyongyang to maintain security.

Elsewhere, Pete, a veteran storm chaser, has been attempting to intercept and film tornadoes using a  Tornado Intercept Vehicle nicknamed Titus, but has come up short all year long. Upon learning of a major line of developing storms, the chasers decide to head for Silverton in hopes of filming tornadoes. After arriving in Silverton, the team discovers that the cell they had been chasing has dissipated, but  the Silverton cell abruptly strengthens, resulting in a hailstorm and tornado. As the team films, the funnel shifts course and heads for the high school.\nAt the high school, the weather suddenly sours. The students are marshaled into the school building. In the aftermath of the tornado, shaken students emerge from the damaged building to view the destruction, while Gary sets out to rescue his eldest son Donnie, who had gone to an abandoned paper mill to help his friend Kaitlyn with a project; both were subsequently trapped when the tornado brought the building down on them.\nAs Pete's storm chase team stops in a small part of town, a tornado takes shape just as Gary and Trey arrive, destroying several buildings. Before the tornado dissipates Gary must save Pete's meteorologist, Allison Stone. Then, Pete's team agree to help Gary get to the paper mill. While en route, another round of tornadoes form and encircle Pete's team, in the process destroying a residential neighborhood and a car lot. An explosion turns one of the tornadoes into a firenado, which Jacob the cameraman tries to film, only to be caught up in the storm and killed. This causes friction in the team, as Pete's concern seems to be more on collecting data than ensuring his team's safety. After recovering their vehicles, Allison leaves with Gary to continue their trip to the paper mill.\nAt the mill, a water pipe abruptly breaks and begins to flood the hole in which the two students are trapped. Injured and at risk of drowning, the two record messages for their loved ones, then prepare for the worst. At the last minute, Gary and Allison arrive and successfully free them.\nIn the skies above Silverton, a convergence of two large tornadoes results in a colossal EF-5 tornado that threatens to level the town. The town's citizens have taken shelter at the school, but Pete's team determines that the school's storm shelter will be inadequate. Unable to alert the school's staff with mobile devices, Pete's team rushes to the school. While citizens rush to board school buses, Pete and his team follow the storm, but the last school bus and a handful of cars are cut off from the retreat due to a downed transmission tower.\nThe storm chasers and school refugees take cover in a storm drain at a construction site, but a Truck from the airport that the tornado struck damages one of the storm grates, compromising the shelter. In an attempt to save lives, Pete hands over his research hard drives to Gary, then sacrifices himself by leaving the shelter to move Titus down to the storm grate, to use the vehicle to anchor the storm grate to the concrete face. Titus's equipment proves unable to anchor the vehicle to the ground, and the tornado picks up the vehicle. From the camera turret aboard Titus, Pete observes the funnel of the tornado as the vehicle is lifted above the clouds, fulfilling his dream, before then crashing to the ground, killing him and wrecking Titus. Shortly thereafter, the EF-5 tornado dissipates.\nIn the aftermath of the tornado outbreak, the townspeople begin to clean up and rebuild. As Gary's sons complete their time capsule film, many of those they interview express newfound appreciations for their lives.

In Bubun, the roles of men and women are reversed, up to the point where the male population is deprived of any civil rights, including work, education, military service, freedom of marriage etc. People worship The White Horses (making horses sacred animals) and the only source of nourishment is \"paste\" (tasteless viscous liquid delivered from waterpipe-like sinks). The country is isolated from the rest of the world, borders are guarded by armed squads, and public executions are in order (the condemned being mostly men).\nJacky is an over-popular handsome young man, who lives in poverty with his widow mother, and crushes on La Colonelle (Coloness), the Generaless's daughter and the future leader of the state. Jacky is also one of the few boys with at least some education: his paternal uncle Julin (Michel Hazanavicius) - gigolo and contrabandist, also a masculism revolutionist - teaches the nephew literacy. Jacky's maternal aunt, with two husbands, is quite rich and her two sons constantly bully Jacky for being so poor.\nGeneraless proclaims a grand ball, at which the Lead Rider (the current leader's husband) will be chosen for her daughter as she succeeds to become ruler of Bubun. Jacky's mother cannot afford a ticket to the ball, and Jacky desperately tries to make Julin give up the \"treasure\" left by Jacky's father.

At this point, Jacky flees the village, only to be caught by Sherifess and immediately rescued by Julin (who escaped imprisonment by \"riding wardens until they were knocked out\").

While Julin intends to sell his stash of vegetables and get money for crossing the border, Jacky wants to get to the ceremony and confess his love to Coloness.\nDuring the ball, Coloness invites Jacky (disguised as a female officer) to her quarters and tells him that she does not want to be the new Generaless, and tries to seduce him (believing Jacky to be a woman). The Generaless, however, interrupts them, as she has already chosen the Lead Rider for her daughter. Jacky's cover is blown when his relatives recognize him, and he finally tells the Coloness he loves her, revealing himself to be a man. When Generaless orders Jacky to be caught and killed, he ventures deeper into the palace, discovering that \"paste\" is actually processed and enriched feces (as the Generaless's adjutant puts it, \"the poor eat their own shit and are happy\"). To reveal the truth, Jacky overloads the main cauldron, making the country realize what their food is made of.\nHiding under the Coloness's bed, Jacky convinces her of his love and spends a night with her, stating that he will love her regardless of who she is.

The films begins with Jeeva, sitting in a park bench and starts to narrate his life story. He is a lower middle-class boy, who from the very young age is interested in cricket. He sees Sachin Tendulkar as his idol. Though his father initially does not support him, he later starts to do so on the request of his friend. Jeeva grows up and becomes a part of the school team. He excels in his game and turns out to be a star player. Seeing his performances, a local cricket club offers him a chance to join and train with them, for which his father disagrees saying that his academic performance is poor due to cricket and he may not get a job in future. In between Jeeva falls in love with his neighbour girl and they are broken up when their family discovers this. Jeeva starts to drink due to this heartbreak. So to make him concentrate on good deeds again, Jeeva's father agrees to let him join the cricket club.\nJeeva becomes a sensation at the club, scoring good runs in every game. His opening Partner Ranjith initially has ego clashes with Jeeva, but later they become close friends and produce great performances. They both develop and their team starts to enter higher division competitions. In the meantime, Jeeva's school time crush Jenny meets him back and they start loving again. However, he gets pressured into marrying her and pleads for a chance after getting selected. Then comes the tournament that selects the players for the Tamil Nadu Ranji Trophy team and as expected both Jeeva and Ranjith get selected. But the real trouble starts after joining the Team. The Tamil Nadu team mostly comprises players from a particular community and since Jeeva and Ranjith are from a different community, they are sidelined for most of the games. They are given chances in tough conditions where it's hard to score more runs. But still they manage to put up a decent performance. Jeeva even once gets applauded by the Captain of the Rajasthan team, who is a veteran national team member. But getting dropped in the upcoming games affects their average and their subsequent chances of getting into the team for future games. Angered by being rejected from the team, Ranjith storms into the Association office and blasts at the chairman for showing partiality towards that community and leaves with a heavy heart. Both Jeeva and Ranjith feel that their cricketing career is over. Ranjith commits suicide and Jeeva is heartbroken. Jenny's father even agrees for their marriage and promises a job for Jeeva, provided he converts to Christianity and quits cricket. Jeeva initially agrees but immediately tells Jenny that he cannot live without Cricket and Jenny leaves him. Jeeva returns to training and he practices even harder waiting for a magic to happen that will revive his cricketing career.\nAnd the magic happens after sometime, when his Coach gets a call from the Rajasthan CPL(ipl) team franchise, to offer Jeeva a chance to play in the upcoming season of CPL.

Frankie has the admiration of Genovese Family mobster Angelo \"Gyp\" DeCarlo, who takes a personal interest in him.\nOne night, the group attempts a robbery of a safe, resulting in the police later arresting them. In court, Frankie is let off with a slap on the wrist, while Tommy is sentenced to six months in prison. After his release, Tommy reunites with the group, and adds Frankie as lead singer. Frankie changes his professional name to Frankie Vally, and then Frankie Valli. At a performance, Frankie is entranced by a woman named Mary Delgado. He takes her to dinner, and they are soon married.\nThe group, now called \"The Four Lovers\", is in need of a songwriter after Nicky leaves. Tommy's friend, Joe Pesci, tells him about a talented singer-songwriter, Bob Gaudio, and invites him to hear the group perform. Gaudio is impressed with Valli's vocals, and agrees to join.\nThe band, having recorded several demos, attempts to attract interest, but has little success. One day, in New York City, producer Bob Crewe signs them to a contract. However, they quickly realize that it only allows them to perform back-up vocals for other acts. Crewe says that the group does not have a distinctive image or sound yet. Inspired by a bowling alley sign, the band is renamed \"The Four Seasons,\" and they sing a new song Gaudio has written, \"Sherry\", to Crewe, who agrees to record it.\n\"Sherry\" quickly becomes a commercial success, followed by two more, \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" and \"Walk Like a Man\". However, before an appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, Valli is approached by mobster Norman Waxman, a loan shark for one of the other Five Families, who claims that Tommy owes him $150,000. Frankie goes to DeCarlo, who gets Waxman to allow the group to pay the debt, which turns out to be considerably larger. Tommy must go to work for the mob's associates in Las Vegas until it is paid. Nick, irritated by Tommy's irresponsibility, not being involved in the group's decisions, and never being able to see his family, also leaves the group.\nHaving to tour constantly to pay off the debt, the band hires a set of studio musicians, and becomes Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, with Gaudio now acting solely as songwriter and producer. Valli learns from his now ex-wife, Mary, that his daughter, Francine, now a drug addict, has escaped from home. Valli meets his estranged daughter and regrets not acting as a better father for her when she was growing up. He also arranges for Gaudio to offer her singing lessons and for Crewe to cut a demo for her.\nA few years later, the group has finally paid off Tommy's debt. However, this coincides with the news of Francine's death by drug overdose. Frankie and Mary both grieve for their daughter. Gaudio composes a new number for Valli to sing, his first as a solo artist. At first, Frankie is hesitant, as he is still in mourning, but eventually agrees. The track, \"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\", becomes a commercial success.\nIn 1990, the Four Seasons are about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The band performs \"Rag Doll\" onstage, their first performance together in over twenty years. The music fades as the four men take turns addressing the audience. Tommy, in an ironic twist, now works for Joe Pesci, who has gone on to become an Oscar-winning actor (his award-winning role was a fictionalized account of another real-life gangster named after Tommy DeVito).

Two months afterward, Jessie, who now uses a wheelchair, moves in with her estranged father, Leon (David Andrews) in St. Francisville, Louisiana. She resides in her mother's former bedroom. Her mother, Kate, died due to a brain tumor shortly after she was born, with Leon subsequently leaving her to be raised by her aunt.\nOne day, Jessie finds a box containing four videotapes shot by Kate (Joelle Carter). Addressing Jessie by her full name, she congratulates her on her 18th birthday and gives a tarot reading about Death that tells of a transition, taught to her by a friend whom she met at a local church. Kate warns that an unwanted presence is haunting Jessie, a reading that turns out to be true, as Jessie feels that a gaunt black-haired woman (Amber Stevens) is haunting her ever since she moved back into her father's house. Jessie also has a vivid dream where she is strapped to a bed by her mother and witnesses a voodoo ritual being conducted, where blood flowing into a breathing machine chokes her. Leon repeatedly tries to dissuade Jessie from watching the tapes by breaking the first one and throwing Jessie's wheelchair into the bayou.\nOne day, Jessie has a frightening encounter in the bathtub with the same woman during a physical therapy session. After lifting Jessie onto Kate's old wheelchair, Leon coerces her physical therapist into leaving the house. After telling Jessie that the Kate in the tapes is not her mother due to the tumors she had, Leon attempts to burn all of the tapes, but a supernatural force burns him alive inside the yard shed.\nDuring Leon's funeral, Jessie reunites with her high school friend, Preston Sanders (Mark Webber), but collapses after she sees a severely burned man (Vaughan Wilson). After Preston leaves from tending to Jessie, she watches the third tape, which was focused on Leon and Kate in an outing and their Christmas party with the announcement of the latter's pregnancy, and the fourth tape, in which it focused on the foretold tarot readings and Kate tearfully shouting \"You're dead!\" before the footage cut off. After watching the tape, Jessie notices the woman behind her in the mirror. The mirror then shatters, and Jessie discovers a small secret compartment holding a tape (that wasn't found in the box) with no label on it that she opts not to watch. The next day, Jessie and Preston head across a nearby bayou, which Jessie has been suspicious of since observing glittering light and flames appearing there. The two discover voodoo icons and effects, as well as a grave of \"Jessabelle\" with a baby's skeleton, dated on Jessie's birthday, which they turn over to Sheriff Pruitt (Chris Ellis) for DNA testing. Jessie and Preston then visit the house of Mrs. Davis (Fran Bennett), the mother of one of their friends and the Laurents' former family cook, who speaks about Moses Harper, Kate's aforementioned friend from her church mentioned in the second tape. Thinking that Moses may be involved in the supernatural occurrences, the two head to Moses' voodoo shrine in a ruined church, but are attacked by a group of men who force them to leave.\nThe two return to Jessie's home where Preston confesses that, despite being married, he is in love with Jessie. Preston offers to let Jessie live with his mother, which she accepts. Just before Jessie can finish her packing; Preston is attacked by the ghostly woman and knocked unconscious.\nNow left alone, Jessie conducts a ritual to summon the woman. After the ritual, Jessie is called by Pruitt, who informs her that the baby was Kate's daughter, but not Leon's. She plays the blank tape where it presents Kate casting a voodoo enchantment on a newborn white girl and committing suicide by gunshot, not before tearfully shouting that Jessabelle and her father Moses are dead, attempting to suffocate the infant girl with a pillow, and changing her mind to conduct the incantation. Jessie is confronted by Kate's spirit and realizes the truth that her \"father\" was hiding from her: the video tapes filmed were for Jessabelle, who was the daughter of Kate and Moses as the product of an interracial affair at the same church mentioned in the second tape. Jessabelle was killed on the night of her birth, along with her father, by Leon. On that night, Leon scolded Kate for being unfaithful, picked up Jessabelle from her crib and snapped her spine in half. After Kate laments as she holds her daughter's now-lifeless body, Leon pushed a baby carriage carrying her lifeless body and a porcelain doll inside into the bayou, weighing it down with stones to prevent it from resurfacing. Leon then drove up to Kate and Moses' church where he shot Moses and set the building ablaze, leaving Moses for dead in the burning church. Jessie realizes that she is the unwanted presence, being the newborn white girl adopted by Leon on that same night to cover up the murders.\nSwearing revenge, Kate and Moses planned to transfer Jessabelle's spirit to Jessie. Jessie is pushed by Kate and Moses' spirits towards the bayou and into it, where the biracial spirit of Jessabelle swims up and takes her mother's bracelet, resurfacing back in the same white physical body of Jessie.

Though Mukil eliminates Karthik from the contest, Sundar offers to produce a film with Karthik as the director, and both the judges storm out of the show. The next day, Sundar is annoyed that Karthik took his words seriously and came to meet him. He is uninterested in the script that Karthik wants to film, and instead suggests that he wants to make a gangster film along with the style of Nayakan, Thalapathi, The Godfather, etc. Karthik takes this suggestion to heart and sets his mind on documenting the life of a gangster and making a film script out of it.\nWith help from his journalist uncle, Karthik finds out about \"Assault\" Sethu, a ruthless gangster in the city of Madurai, and decides that he will make a film about Sethu's life. He travels to Madurai and enlists the help of a reluctant college friend Oorani, to conduct surveillance on Sethu and his men. Since Karthik and Oorani are afraid of approaching Sethu directly, they plot to develop contacts with two of Sethu's top henchmen. They also try to obtain information from an old shopkeeper, \"Petti Kadai\" Pazhani, who has been around since Sethu was a child. To get closer to Sethu, Karthik also puts up an act of reciprocating the love of Kayalvizhi, whose mother cooks for Sethu. Because of their various attempts to seek information about Sethu, they arouse the suspicion of Sethu's right-hand man Rasu, who puts an underling Sounder to watch Karthik and Oorani.

He and his gang members boast of their crimes and take Karthik along for their gang activities. Karthik gleefully documents everything and is ecstatic that he has a fantastic story in hand for his debut movie. When he is ready to leave Madurai with all the information that he ever needed, Kayal discovers that Karthik used her for information and is vengeful. Sethu invites him for a send-off party. During the partying, Kayal remarks that Sethu should act as the main character in the gangster film about his life. Sethu takes this seriously and threatens Karthik to direct the film with Sethu playing himself on screen. Distraught at the sudden turn of events, Karthik tries to flee out of Madurai but is caught by Sethu's gang. They also kidnap the producer of Karthik's film and force them both to make the gangster movie.\nKarthik reluctantly agrees but soon finds that Sethu and his men cannot act in front of a camera. He hires an acting coach Muthu, who sets up a rigorous teaching schedule for Sethu and his men. After a period of training, Muthu thinks that while the others are hopeless, Sethu has at least a sliver of acting talent. The production of the movie commences, and Karthik becomes quite frustrated with Sethu's acting ineptitude. Still, he perseveres with the movie and has Muthu coach Sethu in emotional crying scenes in between breaks. Finally, the production is wrapped. Sethu and his men are on cloud nine and create a great fanfare for the movie's release. The film releases, and during the first show, Sethu gets the shock of his life.

He edits and dubs over Sethu's voice in such a way that the film shows Sethu as a guy who achieves everything in life by crying. The film's title, A. Kumar is revealed to be Azhuguni (Crybaby) Kumar and not Assault Kumar as Sethu had thought. The film receives a tremendous response from the audience, who left theaters in tears after laughing their guts out. Sethu is mad at being made a fool to the world and searches for Karthik. However, Karthik and the rest of the crew go into hiding in anticipation of Sethu's wrath.\nWhile searching for Karthik and his crew, Sethu encounters events that make him realize that the fear that people have for him does not equal respect. He finds that by making people laugh inadvertently through his film, he had earned true respect than respect by fear, such as his mother, who never spoke to him, ever since he became a gangster and finally spoke to Sethu after seeing his film. In a final face-off, Sethu and Karthik meet each other by accident, as the latter is on his way to deliver the video recordings of the former's boastful confessions to the police. Sethu pardons Karthik in a dramatic way, and Karthik chooses to put Sethu's past behind him and let him seek a new life. They each go on to pursue careers in the movie industry.

Superman and the Justice League confront the Legion, dividing their forces to fight the Legion and destroy the satellites. In the ensuing space battle, Robin purposely crashes Batman's Batwing jet into the satellite array. Refusing to accept defeat, Captain Cold overloads the remaining satellite, which falls back to Earth and entombs Luthor in an ice sheet shortly before the satellite explodes. The League is triumphant and believes Luthor to be dead.\nIn the utopian future of the 31st century, teenage superheroes-in-training Dawnstar and Karate Kid are visiting a museum dedicated to the exploits of the Justice League. They find that Luthor has been in suspended animation for nearly a millennium after being discovered and excavated in the 29th century and placed on display. Karate Kid accidentally releases Luthor from the ice. Luthor awakes nearly 1,000 years into the future; he explores the museum, discovers Superman's secret identity and locates an ancient item called the Eternity Glass, which allows its user to manipulate the fabric of time and space. Taking Captain Cold's weapon, he freezes Dawnstar and Karate Kid. He then uses the Eternity Glass to unleash Time Trapper as his servant, allowing him to travel to the point when he last fought the League. Vengeful, Luthor plans to return and destroy Superman. The young heroes break free and follow.\nResuming control of the Legion, Luthor instructs Time Trapper to send his forces back in time to prevent the Kent family from adopting Kal-El in Smallville. The young heroes enlist the Justice League's aid to stop them, and travel to the Hall of Justice in Washington, D.C. After a misunderstanding, they explain their story and verify its validity through Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth. The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg travel into the past to prevent Bizarro, Toyman, Cheetah, and Solomon Grundy from sending the baby Kal-El back into space, while Superman and the rest of the League attempt to stall Luthor's Legion in the present.\nDespite the Justice League's efforts, the Legion sends Kal-El's ship away from Earth. Without Superman, there is nobody left in the past to inspire individuals with extraordinary abilities to become superheroes. This causes a temporal paradox, enabling Time Trapper to erase the Justice League in the present. Unwilling to risk being erased from existence, Dawnstar and Karate Kid retreat. In the absence of the Justice League, the Legion pillages the world, robbing banks and depositories, and leaving Washington D.C. in ruins. The young heroes realize that they can induce their own paradox by ensuring Lex Luthor's past counterpart never traveled to the 31st century so he could not steal the Eternity Glass and return to the past. The young heroes discover Luthor's confinement with Dawnstar's tracking ability, where Karate Kid breaks the ice and frees Luthor's earlier self. However, the Time Trapper is immune to the paradox because he exists outside the timeline, and with Luthor's counterpart freed, Time Trapper is  at liberty to do as he pleases because Luthor is no longer his master.\nThe Time Trapper banishes the future Luthor from existence and tries to remake the current world in his image. Superman and the Justice League, who exist again because of the latter's absence, confront the villain. Time Trapper is too powerful for the League to fight. Karate Kid discovers that Time Trapper is composed entirely of dark matter. Karate Kid realizes that only Dawnstar's light-based powers can defeat Time Trapper. Dawnstar charges Time Trapper and the League defeat him, reverting the Eternity Glass, which imprisons Time Trapper once more. The Justice League thanks the young heroes and offers them the opportunity to stay. Karate Kid and Dawnstar decline, stating they must return to their time.

Labs by Silas Stone, father of Victor Stone.\nSuperman, who fought with a Parademon previously and believes Batman and Green Lantern are working with it, fights the both of them; the two are hopelessly outmatched, with the battle only stopping when Batman calls him \"Clark\" and Superman discovers Batman is Bruce Wayne. The trio begin to work together against the Parademons. On the planet Apokolips, Darkseid orders Desaad to begin an invasion of Earth in response to the superheroes' discovery of his plans. Victor and Silas argue over Silas' belief that metahumans are more important than football. Superman, Batman and Green Lantern realize an invasion has begun when the box activates and several Boom Tubes appear throughout the world.\nThe Box in S.T.A.R. Labs explodes and creates a Boom Tube when Victor is holding it. The explosion fuses the technology inside the Box to Victor's wounded, mutilated body. As several Parademons attack, Silas takes Victor to a technologically advanced medical bed and uses experimental technologies on him. Countless Parademons appear and attack around the world. The Box's technology spliced with Victor's body fuses itself with the various technologies around the room. Victor is transformed into Cyborg, with a body capable of transforming and adapting itself, including obtaining new features. Just as the Flash saves the scientists, Cyborg discovers details of Apokolips, Darkseid, and the invasion plan. He learns that the Parademons are actually inhabitants of worlds conquered by Darkseid, spliced with his technology, allowing him to mind-control them into serving as an army for conquering other planets. Billy Batson sees a Parademon outside and mystically turns into the superhero Shazam. Air Force One is attacked in the air, but is saved by the Amazon princess Wonder Woman and Superman. After the heroes gather, Cyborg reveals that the invasion is a prelude to the terraforming of Earth. Darkseid arrives and proves to be an extremely powerful opponent and the entire Justice League is hopelessly outmatched.\nDarkseid uses his Omega Beams to fight Flash and Superman, who is incapacitated and captured by a Parademon. Batman prevents Green Lantern from going after them on his own with a broken arm. He tells Green Lantern to think about the lives at stake rather than his own image as a hero, and after unmasking himself, reveals that his parents' murders are what motivated him to fight evil. Bruce allows himself to be captured to save Superman. Green Lantern has the idea to strip Darkseid of his Omega Beams by destroying his eyes. Bruce goes through a portal to Apokolips, where he escapes the Parademon and stops DeSaad from turning Superman into a Parademon. Superman is left unstable and highly aggressive because of the brainwashing process, resulting in him strangling DeSaad to death and attacking Parademons and Batman. Batman reasons with him, and helps him reassert his own personality. On Earth, after Darkseid's eyes are destroyed by the Justice League, Cyborg reopens the Boom Tubes to send Darkseid and his army back to Apokolips. Darkseid fights back, and with Superman and Batman's assistance, the group eventually force him through the portal. With the world saved, the superheroes gain the public's trust and are honored at the White House.\nIn a post-credits scene, an Atlantean ship emerges from the ocean and Ocean Master appears carrying the dead body of his king.

Vadivambal (Vedhicka) joins as the female member in the group and soon falls in love with Kali. Meanwhile, Gomathi falls for Vadivu; however, Kali loves Rangamma (Anaika Soti), the princess of the zameen. S. V. Bhairava Sundaram (Ponvannan), who is another student of Swami, is a popular \"Rajapart\" (performing main title characters of a stage play). He becomes headstrong over his acting capabilities and does not attend the rehearsals, for which he gets scoldings from Swami. After a quarrel, he leaves the troupe as he could not bear Swami's torture. Swami does not give up and conducts an audition for the main character role of Soorapadman, in which Kali and Gomathi perform. Kali gets selected, which leaves Gomathi angry. The reason behind Swami's bias towards Kali is never answered clearly to Gomathi, which leaves him more frustrated.\nAfter following Kali secretly, Gomathi informs to Swami about Kali's love to take revenge on him. Swami scolds Kali and curses him that he will never play any characters in stage, but Kali wants Swami to pardon him and keep him with the troupe as a servant. Swami agrees and asks him to forget the princess if he wants to continue in the troupe. Kali promises, but Swami agrees to keep him with the troupe like a servant but does not take back the curse. The following day, the entire troupe leaves the village and heads to another place. Kali cannot forget Rangamma, and she is also shown to be searching Kali, and one night, a man from the village comes to Kali to inform that Rangamma has committed suicide due to the forcing of her parents to get married. The man also says that she was pregnant when she died. Kali, fully drunk, comes to the troupe and curses Swami that he is the reason for Rangamma's and his unborn child's death. Swami gets ill suddenly and dies, but before dying he blesses Kali, who pardons to forgive him, which drives Gomathi in more anger and jealousy. After Swami's death, Gomathi takes charge of the troupe and wants Kali to be out of it.

When they are getting ready to stage the play \"Karnamotcham\", Gomathi falls severely ill. He asks the people from his troupe to go in search of other drama actors to perform his role. A man goes and brings Kali, who is a drunkard now. Feeling delighted to see his troupe members, he agrees to play the role of \"Karnan\", though he is given the role of \"Arjuna\" by Gomathi, who says that it has been long since they performed together. Gomathi performed well, but surpassed by Kali as he sings a song and drives the attention of the audience to himself, Gomathi still feels ill and could not perform in any plays. Meanwhile, Kali fills the gap and earns a good reputation as \"Rajapart\", which makes Gomathi even more jealous.

Kali says that he knows it was Gomathi who told Swami about his frequent visits to Rangamma's place, and he also says that he knows the person who made him sent to jail was Gomathi's arrangement, but he took all these as good deeds that his elder brother did for him for positive changes in his life and forgave Gomathi each and every time. Gomathi now feels guilty, but Kali asks Gomathi to shoot him to death and fights with Gomathi. During the quarrel, the trigger is accidentally pressed, and Kali dies.

Zeman and Mills trace this to the Texarkana Moonlight Murders, an unsolved crime that was the basis for the early slasher film The Town That Dreaded Sundown. Zeman and Mills compare and contrast the film to the real-life events, and both to the urban legend. Neither the real-life events nor the film feature a killer with a hook for a hand, but they do have a serial killer who preys upon teenagers who make out at a lovers' lane.The Candyman\nZeman and Mills travel to Houston, Texas, to investigate the urban legend of poisoned candy. Though they dismiss the widespread belief that strangers have handed out poisoned candy to neighborhood children, Zeman and Mills describe Ronald Clark O'Bryan, a man who poisoned his own son for insurance money and used the urban legend to deflect suspicion from himself. To mask his son's murder, O'Bryan also attempted to kill several other children, but they did not eat their poisoned candy. O'Bryan was convicted and executed for the crimes.The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs\nIn Columbia, Missouri, Zeman and Mills investigate the legend of The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs, in which a babysitter is harassed and ultimately killed by a man already inside the house. Although there are no documented cases of serial killers who have targeted babysitters, Zeman and Mills describe how Janett Christman was murdered while babysitting. An African-American man was convicted of a similar murder four years earlier and executed for the murder, but Zeman and Mills question whether he was guilty. They instead point to an acquaintance who knew Christman was babysitting and had become obsessed with her.The Killer Clown\nIn Chicago, Zeman and Mills investigate the evil clown trope and associated \"phantom clown\" sightings across the world. In these cases, children report having seen a suspicious clown that attempts to entice them into an unmarked van, presumably to kidnap them. Zeman and Mills express skepticism and explain it as a manifestation of coulrophobia, the fear of clowns. They trace this urban legend to John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer who unrelatedly worked as a clown.

Rana grows up, where he trains in weaponry, and be a fearless warrior. Due to his fighting skills and bravery, he soon wins the confidence of the king of Kalingapuri, Raja Mahendran, who promotes him as Commander-in-chief of the Kalingapuri army. The son of Raja Mahendran, Veera Mahendran shows Rana around the kingdom's mine where the captured soldiers of Kottaipattinam work as slaves. Veera says that this information is known only to a few people. After this, Rana promotes a war strategy to Veera that they release the slaves and have them trained in the army of Kalingapuri. Veera agrees and the slaves are freed. He then gets Raja Mahendran's approval to attack Kottaipattinam. However, during the war, Rana encounters his childhood friend, crown prince Sengodagan, the son of Rishikodagan, king of Kottaipattinam. Instead of fighting, it is revealed that the main motive of Rana's plan was to free the soldiers of Kottipattinam. Immediately signalling an end to the war, he, along with the soldiers disown Kalingapuri and return to Kottaipattinam, much to the disgust of Raja Mahendran and his son, crown prince Veera Mahendran, who swear revenge on Rana for tricking them and betraying Kalingapuri.\nAt Kottaipattinam, Rana and Sengodagan renew their friendship. Sengodagan introduces Rana to Rishikodagan, who is alarmed about seeing him. Rana also reunites with his younger sister Yamuna Devi whom he last saw as a baby and their uncle, who raised her, but soon learns that his mother Yaaghavi is dead and Sena is missing. He soon learns that Yamuna and Sengodagan are in love with each other. He accepts their relationship and decides to get them married. He cleverly convinces Rishikodagan, who is unwilling to get his son married to Yamuna since she is a commoner. Meanwhile, Rana also rekindles his love with his childhood sweetheart, princess Vadhana Devi, the daughter of Rishikodagan. Soon, Sengodagan and Yamuna get married. But following the wedding, Rishikodagan disowns Sengodagan.\nThat night, a masked man barges into the palace and attempts to kill Rishikodagan. Vadhana immediately goes after him, fights him, and gets him captured. Rishikodagan unmasks the assassin who is revealed to be Rana, and immediately throws him into prison, sentencing him to death. An upset Vadhana rushes to the cell where Rana is imprisoned, where Rana tells her why he attempted to kill Rishikodagan. Rana tells Vadhana that he is the younger son of Kochadaiiyaan, the former Commander-in-Chief of Kottaipattinam's army. Kochadaiiyaan is extremely respected in Kottaipattinam for his bravery and is more popular than Rishikodagan himself.\nDue to this, Rishikodagan becomes jealous of Kochadaiiyaan. One night, when Kochadaiiyaan is returning by ship to Kottaipatinam with his army after buying horses and ammunition, they are attacked by the rival army of Kalingapuri. Kochadaiiyaan defeats them but allows them to return to their kingdom as an act of chivalry. However, the Kalingapuri army, before leaving, poisons the food on the ship. The Kottaipattinam army men consume this food, and fall ill. Despite knowing that he had been tricked by the Kalingapuri army, Kochadaiiyaan immediately rushes to Kalingapuri itself, because it is the only land body close enough to provide medicines to the sick and dying soldiers. He orders Raja Mahendran to provide medical assistance to his soldiers. Raja Mahendran, in turn, cunningly proposes a deal that, if he wants his men to be saved, he has to leave all the horses, ammunition, and the sick army men in Kalingapuri as slaves. Only if Kochadaiiyan agrees to this, his soldiers will be nursed back to health. Kochadaiiyan thinks that his men rather be alive as slaves than die from poisoning, and also thinks that when they officially wage a war in the near future, all of them could be easily rescued. So he accepts Raja Mahendran's offer and leaves Kalingapuri all alone. When he returns to Kottaipattinam, the jealous Rishikodagan seizes this opportunity to strip Kochadaiiyan off all respect and dignity and sentences him to death for becoming a traitor to Kottaipattinam because of surrendering his army men, horses, and ammunition to Kalingapuri.\nThough all his subjects are dismayed at Kochadaiiyaan being sentenced to death, and his wife Yaaghavi even goes to the extent of publicly rebuking Rishikodagan for his injustice, Rishikodagan stands firm in his decision. Kochadaiiyaan is beheaded the following morning before Rana's eyes. In present, Rana tells Vadhana that he ran away to Kalingapuri, with the intention of freeing the soldiers of Kottaipattinam and to take revenge on Rishikodagan for unjustly killing his father. Vadhana is shocked on hearing about her father's actions and reconciles with Rana. She then pleads with her father to release Rana, but to no avail. Meanwhile, Rana escapes from the prison. When Rishikodagan learns of Rana's escape, he immediately arranges for Vadhana's marriage with prince Veera Mahendran after consulting with an astrologer and learning that his life is at Rana's mercy. Despite the enmity between Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri, he arranges this marriage with the hope that their united armies and their mutual hatred for Rana can subdue him. On the day of the marriage, Rana arrives just when the marriage is about to take place. He and the people of Kottapattinam berate Rishikodagan for becoming a traitor and surrendering the whole kingdom of Kottaipattinam to Raja Mahendran for his own personal interests and commitments, which was the same charge that Rishikodagan had placed on Kochadaiiyaan years ago.\nFollowing this, a war starts between Rana and the united armies of Kottaipattinam and Kalingapuri. Rana successfully manages to subdue the armies of both kingdoms and along with a majority of Kottaipattinam's army, he kills Raja Mahendran and allows Veera Mahendran to return as he was defeated, reminding him of their friendship. He then fights Rishikodagan and beheads him. Finally, as Rana and Vadhana reunite, a young soldier comes towards them riding a horse.

Enraged, Warnock rushes to interrogation and brutally kills Hume in front of Heggie and Mundie. Heggie is threatened into remaining silent.\nCaesar confesses to Heggie about hitting the girl, but Six says it is too late for redemption, as the girl had died two minutes earlier where Caesar left her next to the road.

Heggie fights Mundie and Warnock, who nearly succeed in strangling her, until the sudden return of Macready, now insane, wrapped in barbed wire, wielding a shotgun and quoting verses from the Bible. He shoots and kills Warnock, then wounds both Heggie and Mundie as they barricade themselves in the cells. While Macready sets the building on fire, Six makes references to his true identity, of losing an argument with \"an old friend\" about human sin, and being an outcast like Heggie. He offers to help her, but only if she asks him to. She refuses.\nWhile escaping, Mundie slips and cuts her throat on a broken window and is killed by Macready's pressing of her throat further onto the broken glass with his rifle butt, and then Macready further wounds Heggie before killing Caesar with his gun after scarring his face. Heggie throws Macready's fuel can at him, which he accidentally shoots. Mortally wounded in the explosion, he quotes a final bible verse. Heggie responds \"Amen\" and kills him by crushing his face with a battering ram. Heggie escapes the police station, and Six appears, unburnt, with his notebook, which he reveals has everybody's name inside. He crosses off every name except Heggie's and condemns the others to Hell for their various sins: Mundie and Warnock as \u201cadulterers and betrayers who dare to weigh justice in their own hands\u201d as the married Warnock had been having an affair with Mundie, Beswick as a hypocrite, Macready as a pervert, Hume as being \u201ccowardly and vicious\u201d, and Caesar for both hitting the girl with his car and being too weak to confess.

Strict but kindly foreman Don Gaspar leads a crew of miners in a newly excavated silver mine, where they are close to reaching the silver deposit. The miners discover a sinister shrine, prompting Gaspar to call company owner Gustav Rousseau: the Frenchman seems unsurprised at the discovery and orders the mine closed despite Gaspar's objections about how badly his men need the jobs. That night, despite his young daughter Valentina's misgivings, Gaspar and the miner Rosendo decide to speak to Rousseau and demand the mine's reopening.\nGaspar and Rosendo witness Rousseau taking a human-shaped bundle down into the mines. They follow him to the shrine discovered earlier in the day, where Rousseau sets up two crystals and initiates a ritual that will allow his fianc\u00e9 Denise (who he says was taken from him by a disease) to return to life. Greed overpowers Rosendo's caution and leads him to jump into the shrine mid-ritual, intent on stealing the god Mictlantecuhtli's offerings of jewelry. The sacrilege angers the god, who makes Rosendo vanish. Gaspar seizes the opportunity to steal one of the crystals and disrupt the ritual, as he believes the dead should not be returned. He manages to hide the crystal before a furious Rousseau catches up to him. Rousseau performs a temporary life-draining spell upon Gaspar and abandons him beside a pile of lit explosives. Gaspar's last thoughts are for his daughter, Valentina. Back on the surface the explosion draws the miners and the gendarmes, who assume Gaspar has turned rogue and set the explosion on purpose.\nLater, Leo San Juan\u2019s group is seen fleeing from mummified corpses through the deserted streets of Guanajuato. They are saved by a robed boy who claims to be \"Luis\", who tells them to take refuge in the market. There, the locals are wary of the group for being outsiders while a shadowy figure stalks Leo. He runs into Luis again and together they attempts to save a woman from mummies, after which the boy reluctantly agrees to team up with Leo. They realize that the mummies are harmless, intent on  getting back to the lives they lived (an old teacher lumbers back to school and performs role call, a father returns home to his family). Back at the market, Don Andr\u00e9s falls for Gloria, a woman who owns a stand of love spells. While to Don Andr\u00e9s she looks very beautiful, Gloria is in fact quite homely. Alebrije meets another alebrije named Evaristo, who claims he can help them find Xochitl. The group becomes involved in a brawl when Alebrije calls Gloria ugly in front of her father, and the gendarmes takes them to the local judge for disturbing the peace and stealing three tangerines. The judge orders them put in a holding cell.\nGloria visits Don Andr\u00e9s in the holding cell. When he still considers her beautiful after Alebrije removes the 'magic' bracelet, her father becomes convinced of his sincerity and takes them to meet a powerful wizard who can tell them what has happened. The powerful wizard turns out to be Gloria's father. When he drinks, he turns into an old and powerful alebrije wizard named Sulik. Sulik tells them that Xochitl is being held captive in the mines by Rousseau, who used her as bait to lure his true intended victim: Leo. As a soul tempered by encounters with the supernatural, Leo is the sacrifice Rousseau needs to return his fianc\u00e9 to life. After Gloria's father turns back into a human, he drops charges against the group and allows them to go free (but only once the judge marries Gloria and Don Andr\u00e9s).\nOut on the streets, Luis and Leo run into the mummies of twelve convicts who died in a fire and were left unclaimed: unlike the other mummies, these are hell bent on harm and destruction. Luis's hood gets ripped off during the fight, revealing 'he' is in fact Valentina. She decided to hide her identity to escape the gendarmes and clear her father's name. They make it to the mines, where they are captured by Rousseau and taken back to the shrine. Despite an intervention from an undead Gaspar and the timely arrival of Teodora and the rest, Rousseau takes Valentina hostage and forces Leo enter the shrine. With Leo's soul as the conduit, Denise returns to life. Though Denise is glad to see Rousseau, she quickly realizes the havoc he has caused and insists that the dead have no place among the living. Despite Rousseau's selfish insistences, Denise vanishes. When a distraught Rousseau dives into Mictlantecuhtli's shrine after her, the angered god takes his life. Xochitl releases Leo from the shrine.\nThe undead Gaspar reappears, carrying the toy raccoon that Valentina used to send with the basket when she lowered supplies into the mine. He also gives her a note where he promises he'll be with her in her heart and memories, then hands her the altar's missing stone.

His father rejects the philosophy that all animals should be treated equally, saying that humans are superior beings, therefore unequal treatment of animals is justified. As Ohad's father rants, tension begins to rise. Ohad explains that similar arguments have been made to hurt others throughout history, and that people must empathize with animals and speak out for them. After some exchanges, Ohad becomes outraged, cursing at this father and storming out of the apartment.\nOhad is next shown doing vegan outreach in the city, educating passersby on the injustice of animal use. He and several others then travel to a facility where they rescue injured baby chicks from a dumpster outside the facility.

He says that he feels like he's failed in every aspect of his life except for in his defense of animals.\nAt his next family dinner, Ohad tells his family about the chickens he helped rescue.

Ohad and his brother argue about legality versus morality in terms of their merits and shortcomings.\nIn a dramatic public demonstration, Ohad (and several others) protest animal agriculture by being held down and branded as Ohad's parents and passersby look on. Ohad screams in pain as the hot brand touches his chest, and his mother cries. Next, demonstrators take away the baby of a woman activist and rip her shirt open, squeezing a milk pump against her breast in protest of the dairy industry.\nIn his final family dinner of the film, Ohad's brother argues that vegans are not ethical because they may accidentally step on insects, and because harvesting crops results in the death of some rodents.

Dropping off the car she borrowed from her uncle, she is enraged at how he could be so nonchalant about the illness of his brother. Her uncle and mother become defensive and Eleanor storms out, declaring she will never return and escorts Reggie back home.\nAs the summer is nearly over, Reggie has formed a close bond with Eleanor, but her job is only temporary and another sitter has arrived to take over.

The dam inspector is ordered to report that the dam is unfit to remain, by the corrupt local MP Nagabhushan, who wants the dam demolished for his benefit. When the former refuses, Nagabhushan stabs him to death. The dying man throws a pen drive (disguised as a rudraksha) containing the details certifying the dam's integrity, into an abandoned Shiva temple near the dam and warns the village head Karunakaran, who arrives upon hearing his cries, that the temple has to be opened as soon as possible, before dying. Karunakaran firmly believes that the temple can only be opened by the descendant of Raja Lingeshwaran, an erstwhile king who built the dam as well as the temple. Lakshmi, the granddaughter of Karunakaran and a journalist, embarks on a search to find the descendant. She soon discovers the person - Lingeswaran aka Lingaa. Lingaa, the grandson of Raja Lingeshwaran, is a witty thief, living in poverty. He bears a grudge against his grandfather, firmly believing his \"squandering nature\" as the root cause of his poverty. Consequently, he refuses to accompany Lakshmi to Solaiyur.\nUndeterred, Lakshmi follows Lingaa and records his gang's act of stealing a priceless necklace and implicates them, thus forcing him to accompany her to Solaiyur. At Solaiyur, Lingaa receives a warm welcome from the villagers. Later, Karunakaran privately tells Lingaa that the Lingam installed at the Shiva temple is made of Emerald stone, an extremely valuable artifact. At midnight, he infiltrates the Shiva temple to steal the Lingam. Unfortunately, he is noticed by one of the dam's security guards, who immediately alert the villagers. Aware of their presence, Lingaa quickly and wittingly changes his act to an appearance of performing a pooja, thus fooling the villagers.  A relieved Karunakaran then narrates the true story of Lingaa's heritage.\nRaja Lingeshwaran, the ruler of the erstwhile princely state of Kodiyur, is shown to be a civil services officer and the collector of Madurai district. Upon surveying the village of Solaiyur, he receives complaints from the local villagers, stating that they have no water for nine months per year while facing raging floods for the other three months - which has led to recurring and devastating famines. Determined to help, he petitions to construct a dam, for the benefit of Solaiyur. However, his plan is rejected at the annual collectors' meeting and he is instead forced to approve another infrastructure project. He refuses to do so and is blackmailed of being dismissed for his non-compliance. In defiance, Lingeshwaran resigns from his position.\nLater, several members of the Indian royalty and British officers congregate to celebrate Lingeshwaran's birthday. Among them is Collector Lawrence Hunter, the officer who had opposed Raja Lingeshwaran's plan. He is shocked to discover Lingeshwaran's real identity. Over dinner, Lingeshwaran notifies the British Governor of his resignation and expresses his wish to construct a dam at Solaiyur, with his capital. He requests approval from the British Government, which is granted. The Collector challenges Raja Lingeshwaran that he will never finish building the dam. Though Lingeshwaran faces multiple difficulties and a near stoppage of work due to caste issues (which were ignited by Sambandam, a resident shown to be working as a spy), the dam is constructed with the help of the villagers, who turn out to be very co-operative with Lingeshwaran. Bharathi, the daughter of a senior villager falls in love with Raja Lingeshwaran. Finally, the dam is almost complete, except for the shaft doors. The doors are found to be held in the collector's possession. With the floods soon to occur, Lingeshwaran negotiates with the collector and tries to persuade him to give in. As a dirty trick, the latter proposes that if the shaft doors are to be handed over, Lingeshwaran must hand over the villagers' land as a bribe and the credit for constructing the dam, to which he reluctantly agrees. Sambandam discreetly brings the villagers to the collector's residence at the same time and tricks them into believing that Lingeshwaran is a puppet of the British, thus manipulating them.\nAfter the dam's completion, the infuriated villagers reprimand Lingeshwaran for his \"malicious actions\" and banishes him from Solaiyur, despite Bharati's protests. Fully knowing the double-play behind him, Lingeshwaran leaves and is later accompanied by Bharati. The collector's wife, Jenny, disgusted at her husband's behavior, angrily reveals to the villagers that they have been double-crossed and reveals the real terms that Lingeshwaran had agreed to. The villagers, upon realizing their double play, pursue Sambandam, who commits suicide out of guilt. Jenny decides to leave with her daughter but is stopped by her husband, having realized his folly. Upon her insistence, he publicly declares that the dam was constructed by  Lingeshwaran. After a long search, the villagers find him and Bharathi, now his wife, living in poverty. After unsuccessfully trying to convince him to return to Solaiyur, the villagers resolve to keep the Shiva temple (which he had built), closed until the Raja or his descendants return to the village. Lingaa, on hearing his grandfather's story, changes his opinion about his grandfather and decides to mend his ways.\nIn the present, Karunakaran reveals that his invitation to Lingaa was merely a ruse, as he believes that danger is afoot; recalling the fate of the dam inspector. At a function, Nagabhushan reveals to an accomplice that he plans to drill small holes into the dam, which would be filled with explosives; when triggered, would destroy the dam. Lakshmi secretly records Nagabhushan's conversation with the help of a spy camera and plays it before the entire town, exposing Nagabhushan. Lingaa then reveals that he had already discovered the pen drive and had the dam's certificate approved, copied, and spread throughout the Internet; ultimately culminating in Nagabhushan being ousted from his position. Enraged, he kidnaps Lakshmi and escapes in a hot air balloon. Having a bomb with him, he plans to detonate it over the dam, to spite Lingaa. Lingaa pursues him on a bike and drives it over a ledge at the exact time Nagabhushan's balloon appears on it, landing on top of it; he manages to climb into the carriage. After an ensuing fight, he kicks Nagabhushan out, who plunges to his death in the water below and kicks the bomb into the reservoir, which explodes moments later, thus saving the dam. With his work done, Lingaa plans to leave. However, the police finally catch up to him, demanding that he testify for an inquiry (about his recent jewel heist).

He then handcuffs Sarah's right hand to the bed.\nOver the course of the movie, as the five men discuss what to do with the body, Luke, Chris, Marty, and Philip drug Vincent, strip and handcuff him to the body on the bed. Before Vincent passes out completely, Chris tells him about Sarah's suicide and the contents of her note. While being questioned by the police, Vincent tells them of the setup, but they do not believe him as the only prints found were Vincent's and Sarah's. They also have the DVDs of his sexual exploits, except the ones with Mimi, Ann, and Zoe; they won't believe him that Luke made the videos and the DVDs of the other men were not found. The police also mention that all four men have alibis for that morning \u2014 Chris and Luke were seen together having breakfast, Marty was at his office, Philip has an alibi from his father-in-law (who was blackmailed with information about his own cheating, information Philip had because he knew Vincent used that same information to blackmail his father-in-law to be awarded a contract on a project).\nReleasing Chris from interrogation, Detective Huggins tells him that Vincent has been arrested for murder; he is surprised as he thought Vincent would only be implicated in Sarah's suicide. The detective further states that the pills did not kill Sarah, that her wrist cuts were not self-inflicted, the prints on the knife were Vincent's and they didn't find a suicide note. The surprised Chris thanks Huggins and leaves. Outside the police station, he reaches into his jacket pocket, only to find that the suicide note Luke gave to him is gone. He then walks to the loft and confronts Luke about the missing note. After initially denying that he had it, Luke leads Chris to the note, which was in the garbage. Chris looks at the note and wonders why Luke would get rid of the only evidence of the attempted suicide, speculating that Luke, not Sarah, was the author of the note. Luke then tells Chris everything; he framed Vincent, because he was attracted to Sarah himself, and felt that Vincent stood between him and Sarah.\nWe see that Luke had gone after Sarah the night she almost told Vincent's wife about the affair. He told her that Vincent was using her and not worth it, and that he could treat her better. She rebuffs him, saying she felt nothing for Luke. Hurt, Luke turns around to find that his wife saw him talking to Sarah. When Sarah returned to visit Vincent at the loft, Luke showed up and drugged Sarah, trying to kill her \u2014 out of \"love\" \u2014 with an insulin overdose. He then staged the suicide with the pills, champagne bottle, and suicide note. Chris then tells him that Vincent is being charged with murder as Sarah hadn't been dead when they left her with Philip. Luke then states that technically it was Philip who killed Sarah and that he will clean the situation up. When Chris says no more cleaning up, Luke pulls out a kitchen knife and threatens him. Sirens can be heard and Chris says he called the police, told them everything and that it is over. He and Luke struggle, and he gets the knife from Luke. Luke tells Chris to tell Ellie and his family that he's sorry; he then jumps from the loft's balcony, killing himself.\nSix months later, Mimi and Marty are reconciled, Philip is facing trial for manslaughter, and Chris is divorced, sharing custody of his children. He runs into Ann after leaving a bar, and she asks if he needs the loft key, that he had given her for them to meet up. Chris mentions the key would not work as Vincent now lives at the loft, since it was all his wife left him with from their divorce. Chris mentions that he heard Ann left the city councilman, one of her clients as a prostitute, and she replies that he was not the only thing she gave up, implying that she's no longer in that line of work.

At a meeting of The Works, Fujiko is hailed as the culprit behind the theft (thanks to her machinations), and Thomas Dawson, the leader of the organization and Lupin's mentor, shows them the most valuable item in The Works' possession: the Crimson Heart of Cleopatra, a necklace commissioned by Mark Antony to symbolize his love for the Queen of the Nile. However, a ruby of Cleopatra's intended to complete the necklace is missing.

Juan and Pedro deduce that Quini and Sebasti\u00e1n were luring the young women of the town, who were aching to leave and find their own independence through work, by passing these brochures around and then entrapping them into sexual slavery at a local hunting lodge.\nWaters grow murky, however, when Pedro becomes aware of Juan's past shooting of a girl at a protest during the Franco Era. Pedro is also angered after a possible third culprit, a local factory owner named Alfonso Corrales, is brushed over, most likely due to complex political ties. The two continue on, though, eventually deducing Sebasti\u00e1n's cover as the watchman of the hunting lodge. Pedro attempts to follow and observe Sebasti\u00e1n's white Dyane 6, but loses him. With the help of a local poacher named Jes\u00fas, the trio finally chases Sebasti\u00e1n into the marshes. All three are shot by the sniping Sebasti\u00e1n, though as he is about to slay Pedro, Juan is able to sneak up and stab him, which he does repeatedly, in a state. After Sebasti\u00e1n falls dead into the swamp, Juan opens the trunk of the car to rescue a bruised but still alive Marina.\nThe town is brought peace after the case is solved, as well as by the local worker's union accepting a pay raise (which in principle, they felt was too low). All seems well for the detectives, too, as Pedro sees a promotion and relocation closer to his own home and wife. On the final night of their stay, however, Pedro receives photographs from a journalist who has helped on the case. Though Juan justified his shooting story by saying it was his former partner's actions, the journalist reveals that he had in fact been a brutal officer in Franco's notorious secret police, and to have once been known as \"The Crow\".\nIn the morning, before they drive home, Juan asks a stoney-faced Pedro if they \"are good\".

She immediately rejects his advice, answering the door for a costumed stranger who turns out to be Graham, a classmate of Kaylie's who she has a crush on. Graham was expecting Daphne to answer the door; he has been visiting Daphne at the house whenever she babysits, which comes as both a surprise to Kaylie, and a devastating blow. When he leaves, she cuts herself, revealing a series of scars. Meanwhile, a masked man, carrying a large knife, is lurking the streets and prowling the dark shadows surrounding the Payton house.\nWhen Kaylie realizes the masked man is out there, she begins to tease him and taunt him into confrontation, assuming he is just another prankster. When she is convinced he is quietly watching from behind the trees, she strips down to her underwear and swims in the Paytons' pool. Things intensify quickly when Daphne shows up and is brutally murdered. The masked stranger then breaks into the house, attacking Kaylie, who fights back by bashing him with a free-weight and sending him tumbling down the stairs. He removes his mask to reveal the man underneath and overpowers her.\nIt is within his power to kill her now, and instead of begging for her life, she encourages him to do it. The man, who is far less intimidating without his mask on, does not know how to react. He eventually decides against killing her, and sets her free. The two start talking, and soon a strange, twisted romance blossoms between them. They head into the neighborhood to cause a little mischief themselves, and gradually, over the course of the night, begin to reveal to each other what makes them tick.\nKaylie and the man have sex, but when she asks him to stab her during, he becomes disturbed and goes outside to think. Meanwhile, the middle school vandals return to seek revenge on Kaylie and are brutally murdered outside the house.\nKaylie and the man have a final conversation in which the man explains that he has a family he must go home to and that he does not have the strength to go through with killing anyone, as he had previously thought. They say goodbye and Kaylie slices his throat with a carving knife, revealing that she has been the killer all along, responsible for Daphne and the middle schoolers' deaths. She explains that she was always unstable and that discovering about Daphne and Graham's affair caused her to snap.\nLater, the police investigate the crime scene and we learn that Kaylie has pinned all the murders on the masked man.

Clermont is mortally wounded and dies when Garfield is unable to find medical help. Meanwhile, Simone reconsiders when Granger shows her the Nero Decree, which orders the destruction of all German possessions if Hitler dies or Germany falls, and she sees him return a painting looted from a Jewish family to its rightful place in their empty home. She provides a comprehensive ledger she has compiled that provides valuable information on the stolen art and the rightful owners.\nEven as the team learns that the artwork is being stored in various mines and castles, it also learns that it must now compete against the Soviet Union, which is seizing artwork from its occupation zone as war reparations. Meanwhile, Colonel Wegner is systematically destroying whole art caches. Eventually, the team has some success, as it discovers at least one mine hiding over 16,000 art pieces.

During the fight, a prism from the idol of the goddess explodes. The brothers are frightened and immediately stop the fight. After conducting certain rituals, they find that the goddess is angry because of the bloodshed that happened, and it is decided that the treasure will be locked for 41 years.\nIn the present, Bhai Ji is a con artist, who disguises himself as John Cliff and successfully loots \u20b9100 crore (US$13 million) from a wedding along with his assistants Abbas and Priya. At that time, his acquaintance Javed introduces him to Nikhil Adharva \"Nikki\", who tells Bhai Ji about the royal treasure and the story behind it. He shows the list of royal family members, who are inheriting the treasure. They are Ravindra Varma's sons Vasudeva Varma and Sri Krishna Varma and Mahendra Varma's sons Shekhara Varma, who is the royal head and Rajashekhara Varma. Nikki tells that Rajashekhara Varma has moved to the court, stating that the treasure should be given back to the government and used for helping the public rather than dividing among themselves. The case is pending in the court, and this will be the right chance to steal the treasure. Bhai Ji demands \u20b9500 crore (US$63 million) for doing the job and an advance of \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) before doing it.\nMeanwhile, the family arranges security arrangements as they fear a heist, and the police department sends DYSP Sajan to guard the family and treasure. They appoint a private consultant named Sivaram from Jaipur to assess the value of the treasure, but before he reaches there, Bhai Ji kidnaps him and takes him to his place. Rajashekara Varma takes Bhai Ji to the royal palace, where he meets the other family members. Later, the cellar is opened, and Bhai Ji begins assessing the value of the treasure. He realizes that this is the riskiest mission he has ever attempted. Meanwhile, Rajashekhara Varma is attacked by some goons, and before they could kill him, Bhai Ji arrives, and defeats the goons. Rajashekhara Varma thanks Bhai Ji for saving his life, but Sajan and Saraswathy, who is Rajashekhara Varma's daughter, have suspicions. Nikki and Javed arrive along with the real Sivaram and meet Bhai Ji, who gives the video clippings of the treasures and tells Nikki to make a replica of it. Nikki agrees and leaves. \nMeanwhile, Rajashekar has become friends with Bhai Ji and tells him about Sarawathy and shows him the school run by her, which is still under construction. Bhai Ji and his assistants decided to find out a way to steal the treasure from the cellar. He guesses that there should be a secret path behind the cellar that would lead to another exit after studying the architecture of several other palaces. In the night, the three of them leave to search for the door. Bhai Ji enters the cellar and, using a metal detector, finds the passage and the exit point. Before leaving out of the cellar, he talks to the idol and tells that there is a secret between them, which is also known to someone else. Sajan accidentally tells the other family members regarding Saraswathy's past, which only he and Rajashekara Varma knew. Saraswathy was assaulted by unknown people when she was only 12 years old, and Rajashekhara Varma had adopted her after that incident. \nInitially, he had instructed Sajan to try to find the culprits, but later on, seeing that it would be futile, he asked Sajan, who was the CI at that point in time, to close the case. Upon the knowledge of Saraswathy's past, Rajashekhara Varma's daughters and their husbands threaten him to withdraw the case that he had filed with the court, or else they would file another case to re-investigate the issue. An infuriated Rajashekhara Varma starts to hit Sajan, and Bhai Ji intervenes. Rajashekhara Varma narrates the incident to Bhai Ji. 15 years back, Sajan was chasing a thief, who had robbed a bank, and on the way, he encountered an unconscious Saraswathy, and takes her to the hospital, where he informs Rajashekhara Varma, who was the local MLA. Though they tried to find the culprits, they didn't succeed. Rajashekhara Varma tells Sajan not to charge any case as it would affect Saraswathy's  future, and Rajashekhara Varma adopts her. \nSajan also tells Bhai Ji that though he had a suspicion on him, he is now convinced that Bhai Ji is innocent and that he has found out the people, who were behind the attack on Rajashekhara Varma and that he was planning to meet them at night when a party will be conducted at the palace. Bhai Ji tells that it is dangerous for Sajan to go alone and he would accompany him, but Sajan refuses Bhai Ji's help. Saraswathy arrives at the palace, along with Rajashekhara Varma and tells the family members that they can do whatever they want, but her father wouldn't withdraw the case. Shekara Varma comes in defence of Saraswathy and promises her that no one will harm her. Bhai Ji is disturbed, and when asked by Abbas and Priya, he tells them that he was the thief that Sajan was chasing, and on the way, he saw three people chasing Saraswathy. He extended his hand to help her while he was driving, but she missed it. Bhai Ji became confused about whether to stop and save the girl or run away as the cops were right behind him. \nHe decided to move away from there to avoid getting caught. He tells them that from that day, the incident used to haunt him and he was shocked to see the girl again. That night after the party, Nikki and the gang arrive with the duplicate treasure, and they begin the heist. Bhai Ji enters the cellar through the secret tunnel, and Nikki places a GPS inside the boxes to make sure that Bhai Ji doesn't cheat them. After taking the treasure out, Nikki informs Bhai Ji that the final transaction will be in Jaipur, and Abbas can come with them so that Bhai Ji can trust them. The next day Bhai Ji submits his evaluation report, and before he leaves, the cops arrive there and informs them that Sajan has been murdered and arrest Rajashekhara Varma as he is the main suspect. Bhai Ji leaves for Jaipur. Javed and Nikki tell him that they are not going to pay him anything and he should return the \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) if he wants Abbas back. \nBhai Ji tells them that a few more people have to arrive and tells them that he has brought the third party (unknown entity) that teamed up with Nikki and hired him for the heist. The unknown entity happens to be Shekhara Varma and his son Sudhakara Varma, who was captured by Bhai Ji's henchman Bittoo when they arrived to Jaipur for the final transaction. Bhai Ji tells Shekhara Varma that he knows him well about him and he is not a simple person like others, but a wicked person. He tells him that it was the goddess which told him the truth. When Bhai Ji was searching for the door to a secret tunnel inside the cellar, he finds an old bullet stuck on the walls, and he realized how the prism broke. During the fight, when Vasudeva Varma was going to strike Shekara Varma with a sword, he secretly had a gun with which he shot at the prism.\nMahendra Varma learnt about his son's evil intentions and lied to others about the goddess's wrath and locked the cellar as a punishment for Shekhara Varma. Though he was happy with getting one-fourth of the treasure, he was upset when his brother Rajashekhara Varma filed a case, and this prompted him to join with Nikki and plan a heist. Even he was the one who planned to kill Rajashekhara Varma so that if he dies, Vasudeva Varma and Sri Krishna Varma would become the suspects, and they will begin to distrust each other while Shekhara Varma can move forward with the case and extend the time for a heist. Bhai Ji knows that Sudhakara Varma was the one who killed Sajan, and Abbas had secretly shot the murder in his phone upon Bhai Ji's instructions, and the visuals have been sent to the cops. A fight ensues, and after some time, Abbas has Nikki at gunpoint after Bhai Ji defeats him. \nJaved begs for mercy, and Bhai Ji tells him to take the van having the treasure to a place along with Sudhakara Varma and Sivaram. After they leave, he tells Nikki and Shekhara Varma that Abbas had planted a bomb in the van and presses the button triggering a blast which kills the three of them, and kills Nikki. Bhai Ji leaves a gun back, telling Shekara Varma that it was destiny that brought him there for the job and he had never stolen the treasure. Instead, he exchanged the treasure between the boxes along with the boxes and that he got \u20b9250 crore (US$31 million) for doing nothing. He also leaves telling that Shekhara Varma can choose his punishment. Shekara Varma commits suicide. Two years later, Saraswathy's school has been completed, and Bhai Ji visits Saraswathy and Rajashekhara Varma, who thank him for all the help he did, like funding for the school, helping Rajashekhara Varma to win the case and also saving him from the Sajan's murder case. Bhai Ji confesses to Sarawathy that he was the man who had offered his hand to save her, but couldn't do it, and he tells them that this is his only confession.

Constantine and Dominic steal paintings from a museum during the show.\nThe next morning, Interpol agent Jean Pierre Napoleon and CIA agent Sam Eagle grudgingly team up to apprehend the culprit whom Napoleon believes to be his nemesis \"The Lemur\" - the number-two criminal in the world.\nMeanwhile, Kermit attempts several escapes from the Gulag but is thwarted each time by warden Nadya, who is as infatuated with him as Piggy is. Thus uncaring that the real Constantine is free, Nadya orders Kermit to help organize The Siberian Gulag Revue, the prisoners' annual talent show.\nFollowing hidden instructions on the stolen painting, Constantine and Dominic divert the tour to Madrid. Constantine allows the Muppets to perform whatever they wish. During this show, Constantine and Dominic break into a museum and destroy a roomful of busts to find a key needed for their plan. Even though the performance is a disaster, the Muppets receive critical acclaim. Sam and Napoleon deduce that the connection between the crimes is the Muppet tour, and the pair interrogates the Muppets, only for Constantine to evade the pair and the others to be found too ill-equipped to be guilty. The instructions on the stolen key lead Constantine and Dominic to schedule the next show in order to rob the Bank of Ireland in Dublin.\nIn Dublin, Walter discovers that Dominic has been giving away show tickets and bribing critics to ensure a packed house and rave reviews, while Fozzie notices Kermit's and Constantine's similarities. Constantine attacks Walter and Fozzie for their discoveries, but Animal stops him and the three escape to rescue Kermit. During the performance, Dominic steals a locket from the bank and Constantine proposes to Piggy onstage; Piggy accepts, and the pair plan a wedding ceremony to be held at the Tower of London in London, where the Crown Jewels are kept.\nFozzie, Walter and Animal reach the Siberian Gulag on the night of the performance, and Kermit uses it as a front to allow them, himself, and all the prisoners to escape the Gulag.\nKermit, Fozzie, Walter and Animal infiltrate Constantine's dressing room and overhear him explain to Dominic that he plans to kill Piggy after they are married. Kermit and Fozzie are briefly detained by Sam, but escape as the wedding begins, and Dominic, with the help of Bobby Benson's Baby Band, manages to steal the jewels. Kermit interrupts the ceremony, revealing Constantine's ruse, and Piggy's ring\u2014actually a bomb\u2014is removed with Bunsen's magnetic bomb attractor vest, worn by Beaker.\nConstantine takes Piggy hostage and flees to a helicopter, where he is intercepted by Dominic, who is actually the Lemur and intends to double-cross him. Constantine, after berating Dominic for bragging about the double-cross before escaping, ejects him from the helicopter and tries to take off with Piggy, but Kermit jumps aboard and the rest of the Muppets climb atop each other to stop the escape. Kermit and Piggy incapacitate Constantine, who is arrested with Dominic by Sam and Napoleon. Nadya then arrives to recapture Kermit for escaping despite him being framed & innocent from the start, but Walter, Fozzie, Gonzo, Rowlf, Scooter, and Piggy tell her that if she arrests him, then she will have to take them as well. She relents, allowing Kermit to go free.\nThe Muppets place their next venue at the Gulag in their finale.", "tmdb_plot": "While on a grand world tour, The Muppets find themselves wrapped into an European jewel-heist caper headed by a Kermit the Frog look-alike and his dastardly sidekick.", "tmdb_id": "145220", "wiki_id": "38267543"}, {"title": "Murder in Pacot", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "An upper middle class affluent couple in Port-au-Prince, Ha\u00efti, tries to rebuild their lives after the earthquake of 2010.

He needs to be accompanied all the time. Companies hesitate to hire him, although he has excelled in academics, and he cannot impregnate women since he falls asleep during sex.

After clearing the misunderstanding, they start dating and fall for each other. Meera makes one of Indhiran's dreams come true (i.e. getting a kiss from a beautiful woman by kissing him), but her father opposes their marriage as Indhiran cannot give birth to a child. Meera urges Indhiran to find a way how he could stay awake. It dawns on Indhiran that he had never fallen asleep while taking a shower. Believing that her father will accept Indhiran only when his potency is proved, Meera and Indhiran have sex underwater in their pool, resulting in Meera becoming pregnant. \nOn a late-night drive, Meera and Indhiran find themselves in an under-construction bridge. Their car is hit by another, and the shock makes Indhiran doze and Meera is attacked and assaulted by unknown thugs.

To prevent this, he buys a portable audio player and uses it with full volume.

After obtaining control, Indhiran gets information from a sympathetic police officer regarding attack cases to find a lead. He remembers that one of the thugs's name Sekhar and his ringtone, while the police finds out that the offenders rode a red car. Indhiran stumbles upon a red car in a petrol bunk and inquires the driver, who claims that the car was with a mechanic named Sekhar on the day the crime took place. \nAt the workshop, Indhiran spots the mechanic who tries to abscond, recognizing Indhiran, and a chase ensues, leading them to a building under construction.

It turns out that Karuna, to realize his ambitions of running a business in the US, had been using his wife to manipulate Aravind. Citing Indhiran's confrontation, Kavitha bluffed to Aravind that if Karuna learns of the affair, he would kill them both. She suggested that the only way to solve it once and for all is to arrange the amount of \u20b9 20 million that Karuna needs to settle in the states. With him gone, they could enjoy being together. Aravind agreed to finance Karuna out of his lust for her.\nLater, when Karuna and Kavitha are celebrating their success, Indhiran drops by unexpectedly.

He gets frightened and bolts, then Isabelle walks up to him in an enclosed space and gives him Marie-Edwige's bracelet (which Nicholas lost a few days ago). The two then start chatting and get to know each other well. His interest for Isabelle grows. When the boys find out, they are unhappy and disappointed, until Isabelle shows what she can do and becomes their friend. Later, Mrs Bernique's shower incident forces them to almost leave. The boys then sabotage their car to extend their stay.\nOne day on the beach, Massimo Massini, a very loud and obnoxious movie producer from Italy, is filming a movie on the beach, angering the vacationers. In a fit of anger, Nicholas' mother marches up to Massini and yells at him in public to stop being so inconsiderate to everyone else; this act is well-received by the other vacationers. To apologize, Massini sends his assistant to invite Nicolas's parents to a party he is throwing at a club. There, Nicholas' mother dances with Massini and Nicholas' dad is kicked out of the club by security.\nIsabelle takes her dad's chequebook from the coat, which forces them to stay even longer. Her father thinks it is Nicholas' dad who stole it (due to Nick's aforementioned lie about the family), though he later finds out this is not the case after patting down his pockets in an awkward manner. Nicholas' mother walks down the beach to have become a sort of local celebrity; she is interviewed and Nicholas' dad is pushed away. Nicholas and Isabelle decide to run away to an old fortress, as the former writes a letter explaining this to Marie-Edwige. At night, there is a masked party, which Nicholas and Isabelle use as a distraction to get to the fortress, which is filled with explosives that they shift aside.\nBack at the party, Nicholas' dad finds a letter that his son wrote to him about running away, and Mr Bernique finds a similar one from Isabelle. C\u00f4me unintentionally gives away the location of the two, and a search party is sent out to the fortress. Massini takes Nicholas' mother to his car, while Nicholas' dad misses the search party leaving and goes by bike. Then when it crashes, he finds a tractor, with which he crushes Massini's parked car until it gets stuck.\nNicholas and Isabelle decide to go back to the hotel. As they leave, a shelf holding an explosive collapses, triggering an explosion that demolishes the entire fortress. In the forest, a hunter spots Massini in a gorilla suit, mistaking him for a Bigfoot-like creature, and shoots at him, to no avail. The search party finds where the original fortress was, albeit with nothing left. They head back to the hotel to find Nicholas and Isabelle asleep in front of a TV.\nThe next day, three days before summer vacation ends, everyone leaves the hotel, and Nicholas promises Isabelle he will write to her every day. As he is thinking of her, Marie-Edwige comes up to him, saying she gave him the wrong address to write to. Later, in a mid-credits scene, Marie-Edwige makes Nicholas write a letter to Isabelle saying he should stop writing to her.", "tmdb_plot": "It's the end of the school year.

He and the other exhibits are hosting an event to help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. As Larry makes sure everything is ready, the other exhibits inform him that the museum commissioned a new Neanderthal model resembling Larry. The new Neanderthal calls himself Laaa and considers Larry his father. Later, Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet has a mysterious corrosion. As the corrosion spreads, the exhibits act abnormally and cause massive chaos at the planetarium. After calming the situation, Larry, frustrated, returns home to find his teenage son Nick throwing a party.\nTo discover what is happening to the tablet, Larry reunites with now-retired Cecil, a member of the expedition who discovered the tomb. Cecil remembers \"the end will come\" prophecy and realizes it refers to the tablet's magic ending and the exhibits becoming lifeless. Cecil says Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power, but that they are in the British Museum. Larry convinces museum curator Dr. McPhee, who was fired due to the planetarium incident, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, although McPhee believes the magic is just clever special effects. Larry and Nick travel the U.K. and go to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly. Larry discovers that some of the American exhibits have stowed away with Ahkmenrah: Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, miniatures Jedediah and Octavius, Dexter the capuchin monkey, and Laaa. As Larry and the others search the museum, the tablet brings the British exhibits to life.\nThe group is joined by a wax figure of Sir Lancelot, who helps fight off aggressive museum exhibits like a Triceratops skeleton and a Xiangliu statue. The tablet's corrosion worsens, and the American exhibits begin experiencing side-effects such as stiffening limbs and memory reversion. The group finds Ahkmenrah's parents. They learn the tablet's power can be regenerated by moonlight, since it is empowered through the magic of Khonsu. Lancelot steals the tablet, mistaking it for the Holy Grail, and prepares to leave for Camelot. Tilly locks Larry and Laaa in the employee break room, but Attila helps them escape. Laaa remains behind to distract Tilly; they become attracted to each other.\nLancelot crashes the musical Camelot starring Hugh Jackman and Alice Eve and is stunned to realize that unlike the other exhibits, Lancelot and Camelot are not real. Larry and the others chase Lancelot to the theatre's roof, where the corrosion almost consumes the entire tablet, turning the exhibits back into their lifeless forms. The group tells Lancelot that although Camelot never existed, he can have a life. Lancelot gives the tablet back, allowing Larry to straighten the pieces as the moonlight restores the tablet's power and the exhibits. As the American exhibits prepare to return home, they decide that Ahkmenrah and his tablet should stay at the London Museum with his parents, even though this means the New York exhibits will no longer come to life. Larry is upset, but they all inform him that they are at peace with their unanimous decision. Ahkmenrah thanks Larry for reuniting him with his family, and the exhibits go home. Back in New York, Larry spends some final moments with his friends and says goodbye to them before the sun rises, and then he leaves the museum for the last time.\nThree years later, Larry now works as a school teacher after the museum rehired McPhee. Tilly, the new night guard, brings a traveling exhibit to New York in a collaboration with the Museum of Natural History.

While driving home, Lou sees a car crash and pulls over. Stringers\u2014freelance photojournalists\u2014arrive and record two police officers pulling a woman from the burning wreck. One of the stringers, Joe Loder, tells Lou that they sell their footage to local news stations.\nInspired, Lou steals a bicycle and pawns it for a camcorder and a police radio scanner. After two unsuccessful attempts at recording incidents, Lou records the aftermath of a fatal carjacking and sells the footage to KWLA 6. The morning news director, Nina Romina, tells him the station is especially interested in footage of \"graphic\" accidents and violent crime in affluent, White areas. Lou hires an assistant, Rick, a young homeless man desperate for money. To give his footage more impact, Lou tampers with crime scenes, in one case moving a body to get a better camera angle. As Lou's work gains traction, he buys better equipment and a faster car.\nLou pressures Nina into a date, telling her he knows she is desperate for higher ratings. On their date, he threatens to terminate his business with Nina unless she has sex with him, and it is implied that she acquiesces. Lou turns down an offer to work for Joe, but when Joe beats him to an important plane crash story, Nina demands that Lou get better footage and keep his end of their bargain. In retaliation, Lou sabotages Joe's van; when it crashes, Joe is severely injured and Lou records the aftermath.\nLater, Lou and Rick arrive before the police at the site of a triple-homicide home invasion in Granada Hills. Lou records footage of the gunmen leaving in their SUV and of the victims in the house and later presents footage to the station with the perpetrators edited out. The news staff frets over the ethics of the footage but Nina is eager to break the story. In exchange, Lou demands public credit and more money. Police detective Frontieri shows up at Lou's apartment to question him about his connection to the home invasion. He gives her edited footage of the incident, cutting out the parts with the gunmen.\nThat night, Lou and Rick track down the driver to his house, staking out the house until he leaves to pick up his partner. Lou wants to follow them to a more crowded public area, then call the police and record the ensuing confrontation. Alarmed, Rick demands half the money Lou stands to make, threatening to tell the police about Lou's withholding of evidence; Lou agrees.\nWhen the gunmen stop at a restaurant, Lou phones the police, warning them that the suspects are armed. They arrive and exchange gunfire. A police officer is shot and one of the killers is gunned down while the other manages to escape in the SUV.

He explains that she was unwilling to allow him, an equal contributor to their household expenses, to have the house to himself for the purpose of entertaining an old military buddy. He goes on to explain that he feels no guilt for the crime but does regret the amount of blood. Peter appears to be a type of vlogger, as he admonishes himself that he can not upload this video and shuts the camera off.\nThe next day, Peter sits at the kitchen table singing happily and enjoying a bowl of what appears to be Froot Loops. And as he heads off to work, he seems to forget for a moment that the previous night he murdered his mother, because he calls to her closed bedroom door to let her know he's leaving. His face registers the new reality.\nPeter returns from work venting about his day, but reassures himself that no one will ruin his good mood because he is about to prepare a great meal because he deserves it. For the second time in the film, the viewing audience notice that Peter sings songs to himself that are more suited to the 1960s or '70s and are no longer current hits. And later his wardrobe will validate that he is stuck in another time period. Peter sits down to enjoy his meal but appears to be lonely as he sits at the dinner table. The next scene is Peter sitting in front of the television, attempting to watch something but realizing he needs his glasses. As he checks his pockets and the cushions on the couch, his facial expression lets us know he remembers where they are and that he dreads going to retrieve them. He quickly goes into his mother's room and comes out with glasses covered in his mother's blood.\nThe next scene introduces us to Edward. Peter practices calling Edward several times, inviting him over for the dinner he was asking his mother to allow him, which led to her murder. After getting the courage to dial the number, he reaches Edward's wife, Gloria. He makes small talk asking about the children and then asks to speak with Edward. After being told he was unavailable, he leaves a message and begins recording for his online audience, letting them know he has no expectation that she will give Edward the message. He decides that Edward will come to dinner on Friday, even though they have not spoken. He even begins contemplating a menu.\nThe next day, the doorbell wakes Peter and a package is left at the door. It is a makeup mirror his mother obviously ordered before she died. The mirror seems to represent her throughout the remainder of the movie. It resides on the kitchen table where his mother may have sat during their morning meals; he speaks to it often as if it were she. He receives a call from his sister, Vickie, and thus begin conversations with the outside world where he lies and deceives others about the whereabouts of his mother. He tells Vickie that their mother is out and complains about the purchase of the mirror.\nPeter, drinking and smoking, relishing in the good fortune of having the house to himself for the very first time, begins a barrage of phone calls to Edward's answering machine. He shares how much he misses him and goes from pleading for a return call to cursing Gloria for standing in the way of his friendship with Edward.\nThe next morning, the scent of rotting flesh coming from underneath his mother's door begins to become unbearable and Peter stuffs a towel in the crack. He goes off to work and returns with an iPhone and a bluetooth headset. That evening, he retrieves the mail and notices a letter to his mother. After preparing a cup of tea and telling the mirror/mother to hold on, he opens the letter and reads it. It's from an old friend, Charlene Carruthers, from Mobile, AL telling Lillian, his mother, about the goings on in Mobile and expresses concerns she and her husband have about the last letter from Lillian. They pray Peter will meet a Christian woman to marry, and that Lillian should not love Peter more than God and thus allow him to do anything against God's will. The letter is so upsetting to Peter that he types a response from his mother to Charlene. The letter states what a good son he is, that he takes excellent care of her and that he had his friend Edward over for a wonderful dinner for the three of them.\nPeter decides to use his new iPhone to make another attempt to reach Edward and is finally successful. His joy is palpable when he turns his face to the wall and tells Edward how badly he's missed him. He explains that he's called for days and that Gloria has been preventing his calls from being received. He shares the news that his mother has \"moved away\" and that he wants him to come to dinner to celebrate. Miraculously, Edward is available the very day he told his online viewers, Friday.\nNow Peter has to prepare the house for his dinner guest and, first things first, mother must be removed from the house. He wraps her in his grandmother's quilt, caresses her hand for the last time, and drags her from the room. As he leaves, we see a lock on the door as if Lillian had been afraid of Peter and locked her door to keep him out. He puts her in the trunk of the car, along with a shovel, and drives away, presumably to bury her. The next day he calls Vickie on his new phone and, after explaining to her that their mother knows about the phone and that they are not paupers who cannot afford it, he shares the good news that he and mother are redecorating the house. We learn that their father left them 30 years ago and that Peter is not concerned about the costs of the work, as it will just be billed to his MasterCard. Peter vents to mother via the mirror about his frustration with all the work he will have to do on the house and that this could have been done 10 years ago with the money from the settlement. A call from Mrs. Carruthers from Mobile interrupts his lunch; again he lies about his mother's whereabouts.\nPeter tells his online viewers about his exciting dinner plans, possible menu items, and thanks them for their comments. Then he introduces them in a later video to the tropical fish he bought for Edward to make his home a sanctuary for him. Adam and Eve are the fishes' names; Adam the fish has just left his wife. Peter goes through the house the next day looking for the espresso machine. He explains to his viewers that he and Edward love an after dinner espresso and explodes over his mother having hidden it from him out of spite. He unsuccessfully tries to purchase a new one over the phone, but he has charged his MasterCard to the limit and cannot get approved for an increase. He finally locates the machine in the attic.\nSitting outside on the patio, Peter finally shares with his viewers the story of meeting Edward. We find out that he was in the military with Edward. He explains that the military was too difficult for him, which seems to mean he was discharged. That, coupled with the murder and his medications, implies mental health issues that may have contributed to his leaving the military. Peter alludes to a misunderstanding he and Edward had that they need to resolve.\nThe next day, Peter is painting the dining room and explaining to Vickie why their mother does not want to talk to her anymore. He attempts to convince her to send him money for an airline ticket so they can send their mother to Mobile to visit Mrs. Carruthers. Later that day, Mrs Beasley from church calls to check on Lillian because she missed bridge at church. Peter explains she has been ill and rushes off the phone when the eggs he's cooking begin burning on the stove. Peter ends his night with prayer.\nThe next day, the BIG DAY, we see Peter with a new look. His hair is texturized, similar to styles in the 1960s and '70s, reinforcing that he is out of date with his look. He begins singing around the house as he cooks, cleans, and works out. He has another discussion with Vickie reaffirming that their mother wants nothing to do with her. He makes some final touches around the house and then begins getting ready. We see from his wardrobe that he hasn't been shopping in decades; he finally decides on what looks like a suit he wore to prom. He walks down the hall looking cleanly dressed and quite dapper in a burgundy suit with white shirt and matching tie. He waits for his guest.\nAfter waiting 45 minutes and updating his online viewers that he may have given Edward the wrong directions, he calls Edward to check on him. Gloria answers the phone, so he pretends to be a Mr. Jones calling for business reasons. When she refuses to allow him to speak with Edward, he begins to unravel, threatening her that he will not allow her to ruin what he has sacrificed so much for. And we see what may have happened when he murdered his mother. He takes a baseball bat and trashes the dining room, bashing a blue female statue to pieces. Broken and emotionally drained, he explains to Eve the fish that he now knows what must be done. He and Edward will be together, either in this world or the next.\nPeter is awakened the next morning by Vickie's call; she tells him that a murder has been reported on the news. He turns the TV on and hears that an African American female's body has been found and it is being considered a homicide. He tells her he must call her back and washes his face. His day is filled with multiple calls from Mrs. Carruthers, Mrs. Beasley, and Pastor Barrons asking about Lillian's whereabouts. He provides each with a different story or lie, reassuring them that she is fine and visiting friends in Mobile AL. He later calls Gloria to apologize for his erratic behavior and violent threats the night before and announces he will be moving. He gets a suitcase and begins packing for a trip. He shares with his viewers that he and Edward are going on a trip west. They will live alone in a house in the country, going to town for groceries in cowboy hats and boots. He is interrupted by a call from Edward.\nHe excitedly shares his plans for the two of them to run off together and finally be a couple. Edward tells him something that devastates Peter. He attempts to call Edward back but it goes straight to voicemail. Greatly disappointed, Peter retrieves his packed suitcase from the trunk of his car and puts his clothes and toiletries away then cleans up the mess from his tantrum the night before. He sits to type a letter of apology and suicide to Edward. Peter retrieves a shoe box filled with letters written to Edward by Peter, returned unopened. He gets all the medications from the bathroom and swallows them, then goes out to the car, where he has taped a hose to the tailpipe, and waits for the car to fill with fumes. Unable to keep the pills down, he throws up, then turns the engine off.\nThe next morning, Robert Beasley from church comes by the house, or does he? Peter looks out the peephole of the door, but there's no one there. There appears to be the shadow of a shoulder and it looks as if someone tries to break into the back door of the house but when Peter looks out the window to the front of the house there is still no one there and no vehicle in the driveway. Leaving the viewer to question if there was anyone at the door at all. Peter then sits at the table to eat his breakfast, but after seeing himself in the mirror, the mirror that also appears to be Lillian, he closes it and returns it to her bedroom. He returns to his viewers, now bald, and tells them about his brother Bobby's death. The camera pans to a memorial plaque dating Bobby's life from '62 to '81. Since Peter was only 6 in '81 it dawns on the viewer that the clothes Peter wears throughout the film must be those of his brother Bobby. He's been wearing Bobby's clothes throughout the film. Peter met Edward 18 years ago and knew that he and his mother would be great friends; now he reconciles himself to the fact that he has lost them both.\nPeter receives one last call from Vickie where he seems to confess that their mother is dead. He tells Vickie that their mother loved her and gives her permission to contact the police now. He dresses, then gets a shotgun from the cabinet outside. He makes his final recording to his viewers and announces that the police are inside the house and coming down the hall. He thanks his viewers for their comments and offers words of wisdom and advice to hug your children. He seems to resign himself to being killed by the police for appearing to be armed and dangerous, despite the gun's being unloaded. Then quotes a verse from Revelations: \"He who testifies to the things says yes I am coming soon. Amen.\" To prevent his viewers from watching his death, he then shuts the camera off and waits for the police to enter the bedroom.", "tmdb_plot": "A dangerously unstable man addresses the unseen followers of his video log about his obsession with an old army buddy.", "tmdb_id": "277662", "wiki_id": "46621976"}, {"title": "Nimirndhu Nil", "genres": ["Action", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Aravindan Sivasaamy is a 26-year-old youth who was brought up in an ashram run by Harichandra.

As an adult, Noah lives with his wife, Naameh, and their sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. He witnesses a flower grow instantly from the ground and dreams of a great flood, so he takes his family to consult his grandfather, Methuselah. On the way, they come across a group of recently killed people and adopt the lone survivor, a girl named Ila. She is treated for an abdominal wound, but Naameh determines she will be unable to bear children. The group is chased by the murderers and escapes into the land of the Watchers, fallen angels that were left stranded on Earth as stone creatures after they descended from Heaven to help Adam and Eve when the pair was banished from the Garden of Eden.\nMethuselah helps Noah understand his visions and gives him a seed from Eden, which he plants nearby. The Watchers arrive the next morning, and, while they debate whether to help Noah build his ark, water spouts from where Noah planted the seed and a mature forest pops up around them. The Watchers are convinced Noah is serving the Creator.\nYears later, Tubal-cain notices a huge flock of birds flying to the almost-completed ark and leads his followers to confront Noah, who defies Tubal-cain and remarks that there is no escape for the line of Cain. When the Watchers form a defensive circle, Tubal-cain retreats and begins to build weapons to take the ark. More species of animals come to the ark and are sedated with incense.\nWith Ila in love with Shem, Noah goes to a nearby settlement to find wives for Ham and Japheth, but, after witnessing the settlers' cruel and shameless behavior, he abandons his effort, as he now believes the Creator does not want humans to be part of the world once he and his family get the animals reestablished after the flood. Devastated by the idea of being alone his entire life, Ham runs into the forest. Naameh begs Noah to reconsider and, when he will not, goes to Methuselah for help. The old man cures Ila's infertility, while Ham befriends a refugee named Na'el.\nWhen the rain begins, Tubal-cain incites his followers to storm the ark. Noah finds Ham in the forest, but leaves Na'el, who is stuck in a foothold trap, to be trampled to death. His family enters the ark, except for Methuselah, who remains in the forest and is swept away by the rushing waters. The Watchers hold off Tubal-cain's army, sacrificing themselves and ascending back to heaven. Tubal-cain slips onto the ark and solicits help from Ham, playing on the boy's anger toward Noah.\nIla discovers she is pregnant and tells Noah. He pleads with God not to make him kill the child. The rains stop, indicating that God wants the child to die, so Noah tells his family that, if the baby is a girl, he will kill her to ensure the future will be uncorrupted by humans.\nNine months later, Ila goes into labor as she and Shem are about to leave the ark on a raft. Naameh begs Noah to spare the child so they will stay, but, instead, he burns the raft. Ham interrupts to tell Noah the beasts are awake and eating each other, which is a ruse so Tubal-cain can attack Noah. While they fight, Ila gives birth to female twins and the ark hits a mountaintop. Shem attacks his father and Tubal-cain is about to strike Noah with a rock, but Ham kills Tubal-cain with a dagger. With his dying breath, Tubal-cain tells Ham, \"Now... You are a man\". Noah finds Ila, intending to kill the babies, but spares them because he finds nothing but love in his heart when he sees his newborn granddaughters.\nUpon exiting the ark, Noah, ashamed, thinking he has failed the Creator and deeming himself a monster, goes into isolation in a cave and makes wine to drown his sorrows. Ham, after witnessing his father's unseemly and naked drunkenness, leaves to travel alone.

In the first-class lavatory, Marks discovers a hole drilled into the wall that offers a clear shot to the pilot's seat, and discovers a dart in Wheeler's body.

When some passengers attack Marks, Bowen stops them, believing that the bomb is the priority. Marks convinces the others of his innocence and has them move the bomb to the rear and surround it with luggage to direct the blast outward, while everybody moves to the front of the airplane. Marks tells Kyle to follow explosive protocol and descend to 8,000 feet, from a cruising altitude of 30,000 feet and speed of 500 mph, as the current pressure differential will destroy the airplane if the bomb explodes, although the escorting jets refuse to let Kyle deviate from his course.

Other friends in attendance include Mickey Marcus (Joe Mantello) and the charismatic Bruce Niles (Taylor Kitsch), who has recently begun dating Craig, who is young and appears to be in good health. While walking on the beach, however, Craig feels dizzy and collapses. Later, when blowing out the candles on his birthday cake, Craig begins to cough repeatedly.\nWhile traveling back to New York City, Ned reads an article in the New York Times titled \"Rare Cancer Diagnosed in 41 Homosexuals\". Back in the city, he visits the offices of Dr. Emma Brookner (Julia Roberts), a physician who has seen many patients afflicted with symptoms of rare diseases that normally would be harmless unless their immune systems had been compromised. All of these cases seem to be appearing in gay men. In the waiting room, Ned meets Sanford (Stephen Spinella), a patient whose face and hands are marked with skin lesions caused by Kaposi's sarcoma, a rare cancer. Brookner examines Ned, but finds that he does not have the symptoms of this disease. She asks Ned to help her raise awareness of this disease within the gay community.\nCraig suddenly suffers violent convulsions and is rushed to the hospital with Ned, Mickey, and Bruce where he is later pronounced dead. Brookner recognizes Bruce, noting that he is the former boyfriend of another one of her patients who recently died. Ned organizes a gathering at his home where many local gay men are invited to hear Brookner share information about the disease. Though she lacks conclusive evidence, she states her belief that the illness is sexually transmissible and that they should all avoid having sex for the time being to prevent new transmissions. Most attendees question her belief. She notes that few medical journals appear interested in publishing anything on this disease which is mostly affecting homosexual men. Ned announces that he wants to start an organization to spread information about the disease and provide services to those who have been infected.\nBrookner and Ned visit a local hospital where several of her sick patients are in critical condition with an illness that is now being referred to as gay-related immune deficiency (GRID). They stay in rooms that many hospital staff are afraid to enter for fear of contracting the disease. Ned, Bruce, Mickey, and several other friends including Tommy Boatwright (Jim Parsons) establish a community organization called Gay Men's Health Crisis (GMHC). The organization sponsors fundraisers for research on the disease now called AIDS and establishes a telephone hotline, counseling, and other services. Over Ned's objections, they elect Bruce their president. Ned arranges for his older brother, lawyer Ben Weeks (Alfred Molina), to provide free legal advice to the GMHC. The two brothers are close, but there remains an underlying tension over Ben's lack of understanding of Ned's sexuality. Ned contacts gay New York Times reporter Felix Turner (Matt Bomer), hoping that he can use his media connections to publish more stories about the unfolding health crisis. Felix laments that it is difficult getting any mainstream newspapers to report much information on AIDS. After Felix recalls that he and Ned had a sexual tryst at a gay bathhouse, the two begin a romantic relationship.\nThe disease continues to spread and claim lives. Bruce attempts to travel to Phoenix with his boyfriend Albert (Finn Wittrock), who is dying, so that Albert can see his mother one more time. The airline refuses at first to fly the plane with sick Albert on board. When they do eventually get to Phoenix, Albert dies following a period of dementia. The hospital doctors refuse to examine him and issue a death certificate, and instead throw him out with the garbage while Bruce bribes a funeral home to cremate his body without a death certificate.\nBrookner attempts to obtain grant money to continue researching AIDS, but her efforts are rejected by government officials who do not see AIDS as a priority. Ned, meanwhile, is kicked out of GMHC for his combative and aggressive tactics to promote awareness of AIDS, which is causing tension within the group.\nFelix comes down with symptoms and his body wastes away as the disease claims his life.

Miller's boss criticizes his idealism as financially unsound, and when Miller writes an unsolicited memo on an unrelated case on the Gambizzi crime family, Alan Emmerich, one of the partners at the law firm, fires him.

Meanwhile, for the past four years, Venky is stuck working as an anchor for Teleshopping advertisements at UB TV. Moreover, his overbearing boss Uday Bhaskar is jealous of Venky as Venky can easily communicate with girls whereas Uday is extremely awkward in his interactions with women. Therefore, he turns a roadblock in Venky's aim to become a news reader.

The dragons themselves are controlled by Vril, Aryan witch women who are psychically connected to the dragons and can command them.\nIn 1942, Dr. Heinrich Gudrun (Ozman Sirgood), a Nazi cryptozoologist in charge of the dragon breeding program, code named \"Skyward\", arrives with his brood. The adult dragons and the vrill are intended to regain air superiority in the North African Campaign to support the Afrika Korps, under the command of Field Marshal Erwin Rommel (Robert Pike Daniel).\nTo combat the dragons, an American general is dispatched with orders to put together a squadron made up of the best Allied fighter pilots that are available, led by Lieutenant John Robbins (Scott Martin), the only survivor of the first fighter squadron to encounter the dragons. General Ward (Thom Rachford) forms the \"Ghost Squadron\", so named because it does not officially exist. In their North American P-51 Mustangs, the squadron leads the dragons into a trap made up of numerous flak guns. The guns shoot down two while one of the pilots manages to shoot down a dragon and mark the location before he runs out of fuel and is himself killed by the dragons. Lt. Robbins departs with his friends to go to the shoot-down site to see what they can learn, but are captured by German soldiers, who take them to see Field Marshal Rommel.\nRommel, who has serious doubts about Dr. Gudrun's intentions and the vrill's ability to keep the dragons under control, meets with Robbins. He reveals that, that once in a very long while, the parthenogenic females will lay an egg that hatches out a male dragon, and that the incredibly rare males are so powerful that the legends say they herald the end of the world.  Rommel explains this actually means the fall of a civilization, saying that one male dragon had laid waste to the Carthaginian Empire, and another had accelerated the fall of the Roman Empire.

When \"Santa Claus\" is unexpectedly checked by the police, he can quickly put his booty (coins and jewelry) in the boy's backpack so that he is not exposed. So the two stay together for the next few hours and the unequal couple moves through wintry Paris. Antoine is even \"allowed\" to help Santa Claus, because after a fall, \"Santa's\" climbing skills are limited and he uses the ignorant child for his own purposes. He owes someone money, which is why he inevitably uses this ruse. Antoine of course likes to be able to help \"Santa Claus\" and says he only has to steal the things so that Santa's sleigh can fly again. After a few break-ins, the couple threatens to be discovered and Antoine comes to the conclusion that this Santa Claus is probably not real after all. Antoine insists on bringing the things back. The burglar has developed a certain relationship with the boy over the course of the night and does not want to disappoint him, and since he actually stole everything because of his debts, he has an idea. He lures the man whom he had referred to Antoine as Knecht Ruprecht into a trap. He dumps the stolen goods under the Christmas tree of one of the families he stole with Antoine's help. This is now arrested by the police and \"Santa Claus\" brings Antoine back home, where his mother is still sleeping and had not noticed the absence of her boy.\nDays later, Antoine goes to a toy store with his mother and meets the \"burglar Santa Claus\" there, but this time without a coat.

She secretly experiments with blue pixie dust, creating variants; however, experiments with the pink variant grow wildly out of control, causing an accident in Pixie Hollow. Her supervisor, Fairy Gary, prohibits her from working with pixie dust. In sorrow, Zarina takes her experiments and runs away.\nOne year later, Pixie Hollow celebrates the Four Seasons Festival with performances from fairies of all the seasons. During the show, Tinker Bell, Silvermist, Iridessa, Rosetta, Fawn, and Vidia spot Zarina flying around the audience and using pink pixie dust to summon poppies that cause everyone to fall asleep. Tink and her friends, who take cover, realize Zarina stole all of the blue pixie dust, which is used to create the yellow dust that fairies use to fly.\nThey follow Zarina to the coast, where she became the captain of a pirate crew, including a young James Hook, who is apparently the cabin boy. The fairies retrieve the blue dust for a moment, but Zarina retrieves it after throwing multi-colored pixie dust at them that switches their talents. Tinker Bell becomes a water fairy, Silvermist a fast-flying fairy, Fawn a light fairy, Iridessa a garden fairy, Rosetta an animal fairy, and Vidia a tinker fairy (much to her horror and disgust). They struggle with their swapped talents as they search for Zarina and the pirate ship, in the process meeting a baby crocodile that takes a liking to Rosetta's new animal talent.\nThey find the ship and sneak in, where they overhear Hook talking about how the pirates met Zarina after drifting off course, and she became the captain with the promise of making the ship fly so that they could plunder anything without getting caught. The ship arrives at Skull Rock, where the fairies discover the pirates' camp and a mysterious Pixie Dust Tree, which Zarina has grown using the pink pixie dust.\nThe fairies attempt to retrieve the blue pixie dust but are caught when Iridessa loses control over her nature talent and reveals their location. Tink tries to convince Zarina to return home to Pixie Hollow, but she refuses because she feels unappreciated. With the fairies now captured, the pirates make regular flying pixie dust. Hook, curious about flying, convinces Zarina to use some on him. After joyfully flying around the cave, Hook double-crosses Zarina and traps her in a lantern, revealing himself as the real captain.\nTinker Bell and the others fail to escape their imprisonment until the baby crocodile arrives and frees them. The fairies almost retrieve the blue pixie dust, but Hook threatens to throw Zarina into the sea unless they hand it over.

Zarina attempts to retrieve the blue pixie dust from Hook, who chases after her. Zarina gains a speck of blue pixie dust which she throws at Hook, who starts flying crazily as the two kinds of pixie dust react to each other. As the fairies fly away, Hook swears revenge on them and is attacked by the baby crocodile. Zarina returns the blue pixie dust to Tink and her friends, before preparing to leave. Tinker Bell offers her a chance to return to Pixie Hollow and she accepts, helping her friends sail the ship back.

When Siddharth's mother Janaki (Kalyani Natarajan), comes to visit him, she is hit by a drunk neighbour (Harish Uthaman), who is abusing his wife (Kani Kusruti).

But, Siddharth mistakes that the ghost had attacked his mother and threatens the ghost that he would kill himself and come as a ghost to take revenge on her. Many rituals of various religions to drive the ghost away were performed by Siddharth, but everything is proven futile and the ghost continues to stay. Also, a petty thief is also stabbed while trying to steal from Siddharth's apartment.\nSiddharth is assured that the ghost of the girl whose life he tried to save is behind all these strange occurrences and goes in search of her family to see if they can help get rid of her.

Jaggu's father objects to their relationship, citing difference in their religions. He consults godman Tapasvi Maharaj who predicts that Sarfaraz will betray Jaggu. Determined to prove them wrong, Jaggu asks Sarfaraz to marry her. At the wedding, she is heartbroken when she receives an unsigned letter, believing it is from Sarfaraz, calling off the wedding due to cultural differences.\nJaggu returns to India and becomes a news reporter. She meets the alien and is intrigued to see him distribute leaflets about the \"missing\" God. She earns his trust by rescuing him when he attempts to take money from a temple's collection box as a refund on God's broken promises. The alien tells her that he is an 'astronaut' from another planet. His people know nothing about dressing, religion, or verbal communication; they transfer ideas by holding hands.\nA flashback shows how, after being accidentally hit by a truck, the alien is befriended by bandmaster Bhairon Singh, who takes him along with his troop. Bhairon takes him to a brothel, where the alien holds a prostitute Phuljhadiya's hand for six hours and thus learns the Bhojpuri language. The alien begins speaking, and after learning of the whole scenario, Bhairon tells him that his thief may be in Delhi. The alien leaves for Delhi. Due to his strange behaviour, people assume he is drunk and call him \"peekay\" or \"PK\" (Hindi for drunk); the alien adopts PK as a name (his people have no language and thus no names). People tell PK that only \"God\" can help him find his remote. He sincerely practices Indian religions, including Hinduism, Sikhism, Christianity and Islam, attempting to find \"God\", to no avail.

Bhairon brings the thief to Delhi, but both die in a terrorist attack.\nTapasvi decides to confront PK on-air. Tapasvi asks PK what the \"right number\" is. PK says that \"God created us all\" is the only concept people should believe in and that the other \"duplicate Gods\" are artificial. Tapasvi argues, saying that PK is trying to take people away from their Gods and that they will not stand for their Gods being taken away.

PK, having absorbed Jaggu's memories earlier, realises that Sarfaraz did not write the letter to Jaggu.\nJaggu contacts the Pakistani Embassy in Belgium where Sarfaraz worked part-time. The embassy receptionist tells her that Sarfaraz has been annoying the embassy officials by repeatedly asking if they received a call from Delhi, implying that he still loves Jaggu.

The only survivor, a boy named Milo, whose parents Corvus personally killed, is captured by slave traders.\nSeventeen years later, in Londinium in 79 A.D., slave owner Graecus watches a class of gladiators battle, unimpressed until he sees the grown Milo, a talented gladiator the crowds call \"the Celt\". Milo is soon brought to Pompeii with his fellow slaves. On the road, they see a horse fall while drawing a carriage carrying Cassia, returning after a year in Rome, and her servant Ariadne. Milo kills the horse to end its suffering, and Cassia is drawn to him. Cassia is the daughter of the city governor Severus and his wife Aurelia. Severus is hoping to have the new Emperor Titus invest in plans to rebuild Pompeii, despite Cassia's warning of Rome becoming more corrupt. Felix, a servant, takes Cassia\u2019s horse Vires for a ride only to be swallowed up when a quake from Mount Vesuvius opens up the ground under him.\nIn Pompeii, Milo develops a rivalry with Atticus, a champion gladiator who, by Roman law, will be given his freedom after he earns one more victory. The gladiators are shown off at a party where Corvus, now a Senator, tells Severus the Emperor will not invest in his plans but he himself will. It is revealed Cassia left Rome to escape Corvus\u2019s advances. When an earthquake causes some horses to become anxious, Milo helps calm one down. He then takes Cassia on a ride and tells her they cannot be together. Returning to the villa, Corvus is ready to kill Milo (not recognizing him from the village massacre), but Cassia pleads for Milo's life. Milo is lashed for his actions, and Atticus admits respect for his rival as they prepare to face each other at the upcoming festival.\nIn the Amphitheatre of Pompeii, to punish Milo, Corvus orders him killed in the first battle, and wicked trainer Bellator convinces Graecus to sacrifice Atticus, as well. The two men, and other gladiators, are chained to rocks as other gladiators come out as Roman soldiers, to recreate Corvus\u2019 victory over the Celts. Working together, Milo and Atticus survive the battle; Atticus realizes the Romans will never honor his freedom. During the battle, Corvus forces Cassia to agree to marry him by threatening to have her family killed for supposed treason against the Emperor. When Milo and Atticus win, Cassia defies Corvus by holding a \u201cthumbs-up\u201d for them to live, and Corvus has her taken to the villa to be locked up. Claiming an earthquake is a sign from Vulcan, Corvus has his officer Proculus fight Milo one-on-one. Their battle is interrupted when Mount Vesuvius erupts, creating massive tremors that cause the arena to collapse, sending Milo and Proculus crashing to the dungeons. Milo opens up the gates to allow his fellow gladiators a chance to attack; Proculus escapes, while the gladiators kill Bellator. Seeing Corvus fallen under a collapsed beam, Severus tries to kill him, but Corvus stabs him instead and escapes.\nThe eruption sends flaming debris raining down upon the city as the populace tries to flee to the harbor. One fireball destroys and sinks a ship, killing the escaping Graecus. Before dying, Aurelia tells Milo that Cassia is at the villa.

Mishra to acquire proofs of Baldev's corruption. Baldev is always accompanied by Venkat, a corrupt cop along with Kundan and Rajeev everywhere. He meets Ganguly and makes a deal with him for a huge ransom to hand over Tiwari, the only witness in the murder case of ACP Gautham and his family, who were killed by Ganguly and his brother Chotu on the former's order. \nMeanwhile, Baldev falls in love with Vaishnavi, a philanthropist who also reciprocates his feelings. To get the proof of Baldev's corruption, Kundan and Rajeev conduct a raid on his house where Vaishnavi is also present, who is livid on Baldev for maligning the goodwill of \"Aasha Foundation\" managed by her. Kundan and Rajeev also find a flash drive with a list of many cops whom they suspect of being involved with Baldev in his corruption scam. However, they are surprised that even they are on the same list.\nBaldev's uncle reveals that Baldev's  mother wanted to see him as a cop, and is admitted in a hospital for an important surgery. Baldev pays \u20b910 lakh as fees for the surgery but at the selection, he is asked to pay a bribe of \u20b910 lakh which is most common for all candidates according to the seniors. Baldev returned dejected, but lied to his mother that he was selected to make her happy. The next morning, Baldev received posting orders and rushed to the hospital to show the same to his mother and uncle, but his mother died as she wished to forego the surgery to make Baldev a cop. Baldev then vowed to turn as a corrupt cop to pay the money on behalf of the honest candidates, who are about to join the police force without their knowledge. After this incident, Baldev and Vaishnavi get engaged.\nMeanwhile, Baldev kills Chotu and arrests Ganguly for killing ACP Gautham, with Tiwari serving as the chief witness. When Baldev is about to present Ganguly and Tiwari in the high court, Venkat sells the evidence documents for a huge bribe along with the information regarding Tiwari and Baldev. Acting upon this information, Ganguly's goons kill Baldev's uncle and then proceed to attack Baldev and Tiwari at the court. However, Vaishnavi and Tiwari are killed in the hit while Baldev escapes. Baldev retaliates and kidnaps Ganguly from Venkat's custody with the help of Kundan and Rajeev. In the process, he meets with a car accident in a hilly area and his car, which explodes, thus killing him. \nPresent: Now realizing the truth, Thirupathi decides to set things right. Jayavardhan provides falsified evidence against the incumbent Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh by claiming him to be the one, who was backing Ganguly Bhai the whole time. After this incident, the Chief Minister is forced to step down and subsequently is arrested. Later, Jayavardhan gives his nomination for the post. Ganguly Bhai, despite being imprisoned, starts operating his crime regime from within.\nTirupathi rejoins the force and heads to Jayavardhan's house and makes a deal with him so as to keep his post provided that he, Tirupathi, turns a blind eye to all the activities of Ganguly Bhai. Tirupathi then becomes close to Jayavardhan's PA, Raja. who becomes agitated after Jayavardhan insulted him. Tirupathi introduces him to Nirupama and gets her to give him a ring to change his fortunes. However, the rings are actually cameras embedded inside the fake gemstone with a microchip to capture audio. With the help of this ring, Tirupathi exposes Jayavardhan's corruption to the media. Jayavardhan gets cornered and runs away \"underground\" along with his brother. In the process, he kidnaps Nirupama, Rajeev, Kundan, and Animutyam's Family. \nMeanwhile, A.K. Mishra, who has been following up this case with close interest unearths the fact that Baldev and Tirupathi are the same person. Right before the car explosion, Baldev is thrown off the car and falls onto a freight carrier, rendering him unconscious. The truck carries him to Hyderabad and is taken to the hospital, where Animutyam is provided with the case. Animutyam's wife had lost her brother named Tirupathi, long back in her childhood and has been searching for him ever since. Realizing that Baldev is suffering from amnesia, Animutyam decides to pass him off as Tirupathi to keep her happy, but mainly to ensure that he wouldn't have to spend huge amounts of money for her search. \nMishra reveals this fact to Jayavardhan and Ganguly and warns them that if Tirupathi discovers the truth, the consequences will be even deadlier. Tirupathi crashes into the stronghold of Ganguly Bhai, where he kills him and arrests Jayavardhan. Kundan, Rajeev and everyone decides not to reveal the truth to Tirupathi/Baldev and thus spare him the anguish over his uncle's and fianc\u00e9's death.

Someone unseen helps him grasp his time-travel device, which he uses to retreat to his employer's facility in 1992. The agent considers his mission a failure because the \"Fizzle Bomber,\" the unidentified serial-bombing fugitive he confronted, remains at large and will carry out his bombing on another day, ultimately killing over ten thousand.\nThe agent recovers from his injuries, but facial reconstruction surgery and vocal cord damage have altered his face and voice. His superiors force his imminent retirement due to the dangers of the extensive time travel undertaken over the course of his career. His doctor diagnoses him with symptoms of psychosis and depression, but does not disclose this.\nThe agent is sent on his final mission. Working undercover in 1970 New York City as a bartender, he converses with a customer who writes true confession articles under the pen name \"The Unmarried Mother\". The reticent customer begins telling his own life story after much prompting.\nBorn female, the customer grew up as Jane in a Cleveland orphanage. Superior in intellect and physical strength but plain in appearance, Jane suffered as an unloved outcast and was never adopted. These qualities, however, led a man named Robertson to recruit her for SpaceCorp, a space flight organization seeking young women as R&R companions for male astronauts. During Jane's aptitude testing, a physical examination revealed an undiscovered, disqualifying medical condition. Keeping this a secret, Robertson rejected Jane under a pretense while promising to re-enlist her.\nIn 1963, Jane fell in love with a man by a chance encounter, briefly finding happiness before the man deserted her one day. Robertson finally revealed to Jane that SpaceCorp was a front to recruit elite operatives with no family ties for a secret government agency, but Jane became disqualified again due to being pregnant by her lover. While performing a Caesarean section, doctors discovered Jane was intersex. As a result of a forced hysterectomy due to birth complications, Jane underwent gender reassignment through an ordeal of extensive surgeries. Amidst all this, her baby was abducted by an unidentified man. Resenting her lover for ruining her life, Jane adopted the name of John and eventually moved to New York City.\nThe agent offers John the chance to take revenge on his lover scot-free, in return for John taking over the agent's job. The agent time travels with John to Cleveland in 1963, admitting that he works for Robertson's secret agency, the Temporal Bureau, which uses time travel to prevent crimes. Following instructions for finding Jane in the past, John unwittingly falls in love with his younger self and realizes that the agent set him up to become Jane's lover. Despite knowing that their love is doomed, John cannot bring himself to break off their relationship.\nDeviating from his mission, the agent illegally time travels to March 1975 to pursue the Fizzle Bomber once more. The Fizzle Bomber beats him in combat, leaving him to witness, and help, his earlier burned self. The agent expects to be punished by execution, but Robertson excuses him, dismissing the Bureau's protocols.\nContinuing his mission, the agent brings Jane's baby, born from her self-fertilization by John, back in time to the Cleveland orphanage in 1945. Thus, Jane, John, and their baby are the same person, a predestination paradox. The agent returns to 1963 and convinces John to leave Jane at the preordained time, inducting John into the Temporal Bureau in 1985 and completing his mission. Robertson extols the importance of John's future role at the Bureau as a unique operative with no ties to the past or future. The agent still regrets his failure to stop the Fizzle Bomber, but Robertson credits the Fizzle Bomber for motivating the Bureau's growth and success.\nThe agent chooses to retire to New York City in 1975 shortly before the March attack; arriving, he decommissions his time-travel device as planned, but the device remains operational. He also finds that Robertson gave him an exact location and time where the Fizzle Bomber will be found. There, he discovers that the Fizzle Bomber is his future self, who claims that his bombings averted greater death tolls in alternate futures. The Bomber also claims that Robertson set up this path for him. Vowing that he will not become the Bomber, the agent guns down his older self.\nJohn's surgical scars are shown on the agent's body, confirming that Jane, John, the agent, and the Fizzle Bomber are all the same person.

The events depicted reportedly precede Star Trek: The Original Series by two decades, with the war's opening battle at Arcanis IV, a prosperous Federation colony along the Klingon border. The Klingons, who did not consider the Federation to be a worthy adversary, maintained the initiative for the first six months of the war, with a number of victories under the leadership of their supreme commander, Kharn. The Vulcan diplomatic delegation under Ambassador Soval (who appeared on Star Trek: Enterprise), overseeing negotiations with the Klingons, are left with little room to maneuver.\nIn response to the losses suffered in the war, Starfleet appoints a new Commander-in-Chief, Admiral Marcus Ramirez, who pledges in a fleet-wide broadcast to defend \"the dream of the Federation\" against the Klingons' commitment to its destruction. Ramirez oversees the creation of the Ares-class cruisers, Starfleet's first warships, to counter the Klingons' mainstay, the D6 battlecruiser. The introduction of the Ares turns the tide against the Klingons, who begin to give Starfleet its due as a worthy opponent, and particularly take notice of Garth of Izar (who appeared in \"Whom Gods Destroy\"), the captain of the prototype USS Ares.\nTo counter the Ares cruisers, the Klingons order the construction of a newer and more advanced battlecruiser, the D7, that would restore the Klingons' technical and military advantage. In response, Starfleet begins developing their own next-generation heavy cruiser, the Constitution-class, but construction falls behind schedule. To gain more time to finish their new heavy cruiser, Starfleet approves a plan proposed by Garth to fight the Klingons at Axanar, the planet where Kharn's spies have reported the Constitution prototypes (revealed to be the Constitution and the Enterprise) are being built.

A group of pilgrims are locked inside a room in the parkarma, mostly elderly, women, and children, who are dying of dehydration and hunger due to the Army refusing the evacuation of Pilgrims from the Golden Temple Complex. The pilgrims are finally able to open the door locking them in. One of the women in the room, a mother of a newborn who hasn't eaten or drunk in two days, proceeds to go under fire to bring water for her child from the sarovar. However, one of the elderly pilgrims, Bachan Singh Maan, stops the mother and volunteers to bring water for her child. When he comes out of the room as the firing stops, just when he dips in the sarovar, Indian Army machine gunners kill him.\nThe story flash forwards to September 1986, where Satwant Kaur is living alone and spends her days sitting outside the area police station. Satwant Kaur now feeds poor children and her son's  best friend Bittu, a Hindu. It's revealed that Satwant's son, Shiva went to work in the field one year ago and never came back. To cope with the loss, Satwant treats Bittu as her son, much to the jealousy and anger of his Hindu parents. Bittu moves on to take Satwant Kaur to a human-rights lawyer who is known to have found many boys who were kidnapped by the Punjab Police and keeps a record of the boys who were killed in fake encounters.\nThe story then flashes back to 1984, a day before Operation Blue Star. Shivjeet, or Shiva, is a college going young adult who is an avid fan of Kuldeep Manak and loves Jeeti his classmate. Jeeti also reciprocates his feelings. Shiva is having a land feud with his corrupt and drug-addicted cousin Jaggi, who is best friends with the village Inspector Deep Singh Rana. Inspector Deep Singh Rana enters, a sadistic, apathetic, police officer who kills innocent Sikhs for rank promotions and under orders from the Central Government. While facing Jaggi and Rana, Shiva guarantees that none of them can plough his land while he's still alive. At home, Shiva has an argument with his father because his father is a law-abiding and court-going man while Shiva believes that none other than the almighty guarantees his rights. Satwant Kaur reveals to Shiva of her knowledge of his secretive dating of Jeeti. In the morning, Bachan Singh leaves for Amritsar.\nWhen Shiva, Bittu, and Satwant wake up in the morning, they find out that all of Punjab is under Military Rule and that there is an indefinite Curfew upon the entire state. There is an entire media blackout, with the only news coming from the Military Radio Channel, which is only referring to Operation Blue Star as a minor incident occurring in Amritsar. The entire state is at a standstill while everyone is listening to the Radio updates on the situation in Amritsar. Meanwhile, Bachan Singh is trapped in the Darbar Sahib complex. Against Army orders, the village gurdwara announces that in reality, the Army has invaded Darbar Sahib with tanks and gunner helicopters and the entire city of Amritsar is being shelled. Bittu and Shiva then proceed to sneak their way to Amritsar on their tractor to try to find out whats happening. They encounter an Army blockade on the road to Amritsar, where countless people are pushing against the barricade to make their way to Amritsar, just as Shiv and Bittu are. In the entire situation, Shiv is rifle-butted by soldiers and countless protesters have been killed.\nAfter the Operation, Bittu, Satwant, and Shiva go to the Emergency Police Station, to try to find out the whereabouts of Bachan Singh. The police officers treat them badly as it's found out that the government declared Bachan Singh a terrorist who took up arms against the state and executed him. The next person in the line of people at the police station, whose brother was also at the Golden Temple, was meanwhile declared a peaceful pilgrim killed in \"cross fire.\" When Bittu asks for Bachan's remains, the police say that the Army already incinerated all evidence of the \"terrorists.\"\nShiva has now left college, doesn't use his radio any more due to the broadcast of Operation Blue Star coming on it, and spends his days working and mourning on the farm to cope with the loss of his father. To help cheer Shiva up, his mother places the radio in the courtyard and talks about selling it. The reverse-psychology works and Shiv starts playing Kuldip Manak songs loudly on the radio while going to the fields. While working in the fields, Rana shows up and changes Shiv's radio's channel to the news, which is informing of a \"terrorist\" attack in Tarn Taran, with the police looking for the culprits. Shiv's mute friend immediately runs to Satwant Kaur's house, where she doesn't understand what he's trying to say until the boy makes the sound of a \"kutti,\" referring to the stopper on a \"Halt\" well system, meaning one thing: Shiv's in trouble.\nThe story flashes back to 1986, where the Human Rights Lawyer asks Satwant to check the record of the youth killed in fake encounters. Fortunately, Shivjeet is not in the album or list of those killed. Satwant and Bittu then go to the local politician Darshan Singh Poonpuri, a peace loving separatist, who vows to help them find Shiv.\nWhen Bittu comes Home, his parents scold him for staying out and helping someone else's parent's instead of his own. His parents also accuse him of helping out a \"terrorists\" mother in a time where Hindus are being targeted. Bittu replies that it is going just as bad for the Sikhs as it is for the Hindus. Jeeti's aunt and uncle attempt to convince her to marry someone else, since it isn't sure if Shiva is alive or not.\nWhen Satwant Kaur goes to the police station as she does daily, a news reporter from a prominent news outlet tries to interview and record her story. However, the stationed police officers find out from their superiors that the Human Rights organisation has found out about Shivjeet and has taken the case to the central government. Rana comes outside and beats the journalist brutally and shamelessly beat the elderly Satwant Kaur to near unconsciousness.\nOne of the police officers working for Rana, also known for haven killing many innocents, secretly comes to Satwant Kaur's home to reveal to her what really happened to Shiva: Shiva was picked up and beaten to unconsciousness while being \"interrogated\" for \"terrorism.\" Later, Rana and the police officer who has come to Satwant tried to kill Shiva and four other youths in a fake encounter, successfully killing two. Shiva refused to run in front of the police and was able to overpower Rana and escape with Taari and Pinda. When the Police Officer tries to leave, Satwant Kaur requests that he eat at her house, returning the favour that he did upon her and so that when her son is ever in a condition like this, someone may feed him too. The policeman leaves in shame after realising what his actions have been and while leaving, tells Satwant Kaur where Pinda might be.\nWhen Bittu and Satwant Kaur go to the police station where Pinda might be, the police inspector tells them that he never heard of said lad. Bittu and Satwant Kaur then proceed to Pinda's house, whose family tell them that they haven't seen Pinda in a year themselves. While leaving, Satwant requests Pinda's family that if Pinda ever comes by, do ask him about Shivjeet. Right before they leave the gate, Pinda's mother stops them and reveals that they were lying; In fact, Pinda was tortured by the police when he was captured after his escape and was crippled. He is currently living in hiding in their house, after his parents bribed the Inspector that Satwant talked to earlier. Pinda immediately recognises Satwant as Shiv's mother, since Shiv always talked about her. Pinda begins to talk about what happened.\nOne year ago, after escaping the police, Shiv, Taari, and Pinda went into hiding on Taari's relatives farm and began telling each other how they all came into police custody.\nTaari was a separatist poet and journalist for a couple of Print Magazines and News Papers. Taari was friends with Rebel Sukhdev Singh Sarhali, due to which Taari was arrested under TADA. However, the real reason Taari was arrested was so that he couldn't write more Revolutionary Poetry. The police subsequently crippled his writing hand. Shivjeet then recalls that he recited Taari's poems in college for multiple school projects.\nPinda was a college going young adult who beat up a man who was eves teasing his girlfriend. The man he beat up turned out to be the son of a Police Inspector, who arrested Pinda. When Pinda was given a chance to apologise and spare himself, the police ordered him to get a rakhri tied on his wrist by his girlfriend, accepting each other as brother and sister. Pinda, once again, beat up the police officer's son. In revenge, the police inspector slapped fake TADA charges against him. When being tortured, Pinda attempted Suicide rather than face the humiliation of being tortured by police.\nAfter discussing their pasts, the three visit Sukhdev Singh Sarhali, a separatist who was Pinda's acquaintance. Sarhali convinces the three to join the separatist's cause. The three due to the miseries and injustices they faced, agree, after which Sarhali Sends the three across the border where they undergo their training for a year.\nUpon their return Sarhali sends them on a mission to eliminate SSP Jagat Ram, a police officer who gained promotions on the basis of fake encounters whose protege was Deep Singh Rana, the police officer who had earlier tried to kill the three. Sarhali's initial plan was to eliminate him on the day of sagraand (native new month) as he visits the Golden Temple. But Shiv convinces him that he should be killed inside his headquarters to terrorise the police department even further. The three reach the headquarters according to the plan, disguised as police constables themselves. Shiva was able to successfully intrude into SSP Jagat Ram's office under the pretext of getting a file pertaining to encounters from the DIG office signed. As Shiv stabs him in the neck, Jagat Ram is able to alert every one in the headquarters using the sound of a gunshot. In the chaos that ensues, Pinda is captured by the police while Shiv is shot three times but is able to escape.\nThe story again flash forwards to Pinda's narrative where he tells Satwant Kaur that Shiva is dead. But it is shown that Shiva is not dead. Shiva and Taari are alive. Taari and Shiva were rescued by Sarhali. Satwant Kaur is not able to believe that Shiva is dead. Satwant Kaur again reaches the police station and Rana beat her badly. Then, Shiva's cousin, Jaggi tries to take Shiva's land. While Jaggi was ploughing the land, Shiva comes in between and kills Jaggi. Shiva's mute friend Titli tells Satwant Kaur about Shiva being alive. Satwant Kaur becomes very happy on listening this and decides to tell Jeeti about this. When Satwant Kaur reaches Jeeti's home she finds her alliance being fixed with a police officer, so she decides not to tell Jeeti about it. However, Jeeti is unhappy as Jeeti loves Shiva. While shopping for her wedding, she meets Shiva in the market. She requests Shiva to take her along with him. Shiva refuses as this might be dangerous for Jeeti's life. Jeeti refuses to marry another man, but Shiva convinces her. Jeeti unwillingly agrees. Jeeti marries another man but she is still unhappy. Shiva and Taari are given a bomb to plant in a bus. Shiva plants it but then sees Satwant Kaur and Bittu travelling in the same bus. Then he removes the bomb. Sarhali is angry at him. Bittu is travelling in a bus carrying Satwant Kaur's spectacles. The bus is stopped by terrorists in the middle and Bittu being a Hindu gets killed. Bittu 's mother curses Satwant Kaur that she would face the same. Then Sarhali, Shiva and Taari are attending a meeting in Jalandar where they meet a politician named Darshan Singh Poonpuri. Darshan says that killing innocent Hindu people is not good. They should stop this. Shiva likes his thoughts. But a man in the council opposes this. While travelling back from the meeting Shiva doubts that man for having a relation in the killing of innocent Hindus and Sikhs. He shares this with Taari and Sarhali. Sarhali orders them to kill him.\nThere Shiva and Taari goes to kill that man. The man before dying reveals that he's not one of the culprits. The man dies. Then Shiva and Taari realises that the culprits involved in killing of innocent Hindus and Sikhs in Tarn Taran are Sarhali and Darshan who were using Shiva and Taari for their own selfish purposes. Darshan and Sarhali wants to form their own government so that's why they were planting bombs to create massacre.\nShiva and Taari are able to run away from them to reach home but Taari is killed in the middle way. Shiva avenged Taari's death by killing Sarhali and Darshan. Shiva calls Inspector Rana and challenges him that he would reach his home and Rana could do nothing. Rana accepts it and says that Shiva would not be able to cross the village bridge. Shiva accepts it. Rana with his officers are waiting on the bridge. There a truck came and Shiva was hiding in it. Shiva kills all the officers. Shiva and Rana lead to a big fight. Shiva kills Rana, but is himself injured. Shiva is able to reach his village street and shouts out loud \"Jo Bole so nihal sat sri akal\". Shiva reaches his home and knocks the door saying \"Bebe Main Ghar aa gaya. Darwaza Khol Bebe.\" Satwant Kaur opens the door. Shiva hugs her and says she is hungry Bebe. Satwant Kaur emotionally asks him to come inside. But just as Shiva is about to step into the house, Jeeti's husband shot him because Jeeti's husband thought Shiva of being a terrorist. Shiva dies in the lap of Satwant Kaur. Upon seeing Shiva dead, Jeeti breaks her marriage with the officer by removing her choorha (traditional red bangles which every Punjabi bride wears in her marriage) symbolising that she had been a widow of Shivjeet as she always had feelings for Shivjeet not her husband. It also meant that she has broken all ties with her husband. Then Bittu's mother come to console Satwant Kaur. Satwant Kaur cries inconsolably by seeing Shiva's lifeless body lying in her lap.

Coupland shows a video of a possessed boy and explains that research will be done to find a cure for this kind of disorder. One of his students, Brian McNeil, is invited to film the experiment process and joins Coupland, his two assistants Krissi Dalton and Harry Abrams, and their subject Jane Harper, a young woman who generates strange phenomena and has been abandoned. Jane is generally kept locked in a room with loud rock music playing during the daytime to prevent her from sleeping in the hopes that the regimen of sleep deprivation will result in increased activity.\nOnce his funding is taken away by an exasperated College Board that is both annoyed about the disturbances he makes and his lack of results, Coupland and his assistants settle in an isolated house in the countryside to keep experimenting on Jane. Her negative energy takes the form of \"Evey\", an infant doll-like creature that only Jane sees. Coupland instructs Jane to transfer her negative energy into a physical doll so they can destroy it. The further the researchers drive Jane to insanity with their methods, the stranger things get around the house. Brian is upset by the way Jane is treated and the lack of ethics in the experiment. Evey's apparitions become increasingly aggressive, and Jane begins to harm herself. There are also indicators that any attempt to harm Evey harms Jane.\nCoupland refuses to stop the inhumane experimentation. He is irrevocably convinced that \"Evey\" is merely a conventionally treatable, psychological disorder in Jane's head, but the others become convinced over time that Evey is a real, malevolent, supernatural force. Brian and Jane become closer and share a kiss. When the group experience another attack by Evey, Brian goes to Oxford, where he discovers that a symbol that was marked into Jane is from a cult who worshiped a Sumerian demon. They performed experiments on a young girl a few years ago; their leader believed that Evey Dwyer, a girl with clairvoyant abilities, was the one to bring their \"idol\" into the physical world. Everybody in the cult died in a house fire that Evey set, including Evey herself. Brian returns and tells them about the cult, certain that Evey is a demonic presence who is possessing Jane. He convinces Harry and Krissi, but Coupland denies his theory and responds that Evey must be a figment from Jane's past rather than a demonic force.\nAfter a heated argument, the group are marked with the same symbol Jane had. An unknown force murders Krissi and Harry. Jane realizes that she was the little girl that supposedly died in the house fire; she was born with clairvoyant powers and had set the house on fire to kill everyone. The authorities changed her name to Jane to give her a normal life, which is why negative energy is manifesting; Evey is not a demon, she is Jane's real identity (one who can't escape the trauma of her past life). Evey then attacks Brian, only for them both to be knocked out by Coupland. When Brian wakes up, he sees Coupland give Jane a lethal injection, as he thinks stopping her heart long enough for the negative energy to dissipate will permanently cure her. However, before Coupland can prove his theory, Brian subdues Coupland and brings Jane back to life. Once revived, Jane locks him out of the room and commits suicide by setting herself on fire.\nThe screen cuts to film footage, apparently from several months later, showing Brian sitting in a chair and holding a camera. An unseen speaker asks him about the deaths, to which Brian replies that everything was captured on film.

Agustin explains that he found a bag full of money and took it to a local church to donate.  Pardo offers to trade the money back to the gang in return if they leave the town.  Though they refuse to leave, they agree to bargain once the money is recovered.  When they realize that Pardo is the Redeemer, they keep him under heavy guard while several men fetch the money.  They fail to find the money, and Pardo kills all the men in the room before they can shoot him.  The gang's boss, an American named Steve Bradock, dismisses his henchmen's fears and orders them to kill Pardo.\nPardo returns to find that Agustin has given the money to Antonia to help her son get an operation.  Pardo initially refuses to allow her to keep it, but he relents after she unknowingly reminds him of slaughtered family.  Agustin and Antonia watch as Pardo engages in his ritualistic Russian roulette, and Antonia tells him that he must accept his dark side and forgive himself rather than looking to God for a sign that he has been forgiven.

After Pardo clears out a warehouse, Piedra and Pardo engage in a duel.  After Pardo wins, he learns from Piedra the location Bradock's headquarters.  There, Pardo realizes the Scorpion has already killed Bradock.  The Scorpion knocks him out.\nWhen Pardo awakes, he sees that Agustin and Antonia are both prisoners.  The Scorpion reveals that he has been killing all the people that Pardo has helped, which he says proves the futility of Pardo's redemption.  The Scorpion demands Agustin to play Russian roulette; when he refuses, the Scorpion wounds Antonia and finally kills Agustin.  The Scorpion demands Antonia play under threat of Pardo's death, but Pardo points out that the Scorpion would never kill him without making him suffer.  Both Antonia and the Scorpion are disarmed, and the two men face off.  Pardo defeats the Scorpion, and Antonia hands him the stylized pistol.  Instead of killing him, Pardo apologizes for killing his son and gives the Scorpion back his pistol, saying that it is all he can do to reunite the Scorpion with his son.

After they arrive at the jungle, Blu, his family, and their friends initially find nothing. However, they are eventually taken to a flock of blue macaws that are hiding in an uncharted section of the Amazon. There, Jewel is reunited with her long-lost father, Eduardo, paternal aunt Mimi, and childhood friend, Roberto. Eduardo seems unimpressed with Blu, but thanks him for bringing Jewel back home. Having lost their previous habitat to arson from the illegal loggers Eduardo is anti-human, and  brushes off Blu's suggestion to expose the sanctuary to Linda and Tulio to ensure their protection.\nWhile searching for the macaws, Linda and Tulio are eventually captured by the loggers.

When Blu tries to pick a Brazilian nut for Jewel, he accidentally tries to get it in the territory of the Spix macaw's enemies, the scarlet macaws, led by the hostile Felipe. Blu inadvertently causes war between the two tribes for food when he accidentally swats Felipe with a branch. The war turns out to be a football (soccer) match, but Blu accidentally costs the flock their territory when he scores on his team's own goal.\nAfter an argument with Jewel, Blu ultimately decides that he will leave Linda and his human roots behind him for the sake of his family, but when he witnesses the loggers\u2019 destruction of the forest, he returns to the flock and rallies them, finally gaining Eduardo's trust. With Blu's knowledge of human technology and help from the scarlet macaws, the flock disable the loggers' machinery. During the fight, Eduardo flies into a tractor and gets knocked onto the ground.

Tommy holds up the cashier with a pistol while Rosie waited in the car she inherited from her father. Tommy is arrested and sent to prison for 18 months. In the meantime, Rosie gets a job at a debt collection agency run by Dave Lovell (Dunne), who went to jail for bilking major companies out of $800,000 through fraudulent invoices. Lovell reformed his life and mainly hires ex-cons at his firm. He is happy to give Tommy a job and a second chance. Tommy is restless and instead of following the call script, he often counsels people on how to defraud Lovell's company.\nWhen Tommy sees some mafiosos in his neighborhood, he grows enraged. He calls them fat old guys living off their reputation, and he resents the way the mafia treated his father. Over the course of the film, it is revealed that Tommy's father started his shop with a mafia loan, and he suffered frequent beatings when he was late with payments. Tommy's mother and brother still run the shop, but his mother blames Tommy's criminal activity for breaking her husband's heart and leading to his death. Whereas, Tommy blames his father's death completely on the humiliation he suffered at the hands of the mafia.\nTommy skips work one day to attend the trial of John Gotti. He watches Sammy the Bull's testimony, and he perks up when Sammy explains that no guns are allowed in mafia social clubs. He cases one of the clubs that Sammy mentioned, and then he pitches the idea to rob the club to Rosie. He explains that it will be safe since no one will have a gun, and that the mafia would never call the cops to report the crime. He gets an Uzi, which he does not know how to use. Rosie reluctantly shows him how to load it, and agrees to the plan.\nDuring the robbery, Tommy shoots the Uzi wildly in the air, eventually convincing the mafiosi to hand over their jewelry and cash rolls. He also humiliates them by messing with their hair and making them simulate having gay sex with each other. He leaves the club by shooting up the walls and saying, \"This is for Frankie Uva\". Rosie and Tommy are thrilled with their score, but the mafia are furious. Sal (Rispoli) consults with his boss, Big Al Fiorello (Garcia), about what to do. Big Al wants the duo found and scared, but not killed, because of the heavy scrutiny on the mob due to Gotti's trial.\nTommy and Rosie eventually run out of money and rob another club. Tommy humiliates the mobsters this time by making them strip to their underwear. FBI Agents have the club under surveillance, and they are stunned at the sound of gunfire. When Tommy flees, the mobsters chase after him out of the club. Agent Frank Hurd (Whaley) photographs several of them standing on the street in their underwear looking bewildered.\nHurd shares the story with New York Post columnist Jerry Cardozo (Romano), even reluctantly agreeing to let Cardozo publish one of the pictures. It becomes a front-page story, and a deep humiliation to the mob. Tommy and Rosie convince Lovell to skip work one day and attend the trial with them. Lovell is as enthralled by Sammy the Bull's testimony as they are. Sammy mentions another social club (The Waikiki). On the way back to the office, Lovell notices an Uzi under a blanket in the back seat.\nWhen Tommy robs the Waikiki club, he is dismayed that there are only three very old men in there playing cards. One of them, Joey D (Young) begs for his wallet back, claiming it is a gift from his dead wife. In the wallet, Tommy and Rosie discover a list of the entire mafia organization, including names, ranks, phone numbers, and addresses. They decide to warn the mafia that they have the list, because they feel it is insurance against retribution. Rosie even calls Big Al at home to warn him that they have the list.\nBig Al is furious at Sal, who explains that Joey D had the list because Sal thought no one would think such an old man had such an important piece of evidence. The list is essentially a phone tree, meant to function as a pass by mobsters who get arrested. The mobster under arrest calls the guy with the list to signal he will not be cooperating with authorities, and the guy with the list notifies everyone on it so that they can know the authorities are bluffing if they say that the arrested mobster has turned into an informant. The FBI has always wanted such a document because it undermines the standard mafia defense that they are not a real organization.\nBig Al summons everyone to a meeting and puts out a contract on Tommy and Rosie, who have become known as \"Bonnie and Clyde\". Meanwhile, Rosie calls Cardozo to complain that he has underreported the number of clubs that they robbed. She sets up an interview with Cardozo, and after initially protesting, Tommy joins her in talking to Cardozo. His profile of the couple only humiliates the mafia further, but it draws far too much attention to Tommy and Rosie. After reading the article, Lovell warns Rosie about the danger she is in.\nOne day when Sal is driving through the neighborhood, he nearly runs into Tommy and Rosie, who he recognizes because of their car. He follows them to their apartment, and he is stunned to find they live 3 blocks from the first club they robbed. He tells his underlings where they live, and orders them to kill them.\nThe FBI infiltrates Tommy and Rosie's apartment and makes a copy of the list, which they use to arrest Big Al. Cardozo is outraged to learn that the FBI will not give Tommy and Rosie any protection for the role that they played in the investigation. Cardozo tries to give airline tickets to Mexico to Tommy and Rosie. He warns them that they are in way over their heads. Tommy and Rosie claim they have a plan.

However, the passage of the Dreyfus Act, forbidding deployment of militarized drones in the United States, prevents this. Aware that most Americans oppose the use of military systems in their communities, Sellars asks Dr. Dennett Norton and his research team to come up with an alternative. The result is a proposal for a cyborg police officer. However, Norton informs Sellars that only someone stable enough to handle being a cyborg can be turned into one, and some candidates are rejected.\nA Detroit police detective, Alex Murphy, is chosen after he is critically injured in a car bomb explosion arranged by crime boss Antoine Vallon as revenge for Murphy's investigation into his activities. Norton persuades Murphy's wife, Clara, to sign off on the procedure. Upon waking up and realizing the extent of his transformation, a frustrated Murphy escapes, but Norton shuts him down and brings him back to the lab. As Norton reveals to Murphy that the only remnants of his human body are most of his head (excluding parts of the brain), respiratory organs, heart, and right hand, a disgusted Murphy asks for euthanasia. Norton reminds Murphy about his wife's and son's patience, convincing him to live. During combat training with trainer Rick Mattox, Murphy proves unable to compete with the standard OmniCorp drones efficiently. Norton alters Murphy's programming to make him more efficient by letting drone programming take over his actions, making Murphy think they are his. This re-programming increases Murphy's efficiency dramatically, but leaves him less empathetic, due to his human nature being bypassed. That night, Murphy goes to his house to meet Clara and his son David to make sure they are okay, comforting David.\nShortly before he is publicly unveiled, the entire police database is uploaded to RoboCop's system, including the Alex Murphy crime scene, leading Murphy to have an emotional breakdown, forcing Norton to suppress his emotions. During the ceremony, RoboCop identifies and apprehends a criminal in the crowd. He goes on to reduce crime in Detroit dramatically, simultaneously increasing public support for repealing the Dreyfus Act. Aware that Clara has begun to ask questions, Sellars orders Norton to keep her away from her husband.\nClara nevertheless manages to confront RoboCop, telling him of their son David's nightmares, social withdrawal, and unresponsive behavior. The experience drives Murphy to override his programming and access the previously sealed files on his attempted murder. From them, he learns his son had PTSD after witnessing the explosion. Murphy pursues Vallon's gang to exact revenge. He takes heavy damage from their armor-piercing weapons but manages to kill Vallon and his men. Murphy returns to the station and joins with his old partner, Jack Lewis. They confront the two corrupt police officers who betrayed him to Vallon, shooting one and tasing the other. Learning that the Chief of Police was also involved, Murphy moves to arrest her but is remotely shut down by Mattox.\nWith the help of pro-OmniCorp talk show host Pat Novak, Sellars uses the incident to get the Dreyfus Act repealed. Clara goes to the press and fiercely demands to see her husband. Fearful of being exposed, Sellars orders Mattox to destroy RoboCop while being repaired and tricks Clara into thinking that Murphy died. Norton reaches him first and reveals the truth. RoboCop narrowly escapes from the building just as it undergoes a lockdown.\nMurphy returns and storms the building, fighting his way through the ED-209 drones sent to stop him, while Lewis and his fellow police arrive to hold off the rest of OmniCorp's forces. Mattox subdues Murphy, preparing to finish him off, but is killed by Lewis. Murphy then makes his way to the roof where Sellars is waiting for a helicopter with Clara and David as hostages. Murphy's programming initially prevents him from arresting Sellars. However, he overcomes his programming long enough to kill Sellars when Sellars overconfidently taunts him.\nOmniCorp's parent company, OCP, shuts down the project.

When Sirisha asks Krishna about the details of his father, the scene shifts to the native place of Krishna where his father, a don fondly called as Anna (Mohan Babu) and as Annagaru with respect, punishing a teacher named Sankar Rao for harassing his pregnant wife for dowry on the complaint of the woman's father Rama Rao. Anna is a sexagenarian man who always thinks about the welfare of the people of Rayalaseema, and they too revere him equal to god. Anna is a very powerful and influential don who also controls the political affairs of that region. His friend Ananda Rao (Paruchuri Gopala Krishna), a ruling party politician, is his close friend, and he and the party extends their full support to Anna to stop the Nandavaram project whose happening would destroy 34 villages completely. On the other hand, a group of influential people working under a mysterious man tries to make the project to earn crores. The group consists of KR, Vedantham Murthy aka Vedam (Tanikella Bharani), Chandi (Jeeva), and Seshagiri.\nKrishna visits his home when Anna kills his opponent Guruva Reddy (Banerjee) and appoints the dead man's henchmen as his henchmen by promising a little high salary. Then the family of Anna is introduced. Anna lives with his wife Lakshmi (Jayasudha), elder son Bhushan (Kishore), and Krishna. Bhushan is married and has a son, but he never loved them and hates them to the core. Unlike Anna and his dutiful and devoted brother Krishna, Bhushan is a spoiled brat, often terrorizing people in the name of Anna, creating fear in their hearts. When a young woman's brother warns Bhushan, Bhushan comes to their home, kidnaps the woman, and conducts a sexual assault on her in his farmhouse. Bhushan, also because of his anger on his father apart from greed for money, joins hands with KR's group for the formation of the Nandavaram project. Meanwhile, Krishna and Sirisha are deeply in love, and Anna's trusted henchmen Ramudu finds out that she is Gavarraju's daughter. Gavarraju was Anna's enemy who was killed by Anna at Tirupathi during an assassination attempt. Though Sirisha is aware of it, she has no objection to join his family, and Anna too respects Krishna's decision to marry her and accepts their alliance.\nMeanwhile, Sirisha informs Krishna in their regular meeting that her friend is kidnapped and kept in Anna's farmhouse by Bhushan, who trashed her brother recently. She also adds that none dared to convey the same to Anna because of Bhushan. Krishna tells the whole matter to Anna, and when he finds the woman assaulted there, he apologizes to her and tells Ramudu to drop her in her home. He also house arrests Bhushan there forever to ensure the safety of the innocent people. But on the request of Lakshmi, he lets him enter his house again. Later, Ramudu invites Anna and Lakshmi for attending his daughter's wedding, and they accept it happily. However, Sirisha's brother reveals to Krishna that Anna is going to be fatally attacked in the way. At the time of execution, firing starts on Anna's vehicles, and in this confusion, Bhushan kills his wife and son, but none knows that. Anna is severely injured and attacked by the rivals, who are killed by Krishna. Anna is sent to the nearby hospital. Inspector Gogin Rao (Ravi Babu) asks Anna's men to get out of the hospital as the patients and their relatives are frightened of seeing them carrying weapons. This results in a brawl between Krishna and Gogin Rao, and the former is arrested for attacking a police officer on duty.\nHowever, it is later revealed that Gogin Rao is not as sincere as he appears and works for KR. Sirisha goes to the police station and tells Krishna that Anna is going to be attacked again by the rivals' men. Krishna goes there and saves Anna from the goons. Later, as both the plans are failed, Bhushan goes to the hospital carrying oranges to the hospital and leaves soon. He keeps explosives inside them so that Anna dies because of a blast as suggested by KR and Vedam. Unfortunately, Lakshmi cuts them, and the blast occurs. Anna, who was in the way to the room conducting medical tests, collapses and understands what happened then. After Lakshmi's funeral is conducted, Krishna meets Anna and tells that KR, Gogin Rao, Chandi, Vedam, Seshagiri, and Bhushan are the culprits and adds that he would kill all of them. First, he kills Gogin Rao by strangling him with a thin wire. Next, he kills Seshagiri by feeding him a poisoned (possibly cyanide-infused) cake. Then, he kills Chandi by locking him in a car filled with gas, leading to suffocation. Vedam is murdered brutally and is hanged from a tree to resemble a suicide. KR is shot offscreen and dies when lit on fire by Krishna. Later, Krishna meets Bhushan, narrates Bhushan's plans and deeds to Bhushan himself, and when Bhushan feels guilty, Krishna calls him a mad dog and shoots him.\nFinally, during Lakshmi's last rites, the main one behind the group is revealed as Ananda Rao. His close associates hold more than 50% stake in the Nandavaram project, and with that money, he planned to shift to the opposition party and win the elections. Since Anna would oppose it, he wanted to murder him and joins hands with KR and his group. On Anna's request, Krishna himself murders Ananda Rao.

Jo was born a commoner, and looks forward to upgrading his social status after serving the royal family for thirty years. Careful to use the traditional rules and patterns, Dol-seok denies the Queen's request when she asks him to replace the king's robe that was accidentally burnt by a gungnyeo (female attendant). He insists that to do so would be against court customs, but also simply impossible in the short time before the robe is needed.

Meanwhile, his father Sam Manning (Billy Crudup) has succeeded in landing a large account at his advertising firm, and calls Josh to celebrate with him and skip that day's classes. Josh tells him he cannot make it but his father insists, though Josh begins to make his way to the campus library anyway. Sam continues to wait at the bar where he told him to meet him and even leaves a message for Josh who has apparently stood him up. He is distracted by a news report of a school shooting incident at his son's campus library on the television in the bar.\nLater, a memorial wake is being held at Josh's home by his mother, Emily (Felicity Huffman). It is inferred that Josh was one of the victims in the shooting. Due to the media coverage received, Sam has a difficult time being able to grieve in his own way with press being cordoned at the end of the street by police, and a news helicopter hovering above the family home. Sam is consoled by family and attendees while sitting alone to one side as his wife is greeting others. Sam walks into Josh's bedroom to look around, attempting to find some kind of understanding over the loss, and is interrupted by Kate Lucas (Selena Gomez), who tells Sam that she and Josh had been dating the year prior. Sam then makes his way to his own home and finds the media coverage is interfering with his daily life, and he eventually succumbs to alcoholism, as far as showing up intoxicated at his firm; acting erratically and kissing his receptionist in a drunken state, for which his employer is advising him to take time off to better cope with the situation.\nTwo years later, Sam has removed himself from his former life and is now living on a sailboat on a lake, far from home, having taken a job as a contractor's assistant and for the most part drinking away his free time. His habits are causing habitual lateness and annoying his employer, who cautions Sam about repeated lateness. Getting up to relieve himself from the side of the boat has caught the chagrin of the governing board of the lake and the \"wrath\" of Alaird Dupree (because it is openly visible to other tenants and the small seafood restaurant nearby), the agent acting on behalf of the board. It is clear he dislikes Sam, and the feeling is very much mutual. Going for a drink with some coworkers after his day of working, he hides the details of his previous life and his true identity from everyone, even making up humorous stories about his past. (He tells his coworkers that he \"fingered\" Gotti and is in the protection of the Federal Witness Protection Program), Sam notices that \"The Trill\" tavern hosts open mic events for musicians.\nReturning to the marina, he encounters his ex wife waiting for him, who says she is moving to Tulsa and is now the mother of a new son. She requires his signature to place their former house up for sale. She has also brought the remainder of Josh's possessions\u2014demo discs, instruments and gear\u2014which Sam emphatically states he has no room for on his tiny sailboat. Emily tells him she was certain he would want it because they had played music together since Josh was younger. Hours pass after Emily leaves. He tries his best to ignore the collection of his son's possessions over a meal. He storms over to where Emily had left it beside the road and begins to place it in a dumpster but stops, noticing the notebooks and discs, and begins to listen to them back on the boat, and read through the collection of lyrics and writings Josh left behind. He even begins to teach himself some of his son's material. After work the next day, Sam decides to perform \"Home\", one of Josh's songs, at The Trill, and catches the attention of Quentin (Anton Yelchin), a young guitarist who was excitedly moved by the performance.  The next day, Quentin brings Sam coffee and food and discusses the previous night performance, stating he believes there are other songs, and if there are, they could perform them together. Sam declares he is not interested, and continues to listen to more and teach himself his son's material.\nQuentin tries again the next day and shows him an alternate arrangement possibility for the song. The two end up sharing a meal and playing instruments together for the rest of the night. Sam neglects to tell Quentin that he was not the piece's actual author. At the end of the night, Quentin gets Sam to agree to perform together at The Trill, adding more and more to each arrangement, including a percussion section in the way of Aiken. The next day, Sam is introduced to Del (Laurence Fishburne), the owner and operator of the local music supply store, who reveals that he is selling his business and plans to retire and tour by motor home with his wife in his later years. Quentin shows Sam the 1978 Gibson Les Paul hanging in the store, but is unable to afford it (a source of good-natured joking between Quentin and Del). Upon leaving the store, Sam watches a staged meeting between Quentin and Willy, a bass guitarist, in hopes that they can include him in their performances, but Sam is resistant to starting a band. The next day, the quartet meet to practice in the garage beneath Quentin\u2019s apartment, and Quentin is very evasive about his own past. The group, now complete, has impressed The Trill owner (played by director William H. Macy) who asks them to perform regularly on Saturday nights as house entertainment, to which the band agrees\u2014even Sam, reluctantly. The new name, \u201cRudderless\u201d, quickly gains notoriety and local fame. Meanwhile, Quentin is revealed as extremely shy of the opposite sex, which Sam attempts to help him through, though Quentin finds the advice generally unhelpful.\nSam arrives at Quentin's apartment one afternoon and meets his mother, Joyce, who Sam mistakes as an older prostitute after seeing Quentin hand her a small amount of cash as they hug. Quentin is embarrassed because his mother has had issues with (unspecified) responsibilities, even spending his junior year of high school living in a car, and has vowed never to lower himself to that level of poverty again. At the mall, Sam buys Quentin new clothing to give him a style, and develop confidence from it. It does help a little, and Quentin begins to enjoy the attention Rudderless has gained him.\nFollowing the show, as the band members are to go to a party, Sam sees Kate\u2014now calling herself by her middle name, Ann, who shames him for playing the songs in public. The next day, Sam visits Josh's grave and finds it vandalized as Josh Manning is revealed to have been the killer in the school shooting incident where he died. Emily arrives with cleaning supplies, and implies that it is a fairly regular occurrence, and the two parents begin to clean off the graffiti from the headstone. Afterward, the two share some tequila, and it is revealed that today is Josh's birthday. Emily tells Sam that a couple of the other parents have reached out to her to forgive them for Josh's actions, but Sam still appears to be in denial.  Emily insists that they had acted properly in their parental roles and they have nothing to feel guilty for and that Josh had to have been mentally ill to carry out such an act of violence.\nContinuing to drink into the Saturday he is scheduled to work, Sam goes to his job and, finding a yard hammock, falls asleep. His employer finds and fires him. Sam assures him that he had already quit and walks away. Later that day, the other members of the band arrive with girls, and spend the afternoon on Sam's boat. As Sam goes below, the other members plead with him about a local block party they have been invited to play, and it is entirely possible it could lead to bigger and better opportunities for Rudderless in the way of airplay and exposure. But Sam is reluctant, now knowing that Josh's songs would never be accepted when people find out the truth of their authorship.\nSam visits Del the next day to acquire a new amplifier tube, and finds Del and wife Tina having gotten the RV stuck. Sam manages to get it out onto the street. Del asks him why he will not play the show, and Sam begins to question why he is really doing all of this. He arrives at Quentin's garage and insists that the song Quentin wrote will be the final song, finally pushing him out of his comfort zone.\nFeeling good about the outcome, Sam makes his way toward the street stage and is surprised to find Kate/Ann talking to the other three members on the stage, presumably telling them the actual origin of the songs they all assumed Sam wrote.\nShe confronts him and tells him that the incident and her association with it had so interfered with her life that she had to change her name and leave school.  She had been pursued and harassed by people and media alike, asking humiliating questions, even suggesting they had been members of a cult. Quentin asks Sam if it was true, and Sam acknowledges the truth for the first time. Quentin outright refuses to play the material and strikes Sam as he is walking away despite the other two trying to persuade him to play the material one time only, and then move on. Sam again goes into a drinking binge and returns home to the marina to find the Board had the area sealed with a chain link fence. Sam attempts to climb it and falls over to the opposite side, breaking the guitar neck of his guitar strapped to his back, ruining it.\nThe next morning, the scheduled sailing regatta Alaird warned him about is loudly underway. The sailboat procession is disrupted by Sam playing the 1812 Overture on his electric, sailing directly into the course of the other boats, and casting some over the sides of their own craft, for which Sam is arrested. He calls Del to bail him out and is surprised when Del tells him he knew who he was the entire time, but did not know the songs were written by Josh. The next day, Sam visits the site of the shooting, and finds the erected memorial identifying the shooting victims by name. Sam breaks down in tears of grief over the guilt of Josh's actions, but finally accepts that he has lost his own son despite what he has done. Sam then visits Emily, bringing her Josh's discs, and says that one day, the new baby will want to know who his half brother was beyond what history will paint him to be.\nSam then visits Del's store and discovers Quentin has discarded his instruments, telling Del to sell them on consignment. Sam then asks if the offer on the store was a \"good offer\", implying that Sam would be interested in buying Del's store. He then goes to visit Quentin at the donut shop where he works, and implores him to continue playing and writing even if it is without Sam. Sam tells him that he found performing Josh's material addictive, offering catharsis to his life and the bond with Josh. He concludes the visit, having brought back Quentin's guitar cases. One contains the Les Paul that Quentin so long idolized and wanted.\nFinally, Sam performs the songs he had been working on, first admitting and telling the audience who Josh was, what he had done, and that he had written the song he was about to play. Closure for Rudderless lets us see Sam has been replaced by a new guitarist. Del has been given Sam's sailboat (presumably in payment), and Emily finally decides to listen to Josh's music.\nSam completes the song, including (presumably) improvised lyrics about missing his son in the song's climax and leaves the stage.", "tmdb_plot": "A grieving father in a downward spiral stumbles across a box of his recently deceased son's demo tapes and lyrics.

As he leaves the scene, Kenshin urges the villagers, including the orphaned boy, not to take their revenge against Shishio's men.\nArriving at Kyoto, Kenshin is asked by Misao, who is impressed by his words, to take shelter at an inn run by Kashiwazaki Nenji, actually a semi-retired ninja called Okina once employed by the Tokugawa shogunate known as the Oniwabanshu who were previously employed by the Tokugawa shogunate; Misao herself is also an aspiring ninja. Okina warns Kenshin that a lieutenant of his, Shinomori Aoshi (the one who beat Sanosuke previously), has made it his life goal to kill the strongest man in Japan - Kenshin.\nMeanwhile, Kaoru decides to follow Kenshin to Kyoto, accompanied by Yahiko and Sanosuke. At the same time, Kenshin discovers to his dismay that the person who made his sakabato, Arai Shakku has died years before.

Himura Kenshin wakes up at Master Hiko's home, and asks if his friend (Kaoru) was also washed up. He has been unconscious for three days, and Master Hiko tells him that his friend is most likely dead. Kenshin asks to learn the final Hiten Mitsurugi technique, \"Amakakeru Ryu no Hirameki\", in order to defeat Shishio Makoto and prevent his onslaught. Hiko agrees, and the two engage in a duel to start his training.\nShishio appears off the Tokyo coast in a large black iron-clad battleship, and demands that the home minister, Ito Hirobumi, visit him to discuss the situation. After inviting the ministers to join him for food, one of them loses his temper, and is killed by one of Shishio's men. The prime minister tries to restore order and decorum, but Shishio takes them prisoner when they try to leave - killing all the government men apart from the prime minister. Shishio demands that Battousai be brought to him, otherwise he will bring down the government by making public all the killings and murders that were undertaken by the current government. Saito Hajime also known as Fujita is still searching for Battousai, and is disgusted with the way the government is handling the matter by giving in to blackmail from Shishio.\nYahiko Myojin finds a poster demanding \"Battousai\" Kenshin be arrested, which he and Sagara realise suggests that Kenshin must still be alive, and they leave for Tokyo and the Kamiya Dojo with Misao to find him and search for Kaoru Kamiya. A young woman approaches them with a scarf as they are leaving, which Misao recognises as the one she bandaged Kaoru with and they rush off. They appear outside a hospital and enter to find Kaoru unconscious and alive.\nKenshin learns through his training from Hiko that he had thrown away his will to live during his time as the assassin Batt\u014dsai, and as he has no intention of coming out alive he will be unable to defeat Shishio. Hiko also points out that Kenshin has lost his killer instinct with his oath to not kill and his ridiculous\" sword, after all it is the strong who survive and the weak who die. That night, Hiko says that something is missing in Kenshin, and that he will be given the night to think about it. If he cannot figure out what it is, he will die the next day. The next morning, Kenshin is still unable to understand what is missing in himself. So Hiko reveals his final task as Master to Kenshin - without realising what is missing, Kenshin will return to his old ways - and so Hiko has to kill Batt\u014dsai. When Hiko attacks him, Kenshin realises that he is trembling. It is not from fear of his master but from fear of death itself and instinctively uses his sword to protect himself as he does not want to die. Kenshin listens as he is told by his master that he cannot learn the secret until he realises that the will to live is paramount, that his life is just as worthy as others and so he has learned the secret of Amakakeru.\nKaoru awakes from her coma, and reunited with Yahiko and Sanosuke they return to Tokyo.  As Kenshin concludes his training and is about to depart, Makimachi Misao arrives with the news that Kaoru is alive. She also tells Kenshin that he has been branded a wanted criminal throughout Japan for his work as Batt\u014dsai during the Bakumatsu era. Knowing that Shishio intends to take Tokyo next, Kenshin intends to return home by a secret route given to him by the Oniwabanshu at the Aoiya Inn. They discover that  Kashiwazaki Nenji (also known as Okina) has gone on ahead and encountered Shinomori Aoshi, who was lying in wait for Kenshin on that route. Kenshin and Misao arrive and Kenshin duels with Aoshi, during which Okina dies of his wounds. Back at the Aoiya, Misao tends to Aoshi and convinces him to return to the Oniwabanshu. On Shishio's battleship, Shishio, his partner Yumi, and one of his men Hori, discover that because of Shishio's inability to sweat, he can only fight for fifteen minutes without putting his health at risk.\nKenshin arrives back at the Kamiya Kashin dojo.  Takani Megumi, who has been looking after the dojo in Kaoru's absence, welcomes him back, but shortly after his arrival police arrive to apprehend him. Wishing to prevent further violence, he surrenders, and is taken to the Home Ministry head, Ito Hirobumi. Ito explains that he had tried to talk Shishio into abandoning his plan to overthrow the Meiji government, but the negotiations had ended in disaster and Shishio, still bitter about his cruel treatment by the new government (being burned alive), would only leave the government be for the time being if Kenshin were arrested and executed. Otherwise, he intends to attack Tokyo. Kenshin convinces Ito that he can defeat Shishio if Ito helps him. Ito seemingly decides to go through with the execution anyway. Kaoru, Sano and Yahiko return to Tokyo soon after and, to their horror, discover that Kenshin is to be executed the same day. Shishio's men attend the execution to ensure that Ito carries through with the negotiations.\nThe execution, however, is merely staged, and Kenshin is freed and assisted in defeating the men by Hajime Saito. Sano joins them, and the three are rowed to Shishio's battleship. While searching for Shishio, Kenshin meets Seta Soujiro again and the two rematch. Kenshin comes out victorious, and Soujiro, who originally believed Kenshin to be weak, is crushed and confused. Kenshin finally finds Shishio, Yumi and Hori waiting in the ship's hold. A duel ensues between Kenshin and Shishio, who easily overpowers Kenshin. Saito arrives immediately after, followed by Sano and Aoshi, who followed them from Kyoto, but even the four together are no match for Shishio. Shishio hits his limit of 15 minutes and Yumi attempts to shield him from Kenshin while Shishio stabs both of them, killing her. Meanwhile, Ito's men begin firing at the ship, intending to sink it and drown both Shishio and Kenshin inside. Shishio condemns Kenshin for helping such a government. Kenshin agrees that the new Meiji government is faulty, but argues that the age of assassins like himself and Shishio is over and that there should be no more violence. He manages to defeat Shishio using Amakakeru, though not physically harming him. Shishio, who has long hit his limit and whose body has become overheated, catches fire and burns to death before the group's eyes.\nSaito, Aoshi, Sano and Kenshin escape from the ship before it sinks and are brought back to shore, where Kaoru, Yahiko, Misao and the Home Ministry are waiting.

A few days later, Salim manages to convince Nisha, and they renew their relationship. Nisha asks Salim to go to a party with her, and he agrees. But when he is on the way, he sees a young girl, a gang-rape victim, who is hurt and bleeding on the road. He takes her to the hospital and misses the party.

One of the men, Guru, is the son of Home Minister Thavapunniyam (R. N. R. Manohar), so the police, led by a police officer Chezhian (P. V. Chandramouli), are pressurized to take immediate action.\nThe police find out Salim's identity and raid his home, where they find his wedding cards and learn about Nisha. They take her into custody and to the hotel, where she meets Chezhian and explains Salim's character and that he is not a terrorist to take hostages. The police plan to use Nisha as bait and capture Salim, but they fail to do so when Salim demands the presence of Thavapunniyam at the hotel. Meanwhile, a police sniper takes a shot at Salim but misses, and Salim throws one of the men out of a window. He tells Chezhian to take him seriously to avoid more disastrous results. It is later revealed that the four men had raped the girl whom Salim had admitted in the hospital. After discharging the victim from the hospital, they killed both the victim and her mother and disposed of the remains in sewage.\nSalim realizes he will not be left alive by Thavapunniyam once he lets go of the hostages. So he demands a car for him to leave and tells the police not to follow him. This time, Thavapunniyam arranges a car that is fixed with a bomb and a remote detonator. Salim continues to hold Guru hostage and gets into the latter's car instead. Later, Thavapunniyam receives a call from Guru telling him that Salim left him on the East Coast Road and escaped.

Cameron goes on to express his views on the contemporary celebration of Christmas, which include his beliefs that atheists have tried to \"take the holiday away\" and that Santa Claus is a Christian. Cameron also criticizes fundamentalist Christians who have politicized the holiday by tying the celebration to Pagan traditions and making accusations that the holiday has become too tied to materialism.\nThe film switches to its main narrative, in which Cameron attends a Christmas party at his sister's house. There, he notices that his brother-in-law, Christian, is not celebrating like the other guests. When asked why Christian tells Cameron that he feels the holiday became too commercialized and consumerist, and that he feels uncomfortable with what he believes are Pagan elements of contemporary Christmas celebration. Cameron tells Christian that he is wrong and recites the story of the Nativity, which is depicted in cartoon form. Meanwhile, two guests at the party discuss conspiracy theories.\nChristian complains that several elements of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Cameron tells him that Christmas trees were God's idea since God created trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross; breaking the fourth wall, Cameron encourages the audience to visualize a cross every time they see a Christmas tree. Cameron further addresses several other concerns Christian has about the historicity of the holiday, including its date and the role of the Three Wise Men. Cameron ties the Nativity directly to the crucifixion, saying that baby Jesus' swaddling cloth was a foreshadowing of his burial shroud, and claims that the gifts of frankincense and myrrh were used to treat dead bodies in a form of primitive embalming. Cameron encourages Christian and the audience to place nutcracker dolls around Nativity sets to represent Herod's soldiers during the Massacre of the Innocents.\nChristian is convinced by the arguments, but then complains that Santa has replaced Jesus as the figurehead of the holiday; he further expresses discomfort over the fact that \"Santa\" is an anagram of \"Satan\". Cameron tells Christian the story of Saint Nicholas, including a reenactment of the First Council of Nicaea in which Nicholas had supposedly violently assaulted Arius for heresy. Cameron claims that, after the council, Nicholas went out and began beating other heretics for teaching false doctrine, and that \"Nicholas was 'bad', in a good way\". Cameron explains that St. Nicholas was the basis for Santa Claus, who was a byproduct of Nicholas' story being diluted by secular culture. With this knowledge, Christian joyously declares that \"Santa is the man\".\nReassured of Christmas' Christian roots, Cameron and Christian return to the party. Cameron criticizes people who feel that the holiday is too commercial, saying that because God took on material form, it is appropriate to celebrate using material things through the giving of expensive gifts. Cameron explains that presents represent Jerusalem, and that Christmas is \"doing what God does\", as God has given humanity many gifts. Cameron then issues a plea to the audience to make Christmas an overtly religious holiday again, \"for our children\". Christian, as a gift to his wife, organizes a hip hop dance to symbolize his love of Christmas, set to \"Angels We Have Heard on High\".

Fortunately, Kelay went to the same bus station and bought tickets for the two of them.\nOn the way to Legazpi, Kelay, Athena\u2019s niece, tells the tale of young Athena and Kenji which dates back to 1990s, a \"gangster\" whom everyone was afraid of. He is broken hearted over Athena Abigail Tizon. Wanting to get back together with her, he mistakenly sends his messages of despair to Athena Dizon\u2019s pager. Athena, not knowing who the messages are from, agrees to meet up with the sender. On a pool hall, Athena and her friend Sarah are keen on playing pool. Kenji arrives and demands that they transfer to another pool table. Athena fights back but Kenji wins and claims his spot. An angry Athena then watches Kenji being bullied by, yet refusing to fight back to, a rival group of gangsters. They tease him that \"Bee\" would not show up. Hearing this, Athena realizes that the messages were sent by Kenji. She watches with pity as Kenji gets mugged. He finds out about his messages for Abi and confronts Athena. To her surprise, he kisses her forcefully and tells her that from then on, she will be his girlfriend as she owes Kenji for causing him to get mugged. Athena has to pretend to be his girlfriend in order to get Abi jealous. At first, Athena refuses and Kenji bullies her. Athena eventually gives in when Kenji attempts to commit suicide by jumping from the school's rooftop if she does not accept. The next day at school, Athena is treated like a princess with Kenji providing her bodyguards. Jealous, some girls at the school start bullying her. Kenji confronts them and says that no one hurts his girlfriend. Their pretend relationship eventually becomes real and the two confess their love for each other. Kenji takes Athena Dizon to Legazpi to see the Mayon Volcano and promises that someday they will get married in that place with the volcano as their witness. When they come back to Manila, however, Kenji begins to absent himself from class. Athena then gets an invite from young Lucas to go see Kenji who is in the hospital. Worried, Athena hurries and finds Abi lying in the hospital bed. Abi has stage three gastric cancer and was the reason why she broke up with Kenji. Wanting Abi to be happy and live longer, Athena breaks up with him. Kenji and Abi get married and Abi gives birth to Kenneth.\nBack then 20 years later while searching for Kenji in Legazpi, Kenneth receives a call from present day Lucas and he helps in looking for Kenji. On their way, Kelay receives a call from her family informing her of Athena\u2019s health condition and that she is dying. Kelay and Kenneth part ways with Kenneth promising that Athena and Kenji would meet once he finds him. Kenneth finds the hospital where Kenji is confined and reads his letter to him. In the letter, Kenji tells him that he was on his way to Legazpi to say goodbye to his memories with Athena and apologizes for making Kenneth feel that way. When Kenji wakes up, the two hug and reconcile. When Kenji is well, Kenneth takes him to Athena\u2019s house. Athena tells Kenji about her disease for the first time and tells him that his love kept her alive through those years. She says she is happy for Kenji and dies in his arms. Kelay wakes up to a phone call telling her that a flight has gone missing again and Kenneth was on that flight. When she goes to look for him she makes a scene again, telling the media her 'boyfriend' is missing. Kenneth witnesses Kelay and it's revealed that it was actually Kenji who called her.

His ambition is to become a Bank manager, and he manages to get an interview for the same in a bank. While on a pilgrimage, Murali meets Ambujam, a young doctor who is travelling with her chaperone, who is her grandmother Aishwarya. Ambujam initially thinks ill of Murali due to unsavoury incidents which occur between them during the journey, but after she finds out about Murali's true character as he helps her Aishwarya recover from dehydration, she falls in love with him. She expresses a distaste for marrying policemen, which impresses Murali. Meanwhile, a spate of robberies occurs in Chennai where several bank accounts through ATM machines are stolen.

Unfortunately, SP Nagaraj, who happens to be Ambujam's father and a former colleague of Chellapa, finds out about Murali's plan and makes a deal with him to avoid the matter reaching Chellapa's ears; If Murali performs badly during training, he will not be expelled from the academy. Instead, he will be made as an SI with the assurance that he can resign if he does not like the job after 30 days, after which he can marry Ambujam. Murali accepts, but this strains his relationship with Ambujam. Shiva and Lawrence plan to steal money from ATMs using information from international credit cards. The robbery is a success, but the CCTV cameras in two different ATMs have exposed Shiva as one of the robbers due to his height. The duo are arrested by Murali, who is now a sub-inspector, but they manage to subdue the constables and escape later that night, while Murali is out on a date with Ambujam.

Haley feels Nic is distancing himself from her and Nic explains he does not want his disability to hold her back. During their stay in a hotel, Nic and Jonah discover that a hacker named NOMAD, who nearly got them expelled for breaking into MIT servers, has found their location and is taunting them with strange and ominous e-mails. They track NOMAD to an abandoned house in the middle of Nevada and decide to go after him. After finding nothing in the house, Nic and Jonah hear Haley scream and run outside, only to see her pulled into the sky before disappearing into a white light themselves.\nNic, now with the number 2.3.5.41 tattooed on his arm, wakes up in a strange and sterile underground research facility where he is questioned by Dr. Wallace Damon, the head of the \"transition group\" in charge of helping Nic to cope with his strange situation. Damon tells Nic what they encountered near the house was an EBE: an extraterrestrial biological entity. Nic remains in a state of disbelief. Dr. Damon then shows him footage from Nic's own video camera and pauses where an alien face can be seen peering from behind a tree. Nic is taken to his room where he hears Jonah talking to him through a small vent in the wall, saying \"(his) body feels weird.\" Nic also notices that his legs, previously weak but functional, are now completely numb. When Dr. Damon questions him again, Nic tries to get answers about Haley's condition (who is in a coma at the time), but is unsuccessful. Following an unexplained experiment on a cow in another part of the facility, a security alarm goes off and Nic, along with other personnel, finds large dents with scorch marks running across the walls and no sign of Jonah. Nic asks Damon where Jonah went but Damon tells him that Jonah was never recovered from the house. Increasingly agitated, Nic tries to break Haley out but is intercepted. After being restrained, he is shocked to discover that his legs have been amputated and replaced by prostheses made from alien technology.

At a visitors center, they come across Jonah disguised as one of the facility workers dressed in a white hazmat suit. Jonah reveals that he too had limbs taken from him, as his forearms and hands have been replaced with the same alien technology as Nic's legs. Jonah speculates that they are in Area 51 (because they both have the same tattooed number, which adds up to 51), and that this is all a test. After Nic discovers indications of alien technology also implanted in Haley's spine, the trio drive up to a military checkpoint. Jonah then tries to hack into their computer system, only to be stopped by a hail of gunfire from the facility personnel, which causes damage to his eyeglasses and ruins his ability to see the computer correctly.

Jonah uses his remaining strength and prosthetic alien arms to subdue the group of soldiers. However, Nic and Haley's escape is short-lived; as they approach the only bridge that would take them over the canyon to the outside world, they run into Damon and his military men, who blow out the truck's tires. Haley is evacuated by helicopter beyond the canyon and, knowing that Nic has mastered the use of his legs, Damon tells Nic \"you can't reach her.\" After hearing a loud horn coming from the sky, Nic realizes that Damon is NOMAD (Damon spelled backwards). Damon then explains that it was Nic who came looking for him, that this was his fault, and adding that Nic is \"the perfect integration of human will and alien technology.

In exchange for Lynch's protection during JR's sentence, JR agrees to perform tasks for Lynch once he gets out of prison.\nUpon release six months later, JR meets crime lord Sam (Jacek Koman), with whom Lynch is playing chess, and his nephew Josh (Tom Budge). JR is given an apartment and a briefcase of Lynch's personal effects, including fake passports, clothes, and a pistol.  A young woman named Tasha (Alicia Vikander) then arrives at the apartment to give JR cash and a cellphone. Following instructions given, JR visits Private Wilson (Damon Herriman) and illegally purchases high-powered firearms. JR then hijacks a helicopter used for scenic tours, and forces the pilot at gunpoint to fly to prison to extract Lynch and his gang under heavy gunfire.  They continue their escape in a car, and while stopped at a convenience store where Merv buys food, the other three discover from a radio broadcast that Merv lied about being incarcerated for GBH but actually raping a Perth schoolgirl. Lynch then brutally beats Merv and expels him from the gang.\nThe three head to Sam's estate, where he recruits Lynch and his men to execute a gold heist at Kalgoorlie, where the expected payout is in the millions. Afterwards, a party occurs at the estate, and JR spots Tasha, whom he follows to the poolside. Before long, Josh decides to harass JR and pushes him into the pool. JR, unable to swim, is rescued by Tasha, and the two leave the party to eat at a Chinese restaurant. Here, Tasha reveals her previous relationship with Sam, and how people who run from him are killed.\nThe next morning, Lynch warns JR to stay focused on the task at hand and not be distracted by Tasha. They then visit the quarry they plan to rob. Lynch tells JR that his role in the heist will be to access the room with the gold and ensure that no quarry employees press the panic button. Lynch then goes and recruits a rally racer named Chris (Nash Edgerton) to be the getaway driver. Back at Sam's estate, the gang plan the heist, and a fight breaks out between JR and Josh. The fight is broken up and Lynch tells JR to go calm down. JR heads to the bar where he sees Tasha, and scares away some men who are harassing her. Angry with his impulsiveness in scaring away the men, given that she does not have proper immigration papers, Tasha tells JR that he was being stupid, but when JR asks her to have coffee, she asks him to meet her near his house. Later that night, JR sneaks out to meet Tasha and goes into the water after her where the two have sex.\nThe next day, the group goes ahead with the heist. The group infiltrates the quarry and inserts JR into the ventilation shaft above the gold room. When the time comes, JR successfully intimidates the gold room employees into not pressing the panic button, and lets the rest of the crew in. Lynch then takes two employees to pour the melted gold into bars, but he decides against the plan and asks Josh to guard the employees while JR watches the gold pouring. This infuriates Josh who ends up shooting an employee in the leg. Lynch breaks Josh's nose with the stock of a shotgun and returns to watching the gold being poured. Police arrive, and the crew walks into the open disguised as employees, but holding the real employees at gunpoint. Then, Lynch releases the hostages and opens fire on the police vehicles and personnel. Chris arrives with the getaway vehicle, but on their way out, Sterlo is shot through the abdomen and begins bleeding heavily. Chris manages to incapacitate the two chasing police vehicles and escape, but Sterlo dies at the end of the chase, instructing Lynch to give his cut of the heist to his wife.\nSam betrays Lynch, JR, and Tasha, but the three escape safely and travel to Melbourne where Sam plans to meet his fence. JR and Lynch sabotage the rendezvous, killing Sam's henchman and kidnapping Josh in the process. After interrogating Josh, they find the gold stashed in a storage unit.\nLynch and JR kill Sam in his estate. Before JR and Lynch escape for good, Lynch offers him $350,000 to leave. Here it is revealed that when JR realized Lynch would discard him once he had acquired the gold, JR masterminded a plan to steal the gold with Tasha and take half. Lynch has no choice but to accept JR's terms and wait. Before he receives the gold, however, a woman in a laundromat identifies him as the escaped convict, and Lynch is sent back to jail. Later JR sends Lynch a postcard detailing where the gold has been left for him, and a picture of a pregnant Tasha, hinting at an optimistic future.", "tmdb_plot": "Locked up for a minor crime, 19 year old JR quickly learns the harsh realities of prison life.

After the incident, Talia takes Damian to Gotham City to meet his father and remain in his care while she and the League deal with Slade. The aggressive, highly independent Damian objects and frequently disobeys his father's orders in an attempt to seek out Slade and avenge Ra's himself. After he is accosted by Nightwing for sneaking out and brutally attacking an associate of Slade's, Batman berates Damian for his recklessness and willingness to kill. Batman then has Damian don the mantle of Robin in order to teach him discipline.\nSlade, now calling himself Deathstroke, captures Talia as well as Dr. Kirk Langstrom, a scientist previously working with Ra's. Commissioner Gordon warns Batman about an abandoned stadium believed to house Deathstroke's men; after infiltrating the stadium, Batman and Damian attempt to question Langstrom, who initially refuses to leave as Deathstroke is holding his family hostage. When Damian becomes violently impatient and inadvertently alerts the enemy to their arrival, the groups is confronted by a swarm of Man-Bats, which Langstrom explains is part of Deathstroke's plan to create superhuman, flight-capable assassins. While Nightwing works with Langstrom on an antidote for the Man-Bats, Batman and Damian set off to rescue Langstrom's family. Batman deduces that Talia has been abducted and while rescuing Langstrom's family, Damian is relayed her location via a ransom video given to Langstrom's daughter.\nNightwing learns that Deathstroke is operating in an oil rig off the Scottish coast, and while Batman is distracted, Damian goes to the rig alone to rescue his mother.

In Bethlehem, Jesus is born to a virgin named Mary and her husband Joseph. Three wise men visit Jesus declare him the future King.\nThirty years later, an adult Jesus Christ (Diogo Morgado) travels to Galilee and begins recruiting followers, James, his brother John, Peter, a fisherman, Matthew, a tax collector and Mary Magdalene. Soon these men and women eventually become his disciples.\nThrough his teachings and numerous miracles, Jesus builds a huge following, who begin to call him the Messiah. He also draws the attention of the Pharisees, Jewish religious leaders. The Pharisees claim Jesus is blaspheming God by forgiving sins, something only God can do. Jesus responds by saying he is the son of God.\nJesus tells the disciples they are to travel to Jerusalem for the upcoming Passover holiday. He enters the city on the back of a donkey and is met by a huge crowd of supporters, who lay palm leaves in his path. Caiaphas, the head of the Pharisees, is afraid that Jesus' presence in the city will further agitate his people, who are already in a near state of revolt against the oppressive Romans, led by Pontius Pilate. It is revealed that, earlier, Pilate had warned Caiaphas that if there were any trouble from the Jews, he would close the temple, thus cancelling Passover.\nUpon entering the temple, Jesus sees a group of money changers and proceeds to upend their tables. This act draws cheers from the people and scorn from the Pharisees. Later, Jesus tells a little girl that every stone of the temple will soon fall. The Pharisees take this as a plan to destroy the temple and decide Jesus must be stopped. Judas, one of Jesus' disciples, approaches the Pharisees. He believes Jesus is going too far and wants to help. The Pharisees give him 30 pieces of silver for his assistance.\nThe night before Passover, Jesus tells the disciples this will be their Last Supper together and says that one of them will betray him. Later, in the Garden of Gethsemane, Judas kisses Jesus' cheek, thereby identifying Jesus to the Pharisees and revealing Judas' betrayal. Jesus is arrested while the disciples flee the garden to save themselves.\nOut of fear of the temple's closure due to an open trial during Passover, Caiaphas orders an immediate trial during the late hours of night in privacy, which are violations of Jewish law, against the order of other priests. Caiaphas asks Jesus if he is the son of God, and he answers \"I am\". This is all the Pharisees need to hear, and they immediately find Jesus guilty of blasphemy.\nThat morning, to a growing crowd, Caiaphas announces Jesus' guilt and reveals the penalty for blasphemy is death. Judas, horrified by what he has done, throws the silver at the Pharisees and runs off; he later hangs himself. Caiaphas believes if the Pharisees killed Jesus on Passover, it would start a riot, so he turns him over to the Romans for the punishment.\nPilate tells Caiaphas that Jesus didn't break any Roman laws, but orders him to be lashed 40 times. Since it's Passover, Pilate says he will follow tradition and free a prisoner of the people's choosing, and if they choose Jesus, he will be set free. By this time, Mary (Roma Downey) has arrived in Jerusalem to see what is happening to her son.\nPilate orders the crowd to enter his courtyard to choose whether to release Jesus or Barabbas, a convicted murderer. Since none of Jesus' followers are allowed into the courtyard, Caiaphas easily sways the vote so that Barabbas is set free. Pilate then asks what he should do with Jesus, and again Caiaphas sways the crowd to have him executed by way of crucifixion.\nFearing a riot among the hostile people, Pilate orders the crucifixion, then literally washes his hands of the situation. A battered and bloodied Jesus then carries a cross to Golgotha and is nailed to it by the mocking Roman guards, who earlier had placed a crown of thorns on his head. Before the cross is put into place, Pilate orders a sign attached to it, reading: \"The King of the Jews\", much to Caiaphas' dismay.\nWith John, Mary and Magdalene watching in horror, Jesus hangs from the cross for several agonizing hours. After forgiving the Romans and the Pharisees who condemned him to death, he asks why God has forsaken him, and declares \"It is finished\". Accomplished, Jesus dies as the temple and earth are shaken by an earthquake. While the lamps are knocked down, the curtains in the temple where God's spirit was supposed to be present, tear apart. He is then lowered from the cross and placed into a tomb, which is sealed off with a large rock.\nThree days later, Magdalene goes to visit the tomb but is shocked to see the rock broken into pieces and the tomb empty. Magdalene soon sees a man by the tomb's entrance and realizes he is Jesus, who has been resurrected. Magdalene goes to the disciples' hiding place and tells them the good news, but they don't believe her at first. Jesus then appears to them, and they all now believe, except \"Doubting\" Thomas. Once Thomas touches Jesus, then he believes.\nForty days later, Jesus is speaking to his disciples where he tells them to travel the world and spread his message. He then ascends into Heaven, and the disciples go their separate ways.\nAfter finishing his story, an elderly John says that all of the disciples were eventually killed for their beliefs, except him. He has been exiled to live alone on a deserted island until he dies.

His wife, Sandy, has Alzheimer's and no longer recognizes him, but he poses as a doctor to visit her and does her laundry. Vincent's only close friends are his cat Felix and a pregnant Russian sex worker named Daka. Despite his aggression toward strangers, Vincent has acquaintances who admire and care about him.\nVincent's 30-year-old Chrysler LeBaron  gets hit by a branch felled by his new neighbors' moving van. Maggie Bronstein, a radiology tech in the midst of an acrimonious divorce, and her son Oliver, meet Vincent, who demands payment for the injury. Maggie does her best to provide for Oliver, who is ostracized and bullied at his Catholic school, but is a knowledgeable, friendly boy, warmly welcomed by his new teacher.

Vincent offers to continue \"babysitting\" for a fee.\nVincent picks up Oliver daily after school because Maggie often has late shifts. Vincent's ideas of after-school activities involve visits to racetracks and bars. The mismatched pair begin to help each other mature. Vincent teaches Oliver how to defend himself from bullies, resulting in Oliver breaking the nose of a bully who later apologizes and gives back what he stole. Oliver befriends the boy, who introduces himself as Robert. Vincent and Oliver win a high-odds bet on the horses, enabling Vincent to pay off some of his debts. After staff in Sandy's nursing home have told him he is behind on fees and Sandy will be moved, Vincent steals money from Oliver's bank account when his own accounts are overdrawn, and takes it to the racetrack.

Later, he nominates Vincent at the school's assembly, publicly declaring him \u201cSt. Vincent of Sheepshead Bay\u201d and presenting him with a medal. Oliver's rationale comes from his teacher's definition of sainthood as a person showing 'commitment and dedication' and some sacrifice. Vincent fits this in terms of his wife; he also saved two fellow soldiers during the Vietnam War.

When Camilla hears that the camp will be producing a kabuki version of The Haunting of the Opera, she decides that she will sneak into auditions one way or another. She manages to convince a camper overseeing the auditions, Joel Hopton, to let her in and Camilla easily impresses the stage director Artie and wins the lead role of Sofia - much to Buddy's dismay.\nAs the opening day grows closer and closer, Camilla discovers that Artie will only let her perform on opening day as long as she provides him with sexual favors. He emotionally blackmails her by playing her off of Liz Silver, a camper that will do anything to perform on opening night. Camilla tries to ward off Artie's attentions by only making out with him, which disgusts Joel - whom Camilla has largely ignored since the audition. The night before the performance, Artie gives Camilla an ultimatum: either she sleeps with him or he gives the opening night performance to Liz. Camilla initially acquiesces to Artie's overtures, but decides at the last minute that she can't go through with it. After she leaves, Artie is brutally murdered by someone wearing the Opera Ghost mask, but Roger tells everyone that Artie died by car accident.

All seems well with the musical and Victor until later in the performance, when Opera Ghost kills campers Whitney, Sam, and Sheila, and stops Liz from taking revenge on Camilla for performing on opening night. This causes a gap in the performance, which the cast tries to fill with impromptu music and dancing while Camilla looks for her missing co-star.

Roger learns the truth, turns violent, manages to free himself, and attacks Buddy, fatally stabbing him to death. He decides to kill Camilla because her brother wanted to kill him.

Hannah takes classes in interpretive dancing, hoping to be at the forefront of an upcoming dance meet, while Leo's time is taken up mostly by wrestling, which requires him to make weight and undergo a strict regimen of diets and training. This focus on Leo leaves Hannah, 17 years old, largely up to her own devices. She works part-time at a doughnut shop, and spends time socially with her friends. One day, she and her best friend, Kayden, are browsing the internet in Hannah's bedroom when they accidentally come upon a pro-ana blog on Tumblr, which features multiple gifs of unnaturally-thin people, skeletons, cinematography from The Lovely Bones, and motivational quotes that mock fat people and offer tips on how to avoid eating. Kayden is briefly curious but soon becomes bothered by the blog and leaves it, closing Hannah's laptop. Hannah returns to the blog after Kayden leaves, and joins a forum featured there, which is moderated by the mysterious and enigmatic \"ButterflyAna\". Hannah envisions the forum's visitors in her mind as real people, all abnormally thin and attractive-looking, attending an exclusive club adorned with rainbow string lights for a party, but no food or drinks anywhere. \"ButterflyAna\" visually appears looking like supermodel Abbey Lee Kershaw, and relates to Hannah's inner feelings of poor self-esteem and concerns about things such as her weight, perceived stomach distention and eating too much.\nAt first, as Hannah begins to eat less and less, nobody takes notice. Her parents are mildly confused but initially do not care until her mother happens to walk in on Hannah and find the pro-ana blog open on her computer. Disturbed by it, she begins closely monitoring Hannah's internet browsing activity, while Hannah's father insists that this invasion of privacy is unnecessary if Hannah is not actively using the blog; to prove to her parents that she is eating, Hannah consumes a breakfast muffin in front of them. They are too occupied by Leo's upcoming wresting competition to focus on Hannah, and they urge Leo to make weight and keep his attention on winning. Meanwhile, Hannah's behaviour gets worse. Her friendships suffer, and she rudely insults her dance coach, Ms. Christie, who observes Hannah nearly fainting at a dance practice and forces her to stop attending the classes until she is willing to go to mental health counselling. At the doughnut shop, Hannah is told by her boss to dispose of a bag of half-eaten donuts that have gone stale in the dumpster. In a starvation-induced panic, Hannah rips open a garbage bag and eats most of the old donuts, only to then vomit them up. Hannah visits the forum and admits that she slipped up by eating the old donuts, but \"ButterflyAna\" is unsympathetic, chastising Hannah for gaining weight. She offers to \"help\" Hannah by making the younger girl her new \"personal project\", the ultimate epiphany of thinness, which Hannah readily accepts. The visual rainbow string light party club imagined by Hannah has deteriorated into a frightening, decayed backdrop with dark colours, and all the other Forum members swiftly flee the blog, fearing that their own parents will catch them there if Hannah's mother reports any of it. One forum member, who goes by \"HipHopK\" as their screen name, gives Hannah a serious warning to stay away from the pro-ana blog. Hannah assumes that Kayden is \"HipHopK\", but upon confronting Kayden with this accusation, Kayden argues that she has no idea who that person is, and also that she finds the pro-ana blog creepy.\nHannah's mother goes into Hannah's room to check on her, and discovers her daughter's bedroom walls covered in cutouts from magazines of thin supermodels and women in bikinis. She finds a strange number of moths fluttering around the room, accompanied by a pungent smell, and the curtains have been drawn closed, making the room extremely dark. Hannah's mother opens the bedroom closet and sobs hysterically when she discovers numerous dinner plates of moldy food hidden among Hannah's clothing. The moth caterpillars are feeding on the food and laying eggs there. Hannah comes home, looking haggard and pale, and she flies into a rage upon finding that her mother has gone through her room. She confronts her mother and begins to tear up the room in fury, but she then collapses and is taken to the hospital. Her parents' insurance coverage gives Hannah a brief number of inpatient counselling sessions, during which Hannah is forced to confront her mental illness. She realizes the physical damage that she has done to her body, and also realizes that \"ButterflyAna\" is not a real friend to her. After painting a picture of her anorexia as personified by a dark, sinister butterfly in black ink, which she hangs among similar artworks made by other minors suffering from eating disorders, Hannah is able to return home, in part because her parents' insurance will cover no further sessions at the hospital. Hannah is at risk for relapsing back into her old habits, and so her parents need to keep a close eye on her. Hannah tries to distract herself from the internet by going with her parents to attend Leo's wrestling competition at school. Leo nearly wins, but his opponent recoils in horror after Leo falls unconscious underneath him. When Leo is brought to the hospital, it is revealed that his heart has given out at that he is being kept on life support, showing no brain activity. Hannah's father is outraged at the suggestion from the doctor that Leo himself suffered from an eating disorder, arguing that \"boys and athletes\" don't suffer from such things.

Though the patient protests that she is sane, the professor points out that all mental patients claim to be sane. The young man later arrives at Stonehearst Asylum, where he desires to take up residency. A group of armed men led by Mickey Finn allow him entry. Finn escorts him to the office of the superintendent, Dr. Silas Lamb, where the young man introduces himself as Dr. Edward Newgate from Oxford.\nLamb's unorthodox methods surprise Newgate. Lamb says that he does not believe in drugging or incarcerating patients, and he encourages their delusions when he feels it will bring them greater happiness. As an example Lamb makes Newgate examine volatile Arthur Timbs, whose family sold to a sideshow, without any sedatives but just using his eyes, with Newgate managing to calm Timbs down. Newgate becomes infatuated with Graves. During a fancy feast, Newgate and Finn argue, and, as a truce, Finn proposes a toast. Before Newgate can drink it, Graves causes him to spill his drink and quietly insists that he flee the asylum, but Newgate refuses to leave without her.\nNewgate discovers the actual asylum staff locked in the boiler room, who explain that Lamb and Finn drugged their drinks and led a revolt. Dr. Salt and Mrs. Pike warn Newgate that Lamb is a dangerous madman \u2013 a surgeon who murdered his patients during wartime, while Finn killed his mother and sister. Staff members Paxton and Swanwick escape but are hunted down and slain by several inmates led by Finn. Newgate attempts to recruit Graves, but she declines to become involved and tells him of Salt's abuses. When Newgate sneaks into Lamb's office to retrieve Salt's notes, he overhears Lamb and Finn conspire. Lamb forces Newgate to perform electrical shock treatment (ECT) on Salt. When Salt suffers amnesia, Lamb proclaims him cured of his delusion.\nDuring the New Year's celebration, Finn murders a female patient, who is carried away by Timbs. Convinced that something must be done, Newgate attempts to spike the champagne. He is caught and Lamb prepares Newgate for electric shock therapy. Newgate reveals to Graves that he came to the asylum to rescue her once he saw her at the Oxford demonstration. Lamb grants Newgate a final request: to see a picture of Graves that he keeps in his pocket. When the picture turns out to be one of Lamb's victims, the shock causes Lamb to stagger out of the room in a daze. Finn attempts to take control, but Graves and Newgate lead a revolt against him, as the other patients have become scared of his violent nature.\nAs Finn is electrocuted to death by Arthur, he bursts into flames, whereupon a fire breaks out. Graves leads the patients out of the building, and Newgate leaves to find Lamb, who is near-comatose from the guilt over his actions. Flashbacks reveal that Lamb, under pressure, executed his patients as a form of mercy kill. After they rescue the others, Newgate asks Graves to leave with him, but she says that she cannot be with him because he is normal. Newgate says that he is not normal, as he is in love with her, and has a secret to tell her.\nSome time later, Graves' husband and the earlier Oxford professor arrive to be greeted by Timbs now the new gatekeeper.

Unable to convince Bernadette of the Turtles' existence, April is dismissed. Her coworker Vern Fenwick drives her to Sacks' estate where she confides in him about her discovery. Sacks believes her and reveals that he and April's father had been experimenting on a mutagen created to cure disease, which was thought lost in the fire that killed her dad.\nAt Splinter's behest, the Turtles bring April to their sewer lair. Splinter explains April had saved them all from the fire and free them into the sewer. The mutagen caused the five of them to grow and develop humanoid attributes.

Because elderly tenant Mr. Bezzerides (informally called \"Mr. B\" by the protagonists) has not paid his rent in two months, Callie checks on him, and discovers a strange machine in his apartment that takes Polaroid photos of their living room's picture window\u2014apparently 24 hours in the future, always at 8 pm, although Mr. B's photo display includes daytime photos and is missing some photos. The friends check Mr. B's storage unit and find his inexplicably charred corpse; he has apparently been dead for a week. Gambling addict Jasper pushes to use the machine to win bets but loses, and the next day's photo confirms they will do just that. It also shows that Finn has finally created a new painting; copying the work in the photo gets him past his block. Based on what happened to Mr. B and notes in his journal, they theorize that they have to make sure the events in the photos\u2014whatever they may be\u2014have to occur, or their timeline will stop, and they will therefore cease to be.\nSeveral days go by. The friends cover up Mr. B's disappearance, including lying to the complex security guard, Big Joe, claiming the old man is in the hospital. After a week they get a disturbing photo: Callie kissing Jasper, while Finn paints in the background. Feeling that they have to do what's in the photos, they pose at 8pm the following night.  But the actual kiss goes on too long while Finn paints, and he gets angry and jealous.\nThe next photo shows Jasper's violent bookie Ivan at the apartment. Not knowing why he would be there, Jasper calls him the next morning, saying he won't be making any bets that day. The call raises Ivan's suspicions and he visits Jasper that night, learning of the machine. Ivan forces the friends to now pose for the photos with many more event results for Ivan to make bets on. Finn and Jasper's friendship is strained by these events, as Ivan will be keeping each night's photo, preventing Finn from seeing his painting. Jasper manages to get a cellphone picture of the next photo before giving it to Ivan's goon, Marcus. This photo shows a hastily made skull and crossbones on the canvas, which Jasper believes is a warning to themselves, so he hides weapons (a kitchen knife, golf club, and hammer) near the couch.\nThe next evening, Finn runs into Big Joe at the gate, who has just gotten a job as a police officer. Marcus sees their meeting and calls Ivan, who does not believe their story about Big Joe. Ivan threatens all of them, but Jasper convinces him that tonight's new photo is of Ivan's death at Marcus' hands. While Ivan is retrieving the photo, Jasper stabs Marcus, then clubs Ivan to death on his return. They hide the bodies in Mr. B's storage unit. Finn and Callie fight, so Finn sleeps on the couch. Later that night, they are visited by Mr. B's colleague, Dr. Heidecker, who is looking for Mr. B.  Finn and Jasper can't keep their stories straight about Mr. B, so Dr. Heidecker levels a gun at them and forces them to confess. Mr. B had mailed Heidecker a photo that covers the next night, but taken before his death, meaning that the machine could be set to take photos more than 24 hours in advance. The photo shows blood on the window, Mr. B's hat on the friends' couch (Jasper has taken to wearing the dead man's hat), and a picture of a green coil that resembles the broken device on the ground next to Mr. B's corpse. Dr. Heidecker theorizes that \"time\" did not kill Mr. B for trying to change the future - he knocked over a coil in his storage unit and the released gas killed him. As she does not know how to adjust the settings of the machine, Jasper shoots Heidecker dead using Ivan's gun.\nThe next night's photo shows Callie and Jasper having sex in the window with Finn unconscious on the couch. Finn talks with Jasper to try to devise a means to prevent events, but Jasper knocks him out and locks him in Mr. B's storage unit\u2014he does not believe Dr. Heidecker's theory and intends to prevent a paradox, making sure the photo happens, no matter what. Trying to find a way out of the locked storage unit, he searches Heidecker's purse and finds the photo that includes blood on the window, Mr B's hat on the couch, and the painting of the coil, and realizes that he had to have painted the coil in the future the next day so that Mr. B would die in the storage room in the first place, thus allowing him to escape using Mr. B's keys. He escapes and goes to the machine. He calls Jasper, who sees him at the machine, and threatens to destroy it if Jasper does not stop. A fight ensues, culminating with Callie smashing Jasper's head in. When making the painting to match Heidecker's photo, Finn realizes a discrepancy. He discovers that the camera also takes a photo at 8 am, a truth which Callie kept to herself. Callie reveals that she has been using the morning photo to send herself messages to manipulate events and rekindle her relationship with Finn; the sex photo is one of those missing from Mr. B's wall, from a drunken night a month ago (the other missing photos are ones of Callie and Jasper being affectionate, which she took down from the wall when she first discovered the machine). Finn rejects Callie and goes to destroy the machine, so she shoots him, creating the blood splatter on the window from Heidecker's photo - she thinks that if she sends herself a message in the window when the photo is taken, it will send a message to herself 24 hours ago, preventing these events from happening. While Callie is attempting to tape a note to herself on the window, Big Joe stops by, discovers the murdered Jasper and Finn, and arrests her.\nAs Callie is led away by Joe - confident that the timeline will reset - the note she left falls off the window, making permanent the events that have taken place.

Following a subtle, tense interaction with Andre assisting an acquaintance who is actually his father, they visit the apartment of Andre's old friends and his ex-girlfriend. Chelsea interviews each, learning that Andre wasn't particularly funny when he started in stand-up comedy. They nominate their five favorite rappers, including a sixth in their lineups as well. Andre goes to radio shows such as Opie and Anthony to promote Uprize and attends a press conference with fellow stars including Taraji P. Henson and Gabourey Sidibe. To his chagrin, Andre is asked when there will be another Hammy movie.\nAt a hotel, Andre and Chelsea unexpectedly encounter her boyfriend, Brad, along with his friend Ryan, who is wearing Brad's shirt. Chelsea deduces Brad is cheating on her with Ryan. She and Andre, both recovering alcoholics, stop in a liquor store but resist making a purchase. Chelsea explains in graphic detail how the signs were there that Brad was gay. Andre laughs, calling Chelsea naive. She becomes angry and insults his movie, but the two end up kissing. Andre asks to borrow Chelsea's phone, since his own died. While using it, he sees an email from her editor, revealing James Nielson is Chelsea herself. The truth devastates Andre, who angrily tells Chelsea he felt he was never funny unless he was drunk or high, and now is fearful for his career. Despondent and acting out at a supermarket, he is arrested by police.\nIn jail, Andre calls Erica, who fumes over the arrest, mainly because of how it will look for her image. She tells Andre this piece of fame is all she has since she thinks she has no other talent. Erica's manager Benny takes the phone and tells Andre to go to his bachelor party for good press and fly out for the wedding. Andre's bodyguard Silk bails out Andre, and they go to a strip club for a bachelor party with a theme based on Hammy The Bear. There, Andre hangs out with Jerry Seinfeld, Adam Sandler, and Whoopi Goldberg. They give him different views on marriage and sex. Andre runs into Chelsea, who wants to make it up to him and invites him to follow her.\nAndre, Chelsea, and Silk go to the Comedy Cellar, where Andre gets up onstage and performs standup for the first time in years. He turns out to still be funny, and the crowd loves him. After the performance, he tells Chelsea he got inspired to return to standup after being in jail and talking to DMX, who told Andre he does not want to keep rapping and wants to sing instead. DMX then sings \"Smile\", terribly.\nThey drop Chelsea off at her place, where she and Andre share one last kiss before departing. Andre asks for her top five rappers, which she lists. While driving away, Silk tells Andre he should have gone after Chelsea. Andre goes through the gift bag from the party and finds items including a scented candle and a bottle of vodka. Then he pulls out a slipper, and Silk smiles.\nAfter the credits begin rolling, the movie returns to the party, where Jerry Seinfeld shares his \"top five\" as Sugarhill Gang, Eminem, Wale, Ice Cube, and Sir Mix-a-Lot.", "tmdb_plot": "A comedian tries to make it as a serious actor when his reality-TV star fianc\u00e9 talks him into broadcasting their wedding on her TV show.", "tmdb_id": "284296", "wiki_id": "39762535"}, {"title": "Total Siyapaa", "genres": ["Romance", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Settled in London, Aman, a Pakistani musician, hopes to marry Asha, an Indian woman also living in London with her family.

Will is given no more than a month to live. In desperation, Evelyn comes up with a plan to upload Will's consciousness into the quantum computer that the project has developed. His best friend and fellow researcher, Max Waters, questions the wisdom of this choice, reasoning that the \"uploaded\" Will would only be an imitation of the real person. Will's consciousness survives his body's death in this technological form and requests to be connected to the Internet to grow in capability and knowledge. Max believes that the computer is not actually Will and demands that it be shut down. Evelyn, being offended, demands that Max leave.\nAt a bar, Max is met by Bree, the leader of R.I.F.T.

As Will has already spread his influence to all the networked computer technology in the world, Max and R.I.F.T. develop a computer virus with the purpose of deleting Will's source code, destroying him. Evelyn plans to upload the virus by infecting herself and then having Will upload her consciousness. A side effect of the virus would be the destruction of technological civilization. This would also disable the nano-particles, which have spread in the water, through the wind and have already started to eradicate pollution, disease, and human mortality.\nWhen Evelyn goes back to the research center, she is stunned to see Will in a newly created organic body identical to his old one.

Determined to make the most of his trip, Wallace tries to find another person to interview. He finds a flyer from someone offering a room in his home for free and the guarantee of hearing interesting stories. Intrigued, he arrives at the mansion of Howard Howe, a retired seaman in a wheelchair.\nHoward tells the story of how a walrus, whom he named \"Mr. Tusk\", rescued him after a shipwreck. Wallace passes out from the secobarbital laced in the tea Howard made for him. The next morning, Wallace wakes up to find himself strapped into a wheelchair and his left leg amputated. Howard reveals that he can still walk and lays out his plans; he plans to fit Wallace into a perfectly constructed walrus costume in an attempt to re-create Mr. Tusk.

On Friday evening, after Sandra hears the news and that only two of the 16 voted for her to stay, she breaks down, feeling hopeless and worthless.\nHer husband, Manu, tries to lift her spirits. A co-worker friend Juliette, who voted on her behalf, convinces her to talk to M. Dumont, the Solwal manager. Sandra is too petrified to speak, but Juliette argues her case. Juliette tells him some of the workers felt pressured to vote against Sandra by the factory foreman Jean-Marc, who insinuated one job must be eliminated. Though hesitant, Dumont agrees to a second, secret ballot early Monday.\nRealising that her fate rests in the hands of her co-workers, Sandra must visit each of the 14 over the course of the weekend to persuade them to reject the monetary bonus, and she faces an uphill battle to keep her job before the crucial vote on Monday. Most of her co-workers are counting on the bonus for their own families. Some of her co-workers are immigrants and some are already working second jobs to get by; most react with sympathy, but a few with anger. Sandra is crushed when a co-worker she considered a friend pretends not to be home, but is heartened by the few who support her and say they will vote for her. Timur, an immigrant from Dagestan, breaks down in tears and says he is ashamed of himself, as Sandra covered for him when he broke a panel on his first day.

He will only get \u20ac150 because he is new, but he is afraid of Jean-Marc, who told him to vote against Sandra if he wants to get along with his co-workers. Alphonse tells her he wants to vote for her, but he's afraid Jean-Marc will find out and write him up for his mistakes, which could damage his chance of renewing his contract when it expires in September.\nOn Monday morning, as the Solwal workers vote again, Jean-Marc reacts angrily to Sandra. She stands up for herself and reminds him that he acted unfairly. In the second ballot, eight vote for her to keep the job, and eight vote to keep the bonus \u2013 not enough to overturn Friday's vote.

The story has several perspectives from the various characters involved and hence must be preserved as they are. In a flashback scene, a young boy Richard Anthony aka Richi is trying to outrun cops who are there to arrest him for murder. Regina remembers seeing this from the backseat of a car and it is established that both were childhood friends. Regina starts investigating the story by questioning various characters who were involved.\nChapter 1: Voice of Silence-\nThe first person she approaches is a local cashewnut merchant, Shailesha who knows both Richi and his childhood friend Raghu. Richi had been in a remand home for 8 years and Raghu had escaped to Bombay to work in a hotel and later with a local gang. Shailesha accidentally comes across Raghu during one of his Bombay trips. The two meet up in Bombay harbour where Shailesha tells Raghu that his father is no more and his mother is making a living by selling fish at the local market. Raghu tells him he cannot leave Bombay as he knows many secrets of his employer. He plans to relocate to Dubai with his mother, once he has sorted out the necessary funds.\nTo do this, Raghu steals a red bag which was important for a 'deal' between the Bombay party and an interested party in the US. He fights his ways through the gang's henchmen and escapes to Malpe where Shailesha provides him with a safe house. Raghu realises that his location is compromised as two armed gangsters approach his house and start knocking at the front door. As Raghu steeled himself for the impending gunfight, the knocking stops and the men leave.\nChapter 2: Richard Antony alias Richi-\nThe second narrative comes from a close ally of Richi, Dinesha, who is held in lock-up. Richi is a brash and flamboyant young man who carries out dirty work for a local gangster-cum-businessman, Shankar Poojary. Poojary has links with the Bombay underworld and runs several fishing boats in Malpe. Richi has earned a bad reputation for himself and is a disgrace to his father, a priest in the local church.\nPoojary summons Richi and Dinesha to his estate and tasks him to find Balu, one of his employees to 'teach him a lesson. Poojary asks Richi not to overdo it by 'losing control'. The annual Janmashtami festival in Udupi is in full swing as Richi and the gang arrive at Jodu Raste. Balu has painted himself as a tiger and is participating in Huli-vesha (tiger dance). Richi knocks out Balu and has him sent to the harbour. However, he takes a detour when he hears that Raghu is back in town and needs a visit.\nIt is revealed that Richi and Dinesha were the armed gangsters who were looking for Raghu in the previous story. Richi forces his way into the house and goes about explaining the made-up story of a Cuban boy (Tony Montana from the film Scarface) and a boy from Mandva (Vijay Chauhan from the movie Agneepath), and how a person at the receiving end of a beating often doesn't realise why he is being served this. This story doubles as a threat to Raghu and also as a metaphor for the viewers who are kept in dark as the violent story unfolds. Richi finds the red bag which Raghu had stolen from the Bombay gang and asks the latter to join him for a boat ride. Raghu reluctantly agrees to say that he has to join his mother for dinner later in the day.\nOnce on the fishing boat, Richi is torturing Balu and forcing a confession out of him. Eventually, Richi pulls out a gun on Balu who by now is a broken man, and fires a shot. It would seem that Balu is no more.\nChapter 3: Fish Curry-\nRaghu's mother Ratnakka makes a living out of selling fish in Malpe. After the death of her husband, her life is of struggle. Raghu visits his mother at his childhood house and tells her that he wishes to move permanently to Dubai along with her. However, he has to leave immediately and will return to pick her up once her documents are in order. He agrees to visit her the next day for dinner where she will prepare her signature dish Meen-saru (fish curry). The next day, a gleeful Ratnakka is shopping for fish in the local market, where she lets her fellow fisherwomen know that she is leaving for Dubai soon. That evening Ratnakka elaborately prepares the fish curry and waits for her son to arrive. Her joy turns to disappointment as the hours go by and she slowly starts to realise that her son may not return.\nChapter 4: Whispers in the Wind-\nMunna has a soft corner for Balu's sister Sharada, who sells fish. He often roams around the fish market in hopes of getting a glimpse of her. He also tries to woo her with the help of a young lad, aptly known as Democracy. Munna works as a repairman for Shankar Poojary's boats. During the routine inspection of a fishing boat that Richi had used for his earlier adventure, Munna discovers an empty shell casing on the deck. Having the knowledge that Balu was previously seen with Richi at the harbour, Munna concludes that Balu has been murdered by Richi and his gang.\nChapter 5: Ka-\nBalu is in a ragged state when Regina approaches him for questioning. Balu has developed a prejudice for crows and starts to pelt stones at them whenever he sees one. During one of his fishing trips, he catches a heavy log of wood in the fishing net. Balu decides to keep this to himself and soon discovers that the log actually contains a priceless relic which glows like gold.\nBalu tries to make a profit out of this by selling the merchandise to a foreign party through a Bombay-based middleman. The middleman is not able to make full payment as the merchandise has been misplaced and a deal cannot be finalised. As the Janmashtami festival approaches Balu has himself painted as a tiger for Pili-vesha and is performing at Jod raste. Richi and the gang knock him out and take him on a fishing boat to force a confession. During the interrogation, Richi pulls out a gun and it is revealed that the shot was fired at Raghu. During his childhood, Richi had committed a hot-blooded murder trying to protect Raghu, after which the latter escaped to Bombay leaving Richi behind to be arrested. Richi has deep bitterness against Raghu for his betrayal because of which he spent 8 years in a remand home.\nOn opening the red bag, it is revealed that it contains the merchandise which Balu was trying to sell off and Raghu is the middleman, who stole the item before the deal could go through. He was planning to sell it in Dubai in order to secure a life for him and his mother.\nFinal Chapter: Reasons-\nRichi returns to Malpe where he is celebrating with Poojary and the tigers from Pili-vesha. Munna believes Balu was killed by Richi's gang and is now blinded by hatred for Richi and compassion for Sharada. Finding the right opportunity, Munna pulls out Dinesha's gun and shoots down Richi who in his dying moments is unaware of Munna's motive. The irony is clearly seen now that Richi becomes a victim of his own story of The Cuban boy and boy from Mandva. Dinesha returns the favour by killing Munna, who in his dying moments finds peace in the fact that he has avenged Sharada.\nIt is now clear that Regina was investigating the triple murders of Richi, Munna, and Raghu. She concludes that the story has many facets and cannot be clubbed into a single narrative and hence decides to name the story, Ulidavaru Kandante (As Seen by the Rest).", "tmdb_plot": "Malpe, a small fishing town on the Arabian Coast.

One engine fails and the aircraft ultimately crashes in the ocean. Louie survives alongside two others, Phil and Mac, floating on two inflatable rafts.\nOn their 27th day adrift, they attract the attention of a Japanese fighter plane, which strafes and damages the rafts but misses them. Mac dies six days later. On the 47th day, Japanese sailors find and capture Louie and Phil. Now prisoners of war, Louie and Phil are imprisoned on Kwajalein Atoll. The American airmen are interrogated for info on newer bombers and the Norden bombsight. Louie states they flew older models and draws a rendering of a Philco radio. They are dragged out to disrobe and kneel on planks, expecting to be executed. Instead, they are crudely washed and shipped to Japan. Upon arrival, they are sent to different POW camps.\nAt camp \u014cmori, in Tokyo, Louis and his fellow POWs are the responsibility of Japanese corporal Mutsuhiro Watanabe who is especially hard on Louie, beating him often. Louie is given an opportunity to broadcast a message home saying he is alive after learning the U.S. government classified him as KIA. As he refuses to broadcast another message full of anti-American propaganda, he is sent back to camp, where Watanabe has each prisoner punch him.\nAfter two years, Watanabe is promoted to Sergeant and leaves the camp. The camp is damaged when Tokyo was bombed, so Louie and the others are moved to Naoetsu prison camp. Here, Watanabe is again in command but as he is now a Sergeant, he supervises the prisoners at work loading coal barges. Louie pauses during work and is punished by Watanabe making him lift a large wooden beam and hold it over his head. He orders a guard to shoot him if he drops it, but Louie defiantly holds it up despite his exhaustion. This enrages Watanabe as Louie stares him straight in the eye, provoking him to beat him severely.\nAt the end of the war, Louie and the other POWs are liberated when the Americans occupy Japan just as a bomber flies overhead and confirms that the war is over. Louie tries to find Watanabe in his quarters but sees he has already fled. He sits down, staring at a picture of Watanabe as a child alongside his father. He is returned home to America, where he kisses the ground on arriving home.\nAt the end of the film, there is a slideshow of the real Louie and the events in his life following the war: He married and had two children. Phil too survived and married. Mutsuhiro \"The Bird\" Watanabe went into hiding and evaded prosecution despite being on the top 40 most-wanted Japanese war criminals list by General Douglas MacArthur. Louie lived out his promise to convert to Christianity, to devote his life to God and to forgive his wartime captors, meeting with many of them. Many years later, however, Watanabe still refused to meet with Louie.\nLouie had an opportunity to relive his time as an Olympian when he ran a leg of the Olympic Torch relay for the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. He was four days short of his 81st birthday, on a stretch not far from one of the POW camps where he was held.

One year later, her former childhood best friend Blaire Lily is chatting with her boyfriend Mitch Roussel on Skype, during which they agree to lose their virginities to each other on prom night. Soon after they are joined by their friends and classmates Jess Felton, Ken Smith, and Adam Sewell, and an unknown user known as \"billie227.\"\nThe group of friends tries various ways to get rid of the intruder but are unsuccessful each time. Blaire looks up the account and realizes that it belonged to Laura Barns, revealing \"billie227\" as Laura even though the friends are still incredulous about this possibility. The group suspects that a classmate, Val Rommel, is pranking them. After they invite Val to their chat, Jess' Facebook page is updated with embarrassing photos of Val at a party. Jess denies uploading the photos and deletes them from her account, but the pictures instantly reappear on Adam's account. Val receives a message or picture not visible to the others, but which she considers a threat. Angry, she calls 911 to report that she is being harassed, and abruptly leaves the chat. The group receives a photo of Val and Laura's Facebook messages from before Laura's death, with Val telling Laura to kill herself. Val reappears on the chat, sitting motionless and silent next to a bottle of bleach before collapsing. Police officers arrive shortly after; the friends eavesdrop and learn that Val died from a presumed suicide. User \"billie227\" then sends each of the friends a personalized message proving intimate knowledge of their secrets; in Blaire's case, which is the one visible to the audience, this turns out to be a couple of pictures revealing that she had an affair with Adam. Ken distributes a program to remove \"billie227\" from the chat, and then Adam attempts to call the police. However, the 911 operator turns out to be the intruder and re-enters the chat, revealing a camera view from the other side of Ken's room. He approaches the camera source and his Skype is briefly cut before it shows him killing himself with a blender.\nBillie/Laura forces the remaining four friends to play a game of Never Have I Ever, stating that the loser will die. During the course of the game, it is revealed that Jess started a rumor that Blaire had an eating disorder; Blaire stole and crashed Jess' mother's car; Mitch made out with Laura (although he says it was one-sided on her end and he pushed her off), and also reported Adam to the police for dealing cannabis; Jess stole $800 from Adam; and Adam offered to trade Jess' life for the others in the group. Tensions flare and a drunken Adam finally loses his temper and uses the game to force Blaire to reveal that she is no longer a virgin, having slept with him behind Mitch's back. Mitch is distraught and retaliates by forcing Adam to admit that he roofied a classmate, raped her while she was unconscious, and then forced her to abort the resulting pregnancy.\nBlaire and Adam receive messages sent remotely to their printers which they refuse to show to Mitch and Jess. Mitch threatens to leave if Blaire does not show the note and Laura warns that Mitch will die if he signs off. In a moment of panic, Blaire shows her paper which states: \"If you reveal this note, Adam will die.\" Adam shoots himself, revealing he had the same note, except it was for Blaire.\nLaura continues the game, asking Jess if she defaced her grave. When Blaire convinces Jess not to continue playing, Laura cuts the lights in Jess' house and disconnects her video feed. Blaire looks for help on Chatroulette and has a stranger in Nevada send police to Jess\u2018 house. Soon after, Jess\u2018 Skype reconnects showing her with an activated curling iron forced down her throat, killing her.\nLaura cuts the lights in Blaire's and Mitch's houses, wanting them to confess who uploaded the video. Blaire tells her that Mitch was the one who posted it; Mitch grabs a knife and stabs himself in the eye. Blaire tearfully regrets how their friendship ended, but Laura scoffs at the comment and starts another countdown. Laura then uploads an extended version of the party video to Blaire's Facebook which reveals Blaire as the camera operator for the original video, which quickly gains attention, with multiple people sending hateful comments towards Blaire.

Their job is to bug corrupt people and teach them moral lessons quite unconventionally. They target a corrupt minister and become the most wanted people in Mumbai, but also earn respect, affection, and admiration in the media and general public.\nMeanwhile, ACP Ashok Kaale (Sanjay Dutt) meets his superior, DCP Shivraman (Shiv Kumar Subramaniam) who introduces him to Police Commissioner Arvind Kaul (Raza Murad) with the task of deciphering the Ungli gang. Later, Kaale travels to another police station where he meets an amusingly frustrated officer, Kaale's colleague and bomb-squad commandant Mishra (Shishir Sharma), who is disgusted with the \"crime\" his recruit Nikhil Abhyankar (Emraan Hashmi) has done. Eventually, it goes so: a college was attended to by the bomb squad when there was news that a bomb was planted there. Nikhil took advantage of the situation and met his girlfriend (Rachel White) with whom he shared a kiss, but soon they were caught by the dogs of the Bomb Squad. Later, it surfaced up that the call was made from Mishra's desk, and Nikhil did it. Kaale finds it funny at first and points out the clever act Nikhil made, but when the officer reprimands Nikhil and himself, Kaale visits Nikhil's mother (Reema Lagoo) where she tells him that Nikhil had the qualities of his father, Kaale's colleague Arvind, and that Nikhil was raised by Kaale like his own son. Nikhil, it is shown, attends a disco bar, where Kaale calls him up to discuss matters concerning the \"Ungli\" gang.\nNikhil begins searching for altruistic opportunities to earn the Ungli gang great fame, once by blowing up the roads in front of a minister's house and accusing politicians and PWD workers of torturing the people by lavishly spending money on renovation of roads directly linked to houses and offices of politicians and corporates alone, another instance by putting up a label of dishonesty on the auto-rickshaw drivers by accusing them of charging high rates and showing reluctance when asked to drive to places close by. Finding him adamant, Maya suggests that Nikhil too has wishes to join the gang, and on certain terms and conditions, the four friends admit Nikhil, and narrate the story behind the gang's formation.\nMaya's brother Rajeev Singh aka Ricky (Arunoday Singh) was a great fitness freak and struck a rapport with the four friends quite a time. However, one day, while trying to prevent a scuffle between an old man (Avijit Dutt) and a bratty youngster Anshuman, Ricky tried to defend the old man, but Anshuman struck him hard, landing him straight into coma. The old man later decided to complain to the police, but was advised against it by the police itself, when a hunchback of Police Supremo B.R. Dayal (Mahesh Manjrekar), Anshuman's father, spoke so. The old man was firm, but when his granddaughter, while waiting at a bus stop, was threatened with an acid attack, the old man was forced to swerve from his stand to protect her. This plunged Maya into grief, but Abhay was angry at one of Maya's comments and this paved the way for the \"Ungli\" gang. Nikhil poses as a law student to illusion the four.\nWhile preparing for a raid, Nikhil sprained his knee, but later called up Kaale when the four left. However, feeling remorseful, he later attacked Kaale to defend his new \"friends\", but when his identity was discovered, the four friends slammed him with Abhay hitting him hard, and Kaale further hitting him, but Nikhil later chides Kaale for believing the \"Ungli\" gang as a criminal force. However, when faced with a loss of duty, finding that DCP Shivraman is trying to bribe him into getting a posting of choice to save ends, Kaale agrees with Nikhil, and seeks out the gang to expose Dayal. Meanwhile, Abhay confesses to his co-worker, Tiesta Sen (Neha Dhupia) his love for her as well as his identity of the \"Ungli\" gang.\nExposing a dirty racquet of money makers in the widely distributed Mumbai police force with a simple chemical trick involving sulphur sprayed over printed notes that would leave a lasting black impressions on the officer's tongue via saliva, Kaale regains duty and is promoted to the post of Commissioner, getting Dayal and Anshuman arrested.

The officer in charge tells Hanne Lindberg, Head of the Cyber Division of Europol, that Benjamin asked to conduct the interrogation. Benjamin says that he has information regarding FR13NDS (), a notorious hacking group of four members connected to the Russian cyber mafia, and MRX, an infamous hacker known on Darknet; he tells her that he could give them both to Hanne if she listens to him. Having no choice, Hanne sits down.\nBenjamin tells Hanne that he is like a superhero: like many heroes, he, too, has no parents; he never met his father as he abandoned the family when Benjamin was born, and his mother committed suicide when he was 8. He lives alone with his ailing grandmother. He regards his \"superpower\" as invisibility, as he was never noticed by most people during his childhood, due to him being socially awkward. He says he learned programming and hacked his first system when he was 14. Though he felt like a loser in real life, he felt a sense of belonging on the Internet. While spending most of his time on Darknet, he met his hacking hero, MRX, whose identity no one knows and who can hack into any system. Benjamin aspires to be like him.\nHowever, as he was unable to attend university, he worked as a pizza delivery boy to pay the bills. He tells Hanne that, one night while he delivered pizzas to a group of students, he saw Marie, a girl with whom he was in love since his school days. Hearing her having trouble with examinations, he decided to help her and be a 'superhero'. He went to the University, hacked into its servers to download the exam questions\u2014but he was caught by a security guard and arrested. Having no prior criminal record, he was forced to perform community service as a punishment.\nHe tells Hanne that while working on cleaning the streets as punishment, he met Max, a fellow hacker, who Benjamin feels is the opposite of himself; a charismatic, cocky and confident individual. Later, Max had introduced him to his colleagues Stephan and Paul. After Benjamin proved himself as a hacker, Max explained to him that the concept of social engineering is the greatest form of hacking. They decide to form a hacking group, called \"Clowns Laughing At You\", nicknamed CLAY, and they use Benjamin's house as a base of operations, since Benjamin was forced to send his grandmother to a nursing home due to her Alzheimer's disease. They cause general mayhem around Berlin in a form of pranking, becoming popular around social media. However, MRX, with whom is Max obsessed, mocks them outright. Infuriated, Max wants to perform a more outrageous feat of hacking, and Benjamin suggest hacking the main building of BND (German Central Intelligence). Impressed by this outrageous idea, the group agrees with Benjamin and decide to hack the BND in order to impress MRX.\nUsing dumpster diving and phishing to gain access to the BND building, they manage to hack the internal servers and hack the printers to print their logo, titled \"NO SYSTEM IS SAFE\", all around the building, impressing MRX. However, when they go to a club and celebrate, Benjamin notices Max kissing Marie. Infuriated, Benjamin refuses to let them into the house, also offending Marie when she visits him due to his anger. Feeling inferior, he secretly contacts MRX, offering him valuable information: a database from BND's private servers, which he hacked while he was in the BND building, which impresses MRX. When the group arrives the next day, Benjamin is still furious and attacks Max, who responds by beating him up. However, Paul, watching the TV, hears on the news that one of the members of FR13NDS, nicknamed Krypton, was murdered. Benjamin admits that he gave the information from the BND to MRX, and after checking them, realizes that the information identified Krypton as a double agent working with Hanne to expose MRX and FR13NDS, and CLAY is now labeled as a terrorist group for hacking the information.\nSeeking to clear their name for the murder, Benjamin contacts MRX, who instructs them to hack into the Europol database in exchange for MRX's identity, giving them a hacking tool to help. After dissolving their hard drives in acid to erase data, they travel to Europol's headquarters in The Hague in order to try and break their way in\u2014but it's impossible to find a way inside.  The headquarters dump their trash in a secured building, the sewers are locked, and phishing attempts failed. However, while checking out the building, Benjamin notices a group of scholars visiting the building, and one of them drops his visitor card.  Using Max's advice about social engineering, Benjamin manages to gain access to the building by fooling a guard and plants a hacking device inside. He then hacks into the internal Europol servers and provides MRX with an entrance, secretly encoded inside a double trojan horse so MRX will be exposed when he tries to gain access. However, MRX, anticipating this, takes a snapshot of Benjamin via his webcam, exposing him. Benjamin is forced to flee when a group of Russian mobsters finds him; he evades them in the subway.\nBenjamin returns to the hotel where he was staying with the trio, only to find them murdered. Having no other choice and knowing that FRI3NDS would kill him, he decided to turn himself in to Hanne, proving that he is serious after stating that he hacked her profile and learned personal information about her. Hanne, who was suspended for her failure to capture them and is desperate to apprehend FRI3NDS and MRX, agrees to put Benjamin into a witness protection program in exchange for capturing them.  Benjamin logs in as MRX himself and spreads lies about MRX being a snitch, forcing the real MRX to force his way into the Darknet servers with unsafe methods, allowing Benjamin to expose him.  MRX is exposed as a 19-year-old American boy from New York City, whom the FBI arrests in a coffee shop.\nHowever, after agreeing to give Benjamin the witness exchange program, Hanne notices a wound going through his palm (the same wound that Max got after running a nail through his hand), and realizes that Max, Stephan and Paul are all made-up characters. Distraught, she visits Benjamin's doctor, who states that his mother had multiple personality disorder and committed suicide because of it, learning that it can be genetically inherited. Hanne connects various plot holes in Benjamin's story and realizes that \"he\" alone was CLAY; he committed all the atrocities, he hacked into the BND alone, and he planted the WWII bullets from his grandmother in the hotel to make it look like they were killed, imagining the trio due to his illness. Hanne confronts Benjamin, who has an emotional breakdown, as people with mental disorders cannot be given witness protection. However, Hanne changes her mind and allows him access to the witness protection program, revealed to be an \"actual\" program containing information about all citizens of Germany; Benjamin changes his identity here. Hanne, dropping Benjamin off, states that she let him go because he truly wants to stay invisible, and lets him go on the condition that he never hacks again.\nBenjamin, now sporting blonde hair, is standing alone on a  Scandlines ferry heading north. However, he is suddenly joined by Marie, Max, Stephan and Paul. In narration, Benjamin states that he performed \"the greatest social engineering hack\" ever; the scene shifts back to Benjamin going back to the hotel, finding the guys alive and well; he instructs them to flee since MRX knows his identity, but they refuse to leave him behind. After Marie visits them and confirms that mentally ill subjects cannot be granted witness protection, they devise a plan for Benjamin to go to Hanne and dictate the story, deliberately giving plot holes which she will most likely decipher, and then using her grief for him to give him access to the witness protection program, and also spiking his hand with a nail to make the story seem truthful. In the server room, it was revealed that Benjamin didn't change his identity, he \"erased\" it completely.

When their infant son is not allowed entry to the country without them, the family is forced to return to their ship named City of Justice. The parents break the display case containing a model of the ship and place their baby inside it on the water, then watch him float to the New York City shoreline. In 1916, the baby boy has grown up to become Peter Lake (Colin Farrell), a thief raised by a supernatural demon posing as the gangster Pearly Soames (Russell Crowe). Peter is marked for death when he decides to leave Pearly's gang. In a confrontation, he is rescued by a mysterious (winged at times) white horse, his guardian angel.\nAlthough Peter hopes to move to Florida and come back in the summer, the horse encourages him to steal from one last mansion. The mansion is the home where Beverly Penn (Jessica Brown Findlay) lives, a young woman dying of consumption, whose fever is so high she sleeps outside in a tent in the winter cold. While her publisher father Isaac (William Hurt) and younger sister Willa are not home, Beverly discovers Peter preparing to rob the house. When Peter assures her that he no longer wishes to commit robbery, Beverly offers to make him a cup of tea. They tell each other their stories and fall in love. Pearly orders his men to Beverly's home, believing that saving her is Peter's \"miracle\" and spiritual destiny and that he can destroy Peter by preventing it. Peter rescues Beverly from being knifed by Pearly, and they escape to the Lake of the Coheeries, where Pearly, who is supernaturally limited to the five boroughs of New York City, cannot follow. Peter meets Beverly's family at their summer home and wins their respect.\nWhile on a walk, Beverly explains to Peter that everyone is born with a miracle inside and they are ultimately destined to become stars when they die. Pearly asks Lucifer (Will Smith), for access to the lake home, but his request is denied. Instead, Pearly, who refers to himself as a Knight among Lucifer's angels, calls in a debt owed to him by another of Lucifer's angels. At a ball, the angel disguised as a waiter poisons Beverly's drink. When Peter and Beverly return home from the ball, Peter watches the shadows she casts upon the sides of her lighted tent, joins her, and the two make love. Her pulse races faster than ever due to the poison in her heart, and she dies.

While there, he meets Beverly's now elderly sister Willa (Eva Marie Saint), the owner of Virginia's newspaper, who recognizes him.\nWhen Peter visits the Gamelys for dinner, he learns that Abby has cancer. Realizing that Abby, who is wearing a red scarf (like his sketches) and has red hair, is his \"miracle\" and spiritual destiny, instead of Beverly as he originally believed, Peter convinces Virginia that he can save Abby. Pearly learns that Peter is still alive and with Virginia, and he is surprised to learn from Lucifer that Peter was Beverly's miracle, making him love her so much that he couldn't die.

Kanako, having been in love with Ogata, befriended the group in order to exact revenge. Even knowing about Kanako's intentions and lack of feelings for anyone or anything, Matsunaga had fallen in love with Kanako and helped her to steal the photos.

Xavier explains that the Sentinels were originally conceived by Bolivar Trask, a weapons designer whom Raven Darkh\u00f6lme assassinated in 1973. In response, government forces captured Raven and experimented on her, using her DNA to eventually create Sentinels capable of adapting to any mutant power.

Maya falls in love upon seeing Ronnie, who is recovering from his breakup with ex-girlfriend Priya (Shraddha Das), who moved to London.\nMaya phones her sister to reveal her feelings for Ronnie and steals a picture of Ronnie out of his photo-frame. She also happens to spot a picture of herself on his desktop, and this makes her think that he is likewise in love with her. This is not the case. It was only by chance that Ronnie had randomly snapped the picture during his ferry ride while traveling to the new place, before he had even met her. Ronnie is not in love with her, but he thinks she is strange and cute, so he plans a date-night at a nightclub. There, he bumps into Nancy (Seerat Kapoor), Priya's step-sister. Maya is upset when Ronnie and Nancy begin dancing together.\nOn their way back from the nightclub, Ronnie drives drunk and their SUV collides with a scooter driven by Nancy. Due to the impact, Nancy falls off the road and rolls down a slope. Ronnie panics and turns hysterical, while the cool and composed Maya, who is a trained nurse, rushes to save the girl. Maya announces that Nancy is dead, and persuades Ronnie to flee the scene so that the two of them can avoid getting caught.\nThe next morning, Nancy is found dead, the accident is all over the news, and the Goan cops are on the case. Ronnie, while all the time afraid that he might be caught, finds himself involved in the case in strange ways. For one thing, Priya comes back to India from London to hunt for Nancy's killers. Then again, as a journalist, Ronnie is ordered by Karan to go to the crash site and report on all aspects of the incident. He does as he is told, and during his work, he meets Inspector Moses (Denzil Smith), who suspects that Priya killed Nancy for her share of the family inheritance and that Ronnie is Priya's partner-in-crime. Meanwhile, Maya continues to protect Ronnie. Ronnie had told his boss that his SUV is in the garage (for repairs), but Maya dumps it in a lake so that no one can trace it. She even takes him to the spot and shows him the immersed SUV in the lake.\nInvestigations reveal that Nancy would have lived even after she was hit by the car, but someone had strangled her. Priya visits Ronnie at his outhouse and requests him to help her find the murderer. On her return trip, her brakes fail and she crashes, but is not hurt. Soon, Priya and Ronnie warm up to each other again. Ronnie even excuses himself from Maya's birthday dinner so that he can spend the night with Priya. Maya then finds out from Ronnie's office that he is not there but is with Priya. Maya stalks them and finds Ronnie and Priya having sex. Before sneaking out, an angry Maya feeds Ronnie's pet puppy Bobby to her pet alligator.\nPriya finds out that Ronnie had been at the same bar and that he had even met Nancy the night she was killed. She feels cheated and betrayed. Priya also becomes suspicious of Maya, lands up at the outhouse and starts accusing Maya of everything \u2013 including Nancy's murder. They get into a brawl. Maya calls Ronnie for help. Ronnie arrives but she attacks him on the head from behind and he suffers a black-out. Maya rushes to leave but finds Inspector Moses outside and kills him after he voices his suspicions that she is responsible for Nancy's death. Ronnie wakes up and discovers a cabin with pictures of Maya, himself, Nancy, Priya, Moses, and even Bobby on the walls, with red crosses on those who were dead. Maya reappears and reveals her role in the murders. She also tells him that she had previously killed her own sister by pushing her from the boat in a lake in a fit of jealousy.\nMaya then blindfolds Ronnie and takes him to the top of a lighthouse that she called Maya's Kingdom to exchange wedding vows with him. She tells him to make love to her and he obliges. All this while, Priya is dangling in mid-air on a suspended chair. Ronnie lights a cigarette and spills a glass of wine over it causing a fire to break out. Maya pulls the gun on him but Ronnie snatches the gun from her hand, which he could have done earlier too, and throws her off the lighthouse, leaving her dangling from the rod along with Priya. Ronnie manages to pull Priya on top of the lighthouse and saves her. After that they both try to save Maya, but she lets go and falls to her death into the deep waters.\nThe DSP is convinced by Ronnie's story and tells him that he will be out on bail. In return, the editor promises to use the paper's good relations with a government minister to stop the DSP's upcoming transfer.\nAfter the DSP and editor leaves, Ronnie starts laughing, and the film goes into a flashback where everything supposedly done by Maya is shown to have been done by Ronnie. It is revealed that it was Priya and Ronnie's plan to kill Nancy and get all property and put all blame on Maya, and that she truly loved him.", "tmdb_plot": "A journalist, who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, becomes the obsession of his landlord's daughter.", "tmdb_id": "310123", "wiki_id": "44235732"}, {"title": "Zodiac", "genres": ["Science Fiction", "TV Movie"], "wiki_plot": "When archaeologists unearth a 2,000-year-old astrology carving in a Peruvian lead mine, global cataclysms start to destroy the globe: explosive meteor storms, tsunamis, lightning storms, lava geysers and giant waterspouts erupt everywhere, each disaster corresponding to a specific sign of the zodiac.

Sam and Mary discuss whether to tell Jenn about their affair, but they are interrupted when beavers chew off Buck's foot and scratch Tommy.
