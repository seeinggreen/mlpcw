Following her to the church, he crashes into a police cruiser, is stung by a bee and nearly disrupts the wedding ceremony.\nLater that night, Sam and George argue over his treatment of women and his habit of spying on the intimate acts of a neighbor (which later turns out to be consensual).\nGeorge visits the reverend who performed the wedding and learns that the woman is Jenny Miles, daughter of a prominent Beverly Hills dentist.\nThe following day, while spying on his neighbor, George hits himself with the telescope and falls down an embankment, causing him to miss Sam's phone call. Still obsessed with Jenny, he schedules a dental appointment with her father and learns that Jenny and her husband David have gone to Mexico for their honeymoon. The effects of a comically implausible amount of treatment accompanied by a heavy dose of novocaine, aggravated by immediate heavy drinking, leave George completely incoherent. Sam finally reaches him on the phone, but mistakes him for an intruder and calls the police, who hold George at gunpoint while trying to understand his gibberish. George visits his neighbor's house to take part in an ongoing orgy, but Sam spots him through his telescope, widening the rift between them.\nGeorge impulsively boards a plane to follow the newlyweds to their exclusive resort in Mexico.

Wanting to destroy something \"honorable\" in Los Angeles, Mitamura decides to target Hollywood. Later that morning, a 10th Armored Division M3 Lee tank crew, consisting of Sergeant Frank Tree, Corporal Chuck Sitarski, and Privates Foley, Reese, and Henshaw, are having breakfast at a cafe where dishwasher Wally Stephens and his friend Dennis DeSoto work. Wally is planning to enter a dance contest at a club that evening with his girlfriend, Betty Douglas. Sitarski instantly dislikes Wally and trips him, causing a fight.\nIn Death Valley, United States Army Air Forces Captain Wild Bill Kelso lands his Curtiss P-40 Warhawk fighter at a roadside store and gas station, which he accidentally blows up. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Major General Joseph W. Stilwell attempts to calm the public, who believe Japan will attack California. During a press conference at Daugherty Field in Long Beach, Captain Loomis Birkhead, Stilwell's aide, meets his old flame Donna Stratton, who is General Stilwell's new secretary. Aware that Donna is sexually aroused by airplanes, Birkhead lures her into the cockpit of a B-17 bomber to seduce her. When his attempt fails, Donna punches him; as he falls, Birkhead accidentally releases a bomb, which rolls against the conference's grandstand and explodes, though Stilwell and the crowd escape unhurt.\nAt the Santa Monica oceanside home of her father Ward Douglas and his wife Joan, Betty and her friend Maxine Dexheimer, who have just become USO hostesses, tell Wally that they are only allowed to dance with servicemen as they are now the only male patrons allowed in the club. Wally hides in the garage when Ward, who disapproves of him, appears. Sgt. Tree and his crew arrive and inform Ward and Joan that the army wants to install an anti-aircraft battery in their yard. Sitarski begins flirting with Betty, and Wally falls from the loft where he was hiding. Wally and Sitarski recognize each other from the cafe, and the tankers dump Wally into a passing garbage truck.\nMeanwhile, the Japanese submarine has become lost trying to find Los Angeles after their compass malfunctions. A landing party goes ashore and captures lumberjack Hollis \"Holly\" Wood. Aboard the sub, Hollis is searched and the crew is excited to find a small toy compass, which Hollis swallows. After the crew attempts to make Hollis excrete the compass by forcing him to drink prune juice, he escapes from the submarine.\nWard's neighbor, Angelo Scioli of the Ground Observer Corps, installs Claude and Herb in the Ferris wheel at the Ocean Front Amusement Park to scout for enemy aircraft. Determined to get Donna into an airplane, Birkhead drives her to the 501st Bomb Disbursement Unit in Barstow, where the mentally unstable Colonel \"Mad Man\" Maddox lets them borrow a plane. Donna, aroused from finally being in an airplane, begins to ravish Birkhead during the flight.\nAt the USO club, Sitarski drags Betty into the dance. Wally sneaks in and reunites with Betty. They win the dance contest, and Sitarski punches Wally, setting off a brawl between soldiers, sailors and zoot suiters which spills into the street and becomes a riot. Sgt. Tree and his crew break up the melee, just before L.A. goes on high alert when Birkhead and Donna fly over the city and anti-aircraft batteries open fire on them. Kelso pursues and shoots it down, causing it to land into the La Brea Tar Pits. Claude and Herb shoot down the passing P-40 after mistaking it for a Japanese Zero; Kelso crashlands in the city, where he informs the military authorities about the Japanese sub he spotted at the pier. Wally is put in command of the tank after Tree is accidentally incapacitated, and rescues Betty while Sitarski is accosting her.

The sub returns fire, hitting the Ferris wheel, which rolls into the ocean. When von Kleinschmidt tries to force the sub to retreat early, Mitamura throws him overboard. The tank arrives and then sinks when the submarine torpedoes the pier. Kelso jumps off the pier and swims to the submarine, where he is captured by the Japanese.\nThe next morning, Stilwell and soldiers arrive at the remains of the Douglas home, where the other protagonists have gathered. Ward vows that their Christmas will not be ruined by the enemy; to symbolize his point, he nails a Christmas wreath to his front door, causing his unstable house to collapse down the hillside.

Lambert, realizing that the alien intends to kill the crew one by one, implores the others to abandon ship and escape in its small shuttle, but Ripley, now in command, explains it will not support four people and insists on continuing Dallas' plan of flushing out the alien.\nAccessing Mother, Ripley discovers the company has secretly ordered Ash to return the alien, with the crew considered expendable. She confronts Ash, who tries to choke her to death. Parker intervenes and clubs Ash, knocking his head loose and revealing him as an android. He, Ripley, and Lambert reactivate Ash's head, and they learn that he was assigned to ensure the creature's survival.

Ripley cuts off his power and Parker incinerates him.\nThe remaining crew decides to self-destruct the Nostromo and escape in the shuttle. However, Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the creature while gathering life-support supplies. Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence but finds the alien blocking her path to the shuttle. She retreats and attempts unsuccessfully to abort the self-destruct. With no further options, she flees to the shuttle, carrying Jones, and narrowly escapes as the Nostromo explodes.\nAs Ripley prepares for stasis, she discovers that the alien is aboard, having wedged itself into a narrow space. She dons a spacesuit and uses gas to flush the creature out. It approaches Ripley, but before it can attack, she opens an airlock door, almost blasting it into space. However, it hangs on by gripping the frame. Ripley shoots it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches as the airlock door closes, tethering the alien to the shuttle. It pulls itself into an engine exhaust, but Ripley fires the engines, blasting it away into deep space.

After surviving training camp under the brutal Corporal Himmelstoss, the young men board a troop train bound for the front line. Ominously, at the same moment, they notice another train arriving in town loaded with returning wounded soldiers, who are carried off on stretchers.\nOnce at the front line, they are placed in a squad, along with soldiers Tjaden, Westhus, Detering and others, under the supervision of Stanislaus \"Kat\" Katzinsky. Kat teaches them how to take cover, how to find extra food, and other survival skills.\nWhen Paul and his squad return to a French town for a rest week, they see the new recruits have grown younger and younger. To their delight, the leader of these new recruits is their recently demoted training NCO, Himmelstoss. When Himmelstoss tries to make them obey him, they stand up to him. Later in the trenches, while the Germans are launching an attack, Paul sees another squad cowering in a crater, which includes Himmelstoss.

He is an alcoholic, a driven workaholic who chain-smokes cigarettes, and a womanizer who constantly flirts and has sex with a stream of women. Each morning he starts his day by playing a tape of Vivaldi while taking doses of Visine, Alka-Seltzer, and Dexedrine, always finishing by looking at himself in the mirror and telling himself \"It's showtime, folks!\" Joe's ex-wife, Audrey Paris, is involved with the production of the show, but disapproves of his womanizing ways. Meanwhile, his girlfriend Katie Jagger and daughter Michelle keep him company. In his imagination, he flirts with an angel of death called Angelique in a nightclub setting, chatting with her about his life.\nAs Joe continues to be dissatisfied with his editing job, repeatedly making minor changes to a single monologue, he takes his anger out on the dancers and in his choreography, putting on a highly sexualized number with topless women during one rehearsal and frustrating both Audrey and the show's penny-pinching backers. The only moment of joy in his life occurs when Katie and Michelle perform a Fosse-style number for Joe as an homage to the upcoming release of The Stand-Up, moving him to tears. During a particularly stressful table-read of NY/LA, Joe experiences severe chest pains and is admitted to the hospital with severe angina. Joe brushes off his symptoms, and attempts to leave to go back to rehearsal, but he collapses in the doctor's office and is ordered to stay in the hospital for several weeks to rest his heart and recover from his exhaustion. NY/LA is postponed, but Gideon continues his antics from the hospital bed, continuing to smoke and drink while having endless strings of women come through his room; as he does, his condition continues to deteriorate, despite Audrey and Katie both remaining by his side for support. A negative review for The Stand-Up \u2014 which has been released during Joe's time in the hospital \u2014 comes in despite the film's monetary success, and Gideon has a massive coronary event.\nAs Joe undergoes coronary artery bypass surgery, the producers of NY/LA realize that the best way to recoup their money and make a profit is to bet on Gideon's dying: the insurance proceeds would result in a profit of over half a million dollars. As Gideon goes on life support, he directs extravagant musical dream sequences in his own head starring his daughter, wife, and girlfriend, who all berate him for his behavior; he realizes he cannot avoid his own death, and has another heart attack. As the doctors try to save him, Joe runs away from his hospital bed behind their backs and explores the basement of the hospital and the autopsy ward before he allows himself to be taken back. He goes through the five stages of grief \u2014 anger, denial, bargaining, depression and acceptance \u2014 featured in the stand-up routine he had been editing, and as he gets closer to death, his dream sequences become more and more hallucinatory. As the doctors try one more time to save him, Joe imagines a monumental variety show featuring everyone from his past where he takes center stage in an extensive musical number (\"Bye Bye Life\", a whimsical parody of \"Bye Bye Love\"). In his dying dream, Joe is able to thank his family and acquaintances as he cannot from his hospital bed, and his performance receives a massive standing ovation.

Passing by a TV shop, he sees himself captured by a video camera in the shop window. Entranced, he steps backward off the sidewalk and is struck by a chauffeured limousine owned by elderly business mogul Ben Rand. In the car is Rand's glamorous and much younger wife Eve, who mishears \"Chance, the gardener\" in reply to the question who he is, as \"Chauncey Gardiner\".\nEve brings Chance to their palatial estate to recover. He is wearing expensive tailored but outmoded clothes from the 1920s and 1930s, which his benefactor had allowed him to take from the attic, and his manners are old-fashioned and courtly. When Ben Rand meets him, he takes \"Chauncey\" for an upper-class, highly educated businessman who has fallen on hard times. Rand admires him, finding him direct, wise and insightful.\nRand is also a confidant and advisor to the President of the United States, whom he introduces to \"Chauncey\". In a discussion about the economy, Chance takes his cue from the words \"stimulate growth\" and talks about the changing seasons of the garden. The President misinterprets this as optimistic political advice and quotes \"Chauncey Gardiner\" in a speech. Chance now rises to national prominence, attends important events, develops a close connection with the Soviet ambassador, and appears on a television talk show during which his detailed advice about what a serious gardener should do is misunderstood as his opinion on what would be his presidential policy.\nThough he has now risen to the pinnacle of Washington society, the Secret Service and some 16 other agencies are unable to find any background information on him. During this time Rand's personal physician, Dr. Allenby, becomes increasingly suspicious that Chance is not a wise political expert and that the mystery of his identity may have a more mundane explanation. Dr. Allenby considers telling Rand this, but remains silent when he realizes how happy Chance is making him in his final days.\nThe dying Rand encourages Eve to become close to \"Chauncey\". She is already attracted to him and makes a sexual advance. Chance has no interest in or knowledge of sex, but mimics a kissing scene from the 1968 film The Thomas Crown Affair, which happens to be showing on the TV. When the scene ends, Chauncey stops suddenly and Eve is confused. She asks what he likes, meaning sexually; he replies \"I like to watch,\" meaning television. She is momentarily taken aback, but decides she is willing to masturbate for his voyeuristic pleasure, thereby not noticing that he has turned back to the TV and is now imitating a yoga exercise on a different channel.\nChance is present at Rand's death and shows genuine sadness at his passing. Questioned by Dr. Allenby, he admits that he \"loves Eve very much\" and also that he is just a gardener. When he leaves to inform Eve of Ben's death, Allenby says to himself, \"I understand,\" but interpretation of that is left to the viewer.\nWhile the President delivers a speech at Rand's funeral, the pallbearers hold a whispered discussion over potential replacements for the President in the next term of office and unanimously agree on Chauncey Gardiner as successor.

She forces herself on him in numerous sexual positions. After a while, she lets Lamar have anal sex with her and gives in when a suddenly enthusiastic Lamar stops her from continuing into other positions.

A fight ensues and Lavonia helps Lamar by burning the truck driver's scrotum with a light bulb.\nLamar takes Lavonia and himself into dentist/marriage counselor Asa Lavender (Robert Pearson). After the dentist takes Lavonia to the dental room, his nurse Flovilla kisses Lamar. As the dentist hurts Lavonia's teeth and she counters by grabbing his crotch painfully, Lamar rapes the nurse. The doctor then switches places with the nurse. When seeing Lamar still has his pants down, the doctor tries to rape him, but Lamar hides in the closet. While the nurse and Lavonia have sex using the nurse's double-ended dildo, the doctor uses various weapons to force Lamar out of the closet. Lamar eventually beats the doctor up and interrupts Lavonia and the nurse. An arrangement of Stranger in Paradise is played in the background throughout the dentist scene.\nLamar decides his cure lies in faith. After dropping him off at the radio station (a power station), Lavonia goes home and has sex once again with the truck driver. Lamar takes his pants off in front of Eufaula Roop's booth and reveals an erection. She immediately goes off the air. When Lamar tells her he wants to be saved, she sends him to her cleansing room (a bathroom) while she changes clothes.

Wanting to protect his patient, Raglan begins to intensify the sessions with Nola to resolve the issue quickly. During the therapy sessions, he discovers that Nola was physically and verbally abused by her self-pitying alcoholic mother while neglected by her co-dependent alcoholic father, who refused to protect Nola out of shame and denial.\nMeanwhile, Frank, intending to invalidate Raglan's methods, questions Jan Hartog, a former Somafree Institute patient who is dying of psychoplasmic-induced lymphoma. Frank leaves Candice with her maternal grandmother, Juliana, and the two spend the evening viewing old photographs. Juliana tells Candice that Nola was frequently hospitalized as a child and often exhibited strange unexplained wheals on her skin that doctors were unable to diagnose.

When Candice returns to school, two dwarf-children attack and kill Ruth in front of her class before absconding with Candice to the Somafree Institute, with Frank in pursuit. Upon arriving at the institute, Raglan tells Frank the truth about the dwarf-children: they are the accidental product of Nola's psychoplasmic sessions; her rage about her abuse was so strong that she parthenogenetically bore a brood of creatures resembling children who psychically respond and act on the targets of her rage, with Nola completely unaware of their actions. Realizing the brood are too dangerous to keep anymore, Raglan plans to venture into their quarters and rescue Candice, provided that Frank can keep Nola calm to avoid provoking the children.\nFrank attempts a feigned rapprochement long enough for Raglan to collect Candice, but when he witnesses Nola give birth to another child through a psychoplasmically-induced external womb, she notices his disgust when she licks the child clean. The brood awakens and kills Raglan. Nola then threatens to kill Candice rather than lose her. The brood goes after Candice who hides in a closet, but the brood begins to break through the door and tries to grab her.

After losing multiple times, the truck driver tells Lorde Cigano that he has come from Altamira, which he describes as a new El Dorado, a place of riches where no one can spend their money.\nDriving into a small town, they learn from another traveling performer who screens films that the town has not received rain in over two years. The traveling performer tells the group that the community has no money, and that they pay to watch his films with food, drink, and other odd possessions. As the sun sets, Ci\u00e7o enters Salom\u00e9's tent with lust in his eyes. Salom\u00e9 proceeds to put on her record player and the two make love. Dasd\u00f4 is aware of the whole encounter, and while she is clearly not pleased with Ci\u00e7o, she doesn't seem very upset either. Lorde Cigano then decides to take the group to Altamira.\nOn the drive, Dasd\u00f4 gives birth. As the group navigates through dense jungle with a long, straight dirt road, the camera focuses on a dead armadillo on the side of the roadway. The armadillo, in combination with dying trees in the backdrop, give the viewer a sense that the jungle is slowly dying due to the white man's presence.\nThe Caravana Rolidei finds a group of Indians who ask for a ride to Altamira. They cannot make a living in the jungle anymore because of the white men bringing change and death. Lorde Cigano agrees to take them for a price. Upon arriving at Altamira, they find that the city is actually highly developed and is not rural like they previously believed. Attempting to earn money, Lorde Cigano has Swallow wrestle another strongman, betting the troupe's truck. Losing the bet and their mode of transportation, Lorde Cigano asks Salom\u00e9 to temporarily go to work as a prostitute, to get them out of this jam.\nThat night, Swallow leaves the group, and Lorde Cigano has sex with Dasd\u00f4. The next morning, Salom\u00e9 comes back with money from working as a prostitute. Lorde Cigano splits the money, and tells Ci\u00e7o to leave with his wife. Ci\u00e7o refuses to leave, after which Lorde Cigano explicitly tells him they are going to a whorehouse. Ci\u00e7o volunteers Dasd\u00f4 to work in the whorehouse without so much as asking her, and Lorde Cigano tells him he will have to tell his wife.\nUpon arriving in the next town and ending up at a bar, a man tries to go out with Dasd\u00f4. Ci\u00e7o stops him, and pushes him away. Salom\u00e9 ends up going and having sex with the man, and Ci\u00e7o states that he will take the bus to Bras\u00edlia with Dasd\u00f4. The next morning however, he is outside Lorde Cigano and Salom\u00e9's hotel room. He states that he won't go to Bras\u00edlia, and confesses his eternal love for Salom\u00e9.\nLorde Cigano, however, finally loses his patience with Ci\u00e7o, and punches him multiple times, knocking him out, and wheels him out and onto the bus. Ci\u00e7o and Dasd\u00f4 end up taking the bus down to a small home in Bras\u00edlia.\nSome time later, we see Ci\u00e7o and Dasd\u00f4 performing onstage in a small club with a band. Ci\u00e7o hears the sound of a loudspeaker, and goes outside to see a much more modern truck with neon lights, the new \"Caravana Rolidey\", driven by Salom\u00e9 with Lorde Cigano in the passenger seat. Lorde Cigano asks Ci\u00e7o and Dasd\u00f4 to rejoin them, and tells him that they are going inland to bring civilization, telling them that the innermost area has never seen anything like them.

Shortly afterward, one of the heads of the Praetorian Guard, Naevius Sutorius Macro, tells Caligula that Tiberius demands his immediate presence at Capri, where the Emperor lives with his close friend Nerva, dim-witted relative Claudius, and Caligula's adopted son (Tiberius's grandson) Gemellus. Fearing assassination, Caligula is afraid to leave but his sister and lover Drusilla persuades him to go.\nAt Capri, Caligula finds that Tiberius has become depraved, showing signs of advanced venereal diseases, and embittered with Rome and politics. Tiberius enjoys swimming with naked youths and watching degrading sex shows that include deformed people and animals. Caligula observes with fascination and horror. Tensions rise when Tiberius tries to poison Caligula in front of Gemellus. Nerva commits suicide and Caligula tries to kill Tiberius but loses his nerve. Proving his loyalty to Caligula, Macro kills Tiberius instead with Gemellus as a witness.\nAfter Tiberius' death and burial, Caligula is proclaimed the new Emperor, then proclaims Drusilla as his equal, to the apparent disgust of the Roman Senate. Drusilla, fearful of Macro's influence, persuades Caligula to get rid of him. Caligula sets up a mock trial in which Gemellus is intimidated into testifying that Macro murdered Tiberius, then has Macro's wife Ennia banished from Rome. After Macro is executed in a gruesome public game, Caligula appoints Tiberius' former adviser Longinus as his personal assistant while pronouncing the docile Senator Chaerea as the new head of the Praetorian Guard.\nDrusilla tries to find Caligula a wife among the priestesses of the goddess Isis, the cult they secretly practice. Caligula wants to marry Drusilla, but she insists they cannot marry because she is his sister. Instead, Caligula marries Caesonia, a priestess and notorious courtesan, after she bears him an heir. Drusilla reluctantly supports their marriage. Meanwhile, despite Caligula's popularity with the masses, the Senate expresses disapproval for what initially seem to be light eccentricities. Darker aspects of Caligula's personality emerge when he rapes a bride and groom on their wedding day in a minor fit of jealousy and orders Gemellus's execution to provoke a reaction from Drusilla.\nAfter discovering that Caesonia is pregnant, Caligula develops a severe fever. Drusilla nurses him back to health. Just as he fully recovers, Caesonia bears him a daughter, Julia Drusilla. During the celebration, Drusilla collapses with the same fever he had had. Soon afterward, Caligula receives another ill omen in the form of a blackbird.  Despite his praying to Isis out of desperation, Drusilla dies from her fever. Initially unable to accept her death, Caligula has a nervous breakdown and rampages through the palace, destroying a statue of Isis while clutching Drusilla's body.\nNow in a deep depression, Caligula walks the Roman streets disguised as a beggar; he causes a disturbance after watching an amateur performance mocking his relationship with Drusilla. After a brief stay in a city gaol, Caligula proclaims himself a god and becomes determined to destroy the senatorial class, which he has come to loathe.

Because of Cutherbertson's not following established British Intelligence guidelines and Charlie's proving that his interrogation was actually a success, Charlie escapes demotion and goes on leave, which he spends with his wife Edith (Linden), while at the same time maintaining an affair with Cuthbertson's secretary-receptionist.\nNext, the story unfolds around British and American attempts to facilitate a safe defection of high-ranking Soviet General Valery Kalenin (Braun).

Charlie meets with Kalenin in Moscow without the CIA finding out, and Ruttgers' aide Braley (Rimmer), a good-hearted but docile sideshow official, is assigned to accompany Muffin first to casinos in various cities in order to \"launder\" the $500,000 Kalenin is demanding as the price of his defection and later to Prague to liaise with Kalenin on the final details.

Another operator notices a second gauge indicating low water levels. Godell taps the first gauge, which immediately unsticks and drops to indicate very low levels. The crew urgently pumps water back in and celebrates in relief at bringing the reactor back under control.Adams has surreptitiously filmed the incident, despite being asked not to film for security reasons. Wells' superior refuses her report of what happened. Adams steals the footage and shows it to experts who conclude that the plant came perilously close to meltdown \u2013 the China syndrome.\nDuring an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. He pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent wants nothing standing in the way of the restart.\nGodell finds that a series of radiographs supposedly verifying the welds on the leaking pump are identical \u2013 the contractor simply kept resubmitting the same picture. He brings the evidence to the plant manager, who brushes him off as paranoid, stating that new radiographs would cost $20 million.

On one typically hot summer day, Herman Stover, a dangerously disturbed employee at the refinery, has been denied an expected promotion and in addition, finds himself fired after refusing a departmental transfer. He then decides to take his revenge against the works by opening the valves to the storage vats and their interconnecting pipes, flooding the area and sewers with gasoline and chemicals. It doesn't take long for this act of petty vandalism to start a fire, which starts a chain reaction that causes massive explosions at the refinery, destroying it and spreading a mushroom-cloud of flame that soon engulfs the entire metropolis. The drama focuses on a newly built hospital which, like the refinery and all civic buildings that went up during the mayor's crooked administration, is shoddily built and poorly equipped. There, head doctor Frank Whitman and his staff treat thousands of casualties from the fire while the city fire chief Risley keeps in constant contact with the fire companies fighting a losing battle against the fires, and Maggie Grayson, an alcoholic reporter, sees it as her chance to make it nationwide with her coverage of the story of the \"city on fire\".\nA major subplot of the film involves Diana Brockhurst-Lautrec, a wealthy socialite (and widow of the late governor who is the namesake of the hospital) who is currently and secretly involved with Mayor Dudley to further advance her rank up the social circles. The womanizing Dr. Whitman also meets with Diana before the hospital's dedication ceremony, having known her previously. Herman Stover also arrives at the hospital during the dedication ceremony, having left the refinery before the explosion to stalk Diana, and having known her since attending high school. Diana finds herself, along with the mayor, assisting Dr. Whitman & head nurse Andrea Harper with treating the large number of casualties arriving at the hospital. No one ever finds out that Stover is the one responsible for the citywide fire, and Stover is not sane enough to understand or regret his actions.\nWhen the hospital becomes surrounded by the fire, Chief Risley orders his son, Capt. Harrison Risley and his firemen to create a \"water tunnel\" composed creating a channel of firehoses across a burning street to evacuate the hospital. Despite some casualties of the hospital staff and patients, the evacuation is successful. Stover is one of the casualties when, distraught and in a daze after Diana rejects him, is killed by falling debris from a building. Nurse Harper is also killed when she attempts to rescue Stover. Diana, Mayor Dudley, and Dr. Whitman are the last ones to make it out of the hospital before it is consumed by the fire.\nThe final scene is set the following day at a quarry outside the city which is set up as a makeshift camp for the thousands of people rendered homeless by the fire as it is finally brought under control. There, Dr. Whitman and Diana acknowledge their love for each other, while Mayor Dudley gives a press statement that the real heroes are the people of the city.

The only survivor is a Jean Beneyton (Mimsy Farmer), a French hostess on the flight. Two fishermen find her, but then are soon killed off by a group of suited corporate agents who ride out in a speedboat, because they were witnesses to the crash.\nIn New York City, an American investigative reporter, Moses Brody (James Franciscus), receives a phone call from his ex-wife Nicole (Mag Fleming), who runs a local restaurant in Martinique, who tells him about an \"important story\". But upon arrival in Martinique, Brody learns that Nicole has died from an apparent \"heart attack\". Brody is devastated. Later that evening, while wandering the streets of the town, Brody is attacked by a gang of thugs, but is rescued by a mysterious local man named George, who owns a fishing trawler and tells him that Nicole was a friend of his and she was killed because she knew that the crashed Concorde flight landed on a reef nearby and the two of them decide to investigate.\nMeanwhile, a shady businessman named Milland (Joseph Cotten) and his business partner Danker (Edmund Purdom) learn about the Concorde crash and after consulting with their associate, Martinez, plot to cover up any evidence involved with the crash. It becomes apparent that Milland and Danker are behind the events.\nBrody and George are in a boat when they see Jean Beneyton jump off of the henchmen's boat and attempts to swim away before she is recaptured. Later, they arrive at the crash site and after donning scuba gear they find the wreck of the Concorde submerged under 100 feet of water in the Caribbean. While Brody goes inside the wreck, George gets his arm stuck in a jagged part of machinery and Brody has to amputate George's left arm to free him. Moses discovers explosive charges on the downed plane which were planted earlier by Milland's henchmen to destroy any evidence of foul play.\nUpon surfacing, George gets hit in the goggles by a bullet as several henchmen in a speedboat appear and attack. Brody is forced to go back down under the water with two scuba men in chase. Brody outwits them by hiding in an underwater cave in which he goes back to the surface and pulls out the henchman who remained behind in the speedboard and steals it.\nBrody then goes to the United States Consul of Martinique, and wants to start an investigation. He then takes them to the site and finds nothing. They call off the search for the missing Concorde. Brody then says that he saw Jean on a yacht. The Consul then says that if he knew it was Brody, he would have gotten him off the case as Brody was reporting a scandal concerning a Congressman.\nMeanwhile, Milland and his men watch a video as the submerged Concorde explodes. They then find out that Jean is alive and being held for a $1 million ransom. At the same time, another L.P.A. Concorde plane lands in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil which prepares itself for a flight from Venezuela to London.\nThat evening, Brody sneaks on board the henchmen's boat, where he overhears them saying that they want to get rid of Jean and also overhears them talking about their superiors taking down a second Concorde flight. Brody rescues her and they escape from the boat. After reaching the shore, Brody tries talking to Jean about the crash, but she is so shaken by the traumatic experience that she can't remember very much. In the morning, they hitch a ride on a banana truck driven by a local farmer. But soon Milland's henchmen, led by Forsythe (Venantino Venantini) find Brody and Jean again and give chase, but they are cut off by a construction vehicle.\nOn board the airborne second Concorde, L.P.A. Flight 128, a crew member turns on one of the inboard engines on the plane. Up in the cockpit, the pilot Captain Scott (Van Johnson) discovers something which same thing happened as with the first attack: loss of power. This is because a henchman puts vials of acid in the food of the flight which breaks upon being heated up and acid breaks through the microwave ovens and severs the electrical lines in the cabin.\nIn Martinique, Brody calls the Consul and has Jean begin to tell her story about it, but they are cut off as the henchmen are back. As the Consul calls up his associates in London with his ideas to what might be happening, the chase continues. The Concorde then loses radio contact with London control, and the cabin lights begin to flicker. Captain Scott soon regains contact with London, who suggests they run a circuit control. The London air traffic controller (Robert Kerman) also gets a call from Jean. The controller then reports they can't reach the Concorde. On board the plane, the navigator (Roberto Santi) then reports that pressure in the main cabin is dropping.\nOn the ground, Jean contacts the American Consul at a bank, but Forsythe and his henchmen arrive again, and she and Brody have to run. This time, the police are there and enter a shootout with the men in which all of the henchmen are killed.\nMeanwhile, London Air Traffic Control gets radio contact with the Concorde on a VHF frequence. Captain Scott on the Concorde then descends the aircraft to a lower altitude below 12,000 feet, but London now can't get Concorde on the VHF frequency, either. Brody and Jean reach the American Consul and she begins describing what happened.\nThe Concorde banks and the number one engine overheats. London control reports that the crash began with overheating of the oven. The crew discovers the number one engine is now on fire, and they quickly extinguish it. The Concorde continues its descent, as one passenger becomes hysterical.\nThe plane then levels out at 9,000 feet. London control can now see them on radar, and proceed to clear a runway. Concorde then makes a beautiful landing. Brody is relieved.\nThe next day, Milland contacts Brody by phone where he wants to offer him a shady contract after reading the headline \"Concorde Passengers Saved by Journalist\". Jean thinks that he'll get a big welcome in New York. Brody jokingly states that he doesn't have to go, and they laugh. He says he has to pay a visit \"to a certain bigshot\". Jean then gets on an Air France flight to return to Paris, but before she leaves he says he'll give her a call.\nBrody then calls his friend Alfie and says that he wants to \"push a certain Humpty Dumpty off his wall\".

A man named Carl Parker shows up to Maggie with a claim about documentation of illegal arms deals, but is shot by an assailant who chases Maggie throughout the house before a passerby triggers a fire alarm, scaring the assailant away.\nMaggie is told by Harrison someone is framing him.

Paul Metrand board the Concorde, where they are joined by Peter O'Neill, the 2nd officer and flight engineer.\nHarrison surprises Maggie at the airline check-in desk to see her off. He asks whether the documents have shown up, but they have not. As he is walking away, Parker's wife delivers the documents to Maggie as she steps into the mobile lounge. She looks them over and realizes that Harrison has lied to her.\nThe Concorde takes off for Paris. Unbeknownst to the flight crew, an off-course surface-to-air missile is headed straight for them. At his company headquarters, Harrison tells his controllers to alert the government. The USAF scrambles F-15 fighter jets to intercept the missile as it locks onto the Concorde. After several evasive maneuvers by the passenger plane, an F-15 shoots down the missile.\nAs the Concorde is approaching the European coastline, an F-4 Phantom II sent by Harrison engages the Concorde as French Air Force Mirage F1s scramble to help. The Concorde evades the F-4's missiles, but the explosion of one of them damages the plane's hydraulics. The Mirages shoot down the F-4 before the Concorde reaches the French coastline to continue towards Paris.  Due to hydraulic system damage, the plane lands at Le Bourget Airport instead of Charles de Gaulle.  The Concorde barely stops at the last safety net. Metrand and Isabelle invite Patroni to dinner.\nHarrison promises Maggie to go public with the documents but attempts to bribe her into \"polishing\" his statement. After being paid by Harrison, a mechanic, Froelich, places a device in the Concorde's cargo door control unit, timed to open during flight.\nAs the passengers board, Froelich is in line at the security checkpoint when some of his money falls out of his trouser leg. The X-ray technician attempts to return it, but Froelich pretends not to hear and runs off. On the runway, where the Concorde is taking off, the aircraft's exhaust renders Froelich unconscious and scatters the money he received from Harrison.\nEn route to Moscow, the automatic device opens the cargo door. Metrand sees the carpet tear down the middle of the aisle, signifying the fuselage is under tremendous stress and the aircraft is about to break apart. The cargo door is ripped off, damaging the aircraft and ripping a segment of the floor as it spirals towards the ground. The airline founder's seat lodges in the hole, acting as a plug. The pilots attempt to fly to Innsbruck, Austria, for an emergency landing, but they are losing too much fuel and do not have enough to make it there. Metrand realizes they are flying towards a ski area he knows along the Alps in Patscherkofel; they could make a belly landing on a mountain-side.\nThe aircraft approaches the landing site while the ski patrol marks a runway, landing successfully. While passengers are being rescued, Maggie reports on the accident to a news reporter and mentions a major story she is about to release.

Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker, Lucy's fianc\u00e9.\nLater that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood.

He begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have.

Felix is interested in painting while Eugenia, sophisticated and alluring, is a baroness as the morganatic wife of a minor German prince.\nOn his arrival at the Wentworths' state, Felix first meets Gertrude, the nonconformist Wentworths daughter, who is shirking attendance at church and reading romantic literature instead. After introducing himself, he stays over for dinner while she is soon intrigued and enchanted by her cousin. The next day Eugenia pays them a visit and meets not only the four Wentworths but also Robert Acton and his sister Lizzie who are the Wentworths' cousins by another side of their family. Eugenia drops backhanded compliments to the befuddled silence of the modest, upright Wentworths. Robert and his sister are more cautious and suspicious of Eugenias's intentions. After Felix and Eugenia have left, the family debates what to do. Since they are relatives, Mr. Wentworth puts them up in a neighboring cottage on his property.

During a ball at the Acton's house, Eugenia is introduced to Robert's ailing mother who she manages to charm. At the ball, Clifford has too much to drink and when Mr. Wentworth complains about it to Felix, he suggests that his sister influence might help the wayward youngster to improve his behaviour, and indeed, Clifford begins visiting Eugenia. Meanwhile, Felix and Gertrude are falling in love. Gertrude tells him her father wants her to marry the Unitarian minister, Mr. Brand, though she doesn't love him. Felix, noticing how Gertrude's pliable sister, Charlotte, seems attracted to the minister speaks to Mr. Brand, implying as much redirecting his feelings away from Gertrude and towards Charlotte instead. One evening, Robert Acton who has been away a few days (and is beginning to believe he is in love with Eugenia even though for him love is an overrated feeling) goes late to visit her. Clifford was with Eugenia at the time and she makes him hide in a back room. When Clifford comes unexpectedly out of his hiding place, there is a very awkward moment. Clifford leaves and Eugenia lies about why the young man was at her home.

As they head to the airport the following day, the road is blocked by Barresi's men, where Berni commands Paola to speed through their barrier. From here, Berni and Scalia take a plane to New York.\nAccording to plan Scalia and Berni take refuge in a hotel the evening before they plan to testify against Barresi. After realizing that the man guarding the door is missing, Berni must take Scalia somewhere else to hide. He takes him to Joe's Restaurant and Pizzeria, where the head of the restaurant, Luigi, allows them to hide in his apartment upstairs. Meanwhile, two of Barresi's men enter the restaurant aiming to murder Berni and Scalia. However, a group of robbers enter immediately after, prompting Barresi's men to engage in shootout with the robbers, then flee the scene. Berni and Scalia exit Joe's Restaurant to track down the two men who left the restaurant, but are instead ambushed by a street gang. Police arrive to the scene of the ambush, where they arrest Berni and Scalia after receiving a report of two dangerous men, one armed, in the area. They do not initially believe that Berni is an Italian police officer. After Berni convinces them to take him to Lieutenant Sturges, who is sitting on the court case of Barresi, Berni and Scalia are free to begin their testimony against Barresi. When Scalia takes the stand to testify against Barresi, however, he claims that he does not know the man and has never seen him in his life, causing the judge to order Barresi to be set free.\nOutside the court house, Scalia is shot dead by a gunman on the roof, revealed to be a clerk working at the hotel in which Berni and Scalia stayed when they first arrived in New York. The film ends with Berni searching Scalia's jacket pockets and finding a note stating that, if he were to die, let it be known that the man who goes by Vito Ferrando is actually Michele Barresi, providing Berni with the evidence he needs to bring Barresi down.", "tmdb_id": 105837}, "33933454": {"title": "From Hell to Victory", "plot": "On August 24, 1939, six friends take drinks in a suburb of Paris; Americans Brett Rosson and Ray MacDonald, the French Maurice Bernard and Fabienne Bodin, German J\u00fcrgen Dietrich, and Englishman Dick Sanders. Despite the looming threat of war, the six resolve to meet again annually at this same location. Eight days later, Germany invades Poland, and the six are forced to go their separate ways.\nIn the spring of 1940, Germany conquers France. Dick and Maurice narrowly survive the evacuation of Dunkirk, whereupon Maurice promptly joins the Free French Forces while Dick is assigned to a new Royal Air Force (RAF) unit. Fabienne has joined a French resistance cell, Ray is embedded in the RAF command as a war correspondent, and J\u00fcrgen is an officer in the German occupation force. Brett\u2019s estranged son Jim enlists in the United States Army, intent on becoming a commando. Brett, an agent with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), is initially ambivalent about Jim\u2019s decision, but eventually decides to put in his requested recommendation, hoping it will help them reconnect. Maurice and Ray briefly reunite in London, where Ray is living with his daughter Mary, a Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) officer, and the two wonder where the rest of their group is, and whether they\u2019ll ever be able to reunite.\nJ\u00fcrgen and Fabienne eventually meet when he saves her from arrest by the Gestapo. The two make love, but Fabienne maintains that the two cannot be together because their countries are enemies, much to J\u00fcrgen\u2019s disappointment. Meanwhile, Jim is dispatched with his unit behind enemy lines to sabotage German supply lines, a mission that leads to his meeting Maurice. The operation is successful, but the rest of the unit is killed in the process, and Jim and Maurice are forced into hiding with local French partisans.\nThey are smuggled to the ch\u00e2teau of Nicole Levin, an old flame of Brett\u2019s and partisan sympathizer. Nicole hopes she and Brett might meet again, but her hopes are cut short when Waffen SS troops arrive to arrest Nicole on suspicion of her guerrilla activities. Nicole gives Jim his father\u2019s old cigarette case and asks him to speak to Brett for her. As Maurice and Jim hide in the cellar, Nicole is killed along with her servants when they try to intervene. Meanwhile in the skies above London, Dick is shot down and killed defending the city from the Blitz, only hours after briefly reuniting with Brett. Brett receives his cigarette case along with a letter from Jim, who expresses a desire to spend more time with him once the war is over.\nIn the lead-up to the D-Day invasion of June 6, 1944,, Brett successfully leads a mission in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands to destroy a V-2 rocket fuel manufacturing plant, significantly damaging German defensive capabilities and ensuring a successful invasion. Ray is unable to accompany his daughter to the front due to medical treatment for complications from his alcoholism, but manages to come to terms with it and part on good terms with Mary. Fabienne, meanwhile, bombs a German base, calling J\u00fcrgen beforehand to meet her across the street to spare him. She is subsequently found out and arrested trying to escape.\nIn the final Allied push for Paris, three of the friends unknowingly cross paths as American infantry skirmish with German panzer units commanded by J\u00fcrgen. Maurice and Jim fend off the tanks on the ground as Brett and his OSS men call in air support from a nearby hill.

Although the process of mechanization is expensive, there are rumors that anyone who makes it to the last stop of the Galaxy Express 999, an advanced intergalactic transit system resembling a passenger train pulled by a JNR Class C62 steam locomotive, can get a machine body for free. To get there is the goal of twelve-year-old street urchin Tetsuro Hoshino, living in the slums of Megalopolis City, where the 999 makes its stop on Earth for one day of each year.\nTetsuro attempts to swipe a pass for the train with the help of his friends, only to be apprehended by mechanical policemen and losing a scarab-like locket in the altercation. Before fleeing the scene, he meets a mysterious woman who bears a striking resemblance to his late mother, who collects his locket. With the police in hot pursuit, Tetsuro sees the woman again later on a balcony and faints trying to reach her. She saves him from the police and uses a device to look into his dreams, where she watches a young Tetsuro lose his mother to the villainous Count Mecha, who hunts humans for trophies. Tetsuro awakens to the sound of the woman seemingly talking to someone else in the shower, only to find her alone. He shortly thereafter learns the woman's name is Maetel and explains to her he wants a mechanical body so he can kill Count Mecha in revenge. Returning his locket, revealing it to house a photograph of his mother, Maetel offers him a ticket for the 999 under the condition that they travel together, to which Tetsuro agrees. They narrowly avoid the police once more and go to Megalopolis Station, where the train departs Earth for its journey to the Andromeda Galaxy.\nThe train's Conductor announces the first stop of the journey to be Saturn's moon Titan, which has been terraformed to have a hospitable atmosphere, with a layover of sixteen Earth days (roughly one day on Titan). Upon arriving, however, Tetsuro witnesses a man get murdered in broad daylight and Maetel gets kidnapped by bandits, before he himself gets knocked out. Awakening in the house of an elderly woman who saved him, Tetsuro learns that Titan is governed under \"paradise law\", essentially an anarchy where everyone can do as they please, and that Maetel was kidnapped by the Grape Valley Bandits. Though initially telling him not to pursue her, the old woman helps Tetsuro rescue Maetel by providing him with a hat and poncho to shield him from Titan's intense sunlight as well as a gun for self-defense, all of which belonged to her son, Tochiro \u014cyama. With this, Tetsuro sets out to find Maetel and meets Antares, the leader of the Grape Valley Bandits, after saving a young girl in his care from a machine man. Antares tells Tetsuro that the gun he carries, the Warrior's Weapon, is highly effective against mechanized people and upon hearing Tetsuro is traveling on the 999 to get a machine body and kill Count Mecha, takes him in and checks him, as well as the captive Maetel, to make sure they are not mechanized. After discerning they are not, Antares shows Tetsuro and Maetel unexploded bullets still inside of him, and then shows them the many children he's caring for, all orphaned by Count Mecha. They speculate on where Count Mecha's hideout, the Time Castle, will appear next, and Antares tells Tetsuro the one person who may know is the space pirate Emeraldas, and tells Tetsuro to show no mercy when meeting Count Mecha. He lets them go free, and Tetsuro thanks the old woman who helped him before he and Maetel return to the train. She tells him to keep her son's clothes and gun, and Tetsuro promises to tell Tochiro that she is still waiting for him if he should happen to encounter him while traveling.\nThe next stop on their journey is Pluto, a planet where the bodies of people who died or gave up their humanity for machine bodies are kept locked in solid ice. From here, Tetsuro witnesses Maetel looking at someone under the ice, and meets a faceless machine woman named Shadow, the caretaker of the icy graves. She shows Tetsuro her original body, kept in an elegant glass casket, and reveals that her machine body is faceless because she knew no other face could be as beautiful. Then Shadow nearly freezes Tetsuro to death, clinging to him for his warmth, before Maetel intervenes and saves him, rebuking the sorrowful Shadow for being unable to decide between life as a machine woman and life as a human woman. They depart Pluto, and back on the train, make the acquaintance of a young waitress named Claire, who has a machine body made of crystal glass. Tetsuro, enamored by her beauty, strikes up a friendship with Claire, and she explains she obtained her glass body at the behest of her mother, but hopes to buy back her old body from Pluto. Shortly after this, the train is passed by the Queen Emeraldas, the spaceship of Emeraldas. Tetsuro, out of desperation, fires his gun at the ship to get Emeraldas's attention, causing her to board the ship and hold Tetsuro at gunpoint. Emeraldas stops short of killing Tetsuro after seeing Tochiro's gun in his possession, and relents completely when Maetel appears with Tochiro's hat. Tetsuro learns that Maetel and Emeraldas know each other, and that Emeraldas and Tochiro are lovers. The space pirate reluctantly informs Tetsuro that the Time Castle will appear next near Trader's Fork, a waystation on the arid planet Heavy Melder, the train's next stop. Claire pleads to the Conductor to pass Heavy Melder, but he refuses, knowing he would be fired for negligence if he did, while also recognizing Claire's concern for Tetsuro's well-being, much to her embarrassment.\nAt Trader's Fork, which resembles an Old West frontier town, Tetsuro finds his way to a saloon where a beautiful machine woman named Ryuzu performs a song before a tearful crowd. Tetsuro, having made a friend in the sympathetic bartender after being taunted by some of the other patrons for ordering milk, asks if the old man might know where the Time Castle will appear, sending the entire saloon into silence. The bartender cautiously takes Tetsuro into a storeroom and, after trying to warn him of the danger, tells him to venture out a ship near Mt. Gun Frontier where an eccentric who knows the answer lives. Tetsuro travels there on a ramshackle motorized bicycle and discovers a downed ship at the base of the mountain, where he encounters Tochiro living alone inside of it, with his only company being the bird Tori-san. Seeing Tetsuro with his clothes and gun and learning he knows his mother, Tochiro invites Tetsuro inside, telling the young boy that he will soon succumb to an illness he contracted while trying to chase Count Mecha across the galaxy himself. Before he can die, however, Tochiro informs Tetsuro that the Time Castle will next appear on the other side of Mt. Gun Frontier and warns him to shoot Count Mecha in his weak point; his head. Following this, he enlists Tetsuro in helping activate a machine mere moments before his death, which vaporizes his body and transfers his consciousness into the supercomputer of the Arcadia, the ship of his best friend and Tetsuro's hero, Captain Harlock. Tetsuro then erects a memorial to Tochiro and tries to make his way back to Trader's Fork, but gets assaulted by thugs from the saloon working for Count Mecha, who steal his gun and leave him for dead.\nReturning to Trader's Fork, the badly beaten Tetsuro attempts to reclaim his gun, but gets pinned to the saloon floor by the largest of the thugs. However, before they can harm him further, Harlock enters the saloon and saves Tetsuro by overpowering the thug and forcing him to drink milk, which kills him by rusting him from the inside. Harlock tells Tetsuro that he saved him in return for what he did for Tochiro, and they meet up with Maetel and Emeraldas, the latter of whom leaves the scene in silence after Harlock informs her that Tochiro has died. Tetsuro then makes his way over Mt. Gun Frontier to the Time Castle, a giant technologically-advanced floating castle that can travel through space and time. He discovers, much to his horror, the taxidermied remains of his mother mounted on a fireplace inside, before encountering Count Mecha, who was alerted to Tetsuro's arrival by Ryuzu, his lover. The confrontation is briefly interrupted by a cloaked figure revealing himself to be Antares, who came to help Tetsuro fight Count Mecha in the name of his orphaned wards. The bandit buys Tetsuro enough time against Count Mecha's men for him to chase the mechanical count to the Time Castle's central computer chamber, where Tetsuro shoots off one of Count Mecha's arms before the latter calls down a glass capsule to try and safely move the Time Castle forward through time and escape. However, as Ryuzu suddenly hesitates to advance time, Antares enters to help Tetsuro, sacrificing his life when the bullets inside of him go off after being shot by Count Mecha's gun, killing him and shattering the capsule. Before he dies, however, the bandit warns Tetsuro not to trust Maetel. Tetsuro shoots Count Mecha in the head just as he attempts to advance time, killing him. Ryuzu reveals that Tetsuro reminded her of what it was like to be human, and this caused her to betray her Count Mecha, who only became a monster after being mechanized. Tetsuro then flees the Time Castle as it crumbles into dust and Ryuzu dies, her body rusting away.\nOutside, Tetsuro meets with Harlock and Maetel, who question what he will do now that his mother was avenged. No longer wanting a mechanized body and seeing what rejection of one's own humanity can do to others, Tetsuro explains that his revenge will not be complete until he stops mechanization once and for all, and thereafter thanks Maetel for helping him onto the 999. The two barely make it back to the station before the train departs, and as they approach the last stop, Tetsuro asks Maetel if he can come live with her when they return to Earth. Maetel sadly reflects to herself that Tetsuro's feelings will change when he realizes who she really is. At last, the train arrives at the final station on the mechanization homeworld in Andromeda, also known as Planet Maetel. Tetsuro, horrified upon hearing the planet's name, learns why Maetel brought him to the planet; the free mechanical body offered there is that of a mechanized component of the planet itself, and Tetsuro was selected to become one, in a process Maetel, the planet's princess, has done many times over the years with countless other humans. Betrayed, Tetsuro angrily slaps Maetel, but gets incapacitated by guards who take him below the planet to be mechanized in the presence of Maetel's mother and ruler of Andromeda, Queen Promethium. However, before this can happen, Maetel, desperate to save her young companion, enters the room and reveals that she intends to destroy the planet with her pendant, which contains the consciousness of her father and Promethium's husband Dr. Pan (Dr. Ban in the English dub), a traitor who opposed the mechanized empire and also the mysterious voice Tetsuro heard back on Earth. Dr. Pan explains that the pendant contains enough energy to disrupt the planet's mechanized counterparts, all of whom were transformed willingly in the hopes of someday destroying Promethium's empire.\nThough Maetel initially hesitates due to her connection to the planet, Tetsuro takes the pendant and launches it to the core of Andromeda, setting off its self-destruction. At this same time, outside, the Arcadia and Queen Emeraldas have arrived and fight back against the forces of Andromeda, as both Harlock and Emeraldas intend to ensure Tetsuro's survival. Maetel and Tetsuro barely escape with their lives aboard the 999, as Maetel explains her body is an organic copy of his mother's, and that she travels through time through cloning. Suddenly, the enraged Promethium appears and tries to strangle the life out of Tetsuro, but is interrupted by Claire, who grabs hold of the queen and self-destructs in an act of sacrifice to save Tetsuro, seemingly killing Promethium. The 999 returns to Earth, where Maetel tells Tetsuro that she will return to Pluto to be reunited with her original body and tells him that when next they meet, he may not recognize her, thereafter kissing him.

When the actual aliens arrive to investigate the second saucer, they disguise themselves as the gendarmes. The actual gendarmes then ambush them and spray them with water using packs on their back. Despite being sprayed with water, the aliens use their laser vision do destroy the gendarmes' water packs. The gendarmes briefly engage the aliens in hand-to-hand combat before the aliens seemingly retreat into their saucer and fly away. The next day, the gendarmes are being saluted as heroes at a parade, when they suddenly start making metallic noises and collapse. It is revealed that these are actually the alien gendarmes. Moments later, the flying saucer comes out of nowhere and flies over the crowd, being piloted by the real gendarmes who accidentally boarded the real saucer.

Before his draft board-appointment, Claude begins exploring New York, where he encounters a close-knit \"tribe\" of hippies led by George Berger. He observes the hippies panhandle from a trio of horseback riders including Short Hills, New Jersey debutante Sheila Franklin (\"Sodomy\") and later catches and mounts a runaway horse, which the hippies have rented, exhibiting his riding skills to Sheila (\"Donna\") before then returning the horse to Berger, who offers to show him around.\nThat evening, Claude gets stoned on marijuana with Berger and the tribe. He is then introduced to various race and class issues of the 1960s (\"Hashish\", \"Colored Spade\", \"Manchester\", \"I'm Black/Ain't Got No\"). The next morning, Berger finds a newspaper clipping which gives Sheila's address in Short Hills, New Jersey. The tribe members\u2014LaFayette \"Hud\" Johnson, Jeannie Ryan (who is pregnant), and \"Woof Dacshund\"\u2014crash a private dinner party to introduce Claude to Sheila, who secretly enjoys her rigid environment being disrupted (\"I Got Life\"). After Berger and company are arrested, Claude uses his last $50 to bail him out of jail\u2014where Woof resists having his hair cut (\"Hair\").\nWhen Sheila is unable to borrow any money from her father, Berger returns to his parents' home. His mother gives him enough cash to bail out his friends. They subsequently attend a peace rally in Central Park, where Claude drops acid for the first time (\"Initials\", \"Electric Blues/Old Fashioned Melody\", \"Be In\"). Just as Jeannie proposes marriage to Claude, in order to keep him out of the Army, Sheila shows up to apologize. Claude's \"trip\" reflects his inner conflict over which of three worlds he fits in with: his own native Oklahoman farm culture, Sheila's upper-class society, or the hippies' free-wheeling environment.\nAfter his acid trip, Claude falls out with Berger and the tribe members, ostensibly due to a practical joke they pull on Sheila (taking her clothes while she's skinny-dipping, which forces her to hail a taxi in just her panties), but also due to their philosophical differences over the war in Vietnam\u2014and over personal versus communal responsibility. After wandering the city (\"Where Do I Go?\"), Claude finally reports to the draft board (\u201cBlack Boys/White Boys\u201d), completes his enlistment, and is shipped off to Nevada for basic training.\nIt's now Winter in New York when Claude writes to Sheila from Nevada (\"Walking In Space\"), who subsequently shares the news with the others. Berger devises a scheme to visit Claude in Nevada. Meanwhile, Hud's fianc\u00e9e\u2014with whom he has a son, LaFayette Jr.\u2014wants to marry as they had apparently planned to earlier (\"Easy To Be Hard\"). The tribe members trick Sheila's brother Steve out of his car, then head west to visit Claude.\nArriving at the Army training center where Claude is stationed (\"Three-Five-Zero-Zero\", \"Good Morning Starshine\"), the hippies are turned away, ostensibly because the base is on alert, but also because the MP on duty loathes their appearance, proceeding to condescendingly caricaturize Berger's perceived vernacular. Sometime later, Sheila chats up army sergeant Fenton at a local bar, using sex to lure him to an isolated desert road and acquire his uniform. The hippies steal his car, and Berger cuts his hair and dons the uniform (symbolically becoming a responsible adult), then drives it onto the Army base. He finds Claude and offers to replace him for the next headcount so that Claude can meet Sheila and the others for a going-away picnic in the desert.\nUnfortunately, just after a disguised Claude slips away to the picnic, the base becomes fully activated with immediate ship-outs for Vietnam. Berger's ruse is never discovered; clearly horrified of potentially joining the war, he is herded onto the plane to be shipped out. Claude returns to the empty barracks and frantically pursues Berger's plane but is unable to reach it before it takes off for Southeast Asia (\"The Flesh Failures\").\nMonths later, Claude, Sheila, and the tribe gather around Berger's grave in Arlington National Cemetery, whose grave marker shows that he was killed in Vietnam (\"Let the Sunshine In\").

Instead, unraveled by the intensive security scrutiny he's being subjected to, and utterly clueless why, Davis idly shares it with Castle. When the telltale bait shows up in Moscow Percival concludes with myopic certainty Davis was its source. An expert in assassinations and biological toxins, the doctor then injects a hungover, bed-ridden Davis with a toxin that makes it appear the man's liver had given out from alcoholism.\nCastle is given the task of hosting an old nemesis from his days being posted in apartheid South Africa seven years earlier, chief intelligence officer Muller. It was he, it is revealed, who had tormented Castle after Castle met and fell in love with Sarah. Operating under his cover as a writer Castle had been tasked by MI6 with observing the local Communist movement. He befriended its white leader, Matthew Connolly (Tony Vogel), who introduced him to the beautiful, sophisticated Bantu, Sarah. The couple fell for one-another and soon became intimate. Caught in a South African surveillance sting intended to compromise him into doing Muller's bidding, Castle fled the country to avoid arrest and exposure, then awaited Sarah - pregnant by a previous, then-deceased boyfriend - being smuggled to him by Connolly.\nEver since Castle has been repaying the favor by passing information on to the Soviets via a contact in London, and flinches when Muller casually drops that Connolly had recently \"accidentally\" died in police custody. Shortly after he learns in an agency briefing given by Muller of a plan for the South Africans to use U.S.-supplied tactical nuclear weapons to eradicate the nation's Communist insurgents en masse. Although he is not a Communist, Castle feels compelled as a humanitarian to pass a warning on to Moscow, no matter the risk of shining MI6's counterintelligence security spotlight on himself.\nHe does. Seeking to stay one step ahead of Percival and Daintry, he surrenders himself into the hands of underground Communist operatives in Britain, who successfully smuggle him to safety in the Soviet Union. Having received assurances from his handler that his wife and child would soon join him there, he grows impatient when he learns that MI6 is preventing them being allowed to leave Britain. Ultimately a passport complication is trumped to force Sarah to choose between her husband and son.\nDesperate, despondent, and isolated, Castle is reduced to a powerless pawn by the Soviets. He soon is to be forced by them to appear in a press conference both announcing his defection and denouncing the \"Uncle Remus\" nuclear ambush plan. His two worst fates - losing his wife and child, and not only forfeiting his career and nation but being coerced into representing himself as both a Communist and a traitor when he never intended to be either - close in on him like the jaws of a vice. He is so overcome to hear from Sarah that she cannot, will not come, he is unable even to hang up the phone when their connection is lost. He collapses in anguish as its receiver swings like a pendulum from its cord, foreshadowing the approaching end of his rope.", "tmdb_id": 39293}, "41511433": {"title": "The Humanoid (film)", "plot": "Sometime in the distant future, the planet Metropolis (once known as Earth) is a peaceful utopia led by a leader called The Great Brother. His world is threatened by his brother Graal who has escaped from a prison satellite, stolen a warship and enlisted the help of a mad scientist named Dr. Kraspin. Kraspin has a plan to make an army of unstoppable supersoldiers he calls \"Humanoids,\" but to mutate them he requires the powerful element Kapitron that is being kept at the Grovan Institute on Metropolis.\nGraal sends down a squad of soldiers to break into the institute and steal the Kapitron. They are also ordered to kill a woman named Barbara Gibson, a scientist who once worked with Kraspin but who realized the horrendous potential of the element and had Kraspin committed to a mental facility. Kraspin had escaped the facility two years earlier and seeks revenge against her. Barbara leaves before the slaughter when she is summoned home by her mysterious pupil, a boy named Tom Tom who exhibits powers of mental suggestion. Tom Tom also communes periodically with two mysterious beings who he claims are foreign travelers.\nAfter the raid, Graal returns to his hidden base on the planet Noxon where he is joined by Lady Agatha, the world's tyrannical queen, who hopes to share the rule of the galaxy as Graal's wife once he conquers Metropolis. Kraspin is also hiding there, given asylum in exchange for keeping Agatha young and beautiful with daily injections of a youth serum he creates by sapping the life essence of female slaves.\nOnce in possession of the Kapitron, Kraspin selects the perfect specimen to test his mutation on and targets a bearded, giant of a man named Golob. Kraspin forces Golob to crash his ship in a lake and Kraspin fires a small Kapitron missile which explodes turning Golob into a beardless, raging hulk with superhuman strength. Witnessing the horror is Golob's robot dog companion Kip, who sadly watches Kraspin capture and take his master away.\nKraspin fits Golob with a brain  control chip  and unleashes him upon Metropolis with orders to kill the Great Brother. Nick, a Metropolis security officer, tries to protect the Great Brother, but Golob is unstoppable. As Golob approaches his primary target to destroy him, Kraspin interrupts with new orders to go after Barbara Gibson first and Golob leaves.\nGolob tracks Barbara to her house but Tom Tom uses his powers to calm him down and removes the control chip. Golob, now free of Kraspin's control, becomes Tom Tom and Barbara's friend. Golob tells Barbara that Graal and Kraspin are hiding on Noxon and she goes to inform Nick and The Great Brother. On her way, however, Barbara is captured by Graal's forces and taken back to his base. Tom Tom and Golob try to rescue her but are forced to retreat when Graal's soldiers open fire. The two are saved by the mysterious travelers who shoot the soldiers with glowing arrows.\nAt the Metrolpolis command center, Nick devises a plan to rescue Barbara with a commando raid, but the Great Brother fears innocent people living on Noxon will be killed. Instead, Golob says he will rescue Barbara himself. Nick joins him and he and Golob take a ship to Noxon. Along the way they discover Tom Tom stowing away and wanting to help. Nearing the planet, their ship is attacked by Graal's fighters and crash lands. Near the crash site, they encounter Kip who Golob excitedly remembers as his old companion. Kip then helps them sneak into Graal's base. Once inside the heroes discover Kraspin has a giant missile filled with Kapitron that he will explode over Metropolis and turn its population into mutant humanoids.\nMeanwhile, Barbara is taken to Kraspin's laboratory and placed in a machine to extract her essence. Barbara is saved last minute when Nick and Golob burst in and free her from the machine. Kraspin and Agatha then attempt to flee to Graal's ship.\nWith Barbara's help and assistance from the mysterious travelers, the heroes launch an attack on the missile launch bay. During the battle, Agatha, unable to get a dose of the youth serum, dies when she rapidly ages into a skeleton. Nick chases Graal onto the bridge of his ship and faces off with him in a duel. Graal shoots lasers from his hands in defense and almost kills Nick. Golob appears and crushes a control panel on his chest and Graal disappears. Kraspin is killed when Golob topples the launch pad of the Kapitron rocket. Golob then removes the Kapitron container from the missile which then launches across the bay and hits Graal's ship destroying it.\nWith the facility exploding around them, the heroes make their escape but without Golob. Tom Tom spots him running away with the Kapitron and jumping off a cliff into a lake. The lake explodes and the heroes fear Golob dead, but he emerges from the water with the effects of the mutation having been reversed. The group briefly celebrates their reunion and victory over their enemy.\nA mysterious translucent sailing ship appears in the sky piloted by the two travelers. Tom Tom tells Barbara that his mission is over and he must return home. Barbara asks who he really is and where he comes from. Tom Tom tells her he is returning to a land called Tibet in the ancient past, but he will always be with her in her heart.

Ida is upset by the amount of litter around the park, despite the signs posted. After Ida has the disgusting experience of stepping on someone's discarded sandwich, Cookie (who cannot read) points out another sign, an advertisement for a children's film making contest by the National Film Board of Canada. When Ida reads it to her, Cookie asks if she's going to enter. Ida initially says no, but reconsiders.\nLater that day, Ida goes rooting around in her house's attic for an old movie camera of her father's. She is disheartened to find it broken, but her mother encourages her to go to the camera store and get an estimate on what it would take to repair it. There, Ida gets another shock when she find out that not only will she have to leave it there, but that it will cost about $20 overall, both to repair the camera (which has a broken spring), and to buy a roll of film. Although she leaves it there, Ida does not know where to get that much money.\nIda and Cookie are talking it over later, when Ida's brother Fred, a baseball player, comes home from a game. Fred is angry over having lost the last game of the season, and is scornful of Ida's plans, to say nothing of being unwilling to give her any money. He coldly suggests that Ida earn the money, which she is not sure how to do. But then her mother calls to Ida about the junk she left all over the attic, when she was searching for the camera. She says that she will throw it all away unless Ida cleans it up, which gives Ida another brainstorm: a garage sale.\nThe sale goes well, to the point where Ida is even able to talk Fred into paying 75 cents for an old soldier's helmet that he finds (even though it's already theirs). Irritated, he calls into question whether Ida even knows how to use a camera, prompting Ida to admit that she has to learn. So when Ida successfully pays for the camera with her funds from the sale, she makes sure to ask the salesman how to use it.\nFilming starts, with Ida, Cookie, and even Fred all decked out: Ida has borrowed a fancy-looking beret from her mother (\"All directors wear them! I saw it in a book!\"), Cookie in a long dress (she is practicing a dance she will do), and Fred refusing to take off his soldier's hat. Ida and Cookie persuade Fred to join the filming, a story about the importance of picking up garbage and keeping things clean. Since it's garbage pick-up day in Ida's neighborhood, Fred will make a show of picking up trash bags and taking them to the curb, while Cookie will dance about and plant little flowers, to \"make the yard look nice.\" A simple enough plan, but it rapidly goes wrong: just as the garbage men arrive on the street,  Fred picks up one of Cookie's dolls by accident, and they get into a tug-of-war over it, on camera. Cookie falls down as the doll is thrown into the garbage truck and is crushed in its compactor and the camera catches that, too. Nonetheless, Ida is sure that the film turned out great, consoling Cookie over the loss of the doll as Fred goes back inside, insisting that no one will want to watch the film.\nTwo weeks later, Ida gets a letter from the film board (addressed to \"Ida T. Lucas\"), telling her that her powerful film about \"the effect of war on children\" has been selected as a finalist, and that she and her family should come to the awards ceremony on the 2nd of September. Ida is thrilled, despite the misunderstanding, while Cookie is bothered by the idea of accepting an award for the film under what seem to be false pretenses, while Ida insists that it's not lying... especially if no one tells.\nIda is talking about the award with her mother, an artist who is making a drawing. Ida tries to conceal the misunderstanding by saying she has lost the letter, but is forced to reveal that she still has it: already, her cover story is falling apart. Her mother reads the letter and expresses surprise (and perhaps, a note of skepticism) that Ida would take on a profound topic like war in her amateur film.\nFinally, awards night arrives, but Ida tries to chicken out, claiming that she's sick. (Comically, she claims to have an ulcer, and that she's afraid it's contagious.) Clearly guilt-stricken over her lie of omission, Ida asks her mother a veiled question: if someone misunderstood one of her mother's pictures, but still liked it, is it right to correct them? Her mother insists that it's the right thing to do, especially since she'd be the only person who could reveal the truth. She also reassures Ida that she'll always be proud of her, even if she doesn't win. Suddenly, Ida's \"ulcer\" miraculously clears up, and she's eager to go to the awards.\nAt the ceremony, the award is presented by the kindly Mr. Druffle, who announces that Ida's work, on \"how devastating war is to children,\" is the winner. The film is then shown, with Ida and the kids then realizing how, with Fred and Cookie fighting, and him wearing the helmet, the film could be misinterpreted as a powerful anti-war statement. So when Ida reluctantly takes the podium, she tries to decline the award in a fit of conscience, explaining to Mr. Druffle how the mistake came about. Clearly taken aback, by the confession, Mr. Druffle then decides that since she did win the award on merit, and since honesty should be rewarded, that the Board will allow Ida to keep the award anyway. He then encourages a round of applause for Ida's film, on \"how to wage war... on garbage.\"", "tmdb_id": 422191}, "30746189": {"title": "Iddaru Asadhyule", "plot": "Janaki is wife of a Sepoy.

There is a turnaround in the Mikros strike when the Party decides to side with the workers, and Tomac now commissions Kova\u010d to write an article similar to the one that was originally censored, which he refuses.\nKova\u010d befriends Kos (Fabijan \u0160ovagovi\u0107), an old journalist.

Six of these convicts are a young boy named Toby Nelson; his older sister Polly; \"Big George\" Tomkins, a blacksmith; Jake \"Dipper\" Davey, a professional pickpocket who has become old and slow; William Watts, a \"village idiot\" nicknamed \"Silly Billy\"; and Jack Doolan, a highwayman. The Northern Star sails into the harbour, and the convicts are greeted by the Lieutenant Governor, Colonel Lindsay Lightfoot, left in charge of the colony while the Governor is inspecting Norfolk Island. Sergeant \"Bully\" Langden tells Colonel Lightfoot's aide, Captain Pertwee, that the military need five men to work on the Government farm, and he selects Big George, Jack, Dipper, Silly Billy and Toby for the task. Polly is taken away from the docks by Colonel Lightfoot's wife Augusta to assist her cook and laundrymaid.\nEarly next morning, the five convicts are aroused by Bully's deputy, Corporal \"Weazel\" Wesley, who issues them with a small ration of bread and some work tools before marching them out to begin their first day's work. Toby starts to struggle when the day gets hotter, but Dipper is the first to fall. The other convicts carry him to the shade, give him some water and fan him with his hat. He starts to recover when Weazel finds them. He aims his rifle at Jack's heart, but is interrupted by Bully, who orders him to join Bully in hunting.\nThat night, Dipper brings out a gentleman's watch with a music box in it, the only possession Dipper can truly call his own. The music sends Dipper's friends to sleep, allowing him to creep out of the hut and distract the guards by throwing some pebbles. As they chase after what they suppose is an intruder, Dipper sneaks back to the work site, finds a baby koala who was orphaned when Bully shot his mother, and takes him back to the hut, where he gives him to Toby as a pet.\nOne day, a tree falls on top of Dipper, mortally wounding him. With his last bit of strength, Dipper gives Toby the music box watch and tells him that he wants him to have it. In the days that follow Dipper's burial, Toby often sees Jack looking towards the distant Blue Mountains, and one night overhears that Jack is planning to escape, not wanting to suffer the same fate as Dipper. The next morning, George starts breaking the tools, drawing the attention of the soldiers and allowing Jack to untether a horse and quietly turn it towards the mountains.\nGeorge is given fifty lashes and thrown into a punishment cell on Bully's orders. Toby comes up with a plan to search for Jack in the bush so that they can help George escape. A noise causes Bully and Weazel to wake in the guardhouse and see Toby's shadow between the wire fence and scrub. Toby runs for his life and doesn't stop until he cannot hear the shouts of the pursuing guards.\nAs Toby continues to search for Jack, he gets a feeling that someone is following him, but he hears little and doesn't see anything when he stops to look. The next evening, he is close to exhaustion when he finds a clearing with the remains of a dug-out fire. Meeting a young Aborigine with a pet cockatoo and dingo, he soon realises that the other boy is actually a friend. Toby finds out that his new friend is named Wahroonga and he had been following Toby through the bush to make sure that no harm came to him or his koala.\nNext morning, Wahroonga leads Toby along a dry river bed looking for hoof prints and other small clues to Jack's possible escape route. At one point, Wahroonga and Toby are forced to hide behind a bush as two bushrangers pass them. Just as Toby and Wahroonga are ready to leave their hiding place, they hear a third horse approach them. It turns out to be Jack. After introducing Jack to Wahroonga, Toby tells him about what has happened to Big George and why he ran away. Jack, Toby, Wahroonga and the koala make their way back towards Sydney Town.\nOn the edge of the convict settlement, Jack tells Toby that they will need to distract the guards to allow them to get near George's cell, and they will need some tools to break down the cell door. Toby remembers seeing tools in the storehouse next to the cell. As the guards are being served tea and stew, Wahroonga causes the cockatoo to fly toward the line of soldiers and cause them to scatter in all directions, then commands the dingo to snap and snarl at the soldiers' horses causing them to bolt toward the bush. As the soldiers set off in pursuit, Jack and Toby head for the storehouse. They find no tools there, only barrels of rum and oil. Jack gets Toby to open the oil barrels while he takes the rum.\nThe soldiers return to the settlement and drink the tea, getting drunk on the rum Jack had put into it. Jack sends Toby to collect Silly Billy while he heads for the guardhouse to get the keys to Big George's cell. Toby and Billy take the key and unlock the punishment cell. Billy yells to awaken George, but is heard by Bully. Jack hurls the oil to the ground, causing the pursuing soldiers to slip and fall to the ground. Despite his drunken state, Bully aims a rifle at Jack. A boomerang thrown by Wahroonga hits Bully on the back of his neck, sending his gunshot through a window of the Governor's house (causing a frightened Polly to drop the oil lamp she is carrying) before he falls unconscious to the ground. But the flame of the dropped lamp ignites on the now-spreading oil, causing a fire which engulfs the house so fast that Polly and Augusta are trapped inside.\nAs the four convicts begin their escape, Wahroonga sees the flames coming out of the house and signals to them. Big George leads a mad dash toward the building. Jack, Toby, George and Billy are able to smash the door down and guide Polly and Augusta out safely. A couple of hours later, the four convicts explain their actions to Colonel Lightfoot. Toby tries to introduce Wahroonga, only to discover that he has disappeared into the shadows of the bush. Bully is found guilty of being drunk on duty and locked in the punishment cell, while the Lieutenant Governor grants the brave convicts who saved his wife full pardons and grants of land on which they could start their own farms.\nThe artist looks at his watch and realises that he has to end the story because it's getting late, then mentions that the watch plays a little tune when he opens it up, revealing himself to be an elderly Toby.

Lauren and Daniel soon meet Julius Santorin (Laurence Olivier), a quirky but kind elderly man, literally by accident. Daniel is unimpressed by him, but he fascinates Lauren with stories of his life, telling of a tradition that if a couple kiss in a gondola beneath the Bridge of Sighs in Venice at sunset while the church bells toll, they will be in love forever. At Lauren's birthday party, Daniel punches George for making a crude suggestion about Lauren, and the two are forbidden to date by Lauren's mother.\nTold her family will be returning to America soon, Lauren hatches a plan to travel to Venice with Daniel. Though they have money from a horse race (in which Julius actually loses the money betting on their chosen horse, but steals the money to take the trip by picking the pockets of the racegoers), they cannot cross the border without an adult.

In the meantime, Lauren's family spark an international investigation, believing she has been abducted.\nThey hitch a ride with a couple of American tourists, Bob and Janet Duryea (Andrew Duncan and Claudette Sutherland), who are headed to Venice. In Verona, the travelers go out to dinner together, where Bob discovers that his wallet has been stolen. Even though their winnings from the horse race were left on the train in Julius's vest, Julius offers to pay the bill with cash, perplexing Lauren and irritating Daniel, who suspects he stole it. The following morning at breakfast, the Duryeas notice Lauren's picture in an Italian newspaper, revealing her as a missing child. Julius has also seen the paper and intercepts Lauren and Daniel on their way back to the hotel, angry that Lauren lied to him about their true reason for going to Venice and that everyone will think he's a kidnapper.\nBecause they cannot go back to the hotel, they join a local bicycle race to escape Verona. Julius soon falls behind and Lauren persuades Daniel to go back for him. They find him collapsed from exhaustion. Daniel worms his background out of Julius, who also confesses that he both picked Bob's pocket and stole the money for their train tickets, disappointing Lauren. Lauren then reveals that she will be moving back to the United States permanently in two weeks. She wanted to take a gondola to the Bridge of Sighs and kiss Daniel so they could love each other forever. She berates Julius by dismissing all his stories as lies. Julius admits he lied about some things but insists the legend can be true. Daniel decides he still wants to go to Venice with Lauren, and Julius joins them.\nIn Venice, they spend the night in St Mark's Basilica, until a chance meeting with the Duryeas sets them on the run again hours before sunset. Julius hides them in a movie theater and gives them his remaining cash, promising to return a half-hour before sunset. As soon as they are inside, however, Julius turns himself in to police searching for them; despite being slapped around by an inspector, he refuses to reveal Lauren and Daniel's whereabouts. The two children fall asleep during the film and wake with just a few minutes remaining. Lauren and Daniel run to find a gondola, but most are already taken. They finally find an available gondolier; he takes them within sight of the bridge, but refuses to go further just as sunset arrives because they didn't pay him the full amount. Daniel pushes him into the canal and, as the bells of the Campanile begin chiming, the two pull the gondola by hand along the pilings toward the bridge, enabling the gondola to glide underneath.

In the police station, Julius finally reveals the two children's whereabouts, assuming they will have accomplished their goal.\nAfter a few days pass, Lauren is preparing to leave Paris for home with her mother and stepfather. Moments before she's about to enter the car to depart, Lauren notices Daniel standing across the street, waiting to say goodbye to her.

Nightrider is able to elude the MFP until the organisation's top pursuit man, Max Rockatansky, manages to break his concentration and steer him into a roadblock, resulting in a fiery crash that kills both Nightrider and his girlfriend.\nAt the MFP garage, Max is shown his new police car: a specially-built supercharged V8-powered black Pursuit Special. A conversation between Max's superior, Captain Fred \"Fifi\" Macaffee, and Police Commissioner Labatouche reveals the Pursuit Special was authorised to bribe Max, who is becoming weary of police work, into staying on the force.\nNightrider's motorbike gang, which is led by Toecutter and Bubba Zanetti, run riot in a town, vandalising property, stealing fuel, and terrorising the populace. A young couple attempts to escape, but the gang destroys their car and rapes them. Max and fellow officer Jim \"Goose\" Rains arrest Toecutter's young prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Johnny the Boy, at the scene. No witnesses appear in court and Johnny is deemed mentally unfit to stand trial, however, so, against Goose's furious objections, he is released into Bubba's custody.\nWhile Goose visits a nightclub in the city that night, Johnny sabotages his police motorbike, causing it to lock up at high speed the next day and launch Goose off the road. Dazed, but uninjured, Goose borrows a ute to haul his bike back to MFP headquarters. On the way, Johnny throws a brake drum through his windshield, and he crashes again. Toecutter urges, and then forces, a reluctant Johnny to throw a match into the wreck of the ute, burning Goose alive.\nAfter seeing Goose's charred body in the hospital ICU, Max informs Fifi that he is resigning from the MFP to save what is left of his sanity. Fifi convinces him to take some time off and think it over, so Max goes on a trip in his panel van with his wife, Jessie, and infant son, \"Sprog\" (Australian slang for a child). When they stop to fix the spare tyre, Jessie takes Sprog to get ice cream and is molested by Toecutter and his gang. She escapes, and the family flees to a remote farm owned by an elderly friend, May Swaisey.

In a plot to defame Chen as a master of Kung Fu, ruin Chen and his sister's opera troupe and gain Miss Chen as a brothel worker, the villainous gangster and brothel-owner Tuan (Lo Lieh) along with his wife whom acts as the brothel Mistress, frame a drunken Chen for the rape of Tuan's wife, and inform Chen and his sister that the punishment for his \"crime\" is death, however Chen's sister offers herself to be Tuan's concubine and work in the brothel indefinitely in exchange for her brother's life. Getting exactly what he and his wife wanted, Tuan's agrees, though only with the addition of being able to cripple Chen's hands, knowing he will have ruined Chen's status as a master of Kung Fu in doing so.\nYears pass by, and after the tragedy that befell he and his sister, Chen comes to terms with his alcoholism, and maintains a life of sobriety. Chen also gives up opera performing and practicing monkey style Kung Fu, as he is haunted by a regret and shame that he is to blame for his sister's life due to his previous inability to maintain sobriety. Chen struggles as a street entertainer and candy salesman (now somewhat of a local celebrity due to his kind and giving nature) to make ends meet, performing with his beloved trained monkey Ah Mao.\nA young thief, albeit with a good heart, named Monkey, (Hsiao Ho) watches on with a group of children at Chen and Ah Mao's entertainment showcase, until it is interrupted by a group of the town's thugs and extortionists. When Chen barely affords to pay them, they retaliate by destroying Chen's set and throwing his candies across the town square. Monkey steps in to help Chen clean up and collect his things as the extortionists storm off through town. Monkey cracks up a plan to steal back the money that the extortionists had taken from Chen and gift him with a warm meal for dinner.\nAfter successfully stealing the money back from the local extortionists, Monkey later visits Chen at his home on the outskirts of town with an expensive meal and wine to enjoy, knowing Chen likely lost all of his money to the extortionists earlier. Chen, who believes Monkey has sought him out for a show, asks the young man's name, to which Monkey explains he doesn't know his own name, but is called Monkey. Chen remarks that he ...\"does act like one.\" and tells him that no show will be going on that night, and he begins to return to the paltry meal he's made for himself. Monkey begins to unpack the meal he's brought for Chen, waving the expensive wine he's purchased under Chen's nose. Chen starkly refuses the wine at first, even attempting to kick Monkey out for tempting him. Chen soon apologizes for his brash action after seeing Monkey meant no harm, and accepts the meal, offering to dine with Monkey. He then inquires how Monkey could possibly afford the expensive meal he's offered. Monkey reveals he's stolen the money for it, and from the thugs that extorted Chen earlier at that, stating, \"...After all, if you're not strong, you have to steal.\" Chen realizes Monkey has been dealt a bad card, and comments on the cruelty of the unforgiving world they live in, and agrees to eat the gift of a meal with Monkey, and Ah Mao at his side.\nThe two bond over the meal and soon begin an odd friendship, where Monkey occasionally visits Chen for advice and guidance. Monkey continues to steal for a living, until he is caught by the local thugs who beat him up and run him out of town. Monkey seeks solace with Chen who reprimands him for his continued stealing, warning him that if he continues, he'll likely end up dead. Monkey refutes Chen's notion with the statement that if he does not steal, he'll die from starvation anyhow, to which Chen states: \"I don't steal... I don't starve.\" Though true, Monkey sees his situation different from Chen's and remarks: \"You're different, you've got a monkey show! I'm different, I HAVE to steal!\". Chen pities the young man and the bad card he's been dealt in life, and offers him respite in his home for the night, allowing Monkey to sleep alongside Ah Mao.\nThe following day, the local thugs again attempt to extort what little money Chen earns from selling candies and doing street entertainment shows with Ah Mao. The extortionists throw Chen's candies across the town square again to distract him, then brutally murder Ah Mao, swinging him in circles from his leash and smashing the small monkey against a tree. Monkey \nvisits Chen at his home later that night after hearing the horrific story of what happened earlier, and offers to get revenge for Ah Mao and Chen, but Chen refuses, as Monkey would surely be risking his life attempting to go against the local extortionists. Monkey instead goes into business with Chen as a stand-in for the late Ah Mao using his natural Monkey like traits and acrobatic skills to put on a compelling and lucrative show for the townspeople. However, once again, the thugs return for more extortion money from Chen, and while Monkey becomes immediately frustrated and attempts to attack the thugs, Chen is able to easily hold Monkey back and keep him grounded so he does not fight back. Chen's pockets are turned out and he is once again robbed of his earnings by the extortionists, which gravely angers Monkey.\nWhen Monkey questions Chen why he does not act when the extortionists come around, Chen's passive attitude angers Monkey and he attempts to storm off for revenge. Chen however stops Monkey in his tracks with relative ease, exclaiming that Monkey would have no chance against them, which makes Monkey highly suspicious of the seemingly helpless old man. Monkey then argues with Chen pointing out that he knows Chen is hiding the fact he knows true Kung Fu rather than the monkey tricks he's been taught for their street performances. Chen disregards this and leaves Monkey bound so he can not act on his anger stating, \"Now listen kid... Stick to monkey tricks, and LIVE. You got that!?\"\nMonkey, feeling his pride stomped on by repeated extortion from the local thugs, confronts the men at a local restaurant. Exclaiming he no longer wants to be called \"Monkey\" but \"Monkey King\" by the thugs. He uses his monkey tricks and acrobatics to embarrass the thugs, however they quickly overpower him and quickly beat him to a pulp, leaving him for dead outside of the restaurant. When Monkey returns to Chen, he maintains his stance that he was fighting for justice rather than for violence, and that if he wouldn't have been beaten as badly if Chen had taught him true Kung Fu. Chen reluctantly agrees to this and begins to lightly train Monkey in his unique style of Monkey Kung Fu, far off in the mountains outside of town. Months later, although the training is not quite complete, Monkey believes he is strong enough to defeat not only the extortionists, but the boss they work for, and leaves Master Chen to enact his revenge against them all.\nMonkey travels back into town and fights the extortionists, easily defeating them and forcing them to bring him to their boss. Monkey is led to the extortionist's boss, an older man who runs the local brothel and happens to be, the villainous Tuan. Tuan laughs at Monkey's unpolished Monkey style Kung Fu, mockingly suggesting he knows what real Monkey style Kung Fu looks like, and knows how to defeat it. Monkey eagerly confronts Tuan, believing himself to be the better skilled martial artist, but is badly beaten by Tuan, nearly to death; however a suspicious concubine of Tuan's recognizes the distinct style of Kung Fu that Monkey is using, to be that of her own brother's. Revealing herself as Miss Chen, she steps in to assist Monkey in the fight against Tuan; though her efforts merely buy Monkey enough time to escape and she is killed brutally, albeit reluctantly, by Tuan.\nMonkey returns to his Master, Chen, bruised and beaten, and details his naive attempts to beat the extortionist's boss, the meeting with Chen's sister, and her death. Chen, tempted to flee into town and avenge his sister, is halted and reminded of his crippled hands by Monkey. With no hesitation, Monkey offers himself to be the hands of his master, and complete his training in Monkey style Kung Fu, to avenge everyone who has befallen the fate of crossing paths with Tuen, and protect the town from his devious acts of extortion and villainy. Chen agrees, and trains intensely for an unspecified time with Monkey, who uses the time to bond with his master in a unique and congruent fashion, coming to model himself as a fighter and a man on a whole, after Chen. Monkey's training concludes after a sparring match shows Monkey has grown fast and strong enough to finally land not only his first, but a nearly unexpected strike on his master, even though Monkey is using Chen's own Monkey style Kung Fu to compete against him. Chen can only smile as he is amazed how quickly Monkey has adapted to and learned his cherished style of martial arts.\nShortly thereafter, Monkey returns to the brothel in town with a new approach. Quickly working his way through all Tuan's henchmen with relative ease, Monkey's temper boils inside and he falters, getting physically trapped in a net by a group of Tuan's henchmen, who attempt to drag Monkey off and execute him. Chen appears just in time, and saves Monkey and they fight side by side thinning out the herd of Tuan's henchmen. When Monkey and Chen prove to be too much for the countless men Tuan throws at them, Tuan challenges them both head to head, and engages in combat with the Master and student. Tuan manages to hold his own against the crippled master and gains the upper hand. Monkey, eager to get revenge steps in to take his master's place and be his hands, and quickly turns the tables on the villainous Tuan. As Monkey fights Tuan by himself, his focus grows, and while calm and collected he clearly outclasses the older man with his youth, let alone sheer skill in martial arts. Seeing that he can't possibly win, Tuan tries to flee the fight, however Monkey doesn't let him, and cripples Tuan's hands by sending them through a thick paned glass lantern, as payback for his master. Chen watches on and excuses the aggressive action as he believes justice has been served, though before he can intervene, Monkey still fueled by rage and not forgetting the lives lost at the hands of Tuan, drags him up a tall balcony in the brothel and jumps off, leaving Tuan to fall to his death on the concrete floor at Chen's feet. As Monkey drops down to return to his master, the remaining staff of the brothel, including Tuan's wife peer down at Monkey and Chen in fear. As Monkey jumps up to teach them a lesson as well, Chen catches him and calms his rage, leaving the brothel and ending their quest of revenge.", "tmdb_id": 46736}, "21869778": {"title": "The Mad Woman's 18 Years", "plot": "Mad woman (\u760b\u5973\u5341\u516b\u5e74) (1957) Xiao Yan-Qiu (\u5c0f\u8277\u79cb) acts a poor woman marries a rich man and become mad.

The United States has a secret orbiting nuclear missile platform satellite named Hercules, which was designed by Dr. Paul Bradley. It was intended to defend Earth against a threat like Orpheus, but instead was commandeered by the U.S. Armed Forces to become an orbiting weapon now aimed at the Soviet Union.

Needing the additional firepower to stop Orpheus, the President goes on national television and reveals the existence of Hercules, explaining it was created to meet the threat that Orpheus represents.

If the center is destroyed, Hercules will not be able to launch. With seconds to spare, Hercules receives the signal to fire from the command center, and launches its missiles.

Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While listening to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel named Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exaggerated by his mother revealing Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\" (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering independence movements that spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.\nTo prove himself, Brian is tasked by the PFJ to paint slogans on  Roman governor Pilate's palace, but is interrupted by a Roman officer. The officer, however, is more concerned with Brian's appalling grammar and, after correcting the slogan, orders him to write it one hundred times. The next morning, Brian has finished writing out and is subsequently chased away by a separate patrol of legionaries, unaware that Brian's act of vandalism had actually been ordered by one of their own Centurions. He then participates in an abortive attempt by the PFJ to kidnap Pilate's wife but is captured by the palace guards.\nEscaping when the guards suffer paroxysms of laughter over Pilate's speech impediment and his obliviousness to the hilarious names of his friends Biggus Dickus and Incontentia Buttocks, Brian winds up on a spaceship driven by aliens, before finding himself \u2013 once back to Earth \u2013 trying to blend in among prophets who are preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people start following him to the mountains, and there they declare him to be the Messiah. After spending a night in bed with Judith, Brian \u2013 still naked \u2013 discovers an enormous crowd assembled outside his mother's house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to Brian addressing them. He urges them to think for themselves, but they parrot his words as doctrine.\nThe PFJ seeks to exploit Brian's celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and is sentenced to crucifixion. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice. The crowd shouts out names containing the letter \"r\", mocking Pilate's rhotacistic speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, and Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".His order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film Spartacus, various crucified people all claim to be \"Brian\" so they can be freed and the wrong man is released. Other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as the PFJ and then Judith praise his martyrdom, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \"Judean People's Front\" charges and prompts the Roman soldiers to flee; however, the squad commits mass suicide as a form of political protest.

The carrier is destroyed but no wreckage of the shuttle is found. M, head of MI6, assigns James Bond, Agent 007, to investigate. En route to England, Bond is attacked and pushed out of an aeroplane by the mercenary assassin Jaws. He survives by stealing a parachute from the pilot, while Jaws lands on a trapeze net within a circus tent. At the Drax Industries spaceplane-manufacturing complex in California, Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and his henchman Chang. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, an astronaut, and survives an assassination attempt while inside a centrifuge chamber. Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, helps Bond find blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice; Drax discovers her involvement and has her killed by his pet dogs.\nIn Venice, Bond encounters Goodhead and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory, then is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to investigate and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a nerve gas deadly to humans, but harmless to plants and animals. Chang attacks Bond, but Bond hurls him through the stained glass clockface of the Saint Mark's clocktower, killing him; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a CIA agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretense of being on leave.\nBond survives attacks by Jaws, Chang's replacement, during Rio Carnival and on the Sugarloaf Cable Car. After Jaws' cable car crashes, he is rescued from the rubble by Dolly, a young woman, and the two fall in love. Drax's forces capture Goodhead, but Bond escapes; he learns that the toxin comes from a rare orchid indigenous to the Amazon jungle. Bond travels the Amazon River and comes under attack from Drax's forces, before eventually locating his base. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole back the loaned Shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead are locked in a room under the launch platform, and narrowly escape being burned alive by the exhausts of Moonraker 5, which is carrying Drax, and pose as pilots on Moonraker 6. The shuttles dock with Drax's space station, hidden from radar by a cloaking device.\nBond and Goodhead disable the radar jamming cloaking device; the United States sends a platoon of Marines aboard another shuttle to intercept the now-visible space station. Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would disperse the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life, their descendants a \"new master race.\" Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including him and Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines. Drax's forces are defeated as the station is destroyed, while Bond shoots and ejects Drax into space.

The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in Vietnam) shot hand-held on grainy  super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage.  The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt. One character burns his draft card, showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police overreaction during an anti-Vietnam protest.\nThe storylines and fates of the main characters include the following:\n\nNew Year's Eve 1964: John Milner is a drag-strip racer and falls in love with Eva, an attractive young woman from Iceland who speaks almost no English. Regardless, Milner does his best to communicate with her. He is briefly visited at the dragstrip by Steve, Laurie, Terry and Debbie, with Laurie pregnant and Terry in a military uniform, going to ship out to Vietnam the same night. Epilogue: Milner wins the final competition of the season on New Year's Eve 1964. Later that night, he is shown driving his trademark yellow deuce coupe down a long, hilly road with another vehicle's headlights coming the opposite direction. After disappearing over a small hill, neither Milner's taillights nor the approaching car's headlights are seen again, hinting that this may have been the crash in which Milner was killed. The anniversary of Milner's death is mentioned in both the 1965 and 1966 sequences.\nNew Year's Eve 1965: Terry \"The Toad\" Fields is in Vietnam and wants desperately to get out of the war and the abuse of his superiors, attempting to injure himself to do so. His desperation escalates after Joe Young (the leader of The Pharaohs, the lowrider gang of the previous film) is killed by a sniper in Vietnam, after promising to make Fields a Pharaoh once they return to civilian life. Epilogue: Fields fakes his own death and deserts for Europe; his superiors believe him to be dead in 1965, as do Debbie in 1966 and Steve and Laurie in 1967.\nNew Year's Eve 1966: Free-spirited Debbie \"Deb\" Dunham has switched from Old Harper whisky to marijuana and has given up her platinum blonde persona for one as a hippie/groupie. She misses Terry, mentioning that they were planning to get married before he went MIA in Vietnam. She is currently dating another hippie, Lance Harris, and wants to get married, but he isn't interested. At the beginning of the storyline, as they drive around San Francisco, they get pulled over by Bob Falfa, the drag racer from the first movie who has gone on to become a SFPD motorcycle patrolman, and arrests Lance for possession of a marijuana joint. She bails him out, but he still isn't interested at the idea of marriage, and acts distant towards her. She then joins some hippies of the band \"Electric Haze\" on a long, strange trip running over garbage cans, and they end up in a country-and-western bar. Epilogue: Dancing at the country-and-western bar, Debbie sees Lance dancing with another woman, so she hits him in the face and dumps him, causing a bar fight, and later joins the Electric Haze on another trip, as they go to watch the sunset. She ends up getting a full-time job as lead singer of a country-and-western music group.\nNew Year's Eve 1967: Steve Bolander and Laurie Henderson are now married with two children (it is implied they married because of Laurie's unplanned pregnancy), and living in the suburbs, but their relationship is strained by her insistence that she start her own career. Steve forbids it, saying he wants her to be a mom to their young twins.  Way beyond the end of her rope, Laurie leaves Steve and goes to stay with her brother Andy, who with his girlfriend Vicki (played by Cindy Williams' real-life sister, Carol-Ann Williams) is participating in an anti-war protest on a college campus, and is unsympathetic to her concerns. However, as Andy goes to the protest, he forgets his wallet behind and calls her to ask her to retrieve it. However, when she finds out that Andy is going to burn his draft card, she refuses to give it to him, just as the campus is surrounded by the police, and attempts to leave. She criticizes Andy's anti-war protest actions, saying that if the war was ended, Terry would have \"died\" for nothing. As they evade the police on the campus, Steve arrives, they embrace and he agrees to let her work, albeit in a few years, causing another argument between them and they are detained by the police. Epilogue: As the night falls, with Laurie, Vicki and all the female detainees held in a prison bus, Steve talks to her through the bus window bars, agreeing to let her work if she wants and they reconcile. However, as they attempt to convince the police that they are not demonstrators, a policeman hits the bus window bars with a truncheon, barely missing Laurie's fingers. When Steve tries to intervene, the policeman hits him in the chest, sparking a riot, and Steve and Andy escape, driving the bus off the campus. Steve, Laurie, Andy and Vicki watch the Times Square Ball drop on a TV in a store window. Steve continues to work as an insurance agent and Laurie becomes the head of a consumer group.The final scene of the movie shows Steve, Laurie, Andy and Vicki in front of the television store, Debbie and the Electric Haze in the band's van and Terry walking alone AWOL, all singing \"Auld Lang Syne\".

He's diagnosed with brain tumours. Ravi is eligible for an operation to remove these but is told that there may be life altering side-effects. Ravi also learns that Jayaraj's brother Ramaraj is offering a large reward for information leading to the capture of his brother's murderer. Feeling bereft, hopeless and worried about the financial future of his family, Ravi anonymously calls in a tip naming himself the murderer. He arranges for the reward money to go to his mother using lawyer Lakshmanan as arbiter without revealing himself to anyone. Ravi is arrested by the inspector. Neela tries to defend him but Ravi sabotages his own case and is sentenced to death. While in jail, he collapses due to his tumour and is operated on. He survives with no side-effects and finally realises the true magnitude of his actions. He will be hanged for a murder he did not commit. Ravi reveals the truth to his family and friends but Neela advises him that at this point, nothing short of producing the actual murderer will help him. He sets out to find the murderer and his investigation leads him to Michael D'Souza, a robber who had robbed Jayaraj shortly before his murder.

It is a quiet town where all the residents know each other and the passage of the \"Bucharest-Sinai\" express train is considered a major event. The express train never stops: it passes through town once in the morning on the way to Sinai, and once during the evening on the way back to Bucharest. The residents of the town regularly congregate at the train station to watch the express pass and to speculate about the faraway lives of the passengers.\nOne evening, the owner of the town's department store Mr. Pascu returns from Bucharest with various specialty orders for the residents. One of the orders is clothing for Mr. Ispas, the head of the train station. Another order is a rare book for Mr. Miroiu, the town's astronomy teacher. Pascu confides to Ispas that Miroiu's book is worth 22,000 lei. When Pascu delivers the order to Miroiu, it turns out that he confused Miroiu's and Ispas' packages. Miroiu rushes to the train station, as Ispas must remain there until the evening \"Bucharest-Sinai\" express passes. They exchange packages, and Miroiu begins leafing through his new book in the station.\nThe \"Bucharest-Sinai\" express arrives and stops at the station, to Ispas' surprise. The conductor calls Ispas on-board to assist him with a stowaway. The stowaway is a young woman in an expensive dress who has no ticket, documents, or money. Ispas and the conductor manage to trick the woman (Mona) off of the train and into the station, and the train departs. Miroiu is heart-struck by Mona. Mona is non-cooperative with Ispas when he attempts to process her as a stowaway. Miroiu offers to house Mona for the night (himself staying at a friend's house) and to return her for processing in the morning, to which Mona reluctantly agrees. Ispas is supportive of the idea, as he wants Mona gone before his wife arrives and misunderstands the situation. Mona and Miroiu leave the station just before Mrs. Ispas arrives. She forces her husband to explain what happened after smelling Mona's perfume in the station office.\nMiroiu shows Mona the town as he escorts her. Mona is unimpressed by the provincial nature of the town and Miroiu's meager home. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ispas runs into Mlle. Cucu (a colleague of Miroiu) at the theater and tells her about the events at the train station. Cucu is upset by the news (it's implied that she is in love with Miroiu). Cucu finds Miroiu's neighbour Mr. Udrea and convinces him to escort her to Miroiu's home, without revealing that it's because she wants to see the mystery woman. When Cucu and Udrea arrive at Miroiu's home, Miroiu has Mona hide in the bathroom. Cucu interrogates Miroiu. Unable to reveal her true feelings when asked why, Cucu instead says that she wants to know where Miroiu acquired 22,000 lei to purchase his new book. Cucu accidentally finds Mona's gloves and runs away in tears. Udrea follows Cucu to escort her home, but not before Miroiu asks him to return afterwards.\nMona overheard everything from the bathroom and asks to see the book. Miroiu accepts because Mona is in town for only one night. The book is a 17th century astronomical treatise, which Miroiu was able to afford by living an intensely frugal lifestyle. Miroiu purchased the book because he believes that he has discovered a new star, and this book contains the only remaining star chart which he has not checked to verify that this is an original discovery. Mona asks to see the star, but Miroiu explains that it's not visible: he discovered it through mathematical reasoning. Mona doubts him, so Miroiu attempts to show her where the star is in the sky from his balcony, but his aggressive explanation frightens her and she retreats back inside the house.\nUdrea returns and Miroiu introduces him. Udrea is the town music teacher and a hobbyist composer. He has written a symphony which he wants to perform, but it requires an English horn which costs 4,500 lei and which the town does not have. At Mona's request, Udrea performs a short version of his symphony using his voice. Miroiu and Udrea attempt to depart to Udrea's house for the night, but Mona requests that Miroiu stay. Mona asks Miroiu to show her his star again. This time, she is awed by his knowledge of astronomy and the beauty of the stars. Miroiu tells Mona that he has not yet chosen a name for his star. They kiss on the balcony and spend the night together.\nThe next morning, Mona tells Miroiu that she intends to stay with him. Miroiu departs to purchase a new dress for her. While he is away, a man named Grig arrives at his house and the details of Mona's life are filled in. Mona has been Grig's lover for three years, though she is more like his pet. The previous night, they were playing roulette at the casino in Sinai. Grig blamed Mona for his poor luck and sent her away to their hotel room. Instead, Mona attempted to run away. Grig tracked her down to Miroiu's house and has arrived to take her home.\nMiroiu returns from the store with a dress. Grig falsely introduces himself as Mona's brother, then sends Miroiu away to exchange the dress, telling him that Mona doesn't like it but is too polite to say so. After Miroiu leaves, Grig insults Miroiu, the town, and the townspeople. Mlle. Cucu arrives, and Grig concentrates his ire on her, using her as a symbol of what Mona will become if she stays. As Cucu attempts to leave, Mona asks her for advice. Hurt, Cucu advises her to leave with Grig and then departs. Mona tells Grig that she doesn't have the strength to resist him. In a last, desperate attempt, Mona asks Grig to abandon her; Grig refuses.\nMr. Udrea arrives. Udrea and Grig go outside to discuss Udrea's symphony after Mona agrees to go with Grig if he pays for Udrea's English horn. When Miroiu returns, Mona tells him that she needs to leave. Miroiu presses her about when she'll return, and but her answers are evasive. Mona suggests that he name his star after her, because just like his star, he won't see her, but he'll know that she exists.\nMona departs with Grig. Udrea returns to tell Miroiu that Grig gave him 5,000 lei to buy an English horn. When Miroiu tells Udrea what happened, Udrea replies that he doesn't think Mona will be back. Miroiu says that he suspected something like this would happen, explaining by quoting an astronomical law which he had previously quoted to Mona: \"No star may deviate from its path\".", "tmdb_id": 89674}, "46877277": {"title": "National Class Category Up to 785 ccm", "plot": "A young man from the suburbs of Belgrade, Floyd, a car racer in the national class, in accordance with his passion, is also considered a great lover.

At the same time, she is attracted to a handsome musician in the group named Jimmy. Soon they are having a passionate love affair, but the music that plays as they make love prevents her from making him another victim of her blood-lust.

Jugulia leads them to the disco, hoping to change Count Dracula's mind when he sees how happy his granddaughter is. However, the Count is infuriated when he sees Nocturna dancing with Jimmy. He places Jimmy under his evil spell, as well as all of the dancers in the disco. Nocturna agrees to leave with her grandfather and return to Transylvania to save her lover's life. Jugulia, a romantic at heart, releases Jimmy from his trance. He is determined to risk his life to save Nocturna and rushes out of the disco.

On his trip, Harker stops at a village inn, where the locals plead for him to stay away from the accursed castle, providing him with details of Dracula's vampirism. Ignoring the villagers' pleas as superstition, Harker continues his journey, ascending the Borgo Pass on foot and eventually arriving at Dracula's castle, where he meets the Count, a strange, almost rodent-like man, with large ears, pale skin, sharp teeth, and long fingernails.\nThe Count is enchanted by a small portrait of Lucy and immediately agrees to purchase the Wismar property, especially with the knowledge that he and Lucy would become neighbors. As Jonathan's visit progresses, he is haunted at night by several dream-like encounters with the vampiric Count. Simultaneously, in Wismar, Lucy is tormented by night terrors, plagued by images of impending doom. Additionally, Renfield is committed to an asylum after biting a cow, apparently having gone completely insane. To Harker's horror, he finds the Count asleep in a coffin, confirming for him that Dracula is indeed a vampire.

Although Isely insists the mill has excellent safety protocols, Verne notices that Maggie's boots have mercury deposits - a mutagen that causes birth defects, it is used in logging as a fungicide and does not show up in water purity tests because it sinks to the bottom. Verne needs more evidence and determines to take blood tests from the Opies.\nThat night, the Nelson family, who have set up a camp in the woods, are killed by Katahdin, which appears as a large bear with one of its sides containing horribly mutated skin. Isely and Sheriff Bartholomew Pilgrim believe Hawks and the Opies are responsible and try to arrest them. However, Hawks escapes. Verne, Maggie, and Ramona take a helicopter to the campsite to investigate the killings. Verne and Ramona find huge scratch marks on the trees, while Maggie finds two mutated bear cubs, one dead and one alive, trapped in a salmon poacher's net. Forced to spend the night in the woods due to inclement weather, they nurse the cub back to health inside one of Hector's tepees. A distressed Maggie explains to Verne about her pregnancy and that she has eaten contaminated fish. Isely and Sheriff Pilgrim arrive and, upon seeing the mutant cub, accept that Hawks and his men are innocent of any crime. Katahdin arrives and attacks the camp in search of her cub. Pilgrim is killed, but the others escape through tunnels beneath Hector's home.\nThe next day, Isely tries to reach a nearby radio tower to call for help, but is killed by Katahdin. Later that night, she attacks the truck in which the others are driving away then decapitates Huntoon while he is strapped to a stretcher. The survivors swim across a lake towards a log cabin as Hector M'Rai gets mauled on the shore while confronting Katahdin. Verne drowns the cub when it attacks Maggie. Katahdin crosses the lake. She kills John Hawks and knocks over the cabin; which injures Ramona and knocks Maggie unconscious. Verne stabs and shoots Katahdin repeatedly, forcing her into the lake where she drowns.

While boating around the Frisian Islands ostensibly correcting antiquated British sea charts of the coastline's shifting topography, by chance he had met a retired German sailor called Dollmann on the yacht Medusa with his wife and daughter, Clara, with whom Davies has initiated a romantic attachment. He narrates further that whilst sailing together along the coast in a gale Dollmann had, when Davies had tried to put into a particular estuary for shelter, inexplicably prevented him from entering by executing a deliberately hazardous sea-manoeuvre, to the degree that both their lives had been endangered by it. Davies then reveals to Carruthers that his real interest in the area is that he suspects that the Imperial German Navy is engaged in covert military activity of some nature in the Frisian Islands, with the intention of threatening the security of the North Sea from the British perspective, which the Royal Navy is strategically misdirected to meet, and he is engaged in trying to discover what it is.

Balboa's girlfriend, Adrian, supports his choice as do his doctors who go on to reveal that Rocky will require surgery for a detached retina, a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response to his question of whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Creed confirms that he did. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his newfound celebrity status.

Upon finding a safe-box containing $1,000, Orrin and Sunday disagree over what to do with the money. Sunday wanting to split the money between the three of them, Orrin wanting to send the money to a relative of those killed, mentioned in a letter found near one of the bodies. Tyrell backs Orrin, which does not sit well with Sunday.  Upon reaching Santa Fe, when Sunday finds out that Orrin (and Tyrell) returned the money, the relationship between him and Orrin slowly disintegrates, with Tyrel caught in the middle (though mostly siding with his brother).\nMeanwhile. while searching for gold in the mountains, Cap and Tell find a lost woman, Ange Kerry (Wendy Rastatter). Ira Bigelow, his brother Jack (Slim Pickens) and their hired men soon arrive and eventually assault Tell's camp, wounding Cap in the leg, and trapping the three of them in the caves, where they hide out.\nBoth Orrin and Sunday run in the election for town sheriff.  Pritts, knowing that if Sunday wins, he will side with Don Luis and the Mexicans, and expecting that he can control Orrin (since Orrin is interested in his daughter) helps Orrin win the election by disclosing that Sunday is a disbarred lawyer and ex-convict from Louisiana. Humiliated, Sunday starts drinking heavily and becomes increasingly hostile towards Orrin.  Sunday accuses Orrin of being bought by Pritts, and slaps Orrin when Orrin calls him a liar.  Later, Orrin sends Tyrell to ask Sunday to be his deputy, but Sunday blames Orrin for ruining his dream of a fresh start in Santa Fe, and angrily refuses the offer.\nDon Luis soon dies. Orrin and Tyrel, now appointed as deputy sheriff, prove that Pritts ordered a Mexican killed, and then ordered another of his men to kill him after he is caught.  Pritts is taken away by the state marshall.  Orrin decides to run for mayor if Tyrel stays as sheriff. As Orrin is announcing his intention to the townspeople in the plaza, Sunday arrives seeking a final confrontation with Orrin.  Tyrel sees him first and stands in his way. When Tyrel refuses to move, Sunday draws his gun. Tyrel draws and shoots Sunday first.  Tyrel weeps as Sunday dies in his arms.\nStill trapped in the caves, and with Cap unable to go far due to his wounded leg, Ange escapes on a stolen horse and wires a message for help to Orrin, while Tell and Cap (when his leg is strong enough) escape back to Purgatorie on foot. The Bigelows and their men catch up to them in town and challenge Tell to a gunfight the next day at daybreak. Orrin and Tyrel receive Ange's telegram and rush to join Tell at Purgatorie.\nThe following day Tell strides out onto the street alone to face the Bigelow gang, now including the last Bigelow brother, Benson (Gene Evans).

If they accept Sudha then she has no problem. Rakesh assures her that there will be no hassles in that but later when Rakesh meets Sudha, he informs her that his parents refused to accept her as his bride but he is willing to marry her. She spurns his offer saying that without his parents blessings, they cannot marry each other.\nRakesh visits Sudha and Saroj frequently and finds that Saroj, who is a chain-smoker and a writer by profession, has coughing bouts very often. He advises Saroj to get admitted for 3 days in his hospital so that he can carry out various tests to ascertain his ailment. Saroj gets admitted though not willingly and finds the hospital confinement, injections and medicines very disgusting. The test reports confirm that he has lung cancer and that too in an advanced stage. When Rakesh breaks this news to Sudha and Saroj, they are shattered. Rakesh assures them that he will do his best to treat Saroj. Sister Mazy (Farida Jalal) is very popular and active in the hospital but has to leave daily at 6 in the evening to meet her boy-friend. One day, she is admitted in the same hospital due to gangrene in her knee. Her leg has to be amputated. One of the patients, Nandlal (Om Puri) is a chain beedi-smoker and is always up to mischief along with fellow patients. He keeps moving around the hospital asking beedis and matches from others. He befriends Saroj and borrows magazines from him for reading. In between, a hooch tragedy occurs and several victims are brought for admission in the hospital. There is a sudden spurt of serious patients and their kith and kin. Several die during treatment and the atmosphere in the hospital is one of grief, trauma and doom. Among the victims is Saroj's close friend Aatish Indori (Bharat Kapoor). Saroj is aggrieved to see his friend die in his arms.\nAs time passes, Saroj's condition worsens and he repeatedly asks Rakesh to poison him to death as he cannot suffer the pain. Rakesh is shocked and gives solace to Saroj to endure and live on. Sudha gives full mental support to Saroj so that he finds reason to live. She beseeches Rakesh to do his best as a doctor. However, Saroj keeps requesting Rakesh to kill him and relieve him from the pain. Rakesh imagines the pain Saroj is undergoing and ponders over mercy-killing. He discusses the matter with his colleagues, who feel shocked at Rakesh's thinking. Saroj asks Sudha to marry someone after his demise and asks her to come to him attired as a bride. She does so and they share very happy moments in each other's arms. Rakesh sees her outside in the corridor coming out of the hospital room in her bridal dress and feels drawn to her and beseeches her to marry him after Saroj's death as he still loves her. She admonishes him for such thinking and goes off in disgust. Next day, she finds Rakesh standing gloomily in the corridor outside Saroj's room. She gets panicky and rushes in to find Saroj's lifeless body in the bed. She suspects Rakesh for killing Saroj.\nPolice come to arrest Rakesh as post-mortem report mentioned that death was due to excessive morphine. The morphine injection ampules issued to Rakesh also seemed to be missing and unaccounted. The scene moves to the court where the Prosecution lawyer (Iftekhar) and Defence attorney (Simi Garewal) examine and cross-examine various witnesses before the judge (Achyut Potdar). The accused Rakesh seems to be sure to get convicted. One day, Nandlal discovers a suicide note written by Saroj to his wife Sudha in the magazine he quietly borrowed from Saroj from under his pillow, when he was asleep. He quickly rushes to the court and hands it over to the Defence attorney. She produces the note before the judge who acquits Rakesh by dismissing the criminal case after going through the note.

This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store.\nP.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law. En route to their home, Susanne and Gerhard stop at a hotel room and have sex. They have been carrying on an affair with sado-masochistic undertones. The Gast family has dinner together: Gerhard, Susanne, her husband Edgar, the caustic grandfather, the delusional pianist grandmother, and the young couple's small son. During dinner Grandpa Gast tells Edgar that every generation needs a war.\nThe terrorists gather at Rudolf's large apartment, but August is annoyed by the presence of Rudolf's roommate Ilse Hoffman, a drug addict. August sees her as a threat to their secret activities. Bored and with not much to do, the group spend their time playing Monopoly. They eagerly await the arrival of a new contact. His name is Paul; he arrives from training camps in Africa where he has gained experience. Paul is assigned to live with Hilde. He rapes her; however, by the following day they have become a couple.\nAugust Brem, the leader among the terrorists, is in fact a double agent. He is secretly in contact with Lurz, who wants to boost sales of his security computers by financing the terrorist group. Rudolf's apartment serves as the terrorist headquarters and meeting point. Claiming domestic abuse, Petra leaves her husband and decides to stay with Rudolf. The group of terrorists is completed with the arrival of two friends of Ilse. One is her former boyfriend, Franz Walsh, a beefy black German who is an explosives expert recently discharged from the military. The other is his friend Bernhard von Stein, an aristocrat whose fondness for the works of Bakunin makes him the object of jokes. Franz fails to find a job, but reconnects with his drug addict girlfriend Ilse.\nAugust gives out paper squares to the group, some of which bear a mark and some not. Petra, Rudolf and Hilde receive those with the marks; they must break into an office at night in order to steal the new identities. Rudolf is so scared that he pees in his pants and the others laugh at him. The joke is short-lived because Franz finds Ilse dead of a drug overdose.\nThe tension among the conspirators gets even worse when Paul is gunned down by the authorities at a restaurant. Edgar witnesses his death and sees his father, Officer Gast, at the scene. Paul's death scares the members of his gang. In order to finance their activities, Petra and some of the other terrorists rob the very bank in which Petra's husband works. While they are escaping, Petra shoots and kills her husband. They frantically change their looks and names and flee from their homes.\nBernhard is interrogated by Officer Gast as to their whereabouts. Bernhard genuinely does not know but gets curious and follows August undetected. He sees Lurz give money to August in order to finance the terrorist activities. After Paul's death, the terrorists believe that there is a traitor among them. August makes the others think that it was Franz. August sets up Franz by telling him where Ilse is buried. He then calls the authorities and gets him killed. August also does the same to Petra when she is instructed to place a bomb and gets intercepted and killed by the police. Bernhard is caught by Officer Gast at the cemetery when he tries to warn Franz that it is a set-up and tells him not to go to Ilse's grave. Bernhard tells Officer Gast what he saw at the Japanese restaurant; after they argue, Bernhard falls down a long flight of stairs and is killed. The remaining terrorists, taking advantage of the carnival season to wear elaborate costumes as disguises, kidnap P.J. Lurz. He is videotaped in a basement. He still believes that all is part of his secret plan and smiles to the camera.", "tmdb_id": 122683}, "37558291": {"title": "Thirisoolam", "plot": "Rajasekaran is an upright businessman whose associates are involved in shady deals.

After he explains how it works (including a \"non-return key\" that keeps the machine at the traveler's destination and a \"vaporizing equalizer\" that keeps the traveler and machine on equal terms), police constables  arrive at the house searching for Jack the Ripper. A bag with blood-stained gloves belonging to one of Herbert's friends, a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson, leads them to conclude that Stevenson might be the infamous killer. Wells races to his laboratory, but the time machine is gone.\nStevenson has escaped to the future, but because he does not have the \"non-return\" key, the machine automatically returns to 1893. Herbert uses it to pursue Stevenson to November 5, 1979, where the machine has ended up on display at a museum in San Francisco. He is deeply shocked by the future, having expected it to be an enlightened socialist utopia, only to find chaos in the form of airplanes, automobiles and a worldwide history of war, crime and bloodshed.\nAt an antique shop, Herbert exchanges some British bank notes for present-day American money. Growing hungry after a day without food, he enters a McDonald's and is alternately puzzled and pleased with 1979 dining options, noting the similarity between 1890s pommes frites from France and modern French fries. Wells is still ruffled by the idea of dining without tableware.\nReasoning that Stevenson would also need to exchange his British money, Herbert asks about him at various banks. At the Chartered Bank of London, he meets employee Amy Robbins, who says she had directed Stevenson to a local hotel.\nConfronted by his one-time friend Herbert, Stevenson confesses that he finds modern society to be pleasingly violent, stating: \"Ninety years ago, I was a freak. Today, I'm an amateur.\"\nHerbert demands he return to 1893 to face justice, but Stevenson instead attempts to wrestle the time machine's key from him. Their struggle is interrupted by a maid and Stevenson flees, getting hit by a car during the frantic chase. Herbert follows him to the hospital emergency room and mistakenly gets the impression that Stevenson has died from his injuries.\nHerbert meets up with Amy Robbins again and she initiates a romance. Stevenson returns to the bank to exchange more money. Suspecting that it was Amy who had led Herbert to him, he finds out where she lives.\nHerbert, hoping to convince her of the truth, takes a highly skeptical Amy three days into the future. Once there, she is aghast to see a newspaper headline revealing her own murder as the Ripper's fifth victim.\nHerbert persuades her that they must go back \u2013 it is their duty to attempt to prevent the fourth victim's murder, then prevent Amy's. However, they are delayed upon their return to the present and can do no more than phone the police. Stevenson kills again, and Herbert is arrested because of his knowledge of the killing. Amy is left alone, totally defenseless, and at the mercy of the \"San Francisco Ripper\".\nWhile Herbert unsuccessfully tries to convince the police of Amy's peril, she attempts to hide from Stevenson. When the police finally do investigate her apartment, they find the dismembered body of a woman. Now convinced of Herbert's innocence, the police release a now-heartbroken Wells. However, he is contacted by Stevenson, who had actually killed Amy's coworker (revealed to be the dead body in Amy's apartment) and taken Amy hostage in order to extort the time machine key from Wells.\nStevenson flees with the key \u2013 and Amy as insurance \u2013 to attempt a permanent escape in the time machine. Using Amy's car, driving the unfamiliar machine erratically, Herbert manages to follow them back to the museum. While Herbert bargains for Amy's life, she is able to escape. As Stevenson starts up the time machine, Herbert removes the \"vaporizing equalizer\" from it, causing Stevenson to vanish while the machine does not. As Herbert had explained earlier, this causes the machine to remain in place while its passenger is sent traveling endlessly through time with no way to stop; in effect, he is destroyed.\nHerbert proclaims that the time has come to return to his own time, in order to destroy a machine that he now knows is too dangerous for primitive mankind. Amy pleads with him to take her along, explaining she has no remaining ties in the 20th century. The film ends with the caption: \"H.G. Wells married Amy Catherine Robbins, who died in 1927.

Oskar is the son of a half-Polish Kashubian woman, Agnes Bronski, who is married to a German chef named Alfred Matzerath but secretly carrying on an affair with Jan, a Polish Post Office worker and her cousin. The two men are great friends, but Alfred is blissfully unaware of his wife's infidelity. Oskar's parentage is uncertain; though he himself believes he is Jan's son.\nFlashbacks reveal his mother's conception by his grandfather Joseph Kolaizcek, a petty criminal in rural Kashubia (located in modern-day Poland). He hides underneath the skirts of a young woman named Anna Bronski. He has sex with her and she tries to hide her emotions, as the troops pass close by. She later gives birth to their daughter, who is Oskar's mother. Joseph evades the authorities for a year, but when they find him again, he either drowns or escapes to America and becomes a millionaire.\nIn 1927, on Oskar's third birthday, he is given a tin drum. Reflecting on the foolish antics of his drunken parents and friends, he resolves to stop growing and throws himself down the cellar stairs. From that day on, he does not grow at all. Oskar discovers that he can shatter glass with his voice, an ability he often uses whenever he is upset. Oskar's drumming also causes the members of a Nazi rally to start dancing. During a visit to the circus, Oskar befriends Bebra, a performing dwarf who chose to stop growing at age 10.\nWhen Alfred, Agnes, Jan and Oskar are on an outing to the beach, they see an eel-picker collecting eels from a horse's head used as bait. The sight makes Agnes vomit repeatedly. Alfred buys some of the eels and prepares them for dinner that night. When he insists that Agnes eat them, she becomes distraught and retreats to the bedroom. Jan enters and comforts her, all within earshot of Oskar who is hiding in the closet. She calmly returns to the dinner table and eats the eels. Over the next few days, she binges on fish. Anna Bronski helps reveal that Agnes is worried her pregnancy is due to her relations with Jan. In anger, Agnes vows that the child will never be born. She dies shortly thereafter, seemingly from the accumulated stress.\nAt the funeral, Oskar encounters Sigismund Markus, the kindly Jewish toy seller who supplies him with replacement drums, and who was also in love with Agnes. Markus is ordered by two of the mourners to leave because he is Jewish; Nazism is on the rise, and the Jewish and Polish residents of Danzig are under increasing pressure. Markus later commits suicide after his shop is vandalized and a synagogue is burned down by SA men.\nOn 1 September 1939, Oskar and Jan go looking for Kobyella, who can repair his drum. Jan slips into the Polish Post Office, despite a Nazi cordon, and participates in an armed standoff against the Nazis. During the ensuing battle, Kobyella is fatally shot and Jan is wounded. They play Skat until Kobyella dies and the Germans capture the building. Oskar is taken home, while Jan is arrested and later executed.\nAlfred hires sixteen-year-old Maria to work in his shop. Oskar seduces Maria, but later discovers Alfred having sex with her. Oskar bursts into the room, makes Alfred ejaculate inside her (when he was expected to pull out, to avoid getting her pregnant), causing Maria to become angry at Alfred when he blames Oskar for the inadvertent insemination.\nWhile rinsing her vagina in an attempt to remove the deposited semen, she and Oskar fight, and he hits her in the groin. She later gives birth to a son, who Oskar is convinced is his. Oskar also has a brief sexual relationship with Lina Greff, the wife of the local grocer and scoutmaster. It is implied that Lina was sexually frustrated as her husband preferred to spend more time with the Hitler Youth boys. Lina's husband later commits suicide (or is executed) after an official from the Nazi regime catches him 'playing' with those boys.\nDuring World War II, Oskar meets Bebra and Roswitha, another dwarf performer in Bebra's successful troupe. Oskar decides to join them, using his glass-shattering voice as part of the act. Oskar and Roswitha have an affair, but she is killed by artillery fire during the Allied invasion of Normandy while on tour.\nOskar returns home. Much of the city has been destroyed and the Russians are fast approaching. Oskar gives Maria's three-year-old son Kurt a tin drum like his own. The Russians break into the cellar where the family is hiding. Some of them gang-rape Lina. Alfred is killed by a soldier after swallowing and choking violently on his Nazi party pin. Later Matzerath's shop goes to Mariusz Fajngold, a Jewish survivor of Treblinka who also takes care of Alfred's funeral.\nDuring Alfred's burial, Oskar decides to grow up, and throws his drum into the grave.

A seamstress stands up, taps on the metal light shade, and the light comes back on, but Mr. Feldman, a foreman, yells at her for not working. Lou, one of the fabric cutters, pushes fabric scraps off the cutting table, into an overflowing waste bin, and pieces drop to the floor. Feldman comes over, yells about scraps on the floor, and Lou says they need to have the scraps removed, for they are a safety hazard. He also states he knows a bribe was paid to the fire marshal. Feldman tells him to stop causing trouble.\nWorkers talk about going to that evening\u2019s engagement party for Vinnie, a mechanic, and Connie, a seamstress. Though about to be married Vinnie flirts with Gina, a new worker. Sonya wants to go to the party, but she is Jewish, and has to go to temple that evening. Her friend Florence, who wants to marry a millionaire, tells her she can tell her family she is sick, and then sneak off to the party.\nWhen the work day ends the inside factory doors are unlocked, and the women workers line up to have their handbags searched before they can leave. Mr. Feldman reports to the factory owners how much work was produced that day. One of the owners complains about the high cost of doing business, and he includes the bribes regularly paid to the police, safety and fire inspectors as one of his costly expenses.That evening, at temple, Sonya tells her mother she isn\u2019t feeling well, and she is told to go home and rest.

When the headache ceases, she finds herself still up in the attic and in the dress, but the attic is now an artist's studio, complete with Victorian decor. She hears a woman scream and a man's voice downstairs yelling, \"Pamela.\" Terrified, Jennie shuts her eyes and finds herself back in the present.\nAt first she assumes she was dreaming or hallucinating, yet Jennie experiences further similar episodes. She decides to learn more about her new house and goes to the local historical museum, where an elderly curator named Mrs. Bates explains to her that the house belonged to artist David Reynolds in the year 1899. She explains how David claimed to have seen the ghost of his dead wife several times and called out to her, but she disappeared each time. David died under mysterious circumstances on the night of the turn of the century.

Initially, he only has three contacts in Seoul: Park Mu, the chief press officer for the Republic of Korea Army, Janet O'Neill, the wife of senior American intelligence official Dr. Kelton, and Lee Hong-sik, his handler, through whom Yu also runs into his old lover Kim Soon-hee, who is apparently employed by the United States Counter Intelligence Corps, and is introduced to Colonel Klaus. Yu begins gathering intelligence on a coup plot by rightist South Korean general Sin Jae-sin. Lee helps him pass back this information to North Korea using his unwitting friend Kim Su-gyong as a courier. Lee is suspected by a US counter intelligence agent Martin who found Lee takes care of homeless kids. Soon after, Lee is killed in a shootout with CIC agents, including Kim Soon-hee, leaving Yu unable to pass his crucial intelligence back to his government. Yu calls Lee from a bar, but after realizing the person on the other end of the line is not Lee, hangs up immediately. A waitress in that bar is subsequently arrested and tortured by Colonel Klaus, who learns that a man suspected to be Yu was seen making the phone call.Yu flees to a Hong Kong safe house run by a North Korean singer. He is instructed to return to Seoul and contact an agent code-named White Horse. However, he is suspicious of White Horse and sets a trap for him which reveals that he is working with Colonel Klaus. White Horse is then killed by an unknown person. Yu obtained the information from Janet O'Neill that John Foster Dulles is visiting Europe to get reinforcements. Yu meets Lewis, an army lieutenant, and converts him to Communism to relay this information; Lewis stages his own kidnapping so that he can disappear to the North for training, and later returns to Seoul. Two months later, Yu receives a coded message on Voice of Korea instructing him to contact an agent named Diamond, who turns out to be his old lover Kim Soon-hee, ostensibly working for the Americans, but really a double agent for North Korean intelligence. With Dulles's agenda exposed to the media, the US plans a battle to demonstrate their superiority, but Yu obtains this information from Park Mu. The Americans fail to get more reinforcements from their European allies and are defeated by a well prepared Korean People's Army.Yu continues to gather intelligence on General Sin's coup attempt, this time passing messages back to Pyongyang by way of a radio operator disguised as a disabled veteran who begs outside hotels. Yu hides messages in cigarette filters, which he then throws on the ground near the beggar. However, he is unaware that he is being followed by the CIC, who are filming his activities. Colonel Klaus hears about a North Korean spy disguised as a veteran, and begins reviewing video tapes to check on Yu's activities. Kim saves the day by cutting the scenes out of the tapes to avoid further suspicion falling on Yu, but the disappearance of the scenes triggers Klaus' suspicion towards Kim herself. Klaus stages a test of loyalty for her, in which she is kidnapped and threatened with execution by American agents in Hokkaid\u014d, Japan pretending to be Communists; however, Kim correctly senses this is a trap, and escapes by killing the agents.Park Mu realizes that Yu and Kim are spies.

His colleague, an enigmatic Christ-like figure, tells his bald pupils about the centuries-long cosmic conflict between Zatteen, an evil inter-spatial force of immense magnitude with powerful psychic abilities, and his benevolent arch-rival Yahweh. Zatteen escaped to the planet Earth centuries ago, and though he was eventually tracked down and killed by Yahweh, his spirit lives on in the minds of mankind, waiting for an opportunity to reemerge and wreak havoc. The figure tells his disciples that Zatteen had produced dozens of children with human women before his death, and these descendants continue to populate the Earth.\nDuring a professional basketball game at The Omni in Atlanta, home team owner Raymond Armstead sits courtside and promises an interviewer that the team will win at all costs. Since Raymond is a new owner and the source of his wealth is unknown, the interviewer presses him on the source of his wealth. He eventually answers that the money comes \"from God\". Raymond is in league with a secret group of Satanists who wish to bring about the resurgence of Zatteen. His associate Dr. Walker reminds him that his girlfriend Barbara Collins can be used as a conduit to distill Zatteen's powers into a corporeal, human form. Her 8-year old daughter Katy has already displayed psychokinetic abilities, and it's the Satanists' goal to have Raymond father a male child with Barbara, who in turn will mate with his half-sister and produce the physical embodiment of Zatteen.\nKaty is only partially aware of her powers, and she experiments with them throughout the film, most notably helping Raymond's basketball team to victory. Colsowicz, who possesses powers similar to Katy, is sent to Earth by the Christ-like figure with several of his disciples, where at first they survey her from a distance. He's also acquainted with Barbara's new maid, Jane Phillips, who instantly sees the potential evil inherent in Katy, as she had once had a child with the same abilities. Katy begins using her powers to facilitate the Satanists' goals, causing a series of fatal accidents to happen to their enemies. Barbara is inadvertently paralyzed by a gunshot wound, and becomes relegated to a wheelchair. A police detective, Jake Durham, investigating the deaths is killed in a car accident facilitated by the Satanists.\nRaymond fails to seduce Barbara, and the Satanists decide to proceed with other, more violent methods. Barbara does get pregnant after the intervention, but is still afraid of having another child and has her ex, Katy's biological father, Dr. Sam Collins, abort the baby. When she returns home, she is attacked for her actions by Raymond and Katy, who attempt to execute her by tying a wire around her neck and sending her down the stairs in her chair lift.

The next day, the other Satanists are found dead at their round table, presumably by Colsowicz's intervention.\nColsowicz returns to the Christ-like figure and his apostles.

Cerutti claims that Pa spent millions of dollars to support his son's presidency because it benefited him financially, but he was displeased by the president's liberal politics and so it was Pa who had him killed. Pa created an elaborate hoax to confuse Nick, including the employment of an actress named Jenny O'Brien to play the role of Yvette.

Tuomola tells Olli to stop his work, but Paavola (Ville Salminen), the bank manager who controls the company's finances, is enthusiastic about Olli's program and supports him.\nAt the company party, Olli causes aggravation and they try to keep him out of Paavola's way. However, the men meet again each other. In the following days, Olli begins to behave in a completely new, liberated way: he escapes from Tuomola's hands and also rejects the attempts of his colleague Ronkainen (Paavo Piskonen) and the ambitious secretary, economist Tuula Korkeam\u00e4ki (Tarja-Tuulikki Tarsala), to get him to return to work. Instead, he meets Anneli (Saara Pakkasvirta), an uncomplicated woman who works as a bartender, in a middle-class beer bar and starts living with her. One day, Olli finds a landlord in Anneli's apartment (Markku Blomqvist), who for half a year has been waiting in vain for the rent payment \"in nature\".\nOlli and Anneli plan to run away together, but while applying for a final account from the company, Olli is arrested and sent to treatment; Anneli waits for him in vain. Paavola and Korkeam\u00e4ki plot together against Tuomola and the man is transferred to early retirement after 30 years of service. Olli runs away from the hospital, buys himself a pair of clothes from a department store, refusing to pay for them; he also refuses to pay in the tram, throws the driver out and starts driving the trolley at high speed on his own. While staying at home, Olli learns that the psychiatrist Veijalainen (Jukka Sipil\u00e4) who treated him is now mentally ill himself and that his classmates from Buffalo have also lost their minds.\nOlli returns to the management of the company and celebrates in a restaurant with his wife (Maija Karhi), Paavola and Korkeam\u00e4ki. At the bar, he meets Anneli, who first teases the man and then goes on another runaway trip with him. At the railway station, they meet Tuomola, who says that he is traveling to the forest and begins to give a working-class monologue about freedom and the possibilities of people's power to passers-by at the station square. In the station tunnel, they follow the antics of the youth: one boy kicks the other's bum, and Anneli says that it is her own son, whom she was not allowed to raise.\nIn the morning, Olli and Anneli hitchhike along the country roads and get a ride to Kotka. They go to the ship, where Anneli meets her old friends and colleagues. However, Olli immediately begins to rationalize and manage the sailors' work.
