I'll take care of any tickets!\".  When he arrives, he sneaks in the window and takes his place in the Baby's bed.\nAs the three Bears are cycling home, Papa Bear imitates a police car siren, but can't contain his laughter because it sounds so corny, so Mama slaps him in the face from behind.

Have gone to Three Bears' house to eat up Little Goldilocks. Love, the Wolf\".  Red immediately goes to the telephone and starts dialing. As sleepy little Golilocks (presumably from eating 3 big bowls of porridge) is climbing the stairs, the phone rings. She runs back down stairs and answers the phone. It's Red calling to warn her about the Wolf.  She passes the note to Goldilocks over the split frame and as she finishes reading the note, she shakes Red's hand and says, \"Gee, thanks a lot!

From the liberals, from crown prince Frederich (who is shown as an English puppet) and the French who attempt to annex the left bank of the Rhine.  The historical feature opens in 1862 with King Wilhelm I appointing Bismarck as head of the Prussian government. With Germany divided into 35 different political entities and power transferred to various principalities, the nation is portrayed as desperately longing for national unity. The Austrian Kaiser, also wishing unity, appears unconcerned with the northern province. His  interest rests in asserting control over the German Confederation. Wilhelm I, unable to control the parliament, is on the verge of abdication. The crown prince and his English wife wish the installation of a British style government which may undermine German unity. The king's last resort is the appointment of Bismarck as his Prime Minister. Bismarck's first political act is to dissolve the Prussian parliament following the refusal of an opposition leader, Virchow, to finance military reform and rearmament plans.\nFrom 1864 to 1871, Bismarck wages several wars against Denmark, Austria, and France. According to his main political principle; the most decisive political questions are not solved by parliamentary discussions and resolutions but by \"Eisen und Blut\", Iron (weaponry) and blood alone. The film concludes with the 1871 proclamation of a new German Empire at the Hall Of Mirrors in Versailles. United under the leadership of Prussia, the new nation is armed with a strong military force built to withstand powerful and malevolent neighbours.\nArmed forces victories are depicted as the handiwork of one great man; the Battle of K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz is viewed solely the work of General Moltke. There are no battlefield recreations.The storyline blends history with Third Reich era propaganda such as the assassination attempt on Bismarck by Ferdinand Cohen-Blind, who the film calls, an \"English Jew\", heroically stopped by Bismarck, unscathed by bullets. Spending a few years in England, his motives are questioned  over his loyalty in preservation of the German state.  Surreptitiously viewing an \"evil Jew\" attempt to halt German unity, there is also an underlying twin theme of the disruption of  German Politics by the English. Bismarck believes this to be a sign from god that he is destined to unite Germany.\nReleased in the wake of the 1939 Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, it depicts a parallel view to  Bismarck's that a Russian alliance will safeguard the Prussians in the east.", "tmdb_plot": "A biographical film of Otto von Bismarck, the Prime Minister of Prussia, and how he and his policies - including aggressive war - helped to unite Germany.", "tmdb_id": "273130", "wiki_id": "28874134"}, {"title": "Bitter Sweet", "genres": ["Drama", "Music", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Set in late 19th century Vienna, the story focuses on the romance between music teacher Carl Linden (Nelson Eddy) and his prize pupil Sarah Milick (Jeanette MacDonald).", "tmdb_plot": "In order to avoid an arranged marriage with a man she doesn't love, Sarah Millick runs off to Vienna with her music teacher, Carl Linden, whom she does love.

Emil von Behring, whom Dr. Ehrlich meets and befriends, while experimenting with his staining techniques, is impressed with Dr. Ehrlich's staining methods and refers to it as 'specific staining,' adding that this is one of the greatest achievements in science, especially for diagnostic purposes, based on optical microscopy. After attending a medical presentation of one Dr. Robert Koch showing that tuberculosis is a bacterial disease, Ehrlich is able to obtain a sample of the isolated bacterium. After an intense time of research and experimentation in his own lab, paired with a portion of luck, partly thanks to the empathy shown by his wife, he is able to develop a staining process for this bacterium. This result is honored by Koch and medical circles as a highly valuable contribution to diagnostics.\nDuring his work, Dr. Ehrlich is infected with tuberculosis, a disease still known as being deadly.

The chaplain, Father Francis P. Duffy (Pat O'Brien) believes there to be something more in the young man and begs the 69th's commanding officer Major \"Wild Bill\" Donovan (George Brent) to give Plunkett one more chance. Donovan reluctantly agrees and when the 69th is ordered to send a squad into no man's land to capture German soldiers for intel, Donovan orders Plunkett to join them.\nPlunkett's inexperience and nervousness lead to him accidentally disclosing the squad's position and leads to the deaths of two well respected soldiers Lieutenant \"Long John\" Wynn (Dick Foran) and Private Timothy \"Timmy\" Wynn (William Lundigan). Donovan is outraged and ultimately orders Plunkett to be court-martialed. However, while he is awaiting execution, Fr Duffy approaches Plunkett in one last attempt to save him spiritually. Plunkett begs the priest to release him so he can desert the army and escape the war. Fr Duffy declines his request and when his jail cell is destroyed by a German shell and he is freed, Plunkett witnesses Father Duffy ministering to several wounded troops, urging them to keep their faith and have courage.\nShamed and inspired by Donovan's forbearance and courage, Plunkett decides to rejoin his unit at the front and support their advance. However, when he catches up with the 69th he spots that the battalion has been stopped by a fierce German bombardment. Coming across a mortar whose crew have almost all been killed, he finds Sgt. \"Big Mike\" Wynn and implores the older man to tell him how to operate the mortar. Sgt. Wynn initially refuses as he recalls how Plunkett had caused the death of his two brothers in an earlier encounter with the enemy.\nPlunkett though perseveres and starts to use the mortar to counter the German bombardment and allow the 69th to push ahead with the advance. The Germans though counter and throw a grenade into the trench where Plunkett and Sgt. Wynn are.

The cartoon is narrated by Robert C. Bruce.\nThe first nursery rhyme is Mary, Mary Quite Contrary as played by Katharine Hepburn. The narrator speaks the first line of the rhyme: \"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary----how does your garden grow?\" to which Mary replies \"I'm terribly sorry, but confidentially, it stinks.\" (a reference to a line from the 1938 comedy film You Can't Take It with You). It is then revealed that the garden is full of litter, trash and filth\nThe page turns to Humpty Dumpty. Humpty, like the rhyme says, falls off the wall and appears unharmed. However, when he gets up it is revealed that his butt cheeks are exposed.\nThe next page shows Jack and Jill as teen sweethearts. As the narrator recites the rhyme, Jack and Jill go behind the well. The narrator is stumped and repeats \"to fetch a pail of water\" but nothing happens. The narrator does it again and Jack comes down with lipstick kiss marks on his face and says \"The heck with the water\" and runs back behind the well.\nIn the next scene, the rhyme is Little Miss Muffet. As the spider prepares to pounce on Little Miss Muffet, her unprepossessing looks frighten the arachnid off.\nThe scene is moved along to The Three Little Pigs. The pigs scurry into the house and the Big Bad Wolf. As the Wolf starts to blow the house down, one of the pigs opens the door and hands him a bottle of Histerine (a parody of Listerine). The wolf, now upset, yells \"Why don't some of my best friends tell me these things!\" and takes a dose of the mouth rinse.\nThe next scene involves the Parade of Wooden Soldiers. The narrator compliments the uniform marching but it is soon revealed that they are walking rather sloppily and are all wobbly. (A gag reused from Detouring America)\nIt then takes the story to Star Light, Star Bright with a dog that wishes for a tree.\nThe next rhyme is Jack Be Nimble as Jack jumps over the candlestick. He then brags \"Aww, there's nothin' to it. Just fast. Speedy, that's me. Flames didn't even touch me\". As Jack turns and walks away his butt has actually been burned by the candle.\nThe Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe struggles to take care of her kids and the camera then pans over to her husband who is sitting in a chair relaxing while reading a newspaper as the song \"What's The Matter with Father\" plays in the background.\nThe next scene features Little Hiawatha. Hiawatha then shoots his arrow into the air like the poem implies. Soon an eagle lands next to Hiawatha and returns his arrow that apparently hit him in the tail feather.\nThe final rhyme in the short is The Night Before Christmas. Inside a house two mice are apparently still stirring. The first mouse whispers, \"Merry Christmas\".

She makes her way through an abandoned mining town to get to a nearby ranch, owned by a well-educated but rude and inhospitable young man named Bill Anders. Anders is a recluse by choice; his only company is hired hand Fred Gubbins, who is even more misanthropic than his boss.\nAnders warms to the idea of Maisie spending the night while they make up the bed in the guest room. Maisie recognizes the look in his eye. He brings in a bottle and two glasses, and Maisie tell him she never drinks. He keeps pushing, preparing to make a heavy pass, but Maisie tricks him into leaving the room and locks the door. When he threatens to break in, she is not afraid\u2014she says she has left a trail of broken heads \"all over the United States, Canada and points west.\"\nIn the morning, Maisie sees Anders working on her car and makes breakfast\u2014only to learn that the men have been up for hours and have already eaten. They try unsuccessfully to get her car started, and she sets off for Truxton on foot. Days later, she finally arrives at the caf\u00e9, riding in a wagon driven by a kind old codger, only to find that her job has been given to a hula dancer \"in cellophane spinach.\"\nMaisie stops to eat in Harry's greasy spoon. The whole town is buzzing with news of a gold strike not far away, and everyone who can is going there. Harry Gilpin wants to join the rush, but his nagging wife won't let him. A young girl named Jubie Davis comes in and asks Harry to warm up a baby's bottle. He tells her to go away, but Maisie shames him into helping her. Jubie's family is heading for the gold fields, Maisie looks at the pictures in the paper and recognizes the ghost town next to Bill's ranch, and after fending off a lecherous truck driver who wants to give her a lift, heads back there, on foot, figuring that there will be places where she can get a job entertaining the miners. In any case, her car is still there.\nThe Davis family\u2014mother Sarah, father Bert, Jubie, her always-hungry little brother Harold and baby Gladys\u2014picks her up on the road. They were farmers in Arkansas, victims of the Dust Bowl and Depression who first became tenants on their own land and then lost the farm completely, joining the masses of displaced people moving from state to state to state, from one seasonal picking job to another, with everything they possess stowed in their car. Maisie says to Anders later that she has never known that people had to live like this. She is moved by their kindness and gentle optimism, particularly by the patience and fortitude of Sarah, who quietly goes hungry for the sake of her family, and dreams of having a home so the children can get an education.\nThe old ghost town is unrecognizable. The streets are packed with people, wagons and trucks and horses. The general store has been put to rights and is piled high with canned goods, selling at exorbitant prices. Maisie spends $5.25 ($102 today) to buy groceries for the family, delighting Harold with a can of pork and beans all his own. Several enterprising men have staked claims on large tracts of land, securing everything that is near water, but they aren't digging for gold\u2014they are digging into the already empty pockets of the prospectors by charging $5 to camp. Maisie also learns that there will be no singing jobs in this mining camp. The people here are almost all at the ends of their ropes.\nAs Davis drives further down the road, Maisie sees Anders\u2019 big new No Trespassing sign. She takes the Davis family to the ranch to camp and won't take no for an answer from Anders. She is outraged to find that Gubbins has dismantled her car to build a wagon (without telling Anders). She gets $10 ($193 today) from Anders to compensate her for the car, which should get her started back to Phoenix, but to Jubie's delight Maisie agrees to go partners in prospecting with Davis. Maisie sleeps with Sarah, Jubie and Gladys in their tent, and hears Sarah praying late at night, \"Please make it soon.\"\nIt turns out that there are several families in the camp who are friends and former neighbors of the Davises. Most of them have found gold and are waiting to learn the value of their claims. Maisie and Davis dig for days without finding anything, but suddenly they strike it, when Maisie loses her temper and wallops the top off an outcropping. Davis plans to buy Sarah a washing machine; Harold wants chocolate candy, chocolate sodas and strawberry pop. There is a dance party to celebrate. Like Bert, many of the men plan to sell their claims to a mining company and start life again with \u201ca nice piece of ground.\u201d All must wait for the assayer to arrive and establish the value of their claims.\nIn the middle of the night, a violent storm comes in over the ranch, destroying the family's tent and soaking everyone, forcing them to take refuge in Ander's house, very much against his will. Gubbins holds a gun on them at first, but Maisie will have none of that. After the family is safely tucked away for the night, Maisie asks Bill for a hot lemonade \"without the spike.\" She gets out of her wet clothes and wraps herself up in a bathrobe, and Anders brings the drink to her. She can smell the alcohol and refuses. He insists she drink it to keep from getting pneumonia. It takes effect quickly: She tells Anders some things he needs to hear, and learns something about him in turn, as she is more and more under the influence. She assumes that he is miserable because of a woman, but that is not the case. The trouble, never explained, had something to do with his stepfather and brother. \u201cA couple of wrong guys made you swear off the human race.\u201d He accuses her of being \"the little friend of all the world\" (a phrase used to describe Rudyard Kipling's Kim) \"just nuts about everybody.\" She denies this. She can spot a phony from a mile away with the sun in her eyes and can hate one too with all she's got, but when she runs across swell people, she is nuts about them. She recommends the company of nice people to Anders. Realizing that she is about to fall asleep, she thanks him for everything, for being \"awfully awfully awfully kind in a nasty way\" and curls up on the sofa.

Soon she finds out that the Royal Court has sentenced her, with the assent of Queen Elizabeth I, to be executed on the scaffold on the following day. She breaks down and remembers the events leading to her now imminent death. The bulk of the film consists of this flashback.\nThe young Mary arrives from France to Scotland, as the lawful queen of Scots, only to encounter a strong opposition. Her half-brother, Jacob Stuart, who had ruled the country until then, asserts that a woman is incapable of ruling the \"rough\" and \"male\" land of Scotland and that she should have remained in \"feminine\" France. The lords, headed by Lord Bothwell, face Mary Stuart critically. Moreover, immediately upon her arrival, Mary faces an assassination attempt with poisoned wine by Johanna (Jean) Gordon, whose Clan Gordon was at feud with the Stuarts for many years.\nMembers of the Privy Council, whom Mary summons to deal with the first political decisions to be announced, do not show up. The only one present is Jacob Stuart, who tears up the document presented for his signature. When the queen is alone again, Lord Bothwell arrives and confesses that he had fallen in love with her. Mary Stuart orders him arrested for insulting the queen, even though she is impressed by his demeanor.\nMeanwhile, Queen Elizabeth I, angered that with a lawful Catholic queen taking over Scotland will limit her influence there and threaten her right to the throne in England, sends to Scotland her confidant Henry Darnley, who is both an English peer and a Scottish lord, to spy for her and to raise the population against Mary Stuart.\nNevertheless, Darnley falls in love with Queen Mary and leads her to Lord Bothwell's castle, where the Scottish lords meet secretly to plot the queen's deposition. Mary ventures alone into the meeting and becomes imprisoned.\nShe is released the next day, but only after having been made to swear an oath that she would marry a Scot. Mary Stuart's choice falls on Lord Bothwell, whom she believes to be still in captivity. It turns out, however, that he had fled with Jean Gordon and has married her. The two of them raise an army with the aim of overthrowing Mary. Jean wants revenge on the queen and the Stuarts, and Lord Bothwell wants power.\nThe queen is constrained to marry Lord Darnley, but becomes involved with the Italian singer David Riccio. Eventually, she gives birth to a boy child, James, the future King James I.\nA troupe of itinerant actors stages a play hinting broadly that Riccio is the queen's lover and might be the father of her child. Lord Darnley feels mocked and indignant and therefore authorizes a plot in which Riccio is assassinated.\nAt this time Lord Bothwells' army appears, which the queen allows to enter Lord Bothwell's castle and temporarily take over power in the land \"for the queen's own protection\". However, Lord Darnley has fallen ill with smallpox. On the advice of Lord Bothwell, now her lover, Mary has her ill husband brought to Edinburgh, where he dies in an explosion at his home.\nNow Queen Elizabeth sends an army to Scotland to release Mary Stuart from the power of Bothwell and to offer to her refuge in England, which is actually a trap meant to imprison Mary and keep her away from the throne of Scotland.\nMeanwhile, Mary Stuart had married Lord Bothwell, who had separated from Jean Gordon. The wedding is interrupted when the English army appears under the guidance of Jacob Stuart, the queen's half-brother, who presents secret love letters which Mary Stuart had sent to Bothwell while still married to her previous husband. Olivier, the queen's page, is killed while attempting to hide the letters.\nLord Bothwell is faced with the choice of standing by Mary Stuart and dying or denying her. He turns away from her, but the treacherous Jacob Stuart still sentences him to death by dragging (in actual history he fled to Denmark where the king treated him cruelly and where he eventually died in prison; all of which is not mentioned in the film). When Jacob Stuart takes her child James to protect him from Queen Elizabeth, Mary Stuart accepts the offer of the English queen and goes into exile in England, which sets up her path to the scaffold.\nThe frame story from the beginning resumes. Mary makes peace with dying and pledges her undying devotion to her ladies-in-waiting, the people of Scotland, and the many men she loved and lost.

Lacking funds even to purchase coronation gifts for the Duchess (Hilde von Stolz), the Duke sends a courtier to Frankfurt to borrow money from Joseph S\u00fc\u00df Oppenheimer (Ferdinand Marian). S\u00fc\u00df shows the emissary jewels and jewelry that are obviously beyond the Duke's means and then says that it would be his honor to provide the Duke with jewelry at a substantial discount. However, S\u00fc\u00df insists on presenting the items to the Duke personally despite the Judensperre \u2014 a ban against Jews entering the city \u2014 that has been in force for over a century. Armed with a pass from the Duke, S\u00fc\u00df cuts his hair, shaves his beard, and dons \"Christian\" clothes so that he can enter W\u00fcrttemberg disguised as a Christian. As his carriage is involved in an accident, S\u00fc\u00df gains a lift from Dorothea Sturm (Kristina S\u00f6derbaum) to the city.\nThe Duke is delighted with the jewelry, and S\u00fc\u00df willingly defers payment. S\u00fc\u00df offers to provide financing for the Duke's bodyguard, opera, and ballet as well. Eventually, the Duke discovers that he owes S\u00fc\u00df 350,000 thalers, but S\u00fc\u00df demurs, saying that all he wants in \"payment\" is the authority to maintain the roads and bridges of the duchy for 10 years\u2014and the right to levy tolls for their use and upkeep. The Duke will receive a percentage of the proceeds, thereby freeing him from the financial limits imposed by the council.The new tolls cause the price of food and other essentials to rise, enriching both S\u00fc\u00df and the Duke. S\u00fc\u00df gains the authority to levy taxes on salt, beer, wine, and wheat as well. He also assists in procuring local women for the Duke, thus engaging in the corruption of their morals. The increase in the price of basic necessities causes the people of W\u00fcrttemberg to suffer great privation.The oppressive taxes and brutal collection methods incite sporadic rebellions that are suppressed harshly. S\u00fc\u00df goes so far as to destroy half of a blacksmith's house to prove his power to punish those who refuse to pay their taxes. When the blacksmith attacks S\u00fc\u00df's coach with a sledgehammer, S\u00fc\u00df has the blacksmith hanged, on the grounds that an attack on the Duke's minister is tantamount to an attack on the Duke himself.After some initial resistance, the Duke yields to S\u00fc\u00df's request for the repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in W\u00fcrttemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city.

Dorothea and her fianc\u00e9, Faber (Malte Jaeger), marry in secret. S\u00fc\u00df then has Dorothea's father imprisoned\u2014on the grounds that he is a leader of the conspiracy against the Duke.When the council objects to the Duke's increasing usurpation of power and abrogation of the constitution, S\u00fc\u00df suggests to him that this challenge to his authority can be suppressed by dismissing the council and restructuring the government so that the Duke can reign as an absolute monarch. S\u00fc\u00df tells the Duke that he can accomplish this by hiring mercenaries and that, as a sign of their gratitude, the Jews of W\u00fcrttemberg will provide all the requisite funds. S\u00fc\u00df argues that he would be most effective if the Duke were to give him a letter granting him immunity from the laws of W\u00fcrttemberg.

S\u00fc\u00df keeps his promise to free Faber who subsequently discovers his wife's drowned corpse.S\u00fc\u00df suggests to the Duke that the two of them go to Ludwigsburg on the pretext of meeting the emperor's emissary and return to W\u00fcrttemberg only after the planned coup has established him as an absolute monarch.

A shot is heard; the door of a house opens, and a man stumbles out of it, followed by a woman who calmly shoots him several more times, the last few while standing over his body. The woman is Leslie Crosbie, the wife of a British rubber plantation manager in Malaya; her manservant recognizes the man whom she shot as Geoff Hammond, a well-regarded member of the European community. Leslie tells the servant to send for her husband Robert, who is working at one of the plantations. Her husband returns, having summoned his attorney and a British police inspector. Leslie tells them that Geoff Hammond \"tried to make love to me\" and that she killed him to save her honor.\n\nLeslie is placed under arrest and put in jail in Singapore to await trial for murder; that she killed a man makes such a trial inevitable, but her eventual acquittal seems a foregone conclusion, as the white community accepts her story and believes she acted heroically.  Only her attorney, Howard Joyce, is rather suspicious. Howard's suspicions seem justified when his clerk, Ong Chi Seng, shows him a copy of a letter Leslie wrote to Hammond the day she killed him, telling him that her husband would be away that evening and pleading with him to come\u2014implicitly threatening him if he did not come.\nOng Chi Seng tells Howard that the original letter is in the possession of Hammond's widow, a Eurasian woman who lives in the Chinese quarter of town.  The letter is for sale, and Ong himself, whom Howard had believed to be impeccable, stands to receive a substantial cut of the price.  Howard then confronts Leslie with the damning evidence, and she breaks down and confesses to having written it, though she stands by her claim of having killed Hammond in self-defense.  Yet Leslie cleverly manipulates the attorney into agreeing to buy back the letter, even though in doing so, he will risk his own freedom and career.\nBecause the couple's bank account is in Robert's name, Howard obtains Robert's consent to buy the letter, but he does so deceitfully, lying about and trivializing its content, leaving out the true circumstances, and giving the man no idea that the price is equivalent to almost all the money he has in the bank. Robert, depicted as a decent man thoroughly in love with Leslie and somewhat gullible, is readily persuaded.  Hammond's widow demands that Leslie come personally to hand over the $10,000 for the letter (she has been released into her attorney's custody) and requires Leslie to abase herself by picking up the letter at the widow's feet. With the letter suppressed, Leslie is easily acquitted.\nDuring a celebration after the trial, Robert announces that he plans to draw his savings out of his account to buy a rubber plantation in Sumatra. Howard and Leslie are forced to tell him that his savings are gone, that the impact of the letter would have hanged Leslie, and its price was accordingly high. After demanding to see the letter, Robert is devastated to learn from Leslie that Hammond was her lover for years and that she killed him out of jealousy.\nWhile preparing for a party celebrating the acquittal, Leslie steps onto her balcony and sees a knife on the matting. Shocked, she returns to her room and then joins the party. Downstairs, Robert tells friends of his plans to buy the plantation. Leslie, overhearing him, leaves the party, and Robert breaks down. Leslie goes to her room and tries to take up her lacemaking, but also breaks down and sobs. Robert comes into the room and offers to forgive her if she can swear that she loves him. At first, Leslie agrees and tells him she loves him and that she will do all in her power to make him happy. When he kisses her, she cries \"No!\" and then breaks down and confesses, \"With all my heart, I still love the man I killed!\"\nRobert rushes from the room. Leslie looks out at the patio mat, and the knife is gone. She knows that Hammond's widow had planted it there and then has taken it away. She knows the woman waits for her\u2014to kill her, and she realizes this is her fate. She walks out through the gardens and, finally, encounters the woman who glares at her fiercely.

Marsen is in fact a Gestapo agent assigned to gain her trust and locate her father.\nFollowing Marsen's suggestion, Anna places a cryptic newspaper advertisement to let her father know she is in the country.

There, Anna contacts Dickie Randall, a British intelligence officer working undercover as an entertainer named Gus Bennett. Randall takes Anna to her father, who is now working for the Royal Navy at the fictional Dartland naval base. Anna argues with Randall over her attempt to post a letter to Marsen (with an informative postmark). It does not matter, as Dr. John Fredericks, Marsen's undercover superior in London, had tailed her to Brightbourne.\nSoon after, Marsen arranges the kidnapping of Anna and her father, and brings them back to Germany by U-boat. Their captors threaten to put her in a concentration camp if Bomasch refuses to work for the Nazis. Meanwhile, Randall's proposal to rescue the Bomasches is (unofficially) accepted.

However, Marsen shows up just as they are about to leave the hotel; he has been assigned to escort them to Munich.\nRandall's situation is further complicated at the railway station, where he is recognised by a former classmate named Caldicott, who is leaving Germany with his friend Charters. Randall denies knowing Caldicott, but Marsen's suspicions are aroused. When the train makes an unscheduled stop (brought to a halt by a railway station guard played by Irene Handl in an early uncredited bit part) to take on troops, as war has just been declared between Britain and Germany, Marsen takes the opportunity to telephone his headquarters to have Herzog investigated.

They reach an aerial tramway; at the other end is neutral Switzerland. Randall manages to shoot all of their pursuers except Marsen, while Anna and the others escape on the tram. Randall then boards the other tram and exchanges shots with Marsen. Marsen reverses the direction of Randall's tram, but he manages to jump to the other tram as it passes.

The party arrives at the Rock Tribe's cave with their prey. The beast is cooked on a fire. When it is done, the strongest feed first, next the women and children, then the few elderly pick the scraps. Tumak defends his portion from demands by Akhoba. They fight and Akhoba knocks Tumak over a cliff as his mother watches. Tumak recovers to find a Woolly Mammoth attacking him. He runs and climbs a tree. The Mammoth rams the tree and knocks it into a river.\nTumak floats downstream unconscious and is found by Loana of the Shell Tribe. Her tribesmen answer her shell horn call and take Tumak to their cave. The tribe gathers for a meal of vegetables, shared orderly with the children, women and elderly served first. Tumak awakes and Loana gives him food, which he guards as he eats, perplexing the tribe who share and do not fight. Tumak looks on, confused by the customs of the Shell Tribe.\nMeanwhile, Akhoba leads a hunting party into the hills but is injured trying to take down a Muskox. As Akhoba lies injured, a younger hunter asserts authority over the others and takes Akhoba's place as leader, leaving Akhoba to die. Later, Akhoba, crippled, shows up at the cave but is treated with contempt.\nTumak adjusts slowly to life with the Shell Tribe. He helps the children gather food by shaking fruit out of a tree and they teach him how to laugh. He tries to fish with Loana but grows frustrated, as spearfishing is not like land hunting. While he is fishing, an Allosaurus traps a child in a tree. Tumak uses a borrowed spear to kill the dinosaur and save the child, but does not want to return the spear to its owner. Later that night, Tumak steals the spear and a hammer from their maker, and attacks him when he tries to reclaim them. The tribal leader, Loana's father, banishes Tumak.\nAs Tumak departs, Loana, who has fallen in love with him, leaves her tribe to follow him, much to his dismay. Tumak pulls apples from a tree for himself, ignoring Loana. Seeing that she has trouble reaching apples herself, he relents and helps her. Along the way, they spot an Glyptodont which chases them up a tree. Later, as Tumak and Loana reach Rock Tribe territory, they are trapped in a fissure during a fight between a Dimetrodon and a lizard-like dinosaur. Loana escapes, but is menaced by the leader who previously displaced Akhoba. She blows her shell horn, leading Tumak to her rescue. He saves her by defeating the leader and becomes the new leader.\nTumak has Loana handle the meals, which confuses the Rock Tribe, since she feeds the women and children first, then Akhoba whom she has sat on his former throne, and then the other elders. Lastly, Tumak and the able-bodied men are fed. The next day, Akhoba comes outside to see his tribe learning to gather fruits and vegetables, with Loana showing them which are good to eat and which are not. Loana and Tumak sit and talk, but Tumak is called away to help hunt a deer while Loana helps search for a missing child.\nA nearby volcano erupts, scattering the Rock Tribe and destroying their cave. A child's mother is engulfed by a lava flow to death; Loana saves the child but is cut off from the others by the lava flow. She and the child head to the Shell Tribe. Many animals fall into the crevasses opened by the eruption. Tumak searches for Loana but finds only a scrap of her clothing near the lava flow and presumes her to be dead.\nLater, a Shell tribesman seeks out Tumak and tells him that Loana is still alive, but the Shell Tribe is trapped in their cave by a large Monitor lizard-like dinosaur. Tumak leads his men to attack and kill the animal. Akohba and the women with the children follow. The Shell Tribe hold off the beast with torches. Tumak's direct spear attack is futile. Akhoba advises Tumak to distract the dinosaur while the rest of the men climb to higher ground. They start a rockslide that kills the beast. The formerly despised Akhoba becomes recognized for his experience and wisdom. The two tribes unite as one. Tumak, Loana, and the rescued child are framed in the dawn of a new day.", "tmdb_plot": "One Million B.C. is a 1940 American fantasy film produced by Hal Roach Studios and released by United Artists.

A physician (Jimmy Finlayson) is called to treat Ollie and, warning Ollie that he could develop a more serious condition, \"hornomania,\" prescribes a relaxing boat trip and goat's milk. Ollie dismisses the idea because he is afraid to sail on the ocean, but Stan offers an alternative: they will simply rent a boat and keep it attached to the dock, getting all the sea air they can while never actually going out to sea. A running gag in the episode is when one of the boys tries to turn on the taps and gas hobs, only for the one opposite to go on instead due to the janitor being cross-eyed, which results in Stan destroying half the kitchen area with a gas explosion and Ollie vowing to find the janitor and give him a very large piece of his mind.

Julie is banished from the island and has no money for passage. The Pig wants her to stay, but she tells him nothing could ever make her so desperate that she would allow him to touch her. She goes to Marfeu (Bernard Nedell) for help and ends up a held prisoner in his shack.\nPrison warden Grideau (Frederic Worlock) is mystified by the fact that the work gang count was correct even though Verne was outside the prison. Grideau thinks that Verne has potential, unlike most of the prisoners but fears the man is doomed. It is only a matter of time before he kills someone. In the prison barracks, the stranger, whose name is Cambreau, begins to show the qualities that begin to define him as a mysterious, supernatural character: his anticipation of events (including weather), his knowledge of people, his physical endurance, his readiness with appropriate quotes from scripture, even his unexplained possession of money when needed. In a conversation with Verne, he offers the idea, central to the film, that \u201cevery man has God in his heart.\u201d Verne finds this wildly funny, pointing to all the wonderful examples of God around them.\nMoll (Albert Dekker) has masterminded a jailbreak and takes Cambreau, Telez (Eduardo Ciannelli), Hessler (Paul Lukas), a serial killer who poisons his wives, Flaubert (J.

Verne and Moll are bitter enemies, but in spite of this\u2014or because of it\u2014Verne plans to catch up with them and join in.\nThe trek through the jungle is brutal. They need food, and Cambreau, who never tires, strides off purposively into the undergrowth. Meanwhile Julie has been fighting with Marfeu, who caught her packing a sack with food, trying to get away. Her arm is raised to stab him to death when Cambreau\u2019s voice is heard saying, \u201cNot that way, Julie.\u201d  When she goes to look there is no one, but the sack is gone and there is a wad of money, enough for a passage to the mainland. Marfeu takes it. Later, while Julie is begging him to let her go\u2014hasn\u2019t she been there long enough?\u2014Verne bursts in. He takes the money from Marfeu and takes Julie with him. She makes it clear that she goes because he is the best thing available at the moment\u2014She will ditch him if something better comes along. They understand each other perfectly. Soon after, Cambreau returns with the supplies.  Then Verne appears and joins the escapees.\nWhen they reach the coast, they are all barely able to stand from thirst and exhaustion\u2014except for  Cambreau. He stops Moll from drinking seawater, and somehow knows that the boat that has been hidden for them is around the next point. Refreshed by the water hidden there, they set sail for the mainland.\nThen during a long, deadly, calm, Julie shares her ugly past, her new hopes, her love for Verne and her fears for him. She could gladly spend her life with him but not on the deadly path he is on. She wishes she could pray, and Cambreau gently tells her that she has been.\nOnly Verne, Julie, Hessler, and Cambreau survive the long ordeal.  The others die, some heroically, all receiving consolation from Cambreau. Once ashore, they set the boat adrift with Moll\u2019s body in it, hoping the authorities  will assume that there were no survivors of the prison break.\nCambreau takes them to a fisherman\u2019s hut where they take refuge, washing,  shaving, replacing their rags with clean clothes. The fisherman denies having a boat until Verne threatens him with a razor.\nIn the port on the mainland, Grideau and his men, accompanied by the Pig, examine the boat with Moll\u2019s body in it. As the escapees hoped, they believe that all died, but the Pig finds a scrap of Julie\u2019s dress and knows better.\nHessler leaves them, announcing that he is off to find a rich widow\u2014his next victim. He is proud of having escaped Cambreau\u2019s net and disdains Cambreau\u2019s salvation, bidding him a mocking au revoir.  Cambreau  gravely replies that they will not meet again. Once outside, Hessler pauses and looks back, struggling against belief and then, grimacing demonically,  slinks off into the night as a storm begins.\nJulie is on the waterfront, looking for passage on a ship in the harbor, but no one will row her out: The weather is bad and getting worse. The Pig sees her and threatens to expose Verne unless she agrees to go back to the island with him\u2014and marry him. She scorns him at first, but realizing this is Verne\u2019s only hope, she agrees, on condition that she be allowed to say goodbye, alone. Her conversation with Verne is agonizing, and when the Pig comes into the hut, Verne assumes the worst. In the end, Julie goes with the Pig. Cambreau is now the only person who knows that  Verne is alive, and  Verne will feel safer if he is dead. In spite of the terrible weather,  they row out to the boat with the fisherman. It is not until after they get there that Cambreau says he should stay behind; there are people he might help.  Verne decides to kill him, and punches him in the jaw, deliberately knocking him overboard into the crashing waves. Cambreau clings to a piece of driftwood, evoking the image of Christ on Calvary's cross.\nThe fisherman tells Verne that only he can save Cambreau, but Verne taunts the drowning man, demanding to know where God is now, saying \u201cthe fisherman is God! \u201c \u201cI\u2019m God! You\u2019re... You\u2019re....\u201d but Cambreau goes under as he is shouting. Verne freezes in horror and then, desperately calling Cambreau\u2019s name, dives into the raging sea to save him. Back on deck, Verne thinks Cambreau is dead and asks him why. Then Cambreau opens his eyes and Verne, weeping, embraces him.\nIt is bright day. The storm has cleared and Julie, the Pig and Grideau are on the deck of the steamer that will take them back to the island. Julie sees Verne walking confidently along the wharf toward the ship and runs out to stop him. He keeps on coming and, full of banter as usual, surrenders to Grideau.  Repentant but still cocky, he jokes that a woman like Julie was all the warden really needed to keep him in line. She will wait for him, and they will be married after he has served his term.\nAcross the harbor, aboard the fisherman\u2019s boat, he and Cambreau watch the steamer.

Bradford reports to Union headquarters and is immediately sent to Virginia City, a Nevada mining town, to find out where $5,000,000 in gold that Southern sympathizers plan to ship to the tottering Confederacy is being kept. On the westbound stagecoach, he meets and falls in love with the elegant Julia Hayne who, unbeknown to him, is in fact a dance-hall entertainer and a rebel spy, sent by Jefferson Davis to assist in the transfer of the gold by wagon train. Also on the stagecoach is the legendary John Murrell, leader of a gang of \"banditos\", travelling as a gun salesman. Before he and his gang can rob the stage, Bradford gets the drop on Murrell, who is forced to send his men away.\nWhen the stage reaches Virginia City, Julia gives Bradford the slip and heads off to warn Captain Irby, who is now managing the gold-smuggling operation, that Bradford is in town. Bradford follows Irby to the rebels' hideout behind a false wall in a blacksmith's shop, but the gold is moved before he arrives. The Union garrison is called out to patrol the roads to prevent any wagons from leaving town.\nWhile Irby is meeting with the sympathetic town doctor, Murrell shows up looking for someone to set his broken arm. Irby offers Murrell $10,000 to have his banditos attack the garrison, which will force the Union soldiers guarding the roads to come to its defense. While the soldiers are busy, Irby's rebels will smuggle the gold out in the false bottoms of their wagons. First Irby needs to take care of Bradford. He uses Julia to arrange a meeting between the two men, and then takes Bradford prisoner, intending to return him to prison.\nThe rebels' caravan is stopped at a small Union outpost. At first, they are allowed to proceed, but after watching the bullion-laden wagons have difficulty moving through the soft dirt, the soldiers become suspicious and attempt to inspect the wagons. The Southerners start a firefight, killing the soldiers. In the confusion, Bradford escapes. Pursued closely by Irby and his men, he rides his horse down a steep incline and ends up somersaulting down the hill. The rebels, believing him dead, continue toward Texas. Bradford returns to the outpost and sends a telegraph to the garrison. Major Drewery, the garrison commander, arrives with a contingent of cavalry. Drewery, who is scornful of Bradford as a soldier, does not take his advice and ends up following a false trail, causing the pursuit to fall ever further behind the rebels, who are themselves fighting thirst, privation, and the unforgiving terrain. Bradford is able to persuade Drewery to allow him to take a small detachment to follow his hunch.\nBradford and his men catch up with the caravan which is trapped in a canyon and being attacked by Murrell's banditos who are attempting to take the gold. Irby is wounded in the gunfight, but Bradford's superior military skills and the rebels' long guns eventually drive off the banditos. Before he dies, Irby delegates command of the caravan and its gold to Bradford. During the night, knowing that in the morning both Murrell's men and Drewery's command will arrive, Bradford takes the gold from the wagons and buries it in the canyon to prevent its capture.\nDrewery and his men arrive in the morning in time to crush the outlaws' renewed attack, and Murrell is killed. Bradford refuses to disclose the gold's location and is brought up on charges in a court-martial. He defends his action in that, \"as a soldier\", he knew the gold might have been used to win the war for the South and prevented that, but \"as a man\" he knows it belongs to the South and he would prefer that it be used to rebuild the South's shattered economy and wounded pride after the war. The court finds him guilty of high treason and sentences him to death on April 9, 1865.\nThe day before Bradford's scheduled execution, Julia meets with Abraham Lincoln and pleads for Bradford's life.
