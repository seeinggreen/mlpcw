In the first story, Xiao Zongyao, the son of the strict and exemplary village chief, Xiao Weiguo, is informed by his girlfriend, Huang Huan, that she is pregnant during their clandestine meeting in the forest. They are overheard by the village ne\u2019er-do-well, Bai Hu, who tries to blackmail Zongyao. In the ensuing scuffle between the two men, Bai Hu falls and dies. Zongyao and Huan cover the body with dry branches and flee together to the nearest city. Zongyao frantically searches for a commendation medal he had stolen from his father before he left home that evening, worried that he may have dropped the medal near Bai Hu\u2019s body. The next day, Huan discovers that she is bleeding which implies that she has miscarried, although she keeps this a secret from Zongyao. The two discuss what to do and the next day, Zongyao decides to return to the village and give himself up. Before reaching the village, Zongyao comes across a funeral procession and is told by one of the mourners that Bai Hu has died, his body burnt beyond recognition, after falling asleep drunk in the forest and setting his surroundings on fire with his cigarette butt.\nIn the second story, which starts earlier on the night of Bai Hu\u2019s death, villager Li Qin, wife of the abusive and philandering Chen Zili, is having an affair with another married villager Wang Baoshan. They quarrel and Li Qin dares Baoshan to kill Chen Zili. After leaving Li Qin\u2019s house, Baoshan stops by the convenience store owned by Zhuang, who is secretly in love with Li Qin and likely jealous of Baoshan. Zhuang then observes Baoshan walking off in the direction that Huan was seen to be going when she had walked by a few minutes before. The next morning, Li Qin discovers that Baoshan has been accused of killing Huan, who had disappeared overnight, and burning her body. In front of other villagers, Baoshan asks Li Qin to provide him with an alibi for the time of the supposed murder. Li Qin refuses and goes home. Later, Li Qin is informed that the identity card of her husband Chen Zili had been found on the burnt body and that the corpse is his. Baoshan is released. Zhuang, who had caused the villagers to suspect Baoshan for killing Huan, arranges the funeral of Chen Zili, to curry favor with Li Qin. On his way back to the village after buying goods for the funeral, Zhuang is waved down by a man by the roadside. He is shocked to see that it is Chen Zili, alive and well. Zhuang gives Zili a lift and Zili promptly falls asleep in the van. Zhuang picks up a rock to smash Zili\u2019s head in but doesn\u2019t go through with it eventually. Zili wakes up and goes off into the bushes to relieve himself. Zili\u2019s phone rings, and he answers but accidentally drops it. Startled, he loses his footing and plunges off the steep cliff where he had been relieving himself, apparently to his death.\nIn another storyline, we see Bai Hu in the city shortly before his death. He repeatedly borrows money from loan sharks to fund his gambling addiction. He also appears to be sick, and has a nosebleed. He meets Chen Zili in the city by chance on the morning of his death, and it is implied that he steals Zili\u2019s wallet which also contained Zili\u2019s identity card. Bai Hu then makes his way to the village, reaching it at night, where he comes across Zongyao and Huan, resulting in his own death. The loan sharks come to the village the next morning to collect the debt and, unable to find Bai Hu, threaten to burn down the house of Bai Guoqing, Bai Hu\u2019s elder brother.\nIn the last story which begins around the time of Bai Hu\u2019s death, village chief Xiao Weiguo, Zongyao\u2019s father, is walking home through the forest after attending an unrelated funeral. He hears the commotion caused by the altercation between his son and Bai Hu, and witnesses the latter\u2019s death. After his son has fled, Weiguo drags the body to another spot closer to the village and burns it. The next morning, Weiguo pretends to find the charred body by accident, after he and another villager spot the smoke. The villagers first assume it is Huan and later that it is Chen Zili. Deeply remorseful, Weiguo calls Chen Zili to prove that he is still alive, which results in the phone call that causes Zili\u2019s fall from the cliff. The police find Zili\u2019s body and contacts Li Qin, who goes to identify his body and collect his ashes. Zhuang drives Li Qin in his van and Li Qin discovers Zili\u2019s walking cane, which had been left behind in the van. Li Qin takes the cane and rejects Zhuang\u2019s romantic intentions. Li Qin leaves the coffin containing Bai Hu\u2019s body with Weiguo, asking him to locate the unknown deceased\u2019s kin.\nBai Guoqing, Bai Hu\u2019s brother, goes to Weiguo with a request to use the coffin to stage Bai Hu\u2019s death and fool the loan sharks. Thinking that Bai Hu will finally get a proper burial by his real family, Weiguo agrees. The Bai family holds the funeral procession and succeed in deceiving the loan sharks that Bai Hu is dead. But instead of burying him, the Bais leave the coffin in the open mountainside, reasoning that the body would be claimed by others.

Daru, a French school-teacher goes about his day teaching geography to the Algerian children from nearby villages, playing with them, and giving grain to their families. One of Daru's acquaintances show up to his isolated schoolhouse to warn him about rising tensions between the Algerian resistance and the French regime.\nThe following morning, Balducci, a French gendarme and friend to Daru, brings an Arab prisoner (who we find out is called Mohamed later on) to Daru's schoolhouse. Balducci informs Daru that he must take this prisoner to the nearby town, Tinguit, and hand him over to the police department over there. He claims that he is unable to due to there being a lack of forces to prevent a potential uprising in the town of El Ameur. Daru is displeased with the orders being given to him and outright refuses to comply. Despite Mohamed having killed his cousin over the theft of grain, Daru insists that it is out of the question for him to take the man to the authorities as they will most probably sentence him to death without much deliberation. Balducci, frustrated, tells Daru that French authorities already have an eye on him due to his friendliness with the locals. He then starts his trip back to El Ameur, leaving the prisoner and his fate in the hands of Daru.\nAfter sharing a meal together, Daru sets up a bed for Mohamed, ensuring he is treated like a regular guest. At night, Mohamed falls sick prompting Daru to tend to him. This helps ease the tension and grow trust between the two men. The next morning, Daru is suddenly faced by a group of men in horses demanding he hand over their cousin. The situation quickly escalates and Daru is forced to use a firearm to fend them off. After shooting one of their horses, the men disperse and flee whilst promising revenge. After the situation cools down, Daru heatedly confronts Mohamed, blaming him for the events that had just taken place. Mohamed in turn asks Daru to take him to the authorities in Tinguit, to which Daru responds to by telling him to go by himself. Mohamed reluctantly goes through with this, only to be met by Daru quickly having a change of heart and agreeing to take the trip with him.\nDaru proceeds to pack essentials for the trek but just as they are about to leave, they are met with a group of Frenchmen searching for a man guilty of slaughtering their cattle. When they see Mohamed, they ask Daru if he was the man in question. Daru explains his situation, but the men insist that they can take care of his prisoner and call it a day. After Daru's refusal to leave it to them, one of the Frenchmen gets agitated and threatens Daru with his gun. Daru quickly turns the situation around and holds the man at gunpoint. He expresses his empathy towards him having lost his cattle and then asks them all to leave.\nFinally, after all this trouble, Daru and Mohamed finally embark on their trip to Tinguit. Unfortunately, not much time passes until they spot Mohamed's cousins in the distance searching for them. To avoid any further conflict, they deviate and follow a perilous path through the mountains. Shortly after, they accidentally confront a lone armed man riding a horse. The man is shown to be hesitant to pull the trigger as both parties try to de-escalate the situation. Nevertheless, the man fires the first shot and misses to which Daru is forced to retaliate with a shot to the chest. Daru quickly scrambles to try and resuscitate him but to no avail. Angered and frustrated, Daru calls Mohamed a coward with no honor. Mohamed ignores this and begins to recite prayers in front of the man's body and then buries him with sand. The situation cools down and both men continue their hike through the desert.\nSeveral hours of walking later, a heavy rain settles and the duo rush back to an abandoned village they had passed by earlier to take shelter and stay warm. Once rested and refuged from mother nature, Mohamed explains to Daru why and how he got himself into this mess. He had killed his cousin for stealing grain since this grain was essential to keeping his parents and siblings fed. Had he let it happen, his family would have starved to death. Furthermore, his family was not able to pay the \"blood-money\" to appease their cousins, forcing Mohamed to flee and turn himself in to French authorities. If he were to die at the hands of the French, then his cousins would have nobody to take out their revenge on and neither would Mohamed's siblings seek retribution over their cousins. This was the only solution to Mohamed.\nAfter having spent the night at the abandoned village, the pair are once again met with a group of armed men riding horses. This time, they were part of the Algerian rebellion and were currently on their way to their base camp. They quickly confiscate any arms that Daru and Mohamed were holding and decide to take them as temporary hostages. While held captive at the rebel base camp, Daru takes note of a man who he recognized to have been an old friend from his days in the infantry. After a light-hearted reunion, Slimane, Daru's friend, unties both of the hostages' hands. This cheerful moment is unfortunately short-lived as the rebels receive word that French troops are approaching. Consequently, everybody in the camp packs up and start heading towards a nearby cave in order to hide.\nIn the cave, Slimane explains to Daru how he must decide whether he was with or against the rebellion. Daru, who had no intention to take part in any war, was caught aback by this as he had lived all of his life in Algeria and had no qualms with either side. Slimane nevertheless leaves the decision up to Daru. After this tense exchange, Daru and Mohamed recount their experiences with women before going to sleep. Daru explains to Mohamed how he got married in the city of Algiers but unfortunately lost his wife. On the other hand, Mohamed never had the chance to get married and had never been with a woman.\nThe following morning, the rebels are ambushed by French soldiers just as they leave the cave. The situation intensifies so much that the rebels are forced to flee from a back entrance to the cave. While escaping, most rebels are killed with only a few managing to escape, including Slimane. Daru confronts the French troops and explains that Mohamed and him are mere hostages and are not involved in the uprising. The French lieutenant verifies over radio that Daru was a major in the army with a prisoner assigned to him and promptly releases them. Finally left to their own, Daru and Mohamed continue their walk through the Algerian desert.\nBefore reaching Tinguit, Daru decides to take Mohamed to the town of Berzina where has was born. There, Daru reveals to Mohamed that his parents were actually from Spain and he had in fact no French blood in him. Because of this, Daru had always felt like an outsider in Algeria. He then takes Mohamed to a bar in order to hire an escort for him. The bar owner, who knew Daru when he was young, also hired him an escort. After this stop, the duo continue their trek.\nOnce Tinguit is finally in view, Daru offers Mohamed two choices. The first was to continue forward to Tinguit and hand himself over to the authorities as he had planned.

Tamura is discharged back and forth until essentially ordered not to return and continue consuming supplies - he is ordered to commit suicide instead rather than return yet again.\nOn his own, Tamura finds that military discipline has faltered as the Japanese army disintegrates into the jungle and subsists largely on yams.  Tamura steals food from some local Filipinos while encountering disturbing evidence of the Japanese army's collapse.  A despondent soldier blows himself up with a grenade, while others lie dying from malnutrition or injuries on the path.  Tamura encounters two soldiers, Yasuda and Nagamatsu, who attempt to trade cigarettes for yams to soldiers who pass by; he declines the cigarette but gives Nagamatsu a yam regardless out of pity.  Tamura desperately forages whatever food he can, while American aircraft occasionally strafe the Japanese army remnants with bullets.  At a seemingly abandoned church, Tamura stabs a dog.  He sees a pile of Japanese corpses nearby, but investigates regardless; he finds a cache of salt hidden beneath a floorboard, but is found out by two Filipino civilians.  In a panicked haze, he shoots one; the other runs away, with Tamura's halfhearted shots missing.  Tamura runs away with his stolen food before reinforcements come, abandoning his rifle in the process.  Tamura joins up with some remaining soldiers from a different company, where he is told that the whole army has orders to attempt to retreat to Palompon.  Tamura travels with them for a time, trading his salt for yams; the other soldiers morbidly joke that they practiced cannibalism in order to survive during the New Guinea campaign, although Tamura is unsure if it is actually a joke or not.  The retreat to Palompon requires crossing an open road; as Japanese soldiers attempt to cross it at nightfall, they are easily detected and gunned down by the Americans and Filipinos.\nA famished Tamura prepares a white flag to attempt to surrender to a passing American jeep.  Just before he runs out to surrender, he sees another Japanese soldier attempt the same act.  The other soldier is gunned down by a vengeful Filipino woman in the jeep despite the American soldier's attempt to accept the surrender; Tamura perceives the shooter as the same woman he shot in the chapel.  It is clear to Tamura that crossing the road to get to Palompon is impossible, so he returns the way he came into the jungle.  Now delirious and perceiving corpses as talking to him, Tamura is found and saved from starvation by Nagamatsu, the soldier he had given a yam to earlier.  Tamura is given bark, water, and \"monkey meat\".  Tamura is bullied into giving his grenade to Yasuda, the canny superior whose leg was wounded and rolled up cigarettes for trade.  After hearing a shot, Tamura chases after Nagamatsu; he sees that he had fired at a fleeing Filipino civilian, and that the \"monkeys\" he had been hunting were other humans.  The loose alliance between Nagamatsu and Yasuda breaks down now that Yasuda has a grenade, as the two each fear that the other will kill them for their meat.  After guarding the only source of clean water in the area, Yasuda is smoked out; Yasuda attempts to negotiate, but Nagamatsu shoots him.  As Nagamatsu attempts to devour Yasuda, Tamura grabs his rifle.  In the resulting struggle, he shoots Nagamatsu, who assures him before he dies that he knows Tamura will eat him.\nThe scene shifts to post-war Japan, where Tamura writes a memoir.

He is a former F-16 Falcon pilot, married, with two children who live with him in a suburban house off-base. His current assignment involves flying armed MQ-9 Reaper drones in foreign air space in support of the U.S. War on Terror. He is admired by his commanding officer and support staff for his calm demeanor, precise flying, and adaptability. Privately, he is concerned about the assignment, which he took after being informed there was reduced call for and increased competition among fighter pilots in the Air Force. His previous CO informed him that a tour flying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) would look good on his record and would increase his chances of being posted back to a flying assignment.\nAt first, the new assignment seems stressful but relatively benign. He is assigned to attack more clear-cut terrorist cells, vehicles, and facilities in Afghanistan. He flies these assignments during daylight hours over his targets, which is night-time in Las Vegas, leaving his days free for his sleep period, and to spend time with his wife and children. However, the high-tempo assignment \u2013 he is attacking targets on almost a daily basis \u2013 begins taking its toll. His wife notices the stress he's under and he begins drinking when off-duty.\nStill, his performance is excellent and his crew is rated among the highest in the squadron, so, on the orders of his commanding officer, he is assigned to more challenging missions under the direction of CIA controllers. Many of these targets are in Yemen and Somalia, places where the U.S. has no acknowledged military mission. The targets themselves are increasingly morally ambiguous: crowds the CIA controller calls terrorist cells, public buildings the controller says are sleeping spots for high level terrorist leaders or factories for making explosives. Collateral damage goes from being a rare occurrence to a routine one. On several occasions, the CIA controller orders strikes on obvious civilian targets \u2013 including women and children \u2013 describing these casualties as unfortunate but necessitated by terrorist leaders using them as human shields.\nEgan's performance declines and his drinking intensifies. He narrowly avoids being arrested for drunk driving, and starts avoiding home commitments, not wanting to inflict the stress he's under on his wife. He relishes a rare overwatch assignment protecting U.S. troops as they sleep, but must break a promise to his wife in order to perform the mission. On another overwatch mission, the troops are killed by an improvised explosive device that Egan could not protect them from. After a stress-induced violent episode at home, Egan's wife demands to know the details of Egan's work, and Egan tells her. She appears appalled. Soon after, she says she is leaving him and taking the children to Reno, Nevada, blaming his drinking and violent behavior.\nFinally, Egan cracks. His CIA controller orders a strike on a small group of civilians responding to an explosion at a building Egan had previously destroyed.

Their love for these eggs leads them to start calling themselves Periya Kaaka Muttai (Big Crow Egg) and Chinna Kaaka Muttai (Small Crow Egg).\nThe young boys constantly beg their mother and grandmother for toys they cannot afford and later for a television. They don't yet understand that the two women can't give them everything they want. When their mother and grandmother finally do bring home a television, a gift from the government to ration card holders who live below the poverty line, it's like the opening of a portal. The boys see a pizza commercial on TV whose steaming, slow-motion images make the unfamiliar food look like manna from heaven. Meanwhile, a brand new pizzeria comes up in the neighbourhood, and actor Silambarasan alias Simbu comes to its opening. Remembering the looks of enjoyment on Simbu's face when he tasted a pizza at the pizzeria, the boys thereafter think of nothing else but getting their first taste of a pizza.\nThe brothers go to the railway tracks each morning to collect the charcoal that falls off goods trains. They sell the charcoal at a scrap metal shop and are paid for their trouble. They usually hand the money over to their mother, who is saving up to pay their lawyer to get her husband out of jail. But once the boys become aware of the cost of a pizza, they begin saving the money for themselves instead, lying to their mother that they have not collected any charcoal since they were out playing. The boys succeed in saving the \u20b9 300 required to buy a pizza but are shooed away by the watchman of the pizza shop since they are badly dressed, which reflects the fact that they are local slum-dwellers. The boys narrate this story to their friend Pazharasam who works as a lineman with the Railways. He tells them that people place a lot of importance on clothes and advises them to save up and purchase new dresses before approaching the pizza outlet again.\nThe boys go on to work again to save money for buying new clothes at Chennai Citi Centre. In the meantime, they show their grandmother the pamphlet from the pizza shop. She tries to make them a home-cooked pizza using dosa batter as base, but the boys deride her attempts and insult her. After finally saving up enough money for new dresses when the boys see Citi Centre, they realise that it is another big mall which would definitely not allow them inside. But they somehow manage to acquire a newly bought pair of clothes from a couple of rich children by buying them panipuri from a street vendor, much against the wishes of the rich boys' father, who had denied them the treat as he considered it unhygienic.\nThe happy brothers return to the pizza shop in their new dresses. Another group of slum boys who are envious and sceptical about the brothers' story about going to eat pizza follow them to take a video of what transpires with the brothers at the pizza shop. The brothers are once again confronted by the watchman and he now forces them to go home right away, but the boys protest by saying that they have money and are wearing new clothes. This argument attracts the attention of the pizzeria supervisor who comes out and slaps the older brother. This is caught on video by the other slum kids who laugh at the brothers' humiliation. The sad and disappointed brothers return to their slum only to be further overwhelmed by the miserable sight of their dead grandmother. The brothers feel guilty when they remember insulting their grandmother some time before.\nWhen two men in the slum happen to watch the video of the boy being slapped, they try to make money by threatening the owner of the pizza shop to release the video to the media. The owner realises he could be imprisoned and his pizzeria sealed by the government due to his supervisor's act of discrimination and violence against slum children. He offers one of the men a hundred thousand rupees for not making the video public. The man agrees, but his associate releases it to the media hoping to make some money (unaware of the huge sum being offered). This stirs up tension amongst the pizzeria's owners who finally decide to publicly apologise to the slum kids. The boys are welcomed to the pizza spot in a red carpet reminiscent of Simbu being welcomed in the opening ceremony of the pizzeria. The owner also promises them free pizzas for life. Even as the brothers begin to finally enjoy their first pizza, they tell each other that the dosa-pizza which their grandmother had earlier made for them had tasted much better.", "tmdb_plot": "Two slum kids yearn to taste a pizza after being enticed by the pizza shop that has opened near their locality.

Necross makes the Sun die off gradually, to make sure that no one would take it from him. Night falls everywhere, and a distressed Mune is banished from his own people.\nMune and Sohone both set out on a quest to find the vanished Sun, accompanied by a young wax girl named Glim. Thanks to her knowledge of astronomy and the ancient stories of how the world came together, the group is able to pass the Great Blue Hole, a lake under which the great abyss opens that leads to the depths of the world. Mune watches over Glim since she could freeze and break in the cold water. While underwater, the group meets Phospho, a failed previous Guardian of the Moon from the same generation as Necross, but, due to his cowardice, he give up his position after he failed to stop Necross instead of Xolal. He wakes Glim up using his power and leads them to the entrance of the underworld, where Necross lives.\nMeanwhile, Leeyoon takes Mune's place in the temple of the Moon, but he can't control it. The Moon wanes and crumbles into dust, causing the temple to go mad and start galloping everywhere. It ends up in the underworld where Mune, Sohone and Glim are. Mune, accompanied by Glim, takes care of the Moon while Sohone dives into the underworld to recover the Sun. Mune figures out that he can calm the temple of the Moon by using his magic glitter powers, inspiring Phospho, who had watched from afar. Leeyoon admits to him that the Moon is lost, but Mune and Glim go into the moon quarry of the world of dreams, that Yule inform Mune about before he passed away, to carve a new crescent like the first Guardian of the Moon did before. As the new Moon is ready but could not shine without the Sun, while Mune, who had tested his powers against nightmares, and Glim developed feelings for each other. A guilt-ridden Leeyoon then apologizing to Mune for his actions, recognizing him as the true Guardian of the Moon.\nWith this task done, Mune and Glim rejoin Sohone in the world of darkness. During this time, Sohone is surrounded by a mass of pale snakes who taunt and provoke him, trying to make him go mad with hatred. Sohone is saved by Phospho's intervention, who sacrifices himself to calm and free Sohone, destroying the snake wall in the process. Sohone, Mune and Glim then confront Necross and his imps. Sohone goes against Necross, but doesn't manage to weaken him. Mune finally gets rid of Mox, while Spleen failed with Glim due to his harmless nature. Glim finds the Sun and blows on it to revive its fire, but that causes her to melt. As Glim in her last breath encourages him of how powerful are his powers and that he can defeat Necross, a heartbroken Mune sobs over Glim's sacrifice. As Necross is about to crush Mune and Sohone, the Sun and the Moon, now together, shines and empowering Mune and Sohone\u2019s powers, stopping Necross from crushing them with Sohone\u2019s strength. Then Mune uses his Dream powers to defeat Necross and realises that Necross was being influenced by a pale snake, which he then pulls out and destroys. Necross regains the Guardian of the Sun appearance he had before getting corrupted by greed, then turns to stone, passing into eternal sleep in harmony, while the underworld changes into a paradise too, along with a despondent Mox and a happy Spleen.\nThe defeat of Necross leads to peace for the world, and the two young Guardians are able to resume the normal trajectories of their temples. Mune also re-sculpts Glim, and the combined energy of the sun and moon at daybreak with Glim's held fragment of the moon revives her, and give her wax the ability to not melt, freeze, or crack whatever if it is day or night.

Despite her worries that chess is becoming an obsession, his mother takes him to an adult chess club, where he impresses the resident chess master and is accepted as a student. Bobby enters the world of professional chess championships and soon becomes the youngest grandmaster ever.\nBobby's hatred of distractions leads to frequent tantrums. He enters a team tournament in Varna, Bulgaria, where he realizes Soviet grandmasters are deliberately drawing games with the collusion of the World Chess Federation. Erupting in a rant that this system makes it impossible for a non-Soviet player to win the championship, Bobby quits the tournament and gives up chess.\nWhen Bobby returns to the U.S., lawyer Paul Marshall offers to help him modify the tournament rules, working pro bono to give Fischer a fair chance to win future tournaments. Fischer re-enters professional chess and selects Father William Lombardy, a former World Junior Chess Champion and Roman Catholic priest, as his second.

Mary retaliates by calling Emily a \"blog whore\" in front of the whole school, which lands both girls a meeting with the guidance counselor, Gordy Gambhir (Kal Penn), in his office.\nLater that night, Mary writes on Facebook that she will be taking a \"vow of silence\" and deletes her social media accounts. She forms the idea to create a \"Sisterhood\", and recruits classmates Catherine Huang (Willa Cuthrell) and Lavinia Hall (Olivia DeJonge) as its first members. Together, the three girls venture into the forest at night, beginning their ritual.\nBy the following school year, the Sisterhood has become common knowledge among school and all girls wish to join. However, no one knows what the group ritual is due to a vow of silence each member takes. New members are chosen by Mary and given a paper square as an invite. Emily, upset about being rejected, follows the girls into the woods and hides as the group ritual begins. While snapping a photo, she gets spotted by Mary.\nThe scene cuts to her in her bedroom, posting a new blog post. The post describes how she heard the girls chant dirty things, perform sexual acts on each other, and claims they cut her hand with a knife before molesting her. Later, Emily runs into Mary during Mass at church and makes a scene in front of everyone before fainting. However, Mary simply declares she will never be in the Sisterhood.\nMary, Catherine, Lavinia, and the rest of the Sisterhood uphold their vow of silence when parents, teachers, and reporters ask about the Sisterhood activities. Lavinia's mother, Rose, searches Lavinia's room and discovers a doll with a pentagram-like symbol drawn on it. After Lavinia returns home, she is confronted by her mother, who finds the same symbol tattooed on her stomach. Two more girls come forward and claim the Sisterhood girls molested them as well, causing more public hysteria. Emily and the two girls come up with a plan to get the fragile Lavinia to make a confession about the Sisterhood.\nThe same night, Mary finds herself alone while trying to avoid being caught for skipping curfew. She goes to see her boyfriend, Jeff, but he refuses to talk to her. She goes to Gambhir's house to confide in him, unaware they are being observed by Sue Parris (Jessica Hecht), Emily's mother. She snaps a picture of them and, assuming they're in a sexual relationship, sends the photo out. Mary spends the night on his couch before being awoken by her mother the following morning, who saw the photo. Gambhir is fired from his teaching job, even after he and Mary insist nothing inappropriate happened.\nFeeling that things are spinning out of control, Catherine and Lavinia try to convince Mary to tell everyone the truth of the Sisterhood, but Mary promises that she'll fix it. At a small press conference, Mary tries to talk to parents and reporters to dispel the situation. Despite her efforts, Mary is unable to settle the scandal as Gambhir defends the girls.\nMary fashions the now-infamous Sisterhood paper square and gives it to Gambhir, inviting him to see their ritual. After getting Rose to come with him, they watch as the girls stand in a circle around a fire, share their personal thoughts out loud before burning pieces of paper with their written secrets. Through a montage of Sisterhood meetings, Catherine and Mary reveal their biggest secrets; Catherine misses her mother (who is implied to have cancer and getting treatment) and wishes she would die or get better, Mary wants to lose her virginity to someone she loves and Lavinia fears never being kissed.\nEmily, invited to speak on a radio show about sexual abuse, begins to feel guilt and decides to pull out of her plan to ambush Lavinia with her two friends. The two girls are dismayed, deciding to go ahead with the plan without her. Emily tries to warn Lavinia, but it's too late. Lavinia has been lured into the woods by Travis, a boy she has a crush on. In the woods, Travis convinces her to take her shirt off, and she is ambushed by Emily's friends. While filming her, they hold her down while putting a witch hat on her, force her to say the Sisterhood girls are witches, and make her touch herself. They upload the video to the Internet, drug Lavinia, and take her to a Halloween party. At the party, they spread the video around while calling Lavinia cruel names. A now emotionally broken Lavinia commits suicide by overdosing on her mother's pills.\nDuring Lavinia's funeral, Mary, knowing Lavinia's last wish was to be kissed, asks Jeff to do so out of respect. A distraught Emily confesses that she made the whole thing up. She admits how she wanted to be in the Sisterhood so badly, she was outraged when Mary rejected her and lied about their activities as revenge. She then begs for forgiveness. Emily, whose blog is revealed to be a hoax, is persecuted by those who hate her for the damage she caused.

Jamie claims to be a fan of Josh's work and the works of his accomplished documentary filmmaker father-in-law, Leslie Breitbart.
