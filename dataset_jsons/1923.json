Mohamet promises her he will help her escape and brings on Magnolia, a big scantily dressed black dancing girl. He covers her with a big veil. When she dances for Ben he thinks it is the artist. When she takes the veil off he recoils.\nMeanwhile Mohamet tells the artist he only saved her so he could have her himself. Ben appears and they fight. Mohamet runs off. Ben fires a jezail musket at him as he disappears over a dune. Ben fetches a horse so the girl can leave. But she has fallen in love and wants to stay. \"Dinner!\" he commands.\nThey eat ostrich eggs. She stares at him longingly. Their photo is on the front of the newspaper.

Presto creates a rope ladder using his wand and they both escape by climbing up. Presto waves his wand and the lion changes into a cat. He is asked why he didn't do that sooner. With the binoculars they spot the Bandit King and his men taking the girl away. Presto magics up a horse and a camel. Ben struggles to work out how to sit on the camel's hump and eventually borrows a horse instead.\nThe Bandit King throws the girl on his bed and starts to disrobe. Then he forces her to scrub the laundry. Ben arrives carrying a scimitar. He finds the Bandit King worshipping at a strange shrine. He is told to wait and a strange machine grabs him when the Bandit turns a head on the shrine. The girl appears and the Bandit traps her in a similar way. Ben throws a knife at the head and the machine releases him. The Bandit reappears and pushes the second head down causing the column the girl is trapped on to fly sideways to the pool area where it starts to sink. Ben and the Bandit King fight and push and pull the levers on the shrine and the girl goes up and down. The Bandit King is trapped in his own machine.

Once in Paradiso, Harold does not find the peace and seclusion he is desperately seeking; instead, he stumbles into the midst of a revolution against the island's republic.
