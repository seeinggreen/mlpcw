They drive into Rome to Isola Tiberina near the Pons Fabricius to meet Anna's boyfriend, Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti). While Claudia waits downstairs, Anna and Sandro make love in his house. Afterwards, Sandro drives the two women to the coast where they join two wealthy couples and set sail south along the coast.\nThe next morning the yacht reaches the Aeolian Islands north of Sicily. After they pass Basiluzzo, Anna impulsively jumps into the water for a swim, and Sandro jumps in after her. When Anna yells that she's seen a shark, Sandro comes to her side protectively. Later onboard Anna confesses to Claudia that the \"whole shark thing was a lie\", apparently to get Sandro's attention. After noticing Claudia admiring her blouse, she tells her to put it on, that it looks better on her, and that she should keep it. At one of the smaller islands, Lisca Bianca, the party comes ashore. Anna and Sandro go off alone and talk about their relationship. Anna is unhappy with his long business trips. Sandro dismisses her complaints and takes a nap on the rocks.\nSometime later, Corrado (James Addams) decides to leave the small island, concerned about the weather and rough seas. They hear a boat nearby. Claudia searches for Anna, but she is gone without a trace. Sandro is annoyed, saying this type of behavior is typical. They explore the island and find nothing. Sandro and Corrado decide to continue their search on the island while sending the others off to notify the authorities. Claudia decides to stay as well. Sandro, Corrado, and Claudia continue their search and end up at a shack where they stay the night. As they talk, Sandro takes offense at Claudia's suggestion that Anna's disappearance is somehow due to his neglect.\nIn the morning, Claudia wakes before the others and watches the sunrise. After finding Anna's blouse in her bag, she meets Sandro out near the cliffs, and they talk about Anna, but Sandro now seems attracted to Claudia. The police arrive and conduct a thorough search, but find nothing. Anna's father, a former diplomat, also arrives in a high-speed hydrofoil. When he sees the books his daughter has been reading - Tender Is the Night by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and The Holy Bible - he feels confident that she hasn't committed suicide. The police announce that smugglers were arrested nearby and are being held in Milazzo. Sandro decides to investigate, but before leaving, he finds Claudia alone on the yacht and kisses her. Claudia rushes off, startled by his actions. She decides to search the other islands on her own. They all agree to meet up at Corrado's Villa Montaldo in Palermo.\nAt the Milazzo police station, Sandro realizes the smugglers know nothing about Anna's disappearance. When he discovers that Claudia has arrived from the islands, he meets her at the train station where their mutual attraction is evident, but Claudia urges him not to complicate matters and begs him to leave. She boards a train to Palermo, and as the train pulls away, Sandro runs after it and jumps aboard. On the train Claudia is annoyed, saying \"I don't want you with me\". She says it would be easier if they sacrifice now and deny their attraction, but Sandro sees no sense in sacrificing anything. Still focused on her friend's disappearance, Claudia is troubled by the thought that it \"takes so little to change\". Sandro relents and gets off the train at Castroreale.\nIn Messina, Sandro tracks down the journalist Zuria, who wrote an article about Anna's disappearance. Their meeting is interrupted by crowds of excited men following a beautiful 19-year-old \"writer\" and aspiring actress named Gloria Perkins (Dorothy De Poliolo) who is actually an expensive prostitute. Sandro stops to admire her beauty. Zuria says he heard stories that Anna was spotted by a chemist in Troina. After bribing Zuria to run another story on Anna, Sandro heads to Troina. Meanwhile, Claudia meets her boating companions at Corrado's Villa Montaldo in Palermo. No one seems to take Anna's disappearance seriously except Claudia. Even Corrado's young wife Giulia openly flirts with the young prince in front of her husband. After reading Zuria's follow-up story, Claudia leaves the villa for Troina to continue her search.\nIn Troina, Sandro questions the chemist who claimed to have sold tranquilizers to Anna. Claudia arrives, and they learn that the woman identified by the chemist left on a bus to Noto in southern Sicily. Sandro and Claudia resume their search together and drive south. Outside Noto, they stop at a deserted village, and then find a hill overlooking the town where they make love while a train goes by. Later in town, they go to the Trinacria Hotel where they believe Anna is staying. Claudia asks Sandro to go in alone. While Claudia waits outside, a crowd of men gather around her. When she thinks she sees Sandro and Anna coming down the stairs she runs into a paint store, but Sandro follows and confirms that Anna is not there. Claudia remains torn between her feelings for Sandro and her friendship with Anna.\nAt the Chiesa del Collegio, a nun shows them the view from the roof. Sandro talks about his disappointments with his work, far removed from his youthful ambitions as an architect. Suddenly he asks Claudia to marry him, but she says no\u2014things are too complicated. She accidentally tugs on a rope that rings the church bells, which are answered by connected church bells at another church. Claudia is delighted by the sounds. The next morning, she wakes in a joyful mood, dancing and singing in the room while Sandro looks on amused. They both seem passionately in love. Sandro goes for a walk to the Piazza Municipio, where he notices an ink sketch left by one of the students. With his keychain he \"accidentally\" knocks over the ink onto the sketch. The student notices and confronts Sandro, who denies he did it on purpose. Sandro returns to the hotel and tries to make love to Claudia, but she resists, telling him they should leave.\nAt Taormina, they check into the San Domenico Palace Hotel where Sandro's employer Ettore and his wife Patrizia are preparing for a party. Claudia decides not to attend because she's tired. At the party, Sandro checks out the women\u2014recognizing Gloria Perkins. Back in the room, Claudia is unable to sleep. Noticing that Sandro has not yet returned, she goes downstairs to Patrizia's room to inquire about Sandro. Claudia confesses that she's afraid Anna has returned and that Sandro will return to her. After searching the hotel, Claudia finally discovers Sandro embracing Gloria on a couch. Claudia runs off, and Sandro follows her onto the hotel terrace where he finds her quietly weeping.

The spaceship is commanded by American John Anderson.\nHistorical and international tensions flare up during the flight. Russian Feodor Orloff struts about, annoyingly claiming that all scientific advancements were invented by the Soviets. Israeli David Ruskin warns Feodor that the USSR would be unwise to attempt to dominate Israel, as it has done to his native Poland. David admires fellow astronaut Erich Heinrich, unaware that Erich's father was the Nazi responsible for murdering David's family during the Holocaust.\nAfter a dangerous 27-hour flight, Lunar Eagle 1 lands and the crew begin their exploration of the Moon. Sigrid Bomark and Selim Hamid find an air-filled cave and, after shedding their space helmets, they kiss passionately. As they walk hand-in-hand deeper into the cave, its opening is suddenly sealed by impenetrable ice.\nThe others discover gold and minerals, but when they fire a mortar into a rock formation, liquid begins bubbling out. An excited Feodor rushes over and sticks his hands into the flow, and he is badly burned. On the way back to their spaceship, a crew member sinks to his death in lunar quicksand. John tries unsuccessfully to save him and is almost pulled under.\nInside Lunar Eagle 1, a machine begins printing hieroglyphics. Surprisingly, Hideko Murata can read them. It is a message from \"The Great Coordinator of the Moon,\" who orders the crew to leave at once. The message also states that the emotionless Moon-beings live underground and fear that the Earthlings will \"contaminate our perfect form of harmony.\" Sigrid and Salim are being studied because the Moon-beings are unfamiliar with \"love.\" They and \"all your kind\" will be destroyed \"if love turns to evil.\" The Moon-beings also demand that the expedition's cats, brought as an experiment to see if they could procreate on the Moon, be left behind. They find the cats as interesting as people.\nErich has a heart attack during Lunar Eagle 1's blastoff. As he babbles on half-conscious, David learns that Erich's father was the Nazi who killed David's family. However, when David learns that Erich has disowned his family and devoted his life to trying to make amends for his father's crimes, they become friends.\nNear Earth, the crew witnesses \"the big freeze,\" a gigantic freezing cloud controlled from the Moon, which encases all of Canada, the U.S. and Mexico in thick ice.\nJohn drops \"atomic bomblets\" into the volcano Popocatepetl to trigger a huge eruption to thaw out North America. Etienne Martel sabotages the bomblets, revealing himself to be a French communist. He incorrectly assumes that Feodor would also want to keep America frozen in order to advance international communism's quest for world domination. He and Etienne fight, Feodor calls to John for help and when Etienne unfairly pulls out a knife, John knocks the weapon out of his hand while knocking him down. Feodor repairs the bomblets.\nErich and David fly a suicide mission to drop the bomblets from their spaceship's smaller space taxi. Popocatepetl erupts and North America begins to thaw. Another message from the Moon says that the Moon-beings now realize that Earthlings are honorable and peaceful, and that the North Americans were put into suspended animation before the big freeze, so no one has been harmed.

Lieutenant Colonel William Travis is tasked with defending the Alamo, a former mission in San Antonio. Jim Bowie comes with reinforcements and the defenders prepare. Meanwhile, Davy Crockett arrives with a group of Tennesseans.\nSanta Anna's armies arrive and surround the fort. The siege begins. An embassy from the Mexican Army approaches the Alamo, and as they list the terms of surrender, Travis fires a cannon, signalling his refusal to surrender. In a nighttime raid, the Texans sabotage a super-sized cannon used by the Mexicans. They maintain high hopes as they are told a strong force led by Colonel James Fannin is on its way to break the siege. Crockett, however, sensing an imminent attack, sends one of his younger men, Smitty, to ask Houston for help, knowing this will perhaps save Smitty's life.\nThe Mexicans frontally attack the Alamo. The defenders hold out and inflict heavy losses on the Mexicans, although the Texans' own losses are not insignificant, and Bowie sustains a leg wound. Morale drops when a messenger informs Travis that Fannin's reinforcements have been ambushed and slaughtered by the Mexicans. The depiction is one of the many glaring historical inaccuracies plaguing the production, as Fannin\u2019s troop massacre actually took place three weeks after the fall of the Alamo, his failure to reinforce the Alamo usually attributable to Fannin\u2019s logistical ineptitude. Travis chooses to stay with his command and defend the Alamo, but he gives the other defenders the option of leaving.

The defenders kill numerous Mexicans, but the attack is overwhelming and the fortress' walls are breached. Travis tries to rally the men, but is shot and killed. Crockett leads the Texans in the final defense of the fort, but the Mexicans swarm through and overwhelm the defenders. Crockett is killed in the chaos when he is run through by a lance and then blown up as he ignites the powder magazine. Bowie, in bed with his wound, kills several Mexicans but is bayoneted and dies.

Travis stubbornly defends his decisions as commander of the garrison against the suggestions of the other two - particularly Bowie with whom the most bitter conflict develops - as well as trying to maintain discipline among a force made up primarily of independently minded frontiersmen and settlers. Crockett, well liked by both Bowie and Travis, eventually becomes a mediator between the other two as Bowie constantly threatens to withdraw his men rather than deal with Travis.

The night is interrupted when Tengku Zaleha is awoken by a voice calling out her name and upon searching, she encounters a dark figure by the window. Startled, she screams and faints, awaking her husband and Dr. Tengku Aziz. Both men search the premises but find nothing to explain Tengku Zaleha's situation. The dark figure walks home and is confronted by his cousin. His name is Ghazali and as explained in the conversation with his cousin, he has made numerous trips to Orchid Villa. That was the home of Tengku Zaleha, who we now learn, is dead. As he looks on in the rain, he tells the story.\nTengku Zaleha and Ghazali met on rainy day when her car got stuck in the mud. Upon her return to Orchid Villa, she is questioned by her father as to why she is soaking wet and when she told the story, she is reprimanded for socialising with people below her status. He reiterates of their royal lineage and how shameful it would be for her to even be seen with non-royal people. Tengku Zaleha then has a birthday party, to which Ghazali and his friends have been hired as the band. An attraction develops between them and when her father isn't home, Tengku Zaleha takes the opportunity to leave the house and meet Ghazali. During the turn of events, Ghazali is hired as the piano teacher for Tengku Zaleha. Their affection for each other grows but due to their differing social standings, she has to meet him in secret. One night, she is caught and is violently taken away whilst Ghazali is horribly beaten. Tengku Zaleha is presumed dead whilst Ghazali survives the assault but is burdened by the guilt of her murder and loss of the woman he loves.\nBack in the Orchid Villa, Tengku Zaleha is persuaded to play the piano but finds that one of the keys is out of tune. Tengku Zaleha suggests getting a piano tuner to repair it. When he is called upon, Ghazali is then forced by his cousin, Sudin, to take the job. He is perturbed by the sight of Tengku Zaleha who doesn't seem to recognise him as he enters the house. He finishes the job and as he is about to leave, Tengku Zaleha starts playing the song he had taught her when she was taking piano lessons. Sensing something amiss, Dr. Tengku Aziz decides to do a little investigating the following day and drops by Sudin's house to find out more about Ghazali. Sudin then tells him the whole story of how Tengku Zaleha was killed which drove Ghazali into the deep depression he was suffering. That night, Tengku Mukri is called away to Singapore and asks Dr. Tengku Aziz to keep an eye on Tengku Zaleha. She sneaks out in the middle of the night and is careful not to wake Dr. Tengku Aziz up but he sees her anyway and keeps quiet. She runs to the last meeting place she had met Ghazali before they were horribly separated and there, she finds him again. At first, she keeps up the pretense but then she begins to tell him the story of the night they were separated. After she had been brought back to Orchid Villa, her brother and father had given her something, an injection by a doctor to render her unconscious. When she awoke, she found herself in Singapore with her family. This time, her mother tries to fight for her but is killed by her half-brother and he is subsequently arrested, tried for the murder and sentenced to death. These turn of events had driven their father insane and he is then hospitalised in a mental asylum.

He shows proof of the contract they made which left Tengku Zaleha without much choice but to go through the wedding.\nAfter the wedding, she is asked by Tengku Mukri if she wanted to get away citing places as far away as Paris and Tokyo. But Tengku Zaleha said the only place she'd like to go to is Johore Bahru, which is where Orchid Villa is located. In another scene, we discover that Tengku Mukri is actually having an affair and intends to divorce Tengku Zaleha once he is able to steal all of her money away. After he returns to Orchid Villa, he is persuaded by Dr. Tengku Aziz to divorce Tengku Zaleha because he feels it is only right that she and Ghazali be together. Tengku Mukri agrees on condition that the man Tengku Zaleha marries is of noble blood like he is. When he finds out that it is Ghazali, of non royal blood, he refuses and throws Dr. Tengku Aziz out of the house because he feels that Dr. Tengku Aziz has insulted him for not having the same opinion of royalty as he does. He wants him to go back to Singapore and drives him off but then causes a road accident and tries to drive him off the road. When that fails, he shoots him and Dr. Tengku Aziz disappears in the bushes. He then takes his gun and hunts Ghazali down, intending to kill him but is stopped by first, Ghazali's mother and then Tengku Zaleha. He tries to shoot again but the gun jams and taking the opportunity, Ghazali pounces upon him and tries to wrestle the gun out of his hands.

Paul is anxious to introduce Nichole to his teenage daughter Jennifer (Gillian Hills), but Jennifer appears less than happy about her father's remarriage and coldly rejects Nichole's friendly overtures all evening. After Paul and Nichole go to bed, Jennifer sneaks out to the Off-Beat caf\u00e9 in Soho for an evening of rock music and dancing with her friends, including Dave (Adam Faith), a youth from a working-class background who plays guitar and writes songs; Tony (Peter McEnery), a general's son whose mother was killed in the Blitz and who has a drinking problem (although beatniks frown on alcohol); and Dodo (Shirley Anne Field), Tony's well-bred girlfriend. Dave and Jennifer are attracted to each other.\nThe next day Nichole plans to meet Jennifer at Saint Martin's School of Art, where she is studying, so they can have lunch together. At lunchtime, Nichole arrives at St Martin's, but is told that Jennifer has left and gone to the Off-Beat. Nichole goes to the caf\u00e9 and confronts Jennifer in front of her friends, who are impressed by Nichole's youth, good looks, and knowledge of modern jazz. The fact that her friends, especially Dave, seem to like Nichole upsets Jennifer. Nichole leaves, reminding Jennifer to be home for her father's important business dinner that night. As Nichole leaves, she passes Greta (Delphi Lawrence), the star performer at the strip club across the street.  Greta recognises Nichole and greets her by name, but Nichole ignores her, to Greta's annoyance. Jennifer and her friends see this encounter and wonder how Greta and Nichole might know each other. Jennifer suspects that Nichole was also a stripper before meeting her father.\nThat night at Paul's business dinner, Jennifer tries to embarrass Nichole in front of the guests by bringing up the encounter with Greta, making sure to emphasise that Greta is a stripper. After the guests leave, Paul questions Nichole, who says that she knew Greta in Paris and that they were in ballet together but Greta pursued a different way of life and Nichole lost track of her. Paul accepts her explanation, but Jennifer goes to the strip club to ask Greta directly. Greta at first claims she made a mistake and doesn't really know Nichole, but under pressure from her boyfriend, strip club manager Kenny King (Christopher Lee), she reveals that she and Nichole worked together as strippers and occasional prostitutes in Paris. Jennifer, encouraged by Kenny, becomes enamoured with the idea of becoming a stripper herself. Jennifer is caught by Paul and Nichole coming home from the strip club at 3 am and an angry confrontation results. Jennifer taunts Nichole by telling her she has spoken with Greta and threatens that if Nichole doesn't stay out of her life, Jennifer will tell Paul about Nichole's background. Nichole visits the strip club to tell Kenny and Greta to stay away from her stepdaughter, but Kenny says that Jennifer will be welcome at the club any time and that if Nichole interferes he will tell Paul about her past.\nJennifer and her friends have a wild night including dancing at Chislehurst Caves, a dangerous car race, and a game of \"chicken\" on railway tracks where the last person to leave the rails before the train arrives (Jennifer) wins. Throughout the evening, Jennifer and Dave dare each other to increasingly dangerous behaviours as a way of flirting. Jennifer invites everyone to continue the party at her house, as her father is out of town and Nichole presumably won't interfere for fear Jennifer will reveal her past. Jennifer accepts a dare to \"strip like a Frenchie\" and begins a striptease to music, but when she gets down to her underwear Nichole bursts from her bedroom and stops her. Then Paul suddenly arrives home and breaks up the party, throwing all of the beatniks out of his house including Dave. Jennifer angrily tells her father about Nichole's activities in Paris. Nichole, crying, admits it is true and explains she only did it because she was broke and hungry. Paul and Nichole profess their love for each other and reconcile.\nJennifer goes to the caf\u00e9, but now finds it boring. She walks out on her friends and meets Kenny across the street at the strip club. Kenny invites her to go to Paris with him and have him train her to be a star stripper.

Just as Kenny makes a pass at Jennifer, a woman's hand is shown stabbing Kenny to death with a letter opener. The club staff, thinking Jennifer killed Kenny, lock her up and call the police. Jennifer screams that she didn't do it, and the real culprit, jealous Greta, emerges from behind a curtain.

The circles descend on them, causing their car to crash. Both are killed. But their bodies suddenly jerk back to life as they're taken over by the white circles, which are actually extraterrestrials. The woman's face is badly cut from smashing into the windshield and the man's left arm has been torn off. When they exit the wrecked car, the male alien, Hauron (Jason Jackson), leaves his severed arm behind. The woman alien, Nadja (Katherine Victor), retrieves it and tells him that she'll sew it back on at the laboratory, in an artificial cave they've built as their headquarters.\nWhen Hauron reconnoiters Cape Canaveral one night, an MP's guard dogs attack him and tear off his recently reattached arm.

Tom says that the static coming in over a transistor radio means that an illegal transmitter is operating nearby and theorizes that it may have something to do with the launch failures. He and Sally search for the transmitter, but can't find it.\nThe four go back another night to look again, but while Tom and Sally are searching, Bob and Shirley are kidnapped by Hauron and Nadja. Bob dies during his capture, so Nadja removes his arm and grafts it onto Hauron. She says Bob had a handsome chin and replaces Hauron's scarred chin with it. Shirley and Bob are both transmitted to the aliens' planet, even though Bob is dead and the aliens have been admonished about sending dead or otherwise damaged specimens.\nNot knowing that Shirley and Bob have already been transmitted, Tom and Sally find the cave and are captured. They're kept intact, although held in place by an electronic device. Tom frees himself after discovering he can disable the device by waving his wristwatch's radium dial at it. He goes for help, but leaves Sally behind, forcing him to return because she is still a captive.\nHelp arrives in the form of sheriff's deputies, Army personnel and rocket scientists. They demand that Nadja and Hauron surrender themselves, but they're captured en masse. Hauron and Nadja incapacitate them, then revert to circle form to transmit themselves home.

While Ireland struggles for independence, Charles Norgate (Aldo Ray), an Irish American, arrives in London after being recruited by Irish revolutionaries to undertake a robbery of the Bank of England. Iris Muldoon, the widow of a martyr in the Irish independence movement, had previously travelled to New York to hire Norgate on behalf of the movement. The Irish revolutionaries, led by O'Shea (Hugh Griffith), plan to rob a million pounds' worth of gold bullion from the bank vaults as a political offensive. At first, the other revolutionaries are wary of Norgate but he gains their confidence by acknowledging his Irish lineage. Informed that the bank is considered impregnable, Norgate seeks a weakness in the Bank Picquet provided by the Brigade of Guards, which keeps watch on the gold.\nAfter a visit to a local public house frequented by Her Majesty's guardsmen, Norgate befriends Lt. Monte Fitch (Peter O'Toole) of the Guard. After expressing an interest in architecture, Fitch directs him to a museum that holds the original designs of the bank's architect. The following evening, Norgate breaks into the museum and traces the plans. Walsh (Kieron Moore), one of the revolutionaries that dislikes Norgate, is convinced that there is no weakness to be found in the bank's security. Walsh is enamored by Muldoon and attempts to persuade her to leave the movement and settle with him but she refuses. In addition, although Muldoon had an affair with Norgate in New York, she no longer wishes to be involved with him either.\nAfter being invited to the bank, Norgate gets Lt. Fitch to show him the location of the bank vaults and he counts the paces of the guardsmen to obtain a scale for the plans he traced earlier. When he learns that the guards are plagued by rats and that the floor has been reinforced, he goes to the Sewage Commission Records Department and discovers that a long-forgotten underground sewer runs directly under the bank vaults. Norgate finds an old knowledgeable tosher and after posing as an archaeologist trying to locate ancient Roman temple ruins, persuades the tosher to show him where the sewer had been sealed. The revolutionaries dig through an old entrance to the sewer and pickaxe their way into the wall leading directly under the vaults. They choose to carry out their heist on the first weekend in August, a long weekend wherein Monday is a bank holiday and most employees would be on vacation.\nLt. Finch begins to have suspicions about Norgate, whose professional intentions for being in London seem suspect. Later, further suspicious are aroused when Lt. Finch discovers that Norgate had suddenly checked out of his hotel room. While digging, one of the revolutionaries hits and punctures a gas pipe causing mantle lanterns to dim in the underground bank corridors. The absence of rats in the bank's underground levels as well as the sound of faint pickaxing compels Lt. Fitch to order that the vault doors be opened to see if the bank was being compromised. However, there are three bank agents each with a separate key to the vault and one of the keyholders has gone away on holiday. He sends two guards to find and fetch the missing keyholder, who is unhappy about being disturbed and rushed to the bank.\nMeanwhile, O'Shea announces that the Irish Home Rule Bill has been reintroduced in Parliament and that the bank heist must be halted to prevent jeopardising the bill's passage. O'Shea announces that the movement would dissociate itself from the thieves, prompting Muldoon to convince Walsh to accompany her and inform Norgate of the change in plans. However, discovering that Norgate has indeed broken through the floor of the bank vault, Walsh says nothing and begins to take gold bars down through the tunnel they dug. After managing to steal away a million pounds' worth of gold, they encounter Muldoon, who has sent away their escape tugboat. Despite her pleas, Norgate and Walsh load the gold onto a horse-drawn cart and Walsh leads it away on the streets. When Norgate realises that the tosher has not come out of the sewers, he goes back to search for him. The tosher, meanwhile, has revived after being overcome by the escaping gas, and arrives in the vault in search of Norgate, who is not the gentleman he thought he was. Norgate finally catches up with the tosher in the vault. At that moment, Lt. Finch and a section of guards open the vault doors. On the street, the cart has been greedily overloaded by Walsh and the weight of the gold breaks through in front of a passing bobby on duty.\nIn the last scene of the film, Norgate and Walsh are led to a police wagon in handcuffs as Iris Muldoon tearfully looks into Norgate's eyes.

He is drawn to the roadshow of Sister Sharon Falconer and is immediately attracted to the revivalist's saintly aura. As the troupe leaves town for Kansas, Gantry sweet talks her na\u00efve assistant Sister Rachel into disclosing information regarding Falconer's past, which he uses to con his way into her good graces. He joins the troupe preaching \"Christ in commerce\" and how he is a saved salesman.\nGantry and Falconer develop a \"good cop/bad cop\" routine, with Gantry telling the audience members that they will burn in Hell for their sins and Falconer promising salvation if they repent. Because of Gantry's fire and brimstone sermons, the group comes to the attention of the church council in Zenith, Winnemac, a larger city. Though Falconer's manager Bill Morgan does not think that she is ready to preach outside of the smaller venues, Gantry convinces her to go to Zenith. They meet with the church leaders, most of whom are wary of turning religion into a spectacle as Gantry does, but he convinces them that the churches must earn money to stay open and can increase their membership only if prospective members are first won over to Christ by attending Gantry's colorful revival meetings.\nTravelling along with Falconer is big-city reporter Jim Lefferts, who is torn between his disgust for religious hucksterism and his admiration for Gantry's charm and cunning. As Gantry's sermons bring Falconer's group to larger venues, Lefferts writes a series of articles labeling the revival a sham, and reveals that neither Falconer nor Gantry has any credentials. Falconer eventually admits to Gantry that her real name is Katie Jones, and that her origins are humbler than she publicly admits. Falconer also becomes Gantry's lover and loses her virginity to him.\nThe success of the Falconer-Gantry team comes to the attention of Lulu Bains, who became a prostitute when her youthful affair with Gantry ruined her standing in her minister father's eyes and Gantry ditched her. Acting as a moralist, Gantry unwittingly invades the brothel where Lulu works, but sends the prostitutes out of town when he sees Lulu. When he meets Lulu privately after she phones him, Lulu wants revenge against Gantry for running out on her in Kansas. Her love for Gantry returns, however,  when confronting him, and they embrace. A hidden photographer planted by Lulu records their embrace, but Gantry's love for Falconer prevents him from consummating his relationship with Lulu. Lulu  proceeds to frame Gantry out of jealousy for his love for Falconer. Lulu blackmails him, and Falconer is asked to bring $25,000 in exchange for the negatives of the incriminating pictures. Falconer brings the money, but Lulu refuses to accept it, and the pictures are then printed on the front page of the town's newspaper.\nLulu had at first offered Lefferts the exclusive story of Gantry's supposed sexual indiscretion, but he refused, shrugging off the pictures as merely proof that Gantry is as human as anyone else. An angry mob ransacks the tent revival following the publication of the incriminating photos in another newspaper, with Lulu witnessing Gantry's humiliation. As the mob curses Gantry and smears him with eggs and produce, Lulu is emotionally shaken and flees the scene. She returns to the brothel, which is now in a dilapidated state from Gantry's publicity stunt. Her pimp is there to collect the $25,000, but when Lulu tells him that she did not take Falconer's money, he beats her. Gantry comes to Lulu's rescue. He disposes of the pimp and apologizes to Lulu, who then publicly confesses to having framed Gantry.\nGantry returns to Falconer as a capacity crowd of followers fills her new tabernacle following Gantry's redemption in the press. Falconer declines Gantry's request to abandon her soul-saving ventures, insisting that she and Gantry were brought together by God to do His work. After Falconer appears to cure a follower of deafness, a fire that had been smoldering erupts suddenly. Unable or unwilling to see past her own religious zeal as flames engulf her tabernacle, Falconer remains on the premises and dies.

Innocenzi, along with some disbanded soldiers, manages to distance the German troops and is thoroughly shocked when, contrary to his plan of finding a higher echelon to which to report, most of the men accept the fact that the war is over for them and \"everybody should just go home\".\nThis reaction at first angers him, but in the end he joins army engineer Ceccarelli and sergeant Fornaciari in discarding their uniforms for civilian clothes and heading southwards for a veritable odyssey along the Italian \"boot\", cut in two by German and Allied occupation and wracked by partisan warfare, bloody reprisals, German press-ganging and other perils. The trio meets a band of anti-fascist guerrillas but decline to join them (while an Italian army captain they met along the road does). Later Innocenzi, caught in the \"everybody for himself\" mentality which seems to dominate the landscape, succumbs to the temptation of abandoning his mates to help a sultry black marketeer smuggle a load of flour to Rome, as she needs a driver and does not have room for any other passengers. The deal goes awry due to a mechanical failure in a rubble-strewn town where the famished populace plunders the lorry, and after some recriminations and a brief scuffle, Innocenzi rejoins his companions. They witness the killing of a rookie, a naive Italian soldier who tried to protect a Jewish girl during a German roundup; finally they manage to reach Fornaciari's rural home.\nThe former sergeant is delighted of having returned to his young wife, children and old father and offers Innocenzi and Ceccarelli hospitality for the night; his wife reveals that the family has been hiding a former U.S. POW who escaped from the Folpiano prison camp to protect him from the fascist militia patrols and Fornaciari, albeit grudgingly, accepts to keep protecting him. After a darkly humorous polenta dinner (served farm-style with salsa over a wooden table, where Innocenzi and the U.S. officer end up arguing over the right of reaching for the sausage length placed at the table's centre) they all go to sleep but a nighttime fascist patrol breaks in and manages to find the Allied serviceman. Amidst the children's cries and his wife's weeping, Fornaciari is hauled away toward a grim fate, and Ceccarelli and Innocenzi flee the premises without being able to help.\nThe couple manages to reach Littoria (now Latina), where Innocenzi's widowed father lives alone and offers Ceccarelli (who is Neapolitan) to stay a few days before resuming his travel south. Innocenzi is shocked when his father introduces him to a fascist party leader who is recruiting men for the army of the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, the fascist puppet state instituted by the Germans after the liberation of Benito Mussolini from his Gran Sasso exile. His father angrily responds to his objections, citing the misery he's living in and all the sacrifices he incurred to allow make him to study and become an army officer; a deep rift is created between father and son, and Innocenzi asks Ceccarelli to take him south to Naples as well, to which the engineer happily consents.\nHowever, Naples is in grimmer conditions than Rome, directly on the line of fire after the Allied landing at Salerno, barely kept under control by brutal German detachments who round up able-bodied men to send them to Germany as slave workers. To reach the city the duo passes through a roadblock manned by fanatical, hungry fascists; Ceccarelli, generously chooses to sacrifice a suitcase of delicacies he was meant to deliver to the wife of his commanding officer (who had signed his dismissal on health grounds due to his persistent stomach ulcer). The situation (with the offering readily accepted by the roadblock patrol) causes Innocenzi much panic, having had raided the case during a night-time train trip and substituting the goods with stones and newspaper sheets; he urges his companion to run away before the fascists open it, but they are unsuccessful.\nInnocenzi and Ceccarelli are pressed in an Organisation Todt rubble-clearing chain gang and manage to escape when the city rises against the occupiers in the Four days of Naples. Desperately trying to reach his home, which is just a few blocks away, Ceccarelli is cut down in a hail of German fire, at which time Innocenzi decides that the real war to be waged is that against the Nazi occupiers and joins an insurgent band offering to man the Breda M 37 machine gun they have captured but cannot operate.

Sheila is disgusted by the behavior of the rowdy Marines, but eventually warms up to Gabaldon after a few drinks.\nGoing ashore on Saipan, he freezes at first when he comes under fire for the first time, but regains his composure.

He faces opposition from his snobbish grown children, as well as a generation gap between himself and his much-younger fellow students. The first day in school, he finds that just convincing older students, faculty, and administrators that he is serious is a humorous task. He enrolls and receives freshman rooming, and is up front about his determination to be \"just another freshman\". He's assigned a quad rooming arrangement, which sets precedent for the upcoming years - dealing with the student press, the dorm adviser, and making that first toast with sauerkraut juice to seal their bond to complete their four years together.\nThe president's welcoming speech sets the tone for the effort facing the freshman class. Harvey has to convince the phys ed coach that he has what it takes to compete by doing ten plus one pull-ups to the cheers of his fellow younger frosh, only to collapse on his face upon finishing his set. Another frosh challenge is the bonfire that must exceed the height of the prior years. Harvey meets the French professor, Helen Gauthier, when removing a supporting wooden box from under her porch. The bonfire's total height comes up a foot short; Harvey climbs to the summit and deposits his three-foot chair. Having two brilliant roommates and jock Gil Sparrow (Fabian), the academic rigors are always fuel for comedy and camaraderie. Science Professor Thayer is haphazard, and numerous comedic moments ensue including chemicals that take on a life of their own, pairs of wires that should never be brought near each other during a storm, and improving one's skating skills except on thin ice.\nSophomore year again has Harvey being berated by his children, but the school's beat reporter is there to welcome him and puts up with the snobby kids. Harvey is off to meet his last year's roommates and the requisite toast to success. He is asked to join their fraternity and has the usual hazing period to endure, polishing shoes, washing floors, and the most challenging, dressing in drag and getting a retired colonel to sign his dance card at a costume ball. The elderly southern gentleman is suffering a gout attack and his social climbing children are attending the same event. While dancing with his son, Harvey so discombobulates him that his dress is torn in half, and while having it fixed in the ladies lounge, he floors his daughter. Back on the floor, Harvey bribes the band leader to play \"Dixie\", the colonel stands, Harvey pounces into his arms, dancing the length of the floor, deposits the sputtering colonel on his easy chair, has him autograph his dance card, throws his wig into his lap, and rushes the exit. The rest of the year is full of great football by Gil, academic pressure, and more antics by Prof. Thayer.\nJunior year starts with Harvey arriving in a red Mercedes convertible, and meeting the group at a Harvey Howard Smokehouse for a toast of goat milk, which only T.J. Padmanagham likes. The Smokehouse maitre D' at Harvey Howard's, super-snob Burdick, doesn't like one bit of this. His first task is to rudely challenge the group to order their meals, which is fine with Harvey, who orders Harvey Burgers with special sauce for the lot. Burdick sneers back that it's too early for the special sauce. Navy brat Bob Bannerman chimes in with \"... it's later than you think\". The burgers arrive and are dry, carbonized, and inedible. Harvey, who stands behind all burgers served in his Smokehouses, calls Burdick over to \"take them back\". Burdick challenges Harvey to do better, which he does.

When the movie opens, the owner of the town bookstore is placing a comical maquette in his shop window, featuring photos of students who are soon to graduate from the local high school as well as a photo of their elderly Latin teacher, Professor M\u00e1lek (played by Franti\u0161ek Smol\u00edk), as he points to the words \"Higher Principle,\" the nickname that the students have given him on account of his frequent quotation of Seneca's moral precepts. A local Nazi official takes offense at the lightheartedness of the maquette, considering it out of keeping with official mourning for Heydrich, and orders it removed.\nTeachers at the high school and its director worry that the episode will get them in trouble with the local Gestapo, but the students don't take it seriously, and in fact, when one notices a photo of Heydrich in the newspaper that his open-faced sandwich came wrapped in, he and a friend ink a comical mustache and beard onto the portrait. A more cautious student quickly shoves the caricature into the schoolroom stove, but later we see a student named Zaj\u00ed\u010dek, who is flunking most of his classes, washing soot off one of his hands. Zaj\u00ed\u010dek's father, played by a young Rudolf Hru\u0161insk\u00fd, happens to be in a relationship with a secretary at the town's Gestapo headquarters, and his shoestore is going bankrupt, giving him a motive for collaboration.\nAt a meeting of the school's teachers, Professor M\u00e1lek reads aloud a passage from Seneca that seems dangerously appropriate to the times, and to the relief of his fellow teachers, he says that he won't be assigning it as the text for the students' final Latin exam, but will instead be choosing a passage in Tacitus about a man who protested injustice with a hunger strike. The exam preoccupies the students, who ask to be excused from their Czech class in order to prepare for it. Vlasta Ry\u0161\u00e1nek (Ivan Mistr\u00edk), son of a washerwoman, can translate Latin extemporaneously, but most of his classmates find it a struggle, including Jana Sk\u00e1lov\u00e1 (played by Jana Brejchov\u00e1), who is in love with Vlasta, and depends on his coaching and crib sheets to pass exams. Her father is a lawyer and disapproves of her friendship with Vlasta, in part because Vlasta's mother does Jana's family's laundry.\nIn the middle of their year-end Latin exam, Gestapo officers arrest three classmates, including Vlasta, without any explanation. Professor M\u00e1lek visits Jana's father to ask him to intervene, and the lawyer eventually promises both M\u00e1lek and his daughter that he will try. But as Jana discovers, while spying on her father, he is too frightened even to enter Gestapo headquarters, despite having made an acquaintance with a strangely friendly Gestapo commander\u2014an acquaintance accidentally witnessed by a student who wasn't arrested, Honza Hor\u00e1k (Petr Kostka), who is trying to help Jana find out what's happening to Vlasta and his companions. After Jana tells Professor M\u00e1lek of her father's loss of nerve, he visits the Gestapo commander himself at his home. To M\u00e1lek's surprise, the commander says that when he was in the boy scouts, he was taught to do a good deed every day, and that he'll do one for M\u00e1lek.\nBut by the time he returns to his office, the three boys have already been sentenced and taken away to be shot. To save face, the Gestapo office reassures M\u00e1lek that \"the matter has been settled,\" and Jana carries the reassurance to Vlasta's mother, reaching her just as the Nazis are announcing her son's execution over the town's loudspeakers.

Nubbin is the most active pup and frequently explores the farmyard. One day his curiosity leads him inside a butter churn that Jeff is about to return to a neighbor, and Jeff loads the churn onto his old truck and drives off with Nubbin still inside. During the trip, the churn falls off the truck, rolls down the road, over an embankment and breaks up against a tree. Nubbin emerges from the wreckage dizzy and lost, but eventually finds the hollow tree where Mala is nursing Weecha. Although hounds and raccoons are natural enemies, Mala nurses Nubbin and mothers him.\nTwo weeks pass and as Nubbin explores the area, he encounters Old Grouch, Weecha's father, who attacks him. Mala intervenes and fights her mate, who later leaves the area. By the time summer arrives, Nubbin and Weecha are firm friends and have several adventures together. One day while chasing a rabbit, Nubbin is threatened by a bobcat, but Mala lures the bobcat away from him and gives her life to save the dog. Now alone, Weecha and Nubbin search for food and when they come upon Jeff fishing, steal his fish. Jeff realizes that Nubbin is Lulubelle's missing pup and captures both of them, putting Weecha in an unused rabbit hutch. Jeff is surprised when Nubbin refuses to abandon his friend, and later, Weecha manipulates the latch on his cage and escapes for a nighttime romp with Nubbin, during which he wrecks Jeff's workshop. When an iron rod falls against a grinding wheel Weecha has accidentally started, sparks fly and start a fire, but Weecha races back to his cage. After Jeff is awakened by his hounds' barking and extinguishes the fire, he discovers Weecha and Nubbin sleeping innocently.\nThree weeks later, Jeff begins to train Nubbin and his other young hounds to locate raccoons by following their scent.

This was after the Korean War, where economic strife became more prevalent in a time of national division, and so women were sent away to earn more money for their families. Women would often live in these factories, so many extracurricular activities were offered for time outside of work hours. Mr. Kim is incredibly popular among the women at the factory, due to his 'good looks', which entice Kyeung-Hee 'Miss Cho' Cho.

An influential newspaperman, E.K. Hornbeck of the Baltimore Herald, has persuaded Drummond to represent Cates, and ensured that his newspaper and a radio network will provide nationwide coverage of the case.\nRev. Brown publicly rallies the townspeople against Cates and Drummond. The preacher's daughter Rachel is conflicted because she and Cates are engaged. When Rachel cries out against her father's condemnation, Brady admonishes Brown by quoting Proverbs 11:29: \"He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind.\"\nThe courtroom takes on a circus atmosphere with radio broadcasting, newspaper photography and spectator outbursts during the trial. Each time Drummond calls a scientist or authority figure to discuss Darwin's theories, the judge sustains the prosecution's objections and forbids such testimony, ruling that Cates, not evolution, is on trial. Drummond grows frustrated, feeling the case has already been decided. When he asks to withdraw from the case, the judge holds Drummond in contempt of court, orders him jailed, and tells Drummond to show cause the next morning why he should not be held in contempt of court. John Stebbins offers his farm as collateral for Drummond's bail. Stebbins' son was a friend and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Cates who drowned after developing a cramp while swimming. Brown had said the child was damned to hell because he was not baptized. This led to Cates abandoning the church, as he felt it was not fair that a child could not enter Heaven due to an action that was beyond his control.\nThat night, mocking crowds go by the jail and then to the hotel where Drummond is staying. Drummond is trying to decide how to present his defense without his witnesses and states that he needs a miracle. Hornbeck throws him a Bible from Brady, stating \"There are plenty in there.\" As Hornbeck pours some drinks and turns to Drummond, he is surprised by Drummond holding the Bible and smiling.\nDrummond calls Brady himself to the witness stand. Brady's confidence in his Biblical knowledge is so great that he welcomes this challenge, but becomes flustered under Drummond's cross-examination, unable to explain certain Biblical events, until he is forced to confess that at least some Biblical passages cannot be interpreted literally. Drummond hammers home his point \u2014 that Cates, like any other man, demands the right to think for himself, and those citing divine support as a rationale to silence him are wrong.\nThe jury finds Cates guilty, but, the judge, concerned with political embarrassment, fines him only $100 ($1,545 in current dollars). Brady is furious and tries to enter a speech into the record, but Drummond persuades the judge to disallow it as the trial has concluded. As court adjourns, Brady tries to give his speech but most ignore him outside of his wife and his opponents at the defense table \u2014 Cates, Rachel, Hornbeck, and Drummond. As he becomes increasingly hysterical, he suffers a \"busted belly\" and dies.\nAfter the crowd has cleared out, Hornbeck talks with Drummond, wanting to use the Bible quotation from Brown's rally, where Brady had quoted the \"inherit the wind\" verse because Rev. Brown was about to damn his own daughter to hell. Drummond quotes the verse verbatim, shocking Hornbeck, who states, \"Well, we're growing an odd crop of agnostics this year!\" They argue over Brady's legacy, Drummond accuses Hornbeck of being a heartless cynic, and Hornbeck walks out, leaving Drummond alone in the courtroom. Drummond picks up the Bible and Darwin's book (On the Origin of Species), balancing them in his hands before walking out with both of them.", "tmdb_plot": "Schoolteacher Bertram Cates is arrested for teaching his students Darwin's theory of evolution.

The guests are his cousins Airi and Aimo Ryk\u00e4m\u00f6, Airi's fianc\u00e9 Erik Vaara, who works for the concern and strongly dislikes Bruno, and Irma Vanne, the daughter of vuorineuvos Vanne. In order to scare them as they arrive, Bruno has dressed up as the Grim Reaper. \n\nThe next morning, inspector Frans J. Palmu and detectives Virta and Kokki are informed that Bruno has drowned in his indoor swimming pool after slipping on a bar of soap. They head to the Rygseck house to conduct a routine investigation. The party guests (with the exception of Vanne), as well as Bruno's aunt Amalia Rygseck and his estranged wife Alli Rygseck, are present at the house, as all of them had had something to discuss with Bruno that morning. As Palmu inspects the bathroom, he begins to suspect that Bruno was in fact murdered. When the policemen are shown around the house by Bruno's manservant, Veijonen, they find Vanne and famous author K.V. Laihonen engrossed in lively conversation in the basement. They are oblivious to the morning's events, as they had entered the house through the back door when coke was delivered in the early morning and have since been in the basement. Although Laihonen does not know Bruno or Vanne from before, he had been invited to the house by her to get back the stolen manuscript of his unpublished novel.\nThe atmosphere in the house becomes increasingly hostile towards the investigation as Palmu asks more detailed questions about the morning's events. He learns that the previous night, Aimo had stolen Amalia's cat and brought it with him to the dinner party, where Bruno had poisoned it and invited her to view the cadaver for his amusement. Despite Palmu's suspicions, the investigation is closed due to pressure from the powerful Rygsecks and because there is no evidence to prove that the death was not accidental. Laihonen asks the policemen and Vanne to join him at the luxurious Hotel K\u00e4mp for a late lunch.\nAt K\u00e4mp, Vanne tells the policemen more about the previous night. They had been playing a game in which each contestant has to commit a crime that the victim cannot report to the police. The winner was to be chosen by Vaara at the party. Her crime had been to steal the manuscript; Aimo's to steal the cat; and Airi's to have ten of Aimo's promissory notes signed by Bruno. She had refused to reveal how she had gotten them, other than that it was blackmail. Bruno had then asked Vaara to come to his bedroom in order to show him his crime in private. Afterwards, Vaara had stormed out of the house in fury, after stating that Bruno had won the contest.\nWhen Palmu and the detectives arrive back at the police station late in the afternoon, they are told that Alli Rygseck has been poisoned with prussic acid mixed in her absinthe. She had been back at the Rygseck house to discuss with the family members who was to inherit from Bruno: she had insisted that she should get the house. Bruno's case is now also re-opened, and the policemen head back to the house. Palmu interrogates Airi about the promissory notes, and she reveals that Aimo had been forging Bruno's signature to pay off his gambling debts. Bruno had told her that he would contact the police about it unless she were to agree to do something, although she refuses to specify exactly what. In Bruno's bedroom, Palmu finds an album of nude photographs he had taken of his female friends, with one page torn off.\nThat evening, the policemen meet Bruno's uncle Gunnar Rygseck, the head of the Ryk\u00e4m\u00f6 concern, at his office. He tries to bribe Palmu and claims that Bruno was suicidal and had intended the poisoned absinthe for himself before dying accidentally. Next, Palmu confronts Vaara, whose office is in the same building, about what Bruno showed him. It is revealed to have been a nude photograph of Airi, which Palmu notices is a forgery. He tells Vaara that Aimo killed Bruno and that Airi will be imprisoned as an accomplice as she has tried to protect her brother: this leads Vaara to confess to Bruno's murder. Palmu asks for Airi, who also works for the concern, to come to Vaara's office. She confirms that the photograph is forged, and finds the idea that her brother killed Bruno laughable. Vaara takes back his confession, and Palmu admits that he never truly believed either him or Aimo to be the murderer.\nPalmu calls the Rygseck house, where Amalia is moving in, and is told by her that Veijonen has disappeared. Palmu goes to interrogate Vanne again, and she confesses to have in fact secretly stayed in Alli Rygseck's old bedroom on the night of the party. When she walked through the corridor leading to the bathroom the next morning in order to get to the back door, she thought that a stair creaked behind her, as if someone else was there as well. Palmu places her on house arrest at Laihonen's apartment.\nIn order to get the murderer to act, Palmu sends detective Virta to tell all the suspects that Vanne knows something about the murders. He is also to get Bruno's photo album from the Rygseck house and to go show it to Vanne. At the house, Amalia convinces Virta to give her his gun for protection as she is scared of Veijonen. When Virta returns to the station, he learns that Veijonen has been caught and is cleared of the murders. Soon after, Palmu calls Laihonen and asks to speak to Vanne. He admits that she has gone to help Amalia search the house \u2013 he had lied to the gullible Virta earlier that she was asleep. The police rush back to the Rygseck house, and stop Amalia from shooting Vanne. In the struggle, Virta is shot in the shoulder.\nIn the final scene, it is revealed that Amalia has been mentally ill for some time and that she murdered Bruno as revenge for killing her cat. The murder weapon was her umbrella with a sturdy wooden handle that she always carried with her.

After this, the scene changes to the deserted Highway 17, as a flying saucer from outer space lands and surveys the surrounding area with a periscope. At a city dump nearby, Bugs Bunny returns home, thinking he should move somewhere else, on account of the neighborhood \"gettin' terribly rundown.\"\nInside the spaceship, Yosemite Sam of Outer Space, dressed in a green gloveless spacesuit, sees Bugs on his view screen. Summoning Robot ZX29B to the bridge, he orders the robot to go out and capture Bugs as part of their Earth mission. ZX29B trundles out of the spaceship to Bugs' hole and peeks down at him cleaning up after breakfast, making Bugs get the feeling he's being watched. ZX29B hides among some garbage cans when Bugs comes up from the hole with a pail of trash, making a note to remember to make an electronic trash disposal. Bugs thinks ZX29B is a new garbage can, and so he promptly opens his mouth like a lid and empties his trash into him. When Bugs leaves, ZX29B comes out coughing up the garbage.\nAngered at the failure of the \"stupidest robot [he's] got\", Yosemite Sam summons the Demolition Squad, a trio of red robots, to the bridge and orders them to destroy Bugs. The robots, each with a fuselit barrel-shaped bomb, go into the dump. Seeing them coming, Bugs panics at the sight of the \"spacemen\" and dives into the pipe leading down to his underground bomb shelter. The robots proceed to dump their bombs down the pipe, and leave to head back to the ship. Escaping the shelter through a back way, an angered Bugs tosses a giant magnet down the pipe to \"take care of those mechanized mobsters\". The entire squad is pulled down the pipe, where the bombs explode and blow the squad to smithereens, prompting a Medic Robot to appear and sweep up the mess.\nAngered at the Demolition Squad's failure, Sam decides he will go after Bugs himself and hops into an indestructible tank that he drives into the dump. When Sam scans the dump, he sees Bugs come up in a machine, that opens the tank hatch so it can drop a lit stick of dynamite into the tank. Sam tosses the dynamite out, but the machine drops it back in and rivets the hatch shut. Sam tries to hammer out the rivets, but the dynamite explodes sending Sam to drive his crippled tank back to the ship.\nAt this time, Bugs decides to make his getaway by taking a handcar from the Flag Station.

The spaceship picks him up with an extending plunger and pulls him back into itself.\nSam catches up to Bugs via rocket pack and stops him at ray gun point. When Sam brags that Earth creatures can't maneuver very well, Bugs proves him wrong by spinning his ears like the blades on a helicopter and flies away. Sam shouts a catchphrase (\"Yosemite Sam of Outer Space!\") and tries to catch up by rocket pack, but misses when Bugs moves. When Bugs lands in a hole, Sam decides to wait so he can disintegrate Bugs the moment he comes out. While waiting, Bugs goes underground into an old tree stump behind Sam and secretly replaces his rocket pack with a lit stick of dynamite. Bugs flies out of the stump, and Sam, ready to chase after him, shouts his catchphrase just as the dynamite explodes and destroys his spacesuit (\"Yosemite Sam of Outer - BANG! - Space?\").\nBack at the dump, Sam uses his Robot Ferret in his next attempt to catch Bugs.

After the latest raid, during which Calvera kills a villager, the village leaders decide they have had enough. On the advice of the village elder, they decide to fight back. Taking their few objects of value, three villagers ride to a town just inside the United States border hoping to barter for weapons. They are impressed by Chris Adams, a veteran Cajun gunslinger, and approach him for advice. Chris suggests they instead hire gunfighters to defend the village, as \"men are cheaper than guns.\" At first agreeing only to help them recruit men, Chris eventually decides to lead the group. Despite the meager pay offered, he finds five willing gunmen.\nThe five other gunmen are the gunfighter Vin Tanner, who has gone broke after a round of gambling and resists local efforts to recruit him as a store clerk; Chris's friend Harry Luck, who assumes Chris is hiding a much bigger reward for the work; the Irish Mexican Bernardo O'Reilly, who has fallen on hard times; Britt, an expert in both knife and gun who joins purely for the challenge involved; and the dapper, on-the-run gunman Lee, plagued by nightmares of fallen enemies and haunted that he has lost his nerve for battle. On their way to the village, they are trailed by the hotheaded Chico, an aspiring gunfighter whose previous attempts to join Chris had been spurned. Impressed by his persistence, Chris invites him into the group.\nArriving at the village, they work with the villagers to build fortifications and train them to defend themselves. They note the lack of women in the village until Chico stumbles upon Petra and discovers the women were hidden in fear that the gunmen would rape them. The gunmen begin to bond with the villagers, and Petra pursues Chico. When Bernardo points out that the gunmen are being given the choice food, the gunmen share it with the village children.\nThree of Calvera's men are dispatched to reconnoitre the village; due to a mistake by Chico, the seven are forced to kill all three rather than capture at least one. Some days later Calvera and his bandits arrive in force. The seven and the villagers kill another eight of their cohorts in a shootout and run them out of town. The villagers celebrate, believing Calvera will not return. But Chico infiltrates Calvera's camp and learns that Calvera must return, as his men are short of food.\nSome fearful villagers thereupon call for the gunfighters to leave. Even some of the seven waver, but Chris insists that they stay, even threatening to kill anyone who suggests giving up the fight. The seven ride out to make a surprise raid on Calvera's camp, but find it abandoned. Returning to the village, they are caught by Calvera and his men, who have colluded with some of the villagers to sneak in and take control. Calvera spares the seven's lives, believing they have learned the simple farmers are not worth fighting for and fearing reprisals from the gunfighters' \"friends\" across the border. Preparing to depart, Chris and Vin admit they have become emotionally attached to the village. Bernardo likewise gets angry when the boys he befriended call their parents cowards. Chico declares that he hates the villagers; when Chris points out he grew up as a farmer as well, Chico angrily responds that it is men like Calvera and Chris who made the villagers what they are.\nThe seven gunmen are escorted some distance from the village, where their weapons are returned to them. They debate their next move and all but Harry, who believes the effort will be futile and suicidal, agree to return and fight.\nThe gunmen infiltrate the village and a gunfight breaks out. Harry, who has had a change of heart, returns in time to save Chris's life but is himself fatally shot. Harry pleads to know what they were fighting for, and Chris lies about a hidden gold mine to let Harry believe he died for a fortune; Harry smiles before dying. Lee finds the nerve to burst into a house where several villagers are being held, shooting their captors and releasing the prisoners to join the fight, but is gunned down as he leaves the house. Bernardo, shot protecting the boys he befriended, tells them as he dies to see how bravely their fathers fought. Britt dies after shooting at many bandits but exposing himself from cover. Chris shoots Calvera, who asks him, \"You came back... to a place like this? Why? A man like you? Why?\" He dies without receiving an answer. The remaining bandits take flight.\nThe three surviving gunmen ride out of town. As they stop atop a hill overlooking the village, Chico parts company with them, realizing he wants to stay with Petra. Chris and Vin bid farewell to the village elder, who tells them that only the villagers have really won, whereas the gunslingers are \"like the wind, blowing over the land and passing on.\" As they pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris admits, \"The Old Man was right.

Hans hurriedly carries her to her bedroom, and notices strange lesions appear on her face before she suddenly dies.\nThat night, Hans is plagued by haunting visions of Elfie in the attic. He subsequently hears a piano playing downstairs, and confusedly believes it is Elfie, but the music ceases when he calls her name. Directed by what seems to be Gregorius's disembodied voice, he finds Elfie lying dead in a tomb in a nearby cemetery. Fleeing back to the mill, he awakens Gregorius, and begins questioning him about Elfie. Moments later, Elfie descends the staircase, alive and seemingly unscathed. Gregorius arranges to have Hans leave the mill, accusing him of being mentally unbalanced.\nWhen Hans leaves, Gregorius and Dr. Bohlem reveal their plot: they deliberately drugged him to make him appear insane, thus giving a reason for him to be ejected from the mill and separated from the obsessive Elfie. That night, Dr. Bohlem and Gregorius bring Annelore, a local woman whom they have kidnapped, to a makeshift procedure room hidden in the mill. There they drain Annelore of her blood, killing her, and transfuse it to Elfie, reviving her. Gregorius then uses Annelore's corpse as one of his next art projects\u2014his sculptures of women are, in fact, real victims encased in wax.\nMeanwhile, Hans convalesces with Liselotte and her friend, Ralf. However, Hans is still troubled by his apparent hallucinations at the mill, and recalls seeing the missing Annelore tied to a chair in the basement. Hans and Ralf subsequently discover that Liselotte has gone missing, and rush to the mill to locate her. There they find Annelore's corpse coated in wax, in preparation for her addition to Gregorius's display. Meanwhile, Gregorius and Bohlem prepare to use an antidote Bohlem has developed, which they intend to transfuse into Elfie using Liselotte's blood. However, when Bohlem professes his love for Elfie, Gregorius attacks him, eventually stabbing him to death. Gregorius attempts to begin the transfusion himself, but finds that the bottle containing Bohlem's antidote shattered in his pocket when he collapsed.

But her parents are appalled by what they hear and decide to file a complaint. The accused man, Clarence Olderberry Sr., is however the doyen of the wealthiest, most highly regarded and influential family in town and matters conspire to turn against the Carters as the townspeople start to close rank against the newcomers. The police chief casts doubt on Jean's story, while Olderberry's son warns the Carters that if they pursue the matter through the legal system, he will ensure that Jean's evidence and trustworthiness will be torn to shreds in court.\nWhen the case comes to trial, it is with an obviously stacked jury and in an atmosphere of extreme hostility towards the Carters.

Things are especially difficult for the Jewish population that's marked for extermination.\nIn order to save Ruth, a Jewish girl, from the Nazis and their collaborators, a Croatian Catholic family arranges for her to marry their young son, Ivo. The young man, despite understanding the necessity of this arrangement, is unhappy with this sudden end to his careless youth and at first seems to dislike the girl, dismissing her as \"a mere child\" and continuing to go out with his best friend Magda, who he is also romantically interested in. Magda, who is aware of his marriage, quickly seeks to distance herself from his advances, and when a drunk Ivo calls her to his bachelor party, resulting in a highly uncomfortable situation for her, their prospective relationship ends. Angered by this, Ivo has an emotional outbreak upon returning home, causing Ruth to run out into the dark streets, where she attempts to deliberately expose herself to a passing patrol, only to be saved at the last second by Ivo's father.\nIvo himself comes to the realization that his behaviour to this point has not only been reckless and selfish, but also dangerous, displaying a high degree of ignorance regarding the true severity of the situation. Following this epiphany, he soon comes to form a closer emotional relationship with his wife, spending time with her and even taking her out to a park, despite Jews not being allowed to do this. Things take a turn for the worse, however, when a member of the Usta\u0161e who has previously lived in the same house as Ruth recognizes and publicly humiliates her by forcing her to clean his shoes. The situation is only de-escalated when Zvonko, one of Ivo's classmates who has also joined the Usta\u0161e, notices him and tells the man to let them go. Zvonko later bullies Ivo in class by marking his coat with the letter \u017d, which stands for \u017didovi, the Croatian word for Jew. When Ruth sees this, she is terrified, and Ivo tries to calm her down by marking several objects in the room around them with the same symbol, calling it \"just a letter\". He also gives her a miniature park to make up for her not being able to go there anymore.\nDuring a bomb alert, the streets are deserted, and Ruth uses this opportunity to go out on her own and enjoy a rare moment of freedom and levity. Her joy soon turns to ashes, however, as she sees her father's name on a bulletin board, indicating that he was hanged, which causes her to break down crying. The alarm ends and people return to the streets, and when an officer notices Ruth, he asks her for her last name, which she gives as Alakalaj, despite her legal last name now being Vojnovi\u0107.

He asks several inmates before a woman points out the possibility of Ruth being held in the infamous Ninth Circle, which she also refers to as \"harem\". Ivo, now moving closer to the camp's centre, encounters his former friend Zvonko, who works as a guard there and cynically attempts to paint life in the camp in a positive light. They come across a group of children with a man talking them into entering a car, but when the doors close, Ivo horrifiedly notices a gas cylinder labelled with a skull, realizing that the car is in fact a gas van.\nAs they approach the Ninth Circle, Zvonko tells Ivo that all the women there are due to be murdered this very night, adding that he might have \"one last go\" at Ruth before that, which causes Ivo to knock him unconscious or possibly kill him.

This leads to rejoicing at the Ministry of Education, and in Barset, the school's village home, where Sergeant Ruby Gates (Joyce Grenfell) and Superintendent Samuel Kemp-Bird (Lloyd Lamble) can finally plan their marriage, which is predicated on the end of St. Trinian's. However, beautiful sixth-form pupil Rosalie Dawn (Julie Alexander) has been flirting with Slender during the trial, where she gives him her telephone numbers, and continues flirting at the sentencing session. Consequently, when Professor of Philosophy Canford (Cecil Parker) of the University of Baghdad suggests that, rather than punishment, the girls need sympathy, and explains that he has funds to buy a new school building, and with the help of noted educator Matilda Harker-Packer (Irene Handl), the girls can be rehabilitated, Judge Slender ignores the guilty verdict and gives him a year to accomplish his aims. This causes dismay at the Ministry, where Butters (Thorley Walters), on the advice of his psychiatrist, does a pastoral dance to calm his nerves. The revival of St. Trinian's also means the end of Gates' and Kemp-Bird's marriage plans. The girls, led by Prof. Canford, new Headmistress Harker-Packer, and the new teaching staff, move into the former Hannington Manor, now the new St. Trinian's school building.\nTo demonstrate the positive effects the sympathetic educational approach is having on the girls Harker-Packer, acknowledging it will be a disaster, suggests the school present a cultural festival in a month, featuring a fashion show, a painting demonstration, and a dramatic presentation. Ministry officials Culpepper Brown (Eric Barker) and Butters are invited and their superior, Under Secretary Gore Blackwood (Dennis Price), encourages them to go and make detailed notes about the show, which they all believe will be a fiasco, in the hope that, with their report, they can convince the Minister of Education (John Le Mesurier) to shut the school. The show is indeed a fiasco: the fashions displayed by the girls are scandalous; the action-painting demonstration turns into a paint-flinging fight; and the dramatic presentation by Rosalie is Hamlet's soliloquy accompanied by a striptease. Certain the Minister will close the school when they present their report, Culpepper Brown, Butters and Blackwood are crushed when the Minister explains that the fashions are due to be shown in London, a reputable gallery will exhibit the art, and the Stratford theatre will present the girls' Hamlet. All three now use the pastoral dance to calm their nerves.\nBack at St. Trinian's, the sixth-form girls and Flash Harry Cuthbert Edwards (George Cole) see Alphonse O'Reilly (Sidney James), sporting a cowboy-style hat (and immediately dubbed \"Wyatt Earp\" by the girls), arrive in a big car, stay for a short time and leave. Harry thinks that something is amiss, but doesn't know what. Now Canford suggests that he take the sixth-form girls on a cultural tour of the Greek Islands, which will be financed by his backer, and the Ministry approves the voyage. Kemp-Bird feels there is something fishy going on and gets Sgt. Gates to stowaway on the yacht. Harry also goes along and, one day while he and the girls are on deck, they find that \"Wyatt Earp\" is also aboard the yacht. This gives Harry a very uneasy feeling: something is amiss. That night, someone \u2013 obviously a woman \u2013 manages to look at the ship's log and finds that they are off the East African coast. Meanwhile, uneasy at not having seen land for days, Canford confronts O'Reilly regarding their destination and money due to him: O'Reilly tells Canford that he will get no more money and, when they did the deal, he was told their destination. Upset by this answer, he goes to see Harry, but someone knocks at Harry's cabin door, and Canford tells Harry to meet him on deck in a half hour. The interruption was caused by the telegraph operator Octavius (Monte Landis), who has been lured away from his post by a message to him as \"Lover Boy\", asking him to meet \"Lavinia\" in the cabin actually occupied by Harry. While Octavius is gone, someone sends a telegraph message. Harry meets Canford on deck but, before they can talk, they notice the smell of gravy and discover Gates, cooking her dinner, in the covered lifeboat next to them. When they hear someone coming, they climb into the lifeboat with Gates. While she explains that they are not near Greece, but off the East African coast, O'Reilly and the ship's captain discover them, and O'Reilly has the lifeboat lowered into the sea. The three begin rowing, eventually spot a desert island and land there as castaways.\nBack in Barset, Kemp-Bird receives Gates' telegram and contacts the Ministry, who contact the army. The army sends word of the problem to the only unit in the East Arabian area, a mobile bath unit led by Major Hargreaves (Nicholas Phipps) and Captain Thompson (Cyril Chamberlain), and tells them that a plane carrying supplies, liquor and Ministry of Education officials is on the way. Blackwood sends Culpepper Brown and Butters on the mission, as they are the only Ministry officials who can identify the girls. Back at St. Trinian's, the fourth-form girls manage to find out some of this news, then break into the Ministry to find out the rest. After the plane takes off, Culpepper Brown and Butters find that it is loaded with fourth-form girls, who eventually throw them, with parachutes and an inflatable raft, into the East Arabian Sea. They wind up on the same desert island as the other castaways. When the Ministry men mention they could see land when they were pushed from the plane, the whole group packs up and heads for Arabia and the nearest town, Makrab. At the army camp, the girls have been rounded up and confined, surrounded by barbed wire. The captain then receives news that the Ministry officials are in Makrab and is ordered to go there, with a back-up group of soldiers, to find them. When they leave, the girls use the liquor from the plane to get the remaining soldiers so drunk that they pass out, and take over the base. In Makrab, the Captain and Major find the Ministry group at a cafe. Culpepper Brown and Butters go of to find the British consul (Harold Berens), who pairs them with two girls, who get the men so drunk they pass out. When Harry notices \"Lover Boy\" on the street, he, Canford, Gates, the Captain and the Major follow him to a striptease club, where Harry recognises Rosalie on a poster advertising \"Farida\". That night they go to the club and find Rosalie who tells them that \"Lover Boy\" smuggled her off the boat, but the other girls are in danger, imprisoned at the palace of a local Emir (Elwyn Brook-Jones), whose sons want to marry them which, with Canford's collusion, had been O'Reilly's plan all along.\nThe officers go to muster their forces, while Harry and Canford go to visit the Emir. Gates gets there on her own and enters the palace by helping to carry in the laundry. To the Emir's displeasure, the girls are defending themselves quite well. Harry, Canford and Gates offer to reason with the girls, and are allowed to visit them for five minutes: when they can't provide results, the Emir's men attack again, again with little success. Just as this fight is ending, the army arrives but is promptly captured. Things look bleak, when they hear the St. Trinian's school song in the distance, followed by the arrival of the fourth-form girls in army vehicles, who smash their way into the compound, forcing the Emir and his forces to run away.\nBack in Britain, the girls and Sgt. Gates are hailed as heroes. In Barset, Gates, after 16 years of being engaged, is about to get married, when the ceremony is interrupted with news that the girls are again burning down the school, and Kemp-Bird runs off, even as Gates is walking down the aisle.

A son was born to Swaroop Singh and his wife Rambai Bundela, whom they named Tej Singh Bundela pronounced as Desingu in Tamil. Swaroop Singh has a secret Muslim concubine called Jaan Bibi, and they have a son called Dawood Khan, who was a little older than Desingu. Fearing that Dawood might pose a threat to the succession of the throne in years to come, on the advice of his commander and close confidant Yusuf Khan, Swaroop Singh persuades Jaan Bibi to leave Senji, taking little Dawood with her. Desingu, who has integrity and courage grows up with his childhood friend, another brave young man called Mohammed Khan, and two are always inseparable.\nAt this juncture, the Sultan of Delhi offers to free any state coming under his dominion whose ruler manages to tame a wild horse in his stable. Hearing this in the intention to have a free kingdom, Swaroop Singh leaves to Delhi without letting know Rambai and Desingu. Despite trying very hard, he failed to tame the wild horse and was imprisoned by the Sultan of Delhi. Upon hearing this, the minister informs Desingu, who rushes to Delhi where he meets his uncle Bheem Singh Bundela for advice. The dauntless Desingu manages to tame the stallion and ride it, to the loud cheers of the huge audience. Filled with admiration, the Sultan frees Swaroop Singh, who had earlier failed in this endeavour and gives them a written proclamation of Senji's independence. Desingu marries Ranibai Bundela, who is Bheem Singh's daughter. Pandiyan, who works in the horse stable comes along to Senji and works as assistant to Mohamad Khan's father and falls in love and marries Sengkamalam, who is also Mohamad Khan's adopted sister.\nMeanwhile, growing up as an illegitimate child, Dawood vows to rule Senji some day. But on her deathbed, Jaan Bibi extracts a promise from Dawood that he would not cause any harm to Desingu. Dawood goes to Arcot and wins the confidence of the Nawab, when he rescues the Nawab's infant son from being crushed under an elephant's feet. The grateful Nawab appoints him as his general. When Dawood expresses his determination to subjugate Senji, the Nawab expresses his helplessness, stating that nothing could be done as long as Desingu has the written proclamation of Senji's independence in his custody. It is around the same time that Desingu dismisses his general Yusuf Khan from service when he is caught trying to commit adultery molesting Sengkamalam. Abetted by the humiliated Yusuf Khan who has now turned traitor, Dawood makes use of his striking resemblance to Desingu and extracts the written parchment from the unsuspecting wife of Desingu.\nWhen Mohammed Khan falls in love with the pretty Ayisha, he anticipates no opposition from his parents for the match. However, he finds that his mother and father have each identified a girl of their own choice to be his wife. When he informs them that he has already chosen his life partner, his father proposes that they go the queen for an appropriate decision. Ranibai asks each of them to write down the name of the girl they have in mind, and then discovers that all 3 of them have written Ayisha's name.\nWhen the royal astrologer suggests that Desingu and Ranibai be separated for 3 years as an antidote for the inauspicious placement of their stars, Desingu pours scorn upon such beliefs. However, considering the welfare of Senji and heeding to his mother's plea, Desingu is forced to consent to such separation. He carries on stolidly with his responsibilities as the ruler of Senji during the day.\nThe Nawab of Arcot and Dawood Khan send a man to meet Desingu to request Senji kingdom to pay tax. Desingu announces in agony that Senji would not bow to the Sultanate of Delhi. Now that Senji had no proof of its independence, Arcot declares war on Senji for non-payment of taxes. Under the resolute leadership of Mohammed Khan, Senji emerges triumphant in warding off the Arcot forces. But even as Mohammed Khan fetches water to quench the thirst of a dying soldier of Arcot, Yusuf Khan shoots him from the back. And not satisfied with dastardly act, Yusuf Khan kills Mohammed Khan's fianc\u00e9e Ayisha, who had come to the battlefield in search of her beloved. Wanting the brothers to fight against each other now, Yusuf Khan carries false reports to Desingu that it was Dawood who killed Mohammed Khan. Thirsting for revenge for the death of his friend, Desingu rushes to the war front and soon challenges Dawood to a duel. Dawood is hesitant to fight with his brother, and even advises Desingu that they could leave the fighting to their troops. But Desingu is no mood to listen and soon the brothers are engaged in a bitter duel. Handicapped by his oath not to harm Desingu, Dawood is soon vanquished and lies mortally wounded.

She is the \"hand to which the five fingers belong,\" and she has a powerful influence on her sons. Presented in five distinct sections, the film weaves the story of the five brothers Vincenzo, Simone, Rocco, Ciro and Luca Parondi as each of them adapts to his new life in the city.\nVincenzo, the eldest brother, is already living in Milan when his mother and brothers come to join him expecting to move in with him. An initial scene ensues between the Parondi family and Vincenzo's fianc\u00e9e Ginetta's family, and the whole Parondi family moves in together. Despite early friction between Rosaria and Ginetta, he soon gets married and starts a family of his own. After settling down, Vincenzo doesn't interact much with the Parondi brothers.\nSimone, the second brother, struggles to adapt to urban life. He becomes attracted to a prostitute named Nadia, who urges him to pursue a career in boxing, which his mother also encourages, as a fast way to reach fame and wealth. Nadia, after initially pursuing Vincenzo only to find him happy in his new family life, turns her interest to Simone. Simone falls in love with Nadia and demands far more than a casual relationship, but she rejects him.\nRocco, the third brother, leaves to complete military service in Turin and meets Nadia, who has just been released from prison for prostitution. His innocence and purity of heart ignites her to give up her way of life and enter an exclusive relationship with him. When Simone learns of this, he attacks Nadia and Rocco with a gang of friends and rapes Nadia to \"teach Rocco a lesson\". Rocco subsequently sacrifices his relationship with Nadia, telling her that he did not realize how much their relationship hurt his brother. Rocco insists that Nadia return to Simone, and she reluctantly complies.\nCiro, the second-youngest brother, perhaps by observing the trials of Simone and Rocco, decides to learn from their mistakes and mimic his brother Vincenzo. Unlike Vincenzo, Ciro still lives with his mother and participates in family matters. To that end, Ciro finds steady work in Milan at an automobile factory and becomes engaged to a local woman from a good family.\nRocco often acts to preserve the well-being of family members at some cost to his own happiness. He continues a boxing career without enjoying it to provide for his family and he covers for Simone in a myriad of ways, such as returning an expensive brooch that Simone stole from Rocco's boss. After Simone loses the ability to compete as a boxer, because of his obsession with Nadia, his alcoholism, and dissolute lifestyle, Rocco agrees to sign a long term boxing contract in order to pay back money that Simone squandered and cannot repay.  While Rocco fights and wins a championship bout, Simone kills Nadia in a jealous rage when she returns to prostitution and refuses to return to him.\nAs the family celebrates Rocco's victory, he shares an anecdote about masons, who, at the start of erecting a building, sacrifice a brick by throwing it into the shadow of the first passerby to ensure the structure will be sound and endure. Rocco's own habit of sacrificing his money and well-being can be likewise analogized, as attempts to preserve his family after their upheaval from country life. Simone arrives at the apartment and confesses to Nadia's murder. Despite his anguish, Rocco tries to protect Simone, but Ciro refuses to go along and leaves to turn Simone in to the police.\nThe youngest brother, Luca, does little but watch quietly in the background most of the time. By the end of the film he wants to return with Rocco to the south, despite spending the least time in southern Italy before the family moved to Milan. In one of the last scenes Ciro speaks to Luca outside his factory and tells him that Rocco won't return there, though he might, but will not find the south the same under the pressure of inevitable progress, and, though many people fear a changing world, he does not and believes that Luca will benefit from the changes.", "tmdb_plot": "When a impoverished widow\u2019s family moves to the big city, two of her five sons become romantic rivals with deadly results.", "tmdb_id": "8422", "wiki_id": "3949045"}, {"title": "Romeo, Juliet and Darkness", "genres": ["Drama", "War"], "wiki_plot": "In Nazi-occupied Prague in May 1942, Pavel (Ivan Mistr\u00edk) hides the young Jew Hanka (Daniela Smutn\u00e1) to keep her from being sent to a concentration camp.

Later that evening, Palfrey took April out for dinner, but after finding his reservation was voided for being late, the pair managed to gain entry after encountering a causal acquaintance of Palfrey, Raymond Delauney, who swiftly proceeded to seduce April and cast his friend in a bad light.

Eager to acquire it, the pair offer to trade for it, to which Palfrey cons them into handing over an Austin-Healey sports car and 100 guineas (\u00a3105) for the car, which promptly breaks down after he leaves. Returning to his family firm, Palfrey next puts Gloatbridge in his place by pretending he will arrange a merger with a larger firm and that his clerk's bookkeeping has gotten sloppy, allowing him to also earn the respect of his employees in the process.\nFinally, Palfrey challenges Delauney to a rematch, and uses various ploys to frustrate him before they even start playing, including making him damage his own car.

Wilkins has recruited a team of thieves \u2013 including Melanie, an exotic dancer \u2013 but he needs someone he can trust, Mason, to keep them all in line during the crime.\nThe heist takes place on the night of a grand celebration at the casino. Melanie's protector, the saxophone player Pancho, and Wilkins enter the casino in the guises of (respectively) \"Baron von Roelitz,\" an aristocrat with a disability who uses a wheelchair, and his physician, \"Dr. Vidal.\" At the same time, Melanie, the safecracker Louis and Mason attend the party with invitations procured by the gang's inside man at the casino, the meek assistant to the director, Le May, who is under Melanie's spell.\nMason and Louis go out of a window, which Melanie shuts behind them, and make their way along a narrow ledge high above the sea to the casino director's office. From there, they descend by elevator to the vault four floors below. They cut through a barred gate in front of the vault and drill through the lock, secure the cash and make their way back to the director's elevator.\nPancho's part of the plan is to ingest a cyanide capsule to simulate a heart attack.

The spool is seized on as evidence that the explosion, originally blamed on a meteor, was actually caused by an alien spaceship.\nProfessor Harringway deduces the craft must have come from Venus. The spool itself is determined to be a flight recorder and is partially decoded by an international team of scientists led by Professor Sikarna and Dr. Tschen Y\u00fc. When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Kosmoskrator, intended to voyage to Mars, is now redirected to Venus, a 30-to-31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works diligently to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer.\nWhen their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to their invasion. Rather than containing a \"cosmic document\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. With this new information the crew decides to transmit this information to Earth, believing that the information would be of service to mankind.

The crew splits up, some staying near Kosmoskrator to study the storage devices. The others follow the power line to try and find the Venusians, but they find no life forms. Instead, they discover a large golf ball-like structure that Arsenjew suggests may be a giant transformer or a force-field generator.

Two years later, after war has begun, British naval intelligence discovers Bismarck and the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen are about to sail into the North Atlantic to attack Allied convoys. From a London underground war room, Captain Jonathan Shepard (Kenneth More) coordinates the hunt for the dreaded Bismarck. Later, the two German warships encounter HMS Hood and HMS Prince of Wales in the Straits of Denmark, and the four warships engage in a deadly gun duel. The battle results in the annihilation and violent disintegration of the Hood, shocking combatants on both sides. Now Prince of Wales is alone and is fired on by the two German ships. However, it manages to inflict damage on the Bismarck's bow.  Bismarck returns fire, destroying the Prince of Wales' bridge. Eventually, Prince of Wales emits a smoke screen behind which to retreat. Bismarck and Prinz Eugen also retreat, but they are shadowed by the cruisers HMS Suffolk and HMS Norfolk using radar. Later, Prinz Eugen breaks away and heads toward the port of Brest, in occupied France, while Bismarck turns and fires at the British cruisers to provide cover as it escapes. The attack forces the cruisers to retreat. An air assault from the carrier HMS Victorious damages Bismarck's fuel tanks, but the vessel is otherwise largely undamaged.\nBack at London's operations headquarters, Captain Shepard gambles that Admiral Gunther L\u00fctjens, in command of Bismarck, is returning to friendly waters where U-boats and air cover will make it impossible to attack, so he plans to intercept and attack the German vessel before it reaches safety. Shepard commits a disproportionately large force to the search, and his wager proves correct when Bismarck is located steaming toward the French coast. British forces have a narrow time window in which to destroy or slow their prey before German support and their own diminishing fuel supplies can preclude further attacks. Swordfish torpedo planes from HMS Ark Royal have two chances. The first fails when the pilots misidentify HMS Sheffield as Bismarck, but thankfully their new magnetic torpedo detonators are faulty, with most exploding as soon as they hit the sea. Returning to the carrier and changing to conventional contact exploders, their second attack, this time on the \"real\" Bismarck, is successful. One torpedo causes only minor damage; but a catastrophic second hit detonates near the stern, jamming the German battleship's rudder, drastically slowing her down.\nUnable to repair its rudder, Bismarck steams in circles. During the night the German battleship is attacked by two British destroyers. They fire torpedoes, and one hits; but Bismarck returns fire, sinking the destroyer HMS Solent. The main force of British ships (including battleships HMS Rodney and HMS King George V) find Bismarck the next day and rain shells upon her. L\u00fctjens in his final moments insists that German forces will arrive to save them, but he dies when a shell destroys Bismarck's bridge. Shortly afterwards, the remaining bridge officers are killed, and the crew abandon their sinking ship. On board King George V, Admiral John Tovey orders the newly joined cruiser HMS Dorsetshire to finish off Bismarck. The cruiser fires six torpedoes at the severely damaged German battleship. Four torpedoes strike home, causing the vessel to sink faster than its crew can escape.

The crew abandons ship leaving the family on board, while the ship grounds on rocks off an uninhabited island. The family makes their way ashore along with the captain's two Great Danes. Father, eldest son Fritz, and middle son Ernst salvage supplies and livestock from the shipwreck. The pirates locate the ship, but Father scares them off by putting up a quarantine flag, signaling disease aboard.\nThe family soon discovers that the island contains a diversity of wildlife, including a dangerous tiger. To provide safety and comfort, Father, Fritz, and Ernst construct an elaborate tree house complete with a water wheel. Youngest son Francis collects various animals including a young Asian elephant, a monkey, and an ostrich. Ernst theorizes that the island may once have been part of a land bridge between Africa and Asia. As the family settles in, Father opines that, by going back to nature, they have found everything they need in life. Mother, however, worries that her sons will never marry or have families if they are not rescued, and consents to allow Fritz and Ernst to circumnavigate the island in a homemade outrigger boat and search for other settlements.\nDuring their expedition, the brothers come across the pirates, who have captured another ship and taken its captain and cabin boy captive. They rescue the cabin boy, but the pirates spot them before they can free the captain, who insists they leave him since the pirates intend to ransom him. The brothers and the boy flee the pirates through the jungle, the brothers later learning that the \"boy\" is really a girl named Roberta. The captain (her grandfather) cut her hair and dressed her as a boy to disguise her gender from the pirates. They survive an attack by a Python, but become lost and fight over what to do.

They rescue a zebra from hyenas and a quicksand trap; using it as a mount, they arrive back at the tree house just in time for Christmas.\nAnticipating that the pirates will come looking for Roberta, the family scuttles their wrecked ship to hide their location. They fortify a rocky clifftop, building defenses and booby traps. Fritz and Ernst become rivals for Roberta's affections. Believing that her grandfather will return for her once ransomed, she intends to return to London; Ernst is interested in going to school there, while Fritz would rather go on to New Guinea to build a home of his own. Despite this, a romance develops between Fritz and Roberta, and the brothers come to blows over her. To relieve tension, Father declares a holiday to be held. That night, Francis manages to catch the tiger in one of the pits that they have dug.\nThe holiday begins with a race, the boys and Roberta riding on various animals. The pirates, sailing nearby, hear the sound of the starting pistol and come ashore. The family retreats to their fort, and the attackers fall victim to their traps and defenses. The pirate captain demands that they hand over Roberta, while his men sneak up the cliff side and attack from the rear. As the family is about to be overwhelmed, a ship captained by Roberta's grandfather appears, destroying the pirates and their ship with cannon fire.\nThe captain offers to help Ernst get into a London university, and to take the rest of the family back to Europe or on to New Guinea. Father and Mother, however, decide that they would rather stay on the island and keep Francis with them for a few more years. The captain speculates that the island will become a new colony, and that Father will be nominated to be its governor.

He is absent, then suddenly appears, bedraggled and exhausted. He recounts what happened to him.\nAt the group's earlier dinner on New Year's Eve, George stated that time is the 4th Dimension. He shows David Filby, Dr. Philip Hillyer, Anthony Bridewell, and Walter Kemp a scale model time machine. When a tiny lever on it is pressed, the device quickly disappears. George says it went forward in time, but his friends are skeptical. The group leaves George's house, Filby reluctantly, as he senses George is not himself. Thereafter, George retires to his private laboratory that holds a full-size time machine.\nGeorge travels forward in time, first in small increments, and then to 1917. He meets Filby's son, James, who says Filby died in a war. George returns to the time machine and stops in 1940 during the Blitz, finding himself in the midst of \"a new war\". A disillusioned George then travels to 1966. People are rushing to fallout shelters as air raid sirens are blaring. An elderly James Filby urges George to take cover. George barely makes it back to his time machine as an \"atomic satellite\" detonates, causing a local volcanic eruption. The approaching lava rises, cools, and hardens, trapping George as he travels far into the future. Eventually the lava wears away, revealing a lush, unspoiled landscape.\nGeorge stops at October 12, 802,701, near the base of a sphinx. He encounters young men and women wearing simple clothing gathered at a stream. One woman, carried off by the current, screams for help. When her indifferent companions do nothing, George rescues her. The girl is Weena and her people are the Eloi; they do not operate machines, work, or read, and know little of their history. Their food is always provided for them. One young male shows George a library, but the books crumble to dust when touched. Outraged, he decides to leave, but his machine has been dragged into the closed sphinx. Weena, who stays with him, says that Morlocks are responsible, noting they only come out at night. A hideous-looking Morlock jumps out and tries to drag Weena away, but is warded off by George's fire torch.\nThe next day, Weena shows George domed structures dotting the landscape, air shafts that lead down to the Morlocks' caverns. Weena also shows George an ancient museum where \"talking rings\" tell of long-ago war between east and west that lasted 326 years and contaminated the atmosphere. Another ring describes humanity's struggle for survival; many lived underground, while some eventually returned to the surface. George realizes this was the beginning of the speciation that resulted in the Morlocks and Eloi. He starts to climb down a shaft, but stops when sirens emerge and blare from the sphinx. The Eloi go into a trance-like state and head for the opened doors at the sphinx's base. The sirens stop and the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside, while those outside merely walk away.\nGeorge enters the caverns through the air shafts. He discovers that the Morlocks raise the Eloi as food. He finds Weena and fights off the creatures, finally inspiring the Eloi to defend themselves. George sets fires and urges the Eloi to climb to the surface. He directs them to drop tree branches down the shafts. The resulting fires cause the caverns to burn, then collapse.\nThe next morning, the sphinx's doors are open. George's time machine is inside. Upon his entering, the doors close, and George is attacked by Morlocks. He escapes in his machine and returns to 1900.\nAfter George recounts his story, his friends remain skeptical.

Although Sinclair led the battalion through the remainder of the war, winning a DSO as he took it \"from Dover to Berlin\" (He also holds an MM a medal only awarded to Other Ranks), Brigade HQ considers Barrow\u2014whose ancestor founded the battalion\u2014a more appropriate peacetime commanding officer.\nColonel Barrow arrives a day early and finds the officers dancing rowdily.

Sinclair enlisted as bandsman in Glasgow and rose through the ranks, Barrow came from Oxford University. He served with the battalion in 1933. Assigned to \"special duties\", he  has lectured at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

Men who have been dancing for decades are insulted and angry at being told not to raise their arms overhead, for example. The townspeople enjoy the party, but when the dancing becomes rowdy, Barrow is infuriated. Red-faced and screaming, he ends the party. He flees in a jeep, accompanied by Capt. Cairns, in whom he confides. The thought of leading this battalion kept him alive while the Japanese drowned him repeatedly. When a sympathetic Cairns says that he triumphed and survived, Barrow replies that he did not \u201csurvive.\u201d\nSinclair finds Corporal Fraser with Morag in a pub and punches him. \"Bashing a corporal\" is a severe offence, and Barrow decides to begin an inquiry, meaning a court-martial.

In the billiard room, Major Charlie Scott \u2013 with glacial cruelty \u2013 says that Sinclair is really in charge and suggests that Barrow join the other acolytes.

Gilbert is dead from multiple gunshots, while Dominique is unconscious and near death from gas inhalation.  Dominique is revived, arrested, and put on trial for the murder of Gilbert.  Her life story and the circumstances leading up to the crime are recounted in detail, leading to a series of flashbacks intercut with the trial.\nDominique is the elder of two sisters, who live in a small provincial town with their parents.  The younger sister, Annie, is a studious aspiring violinist, while Dominique avoids work and leads a directionless, leisurely lifestyle.  When Annie moves to Paris for music school, Dominique wants to join her, overdosing on pills when their parents refuse.  After this, Dominique gets her way and the sisters move in together.  Dominique falls in with a group of rebellious young intellectuals, earning herself a reputation for promiscuity.  Gilbert, an ambitious young conductor, befriends Annie and visits the apartment, finding a nude Dominique who flirts with him.  After this, Annie kicks Dominique out of the apartment.\nGilbert becomes infatuated with Dominique, though they are polar opposites in terms of values and personality.  Eventually they begin a turbulent relationship, during which Dominique takes an uncharacteristically long amount of time to consent to Gilbert's sexual advances, impulsively sleeping around with other men in the meantime.  Gilbert is jealous and frustrated, but remains committed to Dominique.  After they finally consummate their relationship, he proposes to her but she refuses.  They move in together, but their differing lifestyles lead to further contention, and Dominique cheats on him, after which he beats her.  The landlady evicts Dominique from Gilbert's flat, leading her to take a job at a restaurant to pay her own rent.  Gilbert becomes suspicious that Dominique is involved with the restaurant owner, Toussaint.  This leads to an emotional breakup, as Dominique insists nothing is going on with Toussaint while Gilbert refuses to believe her.\nDominique sleeps with Toussaint after the breakup, then quits her job and becomes homeless, turning to prostitution.  While visiting her hometown for her father's funeral, she learns that Annie is now engaged to Gilbert.  Dominique visits Gilbert, begging him to take her back.  He accepts her advances and sleeps with her once more, then coldly turns her away the next morning.  Dominique promptly steps in front of a bus, though she survives with minimal injury and denies that it was a suicide attempt.  Later that day, Gilbert hastily finalizes his marriage vows to Annie.  Dominique purchases a gun and sneaks back to Gilbert's apartment, initially claiming she intends to kill herself in front of him.  As Gilbert berates and insults her, she turns the gun on him instead, emptying it into him and leaving her without a bullet to commit suicide.  After the shooting, she breaks down sobbing then seemingly laughing.  Her suicide attempt with the gas line is not shown until its aftermath.\nOver the course of the trial, Dominique's defense attorney Guerin characterizes the killing as an impulsive crime of passion borne out of genuine love for Gilbert, while the prosecutor, Eparvier, attacks and condemns Dominique as manipulative and selfish, engineering the entire relationship and the eventual murder out of resentment towards Annie; Eparvier also calls into question the seriousness of Dominique's various suicide attempts.  Dominique grows increasingly emotional over the course of the trial.  Guerin adapts his defense strategy to portray Gilbert as the manipulator and Dominique as the victim; this finally drives Dominique to an outburst, insisting to the courtroom that she and Gilbert genuinely loved each other.  That night, she attempts suicide again, slitting her wrist.  This time she is successful, and the judge announces her death to the court the following day, dismissing the case.  Despite their impassioned arguments during the trial, Eparvier and Guerin quickly resume their friendly rapport the moment the trial is over.

The military establishes a cordon around Midwich and sends in a man wearing a gas mask, but he, too, falls unconscious and is pulled back with rope. The man awakens and reports experiencing a cold sensation just before passing out. The pilot of a military reconnaissance plane is contacted and asked to investigate. When he flies below 5,000 feet, he loses consciousness and the plane crashes. A five-mile exclusion zone around the village is established for all aircraft. After approximately four hours, the villagers regain consciousness, and all are apparently unaffected.\nTwo months later, all women and girls of child-bearing age in the affected area are discovered to be pregnant, sparking many accusations of both infidelity and extramarital sex. The accusations fade as the extraordinary nature of the pregnancies is discovered, with seven-month fetuses appearing after only five months. All the women give birth on the same day. Their children have an unusual appearance, including \"arresting\" eyes, odd scalp hair construction and colour (platinum blonde), and unusually narrow fingernails. As the children grow and develop at a rapid rate, it becomes clear they also have a powerful telepathic bond with one another. They can communicate with each other over great distances, and as one learns something, so do the others.\nThree years later, Professor Gordon Zellaby (Sanders), whose wife Anthea (Shelley) gave birth to one of the children, attends a meeting with British Intelligence to discuss the children. There he learns Midwich was not the only place affected; follow-up investigations have revealed similar phenomena in other areas of the world.\nAt age three, the children are precocious, physically and mentally the equivalent of children four times their age. Their behaviour has become even more unusual and striking. They dress impeccably, always walk as a group, speak in an adult manner, and behave maturely, but they show no conscience or love, and demonstrate a coldness to others, causing the villagers to fear and be repulsed by them.\nThe children begin to exhibit the power to read minds and to force people to do things against their will. There have been a number of villagers' deaths since the children were born, many of which are considered unusual, and some citizens believe the children are responsible. This is confirmed when the children are seen killing a man by making him crash his car into a wall, and again when they force his suspicious brother to shoot himself.\nZellaby, whose \"son\" David is one of the children, is at first eager to work with them, trying to teach them while hoping to learn more about them. The children are placed in a separate building where they will learn and live. While the children continue to exert their will, Zellaby is informed that the Soviet government has fired a nuclear shell and destroyed the Russian village that was the only other location on Earth where mutant children still lived.\nZellaby compares the children's resistance to reasoning with a brick wall and uses this motif as self-protection against their mind reading after the children's inhuman nature becomes clear to him. He takes a hidden time-bomb to a session with the children and tries to block their awareness of the bomb by visualizing a brick wall.

He travels until the outboard motor runs out of gas, at which point he paddles to an island off the Carolina coast that is a private game preserve. It is not hunting season, so the island's only inhabitants are the caretakers Miller and Pee-Wee and Pee-Wee's teenage granddaughter Evalyn.\nPee-Wee dies the same morning Traver comes to the island. Miller says he did not approve of how the elderly drunkard was raising Evvie, and he intends to put her in the care of the church and send her to the mainland so she can attend school. After he has her clean herself up and brush her wild hair, however, he notices she is growing up and comes on to her. Evvie escapes Miller's cabin and locks herself in hers with Pee-Wee's corpse.\nThe next day, Jackson arrives on the island with supplies. He and Miller bury Pee-Wee, and Miller leaves with Jackson to alert the authorities to the death. Miller had told Evvie that she could go to town with Jackson, but now says he changed his mind.\nThinking herself alone on the island, Evvie goes to work at the apiary until Traver appears and begs her for something to eat. She is initially frightened, but the dime he pays her for some honey and an apple puts her at ease, and she takes him back to Miller's cabin for a real meal. Evvie tries to stop Traver from taking some food and gas and a shotgun with him when he goes, though she relents when he gives her twenty dollars. Traver accidentally shoots a hole in his boat and gets supplies to repair it from Evvie.\nMiller returns in the morning, and Evvie, who does not think Traver is still on the island, tells him about Traver's visit. She does not mention the twenty dollars, so Miller takes a rifle and goes to look for the thief. Traver had fallen asleep before finishing his repairs, but he is just about to leave when he hears Miller approaching. He gets away on foot, and Miller shoots four holes in the boat and begins to track Traver through the woods. Sighting Traver crossing a swamp in a boat he has found, Miller fires a shot. Although Traver splashes into the water, he emerges unscathed out of Miller's view.\nThat night, Miller presents Evvie with a new dress and some high heel shoes. He tries to kiss her, but she pulls away, and he sees the twenty-dollar bill pinned to the inside of Evvie's old dress. Miller angrily demands to know what Evvie gave Traver in exchange for so much money, not believing the truth. After Evvie goes to bed, Traver bursts in with the shotgun to get his motor, which Miller had taken, and Miller's rifle. He explains he is not a thief because he paid for the supplies he took, inadvertently corroborating Evvie's story.\nIn the morning, Miller gives Evvie the money back. She goes to see Traver, who is fixing his boat, but their conversation is interrupted when Miller shows up. The tension is defused somewhat when the men discover they were both in the army and took part in the liberation of Italy during WWII.\nLater, Traver comes to the cabins to keep an eye on Miller while his boat soaks overnight. Evvie gets Traver to play his clarinet, and she dances until Miller gets a hand grenade and throws it. He says he has two more, so Traver does not have the upper hand, even with the guns, and should just give them back, which Traver does that evening. Miller moves Evvie into his cabin so Traver can stay in hers, and, while Traver plays the clarinet, Miller rapes Evvie.\nThere is a rainstorm the following day, and, to interrupt a fraught racial conversation, Evvie asks Traver to play some music. When he goes to get his clarinet, Jackson arrives unexpectedly with Reverend Fleetwood, who has come to perform a funeral service and take Evvie to a children's home. Jackson mentions that a black musician raped a white woman, and Miller realizes why Traver is on the island. Traver snuck away when the visitors came, so Miller and Jackson do not find him in Evvie's cabin, and they decide to wait until morning to continue their search, as it is still raining and Jackson has the keys to his boat and Miller has Traver's motor and oars.\nWhile Miller and Jackson hunt Traver, the Reverend, who has suspicions about Miller's treatment of Evvie, baptizes Evvie, though she fails to see the value of the ritual. Evvie and the Reverend find Traver stuck in one of Miller's animal traps and bring him to the cabins to address his wounded leg. Traver declares his innocence and the Reverend believes him after he says who made the claim against him, as the woman is a drunk and falsely accused a white man of raping her two years ago. Miller and Jackson return and tie Traver up, planning to take him to the mainland the next day. The Reverend says he will testify on Traver's behalf, but Traver says he does not expect to live long enough to see his trial.\nAfter dark, Traver convinces Evvie to set him free. The Reverend confronts Miller about Evvie and Miller confirms the rape, though he defends his actions and asks the Reverend not to report him. After Jackson, who is an even bigger racist than Miller, leaves to find and kill Traver in the morning, the Reverend appeals to Miller, ending by pointing out what a hypocrite he is being. Miller asks if the Reverend would still turn him in if he married Evvie, and the Reverend says he would have to ask his superiors.\nMiller finds Jackson, takes his gun, and tells him to get off the island.

An elegant man picks her up and takes her to the flea market, where he buys her a pair of jeans and treats her to a dish of mussels.

When the German girls descend on Gabriel and drag him onto their tour bus as their mascot, she finds a policeman to report this kidnapping.

At the club, Gabriel orders champagne for his friends and waits anxiously for his costume. Albertine has however fallen asleep, to be woken by the fake cop from the morning who starts another of his bizarre interrogations. When he moves from words to attempted rape, she jumps out of the window. After his drag act, for which Albertine brought him a dress just in time, he takes everybody off to a bar. What starts with a couple slapping each other turns into a massive saloon brawl, which wrecks the place and brings on an army of cops. The group are rescued by Albertine who shows them a way into the M\u00e9tro tunnels, through which they can walk in safety as the system is still on strike.\nIn the morning, Albertine carries the sleeping child to the railway station, where her mother Jeanne regrets that she will have to find a better-performing lover.
