The implicated message is clear: in the same manner as Austria was, in Austria's eyes, falsely indicted for breaking the world peace (1914 and 1939), they are now being indicted again in 2000.\nThe world court hovers in with its space rocket into Vienna and lands in front of Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace. The Austrians now have to prove that they are a lovely nation, and that they would never break the world peace. Subsequently, everything which is supposed to make Austria lovely is presented, starting with Mozart, going over Prince Eugene of Savoy, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria, Viennese wine, the Viennese waltz, the mountains, the classic bands, etc. Despite the presented evidence, Austria will be found guilty. Just before the conviction is made, the Moscow Declaration of 1943 is discovered. The declaration clearly states that Austria is to be freed, which happens at the end of the film.

When he sees how little he has actually stolen from the old prospector, Sam says, \"Pickings mighty slim around here, hardly no reward for a day's work.\" Sam takes the gold to Pierre, who runs the \"Next to Last Chance Saloon\", to trade it for money. After the weigh-up, Sam is furious to find out that Pierre can offer him only $10 for the gold.\nWhile Sam complains about this (\"It's getting so a man can't earn a dishonest living!\"), Bugs Bunny wobbles into the shop carrying a gigantic piece of gold.

Bugs plays along by asking if the deal is \"honest and for true\", to which the claim-jumper replies, \"Square-Deal Sam, they call me\". They stroll off together and soon Bugs, in his unusual way, indicates that he has found gold. He points out the spot to Sam, who proceeds to dig and abruptly reveals that he dissolves his partnership with Bugs.

As the thief digs even deeper, it turns out he is in a loaded dump truck. Bugs drives the dump truck to a cliff and empties the load over the edge.

Caught in the act, Sam is arrested and hauled off to the stockade by a couple of Military Policemen while Bugs bids him farewell.

Devastated though influenced by Alraune, Olga attempts suicide by poisoning herself.\nAlraune then begins using her sexual appeal to flirt with men that have fallen for her. She goes horseback riding with Gerald during a rainstorm, carriage riding with Mathieu, ten Brinken's coachman, and poses herself for Ralph to paint her. When one of Alraune's necklace winds up missing, she accuses her teacher, Mademoiselle Duvaliere (Denise Vernac), which in fact was found inside her luggage, who is then fired for theft. She later discovers that in fact it was Doctor Mohn (Harry Halm) who stole the necklace from Alraune's jewelry box and framed Duvaliere, all to gain attention from Alraune.\nMonths later, Frank returns from Paris having completed his studies.

With no man seemingly able to make her happy, Alraune questions her own morality and emotions for Frank. She pleads Frank for his help, even going as far to cry real tears. Frank, taken back by this, realizes that everything he was told about this \"unnatural being\" is false, she can evoke emotions and not as \"soulless\" as originally described, he takes her back and they plan to go run away together. Alraune tells ten Brinken about their plans, but he refuses to let her go, his reasoning in that she will destroy him and herself, just as she did with the other men. He gives her the diary detailing who she is and her parent's and upon reading it, decides not to go away with Frank.\nDays later, the sulfur spring has died out and Dr.Mohn is threatening to expose ten Brinken for his illegal experiments. He plans to run away to Germany with the left over money from the land with Alraune. Duvaliere worries that she will be too be exposed for her involvement with the experiments. She talks with Frank about the ordeal and is surprised to learn of his true feelings for Alraune. They both travel to ten Brinken's estate. Upon arriving, Duvaliere accuses ten Brinken of being \"mad\" and is incredibly jealous of Alraune's affection for Frank. Frank pursues Alraune through the forest where she hallucinates in seeing her dead \"lovers\" and overwhelmed by this, she faints. Upon awakening, Frank confesses his love once more for Alraune and reasons with her as not being the factor in his friends deaths. She disagrees, convinced that she is nothing but \"the bringer of destruction\" as she is the direct result of a cruel trial of her ungodly father, heightened by the evil thoughts of her parents. He convinces her that both good and evil are always present in each individual, regardless of circumstances, and that the good can in her can win over the evil.\nFrank carries Alraune back to the estate, where as they arrive, ten Brinken is convinced that she will leave him for Frank. He then pulls out his gun and shoots her -\"Now the toy is broken-the crime against nature that God didn\u2019t want.\u201d Alraune dies, dissolving into a mandrake root body with the seed of her true nature finally destroyed.

Baiju Bawra is the story of an unknown singer, Baiju, who is on a mission to defeat Tansen in a musical duel to avenge the death of his father.\nWhen Baiju is still a child, Tansen's sentry tries to stop Baiju's father from singing, and in the ensuing scuffle, his father dies. Before dying, he extracts a promise from his son to take revenge against Tansen. Baiju gets shelter from a village priest and while growing up, falls in love with Gauri, the daughter of a boatman. He continues his musical education on his own, but gets so enamoured by Gauri's love that he forgets the promise made to his father.\nLater, a group of dacoits raid Baiju's village. With his song, Baiju persuades them against looting the village, but the female leader of the dacoits falls in love with him and asks him to follow them to their fort as a condition for their sparing the village. Baiju leaves with her, leaving the wailing Gauri behind. In the fort, the dacoit leader, who is actually a princess living in exile, tells Baiju how her father's serfdom had been usurped and she was seeking revenge because the village too previously belonged to her father. The word \"revenge\" brings all of Baiju's memories back; he leaves the fort greatly agitated, and the princess does not try to stop him.\nBaiju sneaks into the Mughal palace, where Tansen is singing. He is dumbstruck by the way Tansen sings, and the sword that was supposed to cut the maestro's throat fell on the tanpura, saddening Tansen. He said he could only be killed by music, and the pain that accompanies it. \"Dip your notes in melancholy and I'll die on my own,\" he said. Baiju accordingly leaves the palace to learn \"real\" music.\nBaiju remembers that when his father was killed, he was taking Baiju to Swami Haridas. He goes to see the Swami himself and asks for his guidance, informing him of his plan to take revenge against Tansen. Haridas tells Baiju that one must be in love to be a true musician, and thus Baiju must rid himself of all the hatred in his heart, but still gives him a veena and accepts him as his disciple. Baiju again starts his musical training, spending all his time in a Shiva temple, but his vengeful feelings never leave him. Nonetheless, he still reveres his guru, Haridas. After learning that his teacher had fallen seriously ill and was unable to walk, Baiju sings a song that so thrills Haridas that the master gets out of his bed and starts to walk.\nGauri, meanwhile, is so distraught over Baiju's departure that she is about to swallow poison. At that point, the princess who had taken Baiju from the village comes to her and tells her that she knows of Baiju's whereabouts. Gauri meets Baiju and tries to convince him to return to the village so they can be married; Baiju, however, refuses, as he feels he must take revenge against Tansen. At this point, Haridas arrives, and Baiju goes to receive him, once again leaving a crying Gauri behind. Haridas tells Baiju that to be a true singer, he has to feel real pain. Hearing this, Gauri decides to make a venomous snake bite her, thinking that her death would bring enough grief to Baiju that he would defeat Tansen. Baiju sees Gauri's lifeless body and goes mad, with the princess' attempts to get through to him being futile. Baiju instead goes to the Shiva temple and sings a heart-wrenching song condemning the God who had consigned him to his fate; even the idol of Lord Shiva sheds tears at Baiju's grief.\nIn his delirious state, Baiju reaches Tansen's city, singing the whole way. The residents fear for his life and call him bawra (insane), hence the title of the movie. Baiju is caught and imprisoned, but the princess frees him. However, both of them are caught by Mughal soldiers when escaping, leaving a musical duel with Tansen as the only way to save his life.\nEmperor Akbar himself witnesses the competition. For a long time, both the singers prove to be equally good. Then Akbar suggests that whoever could melt a marble slab with his singing would win the duel. Baiju manages to do so and wins the competition, saving his own life and finally avenging his father's death. Tansen accepts his defeat graciously, and is in fact happy that there is someone better than him. Baiju persuades Akbar to spare Tansen's life, to return the princess' land to her, and to allow music in the streets.\nAfter winning the musical duel, Baiju departs from the court. Emperor Akbar is unhappy to see him go and asks Tansen to sing to produce a storm and floods to make him stay. Tansen sings raga Megh and the river Yamuna floods. (This scene was cut from the final film.)\nMeanwhile, Gauri is alive but her father is deeply upset. The entire village makes fun of Gauri's and Baiju's love affair. Her father warns her that either Baiju should be found, or Gauri should marry a village moneylender, and in case she refuses, he would commit suicide. Gauri, unwilling to divulge Baiju's whereabouts, agrees to marry the money-lender.\nDiscovering that she is still alive, Baiju goes to meet Gauri. On the other side of a swollen Yamuna River, Baiju is stuck. The boatmen refuse to take him to the other side. Despite not knowing how to swim, Baiju pushes the boat into the raging waters and starts rowing it. He starts singing and Gauri hears it. She starts running towards the bank. When she sees Baiju struggling with the boat, she jumps into the water to rescue Baiju. The boat topples over and after a lot of struggle Gauri manages to reach him. He urges her to go back and leave him, but Gauri replies that they had promised to be together in life and in death, and she would be content in dying with him.

Later, Daffy takes the stuffed duck and waddles it into Rover's sight, who attacks it thinking it is Daffy. Porky again tells his dog off and drags Rover off to lock him away, warning him \"You try that again and I'll put your tail in the pencil sharpener\". After successfully getting the dog out of his way, Daffy tries to sneak away to continue his comfortable time, but Porky mistakes him for the stuffed duck and takes him away to \"stuff it all over again\".\nAs a stuffed Daffy stands over the fireplace, a flock of black ducks similar to him pass by and see him, repeating his earlier quotation. Porky, still working out his tax forms, says to himself that \"This darn income tax would come out alright if I had a few dependents\". Daffy asks \"Did you say dependents?\" and opens a door, adding \"You've got 'em, brother!\". To Porky's shock, the flock of ducks from earlier have invaded his home and are having a party as the cartoon ends."}, "2560949": {"title": "The Crimson Pirate", "plot": "Late in the 18th century, Caribbean pirate Captain Vallo  and his crew capture a frigate of the King's navy.

At the hospital, Irene learns that Michel might have hurt himself by purpose to receive attention. Irene promises Michel that from now on she will always stay with him. When Michel dies shortly after from a blood clot, Irene falls into a crisis.\nAfter a few days, Irene is called up by Andr\u00e9 and agrees to meet with him. Like her husband and mother, he urges her to find a way out of her present state and stop blaming herself for Michel's death. If there were anyone to blame, it was post-war society and the child's growing up in fear during a war. He tells Irene of a young boy doomed to die because his poor family can't afford to pay for the expensive medicine. After paying a visit to the boy's home with Andr\u00e9, Irene, shaken by the poor circumstances which the family lives in, donates the money needed for the medication. On her next visit, she is thanked by the child's family and the neighbours who gather spontaneously. A young woman neighbour, Ines, shows up and complains about the noise which prevents her from sleeping. The neighbours, speaking disdainfully of her, tell Irene that Ines is working as a prostitute during the night.\nIrene meets a young woman living with six children in a small shack by the river. Three of the children are her own, which she had with a lover who left her, while the three others are orphans taken in by her. Asked by Irene to help the young woman, Andr\u00e9 secures her a job at a local factory. Shortly before her first day at the factory, the young woman tells Irene that she wants to meet a man she once knew and can't show up at her job. Irene steps in for her and is concerned about the working conditions. When she later tells Andr\u00e9 of her experience, he argues that the exploited have to be freed, even if it means the use of violence. Irene rejects his view, as for her, love is the only answer to the world's troubles, and says that she is dreaming of a paradise both for the living and the departed. At home, she is accused by George of having an affair with Andr\u00e9.\nAfter visiting a church, Irene runs into Ines, who just had a confrontation with other prostitutes for streetwalking in their district. Irene takes Ines back to her home, where Ines coughs up blood. She has her examined by a doctor, who declares that Ines is in the final state of tuberculosis and that her case is hopeless. Irene watches over Ines, who eventually dies of her illness. When she goes to a neighbour to bring her the news, she is confronted with their armed teenage son, who is on the run from the police after a bank robbery. Irene helps him escape, but urges him to turn himself in by his own free will.\nIrene is taken into custody by the police for helping a delinquent escape. When the teenage robber turns himself in, and George's lawyer appeals to the police arguing that Irene is in a state of shock after her son's death, and that her husband is an important representative of the American industry, she is put under observation in a mental institution. There, she has a discussion with a priest who appreciates her desire to help as being of a true Christian spirit, but argues that all help and acts of love have to follow certain regulations. Irene disagrees, calling these regulations responsible for the evils in this world, which can only be overcome with love and compassion for oneself and everybody else. Shortly after, she witnesses an inmate being rescued from a suicide attempt. She lies down next to the woman, telling her that she is not alone and that she will stay by her side.\nSome time later, Irene is questioned by a committee, consisting of representatives of the law, George's lawyer, and the head of the mental institution. Again, she tries to explain her motives by saying that she simply wants to help those who are in need of help, and that salvation is only possible if everyone is saved. As her explanation does neither suffice from a radical political nor a dogmatic Christian point of view, she is declared mentally unstable and institutionalised. Under the window of her room, the family of the saved poor boy, their neighbours and the young woman from the shack have gathered, calling her a saint.

Instead of being frightened, she climbs onto the dog's back and falls asleep in his fur. Despite wincing at her kneading, Marc instantly falls for the kitten and decides to adopt her, bringing her home with him.\nUpon his arrival, his human owner (voiced by Bea Benaderet), tired of picking up his things, orders him not to bring one more thing inside the house. As she reprimands him, Marc Anthony discreetly hides the kitten under a bowl. Much of the cartoon centers on the kitten keeping several steps ahead of the dog, continually getting into things around the house. Each time she nearly alerts the dog's owner of her presence, he employs various tactics to hide or disguise her as common household items, including a powder puff, much to his owner's confusion.\nAfter a while, Marc Anthony takes the kitten into the kitchen and tries to reprimand her, but quickly forgets his anger when she tries to play with his wagging finger. But when he hears his owner walking toward the kitchen, he hastily hides the kitten in a flour canister and tries to look innocent. Growing tired of his antics, his owner ejects him from the kitchen and tells him to stay out while she bakes cookies.

The lady pours the flour, along with the kitten, into a mixing bowl and prepares to use an electric mixer.

His exasperated owner sees through his disguise and throws him out of the house.

His mistress comes out a short time later and, believing he is crying over being disciplined, lets him back inside and tells him he has been punished enough. She attempts to console him by giving him a cookie in the shape of a cat.

He visits a local pub, \"The Rose and Crown\", and finds the place packed with soldiers, including his own driver. He resolves to try and secure something more entertaining for the troops and decides to copy the idea of a brains trust, as in a popular BBC radio programme, where panellists answer questions from the audience.\nWith the help of Lady Dodds, Paris manages to gather together a group of local notables.

Having only just averted this, a question about marriage from Killigrew reveals the fragility of the Prouts' marriage.

When untangled, he runs after his prey,  but when getting near, he discovers Road Runner can travel even faster and he propels himself far away from the Coyote who is left behind astounded by this pace. Wile E. Coyote thinks hard, and tries using several methods:\n1. As the Road Runner speeds at 130 mph across the mountain roads, the coyote fires a bow loaded with some dynamite attached to an arrow. However, it is just like that \u2014 he fires the bow, and the dynamite explodes on himself. The middle portion of the arrow falls off.\n2. The fuming Coyote loads himself onto a slingshot; however, the support breaks out of the ground and wedges him into a cactus.\n3. Wile E. Coyote now tries covering the ground with quick-drying cement to stop the Road Runner. Unfortunately, the Road Runner cuts directly through it without being touched, and the Coyote is covered all over. Enraged, Wile E. attempts to follow, but the cement dries, leaving him frozen stiff like a statue.\n4. Hoping to avoid being hit with loose ends, Wile hides himself under a manhole with an armed hand grenade, but the Road Runner passes through the road fast enough to drop a boulder on top of the cover, which prevents the Coyote from throwing the grenade out at the bird before it explodes. Dazed, Wile peeks out to inspect the cause, and the manhole cover, and then the boulder, land on his head.\n5. Wile E. Coyote dresses as an attractive, blond hitch hiker holding a sign that says \"Ole Virginy or Bust\" in an attempt to lure the Road Runner, but the clever bird speeds right past him and uncovers the Coyote. The Road Runner returns with Wile E's wig, holding up a sign saying \"I've Already Got a Date\".\n6. Using deception, the Coyote paints a realistic picture of a bridge and places it at the dead-end of a high-level road as displayed by a sign that the Coyote turns around to make the facade convincing. The Road Runner runs through the trick picture as if it was a real road. As the Coyote looks on, puzzled, he fails to see a truck emerging through the road in the painting, which promptly runs him over. Frustrated, the Coyote starts after Road Runner but tears through the painting and falls into the chasm, leaving dust in the air that spells out \"Oh, no!\"\n7. Wile heaves a large boulder onto the winding mountain roads which the Road Runner is traveling. Eventually, the Road Runner and the boulder approach the same area, but the Road Runner slips just out of the way, while the boulder is pitched into the air, up a serac, and onto a new set of roads. The Coyote is out peeking at the roads, hoping to see the Road Runner crushed, but instead he is about to suffer the same fate. The boulder is approaching from behind, and Wile E. sees it coming but cannot escape fast enough (this gag is set to Wagner's \"Rienzi\" Overture).\n8. The Coyote, hoping for technology to triumph, uses various ACME devices put together (an anvil, a weather balloon, a street cleaner's bin, and a fan) to create a makeshift air balloon. Floating in the clouds, he sees the Road Runner and releases the anvil, causing the balloon to quickly ascend until it stops. At this point, the string keeping it blown up unfurls, sending it flying through the air until it runs out of air.  Coyote falls through the ground (passing the deflated balloon and the anvil), followed by the anvil falling on his head and the Road Runner passing over him just to embarrass him even further.\n9.

The plane lands at an airport, its giant wheel covering Bugs Bunny's hole. Bugs struggles out and, impressed by the plane, decides to take a look inside. Meanwhile, in town, Yosemite Sam robs the Last National Bank (\"and keep a-reachin' for the ceilin'- till ya' REACH it!!\") then wipes off the assets, which read $4,562,321.08 (stolen amount equivalent to US$37,871,100 in 2021), down to 8 cents. He hears the police approach and drives off to the airport, with plans to hijack a plane and take refuge in another country where the cops cannot find him.\nInside the plane, Bugs has started to pretend he is a World War II pilot, and when Sam boards, he assumes Bugs is the pilot and orders him to take off at once. Before Bugs can protest, Sam threatens to shoot him. Bugs succeeds in finding the ignition button, and the plane sets off down the runway and flies over a busy traffic intersection.\nRacing toward a skyscraper, Bugs pulls the plane up into outer space, sending Sam falling to the plane's tail. When it seems as if the plane is about to crash into the Moon, Bugs steers the plane back down toward Earth, sending Sam falling to the plane's nose. As Sam threatens to have Bugs' license revoked, he discovers the rabbit reading a flying manual and realizes in horror that Bugs is not a pilot and has absolutely no idea how to fly the aircraft. Noticing the Earth growing larger in the window and worrying that they might fatally crash to the ground if Bugs does not do something quick, Sam orders Bugs to read faster, or else. Bugs, however, refuses to read any further in the manual because of Sam's mean talk and orders him to apologize. Sam slaps himself in the head. The United States appears in the window; Sam apologizes to Bugs, but not without insulting him.  Bugs then orders Sam to \"say [he's] sorry with sugar on it.\" Sam refuses and tries to act nonchalant by playing with a yo-yo and a set of jacks. As a farm appears in the window, Sam finally gives in and apologizes properly.\nBugs steers the plane straight back up to the sky, just barely missing the farm in the process, and goes to radio the authorities to inform them that he is bringing the plane back. Sam then orders Bugs to give him the flying manual to keep him from heading back to town where the cops are after him, but Bugs throws it out the open door. Sam runs out to retrieve it, but upon discovering how high he is, he \"runs\" back in. Bugs then lets Sam slip on a banana peel and out the other door. When he hears Sam knocking at the door, Bugs pretends to be a grocer (\"Sorry, can't use any today! [slams door on him] Try next Wednesday.\"). Burning with anger, Sam bursts back in and threatens to blow Bugs to Kingdom Come. Since Sam happens to be standing on the bomb bay doors, Bugs pulls a cord and sends Sam falling out of the plane. Sam panics mid-air and scrambles back into the plane.\nFed up with Bugs' flying, Sam orders Bugs to turn the controls over to him. Instead, Bugs breaks off the control column and tosses it out of the plane, causing the aircraft to descend.  Afraid of crashing, Sam activates the robot pilot.  The pilot comes out, assesses the situation, concludes it is hopeless, takes one of the two parachutes from the parachute locker, and jumps out of the plane itself.\nWith just one parachute left, Bugs decides he and Sam should draw straws to see who gets it.  Sam suggests that Bugs should draw the straws, then quickly grabs the parachute and his bag of stolen money. Sam jumps out, opens the parachute, and, while shouting at Bugs (\"So long, sucker! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha! Ha-ha...Hoo-hoo...Hoo-hoo... Wooooh....\"), the trailing off \"hoo's\" and \"woooh's\" come when he lands with the bank's bag of stolen money in his hands into a conveniently arriving police car full of officers.

Millicent is the only woman he has ever been in love with and they briefly dated, until she dumped him because she did not return his love. Samuel explains to his lawyer Edward Norton (Frank Ferguson) that losing the love of his life was what inspired him to build up a career as a wealthy businessman, eventually becoming the richest man in the world. Fearing the family will spend the money the wrong way, he decides to visit them in a small Vermont town, faking a newspaper advertisement to board a room under the alias John Smith.\nThe family is initially reluctant to take in Samuel, but Roberta, the youngest daughter, (Gigi Perreau) wastes no time and makes him feel as welcome as possible. He notices that the Blaisdells are a happy family who, although poor, are proud of their background. Father Charles (Larry Gates) has taught the family not to put a value on materialistic products. Nevertheless, mother Harriet (Lynn Bari) wishes for her daughter Millicent (Piper Laurie) to marry Carl Pennock (Skip Homeier), a wealthy but snobbish young man who could buy Millicent everything that Harriet never had. Millicent, however, is not keen on Carl and prefers to marry Dan Stebbins (Rock Hudson), a charming but poor soda jerk. While staying at the Blaisdells, 'John' is given a job at Dan's store as soda jerk.\nOne night, Millie and Dan announce their engagement, which upsets Harriet. Shortly after, Norton arrives, announcing the family has inherited $100,000 from an unknown man. When realizing Norton is not joking, the family \u2013 especially Harriet \u2013 immediately gives up their humble life for the upper-class life style. Charles is not enthusiastic of his wife's sudden craze of materialism, but allows her to buy whatever she wants. The oldest son Howard (William Reynolds) immediately starts gambling a large amount of money and lands a debt, which prompts Samuel to help him. Meanwhile, Dan, feeling he could never live up to Millie's expectations, breaks off their engagement. Afterwards, Millie reluctantly starts dating Carl again, much under the pressure of her mother.\nSamuel helps both Millie and Howard escape from a raid, which results in his being jailed. Soon, Harriet feels that Samuel's presence is ruining the family image, unaware of the reason why he ended up in jail. In this period, he is supported only by Dan, who admits his intentions of leaving town to build a career. Trying to prevent Millie and Dan from disappearing out of each other's life, he sets up a meeting at the cinema. There, an argument follows, and Millie exclaims her hatred for the family's sudden wealth, complaining that it is the cause of all bad things happening to her. She is comforted by Samuel, and thereby attracts the attention of other theatre-goers, who suspect that Sam and Millie were necking.\nDuring the ongoing social party at Blaisdell's house, there is gossip of the necking in the cinema, which prompts Harriet to force Millie to announce her engagement to Carl. Meanwhile, Charles announces he has lost his investments, which makes Samuel realize that the Blaisdells are in no position of making wise financial decisions. Obligated by Samuel, Norton refuses a loan, after which Charles begs the Pennocks for money. Pennock Senior (Paul McVey) refuses the loan to Charles and leaves with wife and son Carl the party, which makes clear that the engagement is off.  Much to Harriet's distress, the Blaisdell family returns to their old lifestyle. At the end, Roberta reveals that 'John' has won the first prize at an art show, having secretly entered his paintings.

The King is fond of hunting, but is unfortunately cross-eyed \u2013 not that anyone would dare acknowledge this in front of him, as the numerous statues and paintings that adorn the palace and the land show him with regular eyes. Occasionally, the King does hit his target, though; notably, the wife of the bird. The bird, known only as l'Oiseau, is the narrator of the story and takes pleasure in taunting the king at every opportunity.\nIn his secret apartment, the King dreams of the beautiful shepherdess whose painting he keeps on his wall, but the shepherdess is in love with the chimney sweep whose hated portrait is on the opposite wall. At night, the paintings come to life and attempt to escape from the palace, but are pursued by a non-cross-eyed painting of the king that also has come to life. He deposes the real king, takes his place, and orders the capture of the shepherdess and the sweep, but the bird is there to help when called upon.\nLater, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep find themselves in the lower city, where the inhabitants have never seen the light. Meanwhile, the King summons a robot built for him, and he attacks the village. He takes the shepherdess and captures the chimney sweep, the bird, and a blind organ-grinder from the village, putting the organ-grinder in a pen of lions and tigers. The King forces the shepherdess to agree to marry him, threatening to kill the chimney sweep if she does not accept. When she does, the King sends the chimney sweep and the bird to paint manufactured sculptures of his head on a conveyor belt. They begin to ruin the sculptures, and are sent to jail, where the lions and tigers have been listening to the organ-grinder playing. The bird convinces them to help the shepherdess, saying that her marriage to the King prevents her from tending to the sheep, which the animals eat. The animals break out of the jail and attack the interviewers and king in the chapel. The bird and his sons take control of the robot and start destroying the castle. Once the castle is in rubble, the King attacks the couple, but the robot grabs him and blows him into the distance. Sitting on the ruins of the castle the next morning, the robot sees one of the bird's sons trapped in a cage. After freeing the bird, the robot smashes the cage.\nOnly the early scene in the secret apartment is based on \"The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep\", while the rest of the movie focuses much more on the king and the bird, hence the ultimate title. In Andersen's tale, the shepherdess and the chimney sweep are china figurines, rather than paintings, and a wooden (mahogany) satyr wishes to wed the shepherdess, supported by a Chinaman, rather than a king and a classical statue. In both tales, the Chinaman statue breaks, and the duo escape up the chimney, and delight in celestial bodies, but in Andersen's tale the shepherdess is afraid of the wide world and the duo return; this is echoed in the movie where the statue predicts that they will return.\nThe 1952 film ends with the bird taking a photo of the newly-wed shepherdess and chimney sweep along with the king's dog, all of the bird's sons, and others after the king is vanquished."}, "11750190": {"title": "King of the Congo", "plot": "Captain Roger Drum (Buster Crabbe) shoots down an enemy plane carrying microfilm while on its way to Africa to deliver it an enemy of America.

Mysto's tricks primarily come from his magic wand, which can summon flowers and rabbits. After Mysto performs a poorly executed dance and asks him if he gets the job, an annoyed and the unimpressed Poochini emphatically says \"NO!\" as he kicks Mysto out the door into the alley.\nWhile on the ground, the self-pitying Mysto plays with his magic wand, but soon realizes he can pass it off as a conductor's baton; being further inspired by seeing himself in place of the conductor in a promotional poster outside the door and plans to get revenge on Poochini. Later, as the performance is starting he freezes the conductor, steals his tuxedo, nose and hair; then takes his place in front of the orchestra to conduct the Poochini, who is unaware of the imposter in front of him.\nDuring the performance, in which Poochini (performed by the Colombian baritone Carlos Julio Ram\u00edrez) sings Largo al factotum from Gioacchino Rossini's 1816 opera The Barber of Seville, Mysto unleashes a variety of tricks with his wand. He begins tamely by summoning rabbits and flowers, then turning Poochini into a ballet dancer, an Indian, a tennis player, a prisoner rock-breaker, and a football player. Mysto's revenge gets more brutal as he throws a cymbal on Poochini's head, turning him Chinese and making him sing the Oriental riff; and next transforming him into a country singer and sings \"Oh My Darling, Clementine\". After levitating Poochini to the ceiling and slamming him down to the stage, Mysto turns him into a square dance caller. Poochini actually continues his performance for a good 20 seconds after this without interruption, except for the \"hair gag\" where he removes a hair from the film gate and tosses it away.\nPoochini is then transformed into a Shirley Temple-esque child (who sings \"A-Tisket, A-Tasket\" before the balloon blows up and pops), then a Carmen Miranda-type singer, singing \"Mam\u00e3e Eu Quero\" (with two rabbits accompanying him on guitar) after an irritated audience member hurls an armload of fruit onto Poochini's head where it piles up like Miranda's headdress. The same man later sprays black ink on Poochini from a fountain pen, turning him into Bill Kenny from the Ink Spots, then drops an anvil on top of him, crushing him into a shorter height and deepening his voice to that of the Ink Spots' bass, \"Hoppy\" Jones (parodying the Ink Spots' famous \"Top & Bottom\" format).  After a rabbit hoses off Poochini's face and another rabbit works his arm like an automobile jack to get him back up to full height, the fun continues as he is transformed into a Hawaiian singer with two rabbits for harmony.\nReaching the end of the number, Mysto's plan is finally revealed to Poochini as his wig falls off. Mysto quickly puts the wig back on, but it's too late. Now set for revenge of his own, Poochini furiously grabs the hairpiece and puts it on while a now defeated and exposed Mysto cowardly tries to flee; but Poochini, having also grabbed the magic wand, stops the magician by using the wand on him as placing Mysto to the stage and unleashes the same gimmicks on the hapless magician at high speed.

Coyote running up to Bugs Bunny's burrow and constructing a door. He knocks on the door and Bugs, slightly bemused by the addition to his property, opens it saying his famous catchphrase: \"Eh, what's up, Doc?\" The Coyote proclaims, in his very first spoken line of dialogue ever, that he is a genius, as well as being faster, taller, and stronger than Bugs, and that he intends to eat the rabbit too. He goes on to advise Bugs that it is futile to try and escape, since Bugs \"could hardly pass the entrance examinations to kindergarten\", an insult that seems to bore Bugs. (Wile E. displays an enlarged self-confidence throughout not only this film but also in other appearances with Bugs, aside from Hare-Breadth Hurry.) An unimpressed Bugs then slams the door in Wile E.'s face (\"I'm sorry, Mac, the lady of the house ain't home. And besides, we mailed you people a check last week,\"). The Coyote goes back to his cave home, taking the door with him (\"Why do they always want to do it the hard way?\").\n1. The Coyote's first plan is to trap Bugs in his own hole by putting a portable pressure cooker on top of it, cooking Bugs alive. He chops up vegetables, throws them down the hole, adds an egg, a drop of cooking oil, some seasoning, tosses it into a salad, then places the pressure cooker on top. Bugs watches Wile E.'s work from another hole (suggesting his burrow has a back door), then walks up to him and asks \"Eh, what's cookin', Doc?\" When Wile E. informs him that \"rabbit stew\" is cooking (\"Gad, I'm SUCH a genius!\"), Bugs casually observes, \"There's only one little thing wrong with it\", that there is no rabbit. As Wile E. frantically looks under the cooker, Bugs gives him a big kick down the hole and sticks the cooker on top of him. Bugs then goes back down the second hole while singing, \"I'm lookin' over a three-leaf clover that I overlooked bethree...\", picks up a bat, and clobbers the Coyote from below (off-screen), prompting Wile E., with a huge lump on his head, to remark: \"Well, back to the old drawing board.\"\n2. In the next scene, the Coyote prepares his second plan: the use of a chute for firing a cannonball into Bugs' hole. After the ball arrives in the hole via a cannon and that chute, Bugs uses a second chute to return the ball, where it explodes on target, causing the plan to quite literally backfire on Wile E.\nBugs then goes to Wile E.'s cave, claiming that he is surrendering \"on account of I cannot fight no more against such genius,\" and wants Wile E. to sign as a witness to his last will and testament. He gives the Coyote the document and a \"fountain pen\", which is really a stick of dynamite being lit. Wile E. pretends to be fooled, putting out the fuse when Bugs hands over the dynamite (\"Very amateurish attempt on my person\"). While he gloats (\"Being a genius certainly has its advantages\"), Wile E. is unaware that there is another lit fuse at the other end of the dynamite. Once Wile E. spots the fuse in dazed shock, the dynamite explodes on cue.\n3. The Coyote then builds a mechanical (and explosive) lady rabbit that will be used as a decoy for Bugs. (\"Brilliance. That's all I can say. Sheer, unadulterated brilliance!\") Bugs, already anticipating this plan, builds an explosive lady coyote in response (\"Fight fire with fire, I always say\"). Bugs detonates the coyote robot just as Wile E. is romantically embracing it in his cave. With this distraction, Wile E. completely forgets about the rabbit robot (\"Oh, NO!\"), which, as he is in the process of trying to throw it out, also blows up in the cave.\n4. The Coyote then creates an exploding flying saucer with a radarscope mechanism able to detect birds, mice, and rabbits. The disc flies to Bugs' hole, but Bugs thwarts it by putting on a chicken mask, though the saucer quickly looks back when Bugs tries to peek, but Bugs is quicker and fools it again, so it finally turns away in uncertainty. The disguised Bugs then adds \"COYOTE\" to the radarscope's target options and moves the dial there. The saucer speeds back to Wile E.'s cave, blowing the entire mountain to smithereens.\n5. The Coyote makes one last plan: filling a row of fake carrots with liquid nitroglycerin inside an explosives shack within a construction site (set to Carl Stalling's quote of a Richard Wagner leitmotiv from Siegfried). Bugs, using a tractor and a rope lasso, pulls the shack to a nearby railroad line.  The rope is released and the shack, with Wile E. inside, is sitting on the tracks. As Wile E. admires his new self-given title of \"Super Genius\" while finishing his carrot baits, a train is seen approaching. Upon hearing the train whistle, the Coyote turns to the shack window to see the train bearing down on him, and futilely pulls down a window shade. When the train hits the shack, all of the explosives in the shack detonate. The painfully burned Coyote groans in an ironic tone while holding a tree branch on the edge of a cliff as the train chugs away below undamaged (\"'Wile E. Coyote - Super Senious'\").\nWile E., still dazed and covered in ash, returns to Bugs' hole, rebuilds his door, knocks on it and admits defeat (\"Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Mud\",) before passing out. In response, Bugs says, \"And remember, MUD spelled backwards is DUM (as in dumb)\" (a spoof of the advertising slogan for Serutan laxatives, \"Serutan spelled backwards is 'natures'\"), shaking his head and swirling his eyebrows as the iris fades out."}, "9397049": {"title": "Outcast of the Islands", "plot": "Peter Willems (Trevor Howard), a selfish and ambitious man, is accused of stealing in his position as manager of a shipping port operation near Singapore.

Zapt introduces him to the soon-to-be-crowned king, Rudolf V, who turns out to be not only his distant relative, but also looks just like him (except for the Englishman's mustache). The king, surprised at first, takes a great liking to the Englishman, and invites him to stay at the royal hunting lodge.\nThey celebrate their acquaintance by drinking late into the night. King Rudolf is particularly delighted with a bottle of wine given to him by his scheming half-brother, Duke Michael (Douglas), so he drinks it all himself, and he soon passes out. The next morning brings a disastrous discovery: the wine was drugged. Rudolf cannot be awakened, and if he cannot attend his coronation that day, Michael will try to assume the throne as Regent. It is revealed that Michael is bitter that, because his mother was not of royal blood, the younger Rudolf is the heir to the kingdom. Zapt is able to convince a reluctant Rassendyll to impersonate Rudolf for the ceremony.\nRassendyll meets Rudolf's betrothed, Princess Flavia (Kerr). She had always disliked her cousin Rudolf, but now finds him greatly changed, very much for the better.

Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, professes no interest in the dowry; but to Mary Kate, the dowry is a matter of pride and represents her personal value within the community and her independence. She insists the dowry must be received to validate their marriage, causing her and Sean to become estranged. The villagers eventually persuade Will to release Mary Kate's furniture, but Will withholds the monetary portion of the dowry.\nMary Kate believes Sean is a coward for not fighting Will.

A. \"Pop\" Miller and four other men, Cliff leaves the smokejumper base at Missoula, Montana to parachute into a nearly inaccessible area of Bugle Peak.\nHours later, at base, superintendent Richard \"Dick\" Dryer becomes worried because Cliff is not answering radio calls.\nThe next day, after the fire crowns, Dick flies by helicopter into the area and is stunned to find only Cliff, in shock and wandering through the devastated region. Cliff is rushed to the hospital, where he gradually recovers, although he cannot remember how he got separated from his men, or why he was the only one to survive.\nUpon his return home, Cliff is greeted by Pop's son Ed, who is also a smokejumper. Ed expresses genuine concern for Cliff, but Cliff, sensitive about his lack of memory and worried that he might be responsible for his crew's deaths, becomes antagonistic.\nA board of review conducts a hearing into the matter, and Cliff grows increasingly defensive after several grueling days of repetitious questioning. Cliff's paranoia grows that he might be thought a coward who deserted his men despite the assurances of his devoted wife Peg and Dick, who lets him return to work only as supervisor of training.\nEd continues to grill Cliff, asking him how he might have come to be in the protected rock slide area that was the only possible place of survival when the bodies of his crew were found on an exposed ridge across the valley. Ed's suspicions escalate and Cliff reacts even more bitterly. One night, an emergency crew is called out to repair downed transmission lines, and when Cliff's longtime friend Boise Peterson is shocked by a live wire, Cliff saves him. Ed pointedly remarks that it was not necessary for Cliff to prove his bravery. Cliff is cleared by the board of review but confides to Peg that he is plagued by doubts about his courage. Later, Dick shows Ed a watch, mistakenly sent to another man's family, that Ed recognizes as his father's. Upset again, Ed confronts Cliff with the watch, and jogs his memory.\nCliff recalls that when the fire began to race along the treetops, all of them had reached the rockslide where he urged them to lie down in the crevices. However a burning snag fell on the rockslide and the crew continued running. Cliff attempted to stop Pop, pulling off his watch and ID tag as they grappled, but Pop knocked him into a crevice that protected Cliff from the worst of the fire. Ed furiously accuses Cliff of deserting his men and goes AWOL, parachuting from a private airplane onto Bugle Peak, where he finds Pop's identification bracelet on the ridge, not on the rockslide, where Cliff says he saw Pop last. Believing he has obtained proof that Cliff abandoned his men on the ridge, Ed returns to base, only to discover that Cliff and another team of men have been sent to fight a fire in Carson Canyon. Confronting Dick with the ID tag, Ed accuses Cliff of killing his father, and Dick fires him from the smokejumper unit for going AWOL on a personal grudge. In Carson Canyon, Cliff's crew brings the fire under control but weather conditions threaten a re-burn, prompting Cliff to request more men and equipment.\nEd joins the smokejumper reinforcements without authorization and at Carson Canyon tracks down Cliff, scouting the fire that now has them trapped. After losing his head and trying to kill Cliff with the axe end of his Pulaski, Ed breaks his leg when he tumbles down a slope as they fight. Cliff returns to the crew's anchor point to organize the men, sending three with heavier equipment to bring in Ed. Cliff orders the others to dig foxholes, knowing that burying themselves and allowing the fire to pass over them is their only hope for survival. The men protest but grudgingly comply when Cliff insists. Ed is surprised to discover that Cliff is responsible for his rescue, and when he is brought back to the anchor point, the crew panics and starts to flee. Ed sees Cliff knock down Boise to quell the panic and realizes Cliff was telling the truth about Bugle Peak.\nAfter the fire has passed, all of the smokejumpers have survived and Ed, reconciling with Cliff, sheepishly grins and asks for a cigarette, inspiring Boise to do the same.

After the two decide to get married, Moreau learns that his best man, Philippe de Valmorin, is in hiding for participating in the revolution and distributing pamphlets under the allonym Marcus Brutus. Moreau tells de Valmorin to leave Paris, taking Lenore with him. At the same time, Moreau visits his lawyer, Fabien, and forcefully threatens him to disclose the name of his father in order to learn why he has stopped sending an allowance. When Moreau and de Valmorin rendezvous in the woods, it is without Lenore, who, not knowing the identity or motive of de Valmorin, escaped the carriage. They continue on their journey to meet Moreau's father, who is revealed to be the Comte de Gavrillac. Moreau runs into Aline de Gavrillac when her carriage breaks down in the road. They are strongly attracted to each other, but Moreau's ardor suddenly cools when he learns that she is his half-sister. He hides that information from her, partly because of sympathy, when they both enter the House of Gavrillac to see that the Comte has died.\nBy chance, de Maynes encounters de Valmorin. A master swordsman, de Maynes provokes de Valmorin into a duel, then toys with his inexperienced opponent before finally killing him. Enraged, Moreau attacks, but does no better than his dead friend. After de Maynes easily disarms him several times, Moreau chooses discretion over valor and flees for his life, vowing to kill de Maynes the same way he slew de Valmorin.\nChased by de Maynes' henchmen, led by the Chevalier de Chabrillaine, Moreau hides out in the commedia dell'arte troupe in which Lenore performs. Forced to disguise himself as the character Scaramouche, he discovers a hidden talent as a performer. Burning for revenge, Moreau seeks out de Maynes' fencing instructor, Doutreval of Dijon, and trains diligently in secret for weeks, while also performing with the troupe. However, de Maynes appears during one such training session, and they fight for a second time. Moreau is still overmatched, and is saved only by Aline's unexpected arrival, enabling Moreau to escape (with Doutreval's assistance).\nHe decides to seek out Doutreval's teacher, Perigore of Paris, the man who according to Doutreval \"is the master of all swordsmen.\" Moreau takes the troupe to Paris for that purpose. There, Dr. Dubuque, a deputy of the new National Assembly, seeks his help. The aristocrats in the assembly are systematically killing off the deputies representing the common people by provoking them into duels. Moreau is not interested, until Dubuque mentions that de Maynes is one of the duelists; then he eagerly accepts the seat of a deceased deputy. Each day, he shows up at the assembly to challenge de Maynes, only to find his enemy absent on trivial but official duties, arranged by Aline and Lenore working together to protect the man they both love. However, other nobles in the National Assembly are eager to fight the newcomer, challenging him on a daily basis. Moreau wins every duel; the Chevalier de Chabrillaine barely escapes with his life.\nIn the meantime, de Maynes becomes engaged to Aline. Overhearing de Maynes' intention to confront Moreau that night, Aline persuades him to take her out instead. At the suggestion of de Chabrillaine, they attend a performance of the De Binet Troupe, where Andre seizes his opportunity for revenge. The two men engage in a prolonged duel (reputedly the longest in screen history at about seven minutes) that ranges throughout the theater and finally back onto the stage itself. At the end, Moreau has de Maynes at his mercy, helpless as Philippe de Valmorin had been, but something he cannot explain stays his hand. Moreau stalks off, leaving de Maynes bloodied but alive.\nLater, Moreau learns from Philippe's father that his father is not the Comte de Gavrillac, but rather the old Marquis de Maynes, the Comte de Gavrillac's friend; Noel, the man he could not kill, is his half-brother.

Lina is convinced that they truly are in love, despite Don's protestations otherwise.\nAt the premiere of their latest film, The Royal Rascal, Don tells the gathered crowd a version of his life story, including his motto: \"Dignity, always dignity.\" His words are humorously contradicted by flashbacks showing him alongside his best friend Cosmo Brown (\"Fit as a Fiddle\"). To escape from his fans after the premiere, Don jumps into a passing car driven by Kathy Selden.

Yes! Yes!\" and the villain nods his head while Lina's squeaky soprano says, \"No! No! No!\"\nAfterward (\"Good Morning\"), Kathy and Cosmo help Don come up with the idea to turn The Dueling Cavalier into a musical called The Dancing Cavalier, complete with a modern musical number and backstory. The three are disheartened when they realize Lina's terrible voice remains a problem. Still, Cosmo, inspired by the scene in The Dueling Cavalier where Lina's voice was out of sync, suggests that they dub Lina's voice with Kathy's (\"Singin' in the Rain\"). After hearing Don and Cosmo pitch the idea (\"Broadway Melody\"), R.F. approves but tells them not to inform Lina that Kathy is doing the dubbing.  Having learned the truth, an infuriated Lina barges in on a dubbing session, and becomes even angrier when she is told that Don and Kathy are in love and intend to marry, and that R.F. intends to give Kathy a screen credit and a big publicity buildup.

Claude becomes disgusted with the dog and begins murmuring while looking at the audience.\nFrisky is seen running through the hallway where he sees his ball, and pounces on it causing it to roll under the carpet. He goes after the ball by crawling under the carpet, but he is not quite sure where it is, so he takes a sniff, bites down on the ball and comes out from under the carpet, the ball held tightly in his teeth. He throws the ball up into the air and tries to catch it in his teeth as it falls back to the floor but he misses, and his empty jaws snap shut. He throws the ball up in the air again, but this time it does not come down right after. As he is trying to figure out where the ball is, it drops out of the air and hits him on the head. He gets scared and scampers off behind a wall, yelping all the way. Angrily, he jumps out at the ball and barks at it and walks away, but has to stop for a moment, as he has to scratch. A flea falls to the floor as he looks down at it and gives it a sniff. It jumps at him and he yelps, but as he walks away, the flea jumps back into his fur and he begins scratching again. Frisky's mistress (Bea Benaderet) notices him scratching away and says, \"So, Mr. Frisky - I see YOU need a bath! Well, there's no time like the present.\"\nAs his mistress carries him, they pass Claude who is watching and sticks out his tongue at Frisky. Frisky escapes and his mistress yells, \"Frisky, you come back here this minute!\" Frisky hides under the couch, and Claude goes over to the couch skirt and lifts it up with his hind leg as the mistress asks herself, \"Where is that dog?  Oh there you are, you naughty thing!\" and carries him back to the wash tub. We see her pouring boiling hot water into the wash tub when the phone rings. She says, \"Oh dear, that phone again!  Now you stay right there till I get back!\" Frisky is backed into a corner and cannot escape. As Claude tests the water to see how hot it is, Frisky sneaks up behind him and lets out a loud bark. This scares Claude and again he is seen leaping upward out of the scene, and as he falls, he lands in the tub of hot water.\nMad at the dog for scaring him, Claude picks up a pail and fills it with the hot water, and runs through the house after Frisky. He pauses for a moment when he cannot find the puppy, but Frisky sees him and barks loudly again, sending Claude and the hot water bucket hurtling toward the ceiling. Claude lets go of the ceiling, and you know that they say - cats always land on their feet, and just as he is about to hit the floor, he stops in mid-air, the bucket turns upside down and he lands normally on all fours. What is left of the hot water in the bucket empties out on to the floor, and he walks on with the bucket hanging over his body.\nFrisky is outside now, and Claude sneaks behind a tree to spy on him. It happens to be the same tree that Frisky is behind, but he does not notice. Frisky lets out a loud bark, sending Claude sailing through the air, and he lands in a watering can. Back inside, Frisky is chewing on part of the carpet and Claude is seen with a bone attached to the line of a fishing rod. He casts the bone to Frisky, but he lets go of the bone and the hook ends up hooking the rim of the fish bowl. It lands on a pillow on the floor and as Claude reels it in, he thinks Frisky is at the end of it and he leaps from behind the wall to scare him, landing with a splash into the fish bowl.\nNow Claude is really angry. He sharpens an ax and runs through the house like an ax-wielding maniac. Frisky watches from the upstairs hallway and Claude notices. Claude runs up the stairs toward Frisky, but Frisky sneaks up behind Claude and lets out a loud bark, sending Claude and the ax skyward. Holding onto the ax which is stuck in the ceiling, the handle comes out of the ax, and Claude lands on and starts sliding down the banister. He lands on a roller skate, which sends him wheeling through the house at breakneck speed. As he holds on for dear life, he craftily avoids any furniture in the way and in a chain reaction, he gets shot out the front door and into a children's wagon at such speed, the wagon starts rolling and then hits a brick wall, sending him sailing through the neighbor's upstairs window, freaking out the lady of the house who lets out a blood-curdling scream. She kicks him back out the window and he lands in a rain barrel at the bottom of a downspout. Frisky notices Claude in the barrel and lets out a bark, sending him airborne again. This time Claude has nothing to hold on to, and he falls into the chimney on the way down, clumsily landing on some fire logs which roll across the room. He grabs on to a water dispenser, and he and the logs and the water dispenser fall down the basement stairs with a crash. Claude comes back up the stairs, but he is inside the water bottle; only his feet are outside the lip of the bottle. Frisky reappears and barks at Claude, sending him shooting toward the ceiling again. As he hits the ceiling, the glass water bottle smashes open and what is left of the water falls toward the floor, sending a frightened Frisky out of the scene.\nClaude chases Frisky outside again and into a laundry truck. Frisky gets caught in a sweater, but before he can get away, Claude latches on to the sweater with a claw and Frisky runs away, leaving a trail of wool string. Claude ties the string to the truck (thinking that when the truck takes off, it will take Frisky with it) and he follows the string to where he believes Frisky will be when he gets to the end. The string is everywhere - through the banister rails, in and out two mouse holes, through the handles of a vase, in and out of a kettle, through the hot and cold water taps, and into a tipped over trash can. Claude investigates the trash can, but Frisky is nowhere to be found. As Claude grabs the end of the string, the truck's engine starts and it drives off, sending him back the way he came through all of the objects, all the while holding onto the string! (at this point you have to ask yourself, why he did not just let go of the string?) As he exits the house, he is hurtled into the air and lands on a swimming pool diving board in a neighboring yard. As he bounces up in the air, he holds his nose as if he is going to plunge into the water, and as he falls, we see there is no water in the pool and he lands with a thud at the bottom of the dry pool, cracking the cement.

Flagg has developed a romantic relationship with the daughter of the local innkeeper, Charmaine, and resumes their relationship after returning from the front.  However, he lies to her and tells her he is married when she wants to come with him on his leave to Paris.  Replacements arrive and their lack of discipline and knowledge infuriate the captain.  But he is expecting the arrival of a new top sergeant, who he hopes will be able to train them properly. However, when the sergeant arrives, it is Quirt, Captain Flagg's longtime rival, and their rivalry quickly re-ignites.\nFlagg leaves for Paris, and while he is away, Quirt begins to romance Charmaine.  At the same time, another of the new arrivals, Private Lewisohn, begins a romance with a young woman of the village.  When Flagg returns, he is approached by Charmaine's father, Whiskey Pete, who expresses concern over his daughter's relationship with Quirt.  Flagg becomes angry, as Quirt has moved in on other girlfriends of Flagg in the past.  But he sees this as an opportunity to get even with Quirt once and for all, by using Pete's concern to force Quirt to marry Charmaine, taking him off the market once and for all.  As the wedding approaches, the unit receives orders to move back to the front lines.  Flagg sees an opportunity to add insult to injury by not informing Quirt of the impending deployment, until after the wedding, which would mean sending Quirt into battle immediately after the ceremony.\nAs he sets up Quirt's wedding, Flagg is approached by Lewisohn, who wants to marry Nicole Bouchard, a local girl he has known for eight days.  Flagg convinces him to wait.  General Cokely visits the unit shortly before deployment, promising Flagg that if they can capture an Imperial German Army officer, he will allow the company to retire from the front, as well as giving a week's leave to Flagg. Flagg's surprise is spoiled, and Quirt refuses to marry Charmaine, offering Flagg the choice of taking him into battle or sending him to headquarters to be court-martialed.  Flagg realizes Quirt's value in battle and takes him to the front lines.\nAt the front, Flagg's attempts to capture a live German officer lead to the death of Lieutenant Moore, after which a wounded Aldrich goads Flagg and Quirt in attempting to capture the officer themselves. On their way behind enemy lines, they both realize they love Charmaine, which once again re-heats their rivalry.  The two do manage to capture a German colonel, but as they are bringing him back to the American lines, they are hit by a German barrage, killing the colonel and wounding Quirt. Quirt taunts Flagg with the fact that he will be going back to the village first, giving him the first shot at Charmaine. Right after he leaves for the base hospital in the village, Lewisohn brings a German lieutenant he has captured to Flagg.  The joy is short-lived however, as Lewisohn is almost immediately killed by a German barrage after handing his prisoner over.\nFlagg calls Cokely to tell him of the officer's capture, only to have Cokely renege on his pledge to withdraw Flagg's company from the front.  As Flagg leads his Marines deeper into enemy territory, Quirt begins to woo Charmaine.  Before the two can marry, Flagg returns from the front, confesses to her that he is not married, and proposes to her.  Charmaine cannot decide between the two men, leading to a fight between them.  The two decide to play cards for the right to marry Charmaine.  Flagg wins, after bluffing Quirt, but before he can marry Charmaine, Sergeants Lipinsky and Kiper arrive and let Flagg know they have been ordered back to the front.  After initially balking at the order, Flagg realizes he cannot desert his men.\nAs the Marines move out, Flagg tells Kiper that he has been discharged, and that he has kept the discharge hidden from him for over a year.  Rather than become angry, Kiper slings his weapon over his shoulder and joins the Marines marching out.

Once there, they become separated, and the Commissario finds Halligan. When he insists that Brewster is on a pilgrimage, the Commissario goes to the last stop, St. Peters, where they take him into custody and send him off in a van. Halligan, miserable at having inadvertently betrayed his friend, is convinced that the man is reformed: Then the news comes that Brewster has somehow escaped, which leaves Halligan unsure of himself and his judgement.\nRetracing his steps, Halligan returns to the monastery. To his surprise, Brewster is there, wearing monk\u2019s robes. He asks the abbot: Did Brewster tell him his whole story? Is he a worthy penitent? The abbot nods. Brewster writes to Halligan: prison was all past and no future, and this place is all future and no past. He asks when the next Holy Year will be.

He hires a catcher to catch for him and he is always just a bit off because of his eyesight.\nIn 1910 he returns to baseball after he wakes up one morning and his eyes are perfect again.

Carlitos is scolded harshly by his father when he comes home, and is locked in his room. Carlitos runs away, but is found by an engineer named Julio Mistral who works in the forest. Julio returns the boy to his parents, and Don Carlos is very grateful. Julio becomes great friends with the Montero family, but in private asks Rosario why she really married such a harsh mannered and older man.\nOne day, Rosario and Carlitos pay a visit to Julio in the forest, while Don Carlos spends the day in town on business. Carlitos enjoys himself immensely, fishing for trout. Rosario and Julio converse privately, and Julio notes how unhappy she is. Rosario reveals that she is unhappy because she married Don Carlos for his money when she was very young. Julio sympathizes her plight as a woman who has never truly loved, and they fall in love with each other.\n\nRosario and Julio begin an affair, and Julio tries to convince her to run away with him to Brazil.

One day, news arrives that Julio Mistral has died and decided to will all of his money to Miguel. Initially, everybody is perplexed at this action, as Julio had never met Miguel.\nThough it is not explicitly stated in the film, Carlos soon pieces together that Miguel was willed this money because he is the illegitimate child of Julio and his mother, Rosario. Carlos refuses Miguel's offer to share his inheritance, which he uses to build a new clinic, and begins acting bitter towards his mother and brother. Miguel becomes engaged to be married to a woman who Carlos is convinced wants to marry him for his money. At his wedding, Don Carlos collapses and dies from a heart attack.\nThe film comes to a conclusion as Carlos finally discloses the truth about the inheritance to Miguel, who becomes very angry and fights Carlos.

Although the crew is overdue for shore leave, Porter, a cold, efficient leader, lies to them in order to coerce them to volunteer for the dangerous assignment. Farragut soon reunites with his old shipmate, Chief Petty Officer Link (George Mathews), who tries to convince him that Porter, who years earlier trained Farragut harshly in an attempt to teach him patience and discipline, is not as heartless as he appears. This starts to show itself when Porter later reconciles with Farragut about their past and agree to be civil with one another.\nOnce the ship is at sea, Porter and Farragut open their orders and are dismayed to discover their mission: to disguise themselves as pirates, with no ties to or protection from the United States, in order to track down pirates raiding the West Indies. One night soon after, Farragut is in charge of the ship when a storm hits. Link becomes trapped beneath a keg of rum from which he has tried to sneak a drink and Farragut is forced to break the ship's rudder to rescue him. Porter discovers the damage, but even when he threatens to court-martial Farragut, the officer refuses to inform on Link.\nWithin days, the supplies begin to run out, one of the crew contracts scurvy, and Porter steers the rudderless Essex to the West Indies for repairs and supplies. Farragut grows frustrated with the slow drift and, although Porter forbids anyone to enter the shark-infested waters, he tries to repair the rudder himself. When a shark attacks and Farragut's rope catches on a barnacle, he is barely rescued in time, and Porter chastises him again. Six days later, the men finally reach land and Porter orders Farragut and Link to gather supplies.\nLink is drunk and reported missing from his duty, and when Farragut searches the island's jungle for him, he is captured by natives. They bring Farragut to Portuguese countess Margarita La Raguna (Suzan Ball), who is in hiding. She insists at gunpoint that he take her back to the ship, but once there, she hides the pistol, causing Porter to scoff at Farragut's claim that he was forced to bring her. Margarita reveals that she and her countrymen now live in Rio de Janeiro and wish to use their gold to establish a trade route between Brazil and England. However, the newly reinstated Portuguese king has demanded that his subjects and their riches return to Portugal and abducted her ship while it was en route to England. Her father was killed and the sailing instructions for the Brazilian fleet were stolen, and she needs passage to Brazil to warn the fleet. Porter, as captivated by Margarita's beauty as is Farragut, agrees to take her on board, and as the days pass, the two men vie for her attention.\nOne day, a Portuguese ship appears. Porter waits until the last possible moment to fly the pirate flag but is shocked when the Portuguese captain, Poulini, responds in a friendly manner. However, Margarita is furious to learn they are pirates because the Caribbean pirates, led by Scarjack, are working together with the Portuguese and the corrupt island governor, Count Domingo Del Prado, to steal her people's gold. Porter decides to return Margarita to the islands for her protection, and when she begs Farragut to try to change the captain's mind, Farragut agrees and gives her his medallion as a good luck piece.\nAs they near the island, Margarita overhears Porter and Farragut discussing their camouflage strategy and, assuming they are in league with Del Prado, jumps off the ship and swims ashore. She is immediately captured, as is Farragut when he takes a crew to the island for more supplies. Brought before Del Prado, Margarita denounces Farragut as a pirate and throws down his medallion. Immediately recognizing it as American, Del Prado imprisons them all and tortures Farragut to reveal the ship's plans.\nBack on the ship, Link urges Porter to rescue Farragut, and although he risks being court-martialed for defying his orders, Porter finally agrees. The whole crew infiltrates the island and, disguised as Del Prado's soldiers, attack the dungeon. After freeing Farragut and Margarita, Porter overpowers Del Prado in a sword fight and brings him back to the ship.

Portugal is feeling the after-effects of a storm of anti-religious sentiment and the violent overthrow of the monarchy and the government in the 5 October 1910 revolution. Churches in Lisbon and the rest of Portugal are boarded up. Many priests, nuns, monks and friars are shown being fingerprinted, photographed and registered as possible criminals before being jailed. The rural town of F\u00e1tima is small enough to have escaped much of this persecution; their church remains open, and most of the people are reasonably devout.Watching their flocks and playing in a field outside town on May 15 (the actual date of the first apparition was May 13), L\u00facia Santos (Susan Whitney) and her cousins, Jacinta Marto (Sherry Jackson) and Francisco Marto (Sammy Ogg) decide to pray their version of the Rosary by yelling out, \"Hail Mary!\" but not finishing the prayer. In the midst of this activity, they hear a clap of thunder and see a flash of lightning from a distance. Thinking it is about to rain, the children gather their sheep and head for their homes. Another flash of lightning causes them to run straight into an unusual \"cloud of light\" surrounding a little tree on which a mysterious Lady stands. Speaking slowly and gently, the Lady asks them to return on the 13th of each month, and to offer their sufferings to God for the salvation of sinners. She entreats them to say the Rosary for world peace. Later, they encounter their agnostic friend Hugo da Silva (Gilbert Roland), who tells them it is best not to reveal the vision to anyone else, but of course on returning home, Jacinta immediately divulges her sightings.\nJacinta and Francisco's parents quickly believe the story, but L\u00facia's mother reacts with disgust and subjects her daughter to emotional and physical abuse. She forbids L\u00facia to return to the Cova da Iria, but L\u00facia does so anyway on the next month's appearance (June 13), and is told by the Lady that her cousins will die and go to heaven \"soon\", while she will live a long life in holy service. The parish priest, Father Ferreira (Richard Hale), suggests the visions might be from Satan. The local authorities close the F\u00e1tima church until the priest can convince the parishioners that no visions have or will happen. The next month, on July 13, the Lady appears again, predicting \"another and worse war\" (World War II) will happen if the world doesn't stop sinning. She also predicts evil will come from Russia if that nation is unconverted. Kidnapped by provincial administrator Artur Santos (Frank Silvera; unrelated to L\u00facia Santos), the children are first offered bribes, then threatened with death if they do not change their story. Trying to frighten them, he has first Jacinta, then Francisco dragged into another room. Jacinta's terrified screams convince L\u00facia that her cousins are dead, but she refuses to deny what she has seen. Warning her that she is about to experience \"the full treatment\", Artur Santos reunites her with her cousins, who are alive, then throws them all in jail. There they find Hugo, who stands by them as they convince all the prisoners to join in praying the Rosary.\nUnable to find any prosecutable evidence, Artur Santos frees the children, who find that the entire population of F\u00e1tima has been standing outside, praying and waiting for them.\nOn October 13, when the Lady promised \"a sign that will make them believe\", about forty thousand people arrive, waiting through a torrential downpour. The Lady appears and says that the war (World War I) will be over soon and the soldiers will be returning to their homes. At precisely noon, as the Lady raises her hand, the clouds part and sunlight shines brightly upon all the people \u2014 then the Sun shifts through a rainbow of colours and appears to move closer, in what many have described as the Miracle of the Sun. Many people panic, some pray or watch calmly, and a few sick and disabled people are healed. As the Sun returns to normal, Hugo stands in the middle of the kneeling crowd, his hat still on. Removing it, he says \"Only the fool sayeth there is no God.\"\nA short epilogue, circa 1951, shows the huge basilica where the tree once stood, and a million people outside paying homage to Our Lady of F\u00e1tima.
