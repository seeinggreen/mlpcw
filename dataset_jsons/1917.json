Brand tells Tom about how he and his partner, Adams, participated in the Gold Rush. Brand and Adams had both fallen in love with a woman, though Adams had eventually won her affection and the two were married and had a child. This state of affairs did not last long however, as Adams' wife eventually left him for another man, taking the child with her. Not long after, Brand and Adams struck it rich, however Adams' wife never came back. Brand concludes the story by asking Tom to go out west to repopulate and rebuild the town Brand and Adams had lived in, Nugget Notch. Both so that Brand can relive some of his earlier days, and to potentially find Adams' child, and the heir to his fortune.\nTom does not initially find success in his search for potential occupants of Nugget Notch, but eventually hears about a struggling exposition troupe themed around the Old West, run by a man named J. Gordon Castle. Among this troupe is an innocent woman called Peggy Babbot, along with her parents Pa and Ma Babbot. However, Peggy is constantly watched by a mysterious Mr. Jim Rayner. Tom proposes Judge Brand's idea to Mr. Castle, who agrees. On the way to Nugget Notch, Rayner threatens Pa Bobbet not to let Tom near Peggy, Pa begrudgingly obliges. Tom also writes to Judge Brand that he has assembled a population to live in Nugget Notch, but tells Brand that Rayner seems untrustworthy.\nUpon arrival at Nugget Notch, the troupe begins renovating the town and preparing for Judge Brand's arrival. When the Judge finally arrives, he remarks that the townsfolk are not quite as rough and hardy as the authentic 49ers used to be, but he seems to settle in well. It is then that Raynor learns that the Judge came west partially to find the heir to Adams' fortune, which Rayner takes an interest in. That night, at a banquet held to celebrate Judge Brand's arrival, Brand recognizes a necklace Peggy is wearing and it is revealed that Peggy is in fact Adams' daughter and heiress, with her real name being Lorena Adams. After the banquet, Peggy/Lorena informs Tom and the Judge that Raynor is threatening to have Pa Bobbet killed unless he can give Raynor $1,000 by the next day. Tom decides to confront Raynor and tells him not to harm Peggy.\nLate in the night, Tom is kidnapped and blindfolded by Raynor, who lowers him via rope into a rock formation outside of town. The Judge notices that Tom is gone, and along with a man from the village go to find Tom. However, this was unnecessary as Tom was led out of the rocks by a friendly wolf. They then realize that there is, in fact, still gold in the rock formation. So the men set up a claim. The next day, as Tom and the Judge are talking, some of the townsfolk inform the two that Rayner has stolen all of the money, guns, and horses from the town during the night.

During the proceedings it is revealed that Raynor was the man Adams' wife left Adams for, that Raynor had once been Pa Bobbet's partner and had used the death of a man Raynor had tried to steal from as blackmail against Bobbet for many years, and that Peggy was Pa Bobbet's real daughter all along.

One police officer (Henry Bergman) is told to guard the beach in case the escaped felon came within sight again. However, unbeknownst to the officer, Charlie is actually under a load of sand, buried right next to the officer.\nFully aware of the danger, he is very cautious regarding his escape. He unburies himself very cautiously, however, Bergman is asleep, and he falls back on the hole which Charlie created while un-burying himself. Of course, Charlie makes a run, but it is too late.\nThe officer fires, luckily missing Charlie by an inch. Charlie hurriedly climbs up a vertical wall of mud and stone, with the officer giving chase. Charlie, however, finishes Bergman off by throwing a rock at him. In vain, he shoots, but it misses Charlie's head by a mile.\nA few seconds later, however, it seems Charlie is finished when a policeman stealthily creeps up to him. He steps on his hand, presumably to not let him escape, presumably as a reminder that his time is up. However, Charlie thinks it's a stray stone and covers it with mud. When he looks up and sees the officer, however, the chase resumes. With sheer athletic abilities and presence of mind, the Tramp eludes the officer. Charlie runs, and runs, and runs, and runs, and runs...and runs ker-plam! into a bunch of officers.\nCharlie runs all the way up to the top of the dusty cliff. Just when it seems like Charlie is free, another officer leaps in out of nowhere and shoots Charlie. However, the shot missed its mark, and Charlie, feigning death, fools the officer successfully. In the middle of the check-up to make sure the convict was dead, Charlie kicks him down the hill.\nHe takes the officer's hiding place (a very cleverly-masked hole in the rock) while Bergman and his companion come to that same spot looking for Charlie. Charlie sees them and makes a stealthy escape\u2014however, not stealthy enough to alert them at the last moment.\nCharlie comes through to the other end of the hole, grabs a police officer's gun, and uses this to threaten the police. All the while, he tiptoes backwards, and, unbeknownst to him, he's heading toward the deep seas. He, of course, trips against a stray rock and accidentally fires at Bergman. Luckily, the shot wasn't fatal, but it was painful enough to piss him off.\nHelpless, Charlie swims towards the deep seas. The policemen give chase with the help of a boat. Of course, they are unprepared for the high tide, and a huge wave knocks them over. Charlie swims over towards a boat where a man is desperately trying to take out his wet shirt.\nThe scene cuts towards a girl and her lover (Edna Purviance and Eric Campbell). They realize Edna's mother (Marta Golden) is drowning. They go over to help her. Edna begs Campbell to help, but he refuses because of his fatness. She jumps in, while Campbell leans against the fence and hawks at her. However, this man's sheer weight contributes to the fence giving away, and, of course, Campbell goes ker-plam! into the water.\nHearing the chaos ensuing between Campbell, Edna and her mother, Charlie, who had just found some dry land, decides to investigate. He jumps back into the water and swims over to where he thinks the chaos is taking place. He finds Edna on the shore, frantic, and Edna, seeing Charlie, begs him to save her mother. Charlie, instead of saving her mother, who was in dire need of help, swims towards Campbell instead, and swims circles around him.\nFinally, he takes his beard, and with the help of that he pulls him back to shore.\nHe rescues everybody else, and then lets them get warm. The authorities arrive, and Edna's unconscious mother is the first to go into the ambulance. However, she soon gains her consciousness, and Charlie serenades her with lies (\"I heard your shout from my yacht!\" \"I couldn't turn down two people shouting -- you, my lady, did not deserve drowning!\") and then heads back to rescue Campbell, in the process carelessly (and unintentionally) tossing him back into the water.\nWhen he discovers his blunder, he goes back and rescues the man. However, in the process of the rescue, Charlie hurts himself and lies down on the shore, helpless and unable to walk. He writhes and groans in pain helplessly. Luckily for him, however, a policeman saw him, called Edna, and rescues the injured Charlie.\nCharlie now wakes up in the house of Edna, the woman he loves. However, him wearing his striped prison uniform makes him think he is in prison, which is cleared when the butler enters with a towel. The scene then cuts to Charlie walking down the stairs with the glamorous party attire of the time, \"dressed in somebody's best\", according to the intertitle cards. The butler comes over with the drinks, and Charlie takes a glass, hands it to the butler, takes a beer bottle and pours the drink, initially on the floor.\nThen he tries to hand the butler his cigarette, and seeing a bewildered look on his face, waved at him to get out. Edna sees him, of course, and much to the rage of her lover, goes up to him. When he sees her, instinctively he goes into the \"attention\" position to greet her, which resulted in the open beer bottle to go upside-down, and the beer sloshing down.\nEdna and Charlie go to the balcony to socialize, where Charlie accidentally kicks Bergman. Bergman thinks it is intentional, however, and kicks him back. They go on kicking each other for a while, till a lady intervenes between Charlie and Bergman. Since Bergman and Charlie had their backs to each other, Bergman couldn't see the lady intervening. Therefore, he kicks her butt, thinking it's Charlie's he's kicked. He goes red when he realizes his blunder, but the damage is done\u2014Edna is disgusted at him, the victim weirded out, and Charlie feigns calmness and glares at him.\nInside, while Edna plays the piano, Bergman tries getting revenge but to no avail. Charlie sloshes a whole lot of beer on him, and he retreats. However, when he does, he sees Charlie's face on the newspaper, under the headline \"Criminal Escapes: Convict at Large\".\nOf course, this was a good way of getting revenge. Therefore, when Charlie talks away with Edna's dad, who was Judge Brown, the man who sentenced him to prison, Charlie is scared. But he acts calm, going under the alias \"Commodore\". However, at the worst possible moment, Bergman barges in, shoves \"Commodore\" out and tells him all about Charlie and his face in the newspaper, and how he was the escaped convict. When Charlie comes across the headline, he is scared stiff and nervous. As a last resort, he takes out his pen and draws a beard, so (hopefully) Judge Brown thinks he is Henry Bergman.\nOf course, Brown falls for the trap. When a determined Bergman stalks in with the judge, he grabs the paper and shows it to Brown. Of course, Brown thinks that this man has got it wrong, and shows it to Charlie. Charlie looks at the paper, and looks back at Bergman. \"You need a shave!\" he remarks, and goes back in to socialize\u2014not before kicking Bergman in the crotch, though!\nHe talks to everybody inside, trying to blend in after that near brush with Judge Brown. He talks to everybody, including Edna, and then decides to go to the kitchen with Edna.\nBut in the kitchen, a policeman and his wife are making love to each other, so when the knock sounds, the policeman hurriedly goes towards the closet. Charlie and Edna enter just as she is closing the door, so Charlie is secretly curious. He opens the closet, sees the policeman and, in an instant, closes the door and darts out of the room.\nWhat follows is a nerve-wracking chase with some slapstick overtures. Several times, Charlie comes close to getting caught. Several times, he survives by the skin of his teeth. And, in the end, one police officer corners him. It looks like the end, like Charlie will finally be apprehended\u2014until Charlie outwits him.

Soon the arrival of a beautiful young woman named Madge (Louise Granville) intensifies the animosity and tension between Brewer and his superior officer.\nMadge and her father, traveling to the West by stagecoach, are stopped not far from the army fort and are robbed and detained by bandits. A detachment of troopers led by Brewer quickly pursues the robbers, but unfortunately Madge's father is killed in the ensuing skirmish, although she is rescued by the lieutenant and taken to the fort for her safety. After his mission, Brewer receives a month-long furlough, and upon his return he finds Madge still at the outpost working as a servant and looking unkempt and neglected.
