She is involved with wealthy Abner Dillon, the show's \"angel\" (financial backer), but while she is busy keeping him both hooked and at arm's length, she is secretly seeing her old vaudeville partner, out-of-work Pat Denning.\nJulian Marsh is hired to direct, although his doctor warns that he risks his life if he continues in his high-pressure profession. Despite a long string of successes he's broke, a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash, so he must make his last show a hit, in order to have enough money to retire.\nCast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few \"casting couch\" innuendos flying around. Na\u00efve newcomer Peggy Sawyer, who arrives in New York from her home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is duped and ignored until two experienced chorines, Lorraine Fleming and Ann \"Anytime Annie\" Lowell, take her under their wing. Lorraine is assured a job because of her relationship with dance director Andy Lee; she also sees to it that Ann and Peggy are chosen. The show's juvenile lead, Billy Lawler, takes an immediate liking to Peggy (after her being tricked into bursting into his dressing room), as does Pat.\n\nWhen Marsh learns about Dorothy's relationship with Pat, he sends some thugs led by his gangster friend Slim Murphy to rough him up. That, plus her realization that their situation is unhealthy, makes Dorothy and Pat agree not to see each other for a while. He gets a stock job in Philadelphia.\nRehearsals continue for five weeks, to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the show's surprise opening in Philadelphia, when Dorothy breaks her ankle. By the next morning, Abner has quarreled with her and wants Marsh to replace her with his new girlfriend, Annie. Annie confesses in earnest that she can't carry the show, but convinces the director that the inexperienced Peggy can. With 200 jobs and his future riding on the outcome, a desperate Julian rehearses Peggy mercilessly until an hour before the premiere, vowing \"I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl.\"\nBilly finally gets up the nerve to tell Peggy he loves her. They embrace and kiss, just as Dorothy shows up and walks through the door.  Surprisingly, she wishes Peggy the best of luck and reveals that she and Pat are finally getting married. The show goes on to rousing applause. The last twenty minutes of the film are devoted to three Busby Berkeley production numbers: \"Shuffle Off to Buffalo\", \"(I'm) Young and Healthy\", and \"42nd Street\".\nThe show is a hit. As the theater audience comes out, Julian stands in the shadows outside the stage door, hearing comments that Peggy is the star and that he, the director, doesn't deserve the credit for the show's success.\nPlot noteIn the original Bradford Ropes novel, Julian and Billy are lovers. Since same-sex relationships were unacceptable in films by the moral standards of the era, the studio substituted a romance between Billy and Peggy. Although in one scene a gay innuendo is presented, as director Marsh puts his arm over choreographer Andy Lee's shoulder and asks if he has a date for the evening, who replies \"No.\" Immediately Marsh replies, \"Come on home with me will you? I'm lonesome.\"", "tmdb_id": 3062}, "35886865": {"title": "Ace of Aces (1933 film)", "plot": "When the United States enters World War I, Rocky Thorne has no interest in joining the military, but just wants to pursue his career as a sculptor.

But his fianc\u00e9e, Nancy Adams, becomes a Red Cross nurse; she mocks his pacifism and accuses him of cowardice. To prove his bravery, he enlists and becomes a fighter pilot as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. Arriving at his assigned squadron, he is concerned about the people he is going to be shooting at; but his initial reluctance lasts only until he is shot at himself.  Then he retaliates, shooting down his first enemy aircraft.\nRocky now renounces his past attitude and becomes completely committed to the war in the air, even taking individual flights against orders, to get more chances to shoot down Germans.  In a few months he becomes the leading ace. Then, while on furlough in Paris, he runs into his former love, who is a nurse on the front lines.  She has been impacted by her experiences and is torn by guilt.  When Rocky says that he does not want to waste his valuable leave time on talking and demeans her moral attitude for not wanting to spend the night with him, she agrees to do it.\nBack at the squadron, a German cadet on a mercy mission drops a note over the airfield, telling the Americans that one of their pilots who was shot down is alive as a prisoner.  At this point Rocky's plane appears. Not having seen the note being dropped, Rocky attacks and shoots down the young German, who is badly injured but not killed.\nAt the hospital, Rocky finds the German in the next bed.

There are major differences in their career success. Ann has a law degree, and goes to work at the law firm of retired Judge Bingham. On the other hand, Bill, who in college was a campus football star and voted \"Most Popular Man on Campus\", lands a low-level job in an architectural firm. She scores a sensational success with her first case (see below) and receives a check for $5000 from her rich client, Harrison. This sets the stage for marital problems, because the very same day that she gets the check for $5000, her husband receives notice of a big raise at work \u2014 $10.\nAnn quickly becomes a famous and wealthy lawyer, while her husband Bill continues to slog along as a low-level wage slave. The two realize, and discuss, the strain that the disparity in their incomes is placing on the marriage. They resolve to work harder at their marriage, but it immediately becomes clear that the demands of her job will make it difficult for Ann to tear herself from work. There is also a scene in which Ann resents the fact that Bill will not accompany her to a dinner party because he has to go to work. Eventually, disgusted with the paltriness of his income as compared to his wife's success, Bill quits his job as an architect and\u2014in hopes of hitting the big time as a singer\u2014becomes a \"crooner\" at the Mirador, a friend's nightclub.\nWhile working at the club, Bill begins to drink heavily and becomes involved with alcoholic female singer Carole Rodgers (Claire Dodd). In a scene at the Mirador, Ann and a group of friends observe Carole giving Bill a kiss. In fury, Ann throws a handful of change at Bill and stalks out. That seals the rupture in their marriage. Ann misses Bill deeply, and becomes distracted and starts to perform badly at work, but when she tries to contact Bill, Bill refuses to talk to her.\nCarole loses her job as a result of her drinking and apparently begins spending a lot of time with Bill in his apartment. One evening, while alone in Bill's apartment, Carole gets drunk, passes out, and falls and hits her head on the arm of a couch, which renders her even more unconscious. Her necklace (designed to look like a snake) gets caught on the arm of the couch and she strangles as she is slumped over the side of the couch. Eventually, the necklace slips loose and Carole's body falls to the floor. Much later, Bill comes in, drunk, after work. He sees Carole on the floor, thinks that she is merely drunk and passed-out on the floor, and himself falls into bed.\nIn the next scene we discover that Bill is on trial, accused of killing Carole. Ann knows that Bill must be innocent, and wants desperately to defend him. Judge Bingham warns Bill that his case looks very bad, but if he will allow Ann to defend him he will at least have the advantage of a passionately motivated defense attorney. Bingham persuades Bill to allow Ann to act as his defense attorney.\nThe prosecuting attorney's case is built on circumstantial evidence and his depiction of Bill's character. Key to the prosecution's case is its portrayal of Ann as a saintly (beautiful, talented, loving) and wronged wife, and of Bill as a playboy, drunk, and loafer who left his loving wife for a floozie, quit his job to live off of his wife's money, and gave up hard work to live a life of ease as a nightclub crooner.\nIn her speech to the jury, Ann first points out that it is highly unlikely that Bill killed Carole\u2014he had no motive for killing her. Then, from personal knowledge, she contests the prosecution's depictions of her as the saintly wronged party. Instead, she says, Bill was the wronged party. She had been obsessed over money and fame and drove him away.

Their plan is to be married in the city in a few weeks' time, once Gerald's mother arrives.  At the station, she is noticed by Jamil El Shehab (Ramon Novarro), a handsome good-natured Egyptian dragoman who enjoys romancing a bevy of women tourists, in exchange for a hoard of their jewelry as love tokens. Jamil is immediately captivated by Diana, but is rejected by Gerald when he offers them his services.  Undaunted, he snatches up her little laptog, Mitzi, when he sees she is unattended.  Back at the hotel, Powers, who asks if everyone in Egypt is a Shriner (their official headgear is the same fez, or tarboosh, worn by Egyptian men), is upset to find Diana's wedding regalia didn't travel well.  (Powers' role is that of comic relief, and her negative experiences with, and suspicion of, everything Egyptian is a running joke. Only the efficient Jamil meets with her approval.)  This is forgotten when Diana realizes Mitzi is missing, but her panic is alleviated when Jamil appears with her dog, claiming credit for saving her from being hit by a train. Diana initially plans to send him away with a tip, but when the attractive Jamil again suggests she hire him as her guide, Diana pleads with a reluctant Gerald to indulge her.\nBorn in Cairo of an Egyptian mother, but only now returning to it for the first time since she was a baby, Diana is apparently accepted by the British upper class despite her parentage.  She is dismissive when Gerald asks her if the country feels like home to her, laughingly asking him if he expects her to break into a snake dance.  She is not passionately in love with Gerald, and while they view the city from the hotel balcony, she gently rebuffs his attempts to present her with \"romance, poetry and all that sort of rot,\" telling him her desire is instead to have a \"civilized\" life with him, albeit one that will be regimented and strictly scheduled by his mother.  Jamil interrupts them and begins to serenade them with an Arabic song of love, while casting several sidelong glances at Diana that are returned. Much to Gerald's irritation, Diana quickly starts to fall under its spell.\nWhile touring the Pyramids at night, Jamil manages to separate Diana from the rest of the party by climbing one with her and leaving the others behind.  He then romances her with the same love song which everyone below, including an infuriated Gerald, can hear. The next morning when Jamil enters Diana's hotel bedroom under the pretext of returning Mitzi from her walk, he spies her in her lingerie, humming the same love song he sung to her the night before. When Jamil discloses he is not only a dragoman, but a prince of Egypt, Diana scoffs at the notion.  Meanwhile, Diana is also being wooed by Pasha Achmed, her fianc\u00e9's unscrupulous Egyptian business associate. In order to arrange to be alone with Diana, Pasha persuades Gerald to leave Cairo and inspect the aqueduct they are building together. When Jamil learns of the deception, he blackmails his countryman to remain silent about the reason for Gerald's absence.  Bringing Diana orchids sent by Pasha, he again enters her bedroom the following morning and scatters them on her as she sleeps.  Diana is outraged at this second intrusion, but when Pasha and Cecil knock at her bedroom door to announce they will wait outside for her while she dresses, she is even angrier at being forced not only to conceal Jamil's presence, but to have to ready herself while he makes personal comments. Jamil declares that if she were of his race she would know not to be offended, and that hers doesn't value the art of love. As he describes his hope that the man she chooses will recognize and inflame her romantic nature, Diana becomes increasingly agitated and distracted.  When Jamil kisses her in a moment of passion, Diana initially returns his kiss, then pushes him away, exclaiming \"A servant!\" at this affront.  She angrily dismisses him, even though she had previously refused to fire him when a jealous Gerald demanded it.  Jamil then leaves by the balcony, further infuriating Diana because she hadn't thought of it at the outset.\nDiana and Powers then set out on a caravan across the desert with a new guide.  Diana does not discover until nightfall that Jamil, undaunted by her rejection, has followed them and forced the new dragoman to leave, leaving her with no choice but to let him stay. Once again Jamil's romantic singing has its effect on Diana, but when he pulls her into his arms and kisses her again, she is outraged and strikes him with his own whip. Still believing him to be nothing more than a servant, she is taken aback at the uncharacteristic expression of anger on his face, then regains her composure and demands to return to Cairo immediately.  Jamil angrily organizes the caravan, but sends it, along with Powers, on a different route, leaving Diana to discover, too late, she is alone with Jamil on a longer, scenic, route.  Spying an oasis retreat, Diana abandons Jamil and rides toward it, where she is initially pleased to be treated lavishly by servants.  Newly bathed and dressed, she is taken to a private room, where she is horrified to see Jamil spraying the air with perfume. When she tries to flee, she finds all the exits locked. When Pasha unexpectedly enters, she greets him as a rescuer, unaware that the house is his.  He, in turn, assumes she is there for a tryst, since he received a message from Jamil asking him to meet her at his retreat. When Diana flatly denies it, Pasha confronts Jamil with what \"the white woman\" told him. Jamil assures him that all Occidental woman deny their true emotions, and that Diana paid him to bring her to Pasha. He then hands Pasha the same whip Diana struck him with and escorts him to her.  Jamil tries to ignore Diana's cries as Pasha forces himself on her, but when she cries out his name he hammers on the locked door until Pasha comes out.  Jamil confesses to Pasha that he really brought Diana to his home for food and shelter, and that he will need to be paid off before Pasha goes any further.  When Pasha leaves Jamil to fetch his price, Jamil escapes with Diana.  As they ride away, Jamil muses aloud, in a pleased manner, that she called for him. When Diana offers to pay him \u00a31,000 to return safely her to Gerald in Cairo, Jamil repeats it.\nPasha's guards soon catch up to them in the desert; in the ensuing fight, Jamil kills them but loses his horse. Surveying the guards' corpses in disgust, Jamil brusquely orders the barefooted and barely-dressed Diana off her horse and rides off, forcing her to catch up and walk alongside him. That night, at a desert oasis, he forces her to wait while he and the horse drink first. Weakened by thirst, hunger, and humiliation, Diana snatches his discarded dagger and hides it.  She again offers him everything she has to return her to Cairo safely, then threatens that he will pay for his actions if he doesn't. When Jamil picks up his whip, she recoils, but he assures her that he wouldn't whip her since it would mar her beauty. As he approaches her, Diana tries to defend herself with the dagger, but Jamil quickly disarms her, then rapes her. Soon afterwards, he quietly tells an unresponsive and tearstained Diana that they need to travel a good distance before the sun is high.  When she numbly prepares to walk next to the horse, he stops her and instead puts her up on it, while he leads them on foot. They arrive at his tribal village, where Jamil reveals his true identity is indeed that of a prince who worked as a humble dragoman as part of his royal training. When Jamil declares his love and proposes monogamous marriage to her, Diana passively accepts. But at the ceremony, she throws the water from their ceremonial cup in his face, humiliating him in front of his father and his tribe. Devastated by her rejection, Jamil furiously strikes her three times with his whip.  When Diana neither flinches nor takes her eyes off his face, Jamil cannot meet her gaze and looks away. He then tells her she is free and provides her with an escort to return safely to Cairo.\nThe escort flees when they encounter an army troop, along with Gerald and Cecil, that was dispatched to rescue Diana. Diana declares she wants Jamil dead to pay for what he has done, making it clear to Gerald that Jamil has violated her.  The army is sent to find and apprehend Jamil, dead or alive. On the day of the couple's wedding, Jamil is still at large.  Just before the ceremony, Diana's prospective mother-in-law asks Gerald just how far Diana's \"adventure\" went; he replies that he's trying to forget it and that he can't call off the wedding.  Mrs. Hume worries that Jamil's capture will result in a scandalous charge of rape against Gerald's soon-to-be wife, but her son assures her that usurping a caravan is piracy, and that charge alone will carry a death sentence. She then goes to dress Diana for her wedding, criticizing her servants, her departure from the traditional Hume bridal bouquet, and how she proposes to wear the family veil.  She goes on to speculate whether Diana really will be a worthy and responsible enough wife for her son, and advises her that she will have to curb her adventurous personality in order to fit in with the Hume family.  Even Powers makes a thoughtless remark about Diana's bridal virginity before she leaves to take her place downstairs.\nLeft alone, Diana is startled to hear the familiar song of love, and finds the fugitive Jamil on the balcony outside.  Jamil places his life in Diana's hands, offering his death as a wedding gift if she rejects him again. Diana tells him she doesn't want him dead, and as he hands Diana her bridal bouquet, Jamil tells her the choice is hers; she will be taken by another man, and he will be taken by the troops.  But as he takes her hand to kiss it in farewell he instead pulls her into a passionate kiss, which she returns. As Cecil, who has come to take her to Gerald, pounds on the locked bedroom door, Diana pleads with Jamil to flee, but he refuses to go without her. She tells him he is crazy, to which he responds that so is she, and that they are exactly alike. Realizing that she truly loves him, Diana escapes with Jamil on horseback into the night, as Powers thwarts the Humes' attempts to go after them. Some time later, as they drift down the Nile together on a felucca, Diana contentedly caresses Jamil's head in her lap as he hums his melody of love to her. When Diana asks him if he knows that her mother was an Egyptian, he blissfully tells her that he wouldn't care if she was Chinese.

Upon hearing of a Frenchman crossing the English Channel in a balloon, Peter regrets that he will not be able to see the marvels the future has in store.\nIn 1933, his descendant, also named Peter Standish, unexpectedly inherits a house in Berkeley Square, London. He becomes increasingly obsessed with his ancestor's diary, causing his fianc\u00e9e Marjorie Frant great concern. When they have tea with the American ambassador, Peter confides to the diplomat with eager anticipation his conviction that he will be transported back 149 years at 5:30 that day. Peter is convinced that all he needs to do is follow his ancestor's diary, since he already knows what happens, from reading it.\nHe rushes home, and just as he opens the door, he is indeed back in 1784, taking the place of the earlier Peter Standish just as he arrives at the house, then owned by his relations, the Pettigrews. Lady Ann and her grown offspring Tom, Kate, and Helen are there to greet him. The Pettigrews, being in desperate financial straits, are anxious for Kate to marry the wealthy American. Peter is determined not to alter the future he has read about, until he sees Helen for the first time. He tries to fight his attraction to her, but ultimately fails. Helen, meanwhile, is being pressed by her mother to marry Mr. Throstle, but Helen has determined, even before Peter's arrival, not to marry. She later confesses to Peter that she had been dreaming of him before she saw him.\nAs time goes on, Peter keeps inadvertently giving offense with his unfamiliarity with 18th century customs. People also begin to fear him, as he blunders and speaks of things which have not yet taken place. For example, when he commissions Sir Joshua Reynolds to paint his portrait, he praises another Reynolds work by name, one the painter has only just begun. Kate becomes convinced that Peter is demonically possessed and breaks their engagement. Helen, however, is sympathetic to his difficulties, and falls in love with him.\nHelen eventually presses Peter for an explanation of his \"second sight\", which he has only hinted at. Though he refuses to speak openly, she somehow sees in his eyes visions of his modern world, with all its horrors as well as its marvels, and guesses the truth. Knowing he has become disillusioned, living among ghosts born 149 years before his time, and desperately unhappy with the day-to-day realities of her era (including a lack of hygiene and plumbing, and not bathing regularly in what he calls a \"filthy little pigsty of a world\"), she urges him to return to his own time.

Popeye drinks the cup of whiskey. Bluto then draws a pistol and shoots it at a candle. Upon landing, the pieces of candle form into smaller candles. Challenging Popeye, Popeye eats the pistol. Then, using his mouth as a barrel, he shoots a deck and its columns, collapsing the deck to the floor. Bluto socks Popeye in the face, twisting his neck like a whirlybird.

The trophy bites the bandit on the rear end, while the bandit screams in pain. Popeye continues beating bandits. Bluto works his way to Olive's dressing room. Olive, thinking Popeye is at the door, allows Bluto in.

Popeye jumps back, and knocks Bluto's head several times. Then they both fall to the ground. They keep fighting until Bluto gets tired. Popeye gathers all his muscle and knocks Bluto so hard, it sends him into an orbit around the Earth.

The term itself is a play on the name Wurlitzer, as Wurlitzer pipe organs were regularly used in theaters of the time. Bosko leads the audience in the song \"We're in the Money\" (1933).The film then proceeds to parody newsreels. The newsreel depicted is called Out-Of-Tone News and the accompanying tagline Sees All, Hears All, Smells All. This was a reference to Movietone News, which had the slogan Sees all, Hears All, Knows All. Various scenes of world news appear. The first of them takes place in Geneva, Switzerland, where a peace conference is supposedly taking place. Actually the attending world leaders are depicted engaging in hand-to-hand combat, while a ring announcer gives a blow-by-blow description of the action. The following scene takes place in Malibu, California. A title card reports that it is supposedly about the Sunkist Bathing Beauties enjoying the sunshine of California. The scene then contradicts the card by depicting a single, unattractive woman on a beach during a snowstorm. She is attempting to evade a tidal wave. The next scene takes place in Reno, Nevada, where boxer \"Jack Dumpsey\" (Jack Dempsey) is reported training for a comeback. He is depicted as a withered old man with a cane. Followed by a scene taking place in \"Epsom Salts, England\", depicting a race among blue-blood dogs. The defending champion Bruno, Bosko's pet dog, is depicted sniffing around and trailing his competitors. Until he finds himself chased by the Marx Brothers, equipped as dog catchers.The final scene of the newsreel takes place in \"Pretzel, Germany\", where Fuehrer Adolf Hitler is depicted pursuing Jimmy Durante with an axe in hand. Hitler is depicted as a ruthless buffoon wearing lederhosen and a swastika armband, while the large-nosed Durante, an apparent nod to the Jewish nose stereotype, shouts, \"Am I mortified!\" The newsreel ends with the tagline It Squeaks for Itself, a reference to another slogan of Movietone News: It Speaks for Itself.The newsreel is followed by a short subject parodying Laurel and Hardy, who are called here \"Haurel and Lardy\", starring in \"Spite of Everything\". The two comedians are depicted finding a cooling pie on a window sill and stealing it. Then they argue over ownership of the pie. The pie switches hands many times, until Haurel ends their rivalry by pieing Lardy. In retaliation, Lardy uses a discarded pot to hit Haurel. The subject ends with Haurel crying.The last film of the show follows. It is a \"TNT Pictures\" production, its logo featuring a roaring (and burping) lion. This is a reference to Leo the Lion, the mascot of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film itself is a melodrama set in the 1890s, entitled \"He Done Her Dirt (and How!)\". Honey, Bosko's girlfriend, is depicted riding a bicycle. She is followed by the Marx Brothers, who sing Daisy Bell (Bicycle Built for Two) (1892).

They eventually become friends of a sort, but Henry realizes that the war is taking a toll on Jerry.\nAfter an enemy raid on his base, the commanding officer, Major Dunham (Guy Standing) sees what is happening to his best pilot, and orders Jerry to go to London on leave after Crocker tells him that Jerry is cracking up. Meeting a young woman (Carole Lombard), Jerry carries on a brief affair, before being sent back to the front. With Jerry away, Henry flies a mission with Mike that ends with the pilot's death because Henry persuaded him to go back for another pass at an enemy. Jerry blames his friend and asks for a different air observer. On his first mission with Jerry, the new recruit, Lt. John Stevens (Kenneth Howell) is shot and then falls out of the airplane during inverted flight during a dogfight with Voss (Robert Seiter), a famous German ace.  He has no parachute and falls to the ground.  Jerry then shoots down Voss in a head-on pass.  Jerry lands near Voss' crashed airplane and sees that the dead Voss is a young man.  Stevens' death and the killing of the young German are the last straw for Jerry, who kills himself in his and Crocker's quarters after attending a drinking party in honor of his killing Voss. Crocker finds Jerry dead later that night, and hides the fact that Jerry is dead from the Colonel, who visits to check on Jerry.\nTo preserve his friend's reputation, Crocker loads Jerry's body into an aircraft early the next morning and flies toward the front lines, where Crocker stages things to make it appear that Jerry died in aerial combat.

When Lady Helen mistakenly believes he has proposed to her, he hastily returns to London with his valet Henry Leek. After Leek dies soon after of pneumonia, the attending doctor mistakes him for Priam and informs the press. The real Priam is glad to be mistaken for his valet by everyone, even his cousin Duncan (who has not seen him since he was 12). After several attempts to clear up the misidentification, he gives up.\nHe goes to a hotel, where he meets Alice Chalice, who was put in touch with Leek through The Matrimonial Times and, by chance, was to meet Leek for the first time there. Leek had sent her a photograph of him and Priam together, so she makes the same mistake. Priam finds her very pleasant to be with. He has qualms when he learns that \"he\" is to be accorded the great honor of being interred in Westminster Abbey, but once again he is unable to convince anyone, including Alice, that he is the painter.\nHe is happy to marry Alice and live a quiet country life. Then Alice's income from brewery shares disappears, along with the brewery, but Priam assures her that he can provide for her by selling some of his paintings. She is skeptical, however. Nonetheless, she sells some of his paintings, mainly for the frames. One painting passes through several hands and ends up with Oxford, Priam's old agent, who recognizes the artist's style. Oxford buys all of Priam's new paintings and resells them, guaranteeing that they are genuine Farrels.\nOxford tracks Priam down and asks him to reveal he is still alive. It turns out that one of the paintings Oxford sold had a date on the back, 1932, two years after Priam's \"death\", and the buyer has taken Oxford to court. Priam strenuously refuses, so Oxford takes another approach, placing an advertisement asking for information about Henry Leek.\nLeek's widow shows up, accompanied by her clergymen sons John and Henry. Her husband deserted her about 25 years before after the birth of their twin sons. She identifies Priam as him. Priam bolts at the first opportunity, but Alice is more than up to the challenge. She portrays her \"Henry\" as violent and not entirely sane and points out that there would be a scandal. The Leeks hastily depart.\nEven so, Priam is brought into court. In the course of testimony, his cousin Duncan recalls that he has two moles on his neck. Priam stubbornly refuses to show them, but Alice convinces him to do so.

Later, the innkeeper, Mr. Hall, is sent by his wife to evict the stranger after he has made a huge mess in his room while doing research and has fallen behind on his rent. Angered, the stranger throws Mr. Hall down the stairs. Confronted by a policeman and some local civilians, he removes his bandages and goggles, revealing he is invisible. Laughing maniacally, he takes off his clothes, making himself completely undetectable, and drives off his tormentors before fleeing into the countryside.\nThe stranger is Dr. Jack Griffin, a chemist who discovered the secret of invisibility while conducting a series of tests involving an obscure drug called monocane. Flora Cranley, Griffin's fianc\u00e9e and the daughter of Griffin's employer, Dr. Cranley, becomes distraught over Griffin's long absence. Cranley and his other assistant, Dr. Kemp, search Griffin's empty laboratory, finding only a single note in a cupboard. Cranley becomes concerned when he reads it. The note has a list of chemicals, including monocane, which Cranley knows is extremely dangerous; an injection of it drove a dog mad in Germany. Griffin, it seems, is unaware of this. Cranley deduces Griffin may have learned about monocane in English books printed before the incident that describe only its bleaching power.\nOn the evening of his escape from the inn, Griffin turns up at Kemp's home. He forces Kemp to become his visible partner in a plot to dominate the world through a reign of terror, beginning with \"a few murders here and there\". They drive back to the inn to retrieve his notebooks on the invisibility process. Sneaking inside, Griffin finds a police inquiry underway, conducted by an official who believes it is all a hoax. After securing his books, Griffin angrily attacks and kills the officer.\nBack home, Kemp calls Cranley, asking for help, and then the police. Flora persuades her father to let her come along. In her presence, Griffin becomes more placid and calls her \"darling\". When he realizes Kemp has betrayed him, his first reaction is to get Flora away from danger. After promising Kemp that at 10 o'clock the next night he will murder him, Griffin escapes and goes on a killing spree. He causes the derailment of a train, resulting in a hundred deaths, and throws two volunteer searchers off a cliff. The police offer a reward for anyone who can think of a way to catch him.\nFeeling that Griffin will try to fulfill his promise, the chief detective in charge of the search uses Kemp as bait and devises various clever traps. At Kemp's insistence, the police disguise him in a police uniform and let him drive his car away from his house. Griffin, however, is hiding in the back seat of the car, as surprises Kemp and tells that he was also following him all day while committing his crimes. He overpowers Kemp and ties him up in the front seat. Griffin then sends the car down a steep hill and over a cliff where it explodes on impact, killing Kemp.\nA snowstorm forces Griffin to seek shelter in a barn where he falls asleep. Later a farmer enters and spots movement in the hay where Griffin is sleeping. He notifies the police, who rush out to the farm and surround the barn.

He rampages through the city as Ann screams in his grasp; wrecking a crowded elevated train and eventually climbing the Empire State Building. At its top, he is attacked by four biplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He gazes at Ann one last time before falling to his death. Jack takes an elevator to the top of the building and reunites with Ann. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, \"No, it wasn't the airplanes.

Rita is a diva, high-handed and self-absorbed, with an alcohol problem as well, but she's under verbal contract to Easton. She shamelessly flirts as she negotiates a deal; she'll accept a small role (which she doesn't want) in the upcoming play, for one big concession: her pick of roles in the next production. The principals are taking a risk that she'll contain her artistic temperament and lay off the bottle. Even so, her name and fame will help launch the play, a new comedy by Joseph Sheridan (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.)\nMeanwhile, Eva meets and impresses Robert Hedges (C. Aubrey Smith), an experienced character actor also under contract to Easton. Delighted with her childlike ebullience, Hedges agrees to help her. He takes Eva into the office and introduces her as his protegee.  Sheridan, there to cast his upcoming comedy production, is also immediately struck by Eva's vivacious and eccentric personality, A non-stop talker, Eva bubbles over with intensity about her small-town New England background and her belief in non-conformity and self-realization. She declares that after a long and successful career, she'll kill herself onstage as a dramatic farewell to her fans. Sheridan is entranced, but Easton is not. \nMonths pass. Hedges has lost touch with Eva. She frequently moves due to poor finances and hasn't been cast in meaningful roles. Hedges finds her struggling and hungry. Eva expresses regret that Easton gave her a small role in one of his lesser plays, which flopped. She bravely declares she won't take any more offers, unless the role truly suits her abilities. Realizing her situation, Hodges escorts her to a celebrity party at Easton's apartment. Eva quickly downs two glasses of champagne on an empty stomach. Inebriated, Eva sits on the arm of Easton's chair, stroking his face and vowing to prove her dramatic talents to him. She makes a spectacle of herself before the bemused party guests. Then unexpectedly she gives two Shakespearean orations, Hamlet's well-known monologue (\"to be or not to be\") followed by Juliet's balcony scene. The difference in the roles demonstrates her art; she gets a polite ovation from the guests and further impresses Sheridan. She lays her head on Easton's lap and promptly falls asleep. His butler put her to bed in his own bedroom.\nThe next morning, Easton asks Sheridan for help. Easton gave in to temptation and explains the encounter through innuendo. He's remorseful at taking advantage of a girl's innocence and can't face her. Sheridan is devastated to learn the overnight guest was Eva. Easton apologizes and leaves. A radiant Eva comes downstairs and sees Sheridan whom she regards as \"just a friend\". Happily, she tells him everything. To her, the night with Easton is the beginning of a long commitment. Sheridan can't bring himself to break her heart. He lets her leave without explaining.\nMore months pass. Eva has tried numerous times to see Easton. Unwilling to face her, Easton has simply ignored her. Sheridan keeps his own love a secret. Easton's theater company is ready to showcase Sheridan's new dramatic masterpiece. The play will star Rita Vernon. Sheridan approves of her performance in rehearsals. Backstage on opening night, Rita calls Easton into her dressing room. Heretofore she and Easton have had only verbal agreements. Aware of the power she holds at this late hour, Rita now has demands. She wants a written contract with a huge salary increase and half the profits from the entire run of the play. Easton thinks he has no choice but to comply. Sheridan draws him and urges him to let Rita go. Instead, they can bring in a special understudy, one he's kept secret until now -- Eva Lovelace. Easton reluctantly agrees and Rita storms off the set.\nEva and Joseph end up together in the star's dressing room. Faced with this sudden opportunity, Eva seems overcome with doubt and fear. She can't perform with Easton in the audience; they haven't spoken since their night together. She feels unsure of her talents and feels doomed to failure.  Sheridan reassures her that she can handle whatever is thrown at her. She's strong and beautiful, a born actress who can now prove it. Eva rallies, gathers her self-confidence, and resolves to conquer the role.\nAs Sheridan predicted, Eva is a complete success. Backstage, Easton reconciles with Eva, offering her his professional friendship and aid. When he goes, Sheridan gathers the courage to declare his love for Eva.

Florence goes to watch the autopsy, but the body cannot be found, and then visits Winton in jail, believing his protestations of innocence.\nIgor is preparing to open a new wax museum. Due to injuries sustained in the fire, he uses a wheelchair and must rely on assistants to create his new sculptures. One of those assistants, Ralph, is engaged to Florence's roommate, Charlotte Duncan, but Florence does not approve of the match because Ralph is a starving artist. While visiting the museum, Florence notices an uncanny resemblance between the wax figure of Joan of Arc and Joan Gale. At the same time, Igor spots Charlotte and, saying she looks just like his Marie Antoinette, asks if she will pose for him sometime.\nFlorence gets Winton, who was released from jail, to help her trail Professor Darcy, who Igor said made the Joan of Arc. Darcy leads them to a derelict building owned by Worth, for whom he also works. Florence sneaks into the basement and watches the monster from the morgue pushing a large crate. She returns to Winton and interrupts a conversation with two detectives who have been following him to say she has found Joan Gale's body. The detectives see Darcy leaving and call for help to both give chase and investigate Florence's claim. They catch Darcy, but the crate turns out to contain alcohol, as Worth is a bootlegger.\nAt the police station, a missing judge's pocket watch is found on Darcy. By the morning, he is experiencing symptoms of drug withdrawal and close to cracking. Meanwhile, Charlotte goes to see Ralph at the museum, but he is not there yet, and Igor lures her to his underground laboratory, where he reveals he can walk. Ralph arrives for work and lets in Florence, who compares a picture of the missing judge with Igor's statue of Voltaire at the same time Darcy is telling the detectives that Igor made his new statues by murdering people and covering them in wax, while all he did for Igor was locate Worth.\nCharlotte strikes Igor's face and breaks through a wax mask to his terribly scarred true visage underneath, revealing he is the monstrous bodysnatcher. He says his search for the man responsible for his appearance is finally over and uncovers Worth's corpse. Charlotte's screams attract Ralph and Florence, but Igor knocks Ralph unconscious and Florence runs away. Igor prepares to douse Charlotte with wax. Florence and Winton return, followed by police, who attack a surprisingly athletic Igor. One of the officers shoots him, and he falls into his giant vat of molten wax. Ralph comes to and saves Charlotte just before the wax begins to pour onto her.\nAfter turning in her story, Florence goes to gloat to Jim, and he asks her to marry him.

Oliver, however, realizes that Bascom and Wallace, who now claims to be a fast-thinking burglar himself, were in league to turn in Oliver to collect a \u00a310,000 reward for the Solitaire Man.

Helen notices that Wallace's pocket watch has a broken chain, and Oliver accuses Wallace of being the murderer of the dead inspector.

So Denham and Englehorn agree to go back to the island to find the treasure. Later, Denham meets Hilda while she is trying to recapture her monkeys and tries to cheer her up. Despite her pleas for her safety, Denham refuses to take her with him when he leaves Dakang. However, shortly after the ship leaves out to sea, Hilda is found having stowed away on board.\nHelstrom talks Hilda into silence, then incites a mutiny on board the Venture, but the sailors want no more captains and force him along with Denham, Englehorn, Hilda, and Charlie the cook away in a lifeboat. The group soon land on Skull Island and discover that the natives now blame Denham for Kong's destruction in their village, forcing them to retreat and into the interior of the island, where they split up into two groups. Denham and Hilda soon encounter a giant albino gorilla, smaller than Kong,  but still over twice the height of a man. The giant ape is stuck in quicksand, so Denham helps him out of it and bandages the ape's injured finger, establishing trust with the ape. Denham tells Hilda that he believes the ape is Kong's son, and names him \"Little Kong\". Later, Englehorn, Charlie, and Helstrom are attacked by a Styracosaurus which chases them into a cave. Denham and Hilda are attacked by a giant cave bear, but \"Little Kong\" fights it and forces it away.  Helstrom had actually made up his treasure-story to get a free ride away from Dakang, but with the ape's help, Denham and Hilda find a real treasure- a huge jewel on the head of a seemingly abandoned giant stone idol, which he takes for safe-keeping. Little Kong, Denham, and Hilda are attacked by a Nothosaurus, but \"Little Kong\" fights and kills it. A storm ensues and Helstrom tries to escape in the lifeboat, but is killed by an Elasmosaurus. Englehorn, Hilda and Charlie quickly retrieve and board the lifeboat, but a violent earthquake and hurricane strikes the island, and it begins to sink into the ocean. The water soon surrounds Denham and \"Little Kong\" atop a tall mound, and as the ape's foot gets stuck in the cracking mound, he sacrifices himself to save Denham by holding him above the water. The group in the boat reach Denham just in time, as the ape's hand, with Denham's bandage still on his finger, sinks below. On the deck of a rescue ship, Denham and Hilda contemplate the tragic fate of Kong's son, and of their future together, but Denham shows Hilda the jewel he salvaged, assuring her that it will provide financial security for all of them. It was Denham's intention to split the fortune four ways (Denham, Hilda, Englehorn and Charlie), but Hilda convinces him that three ways is just fine, indicating that she is throwing her fortunes in with Denham for the long haul.", "tmdb_id": 43149}, "18589655": {"title": "The Song of Songs (1933 film)", "plot": "Once in Berlin, Lily meets and poses for Richard, the sculptor who lives across the street.

However, Minnie does not love the prince at all and slaps him in the face three times in rejection.

Mickey gets to the window of her cell via a catapulted bird's nest, but realizes that there isn't a rope to climb down from the window.

His only true friends are the zoo's animals, and indeed Zani has been chastised by his boss for being too nice to them. His dad was one of the finest caretakers of the animals, but unfortunately passed away early in Zani's life, and for his mother who died at childbirth, so Zani was raised with the animals that became his only friends. You also meet the other main character Eve (Loretta Young) a young and beautiful orphan girl. Eve must somehow escape from her strict orphan school, since she is faced with the prospect of being forced to work as an indentured servant (more like a slave) until she grows up.\nAt the beginning you get to meet and see a lot of the different animals that live at the zoo, and how people react to them. You meet a little boy named Paul, played by Wally Albright, who is with his harsh governess and all he wants to do is interact with the animals but he never gets the chance too. As you keep wondering throughout the zoo you meet Dr. Grunbaum, who is looking at a sick monkey. A woman then comes into the office of the zoo and says that her skunk fur has been stolen, and apparently hers isn't the first to go missing. She threatens to ruin the place if it is not found. The Dr. sends for Zani, who is playing with the lion cubs, and the officers escort him through the zoo where he spots the orphan girls that had come to the zoo, and these girls are all whispering to each other that Zani is there. Zani makes it back to the Dr's. office where they end up bonding over his father and Zani admits that he stole the furs. Dr. Grunbaum tries to punish him but he can't as Zani has headed out the door toward the orphan girls that just walked by. The Dr. assures the officer that he will not do it again.\nAs Zani gets closer to the girls he lets out a whistle tune and the girls automatically recognize its his. The girls move along to look at the ostriches, as the head of the orphanage reads a fact booklet to them. While the girls are walking though they start talking to Eve about if she wants to escape now would be the chance, but there is one girl that is strictly advising her against it and warns her of what could happen if she went through with it and got caught. Since Eve is 18 as of yesterday this might be her only chance to leave. They keep walking around the zoo when they come across the lions and Zani is standing in between them and the cage. Zani starts talking to the lion, but it is directed at Eve telling the lion to think of all the fun you could have if you were free, and that you just have to take that chance. After missing her first window to escape the girls send a signal to the girl at the front by touching the arm of the one in front of her. Once receiving that message the girl jumps over the railing and into the pond giving Eve the distraction she needed to escape. The girls around her give Eve different clothes and she runs off into the bushes.\nAfter all of this Zani overhears a couple talking about wanting to buy the fox at the zoo so the wife can turn it into a muff. This angers Zani greatly and the first chance he gets shortly there after he steals the woman's fur. The woman and the man go to the office to report that her fur has been stolen, and immediately the officers and the Dr. know who did it.\nAfter that realization you turn your attention back to Paul the little boy with his governess who escapes while getting on the bus all the while his governess is pre-occupied. You go straight back to the head of the Orphanage who is realizing as she counts that there is one missing, and that one would be Eve. Then you go back to the governess who realizes that the boy is missing and she alerts an officer who go's to look for him. You see the boy run away and back into the zoo another way, and the officers close up the gates to get in, but the head of the Orphanage informs them that there is still someone in there that is lost, but they assure her that everyone is out. She tells the officers that if they do find anyone in there to come get her immediately so she can grab Eve herself.\nGoing back to the stolen fur Dr. Grunbaum realizes that he has no choice but to turn Zani in. You then see Zani offering to help search for Eve. He eventually finds her in the bushes, but informs the officer that there's no one there, so he turns around and leaves. That is when Eve changes out of her uniform into normal clothes. After leading the officer astray Zani goes back to Eve and you find out they've cared for each other this entire time and the whistles were to let the other know they were near. They sit there for a while talking and eventually they kiss before heading off in a direction Zani knows they wont be caught. He takes her to an old bear den, that has a hole in it where you can look and see a view of the city. Leaving Eve alone to gather food for her you come to find out that the officers, who have all gathered at the zoo dinner, are all looking for either Zani, Paul, or Eve. Not being able to resist Zani enter the hospital and immediately jumps into action thinking of what they're going to do save the monkey the Dr. is trying to save and without a second though Zani goes and gets the solution of bringing in Maria who is the other monkey in the cage. He ends up saving the animal and Dr. Grunbaum temporarily forgets that he's having Zani arrested.\nOn Zani's way back to the den he picks up Mimi the monkey and takes her with him. When he gets there Eve is upset and is wondering what is going to happen tomorrow. and Zani is trying his best to comfort her. Meanwhile Paul's parents are worried and want to know where their son is, and a lot of officers have now arrived to look for these three. Back at the den you find out that Eve ran away for Zani and that Zani wanted her to run away for him. Eve says she thought they'd get married, and this takes Zani aback but realizing that hurt Eve when he did that he asks what they would do if that happened. She says that they would get a house somewhere just like others. After having a moment of happiness Eve find Paul hiding and crying near the den, because he thinks since he ran away he's gong to jail.\nOne of the other zookeepers finds the three in the den and Zani runs after him, but shortly after he starts running away from the officers. Zani gets caught and you realize that the other zookeeper is trying to have his way with Eve since Zani is gone, but Zani hears Eve's screams and escapes to run after her. He fights the other zookeeper off of Eve. Paul escapes and keeps running until he gets to an area where there is a strange man locked in a cage, because he was put earlier that night by one of the zookeepers. The strange man has Paul go and get the key and get him out of the cage but Paul accidentally does the wrong cage and lets loose the tiger. All the sudden with the tiger leaping around getting mad at the other animals making them excited all of the animals break out of their cage and start fighting with one another. This makes the little boy start to sob, someone hears him and they recognize it coming from the tiger, lion, and elephant area.\nIn a resourceful move Zani lowers himself to where Paul is so he can snatch him up and get him out of harms way, but after grabbing him one of the animals grabs hold of Zani's leg and he is left very injured. After getting the help of some hoses and a very smart elephant the Dr. gets the animals back into their cages. As Zani is getting taken away to the hospital Paul's father comes up to him and says thank you, and if there is anything I can do let me know. Zani then replies that he doesn't want the orphanage to take Eve away.\nYou fast forward a little bit and Paul's father, Mr. Vandor, played by Niles Welch, is at the orphanage arranging with the head that Eve is under his protection for the next five years, but it's not going to matter because she is marrying Zani tomorrow and they will live on his estate and Zani will look after his animals. The last shot you see is of Eve and Zani riding a horse and saying that they are home and they are just like the others.", "tmdb_id": 122709}}
