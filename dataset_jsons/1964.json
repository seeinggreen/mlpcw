Wealthy rancher Clinton Stark has inside information that a railroad is coming to town and plans to buy the entire town while the land is cheap. Stark arrives at the newspaper offices to confront Cunningham about a recent editorial in opposition to Stark's plan.

On his return, Ferris meets Trumpey's daughter Candace. Trumpey has returned to Malaya as High Commissioner of the United Kingdom for Malaya.

Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Vi\u00f1olas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.\nMeanwhile, Vi\u00f1olas has learned that Artiguez's mother (Mildred Dunnock) is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Mart\u00edn to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, some of who collaborated with Francoist Spain, both during and after the war. In return for information about the layout of the hospital and surrounding area, Paco tells Artiguez to \"bump into Vi\u00f1olas\" for him.\nA priest (Omar Sharif) visits with Artiguez's mother, who initially refuses to speak to him, but his kindness and sincerity win her over enough to ask him to warn her son not to come to see her, as she knows the Guard will be waiting for him. After Vi\u00f1olas has laid his trap, Artiguez's mother dies, but Vi\u00f1olas sends a spy to convince Artiguez otherwise, and to come visit her. When the priest appears at Artiguez's house, he's gone, so the priest tells Paco to pass on the message that Artiguez's mother is already dead, and not to go to San Mart\u00edn. The priest also gives Paco a letter to warn Artiguez that he saw a collaborator at the Guard headquarters.\nPaco flushes the letter down the toilet and doesn't pass on the verbal message because he feels sure the priest must be lying. Afterwards, Paco recognizes the man (Carlos) in Artiguez's house as the informer, and tells Artiguez about the priest's message. Pedro believes the boy, but Artiguez can't believe his friend Carlos would betray him. Trying to clear up the mess, Artiguez takes Paco and Carlos to Lourdes to find the priest. But the priest was delayed on the way, and since he's not there, they let Carlos go. On the way back, however, they see the priest, and forcibly take him to Artiguez's house. When Carlos returns to Artiguez's house for his rucksack, Artiguez asks the priest to come out. Carlos, knowing he is exposed, attacks Artiguez and escapes.\nThe priest tries to overcome Artiguez's antipathy for all clergy and Artiguez confesses that he knew all along that his mother was sick but didn't visit her before her death because he is no longer as brave as he was in his youth. Embarrassed by admitting his vulnerability, Artiguez allows the priest to go free and, after much internal debate, he decides to go to San Mart\u00edn anyway, presumably with the mission of killing Vi\u00f1olas. Once in San Mart\u00edn, Artiguez encounters a Francoist sniper on the roof of the hospital and attacks him, sending him to his death. Picking up the sniper's rifle he sees Carlos the informer (who is with the police in a nearby building) looking out a window to see what has caused the commotion ; Artiguez pauses briefly then shoots Carlos, killing him.  Once inside the hospital, he kills a few officers, but is finally shot.\nSoldiers and officers congratulate Vi\u00f1olas on at last killing his enemy, but he asks one of his lieutenants, knowing his mother was already dead and a trap would be waiting for him, why did Artiguez come back? The final shot is of the morgue, with the soldiers Artiguez killed and Artiguez himself (and his dead mother), wheeled in on gurneys and arranged in a row, dead.", "tmdb_plot": "Manuel Artiguez, a famous bandit during the Spanish civil war, has lived in French exile for 20 years.

He is a ruthless opportunist, willing to go to any lengths to get the nomination. Neither man can stand the other; neither believes his rival qualified to be president. At the nominating convention in Los Angeles, they lobby for the crucial support of dying former President Art Hockstader (Tracy).

He looks at a framed display of war medals on the wall and seems about to cry. He shuts off the record player, but as he leaves the room, he hears the record start to play again of its own accord, despite the player being shut off. Downstairs, he meets a visitor, his nephew Fred (Gazzara). Grudge caustically notes that Fred always comes to him for help with various causes and asks what cause he is promoting this time. Fred complains that Grudge used his influence to cancel a cultural exchange program that Fred's university had planned with a Polish counterpart. In the ensuing argument with Fred, Grudge takes the isolationist position that the United States should stay out of international affairs and not participate in cultural exchange programs, foreign aid to the needy, or discussions at the United Nations. Grudge distrusts foreign countries, and contends that the U.S. should build up its arsenal, including nuclear weapons, and make sure other countries know the U.S. is willing to use them. Fred disagrees, arguing that the U.S. should help all people in need and foster international communication in order to avoid future wars and nuclear destruction. As Fred leaves, he reminds his uncle that they have one thing in common: their love for Grudge's son Marley, who was killed in World War II on Christmas Eve 1944.\nAfter Fred leaves, Grudge once again hears the record playing upstairs, and sees a short vision of the deceased Marley sitting at the dining room table. Suddenly, Grudge finds himself on the deck of a fogbound troopship carrying coffins draped in flags, guarded by soldiers at attention. A soldier on board introduces himself as the Ghost of Christmas Past (Lawrence) and explains that the ship is carrying the dead of all nations from World War I; through the fog, Grudge spots a second vessel carrying World War II's dead, and learns they are in a huge convoy, carrying the dead from conflicts through history. The Ghost suggests that the way to stop the killing is to spend more time talking, since when talking stops, fighting starts. He and Grudge revisit a scene from Grudge's past in which Grudge, a Navy commander, accompanied by his WAVE driver (Saint), visited a hospital in devastated Hiroshima and saw Japanese schoolchildren whose faces had been destroyed by the atom bomb.\nGrudge walks through a door and meets the Ghost of Christmas Present (Hingle), who is feasting on an excessively large Christmas dinner on Grudge's dining table. This new Ghost turns on a light and shows Grudge that next to the dining room is an internment camp full of displaced persons from different nations who are poor, hungry, and lacking adequate shelter. These people search through the snow for food as the Ghost eats in front of them. When Grudge criticizes the Ghost for this behavior, the Ghost reminds Grudge of his earlier statement to Fred that refusing donations to the needy would make them less needy and more self-reliant. The Ghost harangues Grudge with statistics and information about needy people in the world and finally in a fit of anger pulls the tablecloth, dumping huge amounts of leftover food on the floor. Grudge cannot stand any more and runs away into the dark.\nGrudge emerges into destroyed ruins that he recognizes as having been his local town hall, where he encounters the Ghost of Christmas Future (Shaw). This Ghost explains that the town hall was wrecked in a disastrous nuclear conflict that killed most of the world's people. A handful of survivors enter, led by a demagogue called \"Imperial Me\" (Sellers) who wears a Pilgrim suit and a cowboy hat cut into a crown. The crowd cheers as Imperial Me is paraded in and gives a speech exhorting each person to act as an individual in their own self-interest. Grudge watches his butler, Charles (Rodriguez), try unsuccessfully to convince the crowd that acting collectively for the greater good of all is essential for humanity's survival. Imperial Me and the crowd mock Charles as crazy and beat him. Finally Imperial Me has Charles brought forward and charges him with treason. Charles tries to escape but is shot dead by a little boy in a cowboy outfit. Grudge's cook Ruby (Teer) weeps over Charles' body, while the crowd, led by Imperial Me, enthusiastically prepares to first kill the people across the river who had approached them wanting to talk, and then kill off each other until only one person is left. An agitated Grudge asks the Ghost if this is the world \"as it must be, or as it might be\", but the Ghost simply leaves without answering.\nA shaken Grudge awakens back in the real world on Christmas morning, on the floor of his intact study with the phone in his hand. His nephew Fred appears and says that Grudge called him at 3 a.m. and asked him to stop by on his way to church. Grudge apologizes to Fred for his statements of the previous evening and, without explaining the reason for his change of heart, indicates cautious support for the United Nations and international diplomacy as a way to prevent future wars.

He has successfully toured the United States for more than a decade. Now that the century is about to turn, he wants to take his show to Europe.\nHis Circus Boss, Cap Carson (Lloyd Nolan), is against taking the show across the Atlantic. He maintains that Europe is bad luck for American circuses.  He also calls Matt on his reason for making a European tour: Masters wants to find the lost great love of his life, Lili Alfredo (Rita Hayworth), and figures that this tour will smoke her out if for no other reason than to see her child, Toni Alfredo (Claudia Cardinale), Masters' adopted daughter. One of his Western stars and wannabe-partner, Steve McCabe (John Smith), also attempts to dissuade Masters, but to no avail. Masters buys a freighter, renames her the Circus Maximus, and the show sails for Europe.\nAt Barcelona, the first port of call, the Circus Maximus capsizes at the pier and puts the show out of action. Masters has to release most of his performers, board out his animals, and go back to performing an act for the Ed Purdy Wild West Show, a staple on the European circus circuit. Down but not out, Masters doesn't waste the disaster. \"While touring Europe at Ed Purdy's expense,\" as Masters puts it, he, Cap, Steve and Toni scout acts that will enable Masters to relaunch the Matt Masters Circus bigger and better than ever.\nHis first new hire is Tojo the Clown and the Wire-Dancing Ballerina (Richard Conte and Katharyna respectively). They have a unique act; Tojo is dressed as a clown but walks the high wire over a cage full of lions while coaching the Ballerina (his niece Giovanna) as she dances on a wire on the ground. Backstage, Masters discovers that Tojo is an old acquaintance \u2014 Aldo Alfredo, brother-in-law of his lost love Lili Alfredo. Despite his reservations at hiring a possible enemy Masters takes the act on and neither he nor Aldo admit to Toni, who is Aldo's niece, that they have met before; or that Tojo the Clown is her uncle. Aldo assures Matt that the vendetta is over, and Giovanna begins training for the ballerina act she will perform on the high wire.\nHis second new act is Emile Schumann, a French animal trainer who has a spectacular act involving lions who lie down on him in the ring. Masters offers to take him on if he will switch from lions to tigers (Masters has many tigers but few lions). The trainer is adamant that he does not want to change to working with tigers; his wife persuades him to do so. By the time the circus is ready to re-launch, Emile has so adapted to working with a different variety of big cat that when a couple become ill,  he demands that Masters hire a doctor for \"HIS tigers.\"\nThe third addition to the performers' roster is Margo Angeli, an artist of the high trapeze, coincidentally where Toni wants to work instead of in the Wild West show or as part of Clown Alley, where Matt has her working. In reality, Margo is the vanished Lili Alfredo, haunted by the guilt of having been caught up in a love triangle, blaming herself for the death of her flyer husband who had fallen \u2014 or did he miss Aldo's catch on purpose after learning he was part of a love triangle? She had run away from the world of the circus and kept on running, finding solace first in the Church and then in the bottle.\nAs Masters had hoped it would, the lure of her daughter brings Lili out of hiding. She speaks to her daughter during a performance of Ed Purdy's Wild West Show without identifying herself, and Masters spots her. The two have an intense confrontation in a bar, ending with Masters slamming a full bottle of brandy down in front of Lili and telling her that she needs to decide whether the booze or her child is more important to her; but that if she doesn't pull herself together, as far as he's concerned she is dead to him. Lili quits drinking and goes into training to seek a position in the new Matt Masters Circus, then in winter quarters near Madrid.\nMeanwhile, Toni has fallen for Steve and he for her, despite a difference in their ages of at least a decade. Matt has to come to terms with the fact that his adopted little girl is a grown woman, with a mind of her own. \"Margo's\" reappearance helps, and she is secretly amused by Toni's attempts to pair her off with Matt. Matt's doing pretty well on his own, as Toni observes with pleasure. She loves her adopted father and wants him to be happy.\nInevitably, the truth comes out. On the afternoon of the rehearsal for the first show of the circus season in Vienna - with Masters demanding of his performers the same show they will put on that evening - Toni finds a poster of The Flying Alfredos in her wagon living quarters with \"Suicide\" daubed on it in red. She also finds a newspaper clipping of the Flying Alfredos that allows her to identify \"Margo\" as her mother. There is a stormy confrontation with many passionate, hateful words on Toni's part between her, Lili and Matt; and Matt has to tell her that he was the second man in the love triangle. Toni curses both of them and runs out, just before a bugle call summons the show to Dress Rehearsal.\nThe rehearsal opens to empty seats with Grand Parade, with the performers marching in behind the flags of the nations whose citizens are in the show: the United States, Great Britain, France, Imperial Germany, Switzerland, Iceland, Sweden, Italy, and many more. Partway through Grand Parade, a fire breaks out in Wardrobe and spreads to the Big Top. Fast action by Lili, Matt, Steve, Toni, Cap and Aldo prevents injury to the circus performers and manages to save about half of the tent from the flames. The one positive thing to come out of the fire is a rapprochement between Toni and Lili.\nMatt somehow obtains permission from the Emperor to set up the circus in the grounds of the Imperial Palace. The show is a smash success, with a new act headlining: Lili and Toni Alfredo performing a swing-over routine fifty feet in the air. Ultimately Matt, Lili, Toni, and Matt's new partner and Toni's new fianc\u00e9, Steve, are shown taking bows to the applause of the people and the Crown.", "tmdb_plot": "Circus owner Matt Masters is beset by disasters as he attempts a European tour of his circus.

The two return to DeLorca's opulent mansion, where they argue about their falling out over Margaret's marriage to DeLorca, who originally courted Edith. Margaret had forced Frank to marry her by telling him she was pregnant with his child. However, Edith finds out from Margaret's chauffeur (George Chandler) that the couple were childless, and becomes resentful, realizing how Margaret had trapped Frank into marriage. While Margaret now enjoys a life of ease and wealth, Edith is struggling financially; her business, a cocktail lounge, is losing money and she is threatened with eviction for not paying her bills.\nAfter ushering her boyfriend, police sergeant Jim Hobson (Karl Malden) out of her apartment and brushing off her birthday plans with him, Edith begins planning her revenge. Edith phones Margaret to insist she come over so that they may settle their score. When Margaret arrives, she admits there never really was a pregnancy and Edith shoots her in the head. In a frenzy, Edith begins swapping their clothes, framing Margaret's murder as her own suicide. Before leaving the crime scene, she places the watch Jim gifted her onto Margaret's body. She then returns to the DeLorca mansion and assumes Margaret's identity, but while she may look like Margaret, the staff immediately become suspicious.\nThe house's Great Dane, known for hating Margaret, has suddenly taken to her immediately. Not only that, but Edith is a smoker - something Margaret was adamantly against. The maid (Monika Henreid) is puzzled when \"Margaret\" chooses not to put her very valuable jewelry in the safe, not knowing that Edith has no idea what the combination is. Eventually, because of her failure to imitate her sister's signature, Edith purposely burns her hand on a poker she has heated in the fire in order to have a plausible excuse not to sign her name with her right hand. The attorney informs her that Frank had left Edith $50,000 in his will, which now will be returned to the estate. This news renders Edith\u2019s murder of her sister pointless.\nMeanwhile, Jim visits \"Margaret\" several times, asking questions about the death of Edith. Edith is troubled about having to lie to Jim and tries to offer him the wristwatch as a keepsake - a gesture Jim recoils from. He remarks that \"Margaret\" is unaware of the significance of the watch, and it painfully reminds him of the birthday evening which was the last time, as far as he is concerned, that he ever saw Edith alive.\nEdith's scheme runs into unforeseen trouble when she discovers that Margaret's lover, Tony (Peter Lawford), has unexpectedly shown up and very quickly sees through her charade.

Ripper is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the 843rd Bomb Wing, flying B-52 bombers armed with hydrogen bombs. The planes are on airborne alert two hours from their targets inside the USSR.\nGeneral Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (an exchange officer from the Royal Air Force), to put the base on alert, confiscate all privately owned radios from base personnel and issue \"Wing Attack Plan R\" to the patrolling bombers. All the aircraft commence attack flights on the USSR and set their radios to allow communications only through their CRM 114 discriminators, which are designed to accept only communications preceded by a secret three-letter code known only to General Ripper. Happening upon a radio that had been missed earlier and hearing normal civilian broadcasting, Mandrake realizes that no attack order has been issued by the Pentagon and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper tells Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been fluoridating American water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. Mandrake realizes Ripper has become insane.\nIn the War Room at the Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson briefs President Merkin Muffley and other officers about how \"Plan R\" enables a senior officer to launch a retaliatory nuclear attack on the Soviets if all superiors have been killed in a first strike on the United States. It would take two days to try every CRM code combination to issue a recall order, so Muffley orders the U.S. Army to storm the base and arrest General Ripper. Turgidson, noting the slim odds of recalling the planes in time, then proposes that Muffley not only let the attack continue but send reinforcements. According to an unofficial study, this would result in \"modest and acceptable civilian casualties\" from the \"badly damaged and uncoordinated\" Soviet military that would remain after the initial attack. Muffley refuses this plan and instead brings Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski into the War Room to telephone Soviet Premier Dimitri Kissov on the \"hotline\". Muffley warns the Premier of the impending attack and offers to reveal the targets, flight plans and defensive systems of the bombers so that the Soviets can protect themselves.\nAfter a heated discussion with the Premier, the ambassador informs President Muffley that the Soviet Union created a doomsday machine as a nuclear deterrent; it consists of many buried bombs jacketed with \"cobalt\u2013thorium G\", which are set to detonate automatically should any nuclear attack strike the country. The resulting nuclear fallout would then engulf the planet for 93 years, rendering the Earth's surface uninhabitable. The device cannot be deactivated, as it is programmed to explode if any such attempt is made. The President's wheelchair-using scientific advisor, former German Nazi Dr. Strangelove, points out that such a doomsday machine would only be an effective deterrent if everyone knew about it; Alexei replies that the Soviet Premier had planned to reveal its existence to the world the following week at the Party Congress.\nU.S. Army troops arrive at Burpelson and battle with the garrison. After General Ripper commits suicide, Mandrake identifies Ripper's CRM code from his desk blotter and relays it to the Pentagon. Using the code, Strategic Air Command successfully recalls all of the bombers except for one, commanded by Major T. J. \"King\" Kong, due to the radio equipment being damaged in a missile attack. The Soviets attempt to find it, but Kong has the bomber attack a closer target due to dwindling fuel. As the plane approaches the new target, a Soviet ICBM site, the crew is unable to open the damaged bomb bay doors. Kong enters the bay and repairs the electrical wiring while straddling an H-bomb, whereupon the doors open and the bomb is dropped. Kong joyously hoots and waves his cowboy hat as he rides the falling bomb to his death.\nBack in the War Room, Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundred thousand people to live in deep underground mines where the radiation will not penetrate. He suggests a 10:1 female-to-male ratio for a breeding program to repopulate the Earth once the radiation has subsided, a plan which gathers enthusiastic support from the all-male command staff.

His deputies are the Greek ex-slave Timonides and the stern and honest general Gaius Livius. Privately Aurelius holds egalitarian ideals, and wants a successor who will reform the empire and grant equal rights to all its subjects; this disqualifies his son Commodus, who prefers to rule by force. Instead, Aurelius decides to nominate Livius, Commodus' closest friend and the lover of the emperor's daughter Lucilla.\nBefore Aurelius can announce his plan, he is poisoned by Commodus' cronies, who hope to secure their own political future by putting their friend on the throne. Feeling that a plebeian such as himself would never be accepted as emperor without Aurelius' explicit backing, Livius lets his old friend take the position instead. Commodus was not part of the murder plot, but nonetheless hated his father for trying to deny him the throne. He dedicates himself to undoing all of Aurelius' policies of equality, and to extracting heavy taxes from the provinces to enrich the city of Rome.\nMeanwhile, Livius' army defeats the Germans on the frontier. Among the captives are the chieftain Ballomar and his court. Timonides and Lucilla convince Livius to advocate for mercy towards the conquered barbarians, thus perpetuating the legacy of Aurelius. Timonides wins the Germans' trust by successfully undergoing an ordeal, having his hand held in the flame of a torch without crying out, and they agree to submit to the judgement of the Roman Senate. Despite hostility from Commodus, speeches by Livius and Timonides persuade the senators to let the German captives become peaceful farmers on Italian land, thereby encouraging their fellow barbarians to cooperate with Rome instead of fighting it. Thwarted, Commodus sends Livius back to the northern frontier and Lucilla to Armenia, with whose king, Sohaemus, she shares a loveless political marriage.\nLucilla joins a revolt in Rome's eastern provinces, where a famine has been exacerbated by the new taxes. Commodus sends his northern army against the rebels, knowing that Livius will put aside personal feelings and fight to preserve the unity of the Empire. As the opposing Roman armies meet for battle, Sohaemus arrives and attacks Livius with both the Armenian army and troops borrowed from Rome's archenemy, the Persians. The rebels patriotically decide to fight Persia instead of Rome, joining with Livius and helping him to vanquish Sohaemus. As a reward Commodus declares Livius his co-emperor, but only on condition that the northern army inflicts harsh punishments on the rebellious provinces.\nRejecting this piece of brutality, Livius and Lucilla take their army to Rome, intending to make Commodus abdicate. The emperor responds by bribing away the soldiers' loyalty and massacring Timonides and the population of the German colony. Lucilla tries to hire Verulus, Commodus\u2019 gladiator bodyguard, to assassinate her brother; Verulus declines, confessing that he slept with Aurelius\u2019 wife and that Commodus is his illegitimate son.\nThe Senate declares Commodus a god, and Livius and Lucilla are sentenced to be burned alive as human sacrifices to the new deity as the Roman citizens drunkenly celebrate. In consideration of their former friendship, Commodus offers Livius a duel for the throne. The two fight with javelins in the Roman Forum, where Livius eventually runs Commodus through. At last Livius is free to become emperor, but he has lost faith in Rome's ability to reform.

Sally introduces the idea of fate to McBane, who rejects it. During the investigation, it is revealed that the pier structure had been scheduled for demolition but the project had been delayed a few days; had the pier been dismantled on time the plane would have made a successful belly-landing. Finally McBane learns that Savage had accompanied another war buddy to the bar and had not been drinking himself. During a press conference, McBane struggles with the concept of fate and coincidence as the possible cause of the tragedy. Meanwhile, Webster, when interviewed in the hospital, insists that she witnessed fault warnings and alarm bells for both engines.\nEventually, a re-enactment test flight is organized as part of the investigation.

There is also a promissory note indicating Unosuke had run out of money while travelling, and left his wife behind as collateral in Nirazakizai. She seems to have paid off the debt and was travelling back to her husband with the baby boy. Because Ichi feels responsible for the woman's death, he volunteers to take the baby to Unosuke, and express his regrets. The village leader asks two villagers to accompany Ichi on the 60+ mile trip.

A multi-national group of astronauts in the UN spacecraft land, believing themselves to be the first lunar explorers. However, they discover a Union Jack flag on the surface and a note mentioning Katherine Callender, which claims the Moon for Queen Victoria.\nAttempting to trace Callender in the records office in Dymchurch in Kent, south-east England, the UN authorities discover that she has died, but that her husband Arnold Bedford is still living in a nursing home known as \"The Limes\". The home's staff do not let him watch television reports of the Moon expedition because, according to the matron, it \"excites him\". Bedford's repeated lunar claims are dismissed as senile delusion. The UN representatives question him about the Moon, and he tells them his story, which is shown in flashback.\nIn 1899, Arnold Bedford lives in a romantic spot, Cherry Cottage, next to a canal lock in Dymchurch. His fianc\u00e9e, Katherine Callender, known as Kate, arrives by car (driving herself), visiting the house for the first time. It is implied that Bedford is in financial difficulties by a letter about his rent being well past due. They meet a nearby neighbour, inventor Joseph Cavor, who wants to buy the cottage, just in case his experiments should damage it. Kate agrees to this on Bedfords behalf. Bedford begins spending time at Cavor's house, where the inventor has a large laboratory. He has developed a substance, Cavorite, that will let anything it is applied to or made of nullify the force of gravity. He plans to use it to travel to the Moon. Bedford has deeds drawn up and signed in Kate's name selling the cottage to Cavor for \u00a35000...(in reality he is selling something that he does not own).\nCavor tempts Bedford by telling him there are gold nuggets on the Moon. He has already built a spherical spaceship in the greenhouse next to the cottage. The sphere is lined inside with green velvet, and it has electric lights. There is an explosion at Cavor's house just as Kate arrives at the cottage. This is caused by Cavor's assistant, Gibbs, leaving for the local pub instead of watching the boiler used for processing the Cavorite. He shows her deep sea diving suits intended to keep them both alive while on the lunar surface. The production of Cavorite is increased. Kate brings some things for the trip: gin and bitters, chickens, and an elephant gun. But she gives Bedford an ultimatum: \"Cavorite or me\". Back at the cottage, Kate is served with a summons by a bailiff accompanied by a silent policeman. She has been charged with selling a property she does not own. Bedford and Cavor are just about to leave when Kate angrily hammers on the outside of the sphere wanting to know what he has done. They pull her inside just before the sphere launches.\nOn the long journey to the Moon they eat only sardines. It is not explained how the craft is steered, but opening a blind causes the sphere to veer toward the Sun. They eventually crash land on the lunar surface, and both men don the diving suits. Kate is placed inside an  air-tight compartment since she is unable to accompany them.\nWhile exploring the lunar surface, Bedford and Cavor fall down a vertical shaft, where there is breathable air. They discover an insectoid population, the Selenites, living beneath the surface in large caverns. (Cavor coins this name for the creatures after the Greek goddess of the Moon, Selene). While being herded by them,  Bedford attacks a group of Selenites out of fear, killing several, despite Cavor's horrified protests. After escaping, the two men discover that the sphere, still containing Kate, has been dragged into the underground city.\nThey are attacked by a giant caterpillar-like \"Moon Bull\", which pursues them until the Selenites are able to dispatch it with their ray weapons. Cavor and Bedford see the city's power station, a perpetual motion machine powered by sunlight. The Selenites quickly learn English and interrogate Cavor, who believes they wish to exchange scientific knowledge. Cavor has a discussion with the \"Grand Lunar\", the ruling entity of the Selenites. Bedford makes the assumption that Cavor, and presumably all humanity, is now on trial, he attempts to kill the Grand Lunar with the elephant gun, failing because of Cavor's interference. Now running for their lives, Bedford manages to find the sphere, and he and Kate are able to make an escape. Cavor voluntarily stays behind on the Moon.\nBedford flies the sphere up a vertical shaft of light, shattering the massive window-like covering at the top, and he and Kate return to Earth. He concludes his story by mentioning that they came down in the sea off the coast of Zanzibar, their sphere sinking without trace. They managed to swim ashore, but Cavor's ultimate fate remained unknown to them.\nIn the present, Bedford, the UN party, and newspaper reporters watch on television the latest events on the Moon. The UN astronauts have broken into the Selenite's underground city and find it deserted and decaying. The ruined city begins to crumble and collapse, forcing the astronauts to hastily retreat to the surface. Seconds later the entire lunar city is completely destroyed.

When Jim admits he can't get Bardot the mayor threatens him with dismissal. This leads Jim to suggest that instead of getting Bardot, they try to secure the French film star Fran\u00e7oise Fayol, whose latest New Wave film Pavements of Boulogne is premiering in Boulogne. With the mayor's approval, Stephens and Liggott travel across the Channel on the Medway Queen to persuade her to attend the planned film festival.\nOnce in France they find Fayol by accident when she drives into a group of inflatable dolls on the beach. They burn the dolls. They then find that Fayol is frustrated by being typecast as a sex symbol rather than being given more intellectual roles and wishes to break free from her domineering mentor. The two Englishman are able to win her friendship by helping to destroy a large consignment of inflatable replica models of her which she hates. She accompanies them back to Britain, where the people of Gormleigh organise a pageant based on the links between England and France to welcome her. The floats depict: King Harold getting an arrow in the eye at the Battle of Hastings; Madame Guillotine; and French art. The Napoleon and Josephine float gets jammed and the VIP grandstand accidentally gets launched down a slipway.\nFayol's introduction to life in Gormleigh is not a happy one, and includes being soaked first in the sea, then by rain and then in a puddle. She refuses to leave her hotel room and has to be coaxed out by Jim, for whom she has developed a liking. Jim and Fayol's publicity campaign sets about shaking up the staid town and its old-fashioned inhabitants. As Jim grows closer to Fran\u00e7oise Fayol, Judy becomes increasingly upset.\nWhen the film festival opens, it turns out to be a roaring success as tourists and the media flock in, attracted almost entirely by Fayol's presence and the glamour that comes in her wake. The finale of the festival features the screening of Fayol's new film Pavements of Boulogne, followed the next morning by the opening of a new nudist beach. Fayol is extremely nervous about her new film, as she hates seeing herself on screen, and is eager to win the main prize at the festival \u2013 the golden cockle. Things at first seem to be going well at the screening until the show is suddenly disrupted by a violent brawl organised by the jealous mayors of rival towns.\nThe next morning Fayol, distraught by the fight and the savage reviews of her film by newspapers, including Judy's, decides to go back to the Continent where her domineering mentor has found her a brilliant new film to star in. Despite a desperate rush to the railway station by Liggott to prevent her, she catches the train leaving the heroes urgently needing to find someone to take her place at the opening of the town's first nudist beach.

He meets up with an old mentor and friend, Frank Melnicker, who is playing multiple games of chess at a display of simultaneous play at a temperance hall. Garrett is confused by the apparently secretive way that one player, Richter, transfers the knight chess piece to Melnicker. When Melnicker notices two individuals enter the hall he is distracted and excuses himself for the lunch break. Garrett offers to drive Melnicker to his hotel. There are two people waiting for Melnicker outside his hotel. When Garrett intimates that since they are in England that Melnicker could find safety, Melnicker cryptically tells Garrett that he should recall his seventh chess move.\nGarrett's driver informs him that Major McPherson wishes to meet with him. At the meeting, the Major tells Garrett that he must stop socialising with Melnicker since he is a known communist.\nGarrett arrives at the Ministry of Defence for a meeting, and while in the bathroom a box of chess pieces is dropped off to him that his driver believes he mistakenly left in the car. In fact, it was left by Melnicker. It contains the knight chess piece and a money belt containing a considerable amount of money. Garrett takes the chess piece and money belt with him and leaves the building to return to the hall where the chess demonstration was happening.\nWhen he arrives at the hall he finds the display being torn down, with the demonstration cancelled due to Melnicker not returning after lunch. Garrett remembers the moves Melnicker had made and comes up with \"king\u2019s square four\". When he goes outside and says this to a cabby, the cabby suggests \"King\u2019s Square\" in Chelsea, which they drive to.\nAt the address, Garrett rings the doorbell to the flat and a young woman named Maggie calls to him from the second floor. She apparently is expecting him and throws down keys so he can let himself in. Others arrive, culminating in an entire wedding reception happening. Garrett is starting to doubt he is in the correct place, when he sees Maggie talking to Richter and finds a room upstairs with a chessboard that is missing the knight piece he has. Garrett has an opportunity to talk with Maggie and finds out she does know of Melnicker. Maggie then says she has to leave and Garrett leaves alone after copying down Maggie's phone number.\nOutside Garrett realises two men are following him. A running chase happens, with Garrett avoiding the two men by hiding in a children's sandbox. Afterwards, Garrett calls Maggie and says he must meet up with her so he can return the money to Melnicker. Maggie tells Garrett to meet her at the train station, where she convinces him to board the train with her.\nOn the train, Garrett continues to ask Maggie where Melnicker is and where they are travelling to. Maggie seems to be avoiding committing to anything and Garrett resigns himself to continuing on the train for the time being. Sometime later Maggie goes out into the corridor to smoke a cigarette and notices two men she identifies as \"secret police\" that they must avoid. They are chased around in the train until Maggie pulls the emergency stop cord and she and Garrett jump off the train.\nIn the woods, Garrett gets caught in an animal snare, and Maggie goes to find a stick to help pry it open. Garrett frees himself and while wandering around he falls into a canal. Maggie jumps in to rescue Garrett since he says he cannot swim. They then find a boatman named Wilkins who welcomes them onto his houseboat to get dry. He shows them around his boat which he explains is part of his plan to leave civilisation behind. They end up drinking a lot of rum and spend the night on the boat. Maggie and Garrett are developing feelings for each other.\nIn the morning Maggie seems quite cold towards Garrett. Wilkins directs them to a nearby road so they can continue on their journey. Maggie deliberately reads the road sign incorrectly and makes them walk in the opposite direction to where they should be going. A car goes by, stops, and points out they are going the wrong way. When they approach the car they find the driver is Richter, who forces them into the car at gunpoint and they drive towards an isolated cliff top.\nIt appears that Richter plans to kill them and get rid of their bodies in the sea. Garrett and Richter fight, and Richter loses and goes over the side of the cliff to his apparent death. When Garrett gets to where he left Maggie, she and the car are gone.\nGarrett starts to walk down the road and comes across a policeman on a bicycle who goes back to the cliff with him. The police officer seems to imply that they could just avoid reporting all this to avoid the effort, but Garrett wants to follow all official steps. They walk to a nearby hotel to use the phone. While the policeman is on one phone, Garrett uses another phone to call a colleague who works with him on the programme to monitor Russian rockets. He briefly explains he will return soon before hanging up. At this time he notices Maggie coming down the steps.\nGarrett is confused as to why Maggie is in the hotel. She walks off, telling him that she had tried to tell him to just leave. At this point Hubert Marek comes down the stairs and introduces himself to Garrett. They walk together to a lounge where all the major people from the past days are waiting for them. Marek moves around the room, paying off each individual with large amounts of cash. It is revealed that this was all an elaborate trap to trick Garrett to \"voluntarily\" come to this hotel - he has been used like a pawn in a chess game. Marek has \"sold\" Garrett to the Russians for his knowledge and has arranged for a submarine to come before dawn to take him away.\nThe next few hours involve Garrett being treated as a guest, while he waits for the submarine to arrive. The plan is for the submarine to pick him up before dawn. Garrett makes several halfhearted attempts at escape, until finally Maggie reveals that she has taken a set of keys to try to help them escape. She has truly fallen in love with Garrett and is willing to betray Marek. They head down to the shore, where Garrett finds that he cannot identify the correct key to unlock a small motorboat. He finds two life jackets in the boat, and it appears to Marek (watching from the hotel with binoculars) that Garrett and Maggie are attempting to swim to a nearby island with a castle.\nSeveral of Marek's henchmen take the boat and travel to the island. They find the life jackets have been attached to trousers, and that Garrett and Maggie faked the attempt for the island. Marek finds that Maggie and a trouserless Garrett are still at the hotel and calls for his men to return. Unknown to them, Garrett has rigged the alarm on his wristwatch to cause the boat to explode, killing the three henchmen. The submarine sees the explosion and takes off.

Her meek father is powerless to stop his wife. After forcing Nastenka to knit socks before the rooster crows (with Nastya ultimately imploring the sun to go down again so she can have more time), Nastya's stepmother gives Nastya the tasks of feeding the chickens, watering the cattle, splitting wood, and sweeping the yard. Meanwhile, Ivan finishes his chores and heads out into the woods after receiving some final words of guidance from his mother, such as not forgetting his mother, not harming the weak, and honoring those who are old. To all these pieces of advice Ivan off-handedly replies \"Don't worry\" repeatedly.\nWhile traveling in the woods, Ivan is accosted by a group of bandits. He quickly distracts them and tosses their wooden clubs so high in the air that he claims they won't fall down again until winter. Later, Ivan meets the elderly Starichok-Borovichok (eng. The Little Old Man - the Little Boletus), who playfully challenges Ivan to try and catch him, offering a prize if he does. Being able to turn invisible, Starichok-Borovichok soon wins and offers a contrite Ivan the prize anyway - a fine bow and quiver of arrows. However, when asked to bow before him in gratitude, Ivan boastfully declares, \"The bear may bow before you if you like, but not Ivan\" and leaves. Starichok-Borovichok remarks that the bear will indeed bow before him, but it would be Ivan's back that would bend.\nIvan comes across Nastya in the woods, ordered to pour water on a stump to make flowers grow in it. Taken by her beauty, he immediately asks her to marry him, citing his many accomplishments. She demurs, noting that he is too much of a braggart. Eager to prove his worth, he attempts to shoot a mother bear with her cubs. Starichok-Borovichok is watching nearby, and as the panicked Nastya puts her water bucket on his head, he changes Ivan's head into a bear. Horrified at the change, Ivan accuses Nastya of being a witch and runs off, leaving her to weep alone by the stump, her tears causing flowers to grow from it.\n\nWandering the land, Ivan comes across Starichok-Borovichok again, who scolds Ivan over his selfish nature, and how he never acted selflessly for anyone else. Thinking that all he must do to change back is a good deed, Ivan immediately seeks out people, demanding to know how he can help them; having a bear's head only terrifies them, however, and they all flee from him. He finally comes across an old woman carrying sticks to her home and offers to carry her, despite the distance being over many mountains. Arriving at her home, the woman thanks Ivan, noting how handsome he must be; though Ivan notes he is still a bear and thinks she is mocking him, she explains that she is blind - which is why she didn't run from him. Returning to the woods where he and Nastya first met, Ivan comes across the old woman's walking stick and vows to return it, with no thought of whether or not doing so will benefit him. Nearby, Starichok-Borovichok is pleased at Ivan's selflessness and restores him to human form. \nMeanwhile, the evil stepmother is trying to marry off Marfushka. After dressing her up in fine clothes, covering her in makeup and attaching a false braid on to Marfushka's head, she forces Nastya to wear a rag over her head and puts mud on her face to make her ugly. A wealthy suitor comes and asks Marfushka, who has never done a day's work in her life, to prepare a meal for him. While chasing geese into a pond, Marfushka nearly drowns until she is rescued by Nastya. In the process, Marfushka's braid and makeup wash away and Nastya's beauty is revealed. The suitor and his mother choose Nastya for a bride instead. The stepmother orders her husband to leave Nastya in the woods. On the way, the father decides he's had enough of his wife's bullying and vows to bring Nastenka back home. Believing her stepmother will be even crueler to him for doing so, Nastya jumps off the back of his sleigh. There, she comes across Morozko (Father Frost) bringing winter to the woods. Touched by her kindness and unselfishness, he rescues her from freezing to death and brings her to his home.\nIvan searches for Nastya, now that he's fully human again. He comes across Baba Yaga, whom he pleads for aid to find Nastya. She refuses to help, and after a battle of wills with her moving house (which the old woman loses), she animates a group of trees to kill Ivan. After nearly being cooked alive, Ivan tricks her and threatens to bake the witch in her own oven until she tells him how to find Nastya. After he leaves, the angry Baba Yaga sends her black cat to cause Nastya's death before Ivan can reach her. The enchanted sled sent by the Baba Yaga to show Ivan the way to Nastya leaves him trapped in a snowbank. While Father Frost is running some errands, the cat tricks Nastya into accidentally touching his staff, which freezes her solid. Nastya's father and dog sense that she is in trouble. The stepmother and Marfushka prevent him from leaving, but the dog escapes and rescues Ivan from freezing in the snow. They both arrive at Morozko's home to find her frozen. Ivan pleads for forgiveness for his behavior towards her. The power of love trumps the staff's power, and she is restored. To celebrate, Morozko gives Nastya and Ivan a large dowry of jewels and a horse-driven sleigh for their impending nuptials.\nOn their way to Ivan's home, he and Nastya are accosted by the bandits he'd encountered before, this time with help from Baba Yaga. After being overpowered, they are saved when the clubs from earlier fall conveniently on the bandits' heads, and they trap the witch in her own giant mortar. They return to the village, where the father welcomes Ivan as his son-in-law but the stepmother becomes jealous and the greedy Marfushka eyes their fortune and demands the same. Unfortunately for her, when Marfushka tries to duplicate Nastya's adventure in the snowbound forest, Morozko is so horrified by her rudeness that he sends her back on a pig-driven sleigh, with a box full of crows as a dowry. The stepmother is humiliated in front of the entire village and the father finally stands up for himself and regain his place as head of the household.

Instead of taking his wife to the same public burn pit used to dispose of his daughter's corpse, Morgan buried her without the knowledge of the authorities. When his wife returned to his home and attacked him, Morgan became aware of the need to kill the plague victims with a wooden stake. Morgan hypothesizes that he is immune to the bacteria from a bite by an infected vampire bat when he was stationed in Panama, which may have introduced a diluted form of the plague into his blood.\nOne day, a dog appears in the neighborhood.

Morgan's suspicion that Ruth is infected is confirmed when he discovers her attempting to inject herself with a combination of blood and vaccine that holds the disease at bay.

She tells him that she is part of a group of people like her \u2013 infected, but under treatment \u2013 and was sent to spy on Morgan.

Charlotte then attends a fashion photo-shoot at a swimming pool and eavesdrops at a nearby caf\u00e9 as two teenage girls discuss their love lives and first sexual encounters.\nCharlotte goes to the doctor and learns that she is pregnant. She does not know which man is the father and asks the doctor about contraception, leading to a discussion of the relationship between love, sexual pleasure, and conception.\nCharlotte then goes to Orly Airport for an assignation with Robert, as previously arranged, before he has to fly to Marseille to act in a production of Racine's B\u00e9r\u00e9nice. They meet in the back of the airport's cinema, during a screening of Night and Fog, Alain Resnais's documentary about the Holocaust.  Partway through the film, they leave the theater separately and rendezvous at the airport hotel to make love.  During their time together, Charlotte questions Robert about love. They hold hands on the mattress of the bed, echoing the opening shots of the movie.  As Robert prepares to leave, they both say \u2013 one after the other \u2013  C'est fini (\"It's over.\").", "tmdb_plot": "In an exploration of love and adultery, a woman is conflicted between her husband, her lover and herself.", "tmdb_id": "40652", "wiki_id": "2332603"}, {"title": "Mary Poppins", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Fantasy"], "wiki_plot": "In Edwardian-era London, in the spring of 1910, George Banks returns home, at number 17 Cherry Tree Lane, to learn from his wife, Winifred, that the babysitter Katie Nanna  has left their service after their children, Jane and Michael, had ran away, \"For the fourth time this week,\" (\"Life I Lead\"). They are returned home shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing after a lost kite. The children ask their father to help them build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. In contrast, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. (\"Perfect Nanny\") Winifred (who strongly agrees with the children) tries to keep the peace. After ordering Jane and Michael to go to bed, Mr. Banks rips up the letter and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but a strong wind draws the fragments up through the chimney and into the air.\nThe next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home for Ellen to show them all in, but a strong gust of wind blows them away. Jane and Michael then witness a young magical nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. Presenting herself to Mr. Banks, Mary Poppins calmly produces the children's restored advertisement and agrees with its requests but promises the astonished banker that she will be firm with his children. As Mr. Banks puzzles over the advertisement's return, Mary Poppins hires herself, and she convinces him it was originally his idea. She meets the children and helps them magically tidy their nursery by snapping her fingers, before heading out for a walk in the park (\"Spoonful of Sugar\").\nOutside, they meet Mary's old friend, Bert, a jack of all trades working as a street painter; Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of his drawings. While the children ride on a carousel, Mary Poppins and Bert go on a leisurely stroll. Together, they sing (\"Jolly Holiday\"), and Bert flirts with Mary Poppins. After the duo meets up with the children, Mary Poppins enchants the carousel horses; Bert rescues a fox from a fox hunt; they take part in a horse race which Mary wins. Describing her victory, Mary Poppins uses a nonsense word (\"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\"). The outing is ended when a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, returning the group to London; upon their return home, Mary forces the children to take medicine to avoid getting sick and puts them into bed, when Jane and Michael refuse to go to sleep, she calmly sings to them to help them go to sleep quicker (\"Stay Awake\").\nThe next day, the three meet Bert's odd Uncle Albert, who has floated up in the air because of his uncontrollable laughter and they join him for a tea party on the ceiling with lots of jokes (\"I Love to Laugh\"). Afterward, Mr. Banks becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere and threatens to fire Mary Poppins, but she persuades him to take the children to his workplace the next day. That evening, Mary sings to the children a hymn-like lullaby about the woman who sits on the steps of the St. Paul's Cathedral selling bird food (\"Feed The Birds\"). The next day at the bank, the children meet the elderly Mr. Dawes., Senior. Mr. Dawes aggressively urges Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank, ultimately snatching the coins from Michael (\"Fidelity Fiduciary Bank\").  Michael demands them back; other customers overhear the conflict, and they all begin demanding their own money back, causing a bank run.\nJane and Michael flee the bank, getting lost in the East End of London until they again meet up with Bert, now working as a chimney sweep, who escorts them home (\"Chim Chim Cheree\"). The three and Mary Poppins venture onto the rooftops, where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, which spills out into the Banks' home (\"Step in Time\") after their neighbor Admiral Boom shoots cartoon fireworks at them, mistaking them for robbers and calling them \"cheeky devils\". Mr. and Mrs. Banks return to home to find Bert's friends dancing in their home and sends them away. Mr. Banks then gets a phone call from the bank requesting a meeting with him about what the children did. The children overhear the phone call and realize that their father is in trouble. Bert tells Mr. Banks that he needs to spend more time with his children before they grow up (\"A Man Has Dreams\"). Michael gives his father the tuppence in the hope to make amends.\nMr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating cashiering and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\", tells Uncle Albert's \"Wooden leg named Smith\" joke the children told, and happily heads home. Mr. Dawes mulls over the joke and, finally understanding it, floats up into the air, laughing.\nThe next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary Poppins must leave. A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having fixed his children's kite, and takes the family out to fly it. In the park, the Banks family meets Mr. Dawes' son, Mr. Dawes Jr., who reveals his father died laughing from the joke (\"Let's Go Fly a Kite\").

Meanwhile, the old woman dies, infected with a deadly plague known as the Red Death. Upon discovering her, Prospero orders the village burned and abducts Gino, Ludovico and Ludovico's daughter, Francesca. He then tells the local nobility to come to his castle.\nAt the castle, Francesca is finely dressed by Prospero's consort, Juliana, and the gathered nobility are entertained by two dwarf dancers, Esmeralda and Hop-Toad. When Esmeralda accidentally knocks over a goblet of wine, one of Prospero's guests, Alfredo, strikes her. Meanwhile, Juliana tells Prospero she wishes to be initiated into his Satanic cult.\nImprisoned in the castle, Gino and Ludovico are taught armed combat so that they can kill one another as entertainment for the nobility, which they refuse to do. Juliana performs a ritual in the Black Room, pledging her soul to Satan, and then gives Francesca the key to Ludovico and Gino's cell. During their escape attempt, Gino, Ludovico and Francesca are recaptured by Prospero.\nAt a feast, Prospero summons Gino and Ludovico. During his execution, Ludovico attempts to kill Prospero. Unfortunately, he fails and dies at Prospero's hands. Prospero then casts Gino out of the castle to be killed by the Red Death. In the Black Room, Juliana undergoes her final initiation ceremony, drinking from a chalice and suffering hallucinations of figures who stab at her as she lies on an altar. Awakening from her dream, Juliana is killed by a falcon. As the nobles gather about her body, Prospero comments that Juliana is now married to Satan.\nOutside the castle, the remaining villagers beg Prospero for sanctuary, and he orders them to go away. When they refuse to move, he has them shot down with crossbow bolts, deliberately sparing only one small girl.\nMeanwhile, Hop-Toad, enraged by the striking of Esmeralda, persuades Alfredo to wear an ape costume to Prospero's masked ball, where no one is allowed to wear red. In the guise of the ape's trainer, Hop-Toad ties Alfredo to a lowered chandelier and raises him above the assembled guests. He then soaks Alfredo with brandy and fatally sets him on fire before fleeing.\nDuring the ball, Prospero notices the entry of the mysterious, red-cloaked figure. He and Francesca follow the figure into the Black Room, as Prospero believes it to be an ambassador of Satan. He asks to see its face, to no avail. At the ball, all of the nobles die of the Red Death, but their corpses keep dancing. Prospero asks for Francesca to be spared and given the same high status in Hell as he believes he himself will receive. The figure complies, and Francesca sadly kisses Prospero before leaving. The figure turns out to not be a servant of Satan, but the Red Death itself. Prospero rips off its mask to reveal his own blood-spattered face beneath. Horrified, he attempts to flee through the now-infected crowd, to no avail. Cornering Prospero in the Black Room, the Red Death notes that his soul \"has been dead for a long time\" and kills him.\nThe Red Death later plays with the surviving girl, using the Tarot cards. Other similarly cloaked figures gather around the Red Death, each wearing a different colour: white, yellow, orange, blue, violet, and black. They discuss among themselves how many people each of them \"claimed\" that night. When asked of his work, the Red Death notes that only six are left: Francesca, Gino, Hop-Toad, Esmeralda, the little girl, and an old man from a nearby village.

Tom baits the line with \"cheese\" and casts it all the way out to a far-off ship and into Jerry's mouse hole. The cat gets a bite and gets pulled off the pier and onto a pillar, while the sleeping mouse nibbles at the \"cheese\". Unbeknownst to him, the \"cheese\" is in reality, legally rubber. Tom catches the mouse in a fish net and plops him onto the pier, waking Jerry up with a start.\nJerry then gets a sense of his surroundings, and realizes that Tom is holding his tail and he is about to squash him with a hammer. The mouse substitutes the cat's hand for himself, and Jerry whistles at Tom from the closest pillar to alert him of his throbbing hand. Tom reacts by yelping and jumping into the stratosphere, kissing his hand all the while. Pleased with himself, Jerry starts to run back to another mouse hole while Tom nosedives after him like a plane landing. Jerry makes it to safety while the cat hits his head on the fence, just above the hole.\nTom rounds a turn, and just as fast, stops and retreats behind the corner. The camera pans to Jerry, who is perched on top of a dog. He hides in the dog's mouth as Tom tries to catch him without waking up the dog. Instead of grabbing the mouse, however, Tom grabs the dog's tongue. Jerry has been pulled out as well and escapes, leaving the cat facing an angry and awake dog. Tom grins and rolls up the dog's tongue back into his mouth, then moves the dog's lips to change his expression to a smile. Tom then waves the dog goodbye and attempts to run away in fear. Not one to let Tom off so easily, the dog undoes his smile, grabs Tom's tail, rolls him up like a bowing ball, and bowls him through some garbage cans and into the water, where a crab pinches Tom's tail hard. Tom leaps out in pain and knocks the crab back into the water.\nSoon, Tom spots a smaller dog being chased by a dog catcher. Tom forcibly grabs the dogcatcher's net and drags him to the dog, who is captured instead, knowing that he is Jerry's protector. Jerry, who wants to be protected by the dog, angrily gets a saw in a tool shed, hides behind the fence, and cuts the shaft of the net as the dogcatcher passes by. In gratitude, the dog gives Jerry a whistle to use whenever he's in trouble. Jerry, with relish, thinks of the fun times he could have with provoking Tom.\nJerry walks past a wooden box while Tom pokes his hand out of it and captures the mouse, who promptly whistles for his guardian. Tom is forcibly pulled through the knot hole and is being confronted by the mad dog. Tom grins, but soon his lips make a whistling gesture and he is exposed. The dog chokes Tom and the cat's mouth opens to reveal Jerry whistling on top of Tom's tongue. The mouse walks off and onto the dog's shoulder while the entire bowling sequence, complete with crab, is repeated.\nFinally, Tom sneaks behind the fence and leans over it to place earmuffs over the sleeping dog. However, his feet cause a board to creak out of place, leaving him dangling over the dog as it continues to fall. Tom saves himself by curling his tail around the foundation of the fence such that he and the board are pulled back up to the fence. Tom makes noises to test the earmuffs, and when the dog stays asleep, he happily goes off to corner Jerry. Jerry blows his whistle while Tom only looks more menacing than before, but then Jerry pulls out a pair of earmuffs for himself and continues whistling. Thinking that Jerry stole the dog's earmuffs, Tom gets so scared that he rolls himself into a ball and bowls off the pier, and even grabs the crab and attaches it to his tail. However, in the final scene, Jerry then puts that pair on as he lies down next to the dog (who still had his earmuffs on) to take a nap.", "tmdb_plot": "When a bulldog tells Jerry to \"just whistle\" any time that he needs him, Tom's in for big trouble until he puts earmuffs on the mutt.", "tmdb_id": "223034", "wiki_id": "12773247"}, {"title": "Murder Ahoy", "genres": ["Drama", "Thriller", "Crime", "Mystery", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "The action takes place mainly on board an old wooden-walled battleship, HMS Battledore, which has been purchased by a Trust for the rehabilitation of young criminals, and intended by the founder to \"put backbone into young jellyfish.\"\nShortly after joining the board of management of the Trust, Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) witnesses the sudden death of a fellow trustee, who has just returned from a surprise visit to the ship, much disturbed by something he has discovered there.  He dies without being able to reveal his discovery. Miss Marple manages to obtain a small sample of his snuff, which is found to have been poisoned.\nResolving to learn what the murdered trustee had discovered, she visits the ship, while her dear friend and confidante, Mr. Jim Stringer (played by Margaret Rutherford's husband Stringer Davis), investigates on shore. The Captain (Lionel Jeffries) takes an immediate dislike to her, and makes a sarcastic comment to the ship's First Mate (second in command) Commander Breeze-Connington (William Mervyn), about her outdated formal naval attire, asking \"Who does she think she is, Neptune's mother?\" His distress intensifies when she announces her intention to remain on board several days, and to sleep in the Captain's own quarters, obliging him to move into the First Mate`s cabin.\nThat night, Miss Marple and Mr. Stringer use morse code and flashlights to communicate and Miss Marple asks him to tail the sailors that just went ashore. Mr. Stringer finds that they are robbing houses and takes their dinghy to row to the ship and inform Miss Marple. Lt. Compton overhears their conversation and is heading down to tell the Captain when he is murdered \u2013 run through with a sword and then hanged from a mast. As the police investigation proceeds, the assistant matron is killed, apparently by an injection of poison. The investigation interferes with the ship's traditional celebration of Trafalgar Day.  Somewhat unreasonably, the Captain blames Miss Marple for this. He begs Chief Inspector Craddock (Charles 'Bud' Tingwell) to find a way to get her off the ship, saying: \"She's a jinx!  She's a Jonah!  She's blowing an ill wind!\"\nMiss Marple sets a trap. First, she persuades Chief Inspector Craddock to allow the crew to go ashore for their Trafalgar Day celebration. Then, she announces to the crew that she knows that the poison was administered using a mousetrap as a booby-trap, and she hints that she intends to reveal the murderer's identity shortly. When the crew leaves the ship, Chief Inspector Craddock and his assistant, Sgt. Bacon (Terence Edmond) secretly remain on board, hiding in wait for the murderer to reveal himself by attempting to silence Miss Marple. Miss Marple searches the ship for the loaded mousetrap, cautiously using a sword, not her hands, to poke into possible hiding places. She finds the mousetrap concealed in the barrel of a cannon, and with it, a large sum of money. Commander Breeze-Connington, armed with his sword, confronts her. In response to her questioning, he informs her that he has embezzled the money gradually during his many years on the Battledore - money he considers the service owed him because he was unjustly passed over for promotion while serving in the Royal Navy. He acknowledges having committed the three preceding murders to avoid being exposed, and adds that he intends to kill her on the spot, take the money, and flee the country.\nMiss Marple calls out to Chief-Inspector Craddock to make the arrest, but Craddock and Sgt. Bacon have been accidentally locked in their hiding place and cannot help. Breeze-Connington draws his sword, intending to run Miss Marple through, but Miss Marple is herself an accomplished amateur fencer.  She and Breeze-Connington engage in a ferocious sword-fight. Breeze-Connington succeeds in disarming her and is about to administer the coup de grace, but Mr. Stringer, whom Miss Marple had thought was ashore, clubs him over the head from behind with a belaying pin.\nThe Captain faces a court martial for failing to detect the embezzlement during his command. As he enters the state-room to hear the verdict, he sees his sword on the table with the hilt toward him, and mistakenly infers that he has been found guilty. Miss Marple corrects him; the board has found that he is not at fault. Although greatly relieved to have avoided disgrace, he announces that he must resign even so, because he has been having a long affair with the ship's Matron (Joan Benham). This is a violation of the golden rule of the trust that there should be \"no hanky-panky between the sexes\" on board ship. They now intend to get married, which would disqualify him for his position as Captain. He makes his farewell and turns to go, but Miss Marple stops him, saying, \"I think I speak for my fellow trustees when I say that golden rule is hereby rescinded. You're a fine sea dog captain, but it seems to me the Battledore could do with a woman's hand at the helm.\"  He and Matron embrace joyfully.\nAs Miss Marple steps into the dinghy to leave the ship, Matron and the Captain wave good-bye from the deck.

At the Covent Garden fruit-and-vegetable market one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach even Eliza Doolittle, the young flower seller woman with a strong Cockney accent, to speak so well he could pass her off as a duchess at an embassy ball. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees and describes how women ruin lives (\"I'm an Ordinary Man\").\nEliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\"With a Little Bit of Luck\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with \u00a35. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals.

Outside, Freddy is still waiting (\"On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)\") and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk (\"Show Me\"). Eliza tries to return to her old life but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by \"middle-class morality\", in which he gets drunk before his wedding day (\"Get Me to the Church On Time\").

After much struggle, the drunkard falls onto the floor and faints.

Later that night, he heard that Chitra committed suicide on a railway track, and this hurts him a lot. Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love.\nThe engagement of Gopal and Latha is fixed. While the reception is being held at Gopal's mansion, a woman claiming to be Chitra arrives, accompanied by her uncle Rangan. Gopal's engagement with Latha is cancelled after Rangan convinces everyone that the woman is indeed Chitra. Gopal says she is an impostor and shows Chitra's death certificate as proof, but Rangan reads in the certificate that though the corpse was disfigured beyond recognition, Gopal insisted that it was Chitra so it was declared to be her. Rangan's actions convince Gopal's police officer friend Kumar, although Gopal is adamant that his wife is dead. \"Chitra\" and Rangan become disruptive and Gopal gets frustrated, fearing that Latha might leave him because his \"wife\" has turned up.\nAfter many failed attempts to expose the impostor, Gopal reveals the truth to everyone: when he slapped Chitra, not knowing she was suffering from a heart condition, she died immediately. Gopal realised that he had inadvertently killed his wife. To avoid arrest, and safeguard the honour of his family, he manipulated the murder to appear like a suicide on a railway track and fabricated the necessary evidence to show that Chitra committed suicide.\nWith everyone believing his story, Gopal orders Kumar to arrest the Chitra impostor. However, Latha reveals herself as a police officer investigating Chitra's death based on the complaint filed by Raju, who suspected she could not have committed suicide. Ramadurai is Latha's senior posing as her father, Rangan is the local investigating officer, and the Chitra impostor is Rangan's aide, Sarasa. Together, they staged an entrapment to get the killer's confession because there was no clinching evidence. Latha confesses to a dejected Gopal that though she initially pretended to love him, his good nature impressed her and she truly loves him; she promises that she will wait for him till he returns after completing his jail term.

His popularity has reached an all-time low of 29%, there is rioting about the treaty right outside the White House and he is warned of a dangerous cardiac condition by the presidential physician, which he blithely disregards, too busy and beleaguered to take a prescribed two-week vacation.\nUnited States Marine Corps colonel \"Jiggs\" Casey is the director of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He serves its chairman, four-star United States Air Force general James Mattoon Scott, a former air ace who earned six Purple Hearts, two Distinguished Service Crosses and the Medal of Honor.\nCasey stumbles upon evidence that Scott is leading the Joint Chiefs to stage a coup d'etat to remove Lyman in seven days. Under the plan, disguised as a training exercise, a secret army unit known as ECOMCON, training at a secret Texas base, will take control of the country's telephone, radio and television networks while the president, participating in a staged \"alert,\" is seized. Scott, who is busy advancing his charismatic public persona through nationally televised anti-treaty rallies, is planned to head a military junta. Although personally opposed to Lyman's policies, Casey is appalled by the plot and alerts Lyman.\nStill somewhat skeptical, Lyman gathers a circle of trusted advisors to investigate: Secret Service White House detail chief Art Corwin, Treasury Secretary Christopher Todd, longtime advisor Paul Girard and Raymond Clark, the senior U.S. senator from Georgia and a close friend of 21 years.\nCasey has deduced that the heads of all branches of the U.S. military but the Navy support Scott's coup scheme, with Vice Admiral Barnswell, then aboard an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, apparently the only invited officer to decline. Lyman cancels a previous commitment to participate in Scott's alert, offering the ruse that he will be away for a fishing weekend. He then dispatches Girard to Gibraltar to obtain Barnswell's confession, sends the alcoholic Clark to Texas to locate the secret base and tasks Casey to gather dirt on the general's private life. Meanwhile, the Secret Service surreptitiously films evidence of an attempt to kidnap the president during the phony fishing trip, removing all doubts about the existence of a plot.\nGirard successfully secures Barnswell's confession in writing, but it disappears during a plane crash in Spain.

Exploiting Casey's longtime friendship with the base's deputy commander Colonel Henderson, Clark convinces Henderson of the actual intent of the impending \"alert.\" Henderson frees Clark and leads an escape back to Washington but is abducted and confined in a military stockade there. In a radiophone conference call with the president, Barnswell denies knowledge of any conspiracy.\nKnowing that he cannot prove Scott's guilt, Lyman nevertheless calls Scott to the White House to demand that he and the other conspirators resign. Scott refuses and denies the existence of any plot. Lyman argues that a coup would prompt the Soviets to launch a preemptive nuclear strike. Scott maintains that the American people are behind him. Lyman challenges him to resign and run for office in order to seek power legitimately, but Scott is unmoved.

Tom soon gets cold and does everything he can to stay warm. Tom then peeks through the window and sees Jerry making a fire. His grin is invidious.

Finally, he visits her grandmother, who tells him that she is in excellent health and that his wife has not visited in over a month.\nThe film then cuts to Mary (Aliki Vougiouklaki) who is practicing dance steps with her maid and sings about looking forward to her outing that night. Michalis' wife, Lilly (Maro Kontou) arrives and thanks Mary for letting her borrow her car, and apologises for scratching it; Lilly confides in Mary that she was just on a date. Nikos (Alekos Alexandrakis), Mary's husband and Michalis' colleague, arrives home, and is greeted by Mary and Lilly, the latter of which explains that she was waiting for Mary who has just returned from a car trip. Mary goes along with the lie so as not to expose her friend's infidelity.\nAs Mary and Nikos get ready for their outing that night, they notice that the car is not just scratched, but has been in a crash; Mary panics and builds on the lie, claiming that she omitted describing the accident earlier so as not to worry Nikos.\nWhile out with Nikos, they are joined by Takis (Giorgos Pantzas), Nikos' friend and lawyer. Mary feels uncomfortable lying to Nikos and is about to come clean, when Takis brings up a recent divorce case he worked on, and Nikos agrees that once a man knows his wife can lie to him, he will no longer trust her, prompting Mary to keep quiet.\nThe following day, a stranger visits Mary at home, claiming that Mary hit her dog with her car and demanding compensation, further blackmailing Mary when she sees that the man in the car was not Mary's husband; Mary gets money from Nikos to pay her off. After the woman leaves, a wallet is found belonging to a man. Mary claims that the woman may have dropped it. A police officer also drops by the house and summons Mary to court for the traffic accident.\nAt court, Takis arrives to represent Mary. While waiting for Mary's case to be heard, Takis and Nikos go for coffee, and Mary strikes a conversation with a man in the courtroom. Another woman interrupts jealously, saying that the man is her lover. Mary's case is called while Takis is still having coffee, and without her lawyer present, Mary makes a negative first impression with the judge. The woman from the courtroom is bringing a claim against Mary for the traffic accident, and her lover is also her lawyer. \nA police officer corroborates the woman's claim, saying that he saw Mary speed past him with a man in her car, giving him a rude gesture as she did so. A vision-impaired tavern owner also puts Mary and a young man at the scene. The blackmailing woman, who turns out to be a con artist who fakes accidents involving her dog so people pay her compensation, was also in court that day, and also chimes in from the gallery that she saw Mary at the scene. Takis, who arrives from his coffee break, notes that they found a wallet she dropped; the man it belongs to turns out to be the claimant's lawyer, and the witnesses confirm they saw him in the car with Mary.\nMary calls Lilly as a witness, who confesses to borrowing Mary's car and causing a traffic accident. However, the other witnesses double down on their assertions that Mary was the person they saw in the car, and Takis says that he cannot argue in the face of the facts presented by these witnesses. The judge finds Mary guilty and excuses Lilly for her perceived perjury, expressing admiration for her willingness to take the fall for her friend.\nNikos too believes that his wife was unfaithful, and initially refuses to pay Mary's fine, so Mary spends the day in a holding cell, where the other inmates sing to cheer her up. Nikos returns to pay the fine, and is angry to find Mary singing with the prisoners.\nAt home, Nikos says that Mary's supposed infidelity relieves him of the guilt he felt about his own. He reveals that during a work trip to Salonika four months ago, he stayed 12 extra nights not to work, but to lay with another woman. The couple argue and sleep in separate rooms. Mary has a dream (shown through rainbow colours in an otherwise black and white movie) where she tries to dance with Nikos but is interrupted by another woman as other women laugh at her.\nMichalis confronts Nikos at work about Lilly's testimony, and Nikos reassures him that Lilly lied to protect Mary. Michalis confronts Lilly at home, who claims the same thing, but Michalis is unsatisfied with inconsistencies in Lilly's account.\nMary learns that there is a photographer stationed outside the tavern where Lilly and the man were spotted, and could prove her innocence if he took a picture of the couple. Lilly recalls the same, and calls the man asking him to find the picture. Mary and the man both drive to the tavern, pursued by their respective significant others. Mary and the man arrive at the same time, and photographer confirms that he did take a picture of the couple, but that another man already bought it from him earlier that day. Mary offers the photographer double if he can find the film and make another print. Nikos, seeing Mary and the man together by the photographer, feels that his suspicions are confirmed and drives off. The woman, on the other hand, gets out of her car and throws rocks at the man.\nMary arrives home, and does not tell Nikos where she has been in an effort to make him jealous. Takis arrives as Nikos' divorce attorney, Nikos having instructed him to produce divorce papers at speed. Takis asserts that he could represent both parties at divorce proceedings, and Mary requests a private conversation with him as her purported lawyer. Mary flirts with Takis, so when Nikos comes in to check on them, he finds Takis in a compromising position. Nikos angrily asserts that Takis agreed to expedite the divorce proceedings so that Mary would be an unmarried woman and Takis could make his move. Takis asks Mary to explain the situation, and echoing Takis' ineffective assistance at her court hearing, Mary says that she cannot argue in the face of the facts presented by Nikos. \nNikos fires Takis, and says that he needs to pack for a trip to get away from Mary. Mary echoes this statement and goes to pack as Nikos answers a call at the door. Nikos is visited by Michalis, who bought the exculpatory photograph and explains that he overhead his wife calling the man asking him to collect it, and he managed to get there first.\nMary arrives with two suitcases, ready to leave, and is disappointed that Nikos does not try to stop her from leaving. Nikos instead offers to take her bags to the car, and come along for the drive so he can bring the car back from the airport. During the drive, Mary reasserts her innocence, saying she has photographic proof that she was not driving the car that day. Nikos adamantly refuses to see it and says it will not change his mind.

Afterwards, Pierre's friend insists on having a drink before Pierre returns to Paris. As they leave, Pierre ignores Nicole who has been waiting in the street. When his friend invites himself to accompany him back to Paris, Pierre sneaks back to the hotel where an upset Nicole tells him he should leave without her. He apologises and they decide to leave. After driving through the night they find a romantic cabin.\nThe next day, Pierre and Nicole enjoy their time together taking photographs.

Having called Reims the previous night, Franca suspects he's lying and hangs up in anger. After driving Nicole home, Pierre faces his wife and they argue. Franca accuses him of having an affair and Pierre walks out of their apartment, spending the night sleeping in his office.\nThe following morning, Franca calls him at the office informing him that she will never forgive him for walking out on her and that he'll be contacted by her divorce lawyer. Pierre goes to Nicole's apartment, but she is unable to talk because her father is about to visit. Pierre passes her father on the stairwell as he's leaving. Back at his apartment, Pierre and Franca discuss their divorce and Franca falls apart, sometimes hitting him and at other times begging for his forgiveness. They make love, and afterwards she asks if he will be coming back. He tells her it would never work out with all that's happened. She slams the door behind him.\nOvercome with depression, Franca is comforted by her friend Odile, who throws away the sleeping pills she finds in the bathroom fearing her friend may attempt suicide.

Sick of having to sing opera for life, Yuehong rashly agrees to Tang's proposal, but Chunhua distrusts Tang and refuses to support Yuehong\u2019s marriage plans.  Unbeknownst to Yuehong, Tang already has a wife, and is keeping her as a mistress.\nOne day faded ex-star Shang commits suicide by hanging herself back. Chunhua is incensed that Tang, her former lover, attempts to shirk his responsibilities by claiming he has nothing to do with her death. Through this episode, Chunhua gets to know a \"radical\" lady journalist Jiang Bo (a female communist reporter investigating the death), who advises her to become \"progressive\" to teach other Chinese to distinguish between truth and falsehood. She starts performing \u201cprogressive\u201d operas like an adaptation of Lu Xun\u2019s \u2018\u2019The New Year Sacrifice\u2019\u2019 in an attempt to politicize the work of the troupe, whose production consequently gets banned.Chunhua\u2019s works alert the KMT regime who gives Tang the task to ruin Chunhua's reputation. They get A\u2019Xin to file a lawsuit against Chunhua and Manager Tang coerces Yuehong to testify against Chunhua, but at the crucial moment in the courtroom, Yuehong faints.\nThe film ends in 1950, one year after the establishment of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Chunhua prepares to perform The White-Haired Girl for country folks at Zhejiang. Tang has run off to Taiwan with the KMT cohort and Yuehong is quietly abandoned at Shaoxing province. Although Yuehong witnesses Chunhua\u2019s drama, she is too ashamed to face her sworn sister again. Near a quay later the day, however, the sisters manage a tearful reunion. On the boat the following day, Yuehong vows to learn her lesson and walk the \"correct\" path while Chunhua dedicates her entire life to performing revolutionary operas.", "tmdb_plot": "In pre-revolutionary China, two young girls, Chunhua and Yuehong Xing, rise through the ranks of Chinese opera, but with their artistic success comes a new series of personal and social challenges.

On the main street, they are greeted by a bluegrass trio and crowds of townsfolk cheering and waving Confederate army flags. They meet Rufus, Lester, town mayor Earl Buckman, local shop owner Harper and his girlfriend, Betsy, who coerce them into staying for the weekend to be the \"guests of honor\" for their centennial celebration. The six are hesitant to stay, especially Tom, who had been on his way to a convention in Atlanta before his car broke down and he was picked up by Terry. The mayor is reluctant to give details about the centennial, but he offers to put them up in complimentary hotel rooms and promises them free food and entertainment throughout the celebration, and the visitors eventually give in.\nThat afternoon, John receives a phone call in his hotel room from Betsy, who offers to show him around town. Bea is leery of John when he tells her that Mayor Buckman was calling to see him, since they are both prone to extramarital affairs. After John leaves, Bea gets a call from Harper, who invites her to take a walk with him. She accepts the invitation and he leads her into the woods nearby, where he shows her his pocket knife and uses it to slice off her right thumb. Harper then takes an hysterical Bea to the mayor's office where she is accosted by Rufus, Lester, and Mayor Buckman. As the other three hold her down on a desk, Rufus chops off her right arm with an axe while they laugh maniacally.\nMeanwhile, Tom meets with Terry to discuss the strange goings on in town. He tries to make a long distance call to the convention from Terry's room, but the hotel's phone operator tells him that the outside lines are down. He then tries to use a payphone outside and leaves a message for one of his colleagues, not realizing that the person on the other end of the line is Mayor Buckman.\nAt a barbecue that evening, Bea's arm is slowly roasted to ashes on a spit. Although the guests are unaware of what is being cooked, Terry has her suspicions. Mayor Buckman also grows suspicious when Tom is nowhere to be found, so he takes Rufus and Lester to search for him. When they leave, Tom sneaks back to the gathering and quietly draws Terry away to a plaque he found in the woods. It marks the spot where, at the end of the Civil War in 1865, a group of renegade Union soldiers laid waste to the town of Pleasant Valley. The plaque goes on to state that it stands in memoriam to the townspeople killed in the attack and as a \"testament to the vengeance pledged in their memory.\" They realize that this \"centennial\" is really an act of revenge for the destruction of the town one hundred years ago, and that they are the intended victims. Mayor Buckman, Rufus, and Lester spot the two from a distance and run after them, but Terry and Tom make it back to town and shake the pursuit in an alley.\nBack at the festivities, Betsy gets John drunk on moonshine while David and Beverly watch from across the barbecue pit. After Harper escorts the couple back to the hotel, the townspeople surround John and make him participate in the \"horse race.\" Too inebriated to resist, John has his arms and legs each roped to four horses that are sent running in different directions, dismembering him. The crowd goes silent and looks on in apparent regret, until Lester has the bluegrass band strike up a rousing chorus of Dixie.\nThe next morning, the Wells' are awakened by the band playing outside their window. They begin to suspect that they are being separated from the others and David tries to call John, but is told by the operator that he has already gone out with Bea. Meanwhile, in the mayor's office, Buckman learns from Rufus and Lester that Tom returned to his room after he and Terry escaped the night before. The mayor tells them to keep an eye on Tom and make sure that he stays in his room for the time being. Outside the hotel, the Wells' are greeted by Harper and Betsy, who tell them that the Miller's have gone on a \"boat ride.\" Elsewhere, two local teenagers take Bea and John's remains on a boat and dispose of them in a lake.\nBetsy takes David to a gathering on a hill near the lake for first event of the day, the \"barrel roll.\" Rufus and another man force David into a barrel, and Mayor Buckman embeds it with nails and rolls it down the hill, killing David. Rufus exclaims that this is the best centennial anyone ever had, and David's body is also dumped in the lake.\nAt the hotel, Tom tries to leave his room but is met by a man sitting outside his door. He climbs out the window and gets into Terry's room. She calls the guard outside Tom's door into her room and Tom knocks him out. They sneak out of a back door, but Harper sees them and gives chase. They run through a nearby swamp, where Harper get stuck in a pool of quicksand and sinks.\nLester brings Beverly to the town square to be the judge for the next event, \"Ol' Teeterin' Rock.\" Another cheering crowd is gathered around a wooden platform raised in the middle of the square, over which a large boulder is precariously balanced on a smaller platform tied to a dunk tank target. Beverly grows increasingly upset as it dawns on her what will happen, and Lester explains that Beverly must judge when the boulder will fall. She is tied down to the platform and the crowd take turns throwing rocks at the target, and Mayor Buckman tells Beverly to say \"it ain't fallin' yet\" every time the townsfolk miss. Lester finally takes a softball and hits the target, causing the boulder to topple and crush Beverly while the crowd silently nods in approval.\nMeanwhile, Tom and Terry return to town to locate Terry's car. With the help of a little boy named Billy, they find the car in a garage. As Mayor Buckman and a horde of townsmen approach, they take Billy hostage and speed away. They are chased by a truck, but Terry and Tom make it to the main road, where they release Billy and escape. They drive to the nearest police station and tell the chief their bizarre tale, but the sheriff is skeptical.\nReturning to town, Rufus and Lester lament the fact that they only managed to kill four of the six Yankees, but Mayor Buckman deems the centennial a success anyway. He orders his people to take down the centennial banner and declares the celebration over.\nTom and Terry return to Pleasant Valley with the police chief, only to find that the town has vanished. The chief continues to doubt their story about the murderous townspeople, and Terry begins to question her sanity. The chief then recalls a local legend: a hundred years ago, as the Civil War was drawing to an end, a group of rogue Union troops raided a small town called Pleasant Valley, massacring the entire population and burning the town to the ground. It was said that the spirits of those killed in the attack still haunted the woods and clearing where the town once stood, waiting for the day when they could exact their revenge. They drive away, and as Terry and Tom reach the state line, Terry still wonders whether it was all just a nightmare, until Tom finds a small noose left in the backseat by Billy.\nThe film ends with the ghosts of Rufus and Lester sitting by the roadside, reminiscing about their centennial and looking forward to the next one in 2065. They call out to Harper, who emerges from the quicksand pit, and the three head for the woods and disappear into a gathering mist.", "tmdb_plot": "Six people are lured into a small Deep South town for a Centennial celebration where the residents proceed to kill them one by one as revenge for the town's destruction during the Civil War.", "tmdb_id": "28177", "wiki_id": "3327237"}, {"title": "Under Age", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "A woman from Dallas goes on trial, charged with encouraging her 14-year-old daughter to have sex with a 16-year-old Mexican boy.A number of actors from Buchanan's prior courtroom drama Free, White and 21 returned for this film.

Tom deliberates on how to get rid of the kitten, because to him, one cat in the house is heaven, but two cats will just be a living hell for him. When the owner leaves to get food for the kitten, Tom grabs the kitten. Jerry hears the loud cry of the kitten and becomes angry. Jerry manages to remove himself from the string and uses it as a lasso to save the kitten. Jerry traps Tom's foot before he can kick the kitten out of the window, making him release the kitten.

At the grave he reminisces on a fight between the two yakuza gangs (Iioka and Sasagawa from an earlier film) one man ran away and, though Ichi was not taking part in the fight, attacked Ichi. The dead man's sister, Chiyo, overhears Ichi say this to himself.\nIchi is invited to take part in a village celebration: after three years of drought and near famine they and seventeen other villages in Usui county have raised 1,000 Ryo with which to pay taxes to the local intendant. Ichi gladly joins in while the locals sing of their hero Chuji- who lives in the hills with a troupe, hiding from the constabulary while protecting the villagers. As they transport the gold to the local intendant (Gundayu) they are ambushed by three samurai (led by Jushiro, who wields a whip) and then by a larger band. Several of the villagers are slain and the rest flee. When the robbers chase the chest of gold to the base of the hill, they find Ichi sitting atop it smoking his pipe. He kills several men when attacked and the rest flee. In the village the local men accost Ichi, blaming him for its theft, before he promises to find the gold. The conversation is overheard by a well dressed woman called Ogin. Taking the backroads to avoid government checkpoints he encounters her again. When she questions his motive for being on the backroad he replies that he could not tell, as he is blind and then asks her why she is on the same road.\nIn the onsen at her destination Ogin takes a private room only for Ichi to rise from the water. He recognizes her and reassures her that he is blind and can see nothing (else he would be peeking, and at this he squirts two men who are peeping through a window on the roof) and they briefly talk. When she leaves she sees the sister, Chiyo, and asks why she has been following Ichi from Itakura. On Mt Akagi several of Chuji's troupe inform him that some of the men were killed by a blind man with a sword, only for Ichi to arrive to ask Chuji why he stole the money. Ichi informs the bandit that some of his men have gone rogue and stolen the chest of gold- though the two men are quick to confess and ask that he kill them for their acts. Losing his taste for the bandit life style, Chuji decides to leave and asks Ichi to take a different route- in order to escort the young nephew of one of the troupe to safety, before thanking Ichi for his faith in him.\nIn the nearby town, Ogin (the lover of Monji), accompanied by Chiyo, tells Monji about Ichi going to the bandits and Monji promises revenge for the sister. Monji has just been promoted to head of the local constabulary and received his jitte (one pronged iron truncheon) as mark of office. He organizes a number of men to capture Ichi and the bandits on Mt Akagi. Ichi hears them coming and raises the alarm system the bandits set up at the bottom of the mountain, attracting the police and killing many of them to allow the others more time to escape. However the others are soon trapped and die defending their boss.\nThe next morning in an inn, Monji talks with Jushiro about their plan, but the other two samurai are disgruntled at being treated poorly when they learn of a blind gambler doing well at the dice hall. They approach him and after Jushiro cuts a mon coin in half by throwing his sword in the air, they bet Ichi 35 Ry\u014d that he can't do the same. He accepts and wins. Outside, he confronts the two samurai whose conversation he overheard. While they deny knowledge, one of them inadvertently reveals the intendant's involvement. Ichi pays them 10 Ry\u014d, but they still attack him and are killed.\nThe Itakura village headman pleads for Intendant Gundayu to be lenient as the tax money was stolen. Gundayu accuses the headman of lying, insisting that the tax be paid in ten days. Jushiro talks to Gundayu, with Monji present, and reveals that Gundayu is the recipient of the stolen 1000 Ry\u014d and demands more money. Ichi arrives and Jushiro calls Ichi a worm, though he wants to kill him privately so that the other two men get no pleasure from seeing their enemy killed. Monji orders his men to capture Ichi but Jushiro knocks them back with his whip, saying they will only die and Ichi leaves unmolested. Gundayu orders the headman and three other village men executed at dawn. On his return to Itakura, Ichi is mobbed, but they stop when some calls him a blind fool and his demeanour changes. He leaves and Chiyo follows him. He says he sensed who she was from the start and she pleads with Ichi to save them.\nThe Itakura villagers had hoped to launch an attack against Gundayu's troops, believing they have nothing to lose, but lose heart when it's learned that he has deployed eight musketeers as part of his force. However, Zatoichi launches a surprise attack and succeeds in killing the riflemen. Learning of this, Monji and Gundayu panic. Gundayu starts to destroy written evidence of the crime, saving himself while implicating Monji, when Monji demands half the gold, only to be killed by Gundayu. Ichi arrives as Gundayu flees and says Gundayu can atone by giving the farmers a receipt for their taxes and returning the gold to them. He attacks Ichi and is killed. Jushiro arrives and says he does not want the gold but to meet him at Bodai Temple in an hour. Chiyo is waiting for Ichi and he gives her the gold. He also gives his gambling winnings for a proper headstone for her brother. Chiyo, possibly taken with Ichi, pleads with him to stay for the forthcoming celebration in the village.\nJushiro arrives at the duel on a horse and wraps his whip around Ichi's neck, dragging him along behind and causing Ichi to drop his sword.

He is waiting at the Athens port of Piraeus on mainland Greece to catch a boat to Crete when he meets a gruff, yet enthusiastic Greek-Macedonian peasant and musician named Zorba. Basil explains to Zorba that he is traveling to a rural Cretan village where his father owns some land, with the intention of reopening a Lignite mine and perhaps curing his writer's block. Zorba relates his experience with mining and persuades Basil to take him along.\nWhen they arrive at Crete, they take a car to the village where they are greeted enthusiastically by the town's impoverished peasant community. They stay with an old French former courtesan named Madame Hortense in her self-styled \"Hotel Ritz\". The audacious Zorba tries to persuade Basil into making a move on Madame Hortense, but when he is reluctant, Zorba seizes the opportunity, and they form a relationship.\nOver the next few days, Basil and Zorba attempt to work the old lignite mine, but find it unsafe and shut it down.  Zorba then has an idea to use the forest in the nearby mountains for logging, (his specific plan is left ambiguous, but it seems he thinks the timber can be used to shore up the tunnels). The land is owned by a monastery, so Zorba visits and befriends the monks, getting them drunk. Afterwards, he comes home to Basil and begins to dance in a way that mesmerizes Basil.\nMeanwhile, Basil and Zorba get their first introduction to \"the Widow\", a young and attractive widowed woman, who is teased incessantly by the townspeople for not remarrying, especially to a young local boy who is madly in love with her, but whom she has spurned repeatedly. One rainy afternoon, Basil offers her his umbrella, which she reluctantly takes. Zorba suggests that she is attracted to him, but Basil, ever shy, denies this and refuses to pursue the widow.\nBasil hands Zorba some money, and sends him off to the large town of Chania, where Zorba is to buy cable and other supplies for the implementation of his grand plan. Zorba says goodbye to Basil and Madame Hortense, who is by now madly in love with him. In Chania, Zorba entertains himself at a cabaret and has a brief romance with a much younger dancer. In a letter to Basil, he details his exploits and indicates that he has found love. Angered by Zorba's apparent irresponsibility and the squandering of his money, Basil untruthfully tells Madame Hortense that Zorba has declared his love to her and intends to marry her upon his return, which makes her ecstatic to the point of tears. Meanwhile, the Widow returns Basil's umbrella by way of Mimithos, the village idiot.\nWhen Zorba eventually returns with supplies and gifts, he is surprised and angered to hear of Basil's lie to Madame Hortense. He also asks Basil about his whereabouts the night before. That night, Basil had gone to the Widow's house and spent the night. The brief encounter comes at great cost. A villager catches sight of them, and word spreads, and the young local boy who is in love with the Widow is told about it. The next morning, the villagers find his body by the sea, where he has drowned himself out of shame.\nThe boy's father, Mavrandoni, holds a funeral which the villagers attend. The widow attempts to come inconspicuously, but is blocked from entering the church. She is eventually trapped in the courtyard, then beaten and stoned by the villagers, who hold her responsible for the boy's suicide. Basil tells Mimithos to fetch Zorba. Zorba arrives just as a villager, a friend of the boy, tries to kill the widow with a knife. Zorba overpowers the much younger man and disarms him. Thinking that the situation is under control, Zorba asks the Widow to follow him and turns his back. At that moment, the dead boy's father pulls his knife and cuts the widow's throat. She dies at once, as the villagers shuffle away apathetically, whisking the father away. Only Basil, Zorba and Mimithos show any emotion over her murder. Basil proclaims his inability to intervene whereupon Zorba laments the futility of death.\nOn a rainy day, Basil and Zorba come home and find Madame Hortense waiting. She expresses anger at Zorba for making no progress on the wedding. Zorba conjures up a story that he had ordered a white satin wedding dress, lined with pearls and adorned with real gold. Madame Hortense presents two golden rings she had made and proposes their immediate engagement. Zorba tries to stall, but eventually agrees with gusto, to Basil's surprise.\nSome time later, Madame Hortense has contracted pneumonia, and is seen on her deathbed. Zorba stays by her side, along with Basil. Meanwhile, word has spread that \"the foreigner\" is dying, and since she has no heirs, the State will take her possessions and money. The poor villagers crowd around her hotel, impatiently waiting for her demise so they can steal her belongings. As two old ladies enter her room and gaze expectantly at her, other women try to enter, but Zorba manages to fight them off. At the instant of her death, the women re-enter Madame Hortense's bedroom en masse to steal her valued possessions. Zorba leaves with a sigh, as the hotel is ransacked and stripped bare by the shrieking and excited villagers. When Zorba returns to Madame Hortense's bedroom, the room is barren apart from her bed (where she lies) and the parrot in her cage.

This one also speeds down and shoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have grown fearful and head for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and orders a third log, which accelerates downhill with such violence that it dislodges the entire contraption, destroying everything. The villagers flee, leaving Basil and Zorba behind.\nBasil and Zorba sit by the shore to eat roasted lamb. Zorba pretends to tell the future from the lamb shank, saying that he foresees a great journey to a big city. He then asks Basil directly when he plans to leave, and Basil replies that he will leave in a few days. Zorba declares his sadness about Basil's imminent departure to England and tells Basil that he is missing madness. Basil asks Zorba to teach him to dance.

In the aftermath of the battle, Zulu tribesmen are shown scavenging the battlefield and collecting rifles and ammunition from the dead soldiers. At a mass Zulu marriage ceremony witnessed by missionary Otto Witt and his daughter Margareta, Zulu King Cetshwayo is informed of the great victory; Witt and Margareta flee when they realize what has happened.\nA company of the British Army's 24th Regiment of Foot is using Witt's missionary station at Rorke's Drift in Natal as a supply depot and hospital for British forces in Zululand. Receiving news of Isandlwana from Natal Native Contingent Commander Adendorff and warnings that 4,000 Zulu warriors are advancing on their position, Lieutenant John Chard of the Royal Engineers assumes command of a force consisting of less than 200 men as he is slightly senior to their nominal commander, Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead. With not enough time to order a full evacuation, Chard decides to stay and fight. He has wagons, sacks of mealie (maize), and crates of hardtack stacked to form a defensive perimeter, gun holes knocked in the hospital walls, and a medical ward set up in Witt's chapel.\nA contingent of South African cavalrymen who had fought at Isandlwana arrive, refuse Chard's pleas to help reinforce the station on the grounds that it is hopeless, and swiftly depart on their horses. Witt, enraged by Chard arming the hospital's patients and ordering them to fight instead of allowing them to be evacuated, persuades the Zulus serving in the Natal Native Contingent to desert. Chard then angrily orders Witt to be locked up in the chapel's supply room after Witt starts drinking heavily and proclaims that none of the soldiers will survive the coming battle.\nThe Zulu impis approach and then charge before quickly retreating under British fire; Adendorff explains that they are trying to find weak points in the station's defenses. Chard permits Margareta to take her father away; the Zulus, recognizing Witt, allow them to pass unharmed. Chard is concerned that the northern perimeter wall is under-defended and realises that the Zulus, aware of this, are preparing to attack the station from all sides. Zulu warriors armed with British rifles also start taking potshots at the soldiers. Throughout the day and night, wave after wave of Zulu attackers are repelled, but the defenders are slowly killed off one-by-one. The Zulus succeed in setting fire to the hospital, and Private Henry Hook rallies the patients to fight them and escape.\nThe next morning, the Zulus approach to within several hundred yards and sing a lament before launching again into their war chant; the British respond by singing the Welsh song \"Men of Harlech\". In the final assault, just as it seems the Zulus will finally overwhelm the tired defenders, the British soldiers fall back to a small redoubt in front of the chapel.

He is abducted and transported to Germany.\nPike wakes up in what looks like a U.S. Army hospital. His hair is graying, and he needs glasses to read. He is told it is May 1950 and he is in post-war occupied Germany. Psychiatrist Major Walter Gerber explains that Pike has been having episodes of amnesia since he was tortured in Lisbon. He advises Pike that his blocked memories have always resurfaced, helped along by a therapy of remembering events prior to Lisbon and then pushing forward into the blank period. Various props including U.S. Army jeeps and uniforms, baseball, and fake letters, newspaper and radio broadcasts, are used to carefully convince Pike that the year is 1950 and that he is among fellow Americans. He is assisted by a German nurse, the dispassionate Anna Hedler. Pike is taken in by the deception. As part of his \"therapy,\" he recounts the critical details of the invasion plans, including the location and the date, June 5, to his eager listeners.\nWhen Pike notices a nearly invisible paper cut he got the day he left for Lisbon, he realizes that he has been deceived. He confirms it by tricking an \"American\" soldier into reflexively snapping to attention in the German manner. He confronts Anna, who admits that the date is June 2, 1944. She was recruited from a concentration camp because she was a nurse and spoke English.\nPike instructs Anna to tell Gerber that he was onto the plot, while he makes a feeble attempt to escape. Quickly recaptured, he states that he realized what was going on soon after waking up due to his paper cut. Gerber does not believe him. After two days of interrogation, however, Pike and Anna convince SS agent Schack, who never believed the deception would work. Schack is sure the invasion will be at the Pas de Calais. Gerber, however, sets the clock forward in Pike and Anna's room so they think it is the morning of June 5, then states that the Germans have been surprised at Normandy. Pike lets his guard down and confirms it. Gerber sends an emergency dispatch, but the weather on June 5 is so bad that Eisenhower postpones the invasion a day (which actually occurred). By midday June 5, Gerber has been discredited and Schack orders his arrest.\nGerber knows that Schack will kill them to cover his own blunder when the Allies do finally land at Normandy. Gerber helps Anna and Pike escape, asking Pike to take his groundbreaking research on amnesiacs with him. When the invasion begins the next morning, he laughs at Schack when he arrives, revealing that he has taken poison and pointing out that Schack will likely be liquidated. Schack pursues the escapees on his own, too hurried to wait for troops.\nThe couple flee to a local minister who (Pike knows) had helped downed RAF pilots escape to nearby Switzerland. The minister is away, but his housekeeper Elsa introduces them to a jovially corrupt German border guard, Sgt. Ernst Furzen. Pike and Anna bribe him with his watch and her rings to get them across the border. Furzen gives Elsa one of the rings. Schack shows up at the minister's after Furzen and the couple have left for the border \u2014 he recognizes Anna's ring on Elsa\u2019s finger and forces her to reveal where they have gone. Schack catches up at the border, but Furzen shoots him and arranges Schack\u2019s body to make it look as if he had been killed while trying to escape himself.\nSafely in Switzerland, Pike and Anna are put in separate cars.
