He has loved many women, and has been loved back by many of them. Several of these ladies have left the domestic security provided by their husbands in order to further pursue a relationship with Gresham, despite Gresham's own advise to the contrary. As his lovers compete over him, Gresham uses his love life as inspiration for a series of cynical novels. Each of his novels described the events of one of his love affairs.Early in the film, Gresham is found dead at his own writing desk. The rest of the film explores the events which led to his death, covering the last twelve hours in Gresham's life. Gresham dies in New York City, while working on his latest novel, called Frailty. There is a note with Gresham's signature nearby, which suggests that the novelist committed suicide. However, Inspector Quillan, who investigates the death, suspects murder to be more likely. Gresham's former lovers are now suspects and six of these women are found to have been present at Gresham's apartment, the night before his death.The circumstances of their presence are soon explained. One of the women, Carlotta Barbe, had organized a surprise party for Gresham. She invited the Muses of Gresham's novels to attend. Gail Melville attended the party to officially end her relationship with Gresham, before marrying her fianc\u00e9. Gladys Durland had been Gresham's lover for two years, and attended the party to explain her plans to finally leave her husband. Foxey Dennison is also married, but still wanted to have an affair with Gresham. Nan Fitzerald was the inspiration for Gresham's first novel and wanted to see him again. The sixth woman at the party, Jean Sinclair, was apparently never Gresham's lover. Sinclair is a female illustrator, and her relationship with him was professional. She hoped to illustrate Frailty, once the novel was finished. She arrived at the party with Carter Vaughan, her boyfriend.The events following the party are depicted in flashback. All the guests leave for the night, except for Fitzgerald who is drunk and sleeping. She spends the night at the couch of Gresham's apartment. The following morning, Gresham has yet to decide on an ending for his novel. He discusses the matter with Fletcher, his valet, and asks Fletcher to think of an ending. Fitzgerald wakes with a hangover and Gresham instructs her to get some proper sleep in his apartment. He soon discovers that there is a handgun hidden in her purse. Meanwhile, the morning newspaper reports the death of actress Peggy Fanning. Fanning was Gresham's latest lover and the inspiration for Frailty. She had divorced her husband, a fellow actor, in hopes of marrying Gresham. However, Gresham rejected her and had no interest in marrying her. The newspaper reports that Fanning committed suicide in Paris.The flashback continues. Durland visits Gresham to warn him of danger. Her husband has read Gresham's novel about her and recognized his wife in it, due to a \"detailed description of her sexual idiosyncrasies\". Her husband wants to kill Gresham, and Durland tries to convince Gresham to flee with her to escape his wrath. Gresham rejects her offer and her love. He is no longer interested in her. Gresham is next visited by Barbe, who tries to renew her love affair with him. He rejects her and throws her out of his apartment. The next arrival is Sinclair, eager to show her sketches to Fletcher and get an agreement about the illustration of Frailty. Gresham hires her for the illustration of the novel, though he has another motive for the act. He has fallen in love with Sinclair and hopes to pursue a relationship with her.Lyn Durland, Gladys' husband, arrives and threatens to kill Gresham. Sinclair manages to convince the furious Lyn that Gresham is her own lover, and that they are going to marry. Lyn leaves, and the supposed couple embraces. There is a genuine attraction, but Sinclair does not trust Gresham. She flees the apartment, unwilling to become the topic of his next novel. Fitzgerald witnesses the scene and realizes that Gresham has fallen in love with another woman. She decides to leave him, and leave the United States for good. Gresham does not protest, but offers to purchase her handgun first. He is now the owner of the weapon.Trying to finish the novel, Gresham has the idea to end it with a suicide. He discusses the matter with Fletcher, and the conversation turns into the matter of suicide in general. Fletcher informs his employer about Fanning's suicide in Paris, and accuses Gresham of having killed the woman. Fletcher then has a confession for Gresham. He is not a valet, but an actor. \"Fletcher\" is the husband which Fanning cheated on and deserted. He entered Gresham's service in order to get close to him and plot his revenge.

After the trial, Perry presents Bessie with a dog that looks just like the dead animal, and the dog delightedly greets Bessie. Perry states that when the howling suddenly stopped, he searched kennels in the area and found one where a man matching Foley's description exchanged the dog for a lookalike. He gives Bessie the dog and orders her not to tell anyone what really happened.

Liliom approaches Louise and tells her that he knew her father many years ago, and that he was a violent brute. This disgusts Louise, who throws Liliom's gift of a star into the gutter. Liliom follows the sobbing Louise home, where she demands to be alone. Liliom slaps her hand out of frustration before disappearing.\nAs Liliom returns to Heaven, the angels watch as the scales of justice tip toward the devil's side, and the devil begins to inscribe Liliom's name on his tablet. In Heaven, the commissioner is furious at Liliom for breaking the heart of a child, and Liliom responds that one can only love him as he is. Just then the angel-typist excitedly points to a scene happening down on Earth. Louise is then seen telling her mother that Liliom's slap felt like a kiss, and asks if it is possible to receive a slap that does not hurt at all. Julie says yes and the two embrace with tears in their eyes. It is Liliom's love for his daughter which has miraculously made the slap feel exactly like a kiss.

Willis admits to her that John didn't commit suicide, he was murdered, and says that he is willing to tell Robert so, but once at Robert's office he runs away; Sheldon puts out an alert for the police to pick him up. Now, with no other choice, he and Ruth head to the courthouse, where the jury is voting, and find Hazel's attorney. The judge reopens the case to allow Ruth to testify, and Hazel is acquitted.\nThe next morning, Governor Vincent is annoyed that Ruth didn't tell him about the marriage, but understands that the circumstances necessitated it.  With the governor's impeachment trial due to start soon, Jim Lansdale counsels the governor to resign, but he refuses.  Meanwhile, the legislature demands that Attorney General Sheldon resign, but he, too, refuses.\nThe police find Willis and bring him to Robert. Representative McPherson issues subpoenas for Willis and Robert to testify before the committee, where the existence of the typed letter apparently from the governor to John comes out. Willis admits that Daniel made him put the letter into John's files, and then sent him to John to demand the money he lost in John's crash. When John denied he had any money, Willis shot and killed him, and Daniel fixed it to look like suicide.  The whole frame-up, according to Willia, is the work of Jim Lansdale, supposedly the governor's friend and financial backer: ever since the governor vetoed a highway bill that would have made him millions, Lansdale had been working to bring down his old friend.  It was Lansdale who typed the letter on the typewriter in the governor's study.\nAs the committee votes to drop the charges against the governor, Lansdale slowly leaves the room and kills himself.  Afterwards, the governor gives his blessing to the marriage of his daughter and Robert, and they kiss.\n\n\n== Cast ==", "tmdb_id": 136548}, "20998864": {"title": "The Secret of Cavelli", "plot": "\"Carlo Cavelli\" is the professional name of a world-famous dressage rider (Rudolf Forster), who always wears a mask in his public performances and whose real name is unknown.

Soon, Tom and his team prepare the newly named Silver Streak for a well-publicized trial run with Dexter and Ruth aboard as passengers.\nThe new train fails to attain even half of its projected speed of 100 miles per hour (160 km/h), however, and is easily overtaken by a steam-powered freight train. An angry Dexter tells Tyler that all the Silver Streak is good for is an exhibit at the Century of Progress Exposition to help recover his advertising expenses. Tom is baffled by the train's failure since all the engine components worked perfectly during assembly, but Dexter stubbornly insists that the concept will never work.

The monarch therefore plans to urgently change something about this \"bad habit\" and is looking for morally stable allies for her project.\nOne day, Her Majesty is recommended the supposedly modest Baron Neuhaus, on whom her lady-in-waiting, Countess Christl Palm, has cast an eye. In order to score points with the Empress, the young Baron Neuhaus follows some of the advice of the young Toni, who serves as a chambermaid for Countess Palm. Baron Neuhaus wants to thank Toni for this one night and climbs through an open window into a room where chambermaid is laying. When a guard notices the open window and footprints leading to the room, he sounds an alarm. With difficulty and hardship, Neuhaus is able to escape and hides in a barrel. Promptly it starts to pour, the barrel fills up, and the young Baron Neuhaus becomes soaking wet. On the way home, he accidentally leaves behind a robe borrowed from Toni, which her uncle, the K.u.K. stove heater Stockel, a well-laved, small man of advanced age.\nAs a result, the case provokes an open discussion in the highest circles. The Empress suspects that this is another moral monster and, on the advice of Countess Palm, commissions Baron Neuhaus, of all people, who is appointed judge, to investigate this case. The poor, innocent Stockel becomes the center of the suspicion due to the coat that he left behind. Neuhaus eventually confesses to Countess Christl that he himself was the \"sinner\". After the confession to the countess, he then goes to the empress to admit his guilt. Christl arrives and claims that Neuhaus climbed into Toni's room to get to her from there. He had allowed him to do so, and everything had been done perfectly modestly. Maria Theresa, who at the time was receiving the homages on the occasion of her birthday, commissions to hold a great equestrian festival. Following the completion of the tournament, Christl is awarded a ring. By the ancient tradition, the winner is allowed to pass the ring on to the man she loves. And so Baron Neuhaus becomes the next barer of the jewel and can therefore soon free the Countess, which creates a scandal in the Empress's chambers, but is being quilled.", "tmdb_id": 80964}, "21172552": {"title": "Zouzou (film)", "plot": "Zouzou and Jean are presented in the Cirque Romarin, a traveling circus, as 10-year-old twins: she's dark, he's light.
