Arabella suggests John paint a portrait for Chandler, suggesting he would receive an impressive commission. John laughs at the idea, not believing Chandler to have a genuine appreciation for art. After examining the Beaugard, Arabella devises a scheme to win Chandler's interest in John's work: they'll replace the Beaugard with an almost perfect copy of it John painted in art school, since they can find no obvious differences. After the painting is unveiled at the party, they will surprise everyone and hopefully convince Chandler to hire John. Arabella asks Ravelli to switch the paintings. Meanwhile, another weekend party guest, Grace Carpenter thinks up the same idea with her friend Mrs. Whitehead, as a means of humiliating Mrs. Rittenhouse.

The guests, now in an uproar, scatter and attempt to find the stolen painting, led by Capt. Spaulding. John and Arabella discuss the excitement of the situation and their love for each other (\"Why Am I So Romantic?\").\nThe next day, a police squad arrives to secure the house and search for the missing painting. Realizing that they may have gone too far, Mrs. Whitehead and Grace ask Hives for the Beaugard he took back, but he can't find it anywhere. Mrs. Whitehead deduces the Professor must have stolen it. After confronting him she gets Grace's copy back. Later, John finds Grace's copy of the Beaugard and reveals to Arabella that someone else must have had the same idea to switch paintings.

Daisy agrees \u2013 reassuring Mrs. Vibart that Jack would never be happy married to a girl like Daisy.\nBack at the theater, Lulu, one of the other Florodora girls, discusses Daisy\u2019s broken engagement and claims Daisy dumped Jack because he\u2019s broke.  Fanny invites Lulu outside to tell her something important while Maud guards the door.  The pair step outside and screaming is heard. When they return it\u2019s clear Fanny has beaten Lulu.  Fanny and Maud walk away to comfort Daisy.  Later, Jack begs to speak with Daisy, but she refuses.  Instead, she goes to a slumming party at the bowery with Harry Fontaine \u2013 the gambler who accosted her at the football game.  Harry encourages Daisy to drink, but she is reluctant and melancholy. However, when she spots Jack entering, she lights up, grabs the bottle, jumps on the table, and pretends to be having a grand time.  Jack confronts Daisy, asks why she is acting that way and pleads for her to listen. She rebukes him harshly saying she was only interested in his money.  When he reluctantly leaves, she breaks down in tears.\nFour months later, the Florodora girls are offstage preparing to perform.  Fanny and Maud tell Daisy they are engaged and show off their rings.

There is no narrative continuity, only a series of musical numbers alternating with \"blackouts\" (brief comedy sketches with abrupt punch line endings) and other short introductory or linking segments.\nThe musical numbers are diverse in style, taking a \"something for everyone\" approach to appeal to family audiences by catering to the young, the old and the middle-aged, each in turn. The slow Bridal Veil number, featuring (according to Universal) the largest veil ever made, exhibits Victorian sentimentality that might best appeal to the elderly. The middle-aged were courted with a tune by John Boles in a lush setting crooning It Happened in Monterey in waltz time, or in a barn with a chorus of red-shirted ranch hands belting out the Song of the Dawn. The \"jazzy\" Happy Feet number was designed to appeal to younger viewers.\nOne segment early in the film serves to introduce several of the band's virtuoso musicians (who are not credited by name). Another provides the audience with a chance to see the Rhythm Boys, already famous by sound but not sight because of their recordings and radio broadcasts, performing in a home-like setting. There are novelty and comedy numbers ranging from the mildly risqu\u00e9 (Ragamuffin Romeo, which features contortionistic dancing by Marion Stadler and Don Rose) to the humorously sadomasochistic (the second chorus of I Like to Do Things for You) to the simply silly (I'm a Fisherman). There is a line of chorus girls, practically mandatory in early musicals, but in their featured spot the novelty is that they perform the choreography while seated.\n\nThe grand finale is the Melting Pot of Music production number, in which various immigrant groups in national costume offer brief renditions of characteristic songs from their native lands, after which they are all consigned to the American Melting Pot. Performers from some of the earlier musical numbers briefly reprise their acts while reporting for duty as fuel under the pot. Whiteman stirs the steaming stew. When the cooking is complete, everyone emerges transformed into a jazz-happy American.\nThere are a couple of early examples of the overhead views later elaborated and made famous by Busby Berkeley, but this film bears little resemblance to his films and other musicals of the later 1930s. It is very much a stage presentation, albeit on a very large stage, and visual interest is maintained only by changes of viewpoint. The cameras do not move. This is not because the Technicolor cameras were heavy and bulky. The cameras used for this early Technicolor process contained a single roll of film and were of nearly ordinary size and weight.\nKing of Jazz was the nineteenth all-talking motion picture filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor rather than simply including color sequences. At the time, Technicolor's two-color process employed red and green dyes, each with a dash of other colors mixed in, but no blue dye. King of Jazz was to showcase a spectacular presentation of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue, so this presented a problem. Fortunately, the green dye Technicolor used can actually appear peacock blue (cyan) under some conditions, but acceptable results in this case would require very careful handling. Art director Herman Rosse and production director John Murray Anderson came up with solutions. Tests were made of various fabrics and pigments, and by using an all gray-and-silver background the bluish aspect of the dye was set off to best advantage. Filters were also used to inject pale blues into the scene being filmed. The goal was to produce a finished film with pastel shades rather than bright colors. Nevertheless, as it appears in an original two-color Technicolor print, the sequence might best be described as a \"Rhapsody in Turquoise\". Later prints made from the original two-component negative, which had survived, make the blues look truer and more saturated than they appeared to audiences in 1930.\nKing of Jazz marked the first film appearance of the popular crooner and singer Bing Crosby, who, at the time, was a member of The Rhythm Boys, the Whiteman Orchestra's vocal trio. Crosby was scheduled to sing \"Song of the Dawn\" in the film but a motor accident led to him being jailed for a time and the song was given to John Boles.Composer Ferde Grof\u00e9, best known for his Grand Canyon Suite, was, in these early years, a well known arranger/songwriter for Whiteman. He is documented to have arranged some of the music, and may in fact have composed some of the incidental music.\nThe film preserves a vaudeville bit by Whiteman band trombonist Wilbur Hall, who does novelty playing on violin and bicycle pump, as well as the eccentric dancing of \"Rubber Legs\" Al Norman to the tune of Happy Feet.\nThere were at least nine different foreign language versions of the film. Reportedly, the Swedish version has at least some different music.", "tmdb_plot": "Made during the early years of the movie musical, this exuberant revue was one of the most extravagant, eclectic, and technically ambitious Hollywood productions of its day.

The poker used to commit the murder was at Diana's feet, but she has no memory of what happened during the minutes the crime was committed. The two young women were thought to have been rivals, and the police arrest her. Diana withholds some important information deliberately, to protect something about the identity of a man that she will not name.\nAt her trial most of the jury are certain she is guilty. One or two feel that she may have a severe mental illness which meant that she really did have no memory of killing the other woman, but they are convinced that she should still be hanged lest she strike again. One juror, Sir John Menier (Herbert Marshall), a celebrated actor-manager, seems sure she must be innocent, but is brow-beaten into voting \"guilty\" along with the rest of the jury. Diana is imprisoned, and awaiting hanging.\nSir John feels responsible, as he was the one who had recommended that Diana take the touring job in order for her to get more life experience. It also turns out that Diana has been a fan of his since childhood. She is beautiful, and seems far too honest and straightforward to be a criminal of any kind. Using skills he has learned in the theatre, Sir John investigates the murder with the help of the stage manager Ted Markham (Edward Chapman) and his wife Doucie (Phyllis Konstam). They narrow the possible suspects down to one male actor in the troupe, Handel Fane (Esme Percy), who often plays cross-dressing roles.\nDuring a prison visit with Baring, Sir John learns Fane's secret: he is a half-caste, only passing as white, and Druce threatened to expose him. Later, Sir John cunningly tries to lure a confession out of Fane, by asking him to audition for a new play that Sir John has written, on the subject of the murder. Fane realizes that they know he committed the crime, and that they understand how and why he did it. Fane leaves the audition without confessing, and goes back to his old job; he is a solo trapeze performer in a circus. Sir John and the others go there to confront him again. During his performance, from his high perch he looks down and sees them waiting. Despairing, he knots his access rope into a noose, slips it over his head and jumps to his death. Afterwards, Sir John and Markham discover Fane had written a confession to the murder before his suicide.\nWe then see Diana, free, and gloriously dressed in white furs, entering a beautiful room and being welcomed warmly by Sir John, who receives her as if he loves her.

After a year together, Lisa has their child, a boy; but after another year of marriage, Fedya tires of the monotony of home life and resumes his profligate ways. He is tortured by his conscience for mistreating Lisa, but he fails to reform his behavior. Finally, his reckless social life results in gambling debts so large that he is forced to sell his estate. Despite Fedya's deplorable actions, Victor displays an act of enduring friendship and helps him by purchasing the estate at auction for the greatly inflated price of 125,000 rubles.\nWhile his marriage to Lisa continues to crumble, Fedya becomes infatuated with a young \"Gypsy\" woman, Masha (Ren\u00e9e Ador\u00e9e), and they begin living together in a \"cheap boarding house\". This leads him to make a final break with Lisa by sending her a suicide note and then faking his death. Masha assists him in the ruse by placing some of his clothes and his \"pocketbook\" on a riverbank. Fedya then goes into hiding, leaving family members and friends to conclude that he had deliberately drowned himself since they knew he could not swim. The deception is further enhanced by sheer coincidence when authorities a week later pull out of the river the body of another man who had actually drowned there. Lisa is brought in by police to identify the badly decomposed corpse.

The Chief obliges him to do so.\nThe Chief is then approached by Dagwan, the tribe's corrupt medicine man (played by Chief Awakanush). He ridicules Baluk behind his back and requests \"another squaw\" for himself, implying that he wishes to bed Chetoga's daughter, Neewa. The Chief declines his offer and suggests he look towards a group of jolly spinsters nearby.\nMeanwhile, the Chief's daughter Neewa (played by Molly Spotted Elk) is cornered by a bear and nearly forced off the edge of a cliff and into a river. As soon as he arrives, Baluk slays the bear and captures the bear cubs, adding to Neewa's affection towards him. He returns to the village and gifts the cubs as pets for the Chief's other child, his young son Cheeka (played by Cheeka).\nSoon, the adults of the tribe go merrily on a hunt; Cheeka, the son of the Chief, is eager to help but is told by Baluk that he is too young to join. Cheeka still makes a daring attempt to join them, paddling a canoe, with a basket containing his bear cubs behind him, but upon reaching the hunters, he is told to return home. As the days pass, the hunt is fruitless. At last, the hunters and Baluk returns to the Chief with nothing.\nDagwan rejoices in Baluk's failure, saying a \"good hunter\" would have found food here. Hoping to gain more influence over Baluk, he secretly slays an elk using dark magic. He brings prove his superiority. The tribe rejoices in the meat. During the feast, Neewa privately comforts Baluk by dismissing Dagwan as a threat, insinuating that one lucky kill does not make him a great hunter. Jealous, Dagwan becomes yet more cruel in his plan to take power from Baluk.\nDuring Council, the Chief recalls that, in the past, 6 years of abundance inevitably lead to a 7th year of famine. Nevertheless, Baluk inspires the tribe to march north for the crossing of the caribou, where they can hunt and feed on thousands of the fauna. The Chief approves it, while Dagwan ridicules and demeans Baluk's idea.\nThe tribes marches north and finds more barren lands and bitter cold. This pattern repeats again and again, each time with a worse result. During the marches, multiple members of the tribe die from the cold and starvation.\nAs the tribe is desperate for food, the Chief announces that he must meditate on a solution. Baluk and Dagwan help him to a solitary mountain, where he sits for days watching the sun rise and sun set as he meditates on a solution. He asks them not to find him until his prayers have manifested food for the tribe. He appears to be dressed little else besides a fur blanket despite the snow and cold.\nThe Chief returns and is nursed back to health by Dagwan and Neewa. Weakly, the Chief describes a vision of marching animals and a wolf growling at the sky, which Dagwan insists means that Baluk has led the tribe to doom and turning back is necessary. Despite Dagwan's explanation, the Chief continues to obey Baluk.\nSecretly searching for ways to turn the tribe against Baluk, Dagwan goes south and encounters another tribe's cache during a snowstorm. He pauses, aware that stealing food from other tribes is prohibited, but decides that it would be justified if the cache was presented as a supernatural event. Knowing his tracks would be erased from the snowstorm, he steals some meat for himself and later leads the tribe to it, pretending a large cache of meat is a prophecy he saw in a vision that would reward them for going south and disobeying Baluk. However, a wolverine fouls the carcasses in the cache (presumably with urine), ruining Dagwan's plan. Dagwan quickly explains this was their punishment for going north.\nAs the marches north continue, the Chief realizes he is weak and soon to die. A heartfelt scene shows his passing, as he rises to his feet and demands the items he wishes to have in the afterlife, including his war bonnet and hunting bow, and a vision that shows him crossing over to the other side. His last words include a command to move north and for Baluk to be the next Chief of the tribe.\nAfter the Chief's passing, Baluk instructs Neewa and the tribe to keep mourning to a minimum in order to keep marching north, so as to honor the late Chief's last wishes. He inspires the hunters to set up smoke signals, to ignite once the caribou are hopefully spotted.\nEven as Chief, Baluk struggles to remain in power due to Dagwan's manipulation of the tribe. At last, Dagwan convinces the Ojibwes to use Baluk as the scapegoat for their hunger and suffering since their journey north. He libelously blames Baluk for every father, mother, and child's death, and soon performs supernatural bending of the elements such as smoke-bending to awe the tribe. He announces that the Great Spirit has commanded for a person to be sacrificed, and he declares it should be the Chief, Baluk. The tribe grimly sides with him and they begin to chant and search for Baluk.\nBaluk laments his fate with Neewa when they hear the tribe chanting for his death. Baluk accepts that this is his end, and he steps out to meet Dagwan. With mirth, Dagwan asks him how he wishes to be executed. Baluk tells Dagwan he wishes to die by fire, as an Ojibwe chief should. Drummers perform and the entire tribe gathers to watch as Baluk sits atop a large stack of wood, playing an instrument and crying as he prepares for his painful death. The fire encircles him, burning him, and he throws a tarp over himself possibly to abate the pain. Dagwan sneaks glances at Neewa and Cheeka, who are sobbing with horror. Suddenly, a smoke signal ignites - the caribou are crossing just as Baluk foretold. Immediately, the tribe runs over the wood to rescue Baluk from the fire, and though his chest and face appear to be painfully burned, he fights to stand upright and help capture the caribou with the rest of the tribe.\nThe hunters gather to spear the caribou, which turns out to be much more difficult than expected, as there are thousands of them in hordes causing them to be difficult to distract or kill. Cheeka fires a distant bow and arrow and kills a caribou, presumably his first kill. He runs to the carcass to fetch his arrow and check whether the animal is dead, but he is soon trapped by a stampede that nearly kills him. Baluk runs in to rescue Cheeka and bring him back to the tribe. For 6 days, the caribou migrate by the thousands.\nDagwan knows that he has wronged the tribe and awaits his sentence. At last, Baluk arrives to discuss his punishment, particularly for doing evil in the name of the Great Spirit. He reminds him the penalty for this is not an honorable death like fire, but \"the slow death,\" and Dagwan reproachfully accepts. As per tradition, Dagwan is exiled to the barren lands with no food and no weapons. A final shot shows him wandering through an empty, snowy plain, looking around but seeing nothing before him.\nA splendid, warm feast after the famine occurs. The new village has been constructed from the skin of the caribous, and roasted meat hangs in the forefront of the circles. Toddlers and older adults eat, laugh, and sing songs.

Simon is summoned for a meeting. Expecting to be fired, he is shocked when it turns out that Faulkner has somehow learned of his ideas for saving the company and is promoting him to general manager, replacing Trundle. Simon soon has the company back on its feet. When Wyeth returns from a business trip, he is unimpressed by Simon's promotion. Simon, believing Wyeth has stolen Doris's affections, asserts his authority by punching Wyeth in the face several times.\nThen Faulkner has another surprise for him. He introduces Simon to his daughter Julia, who turns out to be Doris. Julia explains that they had suspected Trundle of undermining the company, but could not examine the books without alerting him. So she instead examined the ledgers that Simon brought home to work on, which confirmed the sabotage.
