The man is beckoned into a building by younger people who tell him that he will have fun, but upon entering, it is a claustrophobic room where elders are forced to perform in uncomfortable exercise machines. He leaves, but breaks his glasses in the process. He comes upon a fortune teller and witnesses a young couple enter and ask what their future will be like. The fortune teller shows them that they will be living in a soon to be built over apartment building where they will have little support from their personal doctor and neighbors. Angry, the young man leaves and punches the older man who collapses.\nWhen the man comes to his senses, the park is empty save for three bikers who beat him and then take his tickets. As people suddenly appear, they all ignore him. With very little money, he goes to get first aid. The medical center, set up like a store, is full of various elders equipment and the doctors and nurses hastily rush everyone through. The man finds himself simply getting a band aid on his head and a cane and is ushered out. He comes upon some men trying to sell retirement homes and ends up getting pick-pocketed. The pick-pocket is revealed to run a freak show, which simply consists of elders dressed in casual clothing. Everyone is upset and as the man gets up to leave, is suddenly chased by the patrons who accuse him of trying to escape the freak show. He finds \"sanctuary\", but it closes upon his arrival.\nThe man finally gets some solace when a little girl offers for him to read The Three Little Pigs to her and have some chicken. The mother apathetically takes her and the book away as he finally breaks down into tears. He leaves the piece of chicken behind and walks back to the white room; resigned and defeated. Moments later, a cleaner optimistic version of himself enters as the scene from the beginning repeats. The man sits tired and powerless over not being able to stop his younger self.\nMaazel appears one last time to tell the viewer that they can help the elderly through already established programs.

Donovan accepts a down payment and promises to pick up the valuables. The next day, Donovan realizes he has been duped into taking care of three little orphans, Bobby, Clovis, and Celia Bradley.

Amos and Theodore continuously try to rob Donovan during his stay in town to miserable results.\nBobby, Clovis, and Celia decide to help their guardian make money by going to the gold mine that they inherited. They come across Amos and Theodore at their hideout and become acquainted. They direct the kids to the mine after mistaking them for a posse. Despite the gold veins drying up years previously, the Bradley children end up finding a massive gold nugget. This incentivizes many people to adopt the children as it would give them access to the gold. Fearing that the people would not have the children's best interests at heart, Donovan has arranged a sham marriage with Dusty so she can keep custody of the Bradley children while he goes to New Orleans.

Frank impersonates a priest to gain more information about the transportation of the gold from Colonel T.R. Clydesdale (David Wayne). Frank is able to coerce Colonel Clydesdale into disclosing the time and place the nugget will be moved. The children, who have grown attached to Donovan and Dusty, go to Theodore and Amos and give them permission to steal the gold.

Desperate to make ends meet and start over, he collaborates with activist Masaru Koga and his former employee Hiroshi \u014cshiro in an elaborate plot to extort money from the government.\nHikari 109 is a high-speed 0 series bullet train carrying 1,500 passengers from Tokyo to Hakata. Shortly after the train's departure, railway security head Miyashita is notified by Okita that a bomb has been planted aboard and will explode if the train slows down below 80 km/h. As proof of the bomb's efficiency, Okita tells Miyashita that a similar bomb has been placed on freight train 5790 bound from Y\u016bbari to Oiwake. When freight train 5790 indeed explodes, Hikari 109's conductor Aoki is informed by Shinkansen director Kuramochi not to slow down the train below 120 km/h while the security personnel aboard the train search for the bomb - thus delaying the trip to Hakata by three hours. Police officials back in Tokyo are tasked to either find the bomber or the bomb first.\nBack aboard Hikari 109, passengers start becoming weary and demand for the train to stop when security does a second search. For the duration of the journey, Kuramochi must coordinate with Aoki on timing the train's speed and position to avoid incoming traffic while keeping it safe from the speed-sensitive detonator. Okita calls the National Railway authorities again; this time, he demands US$5 million in an aluminum suitcase in exchange for the safety of Hikari 109's passengers. As the Prime Minister prepares the ransom, police find their first lead when a cigarette pack containing fingerprints of Koga are found at Y\u016bbari station prior to freight train 5790's departure.\nMeanwhile, passengers aboard Hikari 109 start to panic when the train passes through Nagoya, with a pregnant passenger named Kazuko Hirao going into labor. As a means of settling down the passengers, co-engineer Kikuchi tells them of the bomb on board. National Railway officials are in further disdain when they realize that the bomb is attached to one of the train's wheels. Okita once more calls the officials and tells them to send the money northbound via helicopter and land at Yorii High School. Officer Senda, who carries the suitcase, is then instructed to cross the Arakawa River; upon reaching Iwate, the suitcase is roped and pulled up a cliff by \u014cshiro. However, \u014cshiro is forced to drop the case and retreat when police yell at a university judo team jogging nearby. Fleeing via motorcycle, \u014cshiro finds himself tailed by several squad cars until he collides with one and is killed after hitting a light post.\nThe passengers once again panic when a businessman threatens to pull the emergency door latch open as the train passes through Shin-\u014csaka; they are further exacerbated when they hear of \u014cshiro's death on the radio. Meanwhile, police locate Koga, but fail to arrest him, despite wounding him during the chase. Koga limps back into Okita's hideout to have his gunshot wound tended. Okita ponders on giving up his mission, as he has failed to prevent any bloodshed, but Koga convinces him to carry on. As police trace the bomb parts to Okita's former company in Shimura, Okita makes another phone call and tells Miyashita to drop the money at an abandoned truck by the Kanda motorway in 10 minutes. After the police do as instructed, Okita takes the suitcase and makes his getaway. Back aboard the train, Kazuko loses her baby in a miscarriage and is in need of a blood transfusion. Okita then calls Miyashita and tells him to pick up a diagram of the bomb at Sun Plaza cafe in Shinbashi. Unfortunately, the cafe is destroyed in a fire by the time police arrive. When the police surround Okita's hideout, Koga blows himself up with a stick of dynamite rather than turn himself in.\nWith no other options left, Kuramochi goes on television to make an appeal for Okita to help them disable the bomb. On the train, Shinji Fujio, a former accomplice of Okita being escorted after his arrest, reveals that Okita is on his way out of Japan using a false name. With the help of high-speed cameras, the Shinkansen authorities manage to locate the bomb underneath the second coach. Kuramochi relays the information to Aoki and sends a rescue train to provide welding equipment to cut an access hole where the bomb is. Aoki succeeds in defusing the bomb, but the authorities suspect a second bomb located elsewhere underneath the train. Despite this, the government gives the order to stop the train. Aoki manages to stop Hikari 109 without incident. As Kuramochi leaves the main control room to regain his composure, he discovers that his appeal is still being broadcast on TV. Miyashita explains that this is part of the police's trap for Okita.

Capone, then a young hoodlum, had tipped them off to the heist so that he could ambush the cops on arrival. The resulting fight ends with Capone being thrown through a glass window, leaving him with a scarred left cheek. Capone is soon released from custody without being charged due to the intercession of a senior police lieutenant. As he walks out of the station, the hoodlum is taken to see racketeers Johnny Torrio and Frankie Yale. It is revealed that the fur thieves worked for Johnny and Yale, and because Capone has impressed them with his cunning and brutality, they invite him to join the Five Points Gang.\nA year later, on September 23, 1919, Johnny talks with his boss \"Big\" Jim Colosimo about Prohibition \u2013 a new law banning the sale of alcohol. Johnny is eager to invest millions into bootlegging, but Colosimo, seeing such a trade as beneath him, refuses. Johnny calls Frankie and tells him to send Capone to Chicago to employ him as an enforcer for Colosimo. Johnny introduces Capone to co-workers, including dancer and barmaid Iris Crawford. Johnny, despite his affection for Colosimo, realizes that murdering him is the only way to put his bootlegging scheme into action. The next morning, as Colosimo enters a restaurant to use the phone, Capone sneaks in and quietly shoots the boss dead in the back of the neck.\nOn June 7, 1920, in Joliet, Illinois, during a pickup of beer for bootlegger Edward \"Spike\" O'Donnell, mobsters led by brothers Frank and Peter Gusenberg \u2013 enforcers working for Dion O'Banion \u2013 intercept the deal, gun down the participants, and steal it for themselves. Capone correctly suspects that Banion's henchman Hymie Weiss is responsible, and Johnny responds by dividing Chicago into separate territories: O'Banion and his men will control the North Side, Spike O'Donnell will have his own territory in the South Side, the Genna brothers will deal in Little Italy; and Johnny's gang, the \"Chicago Outfit\", will occupy the Loop and part of the South Side.\nOn September 5, 1923, as Capone and Johnny prepare to shift their base of operations to Cicero, Spike O'Donnell is gunned down by O'Banion's men in a turf war. At O'Donnell's funeral, O'Banion threatens to murder the Genna brothers next. That night, Pete and Frank personally gun down several blood relatives of the Genna's. Outraged, Antonio and Angelo Genna retaliate by placing a hit on O'Banion. Corrupt Chicago deputy sheriff Joe Pryor breaks up one of Capone's parties after Capone refuses to pay him a bribe of $5,000; Capone has no choice but to pay him then. Capone then takes Iris golfing while his hitmen murder O'Banion in a flower store. Capone and Johnny later show up at his funeral, angering Weiss who suspects them of killing his friend.\nOn the night of January 15, 1925, Johnny tells Capone that, because of all the heat Capone has brought on them by committing countless acts of violence in public, he is prepared to give Weiss most of their territory as a peace offering. Capone is furious at the idea but does not stop Johnny from leaving. At the meeting spot, Johnny is ambushed by Weiss and three gunmen, who shoot him multiple times. Johnny survives but accepts that he no longer has any stomach for a life of crime. He decides to leave America for his homeland of Italy, giving control of the Outfit to Capone.\nOn the night of April 27, 1926, Capone and his button men ambush four of Weiss' men, plus a crooked State's Attorney on Weiss' payroll, at a Cicero inn on the mistaken assumption that Weiss is with them. Two of the men and the State's Attorney are killed. Capone then hears a newscast on the radio revealing that Weiss is still alive. Capone is brought before District Attorney Robert E. Crowe, who threatens to have Capone indicted by a grand jury for assassinating a government official. Capone replies that if he does so, his lawyers will reveal the extent to which Chicago authorities have worked with the Outfit; a humiliated Crowe drops the charges.

Capone is saved only due to the quick thinking of his ambitious bodyguard Frank Nitti. Identifying one of his attackers as Weiss, Capone retaliates by ordering a hit on Weiss that night; two men from a rooftop over the North Side headquarters unload their tommy guns into Weiss and his men, killing them. Joe Aiello, a bootlegger who refuses to deal with Capone and blames him for his brother's death, meets with Bugs Moran, Weiss' successor. They pay off a waiter to poison Capone when he goes to his favorite restaurant, but the man has a change of heart and betrays them to Capone. The next morning, Aiello is killed by a car bomb planted by Nitti.\nOn February 7, 1929, Capone decides to get rid of Moran's gang. That night, as he and Iris share a French dinner, hitmen sent by Moran shoot up the bistro, and Iris is killed. Capone is deeply heartbroken by Iris's death, and he and Nitti swear revenge. Newly elected Mayor Anton Cermak and the city council, wanting to improve Chicago's image and put a stop to gang violence, insist that he end his feud with Moran at any cost even if it means losing territory and money. When Cermak threatens Capone by saying he can withdraw the political protection that keeps him from being prosecuted, Capone once again reminds the council that the vast trove of evidence he has of their corruption makes him untouchable by the law.\nThe next morning, on February 14, 1929, Capone's men, posing as police officers conducting a raid, enter one of Moran's warehouses and force seven men, including the Gusenberg brothers, to line up against the wall before machine-gunning them to death. Nitti, believing that Capone has finally gone too far, betrays him and provides the city council with the means to have him brought to trial. On June 16, 1931, after a lengthy process, Capone is finally found guilty not of murder, bootlegging, or any other serious crimes, but of multiple counts of federal tax evasion. The judge sentences Capone to serve eleven years at Alcatraz in San Francisco, California.\nOn February 2, 1938, a doctor visits Capone, whose health has started to deteriorate, and concludes that Capone has contracted syphilis. Noting that the disease has progressed too far for treatment, he warns the prison authorities that the gangster's mind will be the first thing to go. Capone starts a prison riot and is hastily forced back into his cell.\nAt Capone's estate in Palm Island, Florida on April 5, 1946, Nitti visits Capone and his caretakers only to find that Capone is now a shell of his former self, to the point where he starts yelling at Nitti believing him to be an FBI agent. Nitti's bodyguard reminds him that people have always said Capone used to be a smart man, but Nitti \u2013 who had shown his ambition and loyalty only to watch Capone destroy everything they built \u2013 finally disregards this and expresses his true feelings about his old boss, saying that Capone was stupid and forgetful and only cared about killing people.

Parimal develops an inferiority complex thanks to Sulekha's excessive praise of her jijaji and decides to prove that he is in no way a lesser mortal.

While recovering from being drugged, he fires his gun randomly in a fit of madness, and is brutally shot to death by the arriving police (who were either called in or alerted by the gunshots going off) after shooting one of the officers dead in his stupor. All of Harlem celebrated the death of Managan.\nRabbit's final target is the Godfather (Al Lewis), a grotesque crime boss who lives in the subway with his wife, daughter, and his cross-dressing, gay (and possibly incestuous) sons.

Kuno then arranges a deal with Kaida in exchange for Hirotani: the Kawade family will be disbanded, Hirotani and Tsukahara will be given light prison sentences, and Kaida will admit that Kuno was correct about how to deal with the gang. If he refuses, he will leave and threaten to expose the corrupt officers in the police force, himself included.\nKaida accepts the deal and Hirotani has his men surrender themselves and their weapons.

The bomb rolls off a counter and explodes during the harried robbery. A caption explains that under Penal Code 236 a person will be sentenced to a minimum of five years in prison for robbery with the threat of violence.\nThe film cuts to members of the Haneda family informally gambling in a residence. Despite protests from Takeshi's wife Shizuko, Kuniyoshi convinces Takeshi and another member of the clan to join him in murdering the boss of the rival Shonankai family and then to turn themselves in, promising that this act will bring them respect and that they will be promoted to the head of the Haneda family when they are released from prison. When they leap out to surprise the opposing entourage, Takeshi's gun is knocked from his hand and the clip falls out. He fumbles to put it back together as the opposing group fires back on his crew and fixes it in time to catch the boss and shoot him down at the back of his car. A caption explains that under Penal Code 199 murderers can receive the death penalty, life in prison, or a minimum sentence of three years.\nTakeshi is released after spending eight years in prison, where he is met by Kuniyoshi and Shizuko. They take Takeshi to the Makuradate Hot Springs, where Kuniyoshi tells him that their family's boss will be swearing an oath of brotherhood with the new boss of the Shonankai family and Takeshi should not return to Osaka because it will complicate things. This makes it impossible to promote Takeshi for the murder and his jail time because he killed the boss of what will now be an affiliated family. Takeshi says that he will not seek advancement in the family and will instead live a clean life because it is better for the family.\nAfter Kuniyoshi leaves, Shizuko complains about the family's failure to live up to its promises and reward Takeshi for his actions. Takeshi quickly initiates sex amid Shizuko's warnings to wait. Her wedding ring scratches Takeshi and causes him to bleed. He takes the ring with him and leaves, saying that he has some business to handle and will return in ten days. He tells her to remain at home and to pretend that he is still there with her if the family calls from Osaka.\nTakeshi secretly travels to Osaka and is picked up from the airport by Tetsu, who has brought the preparations and quickly calls in the \"Old Man\" from Amagasaki. These three friends from prison hole up in an unassuming shack, where Takeshi promises that their next heist will bring them a share of ten million yen each. He explains that he does not want to return to jail so they will not be robbing a bank but rather a location where no police will be called, though he refuses to disclose the target without first getting their agreement to participate. Tetsu is immediately excited but the Old Man is concerned about his wife and children and only reluctantly agrees.\nTakeshi travels to the Ogoto Hot Springs and spies on the meeting between the newly befriended families on the waterfront, identifying an unattended speedboat. Meanwhile, the Old Man arrives at their hideout with the diving gear that Takeshi requested and bumps the table where Tetsu is preparing a mixture for tear gas that Takeshi requested, causing it to explode and fill the house.\nThat night the three load the tanks of gas onto the speedboat and ride it to an inn, where Takeshi explains that the two families are now partying following the brotherhood oath ceremony, surely wagering tens of millions of yen on their games. They land the boat and beat down three yakuza wandering near the shore, taking their guns from them and planting bombs on the yakuza's boat. Disguised in diving gear they then rush into the room where the yakuza are gambling and blast it with tear gas, holding the boss of the Shonankai family at gunpoint while they collect as much money as they can in waterproof bags and run back to their speedboat. The pursuing yakuza jump into their boat, which explodes from the bombs planted there earlier. The yakuza instead pursue them by car, but have difficulty driving on the watery shoreline. The three robbers rig their speedboat to continue on its own toward the shore on the other side as they dive into the water with their diving gear and drag the waterproof bags away as the yakuza pursue the empty boat.\nBack in their hideaway shack they count up the money and find that they have stolen more than 350 million yen. Takeshi gives the other two their share and packs away the rest of the money in a single briefcase. Tetsu and the Old Man look on jealously and ask for 50 million yen more each but Takeshi fights them off, saying that none of the money should be spent in order to avoid drawing attention. He leaves to hide the money but the other two suspect that he is attempting to abandon them and run off with the money.\nAt a meeting between the heads of the families, Mr. Haneda explains that he had paid the police to stay away but did not suspect that they would be robbed. He apologizes to the head of the Shonankai family, whose eyes were injured during the fight, and agrees to compensate him for his loss. The head of the Shonankai family does not blame Haneda, stating that it was a random street mugging, but Haneda is passed a list of their losses from that night. After they depart, the Haneda family is angry to discover that the Shonankai family has inflated its losses.\nUnable to go to the police, they instead call Bunmei Noshiro, a known crooked cop who has a young fifth wife and needs money. Noshiro discovers the remnants of the handmade explosives, including scraps of paper with Tetsu's handwriting on them. He negotiates for a reward of one million yen per robber, promising to know who they are in three days. Noshiro notices some gambling in a local restaurant and threatens to arrest the bookmakers if they don't tell him about any suspicious betting activity lately. They tell him that Tetsu, who was in jail for three years for robbing a bank, has wagered three million yen recently and they point him out to Noshiro. Noshiro follows Tetsu to a dance club full of underage hostesses and spots his own young lover Yoko making out with the manager of her old bar, leading to a fistfight. Back at home, the bruised Noshiro argues with Yoko that she is not a kid anymore and that she should stay home, promising to buy her what she wants most with his detective bonus. She demands a three-bedroom condo with a south-facing terrace that costs 35 million yen.\nTakeshi tells Shizuko that he has pawned her ring, then they meet Kuniyoshi at the bar Shizuko runs and Takeshi tells him that he is moving with Shizuko back to Kyushu, where she is from. Kuniyoshi sends Takeshi out drinking with his men and waits for Shizuko on her bed when she arrives home, angrily attacking her for not leaving Takeshi for him as she had promised. When Takeshi returns home and finds them, Kuniyoshi insists that Shizuko is now his since he paid for the apartment and bar and that Takeshi should go to Kyushu alone. Takeshi says that he knew about the affair and tells Kuniyoshi to leave. Shizuko apologizes but Takeshi understands why she did it.\nNoshiro spots Tetsu with a young hostess and follows them to his apartment, where he accuses Tetsu of the robbery and matches Tetsu's handwriting with the sample he collected from the robbery. He brings Tetsu to Mr. Haneda as Haneda is bidding Takeshi farewell from the city and advising him to go straight. Tetsu recognizes Takeshi but Takeshi explains that it was because they were in prison together. Noshiro then recognizes Takeshi as the murderer of the old head of the Shonankai family as he collects his million-yen bounty for Tetsu.\nThe Haneda family tortures Tetsu and attempts to get the names of his family as Takeshi puts on a mask and prepares to kill him to protect the secret, but he is interrupted when another masked man arrives and shoots his way through the Haneda family and rescues Tetsu. Takeshi is caught by Sugi, a member of the Haneda family, but Takeshi promises to show him where the money is, taking him to the shore and showing him the briefcase full of money in his trunk before punching him and escaping onto a boat. Sugi pursues Takeshi, who punches him into the water and shoots him, drawing the attention of others and forcing him to run.\nThe man who rescued Tetsu reveals himself as Bunmei and asks about the actual amount of money stolen but Tetsu escapes, leading him to the Old Man's place. Tetsu convinces the Old Man to work with him against Takeshi, then calls Tetsu and tells him to bring them each 50 million to Cafe Montpamasse in front of Amagasaki by noon the next day or he will call the Hanedas. Bunmei follows them to the meeting spot and calls Mr. Haneda and demands 100 million yen for all three robbers. Bunmei notices Takeshi when he arrives, so Takeshi does not meet the other robbers at the cafe but rather kidnaps a girl and hides in her apartment. Bunmei sees Tetsu pick the lock on Takeshi's trunk and remove the briefcase. Bunmei demands the money but Tetsu and the Old Man run. The Old Man is hit by a car and drops the briefcase, which opens to reveal merely scraps of newspaper. Bunmei finds Takeshi bribing the kidnapped girl with jewelry and Takeshi offers to match Mr. Haneda's offer to Bunmei but Bunmei refuses because he fears Haneda more. Takeshi says that he won't share any of the money and drives away.\nTakeshi returns home to find Shizuko held captive by Kuniyoshi and another Haneda family member, who say that Sugi survived and told them that Takeshi was the lead robber. Shizuko begs for forgiveness and help from both Takeshi and Kuniyoshi in turn. Kuniyoshi threatens to shoot Takeshi, who throws out a locker key as a distraction and tackles the other Haneda family member just as Tetsu arrives and tackles Kuniyoshi, enabling Takeshi to force them all out. Takeshi tells Shizuko that they are splitting up but that he understands why she betrayed him, explaining that he will get a fake passport and take the money abroad. He says that he was lying about them reconciling and moving to Kyushu in order to fool the Haneda family. His final words to her include the lesson he learned in prison that \"we're all alone. The only one you can trust is yourself.\"\nTakeshi drives Tetsu back to the shack as thanks for killing the Old Man for him but Tetsu is still distrusting and demands the money, saying he will kill Takeshi if he is betrayed again. Takeshi retrieves the briefcase from the locker but is caught by Bunmei, who knocks him out and takes the money. Bunmei returns the money but when he asks for his reward he is betrayed by the Hanedas, who knowingly falsely accuse him of stealing since the amount returned does not match the exaggerated amount claimed by the Shonankai family. Bunmei pulls a gun on them but they notify him that he was fired from the police force that day and no longer has protection if he murders them. Bunmei, frustrated that all of his efforts were for nothing, returns home to find Yoko laughing with Takeshi. Takeshi asks Bunmei to join him in taking vengeance on the Hanedas and Bunmei makes him promise not to betray him this time.\nThe police take interest after the murder of Kuniyoshi and Shizuko tells them what she knows. The Hanedas attempt to quickly bag the money and move it as Takeshi arrives to bargain. Takeshi opens the blinds and begins the bag the money himself and when the Haneda enforcers attempt to stop him they are shot through the window by Bunmei. Takeshi forces Mr. Haneda onto the balcony and knocks him out, then he and Bunmei take the money back to the shack, where Takeshi betrays him and pulls a gun. Tetsu runs out of the shack throwing Molotov cocktails and attempts to steal the car full of money but is shot in the process and wrecks the car, dying on top of the bags of money. A saddened Bunmei pulls the bags of money from the wrecked car as Takeshi drives into him, knocking him to the ground. Bunmei, bleeding on the ground, asks Takeshi to tell Yoko that he has gone on a long journey. After Takeshi collects the money and drives away, Bunmei stands up and reveals that he was merely pretending to die because he was already lying on top of all of the money that he needed for the condo.\nAt the airport Takeshi is recognized by the young woman he kidnapped and fears that she will betray him to airport security, but she smiles and touches the pearl brooch he gave her. Takeshi, feeling relieved, throws his gun in the garbage and boards the plane.

After an initial shoot at an abandoned gallery where the painting resides, the developed film shows what seems to be an ectoplasmic presence the crew had not seen when they shot it. When Michael and Joanna return late at night to figure out why this happens, Emily has a nightmare of them in danger, and concurrent with her hysterics, a statue falls, almost killing the couple. The rubble reveals a double-edged sword and a duplicate of Emily's medallion, previously hidden inside. Emily's behavior, in general, becomes more unpredictable, such as taking up smoking and playing piano when she previously had little skill, and unpleasant, particularly towards Joanna. The Countess warns of danger to everyone based on these discoveries and a tarot reading, but Michael dismisses her worry.\nJoanna, sensing that governess Jill has also harbored feelings for Michael, tries to foster conviviality by taking everyone out for an afternoon of play in a cliffside park.

He cannot find any trace of it amid the tumult of rampant construction.\nThe film then flashes back to a topographic surveying expedition to the area of Shkotovo in Ussuri region in 1902 led by the same man, Captain Arsenyev (Yury Solomin). Early in its journey the troop encounters a nomadic Goldi hunter named Dersu Uzala (Maxim Munzuk).  Arsenyev is immediately taken with the man's capabilities as a woodsman, and asks him to become their guide through the harsh frontier. Without a word he takes the lead on the trail the next morning.\nViewed even by the roughhewn cossack soldiers as an uneducated, eccentric old man, Dersu earns everyone's respect through his great experience, accurate instincts, keen powers of observation, and deep compassion. He repairs an abandoned hut and leaves essential provisions of rice, salt, and matches wrapped in birch bark so that a future traveler without them may survive in the wilderness. He deduces the identities and circumstances of complete strangers as he goes by analysing tracks and articles left behind.\nCaptain Arsenyev reduces his party to just four men, sending the rest ahead to a rendezvous point.  Late one day he and Dersu go alone to explore the vast and featureless Lake Khanka.  As dusk approaches they become lost in the frozen expanse when wind squalls erase their tracks back to camp.  With the last rays of light they are overtaken by a sudden blizzard. Dersu directs Arsenyev to quickly cut and gather reeds - as many as fast as he can, as their lives, he warns, depend on it.  Arsenyev complies, with a will, but soon begins to stumble from exhaustion.  Repeatedly he is compelled back into action by Dersu.  Finally he collapses, out cold.  Disoriented in the sun and calm of the next morning, he pieces together that Dersu had built a shelter out of the reeds, dragged him into it, and saved his life.  He is forever indebted to his new friend.\nThe party then continues onward, ravaged in time by fatigue and starvation, barely able to drag its sled. Facing its last, it is halted by Dersu, who sniffs out a Nani family's home by the scent of frying fish. The men are renewed by food, warmth, and hospitality offered by the simple peasants.  With the end of the expedition near, Dersu asks Arsenyev where he will go next. \"Back to Khabarovsk,\" he replies, and invites Dersu to come with him.  Dersu tells him that his place is in the forest and that tomorrow he will go on his way.  Offered pay for his services, he declines, asking only for some cartridges for his rifle to hunt with.  When the party reaches the railroad tracks the next day - which Dersu had only ever heard of before - he takes his leave and returns to the wilderness.\nFive years pass.  In 1907 Arsenyev begins another expedition in Ussuri. He labors mapping mountain ranges for months, all the while holding hope that he will run into his dear friend. One night at camp one of his men says he ran into an old hunter on the trail a bit back who was asking about their unit. Arsenyev rushes anxiously in the man's direction.  Hailing an approaching figure, he is overcome with joy when Dersu answers his call.  That evening the two sit by a fire and catch each other up.  Arsenyev asks Dersu to serve as guide again, and is accepted.\nSome time on Arsenyev divides his party, sending some upstream at river to search for a ford while he and a handful of men attempt to cross on a log raft.  In the chaos of unloading, Arsenyev and Dersu get marooned on the raft and are quickly rushed downstream towards dangerous rapids. Seeing again that Arsenyev does not know how to save his own life, Dersu pushes him off and tells him to swim toward shore. Without even a pole to steer with Dursu makes a desperation leap for the stump of a tree branch midriver a mere moment before the raft is destroyed in a cataract.  He then directs the party to cut a tree which can reach him before his strength ebbs in the torrent.  One after another they point to a trunk, unable to size up either that tree's height or buoyancy, only to have Dersu shout it down. Finally one is acceptable, downed ferociously, and girded at its base with a lash of every belt and harness in the group.  As its thinnest uppermost branches sweep by Dersu he seizes them and is pulled to shore.\nSome time passes, with everyone in good spirits. Pictures are taken with Dersu, variously posing formally, pretending to be in action, and caught casually. Arsenyev writes in his journal that some of his fondest memories of Dersu occurred during the beginning of that autumn.\nA short time later, the troop is trekking through the forest when Dersu realises they are being stalked by an amu, a huge and dangerous Siberian tiger considered sacred to the native peoples. As he had in an encounter with one during the first expedition, Dersu tries to run the animal off by telling it the forest is big enough for both of them, and that it should go its own way. The tiger instead continues to close on Dersu and Arsenyev until Dersu is forced to shoot at it (but misses). Dersu is instantly distraught over doing so. Despite Asenyey's encouragement that the tiger is not injured, Dersu is convinced it will run until dead. He states that Kangnga, the forest deity that his people worship, will be unhappy and will send another amu for him. Shortly after Arsenyev spots a buck, which Dersu fails to even make out.  Directed where to point his rifle by Arsenyev, his shot misses.  Dersu realizes he can no longer provide for himself as a hunter.  Dogged now by twin fears he becomes irritable, yelling at members of the party and distancing himself from Arsenyev.\nUltimately, Dersu appeals to Captain Arsenyev to take him home with him. The nomad quickly discovers how ill-suited he is to living in a \"box\", prohibited from even shooting his rifle to clean its barrel or put up a tent to sleep outdoors, in a place where people pay for water and he gets arrested for trying to chop down a tree in the city park for firewood for the home.  Despite his love for Arsenyev and his family, Dersu tells his \"captain\" he must return to living in the hills.

Corbis captures patriarch Steve Preston, who is allowed to escape to warn his wife Emma and son Mark. He tells them to give the book to Corbis, before melting into a waxy substance. Mark advises Emma to keep the book hidden and entrusts her to family friend John. However, moments after he leaves to meet Corbis, he hears Emma scream and returns to find the Satanists have abducted Emma, leaving John bound, hanging by his feet and terrified.\nIn a ghost town in the desert, Mark challenges Corbis to a battle of faith. Corbis leads Mark to his cult's church where he reveals that Emma has joined them, as reflected by her now eyeless face. When Mark refuses to do the same, he is surrounded and overwhelmed by Corbis's followers.\nSheriff Owens scoffs at John's story of eyeless cultists living in a long-deserted town and refuses to conduct a search for the three missing Prestons, so Mark's older brother, Tom, and his wife Julie search for them on their own. In the ghost town they are attacked by Satanists. After escaping, Tom sends Julie to summon the authorities while he returns to rescue Mark. En route, Julie is captured by a Satanist who was waiting in her car.\nWearing the robe of a defeated Satanist, Tom infiltrates Corbis's church, where Corbis performs a ceremony to convert Mark into one of his eyeless minions. Tom is discovered by the Satanists, but eludes capture. He and Dr. Sam Richards, a psychic researcher, review the book, which explains that the source of Corbis's power is an ornate glass bottle known as \"The Devil's Rain\", which contains the souls of Corbis's disciples. They also find Mark's signature in the book, which Richards is sure was not there the last time Mark had the book.\nTom and Richards head to Corbis's church and remove The Devil's Rain from its hiding place. The Satanists converge on the church, so Tom and Richards retreat, taking The Devil's Rain but leaving behind the book, which is taken by Corbis. As Corbis begins the ceremony to convert Julie to an eyeless one, Tom jumps in to intervene, and is captured as well. Richards threatens to destroy The Devil's Rain, but is overpowered by the Satanists, and Mark takes the Devil's Rain from him. Richards tells Mark that he can still save his soul by destroying the bottle, while Corbis maintains that if the bottle is destroyed Mark will wander through nothingness for eternity, unable to enter either Heaven or Hell. Mark smashes the bottle. The Devil's Rain is released from the bottle, melting the Satanists (including Mark and Corbis) and burning down the church. Tom and Julie make a hasty exit.

He is the new boss of a recently inherited toothpaste factory and the owner of a local Rome basketball team. Nicosia is abusive to his employees and his hunchbacked side-kick Peppino. Nicosia is also extremely superstitious. Peppino is less of a friend than a good luck charm as far as the insensitive Nicosia is concerned. He believes that it brings good luck to rub a hunchback's hump. In one day, a black cat crosses Nicosia's path, and he breaks a mirror in his apartment. Superstition demands that he persuade a virgin to urinate over the broken shards of glass to halt the tide of bad luck. Abusively, he passes a decrepit old spinster who lives next door to him. He mistakenly assumes that she has never done the \"deed.\" Nicosia's relationship with his wife Mariu is scarcely more convivial, for he is also antagonistic towards her.\nReluctantly bowing to family pressure, Nicosia employs his loafing brother-in-law to the factory's menial post. But he fires him the following day after catching the man asleep on the job, snoring loudly. That evening at a family gathering at his apartment, he is accosted by his ungrateful in-laws who try to shame him into giving the feckless man his job back. Instead of acquiescing to family practice, he bursts into an escalating tirade of rudeness against the singer's figure of his Great Aunt Maria. The old woman finally responds to his cynical remarks by uttering a curse. Nicosia dismisses her at first, that is until the old woman threatens to pour oil onto the floor; this heavy-duty bit of magical business breaks Nicosia's nerve, and he recants in a babbling panic. Nicosia grovels for the curse to be lifted, and the old woman refuses to do so.\nA few days later, Nicosia is on a plane to Bucharest, Romania, where he expects to attend a business conference. A man seated nearby introduces himself as Count Dragalescu. After some small talk, he invites the troubled industrialist to visit him at his castle. Upon arriving at the hotel, Nicosia discovers that the conference has been postponed, leaving him stranded for the entire weekend. Another businessman, named Meniconi, tells him that there are no prostitutes in the region and that he has failed to seduce any of the local women. He confides to Nicosia that he has taken to wearing the lingerie, brand named \"Hot Night in Havana\", himself. Rather than spend the weekend in the hotel, Nicosia decides to call on the Count.\nUpon arriving, Nicosia sees that the castle is very much what one would expect from a Romanian nobleman's abode, complete with lighting and thunder to amplify the Gothic effect. Count Dragalescu greets his guest in the cavernous dining hall. Suddenly, a group of revelers staggers down the large staircase into the dining hall. The Count introduces his companions (three women and a man) to the wary guest. The women greet Nicosia in a lavish, tactile manner. When Boris, the screaming camp male of the party, tries to greet Nicosia too, he backs up nervously away and declines. Laughing, the Count sends Nicosia up to his room to prepare for dinner.\nA little later, when Nicosia comes back down the stairs, well dressed in a tuxedo, he finds himself overdressed for the occasion. Very awkwardly, Nicosia sits down at the dinner table near a naked Count Dragalescu and his bevy of naked women. The evening gets even more debauched when Nicosia has a little too much to drink, strips off all his clothes, cavorts with the three nude women of the assembled throng, and then passes out cold. The next morning, he wakes up in his bed with the mirthfully grinning Dragalescu lying next to him. The half-dressed Nicosia runs in horror from the castle and catches the first plane back to Italy.\nBack in Italy and working at his toothpaste company, Nicosia is rather tense and uptight. He greets all his employees who speak to him with a clenched and furious tone. While overseeing his basketball team at practice, he is knocked off balance when the coach tells the team, \"you've got the big one!\" Nicosia repeats the phrase \"big one\" over and over again and then collapses in the locker room when he sees a row of naked men's bottoms in the showers.\nNicosia goes to his physician Dr. Paluzzi, who suggests that he try making out with his mistress, and if he cannot do that, the doctor adds that he must have been \"deflowered while drunk.\" However, this attempt to re-establish his heterosexuality fails because the tormented Nicosia feels compelled to bite her with and suck blood out of her neck.\nEven more stricken, first with anxiety and then with abject self-pity, Nicosia calls on his Great Aunt Maria to beg her to remove the curse which, he assumes, is responsible for his misfortune of homosexuality and blood craving. However, she claims that she had nothing to do with his urge for blood. She recommends that he visit the Magician of Noto in Sicily for help, and he complies in desperation. Upon arriving at the Magician of Noto's residence, Nicosia clearly sees that the magician is a fake from the posture and tone of voice. But Nicosia accepts his advice: the curse on him will be lifted only if he re-hires his brother-in-law. Nicosia leaves, where it is revealed to the viewers that the whole thing was a deliberate stunt organized by his in-laws into tricking Nicosia into giving his brother-in-law his job back. Returning home far from being cured, he responds to his needy wife's sexual advances by plunging his fang-like teeth into her bare bottom during foreplay.\nOver the next several months, Nicosia adopts devil-may-care aggression; he re-fires his lazy brother-in-law, arranges to visit prostitutes to satisfy his urge to bite, and isolates himself from family and friends. Finally, he satiates his craving by setting up a blood bank at his factory site and compelling all employees to attend. Just as he seems to have surrendered to total cynicism, his wife arrives at the factory with a baby, his newborn son that was conceived that night of their passion. Rejoicing at his proof of his potency, Nicosia throws off the shackles of his paranoia and goes to greet and hold his baby son, only to discover in the final shot that the baby sports a protruding pair of fangs.", "tmdb_id": 107122}, "34414128": {"title": "The Dream Makers", "plot": "A university professor with big dreams launches a career in the music industry, eventually running his own record label.

She believes the family's ex-chauffeur is the person who is blackmailing her with the knowledge that she has cheated on her husband. The husband does not care, but his mother, Olivia Devereaux, is the family matriarch and runs the family estate with an unforgiving iron grip.\nEven before his investigation begins, Harper is propositioned in his motel room by a teenaged girl. He sends her away, but later he discovers that the teenager is Iris Devereaux's daughter, Schuyler. Their meeting in the motel room brings Harper to the attention of police chief Broussard and the disagreeable Lieutenant Franks. Broussard accepts Harper's explanation, but tells him he will be following what Harper does, as he has a personal interest in the Devereaux family.\nHarper is abducted by two hoods working for the oil magnate J.Hugh Kilbourne, who thinks Harper might be useful in his efforts to get ownership of some of Olivia Devereaux's oil-rich properties, which she is content to maintain as bird sanctuaries. Harper is noncommittal towards Kilbourne, and the hoods return him to his car. On Harper's return, he learns that the dead body of Olivia Devereaux has just been found and the police's prime suspect is the ex-chauffeur.\nWhile searching for the chauffeur, Harper is abducted again, this time by hoods working for a mysterious woman. He does not have any useful information for her and is released; he later finds out she is Mavis Kilbourne, the wife of the oil magnate. She is working behind her husband's back trying to find an account book containing information of his illicit business dealings, which he is desperate to recover and would kill her over if he knew she had a hand in its disappearance.\nHarper tracks down the chauffeur, Pat Reavis. He finds Reavis with $10,000 in his possession and believes that Reavis was paid to kill Olivia. He calls the police to say that he's bringing Reavis in and makes Reavis drive at gunpoint. En route, Reavis denies involvement in blackmailing Iris and murdering Olivia, claiming he was only at the scene of the murder because he had been having an affair with Schuyler. However, he admits to having information that he expects will yield a lot of money, and offers Harper a share of it if he will let him go. The car they are in is forced off the road by masked gunmen, who shoot Reavis dead but miss Harper, who wounds one of the gunmen. The next day he is informed by Broussard that, mysteriously, there was no report made to the police of any gunfight, but that Lt. Franks has been injured in a \"hunting accident\".\nDespite Iris's pleading with him to give up on the case and go home, Harper continues investigating. He correctly deduces that Reavis came into possession of the missing account book and must have given it to a trusted girlfriend for safekeeping. Knowing that Franks was involved in the killing of Reavis, Harper ambushes Franks in his own home and forces him to admit that he does jobs for Kilbourne. When Harper later confronts Kilbourne with the information, the oil magnate admits to having hired Reavis, but insists it was only to spy on Olivia Devereaux, not to kill her. When Harper tells Kilbourne he knows about the missing account book, Kilbourne offers him a fortune for it, but Harper just walks away.\nThis leads to Kilbourne and his henchman kidnapping Harper and Mavis to find out where the notebook is, torturing them with a fire hose in an abandoned asylum. When Harper refuses to give up any information, Kilbourne leaves them overnight to suffer. During this time, Harper uses their clothes to plug the drain, and he and Mavis flood the room in an attempt to reach the skylight. When the water is finally high enough, they find that they can't break the window, and are near drowning when they are ironically saved by Kilbourne returning to torture them more. Harper gives Kilbourne's gun to Mavis, asking her to watch him while Harper finds a phone to call for help. As Kilbourne brags to Harper that he has too much influence and that he'll get away with it all, shots suddenly ring out. Harper returns to find Kilbourne dead, with Mavis admitting that \"He's right, he would've gotten away with it\".\nReturning to the Devereaux estate, Harper finds that Iris has committed suicide in the night with a combination of sleeping pills and alcohol. Chief Broussard is also there, devastated. Broussard asks Harper, \"Did she tell you about us?\", to which Harper replies, \"She didn't have to\". Harper confronts Schuyler in the bird sanctuary, where she has released all of Olivia's birds into the wild. Harper lays out how Schuyler was behind the whole affair, and she insists that \"they really did a job on\" her father before admitting that she hated both her mother and her grandmother. Harper then reveals that Broussard has been listening the whole time. Broussard lets Schuyler go and lashes out at Harper, before breaking down in tears and confirming that he is Schuyler's real father. Harper tells Broussard, \"That's YOUR kid out there. How are you gonna handle that?\" before leaving.\nHarper visits Reavis' girlfriend, Gretchen, giving her $9200 (the $10,000 he confiscated from Reavis, minus the $800 in expenses he racked up during the case). He asks Gretchen to send the account book to \"the biggest newspaper in New Orleans\".

The director of C2, Dragon, is an albino ex-Nazi confined to semi-darkness and kept alive by blood transfusions. Dragon wants Hemlock to kill two men responsible for the death of another government agent, code name Wormwood. Insisting he is retired, Hemlock refuses until Dragon threatens to expose Hemlock's art collection to the Internal Revenue Service. Hemlock agrees, and travels to Zurich, where he carries out the first sanction for $20,000, twice his usual fee (equivalent to $110,000 in 2021), and a letter guaranteeing no trouble from the IRS.\nReturning from Europe, Hemlock meets C2 courier Jemima Brown, who seduces him, and while he is asleep, steals his money and IRS exemption letter.

Mellough somehow knows a great deal of what Hemlock is planning. He tries to kill Hemlock by hiring George to seduce and drug him, but Hemlock survives. Later, Hemlock lures Mellough and his bodyguard into the desert, shoots and kills the bodyguard, and leaves Mellough to die in the sun.\nHemlock travels to Switzerland with Bowman, the \"ground man\" or supervisor of the climb, and meets the other members of the climbing party at the Hotel Bellevue des Alpes at Kleine Scheidegg.

In the countryside his assistant Lt. Robert Schmied (Donald Sutherland) is found shot dead in his car by the side of the road and B\u00e4rlach takes pains to remove a red folder from Schmied's files. The case is assigned to the young, aggressive detective Walter Tschanz (Jon Voight); Tschanz appears well-informed about the case, but is stymied by Commissioner B\u00e4rlach's revelation that two bullets were found at the scene, unaware that the Commissioner himself had planted the second one. After a disastrous funeral for the late Lieutenant, Tschanz strikes up a stormy romance with Schmied's girlfriend Anna (Jacqueline Bisset).

During the incident, the dog's body disappears. Gastmann's bodyguards force Tschanz off the property and he drives the Commissioner home, who quietly puts away a pistol and a leather bite guard from his arm that the dog had supposedly mauled. Von Schwedi makes a formal complaint the next day to Lutz (Gabriele Ferzetti), the chief of police, and alleges that Schmied's undercover attendance at Gastmann's parties was a spy attempt by a foreign power. As if in confirmation, the Minister of Justice instructs Lutz to stop the investigation of Gastmann, citing his importance to the national economy.\nTschanz is frustrated by the dead end and perplexed by the Commissioner's behaviour, who lives in an unkempt apartment and whose illness appears to be worsening.

At the location of the pay-off, Marlowe is knocked unconscious by an unseen assailant and when he recovers, the police are at the scene and Marriott has been killed. At the police station Marlowe is told that Malloy has fled to Mexico and is warned to stop looking for Velma.\nDeciding to investigate Marriott's death, Marlowe is given a lead on a collector of fei tsui jade named Baxter Grayle, who is a judge and a powerful figure in Los Angeles. At Grayle's mansion he meets Grayle and his wife, the younger and seductive Helen. Helen wants to know who killed Marriott, whom she had known for years, and hires Marlowe to find out.

Marlowe suggests to his police friend Nulty that whoever used Florian to set up Malloy at the motel also got Tommy Ray to supply the fake photograph to send him off on a wild goose chase. Marlowe is convinced that Brunette knows what is going on, so he and Malloy sneak aboard Brunette's gambling boat and confront him. Helen appears and it is revealed she is Velma, a former prostitute under Amthor, who married Baxter Grayle without him knowing about her background. Velma has been working with Brunette to kill off anyone who knows her real identity. Velma shoots Malloy and in turn Marlowe shoots her.

Orders from his superiors send Doyle to Marseille, France, to track down the criminal mastermind and bust his drug ring. Once in France, Doyle is met by English-speaking Inspector Henri Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my (Bernard Fresson), who resents his rude and nasty crimefighting demeanor. Doyle then begins to find himself as a fish out of water in France, where he is confronted with a language he cannot understand. Doyle is shown around the police station where he finds his desk is situated directly outside the toilets. He tells Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my that he is not satisfied with this positioning and hopes it is not a joke at his expense. Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my informs Doyle that he has read his personnel file and is aware of his reputation and especially hopes he has not brought a gun with him as it is strictly forbidden in France for visiting police officers from other countries to carry firearms.\nDoyle continues to struggle with the language and tries to order drinks in a bar. He eventually makes himself understood, befriending a bartender while buying him drinks and they eventually stumble out of the bar together at closing time, followed by two men. The next day, while Doyle is watching a beach volleyball match, Charnier sees him from a restaurant below. Determined to find Charnier on his own, Popeye escapes from what are in fact French police escorts keeping watch on him. Doyle doesn't understand that he is being used as a bait by French police. The same night Charnier sends his men to capture Doyle, killing one of his watchers in the process, and take him to a secluded, seedy hotel in the old quarter for interrogation.\nFor several weeks, Doyle is injected with heroin in effort to force him into capitulation. Scenes of his growing addiction follow, including one in which an elderly lady (Cathleen Nesbitt) visits him in his befuddled state. She talks to him, declaring herself to be English, and saying that her son is \"just like\" him, while stroking his arm. Initially she seems compassionate to his plight, but a change in the camera angle reveals her 'track' marks. The gentle old lady steals his watch.\nMeanwhile, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my has sent police everywhere to search for Doyle. Charnier interrogates a needy Doyle about what he knows, but Doyle says he was sent here just because he is the only one who can recognize him. Charnier believes Doyle, so lets him go after one massive injection. Doyle is dumped barely alive but addicted in front of police headquarters. Grueling scenes of resuscitation and drug withdrawal follow. In his effort to save both Doyle's life and his reputation, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my immediately quarantines Doyle in the police cells and begins his cold turkey withdrawal from the heroin. Supervising his recovery, and at his side with both emotional support and taunts questioning his toughness, Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my ensures that Doyle completes the cycle of physical withdrawal. When he is well enough to be on his feet, Doyle starts back on the road to regaining his physical fitness. He searches Marseille and, finding the hideout he was brought to, sets it on fire. He breaks into a room at the hotel and discovers Charnier's henchmen, whom he pursues and interrogates as to Charnier's whereabouts. A delivery of opium is taking place at the harbor.

They eventually spot the ship's captain on his way to meet Charnier's lieutenant, whom Doyle recognizes. A tailing ensues taking the police to the drug warehouse, which they raid, but are met with a barrage of fire. Doyle picks up a gun and kills a gangster machine-gunning them. Charnier's lieutenant and other men escape with the drugs on board a van, but Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my closes the warehouse door and stops them. Meanwhile, once again Charnier has escaped.

Many possible clues turn out to be red herrings, such as Joe Spah sketching the ship's interior as an idea for a Vaudeville show and mysterious names which later turned out to be the name of race horses two of the passengers are making bets on. Two other code names, for carnivorous air and sea animals, turn out to refer to the Hindenburg itself and the Queen Mary, where Douglas's competitor is in a race to beat him to port to secure a business deal in New York.\nAs the Hindenburg makes its way to Lakehurst Naval Air Station, events conspire against Ritter and Vogel. They soon suspect the rigger Karl Boerth, a former Hitler Youth leader who has become disillusioned with the Nazis. Ritter attempts to arrest him but he resists and requests help from Ritter, who sympathizes with him because Ritter's son was killed in an accident the previous year while in the Hitler Youth. Ritter later receives news that Boerth's girlfriend, Freda Halle, was killed while trying to escape the Gestapo, who had arrested her for questioning after she was seen asking too many pointed questions about the ship's exact position and arrival time at Lakehurst. Boerth, upon hearing the news of Halle's death, plans to commit suicide by staying aboard the airship as the bomb goes off, to show that there is a resistance against the Nazi regime. Ritter reluctantly agrees with Boerth to set the bomb to 7:30, when the airship should have landed and passengers disembarked, saying an explosion in flight is the \"last thing he wants\".\nWhile setting up the bomb, Boerth drops the knife part which is recovered by a crew member. To cover up the loss of his knife, Boerth steals a knife from fellow rigger Ludwig Knorr. Vogel starts to work behind Ritter's back, arresting Boerth and confiscating the Countess's passport.\nAs the airship approaches Lakehurst Naval Air Station, Ritter now realizes the landing will be delayed and searches for Boerth to ask where the bomb is. Vogel is caught by Ritter in the cargo bay torturing Boerth and gets into a fight with Ritter and is knocked unconscious. An injured Boerth tells Ritter the bomb is in the repair patch of gas cell 4.

Roman very quickly finds out that violence is an everyday occurrence casually meted out by the senior waiters.\nOne day Fryc is offered a shot at joining the waiting staff on the condition that he trains someone to replace him tending the bar. He picks Roman, a choice agreed to by the hotel owner, Pancer. Albin is given fifty zloty for Roman's new uniform but passes on only thirty to the new waiter. Roman excels at the bar and is soon transferred to the waiting staff, much to the consternation of Fryc, who had been promised the move.

Fryc reveals that he has been offered a position to manage a country inn by the elderly widow who inherited the place. Fryc paints a bucolic picture of the inn as surrounded by livestock, wild game, and well-stocked trout ponds. The mutual joy they derive from badmouthing the hotel and its rules proves fleeting, however, and the two former roommates part on bad terms, with Fryc telling Roman to fuck off.\nThe next day Roman is driven to rage by a drunken diner in front of the tearoom clientele when the customer, as an ill-advised sort of apology for his bad behavior, insists the waiter take one of his sweets and even tries\u2014over the strong objection of both the diner's wife and Roman himself\u2014to physically force the candy into Roman's mouth.

Her stage act includes a routine with a dwarf named Hercules (George Claydon).  One night after the show, she invites Hercules into her dressing room for a drink.  He declines the drink but starts to rub Lucy's neck and shoulders.  Lucy feels uncomfortable but tries to pretend nothing is happening, until Hercules makes a sudden lunge for her breasts, causing her to scream out in shock.  This alerts the stage manager Tommy (John Steiner), who rushes into the dressing room and sends Hercules unceremoniously on his way, then proceeds to make love to Lucy.  Later as Lucy leaves the club she is confronted by the spurned and humiliated Hercules, who curses her with the words \"You will have a baby...a monster! An evil monster conceived inside your womb! As big as I am small and possessed by the devil himself!\"\nMonths pass and Lucy has left her stripping days behind, having moved up in the world via marriage to the wealthy Italian Gino Carlesi (Bates) and now comfortably settled in a grand Kensington townhouse.  Lucy goes into hospital to give birth to the baby she is expecting.  It proves to be a protracted, dangerous and painful delivery as the baby is a hefty 12-pounder.  The newborn infant is handed to Lucy, and seconds later she is sporting a slashed and bleeding cheek.  \"He scratched me! With his sharp nails!\" she exclaims in horror to her obstetrician Dr. Finch (Pleasence), who calmly explains that the baby must have been alarmed at being held too tightly.\nLucy and Gino bring the baby home and are welcomed by their efficient, no-nonsense housekeeper Mrs. Hyde (Hilary Mason).  Things get off to a bad start when Mrs. Hyde goes to chuck the baby's chin, only to regret it.  \"The little devil bit me!\" she says as she displays her crushed finger.  She takes an instant dislike to the child, and is later rewarded with a dead mouse in her cup of tea.  Lucy's attempts at maternal bonding are fraught with problems.  She is visited by her friend Mandy (Caroline Munro) and is voicing her concerns when they are interrupted by a series of crashings from upstairs.  To their horror, they find the baby in his cot but the nursery practically demolished.\nGino's sister Albana (Atkins), a nun, arrives from her convent in Italy to visit her new nephew.  Immediately aware that all is not well, she invites Gino to pray with her for the baby, which results in agonising screams from the nursery.  Dr. Finch is consulted, and agrees to carry out a series of tests.  Lucy meanwhile finds the burdens of motherhood too much to bear alone, and employs a nurse (Janet Key) to look after the baby.  After a near-miss when the nurse's head is pulled underwater while bathing the baby, matters take a deadly turn when she takes him for a walk in the park.  Reaching out from his pram, he pushes her with such force that she falls, cracks her head on a lakeside rock, falls unconscious into the water and is drowned.\nLucy pays a visit to Tommy at the strip club.  She intimates that, given the timing of the birth, there is a chance the baby could be his.  \"Just \u2019cause you\u2019ve got some freaky offspring you wanna pin it on me?\" he asks.  However his curiosity is aroused and he asks to see the \"spooky kid\".  Once at the house he leans over to peer into the baby's cot, only to reel back with a smashed and bloody nose for his trouble.  This temporarily pushes the baby up in Lucy's estimation and she gazes lovingly at him, until the face in the cot turns into that of Hercules.\nOne evening Gino plans a romantic night-in to take Lucy's mind off her woes.  At the end of a successful evening, he goes to check on the baby, only to find the nursery empty, the window open and odd noises coming from the garden.  Going out to investigate, he looks up into a tree, whereupon a noose is thrust around his neck and he is hauled into the air and hanged.  His body is stuffed down a drain.  The following day Lucy criss-crosses London in a frenzy trying to find her missing husband.  Dr. Finch is summoned and pays an evening call to check on the baby and the distraught Lucy.  After administering a powerful sedative to Lucy, he too hears strange noises.  He unwisely steps out into the garden, and is decapitated with a spade (while still standing up).  The trail of death continues as Lucy stumbles through the house in a groggy haze, pleading for her life to no avail as she is stabbed through the heart with a pair of scissors.\nFinally galvanized into action, Albana decides that she must perform an exorcism on the baby.  Brandishing a crucifix at him and incanting in Latin, she bravely persists as the room shakes and the baby tears at her vestments.  Meanwhile, at the strip club Hercules is on stage, and begins to stagger around in pain.

A sadistic authoritarian, Ilsa has a voracious sexual appetite for men, choosing a new male prisoner each night to copulate with. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her victims inevitably ejaculate and promptly has them castrated and put to death.\nAfter dispatching her latest conquest, Ilsa oversees the arrival of a new batch of male and female prisoners. Though dismissive and dehumanizing of the majority of her wards, she becomes enamoured by the presence of Wolfe (Gregory Knoph), a blond-haired and blue-eyed prisoner who, unlike his compatriots, resembles the Nazi Aryan ideal. Wolfe, a German-American student who had been studying in Berlin before the war broke out, tells his cellmate Mario (Tony Mumolo), one of Ilsa's former victims, that he has the ability to ejaculate at will, allowing him to have sex with incredible endurance and skill. Wolfe demonstrates this when, called to Ilsa's bedroom at night, he manages to bring her to orgasm, becoming her first repeat partner whom she willingly spares.\nHaving gained Ilsa's confidence, Wolfe begins plotting revolt with Mario and a group of female prisoners who have borne the brunt of Ilsa's tortures. Meanwhile, Ilsa is made gradually more anxious by news of Allied forces breaking through German defenses. Believing that the enlistment of women into the German military will help stem the tide, Ilsa tries to convince a visiting General of her theories of female supremacy by showing him the various inhumane experiments she has subjected her female prisoners to. The impressed General awards Ilsa the Iron Cross for her efforts, while forcing her to fulfill his nascent urolagnia by giving him a golden shower.\nWith the Germans in retreat, the prisoners revolt, killing most of the guards and rounding up the surviving staff. Ilsa is tied to her bed with her stockings by Wolfe during a sex game, before he steals her gun and helps his comrades. Wolfe pleads with the other prisoners to leave the Nazis to be captured and tried by the Allies, but they insist that they'll escape punishment and summarily execute them. With retreating Nazi forces fast approaching, Wolfe and a lone female prisoner escape into the nearby hills as the remaining prisoners, including Mario, resolve to fight to the death.

Voices are overheard that make it apparent that men and women are watching this in the present day.  At the end a man complains that there was no \"cum shot\", something that will later develop into a plot point.\nThe story takes place in Hollywood in the early 1930s, shortly after the start of the talkie period. A visionary and gifted young Hollywood director known as Boy Wonder (Richard Dreyfuss) has fallen out of favour with the studios. This is ostensibly due to his reluctance to lower his standards or abandon his artistic and experimental style, such as using a hand-held camera, for the sake of churning out lesser quality stag films for easy money, due to his alcoholism and his fear of leaving his house. He works out of his decaying mansion, which is the only one left on a street being turned into a freeway.\nOn the morning of this particular shoot, a heroin-addicted waitress named Harlene (Veronica Cartwright) arrives. Harlene was once a well-known and respected star during the silent film era, and she too is reluctant to join the ranks of the \"talkies\" due in part to her unappealing, high-pitched squeaky voice. She is now the star in the first of his six-picture deal. She prepares and shoots heroin while Boy Wonder drinks heavily during a conversation about the changing times in Hollywood.\nAn actor called Rex the Wonder Dog (Stephen Davies) soon arrives, wearing a white suit with grass stains on his knees, having just come from his job working for a mortician. During his introduction, Rex gullibly believes a man from a studio who that says that he will put him in the mainstream talkies, and has an appointment to meet him in his hotel room later that same day.\nBoy Wonder awkwardly attempts to make an artistic film using an actress under the influence of heroin and an actor who becomes increasingly frustrated with the director and all of his poetic talk, much of which he admits he doesn't understand. The scene goes wrong when Rex gets out of control during the action and Boy Wonder needs to smash a wine bottle over his head to get him to stop.\nJust then Big Mac (Bob Hoskins), a porno film producer, enters the scene. He has small heroin packets in his jacket pocket, an unlit cigar in his mouth, wads of money for Rex and a pretty wannabe actress named Cathy Cake (Jessica Harper) hanging on his arm. Harlene takes her payment in heroin and soon dies from an overdose in an upstairs bedroom. Rex finds the dead body, and everyone is terribly upset over this turn of events. Boy Wonder talks about continuing his film, but Rex refuses to perform with a dead woman.\nBig Mac offers Rex a part in a mainstream movie in order to convince Rex to help him bury the body and, while the two are away, Cathy and Boy Wonder develop a chemistry that eventually leads to another ironic high point in the film. Boy Wonder offers to film Cathy for insert shots of her nude body to double for the late Harlene. At first, Cathy refuses to undress, but when she does, she soon becomes aroused by Boy Wonder filming her. After a while, he makes love to her believing he has found something of a soulmate, but she is disappointed when she learns the camera was off. Boy Wonder's sexual experience with Cathy marked the end of his longstanding problem with impotence, which was evidently related to his emotional problems.\nBoy Wonder quickly realizes that this romantic encounter was simply a ploy to get her into the film, and that she has used and directed him the way he used and directed her. Big Mac and Rex return to find both of them half naked. In a jealous rage, Big Mac ends his six-picture stag film contract with Boy Wonder, who by this time is completely drunk. Rex beats up Boy Wonder in retribution for hitting him earlier with the wine bottle by doing likewise. Big Mac takes the film reel that Boy Wonder used and leaves with Rex and Cathy. After Boy Wonder is left alone in his home, a man knocks at the door. This is Clark Gable, a then little-known actor who had been said to be intending to call on Boy Wonder about a film project. Boy Wonder will not answer the door, and after a short time the unseen man leaves. The end of the film finds Boy Wonder alone in his spacious living room, sitting in the same place where the film began; playing piano and singing, pondering what he'll eat for lunch.\nThis last remark brings home the fact that, while a great deal has occurred in the course of the film, the movie was shot in real time.", "tmdb_id": 32069}, "22198915": {"title": "Inside Out (1975 film)", "plot": "In 1975, Harry Morgan (Telly Savalas) and Sylvester \"Sly\" Wells (Robert Culp) come up with a plan to recover six million dollars of Nazi gold, lost since the end of World War II. The story begins during the Third Reich. A crew of Wehrmacht soldiers is driving a cargo truck through the Black Forest when they are stopped by a road block of SS commandos. The SS hijack the truck and its cargo killing its passengers. Thirty-four years later, Harry Morgan is driving his Rolls-Royce home in London, where a repossession agent is waiting to confiscate the car. Harry gives the agent the keys, as Harry boasts that he will soon own another one. He enters his family's apartment, where he has a brief conversation with his wife, Meredith (Lorna Dallas), about their debts and the building that is soon to be sold. As he looks through the bills, he finds a letter addressed to him from someone in his past, requesting to meet with him.\nThe following day, Harry meets Ernst Furben (James Mason) at the London Embassy Hotel. Ernst invites Harry to his hotel room, where they reminisce about the past, and Ernst brings up the story about the cargo. According to his story, he received an order for two guards, a heavy truck and a driver. The truck was assigned to collect a cargo from a railroad yard and deliver it to the Reich Bank. The driver named Hans Schmidt (G\u00fcnter Meisner) presented the order to the railroad official in charge to receive the cargo that was intercepted by a convoy of SS officers. They presented Schmidt with an order signed by a Nazi Party official to transport the cargo from the Balkans. Schmidt noticed the contents of gold bars when one of the crates was dropped. Schmidt was shipped out to the Eastern Front, where he was captured, and remained in prison until the year 1955. Twenty years later, Schmidt met Ernst again, and told him the story about the gold bars. During the war, an order could be countermanded by Adolf Hitler, Heinrich Himmler, Hermann G\u00f6ring, Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess, or Reinhardt Holtz. Schmidt confirmed that Reinhardt Holtz (Wolfgang Lukschy) was the Nazi party official who signed the transfer order. Ernst proposes that he and Harry join forces to release Holtz, to find out the location of the gold. After some discussion about a fellow inmate of the concentration camp, named Sergeant Prior, they discuss tentative ideas for releasing Holtz.\nA few days later, Harry travels to Amsterdam to find Sly playing chess with a Dutch teenage boy in a pub. Sly forfeits the game, and speaks to Harry, who tells him about the gold worth six million dollars. Sly initially refuses, but hears Harry out and agrees to the heist. Harry talks Sly into paying for two tickets to West Berlin, where they meet Ernst. They drive by Seigfried prison (where Holtz is an inmate) on the way to an expensive Berlin hotel, where Harry is ringing up an expensive tab for Ernst to pay. Harry goes to the store of Peter Dohlberg (Charles Korvin) to ask him to finance the heist. Peter agrees to the heist for 15% of it. Harry reluctantly agrees, knowing he has no other options. Peter's employee, named Siggi, brings her friend Erika Kurtz (Doris Kunstmann) to meet Harry. They arrange to have Udo Blimperman (Peter Schlesinger), an obese costume shop owner, give them the uniforms they need, in exchange for unlimited meals. Later that evening, Udo gets drunk and crashes through a table.\nHarry introduces Sly to Erika and Udo. Erika confirms that Udo will recover. The next morning, Harry wakes up to find that Sly and Erika had been playing chess all night, and that Udo had ordered another large meal for himself. Harry and Ernst meet Schmidt at a carnival to discuss his part in the heist. Harry meets Prior (Aldo Ray), who is now a prison sergeant at Seigfried prison. Harry mentions the scheme to the rest of the group at a hotel. Prior tells everyone about the security procedures at the prison, where the only man to speak to Holtz is a doctor named Maar (Adrian Hoven). Prior offers to allow them to interrogate Holtz in his cell, but Sly says it will not work, stating that Holtz will not disclose the information to anyone outside the Nazi party. Sly informs Schmidt about his idea to stage a confidence game to trick Holtz, and use Erika as an assistant. When Ernst begins to object, Sly reassures him that his idea will not cost him his share.\nSly has fallen in love with Erika, and they go on a walk together to discuss more details about the heist. They find an abandoned courthouse, which they pick the lock on, and decide to use it for their confidence game on Holtz. They purchase furnishings for the scheme, while Harry and Ernst purchase a used car to repaint as a United States Army staff car. Back at the hotel, Prior sets up a model of the prison to show where Holtz's cell is located. Ernst and Sly purchase a camera to photograph Maar with a transsexual named Pauli (Bernard Bauer). Maar is blackmailed by Schmidt and Ernst, claiming that Pauli was Ernst's nephew. Knowing the police will not believe him, Maar agrees to switch places with Holtz, while Harry and Sly accompany them, disguised as United States Army officers. Holtz is drugged with a sedative, while Sly distracts the cell block guard with a ruse about a filthy cell, and orders him to clean it up. Prior relocks the door with the key that has been inadvertently left in the cell door and returns it to the guard, while Harry and Sly leave with Holtz, who is barely conscious enough to walk escorted. Harry makes up a cover story that Holtz needs to be seen by a dental surgeon the next day for an infection. Prior collaborates to ensure that no one else will see Holtz to ensure that no one else knows the surgeons identity, who is actually Ernst. Harry rebukes Prior for not having his name on the visitor's log as part of a ruse.\nThey pick up Erika from work to change Holtz's appearance to make him look younger. As they arrive at the derelict courthouse, they change Holtz from Maar's borrowed civilian street clothes into a replica of his old Nazi uniform. Holtz is escorted into a courtroom furnished to look like a Third Reich office. Once inside the sedative wears off, he awakens to find himself in a staged meeting, with Schmidt disguised as Adolf Hitler, Sly disguised as an SS officer, and Ernst disguised as a Field Marshal. Schmidt states that Holtz stole the gold from the Reich and betrayed him. Holtz is confused about what Schmidt is referring to and asks what gold was stolen. Schmidt tells Holtz that the gold disappeared only seven days ago, and confirms that Holtz signed the order to have it deposited into the Reich Bank. Ernst escorts Holtz into another room to refresh his memory. Sly and Schmidt congratulate each other on their performances, while Ernst tells Holtz that Germany is winning the war and Holtz has been hospitalised. Holtz remembers that the gold was hidden to prevent Hermann G\u00f6ring from stealing it. He will only tell Hitler the exact location, though. Holtz whispers to Schmidt (still disguised as Hitler) that the gold is hidden in his bunker, which is on the property of his summer home in Vanglitz. Holtz is given another sedative, while Schmidt admires a portrait of Hitler, comparing his likeness to it. Sly congratulates Schmidt, and Harry sarcastically says that they should do a double act with himself as Benito Mussolini. Schmidt gets carried away with his acting, while Ernst is worried Holtz may recognize the scam, and that their cover can still be blown by him reporting the incident to the prison guards. Sly proposes to return Holtz first thing in the morning before going after the gold, but Harry refuses to wait, worried that it could be found by anyone at any time.\nThey cross the border into East Germany and everything goes well, despite Schmidt becoming nervous. They arrive at the summer home, to find that the bomb shelter has been built over by an apartment building. Further examination of one of the basement rooms reveals that the bunker is directly below, separated by three feet of concrete. Ernst contacts Wilhelm Schlager (Richard Warner) to arrange to get cooperation from the Soviet police garrison. Schlager insists on 1/8% of the heist for his inconvenience. He steps into another room and conceals a Walther PPK in his belt, while he calls Colonel Kosnikov (Constantine Gregory) of the Russian army. He plans for them to double cross the group, to get a two-way split for himself and Kosnokov. Kosnikov arrives with the Russian army, surrounds the house, and kills Schlager. Sly notices and secretly retrieves Schlager's handgun. Kosnikov demands a share for allowing them to stage a bomb threat to get access to the bunker. He reroutes his troops to the apartment building, and provides the group with equipment to impersonate a bomb disposal unit.\nThe army evacuates the residents, so that they can begin drilling through the concrete floor. A boy wanders into the room where the dynamite is placed for the explosion. The boy is discovered at the last moment and safely removed before the explosion. Ernst announces that another bomb has been discovered, as a diversion to allow them to enter the hole leading to the bunker. Searching the bunker, the group finds two steel chests containing the gold behind a partition. Sly breaks the locks with a hammer and a chisel as the group admires their loot. After the gold is retrieved, Kosnikov shows up alone to intercept the group, armed with a machine gun. He tries to blackmail them and take all of the gold. As Schmidt pleads for their lives, Harry pins Kosnikov with a ladder. Kosnikov then shoots and kills Schmidt, after which Sly kills Kosnikov with Schlager's pistol. When the team returns to West Germany, they are confronted by the checkpoint guard about their flags on the wrong sides of the car's hood. The checkpoint guard puts the flags on correctly and allows them to leave. They throw Schmidt's body into a river.\nThey pick up Erika, as well as Holtz, who is still sedated. They turn the gold over to Peter to have it divided up and converted from bullion to United States dollars. En route to the prison, they are forced to deal with a truck with toppled pallets blocking the road. They use the pallets to create a ramp to jump over the cargo truck and proceed to the prison. Returning to the prison, they are confronted by the United States Army colonel (Don Fellows) in charge of Seigfried, who demands an explanation about the unauthorized personnel at the prison. Harry cons their way out of the situation to allow Ernst access as the dental surgeon. Maar and Holtz are switched back to their proper places.

Although, Ganesha has another wife Buddhi (\"wisdom\"), she is not portrayed in the film.\nA key role is played by the immortal sage Narada, a devotee of Vishnu, and a cosmic busybody who regularly intervenes to advance the film's two parallel plots, which concern both human beings and gods.\nWe soon meet the 18th-century maiden Satyavati Sharma (Kanan Kaushal), Santoshi Mata's greatest earthly devotee, leading a group of women in an aarti to the goddess. This first song, \"Main To Arti Utaru\" (I perform Mother Santoshi's aarti) exemplifies through its camerawork the experience of darshan \u2014of \"seeing\" and being seen by a deity in the reciprocal act of \"visual communion\" that is central to Hindu worship.\nThrough the Mother's grace, Satyavati soon falls in love with Brijmohan aka Birju, the youngest of seven brothers in a prosperous Bias Brahmin farmer family, an artistic man, with a talent for singing. Alas, with the boy come the in-laws, and two of Birju's six sisters-in-law, Durga and Maya are jealous shrews who have it in for him and Satyavati from the beginning. To make matters worse, Narada \"stirs up\" the \"jealousy\" of the three principal goddesses, Lakshmi, Parvati, and Saraswati against the \"upstart\" goddess Santoshi Mata. They decide to examine (pariksha) her perseverance or faith (Shraddha) by making life miserable for her chief devotee. Of course, this is all just a charade and the holy goddesses are just acting as if they are jealous of Santoshi Mata to test Satyavati's devotion.\nAfter a fight with his relatives, Birju leaves home to seek his fortune, narrowly escaping a watery grave (planned for him by the goddesses) through his wife's devotion to Santoshi Mata. Nevertheless, the divine ladies convince his family that he is indeed dead, adding the stigma of widowhood to Satyavati's other woes. Her sisters-in-law treat her like a slave, beat and starve her, and a local rogue attempts to rape her; Santoshi Mata rescues her several times. Eventually, Satyavati is driven to attempt suicide, but is stopped by Narada, who tells her about the sixteen-Fridays fast in honour of Santoshi Mata, which can grant any wish. Satyavati completes it with great difficulty and more divine assistance, and just in the nick of time: for the now-prosperous Birju, stricken with amnesia by the goddesses and living in a distant place, has fallen in love with a rich merchant's daughter. Through Santoshi Mata's grace, he gets his memory back and returns home laden with wealth. When he discovers the awful treatment given to his wife, he builds a palatial home for the two of them, complete with an in-house temple to the Holy Mother. Satyavati plans a grand ceremony upon the completion of her fast and invites her in-laws. But the celestials and sadistic sisters-in-law make a last-ditch effort to ruin her by squeezing lime juice into one of the dishes (the rules of Santoshi Mata's fast forbid eating, or serving, any sour or bitter food).

While she is treading water, an unseen force attacks her and pulls her under the water. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. After the medical examiner concludes she was the victim of a shark attack, police chief Martin Brody decides to close the beaches, but Mayor Larry Vaughn persuades him to reconsider, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner tentatively concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident, and Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until the shark kills a young boy, Alex Kintner, in front of a crowded beach. A bounty is placed on the shark, causing an amateur shark-hunting frenzy, and eccentric and roughened local professional shark fisherman Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, confirming that an abnormally large shark killed her.\nWhen local fishermen catch a tiger shark, the mayor proclaims that the beach is safe. Mrs. Kintner, Alex's mother, confronts Brody and blames him for her son's death. Hooper doubts that the tiger shark is responsible for the attacks, and his suspicions are confirmed when no human remains are found inside its stomach after dissection. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper removes a sizable great white shark's tooth from the boat's hull, but accidentally drops it after discovering the partial corpse of local fisherman Ben Gardner. Vaughn dismisses Brody and Hooper's assertions that a huge great white shark caused the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only increased safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank with a fake shark, the real shark enters a nearby lagoon, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces a guilt-ridden Vaughn to immediately hire Quint.\nDespite tension between Quint and Hooper, they set out with Brody on Quint's boat, the Orca, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a chum line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. When the shark suddenly appears behind the boat, Quint, estimating that it is 25 feet (7.6 m) long and weighs 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but it pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\nAt nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars, and Quint reveals that he survived the attack on the USS Indianapolis. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons the shark with another barrel. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he overtaxes the damaged engine and it fails.\nAs the Orca slowly sinks, the trio attempts a riskier approach. Hooper enters the water in a shark-proof cage, intending to lethally inject the shark with strychnine via a hypodermic spear. The shark attacks the cage, causing Hooper to drop the spear, which sinks. While the shark thrashes in the tangled remains of the cage, Hooper manages to escape to the seabed. The shark breaks free and leaps onto the boat, subsequently devouring Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody shoves a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth and climbs onto the crow's nest. He shoots the tank with Quint's rifle, killing the shark with the resulting explosion.

She gives a straightforward testimony of her sexual slavery and wartime experiences.\nKikuyo was born the youngest child of 8 into a family who worked as farmers and merchants in Toyota District, Hiroshima. After the parents' early death, she was first looked after by her brother and later lived with an older sister. At the age of 19, she was tricked into leaving Japan with a friend and ended up in Kelang, Malaysia, where she was forced into prostitution on the ground that she had to earn back the cost for her passage and food. After three years, she was able to pay back her debts and moved to Changi, Singapore. In Singapore, Kikuyo worked in a restaurant and offered her sexual services in a room above the restaurant or by visiting ships in the harbour, before moving to Ipoh, loathing the often violent shipwright customers. About the same time, prostitution in Asian countries with Japanese communities was outlawed by the Japanese government for being \"indecent\". Kikuyo first married a Japanese photographer, but left him after he quit his job to move to Singapore, and then an Indian railway worker. During the Pacific War, Kikuyo was interred in an Indian prison camp like other fellow Japanese, but unlike the majority of the inmates from Amakusa and Shimabara, she did not share their patriotism and neither cared if Japan would win or lose the war. Asked by Imamura if she would like to return to her home country, she replies that she would have liked to pay a visit once, but cannot afford it.\nCurious about her hometown, Imamura visits the village where Kikuyo was born. He discovers that many of its inhabitants, including her family, were burakumin and faced with discrimination. Imamura contemplates if this is the reason for Kikuyo's detachment from her country. In Tokyo, he visits Mrs. Ishimura, wife of the former head of a company branch in Malaysia and Kikuyo's employer for 6 months. From Mrs. Ishimura he learns that Kikuyo, contrary to her modest on-camera statements, is very unhappy with living at the home of her son's mother-in-law, who only tolerates her because she is a hard labourer.\nBack in Malaysia, Imamura locates some other former karayuki-san, who continue living in the same area as Kikuyo and tell of their fates and those of other young women, some of whom disappeared or committed suicide in their despair. Kikuyo then takes him to visit a cemetery which has many graves of karayuki-san.

But even before they can tell the truth, they are horrified to find Vikram dead.\nThey meet Inspector Rajendra Singh, who is investigating the case. The Inspector is sceptical, but gives them one chance to prove their innocence. From Vikram's personal belongings, they find out about a club singer named Sherie. Anticipating that Sherie may know why Vikram was killed, they go to meet Sherie. But when they go to her dressing room after her performance, they find her dead. The duo realize that Sherie was involved in some shady deals and Vikram was her partner.\nAfter trying to find out some information, they learn that Sherie acted as a middleman between a dreaded criminal named Black Cobra and the people who paid him. After learning that Black Cobra is an extortionist and the dead man was also on his payroll, blocks suddenly start falling into places. Ajay and Nisha deduce that the Seth thought the note was from Black Cobra and confronted him. The Seth thought that Black Cobra became more greedy and threatened to expose him, following which he was killed by latter.\nBlack Cobra thought that Vikram and Sherie were extorting people in his name, behind his back, so he killed them.

The stranger confronts them, but the duo overpower him and escape. They inform the Inspector about their findings. The Inspector calls them to meet him in an abandoned place.\nAjay gives him all the incriminating evidence, but to his astonishment, the Inspector burns all of it. He shocks him by telling that he is none other than Black Cobra himself. Suddenly Ajay realizes that he played right into his hands. Black Cobra coolly goes on to declare that since he knows pretty much everything, he has to kill him and pin the blame of all the killings on him. He denies that he sent any man behind them. Just he is about to pull the trigger, the stranger makes an entry and after some fight the Black Cobra is put behind bars.\nTo a bewildered Ajay and Nisha, the stranger reveals that he is Charlie, an undercover police officer working on the murder cases. He tells that he suspected Vikram and Sherie of running the extortion racket much before the first murder. He already knew about the prank, but was unsure of the killer's identity. So he stole their typewriter. Then Cobra killed Vikram and Sherie to keep his secret intact. Then he knew that Cobra is behind all this and used the duo to track down Cobra. He reassures Ajay and Nisha that even though Black Cobra destroyed all the proof, there is no proof against the duo either. He tells the duo to collect the typewriter from him the next day.

He doesn't speak much, from which she infers that he wasn't married or else he would have talked about his wife and his family. She confesses to her friend Lucia that he is a very different man, one who treats her with respect and not one to jump to the physical stuff. Some time later, with mutual consent Loredana and Silvi have intercourse. Loredana is saddened and in pain because now she has been deflowered. Silvi tells her he would have preferred her to be a non-virgin and had she told him she was a virgin, he would have been gentle; but not that he didn't like what they did.\nAfter his work in Turin is done, Silvi says that he is returning home soon. Loredana expresses a desire to run away with him. He is silent, obviously not wanting this. On the day he is to leave, a jealous Gianni follows him with the aim of beating him up and his bike gets into an accident. Meanwhile, Loredana is given a letter by the hotel where Silvi was staying, stating that their love should be only a beautiful memory and the reason why he cannot take her will be clear to her when she grows up. Heartbroken, she returns to meet Lucia. All this while, her divorced parents are out looking for her in worry. They come to know that she had planned to run away to Turin for a man, from which Loredana's father Signor d'Amico infers that it must be Silvi; but dismisses the idea as he knows Silvi is happily married.\nShe confesses to Lucia that all men are the same and she does not want to believe in love any more. Lucia says that Gianni truly loved her. At this moment, the artist friend from school shows up and informs them of the accident. They rush to meet Gianni in the hospital. Loredana is truly sad to see his state, but he calls her a bitch and wards her off as she had caused him so much physical and emotional trouble. Silently, she goes away to meet her friend who was in the profession of carnal pleasure. She laments to her that all men she met have duped her under pretense of love. She expresses a desire to have a paid physical relation with a client of hers. He arrives but she backs out at the last moment, realising her mistake.\nAt home, she finds her mother's lover waiting outside for her mother. He says that her mother loves him for him and if he were a stronger man, she may not love him any more; because then he would have become a changed man, not the one she loved to begin with. In short, he explains that one should always be oneself and stop pretending - stop lying to yourself and the world. Loredana realises that she was trying to grow up too fast and there is more to life than infatuation and sex. When her parents arrive, she says that all is fine now, but it would be better if they were to become a couple again. While they do not accept, they do agree (after she leaves)  that she is now becoming mature and she has a point.\nLoredana tries to seduce the professor again but when she sees Gianni, she realises her true feelings (being oneself) and renews their relationship.

David loves riding with his grandfather, and shares Zaida's love for Ferdeleh, despite the horse's age and the neighbour Mrs. Tannenbaum's complaints as to the smell. Zaida jokes about covering Mrs. Tannenbaum's steps with horse excrement, an idea that delights David, who takes it seriously. While Zaida's friend Mr. Baumgarten embraces the ideas of Karl Marx to end social class injustice, Zaida replies he is instead looking to the arrival of the messiah to end all injustice.\nHarry, who is not religious, designs a pair of trousers meant to be impossible to crease, and appeals to Zaida for $500 in investment, claiming he already has many orders for the product and will be able to pay back with interest in one month. When Harry demonstrates his \"pressless trousers\", his own business partner points out the bulges in the knees, spoiling any chance Zaida will invest. Enraged, Harry rants about marrying into an unintelligent family, condemns Zaida as a miser and not a real Orthodox Jew, and says Ferdeleh should be killed. David overhears these threats made by his father and is  disturbed and embarrassed for the way he has spoken of his family, particularly Zaida. In attempt to comfort his grandfather, David informs Zaida that his father tells \"terrible lies\".\nWhile David hopes to ride with Zaida on another Sunday, Harry insists instead on taking David fishing. However, Harry actually takes David to a gambling club, and talks of leaving the ghetto behind. With orders on the defective trousers cancelled, Harry goes into bankruptcy and the family's plans to move are cancelled, to David's joy.

But their car breaks down in front of a crumbling mansion where Lisa discovers that Leandro works as the butler. The couple (a young woman and older man) persuade Leandro to let them stay while the driver (the young wife's lover) fixes the car. Lisa attempts to flee, but Maximilian, a resident of the mansion, stops Lisa and agrees to let the three stay over his mother's objections, a blind Countess.\nThe obscure, mustachioed man continues to stalk Lisa as further mysteries unfold: the Countess and her son have a fourth guest in the mansion. This mysterious figure is held prisoner inside a secret room. The Countess, Maximilian, Leandro, and the mustachioed man (revealed to be Carlos, the Countess' second husband) claim that Lisa is actually Elena, Maximilian's long-lost girlfriend who was once frightened away by his jealous mother.\nThrough a series of waking dreams, it is revealed that Elena was secretly sleeping with Carlos and that he was plotting to leave the jealous and reclusive Countess. Lisa freaks out after seeing Leandro preparing Carlos' body for burial juxtaposed with Carlos being alive. Carlos attempts to whisk Lisa away one last time, but Maximilian kills him. Lisa faints as Carlos' body morphs into the dummy Leandro purchased in the store. Leandro repairs the dummy (whose face has caved in, in the aftermath of the murder attempt).\nA mysterious figure promptly kills the driver after fixing the car.

Lisa intends to escape, but a defeated and browbeaten Maximilian has started to believe that Lisa is just like Elena. He takes her to his secret room, where Elena's corpse and ghost are revealed to be the mystery prisoner. Maximilian drugs Lisa, strips her naked, and rapes her, only to have the ghost of Elena laugh at him mid-rape and cause him to stop.

Crusoe then tries to teach him Western concepts like property, sports, punishment, fear of God and so on, but Friday's reaction is only one of bewilderment and amusement. He begins to question and mock these concepts that seem senseless and destructive to him. One day he rebels, refusing to be a slave anymore.

Friday thinks that he maybe can teach Crusoe his more relaxed way of living, and not to be controlled by \"thoughts of power, guilt and fear\", which are very strong traits in Crusoe's personality.\nOne day, Crusoe falls back into his old delusions of being a superior being. He had been trying to teach Friday in a mock-up school for a while, ridiculously complete with a chalkboard. We see that the topic of the day, written on the chalkboard, is \"civilization\". Obviously, for Crusoe this is a culmination point, where his concepts are ultimately confronted with those of Friday. He gets in a frenzy and binds Friday to a pole, then holds a frightful, lunatic sermon about the superiority of his ways while threatening Friday with his gun. In the end, he shoots, but not at Friday, but at his own talking parrot, which had been his sole companion before Friday's arrival. After that shocking experience, Friday gives up his attempts to change Crusoe; the friendship also ends, leaving only the relationship of Crusoe as master and Friday as a paid servant.\nAfter several years, Friday has accumulated 2,000 gold coins, the price that Crusoe once mockingly called for the hut and all his belongings.

Carnehan tells Kipling the story of how he and his comrade-in-arms Danny Dravot, ex-sergeants of the British Army who had become adventurers, travelled far beyond India into the remote land of Kafiristan.\nThree years earlier, Dravot and Carnehan had met Kipling under less than auspicious circumstances. After stealing Kipling's pocket-watch, Carnehan found a masonic tag on the chain, and realising he had robbed a fellow Freemason, felt he had to return it. At the time, he and Dravot were working on a plot to blackmail a local raja, which Kipling foiled by getting the British district commissioner to intervene. In a comic relief turn, Carnehan obliquely blackmails the commissioner in order to avoid deportation.\nFrustrated at the lack of opportunities for lucrative criminal mischief, in an India becoming more civilised and regulated\u2014partly through their own hard efforts as soldiers\u2014and with little to look forward to in the United Kingdom except dreary, poorly paid jobs, the two turn up at Kipling's office with an audacious plan. Forsaking India, they will head with twenty rifles and ammunition to Kafiristan, a country virtually unknown to Europeans since its conquest by Alexander the Great. There they will offer their services to a ruler and then help him to conquer his neighbours, but proceed to overthrow him and loot the country. Kipling, after first trying to dissuade them, gives Dravot his masonic tag as a token of brotherhood.\nAfter signing a contract pledging mutual loyalty and forswearing women and drink, the two set off on an epic overland journey north beyond the Khyber Pass. Over the next few weeks, they travel through Afghanistan, fighting off bandits, blizzards and avalanches, as they make their way into the unknown land of Kafiristan. They chance upon a Gurkha soldier, Billy Fish, the sole survivor of a years past, British expedition. Speaking English as well as the local language, Billy smooths their way as they begin their rise, first offering their services to the chief of a much-raided village. When a force has been trained in modern weapons and tactics, they lead it out against some hated neighbours. During the battle, an arrow pierces Dravot's jacket but he is unharmed.\nBoth sides take him to be a god, though in fact the arrowhead was stopped by his leather bandolier. Victory follows victory, with the defeated adding to the ranks of the swelling army. With their enemies vanquished, nobody is left to stand in their way, as they are summoned to the holy city of Sikandergul by the high priest of the region. He sets up a re-enactment of the arrow incident, to determine whether Dravot is a man or a god by seeing whether or not he bleeds. When his shirt is torn open, they are amazed to see the masonic tag around his neck. It contains the sacred symbol left by Sikander, their name for Alexander the Great, who had promised to send a son to rule over them.\nHailing Dravot as king as well as god, they show him the royal treasury, which is full of unimaginable amounts of gold and jewels that are now all his. Carnehan suggests that they leave with as much loot as they can carry as soon as the snows have melted on the mountain passes. Dravot, however, is beginning to enjoy the adulation of the locals, settling their disputes and issuing laws, and even dreams of visiting Queen Victoria as an equal. He is also struck by the beauty of a girl called Roxane, the name of Alexander's wife, and cancels their pact to avoid women, saying he will marry her in order to leave the people an heir. When she is reluctantly brought to him, he tries to kiss her, but she, terrified that the touch of a god means death to a mortal, bites his cheek.

The editor suggests K\u00fcsters send in a letter which he might publish. The anarchists take the staff hostage at gunpoint, including Niemeyer, now living with Corinna, who arrives unaware how far the situation has developed. The anarchists demand the release of all political prisoners in West Germany, a Mercedes 600 to take them to the airport and a Boeing 707 to take them out of the country. K\u00fcsters looks horrified at the anarchists' demands but is killed in a subsequent clash with the police. Knab kills Linke (the editor) but Knab is also shot. (The last stages of the narrative are detailed with captions.)\nIn another ending (primarily used for the American edition), Niemeyer is at the magazine offices but as the staff start to leave at the end of their working day, the two anarchists grow bored with the sit-down strike and leave with K\u00fcsters remaining.

However, Fassbinder's film goes further by criticizing the overwhelming selfishness present in contemporary society.

It tells the story of four middle-aged friends in Florence who organize together idle pranks (called zingarate, \"gypsy shenanigans\") in a continuous attempt to prolong childhood during their adult life.\n\nCount Mascetti (Ugo Tognazzi) is an impoverished noble who has no means to support his family, but does not renounce high living pleasures anyway, and has an underage mistress, Titti (Silvia Dionisio).  Perozzi (Philippe Noiret) is an easy-living journalist harassed by the unceasing disapproval of his wife and his son.  Melandri (Gastone Moschin) is an architect employed by City Hall (for the preservation and restoration of the City's countless monuments), whose main goal is to find the ideal woman.  Necchi (Duilio Del Prete) is the owner of a caf\u00e9 and pool hall where the friends usually plan their zingarate.\nDuring the movie, they are joined by a renowned, military-like surgeon, professor Alfeo Sassaroli (Adolfo Celi), in whose clinic they recover after being hospitalized, injured after a mismanaged zingarata.  Melandri falls in love with Sassaroli's wife, exclaiming \"I've seen the Madonna!\", only to discover she has psychological problems.\nThe plot is mostly composed of elaborate practical jokes organized by the friends, including the creation of a fake mafia mob (actually, from Marseille) in whose \"criminal acts\" they involve a pensioner, Righi (Bernard Blier), who used to snatch croissants from the cake tray in Necchi's caf\u00e9, and Mascetti's attempts to save his marriage despite his relationship with Titti.\nThe film ends with Perozzi's death, which still does not deprive his friends of their desecrating hijinks, not even in face of their own mortality. Instead, Perozzi's wife is skeptical at first, since she wonders if his death can actually be one of his pranks. Criticized by Melandri for her lack of tears, she comments: \"One mourns if somebody dies.  But here, nobody died\". Mascetti replies: \"Well, he wasn't somebody, but I liked him\".\nDuring the funeral procession, they \"pay homage\" to their dead friend by telling the wide-eyed Righi that Perozzi was killed for being a traitor to their mafia.

Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the BBC (though she refers to the British Broadcasting Company), attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following what the crowd believes was a burn accident (which may actually have been a nervous breakdown and stay at a mental hospital).

Kuroda is forced to do it himself and  gets a seven-year sentence for murder. In prison, he fights off a group of inmates attempting to rape fellow inmate Katsuo Shimura and befriends him. When Kuroda is released, Shimura, who already finished his sentence, greets him along with another young man who gives his name as Akira Kobayashi; the two promise their loyalty to Kuroda as they both wish to become yakuza. Kuroda returns to Kyushu and finds that Kusunoki has been abandoned by the Owada Family due to his worsening addiction. They visit the family's headquarters to request the five million yen Kuroda is owed for serving Kusunoki's sentence, but Owada refuses to keep his word, shifting responsibility to the penniless Kusunoki.\nKusunoki and Kuroda abduct Owada and his mistress Shinako, threatening to kill her unless Owada honors the deal. The next day, Owada Family officer Shigehiko Aihara meets with Kuroda and gives him a large parcel of heroin, telling him to sell it to Owada's sworn brother Takeo Akamatsu while he comes up with the rest of the money. Kuroda goes to see Akamatsu and recognizes his girlfriend Aya as the same woman he saw kissing Aihara in a hotel earlier. Akamatsu's men steal the heroin and badly beat Shimura, leading an enraged Kobayashi to stab Akamatsu to death in revenge before the yakuza's bodyguard kills him. Aihara steps in, agreeing to protect Kuroda from retaliation until the dispute is settled.\nKuroda receives the full five million, with Aihara explaining away his actions by claiming that he wanted to assassinate Akamatsu for trying to leave the family without Owada's consent. Kuroda demands extra compensation and Owada agrees to pay for Kobayashi's funeral and induct Kuroda and Shimura into his family. A few days later, Aihara takes Owada, Kuroda, and other family members to a club he owns that is being managed by Aya, who is now his mistress.

Owada surprises everyone by naming Seiji Izeki as his successor rather than Aihara.

Misako refuses, but when she throws out the rest of Kusunoki's heroin stash, he hits her and she runs to her father. Aihara and his men pick up Kusunoki with orders to shoot him and dump his body under a bridge. However, Aihara instead tells Kusunoki that Owada plans to marry Misako off to Kuroda and that he deserves payback for the way his father-in-law treats him. Kusunoki is given a pistol and goes to Owada's house, where he shoots his boss in cold blood but collapses from physical exhaustion before he can kill Kuroda. The family covers up the incident by arranging for him to be put in an insane asylum.\nAt Owada's funeral, Nozaki convinces the weak-willed Izeki that because he has neither the money nor the temperament to be boss, he should nominate Aihara in his place. The officers, who all hate Kuroda, decide to kill him, but when Izeki protests, Nozaki and Aihara order him to break off his oath with Kuroda and oversee his expulsion from the family.

The school's austere headmistress, Mrs Appleyard, has arranged a picnic to a local geological formation known as Hanging Rock, accompanied by the peculiar mathematics teacher Miss Greta McCraw and the young French teacher Mademoiselle de Poitiers. Mrs Appleyard keeps Sara and jittery teacher Miss Lumley at the college.\nBuggy operator Ben Hussey gets the group to Hanging Rock by mid-afternoon, where they picnic at its base. Mr Hussey notes his pocket watch has stopped at the stroke of 12, as has Miss McCraw's. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda and classmates Marion, Irma, and Edith decide to explore Hanging Rock. The group is soon after observed crossing a creek by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert, along with Albert, his friend and coachman for the Fitzhubert family.\nAfter exploring the rock for a while, Miranda, Marion, and Irma remove their shoes and stockings. Near the summit, seemingly under the influence of an unseen force, the four collapse and fall asleep next to a  monolith.

Amid brewing potions and a crowded chalkboard, he is accompanied in his jumbled workspace by a talking bird and an affectionate dog. Popper exhibits forgetful and repetitive behaviours, misremembering names and intermittently singing a ditty about Napoleon. In an elaborate bid to eradicate world hunger, he invents a shrinking powder, which when sprayed on vast food stocks facilitates a size reduction that allows for transportation by a single airplane. An antidote would also be provided, restoring the aid to its original dimensions once deployed. Popper and his pupil prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Simon, accidentally consume the powder in pill-form after it finds its way into their mugs of tea. A wider group of Popper's student assistants\u2014Terry, Angus, Carol, and Peter\u2014mistakenly join the pair in their predicament after searching for them. However, Liz, another of the Professor's tutees, avoids the fate of her classmates and is consequently tasked with helping them in their plight. Initially confined to Popper's chaotic laboratory, the affected group are now two inches tall, each the size of an insect. Their environment is greatly altered as a result; a book is now like a cliff edge, the rotary dial resembles a carousel, pennies are the size of hula hoops and a cat's paw is as large as a Ford Transit.Unconcerned, the Professor is happy to sing to his students about the benefits of their newfound scale. Popper's colleague, Professor Crabbit (dressed in the attire of Sherlock Holmes), meanwhile sets about investigating what has happened to the cohort, arousing the suspicion of local man Rollins. Having misplaced the antidote to his formula, Popper's shrinking powder further becomes a prime target of theft. Covert Russian operatives bent on industrial espionage and a London gang, the latter sporting two crooks sent to miniaturise the Bank of England and sell it to the United States in a suitcase, initiate their pursuits. The danger is eventually supplemented by the Professor's group being chased by an enlarged tarantula, as well as a perilous roller skate ride through the capital. Still, the formula is protected by Popper through this trepidation, and all the villains' plans are ultimately thwarted.

His best friend Joey helps him to sneak into the nearby Kennedy Space Center. Wearing a hardhat and fake security badge and carrying a toolbox, E.J. slips by the other workers unnoticed.\nHe hides inside a trash compartment in the command module Camelot of the Saturn V rocket before the astronauts arrive for the scheduled Apollo flight to the Moon. As they work through the preflight checklist, Mission Control informs them that the spacecraft is overweight by 87 pounds. They cannot explain the discrepancy, but decide that it is not important enough to delay the launch, and the countdown continues. Meanwhile, E.J.'s father Eli Sr. discovers a note from his son telling him of his intentions. Eli and his wife Mary rush to the Kennedy Space Center and insist to the gate staff that their son is on the rocket, but no one believes them.\nAfter the rocket launches on schedule, command module pilot Ben Pelham discovers E.J. Through flashbacks, E.J. tells his story to the astronauts. He and Joey were building a large scale model of a space capsule, and to raise money to build it, they performed work for the elderly Jacob Avril, who owns property adjoining the Kennedy Space Center. Avril's close proximity to the Space Center gives E.J. the idea of stowing away on the upcoming Moon launch.\nCharlie Englehardt, the flight director, tells the crew that the mission is scrubbed, but when the world learns about the stowaway, the principal investigator urges that the mission continue because it is the only planned visit to the Rupes Altai. E.J. apologizes for his stunt on live television and asks that his actions not jeopardize the crew's important mission. Englehardt recognizes that E.J. has persuaded the public and US president to continue the mission, and reluctantly gives his consent for the planned Moon landing.\nE.J. helps clean the cabin with a vacuum cleaner and performs other chores. Once in lunar orbit, mission commander Rick Lawrence and lunar module pilot Dave Anderson prepare to undock from the command module and descend to the surface. E.J. notices that Pelham is ill, but the astronaut insists that it is just space adaptation syndrome and asks E.J. to say nothing to the others.\nLawrence and Anderson depart in the Lunar Module Little Dipper, but Pelham's condition deteriorates rapidly. With the ground crew's help, E.J. saves Pelham's life with the vacuum cleaner when he throws up inside his helmet. The boy cares for the ailing astronaut and helps locate the lunar module, which has landed far off course. Despite intermittent telemetry, the lunar module is able to return to the command module with a Genesis Rock; without E.J., Pelham would have died and a rendezvous would have been impossible, killing the other astronauts.\nOn the way back to Earth, a stuck valve bleeds much of the oxygen from the ship. The astronauts remain in their spacesuits, while E.J. must retreat to Little Dipper until re-entry.

Higgins finds out the high costs are for renting a cow as a test subject; they are feeding it various concoctions to make it fatter. In a rage, Higgins fires Quigley then threatens to have his entire class thrown out of college. When the dean slams the door as he leaves, Dexter Riley's (Kurt Russell) chemical experiment mixes with that of another student, Richard Schuyler's (Michael McGreevey) vitamin cereal mix.\nWhen the cow eats some of the cereal into which the mixture has leaked, the students learn that the cereal gave the cow the ability to produce a huge supply of milk, over 80 gallons. When Dexter eats it the next morning he gains super-strength, as does the fraternity house's pet dog.\nDexter shows the dean and Quigley his super-strength by picking up an obese kid in a chair with the right hand and Schuyler with the left. Higgins jumps on this as an opportunity to get Medfield out of its financial slump and keep the Board of Regents from firing him. Higgins takes the formula-laced cereal to the board of the Crumply Crunch cereal company and demonstrates its effects to the board and its president, Aunt Harriet Crumply (Eve Arden). They decide to advertise the powers of the formula-laced cereal by challenging Krinkle Krunch, a rival cereal company run by Mr. Kirwood Krinkle (Phil Silvers), to a competition between their sponsored weight-lifting team and Medfield's to see which cereal can give the other greater strength. Krinkle sponsors the well-funded State College.\nKrinkle has a mole named Harry (Dick Van Patten) on the inside who tells the Krinkle president about the formula. Hearing this, he hires A. J. Arno (Cesar Romero) and some of his goons, just released from prison, to steal it. They break in, but are almost caught before they can get it. They then kidnap Schuyler (as no one knows that Dexter's chemical was the vital ingredient of the formula, rather than Schuyler's vitamins). They take him to Chinatown where they use Chinese torture and hypnotism to get the formula. They then hypnotize him to return home and not tell what happened to him. This accidentally causes him to steal a police car, leading to a car chase which gets him thrown in jail. Fortunately, without Dexter's chemical added in, the formula Krinkle Krunch has in the cereal does not give super-strength; when Krinkle tries it, he ends up breaking his hand. While he berates the mole on the phone, the mole realizes that if they do not know that the formula does not work, then Medfield does not know either and will lose the weight-lifting competition.\nOn the day of the competition, Dexter realizes it was his formula that gave the cereal super-strength; he sets off to the lab to get it, taking the Dean's beautiful but slow vintage car. When he finally gets there, he is confronted by Arno and 10 of his goons. By drinking some of the formula, Dexter is able to beat up all the men, then uses Harry to strike Arno and his men down like bowling pins. He hears on the radio that he must return to the contest in four minutes or forfeit. He adds some formula to the car's fuel tank, which makes it race off at high speed, shedding parts as it goes. He makes it in time to compete last, but the car is a complete wreck, to the Dean's horror.\nMedfield is losing badly, but Dexter uses the last of his super-strength to lift the 1,111 pound weight and win it for Crumply Crunch and Medfield.

This caused burning rubber to envelop her head, and finally she fell dead into the swimming pool, her head steaming. This causes Chandler to have a bizarre sexual dysfunction. Although initially attracted to women, they would invariably prove to be owners of House of Phillips girdles. When they took off their clothes before sex, he would be reminded of the death of his wife and would not be able to maintain an erection. For this reason he had been having sex with other men, as they don't wear girdles that would remind him of Sarah Lou's horrific immolation. Rather strangely, during the telling of this story, Chandler is being fellated by Sash (Melinda McDowell) and has no apparent erectile problems. The two, while in the basement, discover that Mrs. Hammond had pickled the remains of her husband and kept them in a jar. She tells of the death of her husband, who had been working one day in the grain bin and got covered with grain dust. A swarm of locusts dived on him to eat the dust and in the process devoured much of Mr. Hammond's body.\nDuring the course of the night, many of the guests have sex with each other in various combinations. There are a great many sex toys at Prairie Blossom. Mrs. Hammond explains that her son collected them. They would be delivered in plain brown packages which she would take to him with his morning breakfast. This causes her to wistfully repeat that he \"no longer exists\". One of the guests, a man named Toydy, becomes obsessed with finding the key to a locked door in the house. One of the female guests, Roo (Moira Benson), finds the key but will not give it to Toydy (Rick Johnson) unless he agrees to ejaculate in her mouth. Despite not finding her attractive, Toydy agrees and manages to stay aroused by watching Bond (Ken Scudder) and Willene have sex.\nThe final human guest at Prairie Blossom, Bing (George Kuchar), arrives in an agitated state. He had come from the circus in a vehicle containing a toothless lion, a near-blind elephant, and a female gorilla named Medusa. He explains to the group that Medusa is extremely dangerous and is likely to kill anyone she comes across. It is revealed that Bing himself is the cause of the apes murderous tendencies. His circus-mates, having got Bing drunk, convinced him to have sex with a prostitute. Despite her being hirsute, Bing is too drunk to decline. The next morning, he awakens to the pleasant feeling of being masturbated, though to his horror, the act is being carried out by Medusa, who now has a severe crush on him. She soon realises that her feelings are not being reciprocated and becomes enraged with him, and indeed all men. However, subsequent mistreatment by a female circus-worker causes these feelings to spread to women as well. The only way to calm Medusa is by giving her bananas.\nToydy, having watched Bond and Willene have sex, decides to lie to Bond in order to have sex with him. Toydy says that he has a crate of bananas and will give them to Bond if he will have sex with him. Bond considers this carefully, not having had a homosexual encounter before, but agrees on the strength that he and Willene (who has by now forgotten about her husband) can use the bananas to escape the murderous primate. On discovering the deception, Bond takes it in his stride and tells Willene he had to be broken in sometime. He jokes that if things don't work out between himself and her, he can always try for her husband.\nMeanwhile, Toydy having gained the key to the locked door earlier opens it with Roo to discover Prairie Blossom's terrible secret. By morning, the fate of Roo and Toydy is unknown to the others. Chandler and Sash leave together, as do Bond and Willene, though Bond tells her he likes to sleep around too much to really settle down. Bing has married Medusa, though for some reason, he wore the wedding dress.

Back in England, Nora goes into labour and gives birth to a son, Tommy, on V-E Day (\"Captain Walker/It's a Boy\"). Five years later, Nora has begun a new relationship with Frank, a holiday worker she and Tommy meet on their holiday. Tommy looks up to his \"Uncle\" Frank who expresses his desires to run his own holiday camp someday (\"Bernie's Holiday Camp\"). In the 1950s, Nora and Frank dream of their future (\"1951 / What About the Boy?\"), but, late that evening, the returning Captain Walker surprises the couple in bed, leading to a struggle where Frank kills the Captain (in the original album synopsis, the Captain kills Frank). The heat of the moment panics Tommy into a psychedelia-like \"Amazing Journey\", where he outwardly appears \"deaf, dumb, and blind\". Later, at a Christmas party, Nora is distressed that Tommy \"doesn't know what day it is\" (\"Christmas\").\nOver 16 years, Nora and Frank make several fruitless attempts to bring the now older Tommy out of his state (\"Eyesight to the Blind\" / \"The Acid Queen\") and place him with some questionable babysitters (\"Cousin Kevin\" / \"Fiddle About\"). They become increasingly lethargic at the lack of effect and leave Tommy standing at the mirror one night, allowing him to wander off. He follows a vision of himself to a junkyard pinball machine. Tommy is recognized by Frank and the media as a pinball prodigy (\"Extra, Extra, Extra\"), which is made even more impressive with his sensory-impaired state. During a championship game, Tommy faces the \"Pinball Wizard\" with The Who as the backing band. Nora watches her son's televised victory and celebrates his (and her) success and luxury, but finds she can't fully enjoy it because of Tommy's extreme condition (\"Champagne\").\nFrank finds a specialist for Tommy (\"There's a Doctor\") who concludes that Tommy's state is triggered emotionally rather than physically and explains the only hope is to continue having Tommy face his reflection (\"Go to the Mirror!\"). An increasingly frustrated Nora promptly throws Tommy through the mirror (\"Smash the Mirror!\") causing him to snap to full consciousness and run away momentarily (\"I'm Free\"). Tommy reveals that his experiences have transformed him and decides that he wants to transform the world (\"Mother and Son\" / \"Miracle Cure\").\nTommy goes on lecture tours that resemble glam-rock gospel shows and spreads a message of enlightenment by hang glider, gaining friends and followers everywhere he goes (\"Sally Simpson\" / \"Sensation\").

Tommy opens an extension for his religious campus (\"Welcome\" / \"Tommy's Holiday Camp\").\nThe converts, confused about Tommy's odd practices and his family's commercial exploitation of the compound, wrathfully demand Tommy teach them something useful. Tommy does so, deliberately deafening, muting, and blinding everyone, only to inadvertently invoke a riot. The followers kill Nora and Frank and destroy the camp in a fire (\"We're Not Gonna Take It\").

Sam changes the lettering on the trailer of his rig to read \"Sam Hummer and Son\".\nCJ begins dating Jerri and the two want to get married, but Sam dies and the trucking partnership suddenly ends.  As a result, CJ joins the Air Force and is soon sent to Vietnam.  CJ performs well in Vietnam and is deemed a hero, but all he wants to do is return home to Jerri.  Jerri spends her time waiting for his return, which is the subject of the film's theme song \"Drifting and Dreaming\" by Valerie Carter. The opening sequence shows CJ's plane arriving from overseas as Jerri and her brother give him a hero's welcome. We see the two get married and start their life together in humble settings.\nCJ obtains a loan from the bank to purchase a truck. He and Jerri visit a local used truck sales lot where he purchases a repossessed 1974 Ford WT9000 cabover rig with a 350 NTC Cummins turbo diesel engine. The salesman throws in a custom paint job to seal the deal and CJ picks a blue and white paint scheme, highlighted with the words \"BLUE MULE\". Later, the two are jubilant as they drive their new truck through the deserts around Tucson, imagining the new life that awaits them.\nCJ announces to the local listeners on the CB radio that he is in business for himself and is intent on getting as much as he can, so that he can get out of hock to the bank as quickly as possible.\nWhen CJ goes back to work at Red River he finds out that things are very different. He sees unfriendly and unfamiliar faces now working there.  Duane Haller informs him that the company is now hauling un-taxed cigarettes, slot machines and other contraband. Duane further states that if he wants to stay out of trouble and keep working, he\u2019ll have to keep his mouth shut. CJ gets angry and forces his rig to be unloaded, vowing never to haul illegal cargo, but not after having an altercation with Clem, the ringleader of the corrupt goons working the docks.\nLater in the day, Carol Jo is pulled over on a lonely highway and discovers that Deputy \"Bob\", the local sheriff is in on the crooked dealing as well. He handcuffs CJ to his truck and then speeds off.  Clem, along with two other goons from Red River then show up and break his ribs.\nAfter CJ recuperates enough from his injuries, he tries to find work at other trucking companies around Tucson. He discovers that Red River has blackballed him as a troublemaker, and he is unwelcome everywhere he goes. Livid, he returns to Red River with a shotgun and threatens Duane Haller. Duane informs him that he is just a pawn in the game and that the person he actually needs to talk to is Duane\u2019s boss, Buck Wessler (L.Q. Jones).  Buck is a sleazy, lower-level crook who now manages Red River.  Buck agrees to let CJ take a load to Dallas, free of any contraband. Sam Hummer\u2019s old friend \u201cPops\u201d Dinwiddie decides to come along, to help keep CJ safe on his trip.  En route, they are attacked by men from Red River, but manage to fight them off and continue on their way.\nThroughout the rest of the story, CJ tries to make a living by driving daily loads in and out of Tucson, mainly for Red River. He slowly discovers that Red River is actually owned by a large corporation based in Phoenix called the \u201cGlass House\u201d, a diversified energy and transportation company. Unbeknownst to him, though, Glass House is actually a front for organized crime. They use the trucking companies that they own as a transportation system for their syndicate and its illegal shipments.\nOver the course of several months, CJ tries to organize the other drivers at Red River and around Tucson to stand up to the Glass House and refuse to haul illegal cargo.  In the process he is beaten, vandalized, cheated and then eventually framed for Duane Haller\u2019s murder. After his acquittal, CJ discovers the murdered body of Pops Dinwiddie, who had been driving the Blue Mule while CJ was in jail, in his house. This leads to a climactic confrontation with all of the Red River drivers against Buck and his goons at the loading dock.  CJ beats Buck senseless, until CJ\u2019s brother-in-law stops Carnell (Pop's son), also wanting to attack Buck, avenging his father's death.\nA few days later, Carol Jo, Carnell and with all the other Red River Drivers are invited to the Glass House for a meeting with the senior management.  They are propositioned job opportunities with similar business arrangements that the GH had with Buck and his associates.  Not trusting the Glass House nor their shady business practices, Carol Jo declines their offers electing to continue operating on his own and encourages the other drivers to do likewise.\nThat night, CJ and Jerri are viciously attacked by a masked thug during their sleep and their house is set on fire. CJ wakes up and gets both of them out of the house before it partially burns down. Later on at the hospital, the doctor informs him that Jerri has lost the baby she was carrying and will never be able to have children. CJ returns home in despair.\nMoments later, he emerges from the house with a shotgun and gets into the Blue Mule. He radios Deputy \u201cBob\u201d that he is headed for the Glass House and to tell them that he is coming. Bob tries to intercept him on a two-lane road, but CJ runs the deputy off the road, destroying his patrol car. CJ shows up at the Glass House headquarters, faced by several heavily armed security guards who are waiting for him.  He accelerates as fast as he can toward them, but his truck is riddled with bullets, blowing out several tires, the radiator and the windshield. CJ takes one bullet to the face. He manages to run through the security gauntlet, but he knows he won\u2019t be able to get the crippled truck all the way to the corporate headquarters, so he aims for the giant sign that stands in front of the building, an enormous two-story glass structure with the letters \u201cGH\u201d. Carroll Joe runs up an embankment leading to the sign and crashes through it, completely destroying it and his truck at the same time.\nIn the last scene, a TV news reporter is announcing that all truckers in Tucson are on strike.  The strike is being held in protest of the corrupt system set up by the Glass House and in honor of one trucker who dared to stand up against them, Carroll Jo Hummer. CJ\u2019s brother-in-law wheels him out of his hospital room to the parking lot, which is filled with semi-trucks and truckers. They all begin to clap. CJ then begins to smile.

Sir Joshua Smith, a British friend of Eden's, is killed during the raid. Raisuli then issues an outrageous ransom demand, deliberately attempting to provoke an international incident in order to embarrass the Sultan and start a civil war.\nIn the United States, President Theodore Roosevelt is seeking re-election. He decides to use the kidnapping as both political propaganda (coining the phrase \"Pedecaris alive or Raisuli dead!\") and as an effort to demonstrate America's military strength as a new great power, despite the protests of his cautious Secretary of State, John Hay.\nThe American Consul to Tangier, Samuel Gummer\u00e9, is unable to negotiate a peaceful return of the hostages. In response, Roosevelt sends the South Atlantic Squadron, under the command of Admiral French Ensor Chadwick, to Tangier, either to retrieve Pedecaris or to force the Sultan to accede to Raisuli's demands. Roosevelt finds himself gaining more and more respect for Raisuli, thinking him an honorable man who just happens to be his enemy.\nThe Pedecarises are kept as hostages in the Rif, far from any potential rescuers.

Luckily, Raisuli has tracked them and kills the kidnappers with a rifle and sword. He reveals that he does not have any intention of harming the Pedecarises and is merely bluffing.

They decide to engage in \"military intervention\" to force a negotiation by seizing the actual seat of power, the Bashaw's palace in Tangier. Jerome's company of Marines, supported by a detachment of sailors, march through the streets of Tangier, much to the surprise of the European legations, whose forces are with the Sultan at distant Fez. They overwhelm the Bashaw's palace guard, taking the Bashaw hostage and forcing him to negotiate.\nUnder coercion, the Bashaw finally agrees to accede to the Raisuli's demands. But during a hostage exchange, Raisuli is betrayed and captured by German and Moroccan troops under the command of von Roerkel.
