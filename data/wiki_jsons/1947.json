He advises her to notify the police immediately, but she suspects someone is trying to murder her and wants to investigate first.\nA series of flashbacks reveals the possible motives of several suspects. The prime suspect is her irresponsible, philandering husband, Rod, whom she is reluctantly divorcing; he might want her wealth. But there is also Rusty, a resentful young woman who had been raised to believe she was Barbara's younger sister. When Barbara's father died, his will revealed that Rusty was just an orphan he had raised, but not legally adopted; Barbara inherited everything.

The crowd, containing Davin and his friends, who had thought that Parnell was going to speak in favour of eviction, put their rotten eggs away and are instead impressed.\nThe farmers are led by Hugh Davin (Stewart Granger) who, with the moral support of the local priest, Father McKeogh (Alastair Sim), encourages his fellow tenants to ostracize their land agent, the bombastic Captain Boycott (Cecil Parker).

They persuade Carmen to play the part of Fifi. The producer hires both ladies for the job, but Fifi is the new big sensation who gets mentioned in the press. Steve is very attracted to the girls, and to protect Carmen from the producer, Lionel tells him that he is engaged to be married to Carmen. Steve then turns to Fifi and asks her out instead.

Doris, a lonely teenage girl who is neglected by her parents and is in love with Danny, tries to lie on the stand to protect him, but breaks down when pressured by district attorney Burns.\nBefore the prosecution rests its case, Burns' beloved daughter Connie nearly causes a scandal when she admits to being close friends with Danny ten years ago, when they were both living at an orphanage. Burns explains that he was unaware for many years that he had a daughter, since his marriage was annulled and his wife disappeared without telling him she was pregnant.

Connie was unable to say goodbye to her friend Danny before she left the orphanage, and had no further contact with him until the trial.\nMiss Templeton, now elderly and in poor health, arrives to see Danny, having read about the case in the newspapers. She reveals to Danny that he, not Connie, is actually Burns' child, and that she lied and falsified records to pass Connie off as Burns' child instead, because Connie was weaker and was going to die if she wasn't removed from the orphanage. Miss Templeton wants to tell Burns, but Danny makes her promise not to reveal the secret, as he does not want to ruin Connie's good life with the man she thinks is her father.  Nevertheless, Miss Templeton tries to tell the secret to the court anyway, but is interrupted by Danny publicly admitting to shooting Jeff, thus sealing his fate. While Danny is talking, Miss Templeton dies on the stand before she can testify.\nIn the end, Danny is convicted of Jeff's murder but manages to escape the death penalty, instead getting a sentence of life in prison. He is reminded that even a life sentence may be ended early for good behavior, and Connie and Burns promise to help him in every way they can.", "tmdb_id": 87667}, "26618005": {"title": "Dard (1947 film)", "plot": "Nawab Sahib (Badri Prasad) lives with his wife, the Begum (Pratima Devi) and their young daughter Suraiya (Munawwar Sultana).

Geoffrey also discovers a fluorescent paint on the coat, which would suggest it is the same paint as the one used to mark floating objects in water to easier spot and rescue them.  The dead man had no water in his lungs, so he hadn't drowned, but maybe got the paint on him picking something up from the water, for example a life jacket.\nGeoffrey goes to the site on the beach where the body was found and discovers a life jacket as suggested, in a beachcomber shack.

Mr A is a \"methodical, exact\" bank clerk. His wife \"complains [he] has a mind like a double entry column; no virtues, no vices\". She wants a dream for him \"with practical values to widen his horizons, heighten ambitions, maybe a raise in salary\". Joe asks Mrs A to leave the room during Mr A's consultation. Mr A reveals that within his ledger he has a collection of art images cut from magazines, including  drawings of a woman reclining in bed; another on an old man's lap; another being shot by an animal-headed man; a filmic image of red liquid passing through water, and another of a melting wax figure of a woman.\nJoe \"finds a dream\" for Mr A based on these interests. In the dream (\"Desire\") leaves fall to the ground beside a red curtain. A woman in white reclines in a red-curtained four-poster bed. A small golden ball rises and falls from her mouth as she breathes. She swallows the ball, smiles and falls asleep. Jail bars appear by her bed, and a voyeuristic man watches from behind them as the woman dreams of nightingales with calves' hooves. It appears the man is part of her dream, and telephones her to ask in voiceover for details.  She tells him in voiceover \"they talked about love and pleasure\". The telephone by her bedside falls to the floor, breaks open and exudes a misty smoke, which envelops her bed. Two young men tumble over each other in what seems like a war scene of shipwrecked sailors. One of the young men and a woman are pulled from underneath the bed by a man dressed as a formal authority figure (Max Ernst).  The voyeur man watching breaks through the jail bars and  enters the bedroom, raising the woman from her bed, and they embrace.  They exit the room, and awkwardly tumble down through a basement corridor wreathed in steam. The authority figure impassively watches them. The voyeur plays dice in the leaves of a dark brick-lined corridor,  The narrating woman's voice says \"who wants to come with me under my warm white gown,\" repeating the last three words several times and closes with the woman tossing the small golden ball into the air and catching it.\nCase number two (\"The Girl With the Prefabricated Heart\") begins as Joe accepts payment from Mr. A and ends his session, as a young woman wearing a suit, glasses, and a beret enters the room carrying a briefcase, and Mrs. A returns and glares.  The A's leave.  The young woman tries to \"sign Joe up\" for various causes.  In voiceover, she tries to convince Joe while we hear a man's voice telling Joe to resist her.  She flirts, cries, almost leaves, comes back.  The music features a repeated wolf whistle over a light jazz tune.  Joe signs.  He removes her glasses and they almost kiss.  Smoke fills the screen, and clears with a closeup on a dismembered mannequin.  The music is a light tune sung by Holman with the refrain of \"untouched by human hands.\"  It segues into a sequence in which wigged and costumed mannequins seem to dance and pose.  Holman and White sing.  Whirling wheel graphics punctuate the scenes as jewellery is offered to \"a healthy girl\", Julie, as the male singer/mannequin woos her.  She cries \"this is ridiculous! Sisters, come to my aid!\" and \"so from his ardent arms she fled.\" The male mannequin is beheaded as Julie rides on an exercise cycle dressed in a bridal gown.  \"for there's no man alive who could ever survive a girl with a prefabricated heart.\"  We transition back to Joe's office as the young woman leaves, then suddenly returns and kisses him, then leaves again.\nAs she leaves, Mrs. A returns with a garbled, speeded up voiceover expressing her stream of consciousness.

The young woman in the photo reminds Mrs A of herself when she was a carefree girl.

He wants a dream that might help him win the horse races.  The dream consists of spinning disc illusions (by Marcel Duchamp) and a prism distorted version of \u201cNude Descending a Staircase.\u201d  The gangster is unimpressed and robs Joe at gunpoint.  A policeman enters and asks the gangster for a gun license.  The gangster produces it and the cop lets him go.  Joe is knocked unconscious by the gangster who flees the room.\nCase number five and six \u2013 A blind old man and a little girl enter the empty office.

Joe goes to the door and sees that the next customer is himself, standing frozen, surrounded by blocks of ice.  Joe finds a blue poker chip that the little girl left on the floor and he enters his own autobiographical dream.  He is playing poker with his friends around a table being watched over by a classical bust of a bearded man (Morpheus?).  As Joe reaches for a liquor glass, it explodes.

Suddenly Joe realizes the rungs are disappearing from his ladder.  He desperately grabs a window sill and pulls himself inside a room.  Dangling colorful circles surround a woman reclining in a hammock.  She offers Joe a drink, a bowl of cherries and a knife.  He kisses the woman and makes a move to slice open her throat but instead cuts the blue cord he\u2019s been following.  The cord bleeds red.  Joe exits the room and re-enters the poker room.

J. Hollingsworth delivering a sermon from the pulpit of his church. As the view widens, we see a young girl, Jenny Hollingsworth, listening with rapt attention. As the Reverend continues, his speech begins to falter, and Jenny helps him out by continuing a quotation from scripture that he had begun. The Reverend can soon no longer continue, though, and joins Jenny in her pew. Jenny addresses him as \"Grandpappy,\" so we understand the relationship between the two. By this point we realize that Jenny is the only member of the congregation, and the church seems to have been otherwise abandoned. Grandpappy then dies.\nWe next see Jenny trudging down a road through what appears to be desert. She is intermittently singing and talking to herself. We then see an airplane with one engine on fire descending through the night air, with an explosion following. Jenny refers to the fiery figure in the sky as \"Beelzebub\". Soon after the crash, a collie appears, and begins walking with Jenny. Along with the dog, Jenny finds a placard identifying the type of airplane that crashed, and she takes this with her. Dr. Steve Webster then appears along the road, driving his Jeep, and comes across Jenny and the dog, and invites them into his vehicle. Jenny spends the night with Dr. Webster in the home that he shares with Murph, the local pharmacist. Murph is surprised and initially somewhat upset when he discovers Jenny sleeping on the sofa the next morning, with the dog at her side. We then discover that Dr. Webster is conducting research on Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and has a number of infected ticks on his porch, making his home a dangerous place for a young girl. We also learn that he has applied for a grant to teach and study at an institute in San Francisco, and that he is hoping to hear a positive response from them via the mail any day now. Murph gives Jenny a much-needed bath, during which he fills her in on some of the back stories behind the local characters in town, along with some of his folksy philosophy about men and women and marriage.\nDr. Webster takes Jenny to meet his friend Susan Moore, who is living with Mathilda. Mathilda gives Steve and Susan an earful, letting us know that she thinks Steve is a hopeless dreamer, and that Susan is silly to continue waiting for him to propose to her. Jenny, who has grown up with her great-grandfather in isolation, has learned that it is important to tell the truth, and takes most things very literally. She then tells Mathilda what she thinks of her, along with some of what Murph has shared, resulting in Mathilda becoming upset and directing Steve to remove Jenny and the dog from her sight. Steve takes Jenny to Murph's pharmacy for a sundae, but the place is crowded with local children waiting for entrance to the movie house next door, and some of the children are unkind to Jenny, making her feel ashamed of the makeshift dress she is wearing. The ringleader is the mayor's son, who is genuinely cruel to her. When Steve is talking to Murph we learn that Murph has laid in a large stock of vaccine to prevent people from getting the Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but that Steve has not been able to convince the locals to have the vaccine administered to their children. We also learn that the local mayor has influenced the town to build a new park instead of a much-needed hospital, and that the nearest hospital is fifty miles away. Steve then decides that Jenny must have some new clothes to wear, and takes her to another local store to purchase them. He doesn't have enough money to pay for them, though, but arranges to trade tonsillectomies for the three children of the proprietor for Jenny's new clothes, of which she is very proud.\nDr. Webster is called away to attend to a sick boy, Clem Perkins. We learn that Clem has contracted spotted fever. Steve tells Clem's father that they should have had the boy vaccinated earlier, but that there is no medicine now to cure the disease, and that he must simply wait and hope for the best. While Steve is away, Jenny is walking home with her dog, and the mayor's son comes across them, and threatens Jenny. The dog then growls and chases the boy away, catching him and pulling down his pants, but not damaging anything other than the boy's inflated ego. When Steve and Jenny are both back at Murph and Steve's home, the mayor shows up with a gun, saying he is going to shoot the dog. Steve forcefully evicts the mayor from his home but, in the process, the mayor stumbles and falls on the porch, freeing the infected ticks. Steve warns Jenny to stay away from the porch, while Steve tries to secure the area, but Jenny walks through the porch, and we see Jenny rubbing a sore spot on her leg, letting us (but not Steve) know that she has been bitten by one of the ticks. Sheriff Bolton comes to arrest the dog, saying that the dog will be given a fair trial, but must remain in jail until the trial. Jenny weeps, afraid that her dog will be killed. Clem Perkins dies. The parents in town now all send their children to Steve's house to be vaccinated, and a long line forms. Susan and Mathilda both come over to help, and Murph brings more vaccine from his pharmacy. Steve starts to vaccinate Jenny at some point, but is interrupted, and never completes the procedure.\nThe dog's trial takes place. Steve is unavailable to act as defense attorney, and so Murph takes over. The mayor and his counsel insist that the dog bit the mayor's son.

They don't know how much of the serum to give her, though, so they try to contact the institute responsible for the dog and the serum\u2014the same institute to which Steve had applied. However the Institute tells them that Dr. Nicholas Adams is the only person who can answer their question, and he can't be reached, since he is driving to Colorado. Steve asks the local radio station to broadcast an emergency alert, and Dr. Adams hears it, and calls, and they found out the correct dosage just in time to administer the serum and cure Jenny.\nDr. Adams then arrives on the scene. At breakfast the next day, he awards Steve with a $5,000 grant to continue his studies of spotted fever. Steve announces that he will stay in town, will marry Susan, and will adopt Jenny. Dr. Adams says that they have drawn enough blood from the dog to serve their purposes, and so relinquish their claim on him, leaving him to round out the happy home forming with Steve, Susan and Jenny.

Believing the battle will end in slaughter they hatch a plan to capture Marlborough and hold him prisoner until the threat of hostilities passes. They build a contraption to drop Marlborough through a trapdoor onto a mattress in the cellar, however when they elect to test their device, they are killed as the mattress has been removed. Their deaths prevent a planned visit by Queen Anne.\nBurlap and Kelsoe watch their funeral procession and speculate about being ghosts when they are sent a book of rules and regulations as well as documents to sign from beyond.

Lady Mary looks at buying the now empty house however as the Queen hates her Burlap and Kelsoe decide to scare her away. Realising that by scaring Lady Mary away the house will now be labelled as haunted and therefore never sell and be visited by royalty, Burlap and Kelsoe blame each other for the fiasco, quarrel, and refuse to speak to each other. 66 years later, after adopting a ghostly cat, Burlap and Kelsoe receive a Christmas present along with a Christmas Tree and decide to forgive each other.\n15 years later the house is occupied by Madam Millie, who demands to see Burlap and Kelsoe.

Farnum reopens Berkeley Square as a Haunted house, however Burlap and Kelsoe take offence to the fake tours and agree to perform as part of a ghostly show instead. When Prince Albert shows an interest in attending the show Dr. Cruickshank of the Psychical Research Society visits to judge if the ghosts are genuine. He decides that although the haunting is real if he says so in his report he will either be called a liar or the Society (whose purpose is to prove that ghosts do not exist) will be disbanded. He therefore labels Farnum as a hoax, causing the Prince Consort to cancel his visit and Farnum  to leave Berkeley Square. Several years later the house is purchased by the Nawab of Bagwash, an Indian rajah and descendant of Burlap, who does not count as reigning royalty as Queen Victoria has recently become Empress of India. Kelsoe and Burlap learn about mesmerism and attempt to convince the Nawab of Bagwash to invite the Queen to visit, however her visit is cancelled upon discovery of the Nawab of Bagwash's Harem.\nBerkeley Square is sold once again and becomes a soldiers' hospital during the Boer War.

Marguerite is sweet and simple, while Marianne is extremely shrewd and plans to take over the family shipping business. William is the son of Dr. Edmond Ozanne (Frank Morgan), who has recently returned to the island after many years away. Additionally, Dr. Ozanne is the former teenage lover of Sophie Patourel (Gladys Cooper), Marguerite and Marianne's mother. Sophie's mother broke up their youthful romance over Edmond's heavy drinking and lower social status. She married Octavius afterwards, under pressure from her parents.\nMeanwhile, the new clipper ship Green Dolphin arrives in the island's port. The captain of the ship, Captain O'Hara (Reginald Owen), tells William and Marianne of the wonders of the new colony of New Zealand. Captain O'Hara's men catch a stow-away, Timothy Haslam (Van Heflin), who recently killed his brother-in-law in self-defence. Captain O'Hara believes his story and agrees to smuggle the man to New Zealand. Marianne then schemes for her father to sponsor William to be a naval officer.

Plummer and Duke are rival saloon keepers and partners in a mining company, but due to a dispute between them, the mine is closed, leaving many of the townspeople destitute. Plummer has hired the Kansas City Kid, a gunslinger, to kill Duke. When Bill finds out that Duke knows about his plan, he gives Michael a lift into town and as Plummer hopes, Duke mistakes Michael for the Kid.

In the hopes of finding a home with plenty of food, the mice head on up to the House of Tomorrow.  Upon entry, they step on the welcome mat, which activates an audio recording that welcomes visitors to the House of Tomorrow and invites them to try out the many gadgets the house provides.  At first, Bertie is scared by the recording and tries to run away, but Hubie stops him and points out that this is the perfect place for them as everything for them can be provided at the touch of a button.\nAs a demonstration, Hubie pushes a button to the Automatic Record Player: the record player rises up out of the floor, a robotic arm on a table picks out a record disc from a collection of records and tosses it like a frisbee, and two robotic arms (one of them has a catcher's mitt) catch the record, put it on the turntable, and start playing the record.  Hubie and Bertie then start dancing to the music that plays, until Hubie spies a button that demonstrates the Automatic Sweeper.  Upon pressing the button, a cigarette lighter lights a cigar, a robotic puffer puffs the cigar, and a robotic arm taps the cigar ash on to the floor.  This summons the Robot Sweeper, a robot armed with a broom and having a dustpan near its wheels, that comes out, sweeps up the ash into its dustpan, sweeps it into the refuse bin, and returns to its closet.\nImpressed by what Hubie meant by the perfect house, Bertie insists on pushing the next button they come across, but Hubie slaps him and states that he himself will be pushing the buttons as Bertie isn't smart enough to do so.  As the mice go up onto the kitchen counter where some unlabeled buttons are, Bertie again requests to push a button.  Hubie gives in, but (out of fear that whatever button Bertie presses might hurt him) gets a safe distance away on the other side of the kitchen before giving Bertie the A-OK.  Bertie presses a button, where a light next to it reveals it's the laundry button.  This makes a vacuum appear above a hamper, where Hubie just happens to be, and suck up Hubie and the laundry.  Bertie then cringes and shakes as, offscreen (and to the tune of \"Here we go round the mulberry bush\"), Hubie goes through the washing, rinsing, mangling, ironing, and folding processes.  The laundry is then returned all pressed and ironed, with Hubie (looking pressed and ironed himself) at the top.  As a result, Hubie slaps Bertie for putting him through that.\nThe laundry incident is quickly forgotten when both mice spy a button labeled \"Cheese Dispenser\".  When Hubie presses the button, a wheel of cheese flies out, but crashes to the floor, which summons the Sweeper to come out, sweep up the mess, and put it in the bin.  To prevent losing the second wheel of cheese, Hubie arranges for Bertie to stand by to catch the cheese with a plate.  Straight after Hubie presses the button, another wheel of cheese flies out, but crashes on top of Bertie and the plate.  Again, the Sweeper comes out, sweeps up the mess and Bertie, sweeps them into the bin, and return to its closet.  Bertie escapes the bin, but thinking that Bertie is \"escaping refuse\", the Sweeper comes back out, sweeps up Bertie again, sweeps him back into the bin, and returns to its closet.  Twice, Bertie peeks out, but the Sweeper sticks its head out as if to say \"Oh, no you don't!\"\nSeeing this, Hubie comes up with a plan to rescue Bertie.  He does this by taking a large vase up to the house's second floor and tossing it out the window, where it crashes to the ground.  As expected, the Sweeper takes the bait, rushes up to the second floor (allowing Bertie to escape), and jumps out the window where it too crashes to the ground.  Afterwards, Bertie is thanking Hubie for saving him when the doorbell rings and Bertie answers it.  It's the Sweeper (looking battered from its fall) and, as a way of saying \"Nobody tricks me into jumping out of a window and gets away with it\", it sweeps up Bertie again, sweeps him back into the bin, and returns to its closet.\nComing up with another plan to save Bertie, Hubie pushes a box full of dynamite and fireworks off a shelf and onto the floor.  Detecting the new mess, the Sweeper leaves its closet (allowing Bertie to escape again), sweeps up the explosives, and sweeps them into the bin.  Hubie then pushes a lit candle and its holder off the shelf and onto the floor, once more making the Sweeper fall for the ruse.  The Sweeper sweeps up the candle and sweeps it into the bin, but the lit candle makes contact with the explosives already in the bin and they blow up on the Sweeper.  The Sweeper rolls away (dazed and severely damaged by the explosion) and breaks apart to pieces on the floor, but its hand presses a button labeled \"Repair Service\".  This summons the Robot Medic, a hodgepodge looking robot with pincers, a hammer, and a crane arm.  The Robot Medic leaves the same closet the Sweeper resides in, rebuilds the Sweeper offscreen, and both robots return to their closet.\nTo really drive the Sweeper crazy, Hubie and Bertie nail the floor doors of the Automatic Record Player shut so that when Hubie presses the button, the record player can't rise up out of the floor.  The robotic arm still picks out a record and tosses it, but with nothing to catch it, the record crashes against the wall and breaks into pieces which land on the floor, thus summoning the Sweeper to clean up the mess.  Hubie then increases the robotic arm's speed to fast, thus making the robotic arm toss the records at the wall faster than ever before.  The Sweeper returns to clean up the mess from the next record, but soon finds itself facing flying records that smash against the wall and tries to keep with cleaning up one mess after another.  Soon, the Sweeper's dustpan is so full of broken record pieces that when it tries to empty them into the bin, they just bury the bin.  Fed up with the ever increasing messes, the Sweeper dons a coat and hat, picks up a briefcase, puts an \"I Quit!\" sign on its closet door, and leaves the house.\nHubie starts to revel in their victory over the Sweeper, but the victory is short lived when Bertie spies a button labeled \"Spring Cleaning Service\" and stupidly pushes it.  This ends up summoning a whole army of Robot Sweepers that come straight out of another closet and begin cleaning up the place.  Hubie and Bertie try to escape the onslaught, but get caught up in a carpet being rolled up by one of the Sweepers and taken outside.  In the cartoon's final scene, as the Sweepers begin the carpet beating process and whack the mice in the process, Hubie says \"HEY, BOIT!

Chastising the ad men for his having to do their work for them, Evans informs them that Hare's agent Dave Lash (Edward Arnold) will be leaving for the coast on that evening's train. Vic promises to ink a deal on board, before word of Evans's interest leaks out and boosts Hare's price. On the way to the station, he stops at Kay's house, but she is remote: \"You'll make any promise to make your point,\" and he replies, \"That's the kind of guy I am.\" Their parting is unsettling for each.\n\nOn the train, Vic bumps again into Jean Ogilvie, whom he recruits for his plan to sign Hare; with her shilling, he gets Lash to offer Hare at a bargain basement price. They shake on the deal, and when Lash realizes he has been had, he graciously agrees to honor it.\nOnce in Hollywood, Vic and his writers set about creating the radio show for Hare; early on, they ban him from the proceedings because he is so obnoxious and his jokes are both off-key and threadbare.

Though it appears to be based on an honest mistake by Lash, Vic uses cruel innuendo about Lash's childhood and implied blackmail to get the agent to agree to absorb the large loss he will face making good.

Finally, the horse begs him to let her go and in return gives him two beautiful black male horses and a little humpbacked horse (Konyok-gorbunok) to be his companion.\nIvan leads the two black horses to a stable and runs off with Konyok-gorbunok to fetch them buckets of water. When he comes back, he finds that his brothers have taken his horses. Konyok-gorbunok tells him that they will catch them in the city, so Ivan sits on its back and they go flying through the clouds. Along the way, Ivan finds the fiery feather of a firebird, which shines without giving off any heat, and takes it despite Konyok-gorbunok's warning that it will cause him difficulty later.\nThey reach the city, and Ivan outwits his brothers and sells his black horses to the Tsar. When it is found that nobody can control them except Ivan, he is put in charge of the Tsar's stables. Spalnik, one of the Tsar's courtiers (identified as a chamberlain in the original Russian and either a soothsayer or a groom in various English dubbings), takes a disliking to Ivan and hides himself in the stables to watch him at work so that he can think of a way to remove him from the Tsar's favour. After seeing Ivan use the firebird's feather for light, he steals it from him and shows it to the Tsar, who commands Ivan to catch him a firebird or lose his post.\nWith Konyok-gorbunok's help, Ivan catches one and brings it back to the Tsar. Spalnik tells the Tsar to make Ivan catch a beautiful Tsar-Maid, so the Tsar summons him and tells him that the consequences will be dire if he doesn't bring her within three weeks. Ivan again manages to do this.\nThe elderly Tsar is overjoyed and begs the young maiden to marry him, but she refuses, telling him that she would only marry him if he were young and handsome, and that to become young and handsome he would need to bathe first in boiling milk, then in boiling water, and finally in freezing water. Spalnik tells him to try this out on Ivan first, hoping at last to be rid of his nemesis. The Tsar agrees, and when Ivan protests upon being told of this the Tsar orders him to be thrown into prison until everything is ready the next morning. Konyok-gorbunok comes to Ivan and through the prison bars tells him not to worry - to simply whistle for him in the morning and let him put a magic spell on the water so that it will not be harmful to him. Spalnik overhears this, and kidnaps Konyok-gorbunok just as he is walking away from Ivan.\nIn the morning, Ivan whistles for Konyok-gorbunok, who is tied up in a bag. He manages to free himself eventually, knocking Spalnik out a window and into a well. Spalnik presumably falls to his death when the rope holding the bucket breaks, and Konyok-gorbunok comes to Ivan's rescue at the last moment, putting a spell on the three cauldrons of water. Ivan jumps into the boiling milk, then the boiling water and then the freezing water, and emerges as a handsome young man instead of a boy. The young maiden falls in love with him and they walk away. Meanwhile, the Tsar gets excited and decides that he also wants to be young and handsome. However, the spell is no longer working, so after he jumps into the boiling milk he doesn't come back out. Ivan, meanwhile, takes the maiden as his own wife and becomes the new Tsar, with Konyok-gorbunok continuing to follow him as his friend."}, "23919342": {"title": "Hungry Hill (film)", "plot": "A feud is waged between two families in Ireland \u2013 the Brodricks and the Donovans \u2013 over the sinking of a copper mine in Hungry Hill by \"Copper John\" Brodrick.

As Michael and Elsa wait and pretend to watch the show, Michael realizes that she killed Grisby. Michael passes out from the pills he took just as Elsa's Chinese friends arrive; they carry the unconscious Michael to an empty fun house. When he wakes, he realizes that Grisby and Elsa had been planning to murder Bannister and frame him for the crime, but that Broome's involvement ruined the scheme and that Elsa had to kill Grisby for her own protection.\nThe film features a unique climactic shootout in a hall of mirrors involving a multitude of false and real mirrored images in the Magic Mirror Maze, in which Elsa is mortally wounded and Bannister is killed. Heartbroken, and ignoring Elsa's pleas to save her life, Michael leaves presuming that the events which have unfolded since the trial will clear him of any crimes.

He is invited to the publisher's offices to discuss his work, but soon realizes it is merely a ploy. A few days before Christmas, publishing executive Adrienne Fromsett hires him to locate Chrystal Kingsby, the wife of her boss, Derace Kingsby. One month earlier, Kingsby\u2019s wife had sent her husband a telegram saying she was heading to Mexico to divorce him and marry a man named Chris Lavery. But, according to Fromsett, Lavery says he has not seen Chrystal for two months, and the telegram appears to be fake. It becomes obvious to Marlowe that Fromsett wants her boss for herself.\nMarlowe goes to see Lavery, who claims to know nothing about any trip to Mexico. Lavery, however, says that Mrs. Kingsby was a beautiful woman before revising it to \"is.\" He sucker-punches the detective, and Marlowe wakes up in jail. He is questioned by Captain Kane and a belligerent Lieutenant DeGarmot. Marlowe refuses to divulge anything, and Kane releases him.\nMarlowe learns that a woman's body has been recovered from a lake on which Kingsby owns property, and that Kingsby's caretaker, Mr. Chess, was charged with the murder of his wife Muriel. Fromsett suspects that Chrystal is the real killer, as she and Muriel hated each other. Little Fawn Lake was also where Chrystal was last seen. Marlowe learns that Muriel was an alias for a woman named Mildred Havelend and that she was hiding from a tough cop, whose description fits DeGarmot.\nMarlowe goes to see Lavery again. Inside the unlocked house, he encounters Lavery's landlady, Mrs. Fallbrook, holding a gun she claims to have just found. Upstairs, he finds Lavery dead, shot several times. He also finds a handkerchief with the monogram \"A F\".\nBefore calling the police, Marlowe goes to the publishing house to confront Fromsett, interrupting a Christmas party. In private, she denies killing Lavery. Kingsby, learning that Fromsett had hired Marlowe to find Chrystal, tells her theirs will be strictly a business relationship from now on. A furious Fromsett fires the private eye, but Kingsby immediately hires him to find his wife.\nMarlowe informs the police of Lavery's death. At the scene, he suggests that Muriel was hiding from DeGarmot. DeGarmot slaps Marlowe, and the two men scuffle. Kane takes Marlowe into custody, releasing him only out of Christmas spirit.\nMarlowe obtains more information on Muriel from a newspaper contact. She had been a suspect in the suspicious death of her previous employer's wife. The investigating detective, DeGarmot, ruled that death a suicide; the victim's parents strongly disagreed. Marlowe finds the parents have been intimidated into silence. His car is then run off the road by DeGarmot. Regaining consciousness after the crash, Marlowe gets to a pay phone and calls Fromsett for help. She takes him to her apartment, where she claims that she has fallen in love with him. They spend Christmas Day together while he recovers from his injuries.\nKingsby receives a phone call from his wife, asking for money and, unable to find Marlowe, goes to Fromsett's apartment to ask her if she has seen the detective. Marlowe agrees to give Kingsby's money to Chrystal, as Kingsby is being followed by police detectives. Placing his trust in Fromsett, Marlowe instructs her to have the police trail him, following a trail of rice he will leave.\nThe woman Marlowe meets turns out to be Mildred Havelend, alias the \"landlord\" Mrs. Fallbrook, alias Muriel.

In need of money to invest, Verdoux, as M. Floray, visits Lydia Floray (Margaret Hoffman) and convinces her he is her absent husband. She complains that his engineering job has kept him away too long. That night, Verdoux murders her for her money.\nAt a dinner party with his real wife and their friend the local chemist, Verdoux asks the chemist about the drug he developed to exterminate animals painlessly. The chemist explains the formula and that he had to stop working on it after the local pharmaceutical board banned it.

Later at his furniture office he attempts to recreate the drug.\nShortly thereafter, Verdoux finds The Girl (Marilyn Nash) taking shelter from the rain in a doorway and takes her in. When he finds she was just released from prison and has nowhere to go, he prepares dinner for her with wine laced with his newly developed poison. Before drinking the wine, she thanks him for his kindness, and starts to talk about her husband who died while she was in jail. After she says her husband was a helpless invalid and that made her all the more devoted to him, Verdoux says he thinks there's cork in her wine and replaces it with a glass of unpoisoned wine.

A sinister figure (Lorre) listens at the office door. Carlotta gives Ronnie her address, a coded map, and a $5,000 ring as payment, telling him that no one must know he's a detective.\nRonnie hides the map in the cups next to his office water cooler. He then drives to the address, which is a mansion down the Peninsula. Kismet (Peter Lorre) greets him at the door, lifting his handgun. Carlotta tells Ronnie that the missing man is her uncle, not her husband. He entered the country on some secret mission, she says. The mansion belongs to Major Montague, Carlotta says, her uncle's former partner.  Major Montague enters the room and tells Carlotta she has a phone call.\nWhen Carlotta leaves, Montague tells Ronnie that he had Kismet follow Ronnie from his office; he knows that Ronnie is a private detective.  He tells Ronnie that Carlotta is mentally ill and introduces him to a wheelchair-using man in the next room as Carlotta's uncle, who obviously hasn't been kidnapped. Ronnie tells Montague that Carlotta had given him a map to hold. Carlotta re-enters the room and, alone with Ronnie, tells him that the call was from her uncle, who told her he was safe, but was forced to call. She suspects Montague, because he lied to Ronnie about her. He returns her ring, confused about whether Montague or Carlotta's telling the truth. Eventually, he believes her, and Carlotta tells him to guard the map with his life.\nAs Ronnie leaves, he finds that his handgun is missing. He climbs a tree and sees the gang conferring through a window before the shade is pulled.  He sees \"Uncle\" stand up from the wheelchair and walk around the room.

Carlotta is also prisoner there. Montague explains that Carlotta's uncle had turned down his offer to buy mineral rights. Carlotta's real uncle is then wheeled into the room to prove he is unhurt. He asks Carlotta to light his cigarette, puts it out, and then returns it to her. When Ronnie refuses to reveal the whereabouts of the coded map, Kismet slugs him.

She reveals to her that they are \"untouchables\" and that Ganga's lineage was unknown - which would make it impossible for her to marry an upper caste Madhu Sudan. Heart broken by the revelation that she could never marry her love, Ganga quietly goes to the pond, jumps into it and dies while her mother watches from a distance. In the meanwhile, Madhu Sudan brushes aside the princess's objections to his decision to choose Ganga over her.  Enraged, the princess breaks the artifacts built by him.  Madhu Sudan remains undeterred and leaves the palace.  Ganga is found to be missing and Madhu Sudan, Ganga's father and some other men frantically look for her. They call out her name by the pond.\nA maid tells a distraught princess that her little sister has been found.  She gets up and quickly goes to meet her sister but soon returns saying angrily that those people were lying and trying to deceive her to gain wealth and that her little sister Kamal had a special circular mark/formation on the palm of her right hand. This was not known to anyone until this time.  Since Ganga had such a mark on her right hand the rumor goes around that Ganga was the younger princess. The Princess announces a large reward for whoever will find Ganga.  Ganga's mother brings her dead body out of the pond and asks the princess to give her the reward.  The princess cries in deep remorse.\nA few days later a blue lotus (neel kamal) is seen growing in the pond at the spot where Ganga's body was found.  Madhu Sudan sees this.  Surprised, he exclaims that a rare and his favorite variety of lotus has suddenly grown in the pond that never had lotus flowers growing in it.  He wanted lotus flowers to grow in the pond and had even tried to install a blue lotus flower carved from stone in the pond one day while Ganga- princess Kamal watched him.  His mentor had talked him out of the idea of installing stone flower/s in the pond.  Madhu Sudan feels that Ganga has fulfilled his heart's wish by taking the form of the beautiful blue lotus flower in the pond.  To honor and reciprocate her love, he decides to fulfill Ganga's wish of going into the temple with him - He carries the blue lotus flower into the temple and offers it to the gods.  Putting his skepticism aside Madhu Sudan humbly says to the god that he never thought he would have to come to his temple for such a tragic reason. Madhu Sudan then lays the beautiful flower at the feet of the god.", "tmdb_id": 440016}, "14893908": {"title": "New Orleans (1947 film)", "plot": "A Storyville casino owner and a high society opera singer fall in love during the birth of the blues in New Orleans.", "tmdb_id": 91729}, "26227694": {"title": "News Hounds", "plot": "Slip is a copy boy for a newspaper, but dreams of having his own byline.

The nearest doctor, a foreigner, refuses to treat him without adequate payment and he is taken instead to a traditional healer (curandero). The doctor does not want anything to do with the natives. Later, the doctor and his brother (Wagner), a loan shark, meet Kino after he finds a valuable pearl and they decide to steal it from him.\nThe opening scene shows waves crashing and people of the village standing on the beach watching. The first couple of minutes portrays that the people rely on the natural resources to survive. The houses are built out of wood and the ocean provides oysters for them to eat. Although they rely on it, the resources, like the pearl, can be dangerous. As the men of the village watch the ocean waiting for it to calm they must wait another day to dive for resources. The next day as the men go out to dive Kino stumbles upon a majestic pearl. He immediately grabs it and returns to his wife.\nJuana, Kino's wife, is convinced that the pearl only brings bad luck and tries to convince Kino to return the pearl to the sea. But Kino refuses to listen because he has hope that the pearl will change their lives once he sells the pearl. To Juana, the pearl represents death but for Kino, the pearl represents freedom. Kino tries to do his best to support his family, he believes the pearl is the way out of poverty. Now that Kino is \"rich\" he wants to buy a gun and new shoes. He also wants his son to be able to read. Kino believes that if his son acquires knowledge, they will also gain knowledge which will set them free. The villagers follow the family around with the pearl and play music while attempting to get a look at the pearl. The doctor that had refused to help Juanito tries to get the Pearl from the family by claiming he will help the already healthy infant son in exchange for the much more valuable pearl.\nOnce Kino and his family head to town, the dealers make him a deal that is not near the total worth for the pearl, and try to convince Kino that the pearl is worthless and the deal is the best he will get. The men want to prevent Kino from gaining social mobility, and they want him and his family to remain at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Kino does not accept the deal and decides to go to the city instead. Kino starts drinking with these men who were most likely only with him to get him intoxicated enough to get the pearl. But when the men try and rob him he doesn\u2019t have the pearl. His wife had kept the Pearl on her as she knew something would happen to him.\nLater on his brother comes to help and helps Kinos family escape through the night. The family is then chased, only confirming the predictions of Juana.\nAt one point Juana takes the pearl from Kino because she wants to throw it into the ocean. Kino chases after her, and hits her. The two decide that they are going to run away. They try to take a boat but they it tips over before they are able to get very far. As they run away they are followed by two natives and a man on a horse. The wife eventually gets very tired and she wants to be left alone. She does not have shoes and therefore her feet are very bloody. Kino refuses to leave her and she goes with him because he is her husband. Eventually the men have them trapped on a cliff. One of the men fires a shot which kills the baby. At the end Kino and Juana throw the pearl off of the highest ledge to get rid of it. The pearl gave Kino and his family a chance for a better life, but in their society it was completely unacceptable. The film depicts the issue of colorism where only those with fairer skin can have the money and resources to live comfortably. Kino and his family were considered to be indigenous, and therefore were seen as at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Everyone in the society tried to make sure that they stayed at the bottom of the social hierarchy, and try to steal the pearl from them.

Her shop is in fact a front for a bookmaking operation. One evening when she closes up for the night, she gives a silent signal to two masked gunmen lurking outside. These two bandits then burst into the shop and hold up both Calhoun and her unsuspecting assistant, Marie Westin. The money they steal is betting money from the illegal operation.\nDuring the robbery, a policeman on patrol in the neighborhood hears Westin's screams. He sees the hold up and tries to interrupt the robbery. As the policeman intervenes, he shoots one of the robbers, \"Cowie\" Kowalski, but is then shot and killed by the other robber, Duke Martin. The two robbers then escape the scene in a laundry truck, and Martin drops off Kowalski at a doctor's house for medical care. Before leaving Martin reminds Kowalski of the plan to implicate a certain Steve Ryan in the crime.\nLater on, Calhoun and Westin are interrogated by detectives Mickey Ferguson and Jim Chubb.

Calhoun's version is believed, and soon the sandy-haired Steve Ryan, who usually drives the laundry truck and whose Navy scarf was found at the shop, is found and brought in for questioning. After a round of tough questioning by Ferguson and Chubb, Steve Ryan is then taken to a hospital, where Kowalski identifies him as the killer.\nSteve Ryan claims that he is being framed by Kowalski for something he didn't do. He says the reason for this is that he beat up Kowalski for making a pass at his sister Rosie Ryan. But the detectives don't believe his story. Calhoun too confirms Kowalski's identification, and the unfortunate Steve Ryan is arrested. His sister Rosie Ryan is sure of her brother's innocence.\nRosie Ryan pleads her brother's case to detective Ferguson, but he is quite convinced of Steve Ryan's guilt and intends to perform a thorough investigation.

Martin also tells Calhoun that she should lay low and disappear for a while, until Steve Martin's trial. Rosie Ryan goes straight to Westin's beauty shop, but is unable to find her. Also looking for Westin is Ferguson, and he finds her outside the shop and offers her a ride home.

Henry, however, proves to be a hard worker.\nWhen storekeeper and unofficial banker Cal Baggett visits the family to ask about repayment of a loan, Henry talks him into hosting a \"play party\", inviting everyone, regardless of affiliation, to help heal the rift in the community. Gill is strongly opposed to it, but Henry tricks him into bringing his family.\nAt first, the two groups do not mix, but Sairy talks Northern sympathizer Dan Yeary into dancing with her, breaking the ice. Soon, everyone is having a very good time. However, an argument breaks out about the playing of a tune associated with the North. To forestall a fight, Cal calls for a vote. Unfortunately, it is a tie. Gill calls upon Henry to cast the deciding vote. Henry is finally forced to reveal that he fought for the Union. After that, the party quickly breaks up, much to the secret delight of John Dessark and his son Badge.\nHenry is no longer welcome at the MacBeans. He does not leave the area though; he starts building a schoolhouse.\nEventually, Lissy Anne can no longer bear to be apart from Henry. She walks away into the night with him, without her father's knowledge but with her mother's approval. Gill tracks them down with a bloodhound, intending to shoot his would-be son-in-law. When five masked nightriders approach, Henry strikes Gill unconscious and seizes his rifle. The horsemen start shooting to kill. Taking cover Henry kills four and captures the fifth after a lengthy footchase and fistfight at a burnt-out dwelling. It is Badge Dessark. He confesses that his father is behind the raids, not out of loyalty to the South, but simply for financial profit. With the Dessarks hanged, the community starts to heal.\nFinally, Henry reveals why he sought out the MacBeans. In a flashback, it is revealed that he first met Ben as they were walking across the hills to enlist in the war. As they traveled together singing and laughing, they became good friends. Approaching the turn-off signpost they decided in jest on a foot race to see who could be the first to reach it. Henry ended up on the north branch, with Ben on the south. They were stunned by their differing allegiances. Henry ultimately persuaded Ben into coming with him. Two days before the war's end, Ben was killed suddenly. Before dying, he made Henry promise to help the family with the harvest.

Brewton (Spencer Tracy) telling her to board the train for New Mexico to marry him in the small town of Salt Fork. The first person she meets in town is Brice Chamberlain (Melvyn Douglas), who warns her of likely unhappiness with Brewton, locally considered a tyrant. He takes her to the courthouse, where she sees Brewton testifying against a settler who had tried to stake a claim to part of the government-owned land where Brewton runs his cattle.\nBack at the ranch, Brewton takes her out to see the vast prairie. He explains how he had fought with Indians to run his cattle there and to make it fit for ranching. He runs his cattle on government-owned land, and opposes homesteaders because he believes the Great Plains do not get enough rain to sustain farming. Lutie struggles to understand Brewton's attraction to the forbidding prairie, but she tries to make the most of her new home.\nShe persuades Brewton to allow a family of settlers onto the ranch, because she had befriended one of them. Brewton warns her that the settlers will not last more than six months, due to some unforeseeable, but certain, circumstance. When Lutie visits the settlers as they build their sod house, she is surprised to see Chamberlain. He is visiting the settlers because he had helped them file their claim on the land. He rides with Lutie on her way back home and confesses his attraction to her. Lutie confesses her struggles to adapt to her new home and her husband's emotional distance. Lutie gives birth to a daughter, Sara Beth.\nDuring a great blizzard, the settlers are alarmed by the sound of Brewton's cattle near their house. Fearful for his wheat crop, knowing its destruction would spell the ruin of his farm, the man goes out of the house with his rifle, planning to scare off the cattle. When they stampede, he shoots and kills one of the cows; he also wounds one of Brewton's cowboys, who were trying to herd the cattle in the storm. The rest of the ranch hands severely beat the farmer. His pregnant wife goes into the fierce storm to help him inside and loses her baby. When Lutie learns of the incident, she rides quickly out to the settlers' house, but they refuse to see her. Having lost their crop and baby, they are broken and concede the land to Brewton.\nBrewton tells Lutie that he had warned her the settlers faced severe challenges. Furious with him, Lutie decides to leave Salt Fork for a while. She goes to Denver. While planning to return to St. Louis, she runs into Chamberlain. The two have a discreet affair, and Lutie decides to return to Brewton. After her return to Salt Fork, she gives birth to a boy, whom she names Brock. She continues to struggle in Brewton's world.\nChamberlain successfully lobbies for a Federal District Court in Salt Fork, and he wins election as its judge. He will preside over land disputes, which increase as the government encourages homesteading. Brewton believes that Chamberlain will decide in favor of settlers on \"his\" land. As he arms himself and his men to ward off the settlers, Lutie pleads with him to reconsider. They argue in the abandoned sod house, where Brewton prepares his ammunition, and he gets Lutie to confess to the affair with Chamberlain. She agrees to leave, but Brewton refuses to let her take the two children.\nBack in St. Louis, she consults a lawyer. He says that if she testifies in court that Chamberlain is Brock's father, she could win custody of her son, but she would certainly lose custody of Sara Beth. Convinced that fighting would cause too much damage to her children, Lutie stays away. She returns after two years in a futile attempt to reconnect with them, who no longer recognize her. Chamberlain tries to get her to fight for Brock's custody so they can run away together as a family, but Lutie says that she does not love him enough to marry him.\nAs the years pass, the town doctor keeps Lutie informed about her children through letters. On his deathbed, he chides Brewton for driving Lutie away by his emotional distance. After the doctor's death, Chamberlain takes up the correspondence to tell Lutie about her children. He shares his concerns that Brock has grown into a reckless young man, too endowed with charm and luck.\nFor years, Brock has endured taunts from townsfolk about his \"real father,\" but the truth has never been acknowledged outright. During a card game, his opponent refers repeatedly to Brock only as \"judge\", referring to Chamberlain. Brock gets drawn into conflict and, when his opponent draws his pistol, Brock shoots him fatally in the stomach. Once Brock is bailed out of jail, he returns home and confesses the incident to his father and sister. Brewton insists that Brock return to town and stand trial. In private, Brock confesses to his sister that he could not stand a trial because it would bring up the reason for the fight, and humiliate their father. Brock decides to flee, and the sheriff pursues him with a posse. Brewton goes after him when Sara Beth tells why Brock skipped bail.\nBrewton reaches the cabin where the posse is exchanging gunfire with Brock, who is holed up inside. When Brewton enters the cabin, he finds his son fatally shot.\nHaving read in the newspaper that Brock was on the run, Lutie returns by train to Salt Fork. Just before arriving, she learns that he has been killed. She decides to keep traveling to San Francisco later that night. In town, she sees Brewton escorting Brock's body to the church, and she hides from view.\nSara Beth visits her mother in her hotel room, warning her against trying to see Brewton and stirring up more trouble.

The mild-mannered Harold is quickly offered a job by the pompous advertising tycoon J.E. Waggleberry. Although Harold dreams of becoming an \"ideas man\", Waggleberry assigns him to a lowly position in the bookkeeping department.\nIn 1945, the now middle-aged Harold is let go by Waggleberry for old age and not being an ideas-man. He is given an 18 karat Swiss watch and a severance check for $2,946.12, the remains of his company investment plan. He bids farewell to Miss Otis, a young woman who works at an artist's desk down the aisle, giving her the paid-for engagement ring that he had, having planned to marry each of her six older sisters (Hortense, Irma, Harriet, Margie, Claire, and Rosemary) when they had worked there before her. He wanders out, aimlessly through the streets, his life's savings in his trouser pocket.\nHarold is approached by Wormy, a local con artist, petty gambler, and racetrack tout, who asks Harold for some money so he can place a bet. Seeing the large amount of cash that Harold has, and hoping to get him drunk enough to acquire some of the cash, Wormy takes Harold to a local bar for a drink. When Harold tells the bartender, Jake, that he has never had a drink in his life, the barkeep creates a potent cocktail he calls \"The Diddlebock\". The effects of the alcohol causes Harold to yowl uncontrollably. Gazing at himself in the bar mirror, Harold suddenly declares himself a loser and races out to remake himself. Soon Harold is getting his hair cut and his nails manicured at a local tailor shop and salon, and is trying on a gaudy plaid suit supplied by tailor Formfit Franklin. In the midst of his transformation, Harold overhears Wormy talking with his bookie Max, and impulsively bets $1,000 of his money on a 15-to-one long shot horse named Emmaline. To everyone's surprise, Emmaline wins, and the now-rich Harold celebrates all around town on a day-and-a-half binge of spending, gambling, and carousing.\nDays later, Harold wakes up on the sofa inside the house of his widowed sister Flora. She chastises him for his behavior. He is hungover, and finds he has a garish new wardrobe and a ten-gallon cowboy hat. Unable to remember much about his drunken binge, Harold goes to return the plaid suit and is surprised to learn that he now owns a horse-drawn cab, complete with an English driver named Thomas. A worried Wormy then rushes up and informs Harold that, with winnings from a second bet, Harold also bought a bankrupt circus. Seeing no future with the ownership of the circus, Harold gets the idea to sell the circus to a Wall Street banker.\nHarold and Wormy visit the circus-loving Wall Street banker Lynn Sargent, but he turns them down because he is trying to unload his own bankrupt circus. When the rest of the town's bankers follow suit, Harold comes up with an idea. To get past the bank guards, Harold dresses up in his plaid suit and brings along Jackie, a tame circus lion, who incites panic. Carrying a filled Thermos, Wormy gives shot drinks of the potent \"Diddlebock\" cocktail to each of the bankers they visit so their inhibitions will fade and convince them to put in bids for ownership of the circus.\nHarold, Wormy, and Jackie the Lion are arrested and thrown in jail. Miss Otis bails them out the following day. They find that the publicity has attracted a mob of bankers at the jail who want to buy the circus \u2013 but Ringling Brothers outbids them.

On board, he finds a map to the lost treasure of Alexander the Great on the fabled island of Deryabar. However, when he sails to Basra, the ship is confiscated by the local Khan, to be sold at auction. Sinbad obtains an agreement that he may keep the ship if there are no bids. He scares away all the bidders with not-so-subtle comments about the ship being cursed. At the last moment, one bidder appears, a veiled woman borne by four servants. She is Shireen (O'Hara), part of the harem of the powerful Emir of Daibul (Anthony Quinn). Sinbad bids against her and ends up owing a huge sum he cannot pay. He steals the auctioneer's own money to pay for the ship.\nVisiting Shireen that night in her garden, Sinbad learns of a mysterious and deadly person known as Jamal, who will stop at nothing to acquire the treasure. Jamal, only vaguely seen behind a curtain, makes an attempt on Sinbad's life. Sinbad escapes and steals the ship, acquiring a rough crew to man it. Strange stories of the evil Jamal circulate among the crew, but no one alive has ever seen him.\nAfter several days, Sinbad sails to another port and goes, risking death, to visit Shireen in the harem. He is captured, but because the Emir believes him to be the Prince of Deryabar, he becomes his \"guest\". With his smooth words and some trickery, Sinbad once again escapes, taking Shireen with him. They set sail for Daryabar, but are overtaken and captured by the Emir. It is then revealed that Sinbad's ship's barber, Abdul Melik (Walter Slezak) is none other than Jamal, who has memorized (and then destroyed) the map to Deryabar. Forming an uneasy alliance of convenience, they all sail to the treasure island.\nThere they convince the lone resident of the ruins of Alexander's palace, the aged Aga (Alan Napier), that Sinbad is his lost son, owing to a medallion Sinbad had since childhood. When the Emir threatens to kill Sinbad, Sinbad confesses his true identity as just a sailor. Nevertheless, Aga capitulates and shows them the fabulous treasure's hiding place. He later informs Sinbad that he had given his son to sailors to shield him from treasure hunters; Sinbad is indeed his son and the true Prince of Daryabar.\nWhen it is discovered that Jamal had intended to poison the Emir and his crew to have the treasure to himself, the Emir forces him to drink the deadly liquid himself. Sinbad escapes again, boards the Emir's ship and frees his crew. The Emir is killed by Greek fire catapulted at him from his own ship.\nThe disbelieving listeners around the campfire accuse Sinbad of telling yet another tall tale, but soon change their minds when he distributes precious jewels and gold.

The musician is too badly shaken to answer Nick's questions, though Nora's presence seems to calm him down. When Nora sneaks back later by herself, Buddy becomes agitated, confesses to the murder, pulls out the antique gun, and tries to shoot Nora but misses. Nick does not believe the deranged man's confession as Drake was slain by a well-aimed shot.\nNick gathers all the suspects by arranging a party on the reopened Fortune and announces that Buddy has fully recovered and that he will reveal the murderer's identity that night. It is Nora who notices the crucial clue: Amboy's wife shows up wearing a valuable necklace that matches the earrings owned by Mitchell Talbin's wife, Phyllis. Sometime later, the necklace mysteriously reappears on Phyllis's neck. When Nick confronts Mitchell, Phyllis reveals that it was she who paid off her lover Drake's debt using the necklace. As Nick prompts Buddy to finger the killer, Mitchell confesses to both killings and pulls out a gun. An enraged Phyllis shoots him first, but her husband is only wounded.
