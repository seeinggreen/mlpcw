ACP Sulekha is appointed to lead the investigation, where she decides to unearth Christopher's previous encounter killings instead of probing by looking into the case files. \nSulekha learns that Christopher's motive to become an IPS officer and encounter specialist is due to some gruesome incidents during his childhood. Years ago, during a riot in Kerala, a group of young men used the situation to brutally rape and murder Christopher's sister. They also killed his parents and set his house on fire. A young Christopher seeked to avenge his loved ones and chased the perpetrators with a butcher's knife. However, Christopher was stopped by a kind and upright police officer, SP Vetrivel IPS. When Vetrivel learnt about the injustice that happened to Christopher's family, he shot the perpetrators to death. This incident inspired Christopher to become a police officer.

From the investigation, it was found out that the real culprit was Beena's younger brother, Sebastian who was a drug addict. Beena and her father Chackochan who was an MP along with Abhilash, settled the issue by paying a huge sum of money to each of the girls. Then one day, a lady who was working as a maid at Beena's father's home told Christopher that her daughter had been missing for a few days. Christopher decided to investigate and found out that Sebastian had brutally raped and murdered the girl under the influence of drugs and destroyed her body using a crusher and had also hidden the remaining body parts and hair in some statues in his father's ceramic factory. Sebastian was arrested by Christopher but Chackochan told Christopher that he will surely bail out Sebastian. The next day, at the court, Sebastian tried to escape from the clutches of the police by behaving very violently and snatched a rifle from a policeman to try and kill the victim's mother by hitting her on the head, but she was saved by Christopher who shot Sebastian to death. After this incident, Christopher and Beena were separated and later parted ways. With that, he had lost everything, but the only person who he had with him was his adopted daughter Amina.

Despite showing loyalty to the Wang Jingwei regime, Director He secretly works for the Chinese Communist Party alongside his wife Ms. Chen (Zhou Xun). Together, they provide information to the underground network as a means of destroying Japanese occupation via espionage. Ms. Chen works alongside the party's secretary Mr. Zheng (Huang Lei) and the former corresponds with her husband via pastries from a local bakery. As a supposedly loyal worker, Director He diligently performs his tasks of assassinating, interrogating, and torturing as a means of gaining Officer Watanabe's trust. \nAmong Officer Watanabe's inner circle is Minister Tang (Da Peng), Captain Wang (Eric Wang), and a young officer named Mr. Ye (Wang Yibo). Officer Watanabe is ambitious, believing he should do what he can to gain political power through the puppet government, yet suspicious of his men's intentions. After secretly saving communist spy Ms. Jiang (Shuying) after she failed to assassinate Minister Tang, Director He is given information regarding important Japanese individuals such as a Japanese Prince currently serving within the military.\nPeace negotiations were initially planned between Japan and the Wang Jingwei regime, which would redeploy Chinese forces to fight against the Soviet Union and allow the Wang Jingwei regime to continue fighting the Chinese Communist Party at the cost of (de facto) ceding Manchuria. With the newfound information, the Chinese Communist Party ambush and assassinate the Japanese Prince and his brigade during their last excursion. The event causes Japan to break off negotiations and the death of the prince compromises Officer Watanabe's reputation.   \nMr. Ye's lover Ms. Fang (Zhang Jingyi), a dancer and member of the Chinese Communist Party lover, helps assassinate Minister Tang and breaks off her relationship with Mr. Ye, who angrily takes it out on random Japanese soldiers.

Officer Watanabe becomes more suspicious of Director He after discovering he was cousins with Minister Tang and decides to use Mr. Ye as his double agent. The attack on Pearl Harbor is announced and the Wang Jingwei regime declares war on Great Britain and the United States, causing Shanghai to be completely occupied by the Japanese military. Mr. Ye becomes closer to Watanabe, who now wants to further his political ambitions with the former's help. \nMr. Zheng fears the worst for himself and attempts to run away with Ms. Chen before discovering she was married the whole time. Only working for the Chinese Communist Party for money and possible peace, he decides to turn himself into Shanghai's Political Security Department. Mr. Zheng unknowingly reports the Chinese Communist Party's activities to Director He, who kills him, and visits his wife to check on her.

Mr. Ye returns to Officer Watanabe heavily injured but reports that Director He was arrested and Ms. Chen was killed. Officer Watanabe rewards Mr. Ye by making him his new secretary and showing the latter a map of territories and intel that would help strengthen Japan's occupation of China via Manchuria. The two head to Manchuria to start their new political and military careers.  \nDirector He is disguised as a political prisoner but is released soon after the Japanese surrender in 1945. As he leaves the prison, he sees a prison truck enter that includes Officer Watanabe and Mr. Ye among the incoming prisoners. Mr. Ye silently mock Director He as the truck drives through the gates and Officer Watanabe laughs when Director He tries to retaliate. In the prison's washroom, Officer Watanabe tells Mr. Ye that he is no longer motivated to pursue any political power now that Manchuria is no longer under Japanese occupation, and wonders how Manchuria fell despite it being the best stronghold for Japan. He also contemplates on starting a new life from scratch as a farmer, attempting to take off his uniform in defeat, and says both would be granted immunity despite the crimes they committed. Mr. Ye, however, stops him and implies that Officer Watanabe should die as a Japanese officer.  \nIt is revealed that Mr. Ye was double-crossing Officer Watanabe the whole time. At Director He's orders, Mr. Ye intentionally gained Officer Watanabe's trust and was working as a double agent for the Chinese Communist Party. Mr. Ye explains that Manchuria fell because of the information Officer Watanabe gave him in exchange for supposedly killing Ms. Chen and arresting Director He.
