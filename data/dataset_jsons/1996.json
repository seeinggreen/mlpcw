The Musical", "genres": ["Comedy", "Western", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "The film begins with a reenactment of the gruesome act of cannibalism described by the prosecuting attorney during Alferd Packer's 1883 trial. During this sensationalized account, a haggard Packer repeatedly insists that was not how it happened. During a break in the trial, Packer is enticed by journalist Polly Pry to tell his side of the story, which he proceeds to do, via flashback. He opens his tale with better times, galloping freely over green fields on his trusty horse Liane.\nIn 1873, Packer was part of a group of miners in Bingham Canyon, Utah who hear of new prospects in Breckenridge. Together, the small group decide to travel together into Colorado Territory to stake a claim. Packer is appointed as the replacement for the original guide, since he claimed knowledge of the area. He and Liane set off on what Packer estimates will be a three-week journey with a party of five miners: Shannon Wilson Bell, an aspiring Mormon priest; James Humphrey, who was forced by his father to join the party; Frank Miller, a cynical butcher who reluctantly joins their party at the mine; George Noon, a teenager hoping to meet women in Breckenridge; and Israel Swan, an optimist.\nFour weeks later, while attempting to visit Provo for supplies they become convinced they are lost. An attempt to ask a local for directions to Provo proves unsuccessful, with the local warning them of impending doom awaiting them in the mountains. Finally arriving at a frontier post in Provo, they run into a group of three fur trappers bound for Saguache; O.D. Loutzenheiser, Preston Nutter, and their diminutive leader, Jean \"Frenchy\" Cabazon. The trappers despise the miners, whom they contemptuously call \"diggers\", yet seem to like Packer's Arabian horse, telling Packer that she's a \"trapper horse\". Making camp, Packer and company reveal their goals for traveling to each other in song. The next day, Packer wakes up to discover his horse and friend, Liane, is missing. After Bell wounds his leg in a bear trap, the men attempt to cross the Green River near the Utah border. They camp out for the night after their crossing, with Packer singing a heartfelt song about Liane. Eventually, after a disastrous crossing of the Colorado River the Packer party is spotted by two \"Nihonjin\" Indians. They are taken back to the tribe's encampment near Delta where the chief warns them of a winter storm, allowing them to wait it out with the tribe. Packer's party also find the trappers camping out with the tribe, who proceed to brag about their lives in song, but then argue over the key of said song before a small altercation breaks out over Liane, whose feedbag Packer finds in their possession.\nIn the present time, Packer is sentenced to death by hanging, with his execution to occur in Lake City. That night, alone, Polly muses over the case and Packer's testimony, and she reveals her growing affection for him through song. The next day, Polly visits Packer once again in prison, where he continues his story.\nThe men set out in the wilderness and begin to suspect that Packer is really only interested in following the trappers to find his horse, and Bell's temper begins to shorten as his wound from the bear trap becomes infected and develops gangrene. They encounter a foreboding \"Cyclops\", a tall mountain man with a wounded, pus-spurting eye, while unwittingly trying to steal one of his sheep for sustenance. Later, the badly frostbitten Swan tries to cheer everybody up with a song about building a snowman, only for Miller to destroy Swan's snowman with a pickaxe. They soon run out of food, resorting to eating their shoes as they become lost in the snow-covered Rocky Mountains. Out of frustration, Bell shoots Swan in the head while in the middle of a song, because he does not appreciate his (Swan's) Pollyanna-esque perspective on their predicament. The men discuss their dire situation that night over the fire, speaking of the cannibalism that the Donner Party had to resort to in California. They decide to consume the body of their dead companion as Miller cuts up Swan's body, and only Bell refuses to partake in the cannibalism. Packer then has a ballet-inspired nightmare involving himself, Liane, and Cabazon. After a few more days, the party loses hope, which leads to talk of sacrificing one of their own. Packer convinces them for one more chance for a scouting trip, but when he returns, Bell has killed the others, claiming they planned to kill and eat him after Packer left. Packer is forced to throw a cleaver at Bell, seemingly killing him, after threatening to turn him in, realizing he has gone insane. He is then forced to cannibalize the others to wait out the rest of the winter.\nArriving in Saguache sometime later, Packer finds Liane, who has taken to Cabazon, upsetting Packer. The sheriff of Saguache, suspicious of Packer arriving without the rest of his party, eventually finds out the fate of the other members and attempts to arrest Packer for cannibalism at a saloon. A bar-fight between Packer and the trappers occurs, which Packer wins after brutally attacking Cabazon's groin using fighting techniques he learned from the Nihonjin chief, leaving Cabazon incapacitated with a high-pitched voice. Following this, Packer attempts to flee to Wyoming, only to later be arrested there and brought back to Colorado to await judgment. On the day of Packer's execution in Lake City, the town breaks into song, celebrating Packer's impending death. However, he is saved at the last minute by Polly, who arrives on the scene with Liane. Polly reveals that Packer had gotten a stay of execution from the governor stating that he could not be convicted of a state crime since Colorado was not a state at the time of the incident. Meanwhile, Cabazon, whose voice is still high pitched and wants revenge against Packer for their fight in Saguache, states the townsfolk came to see bloodshed and tries to trigger the gallows. The Nihonjin chief saves Packer by cutting his rope with a katana before beheading Cabazon, satisfying the crowd's blood-lust. Packer, seeing that Polly brought back Liane, realizes he does not need her anymore and chooses Polly (much to the excitement of the chief, who takes off after Liane with his katana), and the two kiss, only to be frightened by a still-alive but badly maimed Bell.", "tmdb_plot": "Heading through Colorado Territory in search of gold and women, Alferd Packer and his group of bemused companions find themselves lost, starving and musically inspired by the obstacles they confront along the way, including a die-hard Confederate cyclops, a trio of surly trappers, a tribe of Japanese-speaking \"Indians,\" and ultimately, each other.", "tmdb_id": "13063", "wiki_id": "527414"}, {"title": "The Last Supper", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Chris (Ken McDougall) is a dancer dying of AIDS.

Maybe the lighthouse keeper is crazy, but this does not prevent him from introducing prince Jan to the dreamland Taxandria, a phantasmagorical place devoid of time, memory, and progress. Jan learns that a reason for the lighthouse keeper's notoriety among the locals is that from time to time he hides political refugees from Taxandria from the authorities; in one scene, we see some of these fugitives arrive at the coast in a boat and taken in by the lighthouse keeper. It is however never made clear whether Taxandria really exists or if the viewer only sees what the lighthouse keeper relates to prince Jan, although once Jan is transported to Taxandria simply by looking into the lighthouse's rotating light while the keeper is away.\nAs a failed scientific experiment in the past accidentally removed Taxandria from its home planet (a disaster now recalled by the citizens of Taxandria as the Great Cataclysm), all science, progress, and measure of time are outlawed as a consequence, whereas the Perennial Present reigns supreme. The land is ruled by two conjoined princes, always hidden behind a curtain, and their police force who insure that everyone there lives in the Perennial Present, as it is illegal to discuss the past or future.

At her school, \u00c1ngela asks her thesis director, Professor Figueroa, to help her find the most violent films in the school's library, and seeks out a fellow student, Chema, who is known for collecting violent and pornographic videos. While \u00c1ngela watches a violent film with Chema, Figueroa finds a tape hidden in the school's audiovisual archives. The next day, \u00c1ngela finds Figueroa dead of an apparent asthma attack in the screening room and retrieves the tape. A younger professor, Castro, takes over the supervision of \u00c1ngela's thesis project. At Chema's house, \u00c1ngela discovers the stolen tape is a snuff film in which a woman is tortured, killed, and disemboweled. Chema recognizes the victim is a student from their university named Vanessa, who went missing two years previously. He is able to determine that the killer used a specific model of Sony camera with a digital zoom feature, and that the film was shot in someone's garage.\nAt the library, \u00c1ngela sees a handsome young man named Bosco using the type of camera Chema identified. When she leaves, he pursues and catches up to her. Bosco notices that \u00c1ngela has newspaper clippings about Vanessa's disappearance and states that he has information about the case. \u00c1ngela pretends she is filming a report about the disappearance and asks to interview Bosco about it. In the interview, Bosco insists that Vanessa must have run away with a boyfriend because she sent a note to her family saying that she was in love. \u00c1ngela is willing to accept Bosco's innocence, but Chema tells her that he is a psychopath. Once home, \u00c1ngela realizes that Bosco is inside the house waiting for her. Although she is initially frightened, Bosco charms her family and they invite him to stay for dinner.

As \u00c1ngela is about to admit why she took the tape, Chema calls and tells her to leave Castro's office immediately, saying that he is involved in the snuff film. Castro fails to catch \u00c1ngela as she flees his office. Bosco's girlfriend, Yolanda, confronts \u00c1ngela and explains that she, Vanessa, Bosco, and Chema, who was once a friend of Bosco, had gone to a series of director's workshops with Castro two years previously. Yolanda states that she left when they made Vanessa take off her clothes for a short film, that Chema was obsessed with snuff films, and that she believes he killed Vanessa after the workshop ended. Later, Chema admits to \u00c1ngela that he knew Bosco, but claims he also left the workshop when things got out of hand. At night, Chema shows \u00c1ngela a hidden tunnel he has discovered in the school's video library. In a room off the tunnel, they find shelves of video tapes like the one of Vanessa, indicating that many other women may have been murdered in other snuff films.

Her owner, Anita Campbell-Green falls in love with Roger when they meet. They both fall into the lake as a result of their dogs chasing each other, but they return to Roger's home and Anita accepts his proposal. They get married along with Perdita and Pongo. Anita works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil. Her boss, the diabolical, yet glamorous Cruella de Vil, has a deep passion for fur, going so far as to have a taxidermist, Mr. Skinner, skin a female white tiger named Sue-Ling at the London Zoo to make her into a rug for her. Anita, inspired by her Dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual Dalmatians, and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita's dog.\nAnita soon discovers that Perdita is pregnant and is then informed that she, herself, is too, much to her shock. Sometime later, Cruella visits their home and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger. Her initial disgust at them having a baby turns to excitement when she finds out Perdita is expecting too. Several weeks later, she returns when a litter of 15 puppies are born and offers Roger and Anita \u00a37,500 for them, but they refuse.

After several mishaps, Jasper and Horace discover nearby police looking for Cruella and hand themselves in.\nCruella tracks the puppies to the farm where they are hiding and tries to kill them. The farm animals carry out a plan to take down Cruella while the puppies escape. They steal her hat, drop a pig on her, cause her to fall into a vat of molasses and finally get flung into a pigpen, defeating her. The police arrive just in time to arrest a now filthy Cruella who is taken into custody along with Jasper, Horace and Skinner. As she berates them for their failures as well as the downfall of her business and reputation, they are all sprayed by the skunk that snuck into her car before she went to the farm.\nAll of the fleeing dalmatians are found and sent home via the Suffolk Constabulary.

Malcolm serves as the narrator, the army life is seen through his eyes and thoughts. All six men are placed in Hotel Company Platoon 4, alongside various other males.\nPrior to enlisting, Malcolm is seen interacting with a shady Mr. X at the manpower base who sells him a guidebook teaching ways of playing truant in the army while Krishna makes a heart to heart final talk with Lathi, his girlfriend. When Platoon 4 is brought to their bunks after bidding farewell to their loved ones, the six men share their thoughts on the current state of affairs, before being introduced to their drill instructor, Corporal (CPL) Ong, who is a tough-as-nails stereotyped army man. He dramatically tells them all about their upcoming life, then leads them all to their mandatory haircut. At night, the six men introduce themselves to one another, with Malcolm finding himself out of the league almost immediately.\nTraining goes on with morning physical training, and soon comes the standard obstacle course. The six are shown trying hard but failing, albeit comically, to get through the various itineraries.

Johari feels his parents aren't coming due to potential weddings to attend, and Kenny dismisses his parents as absent due to holiday. Nevertheless, all six gather for a picture at the moment with Ah Huay photographing.\nDuring combat training, the platoon is introduced to an unsurprising instructor; Sergeant (SGT) Wendy Chung. She is tougher than expected, but Ah Beng unwittingly falls for her. Field camp is next. While the six are assigned to bunk with each other under tents, Kenny and Malcolm try to turn their campsite homely which enrages their platoon sergeant, SGT Monteiro. He punishes both to guard duty, and it turns out Krishna is down for it as well since he attempted to feign a reason for absence but is caught (he is revealed to have bought the same book as Malcolm did and tried its contents). Unfortunately, at nightfall during duty, Krishna faints from shock after getting into a scuffle with a python, and Malcolm discovers him. In lieu of this, Second Lieutenant (2LT) Collin Heng decides to pay a visit to Krishna's immediate family alongside CPL Ong and Malcolm, whom he feels they need to meet. With Krishna's parents overseas, Lathi breaks down upon hearing the news but is comforted by 2LT Heng, who inadvertently informally introduces himself, making Lathi enticed by him. Malcolm however notices this.\nAfter discharged from the medical center, Krishna returns to his bunk to find it empty, only to realise the entire platoon is given off for outstanding performance. The six surprise greet him, but it goes sour after Kenny tried disclosing that Lathi was flirting with 2LT Heng and he claims it was all seen by Malcolm who vehemently denies saying it is so. Krishna is shocked, demanding for the truth from Malcolm who neither affirms it. Kenny continues to go on a tirade before getting snapped back by Johari who had enough of his antics. Kenny angrily storms off, revealing he was left behind by his parents to serve his NS while they left for Australia without him. Johari and Malcolm go out to pacify him, with Krishna crestfallen before Ah Beng who too tries to do the same. Krishna nearly thinks of breaking up with Lathi but is chided by Ah Beng for being shallow given the circumstances, and Kenny pours out to Malcolm and Johari the undesirable truth his parents said to him about serving his time in the army, to which in fact they are right he needed to be who he is and man up.\nIn a phonecall, Krishna and Lathi manage to reconcile, while Malcolm finally manages to refuse requests from his overprotective mother.

Glen first molests Bone while waiting in the car for the birth of his child. Frustrated by the loss of his eagerly-anticipated son, Anney's inability to have more children, and his own inability to manage his temper as well as maintain steady employment, Glen begins to physically and sexually abuse Bone regularly; beating her in the bathroom.

Bess is steadfast and pure of heart, but quite simple and childlike in her beliefs. During her frequent visits to the church, she prays to God and carries on conversations with Him in her own voice, believing that He is responding directly through her.\nBess is infatuated with Jan and has difficulty living without him when he is away on the oil platform. Jan makes occasional phone calls to Bess in which they express their love and sexual desires. Bess grows needy and prays for his immediate return. The next day, Jan is severely injured in an industrial accident and is flown back to the mainland. Bess believes her prayer was the reason the accident occurred, that God was punishing her for her selfishness in asking for him to neglect his job and come back to her. No longer able to perform sexually and mentally affected by the paralysis, Jan asks Bess to find a lover. Bess is devastated and storms out. Jan then attempts to commit suicide and fails. He falls unconscious and is readmitted to hospital.\nJan's condition deteriorates. He urges Bess to find another lover and tell him the details, as it will be as if they are together and will revitalise his spirits. Though her sister-in-law Dodo constantly reassures her that nothing she does will affect his recovery, Bess begins to believe these suggestions are the will of God and in accordance with loving Jan wholly. Despite her repulsion and inner turmoil at the thought of being with other men, she perseveres in her own sexual debasement as she believes it will save her husband.

You cannot be in love with a word.

George takes her to the hospital where he learns that Carla also attempted suicide six weeks ago.  George stays by Carla's side in the hospital while she is recovering.\nCarla later explains that she read letters from her boyfriend, Antonio (Richard Loza), which she had never been able to open before. She was so horrified by the content of the letters that she tried to take her own life. Carla tells him that she doesn't know what happened to her boyfriend Antonio or to her family and asks George to hold her. She appears to be haunted by her past and suffering the effects of posttraumatic stress disorder.\nGeorge decides they need to return to a war-torn Nicaragua to find out what happened to Antonio and Carla's family.

Adam is Cayhall's grandson, his family having since moved away from the South and changed their name, haunted and shamed by Cayhall's actions. Adam is motivated to take the case in a search for some understanding of the dark secrets of his family, which prompted the suicide of Adam's father the year Sam was sentenced to death and whose body Adam found as a child.\nAdam is sent by the firm to Jackson, Mississippi to take over the case and there reconnects with his aunt Lee Bowen, an alcoholic socialite who has managed to avoid public association with her infamous father, and who warns Adam about the dangers of dredging up the past. On death row, Sam remains a brusque, bitter, unrepentant racist who brags about his participation in the Klan bombing campaign of which the Kramer bombing was a part, though he denies that any of the bombings were intended to kill. He taunts Adam for his youth, legal inexperience, anti-racism, and the suicide of his father, but he agrees to allow Adam to represent him, though he forbids Adam from seeking clemency from Mississippi Governor McAllister, who had prosecuted Sam in his last retrial and had campaigned on that prosecution in his election to Governor. Nevertheless, as he begins to argue the case, Adam is approached by the Governor through an aide, Nora Stark, who suggests that he might consider clemency if Sam provides information about unidentified co-conspirators to the bombing.\nAs Adam investigates, inconsistencies in the facts of the original case come to light, casting doubt on Sam's intent to kill and suggesting that he lacked the ability to make the bomb himself, and both Stark and the original FBI agent who investigated the case indicate that the bombing may have been the result of a broader conspiracy involving the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission and White Citizens' Councils, which were active at the time of the bombing in opposition to civil rights.\nSam refuses to authorize Adam to seek access to the Sovereignty Commission's files, sealed by order of the state legislature, fearing it would expose Sam's former associates in the Klan, as well allowing the Governor to obtain useful information on political enemies, which he indicates is the Governor's real reason for seeking Sam's cooperation in unsealing the files.\nAdam continues to work through the courts, filing and arguing motions for a stay of execution, including on the grounds that Sam was legally insane and unable to tell right from wrong, due to his indoctrination into the Ku Klux Klan. At the same time, Lee, faced with the unearthed ghosts of the family history and having lapsed back into full-blown alcoholism, reveals to Adam that in the early 1950s, as children, she and Adam's father had witnessed their father murder the family's African-American neighbor Joe Lincoln during a fight that had started because Adam's father, Eddie, had wrongly accused Lincoln's son of stealing a toy soldier. Eddie had blamed himself for the murder, as well as Lee, for failing to stop Sam, the guilt of which was a factor in Eddie's later suicide and Lee's alcoholism. Lee also reveals how their father had been indoctrinated into the Klan as a child, showing Adam a historic photograph of Sam as a young boy attending a Klan lynching which Adam uses in his arguments before the courts.\nAdam and Nora secretly gain access to the Sovereignty Commission's sealed files, which prove a wider conspiracy to the bombing, and also indicate the participation of an accomplice.  The former FBI agent resurfaces, and reveals to Adam that the FBI had identified the accomplice, Rollie Wedge, whom the FBI had never been able to prove responsible, but who has reunited with other Klan members to commemorate the bombing on the eve of the pending execution.\nAdam goes to a Klan reunion but is beaten by several members and threatened at gunpoint by Wedge. Adam's persistence, the revelation of how much Sam's hatred had destroyed his family, and his impending execution begin to affect Sam, and he softens, reconciling with Lee and expressing remorse for his actions and the effect they have had on his family. Sam forcefully rejects the Klan when Wedge visits him in prison to encourage him to remain silent, and it is revealed that Wedge was the one who had built the bomb and set it deliberately to detonate.\nUltimately, Adam's motions for a stay are denied by the courts, including the United States Supreme Court. Despite Sam's finally authorizing the release of relevant Sovereignty Commission files, the Governor refuses to grant clemency, betraying him and Adam, while nonetheless using the files as political leverage as Sam had predicted.

Isaiah then followed his older brother Jedediah into the camp where the railroad men were and shot the man responsible for their father's death.  When they returned home and told their mother what they did, she instantly scolded them, telling them not to mistake stupidity for courage.  Their mother knew that the railroad men would come for Jedediah, and in a moment of final family bonding, she gave to the boys their father's favorite hat adorned with a distinct Cherokee feather.  It was Isaiah who claimed the hat as he was placed in a woodbox while a plan to allow Jedediah to escape was put in motion in which their mother pretended to shoot him at a distance.  Their mother held off the men as best as she could, until a younger Bloomington came in from the back door and shot her twice, though not before grazing his forehead with a bullet and leaving a scar.  His assistant Bonner was tasked with finding Jedediah (which he never does), and fires in the air claiming he did so.\nIsaiah then ran aimlessly not knowing where to go, until he wandered into the home of Reverend Peel and his wife, who decided to adopt him as they had no children.  Fourteen years later, he grew into a tall, strong, yet clumsy and na\u00efve young man who still clung to his desire for revenge.  One day Isaiah saw a poster advertising Bloomington's arrival at Pinedale, where he would speak to the people as he was now running for governor.  Isaiah decided to go and take revenge for the death of his family.  After saying goodbye to his foster parents, and being told which way Pinedale was (Isaiah's lack of a sense of direction a running joke throughout), he sets out.  Hiding out in a cabin, Isaiah gets into a comical scuffle with a man named Jake Carver in which he ends up using a turkey to accidentally kill him and inadvertently saves a prostitute from being raped.  She then cooks the turkey for him out of gratitude, yet disappears the next day with all the leftovers.  That day he is found by Jake Carver's gang, and after unsuccessfully passing himself off as him he then passes himself off as a childhood friend of his and claims that he had planned for them to rob a bank in Pinedale (thus tricking them into taking him there).  \nArriving at Pinedale, Isaiah walks into a bank.  After making small talk with one of the tellers in which he is told of the gifts given to clients depending on how much is deposited, he then loudly announces that the gang is there to ro the bank.  The tellers instantly draw guns on them, with the teller explaining to Isaiah that the gun is the last gift given for the highest amount deposited.  After coming across Bonner, and comically shooting him in the buttocks, Isaiah runs off into the crowd gathered to hear Bloomington and disrupts the speech after bringing up the night in which he killed his mother and was scarred.  Trying unsuccessfully to shoot him, Isaiah runs off and hides in the wagon of Otter Bob (Burt Reynolds), a lonely man of the mountains.  That night, a friendship began when Isaiah reveals that he knows how to read, and Isaiah at first barters transportation to El Paso for teaching Otter Bob to read, but then also adds that Otter Bob also teach him how to be a mountain man.\nFor 3 months they traveled together, and Isaiah eventually learned all of Otter Bob's tricks and methods.  Bonner and his men were on Isaiah's trail, and eventually caught up to Otter Bob, who ended up sacrificing himself to save Isaiah's life.  Isaiah escaped with a fatally wounded Otter Bob, leaving Bonner caught in a bear trap.  Isaiah then holds Otter Bob as he gives his last words, then buries him before continuing alone.  Along the way, he comes across Cortina who is buried up to his neck in the sand and saves him.  That night, Cortina vows to follow Isaiah (who introduces himself as Bob) until he can repay his debt by saving Isaiah's life.  Reaching El Paso, Isaiah and Cortina stop at a saloon where Cortina sits at a table to play cards and Isaiah goes to the bar for a drink.  Bonner who is already there and sees Isaiah from the upstairs balcony of the saloon, sets a trap for him and pays a prostitute to distract him while he and several men surround and arrest him.  Isaiah is led out as Cortina watches from a distance.\nIn jail, Isaiah is placed in the same cell as Nat Love, a famous gunslinger, and leader of a gang.  Isaiah quickly expresses his awe and admiration, saying he would love to receive whatever tutelage he could from him.  Nat simply tells him to enjoy the day as Nat is scheduled to be hung the next day.  Bloomington arrives to gloat at Isaiah's capture, and Isaiah vows to come back from the grave for revenge if need be.  When Isaiah mentions Jedediah's name, Nat instantly tells Isaiah that he was alive, grew up to be a good man and a gunslinger in his own right, but lost a duel to the Undertaker.  Isaiah then vows to also kill the Undertaker as well.  That night, Cortina arrives and breaks Isaiah out of jail, with Nat also escaping.  When they're about to part ways, Isaiah shoots a man that had shot and missed Cortina, thus saving his life once more.  Nat steals Isaiah's horse, with Isaiah having to ride with Cortina yet constantly falling off his horse as they followed Nat back to his hideout where he's met with open arms by his gang.  Isaiah then manages to convince Nat to allow them to stay for a few days, and shortly after meets the rest of his gang:  Stagecoach Mary, and a group of nuns who also serve as accomplices.  During their time there, Isaiah is constantly mocked and disrespected by Nat's gang as he comically and dangerously tries to practice gunslinging.  Nat Love takes matters into his own hands and forces Isaiah to shoot a can off his hand at gunpoint, telling Isaiah that he would kill him if he hit him.  Isaiah then makes his first successful shot and is told by Nat to plan on dying whenever he shoots as someone.  Isaiah then learns to ride a horse after Nat compares riding a horse to being with a woman, and Stagecoach Mary takes his virginity to give him a basis after some mockery from the men.  Isaiah continues to work on his skills and excels quickly, much to Nat's wonder and admiration.  One night Nat calls for a meeting in which he declares that Isaiah needs a gunslinger name.  After some mockery from some of the gang members, Nat asks Isaiah what it is that he's proud of, as a man must have a name that he can be proud of.  Isaiah instantly names his half-Cherokee father, who died fighting for his convictions.  It is then that he is given the name \"The Cherokee Kid\".\nThe next day after a change in wardrobe, the Cherokee Kid and Cortina follow Nat and his gang as they go to rob a bank, this being Isaiah's final lesson.  During the robbery, Nat tells Isaiah to pay attention to how it's done, and Isaiah learns quickly as he shoots his way out flawlessly during the getaway.  Nat returns to his hideout as Isaiah and Cortina part ways with them, with the promise that they would meet again in the future.  The Cherokee Kid then sets out to rob Bloomington's banks in an effort to become his leading priority, and to humiliate him.  Bloomington desperately calls for as many mercenaries and bounty hunters as he can find, including the Undertaker.  Bloomington offers a bag of gold coins to whoever can kill the Cherokee Kid, and the Undertaker quickly announces that the Cherokee Kid is his, disabling one of the men who challenges him.\nArriving in Larabee, Isaiah and Cortina are graciously welcomed by the Holsopple family as they arrive at their farm looking to buy fresh horses.  They are asked to stay for dinner, much to the chagrin and disgrace of Abby, the farmer's daughter.  During dinner, Abby knocks out Isaiah and Cortina with a frying pan, with the intention of turning them in and collecting the reward money to use to keep their land.  Abby remains untrusting of the Cherokee Kid, naively believing that they're there to rob them.  After escaping their restraints, Isaiah and Cortina tell Abby they'll come back, and after Isaiah remarks that Abby may like him, she gets her rifle and shoots at them in anger, missing all four shots and claiming that it's too dark to see.\nThe next day, a gunslinger unsuccessfully attempts to kill the Cherokee Kid after telling him that the Undertaker is looking for him.  The Cherokee Kid then tells the gunslinger to tell the Undertaker that he wants to meet him the next day on the main street.  Later that day Isaiah goes to see Abby once more, and after some banter, her attraction to him becomes slightly apparent.  It is here that Cortina ends his eulogy as Bonner enters with some men demanding that the Cherokee Kid be put underground per Bloomington's orders.  Everyone at the funeral keeps them at bay, claiming they will carry the casket themselves, to which Bonner relents.\nOutside, the Undertaker gives his recount of the duel.  It is through this recount that it is revealed that the Undertaker is in fact, Jedediah Turner, Isaiah's brother.  The Undertaker recognizing The Cherokee Kid as Isaiah due to their father's Cherokee feather on his hat, and The Cherokee Kid recognizing The Undertaker as Jedediah due to his quoting of their mother.  The duel takes place, and Isaiah falls.  The Undertaker then opens the casket to reveal a still alive Isaiah who then opens fire on Bloomington, and thus keeping his promise to \"come back from the grave\".  A major gunfight erupts with the Cherokee Kid, Cortina, Undertaker, Abby, Nat Love and his gang against Bloomington's men as Bloomington looks for a way to escape.  In the gunfight Nat is killed, and Cortina is wounded.  Isaiah and Jedediah re-affirm their brotherhood, claiming that to be the best day of their lives regardless of the outcome before taking out what's left of Bloomington's men together.  In the aftermath, Isaiah then looks for Bloomington, cornering him in a barn.  Bloomington goes as far as to offer him a partnership in an effort to save himself.  Isaiah, disgusted, turns his back to him.  Bloomington then tries to shoot him but is quickly shot by Isaiah who then stands over a wounded Bloomington and executes him in the same way his mother was killed.  Isaiah turns around to see Bonner aiming at him, but is shot from behind by Jedediah.\nNat Love is buried and his gang (now fully respecting Isaiah) part ways.  Isaiah and Jedediah engage in some banter as they plan to go west to get to know each other better and right more wrongs, to Abby's disapproval.  Abby claims that since he has already reached all his goals being the Cherokee Kid is no longer necessary, but Isaiah claims he likes being a gunslinger.  Cortina attempts to go his own way, but Isaiah reminds him that he has once again saved his life and Cortina somewhat reluctantly agrees to stay.  As they turn to leave, they're shot at by Abby, who insists on going with them, and they ride off.", "tmdb_plot": "Isaih Turner didn\u2019t want to be a hero-all he wanted was revenge.

Suddenly it all stops and the fevers drop.\nLocal parents Donald (Brent Jennings) and Sandra Atkins notice that their son Marcus is acting strangely.

It is divided into two major sections, all loosely tied together as the story of Suleiman's return to the West Bank and Israel. The character of Suleiman in the film is described only as 'E.S.' E.S. returns from a twelve-year exile in New York City and is now in unfamiliar territory. Within the film, no real plot or character development emerges. A series of mostly unconnected scenes take place one after the other in documentary film like fashion. The gradual accumulation of images and dialogue start without conclusion presenting an unsettling kind of feeling, which was meant to convey the quality of life led by Palestinians given their statelessness.The first, and lightest, section is the \"Nazareth Personal Diary\", featuring warm observations of his family and his relatives' lives. Some of the notable vignettes include the dull yet comedic routines of the proprietor of a souvenir shop called \"the Holyland\" in which he fills bottles of alleged holy water from his own tap and fails to keep a cheap camel statuette from falling over on his shelves. E.S. and the shop owner spend time sitting in front of the stop waiting futilely for tourists to stop by. A boat full of Arab men fish, as one of the men bashes various Palestinian families that his friend does not belong to while praising the one that his friend does belong to. Suleiman also interviews a Russian Orthodox cleric who rails against the tourists polluting the Sea of Galilee.A short middle segment shows E.S. getting up to speak at a conference on Palestinian film making; the microphone immediately begins feeding back and he leaves the podium. The last section, \"Jerusalem Political Diary, has a quicker narrative pace and a more overtly ideological message. Absurd humor is evoked alongside feelings of paranoia in the characters felt by the broader society; for example, what first appears to be a terrorist's hand grenade held by a Palestinian turns out to be a cigarette lighter.Suleiman discovers an Israeli policeman's walkie-talkie, and he then meets up with a single young Arab woman who is engaging in a search for an apartment that is just as fruitless as the two men's search for tourists. The woman, who speaks fluent Hebrew, is told by Jewish landlords that they do not rent to Arabs, while an Arab landlord tells her to live at home in accordance to Islamic tradition. She uses the walkie-talkie to play various pranks on the Israeli police, at one point singing an overly malevolent version of Israel's national anthem over the air. In the last part of the film, the woman stages a piece in which the police unwittingly participate as a member of a guerrilla theatre group.

At her arraignment, she learns to her horror that she is facing felony charges for endangering a fetus; her many earlier arrests had all been on misdemeanors.

Giles Corey, who suspects that the children are just acting out, and John Proctor, with whom Abigail had an affair, visit the Parris household. Believing Betty and Ruth to be demonically possessed, Parris and the Putnams call Reverend John Hale from nearby Beverly to examine Betty. To save herself and the other girls from punishment, Abigail accuses Tituba of witchcraft. After being whipped, Tituba confesses to seeing the devil and is saved from being hanged. Struck by their new power, the girls begin naming numerous other women, including Elizabeth, whom they \"saw\" with the devil.\nJohn wants to forget about his affair with Abigail and get back with Elizabeth. He decides to stop Abigail's accusations, telling his servant, Mary Warren, who is one of the \"afflicted\" girls, to testify at the trial that the witchcraft was faked. In court, Francis Nurse gives a list of people vouching for the accused; the judges order that all on the list be arrested and brought in for questioning. Giles insists that when Ruth accused Rebecca Nurse, Mr. Putnam was heard to tell Ruth that she had won him a \"fine gift of land\". Giles refuses to identify who heard this remark, and the judges order his arrest. Mary Warren insists she only thought she saw spirits but the other girls later cow her into recanting.

John repeats his accusation that the girls are merely pretending, but they run outside from the \"bird\" into a nearby lake. To save herself from being hanged, Mary Warren accuses John of witchcraft. When asked if he will return to God, John despairingly yells \"I say God is dead!\" and is arrested as a witch.\nOn the day before John is to be hanged, Reverend Hale confronts Abigail at the now-abandoned homes of the victims whom she testified against. Because Hale was the lone official in the court to doubt her claims, Abigail attempts to convince the court that Hale's wife is also a witch; however, this backfires as the judges doubt her, as they consider a minister's wife to be pure.

Bombay informs Charlie prior to the start of classes that the team will be in good hands under the coaching of former NHL player Ted Orion.\nThe Ducks' start at the school begins inauspiciously; while the newer Ducks respectfully sit in at the headmaster's speech, the original teammates crash the ceremony on stage. The team then experiences many early struggles: playing in Coach Orion's new \"two-way hockey\" defensive style, Orion abandoning several Duck traditions and some of their youthful in-game 'trick' plays, losing Adam Banks who qualifies for Varsity, and off-ice conflicts with the Varsity team. The Ducks' struggles continue, culminating in a tie in their first game after having a huge lead.

Fulton follows, but considers quitting hockey much to Charlie's dismay. Sometime later, he ultimately returns to the team without Charlie.\nAngry at Bombay's departure and at Orion's highly disciplined coaching style, Charlie's acting out alienates him from his mother, Hans (Gordon's old mentor and friend of the Ducks), and even his friends. Hans suddenly dies, and Bombay comes to Charlie's house the day after the funeral and takes him back to Eden Hall. He tells Charlie that Orion's career with the Minnesota North Stars ended when the team moved to Dallas and he stayed to care for his paraplegic daughter.

Bombay also admits telling Orion that Charlie was the real \"Minnesota Miracle\" man. Emotionally touched by his words, finding new resolve, and feeling guilt-ridden over how he acted against Orion, Charlie agrees to rejoin the team. By most fans, Conway is considered the heart and soul of the team, but Adam Banks is the better all around player.\nArriving at the team bus for the next game, Charlie tells Orion he wants to play \"two-way hockey\". Surprised but pleased, Coach Orion welcomes him back.

At a board meeting the following day, Bombay, who was an experienced lawyer before coaching the Ducks, acts as the Ducks' attorney and fights successfully for their case, threatening the board with an injunction and promising to win the resulting lawsuit if the board expels the Ducks, and the board reinstates the Duck's scholarships with much reluctance due to Bombay putting them in a no-win situation.

The gang force their way through the north tube traffic where the driver loses control and smashes through a security booth and into one of the trucks, causing it to detonate, and resulting in a sympathetic detonation of the remaining trucks. The tunnel entrances cave in, and a devastating fireball sweeps through the tunnel, incinerating the majority of the motorists within it.\nAbout to enter the Manhattan end of the tunnel, former New York City Emergency Medical Services Chief Kit Latura, now working as a taxi driver, witnesses the fireball erupting from the entrance. While racing to help whoever he can, he runs into an old EMS colleague who tells him that the tunnel is severely damaged and could collapse if any wrong moves are made.

Baron and his eight men, including an insider scientist named Dr. Berg, are seeking a sample of a deadly virus that is being developed inside the facility, and plan to use both the virus and a set of five pre-arranged bombs in Washington, D.C. as leverage to arrange an escape and a payment of $510 million.\nOnce the takeover of the facility begins, Hatfield quickly discovers the plot and eliminates three terrorists, while the remaining five take the only four surviving scientists - Pawklowsky (Andre Kashkar), Elaine Starkov (Bridget Marks), Eliot Stein (Larry Smith), and Abrahams (Ami Dayan) - as hostages.

They flee from the ship, but are apprehended by dock workers and the New York police. The MC Ruby's Ukrainian crew watches the detention with some amusement, but the ship's captain and his first mate, Ion Plesin, are displeased, aware that the illegal immigrants will cost the shipping company hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.  In response, company representative Andreas Vlachos arrives to oversee future operations and warn that the crew will be liable for any more such fines.\nLater, the MC Ruby is docked in Ghana, where dock worker Kingsley Ofosu plans to some day stow away aboard a cargo ship to pursue a better life for himself and his pregnant wife in the United States. Upon winning a lottery, he decides that the time is right, as he can use the money to get on his feet upon his arrival. Ofosu, his brother and six other men slip aboard the MC Ruby and hide in its cargo holds. With the ship behind schedule, Plesin has only one hour to conduct a stowaway search prior to departure.  The hasty endeavour fails to turn up Ofosu's group and the ship sails, bound for France, prior to sailing on to New York.\nOfosu's group encounters another stowaway, who had boarded the ship in Cameroon. The men jovially discuss the vocations they intend to pursue in the United States. Later, their water container breaks, forcing them to leave the cargo area to forage for water. They leave evidence of their presence, which the crew discovers. To prevent Vlachos from learning that the stowaway search had failed, the captain has Plesin assemble a small team to conduct a secret search.\nThe search finds the stowaways and Plesin discusses the predicament with the captain. Given the illegal immigrant fines, they cannot bring the stowaways into port. However, they also cannot alter course to drop the men off somewhere, as Vlachos would then find out about them. Plesin and his small search team hide the Africans in the ship's anchor hold without food or water.  When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty.  He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana.  Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths.\nThe captain acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. Plesin's team takes the men from the hold in small groups. The team brings each group to another area, murders the men, and throws their bodies overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two to be brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions.  As they do, Plesin's team shoots Ofosu's brother, catches him and throws him overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees to the main cargo hold to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks.\nPlesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate the final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise black immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him.\nThe next day, French authorities board the MC Ruby to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the authorities search the ship's hold and find Ofosu's picture in the cocoa sack. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favour by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally.

If denied again, he will be dismissed from the Navy's submarine command program.\nRear Admiral Yancy Graham, who dislikes Dodge, opposes his promotion, but Vice Admiral Dean Winslow, Commander, Submarine Force Atlantic, who likes Dodge and his methods, selects him to participate in a war game to test the Navy's defenses against attack from diesel-powered submarines. As Russia has been selling off their diesel fleet to America's adversaries, Winslow orders him to restore the rusty World War II-era Balao-class diesel-powered submarine USS Stingray, assigned to him by Graham, and use it to \"invade\" Charleston Harbor undetected, and if successful, to sink a dummy warship in Norfolk Harbor with two live torpedoes.

Bijuriya, who dearly loves Nandu and does not want to part with him, objects to this. Bijuriya realizes that if Vikram goes to court, she will lose Nandu forever, and so she pretends to be Queen Rani Devi, who was Nandu's guardian. Vikram falls for her charade and slowly falls in love with her. But one day, her truth is exposed to him. Vikram decides to take his nephew back with him immediately. The nephew, who detests his newfound uncle and adores his aunt like a mother figure, protests this, but Vikram remains adamant.\nBijuriya forces Nandu to go with Vikram after getting to know that Nandu misses school and does petty jobs to earn money to marry off Bijuriya.

His only possession is a copy of Herodotus' Histories, with personal notes, pictures, and mementos stored inside. When a nurse friend is killed in front of her, Hana decides she is a curse to those who love her. She gains permission to settle in a bombed-out monastery with her patient, as he suffers extra during relocations of her hospital unit.\nThey are soon joined by Lt.

He gives them a new Cutlass Ciera and promises them half of the $80,000 ransom he says he intends to extract from Wade. Jerry pitches Wade a lucrative real estate deal and believes Wade has agreed to lend him $750,000 to finance it, so he attempts to call off the kidnapping. Wade and his accountant Stan Grossman inform Jerry that Wade will make the deal himself and pay Jerry only a modest finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean and transport her to a remote cabin in Moose Lake. A state trooper stops them near Brainerd for not displaying temporary registration tags. The trooper rejects Carl's clumsy bribe attempt and hears Jean whimpering in the back seat. Gaear shoots him, then chases down and kills two passers-by who witnessed the scene.\nThe following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson, who is seven months pregnant, begins investigating. She correctly deduces that the dead trooper was ticketing a car with dealer plates.

Within that journey, he finds out what Jo Beth has been doing to him.\nJo Beth has proceeded to pretend that her purse was stolen in order to have the old credit cards, ATM cards, and their checking account turned off, and have new numbers issued.  She also sells all of the stocks they held, and even sold their classic Ford Thunderbird.  She even went so far as to draw up a contract turning over her entire business to her friend who works with her in order for Nick not to be able to get his hands on any of it in the divorce.\nAfter Nick's son, Eric, gets a letter showing he was accepted to Dorsett, the prestigious prep school his father went to, he runs to the airport to meet his dad to tell him the good news.  What he sees is him romantically kissing Miriam.  So he runs away to tell Jo Beth about it, and she goes to Allison's new house to confront her, thinking it was her.  Allison tells Jo Beth it wasn't her, and Jo Beth asks to see her engagement ring.  Allison shows it to her, and it is clearly different from the one she saw at the store.  Realizing there are three wives and not two in the picture, a horrified Jo Beth collapses in agony; it is later revealed that she had a heart attack.\nNick gets home to Dallas after having two credit cards confiscated, and finding out his Thunderbird was gone, and wonders what is going on.  He gets home to find out from his son that Jo Beth had a heart attack.  At the same time, he sent Miriam off to his friend's apartment playing it off as his own.  However, his friend finally gets sick of playing the game and tells Miriam the truth, so she goes to the hospital to confront Nick.\nAt the hospital Nick finds Allison and finds out Jo Beth refuses to let him into the room she's in.  When Miriam arrives, she finds out the whole truth, then slaps Nick across his face, threatens him with her father, and leaves in a huff.  Meanwhile, Allison simply says she's not going to relocate to Dallas and packs up back for Chicago, but not before giving Nick a final kiss, and telling him she always knew he was too good to be true.\nThree months later after he and Jo Beth's divorce (the other two were officially null and void due to bigamy laws), he is on another flight pattern from the one he was on before, plus he sees Jo Beth send Eric off to Dorsett.  He would explain to his friend why he tried to be married to all three girls. (He was always afraid he would lose one of them.) After he departs from him, he ends up bumping into another girl and they seem to connect right away.

Then on the night of a meteor shower, while out on field trip, Science instructor Midori Honami and her group of kids witness a huge meteor plunge into the mountain snow. The next night, two security guards are horrified as they see large insect-like creatures stealing glass bottles from a nearby warehouse. Soon after, the entire city of Sapporo is covered with strange plants and the link between these events soon becomes clear. These series of bizarre incidents reveal a new threat to the Land of the Rising Sun.\nThe meteor has carried with it a species of extraterrestrials. These aliens, which have a unique form of biochemistry that involves silicon, have set up a hive in the bowels of the city's subway tunnels, deliberately nurturing a plant that grows out of the subway and into the city. Soon a gigantic pod erupts from a building and Colonel Watarase of the Self Defense Force realizes that it is dramatically raising the city's oxygen levels. Working together with the swift-minded Miss Honami, he realizes that the aliens are building a huge biological launchpad: the increased oxygen will aid the creatures in exploding the flower, catapulting its seed into space so that they can colonize yet another world. The military can only watch helplessly, as any attempt to destroy the plant would destroy all of Sapporo.\nJust as all hope is lost, Gamera emerges from the sea and heads toward the besieged city. He tears the flower out by its roots, but is ambushed by a swarm of the alien insect soldiers. As Gamera thrashes to rid himself of the attacking insects, a nearby soldier names them \"Legion\", in reference to something similar about a person possessed by many evil spirits called Legion mentioned in the Holy Bible. Gamera is forced to retreat, just as the monstrous Legion queen, the Mother Legion, bursts out of the ground and flies off to start a second hive. Her wings are damaged by fighter jets, but she survives. Again a Legion flower blooms, this time in Sendai, and again Gamera attempts to stop its explosion. He is intercepted, however, by Legion. Legion makes short work of Gamera, impaling him with her sharp legs and blasting him with her horn beam. Sensing the detonation of her pod approaching, Legion leaves Gamera for dead and burrows off. Gamera limps toward the plant, destroying it by knocking it down before it launches its seed into space. The flower explodes and completely annihilates Sendai, seemingly killing Gamera.\nJapan's military and scientists race to find Legion's weakness, but have so far found only one clue: the smaller symbiotic Legion are attracted to any electromagnetic source, such as power lines. While this may enable the army to distract them, it has the unfortunate side-effect of drawing them to Tokyo. With the failure of both their previous attempts at propagating their kind, the Legion are growing desperate. Asagi travels to Sendai where Gamera lies comatose and as she tries to reach out to him, the orihalcum magatama that enables their bond shatters.

She spawns a swarm of insect soldiers against him, but the military manages to draw them off and destroy them using a power station's electrical pylons. Gamera fights on, but is unable to get his attacks past Mother Legion's claws, which generate an electromagnetic field that dissipates Gamera's fire. After the JSDF blows off several of Mother Legion's claws, Gamera manages to tear off her horn and she momentarily collapses in defeat. Enraged, Mother Legion gets back up and begins lashing Gamera with crimson energy tendrils referred to as the Red Rod, searing Gamera's skin and rapidly overpowering him.

Colonel John Henry Patterson, an Anglo-Irish British military engineer, to get the project on schedule. Patterson travels from England to Tsavo, promising his wife, Helena, that he will complete the bridge and be back in London for the birth of their child. Shortly after his arrival, he meets British supervisor Angus Starling, Kenyan foreman Samuel, and Doctor David Hawthorne. Hawthorne informs Patterson of a recent lion attack that has affected the undertaking.\nThat same night, Patterson ends the life of an approaching lion with a single gunshot, earning the respect of the laborers and allowing them to resume their activities safely. Only a few weeks after, however, Mahina, the construction foreman, is dragged from his tent. At sunrise, his mutilated body is recovered, and Patterson tries another night-time hunt, seeking to catch the lion that ate Mahina, but in the morning, he is informed by Starling that the corpse of a second worker has been found at the opposing end of the camp from his position.\nPatterson, heeding the advice of Samuel, employs the workers in building thorn fences around the tents in order to prevent any lions from entering. Several days later, in broad daylight, a lion assails the camp, killing another worker. As Patterson, Starling, and Samuel corner the lion while it is feasting on the body, another lion leaps upon them from the roof of a building, slicing Starling across the throat and injuring Patterson on the left arm. Patterson recovers and attempts to shoot them, but both lions escape. Samuel states that there has never been a pair of man-eaters before; they have always been solitary hunters.\nThe workers, led by a man named Abdullah, begin to turn on Patterson and, consequently, progress on the bridge comes to a halt. Patterson requests soldiers from England as protection, but he is denied. During a brief visit to the site, Beaumont threatens Patterson that, should his commission not be concluded on time, he will tarnish his reputation. He also announces that he will be contacting the famed hunter Charles Remington to help Patterson in eliminating the threat due to his past failures.\nA short time later, Remington reaches Tsavo with the company of skilled Maasai warriors, who dub the lions \"the Ghost\" and \"the Darkness\" because of their notorious methods. Remington\u2019s initial attempt to trap one lion in a thicket fails when Patterson's borrowed gun misfires. The warriors decide to leave, daunted by the beast, but Remington elects to stay behind. He constructs a new hospital tent for sick and injured workers and tempts the lions to the abandoned building with animal parts and blood. The man-eaters seemingly fall for the trap, but Remington and Patterson shoot at them, and they retreat to the new hospital, slaughtering many patients and Hawthorne.\nAbdullah and the workers depart, leaving Patterson, Remington, and Samuel alone. The former two locate the animals' lair and discover the bones of dozens of victims, leading Remington to the realization that the lions are acting as they have been merely for sport. Back at camp that evening, Patterson mounts a hunting stand in a clearing and lures one of the predators to his position using a baboon as bait. The plan goes awry after Patterson falls from the stand, but Remington manages to slay the feline before it can leap on Patterson. He, Patterson, and Samuel spend the remainder of the night drinking and celebrating, but the next morning, Patterson awakes to find that the remaining lion has devoured Remington as he and Samuel slept.\nThe two men cremate Remington\u2019s remains and burn the tall grass surrounding the camp, driving the surviving lion toward the trap that they have set there. It ambushes them on the partially constructed bridge and, after a lengthy chase, Patterson finally dispatches it with a double-rifle Samuel has thrown to him from a nearby tree.

It was suspected that Byron De La Beckwith, a white supremacist, was the murderer. He had been tried twice in the 1960s and both trials ended in hung juries. Evers' widow Myrlie Evers had been trying to bring De La Beckwith to justice for over 25 years.\nIn 1989, emboldened by a newspaper article by Jerry Mitchell exposing jury tampering by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission in the first two trials, Myrlie Evers believed she had what it takes to bring him to trial again. Although most of the evidence from the old trial had disappeared, Bobby DeLaughter, an assistant District Attorney, decided to help her despite being warned that it might hurt his political aspirations and despite the strain that it caused in his marriage. DeLaughter forms a team of investigators from his office, however, the investigation suffers many setbacks.\nAfter learning that several of the key witnesses have died, and the court transcript of their testimony from the 1960s trials is lost, the team is convinced this is a futile effort. This is re-inforced when DeLaughter fails at a desperate strategy of convincing two police officers who provided De La Beckwith with an alibi in the 1960s trials to admit they lied under oath. However, their pessimism fades with two discoveries. The rifle used in the murder, thought to have been lost, was hiding in plain sight. Later, one of the investigators learns of the existence of a witness unknown to the prosecution in the 1960s trials, Delmar Dennis. Dennis was a former member of the Ku Klux Klan who agreed to be an undercover informant for the FBI. Dennis testified against the Klan in the Mississippi Burning case, and once mentioned having met De La Beckwith. The investigation turns to finding Dennis, who was living in hiding since turning state's evidence on the KKK, to see what he knows of the case.\nOnce confirming that Dennis indeed had met De La Beckwith, the team is optimistic they have enough to secure a new indictment. As knowledge becomes public that the district attorney's office has re-opened the case, white supremacist elements threaten DeLaughter and his children, having by this time separated from his wife. After committing to Myrlie that he will try De La Beckwith again, Myrlie, initially skeptical of DeLaughter, reveals that she has a court certified transcript of one of the 1960s trails in her possession. DeLaughter had long sought such a transcript to be able to read testimony from deceased witnesses to the jury for the new trial. DeLaughter mostly presents the same case as was presented in the 1960s trial, except using Dennis and two other witnesses to testify as substitutes for deceased witnesses, and having Detective Lloyd Bennett read the testimony of his father, Detective LC Bennett, the officer who found the murder weapon while searching the crime scene, to the jury.\nIn 1994, Byron De La Beckwith was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment.

One day in 1969, the nanny was gambling and as she just put her jade ring down as a bet, the banker of the gambling den, Tai-Chin, created a ruse that the police is coming and ran away with the ring and other bet in the chaos. While running away, Tai-Chin's daughter, Seven, tripped and fell but Ko Chun pushed her away from further danger. Ko Chun, however, was kidnapped by some child kidnapper and was about to have his hands chopped off so he can become a beggar and beg for money, Kent stepped in and offered to buy Ko Chun while also bringing another child that he had bought at the same place, Ko Ngo to take down the child kidnapper and thus, Ko Chun became Kent's adopted son and also, student in the arts of gambling.\nYears later, in 1986, Seven has grown up and So told her that he brought a Vietnamese friend, Lung Wu, along to meet her and told her that her dad had found a way in the Central district to cheat some money off some poor guys in a gambling scheme. Just before they left the mahjong parlour, a gangster Mothball that Seven had offended earlier brought a couple of men to trash the place and also harm her. However, Lung Wu caught it early and as a payback for the ten bowls of Char Siew rice he ate off Seven's generosity, Lung Wu single-handedly beat every gangster to the ground with just a vinyl tape that he snapped into half and use it as a makeshift shiv. After fighting them down, Lung Wu, Seven and So left for Central. When they arrived, Seven instantly recognized Kent and Ko Chun but initially kept silent about it. After Kent left the table, he asked Ko Chun to substitute him in. However, it was a ruse as the others thought that Kent was losing but the cards Ko Chun opened turned out to be a Three of a Kind which beats the nearest Pair of Ks. Enraged, the banker of the table sent men to chase after Kent and his posse when they leave. As Ko Chun was leaving, he glanced upon Seven and noticed the jade ring she had around her neck was what his nanny had pawned during the earlier gambling scene and tend to recognize Seven as the little girl but did not say anything and left. Sensing something was wrong, Seven dispatched Lung Wu to shadow Ko Chun and make sure he suffers no injury. Lung Wu shadowed Ko Chun into the subway train and soon, both started to fight in the train for 1 minute. After no one could be declared the winner, both agreed that it's a draw and both started befriending each other then.\nWeeks later, Kent told Ko Chun that there's an international \"God of Gamblers\" tournament in Macau and he wants the whole team to be there including Ko Ngo and his daughter, Hing, to support Ko Chun in the competition to win as the \"God of Gamblers\" with the prize being the owner of all of Asia's casino. Already knowing how well Lung Wu fights, Ko Chun went to find Lung Wu for extra support and Lung Wu agreed. Seven and Ko Chun both recognized each other immediately and reminisce their encounter when they were young and Ko Chun soon left the house and went to Macau for the competition. Just before the second round of competition begins, Kent passed him a discreet item that was actually a gun that can't be detected by any metal detectors. During the second round of competition, only Ko Chun and Ko Ngo were left at the table. Ko Chun knew his card were bigger than Ko Ngo and cannot fathom why Ko Ngo would continue betting despite losing, he questions Kent on the reasons why while both are in the toilet. However, Kent shows his true colours as he was actually a big bookie that was hedging on Ko Chun's loss and told Ko Chun to lose. However, Ko Chun did not parlay and insisted on winning. Out of options, Kent lured Ko Chun into a hug and promised him that Ko Chun could do whatever he wants only to see himself get shot by the same kind of gun that Kent gave him into the side of his brain. As Ko Chun collapsed, he realized that the one that killed his dad was actually Kent due to the words his mother had told him: \"I have seen the killer and the man is mental to be able to laugh consistently even when he kills a man\".\nMiraculously, Ko Chun managed to survive the gunshot wound and fell into a coma for almost 3 month. While during that time, Ko Ngo became the \"God of Gambler\" and took Hing as his wife. Seven, So and Lung Wu has been taking of him in the hospital while he was still in a delirious state after awaking, constantly having flashbacks of the shooting. He even refused to eat and entered \"shutdown mode\" locking himself from all sort of communication. He even refused to eat till Lung Wu stuffed dark chocolates into his mouth to ensure he has the energy after refusing to eat for 3 days and somehow, ended up enjoying it and finishing the whole box. Lung Wu soon found out that the outside world, including his rival Ko Ngo, knew that Ko Chun isn't actually dead and being in a hospital could pose as a danger to Ko Chun thus, they moved him to Seven's house where Seven took good care of him. While taking care of him, Ko Chun opened up finally and guarantees that he will be able to make a comeback. With that guarantee that Ko Chun is already has a stable mind, Seven went to her dad's mahjong parlor to borrow money from Tai-Chin but along the way to the parlor, So revealed that Tai-Chin had actually owed Mothball a lot of money and could not lend Seven the money but when they reach the parlor, Mothball was already in the parlor while pinning Tai-Chin with his feet. To wriggle out of the situation, So blurted out that the God of Gambler is actually the future husband of Seven and Mothball instantly threatened So to bring the God of Gambler to him or else Tai-Chin, Seven and himself would be shot dead. When So reached the house, Ko Ngo was already in the house goading Ko Chun. Ko Chun initially showed close to no response but after watching and hearing from Ko Ngo that he had actually married Hing and actually got her pregnant, he got enraged which aggravated the wound and slowly lost his sense of thought and became slightly retarded. Not wanting to land everyone in trouble, So still brought the now-retarded Ko Chun to the mahjong parlor in a wig to disguise him as the God of Gambler. Despite being retarded, Ko Chun never lost his skill in cheating nor gambling and instead won all 3 rounds against Mothball through cheating. Enraged, Mothball started and his men started to whack So for lying to them but it turned out that the guy they were beating was Lung Wu disguising as So. Lung Wu flipped the situation and fought every of Mothball's men down including Mothball himself.\nWhen they reached home, the doctor had officially declared Ko Chun mentally unstable. However, the whole house was bugged by Ko Ngo and Kent. Fearing that Ko Chun might just be feigning to be retarded and ruin Ko Ngo's plan for yet another upcoming competition, they orchestrated Ko Chun's kidnapping and succeeded. However, Lung Wu witnessed it and stopped Seven for calling the police realizing that the ploy was to prevent Ko Chun from entering the 2nd \"God of Gamblers\" competition in Macau yet again and vowed to get Ko Chun out from Ko Ngo's hand. In Macau, Ko Ngo was just introduced to be the representative for Hong Kong but soon after, Seven, Lung Wu, So and Tai-Chin arrived and Lung Wu instantly went up on stage and berate Ko Ngo. Just then, Ko Chun arrived his presence. Turns out, his \"kidnapping\" was a ruse to confuse Ko Ngo as he did not become a retard after all and had always been in contact with the European side that were also competing and agreed to be their representative while also being protected by the FBI. Ko Chun also professed his love for Ko Chun.\nWhile in the new safehouse, Ko Chun deduced that due to Kent knowing his prowess, Kent himself have zero confidence that Ko Chun would actually lose and due to the way Kent has been handling things, he would surely send assassins to claim Ko Chun's life. Just as Ko Chun predicted, Kent sent a bunch of Vietnamese assassins to wipe out the whole safehouse estate of guards and also to claim Ko Chun's life. While the assassins were dealing with the Caucasian guards around the premise, Tai-Chin was awaken by the constant loud thuds he was hearing. Curious, he opened the balcony and have a peek of was going on before being slashed in the throat by the lead assassin before being left for death. While Lung Wu was fighting those nearest to him, Tai-Chin crawled to the nearest assassin facing Ko Chun and Seven and bit the assassin in the leg with his last breath before being shot by the said assassin. Both Seven and Ko Chun split in the chaos with Lung Wu finally arriving beside Ko Chun's side. When Lung Wu, Ko Chun and So met, they heard noises on the roof and rushed up only to find the lead assassin had already tied Seven up and threatened to push her down while challenging both Lung Wu and Ko Chun to a fight. Ko Chun stepped out of the door and agreed to fight the assassin. However, the assassin turned his gun and tried to fire a shot at Ko Chun only to have Lung Wu throwing a dagger at his firing arm which caused him too lose his grip on Seven and Seven fell off the ledge. Ko Chun tried to save Seven but missed and Lung Wu held Ko Chun tight to prevent him from falling too but got stabbed in the back. So took a plastic chair and smashed it against the assassin while Ko Chun and Lung Wu recovered from their position and both simultaneously attacking the assassin till Ko Chun kicked him off the roof and fell to his death.\nBefore the competition. it was revealed that Seven actually did not die from the fall but was in a comatose state and requiring apparatuses to keep her alive. Ko Chun requested to see her and not wanting her to suffer, he hugged her for the last time, kissed her forehead and turned off her oxygen mask to put her out of the suffering and left for the competition. \nDuring the competition, Ko Chun folded every round and never placed a bet. Till the final round as things were heated up, he asked for the cards to be covered. Hing revealed her support for Ko Chun with bank bonds worth $30 Million dollars for the side bet between Ko Chun and Ko Ngo. On top of the side bet, Ko Ngo, feeling arrogant that he would win, raised the stake to even bet on each other's hand which Ko Chun agrees to. As the competition resumes, it revealed that Hing was actually lying to Ko Chun that she had switched her allegiance and her intention was to switch cards away from Ko Chun which allow Ko Ngo to gain Ko Chun's 10 of Hearts to beat him with a Straight Flush. However, Ko Chun already predicted it and when both showed their hands, it's revealed that Ko Chun had all along knew about the cheats Ko Ngo and Hing was doing together with the one-eyed man behind him giving out instructions of Ko Chun's cards. To counter that, he had corners of red cards all in his pocket and used it to cover up his base card to trick the man behind and sensing Hing wasn't sincere, he purposely let Hing swapped his card as even with the swap, Ko Chun won with a Three of a Kind with 2's while all Ko Ngo had was an Ace High (If he had the Hearts of 10 (Which Ko Chun lied with the quartered card), he would have won but Ko Chun's base card was actually a Ace of Spade).\nWith no more options left and to honor the bet, Lung Wu took out an axe and chopping board to allow Ko Ngo to honour and chop off his hand. Pleading for Kent's help, Kent instead just turns around and live with Ko Chun backing up that Ko Ngo had been fooled into thinking that Kent treats him like a treasure but Kent actually dispose him because he's useless now. Enraged, Ko Ngo took the axe and chased after the leaving Kent. Kent turned around and tries to shoot Ko Ngo with the concealed gun only to realize at the last minute that the gun has been switched to a lipstick by So on the orders of Ko Chun and helplessly gets chopped to death by Ko Ngo. Wanting to exact revenge, Ko Ngo instantly flipped around and charged towards Ko Chun but Lung Wu disposed him with a flying kick while the rest of the guards surrounding the venue subdues him.", "tmdb_plot": "Following Ko Chun's earlier years as he battles for the position he was destined for: The God of Gamblers.", "tmdb_id": "57661", "wiki_id": "12076940"}, {"title": "Gokulathil Seethai", "genres": ["Family", "Drama", "Romance"], "wiki_plot": "Rishi sleeps around through the efforts of a sophisticated, dedicated and \u2018immigration officer\u2019 look alike pimp.

Nila warns Rishi that her first night will turn out to be Rishi's last night. Rishi sarcastically approves her \"bravado\" but still encourages her to go in. Nila enters that house confused until she sees Mohan begging his parents and his sister to approve his love for Nila. What follows is an ugly altercation among the four. Rishi who is drinking outside the house hears this and enters in. Mohan tells his parents that Rishi is his boss and he gave the house as a gift for their upcoming wedding. Mohan's parents talk ill of Rishi and sarcastically suggest him to marry Nila since he gave her a ride in the middle of the night. Mohan changes his mind soon and asks Rishi to drop Nila back off at the wedding hall. Rishi gets upset at Mohan and tries to convince him about Nila's trust but in vain. Nila gives up on Mohan and asks Rishi to leave the place. Rishi leaves the house calling Mohan an \"idiot\". He offers Nila to drop her off at the wedding hall. But Nila hesitates to go back worrying about her sister's future. Rishi offers his own house until she finds a place on her own. Nila who is initially sceptical accepts the offer after Rishi's word that he'll never mistreat someone in despair.\nRRishi tells Mohan that he should\u2019ve fired him for what he did the previous night but lets him stay due to his family debts but confirms that their friendship is over. Rishi later takes Nila to a party where his friends mistake her for a call girl and embarrass her by asking her price per night. Rishi gets angry and storms out of the place with Nila. Rishi apologises to Nila for what happened but she shrugs it off by letting him know that Rishi had never been out with his mother or sisters or any other decent woman. This hurts Rishi who drinks too much and they get into a big argument. Nila cools him off by offering her friendship.\nThe Pimp visits Rishi at his home next day and is surprised to see Nila in and congratulates him on his conquest. Rishi clarifies to him that she is just a platonic friend and that he made a mistake and ruined her life. That day Nila suggests a critical business solution to Rishi and his dad asks Rishi to hire her immediately. During a business lunch at the office, Rishi subtly suggests to Nila that she could still reconsider her decision about Mohan. Nila diplomatically changes the topic. A \u2018gossip\u2019 fight within the office premise between Mohan and a colleague leads Rishi to intervene and stop. Mohan argues that he entered into Nila's life at the first place which makes Nila angry who lashes out at Mohan pointing that he has never crossed her life at any point. She also says good things about Rishi and clarifies their relationship to other employees (a reference to epic \u2018Ramayana\u2019 is made by Nila where everyone knows Sita's stage of life in Ashokavanam, but if Sita had been in \u2018Gokulam\u2019 she would\u2019ve been safer & happier) that makes him feel good. Later, Rishi feels bemused on being asked to get out of Nila's room for her to be able to change her clothes after shower and starts to feel something new that he has never felt before and leaves the room.\nAn excited Rishi admits to his dad that if what he feels is love, he just loves \u2018this love\u2019 and asks his dad to speak to Nila on behalf of him. His dad agrees, but, when he privately talks to Nila, he asks her a question that upsets her and she leaves the house. A totally confused Rishi asks Nila as to what upset her, which she refuses to tell.\nRishi argues with his dad on having asked her such a stupid question and points out the differences between them and tells him that their relationship is over. He also asks his dad to get the heck out of his house for which his dad laughs and points out that the entire wealth is his hard earned money and if someone has to get out, it should be Rishi. At that moment a phone call reveals that Nila had mentioned Rishi as her guardian at a ladies hostel. Rishi proudly points that out to his dad and storms out. Later, when the cook criticises Rishi's dad for having done this to his son, Rishi\u2019s dad reveals that he talked to Nila the way he did not just to test her but to test Rishi as well. He also goes on to reveal that he is happy that Rishi is able to decide on his own and that he is confident that he'll come back.\nRishi visits Nila at the hostel after a brief altercation with the security guard. Nila avoids talking to Rishi who understands her anger and reveals to the entire group of women gathered there that the reason for his visit was not to force or harass Nila but to acknowledge that she has transformed him into a human being and that she is the only reason that he is now able to respect any woman. He bids goodbye and leaves as Nila stops him, cries and apologises that she mistook Rishi to be a jerk like Mohan when he sent his dad to speak on his behalf but now realises that he did it out of respect for her. She also accepts defeat of her own agenda by concluding that \"there is nothing wrong in falling in love with someone like Rishi before marriage\" and tells him that she loves him and they leave the hostel together.", "tmdb_plot": "Rishi, the son of a wealthy man, leads a carefree lifestyle.

Denmark has a long-standing feud with neighbouring Norway, in which King Hamlet slew King Fortinbras of Norway in a battle some years ago. Although Denmark defeated Norway and the Norwegian throne fell to King Fortinbras's infirm brother, Denmark fears that an invasion led by the dead Norwegian king's son, Prince Fortinbras, is imminent.\nOn a cold night on the ramparts of Elsinore, the Danish royal castle, the sentries Bernardo and Marcellus discuss a ghost resembling the late King Hamlet which they have recently seen, and bring Prince Hamlet's friend Horatio as a witness. After the ghost appears again, the three vow to tell Prince Hamlet what they have witnessed.\nAs the court gathers the next day, while King Claudius and Queen Gertrude discuss affairs of state with their elderly adviser Polonius, Hamlet looks on glumly. During the court, Claudius grants permission for Polonius's son Laertes to return to school in France and sends envoys to inform the King of Norway about Fortinbras. Claudius also scolds Hamlet for continuing to grieve over his father and forbids him to return to his schooling in Wittenberg. After the court exits, Hamlet despairs of his father's death and his mother's hasty remarriage. Learning of the ghost from Horatio, Hamlet resolves to see it himself.\nAs Polonius's son Laertes prepares to depart for a visit to France, Polonius offers him advice that culminates in the maxim \"to thine own self be true.\" Polonius's daughter, Ophelia, admits her interest in Hamlet, but Laertes warns her against seeking the prince's attention, and Polonius orders her to reject his advances. That night on the rampart, the ghost appears to Hamlet, telling the prince that he was murdered by Claudius and demanding that Hamlet avenge him. Hamlet agrees, and the ghost vanishes. The prince confides to Horatio and the sentries that from now on he plans to \"put an antic disposition on\", or act as though he has gone mad, and forces them to swear to keep his plans for revenge secret; however, he remains uncertain of the ghost's reliability.\nSoon thereafter, Ophelia rushes to her father, telling him that Hamlet arrived at her door the prior night half-undressed and behaving erratically.

Impressed by their delivery of the speech, he plots to stage The Murder of Gonzago, a play featuring a death in the style of his father's murder, and to determine the truth of the ghost's story, as well as Claudius's guilt or innocence, by studying Claudius's reaction.\nPolonius forces Ophelia to return Hamlet's love letters and tokens of affection to the prince while he and Claudius watch from afar to evaluate Hamlet's reaction. Hamlet is walking alone in the hall as the King and Polonius await Ophelia's entrance, musing whether \"to be or not to be\". When Ophelia enters and tries to return Hamlet's things, Hamlet accuses her of immodesty and cries \"get thee to a nunnery\", though it is unclear whether this, too, is a show of madness or genuine distress. His reaction convinces Claudius that Hamlet is not mad for love. Shortly thereafter, the court assembles to watch the play Hamlet has commissioned. After seeing the Player King murdered by his rival pouring poison in his ear, Claudius abruptly rises and runs from the room; for Hamlet, this is proof positive of his uncle's guilt.\nGertrude summons Hamlet to her chamber to demand an explanation. Meanwhile, Claudius talks to himself about the impossibility of repenting, since he still has possession of his ill-gotten goods: his brother's crown and wife. He sinks to his knees. On his way to visit his mother, Hamlet sneaks up behind him but does not kill him, reasoning that killing Claudius while he is praying will send him straight to heaven while his father's ghost is stuck in purgatory. In the queen's bedchamber, Hamlet and Gertrude fight bitterly. Polonius, spying on the conversation from behind a tapestry, calls for help as Gertrude, believing Hamlet wants to kill her, calls out for help herself.\nHamlet, believing it is Claudius, stabs wildly, killing Polonius, but he pulls aside the curtain and sees his mistake. In a rage, Hamlet brutally insults his mother for her apparent ignorance of Claudius's villainy, but the ghost enters and reprimands Hamlet for his inaction and harsh words. Unable to see or hear the ghost herself, Gertrude takes Hamlet's conversation with it as further evidence of madness. After begging the queen to stop sleeping with Claudius, Hamlet leaves, dragging Polonius's corpse away.\nHamlet jokes with Claudius about where he has hidden Polonius's body, and the King, fearing for his life, sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to accompany Hamlet to England with a sealed letter to the King of England requesting that Hamlet be executed immediately.\nUnhinged by grief at Polonius's death, Ophelia wanders Elsinore. Laertes arrives back from France, enraged by his father's death and his sister's madness. Claudius convinces Laertes that Hamlet is solely responsible, but a letter soon arrives indicating that Hamlet has returned to Denmark, foiling Claudius's plan. Claudius switches tactics, proposing a fencing match between Laertes and Hamlet to settle their differences. Laertes will be given a poison-tipped foil, and, if that fails, Claudius will offer Hamlet poisoned wine as a congratulation. Gertrude interrupts to report that Ophelia has drowned, though it is unclear whether it was suicide or an accident caused by her madness.\nHoratio has received a letter from Hamlet, explaining that the prince escaped by negotiating with pirates who attempted to attack his England-bound ship, and the friends reunite offstage. Two gravediggers discuss Ophelia's apparent suicide while digging her grave. Hamlet arrives with Horatio and banters with one of the gravediggers, who unearths the skull of a jester from Hamlet's childhood, Yorick. Hamlet picks up the skull, saying \"alas, poor Yorick\" as he contemplates mortality. Ophelia's funeral procession approaches, led by Laertes. Hamlet and Horatio initially hide, but when Hamlet realizes that Ophelia is the one being buried, he reveals himself, proclaiming his love for her. Laertes and Hamlet fight by Ophelia's graveside, but the brawl is broken up.\nBack at Elsinore, Hamlet explains to Horatio that he had discovered Claudius's letter with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's belongings and replaced it with a forged copy indicating that his former friends should be killed instead. A foppish courtier, Osric, interrupts the conversation to deliver the fencing challenge to Hamlet. Hamlet, despite Horatio's pleas, accepts it. Hamlet does well at first, leading the match by two hits to none, and Gertrude raises a toast to him using the poisoned glass of wine Claudius had set aside for Hamlet. Claudius tries to stop her but is too late: she drinks, and Laertes realizes the plot will be revealed. Laertes slashes Hamlet with his poisoned blade. In the ensuing scuffle, they switch weapons, and Hamlet wounds Laertes with his own poisoned sword. Gertrude collapses and, claiming she has been poisoned, dies. In his dying moments, Laertes reconciles with Hamlet and reveals Claudius's plan. Hamlet rushes at Claudius and kills him. As the poison takes effect, Hamlet, hearing that Fortinbras is marching through the area, names the Norwegian prince as his successor. Horatio, distraught at the thought of being the last survivor and living whilst Hamlet does not, says he will commit suicide by drinking the dregs of Gertrude's poisoned wine, but Hamlet begs him to live on and tell his story. Hamlet dies in Horatio's arms, proclaiming \"the rest is silence\". Fortinbras, who was ostensibly marching towards Poland with his army, arrives at the palace, along with an English ambassador bringing news of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern's deaths. Horatio promises to recount the full story of what happened, and Fortinbras, seeing the entire Danish royal family dead, takes the crown for himself and orders a military funeral to honour Prince Hamlet.\nThis is done and the film ends on an image of a statue of King Hamlet being demolished.", "tmdb_plot": "Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, returns home to find his father murdered and his mother now marrying the murderer... his uncle.

He becomes even frustrated after learning that no more singers are available. At the same time, Mrs O'Flaherty keeps asking for Dean Swift's help for Jamie, but he is too busy to listen. The Dean promises Handel to lend singers from Christ Church despite his abnormal thinking pattern which leads to Handel's confusion and difficulty with further conversation.\nMrs O'Flaherty, sobbing, approaches Handel when he is preparing his work on an off-key harpsichord and grumbling about his circumstances. She asks for his assistance to assure the Dean's help, and in return promises him free laundry. Handel eventually agrees despite initial refusal.

Jamie tells him his story, his frustration with life, and his intention to quit. In response Handel tells Jamie that he must listen to his another voice, which tells right and wrong apart.

Jamie eventually changes his mind, and makes a deal with Handel that he will stay only for he teach him to read music.\nTheir collaboration goes on successfully.

LeMarchand runs home in terror, where he begins working on blueprints for a second box which will neutralize the effects of the first. Returning to L'Isle's mansion to steal the box, LeMarchand discovers that Jacques has killed L'Isle and taken control over Angelique, who agrees to be his slave so long as he does not impede the wishes of Hell. The pair kill LeMarchand, and Jacques informs him that his bloodline is now cursed for helping to open a portal to Hell.\nIn 1996, LeMarchand's descendant, John Merchant, has built a skyscraper in Manhattan that resembles the Lament Configuration. Seeing an article on the building in a magazine, Angelique asks Jacques to take her to the United States so that she can confront him. When Jacques denies her request, Angelique kills him, as Merchant poses a threat to Hell. Angelique travels to the United States, where she fails to seduce Merchant. Discovering the Lament Configuration in the building's foundation, Angelique tricks a security guard into solving it, which summons Pinhead. The two immediately clash, as Pinhead represents a shift in the ideologies of Hell, which she left behind two hundred years ago: while Angelique believes in corrupting people through temptation, Pinhead is fanatically devoted to pain and suffering. Despite their conflicting views, the pair forge an uneasy alliance to kill Merchant before he can complete the Elysium Configuration, an anti-Lament Configuration that creates perpetual light and would serve to permanently close all gateways to Hell.\nAngelique and Pinhead initially collaborate to corrupt Merchant, but Pinhead grows tired of Angelique's seductive techniques and threatens to kill Merchant's wife and child. Having grown accustomed to a decadent life on Earth, Angelique wants no part of Hell's new fanatical austerity, and she intends to force Merchant to activate the Elysium Configuration and destroy Hell, thus freeing her from its imperatives. However, Merchant's flawed prototype fails. Pinhead kills Merchant, but his wife opens Angelique's Lament Configuration, sending Pinhead and Angelique back to Hell.\nIn 2127, Rimmer disbelieves Dr. Merchant's story and has him locked away. Pinhead and his followers - now including an enslaved Angelique - have already been freed after Merchant opened the box. Upon learning of Dr. Merchant's intentions, they kill the entire crew of the ship, save for Rimmer and Dr. Merchant, who escape. Dr. Merchant reveals that the Minos is, in fact, the final, perfected form of the Elysium Configuration, and that by activating it, he can kill Pinhead and permanently seal the gateway to Hell.\nDr. Merchant distracts Pinhead with a hologram while he boards an escape pod with Rimmer. Once clear of the station, he activates the Elysium Configuration. A series of powerful lasers and mirrors create a field of perpetual light, while the station transforms and folds around the light to create a massive box. The light is trapped within the box, killing Pinhead and his followers, thus ending Pinhead's existence, this time, permanently.", "tmdb_plot": "Three generations of the same family deal with the consequences of unleashing the forces of hell.", "tmdb_id": "8766", "wiki_id": "3745404"}, {"title": "Henequen", "genres": ["History", "Drama"], "wiki_plot": "This historical drama, set in 1905, depicts the difficult plight of Korean henequen field laborers in Mexico.

The genie, who introduces himself as Kazaam, a 3,000-year-old genie, tells Max that he is now Max's genie and proves it to him by demonstrating his powers, which results in Kazaam disappearing off the face of the earth.\nMax spots his father in passing during his return home from school, and finds that his mother is marrying a fireman named Travis O\u2019Neil. Max instantly rejects Travis, and when his mother confronts him on his behavior, he counters by confronting her that she lied to him about his real father's whereabouts, and that he is actually located in the city.  Max then sets out to search for his father in the hopes of rekindling their relationship. He suddenly encounters Kazaam during his travels, who pesters Max into making a wish. Max eventually finds his father, only to learn that he is a musical talent agent who specializes in unauthorized music.  But he initially doesn\u2019t care because his father, Nick Matteo by name, is overjoyed to see him again, introduces Max (Matteo) to the other employees of the agency, and gives him free VIP passes to an upcoming concert at the nightclub he works at.\nMax goes to his personal secret hideout and tells Kazaam about his father. They decide to have a bike race through Max's hideout, during which Kazaam shows off his powers. Kazaam finally convinces Max to make his first wish, which consists of junk food raining from the sky. While eating all of this, Max suddenly realizes that he owns Kazaam until he makes his last two wishes. Max and Kazaam go out to see Max's father again.\nAfter getting past an intimidating bodyguard, Max and Kazaam attend the show, where the performing act (with a little needling from Max) persuade Kazaam to join in. Malik, the owner of the nightclub, shows interest in Kazaam upon the realization that he is a genie, and he hopes to control Kazaam through Max's father. The next day, Kazaam stays in Max's home and passes himself off as Max's tutor.\nMax confesses to Kazaam that he and his father aren't really connecting, though Kazaam attempts to shirk the issue with some rapping, revealing how he and his \u201cbest friend, Ha\u2019ber, in 1000 BC\u201d first became genies. Max attempts to wish for his father and mother to fall back in love, but Kazaam cannot grant this wish because he is not a djinn, and therefore not free to grant ethereal wishes.\nLater that day, Max witnesses his father being assaulted by Malik and his minions due to a master tape being stolen during a robbery done by Max\u2019s bullies with reluctance from Max and goes to Kazaam for help. Kazaam just received a record deal as a professional rapper and is reluctant to help Max. So Max uses his second wish to conjure a replacement tape, though this causes an argument and a rift to form between him and Kazaam.  After school, when Max's father demands his son to hand over the Record Tape that he stole last night, he does. Then he leaves realizing that he won't get a second chance with him. Later that night, Max is kidnapped by Malik and takes possession of Kazaam's boombox, with his father being held hostage as well.   Malik, having taken control of Kazaam's boombox, is now in control of Kazaam himself. Max is pushed down an elevator shaft by Malik. He summons Kazaam in the hopes that he will do his bidding. While Kazaam is initially powerless against his master, he soon breaks free from his oppression and defeats Malik and his minions.\nKazaam transforms Malik into a basketball and then slam dunks him into a garbage disposal. However, he then finds Max's lifeless body, and wishes that he could have granted Max's wish to give his father a second chance at life. Then, in his sorrow, Kazaam finally becomes a djinn, and is therefore able to do this for Max. With him officially a djinn, he pulls Max out of harm's way and carried out of the burning building by Travis. Max's father then shows up and tells him that he hopes to rekindle the bonding with his son, before he takes off with authorities.

Later, Littlefoot meets a female Longneck named Ali and invites her to play. He introduces her to his friends, but as she is not used to associating with diverse species, she is afraid of them. Meanwhile, Littlefoot\u2019s Grandpa becomes ill. The Old One notes that she is familiar with the illness, having seen the illness many times in her life, which is lethal to any dinosaur unless they eat the petals of the \"golden night flower,\" which only grows in the Land of Mists. When Littlefoot\u2019s Grandma asks one of the other Longnecks who should take her to the night flower, the other Longnecks refuse to take Littlefoot\u2019s Grandma there due to the risk.\nThough Littlefoot has been warned by the Old One that the Land of Mists has gotten too dangerous, he becomes determined to save his grandfather and asks Ali to take him there. She agrees on the condition that Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike do not come along, claiming that they will only slow them down. As the two of them make their way, they pass through a cave and a sudden earthshake causes various stalagmites and stalactites to crash down, separating them. After Littlefoot\u2019s Grandma tells Cera, Ducky, Petrie and Spike about Littlefoot's Grandpa's illness, Ali returns to the Valley and convinces Littlefoot's friends to help her free him. Meanwhile, Littlefoot tries to find a way out and meets an old male Archelon named Archie, who helps him dig through the rocks. As they work, Littlefoot and Archie are interrupted by a mostly-blind Deinosuchus named Dil and an Ichthyornis named Ichy, who intend to eat them. Dil and Ichy pursue Littlefoot and Archie, but are knocked out when Ali and Littlefoot's friends dig a hole in the rock wall and send rocks tumbling down on them. Archie (who helps Littlefoot and his friends escape Dil and Ichy for the first time) shows Littlefoot and his friends a way to the Land of Mists and reminds them to stay close together before departing. In the Land of Mists, Cera is separated from the group. The others meet a Megazostrodon that Ducky names Tickles because of his fur, which tickles her when she hugs him.\nImmediately after, Tickles helps them find Cera. However, Cera falls into a river and is pursued by Dil and Ichy, who have now recovered from their prior knockout in the cave. Ali saves Cera and distracts the predators, after which Cera finally softens her earlier stance towards Ali. Later, Ali explains her prejudicial behavior, having never interacted with species outside of her own, but remarks that her attitude towards Littlefoot's friends has now changed.

As they make their way home, Ichy and Dil return for one last attack. During a chase, Petrie is grabbed by Ichy but rescued thanks to Tickles, who tricks Ichy into biting Dil's tail rather than Petrie's stomach, giving him time to rejoin his friends. Dil becomes upset at Ichy, but they quickly resume the chase after Cera gives their alternate hiding spot away, during which Ducky falls into a river and becomes unconscious. Spike then speaks for the first time by calling out Ducky's name, which awakens her as she is about to be consumed by Dil. Ichy comes up to Littlefoot and says to him that he and the others are going to be his and Dil's next targets. Ducky escapes when Spike uses his tail to knock Ichy toward Dil's open jaws as she tries to consume Ducky. However, she instead gets Ichy after mistaking him for Ducky. Dil chomps Ichy by accident. Ichy barely escapes that and the two get into another argument. Finally, the two declare that they have had enough of each other and are going their separate ways forever. Immediately after she swats Ichy away with her tail, Dil bumped into a Hydrotherosaurus, who chased her away.\nWith the predators gone for good, Littlefoot and his friends say goodbye to Tickles and head home. They give Littlefoot\u2019s Grandpa the flowers to eat and he fully recovers a few hours later.

At Jack's engagement party, his agent Walter (Jeremy Piven) updates him on all of his upcoming speaking engagements, and the pair hope that one of the engagements is high profile enough to lead to an infomercial.\nAs the party winds down, Jack reads telegrams from well wishers. One of the telegrams is from an attorney in Baltimore about the large estate of his recently deceased father Kirby. Jack's mother shortly admits that she lied about his father passing away when he was born. In truth, she left him because she felt he would be a bad example for Jack.\nThe attorney in Baltimore shows Jack a contract which mentions $35,000. Thinking this is the size of his father's estate, Jack signs the contract. In fact, it is the amount of property damage that the attorney has suffered because of Vera, Kirby's elephant. Vera and Kirby were a traveling circus act, and she is a highly trained elephant. Kirby left a note for Jack that instructed him to call \"Blockhead\" in Kansas City if there are any problems with Vera. Jack contacts Mo (Janeane Garofalo) at the San Diego Zoo, who happens to be transporting a herd of elephants to Sri Lanka in a few days. She helps Jack ascertain that Vera is a breeding age female, and she agrees to pay $30,000 for the elephant.\nJack and Vera board a train bound for San Diego, but the conductor (Keith David) insists on a bribe. Jack's $600 only gets them as far as Kansas City, where he looks up Blockhead, who is an old circus buddy of Kirby's. Blockhead shows Jack the extent of Vera's training, including a photo of Vera standing on her hind legs, which was a trick that she would only do for Kirby. He puts Jack onto an animal trainer in Los Angeles named Terry Bonura (Linda Fiorentino) who works in show business. Terry offers Jack $40,000 for Vera. So, he and Blockhead attempt to drive to L.A., but his truck breaks down. Jack rents a semi-truck and continues on his own. With no experience driving a big rig, Jack blows out the transmission.\nStuck at a truck stop, he encounters Tip Tucker (Matthew McConaughey) who is a fast-talking, deeply paranoid trucker bound for L.A. Jack slips outside to call Tip's mobile phone, and he tricks Tip into thinking his load has been canceled. Tip agrees to take Jack and Vera to L.A. instead. Along the way, Tip makes a phone call and realizes he has been tricked by Jack. He attacks Jack with a tire iron, but Vera intervenes and saves Jack from a beating. Tip drives off threatening to come back with the police.\nJack and Vera walk into New Mexico to evade Tip. They stumble into a monsoon that is threatening to tear apart a village church. As the villagers struggle to hold the walls up, Vera intervenes, holding the wall up with her head. The wall still threatens to collapse, and Jack gets her to stand on her hind legs to brace the wall for good. The villagers help Jack and Vera board a train that will finally take them to L.A.\nAs he is about to sign the contract to sell Vera to Terry, Jack realizes that she subjects her animals to a grueling workload, and he witnesses one of Terry's trainers abusing another elephant with an electric goad. He steals one of Terry's trucks and drives to San Diego. Tip found Terry's business card in the cab of his truck, and he arrives just as Jack leaves.\nAt the San Diego airport, Mo is loading her elephants onto a C-5 Galaxy cargo plane. The tarmac security guard will not let Jack and Vera in because they are not on the manifest. Jack pulls the truck into the passenger drop-off in front of the airport and races through the terminal with Vera. At gate security, Tip finally catches up to them, waving Terry's electric goad. Jack convinces the security guards that Tip is more of a threat than Vera, and they deal with Tip while Jack and Vera catch up to Mo on the tarmac.\nMo explains that she has spent her entire budget and has no money for Vera.

Johnny Carson has hosted The Tonight Show for decades, but he and his audience are both growing older, leaving NBC to anticipate the day when a new host will be needed. Carson's permanent guest host, Jay Leno, and the host of the show that follows Carson's each night, David Letterman, both vie for Carson's job. It is widely assumed that Letterman is the hand-picked heir apparent whom Carson favors, but NBC executives privately speculate that Leno could be more popular with audiences in the 11:30 p.m. (ET/PT) slot, as well as easier for the network to control. They also would not have to deal with Letterman's stipulation for ownership rights to the show.\nLeno's manager, Helen Kushnick, secures the spot for Leno with negotiating tactics that could be construed as either shrewd or unethical. Leno is concerned that her methods might alienate Carson, but does not wish to be disloyal as he believes that she has been responsible for his success; in addition, he had promised to take care of her after her husband's death. Kushnick harshly instructs Leno to just keep telling jokes and leave the business end to her. Surely enough, Kushnick secures the producer's position for herself at The Tonight Show, on the condition that no public announcement will be made. Letterman continues to believe he is still in contention for the position.\nIn the spring of 1991, Carson unexpectedly announces his retirement, effective in one year. NBC executives inform an angry Letterman they have selected Leno to replace Carson. Leno takes over in May 1992, but Kushnick's bullying manner angers his colleagues, potential guests, and others to the point of interfering with network airtime and relationships. NBC executives warn the mild-mannered Leno that they are going to fire Kushnick and, if he sides with her, he will be let go as well. Kushnick is dismissed by NBC and barred from the studio lot. Despite Kushnick's pleas to keep his promise to take care of her and her daughter, Leno is angry because she nearly cost him a dream job. After a heated argument, Leno fires Kushnick and ends their friendship. Later, Leno eavesdrops on an executive meeting in which NBC executives discuss the possibility of replacing him with Letterman.\nLetterman, devastated at being passed over, hires Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz to negotiate on his behalf; Ovitz promises that not only will Letterman be offered an 11:30 p.m. show, he will be offered it by every network. True to Ovitz's word, Letterman is courted by all the major networks and syndicates. He provisionally accepts an offer from CBS that gives him an 11:30 p.m show, but continues to hold on to his lifelong dream of hosting The Tonight Show. Per Letterman's contract with NBC, the network still has several months to either match CBS's offer or present an acceptable counteroffer to keep Letterman. Producer Peter Lassally, close to both Carson and Letterman, finally convinces NBC to offer Letterman the Tonight Show position. However, NBC's offer is substantially weaker than CBS's and would force Letterman to wait until May 1994 to take over the show. Lassally, disappointed at NBC's offer, makes it clear to Letterman that the Tonight Show job is now \"damaged goods\" and Dave would be working with the very people who passed him over and may yet double-cross him. In addition, Lassally warns Letterman that he will be vilified in the press for forcing Leno out.\nTaking Lassally's suggestion, Letterman calls Carson to ask for advice; Carson says he would probably leave NBC if he were in Letterman's position. Letterman rejects NBC's counteroffer and accepts CBS's offer to host his own 11:30 show beginning in the fall of 1993.

Charly realizes that her \"Samantha Caine\" personality was a cover to get near to Daedalus eight years earlier.\nA psychological-operations specialist named Timothy, with whom Charly once had a romantic relationship, kidnaps Caitlin.\nCharly and Mitch learn about Daedalus' involvement in \"Project Honeymoon\", which she disrupted on her mission, resulting in One-Eyed Jack's incarceration; \"Project Honeymoon\" was intended to be a false flag chemical bomb detonation in Niagara Falls, planned by the CIA in an attempt to blame Islamic terrorists and secure more funding.  Charly realizes that Timothy and a new group is plotting to restage the attack, led by CIA Director Leland Perkins.  In Niagara Falls, where Timothy has taken Caitlin, he captures Mitch and Charly.  She tells Timothy that he is Caitlin's biological father and implores him not to hurt their daughter, but Timothy is ultimately unmoved, locking Charly and Caitlin in a freezer to kill them.\nCharly and Caitlin break out of the freezer by detonating barrels of kerosene and then freeing Mitch, who helps Charly attack the staging area.  This forces Timothy to launch the attack early; meanwhile, Caitlin locks herself in a cage on the truck carrying the bomb.  Charly chases the truck, overpowers its driver, diverts it from a Christmas parade, and overturns it on the Niagara Falls International Bridge leading to Canada.\nCharly frees Caitlin but they cannot get away from the bomb, which is about to explode, as Timothy and his agents attack them from a helicopter. Mitch suddenly arrives in a car, picking up Charly and Caitlin and entering Canada just before the bomb explodes, which kills Timothy and his forces and destroys the bridge.\nIn an epilogue, Charly has returned to her assumed identity of Samantha Caine, moving with Caitlin and Hal to a remote farmhouse and declining an offer from the president to join the State Department (which could imply rejoining the CIA).

Kripal Singh is Jaswant's childhood friend and Veeran's fianc\u00e9, and lives close by with his grandfather. Their peaceful lives are disrupted by the Assistant Commissioner of Police Khurana and Inspector Vohra. They are in pursuit of Jimmy, who allegedly attempted to murder Kedar Nath, a member of the Indian Parliament.\nWhen queried, Jaswant pranks the police by leading them to his dog named Jimmy. Angered by his insolence, Khurana and Vohra take Jaswant into custody for questioning. When Jaswant doesn't return home, Kripal struggles to locate him, visiting police stations in the area, but with no success. Jaswant finally returns after 15 days. He is badly injured with bruises all over. Kripal is enraged as Jaswant was subjected to inhumane police brutality for a harmless prank.\nKripal, unable to obtain help by any legal means to fight police brutality, sets off to find his cousin Jeetay, who has ties with militant groups. He fails to locate him but does get to witness Sanathan planting a time-bomb on a bus. Kripal runs into him again at a dhabha (a highway restaurant). He asks a wary Sanathan to listen to his woes. Sanathan agrees to let Kripal travel with him on his truck, being driven by the \"Commander\" and carrying sacks of homemade bombs and two militants. Upon arriving at their hideout, Kripal explains his predicament and finds out that the Commander himself killed Jeetay for being a police informer. Fully aware of Kripal's background, family, and predicament, the Commander rebukes Kripal for coming to them as if they were professional killers. He tells him to kill Khurana himself, and the group would protect him.\nKripal slowly earns the respect of the rest of the group. Sanathan explains that Kripal is not fighting for a nationalist or religious cause. He is fighting for his fundamental civil rights and against a system that victimizes innocents and devalues ordinary people. Later in the story, it is revealed that Sanathan is a survivor of the communal violence during the Partition of India in 1947. Also, he lost most of his family during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. Sanathan claims that it is the ruling class trying to divide society by religion for political gain.\nKripal trains with the group and plots the killing of Khurana. After a year, he assassinates Khurana in a busy marketplace. Before going into hiding, he visits Jaswant and Veeran one final time, both horrified at his deed. When Kripal returns to their hideout, he finds it empty. After staying in hiding, a group member contacts him and signals that he should be ready for travel. He is then taken to the group's new hiding place in Himachal Pradesh by the Commander. The Commander informs Kripal that the police know of his identity in connection to the murder of Khurana, as they could connect the dots from the Jaswant questioning ordeal.\nKripal slowly realizes that there is no return to everyday life and finds solace in the unit's company, which is now preparing for a new mission and awaiting a missile-firing specialist's arrival. When thinking of applying for a local job, Kripal is warned by Sanathan that he is now a big-time terrorist in the eyes of the media and a means of promotion for police officers. One of the group members, Kuldip, narrowly escapes a confrontation with the police while illegally transporting some explosives, sustaining injuries. Terrified by the experience, he pleads to Sanathan to let him go home, promising to emigrate to Canada. Sanathan reluctantly agrees. While the rest of the unit believes Kuldip is heading home, a bomb planted in his backpack explodes and kills him on his way home. Meanwhile, Kripal learns that one of his comrades, Jaimal Singh, is none other than the Jimmy whom the police had been searching.\nSoon afterwards, the missile shooter arrives, and Sanathan introduces Veerendar Kaur. Kripal is shocked to find that Veerendar is his fianc\u00e9e, Veeran. After they finally speak together alone, Kripal is horrified to learn that Jaswant had been taken in for questioning after Khurana's murder. He was beaten viciously and driven to commit suicide in jail. His mother died soon after learning of this tragedy, leaving Veeran alone. After receiving daily visits from Inspector Vohra, Veeran decided to follow in Kripal's footsteps and reunite with him. Kripal and Veeran begin to grow close again.\nVeeran is a welcome addition to the household, bringing the simple joys of ordinary life to the band of outlaws and developing a close friendship with the others, especially Sanathan and Wazir. The mission is revealed to be a plot to assassinate MP Kedar Nath, who had survived Jimmy's assassination attempt, as he arrives for a visit to a local Sikh shrine. During their stay together, Kripal and Veeran decide to get married quietly. Veeran quietly steals the cyanide pill from Kripal that each group member has and is supposed to use if ever caught by police.\nWhile visiting the Sikh shrine to begin surveillance, Kripal spots Inspector Vohra, who is in charge of the security arrangements during Kedar Nath's visit. Kripal tracks Vohra to the house where he is staying but, while attempting to kill him, is caught by Vohra and arrested by police. Meanwhile, one of the group members spots Kripal entering Vohra's residence. Arguing that if Kripal had been loyal, he would have taken the cyanide pill to kill himself, Sanathan concludes that Kripal was a police informer. Sanathan also accuses Veeran of helping Kripal and orders her into house arrest. On the day of the mission, Sanathan orders the group to move and tells Wazir to kill Veeran. However, Veeran breaks free and kills Wazir. In the meantime, Jaimal and Sanathan execute the plot. Jimmy is shot dead while stopping Kedar Nath's motorcade on a bridge. Sanathan, as planned, fires the missile to blow up Kedar Nath's car. On the run, Sanathan finds himself being tracked closely, not by the police but by Veeran herself. Veeran lures him into the depths of wood and shoots him dead.\nVeeran, who has not been exposed as a member of the group, visits Kripal in prison. She hugs Kripal, and while embracing him, she slips Kripal his cyanide pill and departs.

The soldier does not welcome or understand his advances, and, after a lively evening at a disco, criticizes the ambiguous and aggressive behavior of his friend. They leave together in Gianni's car, apparently intending to go back to their barracks, but Gianni drives to a road frequented by transsexuals, many of whom he seems to know well. Saro is not interested in the scene and leaves the car, whereupon he accepts a ride in another car with apparently only the driver on board. But Saro comes back soon after being beaten for trying to defend himself and after being raped by the driver.\nSaro, wounded and distraught, roams around until he is picked up by Gianni, who, after learning that Captain Silvio Roatta, the commander of their battalion, was one of Saro's attackers, brings him to the hospital of their barracks with the intention to hide what happened; but a day later, a doctor tells him that the soldier cannot stay without official permission and therefore is forced to leave. Gianni then takes Saro to the house of his sister, Paola, where she lives with her husband Mario and their two children. The couple want to know why Saro is in such condition, but Saro refuses to explain and only after a violent outburst does he burst into tears and tell the truth.\nGianni reveals that he has jotted down the licence number of the car that Saro got into on the night of the rape and Saro finds that the licence number is correct. Saro and his sister go to a car showroom, where Saro recognizes the driver: it was Vittorio Scarpa, a sex maniac who is heavily in debt and who because of the aforementioned reasons has a difficult and painful relationship with his wife Gabriella and his son Fabrizio. Once recognized, Scarpa is reported to the police and Gianni's captain subpoenas him to appear as a witness.\nScarpa tells Roatta about the trial, but the captain, who is engaged to Laura, the mayor's daughter, not only already knew about the trial, but also knows the identity of the witness. He reassures Scarpa that the sergeant depends on him; in fact, ever since the moment Gianni arrives, he has been exerting pressure on him and blackmailing him into letting Scarpa continue his life, which means bringing transsexuals into a secret room inside the car showroom where he enjoys his secret pleasures, and also into reporting Saro for slander. After the beginning of the trial process, Paola invites Gianni to dinner to ask for an explanation, but Gianni replies that he is not going to testify against his captain and, when he is left alone with Saro after a heated fight, confesses to being raped when he was thirteen years old and asserts that he will not support him in any case.\nThe military tribunal has already started the inquiry process and Captain Antonio Marsili is in charge. He first interrogates Saro, who confirms the accusation but is informed that adding to the accusation of slander, he is also subjected to proceedings for retention and for immoral conduct. Later Gianni is called to support the claim that on the night of the alleged rape, he only saw Saro leaving the barracks; after that the captain asks him if there is a relationship between him and Saro, having once seen them \"joking\" in the barracks. Captain Marsili then informs him of the proceedings that Saro is subjected to; he also summons a carabiniere who is uncertain about the dynamics of the whole incident and tells him that the investigation will still be difficult.\nIn the meantime, things are not going well in the barracks, either: in fact, Saro is provoked by his fellow soldiers, and Gianni defends him by making him aware of the dangers that run inside the military structure. But the younger man obstinately decides not to drop the charge and even spits in the sergeant's face, whereupon Gianni strikes him by breaking his leg. Marsili visits Saro in the hospital, but the soldier refuses to tell him how the incident happened. When everything seems to work in disfavor for Saro, Scarpa's family unexpectedly offer help: at the hearing, Scarpa's wife bursts into tears, postponing her testimony, while his son breaks his father's alibi by revealing that Scarpa is actually homosexual, addicted to alcohol, and has a violent nature, so that the thirteen hospital admissions of his mother that have come to light are now officially attributed to \"domestic incidents\". After the hearing, the attitude of Roatta's fianc\u00e9e, who demands an explanation from him out of suspicion, has also changed, but Roatta punches her with his fist.\nCaptain Roatta, when he is back in the barracks, talks with Gianni and says that he knows Gianni's attack at Saro was merely a way to turn the younger soldier against him. From that moment onwards, he exerts more pressure on the sergeant, withholding freedom from the platoon and forcing the soldiers to undergo back-breaking night-time drills to turn Gianni's comrades against him. After receiving complaints from Corporal Cau, Roatta states that to make things go back to the way they were, problems will have to be \"solved\" among themselves. But after meeting with Scarpa, Roatta informs him that if he is left all alone, he will testify against him.\nMarsili, in the meantime, continues to collide with Gianni over the sergeant's silence on the subject, threatening to put him on trial as well. Gianni continues to deny the accusation, but reveals that two years before, Roatta's driver, the soldier Granelli, went on leave because of neurasthenia. Once the Captain finishes talking with the younger man, he meets Roatta and tells him that he has taken cognizance of the incident, that it was the sergeant who informed him, and that he will do everything possible to expel him from the army, but Roatta is reassured by the mayor that Saro's lawyer, who is also the mayor's friend, has stepped down from the post, and that, also for an electoral motive, he will support him in spite of his daughter's suspicions.\nHowever, the inquiry continues and Marsili, having been convinced of Roatta's guilt by now, employs a lawyer for Saro. At the same time, Gianni is attacked and stabbed in the shower by three masked soldiers and just then the intervention of Marsili, who is drawn to the scene by Gianni's screams, saves him. Once he is sent to the hospital, Gianni tells Marsili how the attack happened and confesses that he has been behaving angrily towards Saro. The Captain listens to his confession and gets what he needs to incriminate the culprits, but specifies that if Gianni confirms everything, he will be removed from the army. The sergeant consents and, when he is left alone with Saro, apologizes and asks for a kiss.\nScarpa, upon his family's denunciation, is arrested for maltreatment, fraud, and for falsification of accounts, having been heavily indebted to the car dealer. The Captain calls for the remission of Roatta from the army, avoiding in this way the rigidity of the military law, but, disappointed in the high esteem that the officer was placed in, he wishes that the civil law will be inflexible. Marsili, praised by the commander, turns down the promotion nevertheless, remembering Roatta's foreign missions and claiming that he does not want to build his career on the destruction of another officer. At the trial, Gianni confesses everything he has previously confided in the Captain, including the activity of male prostitution.

Jonathan attempts to transform his pet cat into a mystical servant, but it becomes demonic and proceeds to attack him. Using the spell from earlier, Jonathan breathes fire and burns the cat alive. By then, Jonathan has aged so severely that his hair is white and receded. Jonathan retrieves the book's rejuvenation spell and proceeds to create the required potion. He takes a sample of Madeline's blood and adds it to the mixture. Jonathan drinks the potion, but the spell backfires: Jonathan regresses into infancy. Madeline happily decides to raise her former husband as her own child.\nIn the second story, which bears a very close resemblance to Stephen King's short story \"The Monkey\", a thief steals a cymbal-banging-monkey toy from Merlin's shop, and sells it to a novelty store, where it is quickly bought as a present for a young boy.

Several key figures of the Rising, including Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh, Tom Clarke and James Connolly, are executed by firing squad. \u00c9amon de Valera is spared execution due to his American citizenship, but is imprisoned alongside Michael Collins and Harry Boland.\nThe 1918 Irish general election results in the victorious Sinn F\u00e9in party unilaterally declaring Irish independence and in so doing beginning the Irish War of Independence. De Valera is elected President and Collins is appointed Director of Intelligence for the emerging IRA. Ned Broy, officially a member of the loyalist G Division sympathises with the independence cause and tips Collins off that the Castle intends to arrest the entire Cabinet that evening. De Valera, sensing that the arrest will spark a world wide outcry, dissuades his cabinet from going into hiding and persuades them to allow their arrests to take place. Collins and Boland evade arrest, though there is no response to the wider action.\nAs the last senior leader still free, Collins begins a counter-intelligence campaign with help from Broy. Numerous assassinations of agents and Irish collaborators are carried out by the IRA's Dublin Brigade. De Valera soon breaks out of Lincoln Prison, but announces on his return to Ireland that he will go to the United States to seek President Woodrow Wilson's official recognition of the Irish Republic. The war continues to intensify; the British assign SIS Officer Soames to counter the Irish Republican Army, though he and several of his agents are killed in an attack orchestrated by Collins. To retaliate, the Black and Tans are sent to Dublin to brutally suppress unarmed citizens in support of an independent Ireland, culminating in a massacre at Croke Park, in which 14 people are murdered during a peaceful Gaelic football game. Broy's assistance to Collins is also discovered by Soames, who subsequently has Broy tortured and killed.\nDe Valera returns from the USA having been unable to secure President Wilson's support. The British hint at direct communication with the Irish, though Collins' guerilla campaign has boded poorly for Ireland's image. De Valera therefore decrees that the Irish Republican Army must fight as a conventional military, though Collins knows that this will just lead to another defeat against the might of the British Empire. Adamant in his approach to securing peace, de Valera orders a siege on The Custom House, but the Irish Republican Army suffers heavy casualties and the attack fails catastrophically. Despite the desperate situation the Irish Republican Army now finds itself in, the British unexpectedly call for a cease to the conflict.\nCollins is sent to London to negotiate Irish interests as part of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which is signed in 1921. Though the Republic of Ireland is not immediately granted independence, the treaty enables Ireland to achieve it over time while remaining a British dominion during the interim as well as losing six of the nine Ulster counties, which will remain under British control. De Valera, who sought unconditional independence for the Republic of Ireland, is furious upon learning of this and he and his supporters, including Boland, resign in protest. The subsequent people's vote backs the terms of the treaty, but de Valera rejects the result and in 1922 leads an attack on the Four Courts in Dublin. The Irish Republican Army, led by Collins, is ordered to recapture it. In the subsequent Battle of Dublin, Boland is murdered.\nDevastated upon learning of his friend's death, Collins journeys to West Cork, where de Valera is in hiding, to mediate peace. Collins, however, is misdirected by de Valera's associates and is led into an ambush in which he is shot and killed.

Campbell, Jr. writes a memoir about his career in Nazi Germany. During the buildup to World War II, Campbell, an American playwright of German language stage productions, is approached by War Department operative Frank Wirtanen. Wirtanen asks Campbell to work as a spy for the U.S. in the approaching war, though he promises no reward or recognition. Campbell rejects the offer, but Wirtanen adds that he wants Campbell to take some time to consider, telling him that Campbell's answer will come in the form of how he acts and what positions he assumes once the war begins.\nIn the initial stages of the war, Campbell works his way up through Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry, eventually becoming the \"voice\" of English language broadcasts propagating Nazism and anti-Semitism at American citizens (a parallel to the real broadcaster, Dr. Edward Vieth Sittler).  Unknown to the Nazis, all of the idiosyncrasies of his speech \u2013 deliberate pauses, coughing, etc. \u2013 form a secret code that covertly transmits information to Allied intelligence agencies. Late in the war, after his wife, Helga, is reportedly killed on the Eastern Front, Campbell visits her family in early 1945 outside Berlin, just before the Red Army arrives. Helga's younger sister, Resi, confesses that she is in love with him.\nEventually, Campbell is captured when an American infantryman recognizes his voice. Before he can be executed, Wirtanen arranges for Campbell's discreet release and helps his relocation to New York City.  Campbell is shocked to learn that the American government will not reveal Campbell's true role in the war, because that would also reveal the spycraft techniques that America may continue to need for the next war.  Although that means that Campbell is doomed to be a pariah, Wirtanen is unsympathetic, reasoning that Campbell would not have wanted the truth known had Germany won the war.\nIn New York City, Campbell lives a lonely existence for fifteen years, sustained only by memories of Helga and an indifferent curiosity about his eventual fate. Mrs. Epstein, a Holocaust survivor living in Campbell's building, is the only person who suspects his true identity; he seems to avoid her suspicions by feigning ignorance of German. Campbell's only friend is George Kraft, an elderly painter who, through an extraordinary coincidence, happens to be a Soviet intelligence agent.\nOver many games of chess, Campbell reveals his secret past to Kraft, who tries to use this information to improve his standing with his handlers by forcing Campbell into a position where he must flee to Moscow. He leaks information about Campbell's whereabouts, which gets the attention of a neo-Nazi organization. Representatives of this group meet Campbell and present him with a woman who seems to be Helga. However, it is not long before Campbell discovers that Helga is actually Resi, who had taken Helga's identity to escape from East Germany.\nThe neo-Nazis shelter Campbell, along with Kraft and Resi, in their Manhattan hideout. Wirtanen reappears, warning Campbell of Kraft's true identity and explaining that Kraft and Resi have put Campbell in an awkward position with the neo-Nazis to ensure his transfer to Moscow. Campbell returns to the hideout to confront the pair; in light of her exposure, Resi commits suicide. Moments later, the FBI raids the hideout but, again, Wirtanen uses his influence to ensure Campbell walks free. Upon his release, he freezes in the middle of a footpath having lost all meaning to his life, until a police officer finally tells him to move along. Campbell returns to his wrecked apartment and decides to turn himself in to the Israelis to stand trial.\nCampbell is taken to Haifa, where he is incarcerated in the cell below an unrepentant Adolf Eichmann. The film ends with the arrival of a letter from Wirtanen providing the corroborating evidence that Campbell was indeed a U.S. spy during the war.

While he and his wife Laura are at a restaurant for dinner, he sees Two on his own date (as he cannot be with Laura). Doug begins to worry about his clone being revealed.\nDespite the complications of having a clone, Lance is extremely busy at work, so Doug has another made to help out at home. \"Three\", who calls himself \"Rico\", is an exaggeration of Doug's feminine side.

Thinking Doug is ignoring her, she reveals her feelings to Lenny, mentioning how Doug has never kept his promise to fix up the house. When she asks him what he wants, an inattentive Lenny replies, \"I want pizza\". Upset, she takes the children and moves back to her parents' home.

On a tip from an informant, they venture into an apartment block where Washington is reported to be hiding. After Casey shoots the lock, Washington fires a submachine gun through his front door, seriously wounding Casey. Police backup units arrive and swarm the building, but Washington executes a cunning escape in an NYPD squad car after killing two cops. In a surprising move, District Attorney Morganstern (Ron Leibman) appoints Casey's son Sean (Andy Garc\u00eda), an ex-cop and recently appointed ADA, to prosecute Washington when he is caught. In the process, he passes over the more experienced ADA Elihu Harrison (Colm Feore), who plans to oppose him in an upcoming judicial election.\nAt Washington's trial, his defense attorney Sam Vigoda (Richard Dreyfuss) does not dispute his client's responsibility for killing the cops but argues that the police were intending to murder Washington. Washington claims that he had been bribing a group of corrupt cops, led by Kurt Kleinhoff, in return for protection while dealing drugs; Vigoda argues that Washington became a target when he refused to match an offer by a rival dealer, Carlos Alvarez, to give the cops more money. Although inexperienced, Sean mounts a strong argument questioning Washington's credibility and wins the case. Washington is sentenced to consecutive life terms without parole. A member of Vigoda's legal team, Peggy Lindstrom (Lena Olin), begins an affair with Sean after the conclusion of the trial. In private, Vigoda discloses to Sean why he undertook Washington's defense: after his 15-year-old daughter died from a drug overdose, Vigoda has been determined to bring down the system of corrupt police enabling the operations of drug-dealers.\nAfter Morganstern suffers a severe heart attack and is unable to run for re-election, Sean is asked to run for D.A. in his place. Sean wins the election over Harrison. Meanwhile, when Kleinhoff's decomposed body is discovered floating in the river, his address book reveals the names of several officers from precincts who responded to the Washington shooting. A number of officers confess their entanglement in the bribery and narcotics scandal. Sean confronts Allegretto, who admits that he took bribes while also colluding to murder Washington with fellow corrupted officers. Allegretto later commits suicide after being confronted by Sean. Casey later discloses to Sean that he forged a judge's signature on Washington's arrest warrant-the original had expired on the day of the raid. Sean asks Morganstern, who is recovering at the hospital, for advice on how to deal with the scandal. Morganstern tells Sean that being D.A. will be a tough job, but he believes Sean \"will be better at it than most\".Following a voluntary admission of guilt by Casey about the forgery in a private consultation with Judge Dominick Impelliteri (Dominic Chianese), the judge decides to fill out a new warrant back-dated to the day of the raid which purposely obviates the technicality. He also suggests to Sean that he destroy the original ,forged warrant. Sean tells Vigoda that he plans to resign as D.A., but Vigoda urges him not to quit.

Bob Iverson, a storm chaser with the Kansas State Tornado Center relaying information to the National Weather Service on a chase assignment, is driving down a country road to track a bizarre supercell thunderstorm. While observing the storm, Bob spots a tornado touching down almost a mile south of his location; he warns a family living nearby, right as the family's daughter Sarah, arrives home from school, about the oncoming twister, which sends them running into their root cellar just before it destroys their farm.\nMeanwhile, in Blainsworth, Nebraska (120 miles southwest of Dannebrog), aspiring teenage artist Dan Hatch, who is constantly being pushed by his stepfather, Jack, to be an athlete, participates in a bicycle race and damages his bike; Jack pushes Danny into finishing the race on his bum bike, where he falls behind the other racers. Much to his luck, he wins a new bike in a raffle held by a local bank. While trying out his new bike, Dan and his best friend Arthur Darlington run into Arthur's two sisters, Stacey (whom Dan is infatuated with) and Ronnie Vae, while at the park. Dan and Arthur arrive home as the former's mother Laura is preparing dinner, when she also asks Dan to tend to his baby half-brother, Ryan. Later, Laura's sister, Dan's aunt Jenny, calls to inform her that they have been assigned to fill-in shifts as waitresses at the Salty Dawg, the local diner where they both work. Because Jack will not have enough time to take Laura to work, Jenny volunteers to take her.\nAt 3:37 p.m., while continuing to track the severe weather creeping toward the town, Bob decides to head southwest into Blainsworth, as Stan, the meteorologist Bob is radioing to, is astonished at the rogue anticyclonic spring-like weather pattern for the fall; while there, Bob meets Laura while getting some coffee at the diner. That evening, when Jack arrives home and sits down to watch TV, the show he is watching is interrupted by a KHAS-12 weather update, reporting a tornado 14 miles northwest of Blainsworth, and a tornado warning has been issued for St. Paul, Dannebrog and rural Howard County, Nebraska. Soon after Jack leaves to check on his mother, Dan's grandmother Belle, who was asleep in her rocking chair when he phoned her, tornado sirens suddenly blare throughout town, only to cut off abruptly as Dan goes to get Ryan from his crib. The eerie stillness outside afterward suddenly gives way to a violent tornado that approaches Blainsworth's Capital Heights neighborhood, with the sucking noises emitting from the drains notifying Dan and Arthur of its pending arrival; they and Ryan take cover in the basement bathroom's shower tub as the twister starts to obliterate the Hatch residence.\nAfter Dan and Arthur escape from the basement of the leveled house through the collapsing floor beams from the first floor, and look in awe of the rubble that was once the Hatches' home, Arthur runs into Stacey and Ronnie Vae, who both survived the twister themselves in the Darlington's home (their parents were out of town on a trip back home to California at the time the storm hit). As Dan struggles to find his own family, Laura and Jenny are trapped inside the Salty Dawg (as they were taking cover inside, due to Jenny's 1992 Buick Skylark malfunctioning when she went to pick up Laura), which also was destroyed by one of the tornadoes. Dan and Stacey then go save Belle, at her farm; the two teenagers find Belle underneath wooden boards blown onto her from off of the partially damaged barn near her house (which itself survived intact).\nAs Dan and Stacey rush in the car to get Belle treated for her injuries, Dan finds Jack on a closed road, with his truck \u2013 which was overturned by the tornado, pinning him underneath it \u2013 covered in fallen power lines; he pulls Jack out from under the truck (with the help of emergency crews, after an earlier attempt by Dan and Stacey to push the truck in order to free him nearly injures Jack further), seeing this as an opportunity for his father to finally see him as reliable. However, Jack just gives a simple thank-you to the fact that Dan saved him from multiple dangers, even though his stepson may have been the only one down the road who was able to help him as it was blocked by policemen due to it being blocked by the downed lines, debris and broken underground utility lines. Later that night at the shelter, Dan reveals to Stacey that Jack is only his stepfather and that his real father, Daniel Sr., was a pilot who was killed in a plane crash when Dan was 6. After telling her that he feels he is not good enough in Jack's eyes and talks about the good qualities that his stepfather has, Stacey helps Dan consider that the two could try to find some common ground.\nEventually, Jack, followed by Dan, who sneaks himself and Ryan into the Jeep Wagoneer loaned to Jack, leave the shelter to go and look for Laura. Just as Bob pulls his truck into the driveway of the destroyed house, helping passengers Jenny and Laura along with him searching for Jack, Dan and Ryan, Jack's Jeep also drives up and the family is reunited. As soon as everyone is relieved they survived the storm, three tornadoes touch down near them. Bob, realizing that there is no adequate shelter available, advises the group to make a run for it in their vehicles. The group narrowly escapes one of the twisters, which picks up a car that the Hatches' neighbors try to outrun the tornado in themselves, destroys several buildings in its path and hurls a tree branch into the windshield, briefly knocking Jack unconscious and prompting Dan to take over driving the vehicle out of the storm's path. They, along with Bob and Jenny, make it to an overpass as the twister blows out the back window of the Jeep, nearly sucking Dan out before it dissipates into the air. As they walk out from under the overpass just as the sun rises on a clear day after the storm passes, Jack admits he's proud of Danny for not giving up in the face of adversity and trying to reunite the family.\nIn the film's epilogue, illustrating what happened with the characters one year after the storm, Dan explains that he is now dating Stacey, while Arthur became class president, Bob and Jenny got married and are becoming first-time parents to twins, Dan and Jack have also become closer, Jack is now supportive of him, and also taking up some new hobbies after his sporting goods shop was destroyed by the storm, and also Belle died in 1997.", "tmdb_plot": "A coming-of-age story, adapted from Irv Ruckman's 1984 novel, about a teenager who bonds with his stepfather while the Blainsworth, Nebraska farm family battles a series of killer twisters.", "tmdb_id": "34138", "wiki_id": "10842896"}, {"title": "Nightjohn", "genres": ["Drama", "TV Movie"], "wiki_plot": "Sarny, a girl, is born in a slave cabin. Her master Clel Waller is angry, saying that a boy would've been worth more. However, he doesn't sell her, as a promise has been made, so her mother is sold after a few years instead. Sarny is taken care by Delie, another slave.\nWhen Sarny grows to about pre-teenage years, she starts working at the Big House, taking care of Homer, the master's son who is not potty-trained yet. Back at the cabins, Outlaw tries to get Delie to convince Mr. Waller to give him a pass so he can marry a girl named Egypt from another plantation. Delie is preparing a dress for Sarny so she can go to work at the master's house.\nAfter a Sunday church service in which slaves and masters attend, the Wallers have guests over for lunch, among them a doctor who later has a romance with Callie, Clel's wife who, during the luncheon, talks about Outlaw wanting to court Egypt, owned by Clel's brother. Clel shuts her down stating that if they were to have a baby, it would give money to the wife's plantation instead of his. Callie asks why things cannot just be about love. Upset about Clel's decision, Sarny accidentally drops the plate of food, and is punished when Clel forces Callie to slap the girl. That night Delie tells Sarny to behave, otherwise she will have to do the hard labor out in the fields. Sarny is upset, vowing revenge on the Wallers.\nThe next day, Callie tells Sarny to take a letter to the doctor's place. On the way, she sees a slave trader, Tom, herding black slaves toward the Waller household. At the doctor's house, the doctor asks Sarny to take a love letter to Callie, keeping it a secret from Clel. He then gives Sarny a penny for her troubles. Back at the plantation, Tom is willing to sell a slave to Clel for 500 dollars. Clel then questions Tom about why he is willing to sell a slave worth $3000 for only $500. Clel then asks the slave to take off his shirt, revealing many scars from being whipped. Clel says that instead, he will buy the man, John, off of Tom for only 50 dollars without clothes.\nThat night, John and Sarny strike a deal, willing to trade tobacco for lessons on reading. John tells Sarny about the risks, but Sarny accepts as she wants to be free. Sarny learns the letter \u2018A\u2019. She then starts to read the letter \u2018A\u2019 in the letters between the doctor and Callie that she delivers.\nThe next morning, Outlaw is being punished because he snuck out the previous night to see Egypt. As Mr. Waller is about to whip Outlaw, Jeffrey, Clel's son, asks him to stop because they are friends. Clel say to Jeffrey that the slaves were made to pick his cotton instead of being his friend, and Outlaw is whipped. In Sarny's narration of the story, she states that Clel watched everyone instead of the one person he needed to watch, the mistress, his wife.\nThat night when the Wallers are having a party, Delie walks in on John teaching Sarny the alphabet and is outraged. She questions John about the scars on his back, and he says that they were because he had tried to run away twice. The third time, however, he successfully got away to the North but ended up coming back in order to teach slaves how to read. Delie prohibits John from teaching Sarny to read for her safety. Sarny stalks away, stating that she will teach herself to read. John agrees but says that Delie is teaching Sarny something worse: to be afraid.\nSarny later comes up with a plan for Callie to visit the Doctor secretly, offering to potty-train Homer and swipes his alphabet blocks. This angers a slave, Old Man who had had a finger chopped off after he had learned to read. John shouts out that words are freedom, that the white folks keep words to themselves and that if the slaves had words, they would be free.  Later that night, John writes Sarny's name in the dirt saying that the letters meant herself.\nThe next day, Clel recruits everyone in his family to help with picking cotton from the fields, promising a feast to everyone if they are successful with the crop. Later that day when John lovingly teaches Sarny numbers, Delie agrees to learn as well. Sarny reads the bible and is baptized.\nIt is revealed Sarny had stolen a bible that Jeffrey, the master's other son was supposed to take care of which gets him in trouble from his father. She discovers that she had been lied to and that God was on the slave's side. As Sarny begins to read more and more, the rest of the slaves reject it and tell her to stop. She begins to read a story in the Gazette newspaper about a slave insurrection (Nat Turner's and his army of slaves), capturing the other slaves\u2019 attention. Sarny then tricks Homer into playing hide and seek so she can go back and read Clel's record book. The Waller plantation had a good crop of cotton this year and as promised, Clel throws a feast. The slaves use this opportunity to let Outlaw and Egypt get married.\nIt is discovered later that Egypt is pregnant and is forced to run away. John forges Clel's signature for Outlaw and his wife so they can escape. Jeffrey discovers the stolen bible, and Delie takes the blame. Clel tries to figure out who had taken the bible because he knows that Delie did not know how to read. With no one confessing, Jeffrey whips Delie once. As he tries to continue, he is stopped by John who says that he was the one who took it. This results in Clel chopping off John's fingers as punishment. When asked if he had learned his lesson, John writes letters in the dirt. Jeffrey tells the overseer to take John to be sold before his father can shoot him.  As he is leaving, John tells Sarny \"when you lose one hand, the other gets stronger\", meaning that she must forge the other note and teach other slaves how to read. John had written his name in the dirt. Sarny is then seen forging the second note for Outlaw and telling them to name their baby John if it was a boy.\nThe next morning, Sarny tells the doctor she can no longer keep his secret. Clel interrupts the service saying that he has found two notes written and signed with his name in two different handwritings, meaning that another slave knows to write and threatens to shoot all of them. Sarny objects, saying that Clel would not shoot them because they are his only wealth. She tells Clel that she is worth the most to him because of what she knows. Callie, fearing this, ask Clel to just shoot her. The doctor intervenes, lying that he taught Egypt how to read simple things.

Stacy is upset that her mother, Laura, is dating a man named Rod who treats her very badly, and often urges her to leave him and treat herself better.\nAfter a few weeks of dating, Bobby starts showing possessive behavior. He is jealous whenever another guy approaches or talks about Stacy, and does not want her to hang out with anyone when they are together. At first, she does not suspect that there is anything wrong, because he immediately apologizes after getting mad at her, tells her that he loves her, and gives her gifts to show his remorse.\nStacy soon promises Bobby that they will be together forever.

Laura and Nicki grieve together. A court trial soon follows with the district attorney asking everyone if they ever saw Bobby hit Stacy. Carla says she did, but that it was because Stacy wouldn't listen to him. Donna and other classmates also admit that they witnessed the abuse, but figured she would leave him eventually.\nVal, Vince, Nicki, and Tony expose the abusive ways that Bobby treated Stacy, with Nicki saying how she desperately wanted to oust him, but was afraid of losing Stacy's friendship if she were to say what he was doing to her. He is eventually found guilty and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge tells the witnesses to tell someone next time they see a friend being abused instead of standing by and doing nothing, implying how it could have saved Stacy's life.\nLater, a distraught Nicki cleans out Stacy's locker and cries as she looks at the pictures of them, remembering their friendship and guiltily wishing that she had acted sooner to have saved her.

However, when McLennon and his men locate Santeek's cabin hideout and shoot at it indiscriminately, Sarah pleas for her husband not to kill her abductor. McLennon notices that she is wearing a shirt made of animal skin that Santeek had given to her earlier to keep her warm. He erroneously assumes that she betrayed him and had an affair with Santeek.

By chance, while Abel is being disciplined for spilling lamp oil on the chapel floor, his friend Nestor accidentally sets fire to the building, burning it down as he wished. From that day on, Abel is convinced that fate is on his side, and that it will protect him from anything.\nIn 1940, Abel works as a car mechanic in Paris. His hobby is photography, and he befriends and photographs the local children. However, on one occasion a girl named Martine takes his camera; he tells her off and upsets her. She then falsely accuses him of assaulting her. The police believe her, and he is put on trial. Fortunately for Abel, Germany has invaded France, and soldiers are urgently needed on the front. As a punishment for his supposed crime, he is conscripted to the army to fight off the invaders.\nAfter France surrenders, Abel and his comrades are sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in East Prussia. Abel is often able to sneak away from the camp to a hunting cabin in the forest where he feeds a blind moose. One day, he encounters a German officer  who is curious about his affinity for animals and tells him that the moose is known as The Ogre to the local peasants before telling him to return to the camp and to stop visiting the cabin. \nSeveral weeks later, the officer returns to Abel, and removes him from the camp. He takes him to Hermann G\u00f6ring's hunting lodge where the Chief Forester gives him a job looking after the animals on the estate. \nWhen G\u00f6ring (Spengler) arrives, he first seems cheerful and friendly, but it is soon clear that he is sadistic, bombastic and mentally unstable. After hearing news that he is needed in Berlin because of the failure of the German Army at Stalingrad on the Eastern Front, G\u00f6ring becomes depressed and bitter, and abruptly fires his whole staff at the lodge - including Abel.

Several days later, one of the boys he recruited is left horribly burned during training from standing behind another boy as he fires a Panzerfaust, making Abel yet more uncertain of the Nazis. Soon after, the owner of the academy, Count Kaltenborn (Mueller-Stahl), is revealed to have been part of a plot to kill Hitler. He is arrested and taken away in a car, and is never seen again. Meanwhile, news has broken out that the Red Army has crossed into East Prussia, and the officers in charge of the castle, as well as the oldest boys training there, are sent out to the front line.\nOne night while out riding, Abel finds a column of prisoners being taken through the forest, and sees one being shot by a German soldier. When they have gone he approaches the road and finds that it is littered with dead bodies.

Kenny humiliates the Rebel by winning and taking the gambled winnings as his own. After he leaves, Spyro, the current co-leader of the Rebels (opposite Damien) is under the impression that Kenny's skills are something more than \"something he picked up.\" He instructs his lieutenant, Kayo, to exact retribution on Kenny for being hustled.\nWhile Kenny and his friend Marcus are relaxing at a diner, Kenny decides to call his girlfriend. He enters a phone booth to make the call but is subsequently shot and killed by Kayo in a drive-by shooting.

Kayo and the Rebels then proceed to confront Marvin about his assistance to the investigators of Kenny's death. Marvin argues that Kenny was a good person and did not deserve to be shot.

A year later, Anna Morse has just left her abusive husband, Jimmy, and moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico with her three daughters to make a fresh start and establish a career, despite the disapproval of her mother, Ellen. Once there, she makes the acquaintance of Garrett and Donna, who happen to be her neighbors and soon take an interest in Anna's children.\nDetermined to make the girls their own, the couple begins scheming for ways to snatch Anna's girls away from her; at one point, Garrett and Donna offer to give her a vacation to Mexico that they had won and look after the kids, but Anna declines. One day, while all of them are enjoying a picnic in a neighborhood park, Garrett offers to treat the kids to a ride on a miniature train, and as Anna is purchasing tickets on the other side of the park, Garrett suddenly remembers having left a dessert at the house, and asks the girls to go with him back to the house to retrieve it. Oldest and youngest girls Billie and Sally agree, but Anna's middle daughter Laura elects to remain at the park. Upon Anna's return, she finds two of her girls gone, and unsuccessfully attempts to find them.\nAnna shows up at the police station with Laura, but is angry over being treated as a suspect in her girls' disappearance, and storms out prematurely. However, Lt. Jack Dekker does some digging into the background of Anna's neighbors, and shows up at her house the next day to reveal that Garrett and Donna have a history of breaking the law, as well as the matter of what happened to their daughter. This time, Anna agrees to take a polygraph, which she passes with flying colors and convinces Lt. Dekker that the couple were indeed responsible for kidnapping Anna's children. Beginning to suspect Garrett and Donna may well have crossed state lines by now, he suggests that the FBI become involved.\nEllen tells Anna that she should take temporary custody of Laura while she attempts to find her other girls, and warns her daughter that if she doesn't get her life together, she won't be able to make that happen. Initially disagreeing, Anna comes to realize she needs to change how she lives, and agrees to relinquish Laura to her mother until the search is over.\nHaving driven to a cabin they own in Michigan, Garrett tells Billie that in a fit of rage, Anna struck Laura for misbehaving, causing her to fall down a flight of stairs and breaking her neck, which supposedly killed her and resulted in Anna being sent to jail. He then says that if the girls return to New Mexico, they will be placed in foster care, but promises that he and Donna will take care of the girls and make them happy.\nIn the meantime, Anna has managed to land a job as a waitress in her mother's restaurant, but is evicted from her house after not paying rent for two months, and winds up sleeping on a park bench. Not long after, Garrett, Donna and the girls (who are now referring to the couple as \"Mom\" and \"Dad\") relocate to Tennessee, where Billie and Sally get their hair cut and dyed and are renamed \"Rachel\" and \"Diane\", respectively.\nContinuing the investigation, Lt. Dekker and Anna visit a trailer park where Garrett and Donna once lived, and are informed by their former neighbor that Garrett was known to be both verbally and physically abusive toward his wife and daughter, which scares Anna, who had thought that the couple would at least treat her daughters well. The following day, while sleeping on her bench, she is spotted by her co-worker Roz, who is on a morning run through the park and generously offers to let Anna stay with her until she gets on her feet.\nWhile working at a grocery store, Donna spots pictures of Billie and Sally on a milk carton, which triggers a flashback to a confrontation Megan had with Garrett, calling him out for his thievery and refusing to move again. Realizing her husband may well have killed their daughter by pushing her off the mountain, she becomes fearful for the girls' safety.\nOne night, while watching TV, Anna comes across a vintage rockabilly performance, which generates a brainstorm. She leaves a message for Lt. Dekker, and when he arrives in the morning, Anna explains that Garrett is a huge fan of oldies music, and that he and Donna would often drive around the Southwest to find clubs that specialized in rock-and-roll revival shows. Thus, she reasons, they should circulate his poster to clubs of that nature across the country. In the meantime, Anna has amassed enough money to find a new home (a converted barn) for herself and Roz, who toasts the occasion and expresses hope that the girls will soon be found.\nA short time later, one of the teachers at Billie's school in Pueblo, Colorado contacts Anna after recognizing her daughter from the \"MISSING\" poster, but by the time Anna gets there, the couple has already left town with the girls and relocated to Denver; by now, Donna has acknowledged that what they're doing is wrong, and secretly contacts Anna offering to return the girls, but specifies that no police be present. Despite Lt. Dekker's objections, Anna promises to keep the situation under control and not destroy their investigation.\nWhile stopping into a club to by tickets for another oldies show, Garrett is recognized from his \"WANTED\" poster by the clerk, who gets shot to death before he can take any action. Following the murder, Garrett then heads to a sporting goods store to purchase sleeping bags, some rope, and a hunting knife. Meanwhile, Donna arranges to meet Anna at a local coffee shop (where, for the first time, she admits that it was Garrett who killed Megan, as well as being terrified of her husband), then take her to their house to get her girls back.\nHowever, Garrett gets home first, and after Sally spills the beans about the plans, Garrett puts the girls in the station wagon and tears out only seconds after Donna and Anna pull up. Wanting to see her mom, Billie attempts to grab the steering wheel, causing Garrett to lose control of the car and causing a minor accident. At this point, Sally runs free, but Garrett grabs Billie and prepares to strangle her. Only seconds before he can do so, however, he is arrested at gunpoint by Lt. Dekker, who has been watching the scene unfold from a distance.\nWhile Sally is happy to be reunited with her mother, Billie is angry over Anna allegedly killing Laura, but Anna tells her that Garrett lied to her, and Laura is safe and sound.

Twenty years later, Flynt and his younger brother, Jimmy, run the Hustler Go-Go club in Cincinnati. With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first Hustler magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. After Hustler publishes nude pictures of former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis in 1972, sales take off.\nFlynt becomes smitten with Althea Leasure, a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of Hustler. With his success comes enemies \u2013 as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, saying that \"murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it, you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize. However, sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail.\" He becomes involved in several prominent court cases, and befriends a young lawyer, Alan Isaacman. In 1975, Flynt loses a smut-peddling court decision in Cincinnati, but the decision is overturned on appeal; he is released from jail soon afterwards. Ruth Carter Stapleton, a Christian activist and sister of President Jimmy Carter, seeks out Flynt and urges him to give his life to Jesus. Flynt seems moved and starts letting his newfound religion influence everything in his life, including Hustler content. Althea detests the idea as she was molested by nuns during her years in Catholic School.\nIn 1978, during another trial in Georgia, Flynt and Isaacman are both shot by a man with a rifle while they walk outside a courthouse. Isaacman recovers, but Flynt is paralyzed from the waist down and uses a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Wishing he was dead, Flynt renounces his faith. Because of the emotional and physical pain, he moves to Beverly Hills and spirals down into depression and drug use. During this time, Althea also becomes addicted to painkillers and morphine.\nIn 1983, Flynt undergoes surgery to deaden several nerves in his back damaged by the bullet wounds, and as a result, feels rejuvenated. He returns to an active role with the publication, which, in his absence, had been run by Althea and Jimmy. Flynt is soon in court again for leaking videos relating to the John DeLorean entrapment case, and during his courtroom antics, he fires Isaacman, then throws an orange at the judge. He later wears an American flag as an adult diaper along with an Army helmet, and wears T-shirts with provocative messages such as \"I Wish I Was Black\" and \"Fuck This Court.\" After spitting water at the judge Flynt is sent to a psychiatric ward, where he sinks into depression again. Flynt publishes a satirical parody ad in which Jerry Falwell tells of a drunken sexual encounter with his mother. Falwell sues for libel and emotional distress. Flynt countersues for copyright infringement, because Falwell copied his ad and used it to raise funds for his legal bills. The case goes to trial in December 1984, but the decision is mixed, as Flynt is found guilty of inflicting emotional distress but not libel. By that time, Althea has contracted HIV, which proceeds to AIDS. Some time later in 1987, Flynt finds her dead in the bathtub, having drowned.\nFlynt presses Isaacman to appeal the Falwell decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. Isaacman refuses, saying Flynt's courtroom antics humiliated him. Flynt pleads with him, saying that he \"wants to be remembered for something meaningful\". Isaacman agrees and argues the \"emotional distress\" decision in front of the Supreme Court, in the case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell in 1988.

The tunnel is being opened by the visiting top local Bosnian communist dignitary D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107 as the newsreel's voiceover is extolling the quality of tunnel's masonry in hyperbolically glowing terms, gushing about the completed infrastructure project representing a key development for the area's economic progress. During the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Bijedi\u0107 (or \"Comrade D\u017eemo\" as he's referred to in the newsreel) accidentally cuts his thumb with the scissors.\nCut to 1980, not even a decade after its opening, the tunnel has already fallen in disrepair as two local village kids Milan and Halil are playing in its vicinity although they don't dare go inside it because\u2014as they fearfully repeat a local tall tale to one another while staring into the dilapidated structure\u2014\"drekavac (an ogre from Slavic mythology) is sleeping inside and if he wakes up he'll kill everyone in the village and burn down their homes\".\nCut forward to spring 1992, as sporadic violent incidents that would eventually spiral into an all-out war are taking place throughout Bosnia, Milan (Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107), a Serb, and his best friend Halil (Nikola Pejakovi\u0107), a Muslim Bosniak, both in their late teens, are still in their ethnically-mixed village in eastern Bosnia, playing one-on-one basketball on a makeshift hoop in front of a kafana owned by another Serb villager Slobo (Petar Bo\u017eovi\u0107). Although the two friends are still very warm and affable with one another, the talk of war is in the air and a degree of tension along ethnoreligious lines is felt, indicating mutual mistrust and apprehension among their respective ethnic groups. As Milan and Halil are taking a break from playing ball while having a drink in front of Slobo's kafana, Halil and Slobo engage in a testy conversation the starting point of which is news coming out of Sarajevo about a Muslim attacking a Serb wedding procession and killing the groom's father. Rather than commenting on the tragic event directly, Halil focuses on the circumstance that Slobo was informed of this hate crime via reading a Serbian daily newspaper, Ve\u010dernje novosti, before implicitly dismissing the paper as Serb propaganda and cynically suggesting to Slobo that he should instead be reading Oslobo\u0111enje, a Bosnian daily that Slobo in turn dismisses as Muslim propaganda in his sarcastic retort. Furthermore, Nazim, a Muslim neighbour of Slobo's, rolls up in a car and trailer with his family and many of their personal belongings in tow, asking Slobo to look after his house while he's away \"visiting his sister in Tuzla\". Halil makes a snide comment, suggesting Nazim's fleeing the coming war rather than simply visiting relatives, which Nazim denies unconvincingly.\nAnother cut to a few years later, a wounded Milan is shown in a hospital bed at the Military Medical Academy (VMA) in Belgrade, where he taunts a wounded young POW Muslim soldier in the neighbouring room, whom he threatens to kill if his friend in the next bed dies.\nIn 1994, during the conflict, Milan joins the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS) and is attached to a squad that includes:\n\nVelja (Nikola Kojo): a career criminal from Belgrade who had been committing most of his break-ins and burglaries abroad in West Germany. The way he ended up in war is purely coincidental. During a brief visit home, the authorities showed up at the door to conscript his younger brother, a promising university student. Knowing full well his brother would have likely been taken to the front lines for draft-dodging, Velja decides on the spot to pretend to be his brother thus becoming a soldier in his place.\nPetar \"Professor\" (Dragan Maksimovi\u0107): a Bosnian Serb school teacher from Banja Luka holding nostalgic feelings towards SFR Yugoslavia. While some of the others loot houses, he is more interested in literature and intermittently reads from a burnt diary he found in one of the villages the squad passed through.\nBrzi \"Speedy\" (Zoran Cvijanovi\u0107): a heroin addict from Belgrade, son of a Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) colonel and the only one in the group who speaks English. While high on drugs one night, he walked to a highway overpass in Belgrade where the people have gathered to cheer on the troops going to war, jumping off only to land in a JNA truck headed towards the Croatian border. It is left ambiguous whether the jump was a suicide attempt. Brzi was given an ambulance truck to drive and he now sees his involvement in the war as an attempt to get himself off drugs.\nLaza (Dragan Petrovi\u0107): a simple-minded and impressionable family man with traditional values from a village in Central Serbia. Laza was so outraged by a Serbian TV news report about atrocities against Serbs that he walked to the nearest highway and hitchhiked to Belgrade to volunteer for combat. On the way there, he vents his anger to the truck driver that picked him up, telling him proudly and defiantly that \"never again shall a German or Turk [be allowed to] set foot here\" (referencing past Nazi and Ottoman occupations of Serbia, respectively), blissfully unaware that the person behind the wheel is a Turkish trucker driving through Serbia.\nVilju\u0161ka \"Fork\" (Milorad Mandi\u0107): a cheerful and jovial Chetnik sympathizer villager from Central Serbia whose only motive for fighting was looking out for his brother-in-law Laza. He is nicknamed Fork because he carries a fork around his neck symbolizing Serbian sophistication in the 14th century, and contrasts Serbian kings to English and German kings at the time, who he says ate using their hands.\nCaptain Gvozden (Bata \u017divojinovi\u0107): the squad's commander and a professionally trained Yugoslav People's Army officer. Although fighting for the Serbian side, in his heart he still believes in Yugoslavia and its ideals. In 1980, after the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, Gvozden made the national news when he had run a 350-kilometer marathon alone across the country to attend Tito's funeral.\nMarko (Marko Kovijani\u0107): a young man who is often foolishly and desperately seeking the approval of his older colleagues. He is shown to be very fond of foreign culture; he drew a graffiti of a Serb three-finger salute with the caption saying \"Srbija do Tokija\" (\"Serbia to Tokyo\") on the wall of an abandoned house in a war-torn Bosniak village, later holding a Confederate flag when leaving the Bosniak village sitting on top of an M53/59 Praga, and he always wear a headband with the Chinese character for \"dragon\" (\u9f8d) on it.Milan, disturbed with the way the war is being conducted, is frustrated by the fact that war profiteers are looting Halil's property. Milan shoots three of the profiteers out of anger after they set fire to the auto-repair shop he and Halil had built together, wounding them, and is then shocked to find Slobo is looting the property too. Later, Slobo tells him that his mother has been killed by Bosniaks from Halil's squad, and Milan returns to home to find it vandalized with Bosniak nationalist graffiti and covered in his mother's blood. After the squad set a village on fire, they watch it burn and Velja says: \"Pretty villages are pretty when they burn. Ugly villages stay ugly, even when they burn.\" (in Serbian, \"Lepa sela lepo gore, a ru\u017ena sela ostaju ru\u017ena, \u010dak i kad gore\".) At night Milan and his squad are encircled by Bosniak fighters, telling his surviving squad mates to run to a nearby tunnel he was scared of entering as a child, believed to be home to a drekavac. Milan, Velja, Professor, Fork, Laza, and Gvozden enter the tunnel and fight off the Bosniak fighters, however the group become trapped as they will be shot if they leave. Attempting to contact their allies, the Bosniaks taunt them using Marko's radio, who they are torturing. Shortly afterwards, Speedy crashes his truck into the tunnel, with Liza Linel (Lisa Moncure) an American reporter for CBC News who had sneaked into the back of the truck, and the two also become trapped.\nThe squad stays inside the tunnel for a week but begin to snap: Laza is mortally wounded when trying to throw a grenade. Velja tries to leave the tunnel with the intention of dying but is shot and the others bring him back. The Bosniaks then announce they are sending a woman to the squad \"for their enjoyment\" who is revealed to be Milan and Halil's former school teacher who has been sexually abused. As she walks towards them slowly, they decide to shoot her before she gets too close, fearing explosives have been attached to her. None of them can do it until Fork shoots her, then having had enough of the war attempts to leave the tunnel but is killed, and Velja commits suicide. Milan recognizes the voice on the radio as Halil, and the two communicate shortly before the Bosniaks attack the tunnel. Gvozden drives the truck out of the tunnel at full speed (while singing Uz Mar\u0161ala Tita) before exploding from fires lit at the entrance, killing Gvozden and the troops attacking the tunnel, allowing the others to leave. On the way out Speedy is wounded by a stray bullet and Liza is killed by shrapnel from a grenade. Milan and Halil meet outside, where Halil asks who burned down his garage while Milan asks who killed his mother - both men deny being involved before Halil is then killed by a Serb artillery strike.\nMilan, Professor, and Speedy escape and all three are sent to the Belgrade military hospital, where Speedy is the friend in the bed next to Milan. Speedy briefly wakes up, but eventually dies, and the following night Milan tries to kill the Bosniak boy as promised, despite being unable to walk. Milan crawls into the next room, followed by an equally disabled Professor trying to stop him. As Milan goes to stab the boy with a fork, he cannot bring himself to do it, and is discovered by the nurses. An imaginary scene then shows the tunnel full of dead bodies, including Milan and Halil, being witnessed by them as children.\nThe film closes on 21 July 1999 with a newsreel, showing the re-opening of the reconstructed tunnel under the new name, the Tunnel of Peace.", "tmdb_plot": "In the opening stages of the Bosnian War, a small group of Serbian soldiers are trapped in a tunnel by a Muslim force.", "tmdb_id": "29927", "wiki_id": "2724834"}, {"title": "Primal Fear", "genres": ["Crime", "Drama", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "wiki_plot": "Martin Vail is an arrogant Chicago defense attorney who loves the spotlight and is known for winning acquittals for high-profile clients on legal technicalities.\nOne morning, Archbishop Rushman, a beloved figure and head of Chicago's Catholic diocese, is ambushed and savagely killed by an unseen assailant. Aaron Stampler, a 19-year-old altar boy from Kentucky, seen fleeing the scene covered in blood is arrested for the crime. Vail meets with Aaron in his holding cell and offers to defend him pro bono. Aaron reveals that he had admired the archbishop. Vail believes that Aaron is innocent, being meek and with a severe stutter. Meanwhile, Janet Venable is assigned by the state's attorney to prosecute the case.\nVenable and Vail have a shared history. They previously worked together as state attorneys, and had a sexual relationship at that time. Vail tries to seduce her again at a public event the night before the murder, whispering into her ear from behind and asking her to dance, despite there being no music; she refuses him, declaring their past was \"a six month long one night stand.\"\nAs the trial begins, Vail discovers that powerful civic leaders, including the corrupt state's attorney John Shaughnessy, recently lost millions in real-estate investments, due to Rushman's decision to not develop church-owned land. This is revealed by Vail's former client, Joey Pi\u00f1ero, who wants to protect the community from being displaced by high-end real estate development.\nFollowing a tip from Alex, another former altar boy, about recorded evidence of the archbishop being a sexual predator, Vail steals a VHS cassette from the crime scene. The tape shows the archbishop forcing Aaron, Linda, and Alex to engage in sexual acts. When Vail confronts Aaron about lying, Aaron breaks down crying and suddenly becomes a violent sociopath without a stutter who self-identifies as Roy. Roy claims responsibility for the archbishop's death and attacks Vail. Soon after, he becomes passive and shy again, with no recollection of the personality switch.\nNeuropsychologist Molly Arrington, investigates Aaron for several hours and concludes he has dissociative identity disorder caused by years of physical and sexual abuse at the hands of his father and Rushman. Vail is troubled by this information, because it proves his client is innocent by reason of insanity plea, but he can not change his defense in the midst of an ongoing trial. \nVail decides to anonymously deliver the evidence to Venable's doorstep, knowing that she is under intense pressure to deliver a guilty verdict and will use the tape as proof of Aaron's motive, which she has so far been unable to establish. Venable knows Vail is using her to reveal the archbishop as a sexual predator and generate sympathy for Aaron. Venable's boss Shaughnessy commands her to destroy the evidence, but she refuses and introduces it in court.\nPi\u00f1ero is discovered murdered. Surprisingly, Vail calls Shaughnessy as a witness in Aaron's case, and exposes Shaughnessy on the stand as guilty of hiding previous evidence of the archbishop's sexual predation. Vail accuses Shaughnessy of resenting the archbishop for stopping the sixty million dollar land development deal, especially when the archbishop clearly owed Shaughnessy for hiding evidence, but Judge Shoat stops the line of questioning and fines Vail for using the court room as a stage for his own revenge.\nDr. Arrington testifies that Aaron's \"body could be present at a homicide and yet his mind would be unable to recall it,\" but the judge dismisses her testimony as being too close to a plea of insanity.\nFinally, Vail calls Aaron to the witness stand and questions him about the sexual abuse he suffered at Rushman's hands. While Aaron appears increasingly distressed, Vail surreptitiously covers the court microphone and threatens, \"Stop your whining, little girl. Be a man,\" words he knows will trigger Aaron's memories of having been abused by his father.\nVenable begins a challenging cross-examination, in which Aaron suddenly becomes Roy, screaming obscenities and death threats. He leaps at Venable and holds her hostage in a headlock, but is subdued and returned to his cell. \nThe judge informs Vail and Venable that she intends to dismiss the jury in favor of a bench trial, and will declare Aaron not guilty by reason of insanity, remanding him to a psychiatric hospital. She warns Vail to be more professional in the future. \nVenable is fired for losing the case and for allowing Shaughnessy and Rushman's crimes to be publicly exposed. She confronts Vail for having used her. He admits he knew she was in potential danger during the cross-examination, but defends his choice. He then tries to use her vulnerability to resume their sexual relationship again, approaching her from behind and whispering into her ear, but Venable refuses him.\nVail visits Aaron in his cell to inform him of the dismissal. A shaky and dazed Aaron claims to have no recollection of his violent reaction in the courtroom, but joyfully expresses his gratitude to Vail: \"You say- you say- you saved my life.\"\nAs Vail is leaving, Aaron asks him to convey an apology to Venable for the attack. Vail confronts Aaron for being able to remember what happened during the \"Roy\" blackout. No longer stuttering, Aaron confidently brags about contriving the multiple personality disorder, killing both Rushman and Linda, and manipulating Vail. Vail wonders aloud: \"So there never...there never was a Roy.\" With contempt, the murderer corrects him: \"There never was an Aaron.\" \nVail leaves the courthouse, stunned and disillusioned, to the sound of the murderer's taunts echoing in the halls.", "tmdb_plot": "An arrogant, high-powered attorney takes on the case of a poor altar boy found running away from the scene of the grisly murder of the bishop who has taken him in.

The two prisoners cope with the situation in very different ways, as the war-hardened and cynical sergeant Sasha (Oleg Menshikov) works to escape while the young and naive conscript Vanya (Sergei Bodrov, Jr.) tries to make friends with his captors and falls in love with Abdul's daughter Dina.\nVanya is portrayed as a very vulnerable and \"interesting\" soldier as he is unable to kill. In a specific scene Sasha expresses his strife and anger with Vanya to \u201ccome back and kill the Chechens.\u201d  Vanya\u2019s response was very soft because he desires to not kill the people, especially after falling in love with Dina. Vanya\u2019s mother makes an appearance to the patriarch of the village to sympathize with him about his captured son in order to get Vanya back.  His response is coldhearted as he refuses to let him go.  In another scene that defines Vanya\u2019s masculinity, he is put up against a Chechen fighter. In Hollywood a viewer could almost predict the outcome in which the underdog would make an impressive win against the talented fighter.  Although, this is not shown because the fighter laughs at Vanya and sends him away.(3)\nSasha is a very successful, confident soldier. At first he is cold towards Vanya but eventually teams up in order to form an escape. Before the escape, Sasha breaks down sobbing in a very  long, yet poetic scene. The cinematography is focused on his facial expressions defining every detail.  The sound that goes along with this scene is a Russian war song from the Second World War. This scene contrasts the point that Sasha is a big and strong sergeant, but breaks down at the thought of going back to the homeland. This brings vulnerability between Vanya and Sasha. ()Not long after this scene, Sasha leads the escape as he kills two people along the way.  One was a guard that was a capture as well and one that was a shepherd. During these scenes we are shown the insensitivity of Sasha towards death.(3)\nAfter an escape attempt fails, Bodrov expresses complete irony in the narrative in which it is Vanya\u2019s fault that Sasha was killed because he fired the gun that had them found.(2) Sasha takes the blame for the deaths to Abdul and is taken to be executed.\nAfter Abdul's son is killed during an escape attempt, Abdul goes to execute Vanya in return, only to find that he has been released by Dina. Dina at first refused to let him go but promised a \u201cproper burial\u201d. Ironically as Dina caves in and lets him go Vanya does not run. This is because he tries protecting Dina from her father for never forgiving her for letting Vanya go.(3) When Abdul walks him out of the village to execute him, he instead fires his rifle over Vanya's head and walks away, leaving him. Vanya sets off back to the Russian lines, and sees a helicopter squadron. He tries to flag them down, only to realize that they have been sent to destroy the village he and Sasha were imprisoned in. The movie ends with a closing monologue from Vanya (Translated as follows):\n\"After the imprisonment, They held me in a hospital for two weeks, and then sent me home. On the train, Mother cried all the way, and told a fellow passenger how fortunate she was. I always wish I could see the people I grew to love in my dreams, whom I will never see again. But I just can't get their faces to come to me.\"\nThe end of the movie suggests the most ironic part of the movie and that war is a never-ending series of unfortunate events which is uncharitable to everyone involved.(4)", "tmdb_plot": "Two Russian soldiers, one battle-seasoned and the other barely into his boots and uniform, are taken prisoner by an anxious Islamic father from a remote village hoping to trade them for his captured son.", "tmdb_id": "55936", "wiki_id": "8423598"}, {"title": "Project: Alf", "genres": ["Comedy", "Family", "Science Fiction", "TV Movie"], "wiki_plot": "The film begins where ALF had ended, with Gordon Shumway\u2014otherwise known as ALF, short for Alien Life Form\u2014being captured by the US Air Force's Alien Task Force (ATF) while attempting to depart Earth. ALF is detained at Edmonds Air Force Base as ordered by Colonel Gilbert Milfoil, the ATF's head of security. Despite everyone's worst fears, ALF has been thriving in captivity. In fact, the poker games that he conducts in his cell with his guards, where he sells concessions and generally cleans up on the table, have made his life very cushy, similar to a bachelor pad; in fact, he has enough possessions to fill an aircraft hangar. Acting independently, Milfoil plans on killing his prisoner under the guise of a beauty treatment, for which he has left a paper trail implicating his aide de camp, Second Lieutenant Harold Reese. They discuss ALF's relationship with the Tanner family, who have moved to Iceland under the Witness Protection Program.\nLearning of this, two Air Force scientists, Major Melissa Hill and Captain Rick Mullican, help ALF escape, hiding at a cheap motel. ALF's annoying behavior results in him being ordered to hide in the restroom, reminding him of when the Tanners would do the same.

After she refuses to participate, he imprisons her. ALF, unaware of the betrayal, revels in being the center of attention until stage fright and the increasing hostility of his host lead ALF to lock himself in the bathroom, giving the military time to shut down the broadcast. Both Hill and ALF are arrested, and Milfoil reneges on the deal, unwittingly revealing his murderous intentions on a security recording, which finds its way into Reese's hands.\nBack at Edmonds, Milfoil gloats that ALF's escape means he will be able to convince his superiors to have the alien executed openly, his hatred being revealed as seeking payback for an alleged alien abduction that drove his mother insane.

The little girl has chosen to become mute as a way to protest her parents' constant fighting. Her parents, more concerned with their own issues, believe their daughter is just going through a phase. The film shows how even very young children can be extremely cognizant of problems that are going on in their own homes even when their parents try hard to shield them from everything.\nThe girl learns other ways to communicate with her parents.

Upon arriving she instantly meets Frank Machi, the shop teacher, who orients her.  In her first class she meets several students.  These include Daniel Webster, a surfer and aspiring designer, Marco Quito, an outspoken and flashy cool kid, Gilbert Tutu, an overweight and shy, yet brilliant computer geek, Oni Nagano, a whiny valley girl of Japanese descent, Eduardo Braz, a young mechanic who is quick to defend his heritage and his friends from insults, and Luana Kanahele, Eduardo's girlfriend.  Sandra is quick to confess to her class that she doesn't science, but english, yet emphasizes that unlike the other teachers she intends to push them through their classes despite their self-declared \"Lolo\" (Stupid) status.\nIn a teacher's meeting, Sandra attempts unsuccessfully to raise awareness for the science fair that week since no students at Kona Pali are participating.  Her attempts are rebuffed due to a looming sense of hopelessness regarding what can be accomplished at the school.  Frank chides her and tells her that she will understand with time.  Daniel's design for an experimental surfboard is rejected by his boss at his job, unmotivatingly telling him to stick to the preset designs.  The next day, Sandra calls Daniel, Braz, Marco, Gilbert, Oni, and Luana.  The six being the only students to not offer a proposal for a science project so she requires them to attend the district science fair the following night in order to come up with ideas.\nAt the fair, a solar car model done by Sutcliffe Academy is showcased as being an entry for the upcoming Hawaiian inter-island solar car race.  Jack Fryman, marketing vice-president of Celtech Corporation and the father of Steve Fryman, one of the students involved, announces that the winner of that race will be admitted into the World Solar Challenge, a six-day race held in Australia.  Gilbert and Daniel express interest but they're rebuffed by the rest claiming it to be more of a \"Haole\" (Non-Local Hawaiian) affair.  When Daniel begins to admire the mini-model of the solar car, Steve instantly harasses him and tells him not to go near their car, calling him a Lolo in the process.  The other students arrive and Marco instantly begins to trade words with Steve, and Sandra attempts to defuse the situation by getting them to walk away.  Steve, however, directs one last sexually degrading comment towards Luana, which causes Braz to punch him.  Jack Fryman arrives and Steve claims that Braz attacked him for no reason, Jack then has security called to escort him out calling Braz an animal.\nIn Saturday detention, the six start talking once the teacher leaves.  The blame eventually landing on Daniel for their situation, and Braz instantly attacks Daniel calling him a Haole given what happened and how Daniel acted throughout.  Daniel tells Braz he is just as local as the rest of them, to which Braz proposes retaliating violently against the Sutcliffe team.  Daniel simply shows him a sketch for a solar car, as an alternative means of fighting back against what happened.  Once released from detention, the six students visit Sandra's home and show her the sketch as their proposal for the science project.  The six are determined to do it despite the race only being two months away, regardless of whether or not they receive credit for it since they want to get back at Sutcliffe.  Braz being the mechanic, Daniel being the designer and handler of fiber glass, Marco offering himself as the lead driver, Gilbert's computer knowledge is also employed while Luana is left to eventually think of a position with the team.  Oni then introduces Uni Kakamura, a math prodigy who is just as shy and soft-spoken as Gilbert as an addition to the team, and Daniel says he could bring someone else in.  Sandra eventually relents and agrees.\nThat night, Daniel talks to Cindy Johnson, his willful and rebellious stepsister and after a slight argument between them and Daniel's father, Cindy agrees to join them.  The team then starts to work on the car, yet Daniel's design proves to be too hard for them to manifest.  Sandra talks to Frank to ask for his help, but refuses by pointing out that the students are Lolos with no drive or higher aspirations beyond being low income, minimum wage workers.  Gilbert, however, refuses to give up on the project and refuses to get out of the skeleton of the car even after falling under his weight.  Frank tells Sandra that he would handle the situation, and simply tells him to stay in the car all the time he wants after she leaves.\nThe next morning Daniel wakes up to see a cockroach walking through his dresser and has an epiphany for a more ergonomic design.  Getting the team back together, they work and manage to build Daniel's second design in time for the race and name it \"Cockroach\".  At a teacher's meeting not far from the race, Sandra states that if the Kona Pali team wins the inter-island race and goes to Australia they will need a male chaperone.  Frank is given the chance and signs the paper after some goading by Sandra.\nThe day of the race, Daniel has the sudden idea to put in an extra battery in the car.  Daniel being a surfer is capable of predicting sky conditions, and claims that the sky will cloud over that afternoon.  Due to that strategy, the Kona Pali team is able to outperform everyone else and barely qualify by completing the required hundred laps, defeating Sutcliffe Academy and a resentful Steve in the process.\nJack Fryman attempts to have the Cockroach rebuilt and redesigned to have Celtech's solar panels after being pressured by his superiors, but the team refuses with Braz emphasizing that their car was built by \"animals\".  Arriving in Australia, the drivers are weighed in and Gilbert registers himself as an alternate.   The students are nearly demoralized when seeing the arrival of Hans Kooiman and the Euro Team as well as several other entries, but are reassured that they are here to race like everyone else.  The night before the first day, Sandra announces that a captain must be chosen and Daniel is nominated due to the double battery idea that got them there.\nOn the first day the Cockroach suffers a busted ball joint.  Jack Fryman tells them to either fix the car or leave the race, Frank threatens Jack not to interfere again.  The team eventually manages to repair the car, but fall greatly behind as a result.  When reaching their camping stop for the night, they're told not to despair since the highway can play tricks and even the odds.  On the second day things go smoothly until a sand storm hits that damages several cars, but the cockroach and Cindy survive intact.  That night, Frank tells Sandra that he made it to Kona Pali because of Gilbert.  Gilbert's father, John Francis Tutu, was a machinist on the USS Clark where a 22 year-old Frank was also stationed.  One day an oxygen tank blew up and killed four men, including Gilbert's father who jumped in front of Frank to save his life.\nOn the third day they arrive at the halfway point of the race, interrupting Hans Kooiman's interview.  Upon arriving, Luana is named their spokeswoman.  That night at the hotel, Marco mocks Gilbert for being a registered driver, and Cindy tells Uni that she should be more assertive against Oni, who tends to boss her around.  Later on at a reception dinner, Marco and Oni dance with the local Australians while Sandra and Frank have dinner and talk about their respective divorces before being brought onto the dance floor by Marco and Oni respectively.  Gilbert and Uni look on and decide they don't want to dance, with a mutual attraction growing between them.  As Braz and Luana walk through the nearby streets, they see Jack talking to Daniel, having approached him moments earlier in an attempt to persuade him and the team to drop out of the race.  Moments later, Daniel sees Cindy on a bike while drinking from a flask.\nOn the fourth day Cindy can't drive well due to the hangover, and is disqualified from driving for the rest of the race for drinking while in a school sponsored event.  Daniel reveals himself to be the one who looked through her belongings and exposed her.  Cindy runs off to be alone and Daniel follows her and tries to talk some sense into her, but she rejects him.  On the fifth day Oni suffers from a fever and is rendered unable to continue.  Marco then goes head to head with Hans Kooiman and are both barely missed by two road trains.  When Daniel tries to apologize, Hans is hostile.  Braz tries to defuse the situation and Hans spits at him in an attempt to instigate a fight but Braz restrains himself.  Braz then attacks Daniel, claiming to be the one having to fight his fights after he screws up and revealing that he saw him talking to Jack and accuses him of trying to sabotage them on purpose and once more calling him a Haole.  Daniel then resigns as captain and gives Braz the position.  That night the atmosphere among them all is deathly quiet, with Braz quietly voicing his fears and concerns to Luana.\nOn the final day, Marco also suffers from the heat and becomes delirious while in the car causing it to swerve onto the dry sand as Hans and his team pass them.  Uni being the only one left takes the wheel while the rest follow her.  The Cockroach suffers an electrical fire, however, and swerves off of the road onto the edge of a small cliff.  Daniel and Braz try to save her together, but Gilbert simply comes and smashes the windshield to get her out while Frank puts the fire out.  While checking the gauges, Braz determines that the car still runs and can therefore still make it.  Frank claims they're out of drivers, but Gilbert offers himself showing that he is registered with Marco's confirmation.  Frank tells him that the car won't move with him inside and then goes on to tell the students that because of their efforts in this race being the first high school team to ever enter it that they can never be called Lolos again.  Daniel responds by saying that in his own eyes he will always be a Lolo if they quit now, which is what's expected of them.

Through their encouragement, Gilbert is finally able to pass over the hill and Marco gets on the back of the Cockroach to coach him as they gain momentum and catch up to Hans.

Horrified by the sickness and death caused by the mosquitoes that infest the swamps, he hopes to drain them; he goes to Versailles in the hope of obtaining the backing of King Louis XVI. Just before reaching Versailles, Ponceludon is robbed and beaten. He is found by the Marquis de Bellegarde, a minor noble and physician. As Ponceludon recuperates at the marquis' house, Bellegarde takes him under his wing, teaching him about wit (l'esprit), the primary way to make one's way at court. At first, Ponceludon's provincial background makes him a target at parties and gatherings, even though he proves himself a formidable adversary in verbal sparring.\nAt one such party, he catches L'abb\u00e9 de Vilecourt cheating at a game of wits, with the help of his lover, Madame de Blayac, the beautiful and rich recent widow of Monsieur de Blayac, who was to have been Ponceludon's sponsor at court. Blayac repays his generosity in not exposing them by arranging for the certification of his lineage\u2014thereby allowing his suit to proceed. Despite his success, Ponceludon begins to see that the court at Versailles is corrupt and hollow.\nThe only exception is Mathilde de Bellegarde, the doctor's daughter. She has agreed to marry Monsieur de Montali\u00e9ri, a rich, old aristocrat whose wife is dying. Her motivation is twofold: to support her science experiments and to help pay off her father's debts. Ponceludon begins to help her with her experiments. Montali\u00e9ri observes their growing attraction to each other. Later, Montali\u00e9ri tells Ponceludon that he should wait, as he is not likely to live very long, and Mathilde would be a rich widow. Even after Mathilde admits that she dreads her upcoming marriage, Ponceludon does not want her to end up the wife of a poor man.\nOne day, a deaf-mute named Paul runs through the woods wearing Mathilde\u2019s diving suit and frightens Madame de Blayac. Blayac makes Bellegarde send him away. Bellegarde sends the boy to the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e, a pioneering educator of the deaf.  Mathilde visits Madame de Blayac and unsuccessfully pleads for Paul. Madame de Blayac senses a rival for Ponceludon. Meanwhile Vilecourt is concerned that Ponceludon is becoming too successful, so Madame de Blayac promises to bring him down. Madame de Blayac traps Ponceludon at a dinner party (with her accomplice Montali\u00e9ri) where one too many guests has been invited. A contest of wit is used to settle who must make a humiliating departure. Distracted by Blayac, Ponceludon loses, and is convinced that his disgrace will force him to leave the court. However, he is reminded of why he set out in the first place when a village child dies from drinking contaminated water. During this time, Mathilde appears at court, breaking the terms of her engagement contract.\nVilecourt finally obtains an audience with the King, but blunders by accidentally blaspheming against God in an attempt to be witty, and Blayac turns her attention back to Ponceludon, convincing him to return to Versailles. He sleeps with her in exchange for her assistance; she arranges a meeting with the King. She maliciously has Bellegarde attend her in his capacity as physician when Ponceludon is still with her, ensuring that Mathilde learns of their relationship.\nDuring a presentation at court of the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e's work with deaf people and development of sign language, the nobles ridicule the deaf mercilessly. However, some nobles change their minds when the deaf demonstrate their own form of wit: sign language puns.

He kills the cannoneer and learns that the King cannot meet with someone who has killed one of his officers right after his death, although he is assured that it was right to uphold his honour.\nMadame de Blayac is furious when she learns that Ponceludon has left her for Mathilde and plots her revenge. Ponceludon is invited to a costume ball \"only for wits.\" Upon arriving at the ball with Mathilde, he is manoeuvered into dancing with Blayac and is tripped. His spectacular fall earns him the derisive nickname \"Marquis des Antipodes\" by Milletail. Ponceludon tears off his mask and condemns their decadence. He tells them that they class themselves with Voltaire because of their wit, but they have none of Voltaire's compassion. He vows to drain the swamp by himself and leaves the court with Mathilde.

The next day, along with newly recruited  Captains Frye and Darrow, Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz Island, taking 81 tourists hostage. Hummel threatens to launch the rockets against San Francisco unless the U.S. government pays him $100 million from a military slush fund, which he will distribute to his men and the families of Recon Marines who died on covert missions under his command, but whose deaths were not compensated.\nThe Department of Defense and FBI develop a plan to retake the island using a U.S. Navy SEAL team led by Commander Anderson, the FBI's top chemical weapons specialist, Dr. Stanley Goodspeed, and the only inmate ever to escape Alcatraz: John Mason. FBI Director James Womack bribes Mason with a pardon (which Womack subsequently destroys), and Mason is set up in a hotel. He escapes, resulting in a car chase with Goodspeed through the streets of San Francisco as Mason seeks out his estranged daughter, Jade.

Anderson and all of the SEALs are killed, leaving only Mason and Goodspeed alive. Goodspeed wants to finish the mission and attempts to strong-arm Mason into helping.

Goodspeed disables another rocket but then gets captured. With the incursion team lost, the backup plan is initiated: an airstrike by F/A-18Cs with thermite plasma, which will neutralize the poison gas but also kill everyone on the island.\nMason and Goodspeed escape, and Mason explains why he was held prisoner: as a former British SAS captain and MI6 operative, he was captured after stealing a microfilm containing details of the United States' most closely guarded secrets. Knowing he would be \"suicided\" if he returned it, he spent the last thirty years imprisoned without trial for refusing to hand it over.\nWhen Hummel's deadline for the ransom passes, he is urged by his men to fire a rocket. Although he does, he redirects it to detonate at sea. When confronted by Darrow and Frye, Hummel explains the rocket threat was an elaborate bluff, as he had never intended to harm innocent civilians. He declares the mission over and orders them to exit Alcatraz with some hostages and the remaining rocket to cover their retreat while he assumes blame. Darrow and Frye, realizing they will not be paid their $1 million apiece, mutiny against him. They declare themselves mercenaries, and a firefight ensues; Baxter is killed defending Hummel, who is mortally wounded. The latter manages to tell Goodspeed where the last rocket is before dying.\nDarrow and Frye proceed with the plan to fire on San Francisco. Goodspeed seeks out the rocket while Mason deals with the remaining Marines. As the jets approach, Goodspeed disables the rocket before killing Darrow and Frye.

After sarcastically \"praising\" the class, Munitz and Tissona proceed to denounce this as \"an act of rebellion\" and that the ringleader confess his or her action. As each of their classmates begin to be called up, Tikel and Rozy decide to take pills to help them avoid the interrogation. Elinor Galash, a math prodigy, is singled out as the person who helped solve the questions in the exam, though Tissona doesn't punish her and offers her sympathy. Next to be interrogated is Rozy, whom he attempts to plant the seed of doubt by falsely hinting that Rozy will be sold out, but when asked who blackmailed Elinor into solving the answers of the test, he is met by silence. Next up is Tikel, to whom Tissona tells him about a dream he had with \u00c9dith Piaf, then about an experience about his youth with a love interest, in an attempt to get him to confess to his \"pathetic act of rebellion\". Tikel, however, denies that he organised the act. Eventually, Galit Biron helps track Munitz and Tissona down to Clara Chanov, who almost immediately reveals that she gave the numbers of the test to the kids, and also that she had \"an idea\" as to which numbers would be given on the test, revealing that she has clairvoyance.\nThe next morning, Tikel and Rozy attempt to burn Galit Biron alive in retaliation for telling Munitz and Tissona about Clara. Galit, however, reveals that instead of the Sports period that day, they will have another math test, and that Clara told her about it. Tikel asks Clara about it, and she gives them 5 numbers from the book. As expected, Tissona and Munitz attempt to do a raffle pop-quiz to see if the last test was a fluke; Elinor Galash picks the 5 numbers from the book, as Clara predicted: 99, 404, 111, 890, and 1000. After the entire class finishes the quiz, Tikel is accosted about it by Tissona, who begins to suspect that him and Rozy are taking pills to avoid talking to the school authorities. After school, Tikel, Rozy, and Liby, a friend of theirs, talk about the events, and that Clara is too smart to guess the numbers of the test twice. As they walk away from the school grounds, the anarchist friends resolve to \"do something real heavy that will put [them] in the country's history books.\" As they go their separate ways, Rozy tells Liby that Tikel is in love with Clara, and (erroneously) that Tikel might be a double agent for Tissona.\nLater that afternoon, Munitz and Tissona go to Clara's house, and attempt to disprove that Clara has clairvoyance. Clara's family, however, insist that she is, even in the face of Munitz's scepticism. However, Clara and Tissona call the meeting short, as Clara has a vision: the kids' action, as revealed, was to hang the statue of school namesake Golda Meir in their homeroom classroom and set it on fire, something Clara, as her family is implied to be devotees of Golda Meir, takes as a deep insult. Tissona, now convinced that Clara does have clairvoyance, proclaims that she and him will lead the revolution that Tissona had been actually expecting for years, and warns her not to fall in love, for if she does, she stands to lose her powers.\nThe next morning, Munitz, still sceptical of Clara's powers, decides to break whatever hold she has on the classmates by giving her an algebraic problem without solution, and shunning any \"help\" she might need, even that of Tikel's who had arrived from Tissona's office after being warned to stay away from Clara. Munitz's plan goes awry when the sky darkens to a deep red and a stork flies in and breaks the window; it is implied, then later revealed, that Clara had called on the stork to get her out of the blackboard. To console himself over the failure of his plan, Munitz tells Tissona about the sole day he spent in Vietnam during the war, which ended up with him beating Bobby Fischer in chess; Tissona, for his part, reveals something that a number of people, especially Tikel, long suspected: he had slept with \u00c9dith Piaf in early 1961, and the experience resulted in Piaf writing \"Non, Je Ne Regrette Rien\".\nTikel and the others decide to lay low as a result of not only the stork but also the Golda statue incident. They decide to pay a visit to the Chanov household. Liby calls Clara \"solid\", and Rozy talks about Clara as a whole; Tikel, however, notes that a glance at her eyes makes people say things that they never would, and that she's fascinating because of that. Clara, meanwhile, also goes to Tikel's house, where she encounters Tikel's dad, a cop, who guesses that she was the one who guessed the numbers of the two quizzes. He asks Clara to help him find a girl that he was in love with since he was a kid; that girl turns out to be none other than Sharon, Tikel's mom. Impressed (though outwardly sceptical), Tikel's father has Clara write down the lottery numbers for that evening's lottery. He wins the lottery, and promises to give half the money to the Chanovs. However, the action was undermined by Igor Chanov, Clara's father, giving the lottery numbers to everyone in Kiryat Gat, as he works in the lottery plant. As they have dinner that evening, Elvis, Clara's uncle, is struck by shell shock after remembering what happened to his girlfriend after she ran into the nuclear zone in Ukraine (implied to be the then-recent Chernobyl zone). Later, as he struggles to remember what happened to Natasha, Clara tells him that she ran off with someone else, though she also tells Tikel that a bear ate her (which would imply that no-one truly knows what happened to Natasha).\nThe aftermath of the lottery drawing is felt when many people stage mass suicides, while others still stage angry protests, blaming Igor for their ruin. A reporter for the RTL programme Catastrophes in Israel reports the scene, and when she attempts to interview Tikel's dad, who happens onto the scene, he curses her out and quits his job on live TV.\nMeanwhile, resentment brews between Rozy, Liby, and Tikel. Frustrated with Tikel's behaviour during the math quiz debacle, after the Golda statue incident, and now the botched lottery drawing, Rozy and Liby begin to mock Tikel, with Tikel being warned by Rozy that he wouldn't survive the Shoah as he \"can't handle mental stress\". The resentment boils over one evening, as Tikel picks a flower for Clara. Rozy, Liby, and Elinor's desk-mate appear and finally decide to openly betray Tikel. After being insulted by Rozy both over being \"friendly\" with Tissona and of being a double agent (and, by extension, his father), Tikel and Rozy fight, but Rozy not only punches him, but also hits him with a baseball bat, declaring that Clara would never go out with him. After returning home, Tikel and Sharon talk about what happened, and Sharon talks about how people used to fight over her, except one\u2014Tikel's dad. As they talk, Clara arrives at his home, but while Tikel tries and makes himself look presentable, she leaves and bumps unwittingly into Rozy, his sister Vered, and Liby, who take her with them on a tour around the city. They go to a chocolate shop, which Rozy, armed with his baseball bat, breaks a window of to give Clara a piece of chocolate.\nThe next day, Clara is hailed by the whole classroom, in spite of Rozy using her as the head of a mini-classroom revolution. That afternoon, Tikel finally calls out Clara's name, much to Tissona's amazement. As Tikel and Clara walk away from the school grounds, they are accosted by Liby and Rozy, who again mock Tikel and say that Tikel is incapable of leading a revolution. Clara then gives back the piece of chocolate to Rozy, and tells him to give it to Liby, who truly loves him. As both Tikel and Clara continue to leave the school grounds, he asks her out to a movie, which Clara is unsure of, as an earthquake is about to hit the town. The news causes most of the town to leave in a panic, save for Tikel and Clara, their respective families, and Liby and Rozy. That evening, Rozy and Liby share their first moment as a couple together, with Rozy expressing admiration for Clara's newfound fame, and admitting that he feels guilty about betraying Tikel like they did. Meanwhile, on the way to the movie, Clara and Tikel wander around town, and encounter Elvis, who tells her not to be afraid of the earthquake, as well as a surprising appearance: Tissona, who also stayed, asks Tikel to forgive him, and expresses admiration at Tikel and Clara together.

She fends off another sexual advance by her father; due to believing Carl would sway the police to his side if she reports him, she comes up with a plan to kill him instead. Having overheard him planning another drug deal, Shelly proposes to Raymond that he pose as Carl's drug dealer, lure him to a remote site, and kill him there before staging it as a drug deal gone wrong. Raymond agrees to the plan after Shelly confesses her abuse. Shelly realizes Carl has begun grooming Tanya, and, after stopping Carl from potentially harming her, is beaten by her father.\nAfter Raymond manages to convince Carl's contact about being Carl's dealer, Shelly comes home to see Carl had taken Tanya out to town and gotten her drunk. Knowing what he could do to her sister, she diverts Carl's attention to her by suggestively touching him; he later goes to her room and she reluctantly allows her father to have sex with her. As Shelly begins retrieving items to stage her father's murder, Carl becomes suspicious and begins following her, and later violently confronts his daughter about what she is doing. Shelly manages to lie to Carl before she and Raymond set the final stages for their plan.\nShelly and Raymond arrive at the site of the deal, an abandoned cabin, where they prepare for Carl's arrival. Shelley fires at a figure which turns out to be Tanya, who Carl brought along with her, possibly to rape her. After patching up the seriously injured Tanya, Shelley, Raymond, and Carl fight around the cabin. Carl manages to gain the upper hand and holds Raymond and Shelley at gunpoint before he is finally gunned down by Tanya, who finally sees her father's abusive ways.

The two arrive independently of each other, two of the Agency's assassins. As they meet, they recognize each other, as they have been on a mission together before.\nThis mission is portrayed in a series of flashbacks. In the first flashback, Waxman and Clegg were supposed to assassinate a female politician. Waxman hesitates when the politician lifts a child and, while hesitating, a helicopter appears, air assaulting soldiers in the courtyard behind the team's firing position. The two defeat the attacking force, including the machine gun-equipped helicopter, whose pilot and copilot are shot through the canopy.\nReturning to the primary scene, one of the construction site security personnel is new on the job. The drug-addicted regular, O'Hara (Christopher Heyerdahl) attempts to win a statutory position over him by scaring him. As Waxman opens a roof door, a light by the security personnel turns on, and the newcomer, Klein (Conrad Dunn) leaves in search of it.\nThe internal lift of the building is clearly audible, and Clegg surveys Klein's movements, when he arrives. She interrupts his inspections when he is about to open the roof door. She takes him to the lift, sending him downwards. However, just as she is talking him off, she sees Waxman sitting on top of the lift car. He mounts a bomb on the lift car and, when the car begins moving, nearly falls down the shaft. He is saved by Clegg, and they both attempt keeping up the \"just business\"-facade, although some romantic appreciation is apparent.\nWhile the two on the rooftop readjust their gear, O'Hara, presumably, decides to rape Clegg. However, Clegg pulls her small-caliber sidearm, and threatens O'Hara into the lift. When O'Hara returns downstairs, he picks up his gun and puts on body armor. He then surprises Clegg, while she is standing over the sink of the top-floor bathrooms. Clegg points her gun at him, and shoots a well-aimed bullet into his chest. Unsurprised by this, O'Hara attacks Clegg, but is encountered by Waxman, and a violent fight takes place in an unfinished hall between various building materials. The fight is won by Waxman, and he ties the now bloody O'Hara to a toilet.\nClegg and Waxman consummate their feelings for each other. Afterwards, as duty continues, Waxman heads for the bathrooms, but sees water running out under the door to the bathroom. He pulls his gun, and discovers that O'Hara has disappeared.\nO'Hara bears the toilet with him down the stairs. A vengeful O'Hara grabs his shotgun and is about to go upstairs to finish off Waxman. Klein, the new security guard, shoots O'Hara with his shotgun, walks to the spot where the dying O'Hara lies and, in cold blood, puts a final shot into him.\nUpstairs, the two are engaging the target. As before, Waxman hesitates and does not take the shot. As history repeats itself for the two, Clegg pulls her sidearm and implores Waxman to do his duty. Before the situation escalates, another shooter shoots the target four times and, when finished, takes aim for Clegg and Waxman. Waxman quickly throws himself and Clegg away from the shot, grabs his rifle and shoots the adversary. Waxman and Clegg defend themselves from Special Forces personnel raiding the skyscraper. Waxman and Clegg are surprised by Klein, who has stealthily entered the room. He shoots Waxman in the chest with his shotgun, but is threatened by Clegg who has picked up an MP5 submachine gun. He takes the lift car and leaves when the planted bomb explodes.\nBelieving Waxman to be dead, Clegg flees the skyscraper. As she walks away from the building, the top of a nearby fire hydrant is shot off.

He fantasizes about a woman he once knew. He has convinced himself that he is not a prostitute but an \"actor\" providing \"fantasies\". In his unsuccessful pursuit of an acting career, Harry goes on a casting call for a police film. The casting director asks if he will do nudity, implying a casting couch scenario. Harry says he is an artist and loses the role.\nBilly, though experienced, is still somewhat goofy and absent-minded. He sometimes helps Harry with scenes and Harry tries to convince him too that he is an actor and not a prostitute. On several occasions, Billy picks up men only to discover that the man is not actually his client.

Huber), a ruthless South African criminal mastermind prone to quoting Shakespeare, is intent on collecting a series of four interlocking electronic devices or circuits that can somehow \"shift the balance of power in the world.\" Through deception and violence he has managed to acquire three of the devices.\nCarrie, unbeknownst to her, has shuttled two of Fairfax\u2019s goons to the site of one of their exchanges.  The location of the fourth device, tucked away in the Zitex building, an 86-floor skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, is the scene where most of the drama unfolds as Fairfax sets his sights on securing the last device.\nCarrie is again called to pick up a pair of VIPs, who this time turn out to be Fairfax himself and his French assistant Jacques (Jonathan Fuller).  She takes them to the Zitex building, where Fairfax has his band of terrorists take over the entire security system and liquidate the security guards as well appropriate an entire floor.

As with the previous three deliverers of the devices, Fairfax plans on killing him. Cranston is mortally wounded in a shootout.  Before entering the building, Cranston had suspected trouble, so his companion went in unseen.  Before he dies, Cranston escapes with the suitcase holding the device and meets up with Carrie, who helps him up to the roof. He gives her the suitcase and admonishes her to keep it away from Fairfax at all costs.\nCarrie is hotly pursued over the roof by a muscular goon. With no way out but over the top, she jumps into a window washer's rig. She attaches herself to a steel winch cable and drops many floors down the side of the building at the speed of gravity until she is brought to a halt by the end of the cable.  Now, suspended and dangerously vulnerable to the gunman on the roof, who is shooting repetitively at her, she avoids being shot by constantly swinging around.

Therefrom, Karna dedicates his life to Duryodhana and turns his soulmate. \nNext, Dronacharya asks Arjuna his tuitional fee Guru Dakshina that to catch hold of Drupada, king of Panchala, and spins backward. At one time, they are besties who promise him to share half of his kingdom. Destitute he reaches for help when Drona is kicked out and he pledges to get him down. Listening to it, Arjuna attacks & seizes Drupada and throws him under the toes of the mentor. Humiliated, Drupada seeks vengeance when Lord Krishna calms him down and instructs him to conduct the Putrakameshti yagnam to beget a son who could slay Drona and daughter to espouse Arjuna. From that fire, the twins Dhrishtadyumna & Draupadi are born. Since birth, Draupadi adores Krishna and he too endears her as his sister. \nMeanwhile, Dharma Raja is crowned as the Prince of Hastinapuram which envies Kaurava. Henceforth, Kunti is perturbed for the safety and prayers to Krishna. Lord Krishna consoles her and words to guard and guide her sons through troubles in their life. On the eve of Krishna\u2019s birthday Pandavas visit Dwaraka when he calls a divine architect Maya who designs and accords them a spectacular building \u2018\u2019Mayasabha\u2019\u2019. Draupadi also lands when she crushes Arjuna. Sage Narada gifts a fruit and asks him to present it to his favorite. Thus, Krishna is about to share it he cuts his finger when Draupadi bandages him by tearing her saree and he promises to pay back her debt at right time.  \nLater, Pandavas proceeds on a trip for expanding the kingdom. In his pathway, Arjuna reaches Rameswaram where he spots Ram Seth. Narada also grounds and questions him why did Lord Rama need to depend upon Vanara as he is a great archer who can build the bridge with arrows?  Accordingly, he replies the viaduct built with arrows is highly potent which no one can destroy. Being aware of it, infuriated Anjineeya hackles and challenges Arjuna it is impossible to transport the group of Vanaras in such a bridge which cannot bear him alone. As a result, Arjuna constructs it using his skills of archery twice and Anjineeya collapses it. Like this, he makes a final attempt and readied a pyre if it fails. This minute, it stands firm when Arjuna spots Krishna had lent his shoulder to the foundation to save his external body. Suddenly, Anjineeya recognizes Krishna as his Lord Rama who advises him to decorate as Arjuna\u2019s flag.      \nConsequently, Duryodhana is frightened by the big hit of Arjuna and plots to eliminate Pandavas along with Shakuni. They act together to construct a wax house at Varanasi. Drutarastra sends Pandavas claiming it is the responsibility of a price to perform rituals therein. Krishna gazes at their evil play and warns Bheema to be alert. So, he digs a tunnel to the nearby forest. At midnight, the brutal puts fire but Pandavas & Kunti break out of jeopardy. Following, Bheema slaughters a devil rakshasa [[Hidimba|Hidimbasura] and his sister Hidimbi falls for him at first sight and they are knitted who gives birth to Ghatotkacha. As of today, the Pandavas hides under the guise of brahmins at Ekachakrapuram on the guidance of sage Vyasa. \nUpon which, a monster Bakasura plagues to whom they should send two oxen, a cartload of food, and a human being every day.  It so happens that, the house owners of the Pandavas get their time Kunti sends Bheema instead of their son who emerges as the victor by death blowing him. Simultaneously, Drupada arranges a svayamvara for Draupadi with an archery contest to win her. All the kings of the royal dynasty are invited but nobody would do so including Shalya, Jarasandha, and Duryodhana. Here Krishna tricks Karna into losing the contest. Nevertheless, Arjuna as a brahmin wins the contest when his true identity Pandavas comes out. They bestow Drupadi as alms to their mother Kunti commands them to share being unbeknownst of reality. At that moment, they are under dichotomy. At last, Krishna clarifies it, supports Kunti's proposal, and sanctions the nuptials.

When Krista's best friend Ruth, boarding a football team bus to pass out bottled water, gets manhandled badly, Krista later finds out that most of the cheerleaders have been undergoing such treatment. She reports the incident to new coach Ron Peters, who lightly talks it over with Josh, but the team captain denies it all.\nUndeterred, Josh and Nelson continue their campaign of harassment. The pair corner Krista in the girls' locker room. Josh pushes her against the lockers while Nelson holds her hands above her head, allowing Josh to freely run his hands all over Krista until Ruth intervened. A terrified Krista tells her mother Anne (Shanna Reed), who is also a counselor at the school, what happened, and she brings it to the attention of both Coach Peters and principal Vicky Cooke. A meeting is later scheduled to address the accusations, but after Krista presents her story, Josh counters by claiming that her accusations were just a form of retaliation because he supposedly resisted advances Krista made towards him. Siding with the football team, Ms. Cooke and Coach Peters decide to suspend the cheerleading squad for the remainder of the year.\nOutraged by the injustice, Anne discusses the idea of legal action with her husband Ted (Josh Taylor). Despite his initial reluctance, Ted comes around and agrees, but emphasizes that Ruth's testimony is key if they want the charges to stick. Realizing this, Anne tries to convince Ruth's mother Mona to come forward about what she saw, but Mona is greatly concerned about Ruth jeopardizing her college scholarship by doing so. Meanwhile, Krista's brother Kyle, who was recently given a coveted spot on the football team, seems to agree with Josh's version of what transpired and dismisses his sister's charges as false.\nFollowing Anne's directive, several detectives arrive at the school to bring Josh and Nelson in for questioning, but after being advised by Josh's lawyer father Alan not to speak, they decline to give a statement, and the pair are released. Alan later shows up at Ted's restaurant and tries to convince him to make Krista back down, but Ted refuses, stating he won't sell his daughter out.\nAfter an incident at the homecoming dance in which Nelson spills punch on Ruth, Krista is able to convince her to testify before the school board. However, rather than backing her friend up, Ruth instead corroborates Josh's version of events and makes Krista out to be a liar. To make matters worse, Anne later receives a request for her resignation from the school district, claiming that allowing the police on campus was an abuse of her authority. Blaming his sister for the turmoil, Kyle erupts at her, but Anne sets him straight, reminding Kyle that despite his athletic success, family is far more important than popularity, while Ted assures Krista that no one blames her for anything, and that he and her mother will do whatever it takes to fight back.\nMaking good on his word, Ted secures the services of a well-known law firm, which hears Anne and Krista's argument and agrees to take the case, but warns them that it will be difficult to pursue without hard evidence. In the meantime, Josh makes another unwanted advance toward Ruth, but Kyle witnesses it (as does Josh's girlfriend Vanessa) and intervenes. Angry, Josh confronts Kyle, but their teammate Randy steps in before it turns physical.\nKrista later confronts Ruth about her betrayal, who admits that she did so after being threatened with the loss of her scholarship by Ms. Cooke and Coach Peters. However, despite this setback, things turn around when Randy and Vanessa show up with some hard evidence: a \"Slam Book\" kept by Josh, critiquing the cheerleaders' physical attributes, as well as a drawing depicting the bus incident. Thanking her brother later for helping to get the book, Kyle expresses guilt towards Krista for his past behavior and apologizes for being a jerk.\nNow that actual evidence has been brought to light, the attorney from the family's law firm is able to move forward with their case, causing the school grounds to be abuzz with reporters. Having been informed that she was named as a defendant in the lawsuit, Ms. Cooke angrily confronts Anne, but she stands firm, reminding Vicky that she failed to protect the girls in the name of possibly winning a football trophy. Vicky then reminds Anne that she was supposed to tender her resignation, but Anne informs her that as per the conditions of the suit, this cannot be done until after the issue has been resolved (by which time, as Anne points out, Centennial may have a new principal).\nAs news of the suit becomes public, the Wilsons soon become targets of an intimidation campaign, but they refuse to back down. The family later meets with the defense attorneys, who offer a settlement of $15,000 for each of the cheerleaders, as well as their reinstatement on the school squad, but inform them that doing so will absolve the school of any culpability in what happened to the girls. After being told that the rest of the cheerleaders have already accepted, Krista gives an impassioned speech to her squad on the importance of standing up against the football team, and the cheerleaders decide to fight back, Ruth even apologizing to Krista for her earlier betrayal.\nDespite a subsequent offer of even more money from the district, all of the cheerleaders refuse, and each of them take the stand to tell their experiences over the course of the nearly four-week trial.

After destroying the Borg sphere, an away team transports down to Cochrane's ship, Phoenix, in Bozeman, Montana. Picard has Cochrane's assistant Lily Sloane sent back to Enterprise for medical attention. The captain returns to the ship and leaves Commander William T.

While in the future Cochrane is seen as a hero, in reality he built the Phoenix for financial gain and is reluctant to be the historic figure the crew describes.A group of Borg invade Enterprise's lower decks, assimilating crew and modifying the ship.

As the Borg continue to assimilate more decks, Worf suggests destroying the ship, but Picard angrily calls him a coward. Lily confronts the captain and makes him realize he is acting irrationally because of his own past with the Borg. Picard orders an activation of the ship's self-destruct, then orders the crew to head for the escape pods while he stays behind to rescue Data.As Cochrane, Riker, and engineer Geordi La Forge prepare to activate the warp drive on Phoenix, Picard discovers that the Borg Queen has grafted human skin onto Data, giving him the sensation of touch he has long desired so that she can obtain the android's encryption codes to the Enterprise computer.\nAlthough Picard offers himself to the Borg in exchange for Data's freedom and willingly become Locutus again, Data refuses to leave. He deactivates the self-destruct and fires torpedoes at Phoenix. At the last moment the torpedoes miss, and the Queen realizes Data betrayed her.

Despite his initial indifference, they soon become friends and take daily walks around the local beaches and parklands. Margot is an ethnologist, working with some of the locals in her spare time. Gaspard has an on again/off again girlfriend, L\u00e9na, who is planning to visit Dinard. Margot has just broken up with a boyfriend because their future careers are incompatible. Gaspard speaks of his confused relationship with L\u00e9na while Margot patiently offers advice. Gaspard, an incompetent romantic, doesn't know what to make of their growing closeness and clumsily tries to kiss Margot. She lightheartedly brushes the attempt off and they continue their easy friendship. Margot takes Gaspard on many outings, including a research trip to a local fisherman's house to discuss maritime folk songs. Gaspard is inspired by the fisherman's stories and writes his own sea shanty, a diversion from his typical blues music.\nGaspard joins Margot's friends for a night of dancing at a local bar where he feels out of place. One of the girls in the social circle, Sol\u00e8ne, notices Gaspard and takes a liking to him. Sol\u00e8ne is more sensual, confident, and straightforward in her approach with Gaspard.

Sol\u00e8ne, a former choir singer, also shows interest in Gaspard's music when he plays the guitar for her while lounging in her uncle's living room.

Gaspard, who has been flummoxed by L\u00e9na's standoffish behavior in the past, is delighted at her renewed interest in him and begins to set the stage to renege on the vacation with Sol\u00e8ne. During this time, Margot is in the background attempting to consult with him on his growing dilemma, but it is slowly appearing that she is also part of the Gaspard's romantic dilemma. Whenever he is with one of the girls, he gravitationally moves to the option closest to him at the time. His inability to commit to a choice leads Gaspard into the trap of double-booking the trip with both L\u00e9na and Sol\u00e8ne.\nLater in the week, L\u00e9na, who is prone to moody outbursts, professes that she is not in love with Gaspard and adds him into the general mix of men that she is sick and tired of.

She takes this prompt decision much to the chagrin of her father, an overbearing taxi driver. In exchange, he forces her to join him at work so she can learn the trade and earn a living.\nHer reconnection with the so-called \"Family\", the close-knit group of her father's co-workers, is initially uneventful. One of its members is Dani, Paz's childhood sweetheart and a young taxi apprentice about to be discharged from the military service. Upon meeting for the first time in many years, they rekindle their mutual attraction and start dating, much to the apparent satisfaction of Dani's mother Reme\u2014a fellow cabbie who is having a secret affair with Paz's father. Reme's husband is a former taxi driver who, according to the explanations given to Paz, was shot by two drug dealers during a robbery. One of the shots left him paralyzed and the \"Family\"'s visits to him in the hospital are a staple in their common social life. Aside from Dani, Velasco and Reme, this group is completed by a shady individual named Calero and a thuggish brute nicknamed \"Ni\u00f1o\" who seems to act as an informal henchman of sorts for the former. Paz realizes Calero is a former cop even before being told so, and their mutual distrust is vivid and ever-increasing throughout the film.\nFrom the outset, it is made clear to the audience that the \"Family\" is in fact a neo-fascist death squad whose members use their cabs to abduct non-white, immigrant, LGTB and drug-addicted customers with murderous intent. There is also some evidence of rudimentary tactics, e.g. using code words for each \"kind\" of victim in order to lure unwitting victims to the killing box. Dani has been recently groomed into the group and partakes in their activities, although it is made apparent to the audience that he does so reluctantly. The \"Family\" seems to be generally successful in its exploits: two murders are shown on-screen, as well as a raid on a Moroccan camp during which Dani accidentally kills a man. The film does show, however, one botched attack during which the victim manages to run away unharmed. It is left unclear whether or not the group is restricted to the core members shown onscreen. It is also left unclear whether the group's activities were prompted by the attack that crippled Dani's father or it was just a casual event that fuelled them further, or whether the version given to Paz was a lie and the attack was a direct result of the group's illegal pursuits. Their activities are spontaneous and seemingly not officially sanctioned, but there are ominous references by Calero to people \"up there\" who know and approve of the group's activities, leaving the door open to speculation on a wider conspiracy.\nAlthough initially ignorant of the actions and general demeanour of the \"Family\", Paz gradually finds out the truth through a series of details and coincidences, such as a profusion of fascist and pre-democratic antics and regalia, purportedly intimate family reunions attracting skinheads and other sinister individuals and ending in massive Roman salutes, casual bigoted remarks from her father and Dani (as well as the latter's violent outburst on a black street vendor) and a disturbing pattern of codenames or \"labels\" directed at different collectivities. Paz's unassuming and long-suffering mother seems increasingly distraught at the prospect of having Dani close to her daughter, and although Paz initially blames this on his general lack of education and ambition, it becomes increasingly clear that her mother knows more than she says about him and the whole group.\nOnce confronted with the evidence, her disgust and adamant disapproval set up a chain of events leading to the climax. The paranoid and increasingly unstable Calero, who saw her as a potential liability to the group from the very beginning, now wishes to silence Paz at all costs. He shoots (and presumably kills) her father when he tries to stop him, and confronts her and Dani in the Retiro Park, shooting Dani, and being shot to death by Paz seconds before he is about to finish him off.

Deena no longer keeps any of her promises, skips school and leaves the family home whenever she pleases. Her attitude and the breakdown of their formerly close relationship distresses her mother, Cynthia. The family appears perfect on the surface, but both children know their father, Todd, didn't want to have them. He is distant, preferring his sideline of manufacturing wooden bowls to spending time with Cynthia, who drinks too much and has turned to Deena for companionship. Deena's brother Adam forges school notes for her in addition to persuading Cynthia not to spy on her daughter's activities. He also acts as a surrogate for his father, watching movies with Cynthia until she falls asleep on the sofa.\nCynthia's relationship with her alcoholic mother is also dysfunctional. Her mother is resentful that her other daughter, Judith, doesn't speak to her. She criticizes Cynthia's parenting, advising her to be stricter with Deena and smack her if she refuses to obey. Rather than confront Deena over cleaning her room, Cynthia does it herself, which enrages Deena; she reacts violently, pushing her mother before fleeing the house. Adam begins drinking alcohol in order to cope with the stress within the family. Deena makes up with a drunken Cynthia, who insists they watch a film together, but their improved relationship tanks the next day when a letter from school notifies Cynthia that Deena has been skipping school. The confrontation turns violent, with Deena slapping Cynthia hard enough to bloody her lip. Todd ineffectually tries to parent Deena, guilting her into apologizing to Cynthia, who hides the real reason for the argument from him. Although she admitted to Garret that she liked hitting her mother, Deena apologizes and while she admits she skipped school, she lies and claims that she wasn't with Garret. She then asks Cynthia to continue to hide her truancy from her father and cover for her absence at school.\nCynthia agrees to lie for her, but she soon has another setback when the principal informs her Deena has been kicked off the swim team and watches Deena lie to him about possibly having mono. Todd announces that there are going to be changes in the house to put an end to Deena's rebellious behavior. Todd is furious with Cynthia, blaming the situation on her ineffectual parenting and drinking. Announcing new changes, he gives Deena an after-school curfew and list of chores. Deena agrees, then goes upstairs and has sex with Garret, who has snuck in through her bedroom window. The next day Todd demonstrates to Cynthia how effective his approach is, informing her that Deena went to class, and that he's obtained all her missing assignments and done some research about Garret. Cynthia defiantly tells him that he can tell Deena when she finally gets home, as she isn't back from school and hasn't called. Todd grills Adam as to Garret's whereabouts, blaming him for lying to his mother. Deena, who is out with Garret, calls Todd and claims she has merely been complying with his \"list\" and has been doing homework with a friend. In response to Deena's manipulation, Todd ends up bargaining with her what time she will return home. Cynthia immediately calls the parents of the friend who Deena claimed she was with, proving that Deena has lied to Todd and that he is just as ineffective a parent as she is. When Todd insists on seeing Deena's supposedly completed homework when she gets home, she erupts violently and slams her bedroom door on his hand, breaking his fingers. Deena recklessly climbs the local radio tower, saying she can't go back home, but Garret convinces her to run away to California with him when the weather is warmer for hitchhiking.\nMeanwhile, Cynthia and Todd have no idea what to do about Deena. When they find marijuana and tests with failing grades in her bedroom, Todd grounds her, telling her he is removing her stereo and phone and forbidding her from seeing Garret again. Threatening to call the police if she doesn't comply, Deena responds by threatening Todd that she'll tell the police she acted in self-defense and that he tried to rape her. While Deena has Adam deliver a note to Garret telling him she wants to run away now, Cynthia starts undermining Todd's decisions, making snacks for Deena and asking Todd to return her stereo. Todd initially refuses until Deena has completed her missing schoolwork, but relents when Cynthia starts to open a bottle of wine. Deena sneaks out again to see Garret, who reveals he got into a violent confrontation with his mother and a man she brought home, so he has decided to leave town immediately, telling Deena to pack up and meet him. Deena is caught sneaking in and her parents react furiously, which results in Deena hitting her mother with a phone and threatening to stab her father. Adam calls the police, who arrest Deena, over the protests of her parents, who are convinced that \"drugs\" are to blame, and that she should be taken to the hospital and treated. As Deena is put in the police car she sees an incredulous Garret, with his backpack, among the spectators. Although her parents attempt to withdraw the charges, Deena is released into her aunt Judith's custody, put on probation for 6 weeks, ordered to have no contact with her parents and to visit a therapist.\nWhen Deena questions where her impulse to strike Cynthia came from because she was never even spanked, Judith tells her that when she and Cynthia were children, their mother hit them, and Cynthia went to the other extreme. Cynthia, who has been drinking, calls and asks Deena where she went wrong because they were \"best friends,\" and that she tried hard to be a good mother. When Deena doesn't respond to Cynthia's claim that she's the only one she has to talk to, Cynthia resentfully tells her she is sorry that she called. She continues to drink and phone Deena, who refuses her calls, asking Judith why someone else couldn't have the responsibility.\nCynthia immediately makes plans to meet with Deena as she doesn't want to see her with a therapist, claiming it will make things worse. She fears Deena will make herself to be the victim, blaming her for her alcoholism and accusing Todd of rape. When her mother blames Cynthia's \"pathetic\" method of parenting, she blames her for her treatment of herself and Judith, which prompts her mother to slap her. After drinking too much and preparing homemade pizza, she goes to Judith's house.  When Deena tells her she's not supposed to be there, she drunkenly drops the pizza, calling her ungrateful, claiming she is just like Judith, who she blames for leaving her with the responsibility of caring for their mother. Deena runs out of the house and tries to find comfort with Garret, only to find him with another girl. When Judith visits Cynthia to tell her that Deena has returned home, she tells her that her behavior is the same as their alcoholic mother's. Cynthia denies it, stating that a bad mother couldn't have terrific kids, and that Deena was a wonderful child until she met Garret. When she insists that Adam validate her, she finds him drunk with an empty bottle of liquor in his bed. When Cynthia tries to tell Judith and Todd they should talk in the morning, Adam stumbles down the stairs after her. She tries to get him to return to bed to hide his drinking problem, but he shoves her into the wall, hard enough to break the glass in a family photo. As she tries to get Todd to tell Judith this has never happened before, he retreats into the basement with his woodwork. He tells her he has seen Adam drunk on two previous occasions and that he didn't tell her because it would prompt her to drink. While Cynthia blames Todd for being an absentee husband and father who turned to woodworking when Deena was born, Todd blames her for letting Deena take control of the family and capitulating every time she became angry, afraid to lose what she saw as her only friend. As he leaves and turns out the light, Todd resolves to start therapy with Adam and Deena, leaving Cynthia, who refuses to admit she is an alcoholic, literally in the dark.\nEn route by bus to therapy, Garret tells Deena that his previous girlfriend had pursued him, and he'd only had sex with her to make sure the relationship was still over. She is surprised to see her father and Adam at the center, and tells Garret she can't miss the session. Todd tells them he wishes Cynthia would show up, that he's there because he wants things to change, and that he loves them both. Cynthia arrives just as the session starts.\nGarret is at Deena's hearing, when the judge excuses any jail time, but still puts her on a year's probation with community service and anger management classes. He expects her to go to California with him, and when she tells him that things have changed, that Cynthia is in a treatment program and that her father and brother need her help, he reacts angrily to her rejection and nearly slaps her before stalking off.

Andre leaves to a local cafe where he meets one of the multiple enigmatic central characters, Matteo Strano (Marcello Mastroianni). Matteo offers Andre champagne and 1000 francs to listen to his story. Prior to the scene of Matteo's own storytelling, he reveals he was once married to Andre's wife. Matteo recounts the day he went out, on a whim, and rented out an apartment. Matteo insists this apartment is inhabited by fairies who eat time and who ultimately devoured 20 years of his life in one night. Matteo uses the story of his \u201cstrange journey in time\u201d to entice Andre into going to his \u201cfairy house.\u201d Andre accepts Matteo's request and is surprised to find that the apartment actually exists. Matteo takes Andre's fondness for the apartment as an acceptance of a deal that allows Matteo to go home, leaving Andre to remain in the bewitched apartment. When Andre refuses to take Matteo's place \u201che finds himself with a hammer in his head, thus retrospectively explaining his headache as a premonition.\u201d After a 20-year hiatus Matteo returns to his former home and his former wife, Maria, as if nothing had changed.\nBellemare then recounts the tale of George Vickers, a 69-year-old bachelor and Professor of \"Negative Anthropology\" at the Sorbonne. When Vickers ascends the main stairs at the Sorbonne, to give the opening lecture at a major conference on Negative Anthropology, he pauses and is overcome by a strange force and feeling. The strange force takes him to a graveyard where he shortly experiences grief. When a storm breaks out he becomes profoundly happy, so much so that he does not look for shelter. He becomes a beggar overnight and strangely finds success.  Vickers is ambushed on a  routine walk home to an abandoned courtyard, but is saved by a prostitute Tanya La Corse aka Maria Gabri-Colosso.

Renton's other friends, aggressive, alcoholic psychopath Francis \"Franco\" Begbie and honest footballer and recreational speed user Tommy Mackenzie, who abstains from heroin, warn him about his dangerous drug habit. Growing tired of his reckless lifestyle, Renton attempts to wean himself off heroin with a bare room, foodstuffs, and opium suppositories given by ill-reputed dealer Mikey Forrester; he also suffers a bout of diarrhoea and has to relieve himself in the dilapidated toilet of a betting shop. Realising he has defecated the suppositories into the toilet, he enters a surreal trance in which he plunges headfirst into the toilet to retrieve them.\nRenton attempts to lead a \"useful and fulfilling\" life away from heroin. This consists of him meeting Sick Boy in a park where he shoots a stranger's dog with an air gun, supplying Spud with amphetamine for a job interview that turns disastrous, and stealing a sex tape of Tommy and his girlfriend, Lizzy. At The Volcano nightclub, Renton notices that his cessation of heroin use has increased his libido. He seduces a girl named Diane Coulston, and they return to her apartment to have sex. The following morning, Renton is horrified to learn that she is below the age of consent and lives with her parents, whom Renton initially assumes are her flatmates. Diane threatens to report him to the police if he does not continue the relationship.\nAfter several unsuccessful attempts to return to society, Renton, Sick Boy and Spud relapse into heroin use; Tommy also begins to dabble in drug use after becoming depressed due to being dumped by Lizzy, thanks to the actions of an unknowing Renton.

Juliet is sequestered in her family's mansion, watched over by her abusive father Cappy, passive mother Ingrid, and overprotective cousin Tyrone, all the while being sexually satisfied by family servant Ness (Debbie Rochon).\nBoth Tromeo and Juliet are trapped in cases of unrequited love: Tromeo lusts for the big-bosomed, promiscuous Rosie; Juliet is engaged to wealthy meat tycoon London Arbuckle as prelude to an arranged marriage.\nIn the meantime, a bloody brawl between Murray and Sammy Capulet catches the attention of Detective Ernie Scalus, who gathers the heads of the two families together and declares that they will be held personally accountable for any further breaches of the peace. Almost immediately afterward, Monty and Cappy start threatening each other with weapons.

Eventually, Murray stands by Tromeo's side to try and defend his honor, but is fatally wounded by Tyrone's club as an example for anyone, besides Arbuckle, who dares to seduce Juliet.

Learning from the late Tyrone that Juliet has already became Tromeo's wife, Cappy suggests to Detective Scalus that the Ques should be evicted from Manhattan permanently due to their crimes against his family, and the Detective agrees to ensure that Tyrone's sacrifice won't be in vain on behalf of the Capulet family. Later, Cappy savagely beats Juliet into reconciling with Arbuckle, threatening to disown her if she doesn't. With the help of Cappy, Arbuckle accepts her re-proposal and the wedding date is set. \nEventually, Juliet goes into hiding with Father Lawrence, whom she recruited along with Tromeo, who was recently evicted from his home by Scalus along with the rest of his family.

Ingrid, married to Monty at the time, struck up an affair with Cappy, eventually birthing a son which Monty raised as his own.

Jo's estranged husband, Bill Harding, an ex-storm chaser turned TV weatherman, travels to Oklahoma with his fianc\u00e9, Melissa Reeves, a therapist, to ensure that Jo signs their divorce papers. Bill is excited that Jo has created \"Dorothy\", a capsule-like device containing hundreds of small weather sensors that he conceptualized, but never saw realized. Dorothy could revolutionize tornado research and potentially provide an earlier storm-warning system, but the device must be deployed dangerously close to a tornado to work. Jo's team rushes off to chase a developing storm, forcing Bill and Melissa to follow in Bill's new truck when Jo leaves with the unsigned papers.\nAlong the way, Bill encounters Jonas Miller, a rival storm chaser and former colleague with corporate funding who stole Bill's idea for a Dorothy-like device.

When Dr. Krane learns human trials are many years away, he says he would volunteer to try the serum, but Dr. Briggs refuses.\nLater that evening Krane retrieves the sample of CSF from his wife's autopsy, and then breaks into Dr. Briggs' office. He then goes back to his house which is filled with crime scene photos. Krane injects himself with the serum, and has a memory flash of the night of his wife's murder, but is unable to see the killer's face. Krane then returns to the lab, retrieves the CSF from the female victim at the drug store. Krane drives to the drug store where he then injects himself, again, with the serum. Krane is finally able to see the killer's face. He then meets with a police sketch artist and tries to create a sketch of the killer. Krane and his friend and colleague, Curtis Avery (David Paymer), enter the sketch into a computer program that generates a searchable photo of the killer.\nDr. Briggs then confronts Krane about the break in and the theft of her serum. He explains that it works and that you experience the memory as if it were happening to you. Dr. Briggs is worried about side effects and gives Krane a physical, noting that there has been \"significant\" damage to Krane's heart. Curtis says they got a hit on the photo, identifying the suspect as Eddie Dutton.  Dutton has a long criminal history, including drugs and several murders for hire. Curtis gives Krane Eddie's last known address.\nKrane and Dr. Briggs travel to the seedy motel where Eddie Dutton resides.  He soon sees Eddie in the elevator, and has an overreaction to seeing him. Krane runs down the stairs after Eddie. Dr. Briggs yells at Krane to stop as he is straining his heart. Krane pursues Eddie, who pulls out a gun and starts to fire at Krane. Eddie runs into an alley, where the two struggle and Krane ends up with Eddie's gun. Eddie runs into a Catholic church, and grabs a young boy, holding him hostage with a knife. Dr Krane tries to talk Eddie down when the police arrive. Eventually Det. Bresler fatally shoots Eddie, and Dr. Krane is upset because he did not get to question Eddie.\nDr. Krane is confronted about his erratic behavior by his supervisor who fires him. Krane and Dr. Briggs go to the Police station, where Krane sneaks into the autopsy room and steals a sample of Eddie's CSF.\nBack at his house, Krane injects himself with the serum, using Eddie's CSF. Krane has a flash of what appears to be Eddie having rough sex with a woman, who may be Mary. In the midst of the memory flashback Krane inadvertently begins to choke Dr. Briggs. During the flashback Dr. Krane sees that Eddie notices Krane returning to the house and Eddie flees, apparently before Mary is actually dead. Dr. Briggs finds Krane at the bottom of the porch stairs and administers the nitroglycerin to him. He explains that Eddie did not kill his wife, and that he had come home drunk that night and passed out in the front yard while his wife was being murdered. Krane opens up about how he was a drunk and the marriage was on the rocks. He mentions that when his wife died she was 5 weeks pregnant.\nThe next morning Dr. Briggs goes to Curtis and asks him to get a DNA sample from Krane. As Dr. Briggs is running the DNA for a paternity test, Krane walks in and is angry that she would test the paternity without consulting him. The paternity test shows the baby was not Krane's child.\nKrane rushes over and confronts Mary's sister Kelly (Kim Cattrall). They argue, and Kelly says that Mary was having an affair with a police detective. While talking to Det. Bresler about this new information, Krane begins to have flashbacks of an interrogation of Eddie. These flashbacks cause a heart attack and Krane is rushed to the hospital. Krane has flashbacks of the night and subsequent events of Mary's murder. While Krane and Dr. Briggs are at the hospital, an explosive device destroys Dr. Briggs office.\nAfter Krane recovers, Detective Stewart Gleick (Christopher McDonald) the original detective on Mary's case, approaches Krane in the hospital saying that a detective named Joseph Bodner may be the man with whom Mary was involved, thus making him the likely father of her unborn child. Detective Bodner tried to commit suicide on the same day Mary was killed, but ended up in a coma instead. Krane and Dr. Briggs go to the hospice where Det. Bodner is, and take a sample of his CSF. Krane and Dr. Briggs argue about who should take the injection. Krane says he is not taking any chances and he tapes Dr. Briggs to the seat and injects himself. He confirms that his wife was in fact having an affair with Bodner. Mary met Detective Bodner who was a witness against Detective Bresler, who is revealed to have been quite corrupt.\nAs Krane is reliving these memories, Detective Bresler arrives at the house and begins to set the scene to kill Krane and Dr. Briggs by lighting a fire. Kelly arrives at the house with Krane's kids, just as Bresler is about to kill them. Krane fights Bresler, beating him unconscious. Krane then pulls Dr. Briggs out of the house, and then rushes in to save Bresler. He then goes back into the burning house to retrieve the microcassette recorder that recorded Bresler's confession.\nThe movie ends with Krane in a coma. He imagines he is with his wife. Dr. Briggs explains that his wounds should heal, but he is not responding mentally. Det. Gleick tells Krane that they got Bresler. Dr. Briggs says he could snap out of his coma at any time. The scene then shifts to Krane imagining playing with his kids, he looks back over his shoulder and his wife turns and fades away.", "tmdb_plot": "Seattle medical examiner David Krane is obsessed with solving his wife's murder.

The show, a musical chronicling the town's history titled Red, White and Blaine, is to be performed as part of the town's 150th-anniversary celebration.\nCast in the leads are Ron and Sheila Albertson, married travel agents who are also regular amateur performers; Libby Mae Brown, a perky Dairy Queen employee; Clifford Wooley, a \"long time Blaineian\" and retired taxidermist, who is Red, White and Blaine's narrator; Johnny Savage, a handsome and oblivious mechanic, whom Corky goes out of his way to get into the play; and Dr. Allan Pearl, a tragically square dentist determined to discover his inner entertainer. High-school teacher Lloyd Miller is the show's increasingly frustrated musical director.\nCorky has used connections from his \"off-off-off-off-Broadway\" past to invite Mort Guffman, a Broadway producer, to critique Red, White and Blaine. Corky leads the cast to believe that a positive review from Guffman could mean their show might go all the way to Broadway.\nThe program itself is designed to musically retell the history of Blaine, whose founding father was a buffoon incapable of distinguishing the geography of middle Missouri from the Pacific coastline. The viewer also learns why the town obtusely refers to itself as \"the stool capital of the United States.\" The music is a series of poorly performed songs such as \"Nothing Ever Happens on Mars\", a reference to the town's supposed visit by an unidentified flying object, and \"Stool Boom\". (The DVD contains \"This Bulging River\" and \"Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine\", which were edited from the cinema release.)\nCentral to the film are Corky's stereotypically gay mannerisms. He supposedly has a wife called Bonnie, whom no one in Blaine has ever met or seen. He uses her to explain his habit of shopping for women's clothing and shoes.\nWhen Johnny is forced by his suspicious father to quit the show, Corky takes over his roles, which were clearly intended for a young, masculine actor, playing a lusty young frontiersman, a heartbroken soldier, and a little boy wearing a beanie and shorts. Corky never sheds his dainty demeanor, bowl haircut, lisp, or earring in spite of his historical roles, and his face is pasted with an overkill of stage rouge and eyeliner.\nCorky is also faced with creating his magic on a shoestring budget, at one point quitting the show after storming out of a meeting with the city council, which turns down his request for $100,000 to finance the production, but the distraught cast and persuasive city fathers convince Corky to return. At the show's performance, Guffman's seat is seen to be empty, much to the dismay of the cast. Corky reassures them that Broadway producers always arrive a bit late for the show, and sure enough, a man soon takes Guffman's reserved seat. The show is well received by the audience, whereupon Corky invites the assumed Guffman backstage to talk to the actors.\nThe man is actually Roy Loomis, who has come to Blaine to witness the birth of his niece's baby, but he did enjoy the show. Corky then reads a telegram stating that Guffman's plane was grounded by snowstorms in New York City, meaning that, like the \"Godot\" being spoofed, the real Guffman himself is destined never to arrive.\nAn epilogue shows the fates of the cast: Libby Mae is now living in Sipes, Alabama, where she moved after her father was paroled, and working at the Dairy Queen. Allan and the Albertsons have pursued their dreams of being entertainers, Ron and Sheila traveling to Los Angeles, California, to work as extras, and Allan now performing for elderly Jews in Miami, Florida retirement communities.

During his trial, Toad's defence lawyer is no help at all due to Toad's obnoxious attitude. Furthermore, the Weasels are dominating the public box. The Chief Weasel poses as one of the rabbits in the Jury and manipulates the Jury to give a guilty verdict. After Toad insults the Court and makes a botched escape attempt, the Judge gives him a hundred-year sentence in a castle dungeon.\nBack in Toad Hall, Rat and Mole are evicted by the Weasels, who have taken Toad Hall for themselves. Rat and Mole tunnel under the castle to free Toad, but he is helped by the kind-hearted Jailer's daughter and her sardonic Tea Lady Aunt. Toad escapes, disguised as the latter. Having left Toad's wallet in his cell, Toad, Rat, and Mole board an Engine No. 592, which is coupled to four coaches and pulls out, thanks to the engine driver's help of letting them ride on the footplate. The police, who have stowed away on the carriages behind the engine, demand that the train be stopped by waving furiously at Ratty, Moley, and the driver on the engine, much to Toad's fearing terror. As the engine goes to see what the police want and tries to stop the train, Toad confesses the truth and begs the driver to help him evade his captors about arresting him for stealing motorcars. Feeling sympathetic of what Toad says is true, the driver agrees to help as the police shoot the paint on his engine. Angered, he tosses coal from his engine's tender at the police, but fails to dodge a mail catcher, which catches him and ends up holding him from his train. Toad takes control of the train by pulling the accelerator to speed the engine up, and as Mole accidentally uncouples the coaches, he and Rat are left far behind with the coaches as the police hit a tunnel and hold on for dear life, Toad eventually derails the engine, and having survived the accident from the wreckage of the engine, sets off again, but is abducted by the Weasels.\nThe full extent of the Weasel's plans are now revealed: they have built a dog-food factory over the remains of Mole's abode and are planning to blow up Toad Hall and build a slaughterhouse in its place, with which they will turn all of the peaceful Riverbankers into dog food. They have also damaged the area near to Badger's home, which provokes him into wanting revenge against them. Badger and Rat attempt to infiltrate Toad Hall disguised as weasels, but are discovered. Along with Toad, they are placed over the factory's mincing machine. The Chief, Clarence and Geoffrey return to Toad Hall to prepare the victory celebration, leaving St. John in charge of the machine. Mole, who has broken into the factory, disables the machine allowing Toad, Badger and Rat to escape.\nIn a premature sense of victory, Clarence and Geoffrey attempt to murder their Chief using a birthday cake. Clarence and Geoffrey begin to fight each other for leadership, with the other Weasels drunkenly taking sides. This distraction allows the protagonists to stage a raid on the house, leaving all of the Weasels incapacitated in the ensuing fight. It turns out that the Chief has survived the coup against his life. Toad attempts to stop him from reaching the factory, which contains the detonator to blow up Toad Hall, to no avail. Unbeknownst to both of them, the explosives are actually in the factory (Rat had switched the labels on the explosive's containers earlier, leading the Weasels to believe the explosives were actually bone supplies for the factory), and as such the Chief blows himself up along with the factory, leaving Toad Hall intact and Toad's friends alive.\nAfterwards, Toad makes a public speech swearing off motor cars and promising to be more mature and less selfish in the future. Mole's home has been repaired. However, Toad is seen secretly talking to an airplane salesman, which shows that he has only moved on to a new craze. Toad flies over the crowd in his new plane, causing mass hysteria and a disappointed Badger swears never to help Toad again.

A man named Heenoc Xian (John Pyper-Ferguson), is reading his book when his concentration suddenly drifts away and he reminisces about his life in chronological order, from being a pilot during his Academy years, to a freedom fighter, and to eventually, a warlord. He recalls the latter with irony as he narrates the tale of those particular events of his life. It begins on the planet Caliban 5, ruled by none other than Warlord Heenoc Xian. A young man named Justin Thorpe (John Corbett), a petty thief who carves out a living for himself by trading items he obtained through stealing and salvaging, comes home one night to his battered, run-down house as he is greeted by his kid sister, Nova (J. Madison Wright), a precocious pre-teen. Their parents are revealed to be dead, and they are all that remains of their family. Their lives have a routine and their evenings usually end with Nova teaching Thorpe to read a chapter of a book each night. The two siblings have learnt to make the most of the situation and are content. However, one day, Thorpe returns from his morning routine and discovers that Nova has disappeared. Knowing his sister would never run away from home, Thorpe comes to the conclusion that she had been kidnapped, but does not know who the kidnapper is and why she was taken.\nFrantic and desperate, Thorpe turns to Warlord Xian for help. Despite his ominous title, Xian is not entirely a warmonger, considering his heroic past; he listens to his people and is sympathetic towards them, and has provided a reasonable amount of order and security in a chaotic world, despite the fact that some of the people under his rule have expressed a degree of ungratefulness and resentment towards him. He listens to Thorpe's grievance, and while he feels for him, he cannot help him because he does not have enough possessions to trade for Xian's services. With that, Thorpe leaves in anger but is suddenly met by Nova's best friend Maggi Sorenson (Elisabeth Harnois), a cute and cynical teenager who happens to be the granddaughter of General Lars Sorenson (played by veteran Australian actor Rod Taylor), a man who was a former soldier of the now extinct Galactic Republic. Maggi introduces her grandfather to Thorpe. Sorenson knows what Thorpe wants and offers to help him by searching for Nova using his starship, the Osiris. However, he informs Thorpe that he must help him first by applying his thieving skills to steal precious jewels from the Warlord Xian's treasure chest, so that he can pay someone to fix his ship. Thorpe and Maggi are nearly caught by the Warlord's henchmen, but they subdue them and eventually succeed in obtaining the goods from the treasure chest.\nBefore long, Thorpe, Sorenson, and Maggi arrive on a shuttlecraft to the Osiris, a sleek ship that resembles a shark, parked out in deep space. Once inside the ship, they bump into Thorpe's long-time friend, Wally Price (Darryl Theirse), a man who has \"really strong feelings\" but is not actually a telepath or a psychic. Sorenson is greatly puzzled about how he managed to get inside the Osiris, since the ship is genetically keyed. Wally convinces the gang that his extraordinary intuition will aid in Thorpe's search for Nova. All that remains now is for the ship to be repaired. Sorenson hires cloaked humanoid aliens, a race known only as \"The Engineers\" to repair the ship's engine. These beings have no interest in communicating with other lifeforms; the only thing they care for is technology. As soon as the ship is fixed, The Engineers leave.\nLater, Sorenson informs Thorpe that he has a vague idea of where Nova is being held captive. However, Sorenson has his own agenda for helping Thorpe: he wants to rebuild the old Republic and to do that he needs to find Trajan Cabel, the grandson of the last Proconsul, Julius Cabel. For this purpose he hires an Arbitrator, a diplomatic mercenary, who, to his surprise, turns out to be Rula Kor (Carolyn McCormick), Sorenson's daughter! She brings along her mute and beautiful bodyguard Jana (Marjorie Monaghan) for protection, should the need arise. Their surprise is magnified when she tells the men that The Engineers are the ones who are holding Nova prisoner. Sorenson then confesses to Thorpe that he knew all along that The Engineers were the ones who kidnapped Nova, but he did not want Thorpe to know beforehand because The Engineers were the only ones who knew how to fix the ship. Had he told Thorpe beforehand, the ship would have remained dead in space and they would have no way of rescuing Nova. Initially, Thorpe is peeved at Sorenson for misleading him, but Wally informs him that in spite of Sorenson's questionable agenda, he senses that his heart is in the right place. As a result, Thorpe and Sorenson make a pact to be upfront with each other from then on, and set a course to rescue Nova, based on Rula's reliable sources.\nMeanwhile, the Warlord is hell-bent on capturing Thorpe for stealing from him, and is hot on his trail in his battleship, the Daedalus. He chases Thorpe and his crew through a volcanic planet and fires on his ship with vengeance, but the Osiris escapes and finds itself face-to-face with a cloaked planet in deep space, the homeworld of The Engineers. They allow the crew of the Osiris to come down to their planet using the Osiris's teleportation system, known as a multi-spatial transverse system which works by folding space (a variation of a wormhole), after which they explain why they kidnapped Nova: she is a supergenius and they need her vast intellect for their Sublime Plenum, a huge amalgamation of their greatest ancestors\u2019 minds and souls, which turns out to be a grotesque exhibit of goo filled with countless bodies mixed together with tentacles, its aim: to eliminate all emotion and the concept of family. The crew of the Osiris does not stand for this, especially Thorpe. Rula makes The Engineers an offer in exchange for Nova's life, but they refuse. With that, Thorpe snatches Nova from the clutches of The Engineers, only managing to convince her to leave by stressing the need for family and love. The crew make it back to the Osiris, but Nova is grabbed away at the last minute while the Osiris faces another attack by the Daedalus. However, Sorenson offers Xian a truce and allows him to come on board the Osiris to explain the current crisis. When Xian learns of The Engineers\u2019 plan, he offers his services. With Xian's help, they destroy the Sublime Plenum, leaving The Engineers in defeat and rescue Nova again, this time with success. \nDuring all this, Sorenson discovers that Xian is the man he has been looking for all along: he is Trajan Cabel, the man who is destined to help rebuild the old Galactic Republic. However, Xian is not thrilled about the idea; he was greatly opposed to the formation of a new Republic, which is why he left his former life, changed his name to Heenoc Xian, and became a warlord. In spite of this, Xian decides to help Thorpe rebuild the Galactic Republic with new ideals and values. Sorenson steps down as General and gives Thorpe the Osiris for him to command with Nova at his side, Maggi as his pilot/navigator, Wally as the computer expert, Rula as an arbitrator, and Jana as chief of security. As for Xian, he remains on the Daedalus but provides his expertise in strategy and war tactics to Thorpe, acting as his counsel. With the Osiris and Daedalus as the only relics of the Old Galaxy Republic, it is a new beginning for humanity's reemergence to the stars.", "tmdb_plot": "The time is the 21st century, after the fall of the Galactic Republic.
