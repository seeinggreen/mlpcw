Every day, Jake and his friends gather with the rest of the school outside of Timmy's house, where he chooses ten kids to play in his basement. Timmy even ends up getting the NES Power Glove, only to discover that the product is a bit of a joke.\nTired of pandering to Timmy for access to the coveted Nintendo, Jake dreams of getting his own system for Christmas and approaches his distracted mom and forever DIYing dad about getting one for the holidays, only to be shut down on the basis that video games are bad for your brain, and he should play outside more.\nJake's quest for a Nintendo intensifies after Timmy angrily destroys his TV after losing a game, seriously injuring his family's dog.

The night exists between real and unreal, their struggle to stop the resurrection of the demon has begun!\"About two and half millennium ago (2,500 years), a monster crossed the bridge from hell to the human realm to create human suffering. Buddha ripped both the Red Eye and the Black Eye from the monster and locked them inside different \u015aar\u012bra caskets. Before the Red Eye surrendered to Buddha, it ran away for seven days by hiding inside human bodies. On the 8th day, the Red Eye looked back. Knowing that it could not escape Buddha, it surrendered itself. The Eyes were buried in the cliffs of the Far East and the desert of the Far West.  Buddha instructed his disciples to make sure they would never meet.\nIn the present, Professor Kim Joon-Cheol (Choi Jin-ho) sets out in the desert to prove the existence of the \u015aar\u012bra caskets. He finds a relic which is presumed to be one of the caskets. However, the scientific community declares his findings to be fraudulent, and he is shunned by all. Fourteen years later, Professor Kim, now a bitter individual, is determined to prove the truth of his discovery by reuniting the Black Eye and Red Eye. He opens the casket and pours a vial of blood into it along with his own. Before Professor Kim is about to give up, the Red Eye emerges from the casket, presumably possessing Professor Kim.\nIn Gwangju, Bhante Ha-jung (Lee Eol), protector of the Black Eye casket, realizes the Red Eye has reawakened. He tells a young monk, Cheongseok (Nam Da-reum), the legend of the monster with two eyes. Later that night, Bhante Ha-jung tells Cheongseok that the Red Eye has awakened and will soon reunite with the Black Eye. They must slay at least the seventh pillar, the Virgin Shaman, to prevent the Red Eye from reuniting with the Black Eye. Cheongseok must find Bhante Seon-hwa (Lee Sung-min) and inform him of the situation. The following morning, Cheongseok finds Bhante Ha-jung dead, who presumably died in his sleep. Cheongseok finds the \u015aar\u012bra casket beside the dead monk.\nMeanwhile, in Chilgok, the Red Eye takes over a hunter and goes into a motel where a couple was seen checking in. The woman tells her boyfriend about a meditation group where she was given a free health check-up and a blood test. The hunter presumably attacks the couple who checked into the secluded motel. Detectives Kim Ho-Tae and Dong-jin investigate the scene and find the hunter's body dried and decomposed after just a few hours. Cameras show that the woman was seen leaving the hotel. Later on, the very same woman is found in another location, her body found in a similar state as that of the hunter's. Due to the bizarre condition of the two victims, Dong-jin suggestes the help of a virgin shaman that he knows. However, being a skeptic, Kim refuses the idea.\nCheongseok leaves Gwanju in search for Bhante Seon-hwa. Unfortunately, he had lost his bag containing the casket and some money. He presumed that it was taken by a young girl (Kim Yoo-Jung) who disappeared into the crowd. Cheongseok finds Seon-hwa, who is now a construction worker using his real name, Park Jin-soo, and tells him (via writing, due to his vow of silence) of what happened in Gwanju. In his flashbacks, it is revealed by Ha-jung's spirit that Seon-hwa left the monastery as he didn't want to be Ha-jung's successor. Seon-hwa also neglected his duty of 'helping lost souls ascend', so their countless souls are clinging to his back. The following morning, Seon-hwa prepares to leave and search for the seventh pillar with Cheongseok following him. Seon-hwa presumes that the seventh pillar is the Virgin Shaman with which the monks of Gwanju are acquainted. Seon-hwa treats Cheongseok well, even buying him a new pair of shoes. Cheongseok thanks Seon-hwa, accidentally breaking his vow of silence.\nMeanwhile, the Red Eye had already planned to move on from the woman at the motel. A delivery man answers her call as both of them were members of a 'meditation group'. The Red Eye then passes onto the delivery man, and later, Detective Kim is called to see the body of a woman stuffed in a sewer. The woman is also found decomposed and drained like the first two victims. A motorcycle and delivery cargo is also found abandoned nearby. \nBefore boarding the bus, Seon-hwa was visited again by Ha-jung's spirit. It is revealed that Cheongseok's mother accidentally ran over Seon-hwa and his wife and daughter. His wife and child died, compelling Seon-hwa to live a life as a monk in Gwanju. When Cheongseok's mother died, she wrote a letter to Seon-hwa asking him to adopt Cheongseok. Seon-hwa does so, but leaves him in Gwanju. He then left the monastery and his duties, never becoming an ordained monk. As they arrived, Seon-hwa tells Cheongseok to search for shaman services around the area, hoping to find the Virgin Shaman. Upon learning of the recent bizzare murder, Seon-hwa goes to the tunnel where the woman and delivery motorcycle was found. Detective Kim stops him, asking for Seonhwa's credentials and ran his ID for any criminal records. When Kim asks Seon-hwa to open his bag, which contained an axe, Seonhwa tried to run away. The two got into a scuffle, and Seonhwa was forced to leave his map.\nCheongseok finds the house of the Virgin Shaman, and a young woman lets her in. She was the same young woman who took his belongings, but Cheongseok grew fond of her. Cheongseok leaves, but as soon as he stepped outside, he sees a student staring at him. The student revealed the Red Eye, being the sixth pillar. Cheongseok runs away in fear, and meets with Seon-hwa to inform him of what happened. Seonhwa tells Cheongseok to go back home, and reveals that he has to kill the young woman who he believes to be the seventh pillar and the Virgin Shaman. They go on their separate ways, but Cheongseok went back to the Virgin Shaman and took the Virgin Shaman away. Meanwhile, Dong-jin informs Kim of Seon-hwa's past. They were also able to connect the victims together. They were all members of a meditation group that Prof. Kim had set up, and Dong-jin had actually went to see one of them who was still alive--a woman who was the same Virgin Shaman Cheongseok unknowingly went to. Dong-jin had a talisman with his own blood made, thanks to the Virgin Shaman he met earlier, and gives it to Kim. It turns out that Kim saved Dong-jin from committing suicide, and he was indebted to Kim. Kim had Dong-jin leave while he uses Seonhwa's map to see if he could track down Seonhwa. \nSeonhwa finds the house of the Virgin Shaman, but the lady inside points to a note. When Seon-hwa confronts the lady, she strapped her face with talismans and Seonhwa prepared to strike her down. Detective Kim arrives in time to stop him, and the two squared off once more. Before Kim handcuffed Seonhwa, the possessed student arrived and threw him away, with the talisman he got from Dong-jin protecting him from further harm. The student realizes that the young woman had already left, and Seonhwa follows her, inscribing a talisman on his axe using his own blood. However, the student runs into Dong-jin, tricking the young detective to protect her from Seon-hwa. She possesses Dong-jin, and dries and decomposes. Dong-jin doesn't kill Seon-hwa, but tells him to head back to Gwanju, where he will die. \nMeanwhile, Cheongseok took the young woman to Gwanju, and Seon-hwa and the possessed Dong-jin arriving later. Detective Kim went back to the Virgin Shaman's house, and it is revealed that the lady who nearly died was the actual Virgin Shaman, and that the young woman Cheongseok was with is actually a ghost that she found living with Professor Kim. The real Virgin Shaman reveals that her name was Ae-ran, who was an abused child that was saved by Professor Kim. Professor Kim had groomed her to be the sacrifice that will assist the monster from reuniting its two Eyes. Professor Kim also tricked the members of the meditation group into donating their blood, via the 'free blood tests', in order to use their blood to summon the Red Eye, and later becoming the seven stepping stones. Ae-ran latched onto the Virgin Shaman, and she used her to trick Dong-jin into giving his own blood, so he could be possessed later on. It was also this Virgin Shaman, possessed by Ae-ran, who took the casket Cheongseok was carrying days ago. Detective Kim leaves to Gwanju in search for Dong-jin.\nSeon-hwa finds Cheongseok in an abandoned shack, and the young monk realizes that he was all alone from the start, with the casket being in his possession. Seon-hwa instructs Cheongseok of their plan to trap Dong-jin, let the Red Eye possess him instead, and Cheongseok delivering the killing blow. The plan goes well, and they managed to trap Dong-jin inside. However, Dong-jin revealed that Ae-ran, nor the Virgin Shaman, weren't the seventh pillar he needed. Ae-ran's purpose was to bewitch the seventh pillar, Cheongseok. Because Seon-hwa left the monastery and didn't become Ha-jung's successor, the title was transferred to Cheongseok. This meant that only Cheongseok has the ability to open the casket containing the Black Eye. Dong-jin orders the ghost of Ae-ran to find Cheongseok, who was hiding nearby. Still bewitched, Ae-ran was able to remove Cheongseok's robe, which had a talisman Seon-hwa made. Dong-jin orders Seon-hwa to shoot himself for being such a failure in life, but Seon-hwa shoots Dong-jin instead, though futile.\nCheongseok runs away from the possessed Dong-jin, and encounters Detective Kim. Detective Kim tries to stop Dong-jin but was again thrown violently to the side, once again protected by Dong-jin's talisman in his pocket. Seon-hwa manages to shoot Dong-jin's weak left leg. but Dong-jin crawls to Cheongseok in pursuit. Seon-hwa delivers a killing blow to Dong-jin's back, but he got shot by Detective Kim. Detective Kim goes over to Dong-jin, but his corpse dried and decomposed. The Red Eye has successfully possessed Cheongseok, and it throws Detective Kim onto a sharp branch, killing the Detective. As the Black Eye materializes, the Red Eye grabs the dying Seon-hwa. It transforms itself to a young version of Cheongseok, and torments Seon-hwa into strangling the young boy, seeing as his mother was the cause of his family's deaths. However, Seon-hwa persists, caressing the young boy's cheek. The Red Eye reverts back to the grownup Cheongseok, and was about to kill Seon-hwa with the axe. Seon-hwa traps Cheongseok's arm while chanting a spell. As he was caressing Cheongseok's face, he was actually writing another talisman using his own blood onto Cheongseok's face. This forced the Red Eye to possess Seon-hwa, and he asks Cheongseok to kill him. Cheongseok gathers the courage to do so, killing Seon-hwa and stopping the reunion of the Red Eye and Black Eye in the process.\nCheongseok is later seen in the border of India and Pakistan, and returns the casket back to where it was first unearthed. Ae-run appears before him, and Cheongseok offers up his hand. As Ae-run's spirit grabs Cheongseok's hand, the chains on her ankles were unchained, presumably freeing her.", "tmdb_id": 604360}, "53965522": {"title": "12 'O' Clock (film)", "plot": "The film opens with the murder of a pedestrian by an old lady at night which remains unresolved.

Richards lofts the ball in the air for a six but results in getting caught out by Kapil Dev.\nThe film then shifts to 30 May 1983 at the BCCI office in Mumbai where the BCCI officials get an invitation to the Cricket World Cup. Sunil Gavaskar is dropped from captaincy and Kapil Dev is made the captain. The cricketers who are in the squad namely Dev, Mohinder Amarnath, Kirti Azad, Madan Lal, and Sunil Valson are already there in England playing County Cricket.\nAlong with the team manager PR Man Singh, the rest of the team which includes Gavaskar, Krishnamachari Srikkanth, Syed Kirmani, Sandeep Patil, Dilip Vengsarkar, Yashpal Sharma, Roger Binny, Ravi Shastri and Balwinder Singh Sandhu reach London where they witness the West Indies Cricket Team the two-time World Cup winners, being hounded by photographers at the airport. After they reach the hotel they join the rest of their teammates.\nThe team fails horribly during the four warm-up matches which leads to doubts being raised about the performance of the Indian team in the Group Stage of the World Cup itself. During the press conference, Dev confidently tells the reporters that his team is here to win. During a training session of the West Indies team, the Indian team witnesses their four deadly fast bowlers namely Michael Holding, Andy Roberts, Malcolm Marshall, and Joel Garner who were known for delivering deadly bouncers to the batsmen. At the ceremony in Buckingham Palace, the Queen wishes the teams luck and the teams proceed for a group photograph. On the way back to their hotel on the bus, Dev gives an inspirational speech during the team meeting in accentuated English.\nThe World Cup starts with India being placed in Group B alongside the strong teams Australia and West Indies. Zimbabwe who turns out to be making their World Cup debut is also placed in the same group. India unexpectedly win their first match against West Indies by 34 runs at Old Trafford, Manchester with Yashpal Sharma being the Player of the Match for his contribution of 89 runs (which was also the highest individual score put up by an Indian cricketer at that time). \nThe teammates later celebrate at a bar that night. They also manage to win their next match against Zimbabwe by 5 wickets at Grace Road, Leicester thereby leading to the rise in the expectations of the Indian fans. Patil scores a half-century and Madan Lal is named as the Player of the Match. \nHowever, the team becomes over-confident and loses their next match against Australia by a huge margin of 162 runs. Dev is disappointed with the team's performance, especially with Roger's performance, and Gavaskar is unable to play due to his leg injury.\nWith Gavaskar's absence, the following match with West Indies turns out to be a brutal one as in the first innings, Viv Richards thrashes out the Indian bowlers severely thereby making a score of 119 runs off 146 deliveries. The second innings seems to be more violent when Malcolm Marshall bowls deadly bouncers to the Indian batsmen and one of the bouncers hits Dilip Vengsarkar on his chin, injuring him. Mohinder Amarnath puts up a score of 80 runs by bravely facing the bouncers but India lose the match by 66 runs. \nThe morale of the team is shattered. It is further shattered as Vengsarkar is ruled out from remaining World Cup matches due to his injury which resulted in seven stitches. The disheartened team in the bus is stuck on the route because of the West Indies crowd celebrating and blocking the way. However, they see a young Indian boy waving a homemade Indian flag which moves the team to tears and raises their spirits.\nThe next match against Zimbabwe on 18 June at Trent Bridge, Nottingham is a do-or-die one as India will be eliminated from the tournament if they lose. The wives of the cricketers also turn up to show their support as it is thought to be their last match. Gavaskar is back in the team recovering from his injury. India opens up with a shaky start, making 9 runs at the cost of 4 wickets. Dev steps in a hurry onto the field without the helmet as he was taking a shower. While walking to the pitch he sees the disheartened Indian crowd. He then starts scoring runs but the wickets keep falling. During the lunch break, Dev takes out the Mongoose bat which enables him to hit more powerful shots and gives a better counterattack to the bowlers. He then starts hitting boundaries continuously. Dev then makes a world record of 175 runs (which was previously 171 runs made by Glenn Turner in the 1975 World Cup) and is received with a standing ovation from the crowd and the umpire. India makes a score of 266 runs which Zimbabwe fail to achieve which leads to India winning the match by 31 runs and also retaining their place in the tournament.\nA party is held by the High Commissioner in which all the team members show up except for Binny who does not turn up because he is disappointed by Dev constantly chiding him for his bowling performance during net practice. At the party, Srikkanth jokes around and humorously tells the crowd that Dev had gone mad because he told them that they would beat the West Indies which is the strongest team in the cricketing world, but then he says that he has faith in his captain and he would only go home with winning the World Cup.\nThe final Group Stage Match with Australia at County Ground, Chelmsford on 20 June is an easy win for India as they win by a huge margin of 118 runs with Binny being the Player of the Match for his contribution of taking 4 wickets, praises Captain. India qualifies for the semi-final and this creates a wave of excitement across the country as India managed to qualify for the semi-final for the first time. The Prime Minister Indira Gandhi orders her ministry to ensure that every town and village in the country gets a television service so that the semi-final match can be broadcast. \nBefore the semi-final, Sandhu is disappointed as his engagement with his fianc\u00e9e Simran has been called off because of his living conditions and low salary. This affects his performance in the semi-final.\nDuring the semi-final with England, Amarnath and Kirti Azad choke off England's supply of runs by taking wickets. Azad takes the wicket of Ian Botham in which the ball surprisingly spins low towards the ground. England is restricted to a score of 213 all out. In the second inning Amarnath and Sharma build up runs for India, however, Amarnath is run out. During the partnership of Dev and Patil when 4 runs are needed to win, there is a premature invasion on the field by Indian fans. This causes the English captain Bob Willis to set his fielders on the left side so that they can escape if there is another invasion. Patil hits a four and India qualifies for the finals of the 1983 World Cup. Amarnath is named the Player of the Match.\nThis creates further excitement back in India as this win was seemed as unexpected one. On 25 June at Lords, India faces the West Indies again for the final with the latter winning the toss and choosing to bowl. In the beginning, Indian batsmen are restricted severely by the bowlers with Gavaskar getting dismissed for 1 run, but Srikkanth aggressively scores 38 runs making him the highest scorer for the Indian team. However, the team is all out for 183 making it the lowest score in the World Cup final. Dev inspires his team to restrict the West Indies batsmen from scoring runs. \nThe team steps onto the field with a rousing reception in the common room. In the second inning, Sandhu takes the wicket of Gordon Greenidge which gives India a lead. However, Richards launches a barrage of boundaries especially when Madan Lal is bowling. Madan Lal asks Dev to let him bowl another over as Richards underestimates him and Dev gives him another over to bowl. He bowls to Richards and Richards lofts in the air for six (as shown in the opening sequence of the film) but is caught out by Dev. This proves to be the turning point of the match. With Richards dismissed, the wickets of West Indies fall rapidly with Amarnath taking 3 wickets. When West Indies are 9 wickets down, Amarnath bowls to Holding who's the last batsman. Holding misses it and the ball hits his pads. Amarnath and the whole team appeal for the dismissal and Holding is given out leading to India winning the World Cup. The squad rushes towards the dressing room and the jubilant crowd rushes over on the ground and celebrations begin all over the country. A young Sachin Tendulkar back in Mumbai makes a promise that he would play for the Indian cricket team. Amarnath is named Player of the Match and Dev lifts the trophy along with the Indian team.\nAs the credits roll, the real Kapil Dev is shown sharing his experience of winning the World Cup along with a montage of vintage photographs of the team.", "tmdb_id": 601337}, "69990118": {"title": "100 (2021 film)", "plot": "Vishnu is an honest Inspector, who is living with his family- his mother, younger sister Hima and wife Anagha where he is also involved in benami  dealings.

However, they are unable to follow up as Pallavi chastises Sanjeev for going in search of his past and not paying attention to their daughter.\nThe suspect of the police sketch turns out to be Sanjeev and Vishnu arrests him despite having no other evidence. However, Pallavi and Yasir were able to prove his innocence by showing the CCTV footage of the hospital at the time of the kidnapping and proving his alibi.

The family later stops in Sleepy Hollow, New York. Gomez and Morticia bring up Mustela and his claims about Wednesday, so Fester mentions a story when he visited Wednesday the day she was born and juggled babies in the delivery room. This only worsens Gomez and Morticia's fears that Wednesday may not be their biological child, which Wednesday overhears.\nGomez brings everyone to Miami to get in touch with Cousin Itt, in hopes he can help with their current dilemma. Itt joins them on the trip as they pass through San Antonio and leaves the family early at the Grand Canyon. Meanwhile, Wednesday traps Mustela in a rope trap on her own and learns he is working for Cyrus before \"letting him go\". Cyrus suggests to Wednesday that he is her true father and invites her to his home in Sausalito, California. Wednesday runs a DNA test using Gomez's hair, which seemingly proves that she is not his daughter. Wednesday leaves the family while they sleep, but Lurch catches up with her. The rest of the Addams learn where she is heading and follow suit.\nAt his home, Cyrus shows Wednesday a formula he developed to make human\u2013animal hybrids, similar to Wednesday's experiment. When the rest of the Addams family shows up, Wednesday is persuaded to stay with Cyrus. After Pugsley finds out that Cyrus' daughter Ophelia is a pig, Cyrus reveals he is using Wednesday, as her formula was better than his. He captures the family to test on them, but Wednesday refuses to do so. Cyrus tries to get Pongo to go after her, but it is revealed Lurch and Pongo knew each other before while in a mental asylum, and they decide to free the Addams. Cyrus comes into contact with his formula during the scuffle and turns into a hybrid monster. The now-completely insane doctor tries to kill the family, but is stopped by Fester, who has fully mutated into a squid monster. After the two fight, Cyrus falls off a cliff to his death. Fester is turned back to normal by Wednesday, using a necklace of her family's blood that Morticia gave her earlier.\nWednesday reunites with her family and they return home along with Pongo and Ophelia, the latter of whom has become fully human following contact with Wednesday's formula and falls in love with Pugsley. While Wednesday knew that Cyrus faked his DNA test results, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that he wears a toup\u00e9e after losing his original hair in a napalm accident.

Spending most of her days withdrawn from society, Jina watches TV dramas in her apartment and mukbang videos during commutes or while eating out alone.\nOne day, coming home from work, Jina notices a woman pacing in front of her apartment, talking to police officers. After inquiring as to why she's distressed, the woman scolds her for not noticing that a recent loud noise Jina heard some days prior was the sound of her neighbour getting crushed to death by a pile of adult magazines. This confuses Jina, as she recalls him showing her a trick with a matchstick and a cigarette outside of his apartment shortly after he supposedly died. In the evening she eventually reads an illustrated article about his deadly misadventure on her phone.\nThe following Monday Jina's boss, on orders from the human resources department of the company, asks her to train a new employee, who happens to be a young girl called Sujin. Despite a higher pay, Jina accepts reluctantly, both her and the boss knowing she's not a perfect fit for the task and that her indisposition to normal company affairs is lost performance.\nSujin's training is indeed not without problems, as she's clumsy and overly dependant on Jina. She ends her first morning's shift while falling asleep and does not seem to develop a mindset apt to the workplace, struggling to hold conversations on the phone or answering to clients in an improper way.\nAn irritated Jina starts avoiding her even more often than before after each shift, and as a result Sujin stops coming into work; Jina's boss is open to the possibility of her returning, but comments that any new development wouldn't probably change the fact that she is not going to be hired, being unable to pass her initial training. Jina eventually tosses Sujin's belongings in an office bin and disposes of her chair and headset.\nIn the meantime, Jina keeps an eye on her father through a wireless home camera she set up in her parents' house. She sees him inviting his new church's members (which could be from an actual Korean Protestant church, a Presbyterian one, or a cult after his testament money posing as such) to eat in his company, him standing by himself in the bathroom where his wife died, or trying out dance steps in the living room. Jina also meets Seong-hun, a man with a broken leg who's planning to move into her late neighbour's apartment with his family after the death caused the owner of the flat \u2013 which happens to be the woman who previously berated Jina for being too selfish \u2013 to lower the rent's asking price.\nUpon returning to work for the week, Jina is more emotional than usual and starts showing the same signs of stress that Sujin experienced. One of the regular callers to her job, who requests all of her monthly spendings to be read to her, raises her voice on the phone and threatens to file a report to the company, asking for Jina's name. Breaking down, Jina briefly zones out before deciding to leave the building.\nOn a corner on the way to her house, Jina calls her father, screaming at him and demanding he apologizes to her and her mother. This causes him to abruptly hang up and temporarily block Jina's number. Feeling defeated, she crouches by a street light until the evening before going back to her apartment, as her new neighbour is finalising the move in the vacant apartment. A possible problem with the cabling some of the moving company employees could have caused during the move interferes with Jina's TV's signal, much to her annoyance and prompting her to call Seong-hun to ask him to fix the problem when he can.\nThe following day, Jina decides to wind down. She asks her boss for a leave of absence and calls Sujin, apologising for her cold behaviour as a superior at her job, making her cry.

She urges him to continue the revolution after the two have sex. To build a strong team, Washington teams up with beer loving party animal Samuel Adams and they recruit equestrian champion but socially awkward Paul Revere.

Edison, thanks to the power of science, manages to use the British weapons against them, turning tea into beer. When the beer rain falls, the British transform into bros, and it also cures Martha who had been turned British prior to the battle, changing her into a living Statue of Liberty.

Sharyn witnesses a man with bleeding eyes being led through the hallway outside and hears Everett being attacked in his room. Sharyn is visited by Dr. Hellenbach, who asks Sharyn whether she has any regrets. Sharyn lies and says she does not. Sharyn begs to go home, but Dr. Hellenbach says that she is not ready. Sharyn is introduced to several other patients, including Cassandra Franklin; Rizzo; Marjorie, whose eyelids are paralyzed; Lester, who is criminally insane; and Everett, a criminal attorney. Everett reveals that his tongue was cut out but grew back. Cassandra tells Sharyn that they are in an experimental facility and that she had been burned alive.\nRizzo is selected for an experimental procedure during the \"Indexing\" and reveals to Sharyn that he had been impaled. Sharyn observes Dr. Hellenbach administering a healing serum to Rizzo and asks why this was done to him. Dr. Hellenbach ominously tells Sharyn that \"he did this to himself.\"\nDr. Hellenbach finds Sharyn wandering around the halls and takes her to his office. In exchange for a phone call to her family, Sharyn agrees to tell Dr. Hellenbach about her ex-boyfriend, Nico, a drug trafficker who committed suicide. Sharyn attempts to make a phone call but finds that the phone does not work. Sharyn begins wandering the halls again and finds a room containing a piano and a noose.

He tells his family that his brother, Wu Baili, was killed in action. Having been allotted land for his service, he promises his parents he will build them a house. However, the People's Republic of China enters the Korean War and his leave is canceled. Qianli's younger brother, Wanli, asks to go with him, but Qianli tells him not to.\nThe film jumps to 15 September 1950, where the Battle of Incheon is underway. Captions state that on 7 July 1950 General MacArthur \"announced war on North Korea\" and that \"the U.S. air force carpet-bombed the total terrain of the enemy\". The film makes no mention of the North Korean invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950. U.S. aircraft are then shown indiscriminately bombing a village in Andong Province, China, north of the Yalu River.\nThe film then jumps to Beijing on 4 October 1950 where the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party is meeting in Zhongnanhai to discuss the situation in North Korea. Mao Zedong asks whether the U.S. Army crossing the 38th parallel means they will also cross the Yalu (the China\u2013North Korea border). The military briefer states that by stationing forces in Taiwan, the U.S. has already invaded China and that the buildup of U.S. forces in Korea threatens China's security. Early the next morning, Peng Dehuai visits Mao. Mao tells Peng that he doesn't want war, but that he will fight to protect the Chinese Communist Revolution. Mao's eldest son Mao Anying asks Peng if he can join the People's Volunteer Army forces being sent to Korea and Mao gives his blessing.\nThe 7th Company is instructed to deliver communications supplies to the front lines. To Qianli's horror, Wanli enlisted in the army despite his family's wishes. Wanli gets bullied by the other members of the 7th Company en route to Korea, with Qianli refusing to help him. When Qianli refuses to give him a gun, Wanli almost jumps out of the troop train in anger but is mesmerized by the sight of the Great Wall of China. After Wanli stands by the train door all night, Qianli decides to give him a rifle.\nThe troop train is bombed while the train track is being fixed, forcing the 7th Company to continue on foot. They have several close encounters with American aircraft along the way. While attempting to cross a dried-up lake, the 7th Company comes across patrolling American aircraft. The soldiers pretend to be dead but the American pilots decide to shoot the \"stiffs\" on a bet. Several members of the company are killed in the strafing, including Zhang Xiaoshan, a young soldier who had befriended Wanli.\nThe 7th Company stumble upon a battle in which they aid a group of Chinese soldiers and storm an American outpost, killing numerous American soldiers and destroying several tanks. Wanli and Qianli kill four American soldiers in hand-to-hand combat. An American tank tries to run over Wanli and Qianli, but the Chinese soldiers kill its crew and commandeer the tank. The battle ends in a tank duel, in which the Chinese infantrymen win. The 7th Company continues to the front lines, eventually arriving and delivering field radios.\nThe 7th Company is allowed to rest. Mao Anying, serving under the pseudonym \"Liu\", helps distribute clothing to them, but shortly after the company is ordered back to the front lines in anticipation of an offensive on American positions. The Chinese soldiers stay hidden in the mountains, running low on supplies and facing below-freezing temperatures. The film shows American soldiers celebrating Thanksgiving in relative comfort and anticipating going home for Christmas.\nU.S. radio detection detects Peng Dehuai's headquarters and aircraft are sent to bomb the base. While most of the staff take shelter in bunkers, Mao Anying runs back to the base to collect a map and is killed in the bombing.\nThe offensive begins on the night of 27 November, with Chinese soldiers swarming the positions of the U.S. Army 31st Infantry Regiment at Sinhung-ni. One Chinese soldier kills three Americans in hand-to-hand combat, while several U.S. trucks and tanks are destroyed. The Americans begin to retreat; Qianli shoots the U.S. commander, Colonel Allan MacLean, wounding him, but then stops Wanli from executing him. At Hagaru-ri reinforcements are ordered to Sinhung-ni. A USMC Vought F4U Corsair attacks the Chinese forces and drops a smoke marker on the overrun base but is then shot down by a Chinese soldier using a bazooka. Lei Suisheng puts the smoke marker in a jeep and drives off, joining up with the retreating U.S. column. The U.S. bombers destroy the American column and Lei is killed.\nThe scene then cuts to Hagaru-ri which is under attack by the Chinese. U.S. forces are forced to retreat by air and land while they are pursued by Chinese forces. The scene then shifts again to the 3rd Company, 3rd Division, 58th Corps on Hill 1071, which is shown holding out against U.S. forces, having previously repelled seven attacks, fighting to the last man. Yang Gensi, as the last surviving member of his unit, suicidally attacks American tanks with a satchel charge.\nThe retreating U.S. Marine column finds a group of Chinese soldiers frozen to death at their post. General Oliver P. Smith salutes them; his voiceover is heard saying that fighting against such strong-willed men, the U.S. was not ordained to win.\nThe closing scenes show a U.S. mass grave at Hungnam as the city burns during the Hungnam evacuation. Captions state that 105,000 U.S. troops were evacuated by 24 December and that the 9th Corps captured Hungnam. The captions explain the significance of the battle of Lake Changjin, which was a \"perfect example for annihilating a U.S. reinforced regiment\", how it, together with operations in the west, stopped MacArthur's \"presumptuous\" plan to end the war by Christmas and forced the U.S. led \"UN Command\" back from the Yalu River and below the 38th Parallel and \"set the stage for the final victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.\" The captions state that more than 197,000 Chinese died in the war.

April is killed in the accident, but while trapped in the wreck Beckett sees a boy being hurried out of the house by a blonde woman.\nThe next day Xenakis, a local police officer, interviews Beckett and tells him that he was lucky that the house he crashed into was abandoned; however Beckett tells Xenakis about seeing the boy and the woman. After leaving the police station, Beckett goes back to the house with the intention of killing himself, but before he can do so the blonde woman returns and shoots at him. Xenakis arrives soon after and tells him it is safe to come out of hiding, but after he reveals himself Beckett is wounded in the arm as both the woman and Xenakis shoot at him and give chase. Beckett jumps off a cliff and escapes.\nAfter spending the night in an abandoned truck, Beckett is found by a group of hunters who bring Beckett back to town, with one taking Beckett to his house to see to his injuries. Xenakis and the woman soon arrive and Beckett jumps out of a window to escape again. He happens upon two beekeepers who lend him a phone. He calls the U.S. embassy in Athens, but unable to wait for their help Beckett tells them he will make his own way to the embassy. He boards a train to go back to Athens, but Xenakis finds him and attempts to detain him, but Beckett pulls the train\u2019s emergency brake and in the ensuing struggle Xenakis ends up getting shot in the foot and Beckett once again escapes.\nBeckett sees posters of the boy being put up by two activists, Lena and Eleni. They tell him that the boy is Dimos Karras, the kidnapped son of a liberal politician who has been allegedly taken by a far-right organization. They drive Beckett to Athens but he is forced to part ways with them to avoid a police roadblock and takes the subway to the U.S. embassy, where he is attacked by a knife-wielding man. Managing to reach the embassy, he is taken in by embassy staffer Tynan, who informs him that April's body had been sent to the embassy, and Beckett is taken to the morgue to view her body.\nBeckett tells Tynan about Dimos' kidnappers and the activists, and Tynan offers to take him to an honest cop to sort things out. However after leaving the embassy, Tynan tries to incapacitate Beckett with a taser but he is able to escape. Beckett meets up with Lena and Eleni to warn them about Tynan, but he soon arrives with the police and chases Beckett to a political rally. Shots are fired at the rally and amongst the chaos Beckett takes refuge in a basement where he is cornered by Tynan, who tells him Dimos Karras' father has just been assassinated at the rally. Tynan reveals that Karras had secretly owed an organized crime syndicate money, who then kidnapped his son in retaliation but deflected the blame onto his political enemies, also implying that the U.S. had a role to play in the deception. Fearing that Beckett had uncovered the truth behind Dimos' kidnapping, they went after him. Although Tynan assures Beckett that with Karras dead he is now free to go, Beckett knocks him out.\nBeckett returns to the site of the rally to reunite with Lena and Eleni but sees the blonde woman who had kidnapped Dimos. He follows her to a parking garage, where she meets up with Xenakis with Dimos locked in the trunk of his car. Before they can escape, Beckett shoots Xenakis in the hand and struggles with the blonde woman. He is shot but manages to knock her out, then runs after Xenakis as he tries to drive away.

He assures her of her talent as a physical comedian, and she confides her dream of simply making a home with someone. They marry and buy a house in Hollywood, but struggle to spend time together, with Arnaz busy fronting his Desi Arnaz Orchestra while Ball continues her film career with little success.\nAfter serving in World War II, Arnaz resumes touring with his orchestra, and Ball lands a starring role in 1942's The Big Street. She meets with RKO President Charles Koerner, expecting to become an established star like Rita Hayworth and Judy Holliday. Instead, he terminates her contract, largely due to her age, and suggests she use her voice for radio. In 1948, she is cast in the radio show My Favorite Husband, which becomes a massive success.\nCBS suggests turning My Favorite Husband into a television show, sponsored by cigarette company Philip Morris. Hoping to bring her and Arnaz closer together, Ball agrees on the condition that he plays her on-screen husband; the executives initially refuse to have an \u201call-American\u201d star with a Cuban husband, but are forced to concede. By 1953, the show is renamed I Love Lucy and becomes a smash hit with nearly 60 million viewers each week.\nBall and Arnaz produce the show in Los Angeles through their company Desilu Productions, with a three-camera system designed by Arnaz allowing East Coast viewers to watch live without static, while accommodating a studio audience. Dealing with friction between her costars William Frawley, who is often drunk, and Vivian Vance, who resents Ball\u2019s attempts to make her less attractive, Ball clashes with the directors and writers over her exacting demands.\nWalter Winchell\u2019s radio program claims to have evidence of Ball\u2019s Communist ties, alarming I Love Lucy\u2019s crew that their show will be shut down. Ball admits to registering with the party when she was young and influenced by a relative, and Arnaz frustrates her by announcing that she innocently marked the wrong box. They inform the writers she is pregnant with their second child, planning to integrate this into future episodes, but executives refuse to allow even the word \u201cpregnant\u201d on the air.\nBall confronts her husband for often staying out late, but he proves that a tabloid photo of him with another woman was taken months ago. After Frawley suggests that Arnaz\u2019s behavior stems from feeling emasculated by Ball taking over many of the show\u2019s business and creative decisions, she asks Oppenheimer, the official showrunner, to help save her marriage. Instead of offering him a producer credit, Oppenheimer assures Arnaz he has top billing as the \"I\" in I Love Lucy, but he rejects the patronizing gesture. Arnaz reaches out to the head of Philip Morris directly, securing permission to introduce Ball\u2019s pregnancy into the show.\nThe night of filming a new episode, a newspaper article declares Ball a Communist, though she was cleared during an HUAC hearing. Arnaz addresses the studio audience about the accusations and takes a live call with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who confirms that Lucy was cleared of all charges. Celebrating backstage, Ball confronts Arnaz with a lipstick-stained handkerchief, which he claims is hers, but she shows him another handkerchief with her own lipstick, and he finally admits to his infidelity.\nAs filming begins, Ball momentarily loses her concentration, triggered by Arnaz's catchphrase \u2014 \u201cLucy, I\u2019m home\u201d.

The residents of the street set up a barricade to prevent further conflict and Pa returns home from England to check up on the family\u2019s wellbeing. The family attends church, where the minister delivers a harsh fork in the road speech; the rhetoric is continually reflected upon by Buddy throughout the film. Buddy develops feelings for a fellow high-achieving classmate, Catherine, a Catholic, and they eventually become friends.\nLocal criminal and sectarian rabble-rouser Billy Clanton approaches Pa demanding his involvement in \"the cause\"; when Pa refuses, he becomes aggressive and continues to incessantly approach Buddy. Meanwhile, the family struggles to pay off their accumulated tax bill. Pa dreams of emigrating to Sydney or Vancouver, a prospect met with distress from Ma. However, she can no longer deny the option of leaving Belfast as the conflict worsens and Pa is offered a promotion and housing deal in England from his employers. At Christmas, they attempt to discuss the matter with the boys, but Buddy breaks down at the thought of leaving.\nBuddy and his cousin Moira attempt to steal chocolates from a sweet shop, but the plan goes awry. When later questioned by the police, he does not reveal his co-conspirators. Following this, Moira recruits him into her local gang, who turn out to be Ulster loyalists that loot a supermarket during a riot. A reluctant Buddy is coerced into stealing a box of laundry detergent before he returns home and informs Ma of his activities.

During her briefing, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, frustrated at the lack of action taken on the matter, decides to allow a RAW agent code-named \"Bell Bottom\" to handle the case.

Anshul is given the offer to join RAW; he accepts and takes on the code-name Bell Bottom, with his cover to his wife being that he is an embassy officer. After his training, which showcases his extraordinary memory and improves his previously subpar physical skills, he is assigned to the hijacking desk. In 1983, he finds one of the hijackers while visiting his brother in London and tracks them; he raids their house with other RAW agents and captures three of them but the fourth, Doddy Singh, escapes.\nBack in the present, the plane takes off from Amritsar and lands in Lahore, prompting Gandhi to order Anshul back in. He convinces her to \"break script\" and disallow the Pakistani side to send their negotiating team, and orders them not to refuel the plane. In response, Zia sends his minister to keep track of the situation. In Lahore, the minister replaces the hijacker with Doddy and supplies weapons and explosives. Correctly figuring that they will go to the Middle East to take advantage of their naivety in aerial terrorism, Anshul prepares for a covert operation in Dubai against the Indian ministers' wishes. Meanwhile, the Pakistani minister goes to Dubai to observe what is going on and guide Doddy.\nUpon arrival, Anshul and his team, disguised as diplomatic aides, meet up with a contact in the Dubai airport, where they see Dubai's emphasis on humanitarianism and avoidance of bloodshed. Their first plan, covertly entering the aircraft and disarming the hijackers, is foiled when the Pakistani minister notices and closes the luggage door. Anshul's \"plan B\", sending in the Indian army, is also curtailed when the Dubai officials are notified and the ship they are on is denied entry. With all avenues cut off, the ministers go to negiotate; although they agree to the terrorists' demands of money, more terrorist releases, and a charter flight to London for freedom, they are surprised at the terrorists extreme inhumanity and one of them is taken hostage as a \"VIP\" target to be held until they get to London. Seemingly out of options, Anshul asks their airport contact to take them to an under-construction terminal so they can view the proceedings; however this is a ruse as Anshul reveals his knowledge of the contact's betrayal and ties her up. Disguising themselves as airport workers, they take advantage of a sandstorm to get on the field, free the VIPs, and capture the terrorists, redirecting the charter flight to India. The leader of Dubai denies them take off clearance at first, but after Anshul explains how their methods fit in with Dubai's humanism, he grants it. In India, the terrorists are booked, with Zia and the ISI leaders huffing in disgrace, and the flight is returned, with all on board safe and sound and reunited with their families.

One of his first duties is to drive a prisoner transport vehicle at night. He will be partnered with Officer Montesino during the transfer of six prisoners. During the strip search of the prisoners prior to departure, Montesino displays an aggressive attitude, deliberately humiliating some of the men. Mart\u00edn, who believes in obeying the rules, prevents Montesino from striking one of the prisoners. \nThe prison transport vehicle is escorted by a police car with two officers, driving ahead. When the transport vehicle enters a foggy patch on the road, Mart\u00edn loses sight of the police car, as well as radio contact. Then the truck is brought to a sudden stop by a spiked strip lying across the road.

Mart\u00edn has to open the cells to save the prisoners, although one man, Pardo, has already died. \nThe freed prisoners open the other cells and Mart\u00edn is surrounded. He still tries to hold them off with his weapon, but then a message comes through the radio, announcing to the prisoners that Mart\u00edn's gun is, in fact, empty, and that they should take his key and escape. All, that is, except a young prisoner called Nano, who is wanted by the man who has staged the hijack. Nano responds to this by beating to death another prisoner, Mihai, a foreigner, whom Nano insists has masterminded the whole thing, and that it is nothing to do with him. Nano has also managed to get hold of Mart\u00edn's key. \nThe hijacker, Miguel, who has entered the truck's cabin, sends another radio message, telling the men that if they do not hand over Nano they will all die. A brawl ensues, with the men trying to get the key off Nano, but he swallows it. Mart\u00edn is overpowered and knocked unconscious by prisoner Ramis. When he comes to, he is locked in an area at one end of the truck, along with Nano, while the other men try to figure out a way to open the exit door. Ramis asks Mart\u00edn if he remembers him? Apparently he performed in a band at Mart\u00edn's wedding. \nMiguel starts the truck and begins to drive. In the back, the heating has been turned off and as it is winter the men are freezing. One of the prisoners, Rei, enters a storage compartment under the truck and tries to unscrew a panel. \nHowever, Montesino, whom Mart\u00edn had believed to be dead, has begun to revive.

Meanwhile, Rei has also died, having been impaled on a long metal screw in the storage compartment, while the truck was swerving about. \nInside the truck, Mart\u00edn talks with Nano, trying to discover what this is all about. Nano insists he does not know. Miguel had mentioned the name Chino in one of his radio messages, and Nano says that this is someone he grew up with, and who is like a brother to him. \nMiguel continues to drive as dawn breaks over the snowy landscape. He drives the truck into the middle of a frozen lake and shoots at the surrounding ice so that the vehicle begins to sink. Then he walks off. As freezing water begins to fill the truck, Mart\u00edn tells Ramis to release him so that he can reveal an emergency exit.

Miguel is stationed in a high building, firing at Nano, who is hiding in the street below. \nMart\u00edn creeps up behind Miguel, but is held off by Miguel's shotgun. Miguel explains why he is doing this; he had allowed his 13 year old daughter Sole to visit a fair with her friend. Nano and his friend Chino separated Sole from her girlfriend, and persuaded her to drink some shots. Unused to alcohol, she was soon drunk and then the boys took turns raping her. They then tortured her, with cigarette butts, pliers and a bottle.

Eighteen years later, while playing the Virgin Mary in a play, Benedetta has a vision of Jesus calling to her. One day, a young peasant woman named Bartolomea seeks shelter in the convent from her abusive father. Benedetta is assigned to oversee Bartolomea's integration into convent life. That night, Bartolomea kisses Benedetta.\nBenedetta begins to have recurring visions of Jesus. After a particularly fraught vision, where a man whom she mistakes for Jesus saves her from being gang raped, Benedetta falls into a deep illness. Abbess Felicita assigns Bartolomea to look after her. Benedetta has another vision of Christ, asking her to undress and touch his hands. The next morning, she wakes up with stigmata on her palms and feet.\nAn investigation ensues. Abbess Felicita is sceptical because Benedetta's stigmata appeared while she was asleep, not during prayer, and her forehead lacks the marks of a crown of thorns. Outside Felicita's chambers, Benedetta collapses. She then begins speaking in an angry male voice, castigating those who doubt her, as bleeding wounds appear on her forehead. Sister Christina, Felicita's daughter, suspects that Benedetta's wounds are self-inflicted, after spotting a nearby shard of pottery.\nFollowing a dispute between Felicita and local church leaders about the way popular interest in Benedetta's visions should be handled, Benedetta is elevated to the position of abbess in place of Felicita. Benedetta and Bartolomea move into Felicita's old quarters and begin a sexual relationship, later using a dildo carved by Bartolomea out of Benedetta's wooden Virgin Mary statuette.\nIn confession, Christina lies to the priest that she witnessed Benedetta inflicting her forehead wounds. The next day, the priest compels Christina to say her accusations publicly. When questioned by the priest, Felicita refutes Christina's claims because Christina has previously admitted to her that she did not actually see the wounds being self-inflicted. Benedetta, apparently possessed by the spirit of Jesus, orders Christina to flagellate herself. Felicita later observes Benedetta and Bartolomea having sex through a peephole in their chambers.\nHumiliated, Christina jumps to her death from the roof of the convent. As a plague begins to ravage the countryside, Benedetta has a vision that Pescia will be spared and orders the abbey closed to prevent infection. Felicita secretly travels to Florence to report Benedetta's sexual indiscretions to the local papal nuncio. Meanwhile, Benedetta suddenly dies of unknown causes.\nShortly after Felicita returns to the abbey with the nuncio, Benedetta revives, saying that she was in heaven and has seen the fates of all those present. The nuncio, as representative of the pope, opens a court of inquiry into Benedetta's conduct. Bartolomea initially denies any sexual involvement with Benedetta, but after being tortured by the nuncio's men, she ultimately confesses the truth, leading the nuncio to the wooden dildo hidden in a bible. He has Benedetta arrested; speaking in a male voice again, she lashes out at those who persecute her, announcing that the nuncio will soon fall ill. The nuncio discovers that Felicita has the plague and orders her condition to be hidden. Bartolomea is expelled from the abbey.\nIn the town square, before she is to be executed, Benedetta reveals new stigmata and, speaking in a male voice, announces that the Angel of Death approaches. Felicita, revealing her disease, blames the nuncio for bringing the plague to Pescia. Chaos ensues as the townspeople prevent the nuncio's men from burning Benedetta at the stake. Bartolomea unties Benedetta, discovering a bloody potsherd at her feet. The nuncio is killed by an angry mob, Benedetta and Bartolomea flee the town, and Felicita self-immolates on the fire lit for Benedetta's execution.\nIn an abandoned stable outside of town, after spending the night with Bartolomea, Benedetta insists that she must return to the convent.

Sam's husband, Gautham, is a rising architect, who has just concluded a deal for the refurbishment of a deserted compound, for a politician. To focus on the project, the couple invites Gautham's childhood-friend, Gayathri - a reputed architect, and Aditi - Gautham's sister, to live with them at the compound.\nWhile preparing to stay at the compound for the night, Gayathri begins texting with Krishna, an old-friend of hers. While sending a selfie of her and Aditi to him, he eerily replies that, he too, will be seen the picture - if they \"begin to take things more seriously\". However, Gautham reveals that Krishna, had died in a car accident the previous night, and that phones don't get satellite connectivity at the compound. Soon after, more paranormal activities begin to occur; Gayathri's phone begins to regularly beep with newer messages, despite her even having removed its battery. Concurrently, the power blacks out. Horrified with the recent events, the group attempts to flee, only to thwarted by their malfunctioning car.\nHaving retreated back into the compound, Sam and Gayathri deduce that the recent texts weren't sent by \"Krishna\", given his premature demise, but that of a paranormal source. Gautham then divulges that the compound, was earlier a school, which had been deserted over ten-years ago, on account of paranormal activities in the aftermath of a girl's death - infamously known as the \"Mount Roseyard School Mystery\". While seeking to find clues about the school's history, the group discovers several magazines with articles relating to the mystery; the pages of the articles are missing.

While treating Aditi, the group discovers the torn pages in the house of the school's former librarian.\nWhile reading the pages, the group learns that the girl in-question, Boomika - was the autistic daughter of the librarian, Ganesan. Boomika - an exceptionally-talented artist, and a nature lover, was well known for her astonishing works of art. She had spent most of her time, either painting in an abandoned flat, or leisuring in the nearby forest, despite Ganesan's wishes for her to pursue proper education. With a growing reputation - she was admitted into the school; however, she had died mysteriously afterwards. In the aftermath of her death, the entire school and the surrounding residents were reported to have migrated elsewhere, after reports of multiple murders in the area.\nDharman bizarrely quips that Boomika and the Earth \"are the same\" - it will take revenge on anyone who dares to \"desecrate it\". Gayathri deduces his view as the Gaia Hypothesis - that the Earth itself is a single, self-regulating organism, while other living forms thrive in a sort of symbiotic relationship with it; any organism which threatens to destabilize the Earth's ecological balance with ruin, will be killed. Elsewhere, Gautham visits the abandoned flat where Boomika used to paint, and witnesses the wall-paintings moving. Simultaneously, a paranoid Aditi, manages to musters enough courage to destroy Gayathri's phone - which she believes is the root cause for the recent events. Gayathri follows her, only to stop dead in her tracks, when she sees a ghastly apparition - presumably Boomika's spirit, behind Aditi. \"Boomika\" knocks out Aditi and Gayathri, and begins to chase Sam, who attempts to flee. Dharman manages to create a distraction; he is knocked out instead. Sam reunites with Gautham; they rush back into the compound upon realizing than Siddhu was left behind. Sam finds Siddhu painting with \"Boomika\"; she leaves a few moments later, without harming him, but not before Siddhu utters \"Thank You\", indicating that he overcame his impediment.\nWith \"Boomika\" presumably gone, the group vacates the house. In the aftermath of the night's events - Aditi is shown to be receiving therapy for trauma, Gayathri is recuperating from her injuries, Dharman has retreated to his hometown, Siddhu has regained his ability of speech, while Gautham remains in Ooty to focus on the refurbishment project; he cautiously conducts a bhumi puja (sacred rituals), in an attempt to prevent \"Boomika\" from returning. Elsewhere, Sam, who is visiting Gayathri in Bengaluru, is told by the latter about the true circumstances behind Boomika's death - Boomika had committed suicide, distraught with the then-ongoing infrastructure projects - which had threatened deforestation of the surrounding forests. Gayathri further reveals that Ganesan was intimidated to remain silent, and that the target of the murders which occurred in the aftermath of her death, were all people related to construction-activities. Gayathri realizes that Boomika's actions matches the Gaia Hypothesis - just as how the Earth would \"kill\" anyone which threatened to destroy its ecological sanctity, \"Boomika\" had murdered the construction workers, whose activities had threatened to cause ruin to her environment. Realizing that Gautham may be in danger, Sam rushes back to Ooty; it is shown that she had persuaded him to continue with the project, despite the paranormal events, and that Krishna was the one who had mediated the deal between Gautham and the politician - thus resulting in his death in the car crash (the politician was also murdered a while later).\nUpon her return to Ooty, Sam is told that Gautham is about to refurbish the abandoned flat; however, she is too late to save him, as the flat's door locks  Gautham inside, leaving him trapped, much to Sam's despair.

The battle is stopped by a single Elf Bright whose magical spell illuminates the area and leaves everyone within the periphery in awe.\nA few years pass by and the setting changes to Kyoto, the old regime was replaced by the new one called the Meiji restoration. Izou now works as a guard at an undisclosed brothel. He's asked by his superior to lock up a rowdy elf girl who has someone interested in purchasing. Izou does so and is demanded by the elf girl to set her free, but he refuses and leaves the scene as the girl notices a light blue aura emanating from Izou's body. Heading to the High Courtesan Chihaya's room, Izou delivers her a couple of things, one of which is an English vocabulary book. Thankful for the book, Chihaya notices the scratches on Izou's hand and asks where he got it. Izou downplays it and informs her that a \"tomboy\" just gave him some trouble. Curious about the tomboy, the two of them visit her down in her cell and even though the elf girl gives them a nasty attitude. Chihaya becomes interested in the elf girl and requests that she become her personal attendant.\nLater, back in Chihaya's room, Chihaya feeds her new attendant some food and learns her name is Sonya. Deducing that Sonya is of Russia origin, she reveals that her bird is too. Izou eavesdrops on their conversation for a bit and as he walks away from the room it starts to rain causing the wound over his right eye to become agitated. Meanwhile, two warriors appear in front of the brothel and kill Izou's superior, while Sonya is called over by Chihaya. The two talk and Chihaya reveals to Sonya her moniker Chihaya the Forgetful because she lost her memory ever since the start of the Meiji Restoration. She also reveals after taking out her precious hairpin from her hair that she's an Elf. Taking out a large map, Chihaya shows it to Sonya and tells her of a land populated by Elves somewhere north beyond the seas called Hakodate.\nAt that time, an army composed mainly of Orcs, Goblins and Dwarves raid the brothel and kill the patrons and servants there. Without wasting a moment, Izou fetches his old katana from the storage area and slaughters the invaders. Elsewhere the supposed leader of the invaders enters the place accompanied by his Orc companion named Raiden. The leader promises Raiden's freedom if he manages to sniff out the Elf they're after and begrudgingly, Raiden tacitly agrees and sniffs around the area. Elsewhere, Chihaya hides Sonya in her closet as the man interested in purchasing Sonya earlier barges into Chihaya's room, so they can escape together.\nMeanwhile, Izou finishes off three of the invaders, while thinking of Chihaya, he catches sight of the leader and then is attacked by Raiden. The two skirmish until a barrage of flaming arrows rain down upon them. Chihaya, leaves the man in the dust to return to Sonya who passes out due to smoke inhalation from the burning fire around the brothel is then confronted by the invader leader and his cohorts.\nAwakening from her unconscious state, Sonya sees a dark aura coming from the leader. Sonya then bites the leader's hand and is knocked to the side revealing that she's an elf in the process. The leader then orders one of his men to capture her, but Chihaya tries to stop them only to be also knocked aside and lose her precious hairpin. Upon touching it, she remembers her past and uses her hairpin to cast a spell that cuts off the leader's left hand. In a fit of rage, the leader stabs Chihaya in the heart and Sonya rushes to her aid. In Chihaya's last moments, she requests that Sonya return her hairpin to Hakodate and casts the same spell that illuminated the Edo Castle those few years ago. Shocked by the illustrious light, Raiden and Izou stop their fighting as Raiden's boss orders him to fetch the Elf girl. Following his leader's orders, Raiden finds Sonya grasping the dead body of Chihaya surrounded by a barrier of light. Astounded by the sight of what the light barrier cast around the two Elves, it dissipates once Sonya passes out and then Izou arrives and attacks Raiden from behind. Izou then picks up the unconscious Sonya and learns her name from Raiden who also saves them from a falling piece of debris. Following Raiden's suggestion, the two escape together with Sonya.\nThe following day, next to a forest, Raiden is bound to a tree, while Izou makes a makeshift grave for the deceased Chihaya. Izou details to Sonya that Chihaya will be sent to Heaven by doing this, but Sonya claims that she would have wanted to go to the land of Elves Hakodate. Sonya then shows the two Chihaya's hairpin and offers to hire Izou with it. Raiden also offers his services to Sonya noting his former employer captures Elf girls left and right and will continue to hunt her. To prove his resolve and that he won't betray them, Raiden breaks free from his restraints and uses a rock to break off his right fang as a symbol of his vow. Observing the light aura coming from Raiden, Sonya accepts his offer. A Daurian Redstart then flies by them and Raiden takes it as a symbol of good fortune and to add to it, he also knocks two rocks together give their fortune a good luck spark. Raiden then introduces himself and asks for Izou's name, but he refuses to give it, so Sonya answers for him.\nAt a manor in Yokohama, a military figure receives is informed by a messenger Goblin of the events that occurred back at the brothel. He orders that the Elf girl be captured at any cost. That afternoon at Fuchuu-Shuku, Tokaido, the group finds an inn that'll allow them to stay at and later that evening. Raiden and Izou have a heart to heart about a little bit of Raiden's past and how he seeks a life different from the typical Orcs in Japan. When Raiden asks why Izou was a bodyguard in the brothel, Izou claims that he simply failed to die in the past and is now on borrowed time.\nThe next day, the group travel onwards and after a brief fit of mistrust between Izou and Raiden, they're ambushed by the brothel invader leader and his cohorts. Amid the skirmish, Izou's right shoulder is sliced, making Izou recall how he lost his right eye by the betrayal of his former superior named K\u014dketsu. This causes Izou to go berserk and have him slay the ambushers as Sonya notices that his aura has now turned black. Shot and wounded from behind, Raiden was about to be impaled by a spear, but is saved by his former boss. The man approaches Raiden and asks if he's lost his mind, but Raiden begs him to be released. His former boss, allows it only under the condition that he hand Sonya over, and Raiden refuses and the battle continues until they flee the scene. Eventually, the group is chased to a cliff with a fast current river down below. After being shot at they all fall off the cliff and both Raiden and Izou fall into the water, while Sonya lands on a rock.\nIn a cave, Raiden and Izou are rescued by an old centaur named Tsukuyomi who lives in the cave. Awakening from their unconscious state, they realize that Sonya is missing and then Tsukuyomi appears before them and returns their weapons to them. He then introduces himself as Tsukuyomi. Raiden informs Izou of what he knows of Tsukuyomi, a hermit who is called a sage, although Tsukuyomi doesn't consider himself as such. Asked about Sonya, he claims he doesn't know where she is as they were the only ones he found by his place. Immediately, Izou acts rashly, but is stopped by Raiden, and Tsukuyomi then leads the two up a small set of stairs.\nMeanwhile in the military figure's manor, its owner asks one of his guests if they've heard of the name Whole Creation, its relation is to the \"Dark Lord\". One of his guest answers no he has not. So the man gives his guest an explanation about the Dark Lord and his connection to Magic Wands and reveals that a wand ended the bloodless coup that occurred years ago.\nBack in the cave, Tsukuyomi reads an excerpt about Wands from a book and it mentions Brights as those who can harness their power. It's also said that a majority of Brights are in fact Elves. Raiden then deduces that his former boss had him hunt Elves just to find Brights. Tsukuyomi then mentions the two factions who are after the wands, the Shield of Light and the Inferni. Of the Inferni, the military figure offers \u014ckubo a deal to join the Inferni if he finds a Wand for him, however, \u014ckubo's response is never given, but he mentions how hard to read the man was. The man then heads to the room Sonya was in and demands to know if the beam of light from the brothel was her or not.\nOutside of his cave, Tsukuyomi directs Izou and Raiden east of Fuji to Yokohama where a gathering of Elves are located at. He also informs them that Sonya is still alive as the Stars foretold that she is.\nEventually, the two make it to Odawara, Tokaido, and help a young boy named Kotaro who fell and hurt himself. This leads some of the local residents to suspect the two are the kidnappers who are stealing elves from the village. The boy's mother vouches for them and informs them of the village's problem with its Elves going missing. One of which was found dead with its legs severed off.\nThe next day, the two make it to Yokohama. There, Izou sees someone he may know and recalls once again the memory of how he lost his eye. Noting Izou's uneasiness, they go their separate ways and Izou ends up at a temple where he finds a woman that resembles Chihaya. In reality, the woman is her twin sister.\nMeanwhile, Raiden continues his search for an Elf, but instead finds a Goblin linen salesman that has Sonya's old clothing. The salesman details that he got them from an estate in Yamanoe. At the Temple, Izou and Chihaya's twin sister talk, and she reveals that Chihaya's hairpin is actually a wand. Raiden then arrives and informs them that he's found a clue of Sonya's location. Chihaya's twin sister then reveals that Sonya must be in the hands of the Inferni and that she's part of the Shield of Light.\nAs they head off to the location of the Inferni estate, Chihaya's twin sister elaborates on her and her sister's back story of trying to acquire the wand. Inside of the estate, the Inferni man tricks Sonya into drinking drugged tea, upon learning that Izou and Raiden are still alive. Hence, he takes Sonya in his carriage, which is soon stopped by Izou's group and Izou recognizes the Inferni man as his former master K\u014dketsu. Both Chihaya's twin sister and Raiden try to attack K\u014dketsu, but they're deftly deal with by K\u014dketsu who makes an escape after this as Izou is too shocked to make a move against his former master. Members of the Shield of Light arrive and reveal Chihaya's twin sister's name is Anna and one of them named Nakazo suggests they regroup at their base. The group takes a carriage to a SoL base located at the port of the city where the Inferni boat is thought to be at and it'll take Sonya to their homeland.\nRiding on the SoL boat, Izou and Raiden manage to board the Inferni boat and deal with most of the Inferni. Soon, T\u014dmoku, Raiden's old master now with an octopus hand to replace his missing left, attacks Raiden. In retaliation, Izou slices off one of T\u014dmoku's tentacles and Raiden slices off his left arm. As Raiden deals with T\u014dmoku he gets his right leg blown off, as Izou heads into the boat in search of Sonya. With Izou gone, Raiden finishes off T\u014dmoku, but with the last of his strength, T\u014dmoku kills Raiden by shooting him directly in the face. Dealing with a Goblin and Orc Inferni, Izou finds Sonya only to be ambushed by his former master out on the deck. K\u014dketsu offers him to join him again, but Izou refuses and is sequentially killed by him. Distraught, Sonya approaches Izou's corpse and finds the wand on him, and uses it to heal and revive Izou. Anna and Nakazo board the Inferni ship and Anna comes to realize that Sonya is actually a Bright. K\u014dketsu in an awe-stricken stupor demands that Sonya hand over the wand. Sonya refuses. After mistaking Anna for her twin sister Chihaya, Sonya uses the wand to vaporize K\u014dketsu.\nA few days later, Izo and Raiden now with a new leg see Sonya off as she goes with Anna the SoL. Revealing that he has the wand on his person, Izou tosses it into the ocean and claims that humans will take care of their own problems their own way.

Her leg becomes stiff during PE class, where they practice for the marathon tomorrow, with Akiko bringing her to the clinic afterward. While her classmates are out talking about the marathon, Kanna goes to the school's rabbit enclosure and she takes care of a white rabbit she calls Shiro. She is called by Miki, her best friend, telling her to walk home with her. Both of them stop by the nearby Ushijima Shrine before they separate and walk back to their respective homes. Kanna returns to her apartment, still distraught a year after Yayoi's death. Her father Norimasa returns home, bringing her shoes for the marathon tomorrow, but they were deemed too small for her.\nOn the day of the marathon, during a gloomy day, Kanna struggles to run towards the finish line, before she abruptly stops, letting others pass by her. Norimasa tries to comfort Kanna in the ensuing rain, but she gets upset, running away back towards Ushijima Shrine. She trips and lies flat on the ground, before her mother's keepsake bracelet activates, knocking her towards the ground. Picking up the bracelet, she wears it on her wrist. Suddenly, time itself slows down. She is frightened by the sight of a god in the shape of a big black cow that suddenly appeared before a demon boy named Yasha, appears and asks Kanna to hand over her bracelet. Shiro suddenly appears and tries to prevent Kanna from doing so. Kanna is surprised that Shiro can actually talk.\nOutside of the shrine, Shiro explains that she is a messenger of the deities above, and explains that deities from all over the country gather above Izumo-taisha Shrine in Shimane, during the month of October, also known as Kannazuki in the lunar calendar, or Kamiarizuki according to the people in Izumo, to celebrate the annual harvest. She continues, telling Kanna that they must visit shrine deities along the way, collecting their feast offerings, before delivering them to Izumo by 7 o'clock at night, with the offerings stored inside of a magic gourd.\nShiro then urges Kanna to return to Ushijima Shrine, telling her to overcome her fear of the god. Kanna does so, and collects the cow god's offering, a giant mochi, before they continue on, visiting more shrine deities, collecting their feast offerings along the way. Far from Tokyo, Kanna and Shiro rest underneath a bridge over a river uncannily named after her. Kanna dreams about her mother again, and when she wakes up, Yasha appears again and steals her bracelet and the gourd. Kanna chases after Yasha and Yasha reveals that he comes from a long line of fast-running demon ancestors who stripped of their status as deities by \u014ckuninushi, the supreme deity who represents Izumo-taisha Shrine. Yasha challenges her in a race, which he wins, boasting that he can bring all of the offerings to Izumo in time before Shiro urges him that Kanna is the one who was asked to do so.\nKanna, Shiro, and Yasha continue on, collecting more offerings from the deities. They stop by Lake Suwa in Nagano at a location of Suwa-taisha Shrine next to it, where they meet the powerful Ry\u016bjin, the dragon god and a son of \u014ckuninushi. He tests Kanna, instructing her to jump her way toward the floating shrine. The floating shrine is revealed to be an illusion, and Kanna fails the test. Ry\u016bjin deems Kanna unworthy, but he gives Kanna a ride on her back, asking her the truth behind her role as the Idaten. Kanna lies that she is to bring the feast offerings to Izumo, angering Ry\u016bjin, who urges her to tell the truth. Kanna does so, telling Ry\u016bjin that she only wants to see Yayoi again. Ry\u016bjin understands her, relating to it by explaining that he had to sign a contract that bounded him to rule Lake Suwa, meaning that he could never see his father again, just like how Kanna can no longer see her mother after she died. Ry\u016bjin then gives his offering to the three, a deluge of water from Lake Suwa before disappearing.\nThe three continue gathering offerings from shrines along the way before they collect the last offering from Kotoshironushi, a big sea bream, in Miho Shrine of Matsue. They camp out near the beach, before they run the last leg of their journey to Izumo. Kanna told Yasha about her mom's death from an illness after losing the marathon, because she wasn't fast enough and blames herself for it. As they went to sleep, Kanna suddenly hears her mother's voice and follows it to a secluded beach, where she is happy to see her, body and soul. This worries Shiro and Yasha, who track down Kanna to the same beach. Kanna daydreams about Yayoi not dying if she won the marathon, but it is all revealed to be a trick, as the Yayoi she was talking to, was Kanna's dark side taking Yayoi's form. Yasha tells the fake Yayoi that the real one wouldn't trick people like her. The fake Yayoi distorts her vision, under an evil aura, depicting Shiro and Yasha to her as terrifying monsters to prevent her from listening to their pleas. Yasha tries to stop the evil aura but gets wounded in the process. Shiro and Yasha scare away the fake Yayoi. They knew that it was a god imposter and try to tell Kanna to continue on her last leg to Izumo, but an unresponsive Kanna, is suddenly burdened to give up. She rips the bracelet off her wrist. Time itself resumes and Kanna loses the ability to communicate with both Shiro and Yasha. Shiro and Yasha both worry what would happen next, as the raindrops started falling down to the ground again. After what happened with the fake Yayoi, Shiro reveals to Yasha that the modern world has become cruel, with the dark side of the people emerging from them. Unless they would be able to overcome their hard feelings, their dark side would prey over it.\nSuddenly, a typhoon emerges from out of nowhere, on track to make landfall over Shimane. A worried Norimasa calls emergency hotlines to find Kanna, who has been lost ever since she ran away from him in school. Kanna returns from the secluded beach, and while on the road back to the beach she, Shiro, and Yasha were camping at, she has a vision of the earlier dream she had in school, seeing that it ended with running becoming her passion, a passion that she lost after Yayoi's death. The vision continues, with Yayoi, herself, talking to Yasha near the river after a brief race with him, revealing that she is going to have a daughter. Yayoi gives birth, spending time with the newborn Kanna growing up before her untimely death after Kanna lost the marathon. After Yayoi's funeral, Kanna gets upset over the people gossiping about Yayoi, and runs away to the same shrine, crying about her.\nAfter the vision, Kanna suddenly regains her lost passion for running, realizing that Yayoi was a descendant of the Idaten, who undertook the annual quest before tying up her hair with the torn bracelet. She continues running the last leg to Izumo. While Kanna is on the run, Shiro and Yasha are surprised to see her catch up. She motivates herself amid a group of people on the beach in Izumo during the typhoon, believing that she could still communicate with Shiro and Yasha, when in fact, she couldn't, after ripping off the bracelet. Running towards the beach where the path to the deities' world would appear, she realizes that she is too late. Kanna perseveres and realizes that she could still go to Izumo-taisha Shrine. Taking a detour from the road blocked with a car blown by the typhoon, she arrives at the shrine and climbs the glowing staircase to the deities' world that appeared before her, only to realize that the room where the deities would feast, was empty. She realized she was too late and she blamed herself for her mistake saying that she was never fast enough, but her bracelet suddenly reactivates, and \u014ckuninushi suddenly appears. All of the shrine deities' offerings are taken out of the gourd and placed before the gods as food for them to feast on. \u014ckuninushi thanks Kanna, Shiro, and Yasha, for their undertaking of the quest assigned to the Idaten, taking them back to the entrance of the shrine he rules over.

Joy guides them to another road and continues his story. This road is revealed to be a spiral path deep in the forest which leads to nowhere. Joy explains everything that has happened to the duo since they arrived in Churuli through the story and reveals that this process is cyclical.

Jaffe and his shaman Baba reveal to a baffled Akeem that he had sired a bastard son during his first visit to Queens, New York many years ago, after his aide and long-time friend Semmi had enticed two women into spending the night with them while Akeem was still searching for his future queen. One of them drugged Akeem, resulting in a tryst he did not remember. As Zamundian tradition demands that only a male successor can inherit the throne, and as Akeem has fathered only daughters, he is forced to travel back to Queens to retrieve his son. If not, Zamunda could face a hostile takeover by Zamunda's militaristic neighbor nation Nexdoria, whose dictator, General Izzi (the brother of Imani, Akeem's original arranged bride-to-be), has been pushing for Akeem's eldest daughter Meeka to marry his foppish son, Idi.\nFollowing King Jaffe's funeral and Akeem's ascension to the kingship, he and Semmi travel back to Queens to find his illegitimate son. During a light-hearted reunion with the barbershop gang they bonded with years earlier, head barber Mr. Clarence informs them that the son in question is Lavelle Junson, a ticket scalper who hustles outside of Madison Square Garden. After an awkward reunion with Lavelle's mother Mary, Akeem takes them back to Zamunda, much to his family's displeasure. When General Izzi learns of this, he drops by to introduce his daughter Bopoto to Lavelle as a last shot at laying claim to the throne of Zamunda, but in order to qualify as a royal prince, Lavelle first has to pass a series of traditional - and hazardous - tests.\nLavelle is at first highly reluctant to place himself in danger, but then bonds with Mirembe, a royal groomer, who tells him of Akeem's quest to find his queen and encourages him to follow his own path. Lavelle then invites his uncle Reem, Mary's streetwise brother, to Zamunda. He coaches him on how to blend his urban upbringing with his new royal status. Lavelle gradually develops an understanding with Akeem's family and, using his wits and some forced courage, he passes and is made Prince of Zamunda. However, at his accession party, Lavelle overhears a conversation between Akeem and Izzi which makes him believe that Akeem is just exploiting him, and he, Mirembe, Mary and Reem go back to New York. Upset at losing Mary, whom she has befriended, Lisa locks Akeem out of their bedroom. After a pep talk from his father-in-law Cleo, who reminds him of the late Queen Aoleon's progressive mind, Akeem flies back to the States, while Semmi is left to stall Izzi, who intends to return the next day to either see Bopoto marry Lavelle or declare war.\nReturning to Queens, Akeem finds that Lavelle and Mirembe are about to get married. Confronted by Lavelle and reminded of his own life story, he gives them his blessing and releases Lavelle from his marriage to Bopoto. When Mirembe expresses reluctance in the couple cutting all of their ties to Zamunda, Akeem offers to fly Mary's family back for a proper wedding. In the meantime, Semmi and the princesses, all trained staff fighters, fight off and subdue General Izzi when he invades the palace, forcing him to try a more diplomatic approach. Upon his return home, Akeem changes the royal succession by allowing his daughter Meeka to ascend to the throne upon his death, while Lavelle is made an ambassador to the United States, and General Izzi has opened Nexdoria for a peaceful political and trading relationship with Zamunda.

The pair robs them at gunpoint and forces them to lie down, but before they leave, Mandrake overhears Maika call Alan 'Hoaggie'. Mandrake suddenly murders Maika and Jordan and abducts the parents after night falls, breaking Alan's arm and knocking Jill unconscious.\nAs Mandrake questions the pair, he reveals that he knows Alan is a teacher and was once an assistant teacher at a group home for troubled boys, one notorious for physical and sexual abuse. Alan guesses correctly that both were enrolled at the school, but he insists that he was completely unaware of the abuse; Mandrake does not believe him and implies that they are driving to the boy's home. When they stop at a gas station, Alan attempts to secretly alert the station attendant, however Mandrake suspects this and kills the attendant by bludgeoning him with a fire extinguisher. Alan pretends to accidentally hit himself with the door while entering the car but as he kneels next to the car to \"recover\" he presses a screw into the back left tire.\nJill attempts to escape, but is quickly caught and later forced to kneel underneath an overpass. Threatening to shoot her, Mandrake forces Alan to admit that he was aware of all of the abuse, but stopped and reported nothing out of cowardice. Alan relays a story of a young boy who tattooed a swastika on his arm; at roll call, an admin painfully and forcibly scrubbed it from his skin with a nylon brush, which traumatized the rest of the students. Jill is shaken by this admittance, and later rebuffs Alan's attempts at contact. When it's clear that Mandrake will not let her go, she escapes from the moving vehicle and then chooses to jump into the nearby river rather than return to her abductors; her fate is left ambiguous.\nAlan briefly escapes when they stop to replace the tire Alan pressed a nail into, and reaches a car with a group of teenagers, however Mandrake finds them and convinces them to force Alan out of the car, before murdering them all but one, who manages to escape. With Alan recaptured, they finally reach an old boarding school, presumably where Mandrake and/or Tubs grew up. \nWalking through the now-abandoned building, Alan admits that he was not just a coward, but also privately believed that the boy with the tattoo deserved his punishment. Believing Mandrake to be that boy, he apologizes for not stepping in. Mandrake reveals that the boy wasn't him. He then shoots Alan in the chest and taunts him, but Alan hits him with a rock and bludgeons him. Mandrake survives, though wounded and disoriented, and tries but fails to kill Alan. Tubs, who Alan had talked to a few times implying that he only does what Mandrake tells him to, likening that behaviour to still being in a boarding school, arrives and kills Mandrake with the rifle. He leaves the heavily wounded Alan, telling him \"I hate this place\", which is also carved into a stone behind Alan.

She sends the police to the Glatzel household, warning them that a tragedy will occur there. Arne and Debbie return to their apartment located above a kennel where Debbie works. After feeling unwell, Arne murders his landlord, Bruno Sauls, by stabbing him 22 times due to his demonic possession. With the support of the Warrens, his case becomes the first American murder trial to claim demonic possession as a defense, resulting in the beginning of an investigation into David's original possession. The Warrens later discover a satanic curse passed on through a witch's totem and meet with Kastner, a former priest who previously dealt with the Disciples of the Ram cult. He tells them that an occultist had intentionally left the totem, resulting in the creation of a curse on the Glatzels, causing the possession of David.\nThe Warrens travel to Danvers, Massachusetts, to investigate the death of Katie Lincoln, who was also stabbed 22 times. Detectives had found a totem at the home of Katie's friend Jessica, who is missing. Lorraine initiates a vision to recreate the murder and discovers that Jessica had stabbed Katie while possessed before jumping to her death off of a cliff, which allows detectives to recover her body. The Warrens travel to the funeral home where her body rests, and Lorraine touches the corpse's hand to help find the location of the occultist.

Ed is affected by the curse, a totem being discovered in a vase of flowers delivered to the house, but is stopped by Drew when attacking Lorraine. When they realize Katie attended nearby Fairfield University, they begin to assume the occultist is operating in the area. Lorraine returns to Kastner for help, and he reveals that he had secretly raised a daughter, Isla, in violation of the requirement of clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church. As he researched the occult, Isla grew fascinated in it, later becoming the occultist. Kastner tells Lorraine that Isla's altar must be in the tunnels underneath the house, leading her into them before Isla finds and kills him.

He is briefly bewitched by Isla and attempts to kill Lorraine, but she forces him to recall the time they first met, reminding him of their love.

One of those pursuers, hitman Bob Viddick, gets himself incarcerated in the same small-town jail by pretending to be drunk and crashing a car into the police car Murretto had abandoned, which was being investigated by two state troopers.\nMurretto and Viddick are placed in separate cells, initially thwarting Viddick's plan to kill Murretto. However, Viddick has planted a small incendiary device at the station's entrance and when it ignites and the fire alarm goes off, he takes advantage of the confusion. Viddick beats a drunken man sharing his cell and incapacitates the police sergeant, stealing his gun. He is about to kill Murretto when Young interrupts him and returns him to his cell.\nYoung, determined to find out the truth, finally gets Murretto to explain his story: he was working for a Nevada casino mob boss and tried to buy off the state's attorney general William Fenton. When Fenton didn't cooperate and was brutally killed, it turned out he had recorded his conversations with Murretto. To save his own skin Murretto agreed to work with the FBI, which led the mob boss to send hired killers after him.\nWhile Murretto and Viddick trade threats, a new killer enters the police station\u2014Anthony Lamb, a second hitman hired to kill Murretto.

The drug is being touted as the first non-addictive painkiller and is due to be released shortly as a replacement for Oxycodone. The study uncovers concerning results; Klaralon initially presents as non-addictive when taken daily for the first 7 days (parameters specified by Northlight), however after 7 days it becomes almost three times more addictive than Oxycodone. Realising the public health implications, Brower recommends to Northlight they delay Klaralon's release for further testing, which they object to. Board member Dr. Bill Simons tries to tempt Brower into changing his mind by offering a large research grant, but Brower refuses. With Northlight being one of the university's main donors, Brower finds himself under pressure from department head Greg Talbot to approve the study, but again is reluctant.

One is run by the Armenian Mafia who operate pill mills across the US. The other is based in Montreal, Quebec controlled by drug kingpin Claude \u2018Mother\u2019 Veroche, who operates out of a nondescript restaurant called La Marina. Kelly intends to convince the two cartels to enter into business, so both leaders can be arrested at once when they meet. Kelly has personal motivation for bringing them down, due to his younger sister suffering from crippling heroin addiction. Kelly's relationship with Mother becomes strained when news of Cedric's capture comes to light, with Mother becoming concerned there is an informant in his organisation. Due to operational funding concerns, Kelly's superior agent Garrett gives him a reduced timescale to organise the meet between the two cartels. Mother has Cedric killed in custody for his silence, and executes his second in command Guy Broussard after discovering he has been speaking with the authorities.\nArchitect and recovering Oxycodone addict Claire Reimann becomes concerned when her 16-year-old son David does not return home from hockey practice. He is later found dead as a result of a fentanyl overdose, shocking Claire who is convinced he never took drugs. Although the Detroit Police Department treats it as an accidental death, she hires a private investigator who determines David was forced to take the fentanyl and was murdered. Through her son's social media she tracks down one of his friends, who confesses several teenagers from the hockey team (from both Detroit and Montreal) work for Mother as drug runners, although David had only done it once. Reimann crosses the Ambassador Bridge and travels to Montreal where she hires another private investigator, who provides her with information on Mother and an untraceable ghost gun. She threatens another drug runner, Derrick Millebran, who believes that Mother is killing them to tie up loose ends after Cedric's arrest. Kelly becomes aware of Reimann's activities through investigation of Cedric's associates, and intercepts her outside La Marina. He does not arrest her, but instead unloads her gun and urges her to leave for her own good.\nThe meeting between the two cartels goes ahead, covertly monitored by a joint DEA-RCMP taskforce. However, an RCMP surveillance officer accidentally gives away his position, resulting in a shootout that kills Kelly's partner, Special Agent Stanley Foster. Mother also escapes, believed to have fled to Algeria. Given the seizure of the drugs at the meet, both US and Canadian agencies decide to disband the continued search for Mother and the Armenians. Outraged, Kelly goes against orders and travels to La Marina, where he threatens an employee who tells him Mother is still in Canada but is planning to escape via seaplane that evening from the Port of Montreal. Reimann is also given this information from her private investigator. Kelly arrives at the port, but has been beaten there by Reimann, who opens fire and kills Mother as he makes his way to the aircraft. His bodyguard shoots her in the arm, but is swiftly shot by Kelly. He then replaces the men's weapons with Reimann's ghost gun and his own unregistered back up gun, to make it appear they shot each other in a disagreement over money that was being carried by Mother at the time. He treats her gunshot wound, and tells her he does not intend to arrest her.\nA last ditch effort by Northlight CEO Dr. Meg Holmes also fails to convince Brower to come on side, and the company is subjected to an FDA hearing.

Her mother, Catherine, decides to move them to London, stopping at a party at a mysterious mansion called Hellman Hall on the Suffolk coast to ask the host for money. Sneaking inside, Estella loses her mother\u2019s necklace while being chased by the host's ferocious Dalmatian dogs, which push Catherine off a cliffside balcony to her death. Orphaned, Estella runs away to London and befriends street urchins Jasper and Horace.\nTen years later in 1974, Estella practices thievery and grifts with Jasper and Horace, honing her fashion skills by designing their disguises, alongside their dogs, Buddy and Wink. For her birthday in 1977, Jasper and Horace get her a job at the Liberty department store, but Estella is made a janitor and denied the chance to use her talents. She drunkenly redecorates the window  display and impresses the Baroness\u2014a renowned but authoritarian haute couture designer\u2014who offers her a coveted job at her fashion house. Estella gains the Baroness's confidence but notices her wearing Catherine\u2019s necklace, which the Baroness claims is a family heirloom that an employee once stole. Estella asks Jasper and Horace to help retrieve the necklace during the Baroness's Black and White Ball.\nTo conceal her identity, Estella creates an alter-ego, \"Cruella\", and wears one of the Baroness's old designs from a vintage clothing store owned by the flamboyant Artie. At the ball, Cruella steals the spotlight as Jasper and Horace break into the Baroness's vault, but she is already wearing the necklace. Jasper releases rats into the party, allowing Estella to swipe the necklace. The Baroness summons her Dalmatians with a dog whistle, and Estella realizes the Baroness caused Catherine's death. In the ensuing chaos, one of the Dalmatians swallows the necklace. Seeking revenge, Estella orders Jasper and Horace to kidnap the Dalmatians, and recovers the necklace. Cruella upstages the Baroness at various events in extravagant fashions, gaining notoriety via society columnist Anita Darling, Estella\u2019s childhood friend. Furious, the Baroness fires her lawyer, Roger Dearly, while Cruella's increasingly haughty behavior discomforts Jasper.\nEstella designs and sews an elaborately beaded dress as the signature piece for the Baroness's spring collection and stages a robbery in the fashion house, leading the Baroness to lock up all the dresses. The night of the spring show, the Baroness opens the vault to find that the entire collection has been destroyed by thousands of moths, having emerged from the beads on the dress which were actually moth cocoons. Seeing what she has done, the Baroness realizes Estella and Cruella are the same person. Having wrecked the Baroness' show, Cruella stages her own fashion show outside in Regent's Park, wearing a faux Dalmatian-fur coat. Returning home, Estella is confronted by the Baroness and her men, who have captured Jasper and Horace. Setting fire to the building, the Baroness leaves Estella to die, and has Jasper and Horace sent to prison for her murder. Estella is saved by John, the Baroness's valet, who reveals that the necklace unlocks a box containing Estella\u2019s birth records: the Baroness is her biological mother. She had ordered John to murder the infant Estella to focus on her career and keep her late husband's inheritance. Instead, John gave the baby to Catherine, one of the Baroness's maids, who raised Estella in secret.\nCruella breaks Jasper and Horace out of prison and reveals the truth, recruiting them, Artie, and John for her final scheme.

Having foreseen their impending danger, the elderly Romani leader cast a set of silver dentures in the form of a wolf's fangs for their protection. After the slaughter, the clan leader and a male Romani are captured, the latter being dismembered and erected as a scarecrow to serve as a warning to other Romani, whilst the Romani leader is buried alive with the silver fangs clutched in her grasp.\nSoon after, the townspeople, including Seamus' children Edward and Charlotte, are plagued by nightmares of the scarecrow and the silver fangs. While playing one day, farm boy Timmy reveals to the other children he knows the location of the scarecrow. Upon arriving at the scarecrow and having sworn the others to secrecy, Timmy is overcome with the urge to dig up the silver fangs. Edward attempts to stop him, but Timmy becomes possessed and places the fangs in his mouth, subsequently biting Edward's throat as the other children flee in terror. Seamus quickly recovers the wounded Edward whilst Timmy is nowhere to be found. A doctor concludes that Edward was attacked by a wild animal, as Edward grows ill. After Charlotte awakes to Edward's screams during the night and finds him ensnared by wood-like vines emerging from his body, Edward disappears into the night.\nCharlotte goes to the local church to pray and encounters Timmy, who claims he has no memory of what happened after donning the fangs.

Upon hearing Anne-Marie survived her attack but was bitten, John rapidly heads to the town, but is too late to prevent an already transforming Anne-Marie from escaping. Luring the Anne-Marie beast, John manages to trap and kill the creature, bringing the corpse to Seamus and performing an autopsy. Cutting open the creature reveals Anne-Marie, screaming in a murderous rage. John insists that she cannot be saved and orders a villager to shoot and kill her. John explains that the infection causes a victim to become one of the creatures, with Seamus realising that Edward has suffered the same fate. John reveals to Seamus' wife Isabelle that his wife and daughter were killed by a similar beast - he was investigating the Romani as they pronounced the \"curse\" on the land had been fulfilled. Isabelle also reveals that Seamus was the orchestrator of the Romani massacre and so is the target of the curse, along with his kin.\nCharlotte informs John of the silver fangs' location, which he melts down into four silver bullets.

Her professor Dr. Randall Mindy confirms that it will collide with the Earth in about six months and is large enough to cause a planet-wide extinction event. NASA confirms the findings and their Planetary Defense Coordination Office head Dr. Teddy Oglethorpe accompanies Dibiasky and Mindy to present their findings to the White House. They are met with apathy from President Janie Orlean and her son/Chief of Staff Jason.\nOglethorpe urges Dibiasky and Mindy to leak the news to the media, and they do so on a morning talk show. When hosts Jack Bremmer and Brie Evantee treat the topic frivolously, Dibiasky loses her composure and rants about the threat. Mindy receives public approval for his looks; conversely, Dibiasky became the subject of negative internet memes. Actual news about the comet's threat receives little public attention and the danger is denied by Orlean's NASA Director Jocelyn Calder, a top donor to Orlean with no background in astronomy. When news of Orlean's sex scandal with her Supreme Court nominee Sheriff Conlon is exposed, she distracts from the bad publicity by finally confirming the threat and announcing a project to strike and divert the comet using nuclear weapons.\nThe mission successfully launches, but Orlean abruptly aborts it when Peter Isherwell, the billionaire CEO of BASH Cellular and another top donor, discovers that the comet contains trillions of dollars worth of rare-earth elements. The White House agrees to commercially exploit the comet by fragmenting and recovering it from the ocean, using technology proposed by BASH in a scheme that has not undergone peer review. Orlean sidelines Dibiasky and Oglethorpe while hiring Mindy as the National Science Advisor. Dibiasky tries to mobilize public opposition to the scheme but gives up under threat from Orlean's administration. Mindy becomes a prominent voice advocating for the comet's commercial opportunities and begins an affair with Evantee.\nWorld opinion is divided among people who believe the comet is a severe threat, those who decry alarmism and believe that mining a destroyed comet will create jobs, and those who deny that the comet even exists. When Dibiasky returns home to Illinois, her parents kick her out of the house and she begins a relationship with a young man named Yule, a shoplifter she meets at her retail job. After Mindy's wife confronts him about his infidelity, she returns to Michigan without him. Mindy questions whether Isherwell's technology will be able to break apart the comet, angering the billionaire. Becoming frustrated with the administration, Mindy finally snaps and rants on live television, criticizing Orlean for downplaying the impending apocalypse and questioning humanity's indifference.\nCut off from the administration, Mindy reconciles with Dibiasky as the comet becomes visible from Earth. Mindy, Dibiasky, and Oglethorpe organize a protest campaign on social media, telling people to \"Just Look Up\" and call on other countries to conduct comet interception operations. At the same time, Orlean starts an anti-campaign telling people, \"Don't Look Up,\". Orlean cuts Russia, India, and China out of the rights for the comet-mining deal, so they prepare their own joint deflection mission, only for their spacecraft to explode. BASH's attempt at breaking the comet apart also goes awry and everyone realizes that humanity is doomed.\nIsherwell, Orlean, and others in their elite circle board a sleeper spaceship designed to find an Earth-like planet, inadvertently leaving Jason behind.

In a fossil excavation experience there, he vows to his friends that he will discover a dinosaur and says that he will eat monkey nuts with his eyes if he fails. As he leaves the excavation experience, he trips over a rock and suspects that he has found the fossil of an egg.  He goes home and convinces Doraemon to use the \"time wrapping cloth\" on the fossil egg, and twin feathered dinosaurs emerged. Doraemon found that they are a new species of dinosaur not listed in the \"Complete Encyclop\u00e6pia of Space\". Nobita names the twin dinosaurs Kyu and Myu and under the advice of Dr. Dinosaur learned how to take care of them. The two fast-growing creatures gradually show differences in their development. Myu has learned to fly, but not the smaller Ky. As Kyu and Myu grow, Nobita's room becomes too small for them, so they use the \"Breeding Diorama Set\" to give Kyu and Myu more freedom. The day when Nobita completes his dare arrive. When his friends arrive, they discovr that Nobita has indeed found a dinosaur. At this point, Kyu and Myu make a lot of commotion, leading to Nobita's mother to come upstairs. They try to hide Kyu and Myu by using the \"spatial movement crayon\", however, the townspeople see Kyu and Myu. Understanding that Kyu and Myu have reached their full size, they should return to their time. Nobita has trouble accepting this, but decides it might be the best option. The next morning, the five of them climb into the time machine.\nWith the \"Time Furoshiki\" Doraemon's party goes back to the late Cretaceous, calculated from the time of the fossil egg. However, they discovered they were in the Jurassic period instead. As they are rushing to return to the \"time machine\" Nobita tripped and lost the \"Breeding diorama set\" in a swamp. The scene switches to a room where the actions of Nobita and his friends are secretly monitored by Jill, in the form of a white monkey, as he answers a call by a mysterious woman named Natalie. Unaware that they are being monitored, the group searches for Kyu and Myu's comrades, and finally reaches the sea where along the way dinosaurs like Cole, a Tarbosaurus who originally attacked them, and Top, a Sinoceratops, joined during the voyage as both were tamed by \"Tomodachi Chocolate\". When Gian and Suneo went ahead to find more clues about Kyu and Myu's kind, they are captured by Jill, and Doraemon and others are in danger of being attacked by a large pterosaur. Nobita and Kyu fall into the sea, but are helped by a plesiosaur that is suspiously similar to Piisuke who took them to a mysterious island where they reunite with Doraemon, Shizuka, and Myu. This is an island inhabited by dinosaurs that look like them, the same species as Kyu and Myu. Nobita tries to get the two back to their group, but Kyu is scratched and refused by the group because they believe Kyu is different. It may be because, unlike the new dinosaurs, Kyu cannot fly and its tail is shorter. Trembling with grief and sorrow, Nobita declares that Kyu can fly by itself.\nMeanwhile, Jill and Natalie, who were on their way to the island on a submarine, said a deep impact was immediate. Gian and Suneo, who are watching them escape from the cage, look at the map and see the truth of the mysterious island. At the time, Nobita and Kyu, who had just started flying training, had a misunderstanding and the training was disrupted. Nobita looked down, silently encouraged, and when he searched for a note with the \"question stick\" there was a figure of a mark who was constantly practicing alone. He started training to touch Nobita because he was able to do the reverse climb. At that moment, a huge object shining in the sky falls.\nGian and Suneo also ran further in, when they were all together, Doraemon tells everyone that this was the time period that caused the Cretaceous extinction when a meteorite struck Mexico on the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula 66 million years ago. Nobita tries to use an \"opposite direction\" to turn the meteorite into space, but the \"Time Patrol\" appears and Natalie stops the party's activities. Jill reveals that they were looking at this era as a one-time patrol, and insists that history cannot be changed even if he thinks about dinosaurs and is close to Nobita's heart.  Nonetheless, Nobita, who tried to use the \"opposite direction\" machine, was stopped and detained by the Time Patrol. Kyu and Myu rush to protect Nobita, and Doraemon and others who tried to protect him are also detained. However, when Jill holds a \"check card\" on Nobita and Kyu, the card emits light. Jill and his Time Patrol group decide not to interfere in their activities.\nAs the team fights to help Kyu, Myu and the other dinosaurs, information provided by Gian and Suneo revealed that the island was actually the \"Breeding diorama set\", dropped by Nobita during their time in the Jurassic period, and became active and larger as time passed. They decided to move the dinosaurs outside the island onto the island with the \"Space Movement Crayon\" and launch a rescue operation to protect them from the hot air of the meteorite collision with the Diorama's \"weather control function\". As the meteorites approach, the pterosaur strikes Nobita and Doraemon as they are drawing the circle.  As Nobita hangs onto the pterosaur, Kyu is attempting to fly to reach and rescue Nobita, but Kyu is struggling immensely. As Kyu tries and tries, Kyu is slowly evolving as he starts to flap his wings and after multiple tries Kyu was able to fly. Kyu rescues Nobita right after Nobita lets go due to exhaustion. From gliding to flapping, from dinosaurs to birds, Jill and his colleagues marvel at the birth of history as the first step in evolution. The dinosaurs were rescued and settled on the island, and Nobita and his friends said goodbye to Kyu and Myu.

Rajendra is now a successful businessman, and owner of a movie theatre who yearns to produce a film of his own, despite his family's strong reservations. He is in constant contact with a renowned screenwriter named Vijayshankar, to develop the plot. \nHowever, Sindhu has recurring episodes of epilepsy and has PTSD \u2013 a direct consequence of her fears of being arrested, on account of her complicity in the murder of Tarun Chandrasekhar. Jealous of the family's rise in wealth, a number of villagers have resorted to spreading rumours about Sindhu having \"venereal connections\" with Tarun \u2013 much to Seetha's distress. \nSeetha's only source of solace is her friendly neighbor Saritha \u2013 a government clerk, who is often abused by her alcoholic husband, Sabu \u2013 a real estate broker. The Karnataka Police has been humiliated in their inability to decipher the truth behind Tarun's case. Meanwhile, Rajendra has an encounter with Tarun's father Mr. Chandrasekhar, who vainly begs the former to disclose the location of his son's remains. \nMeanwhile, Shreya comes home for spring break and invites her friends for a house party, despite Seetha's objections. With Rajendra remaining aloof to her concerns, Seetha spends more time with Saritha, and on one occasion, inadvertently blurts on the truth about her family's complicity in Tarun's death. Unbeknownst to her, Saritha and Sabu are actually married undercover cops, assigned by IG Prathap Narayan, who is a close friend and colleague of Roopa. \nAnnappa is released from prison. After struggling to make amends with his now-estranged family, he seeks to find employment. While coming to know that Rajendra's case is still ongoing, he recollects Rajendra's presence at the police station which was under construction. Realizing that Rajendra was indeed complicit in the murder, he tips Prathap \u2013 who later summons Roopa and Chandrasekhar from the U.S.A. \nAfter the trio bribes him with a sum of \u20b95 lakh (US$6,300), Annappa reveals Rajendra's presence at the then-unfinished police station on the night of 3 August.

Rajendra, Seetha, Shreya and Sindhu manage to maintain their alibi. However, Roopa reveals a voice-recording of Seetha's earlier confession to Saritha; the police had bugged the family residence earlier. Having exposed the family, Roopa turns to question Sindhu, resulting in the latter having another epileptic seizure. \nDistraught, Rajendra falsely confesses that he was the culprit in Tarun's murder. With the police satisfied, the family is released and Rajendra ends up being arrested, but Roopa isn't satisfied as she demands that Rajendra's family be punished as well. Later, Rajendra is placed on trial for Tarun's murder. Concurrently, Vijayshankar, having learned about Rajendra's arrest, pays a visit to Prathap, Roopa and Chandrasekhar. \nHe reveals that during his business collusions with Rajendra, the latter had fabricated a script for a future crime thriller, loosely based on Tarun's murder. He further reveals that Rajendra had published a novel, titled Drishya, based on the film script (although it was published under Vijayshankar's name, for copyright protection). The quartet is then informed that Rajendra had officially pleaded not guilty, with his legal defence submitting that he had been framed by the authorities, which had \"misused\" Drishya's plot as a means to incriminate him. \nRealizing that Rajendra's earlier confession matches with Drishya's plot, Prathap deduces that Rajendra had created the novel and the confession, as a part of a scheme to escape legal punishment. Even more surprising, the DNA tests conducted on the skeleton revealed that it doesn't match Tarun's DNA. Stunned, Vijayashankar divulges that Rajendra had fabricated an alternate climax for his film \u2013 in which the hero (Rajendra), in his bid to evade legal punishment, would procure the remains of another person of same age and sex, who had died owing to similar injuries like that of the villain by befriending the gravedigger of the cemetery where that said body had been interred. \nThe hero would keep the skeletal remains which he got from the cemetery with him for nearly three years, and befriend a security guard at the district medical college morgue under the pretext of offering him a chance in the film industry. On the night the remains excavated from the police station arrive at the morgue, after plying the security guard with drinks, the hero would switch the body in the morgue, just before the day the DNA analysis is to be performed.\nWith no physical evidence to prove his culpability, Rajendra is released on personal bail. Rajendra's lawyer requests the Judge to kindly direct the state police not to proceed against Rajendra and his family for the time being as they are approaching the High Court of Karnataka to stop all the proceedings against them in connection with the \"so-called\" crime. The Judge calls Prathap to his chambers and tells him that both Rajendra's and Chandrasekhar's families truly deserve justice but the legal system is unable to provide it to them. \nThe Judge also orders Prathap to end all investigations of Tarun's case, as unsolved cases are not new to the system. Outside the courthouse, Vijayashankar discloses to Roopa and Chandrasekhar that Rajendra's alternate climax had a tail end as well: the hero would transfer the villain's remains to his bereaved parents. Simultaneously, Rajendra has Tarun's cremated skeletal remains anonymously handed over to Roopa and Chandrasekhar.\nAs Chandrasekhar immerses Tarun's ashes into the river, Prathap convinces Roopa to let go of her enmity with Rajendra, saying that they will never succeed in punishing Rajendra since he is making good on his intent to protect his family.

After learning about Rambabu's case and a potential reward, he goes to Sahu to get the money, which Geetha and Prabhakar give him. Janardhan divulges what he saw, leading to the authorities excavating the station floor and discovering a skeleton. Rambabu, seeing this through CCTV cameras he had installed around the station, prepares for the worst.\nSahu, Geetha, and Prabhakar summon Rambabu's family for more questioning, but they maintain their alibi. However, Geetha plays a recording of Jyothi's confession to Sarita, defeating them. An enraged Geetha probes Anju about the case and triggers her fits. Desperate, Rambabu falsely confesses that he murdered Varun. With the police satisfied, the family is released, although Sahu plots to trap them all later. The next day, the police formally arrest Rambabu and place him on trial for Varun's murder. Having learned about this, Chandra goes to Sahu, Geetha, and Prabhakar and reveals Rambabu had written a movie script loosely based on the case and then published it as a novel under Chandra's name, titled Drushyam, to give the story copyright protection. Rambabu pleads not guilty and claims that the police used scenes from Drushyam as the basis of a forced confession, making them realize it was part of his scheme. Furthermore, the DNA tests reveal that the body isn't Varun's, to everyone's shock. Chandra reveals that Rambabu had created a different climax for his film: knowing his initial plan might fail, the hero immediately procures the remains of another young man who died of similar injuries by befriending the undertaker of the cemetery where the other body is buried. He keeps those remains for three years before befriending a security guard at the local morgue by promising him a role in the film. The night after the original body arrives at the morgue, the hero switches them before DNA samples are collected and burns the original body in secret.\nRambabu is released on bail due to lack of evidence and the police are temporarily prohibited from bothering the family. The judge calls Sahu to his chambers and tells him to stop pursuing the case, disclosing that unsolved cases \"are not new to the system\". Outside the courthouse, Chandra narrates the end of Rambabu's alternate climax to Geetha and Prabhakar - the hero would discreetly transfer the ashes to his bereaved parents and live with his sins. Simultaneously, Rambabu sends Varun's ashes anonymously to Geetha and Prabhakar with a message requesting they stop hounding his family. As Varun's father conducts the last rite, Sahu convinces Geetha to let go of her enmity, concluding that they will never win as Rambabu will do anything to protect his family. Sahu also states that Rambabu's life is punishment - he has to live in fear and always be prepared to evade the justice system.

It is critical for faster-than-light interstellar travel, as it grants Spacing Guild Navigators the limited prescience needed for safe navigation. Shaddam intends to have House Harkonnen retake the planet with the secret aid of his Sardaukar troops, eradicating House Atreides, whose spreading influence he considers a threat to his power. Leto is reluctant, but sees the advantages of controlling Arrakis and forming an alliance with its native population, skilled fighters known as the Fremen.\nLeto's concubine, Lady Jessica, is an acolyte of the Bene Gesserit, an exclusive sisterhood whose members possess advanced physical and mental abilities. As part of their centuries-long breeding program, they instructed her to bear a daughter whose son would become the Kwisatz Haderach, a Bene Gesserit and messianic superbeing with the clairvoyance necessary to guide humanity to a better future. However, she disobeyed and bore a son, Paul. Throughout his life he is trained by Leto's aides, Duncan Idaho, Gurney Halleck, Suk doctor Wellington Yueh, and the Mentat Thufir Hawat, while Jessica teaches him Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul confides in Jessica and Duncan that he is troubled by visions of the future. In response, the Reverend Mother and Imperial Truthsayer Gaius Helen Mohiam visits Caladan and subjects him to a death-alternative test to assess his humanity and impulse control, which he passes. Mohiam insists that Baron Vladimir Harkonnen spare Paul and Jessica during his coup, to which he duplicitously agrees.\nHouse Atreides arrives at Arrakeen, the fortress stronghold on Arrakis, where Duncan's advance party learned about the planet and Fremen. The natives revere Paul and Jessica, which Jessica explains is due to the Bene Gesserit sowing beliefs on the planet centuries earlier. Leto negotiates with the Fremen's chieftain, Stilgar, and meets planetologist and Imperial Judge of the Change Dr. Liet-Kynes, known outside the Fremen as Dr. Kynes. Kynes informs Leto, Paul, and Halleck of the dangers of spice harvesting, including giant sandworms which travel under the desert. During a flight, they spot a sandworm approaching a spice harvester with a stranded crew, whom they successfully rescue. However, Paul's exposure to the spice outside triggers intense premonitions.\nAfter a failed attempt to assassinate Paul, Leto places his soldiers on high alert. Yueh disables Arrakeen's shields and allows Harkonnen and Sardaukar troops to invade Arrakeen. He incapacitates Leto and tells him he made a deal to deliver him to Baron Harkonnen in exchange for freeing his captive wife. Yueh replaces one of Leto's teeth with a poison gas capsule and is killed after delivering Leto to the Baron, who already had Yueh's wife dissected anyway. Leto releases the gas, killing himself and everyone inside, although the Baron survives but is wounded. Duncan manages to escape. Harkonnens capture Paul and Jessica, though the latter kills their captors using a Bene Gesserit skill known as \"the Voice\", a means of controlling others verbally. Stranded in the desert, they spend the night in a tent, where Paul has visions of a \"holy war\" spreading across the universe in his name.\nBaron Harkonnen gives command of Arrakis to his nephew, Rabban, and orders him to restart spice production to recover his costs. Paul and Jessica are found by Duncan and Kynes. They head to an old research station, but are found by the Sardaukar. Paul discloses his plan to marry one of Shaddam's daughters to avert the civil war that would ensue from news of the Emperor's treachery. Duncan sacrifices himself to enable them to escape. They separate, but Kynes is caught and stabbed by Imperial troops, so she summons a sandworm that devours them all. In the deep desert, Paul and Jessica encounter Stilgar's tribe, including Chani, the girl in Paul's visions.

One of his workmen fell into the dangerously turbulent waters of the river. Unhesitatingly, he dived in and rescued the man. By chance driving by, Adrienne Bourg\u00e8s, then unknown to Eiffel, saw the rescue. To prevent further such accidents, Eiffel asked a wealthy local bourgeois, who by chance happened to be Adrienne's father, for wood for safety scaffolding. Bourg\u00e8s invited him to lunch, where he sat with many others including Adrienne, who pretended that she hadn't seen the rescue, but still indicated that she admired him.

At the last moment, she confessed that she had seen the rescue.\nThreaded through the film are more memories. As Eiffel designs the Tour, he recalls the birthday party, at which they played musical chairs, and Eiffel and Adrienne smiled at each other. When she saw him alone, as a birthday present, he gave her a copy of an old book on the art of building metal bridges. She told him that she recognised his individuality, and suddenly kissed him on the cheek. Surprised, he withdrew as she rejoined the many at the party.\nAnother time during the building of the bridge over the Garonne, one evening, she went walking around the works and they encountered each other. He invited her into his office or quarters. He told her that she was charming, but still a spoiled child, just toying with him. She walked out in dudgeon. He soon called after her, but she kept walking and deliberately fell backwards into the river. He ran and jumped in to rescue her. They were wet and cold. He lit the stove in his office, put a blanket on her, and they held each other to get warm. Then they kissed closely, and again. And more closely.\nSoon their passion grew. They thought of marriage. These memories perhaps sustain Eiffel through the vicissitudes of his delivery of the Tour. Suddenly, Adrienne went away from home. Her father told Eiffel that she had been stringing him along, and no longer wanted to marry him. Eiffel didn't believe him, and seized him by his coat lapels. Bourg\u00e8s threw Eiffel to the ground and drove off. Eiffel picked himself up and resolved to wait for Adrienne.

Finding the gates closed, she climbed up to go over them, but fell on one of their points, and sustained a penetrating abdominal wound.\nThese memories also come up when Adrienne and Eiffel meet during the construction of the Tour, and Eiffel sees the scar from the old injury; they recall their youthful passion. The baby was lost, and Adrienne was still wounded, when she married Antoine de Restac. For this reason, and for the sake of Eiffel's reputation and the Tour, Adrienne stays with her husband and renounces Eiffel, who thereupon orders the construction to be completed with rivets instead of bolts, so that the Tour can never be torn down.", "tmdb_id": 655082}, "61345469": {"title": "The Electrical Life of Louis Wain", "plot": "In 1881, 18 months after his father's death, Louis Wain, the only male and eldest of the Wain family, becomes the primary breadwinner.

Meanwhile, both the North and South Korean embassies are lobbying to be admitted into the United Nations and looking towards the Somali government for support. \nKang Dae-jin, an intelligence officer recently assigned to the South Korean embassy, is tasked with passing gifts from the South Korean government to President Barre. He meets Han Sin-seong, the ambassador in Somalia, who is running late to the meeting with the president and thus immediately takes the gifts. While en route to the presidential palace, rebels intercept the ambassador and rob the gifts. They further spray his car with bullets, forcing him and his secretary, Gong Su-cheol, to run to the presidential palace. The two men miss the appointment by fifteen minutes and are thus denied an audience with the president. As Sin-seong attempts to explain their delay, he catches a glimpse of the North Korean ambassador, Rim Yong-su, being escorted into a meeting room. In his view, Somalia's support for North Korea will prevent South Korea from joining the UN. Sin-seong initially believes Yong-su to be the mastermind behind the robbery, but it is revealed that the North Korean embassy's intelligence officer, Tae Joon-ki, was the one who bribed the rebels to delay and rob Sin-seong. Knowing what happened, Yong-su tells Joon-ki that this was a shameless act that was unhelpful and possibly detrimental to the North Korean efforts.\nDae-jin reveals to Sin-Seong that he had bribed a Western journalist with a packet of cigarettes for photos depicting rebels wielding North Korean-made firearms, thus implying that North Korea is supplying weapons to both the Somali government and the rebels. When Sin-seong questions this, Dae-jin dismisses his concerns, stating that if the photos are published, the Somali government will condemn North Korea even if the latter is not ultimately responsible for the weapons. The next day they meet with the Somali foreign minister at a hotel, showing him the photos. However the minister does not care and instead asks for bribes. Disgusted, Sin-seong leaves the meeting and spots North Korean Ambassador Rim moving gifts into the minister's car. Sin-seong confronts him about the robbery earlier; the latter counters that the South was no better for framing the North for supplying weapons to the rebels. Before the two come to blows, shots ring out outside the hotel - the civil war has reached Mogadishu.\nBoth North and South Korean diplomats are stranded in the hotel for hours as the Somali government imposes a lockdown on Mogadishu. Meanwhile at the South Korean embassy, Sin-seong's wife, Myeung-hee, and the other diplomats, are startled by the ringing doorbell; apparently the ambassador's Somali driver, Sawma, has stumbled into the embassy, badly wounded. Su-cheol carries him inside, but upon laying him on a bed he notices Sawma's scarf bearing the markings of General Aidid's rebels. While the diplomats contemplate on what to do with him in fear that he was actually a rebel, the police suddenly arrive and try to barge their way into the compound. Sin-seong and Dae-jin arrive just in time to ward them off. Meanwhile, Sawma had slipped out of the embassy, and while running on the streets, the police catch up to him and bludgeon him to death. \nThe next day riots have broken out at every area of Mogadishu. General Aidid has also sent messages to all embassies to either work with them to topple the Barre regime, or be deemed an enemy and be prepared to be slaughtered. Sin-seong, fearing for Myeung-hee's safety, tries sending her back to South Korea, but is unable to do so as all banks and travel agencies have been shut, thus leaving everyone stranded in Mogadishu. As the Somali military finally retaliates with lethal force, both the North and South Korean diplomats realize that the situation has spiraled out of control and with both power and communication networks all being broken, they must leave the country as quickly as possible. Sin-seong and Dae-jin head to the airport but are sent back as they are unable to communicate to the home government in Seoul, and lack official documents of clearance. Likewise, the North Koreans fail to make it to the airport, and are sent back to their embassy.\nIn his desperation, Joon-ki sends for the rebel leader that he had previously employed to rob the South Koreans, for his assistance to get passes for the North Korean diplomats to get to the airport. However, the rebel leader betrays Joon-ki just as he set foot into the compound and the rebels started beating the men, robbing the entire place, and sexually harassing the women. Joon-ki, though beaten heavily, is spared as he once paid the rebels well for the job. \nWith supplies nearly gone, Yong-su orders an evacuation and to head to the Chinese embassy for shelter, only to find it abandoned and being looted by rebels. They are discovered by a group of child soldiers, who point their rifles at them. The children in the North Korean posse pretend that they were shot and collapse on the ground; the adults follow suit. The child soldiers happily shoot in the air in victory, attracting the attention of more rebels. The North Koreans swiftly flee and stumble right outside the South Korean embassy. Seeing no other option, Yong-su decides to ask the South Koreans for help, despite Joon-ki protesting that doing so would risk being labeled as traitors in Pyongyang. He yells for sanctuary, within earshot of Sin-seong, who is suspicious of the North Koreans's motives. Just then, a group of rebels close towards the embassy, firing their guns wildly in the air, but are driven away by the security detail that Dae-jin had obtained from the police. With the North Koreans now in the line of danger, Sin-seong relents and opens the gate to let them in. \nAs dinner is served, the North Koreans dare not touch the food in fear that the South Koreans had laced it with poison. Sin-seong swaps his rice bowl with Yong-su\u2019s and eats from it, proving that the food wasn\u2019t poisoned. Relieved, both sides start eating and sharing food. Dae-jin, sensing an opportunity to use the dinner as a ploy for propaganda, covertly takes pictures and steals the North Koreans\u2019s diplomatic passports to make defection certificates, but Joon-ki catches him, and a fistfight breaks out between the two. Yong-su and Sin-seong step in and tear them both apart, lamenting that political ideologies no longer matter, but sheer survival and working together to escape Mogadishu. \nWith both the Americans and Chinese already having fled Mogadishu, both ambassadors agree to seek help from their other allies that are still in the city; with Sin-seong heading to the Italian embassy while Yong-su heading to the Egyptian embassy. At the drack of dawn, Joon-ki and Yong-su reach the Egyptian embassy only to find it filled with refugees and no possible aid. Meanwhile at the Italian embassy, the Italian ambassador informs Sin-seong and Dae-jin that the South Koreans can join the Red Cross's evacuation flight to Mombasa, Kenya, but that the North Koreans cannot, as Italy and North Korea do not have diplomatic relations. Sin-seong lies that the North Koreans are defectors to the South but that they cannot prove this until their return. The Italian ambassador accept this and allows the entire party to board the plane, requiring all to arrive by 4pm.\nWith this assurance, the Koreans make preparations to leave, including taping the cars with bags of dirt and books as makeshift armor, and making white flags out of their clothes. The convoy depart during Islamic prayer time, allowing them to pass through the city unscathed while the rebels are in prayer. At a Somali army roadblock. Dae-jin, driving the lead car, attempts to negotiate with the commander for passage, but Su-cheol, driving the last car, sticks his white flag out of the window. The guards mistake the pole for a gun and start firing at the Koreans, forcing them to retreat. The convoy, already being pursued the Somali army, runs into a group of looting rebels, who chase after them as well. \nEventually, the Koreans arrive right outside the Italian embassy. Realizing where they are, the Somali army ceases firing, and suddenly, the street turns into a tense Mexican standoff. Italian troops open the gates and secure the Koreans, while both the Somali army and the rebels retreat from the area. Joon-ki, whose car had separated from the convoy and was last to arrive, dies from the bullet wounds he had sustained; he is buried inside the Italian embassy. The next day, the Koreans board the plane as promised by the Italians and are flown to Mombasa.\nAs the plane lands, Sin-seong realizes that both parties have separate delegations waiting to intercept their respective groups. Despite working together for survival in Somalia, Yong-su and Sin-seong conclude that they cannot be seen together, as neither nation will believe their experiences but instead send them to their respective military tribunals for court martial.

After class bully Dean Paxton insults Jamie and Pritti for their differences and Jamie sticks up for Pritti, Pritti returns the favour by encouraging Jamie to wear the shoes to the school prom and be the drag queen he wants to be (\"Spotlight\").\nMargaret goes to see Wayne at his girlfriend Cheryl's house, and admonishes him for not showing up for Jamie at all on his sixteenth birthday and for his lack of parental efforts. Wayne replies that Cheryl is pregnant with their son and urges Margaret to tell Jamie the truth - that he is bitterly disappointed that Jamie is not a stereotype male, and that he wants nothing at all to do with him, especially as Jamie is now no longer a minor.\nJamie goes to a drag shop, House of Loco, where he intends to find his first dress. Hugo Battersby, the drag shop owner, briefly discusses Jamie\u2019s dreams of being a drag queen with him, and reveals that he was himself once a drag superstar, Miss Loco Chanelle, and that his past was filled with a loving drag family that was destroyed when the AIDS epidemic ravaged the community and claimed the life of his male lover (\"This Was Me\").

They decide that the only way to rectify the repulsive state of the world is to destroy humanity, and that to achieve this, everything must be redone and perfected from the beginning, from true nothingness. Their plan is to recreate the planet from its very origin, which requires the massive amount energy generated by incinerating all life across 3000 years.\nWaking up from the vision, Ritsuka and Mash find they have arrived at Time Temple. Leonardo da Vinci reports a Beast is detected throughout the entire space. Lev Lainur Flauros appears before them, commending Chaldea for getting past the Seventh Singularity while simultaneously expressing surprise and disgust at their persistent survival. When questioned if he had intended to destroy Chaldea and humanity from the very beginning, Lev reveals that he has been serving Solomon for 3000 years: Demon Gods were implanted in mage lineages until they were awakened at their appointed era under their own Grand Order. He was designated to 2016 A.D., and when he awoke as the last Demon God, humanity was incinerated. In turn, Da Vinci reveals that Chaldea survived because Romani Archaman spent a decade preparing for the Incineration of Humanity that he envisioned in a dream, despite not knowing who to trust until Da Vinci's summoning. Lev Lainur had intended to kill Romani with the Control Room explosion, but that plan was thwarted thanks to Ritsuka's accidental intervention.\nUnconcerned, as Solomon's final calculations are due to be complete in a matter of hours, Lev transforms into Flauros to stop Ritsuka and Mash from reaching the Throne. The pair kill him, but he is immediately reborn, mocking them as Chaldea is attacked by eight other Demon Gods. The entire space is revealed to be made of Demon Gods, and Flauros asserts that, \"As long as the Throne exists, there will always be seventy-two Demon Gods.\" However, he is thwarted in his next attempt to kill Ritsuka by the sudden arrival of Jeanne d'Arc, who heralds the autonomous summoning of many Heroic Spirits to the Time Temple through their connection with Ritsuka. She rallies the Servants to clear a path to the Throne and they begin to defend Chaldea and engage the Demon Gods, killing the Pillars as endlessly as they can regenerate.\nAs the Servants aiding Chaldea continue defeating the Demon Gods, Baal asks Solomon to activate Ars Almadel Salomonis to incinerate the Heroic Spirits. Solomon assesses that they would keep returning as long as Ritsuka exists, reflecting the Demon Gods' own immortality as long as Solomon himself exists, and thus they only need to kill Ritsuka.\nAfter conquering the seven terminals protecting Solomon's Throne, Chaldea learn of an eighth terminal and are uncertain how to proceed as the Heroic Spirits who aided Ritsuka and Mash with the previous terminals were connected to the Seven Singularities. They prepare to fight alone, but then Servants from the minor Singularities and Singularity candidates arrive to help them defeat Andromalius and the Demon Gods administrating the Trash Heap.\nWith the Demon Gods' activity diminished by their constant fighting with the Heroic Spirits, a path opens to the Throne. As Ritsuka and Mash hurry towards the location, Romani reasons that Solomon cannot be a fake, as the Time Temple was created from Solomon's Magic Circuits, and instead deduces something inside Solomon's body is controlling his corpse. After resurrecting his corpse, \"Solomon\" implanted the Demon Gods in preparation for the Incineration of Humanity. Afterwards, he created the Time Temple, which exists outside time and space, and waited there until the year 2016.\nUpon arriving at his throne, \"Solomon\" announces to Ritsuka and Mash that the final calculations for the First Virtual Noble Phantasm, Ars Nova, are nearly complete. He explains he possesses three Noble Phantasms: the First is Ars Nova, and the Second is the Temple itself, Ars Paulina. The Third is Ars Almadel Salomonis, the light bands in the sky that were created from the energy gathered from incinerating humanity when he fractured history with his Singularities. \"Solomon\" needs it all to achieve the \"ultimate position\" and conquer death itself if humans will not. He then fights Ritsuka and Mash, intending to kill the last Master of Humanity as they are the anchor for the Heroic Spirits. Eventually Mash notices a strange reading on his Spirit Origin, and Ritsuka sees that one of his rings differs from the others. Impressed, \"Solomon\" decides to reveals his true form. As Demon Gods cover the throne, he identifies himself as a Beast of Calamity, the first familiar created by Solomon that served as the foundation for human magecraft. He had ruled alongside Solomon and continued to exist as a primordial curse after Solomon's death, taking took control of Solomon's corpse and incarnating himself through a summoning spell. With his true form unveiled, he identifies himself as Goetia, the Human Order Incineration Ritual and King of Demon Gods, and Beast I.\nGoetia declares his plan to travel back to the genesis of the planet and absorb all of its energy to create a new planet without death. The purpose of the Incineration of Humanity was for gathering 3000 years worth of magical energy to accomplish this feat. Ritsuka and Mash attempt to defeat him before he can activate Ars Almadel Salomonis but they are too late. Goetia offers to let Mash join him, believing she would understand his views on death since she was created with a limited lifespan. Mash rejects due to her experiences with Ritsuka, so Goetia launches Ars Almadel Salomis. Mash protects Ritsuka with Lord Camelot, but the heat of Goetia's Noble Phantasm vaporizes her, leaving only her shield.\nGoetia prepares to launch his Noble Phantasm again when Romani suddenly arrives. Romani removes his glove to reveal Solomon's tenth ring, which had been sent into the future by Solomon. Marisbury Animusphere had used it as catalyst to summon Solomon in the Holy Grail War of 2004. Romani explains that Solomon's wish on the Grail had been to become human, however, he had foreseen the Incineration of Humanity just as all of his power left him. Romani then manifests as his original self, the true Solomon, having abandoned his wish. Goetia attacks him in fury, but Solomon, with all of his rings present, activates the true Ars Nova. This sacrifices his existence as a Heroic Spirit to remove Goetia's immortality. Before disappearing, Solomon reveals Goetia was originally a spell created to watch over humanity, but Goetia turned away from that duty after seeing humanity's suffering and atrocities. Goetia again attempts to kill Ritsuka to remove the Heroic Spirits, intending to activate Ars Almadel Salomonis before the union of the Demon Gods that comprise him completely collapses.\nWith Solomon's sacrifice, the Time Temple begins to collapse, and the Demon Gods are thrown into disarray: they either self-destruct, are destroyed by the Heroic Spirits, change side, or flee. Goetia's body begins to crumble away due to Ars Nova destroying the Demon Gods' union. Even when only three Demon Gods remain, he refuses to admit defeat and continues trying to kill Ritsuka. Ritsuka retaliates by protecting themself with Mash's shield and seemingly destroys Goetia with a punch empowered by a Command Spell. They try to hurry back to the Rayshift point but are stopped by Goetia in a human form made from all that remains of the Demon Gods. Now understanding human mentality with his newly gained mortality, Goetia tries to kill Ritsuka to protect his pride. After Ritsuka defeats him, Goetia disappears contently. Ritsuka continues on their way, but the path beneath them collapses before they reach the Rayshift point.

As the Purge begins, Adela witnesses a nationalist Purger group, who declare themselves to be a \"Purge Purification Force\" (PPF) that intend to kill those people that they consider non-American. The group passes by without hostility, and the migrant community survives the Purge with no incidents. Come morning, Juan and Adela return to their jobs, but both notice that many of their co-workers did not report to work. Shortly after, Adela is attacked by two Purgers but she is rescued by her boss Darius before both are arrested by police for killing their attackers.\nMeanwhile, Juan and fellow migrant co-worker T.T. discover that the Tucker family has been taken hostage by their farmhands, who reveal themselves as Purgers intending to take the ranch for themselves. Ranch owner Caleb Tucker sacrifices himself and distracts the Purgers long enough for Juan and T.T. to rescue his son Dylan, Dylan's pregnant wife Cassie, and his sister Harper, who offer them a ride to search for Adela. Nationwide news struggles to understand why civilians continue to celebrate the Purge after its ending. The group rescue Adela and Darius after the police van carrying them is ambushed by more Purgers. Darius stays behind to search for his family while the others escape from a burning Austin. At a gas station, they hear news reports about chaos, murder, and destruction in all fifty American states, with local emergency services overwhelmed, in an event described as the \"Forever Purge\".

Fighting through El Paso, Adela and Cassie are split from the group by military forces while Juan, T.T., Dylan, and Harper are captured by the PPF, with their leader (referred to as \"Alpha\") offering Dylan and Harper a chance to live if they kill T.T. and Juan. When they refuse, the Purgers murder T.T. before the military intervenes, allowing the group to escape. However, the military is forced to withdraw when their base is destroyed by more Purgers. In response, the Canadian and Mexican governments announce the early closure of their borders, leaving those who tried to cross them vulnerable to the Purgers.\nDowntown, Adela protects Cassie from other Purgers, revealing that she and Juan had once been members of a self-defense group who trained them to fight against Mexican drug cartels before they arrived to the United States.

The worsening of the conflict puts the survival of the Circus at risk, so Israel proposes that the four of them attempt to travel to America; Fulvio, on the other hand, proposes that they find work at the prestigious Berlin Zircus, a sumptuous show put on by the Nazis who have occupied Rome. The Zircus is actually the realm of Franz, a German pianist with six fingers on each hand who possesses clairvoyant powers: he had a premonition of Hitler's suicide and the arrival of four beings with superhuman powers that could save the fate of the Third Reich (as well as various events and inventions that will happen in the years following the end of the conflict); for this reason he created the Zircus in order to gather all the freaks in the area, who undergo deadly torture in an attempt to identify the saviors.\nIsrael manages to convince the four freaks to leave for America, but after collecting their savings he disappears.

While he was hospitalised after being found, he used to scream as if he was dying whenever a nurse or female doctor approached him. He was completely desensitized to violence and has anger management issues. Though Shiva is mostly unreactive when he himself was harmed, if somebody threatened to harm his loved ones or people close to him, he used to erupt like a volcano and was capable of unspeakable things.

Kong is visited by Jia, the last Iwi native and adopted daughter of Kong expert Ilene Andrews, who is deaf and communicates with Kong via sign language.\nBernie Hayes, an employee of Apex Cybernetics and host of a Titan conspiracy podcast, extracts data suggesting sinister activities at Apex's Pensacola facility. However, Godzilla suddenly attacks the facility; Bernie stumbles on a massive device during the rampage. Madison Russell, a listener of Bernie's podcast, enlists her friend Josh to investigate Godzilla's attacks.\nApex CEO Walter Simmons recruits Nathan Lind, a former Monarch scientist and Hollow Earth theorist, to guide a search for a power source into the Hollow Earth, the homeworld of the Titans. Nathan is initially hesitant as his brother died in an expedition to the Hollow Earth due to a strong reverse-gravitational effect. He agrees after Walter reveals that Apex has developed HEAVs, specialized crafts able to withstand the pressure exerted by the gravity field.\nNathan convinces Ilene to let Kong guide them through the Hollow Earth via an outpost in Antarctica. Nathan, Ilene, and an Apex team led by Walter's daughter Maia board a modified barge escorted by the U.S. Navy that carries a sedated and restrained Kong. Godzilla attacks the convoy and defeats Kong but retreats after the ships disable their power and trick him into thinking they are destroyed. To avoid alerting Godzilla, Kong is airlifted to the Hollow Earth entrance, and Jia convinces him to enter the tunnel while the team follows him in the HEAVs.\nMadison and Josh find Bernie, who joins their investigation. They sneak into the wrecked Apex base, discover a secret facility underground, and are inadvertently locked into an underground hyperloop-type transport to Apex headquarters in Hong Kong, where they unwittingly stumble on a test of Mechagodzilla. It is telepathically controlled by Ren Serizawa, the son of the late Ishir\u014d Serizawa, through the neural networks from the skull of a severed Ghidorah head, but is hobbled by its power supply's limitations. Walter intends to harness the Hollow Earth's energy to overcome Mechagodzilla's limitations.\nInside the Hollow Earth, Kong and the team find an ecosystem similar to Skull Island. They discover his species' ancestral throne room, where they find remains of an ancient war with Godzilla's kind and a glowing axe made from another Godzilla's dorsal plates. As they identify the power source, the Apex team sends its signature back to their Hong Kong base despite Ilene's protests. Attracted by Mechagodzilla's activation, Godzilla arrives in Hong Kong. Sensing Kong and the hollow earth's energy, Godzilla directly drills a shaft to the throne room with his atomic breath. Maia and the Apex team attempt to escape in the ensuing mayhem, but their HEAV is crushed by Kong. Kong, Ilene, Jia, and Nathan ascend to Hong Kong, where Kong engages Godzilla in a final battle. Kong initially gains the upper hand; however, Godzilla emerges victorious after incapacitating Kong.\nMadison, Josh, and Bernie are caught by security and taken to Walter. Despite Ren's concerns over the power source's volatility, Walter orders him to activate Mechagodzilla. Now possessed by Ghidorah's consciousness, Mechagodzilla kills Walter, electrocutes Ren, engages Godzilla in battle, and eventually overwhelms him.

As she retreats, Hilda stumbles upon a huge cave with dozens of bells hanging from the top of the entrance. Inside, she finds a gigantic troll, who calls himself Trundle. He tells Hilda he will help her become human again if she completes some tasks for him. He also assures her that Trylla means no harm, and Hilda reluctantly returns to Trylla. They retreat into the Stone Forest to escape the rising sun. When the two arrive outside the mountains, Hilda \"feels\" a strange sound, which Trylla explains is something that all trolls hear, calling them to the city of Trolberg, and that the call has been growing stronger lately.\nFrida and David discover Hilda's predicament when Baba escapes from Tontu's care and so Frida, against the advice of Kaisa, unsuccessfully attempts a body swap spell. Night falls again, and Hilda secretly brings a cup of troll mead to Trundle, the first task, who then instructs her to remove the bells that trap him in the cave. \nLater, Trylla shows Hilda the ruins of the castle of the Mountain King, a giant troll who tried to rally the trolls into attacking Trolberg, but was defeated. Hilda doubles down on helping Trundle after Trylla tells her that the changeling spell cannot be undone. She uses pillows, stolen from a troll's treasure collection, to silence and remove the bells. Elsewhere, Johanna and Alfur find the entrance to the Stone Forest, but the trolls close it before they can enter. The two are then attacked by a group of aggressive trolls and narrowly escape.\nThe following morning, Johanna begrudgingly seeks Erik's help as a last resort. Frustrated by being unable to help Hilda, Frida suggests that she and David sneak out of the city so she can try magically communicating with a troll like she did with the Kraken. Trundle sends Hilda on her final errand: to bring him a large red orb, hidden in the ruins of the castle among the hoard of the Mountain King. When Hilda touches it, she is thrown into a strange vision in which a giant creature resembling her mom looms over the walls of Trolberg. Hilda is then whisked back into reality, and she attempts to bring the red orb back to Trundle, only to be attacked by a giant bearded troll.\nOutside, Erik, Johanna, Baba, Alfur, and Tontu arrive at the entrance to the Stone Forest.

Meanwhile, Trundle begins destroying the bell towers but is halted by the arrival of the bearded troll, revealed to be his brother. Refusing to fight him, Trundle has his followers restrain his brother before breaching the city wall.\nThe Safety Patrol arrives to fight off the attack, with Ahlberg taking back control. Hilda, remembering the vision from Trundle's eye, realizes that the mother of all trolls lies underneath the city, and she will rise up to defend her children if the Safety Patrol attacks them, destroying all of Trolberg in the process. Hilda attempts to prevent the attack, but Ahlberg refuses to listen to her, and uses the Safety Patrol's cannon to destroy Trundle, awakening the mother troll. In a last-ditch attempt to stop him, Hilda takes Trundle's eye and throws it into Ahlberg's face, causing him to see a similar vision to what Hilda saw. Now understanding what is at stake, Ahlberg orders the Safety Patrol to stand down. \nThe mother troll stops trying to get up, and the trolls all walk peacefully to the center of the city where she rests, and using Frida's magic, Hilda and Frida learn her identity: Amma, the mother and grandmother of all trolls, having laid dormant for centuries so as to not disturb the humans who built Trolberg above her. For a while, the trolls could still reconnect with their buried mother, but then the settlers, unaware of Amma's presence and thus why the creatures kept wandering into the city, drove them away, eventually erecting a wall to keep them out.  Now that the trolls are close enough to Amma, they can finally hear her voice again, causing them to sprout plants all over their bodies.\nIn the aftermath, Ahlberg resigns after accepting a medal for his eventual handling of the crisis and hands control of the Safety Patrol to his deputy Gerda Gustav. Gustav immediately announces a \"Night of the Trolls\", in which the trolls are allowed into the city once a year to reunite with Amma. While some humans still fear the trolls and vice versa, the annual peaceful exposure is gradually eroding the mutual fear between the two species.

His starting point was the town of Ruth and his target was presumably a cabin he had approached on a previous expedition. When he was two days past his estimated return date and did not return home, his housemate Simon Rodgers alerted Gary's sister, Beverly Hinge, who in turn notified the police. More than a week had passed since Gary had last been seen.\nInitially, the police conducted a search based on the last GPS location of Gary's cell phone. Local and state police were involved, as well as park rangers and even volunteer groups. A few days later, it was reported that Gary's truck had been found, 55 miles from his departure in Ruth, Nevada, at the end of a dirt road at the bottom of a small hill. This finding prompted search parties, who covered large areas on foot, by helicopter and with the use of drones. None of the groups were able to find any trace or indication of Gary's location. When several more days passed without any news, the police terminated the search, as they considered that the chances of finding Gary alive were already practically nil, due to the fact that he used to travel with minimal supplies, water and equipment, which left him at the mercy of the weather (the hottest time of the year) and other dangers, such as the local fauna or the fact that there are multiple abandoned mining pits in the area. As time went by, the media stopped reporting on it. Subsequently, Beverly hired a private investigator, William 'Bill' Salerno, so that the case would not be abandoned. A reporter from a local media outlet, Gal Roberts, decided to convince her editor to keep on top of the story, lest it be forgotten as a \"cold case\".\nThus, the investigation then focused on the clues that could be obtained from the truck, now considered a crime scene. Two aspects stood out; first, numerous fingerprints that did not match Gary Hinge's were found all over the truck, especially on the steering wheel. In addition, a trail of barefoot footprints, also not matching Gary's, was found. Since the John Doe's fingerprints did not match any database, the police found themselves at a dead end. In parallel, Bill Salerno started digging into Gary's social networks and Gal Roberts finds a promising clue in the video blog where Gary used to post his hiking and survival adventures, under the alias \"Scorpion Sam\". The hiker had some 50,000 followers, a fact unknown to his family and people close to him. Several of his readers believe they have some idea about Gary's final whereabouts, and that the question about his final destination could be related to some of his publications.\nIn the next to last of the published videos, Gary appears in frame from his home, narrating a very unusual experience, which had left him very disturbed: In his last excursion, he had been walking for three days in an unknown area, when he noticed the smell of smoke. Following that trail, he found a dilapidated-looking cabin, as if abandoned, but with smoke coming out of an old chimney. However, a sense of \"imminent danger\" caused him to move away from the site and make camp away from the area. The next morning, Gary reported that he found a trail of barefoot footprints, and on the way back to his truck, he felt he was being watched, and even felt he was being followed. This publication had a lot of comments, most of them negative, where followers expressed serious doubts about Gary's account, questioning why he had not recorded anything and did not present any evidence; another large number of comments were from users demanding him to give the coordinates of the place and another part of the visitors of his blog challenged him to come back. Feeling the victim of cyber-bullying and visibly affected, Gary recorded and uploaded one last video, explaining that he would not give the exact location of the mystery cabin, since he did not want to encourage inexperienced people to venture into those desert regions, and informed that he would return to the site, accompanied by his video camera and a gun for protection.\n\nSeveral weeks after the truck was found and search and rescue efforts were completed, a group of hikers in White Pine County reported that a backpack, which turned out to be the property of Gary Hinge, had been left at their campsite. Upon checking the contents of the backpack, aside from Gary's belongings and identification, his severed hand was found, still holding his video camera. Forensic analysis revealed that the hand had been severed from the victim while he was still alive, within a period of no more than five weeks. When authorities examined the memory card inserted into the camera, they discovered what happened to Gary on one fateful night.\nThe footage found reveals that Gary was indeed able to find his way back to the mystery cabin; his first video entry was recorded at dusk, mentioning that he had been on the road for a day and a half and was sure of the route. Subsequently, he finds various markers he had left from his previous visit. Next, the following recordings consist of video fragments all recorded under infrared light, starting with Gary talking very frightened; he comments that he is already very close to the cabin and that he can smell smoke, as in the previous time. Suddenly, he hears chanting that seems to be a human voice, although it seems distorted. Once he finds the cabin, Gary confirms that it is the same one he saw earlier. While filming the outside of the cabin, Gary detects a human silhouette moving towards him. Being very careful not to make noise on the rocky ground, Gary tries to move away from the site, but is eventually spotted by a human-like being, but with severe physical deformities, who attacks him and the camera stops recording.\nBoth the reporter and the private investigator speculate what or who might have attacked and killed Gary; it is mentioned that the police have made this footage public in the hope that someone in the audience might offer some additional clue, which has sparked a series of conspiracy theories linking Gary's disappearance to real or supernatural issues as diverse as Area 51, atomic testing, local Indigenous rituals, satanic groups or extraterrestrials. However, Gal Roberts expresses serious concerns about the fact that at least 17 social media accounts have taken it upon themselves to make expeditions to the area. Additionally, one of these groups is said to have posted that they have managed to find the trail of the cabin and its mysterious occupant, and that they will reveal the results of their expedition in 2022.", "tmdb_id": 805682}, "67902853": {"title": "Hostel (2021 film)", "plot": "The film is set in Sverdlovsk in 1984.

Patrizia and Maurizio marry, and he gets a job at the trucking company. \nWhen Patrizia becomes pregnant, she sees her child as an avenue for familial reconciliation. She lets it slip to Maurizio's uncle Aldo that she is pregnant; he is delighted by the news and takes the couple under his wing. \nAldo introduces Patrizia to his eccentric son Paolo, who aspires to be a designer within Gucci despite his lack of talent. Aldo helps Maurizio and a terminally ill Rodolfo reconcile shortly before the latter's death. Rodolfo writes Maurizio back into his will, but fails to sign a document transferring the Gucci shares to him before he dies. Patrizia forges Rodolfo's signature, giving Maurizio a 50% interest in Gucci.\nPatrizia devises a plot to obtain controlling interest in Gucci by acquiring some of Aldo and Paolo's shares (they hold the other 50% interest). She clashes with Aldo over the firm's clandestine sale of cheap \"fake\" Gucci products on the black market, and begins to consult Giuseppina \"Pina\", a psychic, for guidance. She manipulates Maurizio, who has little real interest in Gucci, into taking a more active role within the company. \nPaolo acquires proof that Aldo has been evading taxes in the United States; he gives this to Patrizia in exchange for her promise that he will be allowed to design his own line. Aldo is arrested by the IRS and sentenced to a year and a day in prison. \nPatrizia lies to the Italian police and tells them that Paolo is not authorized to use the Gucci trademark, so they stop his fashion show by force.

His family flees to Switzerland, where Maurizio meets his old friend Paola Franchi.

He orders his wife and daughter to return to Italy and begins an affair with Paola, which Pina seemingly senses. \nWhen Maurizio's business plans harm the company, he seeks assistance from equity company Investcorp, through which he hatches a scheme to acquire shares of the company from a now-impoverished Paolo. Aldo returns from prison and immediately realizes what Paolo has done. When Investcorp offers to buy Aldo out, he refuses until Maurizio reveals himself as the deal's instigator. Dejected, Aldo sells the shares and cuts contact with Maurizio.\nPatrizia attempts a reconciliation with Maurizio, but he flatly ignores her. Later, he asks her for a divorce through his long-time assistant Domenico De Sole, which she refuses. Maurizio recruits up-and-coming designer Tom Ford to revitalize the company's image through a new line. His products are successful, but Maurizio has so thoroughly mismanaged the company that, by 1995, Investcorp's leaders feel compelled to buy him out, replacing him with Tom and Domenico. \nPatrizia eventually grows so furious with Maurizio that she asks Pina to help her assassinate him. She puts her in contact with two hitmen.

He hires McCann and Gurty, along with a young Indigenous woman known only as Tantoo. Also joining the rescue mission is actuary Varnay, responsible for insurance risk assessment for Katka, the company which owns the mine. $200,000 is split between the four truckers, which will be redistributed among the survivors if anyone dies. Meanwhile, the miners are communicating with Katka executives using Tap code, and Katka General Manager Sickle transmits a message that they plan to free the men by blasting a tunnel.\nThe team leaves for the mine with three wellheads. During the trip, Goldenrod's engine seizes. While attempting to repair it, the ice beneath his trailer breaks and his leg gets trapped. Knowing he can't escape, he convinces Tantoo to sever the strap attaching him to the truck, causing him to drown but saving the other two rigs and wellheads. In an attempt to flee the rapidly approaching pressure wave and cracking ice, the remaining two trucks fishtail and roll over, stopping the pressure wave.\nVarnay convinces Mike to accuse Tantoo of sabotaging Goldenrod's rig, but Tantoo reveals her brother Cody is amongst the miners. When they continue to interrogate her, she pulls out a pistol, but Gurty disarms her and ties her up. After the men right the trucks, Varnay locks Mike and Gurty in the back of their rig. Varnay is revealed to have been the one who sabotaged Goldenrod's rig, and knocks Tantoo unconscious.

Mike and Gurty arrive and kill the Katka contractors pursuing Tantoo.\nAfter Tantoo runs out of fuel due to Varnay disconnecting her fuel equalizer, he catches up to her, but Mike crashes his rig into Varnay's truck, sending it off a cliff. Varnay survives and creates an avalanche with dynamite. Mike and Gurty escape, but Tantoo is hit by snow and wounded by a branch. They uncouple her trailer, and drive off with the wellhead. Varnay pursues them in Tantoo's rig and begins ramming them. Mike boards Varnay's rig and both fall from the truck. After a struggle, Mike attempts to drive away, but Varnay climbs onto the rig.

They defeat the rival  Heike clan at the Battle of Dan-no-ura, wherein the child emperor drowns while carrying the Grasscutter Sword. Three hundred years later, agents of Ashikaga Yoshimitsu hire young Tomona and his father to retrieve a box from a Heike shipwreck. They find a sword inside the box. Not realizing that it is the Grasscutter Sword, Tomona's father unsheathes the sword, letting loose a blade of energy that cuts him in half and blinds Tomona. Tomona then goes on a years long journey to find answers for what happened, with the ghost of his father accompanying him. He meets a member of a whole troupe of blind biwa players, and decides to learn the biwa and join the troupe. Tomona changes his name to \"Tomoichi\", but the name change makes it difficult for his father's spirit to find him.\nAt the same time, a Noh dance troupe leader dons a demonic mask. A series of murders of biwa players follow, and then the leader's third son is born with three stubby limbs, a very elongated right arm, skin covered in scales, and a hideously deformed face. The troupe leader has such contempt for his deformed son that he forces him to always wear a mask and treats him like a dog. But one day, the deformed son sees his father try to teach Noh dancing to his other sons. The deformed son practices along with them, and his dance magically restores his legs.\nThe deformed son wanders the village and soon meets Tomoichi. He bonds with Tomoichi as he can't see his deformity, and so he reveals to him that he has chosen the name \"Inu-Oh\" (lit. \"Dog King\") for himself. Tomoichi tells Inu-Oh about how he can see his father's spirit, and he then notices that many spirits of Heike warriors surround Inu-Oh, telling him their stories. This vision inspires the two to form a new performing troupe, with Tomoichi now renaming himself \"Tomoari\".\nSoon after, a long-haired Tomoari debuts the new act on a bridge, performing his song in a style resembling modern hair metal. Below the bridge, Inu-Oh dances to the music, telling a story of how the Heike soldiers tied their arms to their ships but then lost all the arms when their ships sank. At the end of the song, both of Inu-Oh's arms change to normal length. Their act is an instant hit, and Tomoari and Inu-Oh become huge celebrities.\nIn their next performance, about the Heike warriors waiting for a \"whale that never arrived\", the scales on Inu-Oh's skin disappear. But the new troupe arouses the attention of Ashikaga, who only wants his clan's version of the Heike stories told. He sends agents to Inu-Oh's now envious father, offering fame if he sabotages his son's act.\nThe troupe's next act reveals the truth behind Inu-Oh's origin: his father made a deal with the demon mask for fame. The demon mask demanded the lives of biwa players, and the innocence of his unborn son. The murders that followed released the spirits of Heike soldiers that followed the players, but the spirits flocked to Inu-Oh instead of his father, helping him win fame and undo his curse. His father demands the mask kill Inu-Oh, violating the terms of their original agreement. Outraged, the mask kills Inu-Oh's father instead.\nAt the end of the performance, Inu-Oh's face is restored. However, Ashikaga cracks down on the troupe, forcing Tomoari to stop playing. Ashikaga himself demands that Inu-Oh perform only the official version of Heike history, or else he will behead Tomoari. Inu-Oh concedes. However, Tomoari continues to perform and speak out against the Ashikaga clan, and so the clan's men behead him nonetheless.\nInu-Oh goes on to more years of fame as a Noh dancer, but he is forgotten after his death. The narrator turns out to be Tomoari's spirit, who has remained on Earth up to modern times, and now uses his original name \"Tomona\". Inu-Oh's spirit appears, explaining that it took 600 years to find Tomona since he changed his name. Inu-Oh restores Tomona to his youthful form, and reverts to his deformed version.

John offers \u00a3200,000 per week to Suruli if he works for Peter against a rival don Sivadoss, who is Peter's arch-nemesis and has considerable influence among London's Tamil-speaking population. Suruli accepts the offer with the intention to use the money to eventually settle down and give up his criminal activities, and leaves for London where he learns more about Sivadoss and his gang as well as their activities which involve smuggling weapons from conflict-ridden countries in exchange for money.\nPeter's gang, led by Suruli and John, raid Sivadoss's boat yard where the smuggling is in process under Sivadoss's right-hand man Rajan. During the raid, Suruli kills Rajan as well. Sivadoss and his gang realise that Suruli is responsible for killing Rajan and kidnap him. Suruli and Sivadoss negotiate to kill Peter under the ruse of inviting him for a \"peace talk\" to end their feud, in exchange for \u00a3600,000 as well as a parotta restaurant in London, but during the \"peace talk\", Suruli betrays Sivadoss and hands over an aruval to Peter, who uses it to hack Sivadoss to death.

Attila further reveals that Sivadoss was involved in smuggling with the intention to use the money to help the illegal immigrants and refugees from all countries financially and legally, and was planning to fight for her brother's release as well. Sivadoss, on hearing about Suruli's love for Attila, decided to offer him protection and get him married to Attila. But due to Sivadoss's death, the money to fight for the immigrants' rights had dried up, and Attila's brother has no chance of being released from prison as a result.

The next day, a case of burglary is reported when the wife of the man reports missing jewellery pieces from her closet and raises doubt on Rajakannu. The police invade Rajakannu's home to find evidence. Rajakannu had left the town earlier for work. During the invasion, the police brutally beat and unlawfully detain the pregnant Sengeni. The police arrest other relatives: Rajakannu's brother Iruttupan, his sister Pachaiammal and his brother-in-law Mosakutty, and torture them to confess Rajakannu's whereabouts. The police find Rajakannu and imprison him. They torture him to confess the crime but release Sengeni. Later, she is informed that all three men in detention are absconding and police threaten her furthermore to tell them about their whereabouts.\nMythra, who teaches adults from the Irula tribe, learns about Chandru, a lawyer who fights cases for tribal communities, and manages to convince him to seek justice for Sengeni. After listening to the narration of all events that happened until then from Sengeni, Chandru files a habeas corpus case in the court. Initially the court advises them to file the petition in a lower court, but Chandru asks for witness examination, which is not the procedure in a habeas corpus case. But Chandru cites the Rajan case, and the court yields. The Solicitor general appearing for the police, based on the police officers' evidence, argues that Rajakannu and the other two had absconded from the police custody the night they were arrested. Finding gaps in the witnesses' statements, Chandru discovers that they were committing perjury and asks the court to investigate Sub-Inspector Gurumurthy (a casteist), head constable Veerasamy, and constable Kirubakaran.\nAdvocate General Ram Mohan takes over the case, and in defense of the police, claims that the three accused have fled to Kerala. Varadarajulu, the employer of Iruttapan, acknowledges that Iruttapan informed him through a phone call that he had fled to Kerala after committing robbery. Chandru discovered that the three policemen in question went to Kerala to make a phone call to Varadarajulu which Guru admits, that he mimicked the voice of Iruttapan. The court appoints IG Perumalsamy as the lead officer of this case, upon Chandru's request. After continuing search for weeks, Chandru, Perumalsamy and Mythra find that Rajakannu's corpse was found in the middle of a road near meters into border of Pondicherry, the day after he supposedly fled. He was cremated after being photographed as an unknown man. Both believe that Rajakannu did not die due to a car accident, rather due to lock-up murder.\nChandru consults the pathologist who conducted the post-mortem examination on Rajakannu. The pathologist says the cause of death was due to the breaking of the ribcage, which in turn, led a fragment of bone being driven into Rajakannu's heart, but theorises that this could be caused by a car running over him. Veerasamy confesses to Ram Mohan that Rajakannu died in custody. Veerasamy called Guru after the death. Guru told Veerasamy that he should stage that both have escaped and leave Rajakannu on the road, framing his death as occurring due to a car accident. Mosakutty and Iruttapan were transferred to another jail in Kerala. After hearing this, Ram Mohan advises them to maintain their narrative in court. Chandru checks the call history of the police station and informs the court that a call to Guru's residence was made at 9:10 pm, which does not corroborate with Veerasamy's evidence. Chandru asks the court for more time to investigate.\nChandru, Mythra, Sengeni, and the Irular tribe campaign against the injustice that had happened. Chandru finds that Irutappan indeed called Varadarajulu, but the police coerced him to make that call. Mythra finds Iruttapan and Mosakutty, and they testify in court about the torture all three of them went through and how the policemen killed Rajakannu. Perumalsamy says the policemen took bribes from the actual thief. Chandru also says that on the road where Rajakannu's corpse was found, there were a set of tire marks. There were also footprints that matched Guru's and Kiruba's footprints. After hearing these evidence, the court announces the verdict: the policemen who killed Rajakannu will be arrested; Sengeni will get \u20b93 lakh (equivalent to \u20b918 lakh or US$23,000 in 2020) and half a ground land as compensation; and Iruttapan, Mosakutty and Pachaiamma will get \u20b92 lakh (equivalent to \u20b912 lakh or US$15,000 in 2020) each.

Jomon notices the sign of fire the next morning. Joji manages to escape and lies to Jomon that he doesn't visit the pond at all. Jomon is upset over rumours that Kuttappan's death and is suspicious that someone in the family is behind it. Jomon wants to confront Thotta Sudhi who was loud about Joji's apathetic walking towards the house as Bincy was crying out when Kuttappan died. Joji joins Jomon in searching for Sudhi in the plantations. They find Sudhi working alone on the plantation making thotta (a crude explosive used in breaking stones). When confronted, he runs away after a heated exchange with the brothers but not before spilling some beans which makes Jomon suspect Joji. Realizing Joji is hiding something, Jomon attacks him, and Joji subdues him using Popy's air gun, after which he throws Sudhi's explosives at him, killing Jomon instantly. Joji provides a statement to the police, thus framing Sudhi for Jomon's death.\nOver the next few days, Jaison notices weird changes in Joji's behaviour, including him becoming overtly religious, as Bincy begins to question the possibility of Joji's involvement in Jomon's murder as well. During the autopsy, the police find the pellets from the gun in Jomon's body, and Popy realizes that Joji was the only other person who knew of the gun, which was purchased with money stolen from Kuttappan. The family confronts Joji, who continues to deny these claims. Realizing that he will not get away, Joji tries to blackmail Jaison that unless he stands with Joji, he will be implicated as a co-conspirator in the murders. Realising the true colours of Joji, Jaison refuses this categorically. Bincy confesses to Jaison of knowing about some of Joji's acts.

Forensic reports show that there are signs of struggle on the bodies, so it most likely was a murder.

On the same day, Suresh was found with a bloodstained shirt, so Shakthi realized that Suresh killed Sampath. The arrival of Ranjan (Nassar), a retired cop, who investigated the case decades ago, and actress Ramya (Suman Ranganathan) into the plot, makes things complex for Shakti. Kumar tells Shakthi that Ramya is related to the case, so Shakthi goes to ask her questions. But, it proves unsuccessful. Ranjan decides to help Shakthi by giving him information from what he investigated. He reveals that Suresh actually didn't kill Sampath and that the blood on Suresh's shirt was from a wounded person whom Suresh had saved. Who killed Sampath, and how the family died still remains a mystery. Ramya was also killed later.

He gets scared and tells his goons to abduct him. Ranjan tells Shakthi everything, and then he is taken. Minjur explains to Ranjan that he found out that Suresh was holding a treasure worth 80 lakhs in his department, so he kills Sampath. And, just to make sure he gets away with the money, he plans to kill Suresh too. He tells Rayadu about his plan, but he doesn't tell him about Sampath. He tells Rayadu to put sleeping pills in the family's food, so they can make a run. But, what Rayadu doesn't know is that the pills are poisoned.

He suspects three people: Michael, who Surya had fought with when he attacked Sashida and her friend who had just broken up with him; Nikhil, Sashida's brother who held a grudge against Surya after they had fought over his love, and Aditya, who had known Sashida and fell in love with her before the marriage and was enraged when he learned about Surya. Rama Krishna continues, but nearly loses his life after an attack by an unknown assailant.

After Michael was killed, Victor Raju led him to lie that Surya killed Michael. After pondering this, Rama Krishna has a realization. One day, he invites Nikhil's wife for questioning and unveils her past. As a child, she had committed several violent acts and showed a bloodthirsty shade. Enraged by Surya's treatment of her husband, she paid Michael to attack him, but he blackmailed her, so she killed him. Raju's investigation did lead him to her, but he covered up the murder in exchange for trying to get sexual favors form her, so she killed him as well.

Willow is horrified to learn that Thorn was a wholesome conformist who was class president, prom king, and voted Most Likely to Succeed. Willow confronts Thorn for the truth about his past. Thorn admits that his estranged mother Ruth forced him into a mainstream lifestyle while his grandmother was the only person who truly understood his desire to be different.

Feeling betrayed, the coven votes to banish Thorn, so he goes on a walkabout at a Los Angeles park to reconsider his identity while Willow tries convincing the coven to forgive him.\nWhile high on ayahuasca in the park, Thorn gets life advice from a seemingly sentient pinecone and a rock.

Upon knowing that Das is retiring, the officer glances through the former's cupboard to find one of his case diaries (titled \"Kurup\"). Krishnadas is mostly known as the officer who investigated the famous Charlie murder case long back when he was a DYSP, which paved way for a still-untraced fugitive named Sudhakara Kurup. As the officer reads through the diary, the story of Kurup unfolds on screen.\nBorn as Gopikrishna Kurup, Kurup is sent to the Indian Air Force forcibly by his uncle after he fails to acquire his degree. At the IAF, he meets and befriends Peter who was also forcibly made to join the IAF despite his passion for music. Weeks later, Peter and Kurup along with some other inmates are sent to Bombay by the Air Force. There, Peter starts liking his new life while Kurup meets and befriends Sharadamma, who is the daughter of his family's old maid and falls in love with her. Later, Peter is informed that Kurup, who was hospitalized days ago, has committed suicide. He informs the same to Sharada. However, Sharada gets the message that Kurup is still alive and meets him in a subway, wherein Kurup announces the new name he currently lives under, Sudhakara Kurup. Kurup apparently created his death to escape the tedious life in the force. He soon marries Sharada and they leave for Persia, starting a new life there. However, further problems lead Kurup to hasty decisions and he leaves to his hometown along with his office clerk and right-hand man Sabu (Shivajith).\nIn Kerala, Pillechan Bhasippilla  who is Kurup's co-brother (Sharada's brother-in-law) and Ponnachan who is Kurup's personal driver in Allepey, welcome Kurup and Sabu. Kurup discusses a plan he made with the three other men - that he has applied for life insurance under his own name and an amount of Rs 8 Lakh can be obtained if Kurup's death was proved. Kurup decides to fake his own death and offers the three men an equal share of the insurance money. For this, they require a corpse that matches Kurup's physique. After searching a lot for corpses matching Kurup's height and weight, Pillechan puts forward the idea of killing someone who matches their requirements after spotting a bartender who resembles Kurup in height and style. However, Pillechan's attempt to abduct the bartender backfires and the men end up quarrelling with Kurup.\nThe next day, an Ambassador car is found apparently involved in an accident and burnt badly next to a paddy field. A charred and killed person is found in the driver's seat. The police team headed by DYSP Krishnadas arrives and starts investigating. The car is identified to be that of Kurup. However, Das spots match, gloves and footsteps at the site, thereby confirming that it wasn't an accident but a murder. Das questions Pillechan which makes him suspicious of the latter. Das finds out burnt marks in Pillechan's body and takes him into custody. In custody, Pillechan admits that he had murdered Kurup due to a long-standing rivalry.\nHowever, the experienced Das easily finds that Pillai is lying. He asks his colleagues to cross-check recent man-missing cases that lead him to the house of Charlie, a film distribution company staff. Charlie's wife identifies cloth remnants from the charred body which belong to Charlie, making it clear that Charlie was the one murdered and burnt (and not Kurup). Pillai is tortured in custody till he confesses that the four of them found the perfect victim in Charlie and subsequently murdered and burnt him along with Kurup's car, to fabricate Kurup's death.\nSabu and Ponnachan are also arrested. The missing Kurup is hiding at a lodge and a room boy informs the police about the same. However, the police is unable to trace him. Despite getting to know Kurup's exact route - Allepey to Ernakulam, then to his uncle at Mannar, further to his relative at Bhopal and finally to Sharada's aunt at Bombay - Das and his team miss Kurup each time. However, Das is ultimately able to find Isaac, Kurup's long-time friend with whom he was spotted by a peon, who informs the police. Isaac refuses to reveal Kurup's plan, but Das is able to connect the dots and finds that Kurup is planning to migrate via a cruise ship. However, Kurup slips away even this time and escapes on the cruise.\nDas's case diary then tries to give more clarity to the incidents. It is revealed that while in Bombay, Kurup was driven by greed - which stirred his mind right during his IAF days - that led him into the smuggling of the force's arms which were pending post the war. He forms a smuggling setup with Isaac, then his close friend and Leo, a gangster. After creating many alterations, Kurup gets the need to evade capture and decides to fake his death for the first time. Kurup (then Gopikrishna) fakes his death and changes to Sudhakara Kurup with his family knowing about it. The propaganda is swiftly spread by Kurup's friend who is a cop.\nNext, after marrying Sharada, both leaves for Persia where they lead a luxurious life. Kurup meets with Leo who leads him to Prince Walid, son of the emperor. Walid is impressed by Kurup. Kurup is assigned by Walid to smuggle precious crude oil without the knowledge of the former's father. However, Kurup's greed resurfaces and combined with Walid's ill-treatment, he decides to rob a high amount from Walid and then fakes his own death once again to evade Walid. The insurance was arranged only as a part of this big plan and Kurup with the help of his team in Kerala kills Charlie to fake Kurup's death. However, this time his plans go awry, thanks to an efficient Das.\nIt is then revealed that Kurup was hiding right above the room when Das and his team arrived to arrest him at the lodge. He further hides at his aforementioned places in Bhopal and Bombay before planning to escape on the cruise (with the help of Leo). He even joins the police team disguised as a driver shortly before evading Das's eye and getting into the cruise, but Das is informed by Walid about Kurup's treachery beforehand. Das and Walid join hands against their common enemy. As the cruise leaves and Das find that Kurup is in it, the former immediately informs Walid about the same. Meanwhile, Kurup meets Leo and is assigned a new name 'Alexander' and a new passport. Once Kurup (now Alexander) walks out, he is called \"Alexander\" by Walid, who along with his bodyguards plans to kill Kurup. Das, confirming that Kurup will be killed, informs Charlie's family that he has avenged the person who is responsible for their condition. A few years later, Das gets conferred as an IPS officer and is given the rank of Superintendent of Police.\nAt the end of the ceremony, Das leaves the office, before which the officer who was reading his diary hands it to Das and salutes him respectfully. Das, leaving his official life behind and believing that Kurup is no more, leaves the office and the moment he leaves, a cop receives fax showing a lookout notice of an international criminal who is shown to be none other than Kurup. In the epilogue, it is shown that when Alexander was stopped by Walid, he just smiles to the camera and a newspaper story showing Walid's death in a car accident follows, indirectly suggesting that Alexander had set a plan B with Leo's help to end Walid in case he spotted him in the cruise. Various news stories and channel clips of the police searching all around the world for Alexander follow. Back to the present, in a busy street in Helsinki in 2005, Alexander is spotted and photographed by a person who works for the police. Upon realizing that he is being photographed, Alexander kills the photographer.", "tmdb_id": 785585}, "67124496": {"title": "Kuruthi", "plot": "Ibrahim is a rubber tapping labourer who lives in the lonely mountain ranges and is trying to leave behind memories of a traumatic monsoon landslide in which he lost his daughter and wife. He lives with his father Moosa, and younger brother Rasool. Ibrahim is unaware of Rasool's involvement in terrorism, guided by the supposedly friendly Kareem. A woman named Sumathi also visits them often. Sumathi has a brother Preman who makes a living by climbing trees. One night, an injured cop barges into Ibrahim's house with a prisoner and seeks refuge for the night. He reveals himself as Sathyan, an SI. With him is Vishnu, a murderer who stabbed a Muslim shopkeeper to death after the latter refused to close on the former's order. Vishnu is now being chased by communal factions, to be killed before he reaches stations. They have attacked the convoy and the police will not be able to reach them until next morning. Rasool is visibly enraged at his presence. \nMeanwhile, Sathyan informs the others in the house about the situation and closes every window in the house. He also confiscates everyone's mobile phone and every weapon in the house and finds an old non-functional gun belonging to Moosa Khader, who used it in his time as a personal driver for the Mysore Maharaj. Suma arrives with food and is also told to stay in Ibrahim's home, for the night. While eating, Vishnu and Rasool argue about the morality behind the murder, prompting Sathyan to stop them. After eating, they sleep for some time before Kareem arrives. He engages in conversation with Ibrahim, while Sathyan, Vishnu and Suma hide in the rooms. Ibrahim spots a bike key with Kareem and asks whose it is. Kareem names him as Laiq, who comes inside and greets everyone. Laiq tells them that he's from Bangalore and needs to stay there. Laiq asks for food as he's hungry and spots Suma, who lies that she's staying there because of the pipeline problem in her house. Laiq sees through the story and openly asks about the boy. Sathyan, tired of hiding and armed with a pistol, confronts Laiq. Laiq's henchman Umar, arrives and Ibrahim starts to get confused and scared. \nLaiq prepares a handknife from his keychain while Sathyan prepares a gun, both sitting on the opposite ends of a table. Laiq flips the table and stabs Sathyan in the neck, while Umar pushes Ibrahim down. Laiq breaks into the room in which Vishnu and Suma are hiding. Suma holds Laiq at gunpoint with Moosa's gun and accidentally tries to fire it, revealing it's broken nature. Ibrahim quickly grabs Sathyan's gun and drives Laiq, Kareem and Umar out of the house. Sathyan, in his final moments, convinces Ibrahim to promise on the Quran to keep Vishnu safe until the cops from Kenachal arrive the next morning. Ibrahim uncuffs Vishnu as Laiq attacks the window he was cuffed to with an axe. Ibrahim shoots at the window, scaring Laiq away. Umar cuts the power to the house and Suma lights a matchstick and everyone spot Vishnu and Rasool, the latter with a screwdriver. Suma states that the reason behind Vishnu's murder that the temple that Vishnu grew up in was destroyed, prompting him to take revenge. When Ibrahim asks Suma how she knows this, she reveals that she gave him food on a regular basis because he had nowhere to go. Umar climbs the roof of the house and tries to make his way in, but is knocked down on the other side of the roof by Ibrahim armed with a makeshift explosive. \nLaiq jumps on the roof and fights with Ibrahim, ending with Ibrahim pushing Laiq off the roof but not before Laiq cuts his hand, severely injuring him. Preman returns and is immediately suspicious of Kareem and Laiq. He distracts them and climbs a tree, before knocking down a wasp nest that drives them both away. Meanwhile, a severely disfigured Umar wakes up, and goes to retrieve a jeep. Preman enters Ibrahim's house and is confounded. Ibrahim spots blood in Preman's leg and is shocked to discover that he was bitten by a snake. When looking for a means of transport to get Preman to a hospital, Vishnu offers the bike key of Laiq, who dropped it in an earlier fight. When they prepare to leave, Kareem shows up and starts hitting Preman. He is then fatally shot by Suma, who leaves the house with Preman and Vishnu, with Vishnu driving. Laiq unsuccessfully chases them. Laiq arrives at the house and starts attacking Ibrahim, before being told by Kareem that it was Suma who shot him. Laiq agrees to Moosa offering them to drive into the forest using a shortcut to reach before the trio and intercept them. Umar arrives with the jeep and all of them leave. The forests are scaled by the trio (Vishnu, Suma and Preman) and Laiq's henchmen, with both facing several obstacles. \nMoosa arrives and Laiq and Rasool go out to search for the trio. While looking, Laiq tells his story to Rasool about how his father was a simple, devoted man, who sent Laiq abroad when their organisation was banned. Abroad, Laiq is marginalised and discriminated but remains quiet. When he returns home, he finds his father killed and no one but himself to blame for not acting quicker. Just as Laiq finishes, Rasool notices the bike and alerts Laiq while Ibrahim and Moosa watch from far. Vishnu, having noticed Laiq, pushes Suma and Preman and decides to fight Laiq alone. Laiq jumps at Vishnu, but the latter is able to escape. Laiq orders Moosa to chase them. At a turning, Vishnu falls from the bike. Laiq orders to run him over, but Moosa turns away and alerts Ibrahim to 'drop the genie', a method used by Moosa in his old times to escape officers while stealing sandalwood, a sign to 'drop' the package, to be retrieved later. Ibrahim pushes away Rasool and Laiq jumps with Ibrahim. Moosa crashes the jeep and Kareem and Umar are killed. Vishnu is caught by Ibrahim, who uses him as ransom to rescue Suma, who is caught and held by Laiq at knifepoint. Ibrahim lets Vishnu run and Laiq follows. He is finally able to catch up with him and engages in a fight, breaking Vishnu's leg and hand.\nJust as Laiq is about to execute Vishnu, he is stabbed by a remorseful Ibrahim. Laiq stumbles and is stabbed again fatally by Ibrahim. Ibrahim begins to pray for forgiveness and leaves with Vishnu. Rasool arrives and is handed the knife by Laiq (the passing of the hate as told by Moosa earlier) before he dies. Near a rock, Suma ponders the question if everything will be normal again. Moosa replies that even though here, in this secluded hill, they are safe, outside, across the bridge, they are not. Ibrahim lets Vishnu go, leaving him to decide his own fate.

Jacques later tells Jean that Pierre has tasked him with collecting war levies, agreeing to ask for leniency on Jean's behalf when his brother-in-arms explains he lacks the funds.\nTo restore his finances, Jean marries Marguerite de Thibouville on the promise of a large dowry from Marguerite's father, Robert, that grants the rights to many valuable estates. Pierre, however, seizes the prized estate of Aunou-le-Faucon to settle Robert's back taxes and gifts it to Jacques, who has earned a court position by using his accounting knowledge to organize Pierre's finances. Jean takes the matter before King Charles, who dismisses the suit. Pierre retaliates by appointing Jacques to the captaincy of a Carrouges family post following the death of Jean's father.\nJean's marriage becomes strained due to the couple's failure to conceive. He and Jacques reconcile at a celebration, where Jacques becomes smitten with Marguerite after she befriends him in an attempt to win favor.

One day, Jean's mother takes all the servants to attend to legal business, leaving Marguerite alone. Jacques later visits and tricks his way into the chateau, haughtily proclaiming his love.

Jean insists that Marguerite immediately have sex with him so that Jacques will not be \"the last man that knew her.\"\nPierre informs Jacques that Jean is accusing him of raping Marguerite, which he denies. Despite the count's attempt to exert his authority, Jean appeals his case directly to King Charles and requests a duel to the death. Jacques accepts, having decided not to seek a favorable forum of a Catholic ecclesiastical court with clerical judges. Marguerite's friends abandon her, believing her to be lying to cover up an affair, while Jean's mother insists Marguerite drop her accusations and accept any consequences.\nAt Jacques' trial six months later, a now-pregnant Marguerite remains resolute that she is telling the truth, while the court implies that Jacques is the father of her child. Charles grants Jean's request for a duel to the death to determine the case. Marguerite is also informed that she will be burned alive for perjury if her husband loses. Marguerite confronts Jean for not telling her she would be burned alive if he fails.

Foreign correspondent Anthony O'Hare arrives to interview Laurence about his business success. At the party, Laurence is condescending to both Jennifer and Anthony. Afterwards, a drunk Anthony complains about the awful company to a fellow guest and is caught by Jennifer. Anthony returns the next morning with a written apology, which Jennifer forces him to read aloud. Anthony invites the Stirlings out to eat the next day, but Laurence is called away on a sudden business trip, leaving Jennifer and Anthony to spend the summer together until his return.

In turn, Laurence threatens to ruin Jennifer's reputation and gain sole custody of their daughter, as she would only be seen as an adulteress by the court of law. This prompts Jennifer to escape with their daughter to go with Anthony.

Gary stops to smash Peters's car, but then they run out of gas as well.

Gary briefly joins her but overhears that pinball will soon be legalized in the Valley and decides to open an arcade, leading to an argument with Alana. They lash out at each other about their difference in age and their fraught relationship. Alana tries to make peace, but Gary drives off.\nLater, Gary prepares for the opening night of his arcade, remodeling his storefront into \"Fat Bernie's Pinball Palace\". That same night, Alana nearly shares a kiss with Brian but is invited to join Wachs at a restaurant. She arrives to meet Wachs and his partner Matthew, posing as Matthew's girlfriend to save Wachs from political embarrassment. Alana walks a deeply hurt Matthew home and they commiserate over the men in their lives. She goes to the arcade to find Gary, who has left to look for her at Wachs's office, with her sisters' encouragement. Alana and Gary eventually run into each other's arms and return to the arcade, where Gary pronounces she will be his wife.

Deacon, a former L.A. Sheriff's detective, accompanies recently appointed lead detective Jimmy Baxter to the scene of a new murder in L.A. Deacon notices similarities between the M.O. of the killing and the M.O. of an old serial murder case he was unable to solve.\nThat night, a woman named Ronda Rathbun is followed by a car while jogging and is reported missing the following morning. Baxter learns from the precinct's captain Farris that Deacon got divorced and suffered a heart attack due to his obsession with the unsolved case. Baxter is advised not to involve Deacon any further but Deacon takes vacation leave to assist in solving Baxter's case.\nThe next night, the police discover the body of another victim washed up beneath a bridge. Baxter learns the M.O. is consistent with that of the earlier murder and others: the victims were all sex workers who were stabbed to death. Deacon begins investigating Albert Sparma, a suspect working at a repair store in proximity to the murders. Deacon tails Sparma but is thwarted, so he takes Sparma in for questioning. While under interrogation, Sparma taunts the detectives and is released after provoking Deacon into an angry outburst. The young woman pursued in the desert is interviewed but has seen Sparma in handcuffs at the police station which compromises her eligibility as an objective witness to identify him as a suspect.\nThe FBI will take charge of the investigation within the week, giving Deacon and Baxter less time to resolve it. Farris informs Baxter that eight years prior, Sparma confessed to a murder which he couldn't possibly have committed and is thus an unlikely suspect. Sparma's fingerprint is similar to the killer's but not a definitive match. Baxter and Deacon go to Sparma's apartment and conduct an illegal search but find nothing incriminating. As Deacon searches the apartment, his portable police scanner goes off and he narrowly escapes from Sparma's home after Sparma calls in an \"officer down\" report at that address.

Sparma begins to taunt him until Baxter snaps and strikes him in the face with the shovel, killing him.

They are led to a castle ran by groundskeeper Angus and the disgruntled property caretaker Morag.\nAngus then shows the family a painting of their ancestors that bears a striking resemblance to themselves and reveals they ruled the town for many years before sailing away forever. Lincoln eventually learns from Angus that his own ancestral counterpart, the Duke of the family, was the most special member of the family, much to his delight. Wanting to become the new Duke of Loch Loud, he partakes in many community service events to help restore the village to its former glory and eventually guilt trips the rest of the family into moving to Scotland forever since the family no longer has to share one bathroom. A bad service call from Lori causes Bobby to think they are breaking up.\nAs the Louds adjust to their discovery while experiencing the ghost of their descendant Lucille Loud, a baby dragon who grows very fast whenever she eats that they name Lela, and enjoying their time in the castle, Morag becomes frustrated with the family after living in the castle peacefully and quietly for many years. She then devises a plan like her ancestor Aggie to get the family to leave Loch Loud forever by hypnotizing Lela with a magic gemstone known as the Dragon Stone and the royal scepter.\nAfter the sisters begin to get attention in the village, Morag tricks Lincoln into riding Lela to try to get back his attention. While he rides the dragon, she uses the gemstone and scepter to hypnotize it into destroying the town so Lincoln could get blamed for the chaos. Feeling guilty for the damage, Lincoln asks the family to return home to Royal Woods. As the family leaves for home, Morag proceeds to make herself the new duchess of the town much to the displeasure of villagers. In retaliation, she hypnotizes Lela again to cause more destruction to the village.\nLucille tells the family of Morag's plan and what she's doing to the town. The Loud children head back to the town on a rowboat and team up to defeat Morag and un-hypnotize Lela. The sisters eventually get the scepter back and Lincoln, using his magic skills and with help from Lily, destroys the Dragon Stone, which breaks Lela out of her spell and in response, Morag is dropped on an island filled with noisy seals. The citizens of Loch Loud congratulate the family and ask Lincoln to resume his place as the duke of the kingdom, though Lincoln declines and instead offers the crown to Angus instead, feeling he deserves it more, a decision approved by the citizens and the other ghosts of the Loud ancestors. \nAfter helping repair the village, the Loud family says goodbye to Angus and the villagers and sets sail back home to Royal Woods. Bobby arrives to reunite with Lori only to find that she left. Clyde welcomes Lincoln back to Royal Woods with some duke-themed cream puffs.\nDuring the credits, still images are shown that include but are not limited to the Duke's ghost riding Lela, Bobby reuniting with Lori, Leni contacting Scott online, Lincoln winning a 3rd place trophy at a magic show, Lela having laid three eggs, and Angus and the ghosts rescuing Morag who now works as the groundskeeper with Lela keeping her in line.", "tmdb_id": 410113}, "66751899": {"title": "Love (2021 film)", "plot": "The Love Hotel is the most beautiful place to spend Valentine's Day.

This is in order to colonize the region by overthrowing the powerful kingdom of Kozhikode, a long time war rival of Kochi. Portuguese military commander Alfonso de Noronho trains Kochi soldiers to use firearms and offers them cannons in exchange for trading crops and spices. However, the Malabar natives are displeased with the new Cartaz license system they've established which impedes trade with the Arabs. Kuttiyali Marakkar, an influential merchant, finds a way to trade while bypassing Portuguese customs laws, but he's sold out by his brother-in-law Moidu who is allied with Alfonso.\nIn the past, Kuttiyali and his sons, Kutti Poker Ali and Pattu Marakkar, were commanders of the Kozhikode navy and helped resist Portuguese rule, but they resigned and became merchants after Poker died in battle. In the present, Poker's son Muhammad Ali is newly married to Aisha, his childhood sweetheart. However she, Muhammad's mother, and Kuttiyali are all killed that night by Alfonso in a raid. Kochi's king frames it as a civil massacre and blames Muhammad and Pattu, who had survived and escaped. In retaliation, the two assassinate Moidu and manage to flee by raft, but a storm causes them to land in Ponnani, Kozhikode. There they start a new life and meet the kingdom's military commanders, the arrogant and spoiled Achuthan, and the compassionate Anandan. Muhammad speaks against Achuthan for disrespecting him, but Anandan stops them from fighting. The king's associate and right-hand warrior Mangattachan distributes supplies to the storm's victims, but the corrupt n\u0101duv\u0101zhi Namathu Kurup hoards them to sell in market, and his men assault Pattu for calling him out. In retaliation, Muhammad recruits a bandit named Thangudu and his crew to rob Kurup's goods and distribute them to civilians. They perform many raids against corrupt noblemen and Muhammad takes up the mantle of Kunjali Marakkar, a protector of the people but fugitive to the kingdom.\nMany years later, Marakkar's gang engage in guerilla warfare against Portuguese vessels, and on one raid they meet Chiang, a Chinese slave. Chiang fights them in defense so gang member Aimutty takes Chiang's mother hostage. Marakkar is against hurting women and children so he saves her but accidentally kills Aimutty. Aimutty's brother Mayinkutty witnesses this. Chiang and his mother are rescued, leading to the former and Marakkar becoming friends, and he calls Chiang \"Chinnali\". Since Marakkar is a fugitive of Kozhikode, Achuthan instructs Mayinkutty to kill him for revenge, but Chinnali kills him first.\nViceroy Francisco de Gama threatens war against Kozhikode when their monarch, the Samoothiri, declines a trading deal proposed by their king. Since Achuthan, their naval commander, states that defeating them is impossible, Anandan proposes a controversial decision to recruit Marakkar, who is brought to the kingdom and recognized as Poker's son. The Samoothiri's judgement of Achuthan using Mayinkutty being dishonorable causes him to replace Achuthan with Marakkar as naval commander, leading Achuthan to jealousy. Marakkar leads the troops to battle and they use traps to sink many Portuguese ships, eventually finding Alfonso and killing him. Marakkar is praised by the court, except by the diplomats of Kolathunadu who ally with the Portuguese. The Samoothiri thanks Marakkar by renovating his family's fortress, and it grows into a village. In the meantime, Chinnali falls in love with Aarcha, the daughter of minister Dharmoth Panicker. She reciprocates, but Achuthan also has feelings for her. Their parents decide to get Aarcha married to Achuthan. Unbeknownst to them, Aarcha, who is now pregnant with Chinnali's child, runs away with him. Achuthan, out of jealousy, frames Chinnali for abducting her, causing tension. Achuthan attempts to force Aarcha to return to the kingdom, causing a fight between him, Chinnali, and Anandan. Anandan pleads to Chinnali to calm down, but Achuthan kills Chinnali and runs.

However, she does not exercise power in her own right but on behalf of her adopted son Erik, whom she has had crowned king in each of the three kingdoms, and even though he is now of age she continues to rule in his name, aided by her friend and advisor Peder Jensen Lodehat, the Bishop of Roskilde.\nIn 1402, Margrete summons the leading magnates of the three kingdoms to Kalmar Castle to witness Erik's betrothal to Philippa of England, the daughter of King Henry IV of England. Philippa is accompanied by an English lord, William Bourcier, who has been tasked with negotiating the financial and political terms of the marriage agreement. Margrete is especially keen to establish a strong military alliance with England in order to deter attacks by the Union's German enemies, in particular the Teutonic Order, which rules Prussia and has also recently seized the Swedish island of Gotland.\nDuring the feast to welcome the English party to Kalmar, the Norwegian magnate Asle Jonsson tells Margrete that en route to Kalmar he met a man who had come from Graudenz (in Prussia) and claims to be Oluf, Margrete's son. Oluf had as a child been king of both Denmark and Norway, but had died suddenly at Falsterbo fifteen years previously (i.e. in 1387). At the time he had been seventeen years old, just about to come of age and take over rule of the two kingdoms from his mother, and ever since the queen's enemies have spread dark rumours that she had him murdered in order to retain power herself. Margrete assures Asle that her son is dead, but he insists that he recognises the man as Oluf. This incendiary news quickly spreads, and so Margrete orders Asle to bring the man to Kalmar so that the matter can be put to rest. Meanwhile, Margrete grows suspicious of Raberlin, a German merchant present at the feast, and orders her Swedish retainer Jakob Nilsson to follow him when he returns to Prussia.\nThe Man from Graudenz is brought to Kalmar and publicly interrogated by Margrete. He repeats his claim that he is King Oluf, and explains that in 1387 one of his retainers was ordered to kill him by persons unknown. The assassin could not bring himself to go through with the deed, and so instead kidnapped him and took him to Prussia, where he has been held captive by the Teutonic Order for the last fifteen years. A few weeks ago, he was suddenly released without explanation, and he has subsequently made his way back to Scandinavia to reclaim his rightful inheritance. The Danish & Swedish councillors are sceptical of this story, but their Norwegian counterparts are more willing to believe it (as Oluf's father was the previous Norwegian king, H\u00e5kon VI), and several of them, like Asle, claim to recognise the Man from Graudenz as Oluf. Margrete orders him to be confined to the dungeons while she decides what to do with him.\nOver the following days, Margrete finds herself faced with a horrible dilemma. Erik - who would lose his legitimacy if the prisoner is recognised as Oluf - becomes increasingly agitated and unstable, while Bishop Peder urges her to have the Man from Graudenz executed immediately in order to prevent discord between the three realms, and Bourcier threatens to break off negotiations and return to England with Philippa unless the question of Erik's status is resolved quickly. On the other hand, Asle Jonsson and the Norwegian councillors are adamant that the Man from Graudenz is Oluf, and the more Margrete speaks to him, the more she starts to wonder if he really is her son. A further element of doubt is introduced when she discovers that none of her councillors saw Oluf's corpse after his supposed death, as they were all too afraid of infection from the plague to open his coffin.\nIn an effort to make the decision easier for herself, Margrete proposes that if the Man from Graudenz publicly denies that he is Oluf, then she will spare his life. However, he stubbornly refuses to do so, and moreover Bishop Peder points out that even if the pretender were to renounce his claims, he will still be a threat to Erik, and to Scandinavian unity, as long as he remains alive.\nMargrete eventually has a flash of inspiration and realises that the Man from Graudenz's story about an attempt on his life might be the root of the rumours that she had her son killed. She never gave any such order, and there is only one other person who would have had the authority to do so in her stead. She confronts Peder, who admits that he ordered Oluf's retainer to murder him and explains that he acted for the greater good, as Oluf would never have been an acceptable ruler for the Swedes in the way Margrete has been. It was therefore necessary to get rid of Oluf so that Margrete could retain power in Denmark-Norway and then take control of Sweden as well, thereby completing the Kalmar Union and finally bringing peace to Scandinavia.\nMargrete is now convinced that the Man from Graudenz is indeed her son Oluf, but before she can act on this, Erik produces a witness to falsely confess to teaching the Man from Graudenz how to impersonate Oluf. Having thus 'proved' that Oluf is an impostor, Erik sentences him to death for treason. Margrete and the Norwegian magnates protest, but the Danish and Swedish magnates back Erik, as do the bishops, led by Peder.\nThat evening Margrete has Asle spring Oluf from his prison cell, intending that the three of them will escape together to Bergen, though she realises that this will probably lead to war between Norway and Denmark-Sweden. However, just as Margrete is about to slip out of the castle to rendezvous with Oluf and Asle, Jakob Nilsson arrives to see her, newly returned from his escapade in Prussia. He has learnt that the Teutonic Order is planning an invasion of mainland Sweden, and that the Order deliberately timed the release of Oluf in order to cause maximum discord amongst the Scandinavian kingdoms (and to wreck the mooted alliance with England), and thereby leave the Kalmar Union vulnerable. Realising that Scandinavian unity is more important in the face of the Teutonic threat than her personal feelings, Margrete betrays Oluf, who is quickly recaptured by Erik's men. Margrete manages to persuade Erik to spare Asle, but Oluf is publicly burned alive as a traitor in front of his mother. It is implied that, with Scandinavian unity restored, the Teutonic Order calls off its planned invasion.\nThe film ends with a brief text stating that the Kalmar Union lasted for a further century after Margrete's death, and claiming that the close affinity that exists to this day between the three Scandinavian nations is in large part thanks to her.", "tmdb_id": 659370}, "69424655": {"title": "Maria.

Richard and Linda tell that they knew that he became more depressed due to their family moving houses, lack of friends, and bullying at school. The couples briefly debate whether video games had influenced Hayden's violent thoughts. While acknowledging that Hayden's schools and therapists did not respond appropriately to their findings, Richard and Linda express their guilt and regret over how their failure to see and react to any signs that their son could have become violent. Jay and Gail admit that they wanted to see Richard and Linda in as much pain as they and the other victims' parents were. Richard and Linda admit that being the parents of a murderer meant that they did not know how to navigate being public figures, since they also could not speculate about why Hayden did what he did. Richard and Linda reveal that Hayden had made friends in high school, who were also victims of bullying, and that one of his friends had access to guns. Jay and Linda become furious, causing Richard to warn against jumping to conclusions about Hayden, only for Jay to speculate that Hayden was a psychopath who was incapable of being dealt with.\nJay eventually has a short angry outburst, leading to him breaking down as he describes how Evan was killed by Hayden. Both couples reflect on the other victims and their families, and when they visited the crime scene in the aftermath. Linda reveals that she found a notebook in her son's room after learning of the shooting, detailing his plans for the shooting and his suicide in the school library. She and Richard explain that while they understood that the grieving parents would not mourn the loss of Hayden, they still wanted and held a funeral to memorialize and mourn their once-innocent son who they loved before his horrible actions. Linda expresses that she wants to remember the good memories about Hayden before his actions, rather than ignoring and condemning Hayden completely. When Linda asks Gail to tell a story about Evan, Gail recounts a positive memory of Evan when he was 12 and expresses how much she and Jay miss him. Having come to an understanding of all the pain they felt, Gail forgives Richard, Linda, and Hayden, wanting to move on from all the deep pain and grief.\nThe couples hold hands in silence to end their meeting, all having reached a state of empathy for each other. Richard leaves first for a business meeting. Linda follows, only to come back to speak to Gail and Jay once more. Linda recounts the moment she and Richard were the most terrified of Hayden when he angrily threatened to beat her up. She confesses that she wishes she was beaten up by him so she could truly see what he became, leading Gail to comfort her before they finally part ways. Jay becomes emotional when he overhears a choir practice in another room of the church.

After J.D organizes a college election that goes awry, he is assigned to a juvenile detention facility for a 3-month assignment he does not remember volunteering for. J.D reluctantly assumes his new position and is warned by the prison authorities of the rampant drug abuse and violence there, but J.D pays no heed. Sabari and Manikandan are two brothers, who are supposed to surrender for one of Bhavani's murders, slip a note to an unknown J.D, and later that night try to call him while he is drunk. When they are caught, Bhavani kills them and their bodies are discovered hanging from the ceiling of the detention center classroom the next day. \nJ.D is detained for the murders. A grief-stricken Charu admonishes J.D for his negligent behavior, revealing that she was the one who had signed him up for the job, believing him to be the only teacher capable of understanding the needs of the inmates. She reveals herself as an NGO worker investigating the crimes occurring in the facility; the brothers had desperately contacted her for help. While in detention, J.D. discovers the brothers' note, detailing the horrific activities taking place inside the center. Heartbroken, he clobbers Bhavani's goons who had been dispatched to kill him and calls Bhavani, promising to make him pay for the boys' deaths. Having quit drinking, J.D slowly gains control over the institution and begins to reform the inmates. His actions are opposed by Das, an older inmate (found to be an adult) responsible for controlling the younger children.\nWith the assistance of a young inmate, Undiyal, J.D discovers that Bhavani regularly makes the inmates take the blame for his crimes. He records the video of the younger inmates including Undiyal, speaking about Das's crimes in the facility. Bhavani's goons target Charu and retrieve the video from her, sparing her only because of Undiyal's intervention. Undiyal reveals that select inmates are tattooed with the Tamil letter '\u0baa' (Pa), which allows unrestricted access to free food and drugs from Bhavani's associates in exchange for surrendering for his crimes. J.D raids the respective establishments and cuts off the drug supply to the detention facility, much to Bhavani's frustration. He also sneaks into Bhavani's hideout and threatens him and his men with dire consequences, while unknowingly holding Bhavani at knifepoint using a ball pen. Bhavani retaliates by killing some of J.D's batchmates and ex-students. \nWith J.D incapacitated by grief, Das abducts most of the inmates, intending to take them out of Tamil Nadu along with Bhavani's Benami documents. With the help of his friend and expert archer Vanathi, J.D defeat Das's men and rescues the children. J.D confronts Das and makes him realize Bhavani will kill him because he is the link between Bhavani and the crimes in the detention facility. Das reforms and transports J.D to Bhavani's meatpacking plant along with the children. Das overpowers the men sent to kill him while J.D confronts Bhavani. Although Bhavani gets the upper hand, J.D manages to defeat Bhavani, who later urges J.D to join him in politics, but J.D kills him, thus avenging Sabari and Manikandan's death. With the children safe, J.D  and Das surrender to the police. The detention facility is shut down by the government, with the inmates being sent to other detention facilities and state prisons, based on their age.

Anderson creates a simulation to develop game characters. A young woman named Bugs learns the simulation is running old code in a loop, enacting the moment when Trinity first found Neo within the Matrix. Bugs discovers a program embodying Morpheus, and helps free him.\nHaving deduced that Neo is alive, Bugs and Morpheus extract him from the Matrix; meanwhile, Anderson's business partner Smith regains his memories as Agent Smith, Neo's former nemesis. Neo awakens in a pod and notices Trinity confined in another one nearby, before being extracted to Bugs's hovercraft Mnemosyne. Neo is brought to the human city Io, where he reunites with an elderly Niobe. She explains that sixty years have passed in the real world since the Machine War ended, and that Neo's allies have died over time, including the original Morpheus. The peace achieved by Neo's sacrifice lasted for many years, but the large number of humans leaving the Matrix created a serious power shortage, causing the machines to fight over limited resources.\nZion was destroyed, though most of its people relocated to Io with the aid of sympathetic machines.

Moreover, he discovered that the code anomaly in Neo was actually shared in his bond with Trinity. By suppressing both their memories and keeping them close but always apart, the Matrix generated much more energy. Solving the energy crisis put the Analyst in a position to seize power from the Architect, after which he rebuilt the Matrix to control humans with emotional manipulation - citing that humans generally believe what they want to believe, but Neo's liberation destabilized the system and triggered a fail-safe to reboot the Matrix.\nThe Analyst stalled the reboot by convincing his superiors that threatening to kill Trinity would get Neo to return voluntarily to his pod. Neo and Bugs return to Io and talk to Sati, an exile program he previously met. Seeking to avenge her parents' deaths at the hands of the machines, Sati helps devise a plan to free Trinity.

Hoping to humble the youngsters, Aiden recounts his own tale of his first encounter with an Elder Dragon.\nTen years ago, Aiden was a teenager living in a small mountain village. Since the village is so small and remote, the people cannot afford the time or zenny (the in-world currency) required to go to the nearest Guild-house whenever some minor monster makes a pest of itself. Aiden had taken it upon himself to hunt down these monsters for his neighbors. He is sent into the wild to find the monster that stole some livestock from the village, only to encounter a Velocidrome, a large, blue, Velociraptor-like Bird Wyvern. Aiden is almost eaten by the monster until Julius, a Hunter from the guild, saves him and escorts him back to the village. Soon Aiden learns from Julius that the monster that took the livestock, an anthropomorphic catlike Lynian creature called a Melynx, was the true culprit and the tracks Aiden was following were fake. Aiden finds the hideout of the Melynx, named Nox. Aiden captures Nox and brings him to the village to show Julius. He soon learns from the Wyverian leader that an Elder Dragon, a monster that can devastate the environment and leave mass destruction in its wake, is on its migration path to the New World, which will bring it through Aiden's village.\nJulius agrees to bring Aiden to see the Elder Dragon to confirm the upcoming attack so that the villagers will agree to evacuate. Aiden, Julius, and Nox reach the site where the Elder Dragon was sighted. The Elder Dragon is revealed to be a Lunastra, a blue female Manticore-like Elder Dragon with powers to cause explosions with her powder. Aiden decides to have the whole village fight off the Lunastra instead of fleeing from it. Though it's against his protocol, Julius decides to stay with the village and fight off the Lunastra as well, shooting a signal flare to call other Hunters.\nLater, the trio meet up with two Hunters named Mae, the owner of a journal Nox stole, and Nadia, a Bowgunner and an old partner of Julius. They were both hunting a Nerscylla, a large, spider-like Temnoceran Monster with poisonous crystals on its back. They kill the Nerscylla and agree to help with the fight against the Lunastra. Information from a trapped villager leads them to the blacksmith Ravi, a retired Hunter who does not take kindly to strangers. He refuses to help the party, saying that there is no light at the end of the tunnel if they fight the Elder Dragon.\nThey return to Aiden's village, letting everyone in on the plan to drive off the Lunastra. During the preparations, the team attempts to hunt a Congalala, a large pink, hippo-headed primate-like Fanged Beast that consumes different mushrooms to power its breath and flatulence attacks. However, the hunt is interrupted by a Deviljho, a savage Tyrannosaurid-like Brute Wyvern with dangerous Dragon Element breath. They manage to defeat both monsters, but Julius scolds Aiden for his arrogance in failing to secure their trap for the Deviljho. Later, in the village, Nadia tells Julius to go easy on Aiden because just like him, Julius made mistakes when trying to impress his master in the past. Ravi meets up with the team, revealing he has changed his mind and decided to help fight the Elder Dragon. Ravi, with the help of many other smiths, craft a super weapon called a Dragonator using parts from the Congalala and Deviljho. Once the preparations are complete, the villagers feast and await the siege. During the fight, Ravi and Mae are killed by the Lunastra, but Aiden has an idea to use gunpowder to burst the village dam to flood the village while the rest of the team distract the Elder Dragon. The flood produced by the broken dam puts out the fire and repels the Lunastra from the village.\nAfter dealing with Lunastra, Mae and Ravi are mourned.

The British come after Kadhambari, and in the end Francis is forced to kill her to save the literature.

A while later, the two Romanian women who have also moved into the boarding house, knock on her door. They discuss their dreams about a stone box. Petra starts singing which puts Ambar to sleep.\nAmbar wakes up to Red and Becker restraining the women and preparing them to be taken down to the basement. She attacks Red to try to stop him, but Becker throws her against the wall. Beto comes looking for Ambar but is assaulted by Becker. After Becker takes one of the women downstairs; Red tells Ambar that his dad was an archeologist (as seen in the home movies at the start of the film) who brought back a stone box from his trip to Mexico in 1963.  Red's father, along with his mother, Mary, trapped and murdered women (the ghosts that Ambar has seen and heard throughout the house). After they killed their father for sacrificing their mother, Red wanted to leave but Becker insisted on staying, as each woman sacrificed to the stone box improved Becker's health.\nBecker returns and carries the screaming Ambar to the basement, where she sees the other woman has been decapitated. He ties Ambar to a stone slab in front of an altar where the box sits, opens the box and leaves the room, shutting the door behind him. Ambar continues screaming and Beto bursts into the room and unties her.\nAs they attempt to escape the basement, Ambar is caught up in a dream of her mother on her deathbed. At the same time, a large moth-like creature slowly emerges from the box and takes Ambar's head between its hands. In the dream, Ambar's mother is begging her to stay, and she begins to strangle Ambar. However, Ambar fights back and suffocates her mother instead. This causes the monster, the Aztec goddess \u012atzp\u0101p\u0101l\u014dtl (God of Paradise made possible through sacrifice), associated with the moth seen throughout the film (Rothschildia erycina), to retreat back into the box. Ambar comes out of the dream state to find herself standing by the alter alone.\nAmbar hears Becker and Red preparing Petra for sacrifice. Becker notices his wounds are not healing and says somethings wrong. Ambar grabs a macuahuitl from the study and goes upstairs, where she injures Red and is then attacked by Becker. Petra tries to help but is thrown over the balcony and killed. Becker chokes Ambar, but she slices his carotid artery with an obsidian blade from the macuahuitl, then smashes his head with it. She hears Red, wounded but alive, shuffling around in the next room. She brings him downstairs, ties him onto the stone table, and watches the monster bite off his head. Walking through the house, she passes Red, who has become a ghost like the other sacrificed women. As she starts to leave the house, her ankle, broken by Becker earlier, suddenly heals as a result of sacrificing Red to the monster. She stops and puts out her hand to let a moth land on it then turns back towards the basement door, showing the same darkened throbbing veins that Becker had.", "tmdb_id": 740925}, "62387145": {"title": "No Sudden Move", "plot": "In 1954 Detroit, Michigan, gangster Curt Goynes, in need of cash to leave town, is recruited to threaten a family as part of a blackmail scheme, along with gangsters Ronald Russo and Charley. The recruiter, Doug Jones, sends them to the house of GM accountant Matt Wertz, where they are to hold the family hostage while sending Wertz to the office where he works, to retrieve a document from his boss's safe. Finding it empty, a desperate Wertz brings fake documents to Jones, then returns home, where Charley prepares to execute the entire family, to the surprise of Goynes and Russo. Not wanting to be part of a massacre, Goynes shoots and kills Charley.\nJones phones the house, having discovered the documents are fake. He orders Goynes to kill Russo and the family, and Goynes realizes he and Russo have been set up. Before they leave, Goynes instructs the family to tell the police that Charley broke into their home and that Wertz killed Charley in self-defense. The police detective, Joe Finney, is skeptical of the family's story. Once the police leave, Goynes, Russo, and Wertz go to Wertz's boss's house in Ohio and retrieve the real document, which turns out to be plans for a new car part. Goynes and Russo discover they have a high bounty placed on their heads, and make plans to ascertain what the document is worth by arranging a meeting with Frank Capelli, the man whose wife Russo is having an affair with, and who is the mob leader who contracted the blackmail scheme. Meanwhile, Goynes makes further arrangements with mob leader Aldrick Watkins, with whom he has been on the outs, to clear himself by giving Watkins part of the eventual payment.\nGoynes and Russo have a meeting with Capelli. Goynes deduces that the value of the document vastly exceeds the amount they considered it was worth. Jones arrives and points a gun, showing that he and Capelli have been planning to turn on Goynes and Russo. In the resulting shootout, Jones is killed. Capelli flees, only to be caught by Goynes and Russo, who extract the name of his contact: Naismith, a Studebaker executive. Goynes calls Naismith and arranges to sell him the document for $125,000. Capelli escapes, but when he returns home, his battered wife Vanessa shoots and kills him, and then departs with a suitcase full of cash. Seeking a bigger payday, Goynes and Russo return to Wertz's boss's home and make him call his contact further up the chain of command, arrogant automobile manufacturer's association executive Mike Lowen. Goynes and Russo meet with Lowen at a downtown hotel, where he pays them $375,000 to return the document. It is revealed to be plans for a catalytic converter. Lowen is seeking to conceal its existence from the public to avoid government pressure on the car companies to implement pollution controls.\nAfter Lowen leaves, Goynes and Russo split the money but are interrupted by Goynes' associate, mob leader Watkins, and his men, who have already retrieved the $125,000 from Naismith. It initially seems that Goynes and Watkins may have teamed up to betray Russo, but Watkins' men lead Goynes away at gunpoint. Russo is allowed to leave with the $375,000. As Watkins and his men leave the hotel, they're stopped by Detective Finney and his policemen; Watkins bribes the detective with $50,000 of the Naismith money to let them leave with Goynes, saying that Goynes will be \"taken care of.\" Russo flees the city with Vanessa, but when they leave the main road to avoid an apparent pursuer, she kills Russo and claims the money for herself. She is soon pulled over by a policeman, who takes the $375,000 as well as her 31,000 and then allows her to leave. Detective Finney, having retrieved the $406,000 from the cop, privately returns it to Lowen, along with the $50,000 bribe from Watkins. Watkins takes Goynes to a pier, but rather than \"take care\" of him, he makes amends with him.

Because the beach naturally accelerates the lives of the guests, the researchers have been able to complete the lifelong drug trials within a day. The researchers lure a new group to the beach, but are interrupted by Trent and Maddox, who survived their underwater swim, using the notebook as evidence that they gave to vacationing police officer Greg Mitchel, who informs his boss of the researchers' crimes.

After Henry and Wyatt find a lost horse with blood on the saddle, Henry locates its owner, a near-dead man named Curry. Next to Curry is a pistol and a satchel full of money. Henry wants no part of it and gets on his horse to leave the man be. But he changes his mind and brings the unconscious Curry, and the money, back to the farm to treat his wounds. Henry interrogates Curry, who claims to be a lawman and the sole survivor of a posse sent after a gang of outlaws. He asks for help keeping the outlaws from retrieving the money he managed to steal from them.\nWhile his father goes to town for help, Wyatt secretly takes Curry's gun to practice shooting. Curry slips free and tries to wrestle back the gun, but Henry suddenly appears and overpowers him. Henry reveals that he turned back after spotting three men investigating the spot where he first found Curry. The trio, wearing sheriff's badges and led by a man named Sam Ketchum, come to the farm in search of Curry. They claim that Curry is the real outlaw but arouse Henry's suspicions when Ketchum begins asking questions about Henry's own identity and family. \nHenry does not give up Curry, and the men leave after a tense standoff. That evening, Henry has a conversation with Curry in which the latter reveals detailed knowledge of people known to Henry, which convinces Henry to undo some of his restraints. Curry tells of his experiences as a young ranch hand who witnessed the death of Billy the Kid. One of Ketchum's men, Duggan, tries to sneak under the house so he can shoot Henry from below. Henry spots him, forces Duggan out with a shotgun, and strangles him to death while Wyatt watches.\nThe next morning, Ketchum returns with his gang. Curry encourages Henry to surrender and turn him over, arguing that they should not die for his sake. However, Ketchum then takes Al as a hostage and, when Henry refuses to surrender, shoots him in cold blood. After stopping his son from running outside and getting killed, Henry goes into his room and arms himself with several guns, telling Wyatt \"Keep your damn head down, you'll be alright\". Curry recognizes the phrase as something Billy the Kid said to him years ago and realizes that Henry is in fact Billy the Kid, who faked his own death with the help of a sympathetic Pat Garrett.\nHenry pretends to surrender before shooting Ketchum in the face, gunning down several men, and slipping out the back door of his farmhouse. Whilst Curry and Wyatt hold off the remaining gang members, Henry stealthily eliminates the gang until only Stilwell, the gang's tracker, is left. Stilwell tosses his guns and tries to use his throwing knife, but Henry dodges it and shoots him through the eye.\nHenry suddenly comes under fire as Ketchum emerges, revealing that the shot only mangled his cheek. Both men chase and shoot at each other until Ketchum runs out of bullets, with Henry using his last shot to blow the outlaw's head off. Returning to the house, Henry is about to bandage up the injured Curry when he spots a brand on his arm used for marking criminals. Curry shoots Henry in the stomach, admitting that he was in fact a lawman, but sold out his colleagues so Ketchum's gang could impersonate them and steal the money. He was injured only because he tried to double-cross Ketchum. Curry apologizes but says that the chance to be the man who killed Billy the Kid is too much for him to resist.\nWyatt overhears all this, loads his father's shotgun, and kills Curry before he can finish off Henry. Wyatt tries to help his father, but Henry tells him that it is too late. Henry speaks earnestly to his son, telling him that the world is changing, and Henry has no place in it anymore but that he hoped his son would now find a place for himself after teaching him to be an honest man. He dies in Wyatt's arms.

Montagu takes a hiatus from practising law when he is appointed to the Twenty Committee. His loyal secretary, Hester Leggett, comes with him.\nBritish Prime Minister Winston Churchill has promised the United States that the Allies will invade Sicily by July of that year in order to push northward into Europe. However, Sicily is considered an obvious target and may be defended by the Wehrmacht. Admiral Godfrey informs the Twenty Committee that Britain must trick Nazi Germany into believing the Allies will invade Greece. Charles Cholmondeley proposes an operation from the Trout Memo, which would entail a corpse carrying false secrets and washing ashore. Despite Godfrey's doubts, he gives Montagu and Cholmondeley permission to plan the operation with Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming.\nOperation Mincemeat sets up an office. As planning gets underway, Montagu and Cholmondeley obtain the body of a vagrant named Glyndwr Michael, who died by possible suicidal poisoning. The team gives him the false identity of Major William Martin, Royal Marines, complete with a detailed backstory, ID photos, and an engagement. A widowed secretary in the office, Jean Leslie, offers a photo of herself to serve as the fake fianc\u00e9e. Cholmondeley has a crush on Jean, but soon realises that Montagu and Jean have romantic feelings for one another. This causes Cholmondeley to grow jealous and occasionally lash out at Montagu.\nGodfrey suspects Montagu's brother, Ivor, is a spy for Russia. He bribes Cholmondeley to spy on Montagu and, in return, Godfrey will locate and return the remains of Cholmondeley's brother, who was killed in action in Chittagong, Bengal. Cholmondeley reluctantly agrees.\nSpecialist MI5 driver St John \"Jock\" Horsfall transports Montagu, Cholmondeley, and the corpse to the R.N. Submarine Base in Holy Loch.

When Martin's personal items are returned to London, a specialist at Q Branch figures out that the documents were tampered with.

She tells him that Major Martin was travelling under an alias but the classified information was genuine. After Teddy leaves, Jean informs Montagu and Cholmondeley. They come to believe that Colonel Alexis von Roenne, who controls intelligence in the Nazi High Command, sent Teddy to verify information so Von Roenne could undermine Hitler.

In the liminal zone between life and death, Welles' thoughts flow as a stream of consciousness that loops back on itself, like a M\u00f6bius strip. Those thoughts are articulated by three avatars: the first represents the past, the memory of his youthful wunderkind self; the second represents his vestigial self-image as a swashbuckling mid-career artist, bemused to be crumpled on the floor in his bathrobe, dying; the last, represents his spirit, out of time\u2014what Heidegger called an ecstace. On its face, the audience is presented with a series of essays about how opera and film overlap. The relationship between a man and the roles that he has played is examined\u2014Falstaff, Othello, Brutus, Ahab, Kane, Quinlin (from Touch of Evil), and himself.\nIn stream of consciousness dramatic beats, he first surveys his relationship to the works of Shakespeare, then revisits the accidental drowning of Manoel Olimpio Meira during the filming of It's All True. He contemplates the sound of his own heart; and then lashes out, reliving the pain of his repeated loss of creative control in the editing of The Magnificent Ambersons. He recalls Marc Blitzstein at the piano the night that The Cradle Will Rock debuted before rolling into a rollicking remembrance of the high-octane life he led, reliving the giddy joy of careening across Manhattan in a rented ambulance (to better cut through traffic) at the top of his game on his way from a Danton's Death rehearsal to the War of the Worlds radio broadcast.\nHis thoughts turn to his despair at the recutting of Touch of Evil, which he repurposes in imagination as the realization that he is dying.

A passionate social activist, Welles' last thoughts are of the future: with the foresight available only to the dead, he mourns his country as the words of a xenophobic reality television president are intercut with Emma Lazarus' hymn to liberty. But the body gives out even though the spirit is still willing: it is no longer Welles' problem, it is ours.

After some back and forth and Terje making unfounded claims that he would get an Israeli official to join the talks, Mona decides to break the secret to Johan J\u00f8rgen Holst, the Norwegian minister of foreign affairs, who facilitates a meeting with Uri Savir from the Israeli foreign ministry to review the DOP.\nThis meeting starts very aggressive with Savir and Qurei accusing each other of terrorism and murder, but again warms up over time with Savir expressing willingness to give up the Gaza Strip and Jericho\u2015a city 20 miles outside of Jerusalem\u2015to the Palestinians as an autonomous region.\nUri Savir then presents the result to Joel Singer, the legal adviser of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who meets with the group to finalize the document with official backing. Instead of finalizing the document, it almost leads to a breakup of the talks over Singer's attempts to rewrite the document. At the request of Hirschfeld, Mona finally breaks her \"facilitate only\" doctrine and gets involved. She can defuse the situation by sharing her own story about the conflict, which was hinted by flashbacks throughout the movie.\nAfter that the Oslo Accord is meant to be finalized through a telephone conference between Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat.

They tail him to the pier where he's been smuggling weapons in containers and Serge plants a tracker on one of the shipments. They come to the conclusion via analysis that L\u00e9pervier isn't working alone, barely being a middleman, and the arms are actually supplied by the Soviet Union to back their revolution.\nThe next morning, using Serge's tracking device, they head out to L\u00e9pervier's warehouse, fighting off hostile rebels in the process, they set explosive charges to the containers and escape just in time they blow up, killing L\u00e9pervier in the blast.

She unveils her true schemes as to have the Soviets as their allies with the belief that communism will instill equality among the people. Hubert appears to sympathize with her pacifism, and it leads to the both of them spending a romantic night together, only for Hubert's colonial-minded nature to thwart the mutual understanding they seemed to have and raise hostile tensions between the two, ending up in his reimprisonment.

Chase manages to save Gus, revealing his truck is leaking maple syrup. He and Ryder bring the baby sea turtle back to its family.\nMeanwhile in Adventure City, the PAW Patrol's arch-nemesis Mayor Humdinger has recently been elected mayor (although it pointed out that he was the only candidate on the ballot after the leading candidate suddenly dropped out). Knowing of Humdinger's infamous wrongdoings from Foggy Bottom, a dachshund named Liberty calls and begs the team to come to Adventure City to help keep the people safe from Mayor Humdinger. When the team is ready to go, but Chase refuses to go due to having a \"history\" in Adventure City when he was a young pup after he was abandoned by his previous owners, and the city was so big and he was so small. Ryder convinces him to go back while Chase reluctantly gives him his trust. The team is heading on a road trip to Adventure City, they arrived and get settled into their new satellite headquarters.\nMeanwhile, Humdinger uses a Cloud Catcher device to clear up the weather so he can do his firework show. The show goes haywire and the team is alerted. They suited up and grab their vehicles to rush straight into a traffic jam, but Liberty arrives and guides them through alleyways and back streets to get to City Hall. They manage to take care of the situation, but Chase fails to save some people who are then rescued by Marshall instead. An infuriated Humdinger tells his henchmen Butch and Ruben to get rid of the PAW Patrol by any means necessary. That night, Chase keeps dwelling over his mistake while the next morning, Liberty reveals her first time helping her heroes like she's an honorary member of the team.\nThe next day, Humdinger builds an extension to the subway line with several inversions similar to a roller coaster  loop-de-loop section called the \"Humdinger Hyperloop\". It breaks and traps the passengers upside-down. The pups race to rescue them, but Chase freezes when his fear gets the best of him. Marshall manages to get the people down with his ladder while Skye goes to pick up Chase from the rooftop. Ryder suggests Chase should take a break from his duties, but this greatly hurts him and causes him to run away out of heartbreak after accusing Ryder of breaking his trust and giving up on him when things get difficult, hurting Ryder's feelings in response. Chase gets captured by Butch and Ruben and is taken to Fuzzy Buddies obedience school (which was turned into a dog pound) where he meets his fellow inmates Delores, Barney, Harris, and Rocket. While searching for Chase, Liberty and Ryder discover that numerous dogs have gone missing and he links them to Humdinger. Liberty gets captured on purpose and is taken to the obedience school where she encourages and rescues Chase while the other dogs then chase Butch and Ruben. The team is heading away from the obedience school and decides to split up.\nOn the way back to HQ, Ryder takes Chase to the street crossing intersection where he saved his life. Ryder explains to Chase that he chose to save him, not out of pity, but because he was the bravest pup he ever met. Chase's collar is returned to him, as Ryder asks him to go to work and Chase agrees that he will resume his duties and rejoins the team. Meanwhile, the Cloud Catcher has gone critical and its creator Kendra Wilson confronts Humdinger. He destroys the remote and reveals his building called Humdinger Heights. The Cloud Catcher unleashes weeks\u2019 worth of bad weather into the sky, causing a massive hurricane over Adventure City and the citizens are in big danger. When Kendra calls the team for help, they deployed and grab their vehicles to be ready for launch, and Liberty then receives her own vehicle from Ryder, a three-wheeled scooter with a speed-booster (which was replaced by her wagon as a vehicle with a busted wheel) and her uniform (minus her collar and pup tag), temporarily joining the team. The team race to Humdinger Heights and forces them to improvise. Chase managed to save the citizens from the flying vehicles, while Marshall, Rocky, and Rubble work to keep the citizens inside Humdinger Heights, Zuma and Liberty go to the canals to save a family from a drowning car, and Skye flies into the air to stop the Cloud Catcher.\nRyder takes the elevator to the top office and saves Humdinger by forcing him on an elevator and dropping him faster to the ground floor. He resorts to rappelling down the elevator shaft, but the storm destroys the tower and he is trapped in the building when it falls down. A horrified Chase notices that Ryder's in danger, he rushes and drives up to save him and sees Ryder's light from the other side of the building. When he runs towards the other side, Chase realizes that there is a large gap between him and Ryder. Choosing to launch his grappling hook to the other side, Chase almost gets pulled from the tower when the wind causes his pup pack to malfunction and nearly make him fall, forcing him to disengage his pup pack to save himself. Feeling his fear coming back, Chase remembers what Ryder said to him before, letting out a heroic scream and taking a leap of faith, and manages to make it across to the other side. Having made it to the far side, Chase sees Ryder pinned under the debris and works with him to get him free. After that, they share a moment and later leave the building while Skye destroys the Cloud Catcher in a kamikaze-style attack, sacrificing her helicopter (which is transformed into her jet) before it crashes and she flies back down to the city. After this, the skies are clear and sunny again, Chase and Ryder come out of the building and the pups are relieved to see them safe. Ryder is proud of his team and the citizens emerge from the building congratulating them for a job well done. Chase then catches Mayor Humdinger and places him under arrest for gross negligence, public endangerment, and \"dognapping\". While Humdinger tries to escape, he is stopped by Skye's mini-drone with his pants accidentally being ripped off and reveals his underpants.\nThe following day, the team is hailed as heroes and given the key to Adventure City in a major ceremony by Kendra and Adventure City News reporter Marty Muckraker. Liberty enters the stage and becomes an official member of the team, finally fulfilling her aspirations of doing so, and is given her own collar and pup tag. Ryder begins to make a speech about how they will always be there for Adventure City, but gets interrupted by a call from Harris, one of the dogs from the obedience school, saying there is another emergency down at the waterfront. Chase declares to Ryder that he and the pups are ready, the PAW Patrol then grabs their vehicles and drives off to the rescue together.\nDuring the credits, Mayor Humdinger and the Catastrophe Crew are shown to have been apprehended and detained for their crimes throughout the movie while being removed from the city mayoral office, the Cloud Catcher has been rebuilt, and Butch and Ruben are riding a tandem bicycle while pulling a cart full of cats.", "tmdb_id": 675445}, "68569824": {"title": "The Pebble and the Boy", "plot": "The film starts with John, a teenager living in Manchester, learning that his father (who he barely knew) has died in a scooter accident.

Furthermore, the company responsible for the show wishes to invite them to Japan for a record deal. With this in mind, the crew reconcile and travel to Japan. Miche, Grindah's wife, later joins the crew after obtaining a ticket.\nIn Japan, the Kurupt FM crew are assigned a manager, Taka, and a translator, Miki. The introduction of Taka proves antagonistic for Chabuddy, who notices Taka trying to replace him as their manager, which is further proved when he is ejected from a club. With Steves' eccentric behaviour and Miki acting as a weed dealer for him, the two become very close. While in Tokyo, the company plans Kurupt FM's debut to the Japanese audience, with a concert featuring them planned within a week of them arriving and a record deal. However, the exact terms and conditions regarding their deal are unknown, as Chabuddy deleted the email regarding the small print.\nThe Kurupt FM crew's first day in action proves disappointing. Instead of visiting a recording studio as they anticipated, the crew are led to a dance studio to perform a dance commonly featured on the game show, associated with their song, much to their chagrin. After being covertly manipulated by Taka, Grindah insists to the crew that the dances are necessary and are needed for their success in Japan.\nLater on, the crew go for a photo shoot in their outfits for the concert, and it becomes clear that Taka is publicising Grindah as more important than the rest of the members, prompting an argument within the crew.

Aretha\u2019s father often has her sing for parties at their home, while her mother Barbara, separated from C.L., encourages her independence. The predatory actions of a family friend, combined with the sudden death of Barbara, traumatizes Aretha, who ceases to speak for weeks until her father demands that she sing at church.\nSeven years later, Aretha is a teen mother of two boys, but refuses to name their father. Touring as a gospel singer with family friend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., she meets local producer Ted White, but C.L. warns him to stay away. C.L. surprises Aretha with a meeting with Columbia Records executive John Hammond.

She brings him home to meet her family, leading C.L. to nearly shoot him, but announces Ted as her manager.\nTwo years later, Ted and Aretha are married with a child.

In the wake of Dr. King's assassination, Aretha's father drunkenly argues with her over the direction of the Movement, telling her that she no longer walks in the spirit.

On a downward spiral and estranged from Ken and her family, she is consoled by a vision of her late mother. Aretha finds the strength to quit drinking, leading Ken to reconcile with her, and returns to her gospel roots.

Roohi was actually supposed to be married a year ago, but the groom and his family fled after seeing she was possessed.\nBhawra falls for Roohi and tries to coax the spirit from her body; Kattanni, on the other hand, is smitten by the demonic spirit, who identifies herself as Afza, and tries to bring her forward instead of Roohi so that he can talk to her. They learn that the demon is a Mudiyapairi (a witch with backward-turned feet who is deemed to be extremely strong) and she will not leave unless she gets married along with the girl she is possessing. Guniya Bhai, fearing the police investigation behind Roohi's kidnapping, instructs them to abandon her, but they refuse, forcing him to send his henchmen to get the job done.

Due to a seal's color-blindness, Claggart ends up cutting the wrong wire, and the mine immediately blows up once hauled onto their ship, the Good Boy. This causes a portion of the ship to be destroyed and the ship to wrecked on a rock, while the H.M.M.F. all survive unscathed, though Claggart loses his name tags which drifts off to rest near Seal Island, an island endlessly full of seals. Over time, the now retired H.M.M.F. drift apart: Claggart stays behind on the wreck of the Good Boy, Switch goes insane and lives on his own wreck that he turns into a lab with his imaginary friend, Senior Echo, and Dolph goes into show business in his own popular superhero show titled: Dial Eck-Eck-Eck-Eck For Action.\nIn the present day, Claggart's name tag is found by a bold cape fur seal named Quinn and his nervous best friend Benji while hunting for a fish, before they are chased off by sharks, whom their community lives in fear of, but their fear is always scoffed at by their elder leader, Brick. Due to the shortage of food, the seals are all forced to eat bad-tasting barnacles while having to wait for the annual sardine run. After retrieving the name tag, Quinn and Benji both share each of the name tags, and go out at night to search for food amongst the human shipwrecks with no luck, afoul of a great white shark named Grimes and his remora associates, who tries to eat them. Quinn manages to survive by hiding in the wreck, he calls for Benji to join him, but learns he has been eaten by Grimes after seeing his part of the name tag snagged on his teeth, who then goes for him next, but Quinn is then saved by an elderly Claggart, who drives off Grimes and brings him back to the surface and reclaims his name tag before leaving Quinn. After he comes to, he is found by three cape gannets named Diving Dee, Roger, and Mayday, who has been trying to eat a starfish that has been stuck in her mouth for years, who guide him to the wreck of the Good Boy, where Quinn insist Claggart into teaching him how to fight a shark, which he had experienced him do that to Grimes before he passed out, so he can avenge Benji's death.\nAfter some advice by Claggart to assemble a team in order to accomplish his goal, he returns to Seal Island, where he recruits the energetic but eccentric Beth, who prefers and suggests to licking rocks rather than eat barnacles, and the boastful yet cowardly Great Geraldo, who keeps telling everyone that comes his way about escaping an aquarium in Cape Town, but had to leave behind his Asian girlfriend, Magnificent Jing. They arrive at the Good Boy where Claggart teaches them the skills they need to fight sharks and eventually they pass the final exam. Later that night, after being convinced by Quinn, Claggart takes them to Switch's wreck, where he accepts the offer to join them and shows off his latest biotech weapons to help them, including snapping clam grenades, electric eel bolts, pufferfish mines, stolen synchronized watches (Geraldo instead gets a toy watch), barracuda bazookas, pistol shrimps (that shoots an blast of knockout gas when used), and a group of octopuses all named Flicka, who can all turn into a suit that makes anyone invisible. With their training and new weapons, they successfully take down a shark. Two onlooking sharks see this, and report to Grimes, who decides to make an example of them by using his remoras to summon all the sharks in the world, including the one that Quinn and his friends trapped.\nThe gannets tell the group of the situation, so Switch suggests using his special formula chum to hypnotize the sharks and lure them away from Seal Island, so they go to Cape Town to retrieve a boat in order to install the chum. Once there, Geraldo reunites with Jing, who forces him to reveal that escaping the aquarium was Jing's idea that she escaped and left him behind due to the fact that he could not go through with it, and he was thrown out instead of escaping. After some convincing, Jing joins the team, as they acquire a boat and head back to Seal Island, where they use the chum to lure the sharks away from Seal Island and use the advantage to bombard the sharks with their weapons. When the shark they fought attacks their boat, it crashes into a crevice where one of Grimes' remoras gets separated from the shark and take it hostage where they learn from it that surrounding Seal Island was a distraction to keep them busy while Grimes was gathering more shark forces. Geraldo and Jing stay behind to distract the sharks surrounding the boat wreck by tricking them with a play with fake replicas, in which they amend their ways before joining the others near Grimes' wreck to learn his true intentions.\nWith the help of Flicka, Quinn goes undercover and learns that Grimes is planning to lead an endless population of sharks to attack the Seal Island population on their south to the upcoming annual sardine run.

Knowing that their fate is in his hands, Quinn returns to the Good Boy.\nThey arrive at Grimes' lair in a sunken oil tanker by sneaking inside the mouth of Dave, a goofy looking, loud-mouthed basking shark whom they frequently encounter. Once there, they assault all the sharks with ambushes, and they hide in a container, but they eventually escape, and manage to protect all the seals, who also lose their fear and join in the fight, along with Brick. They are also joined by Claggart, who is revealed to be alive and had gone to recruit Dolph for the team, who both restart the Good Boy, allowing a chance for the seals to escape on board. Grimes pounces onto the ship ands snags Claggart's name tag on Quinn with the other name tag snagged on his tooth, resulting in a tug-of-war, but Quinn breaks free and retrieves both name tags while Grimes falls back into the sea, and is killed by the Good Boy's propeller.\nMonths later, Quinn and his friends have hauled the Good Boy to Seal Island as their new base, where the residents of Seal Island now honor them as heroes, and they, along with the gannets and Dave, keep the island safe from any seal-eating shark that comes by.\nIn a series of mid-credits scenes, Dave is seen as a caller on a talk show radio station, where continuously talks about the many objects he accidentally ate other than plankton to prove that not all sharks are dangerous.", "tmdb_id": 823610}, "62379098": {"title": "Seance (2021 film)", "plot": "One night at the Edelvine Academy for Girls, a clique of girls led by ruthless popular girl Alice, play a prank on their classmate Kerrie by faking a haunting by the Edelvine Ghost, an urban legend involving a student who killed herself.

Captain Muller of the French Police, who is leading the investigation, identifies the suspect as Yvan Kadnikov, the son of Leonid Kadnikov who is an influential and well-connected Russian tycoon. Yvan is hiding out in his father's villa at Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, but both have diplomatic passports and immunity, making them untouchable without a complicated legal process.\nUnwilling to wait for justice, Klara catches Yvan at the nightclub and he tells her that he had not touched her sister. His friends come to his rescue and Klara is evicted after a fight with them. Later, she infiltrates Leonid's villa to find Yvan, but is captured by Leonid's bodyguards. Leonid taunts Klara, freely admitting that it was he who had raped Tania since his son was not interested in women because he was a homosexual. He leaves her to be drowned by his guards, but Klara fights free and escapes. Tania later awakens from her coma, but decides not to press charges despite Klara's urging her to do so. While outside her sister's hospital room, Klara sees a news report in which Leonid states that he will be returning to Russia soon.

In that ongoing fight, a guy hits him on his head, which leads him to ear bleeding and starts suffering from a psychological disorder that temporarily manifest him into a different personality.\nImpressed with the short film, the producer green-lights Vasu's feature film. A year later, Vasu releases his film, Uniki, which turns out to be successful. Vasu is offered to remake the film in Hindi but during a press conference for the remake in Mumbai, Vasu is arrested on charges of copyright infringement.

Vasu pleads his innocence and after a successful polygraph test, the court releases him on unconditional bail and gives them 3 days to present their case.

As his family disapproves of his methods, he decides to leave but stumbles upon Maitreyi, a devadasi from Bangladesh who dances in the temple during the Navaratri. Despite being an atheist, Shyam visits the temple every night to see Maitreyi. One night, he asks her to sneak out of the temple with him and she reluctantly agrees.

Doctor Wan started treating her differently after the fits.\nWhile visiting the company, they sit through Doctor Wan's TED talk.

Lawyer Matt Murdock gets Parker's charges dropped, but the group grapples with negative publicity. After Parker, MJ, and Ned's MIT applications are rejected, Parker goes to the New York Sanctum to ask Stephen Strange for help. Strange starts casting a spell that would make everyone forget Parker is Spider-Man, but it is corrupted when Parker repeatedly requests alterations to let his loved ones retain their memories, ultimately causing Strange to contain the spell to stop it.\nAt Strange's suggestion, Parker tries to convince an MIT administrator to reconsider the applications of MJ and Ned, but is attacked by Otto Octavius. Octavius rips nanotechnology from Parker's Iron Spider suit, which bonds with his mechanical tentacles and allows Parker to control them. As Norman Osborn arrives and attacks, Strange teleports Parker back to the Sanctum and locks Octavius in a cell next to Curt Connors. Strange explains that the corrupted spell summoned people from other universes within the multiverse who know Spider-Man's identity. He orders Parker, MJ, and Ned to find and capture them; they locate and retrieve Max Dillon and Flint Marko at a military research facility.\nOsborn reclaims control of himself from his split Green Goblin personality and destroys the Goblin mask. He goes to a F.E.A.S.T. building, where May comforts him before Parker retrieves him. While discussing their battles with Spider-Man, Osborn, Octavius, and Dillon realize they were pulled from their universes just before their deaths. Strange prepares to reverse the contained spell and send the villains back to their respective universes, but Parker argues that they should first cure the villains of the insanity that would lead to their deaths, to possibly change their fates upon their return. When Strange refuses, Parker steals the spell, traps Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and, with May, takes the villains to Happy Hogan's apartment, where he uses Stark Industries technology to cure Octavius. Before Parker can cure anyone else, his spider-sense goes off. He then discovers that the Goblin persona retook control of Osborn, who convinces the uncured villains to betray Parker. As Dillon, Marko, and Connors escape, the Goblin fatally injures May. Before she dies, May tells Parker that \"with great power, there must also come great responsibility\".\nNed discovers that he can create portals using Strange's sling ring, which he and MJ use to try to locate Parker. They instead find alternate versions of Parker from the villains' universes who were also summoned by Strange's spell and who are nicknamed \"Peter-Two\" and \"Peter-Three\". The group finds this universe's Parker, nicknamed \"Peter-One\", who is ready to give up and send the villains home to die. The alternate Parkers share stories of losing loved ones and encourage Peter-One to fight in May's honor, and the three Parkers develop cures for the villains.\nThe group lure Dillon, Marko, and Connors to the Statue of Liberty. Peter-One and Peter-Two cure Connors and Marko, while Octavius arrives to help cure Dillon, and Ned frees Strange from the Mirror Dimension. The Goblin appears and unleashes the contained spell, which breaks apart the barriers between universes, pulling in countless others who know Parker's identity. Strange attempts to hold them off while an enraged Peter-One tries to kill the Goblin. Peter-Two stops him, but gets stabbed by the Goblin. Peter-Three helps Peter-One inject the Goblin with his cure, restoring Osborn's sanity. Peter-One realizes that the only way to protect the multiverse is to erase Peter Parker from everyone's memory and requests Strange to do so while promising MJ and Ned that he will find them again. Strange reluctantly casts the spell, and everyone returns to their respective universes\u2014including Eddie Brock, who unknowingly leaves behind a piece of the Venom symbiote.\nTwo weeks later, Parker visits MJ to reintroduce himself, but he decides against it.

While on her Sunday dinner shift, she meets Max, a transfer student from England, a DJ who she shares a Calculus class with, and his mother. Sundays are also special in the restaurant because of Nani's special performance to classic Bollywood songs. At home, we see Arvind partly reeling from the emotional turmoil of losing his wife eight years ago. Although Nani tries to convince him to move on and let it go, it's hard for him.\nMeanwhile, in a flashback, we are shown a younger Rhea (eight years old) in her room at night, complaining to her mother Meera she cannot sleep because of the overwhelming sounds from the nearby electronic dance music festival, and the radio. Meera describes to her the different sounds she can hear, and shows her she doesn't have to take it all in, just the sounds she likes, before telling her , \"it's all music\". She then kisses her goodnight, and leaves the room, humming the lullaby she would always hum to her while doing that. Back to the present, Rhea goes to sleep.\nThe next morning, she and her friends Watson, Molly, and Gingers gossip about Max, then shift to talking about Rhea's idea of the homecoming fundraiser \"Festival of Colors\", inspired by the Hindu festival of Holi, before they go to class. In the class, Watson and Molly present their pizza drone, but the pizza drops before they can land it safely. Miss Naomi asks them to clean up, before she calls on Rhea, who presents an app for tracking inventory and sales at her family restaurant. Although Miss Naomi is relieved that it's not a failure like the pizza drone, she is a bit unsettled because the assignment was supposed to be about fun projects. Even though Rhea insists this is fun for her, Miss Naomi, even though she accepts that insistence for the time being, is uncertain whether Rhea feels burdened by responsibility. Later that night, Rhea shows Arvind the app for the restaurant, and Arvind is impressed and happy.\nThe next day, while the rest of the gang have their lunch, Ginger runs to them in panic after the DJ she had hired for the festival is unavailable, and Rhea, after she remembers having bonded with Max about music, playlists and mixes, recommends him to Ginger. The event is a success despite Ginger's constant anxiety, and Max thanks Rhea for recommending him to Ginger, offering to repay her kindness. She is initially hesitant, but finally asks him to teach her the art of the turntable, and Max agrees to take her to the vinyl store. The next day, at the vinyl store, he shows her what each of the parts of the turntable do, and they are at it on the turntable when their common favorite DJ Luka Cent walks in, drawn by the music, clearly liking it, and asks them to meet him at the billing counter, where they get flyers for the contest \"Battle of the Beatmasters\". They bond over coffee and Max invites her for practice at his house. Over the next few days, she learns more about the art of DJ mixing, and improves daily.\nResponsibility beckons as she ends up being late for her dinner shift, and her work-life balance falls apart as she either turns up late at school or does not turn up at all, even when they are working on improving the track that he made and which was rejected by Ginger. It all starts to crack when the plates she's carrying fall down and break, although Nani is there to save her day. Finally on the day of the fundraiser, she is tasked with looking after the enormous amount of guests of a baby-shower, which she sneaks out of to attend the festival and enjoy with her friends. When the track has been played, Max fails to acknowledge Rhea, leading to an argument between him and her after the show, while unbeknownst to Max, Rhea's gang has been watching them, and confronts him after she storms out.\nBack home, Arvind grounds Rhea for two months. Discouraged by how everything's falling apart, and heartbroken that Max did not acknowledge her after she helped him create the track, at the cost of her own integrity and peace of mind, she turns to her Nani, who tells her it's not on her to keep her father happy when he can't move on from Meera's death thinking he has only the restaurant and them both to care for. About her not being acknowledged by Max, Nani tells Rhea she will make more tracks, and \"fill the world with so much music it will crush him\", and when Rhea confides in Nani about her fear that she may have given him her best ideas, Nani smiles and recounts how Meera used to have the same notion, the same dark cloud of mope, exhaustion and sorrow over her, thinking the \"well has run dry\", and before Nani knew, Meera would hum a new tune as she walked around the house. Nani then takes out a box containing Meera's prized possessions, including her wedding gajra, her cassettes, and her cassette player. Rhea spends the night and the next morning listening to those cassettes and something sparks in her amid the calm.\nLater one day, her gang turns up at her doorstep with DJ equipment from Molly's Gen-X-er father's basement, and with news that they entered her into the contest with an edit of her playlists. Although adamant up to that point that she won't compete, she finally decides to enter the contest after Ginger shows her Max has already entered, that too with the track she practically made for him with much sacrifice.\nOver the next few days, she starts working on her track, while her friends procure sounds and footage for her. She also incorporates her mother's music in the track she has prepared for the final. When her Nani listens to the track, she feels as if Meera is back with her, and they prepare for the contest, Nani with her makeup and dress to support her daughter and Rhea with her equipment and her attire, and both of them taking a day off from the restaurant. Amid all the rush, they, along with the gang and Miss Naomi, reach the venue, and both Rhea and Max crush the semi-finals, reaching the finals. Meanwhile, at the restaurant, Arvind catches Rohan watching Ginger's Instagram Live feed with Rhea in it, and realizes he had been lied to about groceries. He takes Rohan along with him to the venue of the contest, to confront Rhea.\nBack at the contest, Max has already played the track Rhea made for him, and has received a round of applause from everybody but the gang. As Rhea's turn approaches, she takes a deep breath before she comes to the stage. When she puts on her track, people start to sway, and everybody's initially intrigued, finally getting to the groove. When Arvind does arrive, it is at this moment that he hears his late wife's musical voice on the speaker, and is both overwhelmed and happy that she's watching from above over her daughter, realizing that this is where Rhea is happy. He discards the idea of confronting Rhea, and joins Nani, Miss Naomi and the gang in dancing to the music. After the track ends, Rhea and Max are called to the stage, and Rhea is declared the winner. Max, having been defeated by her, and regretting not having cared about her, runs away amidst the crowd of newfound fans Rhea meets outside.\nThe mid-credits show that Sunday nights at the restaurant are now DJ nights, with DJ Rhea on the turntable; Watson and Molly have finally perfected their pizza drone project which now also serves food to the guests; Naomi and Arvind have been growing closer since the contest. Rhea is happy, having finally found what she wanted to do, and honoring her late mother."}, "68933469": {"title": "The Spine of Night", "plot": "The story begins with the witch-queen Tzod ascending a snowy mountain.

While the guardian initially threatens her and tries to drive her away, she shows an identical flower, explaining that her people had found where it had cast a seed long ago.  \nShe then begins to tell the events that have led her here, which largely concern a renegade scholar named Ghal-Sur.  After both he and Tzod are thrown in the prison of a young tyrant, she uses the power of the Bloom to help them escape.  Shortly thereafter, Ghal-Sur murders the queen and steals the Bloom from her;  when he returns to his fellow scholars, he is imprisoned for a time, but manages to convince some of them to assist as he performs a ritual to unlock more of the Bloom's power.  He then becomes a tyrant in his own right, marching armies across the countryside and eventually creating great war machines to expand his conquest.  An unknown number of years later, a trio of assassins attempt to stop him, managing only to incinerate his stores of the Bloom instead; the last trace of it travels downstream until it finds the corpse of Tzod, resurrecting her and driving her to seek the guardian as she did in the beginning.\nThe Guardian also tells the story of the Bloom itself:  The giant skull it rests in was the last god before men killed it, but even that god was the progeny of a greater god, whose severed head formed the world, and the Bloom communicates to those who bear it that this cycle goes on upward and upward without end, eternal and violent.  The Guardian Tzod meets is only the most recent, as they exist in their own cycle: many come seeking the bloom, and each guardian has discovered the bloom, learned its secrets, and concluded its knowledge is unbearable to the world at large.  Each Guardian has defended the bloom for the rest of their lives, until they became too weary, and allowed themselves to be felled by a prospective seeker of the Bloom who learns the massive truth of the universe and decides to conceal it, becoming the next Guardian. It is revealed that the present Guardian had breathed across the Bloom when he first learned its truth, and was the one to initially spread seeds of it.\nIn the present, Tzod beckons Ghal-Sur to the mountain peak where the Bloom rests, and while his soldiers quickly mortally wound her, she is able to use the Bloom's power to raise the bodies of the previous guardians, who butcher the soldiers and allow Tzod to deal a deathblow to Ghal-Sur.

Unable to escape the trap in time, Bozwick is hit by the train and killed. The next day, police Captain Angie Garza assigns Detective Zeke Banks a new partner, idealistic rookie William Schenk. Banks and Schenk investigate Bozwick's death and Banks recognizes the elaborate trap as the modus operandi of the now deceased Jigsaw Killer.\nMeanwhile, homicide detective Fitch \u2013 who several years prior had ignored a backup call from Banks, resulting in Banks nearly getting killed \u2013 is abducted and placed in a trap where he must allow a device to rip his fingers off to avoid electrocution in a filling water basin; he also fails to escape and dies. Some officers begin to suspect that Banks may be responsible, due to his history with Fitch. A box then arrives at the station, containing a pig puppet and a piece of Schenk's tattooed skin inside. A small vial inside the box directs the police to a butcher shop, which was previously a hobby shop that Banks and his father, retired chief Marcus Banks, used to visit. Upon arriving, the team discovers a tape recorder and a skinned corpse, identified as Schenk. Deciding to track down the killer himself, Marcus travels to a warehouse, where he is abducted. Shortly afterwards, Garza is kidnapped, and placed in a trap in the precinct's cold storage where she has to sever her spinal cord on a blade to stop boiling wax flowing from a pipe onto her face.

He then discovers his former partner Peter Dunleavy, who was imprisoned when Banks exposed a murder he committed, chained in place. In front of him is a large glass-crushing machine, which has been modified to hurl shrapnel at him. A tape recorder explains that Banks can choose to either free him or leave him to die. Although Banks attempts to save Dunleavy, he cannot get the key in time. Moving to another room, Banks then finds Schenk, who is revealed to have faked his own death by using the skinned corpse of the thief who lured Bozwick into the tunnels, and has been the copycat all along. He explains that his last name is actually Emmerson, the son of Charlie Emmerson, who was the man Dunleavy killed because he had agreed to testify against a dirty cop. He also reveals that Marcus, during his time as chief, deliberately protected corrupt officers to \"clean\" the streets of crime more efficiently under Article 8.\nBelieving that Banks can be an ally, Emmerson presents him with a final test, revealing Marcus suspended above the floor and slowly being drained of blood. Emmerson calls 9-1-1 and claims that he is a civilian being pursued by a shooter, resulting in the dispatch of a SWAT team. He hands Banks a revolver with one cartridge, and offers him the choice to either shoot a target that will save Marcus but allow Emmerson to escape, or to kill Emmerson and let Marcus bleed to death. Banks shoots the target to save his father, causing his restraints to loosen and lowering him to the ground, and then begins to fight Emmerson. The SWAT team arrives and inadvertently triggers a tripwire, causing Marcus' restraints to yank him upward again.

The downcast Hyuk returns home. But, being unable to forget Da-eun, he manages to find out her phone number and gives her a call. She eventually invites him to come over to her house, and he stays the night. In the morning Da-eun wakes up to find that Hyuk replaced the broken lamp in her hallway and prepared breakfast for the two of them. Touched by the gestures, they share a brief kiss.\nAfter a while, Da-eun tells Hyuk that she won tickets to Jeju Island for Christmas, and she invites him to join her.

This means that there will be a long commute from Incheon to Seoul and that if he does well he might be granted a permanent position at the firm. However, on his first day, he finds out there is another candidate; this means that he would not be guaranteed a permanent position at the end of his contract. The other candidate, Bo-yeong (Krystal Jung), turns out to be very competitive, regularly undermining him to make herself look better in the eyes of their superior.\nAt a board meeting where the team presents a new bridge design based on a proposal by Bo-yeong, Hyuk points out that there is a critical flaw in the design that would lead to a collapse if the bridge would ever be hit by a tsunami. A humiliated Bo-yeong is told to fix the problem together with Hyuk. While Hyuk leaves early she works throughout the night without taking a rest. At the start, Hyuk takes pleasure in seeing her suffer, but he eventually takes pity on her, and they end up working together to fix the problem. The two start bonding and they continue working on more projects together.\nMeanwhile, some strain is showing on the relationship of Hyuk and Da-eun, with both of them regularly working late and Hyuk becoming increasingly frustrated at having to commute between Incheon and Seoul. He usually comes home tired and shows little interest in Da-eun. One night when he comes home Da-eun complains about him not having fixed the broken light bulb and his refusal to take out the trash. When they start arguing she tells him that she hasn't had her period, and it turns out that she is expecting his child, which she aborts later on.\nRather than being pleased, it seemed to frustrate Hyuk even more. As he realizes he has feelings for Bo-yeong, he starts to distance himself from her and focuses on Da-eun. However, this eventually starts to impact his work. Bo-yeong confronts him and tells him that both of their performance will suffer. Hyuk agrees to work late, and he starts doing overtime again, leaving Da-eun alone at home.\nOne evening, Da-eun and Hyuk were seen going out together. Hyuk shows no interest in spending time with Da-eun and continuously complains about the crowd and repeatedly says that he wants to eat and go home. Back in the car Da-eun complains that Hyuk never wants to spend time with her anymore. Hyuk brushes it off and accidentally calls her his \"pretty Bo-yeong\". They get into a big argument in which he denies Da-eun's claims that he's cheating on her. He eventually drops her off at their once shared house as he drives off in a fury.\nBack in Seoul, Bo-yeong and Hyuk are once again working overtime. With all their time spent together and the gradually growing sexual tension between both of them, Hyuk kisses Bo-yeong. Both of them eventually get romantically involved. After a while, Hyuk becomes restless and appears to be longing for Da-eun again. When neither Bo-yeong or himself is offered a permanent position by the firm, Hyuk tells Bo-yeong at the firm's team dinner that he will return to his previous position in Incheon. She in turn tells him that she will study abroad as her old job is also not a permanent contract.

Coincidentally, their flight was meant to be that very evening. Realizing he still loves Da-eun, he rushes to the airport in a taxi. As he pulls up at the airport, he sees Da-eun standing on the sidewalk in front of the airport building. Jumping out of the taxi, he sees her supposedly waving at him. He runs towards her but bumps into someone and falls over.\nThe man he ran into turns out to be the Hyuk shown in the first part of the film. The scene is the same one from earlier when Da-eun gave the matching pair of sneakers. It is revealed that the Hyuk from the start of the film is a different Hyuk than the one from the main part of the film. Both storylines happened simultaneously, and it turns out Da-eun bonded with Hyuk while she felt neglected by her partner Jang-Hyuk and because he did all the things Jang-Hyuk didn't do, such as fixing the light bulb.

A few weeks later, Asuna and Mito head off to kill nepenthes, a plant-based monster located in a mountainous terrain of the floor. Mito warns Asuna that killing the nepenthes with a ball over its head will cause it to spew out smoke and trigger a massive assault of nearby plants, and to avoid it at all cost. During battle, Mito leaves to capture a rare sly shrewman and during that time Asuna unknowingly kills the nepenthes with the overhead ball, triggering an onslaught of them. Mito attempts to save Asuna but is forced over a cliff by the plants and is unable to reach her as the nepenthes begin travelling down the mountain to attack her. Watching Asuna's health bar fall down to dangerous levels, Mito panics and leaves their formed party.

Kirito enters the cave and insists that she go to the nearest town and recuperate her health before she is killed, to which she refuses and suddenly collapses from exhaustion. She awakens outside of it, having been dragged out by Kirito, who requests that she join him in town for a group meeting on preparation for defeating the first floor boss.\nThe two arrive in town and attend the meeting organized by the player Diabel, who announces to the attendants that they will all form multiple sets of parties and strategize in order to defeat the floor boss, Illfang the Kobold Lord, tomorrow morning. Asuna notices that Mito is one of the players in attendance but fails to interact with her as she feels betrayed because she left her to die. Later that night, Kirito gives Asuna a new sword and the two practice their fighting strategy. During this, Asuna asks Kirito if beta testers are bad people as she explains to him that she was deserted by one as she was just about to die. Kirito goes on to explain that he had a previous similar experience and feels that she was simply scared to lose her own life and chose to save herself in the moment, which gives Asuna some relief on the matter.\nThe next day, Kirito, Asuna, Mito, Diabel and the remaining group of party members arrive at the boss room and battle Illfang and his minion sentinels. When Illfang's health becomes low, Diabel goes for the finishing attack, but before he can see Illfang's true weapon, he is mortally wounded by its onslaught. With his dying breath, Diabel tells Kirito to defeat the boss and save the players at all costs. With the assistance of Asuna and Mito, Kirito successfully defeats Illfang, but after the victory, the other players immediately accuse Kirito of letting Diabel die by having previous knowledge about Illfang he did not share with the players and they proceed to label him a \"beater\", a combination of the words \"beta-tester\" and \"cheater\". Kirito accepts this title and claims the prize for defeating Illfang: a black leather trench coat.

With no one able to stop the Miscreants, normal people are usually left living in fear of being attacked by them. After a Miscreant kills her geneticist parents on their way home from work, Emily Stanton becomes determined to find a way to stop Miscreants.\nBy 1985, Emily has sacrificed much of her social life in favor of researching possible methods of fighting back against Miscreants. While this results in her being bullied, Lydia Berman stands up for her and becomes her best and only friend. Lydia supports Emily's dream of giving superpowers to normal people, though she tries to make sure that Emily does not overwork herself. When Lydia convinces Emily to take a half-hour nap from studying in 1993, she accidentally causes Emily to oversleep and wake up late for an AP exam, straining their relationship and causing them to drift apart.\nIn 2024, Emily and Lydia have gone their separate ways, with Emily becoming a successful scientist and researcher for her own company and Lydia becoming a longshoreman. Lydia tries to reconnect with Emily when their high school reunion comes around and invites her to come. When she fails to show up on the night of the reunion, Lydia concludes that Emily is still uncomfortable attending parties by herself and goes to pick her up. Emily tells her that while she would have liked to go to the reunion, she had forgotten when the reunion was and had a project she had to work on that night, which Emily wants to show to Lydia. Unfortunately, Lydia accidentally injects herself with a serum Emily had been working on.\nHaving been injected with the serum, Lydia learns from Emily that the serum was designed to give a normal person superhuman strength and that she would have to undergo special training and treatment so the serum does not kill her. Emily also joins Lydia in the treatment, although a less painful one since Emily took the serum in a pill form to take the other superpower concocted, invisibility. During the thirty-three day treatment and training, Lydia and Emily grow closer. Lydia discovers that in the years since their high school graduation, Emily had a daughter, Tracy, with one of the researchers, who could not handle the responsibility and left them.\nOnce they finish their training and treatment, Emily and Lydia foil a liquor store robbery run by a Miscreant with crab arms known as the Crab, who falls in love with an equally smitten Lydia, much to Emily's concern. Emily and Lydia, known as the superhero team Thunder Force, are praised for their heroics. This brings Thunder Force to the attention of mayoral candidate William \"The King\" Stevens, whose campaign is built on the idea that only he can end the Miscreants' crimes.\nWith the help of Laser, a Miscreant who can generate and control whip-like energy beams, the King tries to get Thunder Force to work for him, leaving Chicago at the mercy of the Miscreants unless he wins the mayoral election. Thunder Force continues to fight crime with their superpowers and support the rival mayoral candidate, thereby causing the King to lose the election. The King then sends Laser to attack Thunder Force when they're at a diner. When she tries to get away, Lydia throws a bus at her despite Emily's protests. Though nobody was hurt, Emily decides that Lydia's impulsiveness is more problematic than beneficial, once again straining their friendship.\nIn an effort to make amends, Lydia goes on a date with the Crab to get some useful information. Along with how the Crab is a misunderstood person who had to turn to a life of crime, Lydia learns that the King is planning on blowing up everyone who did not vote for him in the election, along with the new mayor, at a party he's hosting under the guise of a celebration of the new mayor. She tells Emily of what she learned and makes amends with her.\nAfter fighting off Laser one last time, Thunder Force go to stop the King from bombing the building. When they manage to find the bomb, the King decides to fight Thunder Force himself, revealing himself to be a Miscreant with superhuman strength, though significantly stronger than Lydia. Before the King can kill Lydia, the Crab double crosses the King and gets his claws broken off. Tracy also joins the fight, having injected herself with her mother's serum, giving her the ability to run at superhuman speed. Though they manage to take the King down, Thunder Force realizes that the bomb will go off before they can disarm it.\nWith no guarantee that the bomb would be stable enough to not go off while Tracy carries the bomb to somewhere safe, Lydia decides to sacrifice herself, knowing that she can at least reduce the impact of the explosion. She jumps out the building with the bomb and dives into the Chicago River, seemingly dying in the explosion. However, the paramedics manage to find her body and resuscitate her.

They announce that in November 2048, aliens called White Spikes appear in Russia and wipe out most humans within a span of three years. The world of the present-day sends their militaries into the future through the JumpLink, a rudimentary wormhole device. This prompts an international draft, but only around 30% survive their seven-day deployment. Dan eventually receives a draft notice.\nThe draftees are sent forward in time to a battlefield in Miami Beach, however, due to a malfunction, they are dropped hundreds of feet in the air and most fall to their deaths, while a small group lands safely in a pool.

Dan survives the firebombing with two fellow draftees, a scientist named Charlie and Dorian, who is on his third deployment. \nDan awakens in a forward operating base in Puerto Plata overseen by his daughter Colonel Muri Forester. She tells him there is a toxin that kills male White Spikes, but not the female queens, and asks for his help in capturing a female White Spike to refine the toxin to be fatal to them. She also tells Dan that in the past, he became disillusioned after failing to get his research job. It led him to divorce his wife, Emmy. He subsequently died in a car crash when Muri was sixteen.\nThey capture a female White Spike but are attacked by hundreds of males and narrowly escape. They then travel to DEEPSWELL-9, a fortified offshore oil platform 25 miles east of Port Nelson, where the JumpLink facility is located. Muri succeeds in developing a toxin lethal to female White Spikes. However it cannot be mass-produced in that time period, so she asks Dan to take it into the past to produce it there and prevent the war. The base is quickly overrun by male white spikes in a coordinated effort to protect their queen, killing Muri. Getting away from them, Dan returns to the past. Contact is subsequently lost with the future, indicating that the JumpLink was destroyed and the future war has been lost, leading to worldwide mass panic.\nDan and Emmy later deduce that the White Spikes arrived on Earth earlier than 2048 as there was never a record of their ship arriving.

They determine that the White Spikes have been on Earth at least since the \"Millennium Eruption\" in 946 AD. \nDan leads a mission to Russia with Charlie, Dorian, the stranded future soldiers, and his estranged father James, a Vietnam veteran. They find the alien ship frozen in ice beneath the Academy of Sciences Glacier, and surmise that global warming freed them in the future. Additionally, the frozen bodies of a reptilian-like alien species are also found on board, causing the group to deduce that the ship had crash landed on Earth, and that the White Spikes were engineered to help wipe out the native population of a planet in order to allow them to colonize. They then inject the lethal toxin into several White Spikes who have been in a state of hypersleep. This awakens the rest of the colony, who begin to attack. After awakening, the queen White Spike escapes.\nDorian, terminally ill with cancer, stays behind and blows up the ship while Dan and James pursue the queen.

As a publicity stunt for creating sympathy, Rayappan orders his men to help the woman by lending their dhotis. The woman gives birth to a boy, whom Rayappan christens as Singaravelan, or \"Singam\" on the stage. Singam grows up as an orphan as his mother had died shortly after the birth of his younger sister, Manimegalai, followed by the death of his father due to overdrinking. Singam's relationship with Manimegalai is quite fraught and strained as the former blames her for their parents death and the latter disapproves of the former's obsession towards Rayappan, for whom he even sold her mother's only nosepiece for party promotions. This led them to not be on talking terms for 20 years.\nIn 2021, Rayappan, now a powerful and influential politician, begins scouting for a suitable candidate to work as a councillor for J.K. Nagar. Vying for attention, Singam strives to seek Rayappan's consideration by performing a media stunt by drinking poison in front of press during Rayappan's arrest and gains his trust, much to the irritation and dismay of Mangalam, Rayappan's right-hand man, who is also vying for the position. Singam manages to emerge as Rayappan's favorite within a short span of time by employing hilarious techniques and his friend Vasu's ideas. Frustrated at being sidelined, an infuriated Mangalam brandishes a bottle at Singam's head; he is subsequently expelled from the ruling party for his ruthless behavior.\nShortly after the incident, Singam develops an alter ego, presumably from his injuries who does quite the opposite of Singam's doings. The next day he gets nominated for the counsellor chair, but beforehand, Rayappan asks for 50 lakhs as a deposit for his post, which he got from duping Kamatchi, a wealthy daughter of a moneylending businessman who Singam initially kidnapped with Vasu as a pawn for extorting money from her father with the help of Vasu's hired goons, only to be saved by his alter ego who first resurfaces by thrashing the goons and saving her. During elections, both Singam and Mangalam try various corrupt tricks to lure the voters and increase their vote bank.

Now begins the cat and mouse game between Singam and vigilante Singam who flunks out what corrupt Singam's plans to do using various tactics and even causes a distrust with Vasu, who leaves him after seeing his evil intentions and Rayappan questioning his loyalty.\nFinally, after getting convinced by the evidence found against Singam, Rayappan deduces that Singam is the masked vigilante who has conked all his wrongdoings and orders his henchmen to abduct him, only to be caught red-handed by the income tax department while exchanging money due to the intelligence of the vigilante Singam.

The woman is hanged from a tree and ultimately set on fire. Before she dies, however, her ash is kept in a kern doll, indicating the doll has been possessed by Mary's spirit.\nIn the present day, disgraced journalist Gerry Fenn works a job reporting on all things strange and unusual. His latest assignment takes him to Boston, where the purported strange activity is revealed to be a teenage prank. As he is preparing to leave, he discovers the doll and purposely crushes it, accidentally freeing Mary's spirit. Gerry later gets into an accident as he is driving away after seeing a young girl, Alice Pagett, run across the road. He follows Alice to the tree where Mary was hanged, the site where he found the doll, and hears her speak before collapsing. When he takes her to a nearby church, he learns that Alice is deaf and mute. Gerry decides to stay in town to investigate what he thinks could be a real story of the supernatural.\nThe following day, Alice stuns the community by speaking, proclaiming that she has been cured by the Virgin Mary. This launches a media furore that is further propelled by other seemingly miraculous healings. During one of the healings, a statue of the Virgin Mary near the chancel of the church cries tears of blood. The Catholic Church sends Monsignor Delgarde to investigate the claims, assisted by Bishop Gyles. Gerry befriends Alice, who tells him that while she has been speaking to an entity named Mary, she has only assumed that it was the Virgin Mary. Beginning to suspect that something sinister is occurring due to visions of \"Mary\" as a horrific creature, Gerry finds a partner in Father William Hagan, Alice's maternal uncle, whom she healed, but also suspects the healings' true nature. Hagan discovers a book detailing Mary Elnor, who performed miracles for Satan, but before he has the chance to warn anybody Elnor attacks him and his body is found hanging in the church. Gyles convinces Gerry to keep the apparent suicide of Hagan quiet as it will tarnish the divine occurrences; Hagan's death is declared an accident.\nGerry befriends Natalie Gates, the town's physician, and reveals that he was found fabricating stories which is why he now reports hoax stories, hoping this event will relaunch his career. The pair eventually comes across the information Hagan discovered, revealing Elnor sold her soul to Satan in order to gain power. Satan would allow her and her descendants (one of whom being Alice) to perform \"miracles\" prompting people to pledge themselves to her, and in turn, Satan. Elnor tries to kill Gerry, but Delgarde drives her away with prayer and a crucifix. Gerry and Delgarde are shocked to learn that Gyles was aware of the history in Banfield involving Elnor, but thought that it was not connected to the miracles that were recently occurring. He warns Gerry that any attempt to share his views on the situation will fall on deaf ears due to Gerry\u2019s tarnished reputation.\nAlice, who they believe is unaware of Mary's true nature, wishes to hold a church service by the tree and broadcast it to the masses. Delgarde warns that those pledging themselves to Elnor would make her stronger and condemn their soul to Hell. Gerry, Natalie and Delgarde try to perform a ritual in the church to stop this, but Elnor appears and crushes Delgarde with a burning cross.\nOnce the service begins, Alice urges everyone to pledge themselves to Mary three times. Gerry manages to stop the crowd from fully pledging by claiming that the miracles were just more of his hoaxes, that they were all a result of the placebo effect. Natalie communicates with Alice using sign language, urging her to stop the service. Mary speaks to Alice, entreating her to continue it or never speak again. Realizing Mary's true nature, Alice confirms that the miracles were not of God. The tree suddenly bursts into flames, causing all the attendants to flee in panic as an angry Mary emerges from it. She incinerates Gyles before attempting to kill Gerry, but Alice sacrifices herself to save his life. This causes Mary to disappear, as Alice was her link to the living world.

She tells Putt who looks and sees the girl with the black face standing in the room, now with a hole directly through her head. Pim tries to convince Putt to go next door to help her but he refuses, adamant that the girl is a ghost. Pim looks again and sees the girl with the black face holding an infant in her arms that she then vomits black onto. She pulls back and tells Putt to stay away, now convinced that whatever they're seeing isn't real.\nThat evening, Latte reappears and Pim finds the video of herself showering on Fame's phone. Later, Putt wakes up in the middle of the night to a scraping noise. He sees a girl in a nightgown sitting on Pim's bed, stroking her face. He screams, waking Pim, and they argue over what he saw. A pair of bare feet in a nightgown are shown outside their door. Putt wakes up with a nosebleed, feeling sick. Pim gets their grandmother against Putt's wishes. A newspaper headline reveals that Chaiyut, the tycoon's son, has \"walked free\" after his friend confessed to being the driver during the hit and run. Phong breaks down by his daughter's hospital bed and swears he'll hunt him down. At home Wan brings Putt some milk and he asks her about what his mother was like as a child. Wan says she was a popular, perfect girl, just like Pim. Wan implies something happened that drove Mai apart from them, but refuses to say what, instead asking to see Putt's sketchbook. Inside she sees a drawing of a girl with a spiral hole in her head and gets angry, while Putt denies he drew it. She has a moment of vagueness before telling Putt to drink the milk she brought and leaving. When Putt looks at the sketchbook again the drawing is gone. He knocks over the glass of milk in the process, and Latte drinks it from the floor. \nIt's announced that Pim was chosen to be head cheerleader again, despite two other girls being nominated. She confronts her friend Paew, who was also one of the ones nominated, having discovered text messages on Fame's phone that revealed Paew was the one who took the video and tried to get Fame to spread it around after having sex with him. Paew says that everyone hates her for being \"perfect\" and stuck up, and that she sent out the video earlier that day. The coach reveals she knew about the video and has proof enough to get Paew in serious trouble. When Pim gets home she finds Putt is getting sicker, and coughing up blood. She calls her grandfather who is shown to be crashing a party for Chaiyut. More banging from the hole wakes them up that night. Pim looks through it as Putt is too sick, and sees the black faced girl crawling through blood. A normal looking man is shown to be asleep on the couch next to empty bottles. They start to theorize that the black faced girl is trying to tell them how she died. Putt observes that the house looks exactly like their grandparents', pointing out the place on the wall where a clock used to be. In the house across the hall, a clock is hung in the same place. Putt tells Pim about wormholes, theorizing that the hole in the wall is showing them a different time or dimension. Their grandfather gets home, and they ask him about the house next door, and if a girl died there. He gets angry and says the house has been abandoned for a long time, and that there was never any dead girl. He moves a bookcase to hide the spot where they say the hole is. \nPhong goes upstairs and retrieves his old uniform and service revolver from his closet. The bookshelf in front of the hole falls over, summoning Pim, Putt, and their grandmother. Meanwhile Chiayut is shown drinking and driving once more, bragging to his friend about his father owning the police. In a tunnel he almost collides with a parked car. Phong gets out and approaches, in uniform. Chiayut attempts to bribe him, then pulls a gun before being slammed into the steering wheel and beaten by Phong, who then pours the remains of the liquor over him and lights him on fire. At the hospital, Mai wakes up and asks for her children. The doctors attempt to call Phong but cannot get through. Mai panics when she's told her children are with their grandparents. Pim and Putt tell their grandmother to go back to bed while they finish cleaning up. The scratching noise from the hole stops her, revealing she has heard it for 15 years though she has never looked through the hole. She reveals she lied to keep their grandfather from getting angry with her, and that he's been making her take the pills to keep her complacent. She begs Pim not to look, but is ignored. Pim sees the house, no longer decayed but fully furnished, and sees a young mother holding her infant child, and a man asleep on the couch. The mother wakes up the man, who she calls Krit, and asks him where Pinya is. A younger version of Wan and Phong, who is in his uniform, come into view, talking to the woman who is revealed to be Mai. \nPim tells the others what she saw and asks who Pinya is. Putt looks through the hole and sees Phong holding the bloody body of a young girl as Mai sobs. Wan pulls him away from the hole as he demands to know if the man on the couch is his father. A gunshot is heard. \nPhong arrives at the hospital to find Mai missing from her bed. Wan explains that Phong and her had gone out with Mai, leaving Pinya with her father, Krit, resulting in Pinya's death. A flashback shows Krit painting and drinking heavily, as Pinya shown to have a heavily swollen face, asks to play a hide and seek. She gets into the closet, accidentally locking herself inside where she found and drank a bottle of rat poison. Wan claimed Pinya was never \"right in the head\", and must've thought the poison was syrup. Another flashback shows Krit dead on the floor from a gunshot wound to the head, which Phong says was suicide from guilt.\nIn the present day, Putt vomits blood onto the table. Pim wants to take him to a doctor but Wan says she's overreacting and takes Putt to bed. \nMai arrives in a taxi at the house, and discovers a dead Latte in the garbage. Inside, Wan tries to force Putt to drink milk, calling him \"Pinya\" as she does. Mai's arrival stops her. \nShe is overjoyed to see Mai, who spurns her and tries to take her kids and run, but is stopped by Phong, brandishing his gun. Mai confronts him, claiming he had something to do with Krit's death, which he reacts to guiltily, but puts the gun away. \nPutt continues to get sick, prompting Pim to tell Mai about the milk, connecting his illness to what she saw of Pinya. She goes to drink the milk herself, as Wan screams at her to stop, but it is launched out of her hand by an unseen force. \nFlashbacks show Wan treating Pinya cruelly due to her different face, before cooing over Pim for being a pretty baby. \nMai confronts her mother about poisoning Putt and Pinya. Phong argues that she would never do such a thing and blames everything on Krit, which Mai refutes. \nWan finally snaps, blaming Mai for marrying a lowlife like Krit and calling Pinya and Putt freaks, and that she was doing Mai a favor by \"cleansing\" things. \nShe takes her kids and leaves. Pim looks back to see the hole still there, and as Wan collapses, sobbing, Pinya is shown to be on the other side. \nBack at their real home, Mai tells Putt and Pim about Pinya, and their father who was an artist like Putt. She told Pim that Pinya would sing her to sleep, a tune that Pim still knows. \nPim then asks if Mai is sure they know the whole truth. Putt agrees and asks Mai to be honest with them about their father. They mention the hole, which Mai can also see. It showed up after Krit died, and never went away, even when their grandfather tried to cover it. Mai never looked through it. \nWan wakes up in the night from the scratching noise. She yells, waking up Phong who still cannot hear it. \nPhong receives a phone call from his old employee who tells him about Chaiyut, and asks his whereabouts. He then informs Phong that they retrieved evidence proving Chaiyut wasn't driving after all, making his murder meaningless. \nDownstairs, Wan opens the closet to find Pinya's ghost, who hugs her and vomits blood. Phong comes downstairs to find Wan thrashing on the floor, and sees a bottle of rat poison in her hand. As Wan continues to convulse, Phong sees the burning ghost of Chaiyut. He shoots at the ghost in fear, hitting Wan instead and killing her. He then turns the gun on himself and fires through his mouth, creating the very hole in the wall that he could never see. \nA flashback shows Mai looking through the hole, watching as Pinya hides in the closet, and Wan from the past, noticing the door is left ajar, closes and bolts it. \nAnother flashback reveals Mai was the one to shoot Krit, furious at him for letting their child die. Phong helps her cover up the murder as a suicide. \nWe see present day Mai putting on lipstick and smiling.

The cub falls into her hands when a bald eagle knocks it out of the nest it fell into during the crash.

The lion cub and the wolf pup live like brothers; they play together and both are kept well-fed thanks to the she-wolf.\nWhile Alma is off on a 2-day trip involving a classical music audition for the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, the wolf mother disappears.

This leaves Alma the only one available to raise and protect the cubs while the three of them live in peace for a year or two.

In the wood, Rita sits the baby on the ground and lights a ring of fire around her. She watches as the baby screams.\nIn the present day, the teenage Char lives with her mother and grandmother; her uncle Aaron lives nearby and visits occasionally. The household is somewhat dysfunctional; Rita is in poor health, Angela is depressed and spends much of her time in bed, and there is no food in the house. Char attends a girls\u2019 Catholic high school. Although academically gifted, she does not fit in with the other students, who consider her their social inferior, and she is subjected to bullying. One morning, driving Char to school, Angela tells her daughter that \"she can't do this anymore\". Her car is later found abandoned, with no sign of Angela. The family report the disappearance to the police, but they are not able to offer much help. However Angela returns within a few days, strangely altered. Her depression is gone, and she is cheerful, dressing up and cooking dinner for the family. Rita seems suspicious of these changes in Angela and deliberately upsets the pan of soup that Angela had prepared, so the family are obliged to eat the chips that Aaron has brought over instead.  But Angela appears to have little appetite and sits staring sullenly at her mother.\nChar witnesses several instances of increasingly bizarre behaviour in the \"new\" Angela and becomes frightened. Her uncle Aaron is poisoned by Angela, which leads to him being hospitalised. In the meantime Char is forging a friendship with one of her former bullies, Suzanne. Char confides in Suzanne about the changes in Angela; Suzanne in turn tells Char how her own mother died when she was very young. One evening Rita tells Char the story of her past; when Char was a baby, Rita realised she had been swapped with a \u201cchangeling\u201d. The only way to get the real Char back was to place her near fire, hence the fiery ring ritual in the woods.  This worked, but Char sustained a small burn to her cheek. Her family told her the resultant scar was a birthmark.\nRita tells Char that the \"new\" Angela is also a changeling, and thus the fire ritual must be repeated to get the real Angela back. Although Char appears to agree, when she sees Angela bound and gagged and tied to a bed she is appalled. Despite her grandmother\u2019s protests, Char frees Angela, only to realise too late that Rita spoke the truth, and that this is not the \"real\" Angela. The changeling kills Rita. Char runs out of the house, but is waylaid by the school bullies, who force her inside an unlit Halloween bonfire. However the bullies are scared off by the approach of the changeling Angela. Angela pushes her way into the bonfire to get to Char, but Char sets the structure alight. Angela burns while Char is rescued from the flames by Suzanne. In the final scene, Angela is restored to her true self, and Char makes her a lucky token from twigs \"to keep her safe\", as her grandmother had once made for her.

Aagam Reddy misleads them by taking them to Veera Reddy, Bhooma's arch-rival. Veera commands his men to attack them but the three of them escape. Mario warns Kalyan about Veera but Nandini lies that Veera was playing a prank on them. This allays everyone's fears, but Mario remains suspicious. Mario overhears many of the villagers discussing the fate of Kalyan would be like a Veera's sacrificial goat. Despite multiple warnings, Kalyan doesn't believe Mario.\nMeanwhile, Bhadram's condition begins to worsen as he transforms into a zombie. He bites a household maid, who in turn bites a laborer, spreading the zombie virus, even further. Mario, on the other hand, is suspicious of Nandini but Mario is caught red-handed as he accidentally films when Nandini was changing her dress. Bhooma forgives Mario with a warning and an upset Kalyan accuses Mario of sabotaging his wedding. Kalyan gives him the fixed code and asks him to leave but Mario asks for forgiveness, and the two playfully prank each other.

Mario wakes from his stupor and witnesses Veera's men kidnapping Kalyan. Mario finds Nandini and the two begin to quarrel until they both witness a zombie attack on one of Bhooma's workers. As the entire household has succumbed and become zombies, they lock themselves in the house along with Maggie and Kasi Reddy.

They avoid being captured by hiding in the wardrobe. As they free up Kalyan and are about to leave, they find a woman bound and gagged who reveals herself as the real Nandini Reddy who was captured by Veera on her way to the wedding.

As Bhooma's brother eloped just before the wedding, Talambari went mad. As Veera plans to get his vengeance by killing Kalyan and making Bhooma's daughter a widow, Mario intervenes and says that Veera should be taking revenge not on Kalyan, but on Bhooma's eloped brother.

A horde of zombies led by a zombified Bhadram attacks Maggie who is turned into a zombie.\nMario, Sailaja, and Kalyan flee once again.

Following a path in the woods, they reach the old man's house and find the original zombie, trapped in a glass cage along with the hidden lab. They confront the old man and demand the truth. He reveals that he was once a world-famous virologist but the government banned him, citing his practices as unethical and inhumane. Desperate to recover his former reputation, he began developing a cure for the coronavirus and tested it directly on humans. The zombie virus came from a failed vaccine. The old man claims that he has found a cure for both viruses and gives Mario a video camera. Before he can tell them about the cure, the caged zombie breaks free and begins attacking the old man. The trio escape and are picked up by Bhooma. Mario goes over the footage in the video camera and finds a symbol from the village's temple.\nOn their way to the temple, Sailaja is scratched by a zombie. She asks Mario to leave her behind, but Mario takes her into the temple and bars the doors. While searching for the symbol, they come upon Veera. When a joyful Sailaja runs to her father, an angry Bhooma confronts Veera for plotting against him. Veer accuses him of the same, saying that he secretly brought his brother's son to the wedding. Bhooma is shocked to know that Mario is Pratap's son and says that Pratap disgraced him and the family by leaving a girl at the altar. Mario admits what his father did was wrong but also confronts Bhooma and Veera on their mistakes. Bhooma and Veera realize their mistake and join hands to hold off the zombie while the others continue looking for the symbol.\nSailaja now turns into a zombie and attacks Mario. Mario pushes Sailaja and falls at the base of the Shiva lingam as the water from the spring falls into her mouth. An amazed Mario watches as the water begins to heal Sailaja, and she reverts to her normal self. Mario blows a conch, summoning all the zombies in the nearby countryside to the temple. As the zombies chase him, Mario jumps into the spring-fed pond. As the zombies follow him into the water, they are cured. Mario is hailed as a hero for stopping the virus as both the families, along with a cured Maggie and Bhadram joyfully re-unite.", "tmdb_id": 773303}}
