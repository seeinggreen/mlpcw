[{"title": "Tell Your Children", "genres": ["Drama"], "wiki_plot": "Mae Coleman and Jack Perry are a cohabitating couple who sell marijuana. The unscrupulous Jack sells the drug to teenagers over Mae's objections; she'd rather stick to an adult clientele. Ralph Wiley, a sociopathic college dropout turned dealer, and siren Blanche help Jack recruit new customers. Ralph and Jack lure high school student Bill Harper and college student Jimmy Lane to Mae and Jack's apartment. Jimmy takes Bill to a party where Jack runs out of reefer, and Jimmy, who has a car, drives him to pick up more. When they get to Jack's boss' \"headquarters\", Jimmy asks for a cigarette as Jack gets out and he gives him a joint. By the time Jack returns, Jimmy is unknowingly high; he drives away recklessly and hits a pedestrian. A few days later, Jack tells Jimmy that the man died of his injuries and agrees to keep Jimmy's name out of the case -- if Jimmy will agree to \"forget he was ever in Mae's apartment.\" As the police did not have enough specific details to track Jimmy down, he indeed escapes punishment.\n\nBill, whose once-pristine record at school has rapidly declined, has a fling with Blanche while high. Mary, Jimmy's sister and Bill's girlfriend, goes to Mae's apartment looking for Jimmy and accepts a joint from Ralph, thinking it's a regular cigarette. When she refuses Ralph's advances, he tries to rape her. Bill comes out of the bedroom and, still high, hallucinates that Mary is willingly offering herself to Ralph and attacks the latter. As the two are fighting, Jack knocks Bill unconscious with the butt of his gun, which inadvertently fires, killing Mary. Jack puts the gun in Bill's hand, framing him for Mary's death by claiming he blacked out. The dealers lie low for a while in Blanche's apartment while Bill's trial takes place. Over the objections of a skeptical juror, Bill is found guilty.\nBy now Ralph is paranoid from both marijuana and his guilty conscience. Blanche is also high; at one memorable point she plays the piano more and more rapidly as Ralph eggs her on. The boss tells Jack to shoot Ralph to prevent him from confessing, but when Jack arrives, Ralph immediately recognizes the threat and beats him to death with a stick as Blanche laughs uncontrollably in terror. The police arrest Ralph, Mae, and Blanche. Mae's confession leads to the boss and other gang members also being arrested. Blanche explains that Bill was innocent and agrees to serve as a material witness for the case against Ralph, but instead, she jumps out of a window and falls to her death, traumatized by her own adultery and its role in Mary's death. Bill's conviction is overturned, and Ralph, now nearly catatonic, is sent to an asylum for the criminally insane for the rest of his natural life.\nThe film's story is told in bracketing sequences, at a lecture given at a PTA meeting by high school principal Dr. Alfred Carroll.

His lawyer and co-conspirator, Jim Frazier, asks him to take the blame for the robbery and in exchange, he will keep Rocky's share of the robbery ($100,000) safe until the day he is released. Rocky agrees and is sentenced to three years in prison.\nAfter serving his sentence, Rocky returns to his old neighborhood and visits Jerry, who is now a Catholic priest. Jerry advises Rocky to get a place \"in the old parish\", so Rocky rents a room in a boarding house run by Laury Martin, a girl he bullied in school. He then pays a visit to Frazier's casino. Frazier claims to have been unaware of Rocky's release, but he promises to have the $100,000 ready by the end of the week, and he gives Rocky $500 spending money.\nAfter leaving Frazier's casino, Rocky has his pocket picked by a gang of young toughs: Soapy, Swing, Bim, Pasty, Crab, and Hunky. After Rocky tracks them down (they are in his old childhood hideout) and proves to them he is no sucker, the tough kids admit to an admiration of Rocky's reputation and criminal lifestyle. After retrieving his wallet and all the money therein, Rocky invites them to dinner. While they are eating, Jerry arrives and asks the gang why they have not been playing basketball. With Rocky's help, he convinces them to play against another team. At the match, the kids are very disorganized and fighting with the other team. Rocky asks Jerry if he can take over as referee. He takes the boys to task and they start to follow the rules. As Jerry and Laury watch on from the sidelines, Laury expresses her concern over the potential negative influence Rocky may be having on the gang, this is echoed by Jerry.\nLater, while walking home, Frazier's hit squad makes an attempt on Rocky's life. Rocky easily spots his tail and outwits the mobsters's attempted hit. In retaliation, he kidnaps Frazier, raiding his house at gunpoint and stealing $2,000 and a ledger. Rocky then brazenly approaches Frazier's business partner, Mac Keefer and requests $100,000 in trade for Frazier's release. With no other option Mac agrees and pays Rocky but as Rocky leaves, he informs on him to the police. Rocky is arrested and sets about mocking the police for their lack of evidence, even goading them to ring his lawyer (Frazier).\nFrazier approaches Mac and learns of Rocky's arrest. He informs Mac that Rocky is in possession of the ledger. This forces Frazier to tell the police it was all a \"misunderstanding\", and Rocky is released. Jerry learns of the kidnapping, and decides to go to the press to expose corruption in New York. Rocky tries unsuccessfully to stop Jerry as he knows the other mobsters won't take kindly to what the priest is trying to do.\nOn the radio, Jerry denounces the corruption, as well as Rocky, Frazier and Keefer. Frazier and Keefer assure Rocky that no harm will come to Jerry, but he later overhears them renege on their earlier promise and also discovers that they plan to kill both Rocky and Jerry. To protect his friend, Rocky kills Frazier and Keefer instead and after escaping the casino, makes his way to an abandoned warehouse where he is forced to kill a police officer. A standoff ensues with other police.\nJerry arrives and informs the police that he can reason with Rocky and get him to surrender peacefully. The police reluctantly agree to let the priest go into the warehouse. Jerry sees a trapped Rocky and implores him to surrender peacefully, telling him the entire building is surrounded, but Rocky takes Jerry hostage. While trying to escape, Rocky is shot in the leg and caught. After standing trial, he is sentenced to death.\nIn Rocky's last few hours before this execution, Jerry visits with his old friend. He sees the negative impact Rocky could have on the Dead End Kids. Rocky informs Jerry that he intends to die proud and 'spitting in their eyes'. Jerry pleads with Rocky to look at the negative influence he has had on Soapy and the gang.

Jerry begs Rocky to be braver and save Soapy from going down the same route he has gone himself. Rocky refuses, telling Jerry that his reputation is all that he has left.\nJerry walks with Rocky as he is being led to his execution. He implores his friend one last time but is gruffly rebuffed. As they enter the execution room, Rocky stoically shakes Jerry's hand and wishes him well before walking to the electric chair. Then out of nowhere Rocky seems to break down begging and screaming for mercy. Rocky begins whimpering like a coward and this requires the guards to subdue him and forcefully drag him to the chair. Rocky seemingly dies a coward's death. Later, Soapy and the gang read in the newspapers of how Rocky \"turned yellow\" in the face of his execution and they refuse to believe it. Jerry comes in and Soapy asks if it is true that Rocky had died a coward, and Jerry affirms that it is true.

The king thinks he is holding out for a bigger payday and offers him increasingly vast riches and then (at her suggestion) the hand of his only daughter, Princess Minnie, in marriage if he can kill, or at least subdue, the giant.

She asks her two housemaids (Patsy Kelly and Mabel Todd) if she can go along with them on a blind date with some cowboys from a visiting rodeo. The two maids reluctantly agree. Feeling sorry for the inexperienced Mary, they coach her on their three-step \"system\" for getting a man interested: flatter him, get him talking about himself, and play on his sympathy with a hard-luck story.\nAfter the rodeo, the three women meet up with their dates at the Rodeo Cafeteria and pair off.

Brand is ordered to send up tomorrow what amounts to a suicide mission. Captain Courtney (Errol Flynn), leader of A Flight, and his good friend \"Scotty\" Scott (David Niven) return but two of the replacements are not so lucky and another, Hollister, is severely depressed by having witnessed the death of his best friend. The survivors repair to the bar in their mess for drinks and fatalistic revelry. Courtney does his best to console Hollister but the youngster breaks down in grief.\nWhen Brand announces the next day's dawn patrol, Courtney tells Brand he does not have enough men.

A reporter publishes his story, and soon everyone is being extra generous to anybody who looks down on his luck.\nMeanwhile, Tony encounters a mischievous chimpanzee named Darwin. Jean Hofmann, a performer at the Circus Primerose, enlists Tony to capture Darwin. The chimp indulges in a favorite pastime, setting off a fire alarm.

The police round up all the tramps in town for Louie to look over.\nTony and Jean start falling in love, but to stop Max, the jealous son of the proprietor, from getting Tony fired, Jean lies (so she thinks) and tells him she is being friendly to Tony only because he is the millionaire. Unfortunately, Tony overhears her.\nTo save himself from a possible charge of murder, Louie identifies a tramp at random as the millionaire: Kopelpeck. Disillusioned, Tony decides to end the charade and expose the imposter, but no one will believe him. In fact, he is thrown in jail for making a nuisance of himself. Jean bails him out. Then Tony discovers that Jean does not believe he is the millionaire. His identity is finally confirmed by the captain of his yacht and others.

A swordfish comes along and cuts a hole in the bottom of the boat and all of Porky's goods fall to the bottom of the ocean! As Porky falls out too, the swordfish pushes him back into the boat and closes up the hole. The swordfish unscrews his \"sword\" from his face, and gives it to a nearby fish to stand guard (ensuring Porky doesn't try to open the hole again).\nOut of the sinking goods falls a lunchbox and when it hits bottom, opens up to form a canteen where a fish inside wearing a chef's hat is flipping burgers. A group of seahorses see a record player and as it starts playing, they swim onto the rotating record and form a merry-go-round. Smaller fish jump on their backs, imitating children on a ride. A fish swallows a teapot which whistles a tune while emitting steam and the opening and closing of the lid. Another fish swallows a clock with a moving pendulum and happily rubs his stomach. Then the pendulum starts swinging again from inside his stomach, much to his surprise, as he starts to walk away, his hips swaying from side to side. A different fish passes by making Hugh Herbert's noises (Woo-woo!) and drags a sign saying \"FOO\".\nAs Porky lifts the hole cover to see what was happening (note, it opens inward now instead of outward, as before), he gets water squirted in his face by the sentry fish. Another fish swallows a radio and begins walking. As he walks, tuning sounds are made before the radio announcer (Mel Blanc) is speaking, the fish looks around for someone speaking and does not realize the sound is coming from inside his stomach. The announcer describes how two giant bombers dropped a bomb on a small village, (Owasegoo - it sounds like gibberish, as it was apparently dubbed over after the cartoon's release), and the fish goes through all the motions of the bombing and gunfire sounds. As the shelling comes to a stop, the fish wipes sweat from his brow, only to have a program called \"Gangster Busters\" (a parody of Gang Busters) began playing including the sounds of police sirens and rapid-fire gunplay, and goes through all the motions again until he is bounced off the ocean floor which causes the radio to be up-chucked.\nBowls and boxes are the next to follow, forming a hotel with a ballroom inside.  Two electric eels swim by and form the marquee \"Holly\" and \"wood\" above the entrance and begin blinking on and off.  Two other fish enter with flashlights on forming spotlights, as seen in front of hotels and theaters with big events and movie premiers in Hollywood that were common at the time.  Two other fish have bowler hats drop on them, and as they turn toward the camera, acquire a likeness of Laurel and Hardy, and they swim into the Hotel.  Another fish steps into some large shoes, and impersonates a Greta Garbo character and she says, \"I want to be alone\", a line in the 1932 classic Garbo movie \"Grand Hotel\".  Another fish swallows an hourglass giving her a shape similar to that of Mae West, complete with jewels and parasol, and utters, \"come up and see me sometime\" as she struts into the Hollywood Legion Stadium to watch a boxing match between Gene Tuna (a play on the American Boxer Gene Tunney) versus the Champion.  The two boxing fish were duking it out on the keys of a typewriter in the stadium, and as the carriage comes to the end of the line, the typewriter's ding is heard, and each fish backs into his own corner, and another fish pushes the carriage back to the beginning of a new line.  The keys spell out what is happening in the fight.\nBack to Porky, he's now frowning because all of his goods have been lost, and puts a worm on a hook and lowers it into the water.  The sentry fish sees this and pulls out his own fishing pole with baited hook and the worm jumps onto the hook and the sentry fish reels it in and eats it.\nLater, the ballroom guests are partying and waving their drinking glasses around when a spotlight appears on the curtain. As the curtain rises, we see some dancing legs and as the curtain rises further, it turns out to be a 10-legged octopus! (The crowd boos at the ugly performance.)  The fish that swallowed the hourglass dances with something resembling a walrus or seal; his waistline fits together perfectly with the hourglass in her stomach as they dance. The fish that swallowed the clock smiles and relaxes with his hips still moving from the pendulum swinging inside him.\nA whale appears under Porky's boat and the sentry fish knocks on the hole cover. As Porky opens the cover and says, \"Who's there?\" the whale spouts water from his blowhole, which forces Porky back onto the boat. But then, a tremendous waterspout is coming towards the ship and the vicinity beneath the sea.\nBack in the makeshift hotel, the fish were busy dancing and having a good time until the radio announcer interrupted temporarily for the news of the waterspout coming near the Boola Boola Islands. The fish ignored the news for a moment and resumed dancing until the announcer declared them to scram before the twister hits the area. And the sea creatures did, in their own fashionable way. The waterspout picked up the ship and vacuumed the lost contents out of the water until it died down and both the boat and cargo are safely back where they belong as Porky resumes his journey.\nThe sentry fish spits water in disappointment, but Porky comes back and sprays him with a spritzer-bottle, and the fish starts crying and the cartoon comes to a close.", "tmdb_plot": "Porky sets sail for the Boola-Boola islands in the South Seas with a ship full of general merchandise and plans to open a 5 &amp; 10 cent store.

The mailman speaks to Porky and he received a package from his uncle, Pinkus. There is a letter to him as Porky opens up and reads it, telling that he got a tiny silkworm. The silkworm however came from a big box, and begins to do stuff. He first knits garments whenever the word sew is spoken. Porky commands the worm to sew and it sews a sock as Porky and his dog, Black Fury, look on in awe. Porky gives the command again.  The worm sews a brassiere, which Porky disposes of bashfully as he puts the worm in his coat. After discussing to Black Fury, Porky and Black Fury enter the bathroom where Porky applies hair-growth formula on his own head, producing no results. Then, needing to get ready, Porky hurriedly leaves the bathroom. Black Fury takes the formula and squirts 16 drops in his head until knowing that it contains 99% alcohol, and he begins to drink it. He then starts to have the hiccups, and becomes intoxicated, loudly shouting \"Happy Birthday!\"\nMeanwhile, Porky hears the doorbell again including a knock at the door with the same tune to the mailman including two knocks on Porky's head. It is his friend Penguin, who rushes in, gives Porky a larger present, and begins wolfing down ice cream and ends up slicing the cake - to which he leaves the slice and takes the remaining cake. Goosey (with a pre-Daffy smile) saunters in and holds out his hand for Porky to shake. The hand is a prop, adorned with a sign reading \"Happy Birthday, Fat Boy!\". Porky then angrily throws the sign and looked at Goosey as he turned to the right, and he chuckles at him, stating \"He's so silly.\" Porky repeatedly stutters the word so, causing the silkworm in Porky's pocket to mistake the word for \"sew\" and begins sewing garment after garment. As garments come from underneath Porky's jacket, he notices they are women's underwear and brassieres; he hides them guiltily. He then tosses the silkworm away from him. The silkworm then lands in Penguin's ice cream, and continues sewing garments, which end up in the ice cream. Disgusted, Penguin pulls a sock out of the ice cream after he caught it with his spoon. He continues eating until after disgusted came from his mouth. He pulls him out of his mouth and as he has difficulty swallowing, a top hat forms in his mouth. He throws it and eats another load of ice cream, but he accidentally ate another top hat. The hat pops up, and Penguin's head assumes the shape of it. Failing to quell the hat, Penguin shouts for Goosey's help, who rams Penguin's head into the wall twice. After the Penguin thanked Goosey, he  hitting him with a mallet with a bit daze, and slams a washtub over his head, to no avail by forming a hole.\nMeanwhile, back to Black Fury, looking shaggy after ingesting the hair-growth formula, attempts to do the opposite. After putting on the cream, he starts the electric razor by turning the knobs. The razor takes on the qualities of a snake, and attacks Black Fury as he runs to the hallway. Porky mistakes Black Fury for a mad dog while Porky finishes the last pieces of the ice cream, and the party guests including Porky (acting like a train while holding Goosey) rushed around the house with Black Fury, not realizing that the \"rabid dog\" is actually Porky's pet. Penguin then acts like he is acting like the clothes hanger while Porky and Goosey rushed along, as Penguin puts the real stool back. After several more antics including the 3 managing suitcases, Porky and Goosey rushed inside the closet, and leaving the Penguin alone after slammed by the door, Porky and Goosey looked to the right while holding a match knowing it is Black Fury. And the 2 screamed while Penguin knocks on the door telling that he wants to come in. Porky and Goosey runs over Penguin in the flash and managed the suitcases and Penguin starts to throw a fit, and Black Fury runs over Penguin and he stops arguing. Both Black Fury and Penguin rushed to Porky's bed and hides under his blanket. Penguin then screams when he saw Black Fury with still the shaving cream on. The bed then opens up, with Porky and Goosey hiding under. Porky and Goosey both rushed out of the room and Penguin (attached by a bedroom spring) starts springing forwards and backwards, and gets attacked by Black Fury. The shaving cream dissolved during the fight, and Porky sees that it is just Black Fury. Penguin angrily rolls up his \"sleeve\" and stares Black Fury down, uttering \"So...\" in anticipation of a fight.

Later, Gene breaks into Pomeroy's office to get additional proof of his guilt.\nOn the last day of the Frontier Week rodeo, Gene rides against one of Pomeroy's men in the final event, a stagecoach race. Aunt Hattie bets everything she has on Gene, hoping to save the ranch.

With Frog's help, Gene is able to make it to the race on time. While Gene rides furiously, nearly losing his life, Frog records Pomeroy and his men discussing the \"accidents\" they created during the rodeo.

Bonaparte sees to it that both she and de Lesseps are invited to his reception. At the party, a fortuneteller predicts that Eugenie will have a troubled life, but also wear a crown, and that de Lesseps will dig a ditch. Entranced by Eugenie's beauty, Bonaparte arranges for his romantic rival to be assigned to a diplomatic post in Egypt, joining his father, Count Mathieu de Lesseps (Henry Stephenson), the Consul-General. De Lesseps impulsively asks Eugenie to marry him immediately, but she turns him down.\nIn Egypt, de Lesseps befriends two people who will have a great influence on his life: Toni Pellerin (Annabella), a tomboy being raised by her grandfather, French Sergeant Pellerin (Sig Rumann); and Prince Said (J. Edward Bromberg), the indolent heir of his father, Mohammed Ali (Maurice Moskovitch), the Viceroy (ruler) of Egypt. Toni makes it clear that she has fallen in love with him, but de Lesseps still pines for Eugenie. Count de Lesseps leaves for France, leaving his son to take his place.\nOne day, after a brief rainstorm in the desert, de Lesseps sees the water draining into the sea and comes up with the idea for the Suez Canal. He departs for Paris to raise the necessary funding; Toni goes along as well. He presents his proposal to Bonaparte, but is rejected. He is also disheartened to learn that Eugenie is now very close to Bonaparte.\nFrance is on the verge of civil war between Bonaparte and the French Assembly, led by Count de Lesseps and others. Eugenie persuades Ferdinand de Lesseps to pass along Bonaparte's proposal asking the Assembly to disband, giving Bonaparte's promise to reconvene it once the civil unrest has been defused. Despite their misgivings, the members of the Assembly agree, only to be betrayed and arrested. Bonaparte assumes the throne of the revived French Empire, just as Count de Lesseps had feared. The news causes the count to suffer a fatal stroke. Ferdinand de Lesseps is outraged, but Toni persuades him to do nothing. In return for de Lesseps' help, Bonaparte (now Emperor Napoleon III), withdraws his objections to the canal, and construction commences under de Lesseps' direction.\nThe building of the canal progresses despite Turkish sabotage. However, Napoleon unexpectedly withdraws his support out of political necessity; he needs to appease Great Britain, and the British Prime Minister (George Zucco) is firmly opposed to the project. Prince Said bankrupts himself to keep the venture going, but it is not enough. De Lesseps goes to England to plead his case. The Prime Minister is unmoved, but the leader of the opposition, Benjamin Disraeli (Miles Mander), is enthusiastic about the project. Disraeli tells him to return to Egypt and pray that Disraeli wins the upcoming general election. He does, and funding is assured.\nAs the canal nears completion, an enormous sandstorm threatens everything.

With their only hope being in their friendship, the three comrades open a taxi and auto repair business and are barely able to eke out a living.  \nOne day several years later (1920), while driving to a country inn in Otto's precious souped-up jalopy roadster, \"Baby\", to celebrate Erich's birthday (the youngest and least cynical of the three), the friends get into a back road car race with a Herr Breuer, who is driving a luxury car, accompanied by Patricia Hollmann. The boys win their little race and they - along with Breuer and Pat - all arrive at the country inn together.

Though Pat is worldly, she is drawn to the innocent Erich, and gives him her telephone number.

When the local doctor reveals her condition to Erich, and says that she may die if her hemorrhaging does not stop very soon, Erich calls Otto to find Pat's specialist, Dr. Felix Jaffe.

She has expressed her alienation from society by becoming part of a criminal gang specialising in blackmail. This gang has two notable operations going as the film starts: they are demanding a large sum from a doctor's wife, Mrs. Wegert, for letters she wrote to a lover, and they are pressuring a rich Consul's dissolute nephew, Torsten Barring, who is entangled in their complex schemes and owes them increasing sums, to murder the little boy, the Consul Magnus Barring's orphan grandson, who stands between him and inheriting the Consul's estate.\nTo succeed in this, the gang needs a woman accomplice to be sent as the little boy's governess and help kill him; they deplore the fact that Anna's face makes her ineligible for this.\nAnna goes to Dr. Allan Wegert's house to threaten Mrs. Wegert into paying for the letters; Mrs. Wegert gives her all her jewellery, which she puts in her purse, but it is only half the sum the gang demands. Dr. Wegert comes home, and Anna injures her foot trying to escape through the window. Dr. Wegert finds the jewellery in Anna's purse and, not suspecting she is a blackmailer, takes her for a burglar, but is interested in the problem of her disfigured face. He is a plastic surgeon and has specialised in restoring the faces of men damaged in World War I.\nInstead of turning her in, he puts her in his hospital, heals her foot and operates on her face. Mrs. Wegert goes to the hospital to see if Anna will give to her the letters if the surgery is successful. As Anna is taken to Dr. Wegert for removal of the bandages, she gives to Mrs Wegert the letters, asking for nothing in return. The operation is successful, and Anna is beautiful; she is also moved by her talks with Dr. Wegert to become a different person.\nAnna is now fit to go north to Forsa, where the Consul's estate is situated, as governess to his grandson, Lars-Erik. She has assumed a new name, Anna Paulsson. Already conflicted about helping Torsten murder the boy, she turns against the idea entirely as she grows to love Lars-Erik and the happy family atmosphere with which the Consul and his servants surround him. A close friend and employee of the family business, Harald Berg, who is treated like a member of the family (Lars-Erik calls him uncle), falls in love with Anna and she with him. The head of Anna's gang and the other members turn up at the hotel in town to urge her to get on with the plan, and Torsten pressures her.\nOn a winter night sleigh ride, Torsten manages to be in a sleigh alone with Lars-Erik, and whips the horses into running off with it. Anna, in a sleigh with Harald, realises that he means to fake an accident that kills Lars-Erik, and desperately whips up their own horses to pursue them. As they speed along, she confesses the murder plot to Harald and the part she was meant to play in it. They catch up, she snatches Lars-Erik out of Torsten's sleigh, but Harald is thrown from their sleigh and badly injured. Torsten, dropping his torch on the snow, rides off into the darkness. Anna's gang members hear what has happened, good-naturedly give up on Anna and leave town.\nIn the aftermath of the murder attempt, Anna is still with the Barring family as governess and Harald is recovering from his injuries. The Consul tells Anna that Harald has resigned from the firm and wants to leave the country to go travelling and convalesce. The Consul is very upset and tells her that he wants Harald to come home to Forsa, where he belongs. He hopes she can persuade him to return.
