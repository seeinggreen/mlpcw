Shiva gave the responsibility of balancing the earth to Agathiyar by going to the southern side. Agathiyar is also given the additional responsibility of spreading goodness and equality. He has the additional task of spreading the Tamil language. Many small stories between heaven and earth are interwoven in the movie. The stories teach one to lead a simple existence without ego.

Finally, Agathiyar loses his temper and traps river Ponni in his Kamandalam, and sat down to meditate. Lord Vinayagar (Lord Ganesha) in the form of a crow, pushes Agathiyar Kamandalam down, thus rescuing and leading the river into its formation. Then Agathiyar named the River Ponni as River Kaveri (Crow) (In Tamil (Kakam), pushed Kamandalam and the water flows to broadly (In Tamil Virinthu Odiyathal) named as Ka + viri= Kaviri (became Kaveri in later usage).\nOne time Mount Vidhayan was continually growing in size due to taunting comments by Sage Narathar (Narada). So as to temper the vanity of the mountains, Sage Agathiyar travelled to the southern side via mount Vindhyan. On their way when Vindhyan saw Agathiyar, he bowed with respect and reverence, upon which sage Agathiyar jokingly asked if he would stay bowed and subdued with respect till the sage returned. Mount Vindhyan was truly benevolent and promised to not grow until the sage returns from the south. However, after passing through the mount, the sage will not require again to cross over to the northern side of Mount Vindhyan.\nNarathar was speaking proudly to others. He is most reverent to Vishnu (Lord Narayana) because he always thinks and chants about only Vishnu. Agathiyar tells Narathar to watch one day for a potter. Narathar also does that and tells Agathiyar that the potter man chants about \"Narayana\" twice daily. Then, Agathiyar kept Narathar a small bowl full of oil in Narathar's hands. Agathiyar gives a rule asking Narathar to not spill one drop of oil while going around the world, and Narada does the job perfectly. Agathiyar then questions Narathar, \"how many times did you chant \"Narayana\"'s name today?\" for which Narathar answered saying \"how can I even think of revering my name, when I have a burden kept in my hands?\". Agathiyar explains to Narathar, that he has one smallest burden, but even while doing that you forgot to chant your name. But that man has much troubles in his family and many burdens. But he still remembered and chanted Vishnu's name, which makes him the best devotee of Vishnu.\nRavana was in a Yazh competition with Agathiyar Muni, because of taunting comments by the Narathar Muni. But who shall be the competition's referee? Ravana called Goddess Saraswati, but Saraswati told them, we both her eyes. So, she leaves them. Then only Ravan select for \"Ponmalai\" because stones only not melting to anything. both are composing the instrument Yazh who turn composing the Yazh when the mount started to melt, they won the competition. Unfortunately, Ravana loses the competition and then Agathiyar was given new name to \"ponmalai\", it named by Pothigai Malai (meaning it was give judgement for constant (or) the judgement is impartial).\nIt is said that two demon brothers Ilavala and Vathapi used to kill Brahmins as a revenge in a simple manner. The two had special powers, they came up with a plan to take revenge on Brahmins. \"Vatapi\" would turn in to ripe mango. He would invite any passers-by, especially Brahmins for a grand feast at his home. After they eat the mango, Ilavala would call his brother out: \"Vathapi\" , his brother would respond from the belly of the visitor and come out alive in one piece. In the process the guest would be killed. The two demons later would enjoy a curry made of human flesh. One day, Agathiyar happened to pass by, the plan as usual, Vatapi changed into a ripe mango and the other disguised himself as brahmachari (Sage of Bachelor) who invited Agathiyar to eat at the home. Agathiyar knew about the plan due to his immense Vedic Power, he resolves to teach both a lesson. After the meal, Agathiyar simply rubbed his stomach saying \"Vathapi Jeerano bhave\" may Vathapi be digested, while other demon tries to bring his brother life, but in vain.

They talk about Nandu and the Doctor informs him that Nandu is in town. Nandu meets Anand Babu when he comes to meet the doctor to ask regarding the medicine, who takes him to meet Pushpa.

Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors. The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, who has been dead for a hundred years, the present Mr Blunden being his great-grandson.After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier. Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr Blunden, until Georgie comes of age. Bertie marries a music hall performer, Bella Wickens (Madeline Smith) and her parents then move into Langley Park, ostensibly as the housekeeper and game keeper. The children come to suspect that Mrs. Wickens (Diana Dors) and her disturbed violent husband (David Lodge) are plotting to kill them to get hold of Georgie's inheritance. Sara and Georgie find a book with instructions for travelling through time, so that they can get help. Lucy and Jamie agree to travel back with them; they arrange to meet Sara the next day.\nJamie searches the graveyard, in the hope of finding nothing and being able to go back to help, knowing in advance that they will succeed. He and Lucy are shocked to find a gravestone marked with the names of both Sara and Georgie. The sexton explains that the two children died in a fire, whose anniversary turns out to be exactly a hundred years ago tomorrow. The children meet Mr Blunden who admits he has been tormented for over a hundred years because of the events but promises if they both help no harm will come to them. Lucy and Jamie drink the potion and travel back to 1818 in the hope of preventing the tragedy. There they meet Thomas the gardener who believes they are from America, and tells Lucy and Jamie that he wants to go there one day and make his fortune. Mr Blunden is visiting the house that night, but refuses to listen to Sara's pleas for help.\nThat night the children are locked in a room above the library, and given a sleeping potion. Mr Wickens starts a fire in the library, trapping the children. Jamie helps Tom to save Sara, but when he tries to return for Georgie, he finds himself unable to get through the flames. Mr Blunden appears, and tells Jamie that they will go together, holding hands. Jamie is kept safe from the fire, but Mr Blunden suffers the pain that Jamie would have felt. Jamie and Mr Blunden save Georgie, with Blunden perishing in the fire as the staircase gives way, a serene smile on his face. The Wickens perish in the fire. Lucy and Jamie both return to 1918, but Jamie is unconscious and Lucy cannot tell their mother what has happened.\nAt the graveyard, Lucy discovers that the children's gravestone has been replaced by another: that of Frederick Percival Blunden, the \"Good Shepherd\" who \"died to save the children in his care\". Jamie soon awakes and is overjoyed to hear that they have succeeded. Shortly after, the lawyer, Mr Clutterbuck (Graham Crowden), visits them and informs them that recently discovered documents show that Sara Latimer married Thomas and that their great-grandson was the late Mr. Allen. This makes Jamie the rightful heir to the Langley Park.\nAt the end a car pulls up. When Mr Clutterbuck opens the door, sitting inside is Mr Blunden! But which one?

As part of their latest investigation, the men have begun photographing individuals at the moment of death; done properly, the resultant photos depict a strange smudge hovering around the body. Though the society concludes that they have captured evidence of the soul escaping the body, Cunningham is sceptical.\nAt a riverside party to celebrate his recent engagement, Cunningham is making home movies with a primitive movie camera of his own invention when his fianc\u00e9e and son are killed in a boating accident. When Cunningham views the film, he sees that not only has he captured the blur, but that it is moving towards his son, and not away from him. From this, Cunningham concludes that the blur is not the soul but a force known as an \"asphyx\", a kind of personal Grim Reaper, told of in Greek mythology, which comes for every individual at the moment of his or her death.\nWhile filming a public execution as a protest against capital punishment, Cunningham activates a spotlight that he has crafted using phosphorus stones beneath a drip irrigation valve. Later, when viewing the film with his adopted son Giles, Cunningham sees that the condemned man's asphyx was briefly held suspended in the spotlight's beam. Concluding that an individual's asphyx is an organic force and therefore subject to the laws of physics, Cunningham theorises that some property of the energy released by the combination of phosphorus and water renders the asphyx immobile. If correct, this would mean that an asphyx could be trapped, and that an individual would be immortal so long as their asphyx remained imprisoned.\nCunningham and Giles successfully capture the asphyx of a dying guinea pig and seal it in the family tomb, beneath a spring fuelled by the lake. Seeing immortality in his grasp, Cunningham tasks Giles with helping him to capture his own asphyx, deciding that his contributions to science are too important for him to die. Cunningham commissions the construction of an impenetrable vault door on his family tomb, with a complex combination lock as the only means of opening it; once he has captured his asphyx, Giles is under instruction to seal the asphyx inside, so that no one can ever set it free.\nUsing an electric chair to slowly kill himself, Cunningham summons his own asphyx. However, Giles is only experienced in capturing an asphyx with two men, and is forced to rely on his fianc\u00e9e (and stepsister), Christina, for assistance. Christina is horrified with the experiments, but agrees to participate when Cunningham tells her that he will give his blessing for the two to marry if they allow him to make them immortal.\nTheorising that imminent death, and not actual death, will summon an asphyx, Cunningham places Christina on a guillotine operated by Giles. During the experiment, the guinea pig chews through a hose pumping water onto the phosphorus stones being used to capture the asphyx. The equipment malfunctions and in the resultant panic, Christina is decapitated and dies.\nDespondent, Cunningham insists that Giles open the vault and free his asphyx. Giles agrees, on the condition that Cunningham first grant him immortality. In fact Giles no longer wishes to live without his fianc\u00e9e and, unbeknownst to Cunningham, he sabotages the procedure by removing the phosphorus stones from the spotlight. As Cunningham attempts to gas Giles to death to summon his asphyx, he realises the equipment is not working, turns off the gas and turns on the oxygen to save Giles. Giles strikes a match. The resulting explosion kills Giles and destroys all of the equipment required to capture asphyxes.\nAlthough Giles left behind the combination to the vault on a slip of paper, Cunningham destroys it, resolving that his own immortality is God's punishment for the deaths of Giles and Christina. In a framing sequence set in the 1970s, an ancient, disfigured Cunningham roams the streets of London with the guinea pig.

During a long recovery process, he slowly finds God in poverty, chastity and obedience, experiencing a physical and spiritual renewal.\nHealthy again, Francesco returns to his normal life as a rich young man. However, to the consternation of his parents, he begins to spend most of his time surrounded by nature, flowers, trees, animals and poetry as he becomes more and more reluctant to resume his prior lifestyle. Pietro's obsession with gold now fills Francesco with revulsion, creating an open confrontation between Francesco and Pietro.\nFrancesco wanders into the basement where the family business is located. He feels the heat and humidity of the dye vats, passing through colorful lots of drying cloth, to see the workers with their families laboring in the heat without much rest. Rejecting his father's offer to take over the family business, he instead pulls the laborers out of the building to enjoy the daylight.

Much to the dismay of his family, some of Francesco's friends join him. He gradually gains a following from the sons of the wealthy, who begin to minister among the poor and the suffering.\nThe bishop supports Francesco, since he is rebuilding a church without pay and performing the works of mercy Christ demands of His followers.

(This scene, introduced for dramatic effect, is unhistorical.) That people can hate so much causes Francesco much sorrow. He blames himself but cannot understand what he has done wrong. He then decides to walk to Rome and to seek out the answers from Pope Innocent III.\nIn Rome, Francesco is stunned by the enormous wealth and power shown in the clothing of the papal court surrounding the throne of St. Peter. When granted an audience with the Pope, Francesco breaks from reciting Paolo's carefully prepared script and calmly protests against pomp and worldliness, reciting some of Jesus' words from the Sermon on the Mount praising humility to protest that Christ's teachings are totally opposite to Rome's obsession with wealth. The cardinals, bishops and abbots of the papal court are insulted at having the words of Jesus thrown in their faces. Francesco and his friends are expelled. Finally accepting his admiration toward Francesco, Paolo decides to join them. Francesco tries to protect Paolo, saying that he is not one of them, but his friend insists on joining the friars, convincing Francesco of the sincerity of his conversion, and they are put out with the others.\nOn his throne Pope Innocent, seemingly waking from a dream, orders Francesco and his friends to be brought back. The Pope addresses Francesco: \"In our obsession with original sin we have forgotten original innocence.\" In language from one of the Psalms, Innocent prays that Francesco's order \"flourish like the palm.\"\nThen to everyone's astonishment, Pope Innocent kneels, kisses Francesco's feet and blesses him and his companions, wishing for them a long worldwide society of men and women willing to serve God in humility.

Lucas says the party expected McKay to lose but not to be humiliated, so he moderates his message to appeal to a broader range of voters.\nMcKay campaigns across the state, his message growing more generic each day. This approach lifts him in the opinion polls, but he has a new problem: because McKay's father has stayed out of the race, the media interpret his silence as an endorsement of Jarmon.

Chaucer (played by Pasolini himself) enters through the gate and bumps into a heavy man covered in woad tattooing, injuring his nose. The wife of Bath delivers long-winded monologues to disinterested listeners about her weaving skills and sexual prowess. The Pardoner unsuccessfully attempts to sell what he claims are pieces of cloth from the sail of St. Peter's boat and the Holy Virgin's veil.

The two vow to be friends but the vendor reveals himself to be the devil. The summoner does not care about this and says they will make great partners as they are both out for profit. The summoner then explains that he must collect money from a miserly old woman. When they meet the old woman, the summoner levies false charges against her and tells her that she must appear before the ecclesiastical court but says that if she pays him a bribe in the amount she owes, she will be excused. The old woman accuses him of lying, and curses him to be taken away by the devil if he does not repent. She says the devil can take him and the pitcher she owns which is her most valuable possession. The devil asks her if she truly means what she says and she assents. The summoner refuses to repent and the devil proceeds to take him (and the pitcher) to hell as they are now his by divine right.\nThird Tale (The Cook's Tale):\nThe travelers at the Tabard Inn have all fallen asleep save for Chaucer.

Perkin crashes a wedding where he steals the attention of the bride and smashes a wedding cake into the face of the feckless husband. This enrages the father-in-law who throws him out. Perkin goes home where he is scolded by his midget father. His mother is more sympathetic and steals food for him. She hopes he will find work tomorrow. Perkin next finds work polishing eggs. While his employer is away, Perkin is distracted by a group of men playing a dice game nearby and joins them. He steals money from his employer to use but is soon discovered and fired.

His wife scolds him for wasting time so he sits down to write his own story. This is the Miller's Tale.[1]Nicholas, a young student lives next door to an overweight, elderly carpenter named John. He notices that John has left for Osney so he goes next door to seduce his much younger wife Alison, whom secretly detests him. Absolon, another youth is also in love with Alison. He and his homosexual friend Martin go to Alison later and serenade her with the ballad The Gower Wassail much to her and her now returned husband's chagrin. In order to deceive the carpenter, Nicholas pretends to be in a holy trance. When the carpenter enters the room to see what is wrong, Nicholas convinces him that a massive flood is about to occur, and claims that he, the carpenter, and Allison should all three wait in buckets tied to the ceiling rafters to escape drowning. The carpenter does as he says and they hide in the buckets. While the carpenter waits in his bucket, he drifts off to sleep. Nicholas and Alison come out of their buckets and sneak away to have sex. Meanwhile, Absolon returns but Alison scolds him and tells him that she does not love him. He accepts but asks only for a kiss. Allison answers him by inviting him to climb up to her window and then when he puckers his lips, she sticks her buttocks out the window and farts in his face (a departure from the original, in which it is Nicholas, not Alison, who farts in his face). Absolon is offended and runs to a blacksmith's shop where he borrows a hot poker, and then returns to the carpenter's house and asks for another kiss. On this occasion, Nicholas goes to the window instead of Alison, and has his buttocks scalded. Nicholas then cries out for water, leading the carpenter to awaken and believe that the flood has arrived. The carpenter then cuts the rope holding his bucket in the air, and violently falls to the ground.\nFifth Tale (The Wife of Bath's Prologue):\nIn Bath, a middle-aged woman's fourth husband falls ill during sex and dies soon after. The wife meets a young student named Jenkin and is instantly smitten by him after watching him bathing. Her friend who is lodging the student sets up for her to meet Jenkin alone during an 'Obby 'Oss celebration that is coming up. At the celebration, she gets Jenkin alone and gives him a handjob. She tells him that he must marry her because she had a prophetic dream that he was trying to kill her and that she was covered in blood. Blood means gold. She buries her husband and marries Jenkin in quick succession, literally running from her late husband's funeral in one wing of a cathedral to her wedding in another wing. On their wedding night, the wife of Bath's fifth husband reads to her from a book denouncing the evils of historical women such as Eve and Xanthippe. The wife of Bath demands that he not tell her about her own business, and destroys the book. Her husband pushes her away, and she falls onto her back and moans on the floor. She feigns injury and tells him that she is dying. She curses him for plotting to take her land and inheritance. When he leans over to comfort her, however, she bites his nose.

They bring a sack of grain to a mill to be milled into flour. Simkin the Miller tricks the youths by freeing their horse and switching their flour for bran while they chase after it. When they return with the horse, it is late in the evening, and the students ask to stay the night. The Miller agrees to let them stay, and the two share a pallet bed next to one shared by the Miller and his wife. During the night, Alan seduces Molly, the Miller's daughter, being careful not to wake the Miller. John is angered by this as he is left alone and feels foolish. The Miller's wife, meanwhile, gets up to urinate, and stumbles over the crib at the foot of her and the Miller's pallet. John gets an idea and before she returns, he moves the crib to the foot of his own pallet, tricking the miller's wife into sleeping with him instead of the Miller. Alan finishes having sex with Molly, and she confesses that she and father have stolen his flour. Alan then gets into bed with the Miller and tells him about his exploits with Molly, thinking that the Miller is his companion. The Miller then attacks the scholar, causing his wife and John to come to the scholar's defense in the dark room and knock him out. The scholars then ride away with their flour as Molly forlornly says farewell.\nSeventh Tale (The Pardoner's Tale):\nChaucer sits down to write another story. He has a very focused look on his face.\nIn Flanders, four young men spend their time carousing in a brothel that is full of prostitutes who specialize in BDSM and cleaning smegma. One of the boys, Rufus, is drunk and yells at the other customers for their immorality before urinating on them. The next day, Rufus is killed by a thief. The other boys hear about this and misunderstand the news they are told. They believe Rufus was literally murdered by a man named Death. They agree to seek out Death for themselves and get revenge on him for murdering their friend. The youths then encounter an old man, who they accuse of conspiring with Death in order to kill the young, and demand at knifepoint that he tell them where Death is located. The old man tells them to look around a nearby oak tree, where they find instead an abundance of treasure. While two of the youths wait by the treasure, a third (Dick the Sparrow) leaves for town, returning later with three casks of wine, two of which he has poisoned. When he reaches the tree, the two youths drink the poisoned wine and stab their companion, then succumb to the poison.\nEighth Tale (The Summoner's Tale):\nIn the final tale, a gluttonous friar tries to extract as many donations as possible from a bedridden parishioner. The parishioner then offers him his most valuable possession, provided he promises to distribute it equally among all the friars. The parishioner claims that this possession is located beneath his buttocks. When the friar reaches down to retrieve the item, the bedridden man farts into his hands. That night, an angel visits the friar and brings him to hell, where Satan expels hundreds of corrupt friars from his rectum. This segment with Satan defecating corrupt friars is from the Summoner's prologue rather than the main tale.\nEpilogue (Chaucer's Retraction):\nThe film ends with the pilgrims arriving at Canterbury Cathedral, and Chaucer at home writing (in transl.) \"Here ends the Canterbury Tales, told only for the pleasure of telling them. Amen\": a line original to the film. The brief scene differs starkly from the original text.

He rides into deserted Bozeman, Montana, where his friend Anse Peterson suggests hiring local schoolboys. Andersen visits the school, but departs, skeptical that such immature boys could handle the job.\nThe next morning, the boys show up at Andersen's ranch to volunteer for the drive. Andersen reluctantly tests their ability to stay on a bucking horse, and as they successively take turns, Cimarron, a boy slightly older than the others, rides up. He subdues the test horse but then gets into a fight with Slim, the next-oldest boy. With no other options and somewhat impressed, Andersen hires all of the boys, though he sends Cimarron away after the older boy pulls a knife on Slim during another fight.\nAndersen locks all of the boys' guns in a box that will be kept on the chuck wagon during the drive, and they practice roping, branding, and herding cattle and horses.

The arrival of Jebediah Nightlinger, a black cook, completes Andersen's crew.\nOn the trail, Andersen notices Cimarron following the herd, which slightly nettles him. When Slim slips off his horse while crossing a river and Cimarron appears and saves him, however, Andersen decides to let Cimarron join the drive.\nSlowly, the boys become good cowhands, impressing both Andersen and Nightlinger. One day Dan, a boy who wears glasses, is chasing a stray horse when he stumbles upon Watts and his gang of cattle rustlers. Watts, who reveals he has been trailing the herd, releases Dan but threatens to slit the boy's throat if he says anything to Andersen. Dan is reluctant to go on watch that night, but Andersen, who thinks the boy is just afraid of the dark, convinces him to do his duty. Dan drops his glasses off a cliff overlooking the cattle, and Charlie, another one of the boys, falls off his horse and is trampled to death when he goes to get them.\nSoon after, the chuck wagon throws a wheel. While the others continue on, Nightlinger and a boy named Homer hang back to handle the repairs. Seeing this, Watts and his gang come out of hiding and begin to openly parallel the herd. Andersen sends another boy named Weedy back to tell Nightlinger to rejoin the herd as soon as possible and then gathers the remaining boys together. So they will not be harmed, he tells them to act like boys rather than the men they are becoming when the rustlers approach that evening. Dan tells Andersen he knew Watts had been following them but was scared to tell, and Andersen comforts the boy.\nAfter dark, Watts and his gang surround Andersen and the boys in their camp. They deliver a battered Weedy, and Watts forces Andersen to surrender his gun and begins to taunt Dan. Andersen finally intervenes when Watts crushes Dan's glasses, and a brutal fist fight ensues between Andersen and Watts, with Andersen coming out on top. He tells the boys to get ready to leave and starts to walk away, ignoring Watts' calls to stop. Watts wings Andersen in both arms and a leg before shooting him twice in the torso. The boys remain passive as instructed, and the rustlers steal the herd.\nIn the morning, Nightlinger and Homer rejoin to the group and find the boys tending to Andersen, who is near death. Andersen instructs Nightlinger to take the boys home and in his final moments tells the boys how proud he is of them.\nFollowing Andersen's burial, the boys overpower Nightlinger and seize the box of firearms stored in the chuck wagon, planning to avenge Andersen's death and finish the cattle drive.

They decide to cross the marshland to intercept the Germans but the going is slow and treacherous, causing Galya to lose a boot. When they finally reach the location that Vaskov knows that the German paratroopers will have to pass, they lie in wait\u2014only to find that there are sixteen German paratroopers instead of two. His soldiers come up with the idea to bluff the paratroopers into thinking that there are a lot of civilians in their path, by cutting down trees and lighting fires, which will cause the Germans to change direction. Though the plan almost fails, Zhenya's last-minute audacity in jumping into the river convinces the paratroopers to take a detour through the forest. Vaskov sends Lisa back to base for reinforcements.\nThe group left in the forest prepare to reroute to avoid direct contact with the German troops. Backs against the wall, they engage in guerrilla warfare with the Germans. Sonia is killed by a knife and Galya is shot and dies immediately from her wounds. Vaskov, to create a diversion, leads the Germans away from the remaining two soldiers, firing at them with his Nagant revolver as they chase him through the forest. Vaskov is shot in the arm but manages to escape from the Germans\u2014realizing that the reinforcements have not come, he hallucinates about Lisa, who tells him that she failed because she went too fast, drowning in the wet marshland.\nHe miraculously comes across Rita and Zhenya but after a tearful reunion realizes that they have disobeyed his orders to retreat. He searches in his bag for a grenade to mount a suicide attack with but finds that the girls have taken the detonator out. Although he threatens to court martial them for continuing to disobey orders, they refuse to leave and instead prepare to ambush the Germans. During a prolonged engagement, Rita is injured by shrapnel from a grenade and tells Zhenya to leave her. Realizing that they are cornered, Zhenya disobeys Vaskov's orders to cover them and instead taunts and lures the Germans away through the forest, as Vaskov did earlier and is killed. Vaskov stays with Rita against her wishes to treat her wounds and promises to take her back to base. She asks him to take care of her son in the neighboring village. After kissing her at her request, he leaves to find a way out, giving her the revolver but soon comes back to find that Rita has shot herself.\nThe desperate Vaskov, armed only with a knife, one shot in his revolver and a grenade without a fuze, returns to the cabin where the Germans are resting from their wounds. By stabbing a soldier, shooting another and bluffing with the grenade, he captures a submachine gun and forces the remaining Germans to drop their weapons. Vaskov threatens to kill them (Five girls... five young girls were here, only five, and you did not pass! You'll croak here, everyone will croak!.. I'll kill each of you with my own hands... with my own hands! And let them judge me...), but a Soviet radio communique calms him, and he eventually takes the three remaining Germans as prisoners back to Soviet lines. The rest of the women of the regiment, who have come to rescue the group, find Vaskov before he passes out from exhaustion.\nThirty years after the war ends, Vaskov visits the area of the battle again with an officer, implied to be Rita's son. The girl from the beginning arrives with a bouquet of flowers from her boyfriend, only to see that they are at a memorial for the five female soldiers that died there. She leaves the flowers at the memorial and the three of them pay their respects.", "tmdb_id": 49106}, "26198005": {"title": "A Day in the Death of Joe Egg (film)", "plot": "Christmas is fast approaching, and British schoolteacher Bri is bitter and vexed upon seeing his classroom of schoolboys loudly talking and interrupting him. He forces them to put their hands on their heads and sit there in silence well after the dismissal bell has sounded, whereupon he has a fantasy of a nude blonde woman, makes a Freudian slip comment about breasts, and mischievously flees the school in his aging vehicle (while still leaving the schoolboys sitting there, never dismissing them), returning home to spend the holiday with his family. He plays a playful prank on Sheila, his wife, taping a fake rubber spider to his face. Sheila is an eccentric, ditzy housewife who collects a wide assortment of domestic pets, including guinea pigs, a Siamese cat and two parakeets. The couple's quirky banter becomes increasingly frenzied and bizarre, and when they enter the back room of their home, it's revealed that they have an adolescent daughter, Josephine (affectionately called \"Joe Egg\" and \"Jo\"). Josephine had some unexplained form of severe intellectual disability, unable to walk, use the toilet or speak to anybody. A flashback to a trip at the beach reveals that Sheila had a narrow pelvic opening, resulting in a risky and troublesome birth. Bri and Sheila pretend to be Josephine back and forth in order to fantasize a facsimile of a conversation with her. Josephine urinates, and as Bri has to change her, he begs her to say something to him, while Sheila talks to herself casually. The couple is increasingly distracted by their myriad sexual games at home, coupled with nosy neighbours and Josephine's doctors and nurses. Bri worries that Josephine is \"fat\" and \"jaundiced\", and wonders about the long-term state of her health. He and Sheila increasingly rely on dark humour to make their pain bearable. As they consider Josephine's quality of life, at one point they even contemplate euthanasia, while neighbours and friends point out the potential merits of committing the girl to a nursing home. As Josephine becomes terminally ill and close to death, Sheila suspects that Bri may have something to do with it. They struggle to hold their family together, along with a close-knit group of wacky friends and relatives, while Josephine languishes at home. When Josephine eventually survives, Sheila finally realizes the mental toll the whole ordeal has had on Bri, and she admits quietly to him her plans to leave the girl in a residential hospital forever, hoping to have a second honeymoon with her husband.

A Stranger clad in black (Wojciech Pszoniak) enters a prison where Jakub (Leszek Teleszy\u0144ski) is being held on charges that he tried to assassinate the king as part of a conspiracy. The Stranger frees Jakub in the midst of a riot, tells him to return home, and sends a white-clad nun named Zakonnica (Monika Niemczyk) to accompany Jakub. Zakonnica appears to be a representation of goodness/God and the Stranger a representation of evil/the Devil. Through most of the movie, Zakonnica remains in a state of stunned horror at the things she and Jakub witness.\nAlong the way, Jakub (who is constantly followed by the Stranger) encounters a hedonistic group of actors, all of whom wish to seduce him. He finds that his best friend and co-conspirator told Jakub's pregnant fianc\u00e9e that Jakub was killed and has married her instead (it also appears that Jakub's friend is now working for the King). Jakub returns home to find that his father committed suicide and his sister has gone mad. The household is being run by his half-brother, who mocks Jakub's cause and intends to marry Jakub's sister (whom he mercilessly beats). Jakub also learns that his mother (who abandoned Jakub and his sister as children) actually has lived close by their entire lives, running a bordello. He confronts his mother at the bordello (the mother does not appear to recognize Jakub) where they almost sleep together (intra-family sexual taboos are a theme throughout the film: the sister is betrothed to her half-brother and was seemingly raped by their father after the father went insane; and Jakub appears to have romantic feelings for his mom and sister). Jakub  takes out his rage on a prostitute in the bordello, slitting her throat with a straight razor given to him by the Stranger.\nRepulsed by his actions, Jakub seeks comfort from Zakonnica, but she pushes him away. Jakub appears to go mad. He returns to his friend's castle to try and reunite with his fianc\u00e9e, only to be beaten (and then, kissed) by his former best friend. He is found by the acting troupe and is seduced by one of the actresses. In mid-coitus, he is attacked by another actor out of jealousy. Jakub kills the actor and actress and is pursued by the remaining troupe. The leader of the troupe (a man) tries to sleep with Jakub in exchange for not turning him in to the authorities, eventually trying to rape Jakub. The Stranger shows up and saves Jakub by killing the leader of the troupe. Zakonnica and Jakub journey to a place Jakub played as a child to find his ex-fianc\u00e9e there. She expresses a wish to run away with Jakub, but then passes away due to complications with her pregnancy (and passes away despite Jakub pleading with Zakonnica to save her). The Stranger then has Jakub return to his mother's bordello.\nThe mother embraces Jakub (now knowing who he is) and takes him to the basement where the denizens are engaged in all manner of hedonistic actions. She says he can stay with her as a prostitute, where people will be thrilled by any murders he commits. She also claims that the Stranger is a low-level government clerk. Having seemingly taken the Stranger's earlier claims that Jakub is meant to cleanse the world as true, he kills his mother and disperses the crowd. He then returns home where he kills his step-brother, mercy kills his sister (who had been horribly beaten by their blood-thirsty half-brother), and burns down his family house.\nEnraged, Jakub returns to his best friend's home and kills his friend in a duel. Zakonnica helps a delirious Jakub flee into the woods where they are encountered once more by the Stranger. The Stranger demands Jakub sign a document identifying all his former friends and family as conspirators against the king and crediting the Stranger with bringing the conspiracy down (this seems to confirm the Mother's claims that the Stranger is indeed a man working for the government). The Stranger says he had to expose Jakub to the truth about his family and friends or else he never would have given them up. Jakub agrees to sign only if the Stranger can tell him if the world has beauty in it or if it is all corrupt. The Stranger says the world is beautiful (and portrays his feelings about the world through dance). After Jakub signs the document, the Stranger fatally shoots him in the head and takes Zakonnica.\nThe pair journey to some Prussian soldiers where the Stranger hands them the documents signed by Jakub. The soldiers criticize the Stranger as immoral, pay him for his work, and mock his efforts to corrupt Jakub's soul.

Giuseppe Barra, a local simpleton spying on two locals engaged with visiting prostitutes, is surprised when the three boys who are watching him begin to taunt him. Meanwhile, in the hills surrounding the village, La Magiara, a reclusive Gypsy witch, conducts black magic ceremonies, first by digging up the skeletal remains of an infant and then plunging pins through the heads of three tiny clay dolls. It is made clear that these are the three youths taunting Giuseppe.\nWhen Bruno goes missing, a media circus begins as reporters from all over Italy converge on the town. One of them is Andrea Martelli, a sharp-witted journalist from Rome whose insights into the case are acknowledged by the regional police commissioner working with the collaboration of the village chief of police Captain Modesti. Amid local hysteria, Giuseppe is arrested when he picks up a ransom he demanded from the boy's parents for the boy's return. While he takes police to the buried body of Bruno, he protests his innocence of murder, for he claims to have only discovered the body of the boy and then phoned the parents in a feeble attempt to extract a surprisingly small ransom. When the corpse of Tonino is found, the police realize that Giuseppe is innocent. A few nights later, during a raging thunderstorm, Michele sneaks out of his house to meet with someone he speaks to over the phone, and he too is strangled by an unseen assailant, and his body is found the following morning.\nMartelli soon meets and befriends Patrizia, whom he recognizes from newspapers where he used to work in Milan. Patrizia is living at her father's house in the town as she is lying low after a drug scandal. The rest of the insular villagers ostracize her because of her big-city ways, perceived lack of morality, and modern dress style with halter-tops and mini-skirts. She has various seemingly sinister interactions with several children from the town, including Michele, with whom she seductively teases, then rejects, while nude; Mario, a young boy whom she offers the choice of either payment or a kiss in exchange for fixing a flat tire; and Malvina, priest Don Alberto\u2019s disabled sister, who is dragged by Patrizia across the town square against her will, in order that Patrizia could buy Malvina a doll.\nMartelli also meets with the amiable young village priest, Don Alberto Avallone, and his reserved mother, Aurelia. Don Alberto runs a boys' group at the church, which the murder victims belonged to, and encourages the boys to play soccer on the church grounds to keep them out of trouble. As the local priest, he is well-known and respected in the area.\nMeanwhile, Captain Modesti and his aide visit Francesco, an eccentric old hermit living in a tumbledown stone hut in the hills overlooking the town, who practices black magic, offering charms and potions to the superstitious. He claims he has passed his magical knowledge to his daughter, Magiara, and also spends time with the casual thrill-seeking Patrizia. He is also rumored to have had (and then disposed of) a baby from a tryst with Magiara. Angered by Francesco's unwillingness to co-operate with the investigation, the police proceed to hunt down and arrest Magiara. Under interrogation, the fevered woman gleefully confesses to the murders. However, it appears to Modesti and the Commissioner that she believes her voodoo dolls and incantations have alone brought about the deaths of the three interfering boys, and she professes to have no interest in or awareness of the physical methods used. An alibi provided by a policeman sighting Magiara miles away from the latest murder scene clinches her innocence, and she is released.\nNonetheless, the hostile and superstitious villagers are not convinced: Magiara is shunned by the local women and then attacked in a local graveyard by a small group of men who savagely beat her with heavy chains and then leave her for dead. She manages to crawl to the highway but dies. The following day, another young boy is found drowned in a local stream, which further increases police frustration about the case.\nDuring further meetings with Don Alberto, Martelli learns that Don Alberto's mother has a young child, a six-year-old deaf and mute girl with an intellectual disability.

When Juan arrives, John inducts him into the revolutionaries' ranks. The bank is hit as part of an orchestrated attack on the Mexican army. Juan, interested only in the bank's money, is shocked to find that it has no funds and is instead being used by the army as a political prison. John, Juan and his family end up freeing hundreds of prisoners, inadvertently (and against his wishes) causing Juan to become a \"great, grand, glorious hero of the revolution.\"\nThe revolutionaries are chased into the hills by an army detachment led by Colonel G\u00fcnther Reza. John and Juan volunteer to stay behind with two machine guns and dynamite. Much of the Mexican army's detachment is destroyed while crossing a bridge, which is blown up by John. Colonel Reza, who commands an armored car, survives. After the battle, John and Juan find most of their comrades, including Juan's father and children, have been killed by the army in a cave which served as the rebels' hideout. Grief-stricken and enraged, Juan goes out to fight the army single-handed and is captured. John sneaks into camp, where he witnesses executions of many of his fellow revolutionaries by firing squad. They had been informed on by Dr. Villega, who has been tortured by Colonel Reza and his men. This evokes in John memories of a similar betrayal by Nolan, his best friend in Ireland. After Nolan identified John, John killed two British soldiers and then killed Nolan, making him a fugitive and forcing him to flee Ireland. Juan faces a firing squad of his own, but John arrives and blows up the wall with dynamite just in time. They escape on John's motorcycle.\nJohn and Juan hide in the animal coach of a train. It stops to pick up the tyrannical Governor Don Jaime, who is fleeing (with a small fortune) from the revolutionary forces belonging to Pancho Villa and Emiliano Zapata. As the train is ambushed, John, as a test of Juan's loyalty, lets him choose between shooting the Governor and accepting a bribe from him. Juan kills Jaime, also stealing the Governor's spoils. As the doors to the coach open, Juan is greeted by a large crowd and once again is unexpectedly hailed as a great hero of the revolution. The money is taken away by revolutionary General Santerna.\nOn a train with commanders of the revolution, John and Juan are joined by Dr. Villega, who has escaped. John alone knows of Villega's betrayal. They learn that Pancho Villa's forces will be delayed by 24 hours and that an army train carrying 1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons, led by Colonel Reza, will be arriving in a few hours that evening, which will surely overpower the rebel position. John suggests they rig a locomotive with dynamite and send it head on. He requires one other man, but instead of picking Juan, who volunteers, he chooses Dr. Villega. It becomes clear to Villega that John knows of the betrayal, but John says he used to judge people but he doesn't anymore. John pleads with him to jump off the locomotive before it hits the army's train, but Villega feels guilty and stays on board. John jumps in time and the two trains collide and explode, killing Villega and a number of Mexican soldiers.\nThe revolutionaries' ambush is successful, but as John approaches to meet Juan, he is shot in the back by Colonel Reza. An enraged Juan guns down the Colonel with a machine gun. As John lies dying, he continues to have memories of Nolan, and of a young woman they both apparently loved. Juan kneels by his side to ask about Dr. Villega. John keeps the doctor's secret and tells Juan that he died a hero of the revolution. As Juan goes to seek help, the fatally wounded John, knowing his end is near, sets off a second charge he secretly laid in case the battle went bad. Horrified by his friend's sudden death, Juan stares at John's burning remains, before turning to the camera and asking forlornly, \"What about me?\"", "tmdb_id": 336}, "44977889": {"title": "I due gattoni a nove code... e mezza ad Amsterdam", "plot": "The journalist Ciccio and the photographer Franco are looking for a scoop, as they stumble by chance in the murder of a Dutch diamond dealer of which Franco immortalizes the fateful moment.

But despite the opportunity to run, he decides to stay and face the consequences. He is arrested by the police, charged, and brought before the court.\nSurjit acknowledges his guilt to the Judge, who in turn knows that he should send Surjit to prison for two years. But moved by the plight of Ram Din's family (which include his widow Malti; his sister Kamla; two young sons; a crippled father Ganga Din, and his blind mother) and his inherent belief that imprisonment does not serve the good for victim or the perpetrator, the Judge resolves to try a novel experiment of forcing Surjit to live with Ram Din's family and look after their financial needs. A horrified Surjit attempts in vain to convince the Judge to change his ruling. He is transported to his new \"prison\" under police protection, where he is met by hostile villagers.

The first story, \"The Heptagon\", opens on a somber note at the funeral of college student Johnny Davis. His friends Dave, Frank and Randy are in attendance at the burial. It is revealed that they played a seemingly innocent phone prank on Johnny, telling him to go to a certain address where a date was waiting. The old woman who lived at the address accidentally shot Johnny to death. As the funeral service ends, Johnny's mother (who is the seventh daughter of a seventh son) recites a cryptic message to the three young men she blames for the death of her son: \"One by land, two by sky...seven times around go the three of you, and may your reward be just and true.\" Later Frank relates this story to a priest, Father Duane, sitting next to him on a plane. He says that Dave was run over and killed seven days after the funeral. The priest tries to ease Frank's anxiety,  assuring him that it's all a coincidence. However, after Father Duane exits the plane, it crashes upon takeoff. On the runway Father Duane attempts to comfort a dying Frank, who tells him that exactly fourteen days have passed since Johnny's burial. The troubled priest\u2014beginning to suspect that there might be more to this pattern of deaths than mere chance\u2014speaks to his superior, who suggests telephoning the remaining young man at the state university. Father Duane tries to call Randy but instead reaches his roommate, who tells him that Randy has gone skydiving. It is now twenty-one days after Johnny's burial, the narrator reminds us, and according to Mrs. Davis's prophecy, two of the young men would perish by sky.\nThe second story, \"The Darkness\", is set in rural Missouri during the early twentieth century and involves the disappearance of a boy's dog in the vicinity of a mysterious hole in the ground. Concerned about the inexplicable moaning sounds coming from the hole, the boy's father agrees to be lowered in on a rope to see if he can recover the dog and to find out what's making the noise. Suddenly a terrifying scream emerges from the depths of the pit and the boy's father, now a raving lunatic, is hoisted back up. The mystery of the hole is never solved, and the story closes with the narrator's revelation that the father spent the rest of his life in an insane asylum.\nThe final segment, \"The Girl on the Bridge\", involves a strange disoriented girl and the Arkansas state senator who attempts to give her a ride home. Most of the story unfolds via the girl's flashbacks; as the senator and his wife arrive at the address the girl had given them, they find that she has mysteriously vanished from the back seat of the car. The girl's elderly father answers the door, telling the senator that his daughter died in a car accident many years earlier when she and her boyfriend were leaving town to get married. The father had disapproved of the relationship and told his daughter that he would rather see her dead.\nAccording to the opening narration, the stories are based on research conducted by Dr. Jonathan Rankin, a parapsychologist, but this is evidently a fictional device as no record of the name \"Jonathan Rankin\" exists in the annals of para-psychological research.

Michael fantasizes about one day building a new home on the plot of land and aims to one day have Santonix, a famed Italian architect whom he met through a client, design the home.\nWhile photographing Gypsy's Acre, Michael meets Ellie Thomsen, a young American visiting England, who is quickly taken by Michael's fantastical nature. While exploring the property, the two encounter Miss Townsend, a mysterious old woman who tells Michael that Gypsy's Acre is for sale, but that it is a cursed land. Ellie leaves England and embarks on the remainder of her trip through Switzerland and Italy with Greta, her German language tutor who has taken on the role of a personal assistant. In Ellie's absence, Michael learns that she is in fact one of the richest young women in the world. He confronts her about this when she returns to England, but she explains she did not want to tell him as she thought it would dissuade him from pursuing her. She also reveals that, while visiting Italy, she was able to arrange a meeting with Santonix about building Michael's dream home. Furthermore, she reveals she has purchased Gypsy's Acre.\nThough initially angered by her deceit, Michael eventually relents, and he and Ellie marry in Wales.

No one notices the incident, and the victim is unsure who was responsible due to the crowd gathered around her. The TV film editor studies the film with a colleague and remarks, \"but he's queer!\" Still photos of the incident fall into the hands of a highly unorthodox priest called Father Lucian, an old college friend of Puppis. He arranges a meeting with the bemused politician in a confessional booth and then demands blackmail money for the pictures. Puppis is furious but mystified, for he cannot remember anything about the incident. He leaves the confessional booth refusing to pay. That night, Puppis has a strange dream in which a naked young woman beckons him, superimposed over the circular plaza of St. Peter's Basilica and the Vatican.\nPuppis calls the unscrupulous Father Lucian and offers him the money. In return, Lucian offers to arrange a consultation with a German psychiatrist. During the session, Puppis describes his recent affliction: his dreams and waking thoughts are becoming obsessed with behinds, primarily female ones, despite his open preference for fey young men like his personal chauffeur Carmelino. Asses fill his thoughts and even precipitate black-outs, during which he commits terrible acts of bottom-pinching. \"We've got to lick this thing,\" says Father Lucian. Puppis leaves, vowing to maintain his self-control. But later that day, his hands wander while standing behind a young lady in an elevator at the Senate offices.\nThe next day, Puppis announces that he is going on a \"spiritual retreat\" until the results of the elections are announced. Father Lucian drives the frantic Puppis into the countryside, stopping at a filling station to get gas. Puppis experiences a veritable barrage of ladies' bottoms at the filling station forecourt. Before Father Lucian can stop him, Puppis has lurched over to one tartan-frocked figure bent over to examine the a car's engine, only to find himself face to face with a furious kilt-wearing Scotsman. Later that day, Lucian and Puppis finally arrive at a cloister run by his friend Father Schirer, a priest and psychiatrist. However, Puppis is blind drunk after consuming several bottles of liquor he bought at the rest stop. Father Schirer welcomes the esteemed patient and informs the barely conscious man that his many skilled nurses will help him. The clinic is staffed by nuns, all of them young and beautiful. That night, Father Schirer is woken up when one of the nurses assigned to watch over Puppis is grabbed on her bottom by the sleeping man. Father Schirer tells the nun that she must remain still until morning, as waking the patent would be too traumatic, under the circumstances.\nBack in Rome, Senator Puppis' absence is the subject of heated discussions. His political opponents to the more conservative Sen. Torsello have been bugging his telephone and are puzzled over coded conversations between Puppis and Father Lucian. But the Italian Army has been bugging the senate phones in the hope of learning something that will ensure the planned military coup stays on course. The Vatican secret police, led by the persistent Mafioso Don Gesualdo, have been bugging the Army's phones and learning about Puppi's mysterious exit. Cardinal Maravigili, an influential member of the clergy, which has the real power in Italy, is sitting in his office watching the film footage of Puppis at the airport. Cardinal Maravigili is enraged, for apparently, Puppis owes his political success to shady deals with the Vatican and military hierarchy. Maravigili, a manipulative sociopath willing to murder to facilitate divine will, has groomed Puppis for the position of president. Even Puppis' preference for men is tolerated because the Cardinal confides in Don Gesualdo that he prefers that Puppis should be homosexual, expecting minor scandal from this man than the customary womanizing of Italian politicians.\nAt the spiritual retreat, Puppis describes a dream to Father Schirer while under hypnosis, featuring the devout nurses at the clinic and visions of the Garden of Eden where foliage bursts with naked female bottoms. The next night, Puppis sleepwalks to Father Schirer's room and molests him while he is fast asleep. Protecting his vow of chastity, the priest/analyst wakes up the randy senator. Once fully awake, Puppis realizes his actions and professes to feel much better, claiming his dreams have liberated his mind. Puppis returns to Rome full of optimism about his cure the following morning. However, back at the clinic, when Father Schirer takes confession from the nuns, he discovers that Puppis' rampaging sexual dreams have been enacted for real. The libidinous sisters all recount sexual encounters with Puppis.\nAn angry Father Schirer arrives at Puppis' house and demands an explanation. He is forced to hide when Cardinal Maravigili comes unexpectedly to meet Puppis. Hiding in the bathroom in a shower cubicle, Father Schirer suffers a fatal heart attack when he thinks Cardinal Maravigili will walk in. Unaware of Schirer's sudden demise, Puppis leaves with Cardinal Maravigili to a garden party before celebrating the Italian Republic's founding. After experiencing erotic visions, Puppis swiftly seduces the French ambassador's wife in the bushes. Back at Puppis' house, Carmelino discovers the dead body of Father Schirer and rushes to tell Puppis, only to be grabbed and taken away by Don Gesualdo, leading the Vatican secret police.\nReturning home that evening, Puppis is met by Sister Hildergardt, the only one of the cloistered order not to have been ravished by him. Begging him to relieve her of temptation and simultaneously scolding him for wickedness, she implores that they whip each for their sins. Just as the twisted couple gets down to it, the Vatican thugs arrive. Puppis and Sister Hildergardt escape through a back window.\nHiding out in a secluded motel room, Puppis and Sister Hildegarde are tracked down, and Don Gesualdo and his thugs take her away. Cardinal Maravigli confronts Puppis in the motel room, and he tells the Cardinal that he wants out of politics. But the Cardinal replies that there will be none of that talk. Too much time and effort have been expended behind the scenes to hoist Puppis into position. The Cardinal takes Puppis into the bowels of the Vatican to view waxworks of recently canonized saints. They include Carmelino and Father Lucian, as well as Father Schirer. The threat to Puppis is made explicit when he is told to look carefully at an unfinished rough wax model. Staring at the shapeless features, Puppis imagines a waxwork of himself. When Senator Torsello dies the next day in a \"plane crash,\" Puppis is declared the winner of the election by default.\nAt a ceremony to accept his appointment as president of Italy, Puppis genuflects before a wax statue of Sister Hildegarde. Puppis knows that his political position trapped him with the corrupt Vatican thugs whom he now can never escape. \"The new president is remarkably religious,\" whispers an onlooker to another. As Puppis, the new chief of state, gives his inaugural address on live TV, a customer in a local bar switches off the televised ceremony who chooses instead to watch a foolish game show on the next channel.", "tmdb_id": 30552}, "24381277": {"title": "Escape to the Sun", "plot": "A group of people wish to flee the Soviet Union to escape anti-semitism and political repression, but their activities soon attract the attention of the KGB secret police.", "tmdb_id": 659524}, "37550180": {"title": "Every Little Crook and Nanny", "plot": "Vito Garbugli and Mario Azzecca, the bumbling lawyers of mob boss Carmine Ganucci, evict Nanny Poole, a British etiquette teacher, in order to secure her studio as a bookie joint. They then struggle to find a nanny for Ganucci's son Lewis, who will be left alone while Ganucci and his wife Stella visit Naples, Italy. When Nanny bursts into the office to complain about her eviction, Ganucci, impressed with her accent, hires her despite her protests that she is not a child's nursemaid. Realizing Ganucci is a gangster despite Vito and Mario's insistence that \"There's no such thing as the mafia,\" Nanny accepts the job, but plots with her pianist Luther to kidnap Lewis and demand a $50,000 ransom with which she can set up a new studio. In Naples, Ganucci tries to avoid work and tells Stella that Nanny will lend class to Lewis, whom he hopes will grow up with no connection to the mafia. Despite Ganucci's wishes, Lewis is at that moment pretending to be a mafia boss and groping Nanny, who handles him with aplomb. Luther, who believes Ganucci is a retired soft drink manufacturer, bumbles his way through a break-in and absconds with Lewis, who calmly stops to put on the watch his father gave him. Ganucci has told Nanny to call Benny Napkins, one of his flunkies, in case of trouble, so she now advises him of the \"kidnapping.\" Benny, a cowardly young man, is easily convinced by Nanny to keep the matter quiet and try to raise the ransom money himself. Meanwhile, two con men in Italy persuade Ganucci to purchase some gold medallions for $50,000, and he wires Vito and Mario for the money. The lawyers deliberate endlessly over how to send the money, finally deciding to send Benny to Naples with a bundle of cash. Luther has brought Lewis to his home, where his wife Ida dotes on the boy and asks Luther to have children with her. He declines, referring to his tortured relationship with his father and the fact that he is a \"genetic failure.\" Later, Nanny interrupts Benny as he is trying to make love to his girl friend, who refuses to stop watching TV. They return to Ganucci's house, where Stella calls to talk to Lewis. Nanny's composure while deflecting Stella's questions impresses Benny, who kisses her with passion. Desperate to raise the ransom, Benny robs a poker game, but when he wanders the town with his stocking mask still on, he is arrested and the money is confiscated. Nanny bails him out, bathes him and puts him to bed, where he asks her to retire with him to his cottage in the country. After they make love, Mario knocks on the door and gives Benny $50,000 to deliver to Naples. Nanny is thrilled but Benny points out that it is not their money. Meanwhile, the police, realizing that Benny works for Ganucci, return the confiscated money to Vito, who, believing it is the same $50,000 that Mario delivered to Benny, returns the money to Benny's house. Now holding two envelopes containing $50,000 each, Benny breaks down in confusion and tells Nanny he is just an organization man and cannot use Ganucci's money without his approval. Disappointed, she leaves. Taking matters into her own hands, Nanny tells Mario and Vito about the kidnapping, but as soon as they give her the ransom, they hear from Ganucci that he is returning from Italy, and confident that their boss can handle the matter himself, take the money back. At the same time, Dominick, a petty thief, breaks into Luther's house and steals Lewis' watch as the child sleeps. Benny is at his friend's bar when Dominick enters and tries to use the watch as barter. When Dominick reads aloud the inscription on the watch, Benny realizes Dominick robbed the house in which Lewis is being held, and demands that Dominick take him there. They go to Luther's apartment, where Luther has just learned that Lewis is indeed Ganucci's son, and, panicked, is planning to return him to his father. Ida, however, refuses to let Lewis go and escapes with him out the window just as Nanny shows up to bring the boy home. As Nanny and Luther leave to track down Ida, Benny breaks in but, finding the apartment empty, decides to send Dominick to Nanny with one of the $50,000 envelopes so she can pay the ransom. He then leaves for the airport to fly to Naples with the other envelope, while at that moment Nanny and Luther are racing to the airport to flee to London, and Ganucci is arriving at the airport from Italy. When Ganucci deplanes, he sees Benny and takes the money from him, having decided not to buy the medallions. Upon leaving, he then happens upon Nanny, who claims to have come to greet the Ganuccis. Luther, introduced as Lewis' new piano teacher, and Nanny drive home with the Ganuccis, trembling with fear that the couple will soon find their son missing. Unknown to them, however, Ida has returned Lewis to his home. Later that night, as Nanny puts Lewis to bed, the boy arrogantly informs her he knows she was behind the kidnapping and plans to tell his father. Nanny immediately calls in Ganucci, knowing he will consider Lewis' story a fabrication, and as she has planned, he counsels his son to be honest and \"classy.\" Afterward, Nanny kisses Lewis and tells him he must become his own man and not try to emulate his tough father.

Yet to arrive is Julia Dawson, an actress who has recently forged a film career.\nWith local hotels closed due to it being the off-season, the cast are required to stay in the theatre during rehearsals. On the first night, Carol and Tony spend the night together, leaving Jane to room with Angela, who makes sexual advances toward her, which John witnesses.

Mike finds Angela's severed head in the basement, along with her body, which lay on a prop guillotine. Mike keeps his discovery a secret from the others. Later, a gloved individual fondles Angela's severed head. Mike summons local police to investigate, but when they arrive, they find several mannequin heads, but no sight of Angela's body.

Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos and is dismayed to see that Fredo is more loyal to Greene than to his own family.\nIn 1955, Vito dies of a heart attack while playing with his grandchild. At Vito's funeral, Tessio asks Michael to meet with Barzini, signaling his betrayal. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby.

Michael extracts Carlo's confession to playing a part in Sonny's murder, assuring Carlo he is only being exiled, not murdered; afterward, Clemenza garrotes Carlo to death. Connie confronts Michael about Carlo's death while Kay is in the room. Kay asks Michael if Connie is telling the truth and is relieved when he denies it.

Wermeer is holed up in Gila Bend by a swarm of bounty killers, who want his $3,000 reward, posted by Saxon's three sons David, Eli and Adam. A sheriff named Clayton arrives on a stagecoach and bosses his way through the cordon set up by the local lawmen. While walking to the saloon, he performs actions that tip off Wermeer as to where some of the besiegers are hidden (like throwing a lit match so a man hidden in hay has to put it out). Wermeer makes it to the saloon, where Clayton, who has counted Wermeer's shots and knows that he is out of bullets, arrests him. Hole, a spokesman for the bounty killers, calls on Wermeer to surrender. A shot rings out and Clayton emerges dragging the \"dead\" convict. They argue that Clayton is a sheriff and therefore he cannot collect bounty, and that he instead should give up the body. The disagreement develops into a gunfight. Wermeer jumps up on a horse and escapes, pursued by the pack (though not Clayton). Wermeer makes the bounty hunters follow his horse, then hitches a ride with the stagecoach, where he finds Clayton among the passengers.\nWhen the group stay the night at Silver Bells, Wermeer goes for a shotgun hanging on the wall, but Clayton stops him. A drunken stationmaster assures the gun is empty, but Clayton retorts: \"Never consider a gun empty\". Then he and Wermeer play cards, Wermeer betting his $3,000 bounty. Wermeer wins and Clayton promises to take him to Saxon city as he wants. Wermeer steals a revolver from Clayton's bag, but is told that it is empty. Wermeer repeats Clayton's earlier saying and pulls the trigger, but Clayton shows him the bullet, taking it out of his mouth. Wermeer tries to leave, but Clayton shoots the door, this time with the other five bullets. Meanwhile, the bounty hunters led by Hole surround the house. They give Wermeer thirty seconds. He and Clayton are inside with Elisabeth, a female passenger who has earlier shown interest in Wermeer. Clayton tells her that Wermeer is innocent and that he saw who did it, but if Wermeer walks out the door he will never know. Wermeer gives himself up. Hole and two of the bounty hunters now kill the others in their pack, then ride off with Wermeer.\nClayton finds them beating and questioning Wermeer in a waterfall, asking where the silver of his father is and offering to let him go if he tells. Clayton shoots off the rope and liberates him. Wermeer asks if he is still a prisoner. When Clayton says no, he holds a gun against Clayton and rides off to Saxon city on the latter's horse. After arriving Wermeer confronts the Saxon sons, Adam and Eli. He accuses Eli (who is the town's sheriff) and asks who killed his father. We also learn that Hole was sent by Eli to find out who really killed the old man Saxon. Clayton arrives and demands that the Saxons reopen Wermeer's case. Wermeer sends word to his friends and people loyal to his father to gather at the silver mine. A duel between Hole and Wermeer is supervised by Clayton after he reveals that it was Hole who killed Wermeer's father, following orders from Ebenezer Saxon. An ambusher is there helping Hole, but Wermeer shoots him without Clayton interfering. (In a German-language version, the dying Hole says he killed Wermeer because the latter refused to share the silver.)\nDavid Saxon, the oldest of the brothers and the one responsible of running the town, orders Adam to stop the people heading to the silver mine. Shortly after, Adam massacres Wermeer's followers with hidden explosives and a machine gun. He also kills his own men, following his brother David's instructions to not leave any witnesses. Meanwhile David meets with Clayton, who says that they both know who killed the old man Saxon. David offers $25.000 if he and Wermeer leave town. Clayton relays the offer that the charge will be dropped. Wermeer replies that the Saxons made the offer because \"dead people don't need a leader\", and reveals the wagon in which he carries the bodies of those killed by Adam. Adam shoots him from a window, though Elisabeth, who arrived in town to marry Adam, cries out a warning. Clayton escapes during the gunfight.\nIn the morning, Wermeer is to be hanged. Clayton says he knows who is the real killer. David wants the hanging to continue but Eli says that he must know. Clayton confesses that he himself did it, explaining that Ebenezer Saxon killed Wermeer's father, and that David Saxon bought the judge who sentenced Philip Wermeer and stripped Clayton of his title of Sheriff after he stood in trial to declare him innocent, so justice could only be done \"the Saxon way\". Clayton also denounces the massacre at the silver mine, and the Saxons agree to meet Clayton at the cattle pens. At the confrontation, when Clayton approaches, David says that the three must draw first to overcome Clayton's faster and expert gunplay. Wermeer, from a distance, shoots off Clayton's hat so that he draws first. It works and Clayton reacts by killing the three men and only getting a small wound.

Hugh comes home, finding Cathryn in distress. As Hugh attempts to comfort her, Cathryn witnesses a different man who is behaving as if he were her husband. She screams in horror and backs away, only to see her vision of the figure revert to her husband.\nHugh attributes her outburst to stress and her pregnancy. He decides to take her on a vacation to an isolated cottage in the Irish countryside, where Cathryn can work on her book and take photographs for its illustrations. Immediately upon her arrival, however, Cathryn hears voices saying her name and sees strange apparitions: While preparing lunch one day, she sees her husband Hugh pass through the kitchen, then transform into her dead lover, Rene. Rene continues to appear to her around the house, and even speaks with her.\nCathryn's paranoia and visions become increasingly pervasive, and are exacerbated when a local neighbor and ex-lover, Marcel, brings his adolescent daughter, Susannah, to visit. Cathryn becomes unable to distinguish Hugh from Rene or Marcel, as the men shift before her eyes. One day, Rene taunts Cathryn, asking her to kill him if she wants rid of him, and hands her a shotgun. She shoots him through the abdomen; Susannah, startled by the gunshot, runs into the house, and finds Cathryn standing in the den, having shot Hugh's camera to pieces. Cathryn claims the gun accidentally fired when she was moving it.\nSeeking solace, Cathryn goes to a nearby waterfall, where she often sees her doppelg\u00e4nger staring back at her.

The next morning, she encounters a local elderly man walking his dog, and invites him to come inside for coffee, in spite of the fact that Marcel's corpse apparently lies in the living room (which suggests that she regards the \"murder\" as a hallucination, like her shooting of Rene); the old man declines the invitation. Later in the evening, Susannah stops by the house, and remarks that her father was not at home when she awoke that morning. Cathryn is alarmed by this, as it could mean that she really did kill Marcel. She is relieved to hear that Marcel did return drunk after midnight, and invites Susannah in for a cup of tea after reasoning that Marcel cannot be dead on her living room floor. Susannah asks Cathryn if she looked like her when she was young before ominously saying, \"I'm going to be exactly like you.\"\nAfter having tea, Cathryn drives Susannah back home.

Rajesh tries to dissuade her from lying and when she refuses to listen to him, he angrily tells her that she should hire a husband too, if she could hire a house and car and leaves. So Kalpana asks her friend's brother to feign to be her husband for two days and he hesitantly agrees. Kaplana's parents buy everything, though they feel things are chaotic. They attribute it to the inexperience of their daughter and lack of domestic help. On the other side, Rajesh feels quite ashamed of abandoning his wife and returns. When he learns of the arrangements, he settles there as domestic help.\nNow, the comedy of errors revolves around the bungalow for the next two days with Kalpana, Rajesh and Kalpana's fake husband, who is about to marry Kalpana's other friend within two days. Things go normally till two days later, when Kalpana's parents announce that they want to continue the stay to spend more time with their grandchild and make him their heir. Their landlord, and people who gave the car and furniture on rent come to retrieve them. Moreover, Kalpana's cousin who expected that he would inherit property becomes bitter and kidnaps the child.

Just as things are looking up, Billie is arrested for possession of narcotics and removed from the clinic.\nIn prison, Billie goes through crippling withdrawal.

She runs away, bizarrely jogging backwards while keeping him constantly in her line of sight.\nThe Kurokawa clan are waiting for Itt\u014d.

Daigoro, still in the cart, activates blades hidden inside the cart's rolling axles, which slice off the feet of several of the clan. A fierce battle ensues, and Itt\u014d is injured before he has silenced them all.\nWeary from the endless fighting, Itt\u014d struggles along the road and eventually finds shelter in a shack.

He does not intend to rape her. Instead, he is seeking to get her out of her own cold, wet clothing, while clinging to her and Daigoro. \"Three people are warmer than two\", he unemotionally explains. She considers taking his sword and killing him, but the cozy, now warming scene, with Daigoro sitting between them and playfully fondling her breast, makes her abandon the plan.\nOn a vast area of sand dunes, the Hidari brothers are at the head of a caravan of men carrying a palanquin with the turncoat indigo expert riding inside. The brother with the iron claw runs forward and thrusts his claw into the sand, which boils up with blood. There are men hiding in dunes, as he digs his claw into the sand several more times, each time creating a pool of blood and pulling up a hiding swordsman by his head. The rest of the hidden men emerge from the sand to fight, but the three brothers easily dispatch them all.\nItt\u014d now awaits, alone, atop a large dune. Each brother is killed by him in a high-pressure spray of blood, with the last brother eliminated with a lethal strike along his throat, a cut that sprays arterial blood in a fine mist while making a sound like the \"howling of the wind\". The final Hidari brother says that such a fabled finishing stroke is called the \"Mogaribue\", wishing that the sound had come from one of his own victims. Instead, it is now coming from his own neck as his life slowly drains away.\nItt\u014d approaches the palanquin holding the indigo expert and quickly finishes him before gathering up Daigoro and setting off again. They are now out of the desert and on a coastal trail, followed closely by Sayaka. Aware of her presence, Itt\u014d stops the cart, looking straight ahead while holding out his outstretched dotanuki blade. Sayaka is holding a katana.

After entering another temple, he sees a figure at the altar praying, but it is not his father. Rather, it is a man whom Daigoro immediately recognizes as someone who is unfriendly. The man sees something in Daigoro's eyes that alerts him to follow the boy when he leaves the temple.\nDaigoro wanders into a grass field as it is being lit on fire by farmers to prepare the ground for next year's growing season. Unwittingly, he is surrounded by the flames, but Daigoro proves resourceful by burying himself in the mud in order to survive.\nThe man has been following behind and turns his sword on Daigoro, who raises a stick to defend himself, In that instant the man realizes Daigoro is not just any child, but the son of Ogami Itt\u014d.\nItt\u014d arrives pushing the baby cart, and the two ronin recognize each other. The man, it turns out is Gunbei Yagy\u016b, the outcast son of Retsudo Yagy\u016b. Gunbei and Itto had competed for the post of Shogun's executioner, and Gunbei's fierce swordsmanship surely would have won him the post, but in his over zealousness, he ends up pointing his sword at the Shogun, a taboo sword movement that costs him the job and makes him an outcast.\nItt\u014d and Gunbei now have their rematch, but Itt\u014d is much improved and is more than ready for Gunbei. With a swift stroke, he chops off Gunbei's right arm. Gunbei then begs Itt\u014d to kill him, but he refuses, saying there is nothing to be gained from slaying a man who is already dead.\nWith Gunbei out of the way and father and son reunited, Itt\u014d turns to finding the tattooed killer, Oyuki. He first stops at a settlement of street actors and other performers, of which Oyuki was said to be a member. He talks to the elder and hears more of her story, and it happens that the elder is Oyuki's father, who is opposed to her actions, and cooperates with Itt\u014d.\nItt\u014d finally locates Oyuki at an isolated hot spring and witnesses her in action against more vassals who have come to try to kill her. Then her nemesis, her former instructor who raped her and set her on her bloody vendetta, shows up with his flaming sword and blazing hypnotic eyes. But Oyuki is no longer held in his sway, and when she reveals her shocking tattoos to him, he is distracted and quickly killed by her.\nFinally, Itt\u014d and Oyuki must duel, and he makes quick work of her. She dies an honorable death, as Itt\u014d says, \"without having to disrobe\".\nRetsudo Yagy\u016b, meanwhile, has been playing politics. He manipulates a local daimy\u014d into bringing in Itt\u014d, but he is able to use the baby cart's various hidden weapons to escape from the compound and take the daimy\u014d hostage. As Itt\u014d is leaving the area with the daimyo, he is attacked by the Yagy\u016b. The daimy\u014d is killed by Yagy\u016b musketeers and Itt\u014d plunges headlong into battle with their many swordsmen, telling his son Daigoro that he is entering the \"crossroads to hell\". It is a fierce battle, ending with only Itt\u014d and Retsudo in final combat. They trade sword blows and Retsudo gets a blade thrust into his right eye and Itt\u014d a sword in his back. Itt\u014d easily dispatches the swordsman who stabs him, but Retsudo gets away.\nDaigoro finds Itt\u014d, who commands him to pull the sword from his back. Despite being severely wounded, Itt\u014d carries Daigoro to the cart and slowly pushes it away. Watching over the scene from a distance is the now one-armed Gunbei, who is happy to see the master swordsman live to fight another day. He vows someday to be the one who will dispatch Itt\u014d to hell.", "tmdb_id": 41477}, "5672172": {"title": "Lone Wolf and Cub: Baby Cart to Hades", "plot": "Ogami Itt\u014d, the disgraced former sh\u014dgun's executioner or Kogi Kaishakunin, is traveling by river on a boat with his young son Daigoro floating behind in the baby cart. A young woman at the front of the boat, clearly distraught, accidentally drops a bundle into the water, which Daigoro retrieves for her. Itt\u014d, draws his sword partway and notices in the reflection on the blade that some bamboo reeds are trailing the boat, meaning that Itt\u014d is being followed by operatives of his mortal enemy, the Yagy\u016b Clan. Later, as Daigoro is relieving himself in a bamboo glade, Itt\u014d slices at several tall bamboo stalks, causing hidden ninja assassins to fall from their elevated perches and to be bloodily killed by him.\nA group of four watari-kashi (wandering lower-class hired fighters, working from one daimy\u014d to the next), are idling along the road at a rest stop. Hot and bored, they spy an attractive young woman and her mother being escorted by a servant. Three of them run to take advantage of the women, but one of their band, Kanbei, a r\u014dnin (a samurai who has lost his retainership) and the more honorable of the four, remains. The three knock the escort unconscious and proceed to rape the two women. The servant regains consciousness and is furious when he sees the triad violating his mistresses. He attempts to beat them with his bamboo pole, but is slain by Kanbei, who also slays the two women in order to silence them. Kanbei makes his three companions draw straws, saying the one who draws the short straw will be killed in order to take the blame for the rapes and murders.\nItt\u014d happens upon this grim scene as Kanbei is slaying the losing watari-kashi. Itt\u014d kills the other two rapists when they attempt to attack him because he can speak to their crimes. Kanbei recognizes Itt\u014d and requests a duel now that Itt\u014d is involved. Itt\u014d accepts, and they prepare to fight, but at the last second Itt\u014d re-sheathes his sword and calls it a draw. Kanbei is left to ponder why fate will not let him die honorably as he would like.\nAt an inn, it turns out that the young woman from the boat is to be sold into prostitution.  Her pimp tries to have his way with her, but she accidentally bites the tip of his tongue off while resisting and the pimp dies from shock. The girl seeks refuge in Itt\u014d's room, who steps in to protect her from the local officials. But the town's real authorities show up, the yakuza, led by a pistol-wielding woman named Torizo, from the Koshio clan. Itt\u014d agrees to act as a substitute for the young woman and undergo buri-buri (literally \"angrily\"), a form of torture that involves the subject being hogtied and hung in the air and repeatedly dunked headfirst into a tub of water, then beaten to unconsciousness by men wielding thick rattan canes. Itt\u014d endures the torture with his typical stoicism. This frees the young woman from becoming a prostitute.\nTorizo asks and Itt\u014d agrees to meet a one-armed man who turns out to be Miura Tatewaki, former first retainer of the Kakegawa clan, whom Itt\u014d recognizes from the time he had to execute the insane daimy\u014d Kakegawa Ujishige. Miura was forced to restrain the struggling daimyou to make him stay still, sacrificing his arm in the process to Itt\u014d's precise killing stroke. Torizo is, in fact, Miura's own daughter, Miura Tori, who because of the taboo of her being a twin was secretly raised by the Koshio clan. The Miuras want Itt\u014d to kill Sawatari Genba, who sold out the Kakegawa clan to become governor of the district of Totomi. He is also the man responsible for her sister's death and the fall of the Kakegawa clan and its 400 retainers.\nSawatari wants to hire Itt\u014d to kill visiting minister Itakura, but he refuses. While giving the slip to Sawatari's retainers, Itt\u014d is attacked by Yagyu ninjas, who have had been following him. The next day, Itt\u014d has to face the governor's personal bodyguards, one of whom is a sharpshooter and quick-draw artist who wields a pair of American revolvers. With the help of his young son Daigoro, who acts as a decoy, Itt\u014d kills the sharpshooter, taking his pistols. The other bodyguard is dispatched in a sword duel.\nItt\u014d's battle culminates in his facing the governor's army, perhaps 200 men, singlehandedly.  For the first time, the baby cart is revealed as holding an entire arsenal of weaponry, including spears, daggers, a bullet-proof shield, and a small battery of guns. All of the governor's men are killed, as Itt\u014d first kills half of them with the baby cart's firepower and the rest with his sword and other weapons. The governor is the last to die when Itt\u014d, losing his sword as he falls down an embankment, takes out the sharpshooter's pistols and shoots him.\nWord of the coming fight has been passed to neighboring districts, and the r\u014dnin Kanbei appears just after Itt\u014d has slain the governor, and again demands a duel. Though battle-weary, this time Itt\u014d accepts. The fight is over in an instant: Itt\u014d is sliced across his back, but Kanbei is mortally wounded, impaled on Itt\u014d's D\u014dtanuki katana.\nAs Kanbei dies, he tells Itt\u014d the story of why he became a r\u014dnin: When his master's convoy was ambushed, Kanbei, seeing his forces outnumbered, seized an opportunity and ran ahead to attack the enemy head on, surprising them, and saving the lord's life. However, because he had left his lord's side, he was dishonored and expelled from the clan. When Kanbei asks what is the true \"Way of the Warrior\", and if he had done wrong by attacking, Itt\u014d replies that Bushido is not to simply live or die but to live through death. He confirms that he would have acted just as Kanbei had. The dying Kanbei asks the former Kogi Kaishakunin to act as his \"second\" during his seppuku, which Itt\u014d is honored to do.\nAs Itt\u014d leaves, pushing the cart holding Daigoro, Torizo, who had been watching everything from a distance, begins to run after him.

A sashimono banner hangs off his back: \"Ogami: Suiouryo technique. Sword For Hire. Son For Hire.\" His services are asked for in a most unexpected way, when an insane woman seizes Daigoro from the cart and tries to breastfeed the boy. Daigoro at first hesitates, but after a stern look from his father, he proceeds to suckle the woman's breast. The woman's mother then apologizes for her daughter's behavior and tries to give Itt\u014d money, but the stoic r\u014dnin refuses, saying his son was hungry anyway.\nAs he walks in the rain, he remembers another rainy day two years earlier when his wife, Asami, was slain by three former samurai, ostensibly in revenge for Itt\u014d's execution of their young daimy\u014d, but Itt\u014d soon deduces that it is really a complex plot by the \"Shadow\" Yagy\u016b clan, which controls the sh\u014dgun's spies and assassins, to frame Itt\u014d for treason and take over the executioner's post. He winds up cutting down a senior member of the Yagy\u016b and his men when they show up to finish him as well.\nNow a wandering assassin-for-hire, Itt\u014d takes a job from the chamberlain of a rural clan to kill the members of a conspiracy to assassinate the chamberlain's lord and replace him with their own preferred successor. The chamberlain plans to test Itt\u014d, but a quick slash behind his back with his D\u014dtanuki sword dispatches the chamberlain's two men. The targets are in a remote mountain village that is home to hot-spring spa pools.\nAs Itt\u014d pushes the baby cart, and Daigoro observes scenes of nature, such as a dog suckling her puppy, and two children singing a song and bouncing a ball, Itt\u014d thinks back again to the time just after his wife was killed. He gave Daigoro a choice between a toy ball or the sword. If the child chose the ball, Itt\u014d would put him to death so he could join his mother \u2013 which he secretly hopes for. Instead, the curious child reaches for the sword \u2013 he has chosen to take the path of the r\u014dnin with his father, which Itt\u014d describes as living like demons at the crossroads to hell.\nThe episode takes one more trip back to the past: Refusing to accept death, Itt\u014d forces the leader of the \"Shadow\" Yagy\u016b, Retsudo, to allow him to duel the clan's best swordsman with a promise that he and Daigoro will be permitted to become ronin if he wins. Itt\u014d beheads the swordsman by strapping a mirror to Daigoro's forehead, allowing him to blind his opponent with sunlight.\nEventually, Itt\u014d reaches the hot-spring village. He finds that the conspirators have hired a band of ronin who have taken over the town and are raping, looting, and pillaging. As his targets have not yet arrived, Itt\u014d is forced to give up his sword and join several other travelers who have been taken hostage. The ronin leaders discuss killing Itt\u014d and try to provoke him, but then decide to let him live if he will have sex with a fellow hostage, a prostitute, while they watch. The prostitute refuses to have any part in it, but when her life is threatened, Itt\u014d steps forward and disrobes, saying he will do the men's bidding with the woman.\nWhen Itt\u014d finally reveals his true identity to the ronin after they meet with the conspirators, he pulls out various edged weapons hidden in the baby cart, including a naginata and a throwing dagger, and quickly slaughters the ronin in a gruesome, ruthless manner. A conspirator tries to shoot him with twin matchlock pistols, but Itt\u014d quickly upturns the baby cart, which is revealed to be armored underneath, and when the gunman's pistols are empty, Itt\u014d quickly leaps over the baby cart and brings his blade down on the man's forehead, splitting it in two. He then stops the final conspirator from fleeing and slices his chest open with his sword.\nItt\u014d leaves the village. The prostitute, having developed feelings for him and his son, tries to follow, but Itt\u014d makes a motion to cut the ropes on the bridge leading to town to stop her from following.

Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a man named The Once-ler, a man in dark green-colored gloves whose face is never seen. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.\nThe land once thrived with Truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage were the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who ate Truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond lived the Humming Fish, and  the Swomee Swans flew overhead. The trees amazed the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon built a small shop in the area. After cutting down a Truffula tree, the Lorax popped out of its stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demanded to know what the Once-ler was doing. The Once-ler explained that he was using the Truffula tree's tufts to make something called a \"Thneed... a fine something that all people need\". He insisted that he was only cutting one tree down and causing no harm, but when the Thneed sold quickly, the Once-ler began cutting down Truffula trees en masse to make more Thneeds. It is also noted that the Truffula tree grows extremely slowly\u2014ten years before the seed even becomes a sapling and at least ten years after that to grow to maturity\u2014making farming the tree impractical. Soon, he called his relatives to help him grow his thriving business into a boomtown. As the Lorax protested against the Once-ler's actions, a bulldozer picked up the Truffula tree where he stood and the Lorax was thrown into a truck with the Truffula tree and caught in an assembly line.\nSome time later, at a major celebration, everybody reminisced about how Thneeds, Inc. started and how famous the Once-ler had become and how it had diversified, showing \"Once-ler Cones\", \"Once-ler Burgers\", a \"Once-lermobile\" and a blimp advertising Thneeds, then a stone with the word \"Thneed\" carved in it. Shortly after Thneeds, Inc. had produced its millionth product, the Lorax got out of the box and, despite his protests, fell back into the box to be shipped off with more finished Thneeds. All the while, the air was becoming increasingly polluted and darker as the industrialization progressed, the countless accumulated garbage was being dumped in rivers, and the few remaining Truffula trees were wilting.\nThe Lorax continued to fight the Once-Ler. By this point the Lorax had to send the starving Brown Bar-ba-loots out of the area in search of food. After this, the Once-ler had his first bout with a guilty conscience; he justified his doubts by remarking \"But if I didn't do them, then someone else would\". The Lorax then protested that the smog was suffocating the Swomee Swans, preventing them from singing, and thus the Lorax also had to send them away. The Once-ler protested that closing the factory would put countless employees out of work; the Lorax conceded that he had no answer to that. Finally, the pond that was home to the Humming Fish was filled with viscous toxic waste clogging the fish's gills and rivaling Lake Erie; they too were sent away over dry land. Confronted by the Lorax, the Once-ler appeared to be ready to act, until his secretary announced that the company's stock had shot upward. The elated Once-ler flipped from empathy to defiance, vowing to ramp up production even further\u2014until at that moment, with the sound of an ax, the last remaining tree was cut down. With no raw materials, the factory was forced to close anyway, and the Once-ler's relatives all sadly departed. The Lorax glared at the Once-ler before he lifted himself by the seat of his pants, and disappeared through a tiny hole in the smog. On the spot where the Lorax last stood sits a small pile of rocks, with a word carved into one of them: \"Unless\".\nThe tale then switches back to the Once-ler talking to the boy. The Once-ler finally figures out that the word \"Unless\" was actually meant for whoever listened to the story and \"cares a whole awful lot\" to undo the damage the Once-ler caused. The Once-ler gives the boy the last Truffula seed and encourages him to help revitalize the long-dead trees by growing a brand new forest, with the possibility that the Lorax and all of his friends may then come back.

Hans Epp, an ordinary but likable man, returns home after spending several years in the French Foreign Legion. He is berated by his mother (\"The good die young, and people like you come back\", she says after hearing about the death of the young friend Hans had taken to the army with him).\nHans works as a fruit peddler, calling out his products and diligently making his rounds through the residential streets. Short and stocky, he is married to the slim and taller Irmgard, who helps him with his work. They have a small daughter, Renate. One day Hans sells fruit to an attractive married woman in an apartment building. She asks him to deliver the pears in person and invites him in, but he refuses, saying \"some other time.\" The woman is the great love of Hans's life since his youth. When the suspicious Irmgard questions why it took so long, he escapes her incessant complaints by abandoning his cart and going into a nearby bar. Soon, the sad ritual of his empty existence emerges: arguing with his wife, drinking excessively, lamenting lost personal and professional opportunities. While in the bar, Hans gets sentimental about his golden days as a policeman. In a flashback, he recalls how one day he brought a prostitute to the police station to take a statement, but she lured him into having oral sex. Caught by his superior, this incident got him fired.\nIrmgard appears at the bar to fetch him, but a drunk Hans says he will come home when he wants to. When his wife does not leave fast enough, he throws a chair at her. Finally Hans comes home intoxicated. Irmgard calls him a pig and he beats her up in front of their little daughter. The next morning, Irmgard has disappeared and Hans is desperate.\nIrmgard, fleeing with Renate, finds support with Hans' family. His contemptuous bourgeois mother has always disdained Hans, as she favors her obedient married daughter Heidi and tolerates her outspoken college student daughter Anna. When Hans once dreamed of being a mechanic, his mother demanded that he keep on studying and forbid him from taking a job that would get his hands dirty. Irmgard complains to her in-laws that Hans attacked her the night before. Heidi and her husband agree with the mother that Hans has always been good for nothing. Anna is the lone relative sympathetic to him, saying his family has always despised him and never gave him a proper chance. When Hans arrives, he tries to reconcile with his wife, but Irmgard retreats to a corner of the living room screaming in terror while the brother-in-law stands in front of her. The two men struggle while Irmgard phones a lawyer, saying she wants a divorce. When she puts down the receiver, Hans begins to sing his favorite tune: \"Buona, buona notte, you can't have everything you want.\" Then he has a heart attack.\nWhile Hans is recuperating in a hospital bed, his wife lets herself be picked up by a man in the street and takes him home to bed. But her little daughter catches them having sex, after which Irmgard sobs incessantly. At the hospital, Hans and his wife reconcile; she promises to stay with him. Once he is back home and as they are about to have sex, Irmgard explains that sometimes she finds him funny because he is much shorter than she is and that she only grew interested in him in the first place because he was so comical.\nAfter his heart attack, Hans can neither work nor drink, so Irmgard takes a larger role in the business. No longer able to push the cart around, Hans hires a hard-working and honest assistant, Anzell. He is the same man with whom, unknown to Hans, Irmgard had the brief affair during his hospitalization. Fearing exposure of her indiscretion, she manipulates Anzell into overpricing the produce and afterwards sharing the extra earnings with her. He agrees, but Irmgard knows he will be found out because her husband spies on Anzell when he goes through the courtyards. It happens as planned and Anzell is fired in disgrace, but Hans knows of Irmgard's infidelity.\nWhile dining with a friend, Hans is reunited with Harry, a close friend from his years in the Foreign Legion who now waits tables, and immediately offers him a job. Soon Hans suggests to his wife that Harry move in with them. She protests, but Hans insists. Harry proves to be an industrious worker who takes the cart through the streets and earns more than Hans did. Irmgard tends a fruit stand while Hans sulks with too much time on his hands. Though Harry's professionalism and dedication bring Hans' business profitability and success, they also render Hans obsolete in his own life, leading him further into isolation and despair.\nIn his depression, Hans revisits the great love of his life. In his youth, he courted her with an armful of red roses, but she turned him down because her parents did not want her to marry a fruit peddler. Though married to someone else, she undresses for casual sex, but he leaves. When Hans visits Anna, his favorite sister, she is busy with her studies and has no time for him.\nThe doctor says large quantities of alcohol would be fatal for Hans because of his bad heart, and in the end, Hans deliberately goes to his regular bar. While drinking, he remembers an incident when he was in the Foreign Legion in Morocco. Captured and tortured by an Arab, he was saved by his comrades at the last minute though he really wanted to die. Like then, Hans no longer wishes to live. At a grand dinner with his wife, Harry and his buddies, Hans downs a few dozen shots of liquor, which promptly kill him on the spot.

The authorities, however, unwilling to publicly admit that Skorzeny was the vampire Kolchak claimed, print a false version of the newspaper story with his byline and threaten to charge him with first degree murder unless he quietly leaves Las Vegas. They also tell him that his girlfriend Gail has already been forced to leave the city for being \"an undesirable element.\" Carl exhausts his savings placing personal advertisements across the country in a futile attempt to find her.\nThe final scene reverts to Kolchak in his sleazy hotel room. He explains that if anyone tries to verify the events in the book, they will find that all witnesses have either left town, are not talking, or are dead. He concludes by noting that Skorzeny and all his victims have been cremated, destroying any further ability to investigate the matter and eliminating the possibility that those killed by Skorzeny would in turn rise as vampires and perpetuate the curse.", "tmdb_id": 15360}, "57281881": {"title": "No Place to Run (film)", "plot": "An adopted boy's parents are killed, and to keep him from returning to the state's custody, he and his grandfather run away.", "tmdb_id": 220332}, "31196060": {"title": "Nobody Ordered Love", "plot": "After film director Paul Medbury attempts to replace Alice Allison, the alcoholic star of his new First World War movie entitled The Somme, with up-and-coming starlet Caroline Johnson, a series of tragic events begins to unfold.", "tmdb_id": 398896}, "13149353": {"title": "A Young Retiree", "plot": "A former ballet artist (played by Ervin Abel) unexpectedly finds himself retired and begins searching for new place in life, eventually becoming a hired tutor of a mischievous teenage daughter of a powerful mother.", "tmdb_id": 68845}, "9613521": {"title": "Now You See Him, Now You Don't", "plot": "At Medfield College, science buff Dexter Riley and his friends, including Richard Schuyler and Debbie Dawson, eavesdrop via a hidden walkie-talkie on a board meeting led by Dean Eugene Higgins, discussing the small college's continuing precarious finances. Later that afternoon, Professor Lufkin shows Higgins around the science laboratory where Dexter is working on an experiment with invisibility and another student, Druffle, explores the flight of bumblebees. That night, during a powerful thunderstorm, the laboratory is struck by lightning, resulting in the destruction of Dexter\u2019s work. The next day, as Dexter examines his burnt equipment with dismay, Higgins meets with A.J. Arno, a recently released prisoner, who had also purchased Medfield's mortgage. When Dexter accidentally drops one half of his glasses into a container of his experimental formula, it appears as if the substance destroys them, but upon closer examination, Dexter realizes the frames are merely partially invisible. After several tests, Dexter places his fingers in the liquid and they disappear. Schuyler and Debbie arrive and are horrified to see Dexter with a partial hand, but Dexter insists Schuyler test the substance as well - admitting only afterward that he does not yet have an antidote and it adheres firmly to all surfaces tested - but just as quickly learn that it is water-soluble and rinses away cleanly.\nJust then, Higgins brings Arno to visit the laboratory, stunning the students, as only two years earlier, Dexter was instrumental in exposing Arno's crooked gambling scheme. Dexter and the others notice that Arno is more concerned with the campus architecture than Higgins' speech. Curious about Arno's behavior, Dexter convinces Schuyler to use the invisibility formula to sneak into Arno's office that night. Despite several mishaps, the boys get inside Arno's office where Dexter finds a letter detailing that gambling is legal on the Medfield College lands due to a 1912 statute - and Schuyler finds a model of the college renovated into a gambling town.\nThe next day Dexter shows the photos and papers to Lufkin and Higgins. Convinced that Druffle's bumblebee study would draw attention and investments to Medfield, Higgins reacts angrily when Dexter assures him that his invisibility formula could win the top prize money in the upcoming Forsythe science contest. Not having admitted to anyone that Medfield has been dropped from the contest for being too insignificant, Higgins  contacts the contest's sponsor, millionaire Timothy Forsythe, and agrees to meet over a game of golf, despite his inability to play. Upon learning of Higgins' plan and suspecting it must be connected with raising money for the college, Dexter urges Schuyler to volunteer to serve as Higgins' caddy while, hidden by the invisibility formula, he will take control of Higgins' golf ball. At the golf club, Forsythe and the state university dean, Collingsgood, are amazed by Higgins' quirky golfing abilities, which include numerous hole-in-one-shots, as is Arno who is also at the club.\nAfter the game, Forsythe agrees to reinstate Medfield into the competition. Meanwhile, Arno accidentally sees Dexter becoming visible in the club showers and grows suspicious. When the local television news covers Higgins' extraordinary golf game, he is invited to join an exclusive tournament in nearby Ocean City. Convinced that he will win enough money to pay the college's mortgage, Higgins brashly accepts and that afternoon departs with Schuyler. Learning of the tournament too late, Dexter misses the plane and is forced to watch the competition on television where Higgins' game against two professionals is a disaster. Arno and his henchmen also watch the tournament and ponder Higgins' odd inconsistency. Upon returning to the college, Higgins tells Lufkin that Druffle's bumblebee experiment is the school's last chance. Both men are stunned when Druffle appears swathed in bandages after being attacked by the bumblebees, to which he is allergic. Hoping to assuage the crestfallen Higgins, Lufkin suggests that they give Dexter's unproven formula a chance and the dean reluctantly agrees.\nThat evening, Arno\u2019s henchman Cookie, disguised as a janitor, sneaks into the campus laboratory where he witnesses Dexter and Schuyler using the invisibility spray and reports to Arno, who orders him to return and steal it. The following day, Forsythe and members of his committee arrive on campus to judge the best science experiment at the college. Unaware that their spray bottle has been replaced by Cookie, Dexter and Schuyler make their presentation and are stunned when it has no effect. Forsythe and Higgins depart as Dexter remains confused until he chats with Charlie the janitor. Learning that there is no night janitor, Dexter realizes that Cookie likely stole the formula. Concluding that Arno must be behind the theft, Dexter plants a walkie-talkie in his office.\nA couple of days later, Schuyler overhears Arno plotting with Cookie to rob the Medfield Bank by making themselves and the money invisible. Certain that if he could retrieve the formula before the Forsythe Award announcement that night he could still win the contest, Dexter sends Schuyler to the police and goes to inform the bank's president, Wilfred Sampson. When both the police and Sampson dismiss the boys' story about invisibility, Dexter and his friends gather outside of the bank. When an invisible Arno and Cookie knock out the guards and take the money, Dexter unsuccessfully tries to use a fire hydrant to hose the men down as they exit the bank. Sampson contacts the police, who join the college students in a wild chase of the car driven by the invisible robbers.\nAfter a long police chase, Dexter forces Arno's car into a swimming pool where it, the money, and the men become visible. Arno and his henchmen are arrested. Dexter and the others dash to the presentation of the Forsythe Award and plead for one more opportunity to demonstrate their invention. Frustrated by Dexter's determination, Higgins intervenes just as Dexter sprays Schuyler, and, again, there is no result. Realizing the dip in the pool has diluted the formula, Dexter tries to explain to Forsythe. Just when Higgins tells everyone for the last time that invisibility does not exist, the top half of him becomes invisible, thus shocking the group and winning the top prize to save Medfield for another year.", "tmdb_id": 24236}, "58666843": {"title": "Nurit (film)", "plot": "Shoshana (Yona Elian), a rich young woman from Tiberias loves Moshe (Sasi Keshet), a poor truck driver from Tel Aviv.

Karin claims she also knows the bunker's location, because her father built it. The villain, Rico (Ole-J\u00f8rgen Nilsen), is seen driving around in a Toyota Celica ST 2000. The smuggler initially says he wants to share the treasure with her as long as she shows him the location.\nThe Olsen Gang steals a red Ford Transit and travels down to S\u00f8rlandet.

In contrast to Norah's elitism, Joel has a more bohemian view of the world, and has recently returned to New York after an extended visit to Tangier. Despite their differences, the siblings remain close, bonded by the suicide of their socialite mother that occurred when Joel was still a child; Norah, a young adult at the time, became Joel's guardian.\nTwo days after Erika's party, Joel fails to arrive at a dinner Norah has planned at her house. When she phones him, she hears a series of disturbing noises and heavy breathing. Concerned, Norah rushes to Joel's apartment building in the East Village. Outside, she witnesses Joel in a rage, being apprehended by police and escorted to the psychiatric ward of Bellevue Hospital. Norah is disturbed to find that Joel violently attacked the building's superintendent. In Joel's apartment, Norah finds a large switchblade knife, and notices an esoteric hand symbol painted on the wall. Norah is met by Joel's former girlfriend, Sherry, who comments on Joel's \"dark side.\" Norah learns that the apartment previously belonged to a man named Tonio P\u00e9rez, the superintendent's son.\nUnable to recall the events that landed him in the hospital, Joel is convinced by Norah to lie to the doctors and claim he was under the influence of hallucinogens. After following Norah's instruction, Joel is discharged on the provision that he meet with a psychiatrist; Norah arranges for him to see Erika, who has known Joel most of his life. During their sessions, Joel informs Erika that he formed a strong friendship with his neighbor, Tonio. Meanwhile, Norah, having welcomed Joel to stay with her while recovering, observes increasingly odd behavior: He first asks Norah inappropriate questions about her sex life, and later, at his birthday celebration (attended by Norah, her children, and Sherry), exhibits manic behavior, culminating in a series of crude insults to Norah's Puerto Rican maid, Veronica, which he relays in Spanish.\nThe following day, Norah visits Sherry's apartment to return an earring she left behind. Upon entering, Norah finds Sherry's decapitated corpse lying in her bed, and her severed head hanging from a houseplant. Police interview Norah, and remark that Sherry's murder resembles serial killings that occurred the summer before in Spanish Harlem, which received little publicity because the victims were all Hispanic females. Detectives presume the perpetrator to be Tonio Per\u00e9z, who has been missing for several months, but his family and friends refuse to cooperate with authorities.\nWith Veronica's help, Norah meets Don Pedro, a Santer\u00eda practitioner in Harlem who agrees to help her. He arranges a ceremony to banish Tonio's spirit, which he believes has possessed Joel's body. In attendance is Tonio's grief-stricken mother, who admits to Norah that Tonio was in fact a murderer, and that when his father discovered Tonio's crimes, he murdered Tonio himself and disposed of his remains. Norah bears witness to the ceremony, but Don concludes it to be unsuccessful because Norah is not a believer; he insists she return with Joel.\nNorah returns home to find Joel screaming hysterically in Spanish. Frightened for the children's safety, Norah brings them to the family's beachfront vacation home in Long Island, while Erika promises to help Joel. The next morning, after returning from a walk on the beach, Norah finds Erika's severed head in the kitchen, and Joel standing nearby with his switchblade.

Devlin demands the money from Mary Ann, who tells him to come to the county fair the next day to get it. Mary Ann tells him Chicago is \"an old sow, begging for cream\" that should be melted down.\nAs they are standing by a cattle pen with naked young women offered for auction, one of them, Poppy, begs Devlin for help. Devlin takes her with him \"on account.\" Back at the hotel, she tells Devlin her history of growing up at an orphanage in Missouri with her close friend, Violet, before they were brought to the slave auction.\nAt the county fair, in the midst of a livestock judging competition, Mary Ann gives Devlin a box that supposedly contains the money.

She also begins sleeping with Jack's psychiatrist, Dr. Herder, to persuade him to cure Jack quickly.\nHerder attempts to cure him through intensive psychotherapy, to no avail; Jack so thoroughly believes that he is the \"God of Love\" that he dismisses any suggestion to the contrary as insane. The night his wife goes into labour, Herder makes a last effort at curing Jack; he introduces Jack to McKyle, a patient who also believes himself to be Christ \u2013 or as the patient puts it, \"The High Voltage Messiah\" \u2013 who subjects an unwitting Jack to electroshock therapy. The plan works, and as Grace is delivered of a healthy baby boy, Jack proclaims \"I'm Jack, I'm Jack\". His family takes this to mean that he has returned to his senses, but in reality he now believes himself to be Jack the Ripper.\nSir Charles sends for a court-appointed psychiatrist to evaluate Jack, confident that his nephew will be sent to an asylum for life. He is once again thwarted when the psychiatrist discovers that Jack was a fellow Old Etonian, bonds with him and declares him sane.\nJack murders Lady Claire in a fit of rage when the aging woman tries to seduce him. He frames the Communist family butler, Tucker, for the murder. Sir Charles suffers a debilitating stroke shortly afterward, and Dr. Herder has a nervous breakdown upon realizing what Jack has done. Jack assumes his place in the House of Lords with a fiery speech in favour of capital and corporal punishment. His colleagues applaud wildly, completely unaware the speech is the ranting of a lunatic. When seen through his eyes, his colleagues \u2013 singing \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" \u2013 appear to be rotting corpses. Their enthusiasm contrasts with the unfavourable reaction when Jack believed he was Christ. That night, he murders Grace for expressing her love for him. Her terrified scream is matched by the sound of a baby cooing \"I'm Jack, I'm Jack\", suggesting that their son \u2013 the heir presumptive \u2013 has inherited Jack's madness.", "tmdb_id": 30892}, "44279031": {"title": "Run, Cougar, Run", "plot": "Set in Utah, the film tells the story of a cougar whose mate has been killed by a hunter.

Soon afterwards two local men confront him, demanding to know where he has put the chest. When Bryant refuses to answer, the younger man strikes him, causing Bryant to fall and strike his head on a rock.\nThe US lawyer William \"Bill\" Mathison (Barry Newman) is on holiday in Europe and visits Bryant's photo shop in Salzburg to ask about a book of photographs of Austrian mountain lakes. He is acting on behalf of publisher James Newhart (Whit Bissell). Bryant's Austrian wife Anna (Anna Karina) hands Bill correspondence from a certain Eric Yates, Newhart's representative in Zurich, including a countersigned cheque for the illustrated book.\nDuring the visit, Anna's brother Johann Kronsteiner (Klaus Maria Brandauer) receives a call from Felix Zauner (Wolfgang Preiss), a family friend, who tells him that Bryant has been the victim of a fatal accident. Johann goes to identify the body at an inn close to the Finstersee. The landlord of the inn, Grell (Helmut Schmid), is the elder of the men who had earlier confronted Bryant.\nNot far from the photo shop, Mathison notices that he is being followed by two men. To lose them, he takes a hackney carriage and is driven through the city. Having shaken off the first tail, a heavy set man with a moustache (Raoul Retzer) also starts to follow him. Bill takes part in a tour of Hohensalzburg Fortress, verifies that he is being followed, and then loses the man.\nWhile admiring the view from the fortress, Bill meets a young American Elissa Lang (Karen Jensen). They strike up a conversation and Mathison invites Elissa for a drink at his Salzburg hotel. It then turns out that she works for Zauner, who is part of the Austrian secret service. Elissa also passes information to KGB agent Lev Benedescu (Mischa Hausserman) and it becomes clear that she is also working for the Russians as a double agent.\nWhile Johann drives to the Finstersee, Bill receives a visit from Anna, who tells him of her husband's death. Anna is firmly convinced that her husband has been murdered. She therefore asks Bill whether Yates is involved in this affair, but he explains that Yates has also mysteriously died.\nAnna reveals that both her murdered husband and Yates had once worked for the British secret service. But she, Anna, had never trusted Yates. She confides in Bill her belief that her husband may have once again got involved in espionage. Later, while Bill is taking Anna home, Elissa breaks into Bryant's now-closed photo shop and steals the photos taken at Finstersee, as well as his correspondence with Yates. \nBill and Anna arrive at the shop and discover that someone is inside. Elissa flees unrecognised, but is pursued by Bill. In a side alley, Elissa is confronted by a stranger, but she is able to overpower and kill him. Bill and Anna find the dead man, who Anna recognises Bernard Dietrich, Zauner's deputy.\nAt Finstersee, where Johann is looking for the missing chest, he is followed by two neo-Nazis, one of whom is Anton (Udo Kier) \u2013 Richard Bryant's killer. Johann discovers the chest at the edge of the forest and is able to escape from the two men. Then he disappears and hides the box at the home of his girlfriend Trudi Seidl (Elisabeth Felchner).\nBill takes the distraught Anna to his hotel and rents a room for her there, because she would probably no longer be safe at home in the shop. At the hotel, her brother Johann visits her the following morning. He tells her that he has found and secured the box and reports that an Israeli had come to see him and offered to buy Bryant's chest. Obviously, its contents must be valuable.\nAnna reminds her brother that Bryant and Dietrich had to die because of this chest and that it would be better to give it to the neo-Nazi Grell, or to destroy it. That same day, Bill meets up with CIA agent Chuck (Joe Maross), who has contacted him through Newhart. On the way to their meeting, Mathison is again followed the moustachioed man, who Chuck arranges to be shot on a chair lift by an assassin (Bert Fortell). According to Chuck, the dead man had been a Polish spy working for the Chinese. Chuck explains to Bill that the CIA had been working with Yates, who had been another double agent. \nIt gradually emerges that the mysterious box contains documents listing former Nazis who are still active, and who have infiltrated the West or are being used by Western intelligence services. The Russians have recently discovered a similar chest in Czechoslovakia, and have the lists already.\nBill cannot understand why the CIA is so desperate to acquire the documents, and Chuck explains that several Germans named in these lists are working in important scientific positions for the USA. They are now vulnerable to blackmail by the Soviets, and it is vital that the CIA knows their identities.\nIn the afternoon of the same day, Johann returns home, where the two neo-Nazis he encountered at the lake are waiting for him. They overpower and kidnap him. At the photo shop, Anna receives a phone call from Trudi, who tells her that Johann has not kept a date with her.\nBill drives Anna to her husband's funeral and waits at the entrance to the cemetery. Two men grab Anna and drag her into a car, which quickly leaves the scene. Bill notices and follows the car towards the city. He is able to get in front of the kidnapper's vehicle, slowing it down and causing enough traffic chaos to ensure that the Austrian police become involved. Anna is rescued and the men are arrested. \nMeanwhile, the neo-Nazis begin to torture Johann. They want to know where he hid the chest. Elissa meets with the Soviet agent Benedescu, who is annoyed that she has so far failed to remove Bill from the scene. Benedescu hands Elissa a bomb with a 10-minute timer. As soon as she verifies that the chest is genuine, she is to use it to destroy the box once and for all. The Russians do not want anyone else to access the lists.\nAnna and Bill, who are worried about Johann, want to meet Trudi in the evening, but see Zauner's vehicle on the road. They find him in his shop and he tells them how to find Trudi. \nThen Elissa suddenly appears on the scene. Bill instinctively senses danger and takes Anna out of the shop. Zauner knows that Elissa is responsible for the death of his colleague Dietrich and makes it clear to her that the Austrian secret service knows about her double agent activity. Elissa assures Zauner that she only wants to destroy the chest, which seems to suit him. \nElissa goes to the inn where she meets a group of neo-Nazis, led by Grell, and makes it clear to them that she is also desperate to get her hands on Johann in order to find out the location of the chest. Grell then makes a brief phone call to Johann's kidnapper Anton.\nElissa pretends to be Anna on the phone and tries to convince Johann, who is already worn down, to hand over the chest, otherwise Trudi's life will be in serious danger. Johann passes on the location of the box, but also manages to reveal where he is being held.\nAt the same time, Chuck shows up in Bill's car and all three go to see Trudi. Trudi hands over the coveted chest. They are about to leave when Elissa and the Neo-Nazis arrive, closely followed by Felix Zauner. Zauner and Mathison interrogate Grell, whose henchmen have mysteriously disappeared, while Elissa attaches her bomb to the chest unnoticed. The explosion comes sooner than expected (as planned by Benedescu) and kills Elissa.\nChuck takes Grell into custody and Zauner tells Bill that he knows where Johann is being held. On the way there, Bill confesses that he and Chuck had swapped the chest for a duplicate. Zauner, in turn, makes it clear why he was so personally interested in getting his hands on the Finstersee find: his name is on one of the lists! He had once served as a Nazi informant to save his wife from deportation to a concentration camp during the Second World War, and the KGB had been blackmailing him. This was why he agreed to help Elissa.\nArriving at the hiding place, Zauner tries to negotiate a deal to take Johann without bloodshed, but Anton shoots him dead. At gunpoint, Bill disarms the neo-Nazis and rescues Johann.

They all agree to buy the Butler mansion on behalf of the town for the bargain price of $50,000, which Jeffrey requires to be paid in cash the next day. Carter and Ingrid spend the night at the Butler mansion, but are brutally murdered in bed with an axe by an unseen assailant. After the murders, the killer places a crucifix in Ingrid's hand and proceeds to phone the sheriff, introducing himself as the house's owner and asking him to investigate Carter's disappearance. While talking with Tess, who forwards his call, the killer calls himself \"Marianne\".\nAt nightfall, Jeffrey arrives at the mansion to meet with Carter, but finds it locked and empty.

He moves his family to Colorado to take proprietorship of the hotel. It is an immense but ramshackle building with no heat and a colorful old codger, Jesse McCord, living in the shed. McCord offers his services as a bartender, but Baxter assigns him the job of bellhop. Local grease monkey Wally Perkins explains that the Grand Imperial sits on a huge amount of property.

Milan takes the bait and immediately begins a series of attempts to discover what Perrin knows\u2014never realizing the fact that Perrin knows nothing at all about espionage (although he is an expert on music). Milan's machinations place Perrin in a series of increasingly peculiar adventures which he either avoids or escapes from by pure luck (which only confirm Milan's increasingly paranoid suspicions), and although Perrin is largely oblivious to the mayhem occurring around him, he cannot help noticing Milan's top agent, the beautiful femme fatale Christine. Adding to the confusion is the fact that Perrin is having an affair with Paulette Lefebvre, the wife of his best friend Maurice (both of whom are musicians in the same orchestra as Perrin), and Maurice, upon accidentally hearing a recording of Perrin and Paulette having torrid sex (made by Milan's agents and listened to inside a floral delivery truck), jumps to the mistaken conclusion that Paulette is having an affair with a florist. All the time, Toulouse and Perrache watch the chaos serenely, although Perrache is troubled by his chief's callousness toward the risk that Perrin might be killed.\nChristine greets Perrin at her apartment's front door in a demure high-necked black-velvet dress, then turns around and shows that the dress is backless, displaying discreet buttock cleavage. A slapstick love scene (watched by Milan and his cohorts on a television monitor) ensues, concluding with Milan's decision (despite Christine's belief that Perrin could not possibly be an agent) to have Perrin eliminated. More mayhem (including Maurice's learning the truth about his wife's affair) and treachery (including Christine's defection from Milan's group to save Perrin, with whom she has fallen in love) follow, climaxing in the deaths of not only agents from both Toulouse's and Milan's groups but also Milan himself, who only learns the truth about Perrin from Perrache just before he dies. Realizing how he has been fooled, Milan dies with a smile of appreciation. Maurice, who has repeatedly walked in on the aftermaths of the shoot-outs in Perrin's apartment, suffers a total mental breakdown.\nThe film ends as it began, at Orly airport. Perrin pushes a huge Louis Vuitton steamer trunk in an airport luggage cart, talking softly to Christine, who is hidden inside. Their destination is Rio de Janeiro. Toulouse, who has been watching Perrin's departure on a monitor, instructs Perrache to contact Perrin when Perrin returns, remarking, \"After all, he handles himself pretty well.\"", "tmdb_id": 12089}, "11478593": {"title": "Taming of the Fire", "plot": "Epic film in two episodes, based on a true story of creation and development of Soviet space and missile industry.

The rest of the students are leaving for spring break, but Regina has no money and no plans. As she is opening her mail, she notices she's received a mysterious letter telling her that she's won a free vacation at a seaside bed and breakfast called the Red Wolf Inn. When she calls the phone number in the letter, they tell her that a private plane is waiting for her at the airport, and that she'd better hurry. The plane takes her to a remote rural destination, where she is greeted by a handsome but odd young man who says his name is Baby John Smith (John Neilson). Baby John takes her on a thrill ride speeding through town and evading the police. When Regina enjoys the chase instead of being afraid, Baby John is impressed.\nArriving at the Inn, she is greeted by Henry Smith (Arthur Space) and Evelyn Smith (Mary Jackson), the elderly proprietors of the mansion. They identify themselves as Baby John's grandparents. There are two other guests as well, both lovely young females named Pamela (Janet Wood) and Edwina (Margaret Avery). Regina asks to use the phone so she can call her mother, but it's out of order. The group sits down to an extravagant meal, during which Evelyn prompts them all to eat more and more. That night, Regina goes to the kitchen to look for antacid. She is terrified when Baby John suddenly emerges from the walk-in refrigerator, brandishing a large knife. Her screaming wakes everyone else in the house, and Baby John apologizes for scaring her. Before going back to sleep, Edwina talks with Regina and says she can tell Regina and Baby John are attracted to one another, and Regina admits that it's true.\nThe next day, Edwina and Regina discover that Pamela has left, but Regina finds a carriage house behind the mansion where Pamela's stylish black dress is hanging. She also discovers a framed photo of the pilot who flew her to this isolated destination. Regina and Baby John share a moment on the beach, where they flirt in an almost childlike way, then kiss. But then Baby John reacts violently when he reels in a shark on his fishing line, grabbing the animal by the tail and bashing it against a piece of driftwood on the beach, screaming \"Shark!!\" over and over. After this bizarre display, he tells Regina \"I think I love you,\" and leaves. That night, there is another party, this time to celebrate Edwina's 'last night', as she is going home the next day. After another huge dinner, the group goes to bed, but the Smiths go to Edwina's room and abduct her from her bed by knocking her unconscious with chemicals on a rag. They carry her into the refrigerator and close the door, and we hear the sounds of the Smiths dismembering her body.\nThe next day, Regina is alarmed when Evelyn tells her that Edwina left without saying goodbye. Regina finds the phone in order and calls her mother, but before she can tell her anything, Evelyn disconnects them.  A police car pulls up outside the mansion, and Regina bursts out of the house seeking help, but the cop is another grandson of the Smiths (played by producer Michael MacReady). Now realizing she is a prisoner, Regina is left in the charge of Baby John while the Smiths go into town, and she seizes the opportunity to explore the forbidden refrigerator, where she finds the decapitated heads of Edwina and Pamela. Regina screams in horror as she realizes the Smiths are cannibals and she's been eating human flesh for two days. Now realizing she will be next, a panicked Regina bolts from the house with Baby John pursuing, but she is caught by Evelyn and Henry returning from their errand.\nOnce they are back at the Inn, Regina and Baby John have a private moment where they say they love each other. Regina knows that Henry and Evelyn intend to kill her, but Baby John has a childlike attitude, and thinks they will learn to accept her. At dinner that night, Regina faces an unspoken challenge. The Smiths study her carefully to see if she will eat the meat now that she knows what it is, hence judging if she would actually be able to join their clan as a mate for Baby John. Regina is unable to eat and runs from the table in disgust, and the Smiths have made up their mind that Regina will be meat.

The young man Michal witnesses German Nazi soldiers slaughter his wife, son and mother at their villa. Michal and his father avoid death by hiding in a nearby forest, from where they see the murders.\nMichal decides to join the resistance but before his first meeting, the Gestapo kills his go-between and chases him through the town. He runs into an apartment of a pregnant woman and helps her give birth. The woman appears to be a doppelganger of his murdered wife. Michal, upset, talks with some nuns on a street, asking about his earlier life in the area, and after calming down he listens to a woman looking like his wife talk about existence, love and cruelty, then smiling romantically to each other. Michal wanders through the occupied city, witnessing existence and the surroundings in it become more nightmarish under occupation. He meets an acquaintance, Marian, whom he asks to get more rations from, but Marian replies that there is nobody Michal needs them for. Michal then talks about the possibility of miracles, and Marian responds by saying that he is behaving like a \"wild wind\". Michal tells Marian that he has been blessed with a family now. They go on talking about experimental infections with lice going on when they witness a German officer at a market kick a man and shoot him with his Luger pistol and walk away. Marian kneels at the body and asks where meaning, law and God has gone in the \"void and medieval darkness\" that \"life has become\", saying that \"a cry must burst out of this country's soul\".  Upset that the fascist culture of cruelty is now the rule, he humbly agrees to give Michal more rations. Michal gets a job in the typhus center's lice-feeding labs, where he is approved as a guinea pig, the job Marian briefly mentioned earlier. Registered as a patient he gets his first injection and an illegal vaccine, and he also obtains the vaccine, saying it's for his wife and child. He sees a nurse who tells him this is the best job, that the patient before him died and he can take his place. Back in the apartments where the woman with her baby live, he see nuns praying for a dying man, asking one of them if there is some meaning which he is unable to grasp.  She responds by just mentioning how the old people die of hunger and cold, but as Michal tells her he now has a better rations card and can bring them food she tells him not to and to keep it for himself. Before leaving he again asks the nun if she can't see any likeness between the woman and his wife. She says it's just Michal who sees something which isn't there and leaves. He delivers the vaccines and food to the mother. They talk about what her husband did before the war and Michal says that he too had a wife and child before, and when getting to hold the baby he becomes emotionally upset. A vision of a young boy on a toy horse in a dark corner appears when Michal leaves.\nLater when in his bed, a mysterious masked man visit him and talks about deals they did before the war, gives Michal a book and tells him about a prophecy before saying he himself is fleeing to Switzerland and also that he believes he will find his son one day just as he believes that Michal must find the woman he loved again. He reveals he wears a mask because he is \"afraid to look at his own face\". It is revealed the man's name is Mr. Rosencranc when they say farewell. Michal reads pages that the man marked for him in the book about \"a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet\", \"a dragon appearing to devour her child\", and \"a war above in which Micha\u0142 and his angels fight the dragon, which was cast out, and the woman was given wings so she could fly to wilderness\". The mysterious man walks through a graveyard outside, takes off his mask and meets an old lady to whom he shows some documents, probably to travel. But as they leave, men from the SD or Gestapo appear and drag the old lady away while they shoot the man. Michal runs out and talks to a woman who looks like his wife. Later, talking with his father, the conversation becomes surreal as his father says he has never heard of \"that man\" before, and Michal says he \"later only saw him once, from a window\", and then a brutal roundup of people on the streets by SS and Wehrmacht is seen through a window, and a man tearing up a paper from his pocket before all are herded into trucks.  Michal runs to the woman with a baby and says he saw a \"him\" being taken away and she says Michal now must provide for her and the child. Michal is then again shown talking to his father who tells him \"there is nothing to save, the world has vanished\" and that he must \"fathom the new laws that govern the decay\" and adjust himself to them, and that that's why Michal has \"acted correctly but cruel\", to which Michal says he can redeem anything he did, \"even the presence of our children in this world\". At the lab he sees his wife again but when he blinks it turns out it was a random nurse. He and other patients have a heated discussion on authors like Nietzsche, Spengler, Proust and Balzac when a memory from \"when all the professors was taken away\" is mentioned, and Michal imagines the same nurse as his wife again.\nAfter having delivered rations to the mother again, the toy horse appears in the dark corner but without the boy on it this time. Instead the boy appears before him at the job at the hospital, telling him \"there is no you and me anymore\". The same day he goes on a nightly mission for a friend and sees a man get shot. Next day, Michal sees the man who he earlier saw through the window in the roundup, now free. The free man then lies down next to the woman with a baby, crying, as she wakes up and sees him.

As soon as the security guards on duty see the empty shell, they rush away to raise the alarm.  The criminals take advantage of the guards' absence by putting a fake pearl, the same size as the real one, in the shell.  When the guards return with the director and the director sees the fake pearl, he thinks the guards were making it up, but then has second thoughts about the incident as a similar case happened at another museum two weeks before.\nMeanwhile, Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock arrive in Syldavia, a country in the Balkans. They have come to join their friend Professor Calculus who has rented a villa near a lake in order to build his latest invention. At the airport they run into Thompson and Thomson, who are also heading for Calculus on a special mission.\nThe four men and dog fly by hired plane to Calculus' house, but during the flight they get into some engine trouble and the pilot bails out with the only parachute. Tintin attempts to safely land the plane, but it ends up on the edge of a cliff and on fire. They are saved with the help of two local children, Niko and his sister Nushka, and their dog Gustav. But as it turns out, the crash was deliberately set up, as the pilot contacts his superior (\"Mr. Big\"/\"King Shark\") via a walkie-talkie, hidden in his binoculars, to inform him that the plan has failed.\nThe children give their new friends a lift in their wagon, but as they learn of their destination, they warn them that there is a curse on the lake, at the bottom of which is an old submerged town. The party finally arrives at Calculus' villa where he demonstrates his invention: a camera which can project holographic images. His ultimate aim is to create a machine which will make actual copies of physical objects. Later, over dinner, Thompson and Thomson explain that they are Calculus' bodyguards as they suspect that a criminal organization specializing in making art forgeries wants to steal his machine. Eventually, everybody goes to bed. In the middle of the night, Snowy wakes up Tintin at one point after hearing a noise outside, but Tintin shakes it off as bird calls. In fact, the noise is made by Calculus' housekeeper, Madame Flik, who is in league with \"Mr. Big\" as well.\nNext morning, while Tintin explores the local country with Niko and Nushka (unaware that there are cameras spying on his every move), and the Captain and the detectives play a game of golf, Snowy runs into a frogman who has obtained from Madame Black some plans stolen from Calculus' laboratory. The frogman escapes by jumping into the lake, but Snowy manages to bite off a part of one of his flippers. After the Captain and the detectives tell Tintin what has happened, he gives the dogs the bitten-off flipper to sniff. While Gustav leads Haddock to a pile of abandoned tires, Tintin follows Snowy to a buried chain which, when pulled, opens a passage to a hidden cave where the criminals have stashed the stolen art. After getting sealed inside the cave, Tintin finds an underwater tunnel leading out to the lake. On his way through, Tintin gets trapped by a wire net, but Snowy (who remained outside the cave) dives in and chews through the net, saving Tintin from drowning.\nBack at home, Calculus demonstrates his new invention to the children\u2014a machine that can copy any object from a piece of special soap. Unfortunately the effects are as yet short-lived, as the copied objects shortly turn back into their original substance. The criminals attack Calculus and the detectives with laughing gas and take the children away. Tintin and Haddock pursue them but fail to rescue Niko and Nushka. The criminals leave behind a message on a tape player from their leader, \"King Shark\", who tells the heroes (with a voice which is startingly familiar to Tintin) that they will get the children back in return for Calculus' invention. Tintin himself is to do the exchange and is not to call the police.\nTintin, Haddock, Calculus and the detectives search the house for bugs, and Tintin discovers a secret passage that leads to Madame Black's walkie-talkie hidden in the empty well, catching Madam Black in the process. Tintin decides to contact the police and comes up with a ruse to cover his tracks. Tintin and Snowy set off to the local town and just happen to meet their old friend, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who gives him a lift in her car to the town and even helps him in getting to the police. The chief of police listens to his story, but he is limited in what he can do since half the lake is in the jurisdiction of Borduria, a rival nation, and there are thus risks of a diplomatic incident.\nTwo days pass before Tintin finally returns to Calculus' house with the shark-like submarine which Calculus built during the search for Red Rackham's Treasure. The plan is that Tintin will meet the crooks on the beach, and Haddock will follow him in the sub. At the meeting point, criminals pick Tintin up in a submarine, and they head underwater to the flooded city where their base is situated. The mastermind behind this operation is revealed to be none other than Tintin's nemesis Rastapopoulos, now calling himself \"King Shark\"/\"Mr. Big\". Rastapopoulos promises to set Niko and Nushka  free for the device, but, unaware of Tintin's arrival, the children escape from their cell and hijack an underwater tank.\nRastapopoulos takes over control of the tank with his computer, but he then notices Captain Haddock's sub on his monitor and uses the tank to fire torpedoes at Haddock, which provokes a fight between Tintin and the other gangsters as he attempts to stop Rastapopoulos. Haddock's mini-sub is hit, jamming its propulsion, and the tank is returned to the base by remote control. While waiting for the children to return, Rastapopoulos takes Tintin to his office and shows him his art collection, gloating that with Calculus' machine, they can make multiple copies of all the stolen masterpieces and sell them off for huge amounts of money.\nRastapopoulos tries out Calculus' machine by cloning a cigar box, but the imitation proves highly unstable and grows to monstrous size, almost crushing Rastapopoulos and his lieutenant. In a rage, Rastapopoulos locks Tintin and the children in a chamber, but then learns that police boats are patrolling the lake. He therefore decides to evacuate the base and orders his men to take all the art he has in the underwater city to the cave. He then floods the chamber Tintin and the children are in with water. As soon as the water has reached a device high on the wall, the base will self-destruct.\nHaddock manages to regain control of the disabled submarine and makes his way to the surface, encountering Thompson and Thomson and the chief of the Syldavian police in a patrol boat. Down below, with all of his men having evacuated the base, Rastapopoulos and his lieutenant leave the base in the submarine. Tintin and the children manage to get free and escape through an airlock in life jackets, just before the base explodes. They then reach the surface and rejoin their friends and the police. The police have captured all of Rastapopoulos' men, but the mastermind himself has already crossed the border in his submarine. Since they are not Syldavian officials and therefore not bound by international conventions, Tintin and Haddock insist in going after Rastapopoulos in a motor boat.\nIn order to pass the border posts, Rastapopoulos tries to navigate the sub through an underwater tunnel, but forgets to lower the sub's periscope, which hits a low rock and breaks, causing the sub to crash and get flooded. The villains make for the surface, but they are captured by Tintin and Haddock as soon as they attempt to leave the wrecked vessel. In the end, the Thompsons, Calculus, Niko, Nushka, and Gustav welcome Tintin, Snowy and Haddock back from their submarine vessel mission. Finally, Rastapopoulos and his seamen are taken away to Klow Prison by Syldavian Police Officials. Tintin, Snowy and Haddock return to Calculus' villa and are welcomed by a huge party of villagers who want to celebrate the end of the terror imposed by the gang, and Bianca Castafiore, who makes Haddock flee the party.

Their marriage is shaky, so they agree to spend the summer together as a trial period at an isolated beach house on Choke Cherry Bay. They quarrel shortly after arriving and, when Lily threatens to leave, Timothy throws her suitcase into the water. Frustrated with his childish immaturity, Lily gets in the car to drive away, but Timothy jumps onto the moving vehicle, hangs onto the windshield and cajoles her into stopping. Although she is weary of his antics, she is also amused and decides to remain.\nTheir landlord and only neighbor for miles around is Major Evelyn Ritchie (Alan Alda), a Vietnam veteran about 10 years their senior who owns two highly trained Doberman Pinschers and walks with crutches due to one of his legs being amputated. When the Frischers meet Ritchie for the first time, Timothy fires off questions about garbage and other practicalities and repeatedly interrupts Lily. Although Ritchie chuckles at the Frischers' gentle bickering, Lily intuits that he is growing annoyed by Timothy's questioning and apologizes for their enthusiasm. Ritchie seems at first aloof, but surreptitiously watches them through their unshuttered windows. When they start to make love, he raps on the door and offers wine as a welcoming gift. Ritchie compliments the \"feminine touch\" within the beach house and looks troubled when Timothy takes credit for a table decoration. After Ritchie leaves, Lily scolds Timothy for his lack of hospitality and accuses him of needing to brood. Timothy admits he has a bad feeling about their landlord, but Lily disagrees with him. When Timothy tries to drive off in anger, Ritchie's dogs suddenly appear and viciously circle his car, frightening him into honking until Ritchie comes out of his house to call them off. Amused by Timothy's fear, Ritchie says condescendingly that the dogs are unfamiliar with his smell.\nAnother day later, as Lily and Ritchie walk along the beach, she explains that she met Timothy when he jumped out at her wearing a clown nose and made her laugh. Proudly, she explains that Timothy studied mime in Paris, art, photography and drawing. Aware of Ritchie's unspoken disapproval of Timothy, Lily adds that she hopes the beach house will bring out Timothy's good qualities. While talking, she strips down to her bikini in order to get a tan, embarrassing Ritchie. At her questioning, Ritchie admits that Timothy seems younger than his age, but evades answering her direct question of whether he thinks Timothy is immature. Lily points out that, while Ritchie feels certain about himself, Timothy \"does not know who he is yet.\" Meanwhile, as Timothy is taking photographs of himself and the area, he encounters another bay resident, an older veteran named Stanley (Eric Clavering), who simply stares at him in amusement when he tries to start a conversation.\nOne night, Ritchie invites the couple to his house for dinner, where Lily and Timothy get inebriated. Lily asks Timothy to perform mime and his clown act. As Timothy prepares in another room, Lily, sensing Ritchie's disdain of Timothy and wanting his respect, tentatively explains that she is more than she may seem and makes the money in their household. Timothy then bursts into the room, with his face covered in shaving cream to imitate the white makeup of a mime and begins to perform \"the definitive ape.\" This disappoints Lily, who prefers his clown act, but Ritchie comments that Timothy shows more concentration when he does his ape routine than he shows in the rest of his life. He points out that gorillas are usually seen behind bars and, claiming that the experience of prison focuses a person, convinces Timothy to agree to meet him at dawn for a psychological experiment.\nThe next morning, Ritchie wakens the hungover Timothy and, treating him like a subordinate in the military, orders him to carry a pile of rocks to the beach. Timothy treats it as a joke, but Ritchie insists that he carry out the task. Leaving one of the dogs to guard Timothy, Ritchie proceeds to the beach house, where he wakens Lily, and stands at the door to her bedroom until she gets up and dresses. Then, after asking if he can \"borrow\" items, he walks through the rooms and gathers knives, razors, belts and other implements that could be used as weapons. Although bewildered, Lily plays along, acknowledging that they are playing a \"prison game.\" As Timothy continues to move the pile of rocks, Ritchie and Lily sit and watch from the beach house porch. When Timothy starts to take a break, Ritchie orders him to stand and hold a large rock, telling Lily that Timothy is undergoing the most therapeutic experience of his life. Ritchie informs Lily that, during American Revolutionary War battles, families of officers often watched from nearby. He also describes how he collected guns from the enemy corpses in Vietnam and that when he was wounded, someone stole his guns, believing he was dead. Unexpectedly, the dog attacks Timothy, causing him to bleed and, although the wound is minor, both Lily and Timothy panic.\nIn the evening, Timothy paints, ignoring Lily, who resumes a former smoking habit. At the same time, Stanley visits Ritchie, who shares with him military stories of tormenting subordinates, and their loud laughter, amplified by the water, unnerves Lily and Timothy. Later, the Frishers awaken to discover Ritchie towing away their car. When they go out to protest, the dogs threaten to attack them. During the night, Timothy tries to escape using the motorboat, forcing the frightened Lily to join him. However, the boat is cabled to the dock and Ritchie takes them back to the beach house, where he orders both dogs to guard them.\nThe next day, which happens to be the Fourth of July, American Legionnaires ceremoniously present Ritchie with a flag to honor his deceased father, a colonel, as part of an annual ritual. Afterward, while Timothy continues to move the rocks, Lily goes to Ritchie's house to talk. When she admits she is lonely, Ritchie asks if it is because of Timothy and promises that the situation will soon be different. She asks Ritchie's opinion of her and he says she needs a man, not a boy, who will bring her \"peace and pleasure\" that she has never known. Lily agrees that her soul is starved and, as Ritchie confides to her a story about a little girl he knew as a child, she removes her clothing, angering Ritchie. When she begs him to let them leave, he yells at her, forcing her to retreat, naked, to the beach house. Ritchie then shouts at Timothy, who has removed his shirt in the hot sun, and tells him to put it back on and button it up. Almost incoherently, he bellows that buttons are the difference between wild savages and civilization.\nThat night, still out of control, Ritchie prays for God to kill his enemies and burn them. He begs, \"Bring fire on them!\" and, as if on cue, a fireworks display commences, causing Ritchie to rejoice in sardonic glee. Meanwhile, Timothy pens up a dog and tries to barricade himself and Lily in the beach house. In retaliation, Ritchie shouts an attack command to the dogs and while Timothy fends off one dog, Lily manages to stab the other dog to death. Soon after, Ritchie gains entrance through a window and he and Timothy fight in the dark. Their struggling ends and Ritchie, lying on the ground exhausted, catches his breath.

The rumours prove true, as Anna, who has become Mitterhaus' willing acolyte and mistress, gives Jenny to him to be drained of her blood. Men from the village, directed by M\u00fcller and including Jenny's father Mr. Schilt and the B\u00fcrgermeister, invade the castle and attack the Count. After the vampire kills several of them, M\u00fcller succeeds in driving a wooden stake through his heart. With his dying breath, Mitterhaus curses the villagers, vowing that their children will die to give him back his life. The angry villagers force Anna to run a gauntlet, but when her husband intervenes, she runs back into the castle where the briefly revived Count tells her to find his cousin Emil at \"the Circus of Night\". After laying his body in the crypt, she escapes through a tunnel as the villagers blow up the castle with gunpowder and set fire to it.\nFifteen years later, Stetl is being ravaged by a plague and blockaded by the authorities of neighbouring towns, with men ready to shoot any villager who tries to leave. The citizens fear that the pestilence may be due to the Count's curse, though the new physician Dr. Kersh dismisses vampires as just a myth. A travelling circus, calling itself the Circus of Night, then arrives at the village, directed by a dwarf and an alluring gypsy woman who are equivocal about how they got past the blockade; the villagers, appreciative of the distraction from their troubles, do not much question the matter. No-one in the village suspects that one of the circus artists, Emil, is Count Mitterhaus's cousin and a vampire, as are the twin acrobats Heinrich and Helga. Emil and the gypsy woman go to the ruins of the castle, where in the crypt they find the Count's staked body still preserved, and they restate his curse that all who killed him and all their children must die.\nWhilst his son Anton distracts the armed men at the blockade, Dr. Kersh gets past them to appeal for help from the capital. At the Circus of Night, the villagers are amazed and delighted by the entertainment. Despite his wife's concerns over their wayward daughter, Rosa, and her attraction to the handsome Emil, the B\u00fcrgermeister takes her to the circus and, at the gypsy woman's invitation, visits its hall of mirrors where he sees, in one called \"The Mirror of Life\", a vision of a revived Count Mitterhaus, which causes him to collapse. Frightened by this event, Schilt tries to flee with his family from the blockaded village with the circus dwarf Michael as their guide, only to be abandoned by him in the forest and mauled to death by Emil, whose shapeshifting form is a black panther.\nM\u00fcller's daughter Dora, whom he sent away earlier for her protection, has slipped past the blockade and is returning to the village to reunite with her father and her beloved Anton when she discovers the Schilts' dismembered bodies, arousing suspicions about the animals of the circus. That evening, Jon and Gustav Hauser, two village boys whose father helped instigate the killing of Mitterhaus, are invited by the gypsy woman to enter the hall of mirrors and are magically drawn by Heinrich and Helga to the Count's crypt, where they are killed and drained. After the boys' bodies are found near the castle, their grieving father and the sick B\u00fcrgermeister begin to shoot the circus animals. After an encounter with Emil the B\u00fcrgermeister dies of heart failure, and his daughter leaves with the vampire. The vampire then kills and drains her in the crypt.\nDora and Anton are lured by the twins into the hall of mirrors where they try to whisk Dora through the Mirror of Life, but the cross she is wearing saves her. Later, the vampires enter the school house where Dora and Anton have taken refuge. Emil, in panther form, kills the boarding students, diverting Anton, while the gypsy woman (revealed to be Anna M\u00fcller and the twins' mother) tears the cross from Dora's neck, enabling Heinrich and Helga to attack her. Dora, however, escapes into the school chapel, where the twins are overwhelmed by a giant crucifix which she topples on them, destroying them. Nevertheless, with the help of the circus strongman, Emil and Anna succeed in having Dora and her guardian, Hauser's wife Gerta, kidnapped and taken to the crypt at Castle Mitterhaus, where they intend to use their blood - just like the blood from their previous child victims - as part of a ritual to restore the Count back to life.\nMeanwhile, Dr. Kersch returns from the capital with an imperial escort and medicines for the plague. He also brings news of vampire killings in other villages, all of them visited by the Circus of Night. The men attack the circus and set fire to it, killing the strongman when he tries to stop them. As Hauser starts to burn down the hall of mirrors, he sees in the Mirror of Life a vision of Emil and Anna bleeding Gerta over the Count's body. This horrifying sight distracts him long enough to be burned fatally by the fire, but he lives long enough to alert Anton and the other men to Dora's plight.\nBack in the castle crypt, the suddenly remorseful Anna is killed when she attempts to save Dora from Emil. Anton, finding his way through the tunnel into the crypt despite a deadly ambush by Michael the dwarf, attempts to rescue Dora but is halted by Emil. Just then M\u00fcller, Dr. Kersh, and a soldier break into the crypt and battle Emil who kills or disables all his attackers, but M\u00fcller pierces him with the stake from the Count's chest just as he is dying from Emil's bite. Revived by the stake's removal, the Count rises from his sarcophagus and advances on Dora and Anton. Anton uses M\u00fcller's crossbow as a makeshift cross, repelling the Count long enough for him to jam the vampire's neck between the weapon's bow and stock and then pulling the trigger, decapitating him. As Dr. Kersh leads Dora and Anton from the tomb, he and the villagers set the ruins afire with torches, ending the curse, but Dora and Anton see a bat fly out of the tomb into the night and are left uncertain.", "tmdb_id": 29960}, "21981175": {"title": "Vamsha Vriksha", "plot": "The story starts in 1924 with Kathyayani, widow of Nanjunda Shrothri, who lives with her in-laws Shrinivasa Shrothri and Bhagirathamma and their servant, Lakshmi, in Nanjangud. After the loss of her husband, Kathyayani did not take to a widow's garb as her mother-in-law wished because her father-in-law thought it would be too much for the young woman to bear. Shrothri, a scholar in Indian philosophy and the shastras, is occasionally visited by priests and professors for his opinion on an intricate problem in the scriptures. In one such event, Sadashiva Rao, a college lecturer in Mysore, visits Shrothri to discuss some matters of Indian philosophy. Listening to the two men talk, Kathyayani's thoughts turn to college. Despite a little protest from Bhagirathamma, Shrothri encourages his daughter-in-law to pursue her BA degree, which Nanjunda had been studying for before he had drowned in the nearby Kapila river. At the university, she meets the brother of Sadashiva Rao, Raja Rao, professor of Shakespearean drama and organiser of the Dramatics Club, with whom she falls in love.\nSimultaneously, Sadashiva Rao embarks on a massive five-volume project that would detail the cultural history of India from the days of the Indus Valley Civilisation to present times. With an initial grant from Shrothri of Rs. 1,000 and funding from the Maharaja of Mysore, Sadashiva Rao embarks on a tour of India to visit various libraries, monuments, and archives to conduct his research. During his visit to Ajanta, he meets with a Sinhalese couple and their daughter, Karunaratne, a historian of Buddhism from Cambridge. Rao is enchanted by the woman's sharp mind and dedication to her research, and invites her to continue her studies at his university. Ratne takes Rao up on his offer as she has some admiration for his work, and over the course of her doctoral degree and work with him as his research assistant, falls in love with him.\nSadashiva Rao, already married to Nagalakshmi, is concerned that society will see his interaction with Ratne, which by now had become quite informal, as improper. He is also frustrated with his wife for not being able to take part in his intellectual life, which was all that mattered to him. Rao offers to marry Ratne despite his earlier marriage and live in a bigamous relationship. Ratne is hesitant at first, but only for a short while. She agrees, and the two get married. Needless to say, Nagalakshmi, a dutiful and loving wife, is devastated. Around the same time,  Rao's younger brother, Raja Rao marries Kathyayani. The widow wrestles with the notion of remarriage, especially as she is aware of the dishonour it will bring to the Shrothri family, but ultimately gives in to the material pleasures of a married life. Unable to face her dharmic father-in-law, she writes him a letter and departs from the house with just the clothes on her back. The Shrothri family is shocked, even more so as Kathyayani has abandoned even her four-year-old son for Raja Rao, but Shrothri goads them back to some level of equanimity after the catastrophe.\nAs the years pass, Nagalakshmi, despondent, finds peace in religion, and the old Shrothris continue the burden of domestic life, denied the pleasures of retirement, first by the death of their son and then by the abandonment by their daughter-in-law. Kathyayani, after the initial enjoyment of marital bliss, suffers three miscarriages and wonders if her fate might not be in some way a divine judgement on her actions. Similarly, Rao falls sick as he churns out volume after volume of his magnum opus. Ratne, who had framed her marriage to Rao in intellectual terms, loses both her parents to old age and begins to feel the pangs of motherhood. Unfortunately for her, Rao is quite weak, and any time spent on her pregnancy and maternity leave might mean that their five-volume project may remain incomplete.\nOne day, Kathyayani suddenly comes across her son in her English class \u2013 after her bachelor's, she had studied for an MA and become a teacher along with her new husband. Unable to restrain herself, she invites him home and inquires about his family. When he tells her that both his parents are dead, Kathyayani feels his rejection more keenly than had the boy hurled insults at her or demanded an explanation from her. Her health deteriorates due to her mental anguish, much to the worry of her doting husband. Rao also hovers near death as the strain of his work wears him down, as does the guilt of abandoning his first wife, Nagalakshmi.\nIn the meanwhile, sadness once again descends upon the Shrothri house with the passing of Bhagirathamma. Battered by fate, Shrothri barely manages to hold on to his mental calm. He decides that it is time he took sanyasa and begins to put his affairs in order. He arranges for his grandson to be married to the daughter of a  respected Sanskrit teacher in town, and bequeaths two acres of land to Lakshmi, who had served the Shrothri family from her father's days. In the midst of sorting out his papers, Shrothri finds an old letter addressed to his father, cursing the man for cheating his brother out of his share of the ancestral property. Shocked, the old man investigates the accusation. As an old tale of greed, jealousy, and other human weaknesses unfolds, Shrothri is aghast to find that his father was not Nanjunda Shrothri, but some priest who had been chased off after impregnating his mother. This had been arranged so that Nanjunda Shrothri Sr. would have an heir to whom he could pass the ancestral property to, without having it pass to his brother. Shrinivasa Shrothri decides to track down his uncle's descendants, but when any fail to turn up, he gives away all his property and wealth to needy people in the village. His grandson, Shrinivasa Shrothri Jr., is supportive of the decision, as he too would not like to taint himself with ill-gotten wealth.\nIn the closing act, Sadashiva Rao, racked with guilt, returns to live with both his wives under one roof. Within a day of his having made his peace, he passes away. He had just finished his five-volume work. Ratne, when she raises the topic of Rao's research with his son (from his first wife), Prithvi, informs her that he doesn't care for history or philosophy and that he is a science student. Shrothri leaves for his sanyas, but decides to visit his daughter-in-law to see her one last time \u2013 he hadn't seen her since she left around 20 years ago. As he enters the Rao house, Kathyayani, no longer her radiant, beautiful, self but a pale emaciated shell, is in her final moments. Shrothri sends for her son, his grandson, and is shocked to find out that the young man knew of his mother but had rejected her \u2013 he had hoped that the junior Shrothri would have been raised better. While they await the grandson's arrival, the old man is surprised to find out that Nagalakshmi's aunt was his wronged uncle's daughter. Shrothri Jr., or Cheeni as his mother called him so many years ago, enters, and as he tries to pour some water down his mother's throat, she too passes away. Ratne has made preparations to return home to Ceylon, and Shrinivasa Shrothri finally leaves for his sanyas, telling his grandson that his first duty now was to perform the death rituals for his mother.", "tmdb_id": 334870}, "26245382": {"title": "Vasantha Maligai", "plot": "Anand is a rich playboy and alcoholic.

Convinced that his patient has a maximum of two years to live, Galipeau convinces his brother Emile to use a 'viager' (life annuity) to buy Martinet's lovely country house in the fishing village of Saint-Tropez (at the time, St-Tropez was not the world renowned destination it is today). The 'viager' is a French system whereby someone buys a house from a person, repaying them by instalments until the person's death, only upon which the house finally transfers to the buyer. Thanks to Martinet's declining health, the Galipeau expect to not pay for long and get his house for cheap.\nThinking Dr Galipeau is right, despite the fact that the doctor is always wrong whenever he says something (a running gag throughout the movie), Emile, under the advice of the notary dealing with the life annuity contract, accepts to index the 'viager' each year following the course of aluminium - a popular investment in the 1930s. The Galipeau believe that, even if aluminium's value goes up, it will not amount to much since they expect Martinet to die within a couple years.\nDespite Dr Galipeau's repeated claims that Martinet will soon die, as the years go by the elderly Martinet gets better and better, and the price of the 'viager' keeps getting higher due to aluminium's value constant increase. Finally fed up with this elderly who won't die and after seeing the annuity they must pay go through the roof, the Galipeau family (L\u00e9on, his wife Marguerite, Emile and his wife Elvire) decide to get rid of Martinet themselves.\nIn 1940, the early years of WWII, an attempt to make Martinet pass for a German spy is foiled by bad timing, as it happens on the day of France's surrender. In 1943, they try to make Martinez pass for a Gaullist and a R\u00e9sistant. Unfortunately for the Galipeau, the letter is not delivered until the Lib\u00e9ration, upon which their letter allows Martinet to become a decorated hero as everyone now believes he was a Resistant. A few years later, during a visit of Martinet to Paris, the Galipeau attempt to take advantage of Martinet's old age by making him have a heart attack. They spend the day visiting monuments where they must climb hundreds of steps, they try to lose Martinet in Paris' Catacombs and also have him overeat, overdrink and smoke a lot by taking him to several restaurants and bars throughout Paris. This proves fruitless as the boy is perfectly healthy and more than happy to climb steps (he even counts them for his personal enjoyment), smoke, eat and drink like there is no tomorrow. Their day ends with the group rushing to the station for Martinet to catch his train back to St-Tropez. In a reversal of fortune, Marguerite dies of exhaustion from their day of excessive activity on the platform as the train departs.\nThe years go by, Martinet seems to be tireless. He becomes even more popular locally as he performs shows in St-Tropez as the village slowly grows famous thanks to celebrities coming there. Not willing to give up and after having trouble paying for the annuity, Emile decides to murder Martinet. He invites him for a trip on a paddle boat out to sea where he schemes to shoot him and ditch his body in the water, planning to tell everyone Martinet fell and drowned as a cover-up story. Once again, this plan is foiled as the paddle boat breaks down, prompting Martinet to swim back to shore for help, leaving Emile (who does not know how to swim) alone on the paddle boat. Unfortunately, the manager of the paddle boat rental happens to be Captain Bucigny-Dumaine, the military man to whom the Galipeau tried to denounce Martinet twice during the war (As a result of these two botched denunciations, Bucigny-Dumaine was revoked from the military and now despises the Galipeau whom he blames for it). While pretending to rescue him, the Captain tries to murder Emile but gets shot dead in the process, while Emile falls from the paddle boat and drowns (As their bodies are never found, Martinet never knows Emile had a gun and was here to shoot him).\nSeveral years later, Martinet, now in his 80s, contracts influenza. Hoping to finally see him die, the remaining Galipeau plotters, L\u00e9on and Elvire, visit him in the hospital where they find him healed and enjoying life. Under the disguise of cleaning his house before his return from hospital, L\u00e9on and Elvire sabotage the place to have Martinet fall down the stairs of the balcony to his death.

She then demands the truth about Sarah's death, as she suspected Marcus killed her. Marcus agrees to answer, only if Elise offered herself to him. Elise then reluctantly strips herself nude while asking about Sarah's death. Marcus then admits to the murder to a nude Elise, who can't believe his confessions. She then rebuffs Marcus' claims and storms off the room. Marcus claims that he was not a child, as children could not murder their mothers.\nA frantic Elise then calls Paul back from the airport about the hole in the attic. She then takes him there, but finds that hole filled in, presumably by Marcus. Elise pleads Paul to believe her, to which Paul doesn't answer, but also doesn't say anything to Elise.

By using reverse psychology in a lengthy inquiry, Viorne makes her doubt her claims as she had no proof. Viorne then demands why Elise stripped nude in front of Marcus, who was a minor. She also accuses Elise of killing the family dog. Elise denies the claims and keeps telling that she was made to strip by Marcus in exchange of his confession, but Viorne doesn't believe her.\nElise, now being accused of sexually assaulting a minor, becomes mentally unstable and decides to kill Marcus in his sleep. When she is about to smother him, Paul interrupts and takes her away. Elise is then taken to a mental asylum, where she is given high sedatives. She then starts having nightmares of her killing Marcus, her getting killed by the family dog unleashed by Marcus, and her having sex with Marcus while Paul watches on. \nElise is later released from the asylum after her recovery. Paul picks her up from the gates and forgives her of all her misconducts. He also says that he sold the house as he wanted a fresh start with her and Marcus. Marcus then introduces his new dog, Hannibal to Elise. \nMarcus and Elise then take a stroll alone while Marcus proposes her an incestuous affair, citing that Paul was aging and was no longer able to satisfy Elise's desires. Elise then agrees and they both kiss passionately. While walking through the park, they come across a road where Elise notices a car coming up at high speed. She then throws the ball across the road, which the dog Hannibal runs after. Marcus gives chase after him, only to be run over by the car which apparently kills him.

Churchill is a junior officer in India determined to make a name for himself and to become a member of Parliament. As the older Churchill (voiced by Simon Ward) narrates, events shift back to his childhood. As a boy, Churchill is sent to a preparatory boarding school but is unhappy there and is removed by his parents after a particularly vicious caning by the sadistic headmaster. Later, at the entrance examination to Harrow School, Churchill submits a blank paper; however the headmaster, James Welldon, sees Churchill's potential and accepts him. One evening he recites a long poem of 1000 lines at a Harrow presentation. His nanny comes to listen but his parents do not, despite Churchill's express invitation. Churchill would later describe her as the only person who never let him down.\nMeanwhile, Churchill's father Lord Randolph destroys his career by resigning as Chancellor of the Exchequer; George Buckle, editor of The Times, refuses to support his position. Doctors Roose and Buzzard inform Lady Churchill that her that her husband has an incurable disease, will probably die in five or six years, and that they must never again have \"physical relations\".One morning, Churchill comes down to breakfast but his behaviour infuriates his father. Lord Randolph angrily sends his son up to his room, but after a conversation with his wife he goes to make up with his son, who is playing with his large collection of tin soldiers. Churchill eagerly accepts his father's suggestion that he go into the army; his father later admits to his mother that he feels Winston lacks the brains for university or a career as a barrister. After three attempts, Churchill is finally accepted by Sandhurst but his father is not pleased because he finished seventh from the bottom of the class and is only eligible to enter the cavalry which costs an extra \u00a3200 a year for a horse. Lord Randolph - clearly ill and making a number of factual errors about his son - scolds Churchill and warns him to face up to his responsibilities at Sandhurst and that if he does not make something of himself by 21 he will no longer support him.\nStill only in his mid forties, Lord Randolph, once a brilliant debater, makes an incoherent speech in Parliament, witnessed by both his wife and Winston. His death spells the end of Churchill's dream of entering Parliament at his side. Churchill graduates from Sandhurst near the top of the class, he becomes a second lieutenant and eventually goes to India and then takes part in the cavalry charge at the Battle of Omdurman in the Sudan. Later, he goes to South Africa to work as a war correspondent during the Anglo-Boer War. While travelling by armoured train, Churchill and soldiers are ambushed by Boers. They try to retreat but crash into a barricade of rocks on the railway track. Churchill courageously organises the soldiers to push the derailed carriage off the track so the train can proceed with the wounded, but the others are captured by the Boers. Churchill escapes, getting help from mine manager Howard, hiding three nights in the mine then riding a goods train into neutral Portuguese territory. He returns to England a hero, stands for the parliamentary seat of Oldham and wins, becoming an MP in a Conservative majority Parliament. With the encouragement of opposition Liberal MP Lloyd George, to the dismay of his mother and annoyance of senior Conservatives, he takes up his father's campaign to limit spending on the military.\nThe film ends with Sir Winston Churchill narrating events that follow including his marriage to Clementine Hozier seven years later.

The only other main resident is the maid, Brenda. To fight boredom, Oliviero organizes decadent parties for local hippies and humiliates and abuses Irina in front of the guests. A key early plot-point is the elegant gown that belonged to Rouvigny's dead mother that he catches Irina wearing which angers him. After his mistress Fausta, a young student and bookstore employee, is found murdered, Oliviero becomes the primary suspect after being fingered by Fausta's  boss Bartello. The author lies when questioned by police and tells them that he was fixing a flat tire on his car during the time Fausta was murdered and forces Irina to cover for him. Later, Irina investigates the supposed flat tire in the boot of her husbands car but he catches her and angrily beats her. During the night during a heavy thunder storm, Brenda puts on Esther's gown and is silently watched by Oliviero. Brenda senses someone else is in the house and attempts to flee to her room but is mortally wounded by the still-unseen killer with a bill-hook. Irina finds the dying Brenda who collapses at her feet. Oliviero appears and coldly views the body and convinces Irina to help him conceal it to avoid further suspicions. Brenda's body is buried in the cellar, although Oliviero refuses to dispose of the blood-stained gown with the body and tells Irina to wash it. \nThen Oliviero's niece Floriana suddenly arrives for a visit from Paris. A sinister gray-haired man also appears and seems to watch the Rouvigny's from afar. Later at the house, the same gray-haired man shows up and gives Irina a dry-cleaning package containing the gown. Oliviero flies into a rage after believing his wife sent the dress out to be cleaned and beats her and locks her in a closet where Satan claws Irina. Floriana finds her aunt in the closet and frees her. Irina finds comfort in Floriana's arms and bed, and the two start an affair and decide to find a way to deal with Oliviero. The same night, the killer strikes again and murders a local prostitute named Giovanna, who had coincidentally arrived in town the same day Floriana appeared. The girl's aunt/madame kills the attacker. The following day, the police inspector reveals to Oliviero that the serial killer was none other than the book store manager Bartello, who was really an escaped mental patient named Lipori. Rouvigny tells his wife this and attempts to strangle her. Floriana, meanwhile, has begun a relationship with the local milkman Dario, who previously dated Brenda. Following attending a dirt-bike race in which Dario competes but is forced to drop-out of due to his bike failing, Floriana is taken by Dario to an old barn where they make love while Oliviero secretly spies on them. \nIrina catches Satan after the cat kills several of her pet doves and in a rage stabs one of the cats eyes out with a pair of scissors. This is witnessed by the elderly woman who collects bottles from the house and she is ordered to leave by a crazed-looking Irina who rushes into the house and collapses. Later Oliviero enters Floriana's room and finds her laying in bed in his mother's gown. Floriana reveals she knew that her uncle spied on her when she bedded Dario in the barn loft and then proceeds to seduce Oliviero. The next morning, Oliviero confronts Irina about his missing cat and questions why she bought new scissors. When Irina mentions Esther, Oliviero lunges at her and rapes her, Floriana witnessing everything. The elderly woman, Mrs. Molinar, visits the town and asks to speak to the Chief of Police regarding the Rouvigny's.

Irina rushes outside and sees Dario secretly meeting with Floriana and asking her to meet him in the morning. Irina spies Satan and chases him into the cellar where she discovers that Brenda's corpse has been uncovered, giving credence to Oliviero's murderous plans. Irina approaches Olivero, passed out next to his typewriter and violently stabs him to death with the scissors. Following the murder, Floriana reveals she watched but indicates that Irina will surely go to prison unless she covers up the murder. Floriana reveals that she has been after the jewelry that Oliviero had stashed in the mansion. Irina humbly gives her the jewelry and the two have sex one final time before Floriana departs in the morning. The gray-haired man, Walter, sneaks into the house in the early morning hours and begins writing on Oliviero's type writer \"vendetta\" repeatedly before escaping as Irina and Floriana investigate. Disturbed by these events, Floriana abandons Irina and rushes out to meet Dario. Walter appears and its discovered is the secret-lover to Irina, who goes to the cellar. Irina reveals that it was she who killed Esther as well as Brenda. The original scheme was to convince Oliviero he was Brenda's killer and drive him mad, however his own plans to murder Irina and bed Floriana forced a change of plan. Walter kills both Floriana and Dario by throwing oil on the road as they attempt to escape on motorbike, making it look like an accident so he can recover the family jewels. Later, Irina pushes Walter off a cliff to have the jewelry all for herself. When Irina returns to the mansion, she finds the police there. Mrs. Molinar, the old woman, had filed a complaint for animal cruelty, as she had seen Irina stabbing Satan.
