[{"title": "The Beast with Five Fingers", "genres": ["Thriller", "Horror"], "wiki_plot": "Francis Ingram is a noted pianist who lives in a large manor house in Italy. Ingram suffered a stroke which left his right side immobile, and he has to use a wheelchair to get around. He has retreated to the manor house for the past few years, where he lives with his nurse, Julie Holden; his secretary and astrologist Hilary Cummins; a friend, Bruce Conrad; and his sister's son, Donald Arlington. Holden and Conrad are secretly in love. Holden plans to leave Ingram's service and return to America, but wants to talk it over with Ingram first. Conrad wants her to instead leave immediately, feeling that caring for Ingram is sapping her vitality, while Cummins opposes her leaving at all, saying he will be left with no time to do his work without her to take care of Ingram's needs. After witnessing Holden and Conrad kissing, Cummins tells Ingram of the affair. Ingram, unwilling to believe it, starts to choke Cummins. Holden's intervention saves him, but Ingram orders him out of the manor.\nThat night, Ingram is awakened by a storm outside. He climbs into his wheelchair and, disoriented by hallucinations, falls down the stairs, breaking his neck. Commissario Ovidio Castanio of the local police investigates the death, and finds no sign of foul play.\nHolden, Cummins, Conrad, Donald and his father Raymond Arlington, and Duprex, Ingram's attorney, gather for the reading of Ingram's will and testament. The Arlingtons assume they will get everything, and gloat to Cummins that they plan to have his cherished books shipped off and sold. Instead, Ingram's will grants all he owns to Holden. The Arlingtons threaten to have the will annulled by having Holden found culpable in Ingram's death, as his nurse. Duprex tells the Arlingtons that Ingram wrote an older will which gave everything to Donald, and offers to help overturn the new will in favor of the old one in exchange for a third of the estate. That night, while forging the \"older will\", Duprex is strangled to death. Only the assailant's left hand (which has Ingram's ring) is seen.\nCastanio investigates. Everyone hears Ingram playing the piano in the main hall, but when they go to check no one is there. Castanio witnesses Donald attacked and almost choked to death by the hand with Ingram's ring. He checks Ingram's coffin and finds that Ingram's left hand has been cut off, a hand-sized hole has been broken out of a window, and outside the hole is a trail of handprints. Castanio begins to believe Ingram's severed hand may have killed Duprex.\nCummins sees the disembodied hand while working in the library. He grabs the hand and locks it in a desk drawer. When he summons Conrad and Holden to show them, the hand is gone, and they assume it to have been a figment of his imagination. Donald remembers the combination and location of a safe in the house, and Castanio and his father accompany him to the room where it is located. Inside is the disembodied hand. In a panic, Donald flees the house with Conrad in pursuit. Holden realizes that Cummins is the killer, having acted to safeguard his books, but his conscience is driving him mad, making him insist that the hand did it all. She urges him to turn himself in, promising to speak on his behalf. He instead tries to kill her to keep her from telling anyone else. To stay his hand, she claims to believe the hand is responsible, and begs Cummins to protect her from it. Completely convinced by his delusion, Cummins seizes the hand and throws it in the fire, but the burning hand crawls out and chokes him, fading out of existence after he collapses.\nCastanio and Conrad discover a hidden record player with a recording of Ingram's piano playing which Cummins remotely triggered from his desk.

Something has happened which has brought Boray to rock bottom emotionally. At his apartment, he seems to be about to give up on his career; his manager Frederic Bauer is angry that Paul has misunderstood what performing would be like and admonishes him for thinking that music could no longer be part of his life. Paul's more sympathetic friend and accompanist Sid Jeffers asks Bauer to leave, and Boray says to Jeffers that he (Boray) always has wanted to do the right thing, but always has been \"on the outside, looking in,\" and cannot \"get back to that happy kid\" he once was.\nIn the past, young Paul is choosing a birthday present in a variety store run by Jeffers\u2019 father in their neighborhood in New York City. He rejects the suggestions of his father, a grocery store owner, but settles on a violin, which his father rejects as unsuitable; his price limit is $1.50. Esther, his mother, supportive at this stage, buys the $8 violin for the boy.\nA transition from his faltering first steps to being a gifted young violinist follows. On 15 October 1930, he overhears his family expressing frustration about the state of their finances and about how he is not helping by working at a real job. His father is dismissive of Paul's chances for success, and his brother Phil is extremely negative concerning his own possibilities for finding any job at all. Paul resolves to go out on his own so he is not dependent on his family or appears to be taking advantage of them. He finds a job with a locally broadcast orchestra in which Sid Jeffers is the pianist.\nAt a party, Paul meets the hostess, Helen Wright, a patroness in a loveless marriage with an ineffectual, aging third husband. Helen is a self-centered, adulterous woman who uses men as sexual playthings and is initially baffled by the strong-willed and independent Boray. She is rude to him during the party, but the next day, she sends him a gold cigarette case and a note of apology. \"Papa\" Boray is impressed, but Paul's mother is suspicious.\nAt first, Helen seems interested only in Boray's talent rather than in him as a person, though he is quick to press her on the second issue. He gains a manager, Bauer, from her connections, and is now in love with her. On the beach, near the Wrights' Long Island home, he reaches out to Helen after a swim, but she runs away; later in the evening, she falls off a horse, and as he tries to aid her, she resists, not wanting to be touched. He kisses her, and she tells him to leave her alone, although she clearly is drawn to him and makes no effort to run away.\nShortly, everything is different. As they lie by the ocean, Helen warns him he might be sorry that love was invented, but admits she cannot fight him any longer, and she admits she is in love with him. Waiting at home, his mother confronts him, pointing out that he has missed a date with Gina, also a musician and his long-time sweetheart. Esther does not believe Paul's denials that he has any interest in Helen. She warns him to be careful and to think carefully about his future. After Paul's debut concert, Esther heard Victor's putdown of Paul as a \"savage\".\nAfter a tour across America that takes several months, he has lunch with Gina. Sid arrives with Helen, who is immediately jealous and flees. Paul follows her, and they end up at Teddy's Bar. After Helen makes a scene by smashing her drink (\"What Is This Thing Called Love?\" is performed by Peg LaCentra in the background), against a wall, she and Paul go back to her home where she expresses anger at being neglected and begs him to allow her to be more involved in his life. Paul points out her married status, but Helen shrugs this off, suggesting they are both old enough to do as they choose. He kisses her.\nAt his new apartment containing numerous photographs of Helen, he confesses his love for her to his mother. They argue, and his mother slaps him. Disquieted by rumors he has heard, Helen's husband Victor asks her for a divorce. He is suspicious of her real intentions, asking her if she really can change and be happy with Paul, but Helen insists this is first time she has known real love.\nAt a rehearsal, Paul is passed a note from Helen claiming good news. She asks to see him immediately, but he crumples the note and continues with the rehearsal of the Carmen Fantasie (adapted for the film by Franz Waxman from Bizet's Carmen). At Teddy's Bar, Helen becomes increasingly drunk, and she is unable to tolerate the house pianist's performing \"Embraceable You\". Paul arrives to take her home. He repeatedly tells her he wants to marry her but she tries to dissuade him, even as she declares how much she loves him.\nShe goes to visit Paul's mother and attempts to convey that she understands herself, what sort of woman she is, but that she genuinely loves him. Esther does not bend; she does not believe Helen has any good intentions and demands she leave Paul alone.\nNeither Helen nor Esther attend Boray's next concert, his transcription of Wagner's Liebestod. Helen listens on the radio, after talking with him on the telephone and telling him not to worry. She drinks, becomes more upset with herself, and recalling her husband's words, realizes her dissolute past can only taint Paul's future. She walks along the beach and then to her death in the nearby ocean; in her jaded mind, this is the only logical resolution to their problems. Later, on the beach, a distraught Paul is comforted by the loyal Jeffers.\nReturning to the film's opening scene, Paul asks Jeffers to tell Bauer not to worry; he is not running away.

Helen, George's scheming girlfriend, had gotten him to date Barbara while she herself was seeing Rod. She hinted to Rod that he should kill his wife and marry her. That failed, as Rod actually loved Barbara, leaving Helen to plot to extort money out of Barbara through George. Meanwhile, Rusty, still certain that Rod loves her, boasts to him that her schemes had driven him and Barbara apart.\nAfter the power goes out in her mansion that night, Barbara is attacked by an unknown assailant in the dark. The attacker flees before finishing the job. Rod and Jeffers, their butler, show up shortly afterward, followed by Michael. Rod is taken in by the police for questioning, during which he is asked to telephone Michael for information about any insurance policies on Barbara's life. When Michael's secretary mentions that he has not been in the office all day, Rod remembers that he claimed to have received Rod's message about the latest attack. He insists that the police take him back to the mansion as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, Michael realizes he has blundered, telling Barbara that Helen was murdered with a hammer, something only the killer would know.

The crowd, containing Davin and his friends, who had thought that Parnell was going to speak in favour of eviction, put their rotten eggs away and are instead impressed.\nThe farmers are led by Hugh Davin (Stewart Granger) who, with the moral support of the local priest, Father McKeogh (Alastair Sim), encourages his fellow tenants to ostracize their land agent, the bombastic Captain Boycott (Cecil Parker). There is a love interest in the form of Ann Killain (Kathleen Ryan), whose father is also shunned for taking up a farm from which another farmer had been evicted. The resultant stand-off attracts international news coverage and will ultimately introduce a new word \u2013 to boycott \u2013 to the English language.Actions begin with Boycott's servants abandoning his house. One final servant, Bridget, is caught as last to leave. She tells him Davin asked them to leave. Everyone refuses to gather Boycott's crops.

The Captain acts as his own jockey on a horse bought from Davin. However, the crowd will not tolerate it, and despite the number of mounted troopers they block the Captain on his horse as he approaches the finishing line and mob him.\nMichael Fagan steals Davin's revolver and tries to kill Killain, who has been signing the eviction notices. A fight ensues and Fagan falls in a river. It is reported that he has been murdered.

After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator. The insurance company only has 24 hours to find the stolen goods, or they have to reimburse the fur company. Tracy and his semicompetent assistant Patton examine the dead body at the morgue and find a note on it stating that  three perpetrators performed the hit against the warehouse. It also mentions that they used a truck with the name \"Daisy\" on it. Unfortunately, the three perpetrators disguise the truck before Tracy can find it, and the lead is a dead end. The robbers soon leave their hideout in a local junkyard and go to a nearby bar to phone their boss and get new instructions. As they speak with the boss on the phone, their conversation is overheard by an informant, a blind beggar called Sightless, who goes to pass the information on. Sightless is sloppy and noisy when eavesdropping, and is nearly caught by the Claw.

They protest against the charges when Patton arrives and tells them that the number leads to the storeowner Humphries. Humphries' plan was all along to sell back the furs to the insurance company after the 24 hours had passed and collect the penalty fee stated in the policy. He calls the robbers at the same bar as before, instructing them to tell the insurance company to come to the bar with $50,000. Feeling guilty about sending Sightless off to a certain death before, Vitamin goes to the bar to find the killer, pretending to be a blind beggar himself.

Mr A is a \"methodical, exact\" bank clerk. His wife \"complains [he] has a mind like a double entry column; no virtues, no vices\". She wants a dream for him \"with practical values to widen his horizons, heighten ambitions, maybe a raise in salary\". Joe asks Mrs A to leave the room during Mr A's consultation. Mr A reveals that within his ledger he has a collection of art images cut from magazines, including  drawings of a woman reclining in bed; another on an old man's lap; another being shot by an animal-headed man; a filmic image of red liquid passing through water, and another of a melting wax figure of a woman.\nJoe \"finds a dream\" for Mr A based on these interests. In the dream (\"Desire\") leaves fall to the ground beside a red curtain. A woman in white reclines in a red-curtained four-poster bed. A small golden ball rises and falls from her mouth as she breathes. She swallows the ball, smiles and falls asleep. Jail bars appear by her bed, and a voyeuristic man watches from behind them as the woman dreams of nightingales with calves' hooves. It appears the man is part of her dream, and telephones her to ask in voiceover for details.  She tells him in voiceover \"they talked about love and pleasure\". The telephone by her bedside falls to the floor, breaks open and exudes a misty smoke, which envelops her bed. Two young men tumble over each other in what seems like a war scene of shipwrecked sailors.

She flirts, cries, almost leaves, comes back.  The music features a repeated wolf whistle over a light jazz tune.  Joe signs.  He removes her glasses and they almost kiss.  Smoke fills the screen, and clears with a closeup on a dismembered mannequin.  The music is a light tune sung by Holman with the refrain of \"untouched by human hands.\"  It segues into a sequence in which wigged and costumed mannequins seem to dance and pose.  Holman and White sing.  Whirling wheel graphics punctuate the scenes as jewellery is offered to \"a healthy girl\", Julie, as the male singer/mannequin woos her.  She cries \"this is ridiculous! Sisters, come to my aid!\" and \"so from his ardent arms she fled.\" The male mannequin is beheaded as Julie rides on an exercise cycle dressed in a bridal gown.  \"for there's no man alive who could ever survive a girl with a prefabricated heart.\"  We transition back to Joe's office as the young woman leaves, then suddenly returns and kisses him, then leaves again.\nAs she leaves, Mrs. A returns with a garbled, speeded up voiceover expressing her stream of consciousness.

The dream consists of spinning disc illusions (by Marcel Duchamp) and a prism distorted version of \u201cNude Descending a Staircase.\u201d  The gangster is unimpressed and robs Joe at gunpoint.  A policeman enters and asks the gangster for a gun license.  The gangster produces it and the cop lets him go.

Joe chooses a ladder and starts to climb.  He remembers the jubilance at the end of World War II  and the prospect of peace and optimism.  Streamers fall from the sky.  Suddenly Joe realizes the rungs are disappearing from his ladder.  He desperately grabs a window sill and pulls himself inside a room.  Dangling colorful circles surround a woman reclining in a hammock.  She offers Joe a drink, a bowl of cherries and a knife.  He kisses the woman and makes a move to slice open her throat but instead cuts the blue cord he\u2019s been following.  The cord bleeds red.  Joe exits the room and re-enters the poker room.

J. Hollingsworth delivering a sermon from the pulpit of his church. As the view widens, we see a young girl, Jenny Hollingsworth, listening with rapt attention. As the Reverend continues, his speech begins to falter, and Jenny helps him out by continuing a quotation from scripture that he had begun. The Reverend can soon no longer continue, though, and joins Jenny in her pew. Jenny addresses him as \"Grandpappy,\" so we understand the relationship between the two. By this point we realize that Jenny is the only member of the congregation, and the church seems to have been otherwise abandoned. Grandpappy then dies.\nWe next see Jenny trudging down a road through what appears to be desert. She is intermittently singing and talking to herself. We then see an airplane with one engine on fire descending through the night air, with an explosion following. Jenny refers to the fiery figure in the sky as \"Beelzebub\". Soon after the crash, a collie appears, and begins walking with Jenny. Along with the dog, Jenny finds a placard identifying the type of airplane that crashed, and she takes this with her. Dr. Steve Webster then appears along the road, driving his Jeep, and comes across Jenny and the dog, and invites them into his vehicle. Jenny spends the night with Dr. Webster in the home that he shares with Murph, the local pharmacist. Murph is surprised and initially somewhat upset when he discovers Jenny sleeping on the sofa the next morning, with the dog at her side. We then discover that Dr. Webster is conducting research on Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and has a number of infected ticks on his porch, making his home a dangerous place for a young girl. We also learn that he has applied for a grant to teach and study at an institute in San Francisco, and that he is hoping to hear a positive response from them via the mail any day now. Murph gives Jenny a much-needed bath, during which he fills her in on some of the back stories behind the local characters in town, along with some of his folksy philosophy about men and women and marriage.\nDr. Webster takes Jenny to meet his friend Susan Moore, who is living with Mathilda. Mathilda gives Steve and Susan an earful, letting us know that she thinks Steve is a hopeless dreamer, and that Susan is silly to continue waiting for him to propose to her. Jenny, who has grown up with her great-grandfather in isolation, has learned that it is important to tell the truth, and takes most things very literally. She then tells Mathilda what she thinks of her, along with some of what Murph has shared, resulting in Mathilda becoming upset and directing Steve to remove Jenny and the dog from her sight. Steve takes Jenny to Murph's pharmacy for a sundae, but the place is crowded with local children waiting for entrance to the movie house next door, and some of the children are unkind to Jenny, making her feel ashamed of the makeshift dress she is wearing. The ringleader is the mayor's son, who is genuinely cruel to her. When Steve is talking to Murph we learn that Murph has laid in a large stock of vaccine to prevent people from getting the Rocky Mountain spotted fever, but that Steve has not been able to convince the locals to have the vaccine administered to their children. We also learn that the local mayor has influenced the town to build a new park instead of a much-needed hospital, and that the nearest hospital is fifty miles away. Steve then decides that Jenny must have some new clothes to wear, and takes her to another local store to purchase them. He doesn't have enough money to pay for them, though, but arranges to trade tonsillectomies for the three children of the proprietor for Jenny's new clothes, of which she is very proud.\nDr. Webster is called away to attend to a sick boy, Clem Perkins. We learn that Clem has contracted spotted fever. Steve tells Clem's father that they should have had the boy vaccinated earlier, but that there is no medicine now to cure the disease, and that he must simply wait and hope for the best. While Steve is away, Jenny is walking home with her dog, and the mayor's son comes across them, and threatens Jenny. The dog then growls and chases the boy away, catching him and pulling down his pants, but not damaging anything other than the boy's inflated ego. When Steve and Jenny are both back at Murph and Steve's home, the mayor shows up with a gun, saying he is going to shoot the dog. Steve forcefully evicts the mayor from his home but, in the process, the mayor stumbles and falls on the porch, freeing the infected ticks. Steve warns Jenny to stay away from the porch, while Steve tries to secure the area, but Jenny walks through the porch, and we see Jenny rubbing a sore spot on her leg, letting us (but not Steve) know that she has been bitten by one of the ticks. Sheriff Bolton comes to arrest the dog, saying that the dog will be given a fair trial, but must remain in jail until the trial. Jenny weeps, afraid that her dog will be killed. Clem Perkins dies. The parents in town now all send their children to Steve's house to be vaccinated, and a long line forms. Susan and Mathilda both come over to help, and Murph brings more vaccine from his pharmacy. Steve starts to vaccinate Jenny at some point, but is interrupted, and never completes the procedure.\nThe dog's trial takes place. Steve is unavailable to act as defense attorney, and so Murph takes over. The mayor and his counsel insist that the dog bit the mayor's son. Jenny testifies, but is unable to persuade the judge on her own that the dog is innocent. The judge initially rules that the dog must be put down. However, Steve then shows up, and insists that the Mayor's son receive a medical examination to determine the extent of his alleged injuries. Murph, Steve and the judge them summarily subject the boy to a visual examination, with all three agreeing that he shows no sign of injuries to his posterior. The judge then reverses his decision, but declares that the dog must be kept under observation at the jail, to ensure that he is not diseased. Jenny now falls ill, and Steve confirms that she has spotted fever. Her fever begins to grow. Steve says there is nothing to do but hope for the best. Some of the other characters, however, insist that when nothing else can be done, prayer may work.\nAt this point Steve learns of the news of the plane crash, and discovers that the plane was carrying a dog to Colorado for use in creating a serum to cure Rocky Mountain spotted fever, since the dog had been sick but had recovered, and so had developed powerful antibodies to the disease. They then conclude that Jenny's dog is actually the dog from the airplane, and that Steve and Murph can make a serum from the dog's blood. They don't know how much of the serum to give her, though, so they try to contact the institute responsible for the dog and the serum\u2014the same institute to which Steve had applied. However the Institute tells them that Dr. Nicholas Adams is the only person who can answer their question, and he can't be reached, since he is driving to Colorado. Steve asks the local radio station to broadcast an emergency alert, and Dr. Adams hears it, and calls, and they found out the correct dosage just in time to administer the serum and cure Jenny.\nDr. Adams then arrives on the scene. At breakfast the next day, he awards Steve with a $5,000 grant to continue his studies of spotted fever. Steve announces that he will stay in town, will marry Susan, and will adopt Jenny. Dr. Adams says that they have drawn enough blood from the dog to serve their purposes, and so relinquish their claim on him, leaving him to round out the happy home forming with Steve, Susan and Jenny. Murph and Mathilda even seem on the verge of getting hitched, and so all ends happily.", "tmdb_plot": "An orphan helps a doctor fight an epidemic in a small western town, in one of Allan Dwan\u2019s closely observed studies in Americana.", "tmdb_id": "121994", "wiki_id": "44461437"}, {"title": "Easter Yeggs", "genres": ["Animation", "Action", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "Bugs Bunny finds the Easter Bunny (also called the \"Easter Rabbit\" throughout this cartoon) sitting on a rock, crying.

Marguerite is sweet and simple, while Marianne is extremely shrewd and plans to take over the family shipping business. William is the son of Dr. Edmond Ozanne (Frank Morgan), who has recently returned to the island after many years away. Additionally, Dr. Ozanne is the former teenage lover of Sophie Patourel (Gladys Cooper), Marguerite and Marianne's mother.

She married Octavius afterwards, under pressure from her parents.\nMeanwhile, the new clipper ship Green Dolphin arrives in the island's port. The captain of the ship, Captain O'Hara (Reginald Owen), tells William and Marianne of the wonders of the new colony of New Zealand. Captain O'Hara's men catch a stow-away, Timothy Haslam (Van Heflin), who recently killed his brother-in-law in self-defence. Captain O'Hara believes his story and agrees to smuggle the man to New Zealand. Marianne then schemes for her father to sponsor William to be a naval officer.

As it was the fault of his department, Michael is sent in 1887 to set Duke on the life path for which he was destined, but Michael must do so as a human being, without miracles, not even a small one.\nMichael encounters Bill Plummer. Plummer and Duke are rival saloon keepers and partners in a mining company, but due to a dispute between them, the mine is closed, leaving many of the townspeople destitute. Plummer has hired the Kansas City Kid, a gunslinger, to kill Duke. When Bill finds out that Duke knows about his plan, he gives Michael a lift into town and as Plummer hopes, Duke mistakes Michael for the Kid. Duke's satanic henchman, Treason, takes a shot at Michael, narrowly missing a young girl. Furious, parson's daughter and schoolmarm Drusilla Wainwright storms into the \"Copper Queen\", Duke's saloon, and slaps him.\nDrusilla and most of the other residents want to take the law into their own hands to take back their town, but Sheriff Matt Bodine talks them into waiting until Plummer and Duke's men kill each other first.\nMichael accidentally foils the Kid's attempt to shoot Duke. When Duke learns that the dead assassin is actually the Kansas City Kid, he believes that Michael is a smart, ambitious outlaw, so he hires him. Showgirl Ginger, Duke's girlfriend, takes a great liking to Michael; Treason hates him on sight.\nPlummer sets fire to Duke's saloon, trapping him inside, with Plummer's men waiting for him to come out. Duke's secret passageway is locked from the outside, but Michael opens it and rescues him. They take refuge in the school. While they wait for darkness, they start talking to Drusilla. Duke admits that he feels that he is \"meant for something ... something big, something important\", not what he is doing now, but he does not know what it is. Before he leaves, Duke kisses Drusilla; she resists at first, but not for long.\nIn retaliation, Treason, who walked through the blaze unharmed, sets fire to Plummer's saloon. Speck O'Donnell, a sickly child Duke likes, is trapped inside. Michael goes in after him, but Duke follows, sends Michael out and rescues Speck.\nSheriff Bodine maneuvers Duke and Plummer into a showdown for sole ownership of the mine. Duke accepts the challenge, even though he is at a great disadvantage against skilled gunman Plummer. Duke is wounded, but Plummer is blinded by sunlight, perhaps by divine intervention. Speck runs to Duke, pursued by Judd, who is shot saving the boy. Duke manages to kill Plummer with his last shot. In a daze, he walks to the church, where Drusilla waits. Dying, Judd recognizes Michael.\nWith Plummer dead, vigilantes plot to lynch Duke. Drusilla persuades Duke to flee rather than shoot it out, but he insists he will only go if she comes with him. She agrees. Once they are safely away, she confesses her love but refuses to marry him. Thwarted, the mob decides to lynch Michael instead, but the horse he is on refuses to move.

In the hopes of finding a home with plenty of food, the mice head on up to the House of Tomorrow.  Upon entry, they step on the welcome mat, which activates an audio recording that welcomes visitors to the House of Tomorrow and invites them to try out the many gadgets the house provides.  At first, Bertie is scared by the recording and tries to run away, but Hubie stops him and points out that this is the perfect place for them as everything for them can be provided at the touch of a button.\nAs a demonstration, Hubie pushes a button to the Automatic Record Player: the record player rises up out of the floor, a robotic arm on a table picks out a record disc from a collection of records and tosses it like a frisbee, and two robotic arms (one of them has a catcher's mitt) catch the record, put it on the turntable, and start playing the record.  Hubie and Bertie then start dancing to the music that plays, until Hubie spies a button that demonstrates the Automatic Sweeper.  Upon pressing the button, a cigarette lighter lights a cigar, a robotic puffer puffs the cigar, and a robotic arm taps the cigar ash on to the floor.  This summons the Robot Sweeper, a robot armed with a broom and having a dustpan near its wheels, that comes out, sweeps up the ash into its dustpan, sweeps it into the refuse bin, and returns to its closet.\nImpressed by what Hubie meant by the perfect house, Bertie insists on pushing the next button they come across, but Hubie slaps him and states that he himself will be pushing the buttons as Bertie isn't smart enough to do so.  As the mice go up onto the kitchen counter where some unlabeled buttons are, Bertie again requests to push a button.  Hubie gives in, but (out of fear that whatever button Bertie presses might hurt him) gets a safe distance away on the other side of the kitchen before giving Bertie the A-OK.  Bertie presses a button, where a light next to it reveals it's the laundry button.  This makes a vacuum appear above a hamper, where Hubie just happens to be, and suck up Hubie and the laundry.  Bertie then cringes and shakes as, offscreen (and to the tune of \"Here we go round the mulberry bush\"), Hubie goes through the washing, rinsing, mangling, ironing, and folding processes.  The laundry is then returned all pressed and ironed, with Hubie (looking pressed and ironed himself) at the top.  As a result, Hubie slaps Bertie for putting him through that.\nThe laundry incident is quickly forgotten when both mice spy a button labeled \"Cheese Dispenser\".  When Hubie presses the button, a wheel of cheese flies out, but crashes to the floor, which summons the Sweeper to come out, sweep up the mess, and put it in the bin.  To prevent losing the second wheel of cheese, Hubie arranges for Bertie to stand by to catch the cheese with a plate.  Straight after Hubie presses the button, another wheel of cheese flies out, but crashes on top of Bertie and the plate.  Again, the Sweeper comes out, sweeps up the mess and Bertie, sweeps them into the bin, and return to its closet.  Bertie escapes the bin, but thinking that Bertie is \"escaping refuse\", the Sweeper comes back out, sweeps up Bertie again, sweeps him back into the bin, and returns to its closet.  Twice, Bertie peeks out, but the Sweeper sticks its head out as if to say \"Oh, no you don't!\"\nSeeing this, Hubie comes up with a plan to rescue Bertie.  He does this by taking a large vase up to the house's second floor and tossing it out the window, where it crashes to the ground.  As expected, the Sweeper takes the bait, rushes up to the second floor (allowing Bertie to escape), and jumps out the window where it too crashes to the ground.  Afterwards, Bertie is thanking Hubie for saving him when the doorbell rings and Bertie answers it.  It's the Sweeper (looking battered from its fall) and, as a way of saying \"Nobody tricks me into jumping out of a window and gets away with it\", it sweeps up Bertie again, sweeps him back into the bin, and returns to its closet.\nComing up with another plan to save Bertie, Hubie pushes a box full of dynamite and fireworks off a shelf and onto the floor.  Detecting the new mess, the Sweeper leaves its closet (allowing Bertie to escape again), sweeps up the explosives, and sweeps them into the bin.  Hubie then pushes a lit candle and its holder off the shelf and onto the floor, once more making the Sweeper fall for the ruse.  The Sweeper sweeps up the candle and sweeps it into the bin, but the lit candle makes contact with the explosives already in the bin and they blow up on the Sweeper.  The Sweeper rolls away (dazed and severely damaged by the explosion) and breaks apart to pieces on the floor, but its hand presses a button labeled \"Repair Service\".  This summons the Robot Medic, a hodgepodge looking robot with pincers, a hammer, and a crane arm.  The Robot Medic leaves the same closet the Sweeper resides in, rebuilds the Sweeper offscreen, and both robots return to their closet.\nTo really drive the Sweeper crazy, Hubie and Bertie nail the floor doors of the Automatic Record Player shut so that when Hubie presses the button, the record player can't rise up out of the floor.  The robotic arm still picks out a record and tosses it, but with nothing to catch it, the record crashes against the wall and breaks into pieces which land on the floor, thus summoning the Sweeper to clean up the mess.  Hubie then increases the robotic arm's speed to fast, thus making the robotic arm toss the records at the wall faster than ever before.  The Sweeper returns to clean up the mess from the next record, but soon finds itself facing flying records that smash against the wall and tries to keep with cleaning up one mess after another.  Soon, the Sweeper's dustpan is so full of broken record pieces that when it tries to empty them into the bin, they just bury the bin.  Fed up with the ever increasing messes, the Sweeper dons a coat and hat, picks up a briefcase, puts an \"I Quit!\" sign on its closet door, and leaves the house.\nHubie starts to revel in their victory over the Sweeper, but the victory is short lived when Bertie spies a button labeled \"Spring Cleaning Service\" and stupidly pushes it.  This ends up summoning a whole army of Robot Sweepers that come straight out of another closet and begin cleaning up the place.  Hubie and Bertie try to escape the onslaught, but get caught up in a carpet being rolled up by one of the Sweepers and taken outside.  In the cartoon's final scene, as the Sweepers begin the carpet beating process and whack the mice in the process, Hubie says \"HEY, BOIT!

At the elegant Sutton Place townhouse, he rapidly charms Kay into agreeing, learning in the process she is not so well-heeled as the home and address suggest, but when they later arrive at the photo shoot, the Beautee art director produces a layout featuring \"a loose and flouncy\" negligee.

He summarizes his philosophy on advertising: \"You have just seen me do a disgusting thing, but you will always remember it!\" He confronts Vic about the change to his Dorrance ad, and Vic tells him, \"Beautee soap is a clean product\u2014and your advertisement is not clean.\" When Vic plays the radio commercial he produced overnight\u2014\"Love That Soap\"\u2014Evans likes it and directs Kim to hire Vic. \"You have your teeth in our problems,\" he says, removing and brandishing his own dentures.\nVic finds himself attracted to Kay.

The featured performer at the nightclub the couples attend is an apparent old flame of Vic's, Jean Ogilvie (Ava Gardner), a torch singer he had run into and chatted up at his first visit to the Kimberly agency just days earlier.  She acts very familiar with Vic in front of his date, unsettling Kay. In the wake of an evening spoiled by Kimberly's behavior, Vic persuades Kay to watch the sunset together at the beach, where they grow close.  In the morning glow, he arranges a purportedly above-board weekend getaway for the couple at a seaside haunt in Connecticut he had used for prewar trysting. When Kay arrives and finds that the place has slipped under its new owner and that the pair have been booked into adjoining rooms with a connecting door, she leaves, disgusted at the circumstances and profoundly disappointed in Vic.\nEvans summons Vic and Kim to an abrupt Sunday-morning \"chat-chat\" and reveals he wants a new radio variety show built around C-list ex-burlesque comedian Buddy Hare (Keenan Wynn). Chastising the ad men for his having to do their work for them, Evans informs them that Hare's agent Dave Lash (Edward Arnold) will be leaving for the coast on that evening's train. Vic promises to ink a deal on board, before word of Evans's interest leaks out and boosts Hare's price. On the way to the station, he stops at Kay's house, but she is remote: \"You'll make any promise to make your point,\" and he replies, \"That's the kind of guy I am.\" Their parting is unsettling for each.\n\nOn the train, Vic bumps again into Jean Ogilvie, whom he recruits for his plan to sign Hare; with her shilling, he gets Lash to offer Hare at a bargain basement price. They shake on the deal, and when Lash realizes he has been had, he graciously agrees to honor it.\nOnce in Hollywood, Vic and his writers set about creating the radio show for Hare; early on, they ban him from the proceedings because he is so obnoxious and his jokes are both off-key and threadbare. Vic accepts an invitation from Jean for dinner at her place, where both ruefully discover Vic is still in love with Kay.  He is surprised to find Kay in the shadows outside his bungalow when he returns, there to try to patch things up. She is successful\u2014Vic starts talking marriage, and seeing himself as a breadwinner for Kay and her children.\nTrouble intervenes when a legal technicality threatens the contract with Buddy Hare. Though it appears to be based on an honest mistake by Lash, Vic uses cruel innuendo about Lash's childhood and implied blackmail to get the agent to agree to absorb the large loss he will face making good. Vic immediately regrets the tactic, and Lash's wounded demeanor makes him feel even shabbier.\nBack in New York with a recording of the proposed show in hand, Vic and Kim are summoned to a 2:00 am meeting with Evans immediately upon Vic's arrival.

They are on their way to San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Michael, attracted to Elsa despite misgivings, agrees to sign on as an able seaman aboard Bannister's yacht.\nThey are joined on the boat by Bannister's partner, George Grisby, who proposes that Michael \"murder\" him in a plot to fake his own death. He promises Michael $5,000 and explains that since he would not really be dead and since there would be no corpse, Michael could not be convicted of murder (reflecting corpus delicti laws at the time). Michael agrees, intending to use the money to run away with Elsa. Grisby has Michael sign a confession.\n\nOn the night of the crime, Sydney Broome, a private investigator who has been following Elsa on her husband's orders, confronts Grisby. Broome has learned of Grisby's plan to murder Bannister, frame Michael, and escape by pretending to have also been murdered. Grisby shoots Broome and leaves him for dead. Unaware of what has happened, Michael proceeds with the night's arrangement and sees Grisby off on a motorboat before shooting a gun into the ground to draw attention to himself. Meanwhile, Broome, mortally wounded but still alive, asks Elsa for help.

He feels he can win the case if Michael pleads justifiable homicide. During the trial, the incompetent judge quickly loses control of the proceedings. Bannister learns of his wife's relationship with Michael. He ultimately takes pleasure in his suspicion that they will lose the case. Bannister also indicates that he knows the real killer's identity. Before the verdict, Michael escapes by feigning a suicide attempt (swallowing pain relief pills Bannister takes for his disability), causing a commotion in which he slips out of the building with the jury for another case. Elsa follows and she and Michael hide in a Chinatown theater. Elsa calls some Chinese friends to meet her. As Michael and Elsa wait and pretend to watch the show, Michael realizes that she killed Grisby. Michael passes out from the pills he took just as Elsa's Chinese friends arrive; they carry the unconscious Michael to an empty fun house. When he wakes, he realizes that Grisby and Elsa had been planning to murder Bannister and frame him for the crime, but that Broome's involvement ruined the scheme and that Elsa had to kill Grisby for her own protection.\nThe film features a unique climactic shootout in a hall of mirrors involving a multitude of false and real mirrored images in the Magic Mirror Maze, in which Elsa is mortally wounded and Bannister is killed.

His comfortable, predictable world is overturned when he learns, to his horror, that both his son and his daughter have fallen in love with non-Bostonians instead of with the partners Mr. Apley and the family have arranged. Son John, always intended for his cousin Agnes, a shy girl who adores him, has fallen for Myrtle, the daughter of a successful manufacturer who lives in Worcester. Daughter Eleanor is in love with Howard Boulder, a lecturer at Harvard who eventually loses his position through George's interference.

Ralph arranges for Nicholas to be hired as a tutor, and finds Kate work as a seamstress. Nicholas meets his new employer Mr. Squeers just as he concludes his daily business with Mr. Snawley, who is \"boarding\" his two unwanted stepsons.\nNicholas is horrified to discover that his employers, the sadistic Mr. and Mrs. Squeers, run their boarding school, Dotheboys Hall in Yorkshire, like a prison. They physically, verbally, and emotionally abuse their young charges on a regular basis. Nicholas eventually rebels and escapes, taking with him young friend \u2013 the crippled Smike.\nNicholas and Smike take lodgings with Newman Noggs, Ralph Nickleby's clerk. Nicholas tries to find a job, but rejects a low-paying position as a politician's secretary. A job as a tutor of French for the Kenwig daughters comes to comic disaster.

Hawk refuses Nicholas's demand to \"step outside\", and they fight in Hawk's carriage, resulting in an accident in which Hawk is injured. Hawk and Lord Verisopht argue over Hawk's lack of honour, and Hawk kills Lord Verisopht in a duel with pistols. As a result, Ralph Nickleby loses \u00a36,000, owed to him by Verisopht, much to the delight of Noggs, who harbours a hidden desire for revenge against his employer.\nNicholas then finds employment as a clerk with the portly, benevolent, twin brothers Cheeryble, whose nephew Frank begins to court Kate. They provide him a cottage in which Nicholas can place his family and Smike, who has been accepted warmly by all. Meanwhile, Squeers returns to London, planning to capture Smike and bring him back to Dotheboys Hall, and is engaged by Ralph Nickleby to stalk Nicholas and Smike.

She complains that his engineering job has kept him away too long. That night, Verdoux murders her for her money.\nAt a dinner party with his real wife and their friend the local chemist, Verdoux asks the chemist about the drug he developed to exterminate animals painlessly. The chemist explains the formula and that he had to stop working on it after the local pharmaceutical board banned it.

The mortally wounded king escapes from the palace with his queen and their two daughters. They take shelter in a temple disguised as ordinary citizens.  The elder princess ventures out on her horse disguised as a young boy to get help from her uncle, the king's brother Maharana Kharak Singh who rules another state.  She succeeds in escaping treacherous attacks by Mangal Singh's men on her way. In the meanwhile Mangal Singh learns the whereabouts of the king.  He goes to the temple and kills the king and the queen. His soldiers inform him that the two princesses were killed on their way to get help from their uncle. The younger princess Kamal who was present in the temple with her parents is a toddler and escapes the villainy of Mangal Singh by walking out of the temple alone.  She is found by an \"untouchable\" man who brings her home and adopts her as his daughter despite his wife's objections. She is named Ganga.  In the meanwhile, the older princess is helped by her uncle who raids Janakgarh, kills Mangal Singh and appoints the princess to rule the kingdom of Janakgarh until her father can be located.\nOne day while helping her father clean the city premises outside a temple, little Ganga, enters the inner chamber of the temple and incurs the priest's wrath for breaking the rule that untouchables can not enter temples. The childless couple leaves Janakgarh after running into trouble with the priest and raise Ganga in a nearby town while the older princess rules over Janakgarh. In their newly adopted town - Ganga's adoptive parents do not tell anyone about their social status of \"untouchables\" nor engage in their low caste work of public cleaning. They make a living by doing labor jobs. Ganga is cherished by her adoptive father but his wife remains negative towards her.\nTeenager Ganga (Madhubala) meets and falls in love with Madhu Sudan (Raj Kapoor), a rich but skeptical artist from Janakgarh who is in town to carve stone artifacts in a temple. Having lost his parents, he lives in a mansion in Janakgarh with guru ji, his mentor, spiritual guide and the teacher who taught him sculpting.  While working, Madhu Sudan slips and falls down from the upper level of his work site one day.  Ganga and her father bring him home and the family looks after him until he recovers from his injuries.  Ganga's simplicity and doting love both worry and overwhelm Madhu Sudan who tells her \"the harder I close the doors of my heart, the louder you knock ..\" However, he allows her to follow him to Janakagarh along with her parents since he feels obligated to help the family for their hospitality. He employs the family as laborers in his art workshop in Janakgarh.\nThe princess ruling Janakgarh appoints Madhu Sudan to make stone artifacts for the palace including her own image in stone.  Soon, she develops a liking for the rakish artist as well. Realizing that Madhu Sudan is spending most of his time in the palace, Ganga goes to the palace with her friend, dressed as a princess and tells Madhu Sudan to explain his work to her.  Madhu Sudan reprimands her for the childish prank.  However, he does explain that his artifacts depict life and death. Life as a ruthless, cruel and double faced creature and death as a loving and beautiful mother. Ganga listens to him, feeling enchanted while Madhu Sudan's mentor, the guru ji watches in amusement. Just then, the princess arrives at the scene and sees Ganga impersonating her.  Feeling indignant she orders that both girls be arrested and whipped. Madhu Sudan implores with the princess but Ganga and her friend are lashed before they are able to leave the prison.\nSoon, the princess begins to express her views and her love to a fascinated Madhu Sudan.  As he begins to warm up to the princess, Madhu Sudan's mentor warns him that Ganga's innocent love represents the soul, the creativity; whereas the princess's love represents the common and mundane desire/passion which will ultimately scuffle his creativity. Pleased and gratified with his spiritual mentor's counsel, Madhu Sudan Ganga that he will soon have his guide talk to her father and that they will then get engaged. He promises her that he will take her to the temple to fulfill her cherished desire of going inside the temple, which Ganga had expressed in the past, only to be forbidden by her father to do so.  When Ganga's adoptive mother hears that Madhu Sudan is ready to marry Ganga, she reprimands Ganga for being selfish.  She reveals to her that they are \"untouchables\" and that Ganga's lineage was unknown - which would make it impossible for her to marry an upper caste Madhu Sudan. Heart broken by the revelation that she could never marry her love, Ganga quietly goes to the pond, jumps into it and dies while her mother watches from a distance. In the meanwhile, Madhu Sudan brushes aside the princess's objections to his decision to choose Ganga over her.  Enraged, the princess breaks the artifacts built by him.  Madhu Sudan remains undeterred and leaves the palace.  Ganga is found to be missing and Madhu Sudan, Ganga's father and some other men frantically look for her. They call out her name by the pond.\nA maid tells a distraught princess that her little sister has been found.  She gets up and quickly goes to meet her sister but soon returns saying angrily that those people were lying and trying to deceive her to gain wealth and that her little sister Kamal had a special circular mark/formation on the palm of her right hand. This was not known to anyone until this time.  Since Ganga had such a mark on her right hand the rumor goes around that Ganga was the younger princess. The Princess announces a large reward for whoever will find Ganga.  Ganga's mother brings her dead body out of the pond and asks the princess to give her the reward.  The princess cries in deep remorse.\nA few days later a blue lotus (neel kamal) is seen growing in the pond at the spot where Ganga's body was found.  Madhu Sudan sees this.  Surprised, he exclaims that a rare and his favorite variety of lotus has suddenly grown in the pond that never had lotus flowers growing in it.  He wanted lotus flowers to grow in the pond and had even tried to install a blue lotus flower carved from stone in the pond one day while Ganga- princess Kamal watched him.  His mentor had talked him out of the idea of installing stone flower/s in the pond.  Madhu Sudan feels that Ganga has fulfilled his heart's wish by taking the form of the beautiful blue lotus flower in the pond.  To honor and reciprocate her love, he decides to fulfill Ganga's wish of going into the temple with him - He carries the blue lotus flower into the temple and offers it to the gods.  Putting his skepticism aside Madhu Sudan humbly says to the god that he never thought he would have to come to his temple for such a tragic reason.

Later, the doctor and his brother (Wagner), a loan shark, meet Kino after he finds a valuable pearl and they decide to steal it from him.\nThe opening scene shows waves crashing and people of the village standing on the beach watching. The first couple of minutes portrays that the people rely on the natural resources to survive. The houses are built out of wood and the ocean provides oysters for them to eat. Although they rely on it, the resources, like the pearl, can be dangerous. As the men of the village watch the ocean waiting for it to calm they must wait another day to dive for resources. The next day as the men go out to dive Kino stumbles upon a majestic pearl. He immediately grabs it and returns to his wife.\nJuana, Kino's wife, is convinced that the pearl only brings bad luck and tries to convince Kino to return the pearl to the sea.

The men want to prevent Kino from gaining social mobility, and they want him and his family to remain at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Kino does not accept the deal and decides to go to the city instead. Kino starts drinking with these men who were most likely only with him to get him intoxicated enough to get the pearl.

Madeliene agrees.\nThe Walters invite the Duroys to their home to a viewing of a celebrated and costly painting (it is boldly coloured and full of evil-looking creatures). Suzanne, now a sought-after heiress, is delighted to see him. Seeing Madeleine and Laroche-Mathieu conversing at the gathering gives Georges an idea. Laroche-Mathieu is attracted to Madeleine, so he asks her to lead the foreign minister on to gain information and ensure that he does not deceive Georges again, at least that is what he tells her. He then uses this as grounds for divorce, so he can marry Suzanne. Her father is outraged, and her mother aghast. Upon further consideration, however, and for his daughter's happiness, he gives his consent. This is too much for Clotilde to stand.\nAccording to French law, a person can appropriate a noble name if there are no known survivors. Georges does just that. Madame Walter, however, locates Philippe de Cantel, the last descendant, though too late. He challenges Georges to a duel, two weeks before his marriage. Before the duel, Georges professes to Clotilde that there are only two people he loves: her and her young daughter. Clotilde goes to the Walters to try to stop the duel, but the two men fatally shoot each other.

In the aftermath of the massacre Jeb is found by Mrs Callum, a widow, who raises him in her family. Traumatized by the killings, Jeb does not recall anything of that night, except for vague images that he sees in a frequent nightmare. Mrs Callum raises him as her own son, together with her daughter Thorley \"Thor\" and her son Adam. Years later Jeb is shot at while riding a colt, but the shooter misses him. Although Mrs Callum blames the incident on deer hunters, she knows that it was an attempted murder by her brother-in-law, Grant. She confronts Grant and it is revealed that there has been a long-standing feud between the Rands and the Callums. Jeb's father - with whom Mrs Callum was having an affair - took the life of her husband, and in an act of revenge, Grant killed Jeb's family. The night of the massacre Grant's arm is so severely injured he eventually loses it. Mrs Callum pleads with her brother-in-law to leave Jeb alone, reasoning that he is not a threat to anyone. Grant agrees to let Jeb live in order to prove to Mrs Callum that one day Jeb will turn on her.\nYears later, Jeb, Adam and Thor are adults, and one day in 1898, law officials arrive to recruit volunteers to join the US Army. Jeb and Adam are told that one of them must join. After agreeing on a coin toss, Jeb loses the toss and signs up.

After his homecoming celebration, Jeb tries to persuade Thor to run away with him and get married as soon as possible. He suspects that someone, or something, is following him. Thor refuses, saying that she wishes to get married on her own terms and not out of fear. Jeb goes for a long horse ride in order to clear his head and stumbles upon an abandoned ranch which he suspects he has seen before. When he returns home, his mother confirms that the ranch he came across is where he lived with his real parents as child, and where the murders occurred. As Jeb prepares to leave to gamble at the casino in town, Adam shows him the money that had been set aside for him while he was in the army. He also shows Jeb the profits he is entitled to according to their mother's wish that everything be split among the three. However, Adam calls Jeb's share the 'Rand share' and expresses resentment that there should be any money given to Jeb at all. The two come to the conclusion that the ranch is not big enough for both of them, and agree to a coin toss to determine who will leave. Jeb loses; Adam relishes throwing him out and they end up in a fistfight. Jeb declares he will return the next day for Thor and promises that, if Adam tries to stop him, he will kill him.\nJeb has a big win at the casino and the owner, Jake Dingle, offers him a partnership. Meanwhile Adam ambushes Jeb on his way back from the casino, but is killed by Jeb in self-defense.

The first person she meets in town is Brice Chamberlain (Melvyn Douglas), who warns her of likely unhappiness with Brewton, locally considered a tyrant. He takes her to the courthouse, where she sees Brewton testifying against a settler who had tried to stake a claim to part of the government-owned land where Brewton runs his cattle.\nBack at the ranch, Brewton takes her out to see the vast prairie. He explains how he had fought with Indians to run his cattle there and to make it fit for ranching. He runs his cattle on government-owned land, and opposes homesteaders because he believes the Great Plains do not get enough rain to sustain farming. Lutie struggles to understand Brewton's attraction to the forbidding prairie, but she tries to make the most of her new home.\nShe persuades Brewton to allow a family of settlers onto the ranch, because she had befriended one of them. Brewton warns her that the settlers will not last more than six months, due to some unforeseeable, but certain, circumstance. When Lutie visits the settlers as they build their sod house, she is surprised to see Chamberlain. He is visiting the settlers because he had helped them file their claim on the land. He rides with Lutie on her way back home and confesses his attraction to her. Lutie confesses her struggles to adapt to her new home and her husband's emotional distance. Lutie gives birth to a daughter, Sara Beth.\nDuring a great blizzard, the settlers are alarmed by the sound of Brewton's cattle near their house. Fearful for his wheat crop, knowing its destruction would spell the ruin of his farm, the man goes out of the house with his rifle, planning to scare off the cattle. When they stampede, he shoots and kills one of the cows; he also wounds one of Brewton's cowboys, who were trying to herd the cattle in the storm. The rest of the ranch hands severely beat the farmer. His pregnant wife goes into the fierce storm to help him inside and loses her baby. When Lutie learns of the incident, she rides quickly out to the settlers' house, but they refuse to see her. Having lost their crop and baby, they are broken and concede the land to Brewton.\nBrewton tells Lutie that he had warned her the settlers faced severe challenges. Furious with him, Lutie decides to leave Salt Fork for a while. She goes to Denver. While planning to return to St. Louis, she runs into Chamberlain. The two have a discreet affair, and Lutie decides to return to Brewton. After her return to Salt Fork, she gives birth to a boy, whom she names Brock. She continues to struggle in Brewton's world.\nChamberlain successfully lobbies for a Federal District Court in Salt Fork, and he wins election as its judge. He will preside over land disputes, which increase as the government encourages homesteading. Brewton believes that Chamberlain will decide in favor of settlers on \"his\" land. As he arms himself and his men to ward off the settlers, Lutie pleads with him to reconsider. They argue in the abandoned sod house, where Brewton prepares his ammunition, and he gets Lutie to confess to the affair with Chamberlain. She agrees to leave, but Brewton refuses to let her take the two children.\nBack in St. Louis, she consults a lawyer. He says that if she testifies in court that Chamberlain is Brock's father, she could win custody of her son, but she would certainly lose custody of Sara Beth. Convinced that fighting would cause too much damage to her children, Lutie stays away. She returns after two years in a futile attempt to reconnect with them, who no longer recognize her. Chamberlain tries to get her to fight for Brock's custody so they can run away together as a family, but Lutie says that she does not love him enough to marry him.\nAs the years pass, the town doctor keeps Lutie informed about her children through letters. On his deathbed, he chides Brewton for driving Lutie away by his emotional distance. After the doctor's death, Chamberlain takes up the correspondence to tell Lutie about her children. He shares his concerns that Brock has grown into a reckless young man, too endowed with charm and luck.\nFor years, Brock has endured taunts from townsfolk about his \"real father,\" but the truth has never been acknowledged outright. During a card game, his opponent refers repeatedly to Brock only as \"judge\", referring to Chamberlain. Brock gets drawn into conflict and, when his opponent draws his pistol, Brock shoots him fatally in the stomach. Once Brock is bailed out of jail, he returns home and confesses the incident to his father and sister. Brewton insists that Brock return to town and stand trial. In private, Brock confesses to his sister that he could not stand a trial because it would bring up the reason for the fight, and humiliate their father. Brock decides to flee, and the sheriff pursues him with a posse. Brewton goes after him when Sara Beth tells why Brock skipped bail.\nBrewton reaches the cabin where the posse is exchanging gunfire with Brock, who is holed up inside. When Brewton enters the cabin, he finds his son fatally shot.\nHaving read in the newspaper that Brock was on the run, Lutie returns by train to Salt Fork. Just before arriving, she learns that he has been killed. She decides to keep traveling to San Francisco later that night.

The lion tries to kill the mouse by lighting a bomb with a match, putting it in his mouth, and swallowing it. When the mouse sees the bomb inside the lion's stomach and screams, he escapes the lion's mouth again and flees from him. The lion feels smug until he realizes the bomb is still inside him, which makes him scream for help, and blows up, but can't blow him up when he survives the explosion and gets his tail bitten by the mouse, who grabs and bites the lion's tail and angers him even more.\nWhile the lion looks for the mouse, the mouse sneaks inside his head and then pulls out firecrackers, which blow up. The mouse cooks the lion's tail, causing him to roar in pain, and when he goes to the lake to cool it down, the mouse pulls out a safety pin to poke on his rear.\nThe lion then tries to hide from the mouse, but finds him in the following areas:\n\nOn top of a palm tree\nUnder a rock to hopefully dodge the mouse, only to find him in it\nIn an abandoned hut\nIn a gun that the lion fires to shoot the mouse\nIn a bed where the mouth lives in\nIn a reflection of the mirror\nIn a bottle of whiskey, that he tries to drinkThe mouse finally peeves the lion in different ways by hurting his feet, blowing a toot in his ears, biting his nose, and kicking him out, and when he is now a nervous wreck, the lion runs out of the hut and around the jungle.\nAfter the story, the mouse wonders how anyone could be afraid of a mouse when another mouse shows up and says \"Boo.\" and despite being a mouse himself, he says 'A mouse.' and screams and runs off like the lion did.", "tmdb_plot": "The king of the jungle, after a well-spent day terrorising the rest of the animals, is petrified by a mouse.", "tmdb_id": "87195", "wiki_id": "13465016"}, {"title": "Slave Girl", "genres": ["Adventure", "Comedy"], "wiki_plot": "When American playboy Matt Claiborne (George Brent) embarks on a mission to Tripoli, he finds forbidden love and political intrigue when he falls for a dancing girl involved with rival lords.

Lily eventually gives up on staying in touch with the Normans and drops out of Jimmy's life, although she misses him. The Normans do not tell Jimmy he is adopted and he regards them as his parents.\nEight years pass, during which time Lily rises to the level of manager at the department store and falls in love with a kind shopkeeper, Bill Collins (Bill Owen), who marries her and is willing to accept Jimmy as his own. Lily visits the Normans to reclaim Jimmy, now that she has the resources to take care of him, but the Normans refuse to give him up since Lily has not been part of Jimmy's life and he does not know he is not the Normans' natural child. A legal battle ensues, and the court awards custody of Jimmy to Lily due to the lack of any formal adoption agreement. Jimmy goes to live with Lily and Bill, but has trouble adjusting to life in a working-class household, and runs away in an attempt to return to the Normans, whom he considers his true \"mummy and daddy\".
